<text>An electric light, lamp, or light bulb is an electrical component that produces light. It is the most common form of artificial lighting. Lamps usually have a base made of ceramic, metal, glass, or plastic which secures the lamp in the socket of a light fixture, which is often called a &quot;lamp&quot; as well. The electrical connection to the socket may be made with a screw-thread base, two metal pins, two metal caps or a bayonet mount.

The three main categories of electric lights are incandescent lamps, which produce light by a filament heated white-hot by electric current, gas-discharge lamps, which produce light by means of an electric arc through a gas, such as fluorescent lamps, and LED lamps, which produce light by a flow of electrons across a band gap in a semiconductor.

The energy efficiency of electric lighting has increased radically since the first demonstration of arc lamps and the incandescent light bulb of the 19th century. Modern electric light sources come in a profusion of types and sizes adapted to many applications. Most modern electric lighting is powered by centrally generated electric power, but lighting may also be powered by mobile or standby electric generators or battery systems. Battery-powered light is often reserved for when and where stationary lights fail, often in the form of flashlights or electric lanterns, as well as in vehicles.

== History ==
Before electric lighting became common in the early 20th century, people used candles, gas lights, oil lamps, and fires. In 1799–1800, Alessandro Volta created the voltaic pile, the first electric battery. Current from these batteries could heat copper wire to incandescence. Vasily Vladimirovich Petrov developed the first persistent electric arc in 1802, and English chemist Humphry Davy gave a practical demonstration of an arc light in 1806. 
It took more than a century of continuous and incremental improvement, including numerous designs, patents, and resulting intellectual property disputes, to get from these early experiments to commercially produced incandescent light bulbs in the 1920s.

In 1840, Warren de la Rue enclosed a platinum coil in a vacuum tube and passed an electric current through it, thus creating one of the world&#x27;s first electric light bulbs. The design was based on the concept that the high melting point of platinum would allow it to operate at high temperatures and that the evacuated chamber would contain fewer gas molecules to react with the platinum, improving its longevity. Although it was an efficient design, the cost of the platinum made it impractical for commercial use.

William Greener, an English inventor, made significant contributions to early electric lighting with his lamp in 1846 (patent specification 11076), laying the groundwork for future innovations such as those by Thomas Edison.

The late 1870s and 1880s were marked by intense competition and innovation, with inventors like Joseph Swan in the UK and Thomas Edison in the US independently developing functional incandescent lamps. Swan&#x27;s bulbs, based on designs by William Staite, were successful, but the filaments were too thick. Edison worked to create bulbs with thinner filaments, leading to a better design. The rivalry between Swan and Edison eventually led to a merger, forming the Edison and Swan Electric Light Company. By the early twentieth century these had completely replaced arc lamps.

The turn of the century saw further improvements in bulb longevity and efficiency, notably with the introduction of the tungsten filament by William D. Coolidge, who applied for a patent in 1912. This innovation became a standard for incandescent bulbs for many years.

In 1910, Georges Claude introduced the first neon light, paving the way for neon signs which would become ubiquitous in advertising.

In 1934, Arthur Compton, a renowned physicist and GE consultant, reported to the GE lamp department on successful experiments with fluorescent lighting at General Electric Co., Ltd. in Great Britain (unrelated to General Electric in the United States). Stimulated by this report, and with all of the key elements available, a team led by George E. Inman built a prototype fluorescent lamp in 1934 at General Electric&#x27;s Nela Park (Ohio) engineering laboratory. This was not a trivial exercise; as noted by Arthur A. Bright, &quot;A great deal of experimentation had to be done on lamp sizes and shapes, cathode construction, gas pressures of both argon and mercury vapor, colors of fluorescent powders, methods of attaching them to the inside of the tube, and other details of the lamp and its auxiliaries before the new device was ready for the public.&quot;

The first practical LED arrived in 1962.

=== U.S. transition to LED bulbs ===
In the United States, incandescent light bulbs including halogen bulbs stopped being sold as of August 1, 2023, because they do not meet minimum lumens per watt performance metrics established by the U.S. Department of Energy. Compact fluorescent bulbs are also banned despite their lumens per watt performance because of their toxic mercury that can be released into the home if broken and widespread problems with proper disposal of mercury-containing bulbs.

== Types ==
=== Incandescent ===

In its modern form, the incandescent light bulb consists of a coiled filament of tungsten sealed in a globular glass chamber, either a vacuum or full of an inert gas such as argon. When an electric current is connected, the tungsten is heated to and glows, emitting light that approximates a continuous spectrum.

Incandescent bulbs are highly inefficient, in that just 2–5% of the energy consumed is emitted as visible, usable light. The remaining 95% is lost as heat. In warmer climates, the emitted heat must then be removed, putting additional pressure on ventilation or air conditioning systems. In colder weather, the heat byproduct has some value, and has been successfully harnessed for warming in devices such as heat lamps. Incandescent bulbs are nonetheless being phased out in favor of technologies like CFLs and LED bulbs in many countries due to their low energy efficiency. The European Commission estimated in 2012 that a complete ban on incandescent bulbs would contribute 5 to 10 billion euros to the economy and save 15 billion metric tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions.

=== Halogen ===

Halogen lamps are usually much smaller than standard incandescent lamps, because for successful operation a bulb temperature over 200 °C is generally necessary. For this reason, most have a bulb of fused silica (quartz) or aluminosilicate glass. This is often sealed inside an additional layer of glass. The outer glass is a safety precaution, to reduce ultraviolet emission and to contain hot glass shards should the inner envelope explode during operation. Oily residue from fingerprints may cause a hot quartz envelope to shatter due to excessive heat buildup at the contamination site. The risk of burns or fire is also greater with bare bulbs, leading to their prohibition in some places, unless enclosed by the luminaire.

Those designed for 12- or 24-volt operation have compact filaments, useful for good optical control. Also, they have higher efficacies (lumens per watt) and longer lives than non-halogen types. The light output remains almost constant throughout their life.

=== Fluorescent ===
Fluorescent lamps consist of a glass tube that contains mercury vapour or argon under low pressure. Electricity flowing through the tube causes the gases to give off ultraviolet energy. The inside of the tubes are coated with phosphors that give off visible light when struck by ultraviolet photons. They have much higher efficiency than incandescent lamps. For the same amount of light generated, they typically use around one-quarter to one-third the power of an incandescent. The typical luminous efficacy of fluorescent lighting systems is 50–100 lumens per watt, several times the efficacy of incandescent bulbs with comparable light output. Fluorescent lamp fixtures are more costly than incandescent lamps, because they require a ballast to regulate the current through the lamp, but the lower energy cost typically offsets the higher initial cost. Compact fluorescent lamps are available in the same popular sizes as incandescent lamps and are used as an energy-saving alternative in homes. Because they contain mercury, many fluorescent lamps are classified as hazardous waste. The United States Environmental Protection Agency recommends that fluorescent lamps be segregated from general waste for recycling or safe disposal, and some jurisdictions require recycling of them.

=== LED ===
The solid-state light-emitting diode (LED) has been popular as an indicator light in consumer electronics and professional audio gear since the 1970s. In the 2000s, efficacy and output have risen to the point where LEDs are now being used in lighting applications such as car headlights and brake lights, in flashlights and bicycle lights, as well as in decorative applications, such as holiday lighting. Indicator LEDs are known for their extremely long life, up to 100,000 hours, but lighting LEDs are operated much less conservatively, and consequently have shorter lives. LED technology is useful for lighting designers, because of its low power consumption, low heat generation, instantaneous on/off control, and in the case of single color LEDs, continuity of color throughout the life of the diode and relatively low cost of manufacture. LED lifetime depends strongly on the temperature of the diode. Operating an LED lamp in conditions that increase the internal temperature can greatly shorten the lamp&#x27;s life. Some lasers have been adapted as an alternative to LEDs to provide highly focused illumination.

=== Carbon arc ===

Carbon arc lamps consist of two carbon rod electrodes in open air, supplied by a current-limiting ballast. The electric arc is struck by touching the rod tips then separating them. The ensuing arc produces a white-hot plasma between the rod tips. These lamps have higher efficacy than filament lamps, but the carbon rods are short-lived and require constant adjustment in use, as the intense heat of the arc erodes them. The lamps produce significant ultraviolet output, they require ventilation when used indoors, and due to their intensity they need protection from direct sight.

Invented by Humphry Davy around 1805, the carbon arc was the first practical electric light. It was used commercially beginning in the 1870s for large building and street lighting until it was superseded in the early 20th century by the incandescent light. Carbon arc lamps operate at high power and produce high intensity white light. They also are a point source of light. They remained in use in limited applications that required these properties, such as movie projectors, stage lighting, and searchlights, until after World War II.

=== Discharge ===

A discharge lamp has a glass or silica envelope containing two metal electrodes separated by a gas. Gases used include, neon, argon, xenon, sodium, metal halides, and mercury. The core operating principle is much the same as the carbon arc lamp, but the term &quot;arc lamp&quot; normally refers to carbon arc lamps, with more modern types of gas discharge lamp normally called discharge lamps. With some discharge lamps, very high voltage is used to strike the arc. This requires an electrical circuit called an igniter, which is part of the electrical ballast circuitry. After the arc is struck, the internal resistance of the lamp drops to a low level, and the ballast limits the current to the operating current. Without a ballast, excess current would flow, causing rapid destruction of the lamp.

Some lamp types contain a small amount of neon, which permits striking at normal running voltage with no external ignition circuitry. Low-pressure sodium lamps operate this way. The simplest ballasts are just an inductor, and are chosen where cost is the deciding factor, such as street lighting. More advanced electronic ballasts may be designed to maintain constant light output over the life of the lamp, may drive the lamp with a square wave to maintain completely flicker-free output, and shut down in the event of certain faults.

The most efficient source of electric light is the low-pressure sodium lamp. It produces, for all practical purposes, a monochromatic orange-yellow light, which gives a similarly monochromatic perception of any illuminated scene. For this reason, it is generally reserved for outdoor public lighting applications. Low-pressure sodium lights are favoured for public lighting by astronomers, since the light pollution that they generate can be easily filtered, contrary to broadband or continuous spectra.

== Characteristics ==

=== Form factor ===

Many lamp units, or light bulbs, are specified in standardized shape codes and socket names. Incandescent bulbs and their retrofit replacements are often specified as &quot;A19/A60 E26/E27&quot;, a common size for those kinds of light bulbs. In this example, the &quot;A&quot; parameters describe the bulb size and shape within the A-series light bulb while the &quot;E&quot; parameters describe the Edison screw base size and thread characteristics.

=== Comparison parameters ===
Common comparison parameters include:
* Luminous flux (in lumens)
* Energy consumption (in watts)
* Luminous efficacy (in lumens per watt)
* Color temperature (in kelvins)
Less common parameters include color rendering index (CRI).

=== Life expectancy ===
Life expectancy for many types of lamp is defined as the number of hours of operation at which 50% of them fail, that is the median life of the lamps. Production tolerances as low as 1% can create a variance of 25% in lamp life, so in general some lamps will fail well before the rated life expectancy, and some will last much longer. For LEDs, lamp life is defined as the operation time at which 50% of lamps have experienced a 70% decrease in light output. In the 1900s the Phoebus cartel formed in an attempt to reduce the life of electric light bulbs, an example of planned obsolescence.

Some types of lamp are also sensitive to switching cycles. Rooms with frequent switching, such as bathrooms, can expect much shorter lamp life than what is printed on the box. Compact fluorescent lamps are particularly sensitive to switching cycles.

== Uses ==

The total amount of artificial light (especially from street light) is sufficient for cities to be easily visible at night from the air, and from space. External lighting grew at a rate of 3–6 percent for the later half of the 20th century and is the major source of light pollution that burdens astronomers and others with 80% of the world&#x27;s population living in areas with night time light pollution. Light pollution has been shown to have a negative effect on some wildlife.

Electric lamps can be used as heat sources, for example in incubators, as infrared lamps in fast food restaurants and toys such as the Kenner Easy-Bake Oven.

Lamps can also be used for light therapy to deal with such issues as vitamin D deficiency, skin conditions such as acne and dermatitis, skin cancers, and seasonal affective disorder. Lamps which emit a specific frequency of blue light are also used to treat neonatal jaundice with the treatment which was initially undertaken in hospitals being able to be conducted at home.

Electric lamps can also be used as a grow light to aid in plant growth especially in indoor hydroponics and aquatic plants with recent research into the most effective types of light for plant growth.

Due to their nonlinear resistance characteristics, tungsten filament lamps have long been used as fast-acting thermistors in electronic circuits. Popular uses have included:
* Stabilization of sine wave oscillators
* Protection of tweeters in loudspeaker enclosures; excess current that is too high for the tweeter illuminates the light rather than destroying the tweeter.
* Automatic volume control in telephones

== Cultural symbolism ==
In Western culture, a lightbulb — in particular, the appearance of an illuminated lightbulb above a person&#x27;s head — signifies sudden inspiration.

A stylized depiction of a light bulb features as the logo of the Turkish AK Party.

<text>Edgar Rice Burroughs (September 1, 1875 – March 19, 1950) was an American writer, best known for his prolific output in the adventure, science fiction, and fantasy genres. Best known for creating the characters Tarzan (who appeared in a series of twenty-four books by him) and John Carter (who was a recurring character in a series of eleven books), he also wrote the &quot;Pellucidar&quot; series, the &quot;Amtor&quot; series, and the &quot;Caspak&quot; trilogy.

Tarzan was immediately popular, and Burroughs capitalized on it in every possible way, including a syndicated Tarzan comic strip, films, and merchandise. Tarzan remains one of the most successful fictional characters to this day and is a cultural icon. Burroughs&#x27;s California ranch is now the center of the Tarzana neighborhood in Los Angeles, named after the character. Burroughs was an explicit supporter of eugenics and scientific racism in both his fiction and nonfiction; Tarzan was meant to reflect these concepts.

==Biography==
===Early life and family===
Burroughs was born on September 1, 1875, in Chicago, Illinois, the fourth son of Major George Tyler Burroughs, a businessman and Civil War veteran, and his wife, Mary Evaline (Zieger) Burroughs. Edgar&#x27;s middle name is from his paternal grandmother, Mary Coleman Rice Burroughs.

Burroughs was of English and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry, with a family line that had been in North America since the Colonial era. Through his Rice grandmother, Burroughs was descended from settler Edmund Rice, one of the English Puritans who moved to Massachusetts Bay Colony in the early 17th century. He once remarked: &quot;I can trace my ancestry back to Deacon Edmund Rice.&quot; The Burroughs side of the family was also of English origin, having emigrated to Massachusetts around the same time. Many of his ancestors fought in the American Revolution. Some of his ancestors settled in Virginia during the colonial period, and Burroughs often emphasized his connection with that side of his family, seeing it as romantic and warlike.

Burroughs was educated at a number of local schools then at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, and then the Michigan Military Academy. He graduated in 1895, but he failed the entrance exam for the United States Military Academy at West Point, so instead he enlisted with the 7th U.S. Cavalry in Fort Grant, Arizona Territory. However, he was diagnosed with a heart problem and thus ineligible to serve, so he was discharged in 1897.

After his discharge, Burroughs worked at a number of different jobs. During the Chicago influenza epidemic of 1891, he spent half a year at his brother&#x27;s ranch on the Raft River in Idaho as a cowboy. He drifted afterward, then worked at his father&#x27;s Chicago battery factory in 1899. He married his childhood sweetheart, Emma Hulbert (1876–1944), in January 1900.

In 1903, Burroughs joined his brothers, Yale graduates George and Harry, who were, by then, prominent Pocatello area ranchers in southern Idaho, and partners in the Sweetser-Burroughs Mining Company, where he took on managing their ill-fated Snake River gold dredge, a classic bucket-line dredge. The Burroughs brothers were also the sixth cousins, once removed, of famed miner Kate Rice who, in 1914, became the first female prospector in the Canadian North. Journalist and publisher C. Allen Thorndike Rice was also his third cousin.

When the new mine proved unsuccessful, the brothers secured for Burroughs a position with the Oregon Short Line Railroad in Salt Lake City. Burroughs resigned from the railroad in October 1904.

===Later life===
By 1911, around age 36, after seven years of low wages as a pencil-sharpener wholesaler, Burroughs began to write fiction. By this time, Emma and he had two children, Joan (1908–1972), and Hulbert (1909–1991). During this period, he had copious spare time and began reading pulp-fiction magazines. In 1929, he recalled thinking that:

In 1913, Burroughs and Emma had their third and last child, John Coleman Burroughs (1913–1979), later known for his illustrations of his father&#x27;s books.

In the 1920s, Burroughs became a pilot, purchased a Security Airster S-1, and encouraged his family to learn to fly.

Daughter Joan married &quot;Tarzan&quot; film actor James Pierce. She starred with her husband as the voice of &quot;Jane&quot;, during 1932–1934 for the &quot;Tarzan&quot; radio series.

Burroughs divorced Emma in 1934, and, in 1935, married the former actress Florence Gilbert Dearholt, who was the former wife of his friend (who was then himself remarrying), Ashton Dearholt, with whom he had co-founded Burroughs-Tarzan Enterprises while filming &quot;The New Adventures of Tarzan&quot;. Burroughs adopted the Dearholts&#x27; two children. He and Florence divorced in 1942.

Burroughs was in his late 60s and was in Honolulu at the time of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Despite his age, he applied for and received permission to become a war correspondent, becoming one of the oldest U.S. war correspondents during World War II. This period of his life is mentioned in William Brinkley&#x27;s bestselling novel &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Near the Water&quot;.

===Death===
After the war ended, Burroughs moved back to Encino, California, where after many health problems, he died of a heart attack on March 19, 1950, having written almost 80 novels. He is buried in Tarzana, California, US.

At the time of his death he was believed to have been the writer who had made the most from films, earning over US$2 million in royalties from 27 Tarzan pictures.

The Science Fiction Hall of Fame inducted Burroughs in 2003.

==Literary career==
Aiming his work at the pulps—under the name &quot;Norman Bean&quot; to protect his reputation—Burroughs had his first story, &quot;Under the Moons of Mars&quot;, serialized by Frank Munsey in the February to July 1912 issues of &quot;The All-Story&quot;. &quot;Under the Moons of Mars&quot; inaugurated the &quot;Barsoom&quot; series, introduced John Carter, and earned Burroughs US$400 ($11,922 today). It was first published as a book by A. C. McClurg of Chicago in 1917, entitled &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot;, after three Barsoom sequels had appeared as serials and McClurg had published the first four serial Tarzan novels as books.

Burroughs soon took up writing full-time, and by the time the run of &quot;Under the Moons of Mars&quot; had finished, he had completed two novels, including &quot;Tarzan of the Apes&quot;, published from October 1912 and one of his most successful series.

Burroughs also wrote popular science fiction and fantasy stories involving adventurers from Earth transported to various planets (notably Barsoom, Burroughs&#x27;s fictional name for Mars, and Amtor, his fictional name for Venus), lost islands (Caspak), and into the interior of the Hollow Earth in his &quot;Pellucidar&quot; stories. He also wrote Westerns and historical romances. Besides those published in &quot;All-Story&quot;, many of his stories were published in &quot;The Argosy&quot; magazine.

Tarzan was a cultural sensation when introduced. Burroughs was determined to capitalize on Tarzan&#x27;s popularity in every way possible. He planned to exploit Tarzan through several different media including a syndicated Tarzan comic strip, movies, and merchandise. Experts in the field advised against this course of action, stating that the different media would just end up competing against each other. Burroughs went ahead, however, and proved the experts wrong – the public wanted Tarzan in whatever fashion he was offered. Tarzan remains one of the most successful fictional characters to this day and is a cultural icon.

In either 1915 or 1919, Burroughs purchased a large ranch north of Los Angeles, California, which he named &quot;Tarzana&quot;. The citizens of the community that sprang up around the ranch voted to adopt that name when their community, Tarzana, California, was formed in 1927. Also, the unincorporated community of Tarzan, Texas, was formally named in 1927 when the US Postal Service accepted the name, reputedly coming from the popularity of the first (silent) &quot;Tarzan of the Apes&quot; film, starring Elmo Lincoln, and an early &quot;Tarzan&quot; comic strip.

In 1923, Burroughs set up his own company, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc., and began printing his own books through the 1930s.

==Reception==
Because of the part Burroughs&#x27;s science fiction played in inspiring real exploration of Mars, an impact crater on Mars was named in his honor after his death. In a &quot;Paris Review&quot; interview, Ray Bradbury said of Burroughs: 

In &quot;Something of Myself&quot; (published posthumously in 1937) Rudyard Kipling wrote: &quot;My &quot;Jungle Books&quot; begat Zoos of [imitators]. But the genius of all the genii was one who wrote a series called &quot;Tarzan of the Apes&quot;. I read it, but regret I never saw it on the films, where it rages most successfully. He had &#x27;jazzed&#x27; the motif of the &quot;Jungle Books&quot; and, I imagine, had thoroughly enjoyed himself. He was reported to have said that he wanted to find out how bad a book he could write and &#x27;get away with&#x27;, which is a legitimate ambition.&quot;

By 1963, Floyd C. Gale of &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; wrote when discussing reprints of several Burroughs novels by Ace Books, &quot;an entire generation has grown up inexplicably Burroughs-less&quot;. He stated that most of the author&#x27;s books had been out of print for years and that only the &quot;occasional laughable Tarzan film&quot; reminded the public of his fiction. Gale reported his surprise that after two decades his books were again available, with Canaveral Press, Dover Publications, and Ballantine Books also reprinting them.

Few critical books have been written about Burroughs. From an academic standpoint, the most helpful are Erling Holtsmark&#x27;s two books: &quot;Tarzan and Tradition&quot; and &quot;Edgar Rice Burroughs&quot;; Stan Galloway&#x27;s &quot;The Teenage Tarzan: A Literary Analysis of Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27; &quot;Jungle Tales of Tarzan; and Richard Lupoff&#x27;s two books: &quot;Master of Adventure: Edgar Rice Burroughs&quot; and &quot;Barsoom: Edgar Rice Burroughs and the Martian Vision&quot;. Galloway was identified by James Edwin Gunn as &quot;one of the half-dozen finest Burroughs scholars in the world&quot;; Galloway called Holtsmark his &quot;most important predecessor&quot;.

Burroughs strongly supported eugenics and scientific racism. His views held that English nobles made up a particular heritable elite among Anglo-Saxons. Tarzan was meant to reflect this, with him being born to English nobles and then adopted by talking apes (the Mangani). They express eugenicist views themselves, but Tarzan is permitted to live despite being deemed &quot;unfit&quot; in comparison and grows up to surpass not only them but black Africans, whom Burroughs clearly presents as inherently inferior. In one Tarzan story, he finds an ancient civilization where eugenics has been practiced for over 2,000 years, with the result that it is free of all crime. Criminal behavior is held to be entirely hereditary, with the solution having been to kill not only criminals but also their families. &quot;Lost on Venus&quot;, a later novel, presents a similar utopia where forced sterilization is practiced and the &quot;unfit&quot; are killed. Burroughs explicitly supported such ideas in his unpublished nonfiction essay &quot;I See A New Race&quot;. Additionally, his &quot;Pirate Blood&quot;, which is not speculative fiction and remained unpublished after his death, portrayed the characters as victims of their hereditary criminal traits (one a descendant of the corsair Jean Lafitte, another from the Jukes family). These views have been compared with Nazi eugenics – though noting that they were popular and common at the time and that Burroughs expressed great contempt for Nazism and fascism – with his &quot;Lost on Venus&quot; being released the same year the Nazis took power (in 1933).

In 2003, Burroughs was inducted into the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame.

<doc id="9658" wikidata="Q272912" url="?curid=9658" title="Eugène Viollet-le-Duc">
<text>Eugène Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc (; 27 January 181417 September 1879) was a French architect and author, famous for his restoration of the most prominent medieval landmarks in France. His major restoration projects included Notre-Dame de Paris, the Basilica of Saint Denis, Mont Saint-Michel, Sainte-Chapelle, the medieval walls of the city of Carcassonne, and Roquetaillade castle in the Bordeaux region.

His writings on decoration and on the relationship between form and function in architecture had a fundamental influence on a whole new generation of architects, including all the major Art Nouveau artists: Antoni Gaudí, Victor Horta, Hector Guimard, Henry van de Velde, Henri Sauvage and the École de Nancy, Paul Hankar, Otto Wagner, Eugène Grasset, Émile Gallé, and Hendrik Petrus Berlage. He also influenced the first modern architects, Frank Lloyd Wright, Mies van der Rohe, Auguste Perret, Louis Sullivan, and Le Corbusier, who considered Viollet-le-Duc as the father of modern architecture. The English architect William Burges admitted in his late life &quot;We all cribbed on Viollet-le-Duc even though no one could read French&quot;.

His writings also influenced John Ruskin, William Morris, and the Arts and Crafts movement. At the International Exhibition of 1862 in London, the aesthetic works of Edward Burne-Jones, Christina Rossetti, Philip Webb, William Morris, Simeon Solomon, and Edward Poynter were directly influenced from drawings in Viollet-le-Duc&#x27;s Dictionary.

==Youth and education==

Viollet-le-Duc was born in Paris in 1814. His grandfather was an architect, and his father was a high-ranking civil servant, who in 1816 became the overseer of the royal residences of Louis XVIII. His uncle Étienne-Jean Delécluze was a painter, a former student of Jacques-Louis David, an art critic and hosted a literary salon, which was attended by Stendhal and Sainte-Beuve. His mother hosted her own salon, which women could attend as well as men. There, in 1822 or 1823, Eugène met Prosper Mérimée, a writer who would play a decisive role in his career.

In 1825 he began his education at the Pension Moran, in Fontenay-aux-Roses. He returned to Paris in 1829 as a student at the college de Bourbon (now the Lycée Condorcet). He passed his baccalaureate examination in 1830. His uncle urged him to enter the École des Beaux-Arts, which had been created in 1806, but the &quot;École &quot; had an extremely rigid system, based entirely on copying classical models, and Eugène was not interested. Instead he decided to get practical experience in the architectural offices of Jacques-Marie Huvé and Achille Leclère, while devoting much of his time to drawing medieval churches and monuments around Paris.

At sixteen he participated in the July 1830 revolution which overthrew Charles X, building a barricade. Following the revolution, which brought Louis Philippe to power, his father became chief of the bureau of royal residences. The new government created, for the first time, the position of Inspector General of Historic Monuments. Eugène&#x27;s uncle Delécluze agreed to take Eugène on a long tour of France to see monuments. They travelled from July to October 1831 throughout the south of France, and he returned with a large collection of detailed paintings and watercolours of churches and monuments.

On his return to Paris, he moved with his family into the Tuileries Palace, where his father was now governor of royal residences. His family again urged him to attend the École des Beaux-Arts, but he still refused. He wrote in his journal in December 1831, &quot;the &quot;École&quot; is just a mould for architects. they all come out practically identical.&quot; He was a talented and meticulous artist; he travelled around France to visit monuments, cathedrals, and other medieval architecture, made detailed drawings and watercolours. In 1834, at the age of twenty, he married Élisabeth Templier, and in the same year he was named an associate professor of ornamental decoration at the Royal School of Decorative Arts, which gave him a more regular income. His first pupils there included Léon Gaucherel.

With the money from the sale of his drawings and paintings, Viollet-le-Duc set off on a long tour of the monuments of Italy, visiting Rome, Venice, Florence and other sites, drawing and painting. In 1838, he presented several of his drawings at the Paris Salon, and began making a travel book, &quot;Picturesque and romantic images of the old France&quot;, for which, between 1838 and 1844, he made nearly three hundred engravings.

==First architectural restorations==
In October 1838, with the recommendation of Achille Leclère, the architect with whom he had trained, he was named deputy inspector of the enlargement of the Hôtel Soubise, the new home of the French National Archives. His uncle, Delécluze, then recommended him to the new Commission of Historic Monuments of France, led by Prosper Mérimée, who had just published a book on medieval French monuments. Though he was just twenty-four years old and had no degree in architecture, he was asked to go to Narbonne to propose a plan for the completion of the cathedral there. The project was rejected by the local authorities as too ambitious and too expensive.

His first real project was a restoration of the Vézelay Abbey, which many considered as impossible. The church had been sacked by the Huguenots in 1569, and during the French Revolution, the facade and statuary on the facade were destroyed. The vaults of the roof were weakened, and many of the stones had been carried off for other projects. When Mérimée visited to inspect the structure he heard stones falling around him. In February 1840 he gave Viollet-le-Duc the mission of restoring and reconstructing the church so it would not collapse, while &quot;respecting exactly in his project of restoration all the ancient dispositions of the church&quot;.

The task was all the more difficult because up until that time no scientific studies had been made of medieval building techniques, and there were no schools of restoration. He had no plans for the original building to work from. Viollet-le-Duc had to discover the flaws of construction that had caused the building to start to collapse in the first place and to construct a more solid and stable structure. He lightened the roof and built new arches to stabilize the structure, and slightly changed the shape of the vaults and arches. He was criticized for these modifications in the 1960s, though, as his defenders pointed out, without them the roof would have collapsed under its own weight. Mérimée&#x27;s deputy, Lenormant, inspected the construction and reported to Mérimée: &quot;The young Leduc seems entirely worthy of your confidence. He needed a magnificent audacity to take charge of such a desperate enterprise; it&#x27;s certain that he arrived just in time, and if we had waited only ten years the church would have been a pile of stones.&quot; This restoration work lasted 19 years.

==Sainte-Chapelle and Amboise==
Viollet-le-Duc&#x27;s success at Vezelay led to a large series of projects. In 1840, in collaboration with his friend the architect Jean-Baptiste Lassus he began the restoration of Sainte-Chapelle in Paris, which had been turned into a storage depot after the Revolution. In February 1843, King Louis Philippe sent him to the Château of Amboise, to restore the stained glass windows in the chapel holding the tomb of Leonardo da Vinci. The windows were unfortunately destroyed in 1940 during World War II.

In 1843, Mérimée took Viollet-le-Duc with him to Burgundy and the south of France, on one of his long inspection tours of monuments. Viollet-le-Duc made drawings of the buildings and wrote detailed accounts of each site, illustrated with his drawing, which were published in architectural journals. With his experience he became the most prominent academic scholar on French medieval architecture and his medieval dictionnary, with over 4000 drawings, contains the largest iconography on the subject to this day.

==Notre-Dame de Paris==
In 1844, with the backing of Mérimée, Viollet-le-Duc, just thirty years old, and Lassus, then thirty-seven, won a competition for the restoration of Notre-Dame Cathedral which lasted twenty-five years. Their project involved primarily the facade, where many of the statues over the portals had been beheaded or smashed during the Revolution. They proposed two major changes to the interior: rebuilding two of the bays to their original medieval height of four storeys, and removing the marble neoclassical structures and decoration which had been added to the choir during the reign of Louis XIV. Mérimée warned them to be careful: &quot;In such a project, one cannot act with too much prudence or discretion...A restoration may be more disastrous for a monument than the ravages of centuries.&quot; The Commission on Historical Monuments approved most of Viollet-le-Duc&#x27;s plans, but rejected his proposal to remove the choir built under Louis XIV. Viollet-le-Duc himself turned down a proposal to add two new spires atop the towers, arguing that such a monument &quot;would be remarkable but would not be Notre-Dame de Paris&quot;. Instead, he proposed to rebuild the original medieval spire and bell tower over the transept, which had been removed in 1786 because it was unstable in the wind.

Once the project was approved, Viollet-le-Duc made drawings and photographs of the existing decorative elements; then they were removed and a stream of sculptors began making new statues of saints, gargoyles, chimeras and other architectural elements in a workshop he established, working from his drawings and photographs of similar works in other cathedrals of the same period. He also designed a new treasury in the Gothic style to serve as the museum of the cathedral, replacing the residence of the Archbishop, which had been destroyed in a riot in 1831.

The bells in the two towers had been taken out in 1791 and melted down to make cannons. Viollet-le-Duc had new bells cast for the north tower and a new structure built inside to support them. Viollet-le-Duc and Lassus also rebuilt the sacristy, on the south side of the church, which had been built in 1756, but had been burned by rioters during the July Revolution of 1830. The new spire was completed, taller and more strongly built to withstand the weather; it was decorated with statues of the apostles, and the face of Saint Thomas, patron saint of architects, bore a noticeable resemblance to Viollet-le-Duc. The spire was destroyed on 15 April 2019, as a result of the Notre-Dame de Paris fire.

==Saint-Denis and Amiens==
When not engaged in Paris, Viollet-le-Duc continued his long tours into the French provinces, inspecting and checking the progress of more than twenty different restoration projects that were under his control, including seven in Burgundy alone. New projects included the Basilica of Saint-Sernin, Toulouse, and the Basilica of Saint-Denis just outside Paris. Saint-Denis had undergone a restoration by a different architect, Francois Debret, who had rebuilt one of the two towers. However, in 1846, the new tower, overloaded with masonry, began to crack, and Viollet-le-Duc was called in. He found no way the building could be saved and had to oversee the demolition of the tower, saving the stones. He concentrated on restoring the interior of the church, and was able to restore the original burial chamber of the kings of France.

In May 1849, he was named the architect for the restoration of Amiens Cathedral, one of the largest in France, which had been built over many centuries in a variety of different styles. He wrote, &quot;his goal should be to save in each part of the monument its own character, and yet to make it so that the united parts don&#x27;t conflict with each other; and that can be maintained in a state that is durable and simple.&quot;

==Imperial projects: Carcassonne, Vincennes and Pierrefonds==
The French coup d&#x27;état of 1851 brought Napoleon III to power and transformed France from a republic to an empire. The coup accelerated some of Viollet-le-Duc&#x27;s projects as his patron Prosper Mérimée had introduced him to the new Emperor. He moved forward with the slow work of restoration of the Cathedral of Reims and Cathedral of Amiens. In Amiens, he cleared the interior of the French classical decoration added under Louis XIV, and proposed to make it resolutely Gothic. He gave the Emperor a tour of his project in September 1853; the Empress immediately offered to pay two-thirds of the cost of the restoration. In the same year he undertook the restoration of the Château de Vincennes, long occupied by the military, along with its chapel, similar to Sainte-Chapelle. A devotee of the pure Gothic, he described the chapel as &quot;one of the finest specimens of Gothic in decline&quot;.

In November 1853, he provided the costs and plans for the medieval ramparts of Carcassonne which he had first begun planning in 1849. The first fortifications had been built by the Visigoths; on top of these, in the Middle Ages Louis XI and then Philip the Bold had built a formidable series of towers, galleries, walls, gates and interlocking defences that resisted all sieges until 1355. The fortifications were largely intact, since the surroundings of the city were still a military defensive zone in the 19th century, but the towers were without tops and a large number of structures had been built up against the old walls. Once he obtained funding and made his plans, he began demolishing all structures which had been added to the ramparts over the centuries, and restored the gates, walls and towers to their original form, including the defence platforms, roofs on the towers and shelters for archers that would have been used during a siege. He found many of the original mountings for weapons still in place. To accompany his work, he published a detailed history of the city and its fortifications, with his drawings. Carcassonne became the best example of medieval military architecture in France, and also an important tourist attraction.

Napoleon III provided additional funding for the continued restoration of Notre-Dame. Viollet-le-Duc was also to replace the great bestiary of mythical beasts and animals which had decorated the cathedral in the 18th century. In 1856, using examples from other medieval churches and debris from Notre-Dame as his model, his workshop produced dragons, chimeras, grotesques, and gargoyles, as well as an assortment of picturesque pinnacles and fleurons. He engaged in a new project for restoration of the Cathedral of Clermont-Ferrand, a project which continued for ten years. He also undertook an unusual project for Napoleon III; the design and construction of six railway coaches with neo-Gothic interior décor for the Emperor and his entourage. Two of the cars still exist; the salon of honour car, with a fresco on the ceiling, is at the Château de Compiègne, and the dining car, with a massive golden eagle as the centrepiece of the décor, is at the Railroad Museum of Mulhouse.

Napoleon III asked Viollet-le-Duc if he could restore a medieval chateau for the Emperor&#x27;s own use near Compiègne, where the Emperor traditionally passed September and October. Viollet-le-Duc first studied a restoration of the Château de Coucy, which had the highest medieval tower in France. When this proved too complicated, he settled upon Château de Pierrefonds, a castle begun by Louis of Orleans in 1396, then dismantled in 1617 after several sieges by Louis XIII of France. Napoleon bought the ruin for 5000 francs in 1812, and Mérimée declared it an historic monument in 1848. In 1857 Viollet-le-Duc began designing an entirely new chateau on the ruins. This structure was not designed to recreate anything exactly that had existed, but a castle which recaptured the spirit of the Gothic, with lavish neo-Gothic decoration and 19th-century comforts. Pierrefonds and its inside decorations would not only influence William Burges and his Cardiff and Coch castles but also the castles of Ludwig II of Bavaria (Neuschwanstein Castle) and the Haut-Kœnigsbourg of the Emperor Wilhelm II.

While most of his attention was devoted to restorations, Viollet-le-Duc designed and built a number of private residences and new buildings in Paris. He also participated in the most important competition of the period, for the new Paris Opera. There were one hundred seventy-one projects proposed in the original competition, presented the 1855 Paris Universal Exposition. A jury of noted architects narrowed it down to five, including projects from Viollet-le-Duc and Charles Garnier, age thirty-five. Viollet-le-Duc was finally eliminated and this put an end to Viollet le Duc&#x27;s wish to construct public buildings. Napoleon III also called upon Viollet-le-Duc for a wide variety of archeological and architectural tasks. When he wished to put up a monument to mark the Battle of Alesia, where Julius Caesar defeated the Gauls, a siege whose actual site was disputed by historians, he asked Viollet-le-Duc to locate the exact battlefield. Viollet-le-Duc conducted excavations at various purported sites, and finally found vestiges of the walls built at the time. He also designed the metal frame for the six-metre-high statue of the Gallic chief Vercingétorix that would be placed on the site. He later designed a similar frame for a much larger statue, the Statue of Liberty, but died before that statue was finished.

==End of the Empire and of Restoration==
In 1863, Viollet-le-Duc was named a professor at the École des Beaux-Arts, the school where he had refused to become a student. In the fortress of neoclassical Beaux-Arts architecture there was much resistance against him, but he attracted two hundred students to his course, who applauded his lecture at the end. But while he had many supporters, the faculty professors and certain students campaigned against him. His critics complained that, aside from having little formal architectural training himself, he had only built a handful of new buildings. He tired of the confrontations and resigned on 16 May 1863, and continued his writing and teaching outside the Beaux-Arts. In response to the Beaux-Arts he initiated the creation of the École Spéciale d&#x27;Architecture in Paris in 1865.

In the beginning of 1864, he celebrated the conclusion of his most important project, the restoration of Notre-Dame. In January of the same year he completed the first phase of the restoration of the Cathedral of Saint Sernin in Toulouse, one of the landmarks of French Romanesque architecture. Napoleon III invited Viollet-le-Duc to study possible restorations overseas, including in Algeria, Corsica, and in Mexico, where Napoleon had installed a new Emperor, Maximilian, under French sponsorship. He also saw the consecration of the third church that he had designed, the neo-Gothic church of Saint-Denis de l&#x27;Estree, in the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis. Between 1866 and 1870, his major project was the ongoing transformation of Pierrefonds from a ruin into a royal residence. His plans for the metal framework he had designed for Pierrefonds were displayed at the Paris Universal Exposition of 1867. He also began a new area of study, researching the geology and geography of the region around Mont Blanc in the Alps. While on his mapping excursion in the Alps in July 1870, he learned that war had been declared between Prussia and France.

As the Franco-Prussian War commenced, Viollet-le-Duc hurried back to Paris, and offered his services as a military engineer; he was put into service as a colonel of engineers, preparing the defenses of Paris. In September, the Emperor was captured at the Battle of Sedan, a new Republican government took power, and the Empress Eugénie fled into exile, as Germans marched as far as Paris and put it under siege. At the same time, on September 23, Viollet-le-Duc&#x27;s primary patron and supporter, Prosper Mérimée, died peacefully in the south of France. Viollet-le-Duc supervised the construction of new defensive works outside Paris. The war was a disaster as he wrote in his journal on the 14th December 1870: &quot;Disorganization is everywhere. The officers have no confidence in the troops, and the troops have no confidence in the officers. Each day, new orders and new projects which contravene those of the day before.&quot; He fought with the French army against the Germans at Buzenval on 24 January 1871. The battle was lost, and the French capitulated on 28 January. Viollet-le-Duc wrote to his wife on February 28, &quot;I don&#x27;t know what will become of me, but I do not want to return any more to administration. I am disgusted by it forever, and want nothing more than to pass the years that remain to me in study and in the most modest possible life.&quot; Always the scholar, he wrote a detailed study of the effectiveness and deficiencies of the fortifications of Paris during the siege, which was to be used for the 1917 defense of Verdun and the construction of the Maginot line in 1938.

In May 1871 he left his home in Paris just before national guardsmen arrived to draft him into the armed force of the Paris Commune who subsequently condemned him to death. He escaped to Pierrefonds, where he had a small apartment before going in exile in Lausanne, where he engage in his passion for mountains, making detailed maps and a series of thirty-two drawings of the alpine scenery. While in Lausanne he was also asked to undertake the restoration of the cathedral.

He returned later to Paris after the Commune had been suppressed and saw the ruins of most of the public buildings of the city, burned by the Commune in its last days. He received his only commission from the new government of the French Third Republic; Jules Simon, the new Minister of Culture and Public Instruction, asked him to design a plaque to be placed before Notre-Dame to honor the hostages killed by the Paris Commune in its final days.

The new government of the French Third Republic made little use of his expertise in the restoration of the major government buildings which had been burned by the Paris Commune, including the Tuileries Palace, the Palace of the Legion of Honor, the Palais-Royal, the library of the Louvre, the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Finance. The only reconstruction on which he was consulted was that of the Hotel de Ville. The writer Edmond de Goncourt called for leaving the ruin of the Hotel de Ville exactly as it was, &quot;a ruin of a magical palace, A marvel of the picturesque. The country should not condemn it without appeal to restoration by Viollet-le-Duc.&quot; The government asked Viollet-le-Duc to organize a competition. He presented two options; to either restore the building to its original state, with its historic interior; or to demolish it and build a new city hall. In July 1872 the government decided to preserve the Renaissance facade, but otherwise to completely demolish and rebuild the building.

==Author and theorist==
Throughout his life Viollet le Duc wrote over 100 publications on architecture, decoration, history, archeology etc... some of which would become international best-sellers: &quot;Dictionary of French Architecture from 11th to 16th Century&quot; (1854–1868), &quot;Entretiens sur l&#x27;architecture&quot; (1863–1872), &quot;L&#x27;histoire d&#x27;une Maison&quot; (1873) and &quot;Histoire d&#x27;un Dessinateur: Comment on Apprend à Dessiner&quot; (1879).

In his &quot;Entretiens sur l&#x27;architecture&quot; he concentrated in particular on the use of iron and other new materials, and the importance of designing buildings whose architecture was adapted to their function, rather than to a particular style. The book was translated into English in 1881 and won a large following in the United States. The Chicago architect Louis Sullivan, one of the inventors of the skyscraper, often invoked the phrase, &quot;Form follows function.&quot;

Lausanne Cathedral was his final major restoration project; it was rebuilt following his plans between 1873 and 1876. Work continued after his death. His reconstruction of the bell tower was later criticized; he eliminated the original octagonal base and added a new spire, which rested on the walls, and not on the vaulting, like the original spire. He also added new decoration, crowning the spire at mid-height with gables, another original element, and removing the original tiles. He was also criticized for the materials and ornaments he added to the towers, including gargoyles. His structural design was preserved, but in 1925 his gargoyles and original ornamentation were removed, and the spire was recovered with tiles.

His reputation had reached outside of France. The spire and roof of Strasbourg Cathedral had been damaged by German artillery during the Franco-Prussian War, and the city was now part of Germany. The German government invited Viollet-le-Duc to comment on their plans for the restoration, which involved a more grandiose Romanesque tower. Viollet-le-Duc informed the German architect that the planned new tower was completely out of character with the original facade and style of the cathedral. His advice was accepted, and the church was restored to its original form.

In 1872 Viollet-le-Duc was engaged in the reconstruction of the Château d&#x27;Amboise, owned by the descendants of the former King, Louis-Philippe. The chateau had been confiscated by Napoleon III in 1848 but was returned to the family in 1872. It was a massive project to turn it into a residence, involving at times three hundred workers. Viollet-le-Duc designed all the work to the finest details, including the floor tiles, the gas lights in the salons, the ovens in the kitchen, and the electric bells for summoning servants.

In 1874 Viollet-le-Duc resigned as diocesan architect of Paris and was succeeded by his contemporary, Paul Abadie. In his final years, he continued to supervise the restoration projects that were underway for the Commission of Historical Monuments. He engaged in polemics about architecture in the press, and was elected to the Paris municipal council.

==Statue of Liberty==
While planning the design and construction of the Statue of Liberty (&quot;Liberty Enlightening the World&quot;) sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi interested Viollet-le-Duc, his friend and mentor, in the project. As chief engineer, Viollet-le-Duc designed a brick pier within the statue, to which the skin would be anchored. After consultations with the metalwork foundry Gaget, Gauthier &amp; Co., Viollet-le-Duc chose the metal which would be used for the skin, copper sheets, and the method used to shape it, repoussé, in which the sheets were heated and then struck with wooden hammers. An advantage of this choice was that the entire statue would be light for its volume, as the copper need be only thick.

==National Museum of French Monuments and final years==
He became engaged in the planning and construction of the Paris Universal Exposition of 1878. He proposed to the Minister of Education, Jules Ferry, that the Trocadéro Palace, the main building of the Exposition on the hilltop of Chaillot, be transformed after the Exposition into a museum of French monuments, displaying models of architecture and sculpture from landmarks around France. This idea was accepted. The National Museum of French Monuments opened in 1882, after his death. The Palais was reconstructed into the Palais de Chaillot in 1937, but the Museum of French Monuments was preserved and can be seen there today.

In his final years his son Eugène-Louis became the head of the Commission of Historic Monuments. He took on just one new project, the restoration of the cloister of the Augustines at Toulouse. He completed his series of dictionaries of architectural periods, designed for a general audience. He also devoted more time to studying the geography of the Alps around Mont-Blanc. He spent his summers hiking in the mountains and writing articles about his travels. He launched a public campaign for the re-forestation of the Alps, and published a detailed map of the area in 1876. He spent more and more time at &quot;La Vedette&quot;, the villa he constructed in Lausanne, a house on the model of a Savoyard chalet, but with a minimum of decoration, illustrating his new doctrine of form following function. He made one last visit to inspect Carcassonne, whose work was now under his son&#x27;s direction. After an exhausting summer of hiking in the Alps in 1879, he became ill and died in Lausanne on 17 September 1879. He was buried in the cemetery of La Sallaz in Lausanne. In 1946 his grave and monument were transferred to the Cemetery of Bois-le-Vaux (Section XVIII) in Lausanne.

==Family==
Viollet-le-Duc married Elisabeth Tempier in Paris on 3 May 1834. The couple had two children, but separated a few years after marriage, and spent little time together; he was continually on the road. The writer Geneviève Viollet-le-Duc (winner of the prix Broquette-Gonin in 1978) was his great-granddaughter.

==Doctrine==
Viollet-le-Duc famously defined restoration in volume eight of his &quot;Dictionnaire raisonné de l&#x27;architecture française du XI au XVI siecle&quot; of 1858: &quot;To restore a building is not to maintain it, repair it or remake it: it is to re-establish it in a complete state which may never have existed at any given moment.&quot; He then explained that it had to meet four conditions: (1) The &quot;re-establishment&quot; had to be scientifically documented with plans and photographs and archeological records, which would guarantee exactness. (2) The restoration had to involve not just the appearance of the monument, or the effect that it produced, but also its structure; it had to use the most efficient means to assure the long life of the building, including using more solid materials, used more wisely. (3) the restoration had to exclude any modification contrary to obvious evidence; but the structure could be adapted to conform to more modern or rational uses and practices, which meant alterations to the original plan; and (4) The restoration should preserve older modifications made to the building, with the exception of those which compromised its stability or its conservation, or those which gravely violated the value of its historical presence.

He drew conclusions from medieval architecture that he applied to modern architecture. He noted that it was sometimes necessary to employ an iron frame in restoration to avoid the danger of fires, as long as the new structure was not heavier than the original, and kept the original balance of forces found in medieval structures. &quot;The monuments of the Middle Ages were carefully calculated, and their organism is delicate. There is nothing in excess in their works, nothing useless. If you change one of the conditions of these organisms, you change all the others. Many people consider this a fault; for us, this is a quality which we too often neglect in our modern construction...Why should we build expensive walls two meters thick, if walls fifty centimeters thick [with reinforced supports], offer sufficient stability? In the structure of the Middle Ages, every portion of a work fulfilled a function and possessed an action.&quot;

==Gothic vs. Beaux-Arts==
During the entire career of Viollet-le-Duc, he was engaged in a dispute with the doctrines of the École des Beaux-Arts, the leading architectural school of France, which he refused to attend as a student, and where he taught briefly as a professor, before being pressured to depart. In 1846 he engaged in a fervent exchange in print with Quatremère de Quincy, the Perpetual Secretary of the French Academy, on the question, &quot;Is it suitable, in the 19th century, to build churches in the Gothic style?&quot; De Quincy and his followers denounced the Gothic style as incoherent, disorderly, unintelligent, decadent and without taste. Viollet-le-Duc responded, &quot;What we want, &quot;messieurs&quot;, is the return of an art which was born in our country...Leave to Rome what belongs to Rome, and to Athens what belongs to Athens. Rome didn&#x27;t want our Gothic (and was perhaps the only one in Europe to reject it) and they were right, because when one has the good fortune to possess a national architecture, the best thing is to keep it.&quot;

&quot;If you study for a moment a church of the 13th century&quot;, he wrote, &quot;you see that all of the construction is carried out according to an invariable system. All the forces and the weights are thrust out to the exterior, a disposition which gives the interior the greatest open space possible. The flying buttresses and contreforts alone support the entire structure, and always have an aspect of resistance, of force and stability which reassures the eye and the spirit; The vaults, built with materials that are easy to mount and to place at a great height, are combined in an easy disposition that places the totality of their weight on the piles; that the most simple means are always employed...and that all the parts of these constructions, independent of each other, even as they rely on each other, present an elasticity and a lightness needed in a building of such great dimensions. We can still see (and this is only found in Gothic architecture) that human proportions are the one fixed rule.&quot;

==Controversy==
Viollet-le-Duc was often accused by certain critics, in his own time and later, of pursuing the spirit of the Gothic style in some of his restorations instead of strict historical accuracy. Many art historians also consider that the British architectural writer John Ruskin and William Morris were ferocious opponents of Viollet le Duc&#x27;s restorations. But Ruskin never criticised Viollet le Duc&#x27;s restoration work in itself, but criticised the principle of restoration itself. Indeed, at the beginning of his career Ruskin had a very radical opinion on restoration: &quot;a building should be looked after and if not it should be left to die&quot;. Viollet le Duc&#x27;s position on the subject was more nuanced: &quot;if a building has not been upkept it should be restored&quot;.

The existence of an opposition between Ruskin and Viollet le Duc on restoration is today questioned by new research based on Ruskin&#x27;s own writtings: &quot;there is no book on architecture which has everything correct apart from Viollet le Duc’s Dictionnary&quot;. And at the end of his life Ruskin expressed the regret that &quot;no one in England had done the work that Viollet le Duc had done in France&quot;.

Viollet-le-Duc&#x27;s restorations sometimes involved non-historical additions, either to assure the stability of the building, or sometimes simply to maintain the harmony of the design. The flèche or spire of Notre-Dame de Paris, which had been constructed in about 1250, was removed in 1786 after it was damaged by the wind. Viollet-le-Duc designed and constructed a new spire, ornamented with statuary, which was taller than the original and modified to resist the weather, but in harmony with the rest of the design. In the 19th and 20th century, his flèche was a target for critics.

He was also criticized later for his modifications of the choir of Notre-Dame, which had been rebuilt in the Louis XIV style during the reign of that king. Viollet-le-Duc took out the old choir, including the altar where Napoleon Bonaparte had been crowned Emperor and replaced them with a Gothic altar and decoration which he designed. When he modified the choir, he also constructed new bays with small Gothic rose windows modelled on those in the church of Chars, in the Oise Valley. Some historians condemned these restorations as non-historical invention. His defenders pointed out that Viollet-le-Duc did not make any decisions on the restoration of Notre-Dame by himself; all of his plans were approved by Prosper Mérimée, the Inspector of Historical Monuments, and by the Commission of historic monuments.

He was criticized for the abundance of Gothic gargoyles, chimeras, fleurons, and pinnacles which he added to Notre-Dame Cathedral. These decorations had existed in the Middle Ages but had largely been removed during the reign of Louis XIV. The last original gargoyles had been taken down in 1813. He modelled the new gargoyles and monsters on examples from other cathedrals of the period.

He was later criticized also for the stained glass windows he designed and had made for the chapels around the ground level of the cathedral, which feature intricate Gothic designs in grisaille, which allow more light into the church. The contemporary view of the controversy of his restoration is summarized on a descriptive panel near the altar of the cathedral: &quot;The great restoration, carried to fruition by Viollet-le-Duc following the death of Lassus, supplied new radiance to the cathedral – whatever reservations one might have about the choices that were made. The work of the nineteenth century is now as much a part of the architectural history of Notre-Dame as that undertaken in previous centuries.&quot;

The restoration of ramparts of Carcassonne was also criticized in the 20th century. His critics pointed out that the pointed caps of the towers he constructed were more typical of northern France, not the region where Carcassonne was located, near the Spanish border. Similarly he added roofs of northern slate tiles rather than southern clay tiles, a choice that has been reversed in more recent restorations. His critics also claimed that Viollet-le-Duc sought a &quot;condition of completeness&quot; which never actually existed at any given time.
The principal counter-argument made by Viollet-le-Duc&#x27;s defenders was that, without his prompt restorations, many of the buildings that he restored would have been lost, and that he did the best that he could with the knowledge that was then available.

Mortimer Wheeler&#x27;s entry on English archaeologist Charles R Peers for the Dictionary of National Biography (1971) is worth quoting for its critique of Viollet-le-Duc:
“he [Peers] laid down the principles which have governed architectural conservation in the United Kingdom and have served as a model in other parts of the world. His cardinal principle was to retain but not to restore the surviving remains of an ancient structure; and in this respect he departed emphatically from the tradition of Viollet-le-Duc and his successors in France and Italy, where exuberant restoration frequently obscured the evidence upon which it was based ...”

==Restorations by Viollet-le-Duc==
==Publications==

Throughout his career Viollet-le-Duc made notes and drawings, not only for the buildings he was working on but also on Romanesque, Gothic and Renaissance buildings that were to be soon demolished. His notes were useful when preparing his published works. His study of medieval and Renaissance periods was not limited to architecture but extended also to such areas as furniture, clothing, musical instruments, armament, and geology.

His work was published, first in serial form, and then as full-scale books, as:

* &quot;Dictionary of French Architecture from 11th to 16th Century&quot; (1854–1868) (&quot;Dictionnaire raisonné de l&#x27;architecture française du XIe au XVIe siècle&quot;) – Original language edition, including numerous illustrations.
* &quot;Dictionary of French Furnishings&quot; (1858–1870) (&quot;Dictionnaire raisonné du mobilier français de l&#x27;époque Carolingienne à la Renaissance.&quot;)
* &quot;Cités et ruines américaines Mitla, Palenqué, Izamal, Chichen-Itza, Uxmal&quot; (1863)
* &quot;Entretiens sur l&#x27;architecture&quot; (in 2 volumes, 1863–1872), in which Viollet-le-Duc systematized his approach to architecture and architectural education, in a system radically opposed to that of the &quot;École des Beaux-Arts&quot;, which he had avoided in his youth and despised. Henry Van Brunt&#x27;s translation, &quot;Discourses on Architecture&quot;, was published in 1875, making it available to an American audience little more than a decade after its initial publication in France.
* &quot;Histoire de l&#x27;habitation humaine, depuis les temps préhistoriques jusqu&#x27;à nos jours&quot; (1875). Published in English in 1876 as &quot;Habitations of Man in All Ages&quot;. Viollet-Le-Duc traces the history of domestic architecture among the different &quot;races&quot; of mankind.
* &quot;L&#x27;art russe: ses origines, ses éléments constructifs, son apogée, son avenir&quot; (1877), where Viollet-le-Duc applied his ideas of rational construction to Russian architecture.
* &quot;Histoire d&#x27;un Dessinateur: Comment on Apprend à Dessiner&quot; (1879)

==Architectural theory and new building projects==
Viollet-le-Duc is considered by many to be the first theorist of modern architecture. Sir John Summerson wrote that &quot;there have been two supremely eminent theorists in the history of European architecture – Leon Battista Alberti and Eugène Viollet-le-Duc.&quot;

His architectural theory was largely based on finding the ideal forms for specific materials and using these forms to create buildings. His writings centered on the idea that materials should be used &quot;honestly&quot;. He believed that the outward appearance of a building should reflect the rational construction of the building. In &quot;Entretiens sur l&#x27;architecture&quot;, Viollet-le-Duc praised the Greek temple for its rational representation of its construction. For him, &quot;Greek architecture served as a model for the correspondence of structure and appearance.&quot;

Another component in Viollet-le-Duc&#x27;s theory was how the design of a building should start from its program and the plan, and end with its decorations. If this resulted in an asymmetrical exterior, so be it. He dismissed the symmetry of classicist buildings as vain, caring too much about appearances at the expense of practicality and convenience for the inhabitants of the house.

In several unbuilt projects for new buildings, Viollet-le-Duc applied the lessons he had derived from Gothic architecture, applying its rational structural systems to modern building materials such as cast iron. For inspiration, he also examined organic structures, such as leaves and animal skeletons. He was especially interested in the wings of bats, an influence represented by his Assembly Hall project.

Viollet-le-Duc&#x27;s drawings of iron trusswork were innovative for the time. Many of his designs emphasizing iron would later influence the Art Nouveau movement, most noticeably in the work of Hector Guimard, Victor Horta, Antoni Gaudí and Hendrik Petrus Berlage. His writings inspired several American architects, including Frank Furness, John Wellborn Root, Louis Sullivan, and Frank Lloyd Wright.

==Military career and influence==
Viollet-le-Duc had a second career in the military, primarily in the defense of Paris during the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71). He was so influenced by the conflict that during his later years he described the idealized defense of France by the analogy of the military history of Le Roche-Pont, an imaginary castle, in his work &quot;Histoire d&#x27;une Forteresse&quot; (&quot;Annals of a Fortress&quot;, twice translated into English). Accessible and well researched, it is partly fictional.

&quot;Annals of a Fortress&quot; strongly influenced French military defensive thinking. Viollet-le-Duc&#x27;s critique of the effect of artillery (applying his practical knowledge from the 1870–1871 war) is so complete that it accurately describes the principles applied to the defense of France until World War II. The physical results of his theories are present in the fortification of Verdun prior to World War I and the Maginot Line prior to World War II. His theories are also represented by the French military theory of &quot;Deliberate Advance&quot;, which stresses that artillery and a strong system of fortresses in the rear of an army are essential.

==Legacy==
The English architect Benjamin Bucknall (1833–1895) was a devotee of Viollet-le-Duc and during 1874 to 1881 translated several of his publications into English to popularise his principles in Great Britain. The later works of the English designer and architect William Burges were greatly influenced by Viollet-le-Duc, most strongly in Burges&#x27;s designs for his own home, The Tower House in London&#x27;s Holland Park district, and Burges&#x27;s designs for Castell Coch near Cardiff, Wales.

An exhibition, &quot;Eugène Viollet-le-Duc 1814–1879&quot; was presented in Paris in 1965, and there was a larger, centennial exhibition in 1980.

Viollet-le-Duc was the subject of a Google Doodle on January 27, 2014.

<doc id="9659" wikidata="Q82504" url="?curid=9659" title="Endocarditis">
<text>Endocarditis is an inflammation of the inner layer of the heart, the endocardium. It usually involves the heart valves. Other structures that may be involved include the interventricular septum, the chordae tendineae, the mural endocardium, or the surfaces of intracardiac devices. Endocarditis is characterized by lesions, known as &quot;vegetations&quot;, which are masses of platelets, fibrin, microcolonies of microorganisms, and scant inflammatory cells. In the subacute form of infective endocarditis, a vegetation may also include a center of granulomatous tissue, which may fibrose or calcify.

There are several ways to classify endocarditis. The simplest classification is based on cause: either &quot;infective&quot; or &quot;non-infective&quot;, depending on whether a microorganism is the source of the inflammation or not. Regardless, the diagnosis of endocarditis is based on clinical features, investigations such as an echocardiogram, and blood cultures demonstrating the presence of endocarditis-causing microorganisms.

Signs and symptoms include fever, chills, sweating, malaise, weakness, anorexia, weight loss, splenomegaly, flu-like feeling, cardiac murmur, heart failure, petechia (red spots on the skin), Osler&#x27;s nodes (subcutaneous nodules found on hands and feet), Janeway lesions (nodular lesions on palms and soles), and Roth&#x27;s spots (retinal hemorrhages).

==Infective endocarditis==
Infective endocarditis is an infection of the inner surface of the heart, usually the valves. Symptoms may include fever, small areas of bleeding into the skin, heart murmur, feeling tired, and low red blood cells. Complications may include valvular insufficiency, heart failure, stroke, and kidney failure.
The cause is typically a bacterial infection and less commonly a fungal infection. Risk factors include valvular heart disease including rheumatic disease, congenital heart disease, artificial valves, hemodialysis, intravenous drug use, and electronic pacemakers. The bacteria most commonly involved are streptococci or staphylococci.

The diagnosis of infective endocarditis relies on the Duke criteria, which were originally described in 1994 and modified in 2000. Clinical features and microbiological examinations are the first steps to diagnose an infective endocarditis. The imaging is also crucial. Echocardiography is the cornerstone of imaging modality in the diagnosis of infective endocarditis. Alternative imaging modalities as computer tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography/computer tomography (PET/CT) with 2-[18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) are playing an increasing role in the diagnosis and management of infective endocarditis.
The usefulness of antibiotics following dental procedures has changed over time. Prevention is recommended in patients at high risk. Treatment is generally with intravenous antibiotics. The choice of antibiotics is based on the blood cultures. Occasionally heart surgery is required. Populations at high risk of infective endocarditis include patients with previous infective endocarditis, patients with surgical or transcatheter prosthetic valves or post-cardiac valve repair, and patients with untreated CHD and surgically corrected congenital heart disease.
The number of people affected is about 5 per 100,000 per year. Rates, however, vary between regions of the world. Males are affected more often than females. The risk of death among those infected is about 25%. Without treatment it is almost universally fatal.

==Non-infective endocarditis==

Nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE) is most commonly found on previously undamaged valves. As opposed to infective endocarditis, the vegetations in NBTE are small, sterile, and tend to aggregate along the edges of the valve or the cusps. Also unlike infective endocarditis, NBTE does not cause an inflammation response from the body. NBTE usually occurs during a hypercoagulable state such as system-wide bacterial infection, or pregnancy, though it is also sometimes seen in patients with venous catheters. NBTE may also occur in patients with cancer, particularly mucinous adenocarcinoma where Trousseau syndrome can be encountered. Typically NBTE does not cause many problems on its own, but parts of the vegetations may break off and embolize to the heart or brain, or they may serve as a focus where bacteria can lodge, thus causing infective endocarditis.

Another form of sterile endocarditis is termed Libman–Sacks endocarditis; this form occurs more often in patients with lupus erythematosus and is thought to be due to the deposition of immune complexes. Like NBTE, Libman-Sacks endocarditis involves small vegetations, while infective endocarditis is composed of large vegetations. These immune complexes precipitate an inflammation reaction, which helps to differentiate it from NBTE. Also unlike NBTE, Libman-Sacks endocarditis does not seem to have a preferred location of deposition and may form on the undersurfaces of the valves or even on the endocardium.

<doc id="9660" wikidata="Q1096450" url="?curid=9660" title="Euler's sum of powers conjecture">
<text>In number theory, Euler&#x27;s conjecture is a disproved conjecture related to Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem. It was proposed by Leonhard Euler in 1769. It states that for all integers and greater than 1, if the sum of many th powers of positive integers is itself a th power, then is greater than or equal to :

formula_1

The conjecture represents an attempt to generalize Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem, which is the special case : if formula_2 then .

Although the conjecture holds for the case (which follows from Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem for the third powers), it was disproved for and . It is unknown whether the conjecture fails or holds for any value .

== Background ==
Euler was aware of the equality involving sums of four fourth powers; this, however, is not a counterexample because no term is isolated on one side of the equation. He also provided a complete solution to the four cubes problem as in Plato&#x27;s number or the taxicab number 1729. The general solution of the equation formula_3
is

formula_4

where , and formula_5 are any rational numbers.

== Counterexamples ==
Euler&#x27;s conjecture was disproven by L. J. Lander and T. R. Parkin in 1966 when, through a direct computer search on a CDC 6600, they found a counterexample for . This was published in a paper comprising just two sentences. A total of three primitive (that is, in which the summands do not all have a common factor) counterexamples are known:
formula_6
(Lander &amp; Parkin, 1966); (Scher &amp; Seidl, 1996); (Frye, 2004).

In 1988, Noam Elkies published a method to construct an infinite sequence of counterexamples for the case. His smallest counterexample was
formula_7

A particular case of Elkies&#x27; solutions can be reduced to the identity
formula_8
where
formula_9
This is an elliptic curve with a rational point at . From this initial rational point, one can compute an infinite collection of others. Substituting into the identity and removing common factors gives the numerical example cited above.

In 1988, Roger Frye found the smallest possible counterexample 
formula_10
for by a direct computer search using techniques suggested by Elkies. This solution is the only one with values of the variables below 1,000,000.

== Generalizations ==
In 1967, L. J. Lander, T. R. Parkin, and John Selfridge conjectured that if 
:formula_11,
where are positive integers for all and , then . In the special case , the conjecture states that if
:formula_12
(under the conditions given above) then .

The special case may be described as the problem of giving a partition of a perfect power into few like powers. For and or , there are many known solutions. Some of these are listed below.

<text>The Book of Exodus (from ; &quot;Šəmōṯ&quot;, &#x27;Names&#x27;; ) is the second book of the Bible. It is a narrative of the Exodus, the origin myth of the Israelites leaving slavery in Biblical Egypt through the strength of their deity named Yahweh, who according to the story chose them as his people. The Israelites then journey with the legendary prophet Moses to Mount Sinai, where Yahweh gives the Ten Commandments and they enter into a covenant with Yahweh, who promises to make them a &quot;holy nation, and a kingdom of priests&quot; on condition of their faithfulness. He gives them their laws and instructions to build the Tabernacle, the means by which he will come from heaven and dwell with them and lead them in a holy war to conquer Canaan (the &quot;Promised Land&quot;), which has earlier, according to the myth of Genesis, been promised to the &quot;seed&quot; of Abraham, the legendary patriarch of the Israelites.

Traditionally ascribed to Moses himself, modern scholars see its initial composition as a product of the Babylonian exile (6th century BCE), based on earlier written sources and oral traditions, with final revisions in the Persian post-exilic period (5th century BCE). American biblical scholar Carol Meyers, in her commentary on Exodus, suggests that it is arguably the most important book in the Bible, as it presents the defining features of Israel&#x27;s identity—memories of a past marked by hardship and escape, a binding covenant with their God, who chooses Israel, and the establishment of the life of the community and the guidelines for sustaining it. The consensus of modern scholars is that the Pentateuch does not give an accurate account of the origins of the Israelites, who appear instead to have formed as an entity in the central highlands of Canaan in the late second millennium BCE (around the time of the Late Bronze Age collapse) from the indigenous Canaanite culture.

==Title==
The English name &quot;Exodus&quot; comes from the , from and . In Hebrew the book&#x27;s title is שְׁמוֹת, &quot;shemōt&quot;, &quot;Names&quot;, from the beginning words of the text: &quot;These are the names of the sons of Israel&quot; ().

==Historicity ==
Most mainstream scholars do not accept the biblical Exodus account as historical for a number of reasons. It is generally agreed that the Exodus stories were written centuries after the apparent setting of the stories. Archaeologists Israel Finkelstein and Neil Asher Silberman argue that archaeology has not found evidence for even a small band of wandering Israelites living in the Sinai: &quot;The conclusion – that Exodus did not happen at the time and in the manner described in the Bible – seems irrefutable [...] repeated excavations and surveys throughout the entire area have not provided even the slightest evidence&quot;. Instead, they argue how modern archaeology suggests continuity between Canaanite and Israelite settlements, indicating a heavily Canaanite origin for Israel, with little suggestion that a group of foreigners from Egypt comprised early Israel. They also argue that the exodus narrative perhaps evolved from vague memories of the Hyksos expulsion, spun to encourage resistance to the 7th century domination of Judah by Egypt.

However, a majority of scholars believe that the story has an historical core, though disagreeing widely about what that historical kernel might have been. Kenton Sparks refers to it as &quot;charter myth&quot; and &quot;mythologized history&quot;. Biblical scholar Graham I. Davies notes that several literary texts from Ancient Egypt document the presence of Semitic peoples working for building projects under the 19th Dynasty of Egypt, suggesting a possible historical basis for the account of Israelite servitude to the Egyptians. However, there is an increasing trend among scholars to see the biblical exodus traditions as the invention of the exilic and post-exilic Jewish community, with little to no historical basis.

== Structure ==
There is no unanimous agreement among scholars on the structure of Exodus. One strong possibility is that it is a diptych (i.e., divided into two parts), with the division between parts 1 and 2 at the crossing of the Red Sea or at the beginning of the theophany (appearance of God) in chapter 19. On this plan, the first part tells of God&#x27;s rescue of his people from Egypt and their journey under his care to Sinai (chapters 1–19) and the second tells of the covenant between them (chapters 20–40).

== Summary ==

The text of the Book of Exodus begins after the events at the end of the Book of Genesis where Jacob&#x27;s sons and their families joined their brother Joseph in Egypt, which Joseph had saved from famine. It is 400 years later and Egypt&#x27;s new Pharaoh, who does not remember Joseph, is fearful that the enslaved and now numerous Israelites could become a fifth column. He hardens their labor and orders the killing of all newborn boys. A Levite woman named Jochebed saves her baby by setting him adrift on the Nile in an ark of bulrushes. Pharaoh&#x27;s daughter finds the child, names him Moses, and brings him up as her own.
Later, a grown Moses goes out to see his kinsmen. He witnesses the abuse of a Hebrew slave by an Egyptian overseer. Angered, Moses kills him and flees into Midian to escape punishment. There, he marries Zipporah, daughter of Jethro, a Midianite priest. While tending Jethro&#x27;s flock, Moses encounters God in a burning bush. Moses asks God for his name, to which God replies with three words, often translated as &quot;I Am that I Am.&quot; This is the book&#x27;s explanation for the origin of the name Yahweh, as God is thereafter known. God tells Moses to return to Egypt, free the Hebrews from slavery and lead them into Canaan, the land promised to the seed of Abraham in Genesis. On the journey back to Egypt, God seeks to kill Moses. Zipporah circumcises their son and the attack stops. &quot;(See Zipporah at the inn.)&quot;

Moses reunites with his brother Aaron and, returning to Egypt, convenes the Israelite elders, preparing them to go into the wilderness to worship God. Pharaoh refuses to release the Israelites from their work for the festival, and so God curses the Egyptians with ten terrible plagues, such as a river of blood, an outbreak of frogs, and the thick darkness. Moses is commanded by God to fix the spring month of Aviv at the head of the Hebrew calendar. The Israelites are to take a lamb on the 10th day of the month, sacrifice the lamb on the 14th day, daub its blood on their mezuzot—doorposts and lintels, and to observe the Passover meal that night, during the full moon. The 10th plague comes that night, causing the death of all Egyptian firstborn sons, prompting Pharaoh to expel the Israelites. Regretting his decision, Pharaoh commands his chariot army after the Israelites, who appear trapped at the Red Sea. God parts the sea, allowing the Israelites to pass through, before drowning Pharaoh&#x27;s pursuing forces.
As desert life proves arduous, the Israelites complain and long for Egypt, but God miraculously provides manna for them to eat and water to drink. The Israelites arrive at the mountain of God, where Moses&#x27;s father-in-law Jethro visits Moses; at his suggestion, Moses appoints judges over Israel. God asks whether they will agree to be his people – They accept. The people gather at the foot of the mountain, and with thunder and lightning, fire and clouds of smoke, the sound of trumpets, and the trembling of the mountain, God appears on the peak, and the people see the cloud and hear the voice (or possibly sound) of God. God tells Moses to ascend the mountain. God pronounces the Ten Commandments (the Ethical Decalogue) in the hearing of all Israel. Moses goes up the mountain into the presence of God, who pronounces the Covenant Code of ritual and civil law and promises Canaan to them if they obey. Moses comes down from the mountain and writes down God&#x27;s words, and the people agree to keep them. God calls Moses up the mountain again, where he remains for forty days and forty nights, after which he returns, bearing the set of stone tablets.

God gives Moses instructions for the construction of the tabernacle so that God may dwell permanently among his chosen people, along with instructions for the priestly vestments, the altar and its appurtenances, procedures for the ordination of priests, and the daily sacrifice offerings. Aaron becomes the first hereditary high priest. God gives Moses the two tablets of stone containing the words of the ten commandments, written with the &quot;finger of God&quot;.
While Moses is with God, Aaron casts a golden calf, which the people worship. God informs Moses of their apostasy and threatens to kill them all, but relents when Moses pleads for them. Moses comes down from the mountain, smashes the stone tablets in anger, and commands the Levites to massacre the unfaithful Israelites. God commands Moses to construct two new tablets. Moses ascends the mountain again, where God dictates the Ten Commandments for Moses to write on the tablets.

Moses descends from the mountain with a transformed face; from that time onwards he must hide his face with a veil. Moses assembles the Hebrews and repeats to them the commandments he has received from God, which are to keep the Sabbath and to construct the Tabernacle. The Israelites do as they are commanded. From that time God dwells in the Tabernacle and orders the travels of the Hebrews.

== Composition ==
=== Authorship ===

Jewish and Christian tradition viewed Moses as the author of Exodus and the entire Torah, but by the end of the 19th century the increasing awareness of discrepancies, inconsistencies, repetitions and other features of the Pentateuch had led scholars to abandon this idea. In approximate round dates, the process which produced Exodus and the Pentateuch probably began around 600 BCE when existing oral and written traditions were brought together to form books recognizable as those we know, reaching their final form as unchangeable sacred texts around 400 BCE.

=== Sources ===

Although patent mythical elements are not so prominent in Exodus as in Genesis, ancient legends may have an influence on the book&#x27;s form or content: for example, the story of the infant Moses&#x27;s salvation from the Nile is argued to be based on an earlier legend of king Sargon of Akkad, while the story of the parting of the Red Sea may trade on Mesopotamian creation mythology. Similarly, the Covenant Code (the law code in Exodus 20:22–23:33) has some similarities in both content and structure with the Laws of Hammurabi. These potential influences serve to reinforce the conclusion that the Book of Exodus originated in the exiled Jewish community of 6th-century BCE Babylon, but not all the potential sources are Mesopotamian: the story of Moses&#x27;s flight to Midian following the murder of the Egyptian overseer may draw on the Egyptian &quot;Story of Sinuhe&quot;.

=== Textual witnesses ===
== Themes ==
=== Salvation ===
Biblical scholars describe the Bible&#x27;s theologically motivated history writing as &quot;salvation history&quot;, meaning a history of God&#x27;s saving actions that give identity to Israel – the promise of offspring and land to the ancestors, the Exodus from Egypt (in which God saves Israel from slavery), the wilderness wandering, the revelation at Sinai, and the hope for the future life in the Promised Land.

=== Theophany ===
A theophany is a manifestation (appearance) of a god – in the Bible, an appearance of the God of Israel, accompanied by storms – the earth trembles, the mountains quake, the heavens pour rain, thunder peals, and lightning flashes. The theophany in Exodus begins &quot;the third day&quot; from their arrival at Sinai in chapter 19: Yahweh and the people meet at the mountain, God appears in the storm and converses with Moses, giving him the Ten Commandments while the people listen. Therefore, theophany is a public experience of divine law.

The second half of Exodus marks the point at which, and describes the process through which, God&#x27;s theophany becomes a permanent presence for Israel via the Tabernacle. That so much of the book (chapters 25–31, 35–40) describes the plans of the Tabernacle demonstrates the importance it played in the perception of Second Temple Judaism at the time of the text&#x27;s redaction by the Priestly writers: the Tabernacle is the place where God is physically present, where, through the priesthood, Israel could be in direct, literal communion with him.

=== Covenant ===

The heart of Exodus is the Sinaitic covenant. A covenant is a legal document binding two parties to take on certain obligations towards each other. There are several covenants in the Bible, and in each case, they exhibit at least some of the elements in real-life treaties of the ancient Middle East: a preamble, historical prologue, stipulations, deposition and reading, list of witnesses, blessings, and curses, and ratification by animal sacrifice. Biblical covenants, in contrast to Eastern covenants in general, are between a god, Yahweh, and a people, Israel, instead of between a strong ruler and a weaker vassal.

=== Election of Israel ===
God elects Israel for salvation because the &quot;sons of Israel&quot; are &quot;the firstborn sons&quot; of the God of Israel, descended through Shem and Abraham to the chosen line of Jacob whose name is changed to Israel. The goal of the divine plan in Exodus is a return to humanity&#x27;s state in Eden so that God can dwell with the Israelites as he had with Adam and Eve through the Ark and Tabernacle, which together form a model of the universe; in later Abrahamic religions Israel becomes the guardian of God&#x27;s plan for humanity, to bring &quot;God&#x27;s creation blessing to mankind&quot; begun in Adam.

<text>Electronics is a scientific and engineering discipline that studies and applies the principles of physics to design, create, and operate devices that manipulate electrons and other electrically charged particles. It is a subfield of physics and electrical engineering which uses active devices such as transistors, diodes, and integrated circuits to control and amplify the flow of electric current and to convert it from one form to another, such as from alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC) or from analog signals to digital signals.
Electronic devices have hugely influenced the development of many aspects of modern society, such as telecommunications, entertainment, education, health care, industry, and security. The main driving force behind the advancement of electronics is the semiconductor industry, which in response to global demand continually produces ever-more sophisticated electronic devices and circuits. The semiconductor industry is one of the largest and most profitable sectors in the global economy, with annual revenues exceeding $481 billion in 2018. The electronics industry also encompasses other sectors that rely on electronic devices and systems, such as e-commerce, which generated over $29 trillion in online sales in 2017.

==History and development==

Karl Ferdinand Braun´s development of the crystal detector, the first semiconductor device, in 1874 and the identification of the electron in 1897 by Sir Joseph John Thomson, along with the subsequent invention of the vacuum tube which could amplify and rectify small electrical signals, inaugurated the field of electronics and the electron age. Practical applications started with the invention of the diode by Ambrose Fleming and the triode by Lee De Forest in the early 1900s, which made the detection of small electrical voltages, such as radio signals from a radio antenna, practicable.

Vacuum tubes (thermionic valves) were the first active electronic components which controlled current flow by influencing the flow of individual electrons, and enabled the construction of equipment that used current amplification and rectification to give us radio, television, radar, long-distance telephony and much more. The early growth of electronics was rapid, and by the 1920s, commercial radio broadcasting and telecommunications were becoming widespread and electronic amplifiers were being used in such diverse applications as long-distance telephony and the music recording industry.

The next big technological step took several decades to appear, when the first working point-contact transistor was invented by John Bardeen and Walter Houser Brattain at Bell Labs in 1947.
However, vacuum tubes continued to play a leading role in the field of microwave and high power transmission as well as television receivers until the middle of the 1980s.
Since then, solid-state devices have all but completely taken over. Vacuum tubes are still used in some specialist applications such as high power RF amplifiers, cathode-ray tubes, specialist audio equipment, guitar amplifiers and some microwave devices.

In April 1955, the IBM 608 was the first IBM product to use transistor circuits without any vacuum tubes and is believed to be the first all-transistorized calculator to be manufactured for the commercial market. The 608 contained more than 3,000 germanium transistors. Thomas J. Watson Jr. ordered all future IBM products to use transistors in their design. From that time on transistors were almost exclusively used for computer logic circuits and peripheral devices. However, early junction transistors were relatively bulky devices that were difficult to manufacture on a mass-production basis, which limited them to a number of specialised applications.

The MOSFET was invented at Bell Labs between 1955 and 1960. It was the first truly compact transistor that could be miniaturised and mass-produced for a wide range of uses. Its advantages include high scalability, affordability, low power consumption, and high density. It revolutionized the electronics industry, becoming the most widely used electronic device in the world. The MOSFET is the basic element in most modern electronic equipment.

As the complexity of circuits grew, problems arose. One problem was the size of the circuit. A complex circuit like a computer was dependent on speed. If the components were large, the wires interconnecting them must be long. The electric signals took time to go through the circuit, thus slowing the computer. The invention of the integrated circuit by Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce solved this problem by making all the components and the chip out of the same block (monolith) of semiconductor material. The circuits could be made smaller, and the manufacturing process could be automated. This led to the idea of integrating all components on a single-crystal silicon wafer, which led to small-scale integration (SSI) in the early 1960s, and then medium-scale integration (MSI) in the late 1960s, followed by VLSI. In 2008, billion-transistor processors became commercially available.

== Devices and components ==
An electronic component is any component in an electronic system either active or passive. Components are connected together, usually by being soldered to a printed circuit board (PCB), to create an electronic circuit with a particular function. Components may be packaged singly, or in more complex groups as integrated circuits. Passive electronic components are capacitors, inductors, resistors, whilst active components are such as semiconductor devices; transistors and thyristors, which control current flow at electron level.

== Types of circuits ==
Electronic circuit functions can be divided into two function groups: analog and digital. A particular device may consist of circuitry that has either or a mix of the two types. Analog circuits are becoming less common, as many of their functions are being digitized.

=== Analog circuits ===

Analog circuits use a continuous range of voltage or current for signal processing, as opposed to the discrete levels used in digital circuits. Analog circuits were common throughout an electronic device in the early years in devices such as radio receivers and transmitters. Analog electronic computers were valuable for solving problems with continuous variables until digital processing advanced.

As semiconductor technology developed, many of the functions of analog circuits were taken over by digital circuits, and modern circuits that are entirely analog are less common; their functions being replaced by hybrid approach which, for instance, uses analog circuits at the &quot;front end&quot; of a device receiving an analog signal, and then use digital processing using microprocessor techniques thereafter.

Sometimes it may be difficult to classify some circuits that have elements of both linear and non-linear operation. An example is the voltage comparator which receives a continuous range of voltage but only outputs one of two levels as in a digital circuit. Similarly, an overdriven transistor amplifier can take on the characteristics of a controlled switch, having essentially two levels of output.

Analog circuits are still widely used for signal amplification, such as in the entertainment industry, and conditioning signals from analog sensors, such as in industrial measurement and control.

=== Digital circuits ===

Digital circuits are electric circuits based on discrete voltage levels. Digital circuits use Boolean algebra and are the basis of all digital computers and microprocessor devices. They range from simple logic gates to large integrated circuits, employing millions of such gates.

Digital circuits use a binary system with two voltage levels labelled &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot; to indicated logical status. Often logic &quot;0&quot; will be a lower voltage and referred to as &quot;Low&quot; while logic &quot;1&quot; is referred to as &quot;High&quot;. However, some systems use the reverse definition (&quot;0&quot; is &quot;High&quot;) or are current based. Quite often the logic designer may reverse these definitions from one circuit to the next as they see fit to facilitate their design. The definition of the levels as &quot;0&quot; or &quot;1&quot; is arbitrary.

Ternary (with three states) logic has been studied, and some prototype computers made, but have not gained any significant practical acceptance. Universally, Computers and Digital signal processors are constructed with digital circuits using Transistors such as MOSFETs in the electronic logic gates to generate binary states.

* Logic gates
* Adders
* Flip-flops
* Counters
* Registers
* Multiplexers
* Schmitt triggers

Highly integrated devices:
* Memory chip
* Microprocessors
* Microcontrollers
* Application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)
* Digital signal processor (DSP)
* Field-programmable gate array (FPGA)
* Field-programmable analog array (FPAA)
* System on chip (SOC)

== Design ==
Electronic systems design deals with the multi-disciplinary design issues of complex electronic devices and systems, such as mobile phones and computers. The subject covers a broad spectrum, from the design and development of an electronic system (new product development) to assuring its proper function, service life and disposal. Electronic systems design is therefore the process of defining and developing complex electronic devices to satisfy specified requirements of the user.

Due to the complex nature of electronics theory, laboratory experimentation is an important part of the development of electronic devices. These experiments are used to test or verify the engineer&#x27;s design and detect errors. Historically, electronics labs have consisted of electronics devices and equipment located in a physical space, although in more recent years the trend has been towards electronics lab simulation software, such as CircuitLogix, Multisim, and PSpice.

=== Computer-aided design ===
Today&#x27;s electronics engineers have the ability to design circuits using premanufactured building blocks such as power supplies, semiconductors (i.e. semiconductor devices, such as transistors), and integrated circuits. Electronic design automation software programs include schematic capture programs and printed circuit board design programs. Popular names in the EDA software world are NI Multisim, Cadence (ORCAD), EAGLE PCB and Schematic, Mentor (PADS PCB and LOGIC Schematic), Altium (Protel), LabCentre Electronics (Proteus), gEDA, KiCad and many others.

== Negative qualities ==

=== Thermal management ===

Heat generated by electronic circuitry must be dissipated to prevent immediate failure and improve long term reliability. Heat dissipation is mostly achieved by passive conduction/convection. Means to achieve greater dissipation include heat sinks and fans for air cooling, and other forms of computer cooling such as water cooling. These techniques use convection, conduction, and radiation of heat energy.

=== Noise ===

Electronic noise is defined as unwanted disturbances superposed on a useful signal that tend to obscure its information content. Noise is not the same as signal distortion caused by a circuit. Noise is associated with all electronic circuits. Noise may be electromagnetically or thermally generated, which can be decreased by lowering the operating temperature of the circuit. Other types of noise, such as shot noise cannot be removed as they are due to limitations in physical properties.

== Packaging methods ==
Many different methods of connecting components have been used over the years. For instance, early electronics often used point to point wiring with components attached to wooden breadboards to construct circuits. Cordwood construction and wire wrap were other methods used. Most modern day electronics now use printed circuit boards made of materials such as FR4, or the cheaper (and less hard-wearing) Synthetic Resin Bonded Paper (SRBP, also known as Paxoline/Paxolin (trade marks) and FR2) – characterised by its brown colour. Health and environmental concerns associated with electronics assembly have gained increased attention in recent years, especially for products destined to go to European markets.

Electrical components are generally mounted in the following ways:
* Through-hole (sometimes referred to as &#x27;Pin-Through-Hole&#x27;)
* Surface mount
* Chassis mount
* Rack mount
* LGA/BGA/PGA socket

== Industry ==

The electronics industry consists of various sectors. The central driving force behind the entire electronics industry is the semiconductor industry sector, which has annual sales of over as of 2018. The largest industry sector is e-commerce, which generated over in 2017. The most widely manufactured electronic device is the metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET), with an estimated 13sextillion MOSFETs having been manufactured between 1960 and 2018. In the 1960s, U.S. manufacturers were unable to compete with Japanese companies such as Sony and Hitachi who could produce high-quality goods at lower prices. By the 1980s, however, U.S. manufacturers became the world leaders in semiconductor development and assembly.

However, during the 1990s and subsequently, the industry shifted overwhelmingly to East Asia (a process begun with the initial movement of microchip mass-production there in the 1970s), as plentiful, cheap labor, and increasing technological sophistication, became widely available there.

Over three decades, the United States&#x27; global share of semiconductor manufacturing capacity fell, from 37% in 1990, to 12% in 2022. America&#x27;s pre-eminent semiconductor manufacturer, Intel Corporation, fell far behind its subcontractor Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) in manufacturing technology.

By that time, Taiwan had become the world&#x27;s leading source of advanced semiconductors—followed by South Korea, the United States, Japan, Singapore, and China.

Important semiconductor industry facilities (which often are subsidiaries of a leading producer based elsewhere) also exist in Europe (notably the Netherlands), Southeast Asia, South America, and Israel.

<doc id="9664" wikidata="Q1350048" url="?curid=9664" title="Erewhon">
<text>Erewhon: or, Over the Range () is a novel by English writer Samuel Butler, first published in 1872, set in a fictional country discovered and explored by the protagonist. The book is a satire on Victorian society.

The first few chapters of the novel dealing with the discovery of Erewhon are based on Butler&#x27;s own experiences in New Zealand, where, as a young man, he worked as a sheep farmer on Mesopotamia Station for four years (1860–1864), exploring parts of the interior of the South Island and writing about it in &quot;A First Year in Canterbury Settlement&quot; (1863).

The novel is one of the first to explore ideas of artificial intelligence, as influenced by Darwin&#x27;s recently published &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; (1859) and the machines developed out of the Industrial Revolution (late 18th to early 19th centuries). Specifically, it concerns itself, in the three-chapter &quot;Book of the Machines&quot;, with the potentially dangerous ideas of machine consciousness and self-replicating machines.

==Content==
The greater part of the book consists of a description of Erewhon. The nature of this nation is intended to be ambiguous. At first glance, Erewhon appears to be a utopia, yet it soon becomes clear that this is far from the case. Yet for all the failings of Erewhon, it is also clearly not a dystopia, such as that depicted in George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; (1949).

As a satirical utopia, &quot;Erewhon&quot; has sometimes been compared to &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; (1726), by Jonathan Swift; the image of Utopia in this latter case also bears strong parallels with the self-view of the British Empire at the time. It can also be compared to the William Morris novel, &quot;News from Nowhere&quot; (1890) and Thomas More&#x27;s &quot;Utopia&quot; (1516).

&quot;Erewhon&quot; satirises various aspects of Victorian society, including criminal punishment, religion, and anthropocentrism. For example, according to Erewhonian law, offenders are treated as if they were ill, whereas ill people are looked upon as criminals. Another feature of Erewhon is the absence of machines; this is due to the widely shared perception by the Erewhonians that machines are potentially dangerous.

===The Book of the Machines===
Butler developed the three chapters of &quot;Erewhon&quot; that make up &quot;The Book of the Machines&quot; from a number of articles he had contributed to &quot;The Press&quot;, which had just begun publication in Christchurch, New Zealand, beginning with &quot;Darwin among the Machines&quot; (1863). Butler was the first to write about the possibility that machines might develop consciousness by natural selection.

Many dismissed this as a joke, but, in his preface to the second edition, Butler wrote, &quot;I regret that reviewers have in some cases been inclined to treat the chapters on Machines as an attempt to reduce Mr Darwin&#x27;s theory to an absurdity. Nothing could be further from my intention, and few things would be more distasteful to me than any attempt to laugh at Mr Darwin.&quot;

===Characters===
* Higgs—The narrator who informs the reader of the nature of Erewhonian society.
* Chowbok (Kahabuka)—Higgs&#x27; guide into the mountains; he is a native who greatly fears the Erewhonians. He eventually abandons Higgs.
* Yram—The daughter of Higgs&#x27; jailer who takes care of him when he first enters Erewhon. Her name is Mary spelled backwards.
* Senoj Nosnibor—Higgs&#x27; host after he is released from prison; he hopes that Higgs will marry his elder daughter. His name is Robinson Jones backwards.
* Zulora—Senoj Nosnibor&#x27;s elder daughter—Higgs finds her unpleasant, but her father hopes Higgs will marry her.
* Arowhena—Senoj Nosnibor&#x27;s younger daughter; she falls in love with Higgs and runs away with him.
* Mahaina—A woman who claims to suffer from alcoholism but is believed to have a weak temperament.
* Ydgrun—The incomprehensible goddess of the Erewhonians. Her name is an anagram of Grundy (from Mrs. Grundy, a character in Thomas Morton&#x27;s play &quot;Speed the Plough&quot;).

==Reception==
In 1873, the reviewer in the Dunedin newspaper the &quot;Otago Witness&quot; declared that &quot;Erewhon&quot; was the best English satirical fiction since &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; (1726).

In a 1945 broadcast, George Orwell praised the book and said that when Butler wrote &quot;Erewhon&quot; it needed &quot;imagination of a very high order to see that machinery could be dangerous as well as useful&quot;. He recommended the novel, though not its sequel, &quot;Erewhon Revisited&quot;.

==Influence and legacy==
===Deleuze and Guattari===
The French philosopher Gilles Deleuze used ideas from Butler&#x27;s book at various points in the development of his philosophy of difference. In &quot;Difference and Repetition&quot; (1968), Deleuze refers to what he calls &quot;Ideas&quot; as &quot;Erewhon&quot;. &quot;Ideas are not concepts&quot;, he argues, but rather &quot;a form of eternally positive differential multiplicity, distinguished from the identity of concepts.&quot; &quot;Erewhon&quot; refers to the &quot;nomadic distributions&quot; that pertain to simulacra, which &quot;are not universals like the categories, nor are they the &quot;hic et nunc&quot; or &quot;nowhere&quot;, the diversity to which categories apply in representation.&quot; &quot;Erewhon&quot;, in this reading, is &quot;not only a disguised &quot;no-where&quot; but a rearranged &quot;now-here&quot;.&quot;

In his collaboration with Félix Guattari, &quot;Anti-Oedipus&quot; (1972), Deleuze draws on Butler&#x27;s &quot;The Book of the Machines&quot; to &quot;go beyond&quot; the &quot;usual polemic between vitalism and mechanism&quot; as it relates to their concept of &quot;desiring-machines&quot;:
===Other References===

Karl Popper&#x27;s book &quot;The Open Society and Its Enemies&quot; (1945), includes and epigraph from &quot;Erewhon&quot; that reads, &quot;It will be seen ... that the Erewhonians are a meek and long-suffering people easily led by the nose, and quick to offer up common sense at the shrine of logic, when a philosopher arises among them who carries them away ... by convincing them that their existing institutions are not based on the strictest principles of morality.&quot;

Alan M. Turing references &quot;Erewhon&quot; in his posthumously published paper, &quot;Intelligent Machinery, A Heretical Theory&quot; (c. 1951).

<doc id="9667" wikidata="Q2603645" url="?curid=9667" title="Entorhinal cortex">
<text>The entorhinal cortex (EC) is an area of the brain&#x27;s allocortex, located in the medial temporal lobe, whose functions include being a widespread network hub for memory, navigation, and the perception of time. The EC is the main interface between the hippocampus and neocortex. The EC-hippocampus system plays an important role in declarative (autobiographical/episodic/semantic) memories and in particular spatial memories including memory formation, memory consolidation, and memory optimization in sleep. The EC is also responsible for the pre-processing (familiarity) of the input signals in the reflex nictitating membrane response of classical trace conditioning; the association of impulses from the eye and the ear occurs in the entorhinal cortex.

==Anatomy==
The entorhinal cortex is a portion of the rostral parahippocampal gyrus.

=== Structure ===
It is usually divided into medial and lateral regions with three bands with distinct properties and connectivity running perpendicular across the whole area. A distinguishing characteristic of the EC is the lack of cell bodies where layer IV should be; this layer is called the &quot;Lamina dissecans&quot;.

===Connections===

The superficial layers – layers II and III – of EC project to the dentate gyrus and hippocampus: Layer II projects primarily to dentate gyrus and hippocampal region CA3; layer III projects primarily to hippocampal region CA1 and the subiculum. These layers receive input from other cortical areas, especially associational, perirhinal, and parahippocampal cortices, as well as prefrontal cortex. EC as a whole, therefore, receives highly processed input from every sensory modality, as well as input relating to ongoing cognitive processes, though it should be stressed that, within EC, this information remains at least partially segregated.

The deep layers, especially layer V, receive one of the three main outputs of the hippocampus and, in turn, reciprocate connections from other cortical areas that project to superficial EC.

===Brodmann&#x27;s areas===
* Brodmann area 28 is known as the &quot;area entorhinalis&quot;
* Brodmann area 34 is known as the &quot;area entorhinalis dorsalis&quot;

==Function==
===Neuron information processing===
In 2005, it was discovered that entorhinal cortex contains a neural map of the spatial environment in rats. In 2014, John O&#x27;Keefe, May-Britt Moser and Edvard Moser received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, partly because of this discovery.

In rodents, neurons in the lateral entorhinal cortex exhibit little spatial selectivity, whereas neurons of the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), exhibit multiple &quot;place fields&quot; that are arranged in a hexagonal pattern, and are, therefore, called &quot;grid cells&quot;. These fields and spacing between fields increase from the dorso-lateral MEA to the ventro-medial MEA.

The same group of researchers has found speed cells in the medial entorhinal cortex of rats. The speed of movement is translated from proprioceptive information and is represented as firing rates in these cells. The cells are known to fire in correlation to future speed of the rodent.

Recently, a general theory has been proposed to elucidate the function of the reelin positive cells in the layer II of the entorhinal cortex. According to this concept, these cells would be generally organized into 1-dimensional ring attractors, and in the &quot;medial&quot; (in humans: &quot;posteromedial&quot;) portion, would function as grid cells (anatomically: stellate cells) while in &quot;lateral&quot; (in humans: &quot;anterolateral&quot;) portion, where they appear as fan cells, would enable the encoding of new episodic memories. This concept is underscored by the fact that fan cells of the entorhinal cortex are indispensable for the formation of episodic-like memories in rodents.

Single-unit recording of neurons in humans playing video games find path cells in the EC, the activity of which indicates whether a person is taking a clockwise or counterclockwise path. Such EC &quot;direction&quot; path cells show this directional activity irrespective of the location of where a person experiences themselves, which contrasts them to place cells in the hippocampus, which are activated by specific locations.

EC neurons process general information such as directional activity in the environment, which contrasts to that of the hippocampal neurons, which usually encode information about specific places. This suggests that EC encodes general properties about current contexts that are then used by hippocampus to create unique representations from combinations of these properties.

Research generally highlights a useful distinction in which the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) mainly supports processing of space, whereas the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) mainly supports the processing of time. 

The MEC exhibits a strong ~8 Hz rhythmic neural activity known as theta. Alterations in the neural activity across the brain region results in an observed &quot;traveling wave&quot; phenomena across the MEC long-axis, similar to that of the hippocampus, due to asymmetric theta oscillations. The underlying cause of these phase shifts and their waveform changes is unknown. 

Individual variation in the volume of EC is linked to taste perception. People with a larger EC in the left hemisphere found quinine, the source of bitterness in tonic water, less bitter.

==Clinical significance==
===Alzheimer&#x27;s disease===
The entorhinal cortex is the first area of the brain to be affected in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease; in year 2013, a functional magnetic resonance imaging study has localised the area to the lateral entorhinal cortex. Lopez &quot;et al.&quot; have shown, in a multimodal study, that there are differences in the volume of the left entorhinal cortex between progressing (to Alzheimer&#x27;s disease) and stable mild cognitive impairment patients. These authors also found that the volume of the left entorhinal cortex inversely correlates with the level of alpha band phase synchronization between the right anterior cingulate and temporo-occipital regions.

In 2012, neuroscientists at UCLA conducted an experiment using a virtual taxi video game connected to seven epilepsy patients with electrodes already implanted in their brains, allowing the researchers to monitor neuronal activity whenever memories were being formed. As the researchers stimulated the nerve fibers of each of the patients&#x27; entorhinal cortex as they were learning, they were then able to better navigate themselves through various routes and recognize landmarks more quickly. This signified an improvement in the patients&#x27; spatial memory.

== Research ==
Effect of aerobic exercise

A study on young subjects found aerobic fitness to be positively correlated with entorhinal cortex volume, indicating that aerobic exercise may have a positive effect on the medial temporal lobe memory system (which includes the entorhinal cortex).

== In other animals ==
In rodents, the EC is located at the caudal end of the temporal lobe. The rodent entorhinal cortex shows a modular organization, with different properties and connections in different areas.

In primates it is located at the rostral end of the temporal lobe and stretches dorsolaterally.

<text>Ernst Heinrich Philipp August Haeckel (; 16 February 1834 – 9 August 1919) was a German zoologist, naturalist, eugenicist, philosopher, physician, professor, marine biologist and artist. He discovered, described and named thousands of new species, mapped a genealogical tree relating all life forms and coined many terms in biology, including &quot;ecology&quot;, &quot;phylum&quot;, &quot;phylogeny&quot;, and &quot;Protista.&quot; Haeckel promoted and popularised Charles Darwin&#x27;s work in Germany and developed the debunked but influential recapitulation theory (&quot;ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny&quot;), falsely claiming that an individual organism&#x27;s biological development, or ontogeny, parallels and summarizes its species&#x27; evolutionary development, or phylogeny, using incorrectly redrawn images of human embryonic development, images which heavily influenced the public to believe in the theory of evolution. Whether he intentionally falsified the images or drew them poorly by accident is a matter of debate.

The published artwork of Haeckel includes over 100 detailed, multi-colour illustrations of animals and sea creatures, collected in his &quot;Kunstformen der Natur&quot; (&quot;Art Forms of Nature&quot;), a book which would go on to influence the Art Nouveau artistic movement. As a philosopher, Ernst Haeckel wrote &quot;Die Welträthsel&quot; (1895–1899; in English: &quot;The Riddles of the Universe&quot;, 1900), the genesis for the term &quot;world riddle&quot; (&quot;Welträtsel&quot;); and &quot;Freedom in Science and Teaching&quot; to support teaching evolution.

Haeckel promoted scientific racism and embraced the idea of Social Darwinism. He was the first person to characterize the Great War as the &quot;first&quot; World War, which he did as early as 1914.

== Early life and education==
Ernst Haeckel was born on 16 February 1834, in Potsdam (then part of the Kingdom of Prussia).
In 1852, Haeckel completed studies at the &quot;Domgymnasium&quot;, the cathedral high-school of Merseburg. He then studied medicine in Berlin and Würzburg, particularly with Albert von Kölliker, Franz Leydig, Rudolf Virchow (with whom he later worked briefly as assistant), and with the anatomist-physiologist Johannes Peter Müller (1801–1858). Together with Hermann Steudner he attended botany lectures in Würzburg. In 1857 Haeckel attained a doctorate in medicine, and afterwards he received the license to practice medicine. The occupation of physician appeared less worthwhile to Haeckel after contact with suffering patients.

==Career==
Haeckel studied under Carl Gegenbaur at the University of Jena for three years. In 1861 he earned a habilitation in comparative anatomy and became a professor of zoology at the University at Jena, where he remained for 47 years, from 1862 to 1909. Between 1859 and 1866, Haeckel worked on many phyla, such as radiolarians, poriferans (sponges) and annelids (segmented worms). During a trip to the Mediterranean, Haeckel named nearly 150 new species of radiolarians.

From 1866 to 1867 Haeckel made an extended journey to the Canary Islands with Hermann Fol. On 17 October 1866 he arrived in London. Over the next few days he met Charles Lyell, and visited Thomas Huxley and family at their home. On 21 October he visited Charles Darwin at Down House in Kent. In 1867 he married Agnes Huschke. Their son Walter was born in 1868, their daughters Elizabeth in 1871 and Emma in 1873. In 1869 he traveled as a researcher to Norway, in 1871 to Croatia (where he lived on the island of Hvar in a monastery), and in 1873 to Egypt, Turkey, and Greece. In 1907 he had a museum built in Jena to teach the public about evolution. Haeckel retired from teaching in 1909, and in 1910 he withdrew from the Evangelical Church of Prussia.

On the occasion of his 80th birthday celebration he was presented with a two-volume work entitled &quot;Was wir Ernst Haeckel verdanken (What We Owe to Ernst Haeckel)&quot;, edited at the request of the German Monistenbund by Heinrich Schmidt of Jena.

==Personal life and death==
In 1864, his first wife, Anna Sethe, died. Haeckel dedicated some species of jellyfish that he found beautiful (such as &quot;Desmonema annasethe&quot;) to her.
Haeckel&#x27;s second wife, Agnes, died in 1915, and he became substantially frailer, breaking his leg and arm. He sold his &quot;Villa Medusa&quot; in Jena in 1918 to the Carl Zeiss foundation, which preserved his library. 
Haeckel died on 9 August 1919.

=== Religious views ===
In &quot;Monism as Connecting Religion and Science&quot; (1892), he argued in favor of monism as the view most compatible with the current scientific understanding of the natural world. His perspective of monism was pantheistic and impersonal. The monistic idea of God, which alone is compatible with our present knowledge of nature, recognizes the divine spirit in all things. It can never recognise in God a &quot;personal being,&quot; or, in other words, an individual of limited extension in space, or even of human form. God is everywhere.
Haeckel became the most famous proponent of Monism in Germany.
In 1906 Haeckel belonged to the founders of the Monist League (Deutscher Monistenbund), which took a stance against philosophical materialism and promote a &quot;natural Weltanschauung&quot;. This organization lasted until 1933 and included such notable members as Wilhelm Ostwald, Georg von Arco (1869–1940), Helene Stöcker and Walter Arthur Berendsohn.

=== Politics ===
Haeckel&#x27;s affinity for the German Romantic movement, coupled with his acceptance of a form of Lamarckism, influenced his political beliefs. Rather than being a strict Darwinian, Haeckel believed that the characteristics of an organism were acquired through interactions with the environment and that ontogeny reflected phylogeny. He saw the social sciences as instances of &quot;applied biology&quot;, and that phrase was picked up and used for Nazi propaganda.

He was the first person to use the term &quot;first world war&quot; about World War I.

However, Haeckel&#x27;s books were banned by the Nazi Party, which refused Monism and Haeckel&#x27;s freedom of thought. Moreover, it is worth mentioning that Haeckel had often overtly recognized the great contribution of educated Jews to the German culture.

== Research ==
Haeckel was a zoologist, an accomplished artist and illustrator, and later a professor of comparative anatomy. Although Haeckel&#x27;s ideas are important to the history of evolutionary theory, and although he was a competent invertebrate anatomist most famous for his work on radiolaria, many speculative concepts that he championed are now considered incorrect. For example, Haeckel described and named hypothetical ancestral microorganisms that have never been found.

He was one of the first to consider psychology as a branch of physiology. He also proposed the kingdom &quot;Protista&quot; in 1866. His chief interests lay in evolution and life development processes in general, including development of nonrandom form, which culminated in the beautifully illustrated &quot;Kunstformen der Natur&quot; (&quot;Art forms of nature&quot;). Haeckel did not support natural selection, rather believing in Lamarckism.

Haeckel advanced a version of the earlier recapitulation theory previously set out by Étienne Serres in the 1820s and supported by followers of Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire including Robert Edmond Grant. It proposed a link between ontogeny (development of form) and phylogeny (evolutionary descent), summed up by Haeckel in the phrase &quot;ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny&quot;. His concept of recapitulation has been refuted in the form he gave it (now called &quot;strong recapitulation&quot;), in favour of the ideas first advanced by Karl Ernst von Baer. The strong recapitulation hypothesis views ontogeny as repeating forms of adult ancestors, while weak recapitulation means that what is repeated (and built upon) is the ancestral embryonic development process. Haeckel supported the theory with embryo drawings that have since been shown to be oversimplified and in part inaccurate, and the theory is now considered an oversimplification of quite complicated relationships, however comparison of embryos remains a powerful way to demonstrate that all animals are related. Haeckel introduced the concept of heterochrony, the change in timing of embryonic development over the course of evolution.

Haeckel was a flamboyant figure, who sometimes took great, non-scientific leaps from available evidence. For example, at the time when Darwin published &quot;On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection&quot; (1859), Haeckel postulated that evidence of human evolution would be found in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia). At that time, no remains of human ancestors had yet been identified. He described these theoretical remains in great detail and even named the as-yet unfound species, &quot;Pithecanthropus alalus&quot;, and instructed his students such as Richard and Oskar Hertwig to go and find it.

One student did find some remains: a Dutchman named Eugène Dubois searched the East Indies from 1887 to 1895, discovering the remains of Java Man in 1891, consisting of a skullcap, thighbone, and a few teeth. These remains are among the oldest hominid remains ever found. Dubois classified Java Man with Haeckel&#x27;s &quot;Pithecanthropus&quot; label, though they were later reclassified as &quot;Homo erectus&quot;. Some scientists of the day suggested Dubois&#x27; Java Man as a potential intermediate form between modern humans and the common ancestor we share with the other great apes. The current consensus of anthropologists is that the direct ancestors of modern humans were African populations of &quot;Homo erectus&quot; (possibly &quot;Homo ergaster&quot;), rather than the Asian populations exemplified by Java Man and Peking Man. (Ironically, a new human species, &quot;Homo floresiensis&quot;, a dwarf human type, has recently been discovered in the island of Flores).

== Polygenism and racial theory ==

The creationist polygenism of Samuel George Morton and Louis Agassiz, which presented human races as separately created species, was rejected by Charles Darwin, who argued for the monogenesis of the human species and the African origin of modern humans. Haeckel put forward a racist doctrine of evolutionary polygenism based on the ideas of the linguist August Schleicher, in which several different language groups had arisen separately from speechless prehuman &quot;Urmenschen&quot; (), which themselves had evolved from simian ancestors. These separate languages had completed the transition from animals to man, and under the influence of each main branch of languages, humans had evolved – in a kind of Lamarckian use-inheritance – as separate species, which could be subdivided into races. From this, Haeckel drew the implication that languages with the most potential yield the human races with the most potential, led by the Semitic and Indo-Germanic groups, with Berber, Jewish, Greco-Roman and Germanic varieties to the fore. As Haeckel stated:

Haeckel&#x27;s view can be seen as a forerunner of the views of Carleton Coon, who also believed that human races evolved independently and in parallel with each other. These ideas eventually fell from favour.

Haeckel also applied the hypothesis of polygenism to the modern diversity of human groups. He became a key figure in social darwinism and leading proponent of scientific racism, stating for instance:

Haeckel divided human beings into ten races, of which the Caucasian was the highest and the primitives were doomed to extinction. In his view, &#x27;Negroes&#x27; were savages and Whites were the most civilised: for instance, he claimed that &#x27;[t]he Negro&#x27; had stronger and more freely movable toes than any other race, which, he argued, was evidence of their being less evolved, and which led him to compare them to four-handed&quot; Apes&#x27;.

In his &quot;Ontogeny and Phylogeny&quot; Harvard paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould wrote: &quot;[Haeckel&#x27;s] evolutionary racism; his call to the German people for racial purity and unflinching devotion to a &#x27;just&#x27; state; his belief that harsh, inexorable laws of evolution ruled human civilization and nature alike, conferring upon favored races the right to dominate others ... all contributed to the rise of Nazism.&quot;

In his introduction to the Nazi party ideologue Alfred Rosenberg&#x27;s 1930 book, &quot;[The Myth of the Twentieth Century]&quot;, Peter Peel affirms that Rosenberg had indeed read Haeckel.

In the same line of thought, historian Daniel Gasman states that Haeckel&#x27;s ideology stimulated the birth of Fascist ideology in Italy and France.

However, in 2009 Robert J. Richards noted: &quot;Haeckel, on his travels to Ceylon and Indonesia, often formed closer and more intimate relations with natives, even members of the untouchable classes, than with the European colonials.&quot; and says the Nazis rejected Haeckel, since he opposed antisemitism, while supporting ideas they disliked (for instance atheism, feminism, internationalism, pacifism etc.).

The Jena Declaration, published by the German Zoological Society, rejects the idea of human &quot;races&quot; and distances itself from the racial theories of Ernst Haeckel and other 20th century scientists. It claims that genetic variation between human populations is smaller than within them, demonstrating that the biological concept of &quot;races&quot; is invalid. The statement highlights that there are no specific genes or genetic markers that match with conventional racial categorizations. It also indicates that the idea of &quot;races&quot; is based on racism rather than any scientific factuality.

=== Asia hypothesis ===

Haeckel claimed the origin of humanity was to be found in Asia: he believed that Hindustan (Indian subcontinent) was the actual location where the first humans had evolved. Haeckel argued that humans were closely related to the primates of Southeast Asia and rejected Darwin&#x27;s hypothesis of Africa.

Haeckel later claimed that the missing link was to be found on the lost continent of Lemuria located in the Indian Ocean. He believed that Lemuria was the home of the first humans and that Asia was the home of many of the earliest primates; he thus supported that Asia was the cradle of hominid evolution. Haeckel also claimed that Lemuria connected Asia and Africa, which allowed the migration of humans to the rest of the world.

In Haeckel&#x27;s book &quot;The History of Creation&quot; (1884) he included migration routes which he thought the first humans had used outside of Lemuria.

== Embryology and recapitulation theory ==

When Haeckel was a student in the 1850s he showed great interest in embryology, attending the rather unpopular lectures twice and in his notes sketched the visual aids: textbooks had few illustrations, and large format plates were used to show students how to see the tiny forms under a reflecting microscope, with the translucent tissues seen against a black background. Developmental series were used to show stages within a species, but inconsistent views and stages made it even more difficult to compare different species. It was agreed by all European evolutionists that all vertebrates looked very similar at an early stage, in what was thought of as a common ideal type, but there was a continuing debate from the 1820s between the Romantic recapitulation theory that human embryos developed through stages of the forms of all the major groups of adult animals, literally manifesting a sequence of organisms on a linear chain of being, and Karl Ernst von Baer&#x27;s opposing view, stated in von Baer&#x27;s laws of embryology, that the early general forms diverged into four major groups of specialised forms without ever resembling the adult of another species, showing affinity to an archetype but no relation to other types or any transmutation of species. By the time Haeckel was teaching he was able to use a textbook with woodcut illustrations written by his own teacher Albert von Kölliker, which purported to explain human development while also using other mammalian embryos to claim a coherent sequence. Despite the significance to ideas of transformism, this was not really polite enough for the new popular science writing, and was a matter for medical institutions and for experts who could make their own comparisons.

=== Darwin, Naturphilosophie and Lamarck ===

Darwin&#x27;s &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;, which made a powerful impression on Haeckel when he read it in 1864, was very cautious about the possibility of ever reconstructing the history of life, but did include a section reinterpreting von Baer&#x27;s embryology and revolutionising the field of study, concluding that &quot;Embryology rises greatly in interest, when we thus look at the embryo as a picture, more or less obscured, of the common parent-form of each great class of animals.&quot; It mentioned von Baer&#x27;s 1828 anecdote (misattributing it to Louis Agassiz) that at an early stage embryos were so similar that it could be impossible to tell whether an unlabelled specimen was of a mammal, a bird, or of a reptile, and Darwin&#x27;s own research using embryonic stages of barnacles to show that they are crustaceans, while cautioning against the idea that one organism or embryonic stage is &quot;higher&quot; or &quot;lower&quot;, or more or less evolved. Haeckel disregarded such caution, and in a year wrote his massive and ambitious &quot;Generelle Morphologie&quot;, published in 1866, presenting a revolutionary new synthesis of Darwin&#x27;s ideas with the German tradition of &quot;Naturphilosophie&quot; going back to Goethe and with the progressive evolutionism of Lamarck in what he called &quot;Darwinismus&quot;. He used morphology to reconstruct the evolutionary history of life, in the absence of fossil evidence using embryology as evidence of ancestral relationships. He invented new terms, including ontogeny and phylogeny, to present his evolutionised recapitulation theory that &quot;ontogeny recapitulated phylogeny&quot;. The two massive volumes sold poorly, and were heavy going: with his limited understanding of German, Darwin found them impossible to read. Haeckel&#x27;s publisher turned down a proposal for a &quot;strictly scholarly and objective&quot; second edition.

=== Embryological drawings ===
Haeckel&#x27;s aim was a reformed morphology with evolution as the organising principle of a cosmic synthesis unifying science, religion, and art. He was giving successful &quot;popular lectures&quot; on his ideas to students and townspeople in Jena, in an approach pioneered by his teacher Rudolf Virchow. To meet his publisher&#x27;s need for a popular work he used a student&#x27;s transcript of his lectures as the basis of his &quot;Natürliche Schöpfungsgeschichte&quot; of 1868, presenting a comprehensive presentation of evolution. In the Spring of that year he drew figures for the book, synthesising his views of specimens in Jena and published pictures to represent types. After publication he told a colleague that the images &quot;are completely exact, partly copied from nature, partly assembled from all illustrations of these early stages that have hitherto become known&quot;. There were various styles of embryological drawings at that time, ranging from more schematic representations to &quot;naturalistic&quot; illustrations of specific specimens. Haeckel believed privately that his figures were both exact and synthetic, and in public asserted that they were schematic like most figures used in teaching. The images were reworked to match in size and orientation, and though displaying Haeckel&#x27;s own views of essential features, they support von Baer&#x27;s concept that vertebrate embryos begin similarly and then diverge. Relating different images on a grid conveyed a powerful evolutionary message. As a book for the general public, it followed the common practice of not citing sources.
The book sold very well, and while some anatomical experts hostile to Haeckel&#x27;s evolutionary views expressed some private concerns that certain figures had been drawn rather freely, the figures showed what they already knew about similarities in embryos. The first published concerns came from Ludwig Rütimeyer, a professor of zoology and comparative anatomy at the University of Basel who had placed fossil mammals in an evolutionary lineage early in the 1860s and had been sent a complimentary copy. At the end of 1868 his review in the &quot;Archiv für Anthropologie&quot; wondered about the claim that the work was &quot;popular and scholarly&quot;, doubting whether the second was true, and expressed horror about such public discussion of man&#x27;s place in nature with illustrations such as the evolutionary trees being shown to non-experts. Though he made no suggestion that embryo illustrations should be directly based on specimens, to him the subject demanded the utmost &quot;scrupulosity and conscientiousness&quot; and an artist must &quot;not arbitrarily model or generalise his originals for speculative purposes&quot; which he considered proved by comparison with works by other authors. In particular, &quot;one and the same, moreover incorrectly interpreted woodcut, is presented to the reader three times in a row and with three different captions as [the] embryo of the dog, the chick, [and] the turtle&quot;. He accused Haeckel of &quot;playing fast and loose with the public and with science&quot;, and failing to live up to the obligation to the truth of every serious researcher. Haeckel responded with angry accusations of bowing to religious prejudice, but in the second (1870) edition changed the duplicated embryo images to a single image captioned &quot;embryo of a mammal or bird&quot;. Duplication using galvanoplastic stereotypes (clichés) was a common technique in textbooks, but not on the same page to represent different eggs or embryos. In 1891 Haeckel made the excuse that this &quot;extremely rash foolishness&quot; had occurred in undue haste but was &quot;bona fide&quot;, and since repetition of incidental details was obvious on close inspection, it is unlikely to have been intentional deception.

The revised 1870 second edition of 1,500 copies attracted more attention, being quickly followed by further revised editions with larger print runs as the book became a prominent part of the optimistic, nationalist, anticlerical &quot;culture of progress&quot; in Otto von Bismarck&#x27;s new German Empire. The similarity of early vertebrate embryos became common knowledge, and the illustrations were praised by experts such as Michael Foster of the University of Cambridge. In the introduction to his 1871 &quot;The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex&quot;, Darwin gave particular praise to Haeckel, writing that if &quot;Natürliche Schöpfungsgeschichte&quot; &quot;had appeared before my essay had been written, I should probably never have completed it&quot;. The first chapter included an illustration: &quot;As some of my readers may never have seen a drawing of an embryo, I have given one of man and another of a dog, at about the same early stage of development, carefully copied from two works of undoubted accuracy&quot; with a footnote citing the sources and noting that &quot;Häckel has also given analogous drawings in his &quot;Schöpfungsgeschichte.&quot;&quot; The fifth edition of Haeckel&#x27;s book appeared in 1874, with its frontispiece a heroic portrait of Haeckel himself, replacing the previous controversial image of the heads of apes and humans.

=== Controversy ===
Later in 1874, Haeckel&#x27;s simplified embryology textbook &quot;Anthropogenie&quot; made the subject into a battleground over Darwinism aligned with Bismarck&#x27;s &quot;Kulturkampf&quot; (&quot;culture struggle&quot;) against the Catholic Church. Haeckel took particular care over the illustrations, changing to the leading zoological publisher Wilhelm Engelmann of Leipzig and obtaining from them use of illustrations from their other textbooks as well as preparing his own drawings including a dramatic double page illustration showing &quot;early&quot;, &quot;somewhat later&quot; and &quot;still later&quot; stages of 8 different vertebrates. Though Haeckel&#x27;s views had attracted continuing controversy, there had been little dispute about the embryos and he had many expert supporters, but Wilhelm His revived the earlier criticisms and introduced new attacks on the 1874 illustrations. Others joined in: both expert anatomists and Catholic priests and supporters were politically opposed to Haeckel&#x27;s views. Specifically, Haeckel&#x27;s critics accused him of manipulating the embryo drawings to make the early stages of different species look more similar. They claimed that the drawings of four-week dog and human embryos had been copied without attribution from other sources, and changed by expanding dog&#x27;s head and reducing the human head, moving the eye, and exaggerating the size of the human tail. Haeckel himself considered the drawings stylized and illustrative, but his detractors considered them forgery and fraud.

While it has been widely claimed that Haeckel was charged with fraud by five professors and convicted by a university court at Jena, there does not appear to be an independently verifiable source for this claim. Recent analyses (Richardson 1998, Richardson and Keuck 2002) have found that some of the criticisms of Haeckel&#x27;s embryo drawings were legitimate, but others were unfounded. There were multiple versions of the embryo drawings, and Haeckel rejected the claims of fraud. It was later said that &quot;there is evidence of sleight of hand&quot; on both sides of the feud between Haeckel and Wilhelm His. Robert J. Richards, in a paper published in 2008, defends the case for Haeckel, shedding doubt against the fraud accusations based on the material used for comparison with what Haeckel could access at the time.

== Awards and honors ==
Haeckel was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1885. He was awarded the title of Excellency by Kaiser Wilhelm II in 1907 and the Linnean Society of London&#x27;s prestigious Darwin-Wallace Medal in 1908. In the United States, &quot;Mount Haeckel&quot;, a summit in the Eastern Sierra Nevada, overlooking the Evolution Basin, is named in his honour, as is another &quot;Mount Haeckel&quot;, a summit in New Zealand; and the asteroid 12323 Haeckel.

In Jena he is remembered with a monument at Herrenberg (erected in 1969), an exhibition at Ernst-Haeckel-Haus, and at the Jena Phyletic Museum, which continues to teach about evolution and share his work to this day.

The ratfish, &quot;Harriotta haeckeli&quot; is named in his honor.

The research vessel &quot;Ernst Haeckel&quot; is named in his honor.

In 1981, a botanical journal called &quot;Ernstia&quot; was started being published in the city of Maracay, Venezuela.

In 2013, &quot;Ernstia&quot;, a genus of calcareous sponges in the family Clathrinidae. The genus was erected to contain five species previously assigned to &quot;Clathrina&quot;. The genus name honors Ernst Haeckel for his contributions towards sponge taxonomy and phylogeny.

== Publications ==


Darwin&#x27;s 1859 book &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; had immense popular influence, but although its sales exceeded its publisher&#x27;s hopes it was a technical book rather than a work of popular science: long, difficult and with few illustrations. One of Haeckel&#x27;s books did a great deal to explain his version of &quot;Darwinism&quot; to the world. It was a bestselling, provocatively illustrated book in German, titled &quot;Natürliche Schöpfungsgeschichte&quot;, published in Berlin in 1868, and translated into English as &quot;The History of Creation&quot; in 1876. Until 1909, eleven editions had appeared, as well as 25 translations into other languages. The &quot;Natürliche Schöpfungsgeschichte&quot; cemented Haeckel&#x27;s reputation as one of Germany&#x27;s most forceful popularizers of science. His &quot;Welträthsel&quot; were reprinted ten times after the book&#x27;s first publication in 1899; ultimately, over 400,000 copies were sold.

Haeckel argued that human evolution consisted of precisely 22 phases, the 21st – the &quot;missing link&quot; – being a halfway step between apes and humans. He even formally named this missing link &quot;Pithecanthropus alalus&quot;, translated as &quot;ape man without speech&quot;.

Haeckel&#x27;s literary output was extensive, including many books, scientific papers, and illustrations.

== Assessments of potential influence on Nazism ==
Some historians have seen Haeckel&#x27;s social Darwinism as a forerunner to Nazi ideology. Others have denied the relationship altogether.

The evidence is in some respects ambiguous. On one hand, Haeckel was an advocate of scientific racism. He held that evolutionary biology had definitively proven that races were unequal in intelligence and ability, and that their lives were also of unequal value, e.g., &quot;These lower races (such as the Veddahs or Australian negroes) are psychologically nearer to the mammals (apes or dogs) than to civilised Europeans; we must therefore, assign a totally different value to their lives.&quot; As a result of the &quot;struggle for existence&quot;, it followed that the &quot;lower&quot; races would eventually be exterminated. He was also a social Darwinist who believed that &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; was a natural law, and that struggle led to improvement of the race. As an advocate of eugenics, he also believed that about 200,000 mentally and congenitally ill should be killed by a medical control board. This idea was later put into practice by Nazi Germany, as part of the Aktion T4 program. Alfred Ploetz, founder of the German Society for Racial Hygiene, praised Haeckel repeatedly, and invited him to become an honorary member. Haeckel accepted the invitation. Haeckel also believed that Germany should be governed by an authoritarian political system, and that inequalities both within and between societies were an inevitable product of evolutionary law. Haeckel was also an extreme German nationalist who believed strongly in the superiority of German culture.

On the other hand, Haeckel was not an anti-Semite. In the racial hierarchies he constructed Jews tended to appear closer to the top, rather than closer to the bottom as in Nazi racial thought. He was also a pacifist until the First World War, when he wrote propaganda in favor of the war. The principal arguments of historians who deny a meaningful connection between Haeckel and Nazism are that Haeckel&#x27;s ideas were very common at the time, that Nazis were much more strongly influenced by other thinkers, and that Haeckel is properly classified as a 19th-century German liberal, rather than a forerunner to Nazism. They also point to incompatibilities between evolutionary biology and Nazi ideology.

Nazis themselves divided on the question of whether Haeckel should be counted as a pioneer of their ideology. SS captain and biologist Heinz Brücher wrote a biography of Haeckel in 1936, in which he praised Haeckel as a &quot;pioneer in biological state thinking&quot;. This opinion was also shared by the scholarly journal, &quot;Der Biologe&quot;, which celebrated Haeckel&#x27;s 100th birthday, in 1934, with several essays acclaiming him as a pioneering thinker of Nazism. Other Nazis kept their distance from Haeckel. Nazi propaganda guidelines issued in 1935 listed books which popularized Darwin and evolution on an &quot;expunged list&quot;. Haeckel was included by name as a forbidden author. Gunther Hecht, a member of the Nazi Department of Race Politics, also issued a memorandum rejecting Haeckel as a forerunner of Nazism. Kurt Hildebrandt, a Nazi political philosopher, also rejected Haeckel. Eventually Haeckel was rejected by Nazi bureaucrats.

<doc id="9670" wikidata="Q1076026" url="?curid=9670" title="Evolutionism">
<text>Evolutionism is a term used (often derogatorily) to denote the theory of evolution. Its exact meaning has changed over time as the study of evolution has progressed. In the 19th century, it was used to describe the belief that organisms deliberately improved themselves through progressive inherited change (orthogenesis). The teleological belief went on to include cultural evolution and social evolution. In the 1970s, the term &quot;Neo-Evolutionism&quot; was used to describe the idea that &quot;human beings sought to preserve a familiar style of life unless change was forced on them by factors that were beyond their control.&quot;

The term is most often used by creationists to describe adherence to the scientific consensus on evolution as equivalent to a secular religion. The term is very seldom used within the scientific community, since the scientific position on evolution is accepted by the overwhelming majority of scientists. Because evolutionary biology is the default scientific position, it is assumed that &quot;scientists&quot; or &quot;biologists&quot; are &quot;evolutionists&quot; unless specifically noted otherwise. In the creation–evolution controversy, creationists often call those who accept the validity of the modern evolutionary synthesis &quot;evolutionists&quot; and the theory itself &quot;evolutionism&quot;.

==19th-century teleological use ==
Before its use to describe biological evolution, the term &quot;evolution&quot; was originally used to refer to any orderly sequence of events with the outcome somehow contained at the start. The first five editions of Darwin&#x27;s in &quot;Origin of Species&quot; used the word &quot;evolved&quot;, but the word &quot;evolution&quot; was only used in its sixth edition in 1872. By then, Herbert Spencer had developed the concept theory that organisms strive to evolve due to an internal &quot;driving force&quot; (orthogenesis) in 1862. Edward B. Tylor and Lewis H Morgan brought the term &quot;evolution&quot; to anthropology though they tended toward the older pre-Spencerian definition helping to form the concept of unilineal (social) evolution used during the later part of what Trigger calls the Antiquarianism-Imperial Synthesis period (c1770-c1900). The term evolutionism subsequently came to be used for the now discredited theory that evolution contained a deliberate component, rather than the selection of beneficial traits from random variation by differential survival.

==Modern use by creationists==
The term &quot;evolution&quot; is widely used, but the term &quot;evolutionism&quot; is not used in the scientific community to refer to evolutionary biology as it is redundant and anachronistic.

However, the term has been used by creationists in discussing the creation–evolution controversy. For example, the Institute for Creation Research, in order to imply placement of evolution in the category of &#x27;religions&#x27;, including atheism, fascism, humanism and occultism, commonly uses the words &quot;evolutionism&quot; and &quot;evolutionist&quot; to describe the consensus of mainstream science and the scientists subscribing to it, thus implying through language that the issue is a matter of religious belief. The BioLogos Foundation, an organization that promotes the idea of theistic evolution, uses the term &quot;evolutionism&quot; to describe &quot;the atheistic worldview that so often accompanies the acceptance of biological evolution in public discourse.&quot; It views this as a subset of scientism.

It asks for an algorithm that considers an inputted statement and answers &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; according to whether it is universally valid, i.e., valid in every structure. Such an algorithm was proven to be impossible by Alonzo Church and Alan Turing in 1936.

==Completeness theorem==
By the completeness theorem of first-order logic, a statement is universally valid if and only if it can be deduced using logical rules and axioms, so the &quot;&quot; can also be viewed as asking for an algorithm to decide whether a given statement is provable using the rules of logic.

In 1936, Alonzo Church and Alan Turing published independent papers showing that a general solution to the &quot;&quot; is impossible, assuming that the intuitive notion of &quot;effectively calculable&quot; is captured by the functions computable by a Turing machine (or equivalently, by those expressible in the lambda calculus). This assumption is now known as the Church–Turing thesis.

== History ==
The origin of the goes back to Gottfried Leibniz, who in the seventeenth century, after having constructed a successful mechanical calculating machine, dreamt of building a machine that could manipulate symbols in order to determine the truth values of mathematical statements. He realized that the first step would have to be a clean formal language, and much of his subsequent work was directed toward that goal. In 1928, David Hilbert and Wilhelm Ackermann posed the question in the form outlined above.

In continuation of his &quot;program&quot;, Hilbert posed three questions at an international conference in 1928, the third of which became known as &quot;Hilbert&#x27;s &quot;. In 1929, Moses Schönfinkel published one paper on special cases of the decision problem, that was prepared by Paul Bernays.

As late as 1930, Hilbert believed that there would be no such thing as an unsolvable problem.

== Negative answer ==
Before the question could be answered, the notion of &quot;algorithm&quot; had to be formally defined. This was done by Alonzo Church in 1935 with the concept of &quot;effective calculability&quot; based on his λ-calculus, and by Alan Turing the next year with his concept of Turing machines. Turing immediately recognized that these are equivalent models of computation.

A negative answer to the was then given by Alonzo Church in 1935–36 (Church&#x27;s theorem) and independently shortly thereafter by Alan Turing in 1936 (Turing&#x27;s proof). Church proved that there is no computable function which decides, for two given λ-calculus expressions, whether they are equivalent or not. He relied heavily on earlier work by Stephen Kleene. Turing reduced the question of the existence of an &#x27;algorithm&#x27; or &#x27;general method&#x27; able to solve the to the question of the existence of a &#x27;general method&#x27; which decides whether any given Turing machine halts or not (the halting problem). If &#x27;algorithm&#x27; is understood as meaning a method that can be represented as a Turing machine, and with the answer to the latter question negative (in general), the question about the existence of an algorithm for the also must be negative (in general). In his 1936 paper, Turing says: &quot;Corresponding to each computing machine &#x27;it&#x27; we construct a formula &#x27;Un(it)&#x27; and we show that, if there is a general method for determining whether &#x27;Un(it)&#x27; is provable, then there is a general method for determining whether &#x27;it&#x27; ever prints 0&quot;.

The work of both Church and Turing was heavily influenced by Kurt Gödel&#x27;s earlier work on his incompleteness theorem, especially by the method of assigning numbers (a Gödel numbering) to logical formulas in order to reduce logic to arithmetic.

The &quot;&quot; is related to Hilbert&#x27;s tenth problem, which asks for an algorithm to decide whether Diophantine equations have a solution. The non-existence of such an algorithm, established by the work of Yuri Matiyasevich, Julia Robinson, Martin Davis, and Hilary Putnam, with the final piece of the proof in 1970, also implies a negative answer to the &quot;Entscheidungsproblem&quot;.

== Generalizations ==
Using the deduction theorem, the Entscheidungsproblem encompasses the more general problem of deciding whether a given first-order sentence is entailed by a given finite set of sentences, but validity in first-order theories with infinitely many axioms cannot be directly reduced to the Entscheidungsproblem. Such more general decision problems are of practical interest. Some first-order theories are algorithmically decidable; examples of this include Presburger arithmetic, real closed fields, and static type systems of many programming languages. On the other hand, the first-order theory of the natural numbers with addition and multiplication expressed by Peano&#x27;s axioms cannot be decided with an algorithm.

== Fragments ==
By default, the citations in the section are from Pratt-Hartmann (2023).

The classical &quot;Entscheidungsproblem&quot; asks that, given a first-order formula, whether it is true in all models. The finitary problem asks whether it is true in all finite models. Trakhtenbrot&#x27;s theorem shows that this is also undecidable.

Some notations: formula_1 means the problem of deciding whether there exists a model for a set of logical formulas formula_2. formula_3 is the same problem, but for &quot;finite&quot; models. The formula_4-problem for a logical fragment is called decidable if there exists a program that can decide, for each formula_2 finite set of logical formulas in the fragment, whether formula_1 or not.

There is a hierarchy of decidabilities. On the top are the undecidable problems. Below it are the decidable problems. Furthermore, the decidable problems can be divided into a complexity hierarchy.

=== Aristotelian and relational ===
Aristotelian logic considers 4 kinds of sentences: &quot;All p are q&quot;, &quot;All p are not q&quot;, &quot;Some p is q&quot;, &quot;Some p is not q&quot;. We can formalize these kinds of sentences as a fragment of first-order logic:formula_7where formula_8 are atomic predicates, and formula_9. Given a finite set of Aristotelean logic formulas, it is NLOGSPACE-complete to decide its formula_4. It is also NLOGSPACE-complete to decide formula_4 for a slight extension (Theorem 2.7):formula_12Relational logic extends Aristotelean logic by allowing a relational predicate. For example, &quot;Everybody loves somebody&quot; can be written as formula_13. Generally, we have 8 kinds of sentences:formula_14It is NLOGSPACE-complete to decide its formula_4 (Theorem 2.15). Relational logic can be extended to 32 kinds of sentences by allowing formula_16, but this extension is EXPTIME-complete (Theorem 2.24).

=== Arity ===
The first-order logic fragment where the only variable names are formula_17 is NEXPTIME-complete (Theorem 3.18). With formula_18, it is RE-complete to decide its formula_4, and co-RE-complete to decide formula_20 (Theorem 3.15), thus undecidable.

The monadic predicate calculus is the fragment where each formula contains only 1-ary predicates and no function symbols. Its formula_4 is NEXPTIME-complete (Theorem 3.22).

=== Quantifier prefix ===
Any first-order formula has a prenex normal form. For each possible quantifier prefix to the prenex normal form, we have a fragment of first-order logic. For example, the Bernays–Schönfinkel class, formula_22, is the class of first-order formulas with quantifier prefix formula_23, equality symbols, and no function symbols.

For example, Turing&#x27;s 1936 paper (p. 263) observed that since the halting problem for each Turing machine is equivalent to a first-order logical formula of form formula_24, the problem formula_25 is undecidable.

The precise boundaries are known, sharply:

* formula_26 and formula_27are co-RE-complete, and the formula_20 problems are RE-complete (Theorem 5.2).
* Same for formula_29 (Theorem 5.3).
* formula_30 is decidable, proved independently by Gödel, Schütte, and Kalmár. 
* formula_31 is undecidable.
* For any formula_32, both formula_33 and formula_34 are NEXPTIME-complete (Theorem 5.1).
** This implies that formula_35 is decidable, a result first published by Bernays and Schönfinkel.
* For any formula_36, formula_37 is EXPTIME-complete (Section 5.4.1).
* For any formula_38, formula_39 is NEXPTIME-complete (Section 5.4.2).
** This implies that formula_40 is decidable, a result first published by Ackermann.
* For any formula_38, formula_42 and formula_43 are PSPACE-complete (Section 5.4.3).

Börger et al. (2001) describes the level of computational complexity for every possible fragment with every possible combination of quantifier prefix, functional arity, predicate arity, and equality/no-equality.

==Practical decision procedures==
Having practical decision procedures for classes of logical formulas is of considerable interest for program verification and circuit verification. Pure Boolean logical formulas are usually decided using SAT-solving techniques based on the DPLL algorithm.

For more general decision problems of first-order theories, conjunctive formulas over linear real or rational arithmetic can be decided using the simplex algorithm, formulas in linear integer arithmetic (Presburger arithmetic) can be decided using Cooper&#x27;s algorithm or William Pugh&#x27;s Omega test. Formulas with negations, conjunctions and disjunctions combine the difficulties of satisfiability testing with that of decision of conjunctions; they are generally decided nowadays using SMT-solving techniques, which combine SAT-solving with decision procedures for conjunctions and propagation techniques. Real polynomial arithmetic, also known as the theory of real closed fields, is decidable; this is the Tarski–Seidenberg theorem, which has been implemented in computers by using the cylindrical algebraic decomposition.

<doc id="9674" wikidata="Q154526" url="?curid=9674" title="Einhard">
<text>Einhard (also Eginhard or Einhart; ; 775 – 14 March 840) was a Frankish scholar and courtier. Einhard was a dedicated servant of Charlemagne and his son Louis the Pious; his main work is a biography of Charlemagne, the &quot;Vita Karoli Magni&quot;, &quot;one of the most precious literary bequests of the early Middle Ages&quot;.

==Public life==
Einhard was from the eastern German-speaking part of the Frankish Kingdom. Born into a family of landowners of some importance, his parents sent him to be educated by the monks of Fulda, one of the most impressive centers of learning in the Frank lands. Perhaps due to his small stature, which restricted his riding and sword-fighting ability, Einhard concentrated his energies on scholarship, especially the mastering of Latin. He was accepted into the hugely wealthy court of Charlemagne around 791 or 792. Charlemagne actively sought to amass scholarly men around him and established a royal school led by the Northumbrian scholar Alcuin. Einhard was evidently a talented builder and construction manager, because Charlemagne put him in charge of the completion of several palace complexes including Aachen and Ingelheim. Despite the fact that Einhard was on intimate terms with Charlemagne, he never achieved office in his reign. In 814, on Charlemagne&#x27;s death, his son Louis the Pious made Einhard his private secretary. Einhard retired from court during the time of the disputes between Louis and his sons in the spring of 830.

He died at Seligenstadt in 840.

==Private life==
Einhard was married to Emma, of whom little is known. There is a possibility that their marriage bore a son, Vussin. Their marriage also appears to have been exceptionally liberal for the period, with Emma being as active as Einhard, if not more so, in the handling of their property. It is said that in the later years of their marriage Emma and Einhard abstained from sexual relations, choosing instead to focus their attentions on their many religious commitments. Though he was undoubtedly devoted to her, Einhard wrote nothing of his wife until after her death on 13 December 835, when he wrote to a friend that he was reminded of her loss in ‘every day, in every action, in every undertaking, in all the administration of the house and household, in everything needing to be decided upon and sorted out in my religious and earthly responsibilities’.
==Religious beliefs==
Einhard made numerous references to himself as a &quot;sinner&quot; according to his strong Christian faith. He erected churches at both of his estates in Michelstadt and Mulinheim. In Michelstadt, he also saw fit to build a basilica completed in 827 and then sent a servant, Ratleic, to Rome with an end to find relics for the new building. Once in Rome, Ratleic robbed a catacomb of the bones of the Martyrs Marcellinus and Peter and had them translated to Michelstadt. Once there, the relics made it known they were unhappy with their new tomb and thus had to be moved again to Mulinheim. Once established there, they proved to be miracle workers. Although unsure as to why these saints should choose such a &quot;sinner&quot; as their patron, Einhard nonetheless set about ensuring they continued to receive a resting place fitting of their honour. Between 831 and 834 he founded a Benedictine Monastery and, after the death of his wife, served as its Abbot until his own death in 840.

==Local lore==
Local lore from Seligenstadt portrays Einhard as the lover of Emma, one of Charlemagne&#x27;s daughters, and has the couple elope from court. Charlemagne found them at Seligenstadt (then called Obermühlheim) and forgave them. This account is used to explain the name &quot;Seligenstadt&quot; by folk etymology. Einhard and his wife were originally buried in one sarcophagus in the choir of the church in Seligenstadt, but in 1810 the sarcophagus was presented by the Grand Duke of Hesse to the count of Erbach, who claims descent from Einhard as the husband of Imma, the reputed daughter of Charlemagne. The count put it in the famous chapel of his castle at Erbach in the Odenwald.

==Works==
The most famous of Einhard&#x27;s works is his biography of Charlemagne, the &quot;Vita Karoli Magni&quot;, &quot;The Life of Charlemagne&quot; (c. 817–836), which provides much direct information about Charlemagne&#x27;s life and character, written sometime between 817 and 830. In composing this he relied heavily upon the Royal Frankish Annals. Einhard&#x27;s literary model was the classical work of the Roman historian Suetonius, the &quot;Lives of the Caesars&quot;, though it is important to stress that the work is very much Einhard&#x27;s own, that is to say he adapts the models and sources for his own purposes. His work was written as a praise of Charlemagne, whom he regarded as a foster-father (&quot;nutritor&quot;) and to whom he was a debtor &quot;in life and death&quot;. The work thus contains an understandable degree of bias, Einhard taking care to exculpate Charlemagne in some matters, not mention others, and to gloss over certain issues which would be of embarrassment to Charlemagne, such as the morality of his daughters; by contrast, other issues are curiously not glossed over, like his concubines. 

Einhard is also responsible for three other extant works: a collection of letters, &quot;On the Translations and the Miracles of SS. Marcellinus and Petrus&quot;, and &quot;On the Adoration of the Cross&quot;. The latter dates from ca. 830 and was not rediscovered until 1885, when Ernst Dümmler identified a text in a manuscript in Vienna as the missing &quot;Libellus de adoranda cruce&quot;, which Einhard had dedicated to his pupil Lupus Servatus.

The Arch of Einhard was a reliquary made by Einhard, which reproduced on a small scale a Roman triumphal arch that represented the victory of Christianity. It has not survived.

<text>In chemistry, an ester is a compound derived from an acid (organic or inorganic) in which the hydrogen atom (H) of at least one acidic hydroxyl group () of that acid is replaced by an organyl group (R). These compounds contain a distinctive functional group. Analogues derived from oxygen replaced by other chalcogens belong to the ester category as well. According to some authors, organyl derivatives of acidic hydrogen of other acids are esters as well (e.g. amides), but not according to the IUPAC.

Glycerides are fatty acid esters of glycerol; they are important in biology, being one of the main classes of lipids and comprising the bulk of animal fats and vegetable oils. Lactones are cyclic carboxylic esters; naturally occurring lactones are mainly 5- and 6-membered ring lactones. Lactones contribute to the aroma of fruits, butter, cheese, vegetables like celery and other foods.

Esters can be formed from oxoacids (e.g. esters of acetic acid, carbonic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid, xanthic acid), but also from acids that do not contain oxygen (e.g. esters of thiocyanic acid and trithiocarbonic acid). An example of an ester formation is the substitution reaction between a carboxylic acid () and an alcohol (), forming an ester (), where R stands for any group (typically hydrogen or organyl) and R stands for organyl group.

Organyl esters of carboxylic acids typically have a pleasant smell; those of low molecular weight are commonly used as fragrances and are found in essential oils and pheromones. They perform as high-grade solvents for a broad array of plastics, plasticizers, resins, and lacquers, and are one of the largest classes of synthetic lubricants on the commercial market. Polyesters are important plastics, with monomers linked by ester moieties. Esters of phosphoric acid form the backbone of DNA molecules. Esters of nitric acid, such as nitroglycerin, are known for their explosive properties.

There are compounds in which an acidic hydrogen of acids mentioned in this article are not replaced by an organyl, but by some other group. According to some authors, those compounds are esters as well, especially when the first carbon atom of the organyl group replacing acidic hydrogen, is replaced by another atom from the group 14 elements (Si, Ge, Sn, Pb); for example, according to them, trimethylstannyl acetate (or trimethyltin acetate) is a trimethylstannyl ester of acetic acid, and dibutyltin dilaurate is a dibutylstannylene ester of lauric acid, and the Phillips catalyst is a trimethoxysilyl ester of chromic acid ().
== Nomenclature ==

=== Etymology ===
The word &quot;ester&quot; was coined in 1848 by a German chemist Leopold Gmelin, probably as a contraction of the German , &quot;acetic ether&quot;.

=== IUPAC nomenclature ===

The names of esters that are formed from an alcohol and an acid, are derived from the parent alcohol and the parent acid, where the latter may be organic or inorganic. Esters derived from the simplest carboxylic acids are commonly named according to the more traditional, so-called &quot;trivial names&quot; e.g. as formate, acetate, propionate, and butyrate, as opposed to the IUPAC nomenclature methanoate, ethanoate, propanoate, and butanoate. Esters derived from more complex carboxylic acids are, on the other hand, more frequently named using the systematic IUPAC name, based on the name for the acid followed by the suffix &quot;-oate&quot;. For example, the ester hexyl octanoate, also known under the trivial name hexyl caprylate, has the formula .

The chemical formulas of organic esters formed from carboxylic acids and alcohols usually take the form or RCOOR&#x27;, where R and R&#x27; are the organyl parts of the carboxylic acid and the alcohol, respectively, and R can be a hydrogen in the case of esters of formic acid. For example, butyl acetate (systematically butyl ethanoate), derived from butanol and acetic acid (systematically ethanoic acid) would be written . Alternative presentations are common including BuOAc and .

Cyclic esters are called lactones, regardless of whether they are derived from an organic or inorganic acid. One example of an organic lactone is γ-valerolactone.

=== Orthoesters ===
An uncommon class of esters are the orthoesters. One of them are the esters of orthocarboxylic acids. Those esters have the formula , where R stands for any group (organic or inorganic) and R stands for organyl group. For example, triethyl orthoformate () is derived, in terms of its name (but not its synthesis) from esterification of orthoformic acid () with ethanol.

===Esters of inorganic acids===

Esters can also be derived from inorganic acids.
*Perchloric acid forms perchlorate esters, e.g., methyl perchlorate ()
*Sulfuric acid forms sulfate esters, e.g., dimethyl sulfate () and methyl bisulfate ()
*Nitric acid forms nitrate esters, e.g. methyl nitrate () and nitroglycerin ()
*Phosphoric acid forms phosphate esters, e.g. triphenyl phosphate () and methyl dihydrogen phosphate ()
**Pyrophosphoric (diphosphoric) acid forms pyrophosphate esters, e.g. tetraethyl pyrophosphate, ADP, dADP, ADPR, cADPR, CDP, dCDP, GDP, dGDP, UDP, dTDP, MEcPP, HMBPP, DMAPP, IPP, GPP, FPP, GGPP, ThDP, FAD, NAD, NADP.
**Triphosphoric acid forms triphosphate esters, e.g. ATP, dATP, CTP, dCTP, GTP, dGTP, UTP, dTTP, ITP, XTP, ThTP, AThTP.
**Tetraphosphoric acid forms tetraphosphate esters, e.g. hexaethyl tetraphosphate, adenosine tetraphosphate (ATPP, Ap4), Ap4A.
*Carbonic acid forms carbonate esters, e.g. dimethyl carbonate () and 5-membered cyclic ethylene carbonate () (if one classifies carbonic acid as an inorganic compound)
*Trithiocarbonic acid forms trithiocarbonate esters, e.g. dimethyl trithiocarbonate () (if one classifies trithiocarbonic acid as an inorganic compound)
*Chloroformic acid forms chloroformate esters, e.g. methyl chloroformate () (if one classifies chloroformic acid as an inorganic compound)
*Boric acid forms borate esters, e.g. trimethyl borate ()
*Chromic acid forms di-&quot;tert&quot;-butyl chromate ()

Inorganic acids that exist as tautomers form two or more types of esters.
*Thiosulfuric acid forms two types of thiosulfate esters, e.g. &quot;O&quot;,&quot;O&quot;-dimethyl thiosulfate () and &quot;O&quot;,&quot;S&quot;-dimethyl thiosulfate ()
*Thiocyanic acid forms thiocyanate esters, e.g. methyl thiocyanate () (if one classifies thiocyanic acid as an inorganic compound), but forms isothiocyanate &quot;esters&quot; as well, e.g. methyl isothiocyanate (), although organyl isothiocyanates are not classified as esters by the IUPAC
*Phosphorous acid forms two types of esters: phosphite esters, e.g. triethyl phosphite (), and phosphonate esters, e.g. diethyl phosphonate ()

Some inorganic acids that are unstable or elusive form stable esters.
*Sulfurous acid, which is unstable, forms stable dimethyl sulfite ()
*Dicarbonic acid, which is unstable, forms stable dimethyl dicarbonate ()

In principle, a part of metal and metalloid alkoxides, of which many hundreds are known, could be classified as esters of the corresponding acids (e.g., aluminium triethoxide () could be classified as an ester of aluminic acid which is aluminium hydroxide, tetraethyl orthosilicate () could be classified as an ester of orthosilicic acid, and titanium ethoxide () could be classified as an ester of orthotitanic acid).

== Structure and bonding ==
Esters derived from carboxylic acids and alcohols contain a carbonyl group C=O, which is a divalent group at C atom, which gives rise to C–C–O and O–C–O angles. Unlike amides, carboxylic acid esters are structurally flexible functional groups because rotation about the C–O–C bonds has a low barrier. Their flexibility and low polarity is manifested in their physical properties; they tend to be less rigid (lower melting point) and more volatile (lower boiling point) than the corresponding amides. The p&quot;K&quot;a of the alpha-hydrogens on esters of carboxylic acids is around 25 (alpha-hydrogen is a hydrogen bound to the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O) of carboxylate esters).

Many carboxylic acid esters have the potential for conformational isomerism, but they tend to adopt an &quot;S&quot;-&quot;cis&quot; (or &quot;Z&quot;) conformation rather than the &quot;S&quot;-&quot;trans&quot; (or &quot;E&quot;) alternative, due to a combination of hyperconjugation and dipole minimization effects. The preference for the &quot;Z&quot; conformation is influenced by the nature of the substituents and solvent, if present. Lactones with small rings are restricted to the &quot;s&quot;-trans (i.e. &quot;E&quot;) conformation due to their cyclic structure.


== Physical properties and characterization ==
Esters derived from carboxylic acids and alcohols are more polar than ethers but less polar than alcohols. They participate in hydrogen bonds as hydrogen-bond acceptors, but cannot act as hydrogen-bond donors, unlike their parent alcohols. This ability to participate in hydrogen bonding confers some water-solubility. Because of their lack of hydrogen-bond-donating ability, esters do not self-associate. Consequently, esters are more volatile than carboxylic acids of similar molecular weight.

=== Characterization and analysis ===
Esters are generally identified by gas chromatography, taking advantage of their volatility. IR spectra for esters feature an intense sharp band in the range 1730–1750 cm−1 assigned to &quot;ν&quot;C=O. This peak changes depending on the functional groups attached to the carbonyl. For example, a benzene ring or double bond in conjunction with the carbonyl will bring the wavenumber down about 30 cm−1.

== Applications and occurrence ==
Esters are widespread in nature and are widely used in industry. In nature, fats are, in general, triesters derived from glycerol and fatty acids. Esters are responsible for the aroma of many fruits, including apples, durians, pears, bananas, pineapples, and strawberries. Several billion kilograms of polyesters are produced industrially annually, important products being polyethylene terephthalate, acrylate esters, and cellulose acetate.

== Preparation ==
Esterification is the general name for a chemical reaction in which two reactants (typically an alcohol and an acid) form an ester as the reaction product. Esters are common in organic chemistry and biological materials, and often have a pleasant characteristic, fruity odor. This leads to their extensive use in the fragrance and flavor industry. Ester bonds are also found in many polymers.

===Esterification of carboxylic acids with alcohols===
The classic synthesis is the Fischer esterification, which involves treating a carboxylic acid with an alcohol in the presence of a dehydrating agent:
The equilibrium constant for such reactions is about 5 for typical esters, e.g., ethyl acetate. The reaction is slow in the absence of a catalyst. Sulfuric acid is a typical catalyst for this reaction. Many other acids are also used such as polymeric sulfonic acids. Since esterification is highly reversible, the yield of the ester can be improved using Le Chatelier&#x27;s principle:
* Using the alcohol in large excess (i.e., as a solvent).
* Using a dehydrating agent: sulfuric acid not only catalyzes the reaction but sequesters water (a reaction product). Other drying agents such as molecular sieves are also effective.
* Removal of water by physical means such as distillation as a low-boiling azeotrope with toluene, in conjunction with a Dean-Stark apparatus.

Reagents are known that drive the dehydration of mixtures of alcohols and carboxylic acids. One example is the Steglich esterification, which is a method of forming esters under mild conditions. The method is popular in peptide synthesis, where the substrates are sensitive to harsh conditions like high heat. DCC (dicyclohexylcarbodiimide) is used to activate the carboxylic acid to further reaction. 4-Dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) is used as an acyl-transfer catalyst.

Another method for the dehydration of mixtures of alcohols and carboxylic acids is the Mitsunobu reaction:

Carboxylic acids can be esterified using diazomethane:
Using this diazomethane, mixtures of carboxylic acids can be converted to their methyl esters in near quantitative yields, e.g., for analysis by gas chromatography. The method is useful in specialized organic synthetic operations but is considered too hazardous and expensive for large-scale applications.

===Esterification of carboxylic acids with epoxides===
Carboxylic acids are esterified by treatment with epoxides, giving β-hydroxyesters:
This reaction is employed in the production of vinyl ester resin from acrylic acid.

=== Alcoholysis of acyl chlorides and acid anhydrides ===
Alcohols react with acyl chlorides and acid anhydrides to give esters:
:

The reactions are irreversible simplifying work-up. Since acyl chlorides and acid anhydrides also react with water, anhydrous conditions are preferred. The analogous acylations of amines to give amides are less sensitive because amines are stronger nucleophiles and react more rapidly than does water. This method is employed only for laboratory-scale procedures, as it is expensive.

===Alkylation of carboxylic acids and their salts===
Trimethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate can be used for esterification of carboxylic acids under conditions where acid-catalyzed reactions are infeasible:
Although rarely employed for esterifications, carboxylate salts (often generated &quot;in situ&quot;) react with electrophilic alkylating agents, such as alkyl halides, to give esters. Anion availability can inhibit this reaction, which correspondingly benefits from phase transfer catalysts or such highly polar aprotic solvents as DMF. An additional iodide salt may, via the Finkelstein reaction, catalyze the reaction of a recalcitrant alkyl halide. Alternatively, salts of a coordinating metal, such as silver, may improve the reaction rate by easing halide elimination.

===Transesterification===
Transesterification, which involves changing one ester into another one, is widely practiced:
Like the hydrolysation, transesterification is catalysed by acids and bases. The reaction is widely used for degrading triglycerides, e.g. in the production of fatty acid esters and alcohols. Poly(ethylene terephthalate) is produced by the transesterification of dimethyl terephthalate and ethylene glycol: 

A subset of transesterification is the alcoholysis of diketene. This reaction affords 2-ketoesters.

===Carbonylation===
Alkenes undergo carboalkoxylation in the presence of metal carbonyl catalysts. Esters of propanoic acid are produced commercially by this method:
A preparation of methyl propionate is one illustrative example. 

The carbonylation of methanol yields methyl formate, which is the main commercial source of formic acid. The reaction is catalyzed by sodium methoxide:

===Addition of carboxylic acids to alkenes and alkynes===
In hydroesterification, alkenes and alkynes insert into the bond of carboxylic acids. Vinyl acetate is produced industrially by the addition of acetic acid to acetylene in the presence of zinc acetate catalysts:

Vinyl acetate can also be produced by palladium-catalyzed reaction of ethylene, acetic acid, and oxygen:

Silicotungstic acid is used to manufacture ethyl acetate by the alkylation of acetic acid by ethylene:

===From aldehydes===
The Tishchenko reaction involves disproportionation of an aldehyde in the presence of an anhydrous base to give an ester. Catalysts are aluminium alkoxides or sodium alkoxides. Benzaldehyde reacts with sodium benzyloxide (generated from sodium and benzyl alcohol) to generate benzyl benzoate. The method is used in the production of ethyl acetate from acetaldehyde.

=== Other methods ===
* Favorskii rearrangement of α-haloketones in presence of base
* Baeyer–Villiger oxidation of ketones with peroxides
* Pinner reaction of nitriles with an alcohol
* Nucleophilic abstraction of a metal–acyl complex
*Hydrolysis of orthoesters in aqueous acid
*Cellulolysis via esterification
* Ozonolysis of alkenes using a work up in the presence of hydrochloric acid and various alcohols.
* Anodic oxidation of methyl ketones leading to methyl esters.
* Interesterification exchanges the fatty acid groups of different esters.

== Reactions ==
Esters are less reactive than acid halides and anhydrides. As with more reactive acyl derivatives, they can react with ammonia and primary and secondary amines to give amides, although this type of reaction is not often used, since acid halides give better yields. 

===Transesterification===
Esters can be converted to other esters in a process known as transesterification. Transesterification can be either acid- or base-catalyzed, and involves the reaction of an ester with an alcohol. Unfortunately, because the leaving group is also an alcohol, the forward and reverse reactions will often occur at similar rates. Using a large excess of the reactant alcohol or removing the leaving group alcohol (e.g. via distillation) will drive the forward reaction towards completion, in accordance with Le Chatelier&#x27;s principle.

===Hydrolysis and saponification===

Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of esters is also an equilibrium process – essentially the reverse of the Fischer esterification reaction. Because an alcohol (which acts as the leaving group) and water (which acts as the nucleophile) have similar p&quot;K&quot;a values, the forward and reverse reactions compete with each other. As in transesterification, using a large excess of reactant (water) or removing one of the products (the alcohol) can promote the forward reaction.

Basic hydrolysis of esters, known as saponification, is not an equilibrium process; a full equivalent of base is consumed in the reaction, which produces one equivalent of alcohol and one equivalent of a carboxylate salt. The saponification of esters of fatty acids is an industrially important process, used in the production of soap.

Esterification is a reversible reaction. Esters undergo hydrolysis under acidic and basic conditions. Under acidic conditions, the reaction is the reverse reaction of the Fischer esterification. Under basic conditions, hydroxide acts as a nucleophile, while an alkoxide is the leaving group. This reaction, saponification, is the basis of soap making.

The alkoxide group may also be displaced by stronger nucleophiles such as ammonia or primary or secondary amines to give amides (ammonolysis reaction):
This reaction is not usually reversible. Hydrazines and hydroxylamine can be used in place of amines. Esters can be converted to isocyanates through intermediate hydroxamic acids in the Lossen rearrangement.

Sources of carbon nucleophiles, e.g., Grignard reagents and organolithium compounds, add readily to the carbonyl.

=== Reduction ===
Compared to ketones and aldehydes, esters are relatively resistant to reduction. The introduction of catalytic hydrogenation in the early part of the 20th century was a breakthrough; esters of fatty acids are hydrogenated to fatty alcohols.
A typical catalyst is copper chromite. Prior to the development of catalytic hydrogenation, esters were reduced on a large scale using the Bouveault–Blanc reduction. This method, which is largely obsolete, uses sodium in the presence of proton sources.

Especially for fine chemical syntheses, lithium aluminium hydride is used to reduce esters to two primary alcohols. The related reagent sodium borohydride is slow in this reaction. DIBAH reduces esters to aldehydes.

Direct reduction to give the corresponding ether is difficult as the intermediate hemiacetal tends to decompose to give an alcohol and an aldehyde (which is rapidly reduced to give a second alcohol). The reaction can be achieved using triethylsilane with a variety of Lewis acids.

=== Claisen condensation and related reactions ===
Esters can undergo a variety of reactions with carbon nucleophiles. They react with an excess of a Grignard reagent to give tertiary alcohols. Esters also react readily with enolates. In the Claisen condensation, an enolate of one ester (1) will attack the carbonyl group of another ester (2) to give tetrahedral intermediate 3. The intermediate collapses, forcing out an alkoxide (R&#x27;O−) and producing β-keto ester 4.

Crossed Claisen condensations, in which the enolate and nucleophile are different esters, are also possible. An intramolecular Claisen condensation is called a Dieckmann condensation or Dieckmann cyclization, since it can be used to form rings. Esters can also undergo condensations with ketone and aldehyde enolates to give β-dicarbonyl compounds. A specific example of this is the Baker–Venkataraman rearrangement, in which an aromatic &quot;ortho&quot;-acyloxy ketone undergoes an intramolecular nucleophilic acyl substitution and subsequent rearrangement to form an aromatic β-diketone. The Chan rearrangement is another example of a rearrangement resulting from an intramolecular nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction.

===Other ester reactivities===
Esters react with nucleophiles at the carbonyl carbon. The carbonyl is weakly electrophilic but is attacked by strong nucleophiles (amines, alkoxides, hydride sources, organolithium compounds, etc.). The C–H bonds adjacent to the carbonyl are weakly acidic but undergo deprotonation with strong bases. This process is the one that usually initiates condensation reactions. The carbonyl oxygen in esters is weakly basic, less so than the carbonyl oxygen in amides due to resonance donation of an electron pair from nitrogen in amides, but forms adducts.

As for aldehydes, the hydrogen atoms on the carbon adjacent (&quot;α to&quot;) the carboxyl group in esters are sufficiently acidic to undergo deprotonation, which in turn leads to a variety of useful reactions. Deprotonation requires relatively strong bases, such as alkoxides. Deprotonation gives a nucleophilic enolate, which can further react, e.g., the Claisen condensation and its intramolecular equivalent, the Dieckmann condensation. This conversion is exploited in the malonic ester synthesis, wherein the diester of malonic acid reacts with an electrophile (e.g., alkyl halide), and is subsequently decarboxylated. Another variation is the Fráter–Seebach alkylation.

=== Other reactions ===

* Esters can be directly converted to nitriles.
* Methyl esters are often susceptible to decarboxylation in the Krapcho decarboxylation.
* Phenyl esters react to hydroxyarylketones in the Fries rearrangement.
* Specific esters are functionalized with an α-hydroxyl group in the Chan rearrangement.
* Esters with β-hydrogen atoms can be converted to alkenes in ester pyrolysis.
* Pairs of esters are coupled to give α-hydroxyketones in the acyloin condensation

=== Protecting groups ===
As a class, esters serve as protecting groups for carboxylic acids. Protecting a carboxylic acid is useful in peptide synthesis, to prevent self-reactions of the bifunctional amino acids. Methyl and ethyl esters are commonly available for many amino acids; the &quot;t&quot;-butyl ester tends to be more expensive. However, &quot;t&quot;-butyl esters are particularly useful because, under strongly acidic conditions, the &quot;t&quot;-butyl esters undergo elimination to give the carboxylic acid and isobutylene, simplifying work-up.

== List of ester odorants ==
Many esters have distinctive fruit-like odors, and many occur naturally in the essential oils of plants. This has also led to their common use in artificial flavorings and fragrances which aim to mimic those odors.

<text>An endosymbiont or endobiont is an organism that lives within the body or cells of another organism. Typically the two organisms are in a mutualistic relationship. Examples are nitrogen-fixing bacteria (called rhizobia), which live in the root nodules of legumes, single-cell algae inside reef-building corals, and bacterial endosymbionts that provide essential nutrients to insects.

Endosymbiosis played key roles in the development of eukaryotes and plants. Roughly 2.2 billion years ago an archaeon absorbed a bacterium through phagocytosis, that eventually became the mitochondria that provide energy to almost all living eukaryotic cells. Approximately 1 billion years ago, some of those cells absorbed cyanobacteria that eventually became chloroplasts, organelles that produce energy from sunlight. Approximately 100 million years ago, a lineage of amoeba in the genus &quot;Paulinella&quot; independently engulfed a cyanobacteria that evolved to be functionally synonymous with traditional chloroplasts, called chromatophores.

Some 100 million years ago, UCYN-A, a nitrogen-fixing bacterium, became an endosymbiont of the marine alga &quot;Braarudosphaera bigelowii&quot;, eventually evolving into a nitroplast, which fixes nitrogen. Similarly, diatoms in the family &quot;Rhopalodiaceae&quot; have cyanobacterial endosymbionts, called spheroid bodies or diazoplasts, which have been proposed to be in the early stages of organelle evolution.

Symbionts are either obligate (require their host to survive) or facultative (can survive independently). The most common examples of obligate endosymbiosis are mitochondria and chloroplasts; however, they do not reproduce via mitosis in tandem with their host cells. Instead, they replicate via binary fission, a replication process uncoupled from the host cells in which they reside. Some human parasites, e.g. &quot;Wuchereria bancrofti&quot; and &quot;Mansonella perstans&quot;, thrive in their intermediate insect hosts because of an obligate endosymbiosis with &quot;Wolbachia&quot; spp. They can both be eliminated by treatments that target their bacterial host.

== Etymology ==
Endosymbiosis comes from the Greek: ἔνδον &quot;endon&quot; &quot;within&quot;, σύν &quot;syn&quot; &quot;together&quot; and βίωσις &quot;biosis&quot; &quot;living&quot;.

== Symbiogenesis ==
Symbiogenesis theory holds that eukaryotes evolved via absorbing prokaryotes. Typically, one organism envelopes a bacterium and the two evolve a mutualistic relationship. The absorbed bacteria (the endosymbiont) eventually lives exclusively within the host cells. This fits the concept of observed organelle development.

Typically the endosymbiont&#x27;s genome shrinks, discarding genes whose roles are displaced by the host. For example, the &quot;Hodgkinia&quot; genome of &quot;Magicicada&quot; cicadas is much different from the prior freestanding bacteria. The cicada life cycle involves years of stasis underground. The symbiont produces many generations during this phase, experiencing little selection pressure, allowing their genomes to diversify. Selection is episodic (when the cicadas reproduce). The original &quot;Hodgkinia&quot; genome split into three much simpler endosymbionts, each encoding only a few genes—an instance of punctuated equilibrium producing distinct lineages. The host requires all three symbionts.

== Transmission ==
Symbiont transmission is the process where the host acquires its symbiont. Since symbionts are not produced by host cells, they must find their own way to reproduce and populate daughter cells as host cells divide. Horizontal, vertical, and mixed-mode (hybrid of horizonal and vertical) transmission are the three paths for symbiont transfer.

=== Horizontal ===
Horizontal symbiont transfer (horizontal transmission) is a process where a host acquires a facultative symbiont from the environment or another host. The Rhizobia-Legume symbiosis (bacteria-plant endosymbiosis) is a prime example of this modality. The Rhizobia-legume symbiotic relationship is important for processes such as the formation of root nodules. It starts with flavonoids released by the legume host, which causes the rhizobia species (endosymbiont) to activate its &quot;Nod&quot; genes. These &quot;Nod&quot; genes generate lipooligosaccharide signals that the legume detects, leading to root nodule formation. This process bleeds into other processes such as nitrogen fixation in plants. The evolutionary advantage of such an interaction allows genetic exchange between both organisms involved to increase the propensity for novel functions as seen in the plant-bacterium interaction (holobiont formation).

=== Vertical ===
Vertical transmission takes place when the symbiont moves directly from parent to offspring. In horizontal transmission each generation acquires symbionts from the environment. An example is nitrogen-fixing bacteria in certain plant roots, such as pea aphid symbionts. A third type is mixed-mode transmission, where symbionts move horizontally for some generations, after which they are acquired vertically.

&quot;Wigglesworthia,&quot; a tsetse fly symbiont, is vertically transmitted (via mother&#x27;s milk). In vertical transmission, the symbionts do not need to survive independently, often leading them to have a reduced genome. For instance, pea aphid symbionts have lost genes for essential molecules and rely on the host to supply them. In return, the symbionts synthesize essential amino acids for the aphid host. When a symbiont reaches this stage, it begins to resemble a cellular organelle, similar to mitochondria or chloroplasts. Such dependent hosts and symbionts form a holobiont. In the event of a bottleneck, a decrease in symbiont diversity could compromise host-symbiont interactions, as deleterious mutations accumulate.

==Hosts==

=== Invertebrates ===
The best-studied examples of endosymbiosis are in invertebrates. These symbioses affect organisms with global impact, including &quot;Symbiodinium&quot; (corals), or &quot;Wolbachia&quot; (insects). Many insect agricultural pests and human disease vectors have intimate relationships with primary endosymbionts.

==== Insects ====
Scientists classify insect endosymbionts as Primary or Secondary. Primary endosymbionts (P-endosymbionts) have been associated with their insect hosts for millions of years (from ten to several hundred million years). They form obligate associations and display cospeciation with their insect hosts. Secondary endosymbionts more recently associated with their hosts, may be horizontally transferred, live in the hemolymph of the insects (not specialized bacteriocytes, see below), and are not obligate.

===== Primary =====
Among primary endosymbionts of insects, the best-studied are the pea aphid (&quot;Acyrthosiphon pisum&quot;) and its endosymbiont &quot;Buchnera sp.&quot; APS, the tsetse fly &quot;Glossina morsitans morsitans&quot; and its endosymbiont &quot;Wigglesworthia glossinidia brevipalpis&quot; and the endosymbiotic protists in lower termites. As with endosymbiosis in other insects, the symbiosis is obligate. Nutritionally-enhanced diets allow symbiont-free specimens to survive, but they are unhealthy, and at best survive only a few generations.

In some insect groups, these endosymbionts live in specialized insect cells called bacteriocytes (also called &quot;mycetocytes&quot;), and are maternally-transmitted, i.e. the mother transmits her endosymbionts to her offspring. In some cases, the bacteria are transmitted in the egg, as in &quot;Buchnera&quot;; in others like &quot;Wigglesworthia&quot;, they are transmitted via milk to the embryo. In termites, the endosymbionts reside within the hindguts and are transmitted through trophallaxis among colony members.

Primary endosymbionts are thought to help the host either by providing essential nutrients or by metabolizing insect waste products into safer forms. For example, the putative primary role of &quot;Buchnera&quot; is to synthesize essential amino acids that the aphid cannot acquire from its diet of plant sap. The primary role of &quot;Wigglesworthia&quot; is to synthesize vitamins that the tsetse fly does not get from the blood that it eats. In lower termites, the endosymbiotic protists play a major role in the digestion of lignocellulosic materials that constitute a bulk of the termites&#x27; diet.

Bacteria benefit from the reduced exposure to predators and competition from other bacterial species, the ample supply of nutrients and relative environmental stability inside the host.

Primary endosymbionts of insects have among the smallest of known bacterial genomes and have lost many genes commonly found in closely related bacteria. One theory claimed that some of these genes are not needed in the environment of the host insect cell. A complementary theory suggests that the relatively small numbers of bacteria inside each insect decrease the efficiency of natural selection in &#x27;purging&#x27; deleterious mutations and small mutations from the population, resulting in a loss of genes over many millions of years. Research in which a parallel phylogeny of bacteria and insects was inferred supports the assumption hat primary endosymbionts are transferred only vertically.

Attacking obligate bacterial endosymbionts may present a way to control their hosts, many of which are pests or human disease carriers. For example, aphids are crop pests and the tsetse fly carries the organism &quot;Trypanosoma brucei&quot; that causes African sleeping sickness. Studying insect endosymbionts can aid understanding the origins of symbioses in general, as a proxy for understanding endosymbiosis in other species.

The best-studied ant endosymbionts are &quot;Blochmannia&quot; bacteria, which are the primary endosymbiont of &quot;Camponotus&quot; ants. In 2018 a new ant-associated symbiont, &quot;Candidatus Westeberhardia Cardiocondylae,&quot; was discovered in &quot;Cardiocondyla&quot;. It is reported to be a primary symbiont.

===== Secondary =====
The pea aphid (&quot;Acyrthosiphon pisum&quot;) contains at least three secondary endosymbionts, &quot;Hamiltonella defensa&quot;, &quot;Regiella insecticola&quot;, and &quot;Serratia symbiotica&quot;. &quot;Hamiltonella defensa&quot; defends its aphid host from parasitoid wasps. This symbiosis replaces lost elements of the insect&#x27;s immune response.

One of the best-understood defensive symbionts is the spiral bacteria &quot;Spiroplasma poulsonii&quot;. &quot;Spiroplasma sp.&quot; can be reproductive manipulators, but also defensive symbionts of &quot;Drosophila&quot; flies. In &quot;Drosophila neotestacea&quot;, &quot;S. poulsonii&quot; has spread across North America owing to its ability to defend its fly host against nematode parasites. This defence is mediated by toxins called &quot;ribosome-inactivating proteins&quot; that attack the molecular machinery of invading parasites. These toxins represent one of the first understood examples of a defensive symbiosis with a mechanistic understanding for defensive symbiosis between an insect endosymbiont and its host.

&quot;Sodalis glossinidius&quot; is a secondary endosymbiont of tsetse flies that lives inter- and intracellularly in various host tissues, including the midgut and hemolymph. Phylogenetic studies do not report a correlation between evolution of &quot;Sodalis&quot; and tsetse. Unlike &quot;Wigglesworthia,&quot; &quot;Sodalis&quot; has been cultured &quot;in vitro&quot;.

&quot;Cardinium and m&quot;any other insects have secondary endosymbionts.

==== Marine ====
Extracellular endosymbionts are represented in all four extant classes of Echinodermata (Crinoidea, Ophiuroidea, Echinoidea, and Holothuroidea). Little is known of the nature of the association (mode of infection, transmission, metabolic requirements, etc.) but phylogenetic analysis indicates that these symbionts belong to the class Alphaproteobacteria, relating them to &quot;Rhizobium&quot; and &quot;Thiobacillus&quot;. Other studies indicate that these subcuticular bacteria may be both abundant within their hosts and widely distributed among the Echinoderms.

Some marine oligochaeta (e.g., &quot;Olavius algarvensis&quot; and &quot;Inanidrillus spp.&quot;) have obligate extracellular endosymbionts that fill the entire body of their host. These marine worms are nutritionally dependent on their symbiotic chemoautotrophic bacteria lacking any digestive or excretory system (no gut, mouth, or nephridia).

The sea slug &quot;Elysia chlorotica&#x27;s&quot; endosymbiont is the algae &quot;Vaucheria litorea.&quot; The jellyfish &quot;Mastigias&quot; have a similar relationship with an algae. &quot;Elysia chlorotica&quot; forms this relationship intracellularly with the algae&#x27;s chloroplasts. These chloroplasts retain their photosynthetic capabilities and structures for several months after entering the slug&#x27;s cells.

&quot;Trichoplax&quot; have two bacterial endosymbionts. Ruthmannia lives inside the animal&#x27;s digestive cells. Grellia lives permanently inside the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the first known symbiont to do so.

&quot;Paracatenula&quot; is a flatworm which have lived in symbiosis with an endosymbiotic bacteria for 500 million years. The bacteria produce numerous small, droplet-like vesicles that provide the host with needed nutrients.

===== Dinoflagellates =====
Dinoflagellate endosymbionts of the genus &quot;Symbiodinium&quot;, commonly known as zooxanthellae, are found in corals, mollusks (esp. giant clams, the &quot;Tridacna&quot;), sponges, and the unicellular foraminifera. These endosymbionts capture sunlight and provide their hosts with energy via carbonate deposition.

Previously thought to be a single species, molecular phylogenetic evidence reported diversity in &quot;Symbiodinium&quot;. In some cases, the host requires a specific &quot;Symbiodinium&quot; clade. More often, however, the distribution is ecological, with symbionts switching among hosts with ease. When reefs become environmentally stressed, this distribution is related to the observed pattern of coral bleaching and recovery. Thus, the distribution of &quot;Symbiodinium&quot; on coral reefs and its role in coral bleaching is an important in coral reef ecology.

==== Phytoplankton ====
In marine environments, endosymbiont relationships are especially prevalent in oligotrophic or nutrient-poor regions of the ocean like that of the North Atlantic. In such waters, cell growth of larger phytoplankton such as diatoms is limited by (insufficient) nitrate concentrations.  Endosymbiotic bacteria fix nitrogen for their hosts and in turn receive organic carbon from photosynthesis. These symbioses play an important role in global carbon cycling.

One known symbiosis between the diatom &quot;Hemialus&quot; spp. and the cyanobacterium &quot;Richelia intracellularis&quot; has been reported in North Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Pacific waters. &quot;Richelia&quot; is found within the diatom frustule of &quot;Hemiaulus&quot; spp., and has a reduced genome. A 2011 study measured nitrogen fixation by the cyanobacterial host &quot;Richelia intracellularis&quot; well above intracellular requirements, and found the cyanobacterium was likely fixing nitrogen for its host. Additionally, both host and symbiont cell growth were much greater than free-living &quot;Richelia intracellularis&quot; or symbiont-free &quot;Hemiaulus&quot; spp. The &quot;Hemaiulus&quot;-&quot;Richelia&quot; symbiosis is not obligatory, especially in nitrogen-replete areas.

&quot;Richelia intracellularis&quot; is also found in &quot;Rhizosolenia&quot; spp., a diatom found in oligotrophic oceans. Compared to the &quot;Hemaiulus&quot; host, the endosymbiosis with &quot;Rhizosolenia&quot; is much more consistent, and &quot;Richelia intracellularis&quot; is generally found in &quot;Rhizosolenia&quot;. There are some asymbiotic (occurs without an endosymbiont) Rhizosolenia, however there appears to be mechanisms limiting growth of these organisms in low nutrient conditions. Cell division for both the diatom host and cyanobacterial symbiont can be uncoupled and mechanisms for passing bacterial symbionts to daughter cells during cell division are still relatively unknown.

Other endosymbiosis with nitrogen fixers in open oceans include &quot;Calothrix&quot; in &quot;Chaetoceros&quot; spp. and UNCY-A in prymnesiophyte microalga.  The &quot;Chaetoceros&quot;-&quot;Calothrix&quot; endosymbiosis is hypothesized to be more recent, as the &quot;Calothrix&quot; genome is generally intact. While other species like that of the UNCY-A symbiont and Richelia have reduced genomes. This reduction in genome size occurs within nitrogen metabolism pathways indicating endosymbiont species are generating nitrogen for their hosts and losing the ability to use this nitrogen independently. This endosymbiont reduction in genome size, might be a step that occurred in the evolution of organelles (above).

=== Protists ===
&quot;Mixotricha paradoxa&quot; is a protozoan that lacks mitochondria. However, spherical bacteria live inside the cell and serve the function of the mitochondria. &quot;Mixotricha&quot; has three other species of symbionts that live on the surface of the cell.

&quot;Paramecium bursaria&quot;, a species of ciliate, has a mutualistic symbiotic relationship with green alga called &quot;Zoochlorella&quot;. The algae live in its cytoplasm.

&quot;Platyophrya chlorelligera&quot; is a freshwater ciliate that harbors &quot;Chlorella&quot; that perform photosynthesis.

&quot;Strombidium purpureum&quot; is a marine ciliate that uses endosymbiotic, purple, non-sulphur bacteria for anoxygenic photosynthesis.

&quot;Paulinella chromatophora&quot; is a freshwater amoeboid that has a cyanobacterium endosymbiont.

Many foraminifera are hosts to several types of algae, such as red algae, diatoms, dinoflagellates and chlorophyta. These endosymbionts can be transmitted vertically to the next generation via asexual reproduction of the host, but because the endosymbionts are larger than the foraminiferal gametes, they need to acquire algae horizontally following sexual reproduction.

Several species of radiolaria have photosynthetic symbionts. In some species the host digests algae to keep the population at a constant level.

&quot;Hatena arenicola&quot; is a flagellate protist with a complicated feeding apparatus that feeds on other microbes. When it engulfs a green &quot;Nephroselmis&quot; alga, the feeding apparatus disappears and it becomes photosynthetic. During mitosis the algae is transferred to only one of the daughter cells, while the other cell restarts the cycle.

In 1966, biologist Kwang W. Jeon found that a lab strain of &quot;Amoeba proteus&quot; had been infected by bacteria that lived inside the cytoplasmic vacuoles. This infection killed almost all of the infected protists. After the equivalent of 40 host generations, the two organisms become mutually interdependent. A genetic exchange between the prokaryotes and protists occurred.

=== Vertebrates ===
The spotted salamander (&quot;Ambystoma maculatum&quot;) lives in a relationship with the algae &quot;Oophila amblystomatis&quot;, which grows in its egg cases.

=== Plants ===
All vascular plants harbor endosymbionts or endophytes in this context. They include bacteria, fungi, viruses, protozoa and even microalgae. Endophytes aid in processes such as growth and development, nutrient uptake, and defense against biotic and abiotic stresses like drought, salinity, heat, and herbivores.

Plant symbionts can be categorized into epiphytic, endophytic, and mycorrhizal. These relations can also be categorized as beneficial, mutualistic, neutral, and pathogenic. Microorganisms living as endosymbionts in plants can enhance their host&#x27;s primary productivity either by producing or capturing important resources. These endosymbionts can also enhance plant productivity by producing toxic metabolites that aid plant defenses against herbivores.

Plants are dependent on plastid or chloroplast organelles. The chloroplast is derived from a cyanobacterial primary endosymbiosis that began over one billion years ago. An oxygenic, photosynthetic free-living cyanobacterium was engulfed and kept by a heterotrophic protist and eventually evolved into the present intracellular organelle.  

Mycorrhizal endosymbionts appear only in fungi.

Typically, plant endosymbiosis studies focus on a single category or species to better understand their individual biological processes and functions.

==== Fungal endophytes ====
Fungal endophytes can be found in all plant tissues. Fungi living below the ground amidst plant roots are known as mycorrhiza, but are further categorized based on their location inside the root, with prefixes such as ecto, endo, arbuscular, ericoid, etc. Fungal endosymbionts that live in the roots and extend their extraradical hyphae into the outer rhizosphere are known as ectendosymbionts.

===== Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (AMF) =====
Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi or AMF are the most diverse plant microbial endosymbionts. With exceptions such as the Ericaceae family, almost all vascular plants harbor AMF endosymbionts as endo and ecto as well. AMF plant endosymbionts systematically colonize plant roots and help the plant host acquire soil nutrients such as nitrogen. In return it absorbs plant organic carbon products. Plant root exudates contain diverse secondary metabolites, especially flavonoids and strigolactones that act as chemical signals and attracts the AMF. AMF &quot;Gigaspora margarita&quot; lives as a plant endosymbiont and also harbors further endosymbiont intracytoplasmic bacterium-like organisms. AMF generally promote plant health and growth and alleviate abiotic stresses such as salinity, drought, heat, poor nutrition, and metal toxicity. Individual AMF species have different effects in different hosts – introducing the AMF of one plant to another plant can reduce the latter&#x27;s growth.

===== Endophytic fungi =====
Endophytic fungi in mutualistic relations directly benefit and benefit from their host plants. They also can help their hosts succeed in polluted environments such as those contaminated with toxic metals. Fungal endophytes are taxonomically diverse and are divided into categories based on mode of transmission, biodiversity, in planta colonization and host plant type. Clavicipitaceous fungi systematically colonize temperate season grasses. Non-clavicipitaceous fungi colonize higher plants and even roots and divide into subcategories. &quot;Aureobasidium &quot;and &quot;preussia&quot; species of endophytic fungi isolated from &quot;Boswellia sacra&quot; produce indole acetic acid hormone to promote plant health and development.

Aphids can be found in most plants. Carnivorous ladybirds are aphid predators and are used in pest control. Plant endophytic fungus &quot;Neotyphodium lolii&quot; produces alkaloid mycotoxins in response to aphid invasions. In response, ladybird predators exhibited reduced fertility and abnormal reproduction, suggesting that the mycotoxins are transmitted along the food chain and affect the predators.

==== Endophytic bacteria ====
Endophytic bacteria belong to a diverse group of plant endosymbionts characterized by systematic colonization of plant tissues. The most common genera include &quot;Pseudomonas&quot;, &quot;Bacillus&quot;, &quot;Acinetobacter&quot;, &quot;Actinobacteria&quot;, &quot;Sphingomonas.&quot; Some endophytic bacteria, such as &quot;Bacillus amyloliquefaciens&quot;, a seed-born endophytic bacteria, produce plant growth by producing gibberellins, which are potent plant growth hormones. &quot;Bacillus amyloliquefaciens&quot; promotes the taller height of transgenic dwarf rice plants. Some endophytic bacteria genera additionally belong to the Enterobacteriaceae family. Endophytic bacteria typically colonize the leaf tissues from plant roots, but can also enter the plant through the leaves through leaf stomata. Generally, the endophytic bacteria are isolated from the plant tissues by surface sterilization of the plant tissue in a sterile environment. Passenger endophytic bacteria eventually colonize inner tissue of plant by stochastic events while True endophytes possess adaptive traits because of which they live strictly in association with plants. The &quot;in vitro-&quot;cultivated endophytic bacteria association with plants is considered a more intimate relationship that helps plants acclimatize to conditions and promotes health and growth. Endophytic bacteria are considered to be plant&#x27;s essential endosymbionts because virtually all plants harbor them, and these endosymbionts play essential roles in host survival. This endosymbiotic relation is important in terms of ecology, evolution and diversity. Endophytic bacteria such as &quot;Sphingomonas&quot; sp. and &quot;Serratia&quot; sp. that are isolated from arid land plants regulate endogenous hormone content and promote growth.

==== Archaea endosymbionts ====
Archaea are members of most microbiomes. While archaea are abundant in extreme environments, they are less abundant and diverse in association with eukaryotic hosts. Nevertheless, archaea are a substantial constituent of plant-associated ecosystems in the aboveground and belowground phytobiome, and play a role in host plant&#x27;s health, growth and survival amid biotic and abiotic stresses. However, few studies have investigated the role of archaea in plant health and its symbiotic relationships. Most plant endosymbiosis studies focus on fungal or bacteria using metagenomic approaches.

The characterization of archaea includes crop plants such as rice and maize, but also aquatic plants. The abundance of archaea varies by tissue type; for example archaea are more abundant in the rhizosphere than the phyllosphere and endosphere. This archaeal abundance is associated with plant species type, environment and the plant&#x27;s developmental stage. In a study on plant genotype-specific archaeal and bacterial endophytes, 35% of archaeal sequences were detected in overall sequences (achieved using amplicon sequencing and verified by real time-PCR). The archaeal sequences belong to the phyla &quot;Thaumarchaeota&quot;, &quot;Crenarchaeota,&quot; and &quot;Euryarchaeota&quot;.

=== Bacteria ===
Some Betaproteobacteria have Gammaproteobacteria endosymbionts.

=== Fungi ===
Fungi host endohyphal bacteria; the effects of the bacteria are not well studied. Many such fungi in turn live within plants. These fungi are otherwise known as fungal endophytes. It is hypothesized that the fungi offers a safe haven for the bacteria, and the diverse bacteria that they attract create a micro-ecosystem.

These interactions may impact the way that fungi interact with the environment by modulating their phenotypes. The bacteria do this by altering the fungi&#x27;s gene expression. For example, &quot;Luteibacter&quot; sp. has been shown to naturally infect the ascomycetous endophyte &quot;Pestalotiopsis&quot; sp. isolated from &quot;Platycladus orientalis.&quot; The &quot;Luteibacter&quot; sp. influences the auxin and enzyme production within its host, which, in turn, may influence the effect the fungus has on its plant host&quot;.&quot; Another interesting example of a bacterium living in symbiosis with a fungus is the fungus &quot;Mortierella.&quot; This soil-dwelling fungus lives in close association with a toxin-producing bacteria, &quot;Mycoavidus&quot;, which helps the fungus defend against nematodes.

In 2024, researchers injected individual cells of the bacterium &quot;Mycetohabitans rhizoxinica&quot; into cells of the fungus &quot;Rhizopus microsporus&quot; and were able to propagate the pair of cells for ten rounds using fluorescence-activated cell sorting to select fungal cells containing the bacterium. They found that the fungus&#x27;s DNA changed during the rounds of propagation. This was claimed to be the first time that endosymbiosis was artifically induced in a laboratory.

== Virus endosymbionts ==
The human genome project found several thousand endogenous retroviruses, endogenous viral elements in the genome that closely resemble and can be derived from retroviruses, organized into 24 families.

<text>In mathematics, the exponential function is the unique real function which maps zero to one and has a derivative equal to its value. The exponential of a variable is denoted or , with the two notations used interchangeably. It is called &quot;exponential&quot; because its argument can be seen as an exponent to which a constant number, the base, is raised. There are several other definitions of the exponential function, which are all equivalent although being of very different nature.

The exponential function converts sums to products: it maps the additive identity to the multiplicative identity , and the exponential of a sum is equal to the product of separate exponentials, . Its inverse function, the natural logarithm, or , converts products to sums: .

The exponential function is occasionally called the natural exponential function, matching the name &quot;natural logarithm&quot;, for distinguishing it from some other functions that are also commonly called &quot;exponential functions&quot;. These functions include the functions of the form , which is exponentiation with a fixed base . More generally, and especially in applications, functions of the general form are also called exponential functions. They grow or decay exponentially in that the amount that changes when is increased is proportional to the current value of .

The exponential function can be generalized to accept complex numbers as arguments. This reveals relations between multiplication of complex numbers, rotations in the complex plane, and trigonometry. Euler&#x27;s formula expresses and summarizes these relations.

The exponential function can be even further generalized to accept other types of arguments, such as matrices and elements of Lie algebras.

==Graph==
The graph of formula_1 is upward-sloping, and increases faster than every power of . The graph always lies above the -axis, but becomes arbitrarily close to it for large negative ; thus, the -axis is a horizontal asymptote. The equation formula_2 means that the slope of the tangent to the graph at each point is equal to its height (its -coordinate) at that point.

==Definitions and fundamental properties==

There are several equivalent definitions of the exponential function, although of very different nature.

===Differential equation===
One of the simplest definitions is: The &quot;exponential function&quot; is the &quot;unique&quot; differentiable function that equals its derivative, and takes the value for the value of its variable.

This &quot;conceptual&quot; definition requires a uniqueness proof and an existence proof, but it allows an easy derivation of the main properties of the exponential function.

&quot;Uniqueness: &quot;If and are two functions satisfying the above definition, then the derivative of is zero everywhere because of the quotient rule. It follows that is constant; this constant is since .

&quot;Existence&quot; is proved in each of the two following sections.

===Inverse of natural logarithm===
&quot;The exponential function is the inverse function of the natural logarithm.&quot; The inverse function theorem implies that the natural logarithm has an inverse function, that satisfies the above definition. This is a first proof of existence. Therefore, one has 
:formula_3
for every real number formula_4 and every positive real number formula_5

===Power series===

&quot;The exponential function is the sum of the power series&quot; 
formula_6

where formula_7 is the factorial of (the product of the first positive integers). This series is absolutely convergent for every formula_4 per the ratio test. So, the derivative of the sum can be computed by term-by-term derivation, and this shows that the sum of the series satisfies the above definition. This is a second existence proof, and shows, as a byproduct, that the exponential function is defined for every , and is everywhere the sum of its Maclaurin series.

===Functional equation===
&quot;The exponential satisfies the functional equation:&quot;
formula_9
This results from the uniqueness and the fact that the function
formula_10 satisfies the above definition. 

It can be proved that a function that satisfies this functional equation has the form if it is either continuous or monotonic. It is thus differentiable, and equals the exponential function if its derivative at is .

===Limit of integer powers===
&quot;The exponential function is the limit
formula_11
where formula_12 takes only integer values (otherwise, the exponentiation would require the exponential function to be defined). By continuity of the logarithm, this can be proved by taking logarithms and proving 
formula_13
for example with Taylor&#x27;s theorem.

===Properties===
&quot;Reciprocal:&quot; The functional equation implies . Therefore for every and 
formula_14

&quot;Positiveness:&quot; for every real number . This results from the intermediate value theorem, since and, if one would have for some , there would be an such that between and . Since the exponential function equals its derivative, this implies that the exponential function is monotonically increasing.

&quot;Extension of exponentiation to positive real bases:&quot; Let be a positive real number. The exponential function and the natural logarithm being the inverse each of the other, one has formula_15 If is an integer, the functional equation of the logarithm implies 
formula_16
Since the right-most expression is defined if is any real number, this allows defining for every positive real number and every real number :
formula_17
In particular, if is the Euler&#x27;s number formula_18 one has formula_19 (inverse function) and thus formula_20 This shows the equivalence of the two notations for the exponential function.

==General exponential functions==

A function is commonly called &quot;an exponential function&quot;with an indefinite articleif it has the form , that is, if it is obtained from exponentiation by fixing the base and letting the &quot;exponent&quot; vary.

More generally and especially in applied contexts, the term &quot;exponential function&quot; is commonly used for functions of the form . This may be motivated by the fact that, if the values of the function represent quantities, a change of measurement unit changes the value of , and so, it is nonsensical to impose .

These most general exponential functions are the differentiable functions that satisfy the following equivalent characterizations.
* for every and some constants and .
* for every and some constants and .
* The value of formula_21 is independent of formula_4.
* For every formula_23 the value of formula_24 is independent of formula_25 that is, formula_26 for every , .
The &quot;base&quot; of an exponential function is the &quot;base&quot; of the exponentiation that appears in it when written as , namely . The base is in the second characterization, formula_27 in the third one, and formula_28 in the last one.

===In applications===
The last characterization is important in empirical sciences, as allowing a direct experimental test whether a function is an exponential function. 

Exponential growth or exponential decaywhere the varaible change is proportional to the variable valueare thus modeled with exponential functions. Examples are unlimited population growth leading to Malthusian catastrophe, continuously compounded interest, and radioactive decay.

If the modeling function has the form or, equivalently, is a solution of the differential equation , the constant is called, depending on the context, the &quot;decay constant&quot;, &quot;disintegration constant&quot;, &quot;rate constant&quot;, or &quot;transformation constant&quot;.

===Equivalence proof===
For proving the equivalence of the above poperties, one can proceed as follows.

The two first characterizations are equivalent, since, if and , one has 
s.formula_29
The basic properties of the exponential function (derivative and functional equation) implies immediately the third and ths last condititon

Suppose that the third condition is verified, and let be the constant value of formula_30 Since formula_31 the quotient rule for derivation
implies that
formula_32 and thus that there is a constant such that formula_33 

If the last condition is verified, let formula_34 which is independent of . Using , one gets
formula_35
Taking the limit when tends to zero, one gets that the third condition is verified with . It follows therefore that for some and As a byproduct, one gets that 
formula_36
is independent of both and .

==Compound interest==

The earliest occurrence of the exponential function was in Jacob Bernoulli&#x27;s study of compound interests in 1683.
This is this study that led Bernoulli to consider the number
formula_37
now known as Euler&#x27;s number and denoted .

The exponential function is involved as follows in the computation of continuously compounded interests.

If a principal amount of 1 earns interest at an annual rate of compounded monthly, then the interest earned each month is times the current value, so each month the total value is multiplied by , and the value at the end of the year is . If instead interest is compounded daily, this becomes . Letting the number of time intervals per year grow without bound leads to the limit definition of the exponential function,
formula_38
first given by Leonhard Euler.

==Differential equations==

Exponential functions occur very often in solutions of differential equations.

The exponential functions can be defined as solutions of differential equations. Indeed, the exponential function is a solution of the simplest possible differential equation, namely . Every other exponential function, of the form , is a solution of the differential equation , and every solution of this differential equation has this form.

The solutions of an equation of the form 
formula_39 
involve exponential functions in a more sophisticated way, since they have the form
formula_40 
where is an arbitrary constant and the integral denotes any antiderivative of its argument. 

More generally, the solutions of every linear differential equation with constant coefficients can be expressed in terms of exponential functions and, when they are not homogeneous, antiderivatives. This holds true also for systems of linear differential equations with constant coefficients.

==Complex exponential==


The exponential function can be naturally extended to a complex function, which is a function with the complex numbers as domain and codomain, such that its restriction to the reals is the above-defined exponential function, called &quot;real exponential function&quot; in what follows. This function is also called &quot;the exponential function&quot;, and also denoted or . For distinguishing the complex case from the real one, the extended function is also called complex exponential function or simply complex exponential. 

Most of the definitions of the exponential function can be used verbatim for definiting the complex exponential function, and the proof of their equivalence is the same as in the real case.

The complex exponential function can be defined in several equivalent ways that are the same as in the real case.

The &quot;complex exponential&quot; is the unique complex function that equals its complex derivative and takes the value for the argument :
formula_41

The &quot;complex exponential function&quot; is the sum of the series
formula_42
This series is absolutely convergent for every complex number . So, the complex differential is an entire function.

The complex exponential function is the limit
formula_43

The functional equation
formula_44
holds for every complex numbers and . The complex exponential is the unique continuous function that satisfies this functional equation and has the value for .

The complex logarithm is a right-inverse function of the complex exponential:
formula_45
However, since the complex logarithm is a multivalued function, one has
formula_46
and it is difficult to define the complex exponential from the complex logarithm. On the opposite, this is the complex logarithm that is often defined from the complex exponential.

The complex exponential has the following properties:
formula_47
and
formula_48
It is periodic function of period ; that is 
formula_49
This results from Euler&#x27;s identity and the functional identity.

The complex conjugate of the complex exponential is 
formula_50
Its modulus is
formula_51
where denotes the real part of .

===Relationship with trigonometry===
Complex exponential and trigonometric functions are strongly related by Euler&#x27;s formula:
formula_52

This formula provides the decomposition of complex exponential in real and imaginary parts:
formula_53

The trigonometric functions can be expressed in terms of complex exponential:
formula_54

In previous formulas, ae commonly interpreted as real variables, but the formulas remain valid if the variables are interpreted as complex variables. These formulas may be used for defining trigonometric functions of a complex variable.

===Plots===

Considering the complex exponential function as a function involving four real variables:
formula_55
the graph of the exponential function is a two-dimensional surface curving through four dimensions.

Starting with a color-coded portion of the formula_56 domain, the following are depictions of the graph as variously projected into two or three dimensions.

The second image shows how the domain complex plane is mapped into the range complex plane:
* zero is mapped to 1
* the real formula_4 axis is mapped to the positive real formula_58 axis
* the imaginary formula_59 axis is wrapped around the unit circle at a constant angular rate
* values with negative real parts are mapped inside the unit circle
* values with positive real parts are mapped outside of the unit circle
* values with a constant real part are mapped to circles centered at zero
* values with a constant imaginary part are mapped to rays extending from zero

The third and fourth images show how the graph in the second image extends into one of the other two dimensions not shown in the second image.

The third image shows the graph extended along the real formula_4 axis. It shows the graph is a surface of revolution about the formula_4 axis of the graph of the real exponential function, producing a horn or funnel shape.

The fourth image shows the graph extended along the imaginary formula_59 axis. It shows that the graph&#x27;s surface for positive and negative formula_59 values doesn&#x27;t really meet along the negative real formula_58 axis, but instead forms a spiral surface about the formula_59 axis. Because its formula_59 values have been extended to , this image also better depicts the 2π periodicity in the imaginary formula_59 value.

==Matrices and Banach algebras==
The power series definition of the exponential function makes sense for square matrices (for which the function is called the matrix exponential) and more generally in any unital Banach algebra . In this setting, , and is invertible with inverse for any in . If , then , but this identity can fail for noncommuting and .

Some alternative definitions lead to the same function. For instance, can be defined as
formula_68

Or can be defined as , where is the solution to the differential equation , with initial condition ; it follows that for every in .

==Lie algebras==
Given a Lie group and its associated Lie algebra formula_69, the exponential map is a map formula_69 satisfying similar properties. In fact, since is the Lie algebra of the Lie group of all positive real numbers under multiplication, the ordinary exponential function for real arguments is a special case of the Lie algebra situation. Similarly, since the Lie group of invertible matrices has as Lie algebra , the space of all matrices, the exponential function for square matrices is a special case of the Lie algebra exponential map.

The identity formula_71 can fail for Lie algebra elements and that do not commute; the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula supplies the necessary correction terms.

==Transcendency==
The function is a transcendental function, which means that it is not a root of a polynomial over the ring of the rational fractions formula_72

If are distinct complex numbers, then are linearly independent over formula_73, and hence is transcendental over formula_73.

==Computation==
The Taylor series definition above is generally efficient for computing (an approximation of) formula_75. However, when computing near the argument formula_76, the result will be close to 1, and computing the value of the difference formula_77 with floating-point arithmetic may lead to the loss of (possibly all) significant figures, producing a large relative error, possibly even a meaningless result.

Following a proposal by William Kahan, it may thus be useful to have a dedicated routine, often called codice_1, which computes directly, bypassing computation of . For example,
one may use the Taylor series:
formula_78

This was first implemented in 1979 in the Hewlett-Packard HP-41C calculator, and provided by several calculators, operating systems (for example Berkeley UNIX 4.3BSD), computer algebra systems, and programming languages (for example C99).

In addition to base , the IEEE 754-2008 standard defines similar exponential functions near 0 for base 2 and 10: formula_79 and formula_80.

A similar approach has been used for the logarithm; see log1p.

An identity in terms of the hyperbolic tangent,
formula_81
gives a high-precision value for small values of on systems that do not implement .

===Continued fractions===
The exponential function can also be computed with continued fractions.

A continued fraction for can be obtained via an identity of Euler:
formula_82

The following generalized continued fraction for converges more quickly:
formula_83

or, by applying the substitution :
formula_84
with a special case for :
formula_85

This formula also converges, though more slowly, for . For example:
formula_86

<doc id="9679" wikidata="Q152428" url="?curid=9679" title="Prince Eugene of Savoy">
<text>Prince Eugene Francis of Savoy-Carignano (18 October 1663 – 21 April 1736), better known as Prince Eugene, was a distinguished field marshal in the Army of the Holy Roman Empire and of the Austrian Habsburg dynasty during the 17th and 18th centuries. Renowned as one of the greatest military commanders of his era, Prince Eugene also rose to the highest offices of state at the Imperial court in Vienna spending six decades in the service of three emperors.

Born in Paris, to the son of a French count and a niece of Cardinal Mazarin, Eugene was raised at the court of King Louis XIV. Initially destined for the priesthood as the youngest son of a noble family, he chose to pursue a military career at 19. Due to his poor physique and possibly a scandal involving his mother, Louis XIV denied him a commission in the French Royal Army and forbade him from enlisting elsewhere. Embittered, Eugene fled France and entered the service of Holy Roman Empire&#x27;s Emperor Leopold I, cousin and rival of Louis XIV, where his elder brother, Louis of Savoy, was already serving.

At 20, Prince Eugene of Savoy distinguished himself during the Ottomans Siege of Vienna in 1683. Commanding troops at Budapest (1686) and Belgrade (1688), he became a field marshal by age 25. In the Nine Years&#x27; War, he fought alongside his distant cousin, the Duke of Savoy. As commander-in-chief in Hungary, Eugene&#x27;s decisive victory at the Battle of Zenta (1697) ended the Ottoman threat for nearly 20 years. During the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1714), he served Emperor Leopold I, achieving victories in Italy and forming a crucial partnership with the Duke of Marlborough, securing wins at Blenheim (1704), Oudenaarde (1708), and Malplaquet (1709). His success continued in Italy, notably at Turin (1706). Renewed Austro-Turkish conflicts saw Eugene triumph at Petrovaradin (1716) and Belgrade (1717), solidifying his legacy as one of Europe&#x27;s greatest military commanders and securing peace in 1718.

Throughout the late 1720s, Eugene&#x27;s diplomatic skills secured powerful allies for the Emperor in dynastic struggles with the Bourbon powers. Physically and mentally fragile in his later years, Eugene saw less success as commander-in-chief during the War of the Polish Succession (1733–1735). Despite his opposition to the conflict, he loyally led a defensive campaign, preventing enemy invasion of Bavaria. During his peaceful years, Eugene accumulated a vast collection of art and literature and corresponded with contemporary artists, scientists, and philosophers. His architectural legacy includes Baroque palaces like the Belvedere in Vienna. He died on 21 April 1736, aged 72.

== Early years (1663–1699) ==
=== Hôtel de Soissons ===

Prince Eugene was born at the Hôtel de Soissons in Paris on 18 October 1663. His mother, Olympia Mancini, was one of Cardinal Mazarin&#x27;s nieces whom the Cardinal had brought to Paris from Rome in 1647 to further his (and, to a lesser extent, their) ambitions. The Mancinis were raised at the Palais-Royal along with the young Louis XIV, with whom Olympia formed an intimate relationship. Yet to her great disappointment, her chance to become queen passed by, and in 1657 she married Eugene Maurice, Count of Soissons, Count of Dreux and Prince of Savoy.

Together they had had five sons (Eugene being the youngest) and three daughters, but neither parent spent much time with the children: the father, a French general officer, spent much of his time away campaigning, while Olympia&#x27;s passion for court intrigue meant the children received little attention from her. The King remained strongly attached to Olympia, so much so that many believed them to be lovers; but her scheming eventually led to her downfall. After falling out of favour at court, Olympia turned to Catherine Deshayes (known as &quot;La Voisin&quot;), and to the arts of black magic and astrology. It proved a fatal relationship. She became embroiled in the &quot;Affaire des poisons&quot;; suspicions abounded of her involvement in her husband&#x27;s premature death in 1673, and even implicated her in a plot to kill the King himself. Whatever the truth, Olympia, rather than face trial, subsequently fled France for Brussels in January 1680, leaving Eugene in the care of his paternal grandmother, Marie de Bourbon, Countess of Soissons, and of his paternal aunt, Louise Christine of Savoy, Princess of Baden consort to the heir apparent Ferdinand Maximilian, and mother of Prince Louis of Baden.

From the age of ten, Eugene had been brought up for a career in the church since he was the youngest of his family. Eugene&#x27;s appearance was not impressive—&quot;He was never good-looking ...&quot; wrote the Duchess of Orléans, &quot;It is true that his eyes are not ugly, but his nose ruins his face; he has two large teeth which are visible at all times&quot; According to the duchess, who was married to Louis XIV&#x27;s bisexual brother, the Duke of Orléans, Eugene lived a life of &quot;debauchery&quot; and belonged to a small, effeminate set that included the famous cross-dresser Abbé François-Timoléon de Choisy. In February 1683, to the surprise of his family, the 19-year-old Eugene declared his intention of joining the army. Eugene applied directly to Louis XIV for command of a company in French service, but the King who was said to dislike Eugene&#x27;s appearance and who had shown no compassion for Olympia&#x27;s children since her disgrace—refused him out of hand. &quot;The request was modest, not so the petitioner&quot;, he remarked. &quot;No one else ever presumed to stare me out so insolently.&quot; Whatever the case, Louis XIV&#x27;s choice would cost him dearly twenty years later, for it would be precisely Eugene, in collaboration with the Duke of Marlborough, who would defeat the French army at Blenheim, a decisive battle which checked French military supremacy and political power.

Denied a military career in France, Eugene decided to seek service abroad. One of Eugene&#x27;s brothers, Louis Julius, had entered Imperial service the previous year, but he had been immediately killed fighting the Ottoman Empire in 1683. When news of his death reached Paris, Eugene decided to travel to Austria in the hope of taking over his brother&#x27;s command. It was not an unnatural decision: his first cousin, Louis of Baden, was already a leading general in the Imperial army, as was a more distant cousin, Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria. On the night of 26 July 1683, Eugene left Paris and headed east. Years later, in his memoirs, Eugene recalled his early years in France:

=== Great Turkish War ===
By May 1683, the Ottoman threat to Emperor Leopold I&#x27;s capital, Vienna, was very evident. The Grand Vizier, Kara Mustafa Pasha—encouraged by Imre Thököly&#x27;s Magyar rebellion—had invaded Hungary with between 100,000 and 200,000 men; within two months approximately 90,000 were beneath Vienna&#x27;s walls. With the &#x27;Turks at the gates&#x27;, the Emperor fled for the safe refuge of Passau up the Danube. It was at Leopold I&#x27;s camp that Eugene arrived in mid-August.

Although Eugene was not of Austrian extraction, he did have Habsburg antecedents. His grandfather, Thomas Francis, founder of the Carignano line of the House of Savoy, was the son of Catherine Michaela of Spain—a daughter of Philip II of Spain—and the great-grandson of the Emperor Charles V. But of more immediate consequence to Leopold I was the fact that Eugene was a relative of Victor Amadeus II, the Duke of Savoy, a connection that the Emperor hoped might prove useful in any future confrontation with France. These ties, together with his ascetic manner and appearance (a positive advantage to him at the sombre court of Leopold I), ensured the refugee from the hated French king a warm welcome at Passau, and a position in Imperial service. Though French was his favoured language, he communicated with Leopold in Italian, as the Emperor (though he knew it perfectly) disliked French. But Eugene also had a reasonable command of German, which he understood very easily, something that helped him much in the military.

Eugene had no doubt as to where his new allegiance lay, and this loyalty was immediately put to the test. By September, the Imperial forces under the Duke of Lorraine, together with a powerful Polish army under King John III Sobieski, were poised to strike the Sultan&#x27;s army. On the morning of 12 September, the Christian forces drew up in line of battle on the south-eastern slopes of the Vienna Woods, looking down on the massed enemy camp. The day-long Battle of Vienna resulted in the lifting of the 60-day siege, and the Sultan&#x27;s forces were routed. Serving under Baden, as a twenty-year-old volunteer, Eugene distinguished himself in the battle, earning commendation from Lorraine and the Emperor; he later received the nomination for the colonelcy and was awarded the Kufstein regiment of dragoons by Leopold I.

==== Holy League ====
In March 1684, Leopold I formed the Holy League with Poland and Venice to counter the Ottoman threat. For the next two years, Eugene continued to perform with distinction on campaign and establish himself as a dedicated, professional soldier; by the end of 1685, still only 22 years old, he was made a Major-General. Little is known of Eugene&#x27;s life during these early campaigns. Contemporary observers make only passing comments of his actions, and his own surviving correspondence, largely to his cousin Victor Amadeus, are typically reticent about his own feelings and experiences. Nevertheless, it is clear that Baden was impressed with Eugene&#x27;s qualities—&quot;This young man will, with time, occupy the place of those whom the world regards as great leaders of armies.&quot;

In June 1686, the Duke of Lorraine besieged Buda (Budapest), the centre of Ottoman Hungary and the old royal capital. After resisting for 78 days, the city fell on 2 September, and Turkish resistance collapsed throughout the region as far away as Transylvania and Serbia. Further success followed in 1687, where, commanding a cavalry brigade, Eugene made an important contribution to the victory at the Battle of Mohács on 12 August. Such was the scale of their defeat that the Ottoman army mutinied—a revolt which spread to Constantinople. The Grand Vizier, Sarı Süleyman Pasha, was executed and Sultan Mehmed IV, deposed. Once again, Eugene&#x27;s courage earned him recognition from his superiors, who granted him the honour of personally conveying the news of victory to the Emperor in Vienna. For his services, Eugene was promoted to Lieutenant-General in November 1687. He was also gaining wider recognition. King Charles II of Spain bestowed upon him the Order of the Golden Fleece, while his cousin, Victor Amadeus, provided him with money and two profitable abbeys in Piedmont. Eugene&#x27;s military career suffered a temporary setback in 1688 when, on 6 September, the Prince suffered a severe wound to his knee by a musket ball during the Siege of Belgrade, and did not return to active service until January 1689.

==== Interlude in the west: Nine Years&#x27; War ====

Just as Belgrade was falling to Imperial forces under Max Emmanuel in the east, French troops in the west were crossing the Rhine into the Holy Roman Empire. Louis XIV had hoped that a show of force would lead to a quick resolution to his dynastic and territorial disputes with the princes of the Empire along his eastern border, but his intimidatory moves only strengthened German resolve, and in May 1689, Leopold I and the Dutch signed an offensive compact aimed at repelling French aggression.

The Nine Years&#x27; War was professionally and personally frustrating for the prince. Initially fighting on the Rhine with Max Emmanuel—receiving a slight head wound at the Siege of Mainz in 1689—Eugene subsequently transferred himself to Piedmont after Victor Amadeus joined the Alliance against France in 1690. Promoted to general of cavalry, he arrived in Turin with his friend the Prince of Commercy; but it proved an inauspicious start. Against Eugene&#x27;s advice, Amadeus insisted on engaging the French at Staffarda and suffered a serious defeat—only Eugene&#x27;s handling of the Savoyard cavalry in retreat saved his cousin from disaster. Eugene remained unimpressed with the men and their commanders throughout the war in Italy. &quot;The enemy would long ago have been beaten&quot;, he wrote to Vienna, &quot;if everyone had done their duty.&quot; So contemptuous was he of the Imperial commander, Count Carafa, he threatened to leave Imperial service.

In Vienna, Eugene&#x27;s attitude was dismissed as the arrogance of a young upstart, but so impressed was the Emperor by his passion for the Imperial cause, he promoted him to Field-Marshal in 1693. When Carafa&#x27;s replacement, Count Caprara, was himself transferred in 1694, it seemed that Eugene&#x27;s chance for command and decisive action had finally arrived. But Amadeus, doubtful of victory and now more fearful of Habsburg influence in Italy than he was of French, had begun secret dealings with Louis XIV aimed at extricating himself from the war. By 1696, the deal was done, and Amadeus transferred his troops and his loyalty to the enemy. Eugene was never to fully trust his cousin again; although he continued to pay due reverence to the Duke as head of his family, their relationship would forever after remain strained.

Military honours in Italy undoubtedly belonged to the French commander Marshal Catinat, but Eugene, the one Allied general determined on action and decisive results, did well to emerge from the Nine Years&#x27; War with an enhanced reputation. With the signing of the Treaty of Ryswick in September/October 1697, the desultory war in the west was finally brought to an inconclusive end, and Leopold I could once again devote all his martial energies into defeating the Ottoman Turks in the east.

==== Battle of Zenta ====

The distractions of the war against Louis XIV had enabled the Turks to recapture Belgrade in 1690. In August 1691, the Austrians, under Louis of Baden, regained the advantage by heavily defeating the Turks at the Battle of Slankamen on the Danube, securing Habsburg possession of Hungary and Transylvania. When Baden was transferred west to fight the French in 1692, his successors, first Caprara, then from 1696, Augustus the Strong, the Elector of Saxony, proved incapable of delivering the final blow. On the advice of the President of the Imperial War Council, Ernst Rüdiger von Starhemberg, thirty-four-year old Eugene was offered supreme command of Imperial forces in April 1697. This was Eugene&#x27;s first truly independent command—no longer need he suffer under the excessively cautious generalship of Caprara and Carafa, or be thwarted by the deviations of Victor Amadeus. But on joining his army, he found it in a state of &#x27;indescribable misery&#x27;. Confident and self-assured, the Prince of Savoy (ably assisted by Commercy and Guido Starhemberg) set about restoring order and discipline.


Leopold I had warned Eugene that &quot;he should act with extreme caution, forgo all risks and avoid engaging the enemy unless he has overwhelming strength and is practically certain of being completely victorious&quot;, but when the Imperial commander learnt of Sultan Mustafa II&#x27;s march on Transylvania, Eugene abandoned all ideas of a defensive campaign and moved to intercept the Turks as they crossed the River Tisza at Zenta on 11 September 1697.

It was late in the day before the Imperial army struck. The Ottoman cavalry had already crossed the river so Eugene decided to attack immediately, arranging his men in a half-moon formation. The vigour of the assault wrought terror and confusion among the Turks, and by nightfall, the battle was won. For the loss of some 2,000 dead and wounded, Eugene had inflicted an overwhelming defeat upon the enemy with approximately 25,000 Turks killed—including the Grand Vizier, Elmas Mehmed Pasha, the pashas of Adana, Anatolia, and Bosnia, plus more than thirty aghas of the Janissaries, sipahis, and silihdars, as well as seven horsetails (symbols of high authority), 100 pieces of heavy artillery, 423 banners, and the revered seal which the sultan always entrusted to the Grand Vizier on an important campaign, Eugene had annihilated the Ottoman army and brought to an end the War of the Holy League. Although the Ottomans lacked western organization and training, the Savoyard prince had revealed his tactical skill, his capacity for bold decision, and his ability to inspire his men to excel in battle against a dangerous foe.

After a brief terror-raid into Ottoman Bosnia, culminating in the sack of Sarajevo, Eugene returned to Vienna in November to a triumphal reception. His victory at Zenta had turned him into a European hero, and with victory came reward. Land in Hungary, given him by the Emperor, yielded a good income, enabling the Prince to cultivate his newly acquired tastes in art and architecture (see below); but for all his new-found wealth and property, he was, nevertheless, without personal ties or family commitments. Of his four brothers, only one was still alive at this time. His fourth brother, Emmanuel, had died aged 14 in 1676; his third, Louis Julius (already mentioned) had died on active service in 1683, and his second brother, Philippe, died of smallpox in 1693. Eugene&#x27;s remaining brother, Louis Thomas—ostracized for incurring the displeasure of Louis XIV—travelled Europe in search of a career, before arriving in Vienna in 1699. With Eugene&#x27;s help, Louis found employment in the Imperial army, only to be killed in action against the French in 1702. Of Eugene&#x27;s sisters, the youngest had died in childhood. The other two, Marie Jeanne-Baptiste and Louise Philiberte, led dissolute lives. Expelled from France, Marie joined her mother in Brussels, before eloping with a renegade priest to Geneva, living with him unhappily until her premature death in 1705. Of Louise, little is known after her early salacious life in Paris, but in due course, she lived for a time in a convent in Savoy before her death in 1726.

The Battle of Zenta proved to be the decisive victory in the long war against the Turks. With Leopold I&#x27;s interests now focused on Spain and the imminent death of Charles II, the Emperor terminated the conflict with the Sultan; he signed the Treaty of Karlowitz on 26 January 1699.

=== War of the Spanish Succession ===

With the death of the infirm and childless Charles II of Spain on 1 November 1700, the succession of the Spanish throne and subsequent control over her empire once again embroiled Europe in war—the War of the Spanish Succession. On his deathbed Charles II had bequeathed the entire Spanish inheritance to Louis XIV&#x27;s grandson, Philip, Duke of Anjou. This threatened to unite the Spanish and French kingdoms under the House of Bourbon—something unacceptable to England, the Dutch Republic, and Leopold I, who had himself a claim to the Spanish throne. From the beginning, the Emperor had refused to accept the will of Charles II, and he did not wait for England and the Dutch Republic to begin hostilities. Before a new Grand Alliance could be concluded Leopold I prepared to send an expedition to seize the Spanish lands in Italy.

Eugene crossed the Alps with some 30,000 men in May/June 1701. After a series of brilliant manoeuvres the Imperial commander defeated Catinat at the Battle of Carpi on 9 July. &quot;I have warned you that you are dealing with an enterprising young prince&quot;, wrote Louis XIV to his commander, &quot;he does not tie himself down to the rules of war.&quot; On 1 September Eugene defeated Catinat&#x27;s successor, Marshal Villeroi, at the Battle of Chiari, in a clash as destructive as any in the Italian theatre. But as so often throughout his career the Prince faced war on two fronts—the enemy in the field and the government in Vienna.

Starved of supplies, money, and men, Eugene was forced into unconventional means against the vastly superior enemy. During a daring raid on Cremona on the night of 31 January/1 February 1702 Eugene captured the French commander-in-chief. Yet the coup was less successful than hoped: Cremona remained in French hands, and the Duke of Vendôme, whose talents far exceeded Villeroi&#x27;s, became the theatre&#x27;s new commander. Villeroi&#x27;s capture caused a sensation in Europe and had a galvanizing effect on English public opinion. &quot;The surprise at Cremona&quot;, wrote the diarist John Evelyn, &quot;... was the great discourse of this week&quot;; but appeals for succour from Vienna remained unheeded, forcing Eugene to seek battle and gain a &#x27;lucky hit&#x27;. The resulting Battle of Luzzara on 15 August proved inconclusive. Although Eugene&#x27;s forces inflicted double the number of casualties on the French the battle settled little except to deter Vendôme trying an all-out assault on Imperial forces that year, enabling Eugene to hold on south of the Alps. With his army routing away, and personally grieving for his long-standing friend Prince Commercy who had died at Luzzara, Eugene returned to Vienna in January 1703.

==== President of the Imperial War Council ====
Eugene&#x27;s European reputation was growing (Cremona and Luzzara had been celebrated as victories throughout the Allied capitals), yet because of the condition and morale of his troops the 1702 campaign had not been a success. Austria itself was now facing the direct threat of invasion from across the border in Bavaria where the state&#x27;s Elector, Maximilian Emanuel, had declared for the Bourbons in August the previous year. Meanwhile, in Hungary a small-scale revolt had broken out in May and was fast gaining momentum. With the monarchy at the point of complete financial breakdown Leopold I was at last persuaded to change the government. At the end of June 1703 Gundaker Starhemberg replaced Gotthard Salaburg as President of the Treasury, and Prince Eugene succeeded Henry Mansfeld as the new President of the Imperial War Council (&quot;Hofkriegsratspräsident&quot;).

As head of the war council Eugene was now part of the Emperor&#x27;s inner circle, and the first president since Raimondo Montecuccoli to remain an active commander. Immediate steps were taken to improve efficiency within the army: encouragement and, where possible, money, was sent to the commanders in the field; promotion and honours were distributed according to service rather than influence; and discipline improved. But the Austrian monarchy faced severe peril on several fronts in 1703: by June the Duke of Villars had reinforced the Elector of Bavaria on the Danube thus posing a direct threat to Vienna, while Vendôme remained at the head of a large army in northern Italy opposing Guido Starhemberg&#x27;s weak Imperial force. Of equal alarm was Francis II Rákóczi&#x27;s revolt which, by the end of the year, had reached as far as Moravia and Lower Austria.

==== Blenheim ====
Dissension between Villars and the Elector of Bavaria had prevented an assault on Vienna in 1703, but in the Courts of Versailles and Madrid, ministers confidently anticipated the city&#x27;s fall. The Imperial ambassador in London, Count Wratislaw, had pressed for Anglo-Dutch assistance on the Danube as early as February 1703, but the crisis in southern Europe seemed remote from the Court of St. James&#x27;s where colonial and commercial considerations were more to the fore of men&#x27;s minds. Only a handful of statesmen in England or the Dutch Republic realized the true implications of Austria&#x27;s peril; foremost among these was the English Captain-General, the Duke of Marlborough.

By early 1704 Marlborough had resolved to march south and rescue the situation in southern Germany and on the Danube, personally requesting the presence of Eugene on campaign so as to have &quot;a supporter of his zeal and experience&quot;. The Allied commanders met for the first time at the small village of Mundelsheim on 10 June, and immediately formed a close rapport—the two men becoming, in the words of Thomas Lediard, &#x27;Twin constellations in glory&#x27;. This professional and personal bond ensured mutual support on the battlefield, enabling many successes during the Spanish Succession war. The first of these victories, and the most celebrated, came on 13 August 1704 at the Battle of Blenheim. Eugene commanded the right wing of the Allied army, holding the Elector of Bavaria&#x27;s and Marshal Marsin&#x27;s superior forces, while Marlborough broke through the Marshal Tallard&#x27;s center, inflicting over 30,000 casualties. The battle proved decisive: Vienna was saved and Bavaria was knocked out of the war. Both Allied commanders were full of praise for each other&#x27;s performance. Eugene&#x27;s holding operation, and his pressure for action leading up to the battle, proved crucial for the Allied success.

In Europe Blenheim is regarded as much a victory for Eugene as it is for Marlborough, a sentiment echoed by Sir Winston Churchill (Marlborough&#x27;s descendant and biographer), who pays tribute to &quot;the glory of Prince Eugene, whose fire and spirit had exhorted the wonderful exertions of his troops.&quot; France now faced the real danger of invasion, but Leopold I in Vienna was still under severe strain: Rákóczi&#x27;s revolt was a major threat; and Guido Starhemberg and Victor Amadeus (who had once again switched loyalties and rejoined the Grand Alliance in 1703) had been unable to halt the French under Vendôme in northern Italy. Only Amadeus&#x27; capital, Turin, held on.

==== Turin and Toulon ====
Eugene returned to Italy in April 1705, but his attempts to move west towards Turin were thwarted by Vendôme&#x27;s skilful manoeuvres. Lacking boats and bridging materials, and with desertion and sickness rife within his army, the outnumbered Imperial commander was helpless. Leopold I&#x27;s assurances of money and men had proved illusory, but desperate appeals from Amadeus and criticism from Vienna goaded the Prince into action, resulting in the Imperialists&#x27; bloody defeat at the Battle of Cassano on 16 August. Following Leopold I&#x27;s death and the accession of Joseph I to the Imperial throne in May 1705, Eugene began to receive the personal backing he desired. Joseph I proved to be a strong supporter of Eugene&#x27;s supremacy in military affairs; he was the most effective emperor the Prince served and the one he was happiest under. Promising support, Joseph I persuaded Eugene to return to Italy and restore Habsburg honour.

The Imperial commander arrived in theatre in mid-April 1706, just in time to organize an orderly retreat of what was left of Count Reventlow&#x27;s inferior army following his defeat by Vendôme at the Battle of Calcinato on 19 April. Vendôme now prepared to defend the lines along the River Adige, determined to keep Eugene cooped to the east while the Marquis of La Feuillade threatened Turin. Feigning attacks along the Adige, Eugene descended south across the river Po in mid-July, outmanoeuvring the French commander and gaining a favourable position from which he could at last move west towards Piedmont and relieve Savoy&#x27;s capital.

Events elsewhere now had major consequences for the war in Italy. With Villeroi&#x27;s crushing defeat by Marlborough at the Battle of Ramillies on 23 May, Louis XIV recalled Vendôme north to take command of French forces in Flanders. It was a transfer that Saint-Simon considered something of a deliverance for the French commander who was &quot;now beginning to feel the unlikelihood of success (in Italy) ... for Prince Eugene, with the reinforcements that had joined him after the Battle of Calcinato, had entirely changed the outlook in that theatre of the war.&quot; The Duke of Orléans, under the direction of Marsin, replaced Vendôme, but indecision and disorder in the French camp led to their undoing. After uniting his forces with Victor Amadeus at Villastellone in early September, Eugene attacked, overwhelmed, and decisively defeated the French forces besieging Turin on 7 September. Eugene&#x27;s success broke the French hold on northern Italy, and the whole Po valley fell under Allied control. Eugene had gained a victory as signal as his colleague had at Ramillies—&quot;It is impossible for me to express the joy it has given me;&quot; wrote Marlborough, &quot;for I not only esteem but I really love the prince. This glorious action must bring France so low, that if our friends could but be persuaded to carry on the war with vigour one year longer, we cannot fail, with the blessing of God, to have such a peace as will give us quiet for all our days.&quot;

The Imperial victory in Italy marked the beginning of Austrian rule in Lombardy, and earned Eugene the Governorship of Milan. But the following year was to prove a disappointment for the Prince and the Grand Alliance as a whole. The Emperor and Eugene (whose main goal after Turin was to take Naples and Sicily from Philip duc d&#x27;Anjou&#x27;s supporters), reluctantly agreed to Marlborough&#x27;s plan for an attack on Toulon—the seat of French naval power in the Mediterranean. Disunion between the Allied commanders—Victor Amadeus, Eugene, and the English Admiral Cloudesley Shovell—doomed the Toulon enterprise to failure. Although Eugene favoured some sort of attack on France&#x27;s south-eastern border it was clear he felt the expedition impractical, and showed none of the &quot;alacrity which he had displayed on other occasions.&quot; Substantial French reinforcements finally brought an end to the venture, and on 22 August 1707, the Imperial army began its retirement. The subsequent capture of Susa could not compensate for the total collapse of the Toulon expedition and with it any hope of an Allied war-winning blow that year.

==== Oudenarde and Malplaquet ====
At the beginning of 1708 Eugene successfully evaded calls for him to take charge in Spain (in the end Guido Starhemberg was sent), thus enabling him to take command of the Imperial army on the Moselle and once again unite with Marlborough in the Spanish Netherlands. Eugene (without his army) arrived at the Allied camp at Assche, west of Brussels, in early July, providing a welcome boost to morale after the early defection of Bruges and Ghent to the French. &quot; ... our affairs improved through God&#x27;s support and Eugene&#x27;s aid&quot;, wrote the Prussian General Natzmer, &quot;whose timely arrival raised the spirits of the army again and consoled us.&quot; Heartened by the Prince&#x27;s confidence the Allied commanders devised a bold plan to engage the French army under Vendôme and the Duke of Burgundy. On 10 July the Anglo-Dutch army made a forced march to surprise the French, reaching the River Scheldt just as the enemy was crossing to the north. The ensuing battle on 11 July—more a contact action rather than a set-piece engagement—ended in a resounding success for the Allies, aided by the dissension of the two French commanders. While Marlborough remained in overall command, Eugene had led the crucial right flank and centre. Once again the Allied commanders had co-operated remarkably well. &quot;Prince Eugene and I&quot;, wrote the Duke, &quot;shall never differ about our share of the laurels.&quot;

Marlborough now favoured a bold advance along the coast to bypass the major French fortresses, followed by a march on Paris. But fearful of unprotected supply-lines, the Dutch and Eugene favoured a more cautious approach. Marlborough acquiesced and resolved upon the siege of Vauban&#x27;s great fortress, Lille. While the Duke commanded the covering force, Eugene oversaw the siege of the town which surrendered on 22 October but Marshal Boufflers did not yield the citadel until 10 December. Yet for all the difficulties of the siege (Eugene was badly wounded above his left eye by a musket ball, and even survived an attempt to poison him), the campaign of 1708 had been a remarkable success. The French were driven out of almost all the Spanish Netherlands. &quot;He who has not seen this&quot;, wrote Eugene, &quot;has seen nothing.&quot;

The recent defeats, together with the severe winter of 1708–09, had caused extreme famine and privation in France. Louis XIV was close to accepting Allied terms, but the conditions demanded by the leading Allied negotiators, Anthonie Heinsius, Charles Townshend, Marlborough, and Eugene—principally that Louis XIV should use his own troops to force Philip V off the Spanish throne—proved unacceptable to the French. Neither Eugene nor Marlborough had objected to the Allied demands at the time, but neither wanted the war with France to continue, and would have preferred further talks to deal with the Spanish issue. But the French King offered no further proposals. Lamenting the collapse of the negotiations, and aware of the vagaries of war, Eugene wrote to the Emperor in mid-June 1709. &quot;There can be no doubt that the next battle will be the biggest and bloodiest that has yet been fought.&quot;

After the fall of Tournai on 3 September (itself a major undertaking), the Allied generals turned their attention towards Mons. Marshal Villars, recently joined by Boufflers, moved his army south-west of the town and began to fortify his position. Marlborough and Eugene favoured an engagement before Villars could render his position impregnable; but they also agreed to wait for reinforcements from Tournai which did not arrive until the following night, thus giving the French further opportunity to prepare their defences. Notwithstanding the difficulties of the attack, the Allied generals did not shrink from their original determination. The subsequent Battle of Malplaquet, fought on 11 September 1709, was the bloodiest engagement of the war. On the left flank, the Prince of Orange led his Dutch infantry in desperate charges only to have it cut to pieces; on the other flank, Eugene attacked and suffered almost as severely. But sustained pressure on his extremities forced Villars to weaken his centre, thus enabling Marlborough to break through and claim victory. Villars was unable to save Mons, which subsequently capitulated on 21 October, but his resolute defence at Malplaquet—inflicting up to 25% casualties on the Allies—may have saved France from destruction.

==== Final campaigning: Eugene alone ====
In August 1709 Eugene&#x27;s chief political opponent and critic in Vienna, Prince Salm, retired as court chamberlain. Eugene and Wratislaw were now the undisputed leaders of the Austrian government: all major departments of state were in their hands or those of their political allies. Another attempt at a negotiated settlement at Geertruidenberg in April 1710 failed, largely because the English Whigs still felt strong enough to refuse concessions, while Louis XIV saw little reason to accept what he had refused the previous year. Eugene and Marlborough could not be accused of wrecking the negotiations, but neither showed regret at the breakdown of the talks. There was no alternative but to continue the war, and in June the Allied commanders captured Douai. This success was followed by a series of minor sieges, and by the close of 1710 the Allies had cleared much of France&#x27;s protective ring of fortresses. Yet there had been no final, decisive breakthrough, and this was to be the last year that Eugene and Marlborough would work together.

Following the death of Joseph I on 17 April 1711 his brother, Charles, the pretender to the Spanish throne, became emperor. In England the new Tory government (the &#x27;peace party&#x27; who had deposed the Whigs in October 1710) declared their unwillingness to see Charles VI become Emperor as well as King of Spain, and had already begun secret negotiations with the French. In January 1712 Eugene arrived in England hoping to divert the government away from its peace policy, but despite the social success the visit was a political failure: Queen Anne and her ministers remained determined to end the war regardless of the Allies. Eugene had also arrived too late to save Marlborough who, seen by the Tories as the main obstacle to peace, had already been dismissed on charges of embezzlement. Elsewhere the Austrians had made some progress—the Hungarian revolt had finally came to end. Although Eugene would have preferred to crush the rebels the Emperor had offered lenient conditions, leading to the signing of the Treaty of Szatmár on 30 April 1711.

Hoping to influence public opinion in England and force the French into making substantial concessions, Eugene prepared for a major campaign. But on 21 May 1712—when the Tories felt they had secured favourable terms with their unilateral talks with the French—the Duke of Ormonde (Marlborough&#x27;s successor) received the so-called &#x27;restraining orders&#x27;, forbidding him to take part in any military action. Eugene took the fortress of Le Quesnoy in early July, before besieging Landrecies, but Villars, taking advantage of Allied disunity, outmanoeuvred Eugene and defeated the Earl of Albermarle&#x27;s Dutch garrison at the Battle of Denain on 24 July. The French followed the victory by seizing the Allies&#x27; main supply magazine at Marchiennes, before reversing their earlier losses at Douai, Le Quesnoy and Bouchain. In one summer the whole forward Allied position laboriously built up over the years to act as the springboard into France had been precipitously abandoned.

With the death in December of his friend and close political ally, Count Wratislaw, Eugene became undisputed &#x27;first minister&#x27; in Vienna. His position was built on his military successes, but his actual power was expressed through his role as president of the war council, and as &quot;de facto&quot; president of the conference which dealt with foreign policy. In this position of influence Eugene took the lead in pressing Charles VI towards peace. The government had come to accept that further war in the Netherlands or Spain was impossible without the aid of the Maritime Powers; yet the Emperor, still hoping that somehow he could place himself on the throne in Spain, refused to make peace at the Utrecht conference along with the other Allies. Reluctantly, Eugene prepared for another campaign, but lacking troops, finance, and supplies his prospects in 1713 were poor. Villars, with superior numbers, was able to keep Eugene guessing as to his true intent. Through successful feints and stratagems Landau fell to the French commander in August, followed in November by Freiburg. Eugene was reluctant to carry on the war, and wrote to the Emperor in June that a bad peace would be better than being &#x27;ruined equally by friend and foe&#x27;. With Austrian finances exhausted and the German states reluctant to continue the war, Charles VI was compelled to enter into negotiations. Eugene and Villars (who had been old friends since the Turkish campaigns of the 1680s) initiated talks on 26 November. Eugene proved an astute and determined negotiator, and gained favourable terms by the Treaty of Rastatt signed on 7 March 1714 and the Treaty of Baden signed on 7 September 1714. Despite the failed campaign in 1713 the Prince was able to declare that, &quot;in spite of the military superiority of our enemies and the defection of our Allies, the conditions of peace will be more advantageous and more glorious than those we would have obtained at Utrecht.&quot;

=== Austro-Turkish War ===

Eugene&#x27;s main reason for desiring peace in the west was the growing danger posed by the Turks in the east. Turkish military ambitions had revived after 1711 when they had mauled Peter the Great&#x27;s army on the River Pruth (Pruth River Campaign): in December 1714 Sultan Ahmed III&#x27;s forces attacked the Venetians in the Kingdom of the Morea. To Vienna it was clear that the Turks intended to attack Hungary and undo the whole Karlowitz settlement of 1699. After the Sublime Porte rejected an offer of mediation in April 1716, Charles VI despatched Eugene to Hungary to lead his relatively small but professional army. Of all Eugene&#x27;s wars this was the one in which he exercised most direct control; it was also a war which, for the most part, Austria fought and won on her own. Eugene left Vienna in early June 1716 with a field army of between 80,000 and 90,000 men. By early August 1716 the Ottoman Turks, some 200,000 men under the sultan&#x27;s son-in-law, the Grand Vizier Damat Ali Pasha, were marching from Belgrade towards Eugene&#x27;s position on the north bank of the Danube west of the fortress of Petrovaradin. The Grand Vizier had intended to seize the fortress; but Eugene gave him no chance to do so. After resisting calls for caution and forgoing a council of war, the Prince decided to attack immediately on the morning of 5 August with approximately 70,000 men. The Turkish janissaries had some initial success, but after an Imperial cavalry attack on their flank, Ali Pasha&#x27;s forces fell into confusion. Although the Imperials lost almost 5,000 dead or wounded, the Turks, who retreated in disorder to Belgrade, seem to have lost double that amount, including the Grand Vizier himself who had entered the mêlée and subsequently died of his wounds.

Eugene proceeded to take the Banat fortress of Temeswar in mid-October 1716 (thus ending 164 years of Turkish rule), before turning his attention to the next campaign and to what he considered the main goal of the war, Belgrade. Situated at the confluence of the Rivers Danube and Sava, Belgrade held a garrison of 30,000 men under Serasker Mustapha Pasha.
Imperial troops besieged the place in mid-June 1717, and by the end of July large parts of the city had been destroyed by artillery fire. By the first days of August, however, a huge Turkish field army (150,000–200,000 strong), under the new Grand Vizier Hacı Halil Pasha had arrived on the plateau east of the city to relieve the garrison. News spread through Europe of Eugene&#x27;s imminent destruction; but he had no intention of lifting the siege. With his men suffering from dysentery, and continuous bombardment from the plateau, Eugene, aware that a decisive victory alone could extricate his army, decided to attack the relief force. On the morning of 16 August, 40,000 Imperial troops marched through the fog, caught the Turks unaware, and routed Halil Pasha&#x27;s army; a week later Belgrade surrendered, effectively bringing an end to the war. The victory was the crowning point of Eugene&#x27;s military career and had confirmed him as the leading European general. His ability to snatch victory at the moment of defeat had shown the prince at his best.

The principal objectives of the war had been achieved: the task Eugene had begun at Zenta was complete, and the Karlowitz settlement secured. By the terms of the Treaty of Passarowitz, signed on 21 July 1718, the Turks surrendered the Banat of Temeswar, along with Belgrade and most of Serbia, although they regained the Morea from the Venetians. The war had dispelled the immediate Turkish threat to Hungary and was a triumph for Austria and for Eugene personally.

=== Quadruple Alliance ===

While Eugene fought the Turks in the east, unresolved issues following the Utrecht/Rastatt settlements led to hostilities between the Emperor and Philip V of Spain in the west. Charles VI had refused to recognise Philip V as King of Spain, a title which he himself claimed; in return, Philip V had refused to renounce his claims to Naples, Milan, and the Netherlands, all of which had transferred to the House of Austria following the Spanish Succession war. Philip V was roused by his influential wife, Elisabeth Farnese, daughter of the Hereditary Prince of Parma, who personally held dynastic claims in the name of her son, Charles, to the duchies of Tuscany, Parma and Piacenza. Representatives from a newly formed Anglo-French alliance—who were desirous of European peace for their own dynastic securities and trade opportunities—called on both parties to recognise each other&#x27;s sovereignty. Yet Philip V remained intractable, and on 22 August 1717 his chief minister, Alberoni, effected the invasion of Austrian Sardinia in what seemed like the beginning of the reconquest of Spain&#x27;s former Italian empire.

Eugene returned to Vienna from his recent victory at Belgrade (before the conclusion of the Turkish war) determined to prevent an escalation of the conflict, complaining that, &quot;two wars cannot be waged with one army&quot;; only reluctantly did the Prince release some troops from the Balkans for the Italian campaign. Rejecting all diplomatic overtures Philip V unleashed another assault in June 1718, this time against Savoyard Sicily as a preliminary to attacking the Italian mainland. Realizing that only the British fleet could prevent further Spanish landings, and that pro-Spanish groups in France might push the regent, Duke of Orléans, into war against Austria, Charles VI had no option but to sign the Quadruple Alliance on 2 August 1718, and formally renounce his claim to Spain. Despite the Spanish fleet&#x27;s destruction off Cape Passaro, Philip V and Elisabeth remained resolute, and rejected the treaty.

Although Eugene could have gone south after the conclusion of the Turkish war, he chose instead to conduct operations from Vienna; but Austria&#x27;s military effort in Sicily proved derisory, and Eugene&#x27;s chosen commanders, Zum Jungen, and later Count Mercy, performed poorly. It was only from pressure exerted by the French army advancing into the Basque provinces of northern Spain in April 1719, and the British Navy&#x27;s attacks on the Spanish fleet and shipping, that compelled Philip V and Elisabeth to dismiss Alberoni and join the Quadruple Alliance on 25 January 1720. Nevertheless, the Spanish attacks had strained Charles VI&#x27;s government, causing tension between the Emperor and his Spanish Council on the one hand, and the conference, headed by Eugene, on the other. Despite Charles VI&#x27;s own personal ambitions in the Mediterranean it was clear to the Emperor that Eugene had put the safeguarding of his conquests in Hungary before everything else, and that military failure in Sicily also had to rest on Eugene. Consequently, the Prince&#x27;s influence over the Emperor declined considerably.

== Later life (1721–36) ==

=== Governor-General of the Austrian Netherlands ===
Eugene had become governor of the Austrian Netherlands—in June 1716, but he was an absent ruler, directing policy from Vienna through his chosen representative the Marquis of Prié. Prié proved unpopular with the local population and the guilds who, following the Barrier Treaty of 1715, were obliged to meet the financial demands of the administration and the Dutch barrier garrisons; with Eugene&#x27;s backing and encouragement, civil disturbances in Antwerp and Brussels were forcibly suppressed. After displeasing the Emperor over his initial opposition to the formation of the Ostend Company, Prié also lost the support of the native nobility from within his own council of state in Brussels, particularly from the Marquis de Mérode-Westerloo. One of Eugene&#x27;s former favourites, General Bonneval, also joined the noblemen in opposition to Prié, further undermining the Prince. When Prié&#x27;s position became untenable, Eugene felt compelled to resign his post as governor of the Austrian Netherlands on 16 November 1724. As compensation, Charles VI conferred on him the honorary position as vicar-general of Italy, worth 140,000 gulden a year, and an estate at Siebenbrunn in Lower Austria said to be worth double that amount. But his resignation distressed him, and to compound his concerns Eugene caught a severe bout of influenza that Christmas, marking the beginning of permanent bronchitis and acute infections every winter for the remaining twelve years of his life.

=== &#x27;Cold war&#x27; ===
The 1720s saw rapidly changing alliances between the European powers and almost constant diplomatic confrontation, largely over unsolved issues regarding the Quadruple Alliance. The Emperor and the Spanish king continued to use each other&#x27;s titles, and Charles VI still refused to remove the remaining legal obstacles to Don Charles&#x27; eventual succession to the duchies of Parma and Tuscany. Yet in a surprise move Spain and Austria moved closer with the signing of the Treaty of Vienna in April/May 1725. In response Britain, France, and Prussia joined in the Alliance of Hanover to counter the danger to Europe of an Austro-Spanish hegemony. For the next three years there was the continual threat of war between the Hanover Treaty powers and the Austro-Spanish bloc.

From 1726, Eugene gradually began to regain his political influence. With his many contacts throughout Europe Eugene, backed by Gundaker Starhemberg and Count Schönborn, the Imperial vice-chancellor, managed to secure powerful allies and strengthen the Emperor&#x27;s position—his skill in managing the vast secret diplomatic network over the coming years was the main reason why Charles VI once again came to depend upon him. In August 1726 Russia acceded to the Austro-Spanish alliance, and in October Frederick William I of Prussia followed suit by defecting from the Allies with the signing of a mutual defensive treaty with the Emperor.
Despite the conclusion of the brief Anglo-Spanish conflict, manoeuvring between the European powers persisted throughout 1727–28. In 1729 Elisabeth Farnese abandoned the Austro-Spanish alliance. Realizing that Charles VI could not be drawn into the marriage pact she wanted, Elisabeth concluded that the best way to secure her son&#x27;s succession to Parma and Tuscany now lay with Britain and France. To Eugene it was &#x27;an event that which is seldom to be found in history&#x27;. Following the Prince&#x27;s determined lead to resist all pressure, Charles VI sent troops into Italy to prevent the entry of Spanish garrisons into the contested duchies. By the beginning of 1730 Eugene, who had remained bellicose throughout the whole period, was again in control of Austrian policy.

In Britain there now emerged a new political re-alignment as the Anglo-French &quot;entente&quot; became increasingly defunct. Believing that a resurgent France now posed the greatest danger to their security British ministers, headed by Robert Walpole, moved to reform the Anglo-Austrian Alliance, leading to the signing of the Second Treaty of Vienna on 16 March 1731. Eugene had been the Austrian minister most responsible for the alliance, believing once again it would provide security against France and Spain. The treaty compelled Charles VI to sacrifice the Ostend Company and accept, unequivocally, the accession of Don Charles to Parma and Tuscany. In return King George II as King of Great Britain and Elector of Electorate of Hanover guaranteed the Pragmatic Sanction, the device to secure the rights of the Emperor&#x27;s daughter, Maria Theresa, to the entire Habsburg inheritance. It was largely through Eugene&#x27;s diplomacy that in January 1732 the Imperial diet also guaranteed the Pragmatic Sanction which, together with the Treaties with Britain, Russia, and Prussia, marked the culmination of the Prince&#x27;s diplomacy. But the Treaty of Vienna had infuriated the court of King Louis XV: the French had been ignored and the Pragmatic Sanction guaranteed, thus increasing Habsburg influence and confirming Austria&#x27;s vast territorial size. The Emperor also intended Maria Theresa to marry Duke Francis Stephen of Lorraine which would present an unacceptable threat on France&#x27;s border. By the beginning of 1733 the French army was ready for war: all that was needed was the excuse.

=== War of the Polish Succession ===

In 1733 the Polish King and Elector of Saxony, Augustus the Strong, died. There were two candidates for his successor: first, Stanisław Leszczyński, the father-in-law of Louis XV; second, the Elector of Saxony&#x27;s son, Augustus, supported by Russia, Austria, and Prussia. The Polish succession had afforded Louis XV&#x27;s chief minister, Fleury, the opportunity to attack Austria and take Lorraine from Francis Stephen. To gain Spanish support France backed the succession of Elisabeth Farnese&#x27;s sons to further Italian lands.

Eugene entered the War of the Polish Succession as President of the Imperial War Council and commander-in-chief of the army, but he was severely handicapped by the quality of his troops and the shortage of funds; now in his seventies, the Prince was also burdened by rapidly declining physical and mental powers. France declared war on Austria on 10 October 1733, but without the funds from the Maritime Powers – who, despite the Vienna treaty, remained neutral throughout the war – Austria could not hire the necessary troops to wage an offensive campaign. &quot;The danger to the monarchy&quot;, wrote Eugene to the Emperor in October, &quot;cannot be exaggerated&quot;. By the end of the year French forces had seized Lorraine and Milan; by early 1734 Spanish troops had taken Sicily.

Eugene took command on the Rhine in April 1734, but vastly outnumbered he was forced onto the defensive. In June Eugene set out to relieve Philippsburg, yet his former drive and energy was now gone. Accompanying Eugene was a young prince Frederick of Prussia, sent by his father to learn the art of war. Frederick gained considerable knowledge from Eugene, recalling in later life his great debt to his Austrian mentor, but the Prussian prince was aghast at Eugene&#x27;s condition, writing later, &quot;his body was still there but his soul had gone.&quot; Eugene conducted another cautious campaign in 1735, once again pursuing a sensible defensive strategy on limited resources; but his short-term memory was by now practically non-existent, and his political influence disappeared completely—Gundaker Starhemberg and Johann Christoph von Bartenstein now dominated the conference in his place. Fortunately for Charles VI, Fleury was determined to limit the scope of the war, and in October 1735 he granted generous peace preliminaries to the Emperor.

=== Later years and death ===

Eugene returned to Vienna from the War of the Polish Succession in October 1735, weak and feeble; when Maria Theresa and Francis Stephen married in February 1736 Eugene was too ill to attend. After playing cards at Countess Batthyány&#x27;s on the evening of 20 April until nine in the evening, he returned home to the Stadtpalais, his attendant offered him to take his prescribed medicine which Eugene declined.

When his servants arrived to wake him the next morning on 21 April 1736, they found Prince Eugene dead after passing away quietly during the night. It has been said that on the same morning he was discovered dead, the great lion in his menagerie was also found dead.

Eugene&#x27;s heart was buried with the ashes of his ancestors in Turin, in the Basilica of Superga. His remains were carried in a long procession to St. Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral, where his embalmed body was buried in the &quot;Kreuzkapelle&quot;. It is said that the emperor himself attended as a mourner without anybody&#x27;s knowledge.

The Prince&#x27;s niece Maria Anna Victoria, whom he had never met, inherited Eugene&#x27;s immense possessions. Within a few years she sold off the palaces, the country estates and the art collection of a man who had become one of the wealthiest in Europe, after arriving in Vienna as a refugee with empty pockets.

== Personal life ==
Being an Italian by descent, a Frenchman by birth, and a German by adoption, Prince Eugene signed himself appropriately using the trilingual form &quot;Eugenio von Savoye&quot; (Italian: Eugenio, German: von, French: Savoye).

Eugene never married and was reported to have said that a woman was a hindrance in a war, and that a soldier should never marry; according to some of his contemporaries, Eugene&#x27;s loss at the 1712 Battle of Denain was due to the presence of an Italian lady that he took with him on the campaign; this was confirmed by Voltaire who reported meeting the lady in question. According to Nicholas Henderson, Eugene was called &quot;Mars without Venus&quot; for being a lifelong bachelor. Winston Churchill in his of the 1st Duke of Marlborough described Eugene as &quot;a bachelor, almost a misogynist, disdainful of money, content with his bright sword and his lifelong animosity against Louis XIV&quot;.

During the last 20 years of his life Eugène had a relationship with one woman, Hungarian Countess Eleonore Batthyány-Strattmann, the widowed daughter of the former Theodor von Strattman. Much of their acquaintance remains speculative since Eugene left no personal papers: only letters of war, diplomacy, and politics. Eugène and Eleonore were constant companions, meeting for dinner, receptions and card games almost every day till his death; although they lived apart most foreign diplomats assumed that Eleonore was his long time mistress. It is not known precisely when their relationship began, but his acquisition of a property in Hungary after the Battle of Zenta, near Rechnitz Castle, made them neighbours. In the years immediately following the War of the Spanish Succession she began to be mentioned regularly in diplomatic correspondence as &quot;Eugen&#x27;s Egeria&quot; and within a few years she was referred to as his constant companion and his mistress. When asked if she and the Prince would marry, Countess Batthyány replied: &quot;I love him too well for that, I would rather have a bad reputation than deprive him of his&quot;.

Rumours about Eugene&#x27;s sexual orientation can be traced back to his teenage years. It has since been established that the source of these rumours was Elizabeth Charlotte, Duchess of Orléans, a renowned gossipmonger at Versailles, whose husband Philippe I, Duke of Orléans happened to be the brother of French King Louis XIV, Eugene&#x27;s lifelong adversary. The Duchess documented what she claimed were youthful indiscretions involving Eugene, including alleged incidents with lackeys and pages. According to her, he was denied an ecclesiastical benefice due to his &quot;depravity&quot;. Eugene&#x27;s biographer, historian Helmut Oehler, acknowledged the Duchess&#x27;s comments but attributed them to her personal animosity toward the Prince. 
In his memoirs, Eugene, aware of the malicious rumours, derisively addressed them, calling them &quot;the invented anecdotes from the gallery of Versailles&quot;. Whether or not Eugene had homosexual relationships in his youth, the Duchess&#x27;s remarks about him were made years later, and only after Eugene had severely humiliated the armies of her brother-in-law, the King of France. Following Eugene&#x27;s departure from France at nineteen, and spanning until his death at seventy-two, there were no subsequent insinuations of homosexuality.

Being among the wealthiest and most celebrated figures of his era inevitably led to animosity for Eugene, as envy and malice trailed him from the battlefields to Vienna. His former subordinate Guido Starhemberg emerged as a persistent and bitter critic of Eugene&#x27;s renown. Starhemberg, according to Montesquieu, gained notoriety at the court of Vienna as Eugene&#x27;s primary rival. In a letter to a friend, Johann Matthias von der Schulenburg, another bitter rival who had served under Eugene in the War of the Spanish Succession, expressed disdain for the prince. Schulenburg, whose ambitions to command the Austrian army had been thwarted by Eugene, wrote that the prince &quot;has no idea but to fight whenever the opportunity offers; he thinks that nothing equals the name of Imperialists, before whom all should bend the knee. He loves . German journalist Curt Martin Riess, reads it as &quot;a testament to sodomy,&quot; while Eugene&#x27;s primary biographer, German historian Max Braubach, interpreted &quot;la p...&quot; as referring to Paillardize (fornication), Prostitution, or Puterie, i.e. Whoring.

During his tenure as Governor-General of the Austrian Netherlands, Eugene developed a reputation for frequenting an exclusive brothel on Amsterdam&#x27;s Prinsengracht. The keeper of the establishment, known as Madame Therese, was familiar with Eugene&#x27;s patronage. Notably, Eugene once brought the English consul in Amsterdam with him. A drawing by Cornelis Troost, housed at the Rijksmuseum, the national museum of the Netherlands, illustrates a scene in which Prince Eugene had &quot;the &#x27;available&#x27; women parade in review, just as he did his own troops,&quot; according to the museum. Troost based his drawing on an anecdote circulating at the time.

Eugene&#x27;s other friends such as the papal nuncio, Domenico Silvio Passionei, who delivered the funeral oration of Prince Eugene, made up for the family of his own that he lacked. For his only surviving nephew, Emmanuel Thomas, the son of his brother Louis Thomas, Eugene arranged marriage with Princess Maria Theresia of Liechtenstein, Duchess of Troppau, but Emmanuel died of smallpox in 1729. Eugene then turned his attention to his grand-nephew Eugene Jean, Emanuel&#x27;s only son, who now remained his last living male heir. Aiming at establishing a second Savoy state in central Italy, he requested for the young count the hand of the seven-year-old sovereign Duchess of Massa and Princess of Carrara, Maria Teresa Cybo-Malaspina (at the time under her mother&#x27;s regency), obtaining the approval of Emperor Charles VI and the King of Sardinia, Charles Emmanuel III, whom he looked to as the head of the extended House of Savoy. Matrimonial agreements were signed in Vienna on 2 May 1732, but the marriage never took place due to Eugene Jean&#x27;s premature death in Mannheim, where he was serving the emperor in the military, on 23 November 1734. Eugene&#x27;s closest relative was now Louis Thomas&#x27;s unmarried daughter and Eugene Jean&#x27;s aunt, Princess Maria Anna Victoria of Savoy, whom Prince Eugene had never met (and had made no effort to do so), and who became nevertheless, in the absence of a will, the legal heiress of all his assets. She was preferred to Prince Eugene&#x27;s cousin Victor Amadeus of Carignan (the son of his father&#x27;s eldest brother), who was also still alive.

== Patron of the arts ==
Eugene&#x27;s rewards for his victories, his share of booty, his revenues from his abbeys in Savoy, and a steady income from his Imperial offices and governorships, enabled him to contribute to the landscape of Baroque architecture Eugene spent most of his life in Vienna at his Winter Palace, the Stadtpalais, built by Fischer von Erlach. The palace acted as his official residence and home, but for reasons that remain speculative the Prince&#x27;s association with Fischer ended before the building was complete, favouring instead Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt as his chief architect. Eugene first employed Hildebrandt to finish the Stadtpalais before commissioning him to prepare plans for a palace on his Danubian island at Ráckeve, the Savoy Castle in Ráckeve. Begun in 1701 the single-story building took twenty years to complete; yet, probably because of the Rákóczi revolt, the Prince seems to have visited it only once—after the siege of Belgrade in 1717.

Of more importance was the grandiose complex of the two Belvedere palaces in Vienna. The single-storey Lower Belvedere, with its exotic gardens and zoo, was completed in 1716. The Upper Belvedere, completed between 1720 and 1722, is a more substantial building; with sparkling white stucco walls and copper roof, it became a wonder of Europe. Eugene and Hildebrandt also converted an existing structure on his Marchfeld estate into a country seat, the Schloss Hof, situated between the Rivers Danube and Morava. The building, completed in 1729, was far less elaborate than his other projects but it was strong enough to serve as a fortress in case of need. Eugene spent much of his spare time there in his last years accommodating large hunting parties.

In the years following the Peace of Rastatt Eugene became acquainted with a large number of scholarly men. Given his position and responsiveness, they were keen to meet him: few could exist without patronage and this was probably the main reason for Gottfried Leibniz&#x27;s association with him in 1714. Eugene also befriended the French writer Jean-Baptiste Rousseau who, by 1716, was receiving financial support from Eugene. Rousseau stayed on attached to the Prince&#x27;s household, probably helping in the library, until he left for the Netherlands in 1722. Another acquaintance, Montesquieu, already famous for his &quot;Persian Letters&quot; when he arrived in Vienna in 1728, favourably recalled his time spent at the Prince&#x27;s table. Nevertheless, Eugene had no literary pretensions of his own, and was not tempted like Maurice de Saxe or Marshal Villars to write his memoirs or books on the art of war. He did, however, become a collector on the grandest scale: his picture galleries were filled with 16th- and 17th-century Italian, Dutch and Flemish art; his library at the Stadtpalais crammed with over 15,000 books, 237 manuscripts as well as a huge collection of prints (of particular interest were books on natural history and geography). &quot;It is hardly believable&quot;, wrote Rousseau, &quot;that a man who carries on his shoulders the burden of almost all the affairs of Europe ... should find as much time to read as though he had nothing else to do.&quot;

At Eugene&#x27;s death his possessions and estates, except those in Hungary which the crown reclaimed, went to his niece, Princess Maria Anna Victoria, who at once decided to sell everything. The artwork was bought by Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia. Eugene&#x27;s library, prints and drawings were purchased by the Emperor in 1737 and have since passed into Austrian national collections.

== Historical reputation and legacy ==
Napoleon considered Eugene one of the eight greatest commanders of history. Although later military critics have disagreed with that assessment, Eugene was undoubtedly the greatest Austrian general. He was no military innovator, but he had the ability to make an inadequate system work. He was equally adept as an organiser, strategist, and tactician, believing in the primacy of battle and his ability to seize the opportune moment to launch a successful attack. &quot;The important thing&quot;, wrote Maurice de Saxe in his &quot;Reveries&quot;, &quot;is to see the opportunity and to know how to use it. Prince Eugene possessed this quality which is the greatest in the art of war and which is the test of the most elevated genius.&quot; This fluidity was key to his battlefield successes in Italy and in his wars against the Turks. Nevertheless, in the Low Countries, particularly after the battle of Oudenarde in 1708, Eugene, like his cousin Louis of Baden, tended to play safe and become bogged down in a conservative strategy of sieges and defending supply lines. After the attempt on Toulon in 1707, he also became very wary of combined land/sea operations. To historian Derek McKay the main criticism of him as a general is his legacy—he left no school of officers nor an army able to function without him.

Eugene was a disciplinarian—when ordinary soldiers disobeyed orders he was prepared to shoot them himself—but he rejected blind brutality, writing &quot;you should only be harsh when, as often happens, kindness proves useless&quot;.

On the battlefield Eugene demanded courage in his subordinates, and expected his men to fight where and when he wanted; his criteria for promotion were based primarily on obedience to orders and courage on the battlefield rather than social position. On the whole, his men responded because he was willing to push himself as hard as them. His position as President of the Imperial War Council proved less successful. Following the long period of peace after the Austro-Turkish War, the idea of creating a separate field army or providing garrison troops with effective training for them to be turned into such an army quickly was never considered by Eugene. By the time of the War of the Polish Succession, therefore, the Austrians were outclassed by a better prepared French force. For this Eugene was largely to blame—in his view (unlike the drilling and manoeuvres carried out by the Prussians which to Eugene seemed irrelevant to real warfare) the time to create actual fighting men was when war came.

Although Frederick II of Prussia had been struck by the muddle of the Austrian army and its poor organisation during the Polish Succession war, he later amended his initial harsh judgements. &quot;If I understand anything of my trade&quot;, commented Frederick in 1758, &quot;especially in the more difficult aspects, I owe that advantage to Prince Eugene. From him I learnt to hold grand objectives constantly in view, and direct all my resources to those ends.&quot; To historian Christopher Duffy it was this awareness of the &#x27;grand strategy&#x27; that was Eugene&#x27;s legacy to Frederick.

To his responsibilities, Eugene attached his own personal values – physical courage, loyalty to his sovereign, honesty, self-control in all things – and he expected these qualities from his commanders. Eugene&#x27;s approach was dictatorial, but he was willing to co-operate with someone he regarded as his equal, such as Baden or Marlborough. Yet the contrast with his co-commander of the Spanish Succession war was stark. According to Churchill, &quot;Marlborough was the model husband and father, concerned with building up a home, founding a family, and gathering a fortune to sustain it&quot;, whereas Eugene, the bachelor, was &quot;disdainful of money, content with his bright sword and his lifelong animosities against Louis XIV&quot;.
The result was an austere figure, inspiring respect and admiration rather than affection.

Sicco van Goslinga, one of the Dutch field deputies who worked very close with Eugene during his campaigns with Marlborough, described him in his memoires as follows:

=== Memorials ===

<text>Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze (May 24, 1816July 18, 1868) was a German-born American history painter, best known for his 1851 painting &quot;Washington Crossing the Delaware&quot;. He is associated with the Düsseldorf school of painting.

==Biography==
Leutze was born in Schwäbisch Gmünd, Kingdom of Württemberg. Later he was brought to the United States as a child in 1825. His parents settled first in Fredericksburg, Virginia, and then at Philadelphia. The first development of his artistic talent occurred while he was attending the sickbed of his father, when he attempted drawing to occupy the long hours of waiting. His father died in 1831. At 14, he was painting portraits for $5 apiece. Through such work, he supported himself after the death of his father. In 1834, he received his first instruction in art at the classes of John Rubens Smith, a portrait painter in Philadelphia. He soon became skilled, and promoted a plan for publishing, in Washington, portraits of eminent American statesmen; however, he was met with slight encouragement.

===Europe===
In 1840, one of his paintings attracted attention and gave him several orders, which enabled him to attend the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf in his native Germany. Due to his anti-academic attitude, he studied only one year at the academy, in the class of Director Schadow. Leutze was mostly influenced by the painter Karl Friedrich Lessing. In 1842, he went to Munich, studying the works of Cornelius and Kaulbach, and, while there, finished his &quot;Columbus before the Queen&quot;. The following year he visited Venice and Rome, making studies from Titian and Michelangelo. His first work, &quot;Columbus before the Council of Salamanca&quot; (1841) was purchased by the Düsseldorf Art Union. A companion picture, &quot;Columbus in Chains&quot;, procured him the gold medal of the Brussels Art Exhibition, and was subsequently purchased by the Art Union in New York; it was the basis of the 1893 $2 Columbian Issue stamp. In 1845, after a tour in Italy, he returned to Düsseldorf, marrying Juliane Lottner and making his home there for 14 years.

During his years in Düsseldorf, he was a resource for visiting Americans: he found them places to live and work, provided introductions, and gave them emotional and even financial support. For many years, he was the president of the Düsseldorf Artists&#x27; Association; in 1848, he was an early promoter of the &quot;Malkasten&quot; art association; and in 1857, he led the call for a gathering of artists which originated the founding of the Allgemeine deutsche Kunstgenossenschaft.
A strong supporter of Europe&#x27;s Revolutions of 1848, Leutze decided to paint an image that would encourage Europe&#x27;s liberal reformers with the example of the American Revolution. Using American tourists and art students as models and assistants, Leutze finished a first version of &quot;Washington Crossing the Delaware&quot; in 1850. Just after it was completed, the first version was damaged by fire in his studio, subsequently restored, and acquired by the Kunsthalle Bremen. On September 5, 1942, during World War II, it was destroyed in a bombing raid by the Allied forces. The second painting, a replica of the first, only larger, was ordered in 1850 by the Parisian art trader Adolphe Goupil for his New York branch and placed on exhibition on Broadway in October 1851. It is now owned by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. In 1854, Leutze finished his depiction of the Battle of Monmouth, &quot;Washington rallying the troops at Monmouth,&quot; commissioned by an important patron, the banker David Leavitt of New York City and Great Barrington, Massachusetts.

===New York City and Washington, D.C.===
In 1859, Leutze returned to the United States and opened a studio in New York City. He divided his time between New York City and Washington, D.C. In 1859, he painted a portrait of Chief Justice Roger Brooke Taney, which hangs in the Harvard Law School. In a 1992 opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia described the portrait of Taney, made two years after Taney&#x27;s infamous decision in &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot;, as showing Taney &quot;in black, sitting in a shadowed red armchair, left hand resting upon a pad of paper in his lap, right hand hanging limply, almost lifelessly, beside the inner arm of the chair. He sits facing the viewer and staring straight out. There seems to be on his face, and in his deep-set eyes, an expression of profound sadness and disillusionment.&quot;

Leutze also executed other portraits, including one of fellow painter William Morris Hunt. That portrait was owned by Hunt&#x27;s brother Leavitt Hunt, a New York attorney and sometime Vermont resident, and was shown at an exhibition devoted to William Morris Hunt&#x27;s work at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston in 1878.

In 1860, Leutze was commissioned by the U.S. Congress to decorate a stairway in the Capitol Building in Washington, DC, for which he painted a large composition, &quot;Westward the Course of Empire Takes Its Way&quot;, which is also commonly known as &quot;Westward Ho!&quot;.

Late in life, he became a member of the National Academy of Design. He was also a member of the Union League Club of New York, which has a number of his paintings. At age 52, he died in Washington, D.C. of heat stroke. He was interred at Glenwood Cemetery. At the time of his death, a painting, &quot;The Emancipation of the Slaves&quot;, was in preparation.Leutze&#x27;s portraits are known for the artistic quality of their patriotic romanticism, and his epic &quot;Washington Crossing the Delaware&quot; ranks in the utmost echelon of American national iconography.

<text>Erasmus Alberus (c. 15005 May 1553) was a German humanist, Lutheran reformer, and poet.

==Life==
He was born in the village of Bruchenbrücken (now part of Friedberg, Hesse) about the year 1500. Although his father Tilemann Alber was a schoolmaster, his early education was neglected.
Ultimately in 1518, he found his way to the University of Wittenberg, where he studied theology. He had the good fortune to attract the attention of Martin Luther and Philipp Melanchthon, and subsequently became one of Luther&#x27;s most active helpers in the Protestant Reformation.

Not only did he fight for the Protestant cause as a preacher and theologian, but he was almost the only member of Luther&#x27;s party who was able to confront the Roman Catholics with the weapon of literary satire. In 1542 he published a prose satire to which Luther wrote the preface, &quot;Der Barfusser Monche Eulenspiegel und Alkoran,&quot; a parodic adaptation of the &quot;Liber conformitatum&quot; of the Franciscan Bartolommeo Rinonico of Pisa, in which the Franciscan order is held up to ridicule. This drew reactions from Catholic scholars such as Henricus Sedulius, who published the &quot;Apologeticus aduersus Alcoranum Franciscanorum, pro Libro Conformitatum,&quot; which criticized Alberus&#x27; arguments in this satire. 

Of higher literary value is the didactic and satirical &quot;Buch von der Tugend und Weisheit&quot; (1550), a collection of forty-nine fables in which Alberus embodies his views on the relations of Church and State. His satire is incisive, but in a scholarly and humanistic way; it does not appeal to popular passions with the fierce directness which enabled the master of Catholic satire, Thomas Murner, to inflict such telling blows.

Several of Alberus&#x27;s hymns, all of which show the influence of his master Luther, have been retained in the German Protestant hymnal.

After Luther&#x27;s death, Alberus was for a time a deacon in Wittenberg; he became involved, however, in the political conflicts of the time, and was in Magdeburg in 1550–1551, while that town was besieged by Maurice, Elector of Saxony. In 1552 he was appointed General Superintendent at Neubrandenburg in Mecklenburg, where he died on 5 May 1553.

<doc id="9685" wikidata="Q1277497" url="?curid=9685" title="Earley parser">
<text>In computer science, the Earley parser is an algorithm for parsing strings that belong to a given context-free language, though (depending on the variant) it may suffer problems with certain nullable grammars. The algorithm, named after its inventor, Jay Earley, is a chart parser that uses dynamic programming; it is mainly used for parsing in computational linguistics. It was first introduced in his dissertation in 1968 (and later appeared in an abbreviated, more legible, form in a journal).

Earley parsers are appealing because they can parse all context-free languages, unlike LR parsers and LL parsers, which are more typically used in compilers but which can only handle restricted classes of languages. The Earley parser executes in cubic time in the general case formula_1, where &quot;n&quot; is the length of the parsed string, quadratic time for unambiguous grammars formula_2, and linear time for all deterministic context-free grammars. It performs particularly well when the rules are written left-recursively.

== Earley recogniser ==
The following algorithm describes the Earley recogniser. The recogniser can be modified to create a parse tree as it recognises, and in that way can be turned into a parser.

== The algorithm ==
In the following descriptions, α, β, and γ represent any string of terminals/nonterminals (including the empty string), X and Y represent single nonterminals, and &quot;a&quot; represents a terminal symbol.

Earley&#x27;s algorithm is a top-down dynamic programming algorithm. In the following, we use Earley&#x27;s dot notation: given a production X → αβ, the notation X → α • β represents a condition in which α has already been parsed and β is expected.

Input position 0 is the position prior to input. Input position &quot;n&quot; is the position after accepting the &quot;n&quot;th token. (Informally, input positions can be thought of as locations at token boundaries.) For every input position, the parser generates a &quot;state set&quot;. Each state is a tuple (X → α • β, &quot;i&quot;), consisting of

* the production currently being matched (X → α β)
* the current position in that production (visually represented by the dot •)
* the position &quot;i&quot; in the input at which the matching of this production began: the &quot;origin position&quot;

(Earley&#x27;s original algorithm included a look-ahead in the state; later research showed this to have little practical effect on the parsing efficiency, and it has subsequently been dropped from most implementations.)

A state is finished when its current position is the last position of the right side of the production, that is, when there is no symbol to the right of the dot • in the visual representation of the state.

The state set at input position &quot;k&quot; is called S(&quot;k&quot;). The parser is seeded with S(0) consisting of only the top-level rule. The parser then repeatedly executes three operations: &quot;prediction&quot;, &quot;scanning&quot;, and &quot;completion&quot;.

* &quot;Prediction&quot;: For every state in S(&quot;k&quot;) of the form (X → α • Y β, &quot;j&quot;) (where &quot;j&quot; is the origin position as above), add (Y → • γ, &quot;k&quot;) to S(&quot;k&quot;) for every production in the grammar with Y on the left-hand side (Y → γ).
* &quot;Scanning&quot;: If &quot;a&quot; is the next symbol in the input stream, for every state in S(&quot;k&quot;) of the form (X → α • &quot;a&quot; β, &quot;j&quot;), add (X → α &quot;a&quot; • β, &quot;j&quot;) to S(&quot;k&quot;+1).
* &quot;Completion&quot;: For every state in S(&quot;k&quot;) of the form (Y → γ •, &quot;j&quot;), find all states in S(&quot;j&quot;) of the form (X → α • Y β, &quot;i&quot;) and add (X → α Y • β, &quot;i&quot;) to S(&quot;k&quot;).

Duplicate states are not added to the state set, only new ones. These three operations are repeated until no new states can be added to the set. The set is generally implemented as a queue of states to process, with the operation to be performed depending on what kind of state it is.

The algorithm accepts if (X → γ •, 0) ends up in S(&quot;n&quot;), where (X → γ) is the top level-rule and &quot;n&quot; the input length, otherwise it rejects.

== Pseudocode ==
Adapted from Speech and Language Processing by Daniel Jurafsky and James H. Martin, 
DECLARE ARRAY S;

function INIT(words)
 S ← CREATE_ARRAY(LENGTH(words) + 1)
 for k ← from 0 to LENGTH(words) do
 S[k] ← EMPTY_ORDERED_SET

function EARLEY_PARSE(words, grammar)
 INIT(words)
 ADD_TO_SET((γ → •S, 0), S[0])
 for k ← from 0 to LENGTH(words) do
 for each state in S[k] do // S[k] can expand during this loop
 if not FINISHED(state) then
 if NEXT_ELEMENT_OF(state) is a nonterminal then
 PREDICTOR(state, k, grammar) // non_terminal
 else do
 SCANNER(state, k, words) // terminal
 else do
 COMPLETER(state, k)
 end
 end
 return chart

procedure PREDICTOR((A → α•Bβ, j), k, grammar)
 for each (B → γ) in GRAMMAR_RULES_FOR(B, grammar) do
 ADD_TO_SET((B → •γ, k), S[k])
 end

procedure SCANNER((A → α•aβ, j), k, words)
 if j &lt; LENGTH(words) and a ⊂ PARTS_OF_SPEECH(words[k]) then
 ADD_TO_SET((A → αa•β, j), S[k+1])
 end

procedure COMPLETER((B → γ•, x), k)
 for each (A → α•Bβ, j) in S[x] do
 ADD_TO_SET((A → αB•β, j), S[k])
 end
== Example ==
Consider the following simple grammar for arithmetic expressions:

&lt;P&gt; ::= &lt;S&gt; # the start rule
&lt;S&gt; ::= &lt;S&gt; &quot;+&quot; &lt;M&gt; | &lt;M&gt;
&lt;M&gt; ::= &lt;M&gt; &quot;*&quot; &lt;T&gt; | &lt;T&gt;
&lt;T&gt; ::= &quot;1&quot; | &quot;2&quot; | &quot;3&quot; | &quot;4&quot;

With the input:
 2 + 3 * 4

This is the sequence of state sets:

The state (P → S •, 0) represents a completed parse. This state also appears in S(3) and S(1), which are complete sentences.

== Constructing the parse forest ==
Earley&#x27;s dissertation briefly describes an algorithm for constructing parse trees by adding a set of pointers from each non-terminal in an Earley item back to the items that caused it to be recognized. But Tomita noticed that this does not take into account the relations between symbols, so if we consider the grammar S → SS | b and the string bbb, it only notes that each S can match one or two b&#x27;s, and thus produces spurious derivations for bb and bbbb as well as the two correct derivations for bbb.

Another method is to build the parse forest as you go, augmenting each Earley item with a pointer to a shared packed parse forest (SPPF) node labelled with a triple (s, i, j) where s is a symbol or an LR(0) item (production rule with dot), and i and j give the section of the input string derived by this node. A node&#x27;s contents are either a pair of child pointers giving a single derivation, or a list of &quot;packed&quot; nodes each containing a pair of pointers and representing one derivation. SPPF nodes are unique (there is only one with a given label), but may contain more than one derivation for ambiguous parses. So even if an operation does not add an Earley item (because it already exists), it may still add a derivation to the item&#x27;s parse forest.

* Predicted items have a null SPPF pointer.
* The scanner creates an SPPF node representing the non-terminal it is scanning.
* Then when the scanner or completer advance an item, they add a derivation whose children are the node from the item whose dot was advanced, and the one for the new symbol that was advanced over (the non-terminal or completed item).

SPPF nodes are never labeled with a completed LR(0) item: instead they are labelled with the symbol that is produced so that all derivations are combined under one node regardless of which alternative production they come from.

== Optimizations ==

Philippe McLean and R. Nigel Horspool in their paper &quot;A Faster Earley Parser&quot; combine Earley parsing with LR parsing and achieve an improvement in an order of magnitude.

<text>Ethiopian cuisine ( &quot;Ye-Ītyōṗṗyā məgəb&quot;) characteristically consists of vegetable and often very spicy meat dishes. This is usually in the form of &quot;wat,&quot; a thick stew, served on top of &quot;injera&quot; (), a large sourdough flatbread, which is about in diameter and made out of fermented teff flour. Ethiopians usually eat with their right hands, using pieces of to pick up bites of entrées and side dishes.

The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church prescribes a number of fasting periods known as &quot;tsom&quot; ( &quot;ṣōm&quot;), including all Wednesdays and Fridays and the whole Lenten season (including fifteen days outside Lent proper). Per Oriental Orthodox tradition, the faithful may not consume any kind of animal products (including dairy products and eggs) during fasts; therefore, Ethiopian cuisine contains many dishes that are vegan.

==Overview==

A typical dish consists of accompanied by a spicy stew, which frequently includes beef, lamb, vegetables and various types of legumes (such as lentils), and is traditionally consumed on the mesob basket. The cuisines of the Southern Nations, Nationalities and People&#x27;s Region and the Sidama region also make use of the false banana plant (, Ge&#x27;ez: እንሰት &quot;ïnset&quot;), a type of ensete. The plant is pulverized and fermented to make various foods, including a bread-like food called &quot;kocho&quot; (Ge&#x27;ez: ቆጮ &quot;ḳōč̣ō&quot;), which is eaten with kitfo. The root of this plant may be powdered and prepared as a hot drink called &quot;bulla&quot; (Ge&#x27;ez: ቡላ &quot;būlā&quot;), which is often given to those who are tired or ill. Another typical Gurage preparation is coffee with butter (&quot;kebbeh&quot;). &quot;Kita&quot; herb bread is also baked. &quot;Quanta&quot; (or &quot;quwanta&quot;), is an air-dried beef jerky with traditional spices; it is eaten on its own as a snack, or as an ingredient in stews and other dishes.

Due in part to the brief Italian occupation, pasta is popular and frequently available throughout Ethiopia, including rural areas. Coffee is also a large part of Ethiopian culture and cuisine. After every meal, a coffee ceremony is enacted and coffee is served.

==History==
The history of Ethiopian cuisine is influenced by the agricultural heritage of the nation. A key component of tradition is &quot;injera&quot; – a tangy and soft flatbread crafted from &quot;teff&quot;, an ancient grain native to Ethiopia. In dining settings, &quot;injera&quot; is commonly paired with an assortment of &quot;wot&quot; dishes featuring vegetables, legumes, and meat; one type, &quot;doro wot&quot;, a spicy chicken stew accentuated with &quot;berbere&quot;, a spice blend comprising chili peppers, garlic, ginger, and an array of spices, is the national dish of Ethiopia.

Throughout history, Ethiopian cuisine has developed through connections and trading with other nations, along with religious practices. For example, the enduring Christian beliefs in Ethiopia have impacted the development of plant-based meals due to fasting periods that forbid eating meat. Likewise, Islamic customs have influenced meat dishes during some celebrations like Eid.

Ethiopian food has been influenced by the country’s geography and its rich agricultural resources, such as lentils, beans, coffee, and various spices. The customary Ethiopian coffee ritual entails roasting, brewing, and serving coffee with great importance, as it is thought to have originated in Ethiopia. Ethiopian cuisine goes beyond mere nourishment, playing a key role in communal dining and cultural representation.

==Restrictions of certain meats==
Ethiopian Orthodox Christians avoid pork for cultural reasons as well as religious reasons, while Ethiopian Jews and Ethiopian Muslims avoid eating pork or shellfish for religious reasons; pork is forbidden in Judaism and Islam. Most Ethiopian Protestants or P&#x27;ent&#x27;ay also abstain from eating food that the Orthodox abstain from. Many Ethiopians abstain from eating certain meats, eating mostly vegetarian foods, partially from the high cost of meat, eggs, and dairy products.

==Traditional ingredients==

&quot;Berbere&quot;, a combination of powdered chili pepper and other spices (cardamom, fenugreek, coriander, cloves, ginger, nutmeg, cumin and allspice) is an important ingredient used to add flavor to many varied dishes like chicken stews and baked fish dishes. Also essential is &quot;niter kibbeh&quot;, a clarified butter infused with ginger, garlic, and several spices.

&quot;Mitmita&quot; (, ) is a powdered seasoning mix used in Ethiopian cuisine. It is orange-red in color and contains ground birdseye chili peppers (piri-piri), cardamom seed, cloves and salt. It occasionally has other spices including cinnamon, cumin and ginger.

In their adherence to strict fasting, Ethiopian cooks have developed a rich array of cooking oil sources—besides sesame and safflower—for use as a substitute for animal fats which are forbidden during fasting periods. Ethiopian cuisine also uses &quot;nug&quot; (also spelled &quot;noog&quot;, also known as &quot;niger seed&quot;).

==Dishes==
===Wat===

&quot;Wat&quot; begins with a large amount of chopped red onion, which is simmered or sauteed in a pot. Once the onions have softened, &quot;niter kebbeh&quot; (or, in the case of vegan dishes, vegetable oil) is added. Following this, &quot;berbere&quot; is added to make a spicy &quot;keiy wat&quot; or &quot;keyyih tsebhi&quot;. Turmeric is used instead of &quot;berbere&quot; for a milder &quot;alicha wat&quot; or both spices are omitted when making vegetable stews, such as &quot;atkilt wat&quot;. Meat such as beef (&quot;ሥጋ&quot;, &quot;səga&quot;), chicken (&quot;ዶሮ&quot;, &quot;doro&quot; or &quot;derho&quot;), fish (&quot;ዓሣ&quot;, &quot;asa&quot;), goat or lamb (&quot;በግ&quot;, &quot;beg&quot; or &quot;beggi&quot;) is also added. Legumes such as split peas (&quot;ክክ&quot;, &quot;kək&quot; or &quot;kikki&quot;) and lentils (&quot;ምስር&quot;, &quot;məsər&quot; or &quot;birsin&quot;); or vegetables such as potatoes (&quot;ድንች&quot;, &quot;Dənəch&quot;), carrots and chard (ቆስጣ) are also used instead in vegan dishes.

Each variation is named by appending the main ingredient to the type of &quot;wat&quot; (e.g. ). However, the word &quot;keiy&quot; is usually not necessary, as the spicy variety is assumed when it is omitted (e.g. &quot;doro wat&quot;). The term which simply means &#x27;vegetable&#x27; is sometimes used to refer to all vegetable dishes, but a more specific name can also be used (as in , which translates to &quot;potatoes and carrots stew&quot;; but the word &quot;atkilt&quot; is usually omitted when using the more specific term).

===Tibs===

Meat along with vegetables are sautéed to make &quot;tibs&quot; (also &quot;tebs&quot;, &quot;t&#x27;ibs&quot;, &quot;tibbs&quot;, etc., Ge&#x27;ez: ጥብስ &quot;ṭïbs&quot;). &quot;Tibs&quot; is served in a variety of manners, and can range from hot to mild or contain little to no vegetables. There are many variations of the delicacy, depending on type, size or shape of the cuts of meat used. Beef, mutton, and goat are the most common meats used in the preparation of &quot;tibs&quot;.
The mid-18th-century European visitor to Ethiopia describes &quot;tibs&quot; as a portion of grilled meat served &quot;to pay a particular compliment or show especial respect to someone.&quot; It may still be seen this way; today the dish is prepared to commemorate special events and holidays.

===Kinche (qinch&#x27;e)===

&quot;Kinche&quot; (&quot;qinch’e&quot;), a porridge, is a very common Ethiopian breakfast or supper. It is simple, inexpensive, and nutritious. It is made from cracked wheat, Ethiopian oats, barley or a mixture of those. It can be boiled in either milk or water with a little salt. The flavor of &quot;kinche&quot; comes from the &quot;nit&#x27;ir qibe&quot;, which is a spiced butter. Once cooked, kinche is combined in the pan with clarified spiced butter, oil, and fried onions, though it can also be enjoyed plain without any additional seasonings.

=== Salads ===
Azifa is an Ethiopian lentil salad made with mustard seed, jalapeños, and onions, and it is a dish often served cold. Buticha is an Ethiopian chickpea salad which is often served cold, and is sometimes compared to hummus.

===Sidama dishes===
====Wassa====
The enset plant (called &quot;wesse&quot; in the Sidamo language) is central to Sidama cuisine and after grinding and fermenting the root to produce &quot;wassa&quot;, it is used in the preparation of several foods.

==== Borasaame ====

Snacking on popcorn and traditional lentil samosa is also common.

==Beverages==

=== Traditional alcoholic beverages ===
There are many different traditional alcoholic drinks which are home made and of natural ingredients.

====Tella====
&quot;Tella&quot; is a home-brewed beer served in &quot;tella bet&quot; (&quot;tella houses&quot;) which specialize in serving only &quot;tella&quot;. &quot;Tella&quot; is the most common beverage made and served in households during holidays.

It is an alcoholic drink which is prepared from &quot;bikil&quot; (barley) as main ingredient and &quot;gesho&quot; (&quot;Rhamnus prinoides&quot;) for fermentation purpose.

In Oromiffaa, the drink is called &quot;farso&quot; and in Tigrinya &quot;siwa&quot;.

====Tej (honey wine) ====
&quot;Tej&quot; is a potent honey wine. It is similar to mead, and is frequently served in bars, particularly in a &quot;tej bet&quot; or &quot;&quot;tej&quot; house&quot;.

It is prepared from honey and gesho. It has a sweet taste and the alcoholic content is relatively higher than &quot;tella&quot;. This drink can be stored for a long time; the longer it is stored, the higher the alcohol content, and the stronger the taste.

====Areki (katikala)====
&quot;Areki&quot;, also known as &quot;katikala&quot;, is probably the strongest alcoholic drink of Ethiopia. It is a home distilled spirit that is often filtered through charcoal to remove off tastes or flavored by smoking or infusion with garlic.

=== Non-alcoholic beverages ===
Ethiopians have diverse traditional non-alcoholic drinks which include natural and healthy ingredients.

====Kenetto (keribo)====
&quot;Kenetto&quot;, also known as &quot;keribo&quot;, is a non-alcoholic traditional drink. It is mostly used as substitute for &quot;tella&quot; for those who do not drink alcohol.

====Borde====
&quot;Borde&quot; is a cereal-based traditional fermented beverage famous in southern Ethiopia.

===Manufactured drinks===
Just like the rest of the world, Ethiopians also enjoy several locally manufactured beers, wine and non-alcoholic products like Coca-Cola and other similar products.
Ambo Mineral Water or &quot;Ambo wuha&quot; is a bottled carbonated mineral water, sourced from the springs in Ambo Senkele near the town of Ambo.

===Non-alcoholic brews (hot drinks)===
==== Atmet ====
&quot;Atmet&quot; is a barley- and oat-flour based drink that is cooked with water, sugar and &quot;kibe&quot; (Ethiopian clarified butter) until the ingredients have combined to create a consistency slightly thicker than eggnog. Though this drink is often given to women who are nursing, the sweetness and smooth texture make it a comfort drink for anyone who enjoys its flavor.

====Coffee====

According to some sources, drinking of coffee (&quot;buna&quot;) is likely to have originated in Ethiopia. A key national beverage, it is an important part of local commerce.

The coffee ceremony is the traditional serving of coffee, usually after a big meal. It often involves the use of a &quot;jebena&quot; (ጀበና), a clay coffee pot in which the coffee is boiled. The preparer roasts the coffee beans in front of guests, then walks around wafting the smoke throughout the room so participants may sample the scent of coffee. Then the preparer grinds the coffee beans in a traditional tool called a . The coffee is put into the &quot;jebena&quot;, boiled with water, and then served in small cups called &quot;si&#x27;ni&quot;. Coffee is usually served with sugar, but is also served with salt in many parts of Ethiopia. In some parts of the country, &quot;niter kibbeh&quot; is added instead of sugar or salt.

Snacks, such as popcorn or toasted barley (or &quot;kolo&quot;), are often served with the coffee. In most homes, a dedicated coffee area is surrounded by fresh grass, with special furniture for the coffee maker. A complete ceremony has three rounds of coffee (&quot;abol&quot;, &quot;tona&quot; and &quot;bereka&quot;) and is accompanied by the burning of frankincense.

====Tea (shai)====
Tea will most likely be served if coffee is declined. Tea is grown in Ethiopia at Gumaro and Wushwush.

====Boiled coffee leaves====
Across southern Ethiopia, many groups drink boiled coffee leaves, called &quot;kuti&quot; among the Harari in the east and &quot;kaari&quot; among the Majang in the west. This is often made with widely varying seasonings and spices, such as sugar, salt, rue, hot peppers, ginger. The Ethiopian Food Safety Authority has registered the safety of coffee leaf infusions with the European Union.

<text>The Epistle of James is a general epistle and one of the 21 epistles (didactic letters) in the New Testament. It was written originally in Koine Greek.

James 1:1 identifies the author as &quot;James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ&quot; who is writing to &quot;the twelve tribes scattered abroad&quot;. Traditionally, the epistle is attributed to James the brother of Jesus (James the Just), and the audience is considered generally to be Jewish Christians, who were dispersed outside Israel.

Framing his letter within an overall theme of patient perseverance during trials and temptations, James writes in order to encourage his readers to live consistently with what they have learned in Christ. He condemns various sins, including pride, hypocrisy, favouritism, and slander. He encourages and implores believers to live humbly by godly, rather than worldly, wisdom; he encourages prayer in all situations.

Eusebius and other early Church Fathers regarded the epistle of James as a &quot;disputed book&quot;. So did Martin Luther, who included it along with Hebrews, Jude, and Revelation in his German translation of the Bible, but ordered James near the end of his New Testament published in 1522. He claimed this epistle was a straw epistle. 

The epistle aims to reach a wide Jewish audience. During the last decades, the epistle of James has attracted increasing scholarly interest due to a surge in the quest for the historical James, his role in early Christianity, his beliefs, and his relationships and views. This James revival is also associated with an increasing level of awareness of the Jewish grounding of both the epistle and early Christianity.

== Authorship ==

The author is identified as &quot;James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ&quot; (James 1:1). James (Jacob, , ) was an extremely common name in antiquity, and a number of early Christian figures are named James, including: James the son of Zebedee, James the Less, James the son of Alphaeus, and James the brother of Jesus (reported to also be the son of Alphaeus). Of these, James the brother of Jesus has the most prominent role in the early church, and is often understood as either the author of the epistle, or the implied author.

The earliest recorded references to the Epistle of James highlight the contentious nature of the epistle&#x27;s authorship. Origen may be the first person to link the epistle to &quot;James the brother of Lord&quot;, though this is only preserved in Rufinus&#x27;s Latin translation of Origen. Eusebius writes that &quot;James, who is said to be the author of the first of the so-called catholic epistles. But it is to be observed that it is disputed&quot;. Jerome reported that the Epistle of James &quot;is claimed by some to have been published by some one else under his name, and gradually, as time went on, to have gained authority&quot;.

=== Traditional authorship ===
The link between James the brother of Jesus and the epistle continued to strengthen, and is now considered the traditional view on the authorship of the work. The traditional view can be divided into at least three further positions that relate also to the date of the epistle:

# The historical James wrote the letter prior to the Galatians controversy (Galatians 2:11–14), and prior to the Jerusalem council (Acts 15);
# The historical James wrote the letter in response to Paulinism of some sort;
# The historical James wrote his letter after the events recorded in Galatians and Acts, but is not in dialogue with Paul or Paulinism.

Many who affirm traditional authorship think James had a sufficient proficiency in Greek education to write the letter himself. Some argue that James the brother of Jesus made use of an amanuensis, which explains the quality of Greek in the letter. Dan McCartney notes this position has garnered little support. Others have advocated for a two-stage composition theory, in which many sayings in the epistle originate with James the brother of Jesus. They were collected by James&#x27; disciples and redacted into the current form of the letter.

John Calvin and others suggested that the author was the James, son of Alphaeus, who is referred to as James the Less (often identified as James the &quot;brother&quot; of Jesus). The Protestant reformer Martin Luther denied it was the work of an apostle and termed it an &quot;epistle of straw&quot;.

The Holy Tradition of the Eastern Orthodox Church teaches that the Book of James was &quot;written not by either of the apostles, but by the &#x27;brother of the Lord&#x27; who was the first bishop of the Church in Jerusalem.&quot;

=== Pseudonymous authorship ===

A prevalent view within scholarship considers the Epistle of James to be pseudonymous. The real author chose to write under the name James, intending that the audience perceive James the brother of Jesus as the author. Scholars who maintain pseudonymous authorship differ on whether this was a deceitful or pious practice.

The following arguments are often cited in support of pseudepigraphy:

# The Greek in the Epistle of James is rather accomplished, leading many scholars to believe that it could not have been written by Jesus’ brother. While it has been noted that James&#x27;s hometown of Galilee was sufficiently Hellenised by the first century CE to produce figures such as the rhetorician Theodorus and the poet Meleager, there is no evidence (outside the Epistle of James) to suggest that James attained a Greek education.
# The Epistle of James appears to borrow from 1 Peter, and if this is the case, James must be dated after 1 Peter (often dated between 70 and 100 CE).
# If the Epistle envisages a conflict with later Paulinism, this would likewise presuppose a time after the death of James.

==Dating and surviving manuscripts==
The original manuscript of the Epistle of James is lost. The earliest extant manuscripts of James date to the mid-to-late 3rd century.

According to Josephus, James the brother of Jesus was killed in 62 CE, during the high priesthood of Ananus, although Clement of Alexandria and Hegesippus provide a different account of James&#x27; death, c. 69 CE. Those who hold to traditional authorship date the epistle to sometime before 62 CE, in the forties or fifties, making it one of the earliest writings of the New Testament.

Those who maintain that the epistle is pseudonymous generally date the epistle later, from the late first to mid-second century. This is based on a number of considerations, including the epistle&#x27;s potential dependence on 1 Peter, potential response to Paul&#x27;s writings or Paul&#x27;s later followers, late attestation in the historical record, and the 3rd and 4th century disputes concerning the epistle&#x27;s authorship.

The historiographic debate currently seems to be leaning to the side of those in favor of early dating, although not through irrefutable evidence but through indications and probabilities.

Some of the oldest surviving manuscripts that contain some or all of this letter include:

*Papyrus 20 (early 3rd century)
*Papyrus 23 (~AD 250)
*Papyrus 100 (late 3rd century)
*Codex Vaticanus (325–350)
*Codex Sinaiticus (330–360)
*Codex Alexandrinus (400–440)
*Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus ()
*Papyrus 54 (5th century)
*Papyrus 74 (7th century)

An ancient manuscript containing this chapter in the Coptic language is Papyrus 6 (~AD 350). In Latin, the epistle is preserved in the León palimpsest (7th century).

==Genre==
The Epistle of James is a public letter (epistle), and includes an epistolary prescript that identifies the sender (&quot;James&quot;) and the recipients (&quot;to the twelve tribes in the diaspora&quot;) and provides a greeting (James 1:1). The epistle resembles the form of a Diaspora letter, written to encourage Jewish-Christian communities living outside of Israel amid the hardships of diaspora life. James stands in the tradition of the Jewish genre of &quot;Letters to the Diaspora&quot;, including the letters of the members of the family of Gamaliel, the one preserved in 2 Maccabees 1:1–9, or some copied by Josephus, all of which are characterised by a double opening and an abrupt ending.

Many consider James to have affinities to Jewish wisdom literature: &quot;like Proverbs and Sirach, it consists largely of moral exhortations and precepts of a traditional and eclectic nature.&quot; The epistle also has affinities with many of the sayings of Jesus which are found in the gospels of Luke and Matthew (i.e., those attributed to the hypothetical Q source, in the two-source hypothesis). Some scholars have argued that the author of James is familiar with a version of Q rather than Luke or Matthew.

Other scholars have noted the epistle&#x27;s affinities with Greco-Roman philosophical literature. The author&#x27;s use and transformation of Q materials resembles the Hellenistic practice of , in which the author must &quot;rival and vie [] with the original in the expression of the same thoughts&quot;. Other studies have analysed sections of James in light of Greco-Roman rhetorical conventions.

==Structure==
Some view the epistle as having no overarching outline: &quot;James may have simply grouped together small &#x27;thematic essays&#x27; without having more linear, Greco-Roman structures in mind.&quot; That view is generally supported by those who believe that the epistle may not be a true piece of correspondence between specific parties but an example of wisdom literature, formulated as a letter for circulation. The &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; says, &quot;the subjects treated of in the Epistle are many and various; moreover, St. James not infrequently, whilst elucidating a certain point, passes abruptly to another, and presently resumes once more his former argument.&quot;

Others view the letter as having only broad topical or thematic structure. They generally organize James under three (in the views of Ralph Martin) to seven (in the views of Luke Johnson) general key themes or segments.

A third group believes that James was more purposeful in structuring his letter, linking each paragraph theologically and thematically:

The third view of the structuring of James is a historical approach that is supported by scholars who are not content with leaving the book as &quot;New Testament wisdom literature, like a small book of proverbs&quot; or &quot;like a loose collection of random pearls dropped in no particular order onto a piece of string.&quot;

A fourth group uses modern discourse analysis or Greco-Roman rhetorical structures to describe the structure of James.

The United Bible Societies&#x27; &quot;Greek New Testament&quot; divides the letter into the following sections:
== Historical context ==
The exact historical circumstances that occasioned the epistle are unknown. Those who understand James 2 as a polemic against Paul or Paul&#x27;s followers suggest an occasion for the letter aimed at opposing Pauline justification. Others have argued that James&#x27; discussion on faith and works does not have Pauline categories in view.

Some scholars have suggested that the epistle was written to both Christian and non-Christian Jews, who continued to worship together before the parting of the ways between Christianity and Judaism. The warning against cursing people (James 3:9–10) has been read in light of this historical reconstruction, and Dale Allison has argued that &quot;James reflects an environment in which some Jews, unhappy with Jewish Christians, were beginning to use the or something very much like it&quot; to curse Christians.

Poverty and wealth are key concerns throughout the epistle, and these issues are likely to reflect the epistle&#x27;s historical context. The author shows concern for vulnerable and marginalised groups, such as &quot;orphans and widows&quot; (James 1:27), believers who are &quot;poorly clothed and lacking in daily food&quot; (James 2:15), and the oppressed waged-worker (James 5:4). He writes strongly against the rich (James 1:10; 5:1–6) and those who show partiality towards them (James 2:1–7).

== Doctrine ==

=== Justification ===

The epistle contains the following famous passage concerning salvation and justification:

This passage has been contrasted with the teachings of Paul the Apostle on justification. Some scholars even believe that the passage is a response to Paul. One issue in the debate is the meaning of the Greek word (&quot;dikaiόō&quot;), &#x27;render righteous or such as he ought to be&#x27;), with some among the participants taking the view that James is responding to a misunderstanding of Paul.

Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy have historically argued that the passage disproves simplistic versions of the doctrine of justification by faith alone ().

The early Protestants resolved the apparent conflict between James and Paul regarding faith and works in alternate ways from the Catholics and Orthodox. One modern American Protestant explanation pre-supposes that James taught :

According to Ben Witherington III, differences exist between the Apostle Paul and James, but both used the law of Moses, the teachings of Jesus and other Jewish and non-Jewish sources, and &quot;Paul was not anti-law any more than James was a legalist&quot;. A more recent article suggests that the current confusion regarding the Epistle of James about faith and works resulted from Augustine of Hippo&#x27;s anti-Donatist polemic in the early fifth century. This approach reconciles the views of Paul and James on faith and works.

=== Anointing of the sick ===
The epistle is also the chief biblical text for the anointing of the sick. James wrote:

G. A. Wells suggested that the passage was evidence of late authorship of the epistle, on the grounds that the healing of the sick being done through an official body of presbyters (elders) indicated a considerable development of ecclesiastical organisation &quot;whereas in Paul&#x27;s day to heal and work miracles pertained to believers indiscriminately (I Corinthians, XII:9).&quot;

=== Works, deeds and care for the poor ===
James and the M Source material in Matthew are unique in the canon in their stand against the rejection of works and deeds. According to Sanders, traditional Christian theology wrongly divested the term &quot;works&quot; of its ethical grounding, part of the effort to characterize Judaism as legalistic. However, for James and for all Jews, faith is alive only through Torah observance. In other words, belief demonstrates itself through practice and manifestation. For James, claims about belief are empty, unless they are alive in action, works and deeds.



The epistle emphasizes the importance of acts of charity or works to go along with having the Christian faith by means the following three verses in chapter 2:



=== Torah observance ===
James is unique in the canon by its explicit and wholehearted support of Torah observance (the Law). According to Bibliowicz, not only is this text a unique view into the milieu of the Jewish founders – its inclusion in the canon signals that as canonization began (fourth century onward) Torah observance among believers in Jesus was still authoritative. According to modern scholarship James, Q, Matthew, the Didache, and the pseudo-Clementine literature reflect a similar ethos, ethical perspective, and stand on, or assume, Torah observance. James call to Torah observance (James 1:22-27) ensures salvation (James 2:12–13, 14–26). Hartin is supportive of the focus on Torah observance and concludes that these texts support faith through action and sees them as reflecting the milieu of the Jewish followers of Jesus. Hub van de Sandt sees Matthew&#x27;s and James&#x27; Torah observance reflected in a similar use of the Jewish Two Ways theme which is detectable in the Didache too (Didache 3:1–6). McKnight thinks that Torah observance is at the heart of James&#x27;s ethics. A strong message against those advocating the rejection of Torah observance characterizes, and emanates from, this tradition: &quot;Some have attempted while I am still alive, to transform my words by certain various interpretations, in order to teach the dissolution of the law; as though I myself were of such a mind, but did not freely proclaim it, which God forbid! For such a thing were to act in opposition to the law of God which was spoken by Moses, and was borne witness to by our Lord in respect of its eternal continuance; for thus he spoke: &#x27;The heavens and the earth shall pass away, but one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass away from the law.

James seem to propose a more radical and demanding interpretation of the law than mainstream Judaism. According to Painter, there is nothing in James to suggest any relaxation of the demands of the law. &quot;No doubt James takes for granted his readers&#x27; observance of the whole law, while focusing his attention on its moral demands.&quot;

===Latter Day Saint history===
James 1:5 has particular importance in the Latter Day Saint tradition. Joseph Smith claims that the reading and contemplation of this verse inspired him to ask God for wisdom, leading to his First Vision, and thus what his followers consider to be the Restoration—the creation of the LDS church.

== Canonicity ==

The first explicit references to the Epistle of James are found in the writings of Origen of Alexandria (e.g. &quot;Comm. on John.,&quot; 19.23) in the third century. Scholars have generally rejected the possible second-century allusions to James in the Apostolic Fathers and Irenaeus of Lyons&#x27; &quot;Against Heresies&quot;. Neither is James mentioned by Tertullian (c. 155–220 CE) or Cyprian (c. 210–258 CE), and its authenticity of the epistle doubted by Theodore of Mopsuestia (c. 350–428 CE). In &quot;Historia ecclesiae&quot; 2.23.25, Eusebius classes James among the Antilegomena or disputed works, stating &quot;it is to be observed that it is disputed; at least, not many of the ancients have mentioned it, as is the case likewise with the epistle that bears the name of Jude, which is also one of the seven so-called catholic epistles. Nevertheless we know that these also, with the rest, have been read publicly in very many churches.&quot;

Its late recognition in the Church, especially in the West, was a consequence primarily of its sparse attestation by earlier Christian authors and its disputed authorship. Jerome reported that the Epistle of James &quot;is claimed by some to have been published by some one else under his name, and gradually, as time went on, to have gained authority&quot; (&quot;De viris illustribus&quot; 2).

The Epistle of James is missing from the Muratorian fragment (poss. 2nd to 4th century), the Cheltenham list (c. 360 CE), but was listed with the twenty-seven New Testament books by Athanasius of Alexandria in his &quot;Thirty-Ninth Festal Epistle&quot; (367 CE), and subsequently affirmed by the Councils of Laodicea (c. 363 CE), of Rome (382 CE) and of Carthage (397 and 419).

During the Reformation era, Martin Luther took issue with the epistle on theological grounds, finding James&#x27; description of faith and works incompatible with his understanding of justification. Reportedly, he once went as far as to assert &quot;I almost feel like throwing Jimmy into the stove&quot;, a metaphor for his being tempted to remove the Epistle of James from the Bible. Luther nonetheless chose to include James in his German translation, though he moved it (along with Hebrews, Jude, and Revelation) to the end of the Bible.

<doc id="9689" wikidata="Q131466" url="?curid=9689" title="Epistle of Jude">
<text>The Epistle of Jude is the penultimate book of the New Testament as well as the Christian Bible. It is traditionally attributed to Jude, brother of James.

Jude is a short epistle written in Koine Greek. It condemns in fierce terms certain people the author sees as a threat to the early Christian community, but describes these opponents only vaguely. According to Jude, these opponents are within the Christian community, but are not true Christians: they are scoffers, false teachers, malcontents, given to their lusts, and so on. The epistle reassures its readers that these people will soon be judged by God. It is possible that the group being referred to would have been obvious to the original recipients of the letter, but if a specific group was being referred to, knowledge of the details has since been lost. The one bit of their potential ideology discussed in the letter is that these opponents denigrate angels and their role. If this was indeed a part of the ideology of this group the author opposed, then the epistle is possibly a counterpoint to the Epistle to the Colossians. Colossians condemns those who give angels undue prominence and worship them; this implies the two letters might be part of an early Christian debate on Christian angelology.

==Authorship==
The epistle introduces itself with a simple claim of authorship: &quot;Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James&quot; (NRSV). &quot;James&quot; is generally taken to mean James, brother of Jesus, a prominent leader in the early church. Introductions would typically refer to a father in the era, so the use of a brother suggests that this would only be done if the brother was famous within the community. Little is known about Jude himself. As the brother of James, it has traditionally meant Jude was also a brother of Jesus, since James is described as being the brother of Jesus. This is why Clement of Alexandria (c. 150–215 AD) wrote in his work &quot;Comments on the Epistle of Jude&quot; that Jude, the author, was a son of Joseph and a brother of Jesus. However, there is a dispute as to whether &quot;brother&quot; means someone who has the same father and mother, or a half-brother, cousin, or more distant familial relationship. This dispute over the true meaning of &quot;brother&quot; grew as the doctrine of the Virgin Birth evolved. For example, Saint Jerome believed that not only Mary but also Joseph were virgins their entire lives, and thus James and by extension Jude were cousins.

Outside the book of Jude, a &quot;Jude&quot; is mentioned five times in the New Testament: three times as Jude the Apostle, and twice as Jude the brother of Jesus (aside from references to Judas Iscariot and Judah (son of Jacob)). Debate continues as to whether the author of the epistle is the apostle, the brother of Jesus, both, or neither. Scholars have argued that since the author of the letter has not identified himself as an apostle and also refers to the apostles as a third party, he cannot be identified with Jude the Apostle. Other scholars have drawn the opposite conclusion, which is that, as an apostle, he would not have made a claim of apostleship on his own behalf. Scholars who have defended the authorship of the brother of James as plausible include Richard Bauckham.

A reason to doubt that a relative of Jesus wrote the book is that they are unlikely to have been literate. Jesus&#x27;s family were common laborers from Aramaic-speaking Galilee, and literary composition skills were overwhelmingly concentrated in the elite in antiquity. Few knew how to read, fewer how to write, and fewer still how to write complicated literary treatises. Jesus himself may have been able to read, presumably in Hebrew, but he was also exceptional and the star of the family. Even if somehow Jude had learned a little of how to read Hebrew, the epistle is written in excellent, complicated Koine Greek, with knowledge of common forms of rhetoric and argument of the era, as well as seeming knowledge of the scriptures in Hebrew. All this would be exceptional for a countryside Galilean. Scholars who support the authorship of Jude generally assume that he must have embarked upon extensive travel and missionary work among Hellenized Jews to master Greek as the author did. Ultimately, it is impossible to know more details of Jude&#x27;s life for sure. One early Christian tradition states that Jude&#x27;s grandchildren were brought before Emperor Domitian and interrogated; in the story, they defended themselves as not rebels and mere poor laborers eking out what they could from a single patch of land. While the story is clearly apocryphal – Roman emperors did not generally interrogate Galilean peasants – it does suggest that early Christians remembered Jude&#x27;s family as lower-class laborers, not literate elites.

If the Jude writing the letter was not Jude the Apostle mentioned in the gospels, then he was possibly an unknown Christian who happened to share the name and coincidentally also had a brother named James. A final possibility is that the epistle is pseudepigrapha – that the author intentionally hinted to readers that it was from the more famous Jude, but only as a false attribution to give the letter more authority.

===Date===
The date of composition is not known, but is loosely speculated to be between the years 50 and 110. If the epistle was written by the Jude mentioned in the gospels, that would place it sometime in the early apostolic age of before the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem; if the letter reflects &quot;early catholicism&quot; and the beginnings of an organized church, then a date of the last decade of the first century or the early second century () is indicated; and if the letter is an attack on Gnosticism, then a much later date is indicated, perhaps around 150 AD. Scholars who consider the letter a pseudonymous work generally favor the later dates due to the letter&#x27;s references to the apostles (as if they lived in the past) and to an authoritative tradition, and because of its competent Greek style. Bo Reicke suggests around 90 AD; Heikki Räisänen concurs and believes that it may have been written at the end of the first century. Bart Ehrman also agrees that toward the end of the first century is the most likely, due to use of certain terminology in ways similar to the pastoral epistles that match a late first century date.

==Content==
Jude urges his readers to &quot;contend for the faith&quot; against &quot;certain intruders [who] have stolen in among you.&quot; He warns about false teachers who twist the grace of Christ as a pretext for wantonness. Jude asks the reader to recall how even after the Lord saved his own people out of the land of Egypt, he did not hesitate to destroy those who fell into unbelief, much as he punished the angels who fell from their original exalted status and the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah. He also paraphrases (verse 9) an incident apparently from the Assumption of Moses that has since been lost about Satan and Michael the Archangel quarreling over the body of Moses.

Continuing the analogy from Israel&#x27;s history, he says that the false teachers have followed in the way of Cain, have rushed after reward into the error of Balaam, and have perished in the rebellion of Korach. He describes in vivid terms the opponents he warns of, calling them &quot;clouds without rain&quot;, &quot;trees without fruit&quot;, &quot;foaming waves of the sea&quot;, and &quot;wandering stars&quot;. He exhorts believers to remember the words spoken by the Apostles, using language similar to the second epistle of Peter to answer concerns that the Lord seemed to tarry: &quot;In the last time there will be scoffers, indulging their own ungodly lusts,&quot; and to keep themselves in God&#x27;s love, before delivering a doxology to God.

Jude quotes directly from the Book of Enoch, a widely distributed work among the Old Testament pseudepigrapha, citing a section of 1 Enoch 1:8 that is based on Deuteronomy 33:2.

==Style and audience==
Consisting of just 1 chapter with 25 verses, the Epistle of Jude is among the shortest books of the Bible. (The Epistle to Philemon also contains 25 verses, while the 21-verse Book of Obadiah, the 14-verse 3 John, and the 13-verse 2 John are shorter.)

The wording and syntax of this epistle in its original Greek demonstrates that the author was capable and fluent. The epistle&#x27;s style is combative, impassioned, and rushed. Many examples of evildoers and warnings about their fates are given in rapid succession.

The epistle concludes with a doxology, which is considered by Peter H. Davids to be one of the highest in quality contained in the Bible. 

It may have been composed as an encyclical letter—that is, one not directed to the members of one church in particular, but intended rather to be circulated and read in all churches. While addressed to the Christian Church as a whole, the references to Old Testament figures such as Michael, Cain, and Korah&#x27;s sons, the Book of Enoch, and the invocation of James as head of the church of Jerusalem suggests a Jewish Christian main audience that would be familiar with Enochian literature and revere James.

==Canonical status==
The letter of Jude was one of the disputed books of the biblical canon of the New Testament. Despite some opposition, it seems to have been accepted by most churches around the end of the second century. Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian, and the Muratorian canon considered the letter canonical. The letter was eventually accepted as part of the canon by later Church Fathers such as Athanasius of Alexandria. The canon list at the Council of Carthage (c. 397) included the epistle of Jude.

The first historical record of doubts as to authorship are found in the writings of Origen of Alexandria, who spoke of the doubts held by some in the early third century. Eusebius classified it with the &quot;disputed writings, the &quot;antilegomena&quot;&quot; in the early fourth century. Eusebius doubted its authenticity partially because it was rarely quoted among ancient sources, although he acknowledges it was read in many churches. The links between the Epistle and 2 Peter and its use of the biblical apocrypha raised concern: Saint Jerome wrote in 392 AD that the book was &quot;rejected by many&quot; since it quotes the Book of Enoch. Even to the extent that the letter was accepted as canonical and useful, it likely circulated as an independent letter in the 2nd and 3rd centuries; it and the other general epistles only appear to have become part of somewhat standardized collections in manuscripts of the fourth century and afterward.

The oldest surviving versions of the Syriac Peshitta from the 5th- and 6th- centuries do not include Jude; nor 2 John, 3 John, 2 Peter, or Revelation. These works were added to the Syrian canon in the 6th century and afterward.

==Surviving early manuscripts==

Early manuscripts containing the text of the epistle of Jude include:
*Papyrus 72 (3rd/4th century)
*Papyrus 78 (3rd/4th century; extant verses 4–5, 7–8)
*Codex Vaticanus (B or 03; 325–350)
*Codex Sinaiticus ( or 01; 330–360)
*Codex Alexandrinus (A or 02; 400–440)
*Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (C or 04; c. 450; extant verses 3–25)

==Identity of the opponents==
The epistle fiercely condemns the opponents it warns of and declares that God will judge and punish them, despite them being a part of the Christian community. However, the exact nature of these opponents has been a continuing question, as the epistle does not describe them in any more detail than calling them corrupt and ungodly. Several theories have been proposed. The most specific verse describing the opponents is verse 8:
Reject &quot;authority&quot; (κυριότητα, &quot;kyriotēta&quot;; alternate translations include &quot;dominion&quot; or &quot;lordship&quot;) could mean several things. The most direct would be rejection of civil or ecclesiastical authority: the opponents were ignoring guidance from leaders. Martin Luther and Jean Calvin agreed with this interpretation, and it is the most common one. Another possibility is that this specifically referred to rejecting the authority of Jesus or God, which would agree with verse 4 and be reinforcing the claim that these opponents are not true Christians. A third possibility is that this is the singular of &quot;kyriotētes&quot; (Dominions), a class of angels. This would fit with the final part of the sentence of &quot;heap abuse on celestial beings&quot;, but it is unusual that the singular is used. Versions of Jude vary, and some manuscripts such as the Codex Sinaiticus indeed use the plural form.

&quot;Heap abuse on celestial beings&quot; is also a relevant statement, as it stands in some tension with the works of Paul the Apostle as well as the Epistle to the Hebrews. Paul&#x27;s undisputed works indicate that believers are already on the same level as angels, that all existing powers are subject to Christ, and believers are the future judges of angels. Later writings attributed to Paul such as Colossians and Ephesians go even further, with Colossians decrying the alleged worship of angels. A hypothesis is thus that the author may have been attacking forms of Pauline Christianity that were not suitably deferential to angels in their opinion. &quot;Rejecting authority&quot; may be a reference to Paul&#x27;s preaching that gentiles did not need to comply with Jewish Law. As James was known to be a major figure among Jewish Christians, this might indicate tension between the more Jewish strands of early Christianity represented by James and Jude set against Paul&#x27;s message to the gentiles. However, the line about &quot;heap abuse on celestial beings&quot; might have essentially been just another insult, in which case this entire line of thought is rendered moot.

Another hypothesis is that the opponents may have been proto-Gnostics, argued for by scholars such as . Proposed evidence in support of this includes that in verse 19, the opponents are called &quot;worldly&quot; (&quot;psychikoi&quot;), a term also used in relation to Gnosticism in other literature. While it does seem Jude may have been used to attack Gnostics in later centuries, other scholars think this was unlikely to be the original intent, as the opponents aren&#x27;t described as having the signature doctrines of Gnosticism, and Gnosticism does not seem to have been a major force in first century Christianity. Richard Bauckham, arguing against such a connection, writes that &quot;If [Jude]&#x27;s polemic is really aimed against Gnosticism it is singularly inept.&quot;

The inherent vagueness of the epistle means that the identities of these opponents may never be known.

==Similarity to 2 Peter==

Part of Jude is very similar to 2 Peter (mainly 2 Peter chapter 2); so much so that most scholars agree that either one letter used the other directly, or they both drew on a common source. Comparing the Greek text portions of 2 Peter 2:1–3:3 (426 words) to Jude 4–18 (311 words) results in 80 words in common and 7 words of substituted synonyms.

Because this epistle is much shorter than 2 Peter, and due to various stylistic details, most scholars consider Jude the source for the similar passages of 2 Peter. 2 Peter omits the reference to the non-canonical book of Enoch, or apocalyptic Jewish works in general; perhaps an indication of shifting attitudes of the early 2nd century, in the view where 2 Peter came later.

Advocates of the reverse are generally traditionalists who assign an early date to 2 Peter, such that it was published during Peter&#x27;s lifetime. 
They argue that Jude 18 quotes 2 Peter 3:3 as past tense, and consider Jude to have come after 2 Peter.

The Epistle of Jude references at least three other books, with two (Book of Zechariah &amp; 2 Peter) being canonical in all churches and the other (Book of Enoch) non-canonical in most churches.

Verse 9 refers to a dispute between Michael the Archangel and the devil about the body of Moses. Some interpreters understand this reference to be an allusion to the events described in Zechariah 3:1–2. The classical theologian Origen, as well as Clement of Alexandria, Didymus the Blind, and others, attributes this reference to the non-canonical Assumption of Moses. However, no extant copies of the Assumption of Moses contain this story, leading most scholars to conclude the section covering this dispute has been lost – perhaps a lost ending, since a story involving Moses&#x27;s body would logically occur at the end. Some scholars disagree; James Charlesworth argues that the Assumption of Moses never contained any such content, and other ancient Church writers supported a different origin.

Verses 14–15 contain a direct quotation of a prophecy from 1 Enoch 1:9. The title &quot;Enoch, the seventh from Adam&quot; is also sourced from 1 En. 60:1. Most commentators assume that this indicates that Jude accepts the antediluvian patriarch Enoch as the author of the Book of Enoch which contains the same quotation. An alternative explanation is that Jude quotes the Book of Enoch aware that verses 14–15 are an expansion of the words of Moses from Deuteronomy 33:2.

The Book of Enoch is not considered canonical by most churches, although it is by the Ethiopian Orthodox church. According to Western scholars, the older sections of the Book of Enoch (mainly in the &quot;Book of the Watchers&quot;) date from about 300 BC and the latest part (&quot;Book of Parables&quot;) probably was composed at the end of the 1st century BC. 1 Enoch 1:9, mentioned above, is part of the pseudepigrapha and is among the Dead Sea Scrolls [4Q Enoch (4Q204[4QENAR]) COL I 16–18]. It is largely accepted by scholars that the author of the Epistle of Jude was familiar with the Book of Enoch and was influenced by it in thought and diction. The reference to fallen angels suggests the possibility the author was familiar with related literature to Enoch such as the Book of Jubilees and 2 Baruch as well.

The epistle also closely mirrors the Epistle of James, with many similar sentences and borrowed phrases.

==Influence==
In general, Jude did not have much influence in later Christianity, not appearing often in sermons preached to laypeople nor in treatises by Christian theologians. One author wrote &quot;Only its benediction may be familiar to an average churchgoer&quot; and that &quot;New Testament theologians have ignored the book&quot;.

<text>Eusebius Amort (November 15, 1692February 5, 1775) was a German Roman Catholic theologian.

==Life==
Amort was born at Bibermuhle, near Tolz, in Upper Bavaria. He studied at Munich, and at an early age joined the Canons Regular at Polling, where, shortly after his ordination in 1717, he taught theology and philosophy.
The Parnassus Boicus learned society was based on a plan started in 1720 by three Augustinian fathers: Eusebius Amort, Gelasius Hieber (1671–1731), a famous preacher in the German language and Agnellus Kandler (1692–1745), a genealogist and librarian. The initial plans fell through, but in 1722 they issued the first volume of the &quot;Parnassus Boicus&quot; journal, covering topics in the arts and sciences.

An academy formed by him at Polling became in time the model on which was based the Academy of Sciences of Munich.

In 1733 Amort went to Rome as theologian to Cardinal Niccolo Maria Lercari (died 1757).
He returned to Polling in 1735 and devoted the rest of his life to the revival of learning in Bavaria. He died at Polling in 1775.

==Works==
Amort, who had the reputation of being the most learned man of his age, was a voluminous writer on every conceivable subject, from poetry to astronomy, from dogmatic theology to mysticism. His best known works are:

*A manual of theology in 4 vols, &quot;Theologia eclectica, moralis et scholastica&quot; (Augsburg, 1752; revised by Pope Benedict XIV for the 1753 edition published at Bologna)
*A defence of Catholic doctrine, entitled &quot;Demonstratio critica religionis Catholicae&quot; (Augsburg, 1751)
*A work on indulgences, which has often been criticized by Protestant writers, &quot;De Origine, Progressu, Valore, et Fructu Indulgentiorum&quot; (Augsburg, 1735)
*The astronomical work &quot;Nova philosophiae planetarum et artis criticae systemata&quot; (Nuremberg, 1723).

A treatise on mysticism, &quot;De Revelationibus et Visionibus, etc.&quot; (2 vols, Augsburg 1744) was directed against the &quot;Mystic City of God,&quot; by the Spanish Franciscan nun, Maria de Agreda, and brought him into conflict with several of her Franciscan defenders.

The list of his other works, including his three erudite contributions to the question of authorship of the &quot;Imitatio Christi&quot;, will be found in C. Toussaint&#x27;s scholarly article in Alfred Vacant&#x27;s &quot;Dictionnaire de theologie&quot; (1900, cols 1115–1117).

<text>In Christianity, an &#x27; (plural &#x27;; Latin for &#x27;wandering bishops&#x27; or &#x27;stray bishops&#x27;) is a person consecrated, in a &quot;clandestine or irregular way&quot;, as a bishop outside the structures and canon law of the established churches; a person regularly consecrated but later excommunicated, and not in communion with any generally recognized diocese; or a person who has in communion with them small groups that appear to exist solely for the bishop&#x27;s sake.

David V. Barrett, in the &quot;Encyclopedia of New Religious Movements&quot;, specifies that are now &quot;those independent bishops who collect several different lines of transmission of apostolic succession, and who will happily (and sometimes for a fee) consecrate anyone who requests it&quot;. Those described as wandering bishops often see the term as pejorative. The general term for &quot;wandering&quot; clerics, as were common in the Middle Ages, is ; the general term for those recognising no leader is .

The &quot;Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church&quot; mentions as the main lines of succession deriving from in the 20th century those founded by Arnold Mathew, Joseph René Vilatte and Leon Chechemian.

==History==
According to Buchanan, &quot;the real rise of the problem&quot; happened in the 19th century, in the &quot;wake of the Anglo-Catholic movement&quot;, &quot;through mischievous activities of a tiny number of independently acting bishops&quot;. They exist worldwide, he writes, &quot;mostly without congregations&quot;, and &quot;many in different stages of delusion and fantasy, not least in the Episcopal titles they confer on themselves&quot;; &quot;the distinguishing mark&quot; to &quot;specifically identif[y]&quot; an &quot;episcopus vagans&quot; is &quot;the lack of a true see or the lack of a real church life to oversee&quot;.

Paul Halsall, on the Internet History Sourcebooks Project, did not list a single church edifice of independent bishops, in a 1996–1998 New York City building architecture survey of religious communities, which maintain bishops claiming apostolic succession and claim cathedral status but noted there &quot;are now literally hundreds of these &quot;, of lesser or greater spiritual . They seem to have a tendency to call living room sanctuaries &#x27;cathedrals&#x27;;&quot; those buildings were not perceived as cultural symbols and did not meet the survey criteria. David V. Barrett wrote, in &quot;A Brief Guide to Secret Religions&quot;, that &quot;one hallmark of such bishops is that they often collect as many lineages as they can to strengthen their Episcopal legitimacy—at least in their own eyes&quot;, and adds that their groups have more clergy than members.

Barrett wrote that leaders &quot;of some esoteric movements, are also priests or bishops in small non-mainstream Christian Churches&quot;; he explains, this type of &quot;independent or autocephalous&quot; group has &quot;little in common with the Church it developed from, the Old Catholic Church, and even less in common with the Roman Catholic Church&quot; but still claims its authority from apostolic succession.

Buchanan writes that based the criteria of having &quot;a true see&quot; or having &quot;a real church life to oversee&quot;, the bishops of most forms of the Continuing Anglican movement are not necessarily classified as vagantes, but &quot;are always in danger of becoming such&quot;.

==Theological issues==

=== Catholic ===
A Roman or Eastern Catholic ordained to the episcopacy without a mandate from the Pope is automatically excommunicated and is thereby forbidden to celebrate the sacraments under Catholic canon law. However, in light of the sacramental character of the episcopacy in Catholic theology and of the doctrine of &quot;ex opere operato&quot; (according to which the efficacy of a sacrament does not depend on the merits of the person who performs or who receives the sacrament) such an ordination is considered &quot;valid but illicit&quot;. This means that, although excommunicated and forbidden from carrying out any ministry under the authority of the Catholic church, an individual thus ordained is regarded as having the full sacramental powers of a bishop, including the power to ordain other bishops.

On the other hand, the view expressed by the International Bishops&#x27; Conference of the Old Catholic Church with regard to the ordinations by Arnold Mathew is that the episcopacy exists for service within a specific Christian church and, therefore, that an ordination ceremony that concerns only the individual himself does not make him truly a bishop. The Vatican has not commented on whether it concurs with this interpretation, but it has declared with regard to ordinations of this kind carried out, for example, by Emmanuel Milingo upon Peter Paul Brennan and others, that the Catholic Church &quot;does not recognize and does not intend to recognize in the future those ordinations or any of the ordinations derived from them and therefore the canonical state of the alleged bishops remains that in which they were before the ordination conferred by Mr Milingo&quot;.

===Eastern Orthodox===
Vlassios Pheidas, on an official Church of Greece site, uses the canonical language of the Eastern Orthodox tradition, to describe the conditions in ecclesial praxis when sacraments, including Holy Orders, are real, valid, and efficacious. He notes language is itself part of the ecclesiological problem.
This applies to the validity and efficacy of the ordination of bishops and the other sacraments, not only of the Independent Catholic churches, but also of all other Christian churches, including the Roman Catholic Church, Oriental Orthodoxy and the Assyrian Church of the East. However, although strict adherence to law supersedes economy by their Cyprian understanding, some mainstream Eastern Orthodox bodies recognize Roman Catholic orders and don&#x27;t conditionally ordain clergy as each autocephalous church determines the validity of another&#x27;s ordination. The Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople likewise teaches that through &quot;extreme oikonomia [economy]&quot;, those who are baptized in the Oriental Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Lutheran, Old Catholic, Moravian, Anglican, Methodist, Reformed, Presbyterian, Church of the Brethren, Assemblies of God, or Baptist traditions can be received into the Eastern Orthodox Church through the sacrament of Chrismation and not through re-baptism.

===Anglican===
Anglican bishop Colin Buchanan, in the &quot;Historical Dictionary of Anglicanism&quot;, says that the Anglican Communion has held an Augustinian view of orders, by which &quot;the validity of Episcopal ordinations (to whichever order) is based solely upon the historic succession in which the ordaining bishop stands, irrespective of their contemporary ecclesial context&quot;.

He describes the circumstances of Archbishop Matthew Parker&#x27;s consecration as one of the reasons why this theory is &quot;generally held&quot;. Parker was chosen by Queen Elizabeth I of England to be the first Church of England Archbishop of Canterbury after the death of the previous office holder, Cardinal Reginald Pole, the last Roman Catholic Archbishop of Canterbury. Buchanan notes the Roman Catholic Church also focuses on issues of intention and not just breaks in historical succession. He does not explain whether intention has an ecclesiological role, for Anglicans, in conferring or receiving sacraments.

==Particular consecrations==
Arnold Mathew, according to Buchanan, &quot;lapsed into the vagaries of an &quot;&quot;&quot;. Stephen Edmonds, in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, wrote that in 1910 Mathew&#x27;s wife separated from him; that same year, he declared himself and his church seceded from the Union of Utrecht. Within a few months, on 2 November 1911, he was excommunicated by the Roman Catholic Church. He later sued &quot;The Times&quot; for libel based on the words &quot;pseudo-bishop&quot; used to describe him in the newspaper&#x27;s translation from the Latin text &quot;&quot;, and, lost his case in 1913.

Henry R.T. Brandreth wrote, in &quot;Episcopi Vagantes and the Anglican Church&quot;, &quot;[o]ne of the most regrettable features of Mathew&#x27;s episcopate was the founding of the Order of Corporate Reunion (OCR) in 1908. This claimed to be a revival of Frederick George Lee&#x27;s movement, but was in fact unconnected with it&quot;. Brandreth thought it &quot;seems still to exist in a shadowy underground way&quot; in 1947, but disconnected. Colin Holden, in &quot;Ritualist on a Tricycle&quot;, places Mathew and his into perspective, he wrote Mathew was an &quot;&quot;, lived in a cottage provided for him, and performed his conditional acts, sometimes called according to Holden &quot;bedroom ordinations&quot;, in his cottage. Mathew questioned the validity of Anglican ordinations and became involved with the OCR, in 1911 according to Edmonds, and he openly advertised his offer to reordain Anglican clergy who requested it. This angered the Church of England.

In 1912, D. J. Scannell O&#x27;Neill wrote in &quot;The Fortnightly Review&quot; that London &quot;seems to have more than her due share of bishops&quot; and enumerates what he refers to as &quot;these hireling shepherds&quot;. He also announces that one of them, Mathew, revived the OCR and published &quot;The Torch&quot;, a monthly review, advocating the reconstruction of Western Christianity and reunion with Eastern Christianity. &quot;The Torch&quot; stated &quot;that the ordinations of the Church of England are not recognized by any church claiming to be Catholic&quot; so the promoters involved Mathew to conditionally ordain group members who are &quot;clergy of the Established Church&quot; and &quot;sign a profession of the Catholic Faith&quot;. It stipulated Mathew&#x27;s services were not a system of simony and given without expectations. The group sought to enroll &quot;earnest-minded Catholics who sincerely desire to help forward the work of [c]orporate [r]eunion with the Holy See&quot;. Nigel Yates, in &quot;Anglican Ritualism in Victorian Britain, 1830-1910&quot;, described it as &quot;an even more bizarre scheme to promote a Catholic Uniate Church in Britain&quot; than Lee and Ambrose Lisle March Phillipps de Lisle&#x27;s Association for the Promotion of the Unity of Christendom. It was editorialized by O&#x27;Neill that the &quot;most charitable construction to be placed on this latest move of Mathew is that he is not mentally sound. Being an Irishman, it is strange that he has not sufficient humor to see the absurdity of falling away from the Catholic Church in order to assist others to unite with the Holy See&quot;. Edmonds reports that &quot;anything between 4 and 265 was suggested&quot; as to how many took up his offer of reordination.

<text>Elizabeth Garrett Anderson (9 June 1836 – 17 December 1917) was an English physician and suffragist. She is known for being the first woman to qualify in Britain as a physician and surgeon and as a co-founder and dean of the London School of Medicine for Women, which was the first medical school in Britain to train women as doctors. She was the first female dean of a British medical school, the first woman in Britain to be elected to a school board and, as mayor of Aldeburgh, the first female mayor in Britain.

== Early life ==

Elizabeth was born in Whitechapel, London, and was the second of eleven children of Newson Garrett (1812–1893), from Leiston, Suffolk, and his wife, Louisa (born Dunnell; 1813–1903), from London.

Her paternal ancestors had been ironworkers in East Suffolk since the early seventeenth century. Newson was the youngest of three sons and not academically inclined, although he possessed the family&#x27;s entrepreneurial spirit. When he finished school, Newson found few opportunities in Leiston, so he moved to London to make his fortune. There, he fell in love with his brother&#x27;s sister-in-law, Louisa Dunnell, the daughter of an innkeeper of Suffolk origin. After their wedding, the couple went to live in a pawnbroker&#x27;s shop at 1 Commercial Road, Whitechapel. The Garretts had their first three children in quick succession: Louisa, Elizabeth, and a son, Dunnell, who died at the age of six months. When Garrett was three years old, the family moved to 142 Long Acre, where they lived for two years, while one more child was born and her father advanced in his career, becoming not only the manager of a larger pawnbroker&#x27;s shop, but also a silversmith. Garrett&#x27;s grandfather, owner of the family engineering works, Richard Garrett &amp; Sons, had died in 1837, leaving the business to his eldest son, Garrett&#x27;s uncle. Despite his lack of capital, Newson was determined to be successful and in 1841, at the age of 29, he moved his family to Suffolk, where he bought a barley and coal merchants business in Snape, constructing Snape Maltings from 1846.

The Garretts lived in a square Georgian house opposite the church in Aldeburgh until 1852. Newson&#x27;s malting business expanded and more children were born, Edmund (1840), Alice (1842), Agnes (1845), Millicent (1847), who was to become a leader in the constitutional campaign for women&#x27;s suffrage, Sam (1850), Josephine (1853) and George (1854). By 1850, Newson was a prosperous businessman and was able to build Alde House, a mansion on a hill behind Aldeburgh. A &quot;by-product of the industrial revolution&quot;, Garrett grew up in an atmosphere of &quot;triumphant economic pioneering&quot; and the Garrett children were to grow up to become achievers in the professional classes of late-Victorian England. Elizabeth was encouraged to take an interest in local politics and, contrary to practices at the time, was allowed the freedom to explore the town with its nearby salt-marshes, beach and the small port of Slaughden with its boatbuilders&#x27; yards and sailmakers&#x27; lofts.

== Early education ==
There was no school in Aldeburgh, so Garrett learned reading, writing, and arithmetic from her mother. When she was 10 years old, a governess, Miss Edgeworth, a poor gentlewoman, was employed to educate Garrett and her sister. Mornings were spent in the schoolroom; there were regimented afternoon walks; educating the young ladies continued at mealtimes when Edgeworth ate with the family; at night, the governess slept in a curtained off area in the girls&#x27; bedroom. Garrett reportedly despised her governess and sought to outwit the teacher in the classroom. When Garrett was 13 and her sister 15, they were sent to a private school, the Boarding School for Ladies in Blackheath, London, which was run by the step aunts of the poet Robert Browning. There, English literature, French, Italian and German as well as deportment, were taught.
Later in life, Garrett recalled the stupidity of her teachers there, though her schooling there did help establish a love of reading. Her main complaint about the school was the lack of science and mathematics instruction. Her reading there included works of Tennyson, Wordsworth, Milton, Coleridge, Trollope, Thackeray and George Eliot. Elizabeth and Louie were known as &quot;the bathing Garretts&quot;, as their father had insisted they be allowed a hot bath once a week. However, they made what were to be lifelong friends there. When they finished in 1851, they were sent on a short tour abroad, ending with a memorable visit to the Great Exhibition in Hyde Park, London.

After this formal education, Garrett spent the next nine years tending to domestic duties, but she continued to study Latin and arithmetic in the mornings and also read widely. Her sister Millicent recalled Garrett&#x27;s weekly lectures, &quot;Talks on Things in General&quot;, when her younger siblings would gather while she discussed politics and current affairs from Garibaldi to Macaulay&#x27;s &quot;History of England&quot;. In 1854, when she was eighteen, Garrett and her sister went on a long visit to their school friends, Jane and Anne Crow, in Gateshead where she met Emily Davies, the early feminist and future co-founder of Girton College, Cambridge. Davies was to be a lifelong friend and confidante, always ready to give sound advice during the important decisions of Garrett&#x27;s career. It may have been in the &quot;English Woman&#x27;s Journal&quot;, first issued in 1858, that Garrett first read of Elizabeth Blackwell, who had become the first female doctor in the United States in 1849. When Blackwell visited London in 1859, Garrett travelled to the capital. By then, her sister Louie was married and living in London. Garrett joined the Society for Promoting the Employment of Women, which organised Blackwell&#x27;s lectures on &quot;Medicine as a Profession for Ladies&quot; and set up a private meeting between Garrett and the doctor. It is said that during a visit to Alde House around 1860, one evening while sitting by the fireside, Garrett and Davies selected careers for advancing the frontiers of women&#x27;s rights; Garrett was to open the medical profession to women, Davies the doors to a university education for women, while 13-year-old Millicent was allocated politics and votes for women. At first Newson was opposed to the radical idea of his daughter becoming a physician but came round and agreed to do all in his power, both financially and otherwise, to support Garrett.

== Medical education ==

After an initial unsuccessful visit to leading doctors in Harley Street, Garrett decided to first spend six months as a surgery nurse at Middlesex Hospital, London in August 1860. On proving to be a good nurse, she was allowed to attend an outpatients&#x27; clinic, then her first operation. She unsuccessfully attempted to enroll in the hospital&#x27;s Medical School but was allowed to attend private tuition in Latin, Greek and pharmacology with the hospital&#x27;s apothecary, while continuing her work as a nurse. She also employed a tutor to study anatomy and physiology three evenings a week. Eventually she was allowed into the dissecting room and the chemistry lectures. Gradually, Garrett became an unwelcome presence among the male students, who in 1861 presented a memorial to the school against her admittance as a fellow student, despite the support she enjoyed from the administration. She was obliged to leave the Middlesex Hospital but she did so with an honours certificate in chemistry and &quot;materia medica&quot;. Garrett then applied to several medical schools, including Oxford, Cambridge, Glasgow, Edinburgh, St Andrews and the Royal College of Surgeons, all of which refused her admittance.

A companion to Garrett in this effort was the lesser known Sophia Jex-Blake. While both are considered &quot;outstanding&quot; medical figures of the late 19th century, Garrett was able to obtain her credentials by way of a &quot;side door&quot; through a loophole in admissions at the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries. Having privately obtained a certificate in anatomy and physiology, she was admitted in 1862 by the Society of Apothecaries who, as a condition of their charter, could not legally exclude her on account of her sex. She was the only woman in the Apothecaries Hall who sat the exam that year. Among the 51 male candidates was William Heath Strange, who went on to found the Hampstead General Hospital, which was on the site now occupied by the Royal Free Hospital. She continued her battle to qualify by studying privately with various professors, including some at the University of St Andrews, the Edinburgh Royal Maternity and the London Hospital Medical School.

In 1865, Garrett finally took her exam and obtained a licence (LSA) from the Society of Apothecaries to practise medicine, the first woman qualified in Britain to do so openly (previously there was Dr James Barry who was born and raised female but presented as male from the age of 20). On the day, three out of seven candidates passed the exam, Garrett with the highest marks. The Society of Apothecaries immediately amended its regulations to prevent other women obtaining a licence meaning that Jex-Blake could not follow this same path; the new rule disallowed privately educated women to be eligible for examination. It was not until 1876 that the new Medical Act (39 and 40 Vict, Ch. 41) passed, which allowed British medical authorities to license all qualified applicants whatever their gender.

== Career ==

Though she was now a licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries, as a woman, Garrett could not hold a medical post in any hospital. So in late 1865, Garrett opened her own practice at 20 Upper Berkeley Street, London. At first patients were scarce, but the practice gradually grew. After six months in practice, she wished to open an outpatients dispensary, to enable poor women to obtain medical help from a qualified practitioner of their own gender. In 1865, there was an outbreak of cholera in Britain, affecting both rich and poor, and in their panic, some people forgot any prejudices they had in relation to a female physician. The first death due to cholera occurred in 1866, but by then Garrett had already opened St Mary&#x27;s Dispensary for Women and Children, at 69 Seymour Place. In the first year, she tended to 3,000 new patients, who made 9,300 outpatient visits to the dispensary. On hearing that the Dean of the faculty of medicine at the University of Sorbonne, Paris was in favour of admitting women as medical students, Garrett studied French so that she could apply for a medical degree, which she obtained in 1870 after some difficulty.
The same year she was elected to the first London School Board, an office newly opened to women; Garrett&#x27;s was the highest vote among all the candidates. Also in that year, she was made a visiting physician of the East London Hospital for Children (later the Queen Elizabeth Hospital for Children), becoming the first woman in Britain to be appointed to a medical post, but she found the duties of these two positions to be incompatible with her principal work in her private practice and the dispensary, as well as her role as a new mother, so she resigned from these posts by 1873. In 1872, the dispensary became the New Hospital for Women and Children, treating women from all over London for gynaecological conditions; the hospital moved to new premises in Marylebone Street in 1874. Around this time, Garrett also entered into discussion with male medical views regarding women. In 1874, Henry Maudsley&#x27;s article on Sex and Mind in Education appeared, which argued that education for women caused over-exertion and thus reduced their reproductive capacity, sometimes causing &quot;nervous and even mental disorders&quot;. Garrett&#x27;s counter-argument was that the real danger for women was not education but boredom and that fresh air and exercise were preferable to sitting by the fire with a novel. In the same year, she co-founded the London School of Medicine for Women with Sophia Jex-Blake and became a lecturer in what was then the only teaching hospital in Britain to offer courses for women. She continued to work there for the rest of her career and was dean of the school from 1883 to 1902. This school was later called the Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine, and became part of the medical school of University College London.

=== BMA membership ===
In 1873, Garrett gained membership of the British Medical Association (BMA). In 1878, a motion was proposed to exclude women following the election of Garrett Anderson and Frances Hoggan. The motion was opposed by Dr Norman Kerr who maintained the equal rights of members. This was &quot;one of several instances where Garrett, uniquely, was able to enter a hitherto all male medical institution which subsequently moved formally to exclude any women who might seek to follow her.&quot; In 1892, women were again admitted to the British Medical Association following a long campaign by Anderson and others. She, along with Dr Sarah Gray and Dr Eliza Walker Dunbar attended the BMA meeting at Nottingham that year, lobbying successfully for the readmission of women to the association. In 1897, Garrett Anderson was elected president of the East Anglian branch of the BMA.
Garrett Anderson worked steadily at the development of the New Hospital for Women and Children and in 1874 co-founded and served as dean of the London School of Medicine for Women (LSMW). Both institutions were handsomely and suitably housed and equipped. The New Hospital for Women commissioned a building in the Euston Road; the architect was J. M. Brydon, who took into his employment Anderson&#x27;s sister Agnes Garrett and her cousin Rhoda Garrett, who contributed to its design. For many years, the hospital was staffed entirely by medical women. The schools (in Hunter Street, WC1) had over 200 students, most of them preparing for the medical degree of London University, which was opened to women in 1877.

== Women’s suffrage movement ==

Garrett Anderson was also active in the women&#x27;s suffrage movement. In 1866, Garrett Anderson and Davies presented petitions with more than 1,500 signatures asking that female heads of household be given the right to vote. That year, Garrett Anderson joined the first British Women&#x27;s Suffrage Committee. She was not as active as her sister, Millicent Garrett Fawcett, though Garrett Anderson became a member of the Central Committee of the National Society for Women&#x27;s Suffrage in 1889. After her husband&#x27;s death in 1907, she became more active. As mayor of Aldeburgh, she gave speeches for suffrage, before the increasing militant activity in the movement led to her withdrawal in 1911. Her daughter Louisa, also a physician, was more active and more militant, spending time in prison in 1912 for her suffrage activities.

== Personal life ==
Elizabeth Garrett Anderson once remarked that &quot;a doctor leads two lives, the professional and the private, and the boundaries between the two are never traversed&quot;. In 1871, she married James George Skelton Anderson (died 1907) of the Orient Steamship Company, but she did not give up her medical practice. She had three children, Louisa (1873–1943), Margaret (1874–1875), who died of meningitis, and Alan (1877–1952). Louisa also became a pioneering doctor of medicine and feminist activist.

They retired to Aldeburgh in 1902, moving to Alde House in 1903, after the death of Elizabeth&#x27;s mother. Skelton died of a stroke in 1907. She enjoyed a happy marriage and in later life, devoted time to Alde House, gardening, and travelling with younger members of the extended family.

On 9 November 1908, she was elected mayor of Aldeburgh, the first female mayor in England. Her father had been mayor in 1889.

She died in 1917 and is buried in the churchyard of St Peter and St Paul&#x27;s Church, Aldeburgh.

== Legacy ==

The New Hospital for Women was renamed the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital in 1918 and amalgamated with the Obstetric Hospital in 2001 to form the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson and Obstetric Hospital before relocating to become the University College Hospital Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Wing at UCH.

The former Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital buildings are incorporated into the new National Headquarters for the public service trade union UNISON. The Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Gallery, a permanent installation set within the restored hospital building, uses a variety of media to set the story of Garrett Anderson, her hospital, and women&#x27;s struggle to achieve equality in the field of medicine within the wider framework of 19th and 20th century social history.

The critical care centre at Ipswich Hospital was named the Garrett Anderson Centre in her honour and in recognition of her connection to the county of Suffolk.

The new medical school at the University of Worcester, due to accept its first students in 2023, is to be called the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Building.

Elizabeth Garrett Anderson School, a secondary school for girls in Islington, London, is named after her.

The archives of Elizabeth Garrett Anderson are held at the Women&#x27;s Library at the London School of Economics. The archives of the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital (formerly the New Hospital for Women) are held at the London Metropolitan Archives.

On 9 June 2016, Google Doodle commemorated her 180th birthday.

The Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Programme of the NHS Leadership Academy is a master&#x27;s degree in leadership and management.

<doc id="9696" wikidata="Q80026" url="?curid=9696" title="Erosion">
<text>Erosion is the action of surface processes (such as water flow or wind) that removes soil, rock, or dissolved material from one location on the Earth&#x27;s crust and then transports it to another location where it is deposited. Erosion is distinct from weathering which involves no movement. Removal of rock or soil as clastic sediment is referred to as &quot;physical&quot; or &quot;mechanical&quot; erosion; this contrasts with &quot;chemical&quot; erosion, where soil or rock material is removed from an area by dissolution. Eroded sediment or solutes may be transported just a few millimetres, or for thousands of kilometres.

Agents of erosion include rainfall; bedrock wear in rivers; coastal erosion by the sea and waves; glacial plucking, abrasion, and scour; areal flooding; wind abrasion; groundwater processes; and mass movement processes in steep landscapes like landslides and debris flows. The rates at which such processes act control how fast a surface is eroded. Typically, physical erosion proceeds the fastest on steeply sloping surfaces, and rates may also be sensitive to some climatically controlled properties including amounts of water supplied (e.g., by rain), storminess, wind speed, wave fetch, or atmospheric temperature (especially for some ice-related processes). Feedbacks are also possible between rates of erosion and the amount of eroded material that is already carried by, for example, a river or glacier. The transport of eroded materials from their original location is followed by deposition, which is arrival and emplacement of material at a new location.

While erosion is a natural process, human activities have increased by 10–40 times the rate at which soil erosion is occurring globally. At agriculture sites in the Appalachian Mountains, intensive farming practices have caused erosion at up to 100 times the natural rate of erosion in the region. Excessive (or accelerated) erosion causes both &quot;on-site&quot; and &quot;off-site&quot; problems. On-site impacts include decreases in agricultural productivity and (on natural landscapes) ecological collapse, both because of loss of the nutrient-rich upper soil layers. In some cases, this leads to desertification. Off-site effects include sedimentation of waterways and eutrophication of water bodies, as well as sediment-related damage to roads and houses. Water and wind erosion are the two primary causes of land degradation; combined, they are responsible for about 84% of the global extent of degraded land, making excessive erosion one of the most significant environmental problems worldwide.

Intensive agriculture, deforestation, roads, anthropogenic climate change and urban sprawl are amongst the most significant human activities in regard to their effect on stimulating erosion. However, there are many prevention and remediation practices that can curtail or limit erosion of vulnerable soils.


==Physical processes==
===Rainfall and surface runoff===

Rainfall, and the surface runoff which may result from rainfall, produces four main types of soil erosion: &quot;splash erosion&quot;, &quot;sheet erosion&quot;, &quot;rill erosion&quot;, and &quot;gully erosion&quot;. Splash erosion is generally seen as the first and least severe stage in the soil erosion process, which is followed by sheet erosion, then rill erosion and finally gully erosion (the most severe of the four).

In &quot;splash erosion&quot;, the impact of a falling raindrop creates a small crater in the soil, ejecting soil particles. The distance these soil particles travel can be as much as vertically and horizontally on level ground.

If the soil is saturated, or if the rainfall rate is greater than the rate at which water can infiltrate into the soil, surface runoff occurs. If the runoff has sufficient flow energy, it will transport loosened soil particles (sediment) down the slope. &quot;Sheet erosion&quot; is the transport of loosened soil particles by overland flow.

&quot;Rill erosion&quot; refers to the development of small, ephemeral concentrated flow paths which function as both sediment source and sediment delivery systems for erosion on hillslopes. Generally, where water erosion rates on disturbed upland areas are greatest, rills are active. Flow depths in rills are typically of the order of a few centimetres (about an inch) or less and along-channel slopes may be quite steep. This means that rills exhibit hydraulic physics very different from water flowing through the deeper, wider channels of streams and rivers.
&quot;Gully erosion&quot; occurs when runoff water accumulates and rapidly flows in narrow channels during or immediately after heavy rains or melting snow, removing soil to a considerable depth. A gully is distinguished from a rill based on a critical cross-sectional area of at least one square foot, i.e. the size of a channel that can no longer be erased via normal tillage operations.

Extreme gully erosion can progress to formation of badlands. These form under conditions of high relief on easily eroded bedrock in climates favorable to erosion. Conditions or disturbances that limit the growth of protective vegetation (rhexistasy) are a key element of badland formation.

===Rivers and streams===

&quot;Valley&quot; or &quot;stream erosion&quot; occurs with continued water flow along a linear feature. The erosion is both downward, deepening the valley, and headward, extending the valley into the hillside, creating head cuts and steep banks. In the earliest stage of stream erosion, the erosive activity is dominantly vertical, the valleys have a typical V-shaped cross-section and the stream gradient is relatively steep. When some base level is reached, the erosive activity switches to lateral erosion, which widens the valley floor and creates a narrow floodplain. The stream gradient becomes nearly flat, and lateral deposition of sediments becomes important as the stream meanders across the valley floor. In all stages of stream erosion, by far the most erosion occurs during times of flood when more and faster-moving water is available to carry a larger sediment load. In such processes, it is not the water alone that erodes: suspended abrasive particles, pebbles, and boulders can also act erosively as they traverse a surface, in a process known as &quot;traction&quot;.

&quot;Bank erosion&quot; is the wearing away of the banks of a stream or river. This is distinguished from changes on the bed of the watercourse, which is referred to as &quot;scour&quot;. Erosion and changes in the form of river banks may be measured by inserting metal rods into the bank and marking the position of the bank surface along the rods at different times.

&quot;Thermal erosion&quot; is the result of melting and weakening permafrost due to moving water. It can occur both along rivers and at the coast. Rapid river channel migration observed in the Lena River of Siberia is due to thermal erosion, as these portions of the banks are composed of permafrost-cemented non-cohesive materials. Much of this erosion occurs as the weakened banks fail in large slumps. Thermal erosion also affects the Arctic coast, where wave action and near-shore temperatures combine to undercut permafrost bluffs along the shoreline and cause them to fail. Annual erosion rates along a segment of the Beaufort Sea shoreline averaged per year from 1955 to 2002.

Most river erosion happens nearer to the mouth of a river. On a river bend, the longest least sharp side has slower moving water. Here deposits build up. On the narrowest sharpest side of the bend, there is faster moving water so this side tends to erode away mostly.

Rapid erosion by a large river can remove enough sediments to produce a river anticline, as isostatic rebound raises rock beds unburdened by erosion of overlying beds.

===Coastal erosion===


Shoreline erosion, which occurs on both exposed and sheltered coasts, primarily occurs through the action of currents and waves but sea level (tidal) change can also play a role.
&quot;Hydraulic action&quot; takes place when the air in a joint is suddenly compressed by a wave closing the entrance of the joint. This then cracks it. &quot;Wave pounding&quot; is when the sheer energy of the wave hitting the cliff or rock breaks pieces off. &quot;Abrasion&quot; or &quot;corrasion&quot; is caused by waves launching sea load at the cliff. It is the most effective and rapid form of shoreline erosion (not to be confused with &quot;corrosion&quot;). &quot;Corrosion&quot; is the dissolving of rock by carbonic acid in sea water. Limestone cliffs are particularly vulnerable to this kind of erosion. &quot;Attrition&quot; is where particles/sea load carried by the waves are worn down as they hit each other and the cliffs. This then makes the material easier to wash away. The material ends up as shingle and sand. Another significant source of erosion, particularly on carbonate coastlines, is boring, scraping and grinding of organisms, a process termed &quot;bioerosion&quot;.

Sediment is transported along the coast in the direction of the prevailing current (longshore drift). When the upcurrent supply of sediment is less than the amount being carried away, erosion occurs. When the upcurrent amount of sediment is greater, sand or gravel banks will tend to form as a result of deposition. These banks may slowly migrate along the coast in the direction of the longshore drift, alternately protecting and exposing parts of the coastline. Where there is a bend in the coastline, quite often a buildup of eroded material occurs forming a long narrow bank (a spit). Armoured beaches and submerged offshore sandbanks may also protect parts of a coastline from erosion. Over the years, as the shoals gradually shift, the erosion may be redirected to attack different parts of the shore.

Erosion of a coastal surface, followed by a fall in sea level, can produce a distinctive landform called a raised beach.

===Chemical erosion===
Chemical erosion is the loss of matter in a landscape in the form of solutes. Chemical erosion is usually calculated from the solutes found in streams. Anders Rapp pioneered the study of chemical erosion in his work about Kärkevagge published in 1960.

Formation of sinkholes and other features of karst topography is an example of extreme chemical erosion.

===Glaciers===
Glaciers erode predominantly by three different processes: abrasion/scouring, plucking, and ice thrusting. In an abrasion process, debris in the basal ice scrapes along the bed, polishing and gouging the underlying rocks, similar to sandpaper on wood. Scientists have shown that, in addition to the role of temperature played in valley-deepening, other glaciological processes, such as erosion also control cross-valley variations. In a homogeneous bedrock erosion pattern, curved channel cross-section beneath the ice is created. Though the glacier continues to incise vertically, the shape of the channel beneath the ice eventually remain constant, reaching a U-shaped parabolic steady-state shape as we now see in glaciated valleys. Scientists also provide a numerical estimate of the time required for the ultimate formation of a steady-shaped U-shaped valley—approximately 100,000 years. In a weak bedrock (containing material more erodible than the surrounding rocks) erosion pattern, on the contrary, the amount of over deepening is limited because ice velocities and erosion rates are reduced.

Glaciers can also cause pieces of bedrock to crack off in the process of plucking. In ice thrusting, the glacier freezes to its bed, then as it surges forward, it moves large sheets of frozen sediment at the base along with the glacier. This method produced some of the many thousands of lake basins that dot the edge of the Canadian Shield. Differences in the height of mountain ranges are not only being the result tectonic forces, such as rock uplift, but also local climate variations. Scientists use global analysis of topography to show that glacial erosion controls the maximum height of mountains, as the relief between mountain peaks and the snow line are generally confined to altitudes less than 1500 m. The erosion caused by glaciers worldwide erodes mountains so effectively that the term &quot;glacial buzzsaw&quot; has become widely used, which describes the limiting effect of glaciers on the height of mountain ranges. As mountains grow higher, they generally allow for more glacial activity (especially in the accumulation zone above the glacial equilibrium line altitude), which causes increased rates of erosion of the mountain, decreasing mass faster than isostatic rebound can add to the mountain. This provides a good example of a negative feedback loop. Ongoing research is showing that while glaciers tend to decrease mountain size, in some areas, glaciers can actually reduce the rate of erosion, acting as a &quot;glacial armor&quot;. Ice can not only erode mountains but also protect them from erosion. Depending on glacier regime, even steep alpine lands can be preserved through time with the help of ice. Scientists have proved this theory by sampling eight summits of northwestern Svalbard using Be10 and Al26, showing that northwestern Svalbard transformed from a glacier-erosion state under relatively mild glacial maxima temperature, to a glacier-armor state occupied by cold-based, protective ice during much colder glacial maxima temperatures as the Quaternary ice age progressed.

These processes, combined with erosion and transport by the water network beneath the glacier, leave behind glacial landforms such as moraines, drumlins, ground moraine (till), glaciokarst, kames, kame deltas, moulins, and glacial erratics in their wake, typically at the terminus or during glacier retreat.

The best-developed glacial valley morphology appears to be restricted to landscapes with low rock uplift rates (less than or equal to 2mm per year) and high relief, leading to long-turnover times. Where rock uplift rates exceed 2mm per year, glacial valley morphology has generally been significantly modified in postglacial time. Interplay of glacial erosion and tectonic forcing governs the morphologic impact of glaciations on active orogens, by both influencing their height, and by altering the patterns of erosion during subsequent glacial periods via a link between rock uplift and valley cross-sectional shape.

===Floods===

At extremely high flows, kolks, or vortices are formed by large volumes of rapidly rushing water. Kolks cause extreme local erosion, plucking bedrock and creating pothole-type geographical features called rock-cut basins. Examples can be seen in the flood regions result from glacial Lake Missoula, which created the channeled scablands in the Columbia Basin region of eastern Washington.

===Wind erosion===
Wind erosion is a major geomorphological force, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. It is also a major source of land degradation, evaporation, desertification, harmful airborne dust, and crop damage—especially after being increased far above natural rates by human activities such as deforestation, urbanization, and agriculture.

Wind erosion is of two primary varieties: &quot;deflation&quot;, where the wind picks up and carries away loose particles; and &quot;abrasion&quot;, where surfaces are worn down as they are struck by airborne particles carried by wind. Deflation is divided into three categories: (1) &quot;surface creep&quot;, where larger, heavier particles slide or roll along the ground; (2) &quot;saltation&quot;, where particles are lifted a short height into the air, and bounce and saltate across the surface of the soil; and (3) &quot;suspension&quot;, where very small and light particles are lifted into the air by the wind, and are often carried for long distances. Saltation is responsible for the majority (50–70%) of wind erosion, followed by suspension (30–40%), and then surface creep (5–25%).

Wind erosion is much more severe in arid areas and during times of drought. For example, in the Great Plains, it is estimated that soil loss due to wind erosion can be as much as 6100 times greater in drought years than in wet years.

===Mass wasting===
&quot;Mass wasting&quot; or &quot;mass movement&quot; is the downward and outward movement of rock and sediments on a sloped surface, mainly due to the force of gravity.

Mass wasting is an important part of the erosional process and is often the first stage in the breakdown and transport of weathered materials in mountainous areas. It moves material from higher elevations to lower elevations where other eroding agents such as streams and glaciers can then pick up the material and move it to even lower elevations. Mass-wasting processes are always occurring continuously on all slopes; some mass-wasting processes act very slowly; others occur very suddenly, often with disastrous results. Any perceptible down-slope movement of rock or sediment is often referred to in general terms as a landslide. However, landslides can be classified in a much more detailed way that reflects the mechanisms responsible for the movement and the velocity at which the movement occurs. One of the visible topographical manifestations of a very slow form of such activity is a scree slope.

&quot;Slumping&quot; happens on steep hillsides, occurring along distinct fracture zones, often within materials like clay that, once released, may move quite rapidly downhill. They will often show a spoon-shaped isostatic depression, in which the material has begun to slide downhill. In some cases, the slump is caused by water beneath the slope weakening it. In many cases it is simply the result of poor engineering along highways where it is a regular occurrence.

&quot;Surface creep&quot; is the slow movement of soil and rock debris by gravity which is usually not perceptible except through extended observation. However, the term can also describe the rolling of dislodged soil particles in diameter by wind along the soil surface.

===Submarine sediment gravity flows===

On the continental slope, erosion of the ocean floor to create channels and submarine canyons can result from the rapid downslope flow of sediment gravity flows, bodies of sediment-laden water that move rapidly downslope as turbidity currents. Where erosion by turbidity currents creates oversteepened slopes it can also trigger underwater landslides and debris flows. Turbidity currents can erode channels and canyons into substrates ranging from recently deposited unconsolidated sediments to hard crystalline bedrock. Almost all continental slopes and deep ocean basins display such channels and canyons resulting from sediment gravity flows and submarine canyons act as conduits for the transfer of sediment from the continents and shallow marine environments to the deep sea. Turbidites, which are the sedimentary deposits resulting from turbidity currents, comprise some of the thickest and largest sedimentary sequences on Earth, indicating that the associated erosional processes must also have played a prominent role in Earth&#x27;s history.

==Factors affecting erosion rates==
===Climate===

The amount and intensity of precipitation is the main climatic factor governing soil erosion by water. The relationship is particularly strong if heavy rainfall occurs at times when, or in locations where, the soil&#x27;s surface is not well protected by vegetation. This might be during periods when agricultural activities leave the soil bare, or in semi-arid regions where vegetation is naturally sparse. Wind erosion requires strong winds, particularly during times of drought when vegetation is sparse and soil is dry (and so is more erodible). Other climatic factors such as average temperature and temperature range may also affect erosion, via their effects on vegetation and soil properties. In general, given similar vegetation and ecosystems, areas with more precipitation (especially high-intensity rainfall), more wind, or more storms are expected to have more erosion.

In some areas of the world (e.g. the mid-western US), rainfall intensity is the primary determinant of erosivity (for a definition of &quot;erosivity&quot; check,) with higher intensity rainfall generally resulting in more soil erosion by water. The size and velocity of rain drops is also an important factor. Larger and higher-velocity rain drops have greater kinetic energy, and thus their impact will displace soil particles by larger distances than smaller, slower-moving rain drops.

In other regions of the world (e.g. western Europe), runoff and erosion result from relatively low intensities of stratiform rainfall falling onto the previously saturated soil. In such situations, rainfall amount rather than intensity is the main factor determining the severity of soil erosion by water. According to the climate change projections, erosivity will increase significantly in Europe and soil erosion may increase by 13–22.5% by 2050 

In Taiwan, where typhoon frequency increased significantly in the 21st century, a strong link has been drawn between the increase in storm frequency with an increase in sediment load in rivers and reservoirs, highlighting the impacts climate change can have on erosion.

===Vegetative cover===

Vegetation acts as an interface between the atmosphere and the soil. It increases the permeability of the soil to rainwater, thus decreasing runoff. It shelters the soil from winds, which results in decreased wind erosion, as well as advantageous changes in microclimate. The roots of the plants bind the soil together, and interweave with other roots, forming a more solid mass that is less susceptible to both water and wind erosion. The removal of vegetation increases the rate of surface erosion.

===Topography===
The topography of the land determines the velocity at which surface runoff will flow, which in turn determines the erosivity of the runoff. Longer, steeper slopes (especially those without adequate vegetative cover) are more susceptible to very high rates of erosion during heavy rains than shorter, less steep slopes. Steeper terrain is also more prone to mudslides, landslides, and other forms of gravitational erosion processes.

===Tectonics===

Tectonic processes control rates and distributions of erosion at the Earth&#x27;s surface. If the tectonic action causes part of the Earth&#x27;s surface (e.g., a mountain range) to be raised or lowered relative to surrounding areas, this must necessarily change the gradient of the land surface. Because erosion rates are almost always sensitive to the local slope (see above), this will change the rates of erosion in the uplifted area. Active tectonics also brings fresh, unweathered rock towards the surface, where it is exposed to the action of erosion.

However, erosion can also affect tectonic processes. The removal by erosion of large amounts of rock from a particular region, and its deposition elsewhere, can result in a lightening of the load on the lower crust and mantle. Because tectonic processes are driven by gradients in the stress field developed in the crust, this unloading can in turn cause tectonic or isostatic uplift in the region. In some cases, it has been hypothesised that these twin feedbacks can act to localize and enhance zones of very rapid exhumation of deep crustal rocks beneath places on the Earth&#x27;s surface with extremely high erosion rates, for example, beneath the extremely steep terrain of Nanga Parbat in the western Himalayas. Such a place has been called a &quot;tectonic aneurysm&quot;.

=== Development ===
Human land development, in forms including agricultural and urban development, is considered a significant factor in erosion and sediment transport, which aggravate food insecurity. In Taiwan, increases in sediment load in the northern, central, and southern regions of the island can be tracked with the timeline of development for each region throughout the 20th century. The intentional removal of soil and rock by humans is a form of erosion that has been named &quot;lisasion&quot;.

==Erosion at various scales==

===Mountain ranges===

Mountain ranges take millions of years to erode to the degree they effectively cease to exist. Scholars Pitman and Golovchenko estimate that it takes probably more than 450 million years to erode a mountain mass similar to the Himalaya into an almost-flat peneplain if there are no significant sea-level changes. Erosion of mountains massifs can create a pattern of equally high summits called summit accordance. It has been argued that extension during post-orogenic collapse is a more effective mechanism of lowering the height of orogenic mountains than erosion.

Examples of heavily eroded mountain ranges include the Timanides of Northern Russia. Erosion of this orogen has produced sediments that are now found in the East European Platform, including the Cambrian Sablya Formation near Lake Ladoga. Studies of these sediments indicate that it is likely that the erosion of the orogen began in the Cambrian and then intensified in the Ordovician.

===Soils===

If the erosion rate exceeds soil formation, erosion destroys the soil. Lower rates of erosion can prevent the formation of soil features that take time to develop. Inceptisols develop on eroded landscapes that, if stable, would have supported the formation of more developed Alfisols.

While erosion of soils is a natural process, human activities have increased by 10–40 times the rate at which erosion occurs globally. Excessive (or accelerated) erosion causes both &quot;on-site&quot; and &quot;off-site&quot; problems. On-site impacts include decreases in agricultural productivity and (on natural landscapes) ecological collapse, both because of loss of the nutrient-rich upper soil layers. In some cases, the eventual result is desertification. Off-site effects include sedimentation of waterways and eutrophication of water bodies, as well as sediment-related damage to roads and houses. Water and wind erosion are the two primary causes of land degradation; combined, they are responsible for about 84% of the global extent of degraded land, making excessive erosion one of the most significant environmental problems.

Often in the United States, farmers cultivating highly erodible land must comply with a conservation plan to be eligible for agricultural assistance.

<text>Euclidean space is the fundamental space of geometry, intended to represent physical space. Originally, in Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;, it was the three-dimensional space of Euclidean geometry, but in modern mathematics there are &quot;Euclidean spaces&quot; of any positive integer dimension &quot;n&quot;, which are called Euclidean &quot;n&quot;-spaces when one wants to specify their dimension. For &quot;n&quot; equal to one or two, they are commonly called respectively Euclidean lines and Euclidean planes. The qualifier &quot;Euclidean&quot; is used to distinguish Euclidean spaces from other spaces that were later considered in physics and modern mathematics.

Ancient Greek geometers introduced Euclidean space for modeling the physical space. Their work was collected by the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid in his &quot;Elements&quot;, with the great innovation of &quot;proving&quot; all properties of the space as theorems, by starting from a few fundamental properties, called &quot;postulates&quot;, which either were considered as evident (for example, there is exactly one straight line passing through two points), or seemed impossible to prove (parallel postulate).

After the introduction at the end of the 19th century of non-Euclidean geometries, the old postulates were re-formalized to define Euclidean spaces through axiomatic theory. Another definition of Euclidean spaces by means of vector spaces and linear algebra has been shown to be equivalent to the axiomatic definition. It is this definition that is more commonly used in modern mathematics, and detailed in this article. In all definitions, Euclidean spaces consist of points, which are defined only by the properties that they must have for forming a Euclidean space.

There is essentially only one Euclidean space of each dimension; that is, all Euclidean spaces of a given dimension are isomorphic. Therefore, it is usually possible to work with a specific Euclidean space, denoted formula_1 or formula_2, which can be represented using Cartesian coordinates as the real -space formula_3 equipped with the standard dot product.

==Definition==
===History of the definition===
Euclidean space was introduced by ancient Greeks as an abstraction of our physical space. Their great innovation, appearing in Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; was to build and &quot;prove&quot; all geometry by starting from a few very basic properties, which are abstracted from the physical world, and cannot be mathematically proved because of the lack of more basic tools. These properties are called postulates, or axioms in modern language. This way of defining Euclidean space is still in use under the name of synthetic geometry.

In 1637, René Descartes introduced Cartesian coordinates, and showed that these allow reducing geometric problems to algebraic computations with numbers. This reduction of geometry to algebra was a major change in point of view, as, until then, the real numbers were defined in terms of lengths and distances.

Euclidean geometry was not applied in spaces of dimension more than three until the 19th century. Ludwig Schläfli generalized Euclidean geometry to spaces of dimension , using both synthetic and algebraic methods, and discovered all of the regular polytopes (higher-dimensional analogues of the Platonic solids) that exist in Euclidean spaces of any dimension.

Despite the wide use of Descartes&#x27; approach, which was called analytic geometry, the definition of Euclidean space remained unchanged until the end of 19th century. The introduction of abstract vector spaces allowed their use in defining Euclidean spaces with a purely algebraic definition. This new definition has been shown to be equivalent to the classical definition in terms of geometric axioms. It is this algebraic definition that is now most often used for introducing Euclidean spaces.

===Motivation of the modern definition===
One way to think of the Euclidean plane is as a set of points satisfying certain relationships, expressible in terms of distance and angles. For example, there are two fundamental operations (referred to as motions) on the plane. One is translation, which means a shifting of the plane so that every point is shifted in the same direction and by the same distance. The other is rotation around a fixed point in the plane, in which all points in the plane turn around that fixed point through the same angle. One of the basic tenets of Euclidean geometry is that two figures (usually considered as subsets) of the plane should be considered equivalent (congruent) if one can be transformed into the other by some sequence of translations, rotations and reflections (see below).

In order to make all of this mathematically precise, the theory must clearly define what is a Euclidean space, and the related notions of distance, angle, translation, and rotation. Even when used in physical theories, Euclidean space is an abstraction detached from actual physical locations, specific reference frames, measurement instruments, and so on. A purely mathematical definition of Euclidean space also ignores questions of units of length and other physical dimensions: the distance in a &quot;mathematical&quot; space is a number, not something expressed in inches or metres.

The standard way to mathematically define a Euclidean space, as carried out in the remainder of this article, is as a set of points on which a real vector space acts – the &quot;space of translations&quot; which is equipped with an inner product. The action of translations makes the space an affine space, and this allows defining lines, planes, subspaces, dimension, and parallelism. The inner product allows defining distance and angles.

The set formula_3 of -tuples of real numbers equipped with the dot product is a Euclidean space of dimension . Conversely, the choice of a point called the &quot;origin&quot; and an orthonormal basis of the space of translations is equivalent with defining an isomorphism between a Euclidean space of dimension and formula_3 viewed as a Euclidean space.

It follows that everything that can be said about a Euclidean space can also be said about formula_6 Therefore, many authors, especially at elementary level, call formula_3 the standard Euclidean space of dimension , or simply &quot;the&quot; Euclidean space of dimension .
A reason for introducing such an abstract definition of Euclidean spaces, and for working with formula_2 instead of formula_3 is that it is often preferable to work in a &quot;coordinate-free&quot; and &quot;origin-free&quot; manner (that is, without choosing a preferred basis and a preferred origin). Another reason is that there is no standard origin nor any standard basis in the physical world.

===Technical definition===

A is a finite-dimensional inner product space over the real numbers.

A Euclidean space is an affine space over the reals such that the associated vector space is a Euclidean vector space. Euclidean spaces are sometimes called &quot;Euclidean affine spaces&quot; to distinguish them from Euclidean vector spaces.

If is a Euclidean space, its associated vector space (Euclidean vector space) is often denoted formula_10 The &quot;dimension&quot; of a Euclidean space is the dimension of its associated vector space.

The elements of are called &quot;points&quot;, and are commonly denoted by capital letters. The elements of formula_11 are called &quot;Euclidean vectors&quot; or &quot;free vectors&quot;. They are also called &quot;translations&quot;, although, properly speaking, a translation is the geometric transformation resulting from the action of a Euclidean vector on the Euclidean space.

The action of a translation on a point provides a point that is denoted . This action satisfies

formula_12

Note: The second in the left-hand side is a vector addition; each other denotes an action of a vector on a point. This notation is not ambiguous, as, to distinguish between the two meanings of , it suffices to look at the nature of its left argument.

The fact that the action is free and transitive means that, for every pair of points , there is exactly one displacement vector such that . This vector is denoted or formula_13

As previously explained, some of the basic properties of Euclidean spaces result from the structure of affine space. They are described in and its subsections. The properties resulting from the inner product are explained in and its subsections.

==Prototypical examples==
For any vector space, the addition acts freely and transitively on the vector space itself. Thus a Euclidean vector space can be viewed as a Euclidean space that has itself as the associated vector space.

A typical case of Euclidean vector space is formula_3 viewed as a vector space equipped with the dot product as an inner product. The importance of this particular example of Euclidean space lies in the fact that every Euclidean space is isomorphic to it. More precisely, given a Euclidean space of dimension , the choice of a point, called an &quot;origin&quot; and an orthonormal basis of formula_11 defines an isomorphism of Euclidean spaces from to formula_6

As every Euclidean space of dimension is isomorphic to it, the Euclidean space formula_3 is sometimes called the &quot;standard Euclidean space&quot; of dimension .

==Affine structure==
Some basic properties of Euclidean spaces depend only on the fact that a Euclidean space is an affine space. They are called affine properties and include the concepts of lines, subspaces, and parallelism, which are detailed in next subsections.

===Subspaces===

Let be a Euclidean space and formula_11 its associated vector space.

A &quot;flat&quot;, &quot;Euclidean subspace&quot; or &quot;affine subspace&quot; of is a subset of such that

formula_19

as the associated vector space of is a linear subspace (vector subspace) of formula_10 A Euclidean subspace is a Euclidean space with formula_21 as the associated vector space. This linear subspace formula_21 is also called the &quot;direction&quot; of .

If is a point of then

formula_23

Conversely, if is a point of and formula_24 is a linear subspace of formula_25 then

formula_26

is a Euclidean subspace of direction formula_24. (The associated vector space of this subspace is formula_24.)

A Euclidean vector space formula_11 (that is, a Euclidean space that is equal to formula_11) has two sorts of subspaces: its Euclidean subspaces and its linear subspaces. Linear subspaces are Euclidean subspaces and a Euclidean subspace is a linear subspace if and only if it contains the zero vector.

===Lines and segments===

In a Euclidean space, a &quot;line&quot; is a Euclidean subspace of dimension one. Since a vector space of dimension one is spanned by any nonzero vector, a line is a set of the form

formula_31

where and are two distinct points of the Euclidean space as a part of the line.

It follows that &quot;there is exactly one line that passes through (contains) two distinct points.&quot; This implies that two distinct lines intersect in at most one point.

A more symmetric representation of the line passing through and is

formula_32

where is an arbitrary point (not necessary on the line).

In a Euclidean vector space, the zero vector is usually chosen for ; this allows simplifying the preceding formula into

formula_33

A standard convention allows using this formula in every Euclidean space, see .

The &quot;line segment&quot;, or simply &quot;segment&quot;, joining the points and is the subset of points such that in the preceding formulas. It is denoted or ; that is

formula_34

===Parallelism===
Two subspaces and of the same dimension in a Euclidean space are &quot;parallel&quot; if they have the same direction (i.e., the same associated vector space). Equivalently, they are parallel, if there is a translation vector that maps one to the other:

formula_35

Given a point and a subspace , there exists exactly one subspace that contains and is parallel to , which is formula_36 In the case where is a line (subspace of dimension one), this property is Playfair&#x27;s axiom.

It follows that in a Euclidean plane, two lines either meet in one point or are parallel.

The concept of parallel subspaces has been extended to subspaces of different dimensions: two subspaces are parallel if the direction of one of them is contained in the direction to the other.

==Metric structure==
The vector space formula_11 associated to a Euclidean space is an inner product space. This implies a symmetric bilinear form

formula_38

that is positive definite (that is formula_39 is always positive for ).

The inner product of a Euclidean space is often called &quot;dot product&quot; and denoted . This is specially the case when a Cartesian coordinate system has been chosen, as, in this case, the inner product of two vectors is the dot product of their coordinate vectors. For this reason, and for historical reasons, the dot notation is more commonly used than the bracket notation for the inner product of Euclidean spaces. This article will follow this usage; that is formula_40 will be denoted in the remainder of this article.

The Euclidean norm of a vector is

formula_41

The inner product and the norm allows expressing and proving metric and topological properties of Euclidean geometry. The next subsection describe the most fundamental ones. &quot;In these subsections,&quot; &quot;denotes an arbitrary Euclidean space, and formula_11 denotes its vector space of translations.&quot;

===Distance and length===

The &quot;distance&quot; (more precisely the &quot;Euclidean distance&quot;) between two points of a Euclidean space is the norm of the translation vector that maps one point to the other; that is

formula_43

The &quot;length&quot; of a segment is the distance between its endpoints &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Q&quot;. It is often denoted formula_44.

The distance is a metric, as it is positive definite, symmetric, and satisfies the triangle inequality

formula_45

Moreover, the equality is true if and only if a point belongs to the segment . This inequality means that the length of any edge of a triangle is smaller than the sum of the lengths of the other edges. This is the origin of the term &quot;triangle inequality&quot;.

With the Euclidean distance, every Euclidean space is a complete metric space.

===Orthogonality===

Two nonzero vectors and of formula_11 (the associated vector space of a Euclidean space ) are &quot;perpendicular&quot; or &quot;orthogonal&quot; if their inner product is zero:

formula_47

Two linear subspaces of formula_11 are orthogonal if every nonzero vector of the first one is perpendicular to every nonzero vector of the second one. This implies that the intersection of the linear subspaces is reduced to the zero vector.

Two lines, and more generally two Euclidean subspaces (A line can be considered as one Euclidean subspace.) are orthogonal if their directions (the associated vector spaces of the Euclidean subspaces) are orthogonal. Two orthogonal lines that intersect are said &quot;perpendicular&quot;.

Two segments and that share a common endpoint are &quot;perpendicular&quot; or &quot;form a right angle&quot; if the vectors formula_49 and formula_50 are orthogonal.

If and form a right angle, one has

formula_51

This is the Pythagorean theorem. Its proof is easy in this context, as, expressing this in terms of the inner product, one has, using bilinearity and symmetry of the inner product:

formula_52

Here, formula_53 is used since these two vectors are orthogonal.

=== Angle ===
The (non-oriented) &quot;angle&quot; between two nonzero vectors and in formula_11 is

formula_55

where is the principal value of the arccosine function. By Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, the argument of the arccosine is in the interval . Therefore is real, and (or if angles are measured in degrees).

Angles are not useful in a Euclidean line, as they can be only 0 or .

In an oriented Euclidean plane, one can define the &quot;oriented angle&quot; of two vectors. The oriented angle of two vectors and is then the opposite of the oriented angle of and . In this case, the angle of two vectors can have any value modulo an integer multiple of . In particular, a reflex angle equals the negative angle .

The angle of two vectors does not change if they are multiplied by positive numbers. More precisely, if and are two vectors, and and are real numbers, then

formula_56

If , , and are three points in a Euclidean space, the angle of the segments and is the angle of the vectors formula_57 and formula_58 As the multiplication of vectors by positive numbers do not change the angle, the angle of two half-lines with initial point can be defined: it is the angle of the segments and , where and are arbitrary points, one on each half-line. Although this is less used, one can define similarly the angle of segments or half-lines that do not share an initial point.

The angle of two lines is defined as follows. If is the angle of two segments, one on each line, the angle of any two other segments, one on each line, is either or . One of these angles is in the interval , and the other being in . The &quot;non-oriented angle&quot; of the two lines is the one in the interval . In an oriented Euclidean plane, the &quot;oriented angle&quot; of two lines belongs to the interval .

===Cartesian coordinates===
Every Euclidean vector space has an orthonormal basis (in fact, infinitely many in dimension higher than one, and two in dimension one), that is a basis formula_59 of unit vectors (formula_60) that are pairwise orthogonal (formula_61 for ). More precisely, given any basis formula_62 the Gram–Schmidt process computes an orthonormal basis such that, for every , the linear spans of formula_63 and formula_64 are equal.

Given a Euclidean space , a &quot;Cartesian frame&quot; is a set of data consisting of an orthonormal basis of formula_25 and a point of , called the &quot;origin&quot; and often denoted . A Cartesian frame formula_66 allows defining Cartesian coordinates for both and formula_11 in the following way.

The Cartesian coordinates of a vector of formula_11 are the coefficients of on the orthonormal basis formula_69 For example, the Cartesian coordinates of a vector formula_70 on an orthonormal basis formula_71 (that may be named as formula_72 as a convention) in a 3-dimensional Euclidean space is formula_73 if formula_74. As the basis is orthonormal, the -th coefficient formula_75 is equal to the dot product formula_76

The Cartesian coordinates of a point of are the Cartesian coordinates of the vector formula_77

=== Other coordinates ===

As a Euclidean space is an affine space, one can consider an affine frame on it, which is the same as a Euclidean frame, except that the basis is not required to be orthonormal. This define affine coordinates, sometimes called &quot;skew coordinates&quot; for emphasizing that the basis vectors are not pairwise orthogonal.

An affine basis of a Euclidean space of dimension is a set of points that are not contained in a hyperplane. An affine basis define barycentric coordinates for every point.

Many other coordinates systems can be defined on a Euclidean space of dimension , in the following way. Let be a homeomorphism (or, more often, a diffeomorphism) from a dense open subset of to an open subset of formula_6 The &quot;coordinates&quot; of a point of are the components of . The polar coordinate system (dimension 2) and the spherical and cylindrical coordinate systems (dimension 3) are defined this way.

For points that are outside the domain of , coordinates may sometimes be defined as the limit of coordinates of neighbour points, but these coordinates may be not uniquely defined, and may be not continuous in the neighborhood of the point. For example, for the spherical coordinate system, the longitude is not defined at the pole, and on the antimeridian, the longitude passes discontinuously from –180° to +180°.

This way of defining coordinates extends easily to other mathematical structures, and in particular to manifolds.

== Isometries ==
An isometry between two metric spaces is a bijection preserving the distance, that is

formula_79

In the case of a Euclidean vector space, an isometry that maps the origin to the origin preserves the norm

formula_80

since the norm of a vector is its distance from the zero vector. It preserves also the inner product

formula_81

since

formula_82

An isometry of Euclidean vector spaces is a linear isomorphism.

An isometry formula_83 of Euclidean spaces defines an isometry formula_84 of the associated Euclidean vector spaces. This implies that two isometric Euclidean spaces have the same dimension. Conversely, if and are Euclidean spaces, , , and formula_85 is an isometry, then the map formula_83 defined by

formula_87

is an isometry of Euclidean spaces.

It follows from the preceding results that an isometry of Euclidean spaces maps lines to lines, and, more generally Euclidean subspaces to Euclidean subspaces of the same dimension, and that the restriction of the isometry on these subspaces are isometries of these subspaces.

===Isometry with prototypical examples===
If is a Euclidean space, its associated vector space formula_11 can be considered as a Euclidean space. Every point defines an isometry of Euclidean spaces

formula_89

which maps to the zero vector and has the identity as associated linear map. The inverse isometry is the map

formula_90

A Euclidean frame allows defining the map

formula_91

which is an isometry of Euclidean spaces. The inverse isometry is

formula_92

&quot;This means that, up to an isomorphism, there is exactly one Euclidean space of a given dimension.&quot;

This justifies that many authors talk of formula_3 as &quot;the&quot; Euclidean space of dimension .

=== Euclidean group ===

An isometry from a Euclidean space onto itself is called &quot;Euclidean isometry&quot;, &quot;Euclidean transformation&quot; or &quot;rigid transformation&quot;. The rigid transformations of a Euclidean space form a group (under composition), called the &quot;Euclidean group&quot; and often denoted of .

The simplest Euclidean transformations are translations

formula_94

They are in bijective correspondence with vectors. This is a reason for calling &quot;space of translations&quot; the vector space associated to a Euclidean space. The translations form a normal subgroup of the Euclidean group.

A Euclidean isometry of a Euclidean space defines a linear isometry formula_95 of the associated vector space (by &quot;linear isometry&quot;, it is meant an isometry that is also a linear map) in the following way: denoting by the vector formula_96 if is an arbitrary point of , one has

formula_97

It is straightforward to prove that this is a linear map that does not depend from the choice of 

The map formula_98 is a group homomorphism from the Euclidean group onto the group of linear isometries, called the orthogonal group. The kernel of this homomorphism is the translation group, showing that it is a normal subgroup of the Euclidean group.

The isometries that fix a given point form the stabilizer subgroup of the Euclidean group with respect to . The restriction to this stabilizer of above group homomorphism is an isomorphism. So the isometries that fix a given point form a group isomorphic to the orthogonal group.

Let be a point, an isometry, and the translation that maps to . The isometry formula_99 fixes . So formula_100 and &quot;the Euclidean group is the semidirect product of the translation group and the orthogonal group.&quot;

The special orthogonal group is the normal subgroup of the orthogonal group that preserves handedness. It is a subgroup of index two of the orthogonal group. Its inverse image by the group homomorphism formula_98 is a normal subgroup of index two of the Euclidean group, which is called the &quot;special Euclidean group&quot; or the &quot;displacement group&quot;. Its elements are called &quot;rigid motions&quot; or &quot;displacements&quot;.

Rigid motions include the identity, translations, rotations (the rigid motions that fix at least a point), and also screw motions.

Typical examples of rigid transformations that are not rigid motions are reflections, which are rigid transformations that fix a hyperplane and are not the identity. They are also the transformations consisting in changing the sign of one coordinate over some Euclidean frame.

As the special Euclidean group is a subgroup of index two of the Euclidean group, given a reflection , every rigid transformation that is not a rigid motion is the product of and a rigid motion. A glide reflection is an example of a rigid transformation that is not a rigid motion or a reflection.

All groups that have been considered in this section are Lie groups and algebraic groups.

==Topology==
The Euclidean distance makes a Euclidean space a metric space, and thus a topological space. This topology is called the Euclidean topology. In the case of formula_102 this topology is also the product topology.

The open sets are the subsets that contains an open ball around each of their points. In other words, open balls form a base of the topology.

The topological dimension of a Euclidean space equals its dimension. This implies that Euclidean spaces of different dimensions are not homeomorphic. Moreover, the theorem of invariance of domain asserts that a subset of a Euclidean space is open (for the subspace topology) if and only if it is homeomorphic to an open subset of a Euclidean space of the same dimension.

Euclidean spaces are complete and locally compact. That is, a closed subset of a Euclidean space is compact if it is bounded (that is, contained in a ball). In particular, closed balls are compact.

==Axiomatic definitions==
The definition of Euclidean spaces that has been described in this article differs fundamentally of Euclid&#x27;s one. In reality, Euclid did not define formally the space, because it was thought as a description of the physical world that exists independently of human mind. The need of a formal definition appeared only at the end of 19th century, with the introduction of non-Euclidean geometries.

Two different approaches have been used. Felix Klein suggested to define geometries through their symmetries. The presentation of Euclidean spaces given in this article, is essentially issued from his Erlangen program, with the emphasis given on the groups of translations and isometries.

On the other hand, David Hilbert proposed a set of axioms, inspired by Euclid&#x27;s postulates. They belong to synthetic geometry, as they do not involve any definition of real numbers. Later G. D. Birkhoff and Alfred Tarski proposed simpler sets of axioms, which use real numbers (see Birkhoff&#x27;s axioms and Tarski&#x27;s axioms).

In &quot;Geometric Algebra&quot;, Emil Artin has proved that all these definitions of a Euclidean space are equivalent. It is rather easy to prove that all definitions of Euclidean spaces satisfy Hilbert&#x27;s axioms, and that those involving real numbers (including the above given definition) are equivalent. The difficult part of Artin&#x27;s proof is the following. In Hilbert&#x27;s axioms, congruence is an equivalence relation on segments. One can thus define the &quot;length&quot; of a segment as its equivalence class. One must thus prove that this length satisfies properties that characterize nonnegative real numbers. Artin proved this with axioms equivalent to those of Hilbert.

==Usage==
Since the ancient Greeks, Euclidean space has been used for modeling shapes in the physical world. It is thus used in many sciences, such as physics, mechanics, and astronomy. It is also widely used in all technical areas that are concerned with shapes, figure, location and position, such as architecture, geodesy, topography, navigation, industrial design, or technical drawing.

Space of dimensions higher than three occurs in several modern theories of physics; see Higher dimension. They occur also in configuration spaces of physical systems.

Beside Euclidean geometry, Euclidean spaces are also widely used in other areas of mathematics. Tangent spaces of differentiable manifolds are Euclidean vector spaces. More generally, a manifold is a space that is locally approximated by Euclidean spaces. Most non-Euclidean geometries can be modeled by a manifold, and embedded in a Euclidean space of higher dimension. For example, an elliptic space can be modeled by an ellipsoid. It is common to represent in a Euclidean space mathematical objects that are &quot;a priori&quot; not of a geometrical nature. An example among many is the usual representation of graphs.

==Other geometric spaces==
Since the introduction, at the end of 19th century, of non-Euclidean geometries, many sorts of spaces have been considered, about which one can do geometric reasoning in the same way as with Euclidean spaces. In general, they share some properties with Euclidean spaces, but may also have properties that could appear as rather strange. Some of these spaces use Euclidean geometry for their definition, or can be modeled as subspaces of a Euclidean space of higher dimension. When such a space is defined by geometrical axioms, embedding the space in a Euclidean space is a standard way for proving consistency of its definition, or, more precisely for proving that its theory is consistent, if Euclidean geometry is consistent (which cannot be proved).

===Affine space===

A Euclidean space is an affine space equipped with a metric. Affine spaces have many other uses in mathematics. In particular, as they are defined over any field, they allow doing geometry in other contexts.

As soon as non-linear questions are considered, it is generally useful to consider affine spaces over the complex numbers as an extension of Euclidean spaces. For example, a circle and a line have always two intersection points (possibly not distinct) in the complex affine space. Therefore, most of algebraic geometry is built in complex affine spaces and affine spaces over algebraically closed fields. The shapes that are studied in algebraic geometry in these affine spaces are therefore called affine algebraic varieties.

Affine spaces over the rational numbers and more generally over algebraic number fields provide a link between (algebraic) geometry and number theory. For example, the Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem can be stated &quot;a Fermat curve of degree higher than two has no point in the affine plane over the rationals.&quot;

Geometry in affine spaces over a finite fields has also been widely studied. For example, elliptic curves over finite fields are widely used in cryptography.

===Projective space===

Originally, projective spaces have been introduced by adding &quot;points at infinity&quot; to Euclidean spaces, and, more generally to affine spaces, in order to make true the assertion &quot;two coplanar lines meet in exactly one point&quot;. Projective space share with Euclidean and affine spaces the property of being isotropic, that is, there is no property of the space that allows distinguishing between two points or two lines. Therefore, a more isotropic definition is commonly used, which consists as defining a projective space as the set of the vector lines in a vector space of dimension one more.

As for affine spaces, projective spaces are defined over any field, and are fundamental spaces of algebraic geometry.

===Non-Euclidean geometries===

&quot;Non-Euclidean geometry&quot; refers usually to geometrical spaces where the parallel postulate is false. They include elliptic geometry, where the sum of the angles of a triangle is more than 180°, and hyperbolic geometry, where this sum is less than 180°. Their introduction in the second half of 19th century, and the proof that their theory is consistent (if Euclidean geometry is not contradictory) is one of the paradoxes that are at the origin of the foundational crisis in mathematics of the beginning of 20th century, and motivated the systematization of axiomatic theories in mathematics.

=== Curved spaces ===

A manifold is a space that in the neighborhood of each point resembles a Euclidean space. In technical terms, a manifold is a topological space, such that each point has a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to an open subset of a Euclidean space. Manifolds can be classified by increasing degree of this &quot;resemblance&quot; into topological manifolds, differentiable manifolds, smooth manifolds, and analytic manifolds. However, none of these types of &quot;resemblance&quot; respect distances and angles, even approximately.

Distances and angles can be defined on a smooth manifold by providing a smoothly varying Euclidean metric on the tangent spaces at the points of the manifold (these tangent spaces are thus Euclidean vector spaces). This results in a Riemannian manifold. Generally, straight lines do not exist in a Riemannian manifold, but their role is played by geodesics, which are the &quot;shortest paths&quot; between two points. This allows defining distances, which are measured along geodesics, and angles between geodesics, which are the angle of their tangents in the tangent space at their intersection. So, Riemannian manifolds behave locally like a Euclidean space that has been bent.

Euclidean spaces are trivially Riemannian manifolds. An example illustrating this well is the surface of a sphere. In this case, geodesics are arcs of great circle, which are called orthodromes in the context of navigation. More generally, the spaces of non-Euclidean geometries can be realized as Riemannian manifolds.

=== Pseudo-Euclidean space ===
An inner product of a real vector space is a positive definite bilinear form, and so characterized by a positive definite quadratic form. A pseudo-Euclidean space is an affine space with an associated real vector space equipped with a non-degenerate quadratic form (that may be indefinite).

A fundamental example of such a space is the Minkowski space, which is the space-time of Einstein&#x27;s special relativity. It is a four-dimensional space, where the metric is defined by the quadratic form

formula_103

where the last coordinate (&quot;t&quot;) is temporal, and the other three (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;) are spatial.

To take gravity into account, general relativity uses a pseudo-Riemannian manifold that has Minkowski spaces as tangent spaces. The curvature of this manifold at a point is a function of the value of the gravitational field at this point.

<text>Edwin Austin Abbey (April 1, 1852August 1, 1911) was an American muralist, illustrator, and painter. He flourished at the beginning of what is now referred to as the &quot;golden age&quot; of illustration, and is best known for his drawings and paintings of Shakespearean and Victorian subjects, as well as for his painting of Edward VII&#x27;s coronation. His most famous set of murals, &quot;The Quest and Achievement of the Holy Grail&quot;, adorns the Boston Public Library.

==Early life and education==

Abbey was born in Philadelphia, on April 1, 1852, to commercial broker William Maxwell Abbey and Margery Ann Kiple. He studied art at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia under Christian Schussele.

==Career==

Abbey began as an illustrator, producing numerous illustrations and sketches magazines, including &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; (1871–1874) and &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. His illustrations began appearing in Harper&#x27;s Weekly before Abbey was twenty years old. He moved to New York City in 1871. His illustrations were strongly influenced by French and German black and white art: Adolf Menzel and Daniel Vierge; and by English artists. He illustrated several best-selling books, including &quot;Christmas Stories&quot; by Charles Dickens (1875), &quot;Selections from the Poetry of Robert Herrick&quot; (1882), and &quot;She Stoops to Conquer&quot; by Oliver Goldsmith (1887). Abbey also illustrated a four-volume set of &quot;The Comedies of Shakespeare&quot; for Harper &amp; Brothers in 1896.

In 1878, he moved to England at the request of his employers to gather material for illustrations of the poems of Robert Herrick, published in 1882, and he settled permanently there in 1883.

In 1883, he was elected to the Royal Institute of Painters in Water-Colours. About this time, he was appraised critically by the American writer, S.G.W. Benjamin:

He also created illustrations for Goldsmith&#x27;s &quot;She Stoops to Conquer&quot; (1887), for a volume of &quot;Old Songs&quot; (1889), and for the comedies (and a few of the tragedies) of Shakespeare. Among his water-colours are &quot;The Evil Eye&quot; (1877), &quot;The Rose in October&quot; (1879), &quot;An Old Song&quot; (1886), &quot;The Visitors&quot; (1890), and &quot;The Jongleur&quot; (1892). Possibly his best known pastels are &quot;Beatrice&quot;, &quot;Phyllis&quot;, and &quot;Two Noble Kinsmen&quot;.

In 1890, he made his first appearance with an oil painting, &quot;A May Day Morn&quot;, at the Royal Academy in London. He exhibited &quot;Richard duke of Gloucester and the Lady Anne&quot; there in 1896, and in that year was elected A.R.A., becoming a full member in 1898. He received a gold medal at the Pan-American Exposition and was commissioned to paint the coronation of King Edward VII. in 1901; in the next year, he was chosen to paint the coronation. It was the official painting of the occasion and, hence, resides at Buckingham Palace. He did receive a knighthood, although some say he refused it in 1907. Friendly with other expatriate American artists, he summered at Broadway, Worcestershire, England, where he painted and vacationed alongside John Singer Sargent at the home of Francis Davis Millet.

He completed murals for the Boston Public Library in the 1890s. The frieze for the Library was titled &quot;The Quest and Achievement of the Holy Grail&quot;. It took Abbey eleven years to complete this series of murals in his England studio. In 1897 he received the honorary degree of A.M. from Yale university. In 2024, Yale University Art Gallery completed restoration of his &quot;Study for the Apotheosis of Pennsylvania&quot; using a technique known as &quot;mist lining&quot; which repaired structural defects in the canvas.

In 1904 he painted a mural for the Royal Exchange, London &quot;Reconciliation of the Skinners &amp; Merchant Taylors&#x27; Companies by Lord Mayor Billesden, 1484&quot;.

===Pennsylvania State Capitol===

In 1908–09, Abbey began an ambitious program of murals and other artworks for the newly completed Pennsylvania State Capitol in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. These included allegorical medallion murals representing &quot;Science&quot;, &quot;Art&quot;, &quot;Justice&quot;, and &quot;Religion&quot; for the dome of the Rotunda, four large lunette murals beneath the dome, and multiple works for the House and Senate Chambers. For the Senate chamber he finished only one painting, &quot;Von Steuben Training the American Soldiers at Valley Forge&quot;, and he was working on the &quot;Reading of the Declaration of Independence&quot; mural in early 1911, when his health began to fail. He was diagnosed with cancer. Studio assistant William Simmonds continued work on the mural with little supervision from Abbey, and with small contributions by John Singer Sargent.

==Death==
On August 11, 1911, Abbey died in London. William Simmonds travelled from England to install the completed murals with Abbey&#x27;s widow Gertrude. The remaining two rooms, which Abbey had been unable to finish, were given to Violet Oakley, who completed the commission using her own designs.

==Legacy==
Abbey was elected to the National Academy of Design, in 1902, and The American Academy of Arts and Letters. He was honorary member of the Royal Bavarian Society and the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts, and was made a chevalier of the French Legion of Honour. He was a prolific illustrator, and attention to detail, including historical accuracy, influenced successive generations of illustrators.

Edwin had been a keen supporter of the newly founded British School at Rome (BSR), so, in his memory, his widow donated £6000 to assist in building the artists&#x27; studio block and, in 1926, founded the Incorporated Edwin Austin Abbey Memorial Scholarships. The scholarships were established to enable British and American painters to pursue their practice. Recipients of Abbey funding – Scholars and, more recently, Fellows – devote their scholarship to working in the studios at the BSR, where there has, ever since, been at least one Abbey-funded artist in residence. Previous award holders include Stephen Farthing, Chantal Joffe and Spartacus Chetwynd. The Abbey Fellowships (formerly &#x27;Awards&#x27;) were established in their present form in 1990, and the Abbey studios also host the BSR&#x27;s other Fine Art residencies, such as the Derek Hill Foundation Scholarship and the Sainsbury Scholarship in Painting and Drawing. A bust of Edwin Abbey, by Sir Thomas Brock, stands in the courtyard of the BSR.

Edwin also left works to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and to the National Gallery in London.

Abbey is buried in the churchyard of Old St Andrew&#x27;s Church in Kingsbury, London. His grave is Grade II listed.
==Family==
In 1890, Edwin married (Mary) Gertrude Mead, the daughter of Frederick Mead, a New York merchant. She encouraged her husband to secure more ambitious commissions. The marriage remained childless.

After her husband&#x27;s death, Gertrude was active in preserving her husband&#x27;s legacy, writing about his work and giving her substantial collection and archive to Yale. In 1932, through the Edwin Austin Abbey Memorial Fund for Mural Painting, she endowed the Abbey Mural Prize to support the creation and restoration of public murals in the United States. It is awarded each year by a jury of National Academicians through the National Academy of Design. She was a sponsor of the Survey of London.
