<text>Microsoft DirectX is a collection of application programming interfaces (APIs) for handling tasks related to multimedia, especially game programming and video, on Microsoft platforms. Originally, the names of these APIs all began with &quot;Direct&quot;, such as Direct3D, DirectDraw, DirectMusic, DirectPlay, DirectSound, and so forth. The name &quot;DirectX&quot; was coined as a shorthand term for all of these APIs (the &quot;X&quot; standing in for the particular API names) and soon became the name of the collection. When Microsoft later set out to develop a gaming console, the &quot;X&quot; was used as the basis of the name Xbox to indicate that the console was based on DirectX technology. The &quot;X&quot; initial has been carried forward in the naming of APIs designed for the Xbox such as XInput and the Cross-platform Audio Creation Tool (XACT), while the DirectX pattern has been continued for Windows APIs such as Direct2D and DirectWrite.

Direct3D (the 3D graphics API within DirectX) is widely used in the development of video games for Microsoft Windows and the Xbox line of consoles. Direct3D is also used by other software applications for visualization and graphics tasks such as CAD/CAM engineering. As Direct3D is the most widely publicized component of DirectX, it is common to see the names &quot;DirectX&quot; and &quot;Direct3D&quot; used interchangeably.

The DirectX software development kit (SDK) consists of runtime libraries in redistributable binary form, along with accompanying documentation and headers for use in coding. Originally, the runtimes were only installed by games or explicitly by the user. Windows 95 did not launch with DirectX, but DirectX was included with Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2. Windows 98 and Windows NT 4.0 both shipped with DirectX, as has every version of Windows released since. The SDK is available as a free download. While the runtimes are proprietary, closed-source software, source code is provided for most of the SDK samples. Starting with the release of Windows 8 Developer Preview, DirectX SDK has been integrated into Windows SDK.

==Development history==
In late 1994, Microsoft was ready to release Windows 95, its next operating system. An important factor in its value to consumers was the programs that would be able to run on it. Microsoft employee Alex St. John had been in discussions with various game developers asking how likely they would be to bring their MS-DOS games to Windows 95, and found the responses mostly negative, since programmers had found that the Windows environment did not provide the necessary features which were available under MS-DOS using BIOS routines or direct hardware access. There were also strong fears of compatibility; a notable case of this was from &quot;Disney&#x27;s Animated Storybook: The Lion King&quot; which was based on the WinG programming interface. Due to numerous incompatible graphics drivers from new Compaq computers that were not tested with the WinG interface which came bundled with the game, it crashed so frequently on many desktop systems that parents had flooded Disney&#x27;s call-in help lines.

St. John recognized the resistances for game development under Windows would be a limitation, and recruited two additional engineers, Craig Eisler and Eric Engstrom, to develop a better solution to get more programmers to develop games for Windows. The project was codenamed the Manhattan Project, like the World War II project of the same name, and the idea was to displace the Japanese-developed video game consoles with personal computers running Microsoft&#x27;s operating system. It had initially used the radiation symbol as its logo but Microsoft asked the team to change the logo. Management did not agree to the project as they were already writing off Windows as a gaming platform, but the three committed towards this project&#x27;s development. Their rebellious nature led Brad Silverberg, the senior vice president of Microsoft&#x27;s office products, to name the trio the &quot;Beastie Boys&quot;.

Most of the work by the three was done among other assigned projects starting near the end of 1994. Within four months and with input from several hardware manufacturers, the team had developed the first set of application programming interfaces (APIs) which they presented at the 1995 Game Developers Conference. The SDK included libraries implementing DirectDraw for bit-mapped graphics, DirectSound for audio, and DirectPlay for communication between players over a network. Furthermore, an extended joystick API already present in Windows 95 was documented for the first time as DirectInput, while a description of how to implement the immediate start of the installation procedure of a software title after inserting its CD-ROM, a feature called AutoPlay, was also part of the SDK. The &quot;Direct&quot; part of the library was so named as these routines bypassed existing core Windows 95 routines and accessed the computer hardware only via a hardware abstraction layer (HAL). Though the team had named it the &quot;Game SDK&quot; (software development kit), the name &quot;DirectX&quot; came from one journalist that had mocked the naming scheme of the various libraries. The team opted to continue to use that naming scheme and call the project DirectX.

The first version of DirectX was released in September 1995 as the Windows Game SDK. Its DirectDraw component was the Win32 replacement for the DCI and WinG APIs for Windows 3.1. DirectX allowed all versions of Microsoft Windows, starting with Windows 95, to incorporate high-performance multimedia. Eisler wrote about the frenzy to build DirectX 1 through 5 in his blog.

To get more developers on board DirectX, Microsoft approached id Software&#x27;s John Carmack and offered to port &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;Doom 2&quot; from MS-DOS to DirectX, free of charge, with id retaining all publishing rights to the game. Carmack agreed, and Microsoft&#x27;s Gabe Newell led the porting project. The first game was released as &quot;Doom 95&quot; in August 1996, the first published DirectX game. Microsoft promoted the game heavily with Bill Gates appearing in ads for the title.

DirectX 2.0 became a built-in component of Windows with the releases of Windows 95 OSR2 and Windows NT 4.0 in mid-1996. Since Windows 95 itself was still new and few games had been released for it, Microsoft engaged in heavy promotion of DirectX to developers who were generally distrustful of Microsoft&#x27;s ability to build a gaming platform in Windows. Alex St. John, the evangelist for DirectX, staged an elaborate event at the 1996 Computer Game Developers Conference which game developer Jay Barnson described as a Roman theme, including real lions, togas, and something resembling an indoor carnival. It was at this event that Microsoft first introduced Direct3D, and demonstrated multiplayer &quot;MechWarrior 2&quot; being played over the Internet.

The DirectX team faced the challenging task of testing each DirectX release against an array of computer hardware and software. A variety of different graphics cards, audio cards, motherboards, CPUs, input devices, games, and other multimedia applications were tested with each beta and final release. The DirectX team also built and distributed tests that allowed the hardware industry to confirm that new hardware designs and driver releases would be compatible with DirectX.

Prior to DirectX Microsoft had added OpenGL to their Windows NT platform. OpenGL had been designed as a cross-platform, window system independent software interface to graphics hardware by Silicon Graphics, Inc. to bring 3D graphics programming into the mainstream of application programming. Besides it could also be used for 2D graphics and imaging and was controlled by the Architectural Review Board (ARB) which included Microsoft. Direct3D was intended to be a Microsoft controlled alternative to OpenGL, focused initially on game use. As 3D gaming grew game developers were discovering that OpenGL could be used effectively for game development. At that point a &quot;battle&quot; began between supporters of the cross-platform OpenGL and the Windows-only Direct3D. Incidentally, OpenGL was supported at Microsoft by the DirectX team. If a developer chose to use the OpenGL 3D graphics API in computer games, the other APIs of DirectX besides Direct3D were often combined with OpenGL because OpenGL does not include all of DirectX&#x27;s functionality (such as sound or joystick support).

In a console-specific version, DirectX was used as a basis for Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox, Xbox 360 and Xbox One console API. The API was developed jointly between Microsoft and Nvidia, which developed the custom graphics hardware used by the original Xbox. The Xbox API was similar to DirectX version 8.1, but is non-updateable like other console technologies. The Xbox was code named DirectXbox, but this was shortened to Xbox for its commercial name.

In 2002, Microsoft released DirectX 9 with support for the use of much longer shader programs than before with pixel and vertex shader version 2.0. Microsoft has continued to update the DirectX suite since then, introducing Shader Model 3.0 in DirectX 9.0c, released in August 2004.

As of April 2005, DirectShow was removed from DirectX and moved to the Microsoft Platform SDK instead.

DirectX has been confirmed to be present in Microsoft&#x27;s Windows Phone 8.

Real-time raytracing was announced as DXR in 2018. Support for compiling HLSL to SPIR-V was also added in the DirectX Shader Compiler the same year.

==Components==
DirectX is composed of multiple APIs:

* Direct3D (D3D): Real-time 3D rendering API
* DXGI: Enumerates adapters and monitors and manages swap chains for Direct3D 10 and later.
* Direct2D: 2D graphics API
* DirectWrite: Text rendering API
* DirectCompute: API for general-purpose computing on graphics processing units
* DirectX Diagnostics (DxDiag): A tool for diagnosing and generating reports on components related to DirectX, such as audio, video, and input drivers
* XACT3: High-level audio API
* XAudio2: Low-level audio API
* DirectX Raytracing (DXR): Real-time raytracing API
* DirectStorage: GPU-oriented file I/O API
* DirectML: GPU-accelerated machine learning and artificial intelligence API
* DirectSR: GPU-accelerated resolution upscaling API
* Media Foundation

Microsoft has deprecated the following components:
* DirectX Media: Consists of:
** DirectAnimation for 2D/3D web animation, DirectShow for multimedia playback and streaming media
** DirectX Media Objects: Support for streaming objects such as encoders, decoders, and effects (Deprecated in favor of Media Foundation Transforms; MFTs)
** DirectX Transform for web interactivity, and Direct3D Retained Mode for higher level 3D graphics
** DirectX plugins for audio signal processing
* DirectDraw: 2D graphics API (Deprecated in favor of Direct2D)
* DirectInput: Input API for interfacing with keyboards, mice, joysticks, and game controllers (Deprecated after version 8 in favor of XInput for Xbox 360 controllers or standard WM_INPUT window message processing for keyboard and mouse input)

DirectX functionality is provided in the form of COM-style objects and interfaces. Additionally, while not DirectX components themselves, managed objects have been built on top of some parts of DirectX, such as Managed Direct3D and the XNA graphics library on top of Direct3D 9.

Microsoft distributes debugging tool for DirectX called &quot;PIX&quot;.

==Versions==

===DirectX 9===
Introduced by Microsoft in 2002, DirectX 9 was a significant release in the DirectX family. It brought many important features and enhancements to the graphics capabilities of Windows. At the time of its release, it supported Windows 98, Windows Me, Windows 2000, and Windows XP. As of August 2024 it remains supported by all subsequent versions of Windows for backward compatibility.

One of the key features introduced in DirectX 9 was Shader Model 2.0, which included Pixel Shader 2.0 and Vertex Shader 2.0. These allowed for more complex and realistic graphics rendering. It also brought much needed performance improvements through better hardware acceleration capabilities, and better utilization of GPU resources. It also introduced HLSL, which provided a more accessible way for developers to produce shaders.

DirectX 9.0c was an update to the original, and has been continuously changed over the years affecting its compatibility with older operating systems. As of January 2007, Windows 2000 and Windows XP became the minimum required operating systems. This means support was officially dropped for Windows 98 and Windows Me. As of August 2024, DirectX 9.0c is still regularly updated.

Windows XP SP2 and newer include DirectX 9.0c, but may require a newer DirectX runtime redistributable installation for DirectX 9.0c applications compiled with the February 2005 DirectX 9.0 SDK or newer.

DirectX 9 had a significant impact on game development. Many games from the mid-2000s to early 2010s were developed using DirectX 9 and it became a standard target for developers. Even today, some games still use DirectX 9 as an option for older or less powerful hardware.

===DirectX 10===
A major update to DirectX API, DirectX 10 ships with and is only available with Windows Vista (launched in late 2006) and later. Previous versions of Windows such as Windows XP are not able to run DirectX 10-exclusive applications. Rather, programs that are run on a Windows XP system with DirectX 10 hardware simply resort to the DirectX 9.0c code path, the latest available for Windows XP computers.

Changes for DirectX 10 were extensive. Many former parts of DirectX API were deprecated in the latest DirectX SDK and are preserved for compatibility only: DirectInput was deprecated in favor of XInput, DirectSound was deprecated in favor of the Cross-platform Audio Creation Tool system (XACT) and additionally lost support for hardware accelerated audio, since the Vista audio stack renders sound in software on the CPU. The DirectPlay DPLAY.DLL was also removed and was replaced with dplayx.dll; games that rely on this DLL must duplicate it and rename it to dplay.dll.

In order to achieve backwards compatibility, DirectX in Windows Vista contains several versions of Direct3D:
* Direct3D 9: emulates Direct3D 9 behavior as it was on Windows XP. Details and advantages of Vista&#x27;s Windows Display Driver Model are hidden from the application if WDDM drivers are installed. This is the only API available if there are only XP graphic drivers (XDDM) installed, after an upgrade to Vista for example.
* Direct3D 9Ex (known internally during Windows Vista development as 9.0L or 9.L): allows full access to the new capabilities of WDDM (if WDDM drivers are installed) while maintaining compatibility for existing Direct3D applications. The Windows Aero user interface relies on D3D 9Ex.
* Direct3D 10: Designed around the new driver model in Windows Vista and featuring a number of improvements to rendering capabilities and flexibility, including Shader Model 4.
Direct3D 10.1 is an incremental update of Direct3D 10.0 which shipped with, and required, Windows Vista Service Pack 1, which was released in February 2008. This release mainly sets a few more image quality standards for graphics vendors, while giving developers more control over image quality. It also adds support for cube map arrays, separate blend modes per-MRT, coverage mask export from a pixel shader, ability to run pixel shader per sample, access to multi-sampled depth buffers and requires that the video card supports Shader Model 4.1 or higher and 32-bit floating-point operations. Direct3D 10.1 still fully supports Direct3D 10 hardware, but in order to utilize all of the new features, updated hardware is required.

===DirectX 11===
Microsoft unveiled DirectX 11 at the Gamefest 08 event in Seattle. The Final Platform Update launched for Windows Vista on October 27, 2009, which was a week after the initial release of Windows 7, which launched with Direct3D 11 as a base standard.

Major scheduled features including GPGPU support (DirectCompute), and Direct3D 11 with tessellation support and improved multi-threading support to assist video game developers in developing games that better utilize multi-core processors. Parts of the new API such as multi-threaded resource handling can be supported on Direct3D 9/10/10.1-class hardware. Hardware tessellation and Shader Model 5.0 require Direct3D 11 supporting hardware. Microsoft has since released the Direct3D 11 Technical Preview. Direct3D 11 is a strict superset of Direct3D 10.1 — all hardware and API features of version 10.1 are retained, and new features are added only when necessary for exposing new functionality. This helps to keep backwards compatibility with previous versions of DirectX.

Four updates for DirectX 11 were released:
* DirectX 11.1 is included in Windows 8. It supports WDDM 1.2 for increased performance, features improved integration of Direct2D (now at version 1.1), Direct3D, and DirectCompute, and includes DirectXMath, XAudio2, and XInput libraries from the XNA framework. It also features stereoscopic 3D support for gaming and video. DirectX 11.1 was also partially backported to Windows 7, via the Windows 7 platform update.
* DirectX 11.2 is included in Windows 8.1 (including the RT version) and Windows Server 2012 R2. It added some new features to Direct2D like geometry realizations. It also added swap chain composition, which allows some elements of the scene to be rendered at lower resolutions and then composited via hardware overlay with other parts rendered at higher resolution.
* DirectX 11.X is a superset of DirectX 11.2 running on the Xbox One. It actually includes some features, such as draw bundles, that were later announced as part of DirectX 12.
* DirectX 11.3 was announced along with DirectX 12 at GDC and released in 2015. It is meant to complement DirectX 12 as a higher-level alternative. It is included with Windows 10.

===DirectX 12===
DirectX 12 was announced by Microsoft at GDC on March 20, 2014, and was officially launched alongside Windows 10 on July 29, 2015.

The primary feature highlight for the new release of DirectX was the introduction of advanced low-level programming APIs for Direct3D 12 which can reduce driver overhead. Developers are now able to implement their own command lists and buffers to the GPU, allowing for more efficient resource utilization through parallel computation. Lead developer Max McMullen stated that the main goal of Direct3D 12 is to achieve &quot;console-level efficiency on phone, tablet and PC&quot;. The release of Direct3D 12 comes alongside other initiatives for low-overhead graphics APIs including AMD&#x27;s Mantle for AMD graphics cards, Apple&#x27;s Metal for iOS and macOS and Khronos Group&#x27;s cross-platform Vulkan.

Multiadapter support will feature in DirectX 12 allowing developers to utilize multiple GPUs on a system simultaneously; multi-GPU support was previously dependent on vendor implementations such as AMD CrossFireX or NVIDIA SLI.
*&quot;Implicit Multiadapter&quot; support will work in a similar manner to previous versions of DirectX where frames are rendered alternately across linked GPUs of similar compute-power.
*&quot;Explicit Multiadapter&quot; will provide two distinct API patterns to developers. &quot;Linked GPUs&quot; will allow DirectX to view graphics cards in SLI or CrossFireX as a single GPU and use the combined resources; whereas &quot;Unlinked GPUs&quot; will allow GPUs from different vendors to be utilized by DirectX, such as supplementing the dedicated GPU with the integrated GPU on the CPU, or combining AMD and NVIDIA cards. However, elaborate mixed multi-GPU setups requires significantly more attentive developer support.

DirectX 12 is supported on all Fermi and later Nvidia GPUs, on AMD&#x27;s GCN-based chips and on Intel&#x27;s Haswell and later processors&#x27; graphics units.

At SIGGRAPH 2014, Intel released a demo showing a computer generated asteroid field, in which DirectX 12 was claimed to be 50–70% more efficient than DirectX 11 in rendering speed and CPU power consumption.

&quot;Ashes of the Singularity&quot; was the first publicly available game to utilize DirectX 12. Testing by &quot;Ars Technica&quot; in August 2015 revealed slight performance regressions in DirectX 12 over DirectX 11 mode for the Nvidia GeForce 980 Ti, whereas the AMD Radeon R9 290x achieved consistent performance improvements of up to 70% under DirectX 12, and in some scenarios the AMD outperformed the more powerful Nvidia under DirectX 12. The performance discrepancies may be due to poor Nvidia driver optimizations for DirectX 12, or even hardware limitations of the card which was optimized for DirectX 11 serial execution; however, the exact cause remains unclear.

The performance improvements of DirectX 12 on the Xbox are not as substantial as on the PC.

In March 2018, DirectX Raytracing (DXR) was announced, capable of real-time ray-tracing on supported hardware, and the DXR API was added in the Windows 10 October 2018 update.

In 2019 Microsoft announced the arrival of DirectX 12 to Windows 7 but only as a plug-in for certain game titles.

===DirectX 12 Ultimate===
Microsoft revealed DirectX 12 Ultimate in March 2020. DirectX 12 Ultimate will unify to a common library on both Windows 10 computers and the Xbox Series X and other ninth-generation Xbox consoles. Among the new features in Ultimate includes DirectX Raytracing 1.1, Variable Rate Shading, which gives programmers control over the level of detail of shading depending on design choices, Mesh Shaders, and Sampler Feedback.

=== Version history ===
The version number as reported by Microsoft&#x27;s DxDiag tool (version 4.09.0000.0900 and higher) use the x.xx.xxxx.xxxx format for version numbers. However, the DirectX and Windows XP MSDN page claims that the registry always has been in the x.xx.xx.xxxx format. Therefore, when the above table lists a version as &#x27;4.09.00.0904&#x27; Microsoft&#x27;s DxDiag tool may have it as &#x27;4.09.0000.0904&#x27;.

==Compatibility==
Various releases of Windows have included and supported various versions of DirectX, allowing newer versions of the operating system to continue running applications designed for earlier versions of DirectX until those versions can be gradually phased out in favor of newer APIs, drivers, and hardware.

APIs such as Direct3D and DirectSound need to interact with hardware, and they do this through a device driver. Hardware manufacturers have to write these drivers for a particular DirectX version&#x27;s device driver interface (or DDI), and test each individual piece of hardware to make them DirectX compatible. Some hardware devices have only DirectX compatible drivers (in other words, one must install DirectX in order to use that hardware). Early versions of DirectX included an up-to-date library of all of the DirectX compatible drivers currently available. This practice was stopped however, in favor of the web-based Windows Update driver-update system, which allowed users to download only the drivers relevant to their hardware, rather than the entire library.

Prior to DirectX 10, DirectX runtime was designed to be &quot;backward compatible&quot; with older drivers, meaning that newer versions of the APIs were designed to interoperate with older drivers written against a previous version&#x27;s DDI. The application programmer had to query the available hardware capabilities using a complex system of &quot;cap bits&quot; each tied to a particular hardware feature. Direct3D 7 and earlier would work on any version of the DDI, Direct3D 8 requires a minimum DDI level of 6 and Direct3D 9 requires a minimum DDI level of 7.
However, the Direct3D 10 runtime in Windows Vista cannot run on older hardware drivers due to the significantly updated DDI, which requires a unified feature set and abandons the use of &quot;cap bits&quot;.

Direct3D 10.1 introduces &quot;feature levels&quot; 10_0 and 10_1, which allow use of only the hardware features defined in the specified version of Direct3D API. Direct3D 11 adds level 11_0 and &quot;10 Level 9&quot; - a subset of the Direct3D 10 API designed to run on Direct3D 9 hardware, which has three feature levels (9_1, 9_2 and 9_3) grouped by common capabilities of &quot;low&quot;, &quot;med&quot; and &quot;high-end&quot; video cards; the runtime directly uses Direct3D 9 DDI provided in all WDDM drivers. Feature level 11_1 has been introduced with Direct3D 11.1.

===.NET Framework===
In 2002, Microsoft released a version of DirectX compatible with the Microsoft .NET Framework, thus allowing programmers to take advantage of DirectX functionality from within .NET applications using compatible languages such as managed C++ or the use of the C# programming language. This API was known as &quot;Managed DirectX&quot; (or MDX for short), and claimed to operate at 98% of performance of the underlying native DirectX APIs. In December 2005, February 2006, April 2006, and August 2006, Microsoft released successive updates to this library, culminating in a beta version called Managed DirectX 2.0. While Managed DirectX 2.0 consolidated functionality that had previously been scattered over multiple assemblies into a single assembly, thus simplifying dependencies on it for software developers, development on this version has subsequently been discontinued, and it is no longer supported. The Managed DirectX 2.0 library expired on October 5, 2006.

During the GDC 2006, Microsoft presented the XNA Framework, a new managed version of DirectX (similar but not identical to Managed DirectX) that is intended to assist development of games by making it easier to integrate DirectX, HLSL and other tools in one package. It also supports the execution of managed code on the Xbox 360. The XNA Game Studio Express RTM was made available on December 11, 2006, as a free download for Windows XP. Unlike the DirectX runtime, Managed DirectX, XNA Framework or the Xbox 360 APIs (XInput, XACT etc.) have not shipped as part of Windows. Developers are expected to redistribute the runtime components along with their games or applications.

No Microsoft product including the latest XNA releases provides DirectX 10 support for the .NET Framework.

The other approach for DirectX in managed languages is to use third-party libraries like:

* SlimDX, an open source library for DirectX programming on the .NET Framework
* SharpDX, which is an open source project delivering the full DirectX API for .NET on all Windows platforms, allowing the development of high performance game, 2D and 3D graphics rendering as well as real-time sound applications
* DirectShow.NET for the DirectShow subset
* Windows API CodePack for .NET Framework , which is an open source library from Microsoft.

==Alternatives==
There are alternatives to the DirectX family of APIs, with OpenGL, its successor Vulkan, Metal and Mantle having the most features comparable to Direct3D. Examples of other APIs include SDL, Allegro, OpenMAX, OpenML, OpenAL, OpenCL, FMOD, SFML etc. Many of these libraries are cross-platform or have open codebases. There are also alternative implementations that aim to provide the same API, such as the one in Wine. Furthermore, the developers of ReactOS are trying to reimplement DirectX under the name &quot;ReactX&quot;.

<text>Slalom is an alpine skiing and alpine snowboarding discipline, involving skiing between poles or gates. These are spaced more closely than those in giant slalom, super giant slalom and downhill, necessitating quicker and shorter turns. Internationally, the sport is contested at the FIS Alpine World Ski Championships, and at the Olympic Winter Games.

== History ==
The term slalom comes from the Morgedal/Seljord dialect of the Norwegian word &quot;slalåm&quot;: &quot;sla&quot;, meaning &quot;slightly inclining hillside&quot;, and &quot;låm&quot;, meaning &quot;track after skis&quot;. The inventors of modern skiing classified their trails according to their difficulty. &quot;Slalåm&quot; was a trail used in Telemark by boys and girls not yet able to try themselves on the more challenging runs. &quot;Ufsilåm&quot; was a trail with one obstacle (&quot;ufse&quot;) like a jump, a fence, a difficult turn, a gorge, a cliff (often more than high), et cetera. &quot;Uvyrdslåm&quot; was a trail with several obstacles. A Norwegian military downhill competition in 1767 included racing downhill among trees &quot;without falling or breaking skis&quot;. Sondre Norheim and other skiers from Telemark practiced &quot;uvyrdslåm&quot; or &quot;disrespectful/reckless downhill&quot; where they raced downhill in difficult and untested terrain (i.e., off piste). The 1866 &quot;ski race&quot; in Oslo was a combined cross-country, jumping and slalom competition. In the slalom participants were allowed use poles for braking and steering, and they were given points for style (appropriate skier posture). During the late 19th century Norwegian skiers participated in all branches (jumping, slalom, and cross-country) often with the same pair of skis. Slalom and variants of slalom were often referred to as hill races. Around 1900 hill races were abandoned in the Oslo championships at Huseby and Holmenkollen. Mathias Zdarsky&#x27;s development of the Lilienfeld binding helped change hill races into a specialty of the Alps region.

The rules for the modern slalom were developed by Arnold Lunn in 1922 for the British National Ski Championships, and adopted for alpine skiing at the 1936 Winter Olympics. Under these rules gates were marked by pairs of flags rather than single ones, were arranged so that the racers had to use a variety of turn lengths to negotiate them, and scoring was on the basis of time alone, rather than on both time and style.

==Course==

A course is constructed by laying out a series of gates, formed by alternating pairs of red and blue poles. The skier must pass between the two poles forming the gate, with the tips of both skis and the skier&#x27;s feet passing between the poles. A course has 55 to 75 gates for men and 40 to 60 for women. The vertical drop for a men&#x27;s course is and measures slightly less for women. The gates are arranged in a variety of configurations to challenge the competitor.

==Clearing the gates==
Traditionally, bamboo poles were used for gates, the rigidity of which forced skiers to maneuver their entire body around each gate. In the early 1980s, rigid poles were replaced by hard plastic poles, hinged at the base. The hinged gates require, according to FIS rules, only that the skis and boots of the skier go around each gate.

The new gates allow a more direct path down a slalom course through the process of cross-blocking or shinning the gates. Cross-blocking is a technique in which the legs go around the gate with the upper body inclined toward, or even across, the gate; in this case the racer&#x27;s outside pole and shinguards hit the gate, knocking it down and out of the way. Cross-blocking is done by pushing the gate down with the arms, hands, or shins. By 1989, most of the top technical skiers in the world had adopted the cross-block technique.

== Equipment ==

With the innovation of shaped skis around the turn of the 21st century, equipment used for slalom in international competition changed drastically. World Cup skiers commonly skied on slalom skis at a length of in the 1980s and 1990s but by the 2002 Olympic Winter Games in Salt Lake City, the majority of competitors were using skis measuring or less.

The downside of the shorter skis was that athletes found that recoveries were more difficult with a smaller platform underfoot. Out of concern for the safety of athletes, the FIS began to set minimum ski lengths for international slalom competition. The minimum was initially set at for men and for women, but was increased to for men and for women for the 2003–2004 season.
The equipment minimums and maximums imposed by the International Ski Federation (FIS) have created a backlash from skiers, suppliers, and fans. The main objection is that the federation is regressing the equipment, and hence the sport, by two decades. 
American Bode Miller hastened the shift to the shorter, more radical sidecut skis when he achieved unexpected success after becoming the first Junior Olympic athlete to adopt the equipment in giant slalom and super-G in 1996. A few years later, the technology was adapted to slalom skis as well.

<text>The dachshund ( or ; German: &#x27;badger dog&#x27;), also known as the wiener dog or sausage dog, badger dog and doxie, is a short-legged, long-bodied, hound-type dog breed. The dog may be smooth-haired, wire-haired, or long-haired, with varied coloration.

The dachshund was bred to scent, chase, and flush out badgers and other burrow-dwelling animals. The miniature dachshund was bred to hunt small animals such as rabbits.

The dachshund was ranked 9th in registrations with the American Kennel Club in 2022.

==Etymology==


The name &quot;dachshund&quot; is of German origin, and means &#x27;badger dog&#x27;, from (&#x27;badger&#x27;) and (&#x27;dog, hound&#x27;). The German word &quot;Dachshund&quot; is pronounced . The pronunciation varies in English: variations of the first and second syllables include , and , , . The first syllable may be incorrectly pronounced as by some English speakers. Although is a German word, in modern Germany, the dogs are more commonly known by the short name . Working dogs are less commonly known as .

Because of their long, narrow build, they are often nicknamed wiener or sausage dog.

== Classification ==
While classified in the hound group or scent hound group in the United States and Great Britain, the breed has its own group in the countries which belong to the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (World Canine Federation). Many dachshunds, especially the wire-haired subtype, may exhibit behavior and appearance similar to the terrier group of dogs. An argument can be made for the scent (or hound) group classification because the breed was developed to use scent to trail and hunt animals, and probably descended from the Saint Hubert Hound like many modern scent hound breeds such as bloodhounds and Basset Hounds; but with the persistent personality and love for digging that probably developed from the terrier, it can also be argued that they could belong in the terrier, or &quot;earth dog&quot;, group.

== Characteristics ==

=== Appearance ===

A typical dachshund is long-bodied and muscular with short stubby legs. Its front paws are disproportionately large, being paddle-shaped and particularly suitable for digging. Its skin is loose enough not to tear while tunneling in tight burrows to chase prey. Its snout is long.

==== Coat and color ====
There are three dachshund coat varieties: smooth coat (short hair), long-haired, and wire-haired. Longhaired dachshunds have a silky coat and short featherings on legs and ears. Wire-haired dachshunds are the least common coat variety in the United States (although it is the most common in Germany) and the most recent coat to appear in breeding standards.
Dachshunds have a wide variety of colors and patterns, the most common one being red. Their base coloration can be single-colored (either red or cream), tan pointed (black and tan, chocolate and tan, blue and tan, or isabella and tan), and in wire-haired dogs, a color referred to as wild boar. Patterns such as dapple (merle), sable, brindle and piebald also can occur on any of the base colors. Dachshunds in the same litter may be born in different coat colors depending on the genetic makeup of the parents.

The Dachshund Club of America (DCA) and the American Kennel Club (AKC) consider Double Dapple to be out of standard and a disqualifying color in the show ring. Piebald is now a recognized color in the Dachshund Club of America (DCA) breed standard.

Dogs that are double-dappled have the merle pattern of a dapple, but with distinct white patches that occur when the dapple gene expresses itself twice in the same area of the coat. The DCA excluded the wording &quot;double-dapple&quot; from the standard in 2007 and now strictly uses the wording &quot;dapple&quot; as the double dapple gene is commonly responsible for blindness and deafness.
==== Size ====
Dachshunds come in three sizes: standard, miniature, and &quot;kaninchen&quot; (German for &quot;rabbit&quot;). Although the standard and miniature sizes are recognized almost universally, the rabbit size is not recognized by clubs in the United States and the United Kingdom. The rabbit size is recognized by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (World Canine Federation) (FCI), which contain kennel clubs from 83 countries all over the world. An increasingly common size for family pets falls between the miniature and the standard size; these are frequently referred to as &quot;tweenies,&quot; which is not an official classification.

A full-grown standard dachshund typically weighs , while the miniature variety normally weighs less than . The kaninchen weighs . According to kennel club standards, the miniature (and kaninchen, where recognized) differs from the full-size only by size and weight, thus offspring from miniature parents must never weigh more than the miniature standard to be considered a miniature as well. While many kennel club size divisions use weight for classification, such as the American Kennel Club, other kennel club standards determine the difference between the miniature and standard by chest circumference; some kennel clubs, such as in Germany, even measure chest circumference in addition to height and weight.

==== Eye color ====
Light-colored dachshunds can sport amber, light brown, or green eyes; however, kennel club standards state that the darker the eye color, the better. Dapple and double dapple dachshunds can have multi-coloured &quot;wall&quot; eyes with fully blue, partially blue or patched irises owing to the effect of the dapple gene on eye pigmentation expression. &quot;Wall&quot; eye is permissible according to DCA standards but undesirable by AKC standards.

=== Temperament ===
Dachshunds can be stubborn and refuse commands, especially if chasing a small animal which they have a propensity for. As dachshunds were originally used as badger hunters they have a keen sense for chasing smaller animals. Dachshunds are often stubborn, making them a challenge to train.

Dachshunds can be aggressive to strangers and other dogs. Despite this, they are rated in the intelligence of dogs as an average working dog with a persistent ability to follow trained commands 50% of the time or more.
They can have a loud bark. Some bark quite a lot and may need training to stop, while others will not bark much at all. Dachshunds can be standoffish toward strangers. A Japanese study found the Miniature Dachshund to have higher rates of refusing to move whilst on a walk, barking at outside noises whilst inside, barking at strangers visiting their home, separation anxiety, inappropriate elimination (faecal and urinary incontinence), hesitancy to approach unknown humans and canines, and aggression towards family members, highlighting the breed&#x27;s stubbornness and aggression.

According to the American Kennel Club&#x27;s breed standards, &quot;the dachshund is clever, lively and courageous to the point of rashness, persevering in above and below ground work, with all the senses well-developed. Any display of shyness is a serious fault.&quot; Their temperament and body language give the impression that they do not know or care about their relatively small size. Like many small hunting dogs, they will challenge a larger dog. Indulged dachshunds may become snappy or extremely obstinate.

A 2008 University of Pennsylvania study of 6,000 dog owners who were interviewed indicated that dogs of smaller breeds were more likely to be &quot;genetically predisposed toward aggressive behaviour&quot;. Dachshunds were rated the most aggressive, with 20% having bitten strangers, as well as high rates of attacks on other dogs and their owners. The study noted that attacks by small dogs were unlikely to cause serious injuries and because of this were probably under-reported.

== Health ==

The breed is prone to spinal problems, especially intervertebral disk disease (IVDD), due in part to an extremely long spinal column and short rib cage. The risk of injury may be worsened by obesity, jumping, rough handling, or intense exercise, which place greater strain on the vertebrae. About 20–25% of dachshunds will develop IVDD. Dachshunds with a number of calcified intervertebral discs at a young age have a higher risk of developing disc disease in later life. In addition, studies have shown that development of calcified discs is highly heritable in the breed. An appropriate screening programme for IVDD has been identified by Finnish researchers and a UK IVDD screening programme has been developed for breeders with the aim to reduce prevalence of spinal problems.

Treatment consists of combinations of crate confinement and courses of anti-inflammatory medications (steroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like carprofen and meloxicam), or chronic pain medications, like tramadol. Serious cases may require surgery to remove the troublesome disk contents. A dog may need the aid of a cart to get around if paralysis occurs.

A minimally invasive procedure called &quot;percutaneous laser disk ablation&quot; has been developed at the Oklahoma State University Veterinary Hospital. Originally, the procedure was used in clinical trials only on dachshunds that had suffered previous back incidents. Since dachshunds are prone to back issues, the goal is to expand this treatment to dogs in a normal population.

In addition to back problems, the breed is prone to patellar luxation where the kneecap can become dislodged. Dachshunds may also be affected by osteogenesis imperfecta (brittle bone disease). The condition seems to be mainly limited to wire-haired Dachshunds, with 17% being carriers. A genetic test is available to allow breeders to avoid breeding carriers to carriers. In such pairings, each puppy will have a 25% chance of being affected.

In some double dapples, there are varying degrees of vision and hearing loss, including reduced or absent eyes. Not all double dapples have problems with their eyes and/or ears, which may include degrees of hearing loss, full deafness, malformed ears, congenital eye defects, reduced or absent eyes, partial or full blindness, or varying degrees of both vision and hearing problems; but heightened problems can occur owing to the genetic process in which two dapple genes cross, particularly in certain breeding lines. Dapple genes, which are dominant genes, are considered &quot;dilution&quot; genes, meaning whatever color the dog would have originally carried is lightened, or diluted, randomly; two dominant &quot;dilution&quot; genes can cancel each other out, or &quot;cross&quot;, removing all color and producing a white recessive gene, essentially a white mutation. When occurring genetically within the eyes or ears, this white mutation can be detrimental to development, causing hearing or vision problems.

Other dachshund health problems include hereditary epilepsy, granulomatous meningoencephalitis, dental issues, Cushing&#x27;s syndrome, thyroid and autoimmune problems, various allergies and atopies, and various eye conditions including cataracts, glaucoma, progressive retinal atrophy, corneal ulcers, nonulcerative corneal disease, sudden acquired retinal degeneration, and cherry eye. Dachshunds are also 2.5 times more likely than other breeds of dogs to develop patent ductus arteriosus, a congenital heart defect. Dilute color dogs (Blue, Isabella, and Cream) are very susceptible to color dilution alopecia, a skin disorder that can result in hair loss and extreme sensitivity to sun. Since the occurrence and severity of these health problems is largely hereditary, breeders are working to eliminate these.

Factors influencing the litter size of puppies and the proportion of stillborn puppies per litter were analyzed in normally sized German dachshunds. The records analyzed contained data on 42,855 litters. It was found that as the inbreeding coefficient increased, litter size decreased and the percentage of stillborn puppies increased, thus indicating inbreeding depression. It was also found that young and older dams had smaller litter sizes and more stillborn puppies than middle-aged dams.

A study in Japan found the Miniature Dachshund to have lower rates of glaucoma than other breeds. With 2.4% of cases belonging to the breed but the breed making up 10.1% of visits to the veterinary hospital.

Dachshunds are predisposed to hypothyroidism.

===Life expectancy===
A 2018 study in Japan of pet cemetery data put the Miniature Dachshund life expectancy at 13.9 years compared to 13.7 overall and 15.1 for crossbreeds. A 2024 study in the UK found a life expectancy of 13.2 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds with the Miniature Dachshund found to have a life expectancy of 14 years. A 2024 Italian study found a life expectancy of 11.5 years for the breed compared to 10 years overall. A 2005 Swedish study of insurance data found 28% of Dachshund died by the age of 10, less than the overall rate of 35% of dogs dying by the age of 10.

== History ==

The dachshund is a creation of German breeders and includes elements of German, French, and English hounds and terriers. Dachshunds have been kept by royal courts all over Europe, including that of Queen Victoria, who was particularly enamored of the breed.

The first verifiable references to the dachshund, originally named the &quot;Dachs Kriecher&quot; (&quot;badger crawler&quot;) or &quot;Dachs Krieger&quot; (&quot;badger warrior&quot;), came from books written in the early 18th century. Prior to that, there exist references to &quot;badger dogs&quot; and &quot;hole dogs&quot;, but these likely refer to purposes rather than to specific breeds. The original German dachshunds were larger than the modern full-size variety, weighing between , and originally came in straight-legged and crook-legged varieties (the modern dachshund is descended from the latter). Though the breed is famous for its use in exterminating badgers and badger-baiting, dachshunds were also commonly used for rabbit and fox hunting, for locating wounded deer, and in packs were known to hunt game as large as wild boar and as fierce as the wolverine.

There are huge differences of opinion as to when dachshunds were specifically bred for their purpose of hunting badger, as the American Kennel Club states the dachshund was bred in the 15th century, while the Dachshund Club of America states that foresters bred the dogs in the 18th or 19th century.

Double-dapple dachshunds, which are prone to eye disease, blindness, or hearing problems, are generally believed to have been introduced to the United States between 1879 and 1885.

The flap-down ears and famous curved tail of the dachshund have deliberately been bred into the dog. In the case of the ears, this is to keep grass seeds, dirt, and other matter from entering the ear canal. The curved tail is dual-purposed: to be seen more easily in long grass and, in the case of burrowing dachshunds, to help haul the dog out if it becomes stuck in a burrow.
The smooth-haired dachshund, the oldest style, may be a cross between the German Shorthaired Pointer, a Pinscher, and a Bracke (a type of bloodhound), or to have been produced by crossing a short Bruno Jura Hound with a pinscher. Others believe it was a cross from a miniature French pointer and a pinscher; others claim that it was developed from the St. Hubert Hound, also a bloodhound, in the 18th century, and still others believe that they were descended from Basset Hounds, based upon their scent abilities and general appearance.

The exact origins of the dachshund are therefore unknown. According to William Loeffler, from &quot; The American Book of the Dog (1891)&quot;, in the chapter on dachshunds: &quot;The origin of the Dachshund is in doubt, our best authorities disagreeing as to the beginning of the breed.&quot; What can be agreed on, however, is that the smooth dachshund gave rise to both the long-haired and the wire-haired varieties.

There are two theories about how the standard long-haired dachshund came about. One theory is that smooth dachshunds would occasionally produce puppies which had slightly longer hair than their parents. By selectively breeding these animals, breeders eventually produced a dog which consistently produced long-haired offspring, and the long-haired dachshund was born. Another theory is that the standard long-haired dachshund was developed by breeding smooth dachshunds with various land and water spaniels. The long-haired dachshund may be a cross among any of the small dog breeds in the spaniel group, including the German Stoeberhund, and the smooth dachshund.

The wire-haired dachshund, the last to develop, was bred in the late 19th century. There is a possibility the wire-haired dachshund was a cross between the smooth dachshund and various hard-coated terriers and wire-haired pinschers, such as the Schnauzer, the Dandie Dinmont Terrier, the German Wirehaired Pointer, or perhaps the Scottish Terrier.

== Symbol of Germany ==
Dachshunds have traditionally been viewed as a symbol of Germany. Political cartoonists commonly used the image of the dachshund to ridicule Germany. During World War I, the dachshund&#x27;s popularity in the United States plummeted because of this association. As a result, they were often called &quot;liberty hounds&quot;, just as &quot;liberty cabbage&quot; became a term for sauerkraut mostly in North America. The stigma of the association was revived to a lesser extent during World War II, though it was comparatively short-lived. Kaiser Wilhelm II and German field marshal Erwin Rommel were known for keeping dachshunds.

Owing to the association of the breed with Germany, as well as its particular popularity among dog keepers in Munich at the time, the dachshund was chosen as the first official mascot for the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, with the name Waldi.

== Sports ==

Some people train and enter their dachshunds to compete in dachshund races, such as the Wiener Nationals. Several races across the United States routinely draw several thousand attendees.

Despite the popularity of these events, the Dachshund Club of America opposes &quot;wiener racing&quot;, as many greyhound tracks use the events to draw large crowds to their facilities. The DCA is also worried about potential injuries to dogs, owing to their predisposition to back injuries. Another favorite sport is earthdog trials, in which dachshunds enter tunnels with dead ends and obstacles attempting to locate either an artificial bait or live but caged (and thus protected) rats.

== &quot;Dackel&quot; versus &quot;Teckel&quot; ==
In Germany, dachshunds are widely called &quot;Dackel&quot; (both singular and plural). Among hunters, they are mainly referred to as &quot;Teckel&quot;. There are kennels which specialize in breeding hunting dachshunds, the so-called &quot;jagdliche Leistungszucht&quot; (&quot;hunting-related performance breeding&quot;) or &quot;Gebrauchshundezucht&quot; (&quot;working dog breeding&quot;), as opposed to breeding family dogs. Therefore, it is sometimes incorrectly believed that &quot;Teckel&quot; is either a name for the hunting breed or a mark for passing the test for a trained hunting dog (called &quot;VGP&quot;, &quot;Verband-Gebrauchsprüfung&quot;) in Germany.

==Popularity==
Dachshunds are one of the most popular dogs in the United States, ranking 12th in the 2018 AKC registration statistics. They are popular with urban and apartment dwellers, ranking among the top 10 most popular breeds in 76 of 190 major US cities surveyed by the AKC.
There are organized local dachshund clubs in most major American cities, including New York, New Orleans, Portland, Los Angeles, and Chicago.

<text>In computer science, a data structure is a data organization and storage format that is usually chosen for efficient access to data. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data, i.e., it is an algebraic structure about data.

==Usage ==
Data structures serve as the basis for abstract data types (ADT). The ADT defines the logical form of the data type. The data structure implements the physical form of the data type.

Different types of data structures are suited to different kinds of applications, and some are highly specialized to specific tasks. For example, relational databases commonly use B-tree indexes for data retrieval, while compiler implementations usually use hash tables to look up identifiers.

Data structures provide a means to manage large amounts of data efficiently for uses such as large databases and internet indexing services. Usually, efficient data structures are key to designing efficient algorithms. Some formal design methods and programming languages emphasize data structures, rather than algorithms, as the key organizing factor in software design. Data structures can be used to organize the storage and retrieval of information stored in both main memory and secondary memory.

==Implementation==
Data structures can be implemented using a variety of programming languages and techniques, but they all share the common goal of efficiently organizing and storing data. Data structures are generally based on the ability of a computer to fetch and store data at any place in its memory, specified by a pointer—a bit string, representing a memory address, that can be itself stored in memory and manipulated by the program. Thus, the array and record data structures are based on computing the addresses of data items with arithmetic operations, while the linked data structures are based on storing addresses of data items within the structure itself. This approach to data structuring has profound implications for the efficiency and scalability of algorithms. For instance, the contiguous memory allocation in arrays facilitates rapid access and modification operations, leading to optimized performance in sequential data processing scenarios. 

The implementation of a data structure usually requires writing a set of procedures that create and manipulate instances of that structure. The efficiency of a data structure cannot be analyzed separately from those operations. This observation motivates the theoretical concept of an abstract data type, a data structure that is defined indirectly by the operations that may be performed on it, and the mathematical properties of those operations (including their space and time cost).

==Examples==
There are numerous types of data structures, generally built upon simpler primitive data types. Well known examples are:
* An array is a number of elements in a specific order, typically all of the same type (depending on the language, individual elements may either all be forced to be the same type, or may be of almost any type). Elements are accessed using an integer index to specify which element is required. Typical implementations allocate contiguous memory words for the elements of arrays (but this is not always a necessity). Arrays may be fixed-length or resizable.
* A linked list (also just called &quot;list&quot;) is a linear collection of data elements of any type, called nodes, where each node has itself a value, and points to the next node in the linked list. The principal advantage of a linked list over an array is that values can always be efficiently inserted and removed without relocating the rest of the list. Certain other operations, such as random access to a certain element, are however slower on lists than on arrays.
* A record (also called &quot;tuple&quot; or &quot;struct&quot;) is an aggregate data structure. A record is a value that contains other values, typically in fixed number and sequence and typically indexed by names. The elements of records are usually called &quot;fields&quot; or &quot;members&quot;. In the context of object-oriented programming, records are known as plain old data structures to distinguish them from objects.
* Hash tables, also known as hash maps, are data structures that provide fast retrieval of values based on keys. They use a hashing function to map keys to indexes in an array, allowing for constant-time access in the average case. Hash tables are commonly used in dictionaries, caches, and database indexing. However, hash collisions can occur, which can impact their performance. Techniques like chaining and open addressing are employed to handle collisions.
* Graphs are collections of nodes connected by edges, representing relationships between entities. Graphs can be used to model social networks, computer networks, and transportation networks, among other things. They consist of vertices (nodes) and edges (connections between nodes). Graphs can be directed or undirected, and they can have cycles or be acyclic. Graph traversal algorithms include breadth-first search and depth-first search.
* Stacks and queues are abstract data types that can be implemented using arrays or linked lists. A stack has two primary operations: push (adds an element to the top of the stack) and pop (removes the topmost element from the stack), that follow the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Queues have two main operations: enqueue (adds an element to the rear of the queue) and dequeue (removes an element from the front of the queue) that follow the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.
* Trees represent a hierarchical organization of elements. A tree consists of nodes connected by edges, with one node being the root and all other nodes forming subtrees. Trees are widely used in various algorithms and data storage scenarios. Binary trees (particularly heaps), AVL trees, and B-trees are some popular types of trees. They enable efficient and optimal searching, sorting, and hierarchical representation of data.

A trie, or prefix tree, is a special type of tree used to efficiently retrieve strings. In a trie, each node represents a character of a string, and the edges between nodes represent the characters that connect them. This structure is especially useful for tasks like autocomplete, spell-checking, and creating dictionaries. Tries allow for quick searches and operations based on string prefixes.

==Language support==
Most assembly languages and some low-level languages, such as BCPL (Basic Combined Programming Language), lack built-in support for data structures. On the other hand, many high-level programming languages and some higher-level assembly languages, such as MASM, have special syntax or other built-in support for certain data structures, such as records and arrays. For example, the C (a direct descendant of BCPL) and Pascal languages support structs and records, respectively, in addition to vectors (one-dimensional arrays) and multi-dimensional arrays.

Most programming languages feature some sort of library mechanism that allows data structure implementations to be reused by different programs. Modern languages usually come with standard libraries that implement the most common data structures. Examples are the C++ Standard Template Library, the Java Collections Framework, and the Microsoft .NET Framework.

Modern languages also generally support modular programming, the separation between the interface of a library module and its implementation. Some provide opaque data types that allow clients to hide implementation details. Object-oriented programming languages, such as C++, Java, and Smalltalk, typically use classes for this purpose.

Many known data structures have concurrent versions which allow multiple computing threads to access a single concrete instance of a data structure simultaneously.

<doc id="8520" wikidata="Q80135" url="?curid=8520" title="Dmitri Shostakovich">
<text>Dmitri Dmitriyevich Shostakovich (9 August 1975) was a Soviet-era Russian composer and pianist who became internationally known after the premiere of his First Symphony in 1926 and thereafter was regarded as a major composer.
Shostakovich achieved early fame in the Soviet Union, but had a complex relationship with its government. His 1934 opera &quot;Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk&quot; was initially a success but later condemned by the Soviet government, putting his career at risk. In 1948, his work was denounced under the Zhdanov Doctrine, with professional consequences lasting several years. Even after his censure was rescinded in 1956, performances of his music were occasionally subject to state interventions, as with his Thirteenth Symphony (1962). Nevertheless, Shostakovich was a member of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR (1947) and the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union (from 1962 until his death), as well as chairman of the RSFSR Union of Composers (1960–1968). Over the course of his career, he earned several important awards, including the Order of Lenin, from the Soviet government.
Shostakovich combined a variety of different musical techniques in his works. His music is characterized by sharp contrasts, elements of the grotesque, and ambivalent tonality; he was also heavily influenced by neoclassicism and by the late Romanticism of Gustav Mahler. His orchestral works include 15 symphonies and six concerti (two each for piano, violin, and cello). His chamber works include 15 string quartets, a piano quintet, and two piano trios. His solo piano works include two sonatas, an early set of 24 preludes, and a later set of 24 preludes and fugues. Stage works include three completed operas and three ballets. Shostakovich also wrote several song cycles, and a substantial quantity of music for theatre and film.
Shostakovich&#x27;s reputation has continued to grow after his death. Scholarly interest has increased significantly since the late 20th century, including considerable debate about the relationship between his music and his attitudes toward the Soviet government.

== Biography ==
=== Youth ===
Born into a Russian family that lived on Podolskaya Street in Saint Petersburg, Russian Empire, Shostakovich was the second of three children of Dmitri Boleslavovich Shostakovich and Sofiya Vasilievna Kokoulina. Shostakovich&#x27;s immediate forebears came from Siberia, but his paternal grandfather, Bolesław Szostakowicz, was of Polish Roman Catholic descent, tracing his family roots to the region of the town of Vileyka in today&#x27;s Belarus. A Polish revolutionary in the January Uprising of 1863–64, Szostakowicz was exiled to Narym in 1866 in the crackdown that followed Dmitry Karakozov&#x27;s assassination attempt on Tsar Alexander II. When his term of exile ended, Szostakowicz decided to remain in Siberia. He eventually became a successful banker in Irkutsk and raised a large family. His son Dmitri Boleslavovich Shostakovich, the composer&#x27;s father, was born in exile in Narym in 1875 and studied physics and mathematics at Saint Petersburg University, graduating in 1899. He then went to work as an engineer under Dmitri Mendeleev at the Bureau of Weights and Measures in Saint Petersburg. In 1903, he married another Siberian immigrant to the capital, Sofiya Vasilievna Kokoulina, one of six children born to a Siberian Russian.

Their son, Dmitri Dmitriyevich Shostakovich, displayed musical talent after he began piano lessons with his mother at the age of nine. On several occasions, he displayed a remarkable ability to remember what his mother had played at the previous lesson, and would get &quot;caught in the act&quot; of playing the previous lesson&#x27;s music while pretending to read different music placed in front of him. In 1918, he wrote a funeral march in memory of two leaders of the Kadet party murdered by Bolshevik sailors.

In 1919, at age 13, Shostakovich was admitted to the Petrograd Conservatory, then headed by Alexander Glazunov, who monitored his progress closely and promoted him. Shostakovich studied piano with Leonid Nikolayev and Elena Rozanova, composition with Maximilian Steinberg, and counterpoint and fugue with Nikolay Sokolov, who became his friend. He also attended Alexander Ossovsky&#x27;s music history classes. In 1925, he enrolled in the conducting classes of Nikolai Malko, where he conducted the conservatory orchestra in a private performance of Beethoven&#x27;s First Symphony. According to the recollections of the composer&#x27;s classmate, :

Shostakovich stood at the podium, played with his hair and jacket cuffs, looked around at the hushed teenagers with instruments at the ready and raised the baton. ... He neither stopped the orchestra, nor made any remarks; he focused his entire attention on aspects of tempi and dynamics, which were very clearly displayed in his gestures. The contrasts between the &quot;Adagio molto&quot; of the introduction and &quot;Allegro con brio&quot; first theme were quite striking, as were those between the percussive accents of the chords (woodwinds, French horns, pizzicato strings) and the momentarily extended piano in the introduction following them. In the character given to the pattern of the first theme, I recall, there was both vigorous striving and lightness; in the bass part there was an emphasized pliancy of tenderly threaded articulation... Moments of these sorts... were discoveries of an improvised order, born from an intuitively refined understanding of the character of a piece and the elements of musical imagery embedded in it. And the players enjoyed it.

On 20 March 1925, Shostakovich&#x27;s music was played in Moscow for the first time, in a program which also included works by his friend Vissarion Shebalin. To the composer&#x27;s disappointment, the critics and public there received his music coolly. During his visit to Moscow, Mikhail Kvadri introduced him to Mikhail Tukhachevsky, who helped the composer find accommodation and work there, and sent a driver to take him to a concert in &quot;a very stylish automobile&quot;.

Shostakovich&#x27;s musical breakthrough was the First Symphony, written as his graduation piece at the age of 19. Initially, Shostakovich aspired only to perform it privately with the conservatory orchestra and prepared to conduct the scherzo himself. By late 1925, Malko agreed to conduct its premiere with the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra after Steinberg and Shostakovich&#x27;s friend Boleslav Yavorsky brought the symphony to his attention. On 12 May 1926, Malko led the premiere of the symphony; the audience received it enthusiastically, demanding an encore of the scherzo. Thereafter, Shostakovich regularly celebrated the date of his symphonic debut.

=== Early career ===

After graduation, Shostakovich embarked on a dual career as concert pianist and composer, but his dry keyboard style was often criticized. Shostakovich maintained a heavy performance schedule until 1930; after 1933, he performed only his own compositions. Along with , Grigory Ginzburg, Lev Oborin, and Josif Shvarts, he was among the Soviet contestants in the inaugural I International Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw in 1927. Bogdanov-Berezhovsky later remembered:

, who heard Shostakovich play his Chopin programs before he went to Warsaw, said that his &quot;anti-sentimental&quot; playing, which eschewed rubato and extreme dynamic contrasts, was unlike anything he had ever heard. called Shostakovich&#x27;s playing &quot;profound and lacking any salon-like mannerisms.&quot;

Shostakovich was stricken with appendicitis on the opening day of the competition, but his condition improved by the time of his first performance on 27 January 1927. (He had his appendix removed on 25 April.) According to Shostakovich, his playing found favor with the audience. He persisted into the final round of the competition but ultimately earned only a diploma, no prize; Oborin was declared the winner. Shostakovich was upset about the result but for a time resolved to continue a career as performer. While recovering from his appendectomy in April 1927, Shostakovich said he was beginning to reassess those plans:

After the competition, Shostakovich and Oborin spent a week in Berlin. There he met the conductor Bruno Walter, who was so impressed by Shostakovich&#x27;s First Symphony that he conducted its first performance outside Russia later that year. Leopold Stokowski led the American premiere the next year in Philadelphia and also made the work&#x27;s first recording.

In 1927, Shostakovich wrote his Second Symphony (subtitled &quot;To October&quot;), a patriotic piece with a pro-Soviet choral finale. Owing to its modernism, it did not meet with the same enthusiasm as his First. This year also marked the beginning of Shostakovich&#x27;s close friendship with musicologist and theatre critic Ivan Sollertinsky, whom he had first met in 1921 through their mutual friends Lev Arnshtam and Lydia Zhukova. Shostakovich later said that Sollertinsky &quot;taught [him] to understand and love such great masters as Brahms, Mahler, and Bruckner&quot; and that he instilled in him &quot;an interest in music ... from Bach to Offenbach.&quot;

While writing the Second Symphony, Shostakovich also began work on his satirical opera &quot;The Nose&quot;, based on the story by Nikolai Gogol. In June 1929, against the composer&#x27;s wishes, the opera was given a concert performance; it was ferociously attacked by the Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians (RAPM). Its stage premiere on 18 January 1930 opened to generally poor reviews and widespread incomprehension among musicians. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Shostakovich worked at TRAM, a proletarian youth theatre. Although he did little work in this post, it shielded him from ideological attack. Much of this period was spent writing his opera &quot;Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk&quot;, which was first performed in 1934. It was initially immediately successful, on both popular and official levels. It was described as &quot;the result of the general success of Socialist construction, of the correct policy of the Party&quot;, and as an opera that &quot;could have been written only by a Soviet composer brought up in the best tradition of Soviet culture&quot;.

Shostakovich married his first wife, Nina Varzar, in 1932. Difficulties led to a divorce in 1935, but the couple soon remarried when Nina became pregnant with their first child, Galina.

=== First denunciation ===

On 17 January 1936, Joseph Stalin paid a rare visit to the opera for a performance of a new work, &quot;Quiet Flows the Don&quot;, based on the novel by Mikhail Sholokhov, by the little-known composer Ivan Dzerzhinsky, who was called to Stalin&#x27;s box at the end of the performance and told that his work had &quot;considerable ideological-political value&quot;. On 26 January, Stalin revisited the opera, accompanied by Vyacheslav Molotov, Andrei Zhdanov and Anastas Mikoyan, to hear &quot;Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District&quot;. He and his entourage left without speaking to anyone. Shostakovich had been forewarned by a friend that he should postpone a planned concert tour in Arkhangelsk in order to be present at that particular performance. Eyewitness accounts testify that Shostakovich was &quot;white as a sheet&quot; when he went to take his bow after the third act.

The next day, Shostakovich left for Arkhangelsk, where he heard on 28 January that &quot;Pravda&quot; had published an editorial titled &quot;Muddle Instead of Music&quot;, complaining that the opera was a &quot;deliberately dissonant, muddled stream of sounds ...[that] quacks, hoots, pants and gasps.&quot; Shostakovich continued his performance tour as scheduled, with no disruptions. From Arkhangelsk, he instructed Isaac Glikman to subscribe to a clipping service. The editorial was the signal for a nationwide campaign, during which even Soviet music critics who had praised the opera were forced to recant in print, saying they &quot;failed to detect the shortcomings of &quot;Lady Macbeth&quot; as pointed out by &quot;Pravda&quot;&quot;. There was resistance from those who admired Shostakovich, including Sollertinsky, who turned up at a composers&#x27; meeting in Leningrad called to denounce the opera and praised it instead. Two other speakers supported him. When Shostakovich returned to Leningrad, he had a telephone call from the commander of the Leningrad Military District, who had been asked by Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky to make sure that he was all right. When the writer Isaac Babel was under arrest four years later, he told his interrogators that &quot;it was common ground for us to proclaim the genius of the slighted Shostakovich.&quot;

On 6 February, Shostakovich was again attacked in &quot;Pravda&quot;, this time for his light comic ballet &quot;The Limpid Stream&quot;, which was denounced because &quot;it jangles and expresses nothing&quot; and did not give an accurate picture of peasant life on a collective farm. Fearful that he was about to be arrested, Shostakovich secured an appointment with the Chairman of the USSR State Committee on Culture, Platon Kerzhentsev, who reported to Stalin and Molotov that he had instructed the composer to &quot;reject formalist errors and in his art attain something that could be understood by the broad masses&quot;, and that Shostakovich had admitted being in the wrong and had asked for a meeting with Stalin, which was not granted.

The &quot;Pravda&quot; campaign against Shostakovich caused his commissions and concert appearances, and performances of his music, to decline markedly. His monthly earnings dropped from an average of as much as 12,000 rubles to as little as 2,000.

1936 marked the beginning of the Great Terror, in which many of Shostakovich&#x27;s friends and relatives were imprisoned or killed. These included Tukhachevsky, executed 12 June 1937; his brother-in-law Vsevolod Frederiks, who was eventually released but died before he returned home; his close friend Nikolai Zhilyayev, a musicologist who had taught Tukhachevsky, was executed; his mother-in-law, the astronomer , who was sent to a camp in Karaganda and later released; his friend the Marxist writer Galina Serebryakova, who spent 20 years in the gulag; his uncle Maxim Kostrykin (died); and his colleagues Boris Kornilov (executed) and Adrian Piotrovsky (executed).

Shostakovich&#x27;s daughter Galina was born during this period in 1936; his son Maxim was born two years later.

Withdrawal of the Fourth Symphony

The publication of the &quot;Pravda&quot; editorials coincided with the composition of Shostakovich&#x27;s Fourth Symphony. The work continued a shift in his style, influenced by the music of Mahler, and gave him problems as he attempted to reform his style. Despite the &quot;Pravda&quot; articles, he continued to compose the symphony and planned a premiere at the end of 1936. Rehearsals began that December, but according to Isaac Glikman, who had attended the rehearsals with the composer, the manager of the Leningrad Philharmonic persuaded Shostakovich to withdraw the symphony. Shostakovich did not repudiate the work and retained its designation as his Fourth Symphony. (A reduction for two pianos was performed and published in 1946, and the work was finally premiered in 1961.)

In the months between the withdrawal of the Fourth Symphony and the completion of the Fifth on 20 July 1937, the only concert work Shostakovich composed was the &quot;Four Romances on Texts by Pushkin&quot;.

Fifth Symphony and return to favor

The composer&#x27;s response to his denunciation was the Fifth Symphony of 1937, which was musically more conservative than his recent works. Premiered on 21 November 1937 in Leningrad, it was a phenomenal success. The Fifth brought many to tears and welling emotions. Later, Shostakovich&#x27;s purported memoir, &quot;Testimony&quot;, stated: &quot;I&#x27;ll never believe that a man who understood nothing could feel the Fifth Symphony. Of course they understood, they understood what was happening around them and they understood what the Fifth was about.&quot;

The success put Shostakovich in good standing once again. Music critics and the authorities alike, including those who had earlier accused him of formalism, claimed that he had learned from his mistakes and become a true Soviet artist. In a newspaper article published under Shostakovich&#x27;s name, the Fifth was characterized as &quot;A Soviet artist&#x27;s creative response to just criticism.&quot; The composer Dmitry Kabalevsky, who had been among those who disassociated themselves from Shostakovich when the &quot;Pravda&quot; article was published, praised the Fifth and congratulated Shostakovich for &quot;not having given in to the seductive temptations of his previous &#x27;erroneous&#x27; ways.&quot;

It was also at this time that Shostakovich composed the first of his string quartets. In September 1937, he began to teach composition at the Leningrad Conservatory, which provided some financial security.

=== Second World War ===
In 1939, before Soviet forces attempted to invade Finland, the Party Secretary of Leningrad Andrei Zhdanov commissioned a celebratory piece from Shostakovich, the &quot;Suite on Finnish Themes&quot;, to be performed as the marching bands of the Red Army paraded through Helsinki. The Winter War was a bitter experience for the Red Army, the parade never happened, and Shostakovich never laid claim to the authorship of this work. It was not performed until 2001. After the outbreak of war between the Soviet Union and Germany in 1941, Shostakovich initially remained in Leningrad. He tried to enlist in the military but was turned away because of his poor eyesight. To compensate, he became a volunteer for the Leningrad Conservatory&#x27;s firefighter brigade and delivered a radio broadcast to the Soviet people. &quot;&quot; The photograph for which he posed was published in newspapers throughout the country.

Shostakovich&#x27;s most famous wartime contribution was the Seventh Symphony. The composer wrote the first three movements in Leningrad while it was under siege; he completed the work in Kuybyshev (now Samara), where he and his family had been evacuated. According to a radio address he made on 17 September 1941, he continued work on the symphony in order to show his fellow citizens that everyone had a &quot;soldier&#x27;s duty&quot; to ensure life went on. In another article written on 8 October, he wrote that the Seventh was a &quot;symphony about our age, our people, our sacred war, and our victory.&quot; Shostakovich finished his Seventh Symphony on 27 December. The symphony was premiered by the Bolshoi Theatre Orchestra in Kuibyshev on 29 March and soon performed in London and the United States, where several conductors vied to conduct its first American performance. It was subsequently performed in Leningrad while the city was still under siege. The city&#x27;s remaining orchestra only had 14 musicians left, which led conductor Karl Eliasberg to reinforce it by recruiting anyone who could play an instrument.

The Shostakovich family moved to Moscow in spring 1943, by which time the Red Army was on the offensive. As a result, Soviet authorities and the international public were puzzled by the tragic tone of the Eighth Symphony, which in the Western press had briefly acquired the nickname &quot;Stalingrad Symphony&quot;. The symphony was received tepidly in the Soviet Union and the West. Olin Downes expressed his disappointment in the piece, but Carlos Chávez, who had conducted the symphony&#x27;s Mexican premiere, praised it highly.

Shostakovich had expressed as early as 1943 his intention to cap his wartime trilogy of symphonies with a grandiose Ninth. On 16 January 1945, he announced to his students that he had begun work on its first movement the day before. In April, his friend Isaac Glikman heard an extensive portion of the first movement, noting that it was &quot;majestic in scale, in pathos, in its breathtaking motion&quot;. Shortly thereafter, Shostakovich ceased work on this version of the Ninth, which remained lost until musicologist Olga Digonskaya rediscovered it in December 2003. Shostakovich began to compose his actual, unrelated Ninth Symphony in late July 1945; he completed it on 30 August. It was shorter and lighter in texture than its predecessors. Gavriil Popov wrote that it was &quot;splendid in its joie de vivre, gaiety, brilliance, and pungency!&quot; By 1946 it was the subject of official criticism. Israel Nestyev asked whether it was the right time for &quot;a light and amusing interlude between Shostakovich&#x27;s significant creations, a temporary rejection of great, serious problems for the sake of playful, filigree-trimmed trifles.&quot; The &quot;New York World-Telegram&quot; of 27 July 1946 was similarly dismissive: &quot;The Russian composer should not have expressed his feelings about the defeat of Nazism in such a childish manner&quot;. Shostakovich continued to compose chamber music, notably his Second Piano Trio, dedicated to the memory of Sollertinsky, with a Jewish-inspired finale.

In 1947, Shostakovich was made a deputy to the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR.

=== Second denunciation ===
In 1948, Shostakovich, along with many other composers, was again denounced for formalism in the Zhdanov decree. Andrei Zhdanov, Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR, accused the composers (including Sergei Prokofiev and Aram Khachaturian) of writing inappropriate and formalist music. This was part of an ongoing anti-formalism campaign intended to root out all Western compositional influence as well as any perceived &quot;non-Russian&quot; output. The conference resulted in the publication of the Central Committee&#x27;s Decree &quot;On V. Muradeli&#x27;s opera &quot;The Great Friendship&quot;&quot;, which targeted all Soviet composers and demanded that they write only &quot;proletarian&quot; music, or music for the masses. The accused composers, including Shostakovich, were summoned to make public apologies in front of the committee. Most of Shostakovich&#x27;s works were banned, and his family had privileges withdrawn. Yuri Lyubimov says that at this time &quot;he waited for his arrest at night out on the landing by the lift, so that at least his family wouldn&#x27;t be disturbed.&quot;

The decree&#x27;s consequences for composers were harsh. Shostakovich was among those dismissed from the Conservatory altogether. For him, the loss of money was perhaps the heaviest blow. Others still in the Conservatory experienced an atmosphere thick with suspicion. No one wanted his work to be understood as formalist, so many resorted to accusing their colleagues of writing or performing anti-proletarian music.

During the next few years, Shostakovich composed three categories of work: film music to pay the rent, official works aimed at securing official rehabilitation, and serious works &quot;for the desk drawer&quot;. The last included the Violin Concerto No. 1 and the song cycle &quot;From Jewish Folk Poetry&quot;. The cycle was written at a time when the postwar anti-Semitic campaign was already under way, with widespread arrests, including that of Dobrushin and Yiditsky, the compilers of the book from which Shostakovich took his texts.

The restrictions on Shostakovich&#x27;s music and living arrangements were eased in 1949, when Stalin decided that the Soviets needed to send artistic representatives to the Cultural and Scientific Congress for World Peace in New York City, and that Shostakovich should be among them. For Shostakovich, it was a humiliating experience, culminating in a New York press conference where he was expected to read a prepared speech. Nicolas Nabokov, who was present in the audience, witnessed Shostakovich starting to read &quot;in a nervous and shaky voice&quot; before he had to break off &quot;and the speech was continued in English by a suave radio baritone&quot;. Fully aware that Shostakovich was not free to speak his mind, Nabokov publicly asked him whether he supported the then recent denunciation of Stravinsky&#x27;s music in the Soviet Union. A great admirer of Stravinsky who had been influenced by his music, Shostakovich had no alternative but to answer in the affirmative. Nabokov did not hesitate to write that this demonstrated that Shostakovich was &quot;not a free man, but an obedient tool of his government.&quot; Shostakovich never forgave Nabokov for this public humiliation. That same year, he composed the cantata &quot;Song of the Forests&quot;, which praised Stalin as the &quot;great gardener&quot;.

Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953 was the biggest step toward Shostakovich&#x27;s rehabilitation as a creative artist, which was marked by his Tenth Symphony. It features a number of musical quotations and codes (notably the DSCH and Elmira motifs, Elmira Nazirova being a pianist and composer who had studied under Shostakovich in the year before his dismissal from the Moscow Conservatory), the meaning of which is still debated, while the savage second movement, according to &quot;Testimony&quot;, is intended as a musical portrait of Stalin. The Tenth ranks alongside the Fifth and Seventh as one of Shostakovich&#x27;s most popular works. 1953 also saw a stream of premieres of the &quot;desk drawer&quot; works.

During the 1940s and 1950s, Shostakovich had close relationships with two of his pupils, Galina Ustvolskaya and Elmira Nazirova. In the background to all this remained Shostakovich&#x27;s first, open marriage to Nina Varzar until her death in 1954. He taught Ustvolskaya from 1939 to 1941 and then from 1947 to 1948. The nature of their relationship is far from clear: Mstislav Rostropovich described it as &quot;tender&quot;. Ustvolskaya rejected a proposal of marriage from him after Nina&#x27;s death. Shostakovich&#x27;s daughter, Galina, recalled her father consulting her and Maxim about the possibility of Ustvolskaya becoming their stepmother. Ustvolskaya&#x27;s friend Viktor Suslin said that she had been &quot;deeply disappointed by [Shostakovich&#x27;s] conspicuous silence&quot; when her music faced criticism after her graduation from the Leningrad Conservatory. The relationship with Nazirova seems to have been one-sided, expressed largely in his letters to her, and can be dated to around 1953 to 1956. He married his second wife, Komsomol activist Margarita Kainova, in 1956; the couple proved ill-matched, and divorced five years later.

In 1954, Shostakovich wrote the Festive Overture, opus 96; it was used as the theme music for the 1980 Summer Olympics. (His &quot;Theme from the film &quot;Pirogov&quot;, Opus 76a: Finale&quot; was played as the cauldron was lit at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece.)

In 1959, Shostakovich appeared on stage in Moscow at the end of a concert performance of his Fifth Symphony, congratulating Leonard Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic Orchestra for their performance (part of a concert tour of the Soviet Union). Later that year, Bernstein and the Philharmonic recorded the symphony in Boston for Columbia Records.

=== Joining the Party ===
The year 1960 marked another turning point in Shostakovich&#x27;s life: he joined the Communist Party. The government wanted to appoint him Chairman of the RSFSR Union of Composers, but to hold that position he was required to obtain Party membership. It was understood that Nikita Khrushchev, the First Secretary of the Communist Party from 1953 to 1964, was looking for support from the intelligentsia&#x27;s leading ranks in an effort to create a better relationship with the Soviet Union&#x27;s artists. This event has variously been interpreted as a show of commitment, a mark of cowardice, the result of political pressure, and his free decision. On the one hand, the apparat was less repressive than it had been before Stalin&#x27;s death. On the other, his son recalled that the event reduced Shostakovich to tears, and that he later told his wife Irina that he had been blackmailed. Lev Lebedinsky has said that the composer was suicidal. In 1960, he was appointed Chairman of the RSFSR Union of Composers; from 1962 until his death, he also served as a delegate in the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. By joining the party, Shostakovich also committed himself to finally writing the homage to Lenin that he had promised before. His Twelfth Symphony, which portrays the Bolshevik Revolution and was completed in 1961, was dedicated to Lenin and called &quot;The Year 1917&quot;.

Shostakovich&#x27;s musical response to these personal crises was the Eighth String Quartet, composed in only three days. He subtitled the piece &quot;To the victims of fascism and war&quot;, ostensibly in memory of the Dresden fire bombing that took place in 1945. Yet like the Tenth Symphony, the quartet incorporates quotations from several of his past works and his musical monogram. Shostakovich confessed to his friend Isaac Glikman, &quot;I started thinking that if some day I die, nobody is likely to write a work in memory of me, so I had better write one myself.&quot; Several of Shostakovich&#x27;s colleagues, including Natalya Vovsi-Mikhoels and the cellist Valentin Berlinsky, were also aware of the Eighth Quartet&#x27;s biographical intent. Peter J. Rabinowitz has also pointed to covert references to Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphosen&quot; in it.

In 1962, Shostakovich married for the third time, to Irina Supinskaya. In a letter to Glikman, he wrote, &quot;her only defect is that she is 27 years old. In all other respects she is splendid: clever, cheerful, straightforward and very likeable.&quot; According to Galina Vishnevskaya, who knew the Shostakoviches well, this marriage was a very happy one: &quot;It was with her that Dmitri Dmitriyevich finally came to know domestic peace... Surely, she prolonged his life by several years.&quot; In November, he conducted publicly for the only time in his life, leading a couple of his own works in Gorky; otherwise he declined to conduct, citing nerves and ill health.

That year saw Shostakovich again turn to the subject of anti-Semitism in his Thirteenth Symphony (subtitled &quot;Babi Yar&quot;). The symphony sets a number of poems by Yevgeny Yevtushenko, the first of which commemorates a massacre of Ukrainian Jews during the Second World War. Opinions are divided as to how great a risk this was: the poem had been published in Soviet media and was not banned, but it remained controversial. After the symphony&#x27;s premiere, Yevtushenko was forced to add a stanza to his poem that said that Russians and Ukrainians had died alongside the Jews at Babi Yar.

In 1965, Shostakovich raised his voice in defence of poet Joseph Brodsky, who was sentenced to five years of exile and hard labor. Shostakovich co-signed protests with Yevtushenko, fellow Soviet artists Kornei Chukovsky, Anna Akhmatova, Samuil Marshak, and the French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre. After the protests, the sentence was commuted, and Brodsky returned to Leningrad.

=== Later life ===
In 1964, Shostakovich composed the music for the Russian film &quot;Hamlet&quot;, which was favorably reviewed by &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;But the lack of this aural stimulation—of Shakespeare&#x27;s eloquent words—is recompensed in some measure by a splendid and stirring musical score by Dmitri Shostakovich. This has great dignity and depth, and at times an appropriate wildness or becoming levity&quot;.

In later life, Shostakovich suffered from chronic ill health, but he resisted giving up cigarettes and vodka. Beginning in 1958, he suffered from a debilitating condition that particularly affected his right hand, eventually forcing him to give up piano playing; in 1965, it was diagnosed as poliomyelitis, but consensus on his diagnosis is unclear. He also suffered heart attacks in 1966,1970, and 1971, as well as several falls in which he broke both his legs; in 1967, he wrote in a letter: &quot;Target achieved so far: 75% (right leg broken, left leg broken, right hand defective). All I need to do now is wreck the left hand and then 100% of my extremities will be out of order.&quot;

A preoccupation with his own mortality permeates Shostakovich&#x27;s later works, such as the later quartets and the Fourteenth Symphony of 1969 (a song cycle based on a number of poems on the theme of death). He dedicated the Fourteenth to his close friend Benjamin Britten, who conducted its Western premiere at the 1970 Aldeburgh Festival. The Fifteenth Symphony of 1971 is, by contrast, melodic and retrospective in nature, quoting Wagner, Rossini and the composer&#x27;s own Fourth Symphony.

=== Death ===

Despite suffering from motor neurone disease (ALS) or some other neurological ailment from as early as the 1950s, Shostakovich insisted upon writing all his own correspondence and music himself, even when his right hand became virtually unusable. His last work was his Viola Sonata, which was first performed officially on 1 October 1975.

Shostakovich, a smoker since his youth, was forced to give up the habit after having his first heart attack in 1966. He was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1973. His death is variously attributed to lung cancer or heart failure.

Shostakovich died on 9 August 1975 at the Central Clinical Hospital in Moscow. A civic funeral was held; he was interred in Novodevichy Cemetery, Moscow.

=== Legacy ===
Shostakovich left behind several recordings of his own piano works; other noted interpreters of his music include Mstislav Rostropovich, Tatiana Nikolayeva, Maria Yudina, David Oistrakh, and members of the Beethoven Quartet.

Shostakovich&#x27;s influence on later composers outside the former Soviet Union has been relatively slight. His influence can be seen in some Nordic composers, such as Lars-Erik Larsson.

The Shostakovich Peninsula on Alexander Island, Antarctica, is named for him.

== Music ==
=== Overview ===
Shostakovich&#x27;s works are broadly tonal but with elements of atonality and chromaticism. In some of his later works (e.g., the Twelfth Quartet), he made use of tone rows. His output is dominated by his cycles of symphonies and string quartets, each totaling 15. The symphonies are distributed fairly evenly throughout his career, while the quartets are concentrated towards the latter part. Among the most popular are the Fifth and Seventh Symphonies and the Eighth and Fifteenth Quartets. Other works include operas, concertos, chamber music, and a large quantity of theatre and film music.

Shostakovich&#x27;s music shows the influence of many of the composers he most admired: Bach in his fugues and passacaglias; Beethoven in the late quartets; Mahler in the symphonies; and Berg in his use of musical codes and quotations. Among Russian composers, he particularly admired Modest Mussorgsky, whose operas &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; and &quot;Khovanshchina&quot; he reorchestrated; Mussorgsky&#x27;s influence is most prominent in the wintry scenes of &quot;Lady Macbeth&quot; and the Eleventh Symphony, as well as in satirical works such as &quot;Rayok&quot;. Prokofiev&#x27;s influence is most apparent in the earlier piano works, such as the first sonata and first concerto. The influence of Russian church and folk music is evident in his works for unaccompanied choir of the 1950s.

Shostakovich&#x27;s relationship with Stravinsky was profoundly ambivalent; as he wrote to Glikman, &quot;Stravinsky the composer I worship. Stravinsky the thinker I despise.&quot; He was particularly enamoured of the &quot;Symphony of Psalms&quot;, presenting a copy of his own piano version of it to Stravinsky when the latter visited the USSR in 1962. (The meeting of the two composers was not very successful; observers commented on Shostakovich&#x27;s extreme nervousness and Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;cruelty&quot; to him.)

Many commentators have noted the disjunction between the experimental works before the 1936 denunciation and the more conservative ones that followed; the composer told Flora Litvinova, &quot;without &#x27;Party guidance&#x27; ... I would have displayed more brilliance, used more sarcasm, I could have revealed my ideas openly instead of having to resort to camouflage.&quot; Articles Shostakovich published in 1934 and 1935 cited Berg, Schoenberg, Krenek, Hindemith, &quot;and especially Stravinsky&quot; among his influences. Key works of the earlier period are the First Symphony, which combined the academicism of the conservatory with his progressive inclinations; &quot;The Nose&quot; (&quot;The most uncompromisingly modernist of all his stage-works&quot;); &quot;Lady Macbeth&quot;, which precipitated the denunciation; and the Fourth Symphony, described in Grove&#x27;s Dictionary as &quot;a colossal synthesis of Shostakovich&#x27;s musical development to date&quot;. The Fourth was also the first piece in which Mahler&#x27;s influence came to the fore, prefiguring the route Shostakovich took to secure his rehabilitation, while he himself admitted that the preceding two were his least successful.

After 1936, Shostakovich&#x27;s music became more conservative. During this time, he also composed more chamber music. While his chamber works were largely tonal, the late chamber works, which Grove&#x27;s Dictionary calls a &quot;world of purgatorial numbness&quot;, included tone rows, although he treated these thematically rather than serially. Vocal works are also a prominent feature of his late output.

=== Jewish themes ===
In the 1940s, Shostakovich began to show an interest in Jewish themes. He was intrigued by Jewish music&#x27;s &quot;ability to build a jolly melody on sad intonations&quot;. Examples of works that included Jewish themes are the Fourth String Quartet (1949), the First Violin Concerto (1948), and the &quot;Four Monologues on Pushkin Poems&quot; (1952), as well as the Piano Trio in E minor (1944). He was further inspired to write with Jewish themes when he examined Moisei Beregovski&#x27;s 1944 thesis on Jewish folk music.

In 1948, Shostakovich acquired a book of Jewish folk songs, from which he composed the song cycle &quot;From Jewish Folk Poetry&quot;. He initially wrote eight songs meant to represent the hardships of being Jewish in the Soviet Union. To disguise this, he added three more meant to demonstrate the great life Jews had under the Soviet regime. Despite his efforts to hide the real meaning in the work, the Union of Composers refused to approve his music in 1949 under the pressure of the anti-Semitism that gripped the country. &quot;From Jewish Folk Poetry&quot; could not be performed until after Stalin&#x27;s death in March 1953, along with all the other works that were forbidden.

=== Self-quotations ===
Throughout his compositions, Shostakovich demonstrated a controlled use of musical quotation. This stylistic choice had been common among earlier composers, but Shostakovich developed it into a defining characteristic of his music. Rather than quoting other composers, Shostakovich preferred to quote himself. Musicologists such as Sofia Moshevich, Ian McDonald, and Stephen Harris have connected his works through their quotations.

One example is the main theme of Katerina&#x27;s aria, &quot;Seryozha, khoroshiy moy&quot;, from the fourth act of &quot;Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District&quot;. The aria&#x27;s beauty comes as a breath of fresh air in the intense, overbearing tone of the scene, in which Katerina visits her lover Sergei in prison. The theme is made tragic when Sergei betrays her and finds a new lover upon blaming Katerina for his incarceration.

More than 25 years later, Shostakovich quoted this theme in his Eighth String Quartet. In the midst of this quartet&#x27;s oppressive and somber themes, the cello introduces the Seryozha theme &quot;in the &#x27;bright&#x27; key of F-sharp major&quot; about three minutes into the fourth movement. This theme emerges once again in his Fourteenth String Quartet. As in the Eighth Quartet, the cello introduces the theme, which here serves as a dedication to the cellist of the Beethoven String Quartet, Sergei Shirinsky.

=== Posthumous publications ===
In 2004, the musicologist Olga Digonskaya discovered a trove of Shostakovich manuscripts at the Glinka State Central Museum of Musical Culture in Moscow. In a cardboard file were some &quot;300 pages of musical sketches, pieces and scores&quot; in Shostakovich&#x27;s hand. A composer friend bribed Shostakovich&#x27;s housemaid to regularly deliver the contents of Shostakovich&#x27;s office waste bin to him, instead of taking it to the garbage. Some of those cast-offs eventually found their way into the Glinka. ... The Glinka archive &quot;contained a huge number of pieces and compositions which were completely unknown or could be traced quite indirectly,&quot; Digonskaya said.

Among these were Shostakovich&#x27;s piano and vocal sketches for a prologue to an opera, &quot;Orango&quot; (1932). They were orchestrated by the British composer Gerard McBurney and premiered in December 2011 by the Los Angeles Philharmonic conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen.

=== Reputation ===
According to McBurney, opinion is divided on whether Shostakovich&#x27;s music is &quot;of visionary power and originality, as some maintain, or, as others think, derivative, trashy, empty and second-hand&quot;. William Walton, his British contemporary, described him as &quot;the greatest composer of the 20th century&quot;. Musicologist David Fanning concludes in Grove&#x27;s Dictionary that &quot;Amid the conflicting pressures of official requirements, the mass suffering of his fellow countrymen, and his personal ideals of humanitarian and public service, he succeeded in forging a musical language of colossal emotional power.&quot;

Some modern composers have been critical. Pierre Boulez dismissed Shostakovich&#x27;s music as &quot;the second, or even third pressing of Mahler&quot;. The Romanian composer and Webern disciple Philip Gershkovich called Shostakovich &quot;a hack in a trance&quot;. A related complaint is that Shostakovich&#x27;s style is vulgar and strident: Stravinsky wrote of &quot;Lady Macbeth&quot;: &quot;brutally hammering ... and monotonous&quot;. English composer and musicologist Robin Holloway described his music as &quot;battleship-grey in melody and harmony, factory-functional in structure; in content all rhetoric and coercion&quot;.

In the 1980s, the Finnish conductor and composer Esa-Pekka Salonen was critical of Shostakovich and refused to conduct his music. For instance, he said in 1987:

Salonen has since performed and recorded several of Shostakovich&#x27;s works, including leading the world premiere of &quot;Orango&quot;, but has dismissed the Fifth Symphony as &quot;overrated&quot;, adding that he was &quot;very suspicious of heroic things in general&quot;.

Shostakovich borrows extensively from the material and styles both of earlier composers and of popular music; the vulgarity of &quot;low&quot; music is a notable influence on this &quot;greatest of eclectics&quot;. McBurney traces this to the avant-garde artistic circles of the early Soviet period in which Shostakovich moved early in his career, and argues that these borrowings were a deliberate technique to allow him to create &quot;patterns of contrast, repetition, exaggeration&quot; that gave his music large-scale structure.

== Personality ==
Shostakovich was in many ways an obsessive man: according to his daughter he was &quot;obsessed with cleanliness&quot;. He synchronised the clocks in his apartment and regularly sent himself cards to test how well the postal service was working. Elizabeth Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Shostakovich: A Life Remembered&quot; indexes 26 references to his nervousness. Mikhail Druskin remembers that even as a young man the composer was &quot;fragile and nervously agile&quot;. Yuri Lyubimov comments, &quot;The fact that he was more vulnerable and receptive than other people was no doubt an important feature of his genius.&quot; In later life, Krzysztof Meyer recalled, &quot;his face was a bag of tics and grimaces.&quot;

In Shostakovich&#x27;s lighter moods, sport was one of his main recreations, although he preferred spectating or umpiring to participating (he was a qualified football referee). His favorite football club was Zenit Leningrad (now Zenit Saint Petersburg), which he would watch regularly. He also enjoyed card games, particularly patience.

Shostakovich was fond of satirical writers such as Gogol, Chekhov and Mikhail Zoshchenko. Zoshchenko&#x27;s influence in particular is evident in his letters, which include wry parodies of Soviet officialese. Zoshchenko noted the contradictions in the composer&#x27;s character: &quot;he is ... frail, fragile, withdrawn, an infinitely direct, pure child ... [but also] hard, acid, extremely intelligent, strong perhaps, despotic and not altogether good-natured (although cerebrally good-natured).&quot;

Shostakovich was diffident by nature: Flora Litvinova has said he was &quot;completely incapable of saying &#x27;No&#x27; to anybody.&quot; This meant he was easily persuaded to sign official statements, including a denunciation of Andrei Sakharov in 1973. His widow later told that his name was included without his permission. But he was willing to try to help constituents in his capacities as chairman of the Composers&#x27; Union and Deputy to the Supreme Soviet. Oleg Prokofiev said, &quot;he tried to help so many people that ... less and less attention was paid to his pleas.&quot; When asked if he believed in God, Shostakovich said &quot;No, and I am very sorry about it.&quot;

== Orthodoxy and revisionism ==

Shostakovich&#x27;s response to official criticism and whether he used music as a kind of covert dissidence is a matter of dispute. He outwardly conformed to government policies and positions, reading speeches and putting his name to articles expressing the government line. But it is evident he disliked many aspects of the regime, as confirmed by his family, his letters to Isaac Glikman, and the satirical cantata &quot;Rayok&quot;, which ridiculed the &quot;anti-formalist&quot; campaign and was kept hidden until after his death. He was a close friend of Marshal of the Soviet Union Mikhail Tukhachevsky, who was executed in 1937 during the Great Purge.

It is also uncertain to what extent Shostakovich expressed his opposition to the state in his music. The revisionist view was put forth by Solomon Volkov in the 1979 book &quot;Testimony&quot;, which claimed to be Shostakovich&#x27;s memoirs dictated to Volkov. The book alleged that many of the composer&#x27;s works contained coded anti-government messages, placing Shostakovich in a tradition of Russian artists outwitting censorship that goes back at least to Alexander Pushkin. He incorporated many quotations and motifs in his work, most notably his musical signature DSCH. His longtime musical collaborator Yevgeny Mravinsky said, &quot;Shostakovich very often explained his intentions with very specific images and connotations.&quot;

The revisionist perspective has subsequently been supported by his children, Maxim and Galina, although Maxim said in 1981 that Volkov&#x27;s book was not his father&#x27;s work. Volkov has further argued, both in &quot;Testimony&quot; and in &quot;Shostakovich and Stalin&quot;, that Shostakovich adopted the role of the &quot;yurodivy&quot; or holy fool in his relations with the government.

Maxim Shostakovich has also commented on &quot;Testimony&quot; and Volkov more favorably since 1991, when the Soviet regime fell. To Allan B. Ho and Dmitry Feofanov, he confirmed that his father had told him about &quot;meeting a young man from Leningrad who knows his music extremely well&quot; and that &quot;Volkov did meet with Shostakovich to work on his reminiscences&quot;. Maxim has repeatedly said he is &quot;a supporter both of &quot;Testimony&quot; and of Volkov.&quot; Other prominent revisionists are Ian MacDonald, whose book &quot;The New Shostakovich&quot; put forward further revisionist interpretations of his music, and Elizabeth Wilson, whose &quot;Shostakovich: A Life Remembered&quot; provides testimony from many of the composer&#x27;s acquaintances.

Musicians and scholars including Laurel Fay and Richard Taruskin contested the authenticity and debate the significance of &quot;Testimony&quot;, alleging that Volkov compiled it from a combination of recycled articles, gossip, and possibly some information directly from the composer. Fay documents these allegations in her 2002 article &quot;Volkov&#x27;s &quot;Testimony&quot; reconsidered&quot;, showing that the only pages of the original &quot;Testimony&quot; manuscript that Shostakovich had signed and verified are word-for-word reproductions of earlier interviews he gave, none of which are controversial. Ho and Feofanov have countered that at least two of the signed pages contain controversial material: for instance, &quot;on the first page of chapter 3, where [Shostakovich] notes that the plaque that reads &#x27;In this house lived [Vsevolod] Meyerhold&#x27; should also say &#x27;And in this house his wife was brutally murdered&#x27;.&quot;

== Recorded legacy ==

In May 1958, during a visit to Paris, Shostakovich recorded his two piano concertos with André Cluytens, as well as some short piano works. These were issued on LP by EMI and later reissued on CD. Shostakovich recorded the two concertos in stereo in Moscow for Melodiya. Shostakovich also played the piano solos in recordings of the Cello Sonata, Op. 40 with cellist Daniil Shafran and also with Mstislav Rostropovich; the Violin Sonata, Op. 134, in a private recording made with violinist David Oistrakh; and the Piano Trio, Op. 67 with violinist David Oistrakh and cellist Miloš Sádlo. There is also a short newsreel of Shostakovich as soloist in a 1930s concert performance of the closing moments of his first piano concerto. A color film of Shostakovich supervising the Soviet revival of &quot;The Nose&quot; in 1974 was also made.

<doc id="8521" wikidata="Q189784" url="?curid=8521" title="Doom (1993 video game)">
<text>Doom is a 1993 first-person shooter video game developed and published by id Software for MS-DOS. It is the first installment in the &quot;Doom&quot; franchise. The player assumes the role of a space marine, later unofficially referred to as Doomguy, fighting through hordes of undead humans and invading demons. The game begins on the moons of Mars and finishes in hell, with the player traversing each level to find its exit or defeat its final boss. It is an early example of 3D graphics in video games, and has enemies and objects as 2D images, a technique sometimes referred to as 2.5D graphics.

&quot;Doom&quot; was the third major independent release by id Software, after &quot;Commander Keen&quot; (1990–1991) and &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; (1992). In May 1992, id started developing a darker game focused on fighting demons with technology, using a new 3D game engine from the lead programmer, John Carmack. The designer Tom Hall initially wrote a science fiction plot, but he and most of the story were removed from the project, with the final game featuring an action-heavy design by John Romero and Sandy Petersen. Id published &quot;Doom&quot; as a set of three episodes under the shareware model, marketing the full game by releasing the first episode free. A retail version with an additional episode was published in 1995 by GT Interactive as &quot;The Ultimate Doom&quot;.

&quot;Doom&quot; was a critical and commercial success, earning a reputation as one of the best and most influential video games of all time. It sold an estimated 3.5 million copies by 1999, and up to 20 million people are estimated to have played it within two years of launch. It has been termed the &quot;father&quot; of first-person shooters and is regarded as one of the most important games in the genre. It has been cited by video game historians as shifting the direction and public perception of the medium as a whole, as well as sparking the rise of online games and communities. It led to an array of imitators and clones, as well as a robust modding scene and the birth of speedrunning as a community. Its high level of graphic violence led to controversy from a range of groups. &quot;Doom&quot; has been ported to a variety of platforms both officially and unofficially and has been followed by several games in the series, including &quot;Doom II&quot; (1994), &quot;Doom 64&quot; (1997), &quot;Doom 3&quot; (2004), &quot;Doom&quot; (2016), &quot;Doom Eternal&quot; (2020), and &quot;&quot; (2025), as well as the films &quot;Doom&quot; (2005) and &quot;&quot; (2019).

==Gameplay==

&quot;Doom&quot; is a first-person shooter presented with 3D graphics. While the environment is shown in a 3D perspective, the enemies and objects are instead 2D sprites rendered at fixed angles, a technique sometimes referred to as 2.5D graphics or billboarding. In the single-player campaign mode, the player controls an unnamed space marine—later unofficially termed &quot;Doomguy&quot;—through military bases on the moons of Mars and in hell. To finish a level, the player must traverse through labyrinthine areas to reach a marked exit room. Levels are grouped into named episodes, with the final level of each focusing on a boss fight.

While traversing the levels, the player must fight a variety of enemies, including demons and possessed undead humans. Enemies often appear in large groups. The five difficulty levels adjust the number of enemies and amount of damage they do, with enemies moving and attacking faster than normal on the hardest difficulty setting. The monsters have simple behavior: they move toward their opponent if they see or hear them, and attack by biting, clawing, or using magic abilities such as fireballs.

The player must manage supplies of ammunition, health, and armor while traversing the levels. The player can find weapons and ammunition throughout the levels or can collect them from dead enemies, including a pistol, a shotgun, a chainsaw, a plasma rifle, and the BFG 9000. The player also encounters pits of toxic waste, ceilings that lower and crush objects, and locked doors requiring a collectable keycard or a remote switch. Power-ups include health or armor points, a mapping computer, partial invisibility, a radiation suit against toxic waste, invulnerability, or a super-strong melee berserker status. Cheat codes allow the player to unlock all weapons, walk through walls, or become invulnerable.

Two multiplayer modes are playable over a network: cooperative, in which two to four players team up to complete the main campaign, and deathmatch, in which two to four players compete to kill the other players&#x27; characters as many times as possible. Multiplayer was initially only playable over local networks, but a four-player online multiplayer mode was made available one year after launch through the DWANGO service.

==Plot==
&quot;Doom&quot; is divided into three episodes, each containing about nine levels: &quot;Knee-Deep in the Dead&quot;, &quot;The Shores of Hell&quot;, and &quot;Inferno&quot;. A fourth episode, &quot;Thy Flesh Consumed&quot;, was added in an expanded version, &quot;The Ultimate Doom&quot;, released two years after &quot;Doom&quot;. The campaign contains very few plot elements, with a minimal story presented mostly through the instruction manual and text descriptions between episodes.

In the future, an unnamed marine is posted to a dead-end assignment on Mars after assaulting a superior officer who ordered his unit to fire on civilians. The Union Aerospace Corporation, which operates radioactive waste facilities there, allows the military to conduct secret teleportation experiments that turn deadly. A base on Phobos urgently requests military support, while Deimos disappears entirely, and the marine joins a combat force to secure Phobos. He secures the perimeter as ordered while the entire response team is wiped out. With no way off the moon, and armed with only a pistol, he enters the base intent on revenge.

In &quot;Knee-Deep in the Dead&quot;, the marine fights demons and possessed humans in the military and waste facilities on Phobos. The episode ends with the marine defeating two powerful Barons of Hell guarding a teleporter to the Deimos base. After the battle, the marine passes through the teleporter and is knocked unconscious by a horde of enemies, awakening with only a pistol. In &quot;The Shores of Hell&quot;, the marine fights through corrupted research facilities on Deimos, culminating in the defeat of a gigantic cyberdemon. From an overlook, he discovers that the moon is floating above hell and rappels down to the surface. In &quot;Inferno&quot;, the marine battles through hell itself and destroys a cybernetic spider-demon that masterminded the invasion of the moons. When a portal to Earth opens, the marine steps through to discover that Earth has been invaded. &quot;Thy Flesh Consumed&quot; follows the marine&#x27;s initial assault on the Earth invaders, setting the stage for &quot;Doom II&quot;.

==Development==
===Concept===

Id Software released &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; in May 1992. Later called the &quot;grandfather of 3D shooters&quot;, it established the genre&#x27;s popularity and its reputation for fast action and technological advancement. When most of the studio began work on additional episodes for &quot;Wolfenstein&quot;, id co-founder and lead programmer John Carmack instead began technical research on a new game. Following the release of &quot;Wolfenstein 3D: Spear of Destiny&quot; in September 1992, the team began to plan their next game. They were tired of &quot;Wolfenstein&quot; and wanted to create another 3D game using a new engine Carmack was developing. Co-founder and lead designer Tom Hall proposed a new game in the &quot;Commander Keen&quot; series, but the team decided that the &quot;Keen&quot; platforming gameplay was a poor fit for Carmack&#x27;s fast-paced 3D engines. Additionally, the other co-founders, designer John Romero and lead artist Adrian Carmack (no relation to John Carmack) wanted to create something in a darker style than the &quot;Keen&quot; games. 

John Carmack conceived a game about using technology to fight demons, inspired by a &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; campaign the team played. This campaign would also influence the design of &quot;Quake&quot; (1996) and &quot;Daikatana&quot; (2000). More broadly the team intended to combine the styles of the &quot;Evil Dead II&quot; and &quot;Aliens&quot; films. The working title was &quot;Green and Pissed&quot;, but Carmack renamed it &quot;Doom&quot; based on a line from the 1986 film &quot;The Color of Money&quot;: What you got in there?&#x27; / &#x27;In here? Doom.

The team agreed to pursue the &quot;Doom&quot; concept, and development began in November 1992. The initial development team was composed of five people: programmers John Carmack and Romero, artists Adrian Carmack and Kevin Cloud, and designer Hall. They moved operations to a dark office building, naming it &quot;Suite 666&quot; while drawing inspiration from the noises they heard from a neighboring dental practice. They also decided to cut ties with Apogee Software, their previous publisher, and self-publish &quot;Doom&quot;, as they felt that they were outgrowing the publisher and could make more money by self-publishing.

===Design===

In November, Hall delivered a design document that he called the &quot;Doom Bible&quot;, detailing the project&#x27;s plot, backstory, and design goals. His design was a science fiction horror concept wherein scientists on the Moon open a portal to an alien invasion. Over a series of levels, the player discovers that the aliens are demons while hell steadily infects the level design. John Carmack not only disliked the proposed story but dismissed the idea of having a story at all: &quot;Story in a game is like story in a porn movie; it&#x27;s expected to be there, but it&#x27;s not that important.&quot; Rather than a deep story, he wanted to focus on technological innovation, dropping the levels and episodes of &quot;Wolfenstein&quot; in favor of a fast, continuous world. Hall disliked the idea, but the rest of the team sided with Carmack. Hall spent the next few weeks reworking the &quot;Doom Bible&quot; to work with Carmack&#x27;s technological ideas. However, the team then realized that Carmack&#x27;s vision for a seamless world would be impossible given the hardware limitations, and Hall was forced to rework the design document once again.

At the start of 1993, id put out a press release, touting Hall&#x27;s story about fighting off demons while &quot;knee-deep in the dead&quot;. The press release proclaimed the new 3D engine features that John Carmack had created, as well as aspects including multiplayer, that had not yet even been designed. Early versions were built to match the &quot;Doom Bible&quot;, and a &quot;pre-alpha&quot; version of the first level included Hall&#x27;s introductory base scene. Initial versions also retained &quot;Wolfenstein&quot;″s arcade-style scoring, but this was later removed as it clashed with &quot;Doom&quot;″s intended tone. The studio also experimented with other game systems before removing them, such as lives, an inventory, a secondary shield, and a complex user interface.
Soon, however, the &quot;Doom Bible&quot; as a whole was rejected. Romero wanted a game even &quot;more brutal and fast&quot; than &quot;Wolfenstein&quot;, which did not leave room for the character-driven plot Hall had created. Additionally, the team believed it emphasized realism over entertaining gameplay, and they did not see the need for a design document at all. Some ideas were retained, but the story was dropped and most of the design was removed. By early 1993, Hall created levels that became part of an internal demo. Carmack and Romero, however, rejected the military architecture of Hall&#x27;s level design. Romero especially believed that the boxy, flat level designs failed to innovate on &quot;Wolfenstein&quot;, and failed to show off the engine&#x27;s capabilities. He began to create his own, more abstract levels, which the rest of the team saw as a great improvement.

Hall was upset with the reception of his designs and how little impact he was having as the lead designer. He was also upset with how much he was having to fight with John Carmack to get what he saw as obvious gameplay improvements, such as flying enemies, and began to spend less time at work. The other developers, however, felt that Hall was not in sync with the team&#x27;s vision and was becoming a problem. In July the other founders of id fired Hall, who went to work for Apogee. He was replaced by Sandy Petersen in September, ten weeks before the game was released. Petersen later recalled that John Carmack and Romero wanted to hire other artists instead, but Cloud and Adrian disagreed, saying that a designer was required to help build a cohesive gameplay experience. The team also added a third programmer, Dave Taylor.

Petersen and Romero designed the rest of &quot;Doom&quot; levels, with different aims: the team believed that Petersen&#x27;s designs were more technically interesting and varied, while Romero&#x27;s were more aesthetically interesting. In late 1993, a month before release, John Carmack began to add multiplayer. After the multiplayer component was coded, the development team began playing four-player games, which Romero termed &quot;deathmatch&quot;, and Cloud named the act of killing other players &quot;fragging&quot;. According to Romero, the deathmatch mode was inspired by fighting games such as &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, &quot;Fatal Fury&quot;, and &quot;Art of Fighting&quot;.

===Engine===

&quot;Doom&quot; was written largely in the C programming language, with a few elements in assembly language. The developers used NeXT computers running the NeXTSTEP operating system. The level and graphical data was stored in WAD files, short for &quot;Where&#x27;s All the Data?&quot;, separately from the engine. This allowed for any part of the design to be changed without needing to adjust the engine code. Carmack designed this system so that fans could easily modify the game; he had been impressed by the modifications made by fans of &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; and wanted to support that by releasing a map editor with an easily swappable file structure.

Unlike &quot;Wolfenstein&quot;, which has flat levels with walls at right angles, the &quot;Doom&quot; engine allows for walls and floors at any angle or height but does not allow areas to be stacked vertically. The lighting system is based on adjusting the color palette of surfaces directly. Rather than calculating how light traveled from light sources to surfaces using ray tracing, the game calculates the &quot;light level&quot; of a small area based on the predetermined brightness of said area. It then modifies the color palette of that section&#x27;s surface textures to mimic how dark it would look. This same system is used to cause far away surfaces to look darker than close ones.

Romero came up with new ways to use Carmack&#x27;s lighting engine, such as strobe lights. He programmed engine features such as switches and movable stairs and platforms. After Romero&#x27;s complex level designs started to cause problems with the engine, Carmack began to use binary space partitioning to quickly select the reduced portion of a level that the player could see at a given time. Taylor, along with programming other features, added cheat codes to aid in development and left them in for players.

===Art direction===
Adrian Carmack was the lead artist for &quot;Doom&quot;, with Kevin Cloud as an additional artist. They designed the monsters to be &quot;nightmarish&quot;, with graphics that were realistic and dark instead of staged or rendered. A mixed media approach was taken to create them. The artists sculpted models of some of the enemies and took pictures of them in stop motion from five to eight different angles so that they could be rotated realistically in-game. The images were then digitized and converted to 2D characters with a program written by John Carmack. Adrian Carmack made clay models for a few demons and had Gregor Punchatz build latex and metal sculptures of the others. The weapons were made from combined parts of children&#x27;s toys. The developers photographed themselves as well, using Cloud&#x27;s arm for the marine&#x27;s arm holding a gun, and Adrian&#x27;s snakeskin boots and wounded knee for textures. The cover art was created by Don Ivan Punchatz, Gregor Punchatz&#x27;s father, who worked from a short description of the game rather than detailed references. Romero was the body model used for cover; he posed during a photoshoot to demonstrate to the intended model what the pose should look like, and Punchatz used his photo.

As with &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot;, id hired composer Bobby Prince to create the music and sound effects. Romero directed Prince to make the music in techno and metal styles. Many tracks were directly inspired by songs by metal bands such as Alice in Chains and Pantera. Prince believed that ambient music would be more appropriate and produced numerous tracks in both styles in hope of convincing the team, and Romero incorporated both. Prince did not make music for specific levels, as they were composed before the levels were completed. Instead, Romero assigned each track to each level late in development. Prince created the sound effects based on short descriptions or concept art of a monster or weapon and adjusted them to match the completed animations. The monster sounds were created from animal noises, and Prince designed all the sounds to be distinct on the limited sound hardware of the time, even when many sounds were playing at once. He also designed the sound effects to play on different frequencies from those used for the MIDI music, so they would clearly cut through the music.

==Release==
Id Software planned to self-publish &quot;Doom&quot; for DOS-based computers and set up a distribution system leading up to the release. Jay Wilbur, who had been hired as CEO and sole member of the business team, planned the marketing and distribution of &quot;Doom&quot;. As id would make the most money from copies they sold directly to customers—up to 85% of the planned price—he decided to leverage the shareware market as much as possible. He believed that the mainstream press was uninterested in the game and bought only a single ad in any gaming magazine. Instead, he gave software retailers the option to sell copies of the first &quot;Doom&quot; episode at any price, in hopes of motivating customers to buy the full game directly from id.

The team planned to release &quot;Doom&quot; in the third quarter of 1993 but ultimately needed more time. By December 1993, the team was working non-stop, with several employees sleeping at the office. Taylor said that the work gave him such a rush that he would pass out from the intensity. Id only gave a single press preview, to &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; in June, to a glowing response, but had also released development updates to the public continuously throughout development on the nascent internet. Id began receiving calls from people interested in the game or angry that it had missed its planned release date, as anticipation built over the year. At midnight on December 10, 1993, after working for 30 straight hours testing, the development team at id uploaded the first episode to the internet, letting interested players distribute it for them. The team was unable to connect to the FTP server at the University of Wisconsin–Madison where they planned to upload the game, since there were so many users already connected in anticipation of the release. The network administrator was forced to first increase the number of connections, and then kick off all users to make room. When the upload finished 30 minutes later, 10,000 people attempted to download the game at once, crashing the university&#x27;s network.

Within hours of &quot;Doom&quot;″s release, university networks began banning &quot;Doom&quot; multiplayer games, as a rush of players overwhelmed their systems. The morning after release, John Carmack quickly released a patch in response to complaints of network congestion from administrators, who still needed to implement &quot;Doom&quot;-specific rules to keep their networks from crashing from the load.

===Ports===
In 1995, id created an expanded version of &quot;Doom&quot; for the retail market with a fourth episode of levels, which was published by GT Interactive as &quot;The Ultimate Doom&quot;. &quot;Doom&quot; has also been ported to numerous different platforms, independent from id Software. The first port of &quot;Doom&quot; was an unofficial port to Linux, released by id programmer Dave Taylor in 1994; it was hosted by id but not supported or made official. Microsoft attempted to hire id to port &quot;Doom&quot; to Windows in 1995 to promote Windows as a gaming platform, and Microsoft CEO Bill Gates briefly considered buying the company. When id declined, Microsoft made its own licensed port, with a team led by Gabe Newell. One promotional video for Windows 95 had Gates digitally superimposed into the game.

Other official ports of &quot;Doom&quot; were released for the 32X and Atari Jaguar in 1994, SNES and PlayStation in 1995, 3DO in 1996, Sega Saturn in 1997, Acorn Risc PC in 1998, Game Boy Advance in 2001, Xbox 360 in 2006, iOS in 2009, and Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Android in 2019, with the latter-most platforms (excluding Android) receiving a further expanded port alongside &quot;Doom II&quot; in 2024 along with ports for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. Some of these became bestsellers even many years after the initial release. The ports did not all have the same content, with some having fewer levels, such as the 32X port created by John Carmack, which was released with only two-thirds of the game&#x27;s levels in order to meet the console&#x27;s launch date, while the PlayStation port includes &quot;The Ultimate Doom&quot; and &quot;Doom II&quot;.

The source code for &quot;Doom&quot; was released under a non-commercial license in 1997, and freely released under the GNU General Public License in 1999. Due to the release of its source code, &quot;Doom&quot; has been unofficially ported to numerous platforms. These ports include esoteric devices such as smart thermostats, pianos, and &quot;Doom&quot; itself, which led to variations of a long-running meme, &quot;Can it run &quot;Doom&quot;?&quot; and &quot;It runs &quot;Doom&quot;&quot;.

==Reception==
===Sales===
Upon its release in December 1993, &quot;Doom&quot; became an &quot;overnight phenomenon&quot;. It was an immediate financial success for id, making a profit within a day after release. Although the company estimated that only 1% of shareware downloaders bought the full game, this was enough to generate initial daily revenue of , selling in one day what &quot;Wolfenstein&quot; had sold in one month. By May 1994, Wilbur said that the game had sold over 65,000 copies, and estimated that the shareware version had been distributed over 1 million times. In 1995, Wilbur estimated the first-year sales as 140,000, while in 2002 Petersen said it had sold around 200,000 copies in its first year.

By late 1995, &quot;Doom&quot; was estimated to be installed on more computers worldwide than Microsoft&#x27;s new operating system, Windows 95. According to PC Data, by April 1998 &quot;Doom&quot;″s shareware edition had yielded 1.36 million units sold and in revenue in the United States. This led PC Data to declare it the country&#x27;s 4th-best-selling computer game since 1993. &quot;The Ultimate Doom&quot; sold over 780,000 units by September 1999, and all versions combined sold 3.5 million copies by the end of 1999. In addition to sales, an estimated six million people played the shareware version by 2002; other sources estimated in 2000 that 10–20 million people played &quot;Doom&quot; within 24 months of its launch.

===Reviews===
&quot;Doom&quot; was highly praised in contemporaneous reviews. In April 1994, a few months after release, &quot;PC Gamer UK&quot; named it the third-best computer game of all time, claiming &quot;&quot;Doom&quot; has already done more to establish the PC&#x27;s arcade clout than any other title in gaming history,&quot; and &quot;PC Gamer US&quot; named it the best computer game of all time that August. It won the Best Action Adventure award at &quot;Cybermania &#x27;94&quot;. &quot;GamesRadar UK&quot; named &quot;Doom&quot; Game of the Year in 1993 shortly after release, and &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; and &quot;PC Gamer UK&quot; did the same the year after.

Reviewers heavily praised the single-player gameplay: &quot;Electronic Entertainment&quot; called it &quot;a skull-banging, palm-sweating, blood-pounding game&quot;, while &quot;The Age&quot; said it was &quot;a technically superb and thrilling 3D adventure&quot;. &quot;White Wolf&quot;″s reviewer found it addictive, missing sleep and appointments to continue playing. &quot;PC Zone&quot; called it the best arcade game ever, and it and &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; praised the variety of monsters and weapons. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; concluded that it was &quot;a virtuoso performance&quot;. Other reviewers, while also praising the gameplay, commented on the lack of complexity: &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; found it captivating and praised the variety and complexity of the level design, but called the overall gameplay repetitive, while &quot;Dragon&quot; similarly praised the fast gameplay and level design, but said that overall it lacked depth. &quot;Edge&quot; praised the graphics and levels but criticized the straightforward shooting gameplay. The review concluded: &quot;If only you could talk to these creatures, then perhaps you could try and make friends with them, form alliances... Now, that would be interesting.&quot; The review attracted mockery and &quot;if only you could talk to these creatures&quot; became a running joke in video game culture. The multiplayer gameplay was praised: &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; called it &quot;the most intense gaming experience available&quot;, and &quot;Dragon&quot; called it &quot;the biggest adrenaline rush available on computers&quot;. &quot;PC Zone&quot; named it as the best multiplayer game available, in addition to the best arcade game.

The 3D graphics and art style were praised by reviewers; &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; called the graphics remarkable, while &quot;Edge&quot; said that it &quot;made serious advances in what people will expect of 3D graphics in future&quot;, surpassing not only prior games but games that had yet to be released. &quot;Compute!&quot; and &quot;Electronic Games&quot; similarly called the graphics excellent and unlike any other game&#x27;s. &quot;PC Zone&quot;, &quot;Dragon&quot;, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;, and &quot;Electronic Entertainment&quot; all praised the atmosphere and art direction, saying that the level design, lighting effects, and sound effects combined to create a &quot;claustrophobic&quot; and &quot;nightmarish experience&quot;. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; also praised the music, as did &quot;The Mercury News&quot;, which called it as &quot;ominous as the scenario&quot;.

===Other versions===
&quot;The Ultimate Doom&quot; received mixed reviews upon its release in 1995, as in the review from &quot;PC Zone&quot;, which gave it a score of 90/100 for new players but 20/100 for anyone who had the original game. The reviewer viewed it as solely a level pack due to the lack of new features and compared it negatively to the hundreds of free fan-made levels available on the internet. &quot;Joystick&quot; disliked the limited amount of additional content and recommended it only to major fans or those who had not played it. &quot;Fusion&quot; reviewed the edition positively, praising the difficulty of the new levels, as did &quot;GameSpot&quot;, which reviewed it from the perspective of introducing the game to new players.

The first ports of &quot;Doom&quot; received comparable reviews to the original PC version. &quot;VideoGames&quot;, &quot;GamePro&quot;, and &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; all gave the Jaguar version high scores, comparing it favorably with the PC version. &quot;GamePro&quot; and &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; also rated the 32X version highly, though they noted that the graphics were worse and the game shorter than the PC or Jaguar versions. The 1995 ports received mixed reviews. The PlayStation version was rated highly by &quot;HobbyConsolas&quot;, &quot;GamePro&quot;, and &quot;Maximum&quot;, which praised the inclusion of &quot;Doom II&quot; and extra levels, and favorably compared it to other PlayStation shooter games. The SNES version, however, was noted for weaker graphics and unresponsive controls, though reviewers such as &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot;, &quot;GamePro&quot;, and &quot;Next Generation&quot; were split on awarding high or middling scores due to these faults. Later 1990s ports received worse reviews; the 3DO port was panned by &quot;GamePro&quot; and &quot;Maximum&quot; for having worse graphics, a smaller screen size, and less intelligent enemies than any previous version, and the Sega Saturn port also met with low reviews for poor graphics and low quality from &quot;Mean Machines&quot; and &quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot;.

==Legacy==
&quot;Doom&quot; has been termed &quot;inarguably the most important&quot; first-person shooter, as well as the &quot;father&quot; of the genre. Although not the first in the genre, it was the game with the greatest impact. Dan Pinchbeck in &quot;Doom: Scarydarkfast&quot; (2013) noted the direct influence of &quot;Doom&quot;″s design choices on those of first-person and third-person shooter games two decades later, as influenced by the games released in the intervening years.

&quot;Doom&quot;, and to a lesser extent &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot;, has been characterized as &quot;mark[ing] a turning point&quot; in the perception of video games in popular culture, with &quot;Doom&quot; and first-person shooters in general becoming the predominant perception of video games in media. Historians such as Tristan Donovan in &quot;&quot; (2010) have termed it as causing a &quot;paradigm shift&quot;, prompting the rise in popularity of 3D games, first-person shooters, licensed technology between developers, and support for game modifications. It helped spark the rise of both online multiplayer games and player-driven content generation, and popularized the business model of online distribution. In their book &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dreamers: A Story of how Computer Games Created a Global Community&quot; in 2014, Brad King and John Borland claimed that &quot;Doom&quot; was one of the first widespread instances of an &quot;online collective virtual reality&quot;, and did more than any other game to create a modern world of &quot;networked games and gamers&quot;. &quot;PC Gamer&quot; proclaimed &quot;Doom&quot; the most influential game of all time in 2004, and in 2023 said its development was one of the most well-documented in the history of video games.

It has also been used in scholarly research since its release, including for machine learning, video game aesthetics and design, and the effects of video games on aggression, memory, and attention. In 2007 &quot;Doom&quot; was listed among the ten &quot;game canon&quot; video games selected for preservation by the Library of Congress, and in 2015 The Strong National Museum of Play inducted &quot;Doom&quot; to its World Video Game Hall of Fame as part of its initial set of games.

&quot;Doom&quot; has continued to be included highly in lists of the best video games ever for nearly three decades since its release. In 1995, &quot;Next Generation&quot; said it was &quot;the most talked about PC game ever&quot;. The PC version was ranked the 3rd best video game by &quot;Flux&quot; in 1995, and in 1996 was ranked fifth best and third most innovative by &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;. In 2000, &quot;Doom&quot; was ranked as the second-best game ever by &quot;GameSpot&quot;. The following year, it was voted the number one game of all time in a poll among over 100 game developers and journalists conducted by &quot;GameSpy&quot;, and was ranked the sixth best game by &quot;Game Informer&quot;. GameTrailers ranked it the most &quot;breakthrough PC game&quot; in 2009 and &quot;Game Informer&quot; again ranked it the sixth-best game that same year. &quot;Doom&quot; has also been ranked among the best games of all time by &quot;GamesMaster&quot;, &quot;Hyper&quot;, &quot;The Independent&quot;, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, &quot;GamesTM&quot;, &quot;Jeuxvideo.com&quot;, &quot;Gamereactor&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Polygon&quot;, and &quot;The Times&quot;, among others, as recently as 2023.

===Clones===
The success of &quot;Doom&quot; led to dozens of new first-person shooter games. In 1998, &quot;PC Gamer&quot; declared it &quot;probably the most imitated game of all time&quot;. These games were often referred to as &quot;&quot;Doom&quot; clones&quot;, with &quot;first-person shooter&quot; only overtaking it as the name of the genre after a few years. As the &quot;first-person shooter&quot; genre label had not yet solidified at the time, &quot;Doom&quot; was described as a &quot;first person perspective adventure&quot; and &quot;atmospheric 3-D action game&quot;.

&quot;Doom&quot; clones ranged from close imitators to more innovative takes on the genre. Id Software licensed the &quot;Doom&quot; engine to several other companies, which resulted in several games similar to &quot;Doom&quot;, including &quot;Heretic&quot; (1994), &quot;&quot; (1995), and &quot;&quot; (1996). A &quot;Doom&quot;-based game called &quot;Chex Quest&quot; was released in 1996 by Ralston Foods as a promotion to increase cereal sales. Other games were inspired by &quot;Doom&quot;, if not rumored to be built by reverse engineering the game&#x27;s engine, including LucasArts&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars: Dark Forces&quot; (1995). Several other games termed &quot;Doom&quot; clones, such as &quot;PowerSlave&quot; (1996) and &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot; (1996), used the 1995 Build engine, a 2.5D engine inspired by &quot;Doom&quot; created by Ken Silverman with some consultation with John Carmack.

===Sequel and franchise===

After completing &quot;Doom&quot;, id Software began working on a sequel using the same engine, &quot;Doom II&quot;, which was released to retail on October 10, 1994, ten months after the first game. GT Interactive had approached id before the release of &quot;Doom&quot; with plans to release a retail version of &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;Doom II&quot;. Id chose to create the sequel as a set of episodes rather than a new game, allowing John Carmack and the other programmers to begin work on id&#x27;s next game, &quot;Quake&quot;. &quot;Doom II&quot; was the United States&#x27; highest-selling software product of 1994 and sold more than copies within a year.

&quot;Doom II&quot; was followed by an expansion pack from id, &quot;Master Levels for Doom II&quot; (1995), consisting of 21 commissioned levels and over 3000 user-created levels for &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;Doom II&quot;. Two sets of &quot;Doom II&quot; levels by different amateur map-making teams were released together by id as the standalone game &quot;Final Doom&quot; (1996). &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;Doom II&quot; were both included, along with previous id games, in the &quot;id Anthology&quot; compilation (1996). The &quot;Doom&quot; franchise has continued since the 1990s in several iterations and forms. The video game series includes &quot;Doom 3&quot; (2004), &quot;Doom&quot; (2016), and &quot;Doom Eternal&quot; (2020), along with other spin-off video games. It additionally includes multiple novels, a comic book, board games, and two films: &quot;Doom&quot; (2005) and &quot;&quot; (2019).

===Controversies===
&quot;Doom&quot; was notorious for its high levels of graphic violence and satanic imagery, which generated controversy from a broad range of groups. &quot;Doom&quot; for the 32X was one of the first video games to be given a Mature 17+ rating from the Entertainment Software Rating Board due to its violent gore and nature, while &quot;Doom II&quot; was the first. In Germany, shortly after its publication, &quot;Doom&quot; was classified as &quot;harmful to minors&quot; by the Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons and could not be sold to children or displayed where they could see it, which was only rescinded in 2011.

&quot;Doom&quot; again sparked controversy in the United States when it was found that Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, who committed the Columbine High School massacre on April 20, 1999, were avid players. While planning for the massacre, Harris said in his journal that the killing would be &quot;like playing &quot;Doom&quot;&quot;. A rumor spread afterward that Harris had designed a custom &quot;Doom&quot; level that looked like the high school, populated with representations of Harris&#x27;s classmates and teachers, which he used to practice for the shooting. Although Harris did design several custom &quot;Doom&quot; levels, which later became known as the &quot;Harris levels&quot;, none were based on the school. &quot;Doom&quot; was dubbed a &quot;mass murder simulator&quot; by critic and Killology Research Group founder David Grossman.

In the earliest release versions, the level E1M4: Command Control contains a swastika-shaped structure, which was put in as a homage to &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot;. The swastika was removed in later versions, out of respect for a military veteran&#x27;s request, according to Romero.

===Community===

&quot;Doom&quot;″s popularity and innovations attracted a community that has persisted for decades since. The deathmatch mode was an important factor in its popularity. &quot;Doom&quot; was the first game to coin the term &quot;deathmatch&quot; and introduced multiplayer shooting battles to a wide audience. This led to a widespread community of players who had never experienced fast-paced multiplayer combat before.

Another popular aspect of &quot;Doom&quot; was the versatility of its WAD files, enabling user-generated levels and other game modifications. John Carmack and Romero had strongly advocated for mod support, overriding other id employees who were concerned about commercial and legal implications. Although WAD files exposed the game data, id provided no instructions for how they worked. Still, players were able to modify leaked alpha versions of the game, allowing them to release level editors within weeks of the game&#x27;s release.

On January 26, 1994, university student Brendon Wyber led a group to create the first full level editor, the Doom Editor Utility, leading to the first custom level by Jeff Bird in March. It was followed by &quot;countless&quot; others, including many based on other franchises like &quot;Aliens&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot; total conversion mods, as well as DeHackEd, a patch editor first released in 1994 by Greg Lewis that allowed editing of the game engine. Soon after the first mods appeared, id CEO Wilbur posted legal terms to the company&#x27;s website, allowing mod authors to charge money without any fees to id, while also absolving the company of responsibility or support.

&quot;Doom&quot; mods were widely popular, earning favorable comparisons to the official level additions seen in &quot;The Ultimate Doom&quot;. Thousands of user-created levels were released in the first few years after the release; over 3000 such levels for &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;Doom II&quot; were included in the official retail release &quot;Master Levels for Doom II&quot; (1995). WizardWorks released multiple collections of mods of &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;Doom II&quot; under the name &quot;D!Zone&quot;. At least one mod creator, Tim Willits, was later hired at id Software. Mods have continued to be produced, with the community Cacowards awarding the best of each year. In 2016, Romero created two new &quot;Doom&quot; levels: E1M4b (&quot;Phobos Mission Control&quot;) and E1M8b (&quot;Tech Gone Bad&quot;). In 2018, for the 25th anniversary of &quot;Doom&quot;, Romero announced &quot;Sigil&quot;, an unofficial fifth episode containing nine levels. It was released on May 22, 2019, for with a soundtrack by Buckethead, and then released again for free on May 31 with a soundtrack by James Paddock. A physical release was later produced. A sixth episode, &quot;Sigil II&quot;, was released on the game&#x27;s 30th anniversary, December 10, 2023, again for for a digital copy with a soundtrack by Valient Thorr, as well as physical editions on floppy disk.

In addition to WAD files, &quot;Doom&quot; includes a feature that allowed players to record and play back gameplay using files called demos, or game replays. Although the concept of speedrunning a video game existed before &quot;Doom&quot;, its release coincided with a wave of popularity for speedrunning, amplified by the online communities built on the nascent Internet. Demos were lightweight files that could be shared more easily than video files on internet bulletin board systems at the time. As a result, &quot;Doom&quot; is credited with creating the video game speedrunning community. The speedrunning community for &quot;Doom&quot; has continued for decades. As recently as 2019, community members have broken records originally set in 1998. &quot;Doom&quot; has been termed as having &quot;one of the longest-running speedrunning communities&quot; as well as being &quot;the quintessential speedrunning game&quot;.

<text>Denver ( ) is a consolidated city and county, the capital and most populous city of the U.S. state of Colorado. It is located in the Western United States, in the South Platte River Valley on the western edge of the High Plains east of the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains. With a population of 715,522 as of the 2020 census, a 19.22% increase since 2010, Denver is the 19th most populous city in the United States and the fifth most populous state capital. It is the principal city of the Denver–Aurora–Lakewood metropolitan statistical area, with almost 3 million people, the most populous metropolitan area in Colorado. Denver is the economic and cultural center of the broader Front Range Urban Corridor, home to more than 5 million people.

Denver&#x27;s downtown district lies about east of the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. Named after James W. Denver, the governor of the Kansas Territory at the time, Denver was founded at the confluence of Cherry Creek and the South Platte River in 1858 during the Gold Rush era. Nicknamed the &quot;Mile High City&quot; because its official elevation is exactly one mile () above sea level, Denver grew beyond its prospecting origins to become the principal commercial and transportation hub for a broad region spanning the Great Plains and Rocky Mountain West. The 105th meridian west of Greenwich, the longitudinal reference for the Mountain Time Zone, passes directly through Denver Union Station.
As the most populous metropolitan area in a radius, Denver is a major cultural hub with a variety of museums and cultural institutions, including the Denver Performing Arts Complex and Denver Art Museum. Denver also has sports teams in all five major professional leagues. While the 10-county Denver–Aurora–Lakewood, CO Metropolitan Statistical Area had a population of 2,963,821 and the 12-county Denver–Aurora, CO Combined Statistical Area had a population of 3,623,560 at the 2020 United States census, Denver functions as the principal city of the 18-county Front Range Urban Corridor, an oblong urban region stretching across Colorado and Wyoming with a population of 5,055,344 at the 2020 U.S. census. Regarded for its sunny weather and access to nature, Denver was named the best place to live in the United States by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; in 2016.

==History==


The greater Denver area was inhabited by several Indigenous peoples such as Apaches, Utes, Cheyennes, Comanches, and Arapahoes. By the terms of the 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie between the United States and various tribes including the Cheyenne and Arapaho, the United States unilaterally defined and recognized Cheyenne and Arapaho territory as ranging from the North Platte River in present-day Wyoming and Nebraska southward to the Arkansas River in present-day Colorado and Kansas. This definition specifically encompasses the land of modern Metropolitan Denver. But the discovery in November 1858 of gold in the Rocky Mountains in Colorado (then part of the western Kansas Territory) brought on a gold rush and a consequent flood of white immigration across Cheyenne and Arapaho lands. Colorado territorial officials pressured federal authorities to redefine and reduce the extent of Indian treaty lands.

In the summer of 1858, during the Pike&#x27;s Peak Gold Rush, a group of gold prospectors from Lawrence, Kansas, established Montana City as a mining town on the banks of the South Platte River in what was then western Kansas Territory, on traditional lands of Cheyenne and Arapaho. This was the first historical settlement in what later became the city of Denver. But the site faded quickly, and by the summer of 1859 it was abandoned in favor of Auraria (named after the gold-mining town of Auraria, Georgia) and St. Charles City.

On November 22, 1858, General William Larimer and Captain Jonathan Cox, both land speculators from eastern Kansas Territory, placed cottonwood logs to stake a claim on the bluff overlooking the confluence of the South Platte River and Cherry Creek, across the creek from the existing mining settlement of Auraria, and on the site of the existing townsite of St. Charles. Larimer named the townsite Denver City to curry favor with Kansas Territorial Governor James W. Denver. Larimer hoped the town&#x27;s name would help it be selected as the county seat of Arapahoe County, but unbeknownst to him, Governor Denver had already resigned from office. The location was accessible to existing trails and was across the South Platte River from the site of seasonal encampments of the Cheyenne and Arapaho. The site of these first towns is now occupied by Confluence Park near downtown Denver. Edward W. Wynkoop came to Colorado in 1859 and became one of the city&#x27;s founders. Wynkoop Street in Denver is named after him.

Larimer, along with associates in the St. Charles City Land Company, sold parcels in the town to merchants and miners, with the intention of creating a major city that would cater to new immigrants. Denver City was a frontier town, with an economy based on servicing local miners with gambling, saloons, livestock, and goods trading. In the early years, land parcels were often traded for grubstakes or gambled away by miners in Auraria. In May 1859, Denver City residents donated 53 lots to the Leavenworth &amp; Pike&#x27;s Peak Express in order to secure the region&#x27;s first overland wagon route. Offering daily service for &quot;passengers, mail, freight, and gold&quot;, the Express reached Denver on a trail that trimmed westward travel time from twelve days to six. In 1863, Western Union furthered Denver&#x27;s dominance of the region by choosing the city for its regional terminus.

On February 18, 1861, six chiefs of the Southern Cheyenne and four of the Arapaho signed the Treaty of Fort Wise with the United States at Bent&#x27;s New Fort at Big Timbers near what is now Lamar, Colorado. They ceded more than 90 percent of the lands designated for them by the Fort Laramie Treaty, including the area of modern Denver. Some Cheyennes opposed to the treaty, saying that it had been signed by a small minority of the chiefs without the consent or approval of the rest of the tribe, that the signatories had not understood what they signed, and that they had been bribed to sign by a large distribution of gifts. The territorial government of Colorado, however, claimed the treaty was a &quot;solemn obligation&quot; and considered that those Indians who refused to abide by it were hostile and planning a war.

Ten days later, on February 28, 1861, the Colorado Territory was created, Arapahoe County was formed on November 1, 1861, and Denver City was incorporated on November 7, 1861. Denver City served as the Arapahoe County Seat from 1861 until consolidation in 1902. In 1867, Denver City became the acting territorial capital, and in 1881 was chosen as the permanent state capital in a statewide ballot. With its newfound importance, Denver City shortened its name to Denver. On August 1, 1876, Colorado was admitted to the Union.

This disagreement on the validity of Treaty of Fort Wise escalated to bring about the Colorado War of 1864 and 1865, during which the brutal Sand Creek massacre against Cheyenne and Arapaho peoples occurred. The aftermath of the war was the dissolution of the reservation in Eastern Colorado, the signing of Medicine Lodge Treaty which stipulated that the Cheyenne and Arapaho peoples would be relocated outside of their traditional territory. This treaty term was achieved, even though the treaty was not legally ratified by the tribal members, as per the treaty&#x27;s own terms. Thus, by the end of 1860s, this effectively and completely cleared the Denver area of its indigenous inhabitants.

Although by the close of the 1860s Denver residents could look with pride at their success establishing a vibrant supply and service center, the decision to route the nation&#x27;s first transcontinental railroad through Cheyenne City, rather than Denver, threatened the prosperity of the young town. The transcontinental railroad passed a daunting away, but citizens mobilized to build a railroad to connect Denver to it. Spearheaded by visionary leaders, including Territorial Governor John Evans, David Moffat, and Walter Cheesman, fundraising began. Within three days, $300,000 had been raised, and citizens were optimistic. Fundraising stalled before enough was raised, forcing these visionary leaders to take control of the debt-ridden railroad. Despite challenges, on June 24, 1870, citizens cheered as the Denver Pacific completed the link to the transcontinental railroad, ushering in a new age of prosperity for Denver.

Finally linked to the rest of the nation by rail, Denver prospered as a service and supply center. The young city grew during these years, attracting millionaires with their mansions, as well as a mixture of crime and poverty of a rapidly growing city. Denver citizens were proud when the rich chose Denver and were thrilled when Horace Tabor, the Leadville mining millionaire, built a business block at 16th and Larimer, as well as the elegant Tabor Grand Opera House. Luxurious hotels, including the much-loved Brown Palace Hotel, soon followed, as well as splendid homes for millionaires, such as the Croke, Patterson, Campbell Mansion at 11th and Pennsylvania and the now-demolished Moffat Mansion at 8th and Grant. Intent on transforming Denver into one of the world&#x27;s great cities, leaders wooed industry and attracted laborers to work in these factories.

Soon, in addition to the elite and a large middle class, Denver had a growing population of immigrant German, Italian, and Chinese laborers, soon followed by African Americans from the Deep South and Hispanic workers. The influx of the new residents strained available housing. In addition, the Silver Crash of 1893 unsettled political, social, and economic balances. Competition among the different ethnic groups was often expressed as bigotry, and social tensions gave rise to the Red Scare. Americans were suspicious of immigrants, who were sometimes allied with socialist and labor union causes. After World War I, a revival of the Ku Klux Klan attracted white, native-born Americans who were anxious about the many changes in society. Unlike the earlier organization that was active in the rural South, KKK chapters developed in urban areas of the Midwest and West, including Denver, and into Idaho and Oregon. Corruption and crime also developed in Denver.

Between 1880 and 1895, the city underwent a huge rise in corruption, as crime bosses, such as Soapy Smith, worked side by side with elected officials and the police to control elections, gambling, and bunco gangs. The city also suffered a depression in 1893 after the crash of silver prices. In 1887, the precursor to the international charity United Way was formed in Denver by local religious leaders, who raised funds and coordinated various charities to help Denver&#x27;s poor. By 1890, Denver had grown to be the second-largest city west of Omaha, Nebraska. In 1900, whites represented 96.8% of Denver&#x27;s population. The African American and Hispanic populations increased with migrations of the 20th century. Many African Americans first came as workers on the railroad, which had a terminus in Denver, and began to settle there.

Between the 1880s and 1930s, Denver&#x27;s floriculture industry developed and thrived. This period became known locally as the Carnation Gold Rush.

A bill proposing a state constitutional amendment to allow home rule for Denver and other municipalities was introduced in the legislature in 1901 and passed. The measure called for a statewide referendum, which voters approved in 1902. On December 1 that year, Governor James Orman proclaimed the amendment part of the state&#x27;s fundamental law. The City and County of Denver came into being on that date and was separated from Arapahoe and Adams counties.

From 1953 to 1989, the Rocky Flats Plant, a DOE nuclear weapon facility that was about 15 miles from Denver, produced fissile plutonium &quot;pits&quot; for nuclear warheads. A major fire at the facility in 1957, as well as leakage from nuclear waste stored at the site between 1958 and 1968, resulted in the contamination of some parts of Denver, to varying degrees, with plutonium-239, a harmful radioactive substance with a half-life of 24,200 years. A 1981 study by the Jefferson County health director, Carl Johnson, linked the contamination to an increase in birth defects and cancer incidence in central Denver and nearer Rocky Flats. Later studies confirmed many of his findings. Plutonium contamination was still present outside the former plant site . It presents risks to building the envisioned Jefferson Parkway, which would complete Denver&#x27;s automotive beltway.
In 1970, Denver was selected to host the 1976 Winter Olympics to coincide with Colorado&#x27;s centennial celebration, but in November 1972, Colorado voters struck down ballot initiatives allocating public funds to pay for the high costs of the games. They were moved to Innsbruck, Austria. The notoriety of being the only city ever to decline to host an Olympiad after being selected has made subsequent bids difficult. The movement against hosting the games was based largely on environmental issues and was led by State Representative Richard Lamm. He was subsequently elected to three terms (1975–87) as Colorado governor. Denver explored a potential bid for the 2022 Winter Olympics, but no bid was submitted.

In 2010, Denver adopted a comprehensive update of its zoning code, which was developed to guide development as envisioned in adopted plans such as Blueprint Denver, Transit Oriented Development Strategic Plan, Greenprint Denver, and the Strategic Transportation Plan.

Denver has hosted the Democratic National Convention twice, in 1908 and 2008. It promoted the city on the national, political, and socioeconomic stage. On August 10–15, 1993, Denver hosted the Catholic Church&#x27;s 6th World Youth Day, which was attended by an estimated 500,000, making it the largest gathering in Colorado history.

In 2015, a new commuter railway system commenced operations in the Denver metropolitan area with a network operation of 25 kV 60 Hz.

Denver has been known historically as the &quot;Queen City of the Plains&quot; and the &quot;Queen City of the West&quot;, because of its important role in the agricultural industry of the High Plains region in eastern Colorado and along the foothills of the Colorado Front Range.

==Geography==


Denver is in the center of the Front Range Urban Corridor, between the Rocky Mountains to the west and the High Plains to the east. Its topography consists of plains in the city center with hilly areas to the north, west, and south. It is the only state capital in the United States that is a consolidated city-county. At the 2020 United States census, the City and County of Denver had an area of , including of water. The City and County of Denver is surrounded by three other counties: Adams County to the north and east, Arapahoe County to the south and east, and Jefferson County to the west.

Denver&#x27;s nickname is the &quot;Mile-High City&quot;, as its official elevation is above sea level, defined by the elevation of the spot of a benchmark on the steps of the State Capitol building. The elevation of the entire city ranges from .

=== Neighborhoods ===


The City and County of Denver has 78 official neighborhoods used for planning and administration. The system of neighborhood boundaries and names dates to 1970 when city planners divided the city into 73 groups of one to four census tracts, called &quot;statistical neighborhoods,&quot; most of which are unchanged since then.

Unlike some other cities, such as Chicago, Denver does not have official larger area designations. Colloquially, names such as Northside and Westside are still in use, but not well-known. Community planners have recently been using a set of 19 larger areas, all of which are groups of statistical neighborhoods, as part of the Area Planning process.

Denver also has a number of colloquial neighborhood names and boundaries reflecting how people in an area, or others such as community groups and real estate developers, have defined areas. Well-known non-administrative neighborhoods include the historic and trendy LoDo (short for &quot;Lower Downtown&quot;), part of the city&#x27;s Union Station neighborhood; Uptown, straddling North Capitol Hill and City Park West; Curtis Park and RiNo (&quot;River North&quot;), both part of the Five Points neighborhood; Alamo Placita, the northern part of the Speer neighborhood; Park Hill, a successful example of intentional racial integration; and Golden Triangle, in the Civic Center.

One of Denver&#x27;s newer neighborhoods was built on the site of Stapleton International Airport, named after former Denver mayor Benjamin F. Stapleton, a member of the Ku Klux Klan. In 2020, the neighborhood&#x27;s community association voted to change the name from Stapleton to Central Park (see more in Politics section below). The Central Park neighborhood itself has 12 &quot;neighborhoods&quot; within its boundaries.

===Climate===

Denver features a continental semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;BSk&quot;, Trewartha: &quot;BSao&quot;) with generally low humidity and around 3,100 hours of sunshine per year, although humid microclimates can be found nearby depending on exact location. It has four distinct seasons and receives most of its precipitation from April through August. Due to its inland location on the High Plains, at the foot of the Rocky Mountains, the region can be subject to sudden changes in weather.

July is the warmest month, with an average high temperature of . Summers range from warm to hot with occasional, sometimes severe, afternoon thunderstorms and high temperatures reaching on 38 days annually, and occasionally . December, the coldest month of the year, has an average daily high temperature of . Winters consist of periods of snow and very low temperatures alternating with periods of milder weather due to the warming effect of Chinook winds. In winter, daytime highs occasionally exceed , but they also often fail to reach during periods of cold weather. Occasionally, daytime highs can even fail to rise above due to arctic air masses. On the coldest nights of the year, lows can fall to or below, with the city experiencing a low of on December 22, 2022, with a wind chill of . Snowfall is common throughout the late fall, winter and early spring, averaging for 1981–2010; but in the 2021 winter season, Denver began the month of December without any snowfall for the first time in history. The average window for measurable (≥) snow is October 17 through April 27; however, measurable snowfall has occurred as early as September 4 and as late as June 3. Extremes in temperature range from on January 9, 1875, up to as recently as June 28, 2018. Due to the city&#x27;s high elevation and aridity, diurnal temperature variation is large throughout the year.

Tornadoes are rare west of the I-25 corridor; one notable exception was an F3 tornado that struck south of downtown on June 15, 1988. On the other hand, the suburbs east of Denver and the city&#x27;s east-northeastern extension (Denver International Airport) can see a few tornadoes, often weak landspout tornadoes, each spring and summer, especially during June, with the enhancement of the Denver Convergence Vorticity Zone (DCVZ). The DCVZ, also known as the Denver Cyclone, is a variable vortex of storm-forming air flow usually found north and east of downtown, and which often includes the airport. Heavy weather from the DCVZ can disrupt airport operations. In a study looking at hail events in areas with a population of at least 50,000, Denver was found to be ranked 10th most prone to hail storms in the continental United States. In fact, Denver has had three of the top 10 costliest hailstorms in U.S. history, on July 11, 1990; July 20, 2009; and May 8, 2017.

Based on 30-year averages obtained from NOAA&#x27;s National Climatic Data Center for the months of December, January and February, Weather Channel ranked Denver the 18th-coldest major U.S. city .

Denver&#x27;s official weather station is at Denver International Airport, roughly from downtown. A 2019 analysis showed the average temperature at Denver International Airport, , was significantly cooler than downtown, . Many of the suburbs also have warmer temperatures and there is controversy regarding the location of the official temperature readings.

==Economy==


The Denver MSA has a gross metropolitan product of $157.6 billion in 2010, making it the 18th largest metro economy in the United States. Denver&#x27;s economy is based partially on its geographic position and its connection to some of the country&#x27;s major transportation systems. Because Denver is the largest city within , it has become a natural location for storage and distribution of goods and services to the Mountain States, Southwest states, as well as all western states. Another benefit for distribution is that Denver is nearly equidistant from large cities of the Midwest, such as Chicago and St. Louis and some large cities of the West Coast, such as Los Angeles and San Francisco.

Over the years, the city has been home to other large corporations in the central United States, making Denver a key trade point for the country. Several well-known companies originated in or have relocated to Denver. William Ainsworth opened the Denver Instrument Company in 1895 to make analytical balances for gold assayers. Its factory is now in Arvada. Aimco is headquartered in Denver. Samsonite began in Denver in 1910 as Shwayder Trunk Manufacturing Company, but Samsonite closed its NE Denver factory in 2001, and moved its headquarters to Massachusetts after a change of ownership in 2006. Qwest Corporation, founded in Denver in 1911 as Mountain States Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company, is now a part of Lumen Technologies (previously CenturyLink).

On October 31, 1937, Continental Airlines, now United Airlines, moved its headquarters to Stapleton Airport in Denver, Colorado (before United Airlines later moved to its current home in Chicago). Robert F. Six arranged to have the headquarters moved to Denver from El Paso, Texas because Six believed that the airline should have its headquarters in a large city with a potential base of customers. Continental later moved to Houston from Denver, but merged with United Airlines in 2013. Throughout that time, the company held a large employee base in the Denver area, which is home to the United Airlines Flight Training Center in the Central Park neighborhood. MediaNews Group purchased the &quot;Denver Post&quot; in 1987; the company is based in Denver. The Gates Corporation, the world&#x27;s largest producer of automotive belts and hoses, was established in S. Denver in 1919. Russell Stover Candies made its first chocolate candy in Denver in 1923, but moved to Kansas City in 1969. The original Frontier Airlines began operations at Denver&#x27;s old Stapleton International Airport in 1950; Frontier was reincarnated at DIA in 1994.

Scott&#x27;s Liquid Gold, Inc., has been making furniture polish in Denver since 1954. Village Inn restaurants began as a single pancake house in Denver in 1958. Big O Tires, LLC, of Centennial opened its first franchise in 1962 in Denver. The Shane Company sold its first diamond jewelry in 1971 in Denver. In 1973 Re/Max made Denver its headquarters.

Molson Coors Brewing Company established its U.S. headquarters in Denver in 2005, but announced its departure in 2019. Its subsidiary and regional wholesale distributor, Coors Distributing Company, is in NW Denver. The Newmont Mining Corporation, the second-largest gold producer in North America and one of the largest in the world, is headquartered in Denver. MapQuest, an online site for maps, directions and business listings, is headquartered in Denver&#x27;s LoDo district.

Large Denver-area employers that have headquarters elsewhere include Lockheed Martin Corp., United Airlines, Kroger Co. and Xcel Energy, Inc.

Geography also allows Denver to have a considerable government presence, with many federal agencies based or having offices in the Denver area. Along with federal agencies come many companies based on US defense and space projects, and more jobs are brought to the city by virtue of its being the capital of the state of Colorado. The Denver area is home to the former nuclear weapons plant Rocky Flats, the Denver Federal Center, Byron G. Rogers Federal Building and United States Courthouse, the Denver Mint, and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.

In 2005, a $310.7 million expansion of the Colorado Convention Center was completed, doubling its size. The hope was the center&#x27;s expansion would elevate the city to one of the top 10 cities in the nation for holding a convention.

Denver&#x27;s position near the mineral-rich Rocky Mountains encouraged mining and energy companies to spring up in the area. In the early days of the city, gold and silver booms and busts played a large role in the city&#x27;s economic success. In the 1970s and early 1980s, the energy crisis in America and resulting high oil prices created an energy boom in Denver captured in the soap opera &quot;Dynasty&quot;. Denver was built up considerably during this time with the construction of many new downtown skyscrapers. When the price of oil dropped from $34 a barrel in 1981 to $9 a barrel in 1986, the Denver economy also dropped, leaving almost 15,000 oil industry workers in the area unemployed (including former mayor and governor John Hickenlooper, a former geologist), and the nation&#x27;s highest office vacancy rate (30%). The industry has recovered and the region has 700 employed petroleum engineers. Advances in hydraulic fracturing have made the DJ Basin of Colorado into an accessible and lucrative oil play. Energy and mining are still important in Denver&#x27;s economy today, with companies such as Ovintiv, Halliburton, Smith International, Rio Tinto Group, Newmont Mining, and Chevron Corporation, headquartered or having significant operations. Denver is in 149th place in terms of the cost of doing business in the United States.
Denver&#x27;s west-central geographic location in the Mountain Time Zone (UTC−7) also benefits the telecommunications industry by allowing communication with both North American coasts, South America, Europe, and Asia on the same business day. Denver&#x27;s location on the 105th meridian at over in elevation also enables it to be the largest city in the U.S. to offer a &quot;one-bounce&quot; real-time satellite uplink to six continents in the same business day. Qwest Communications now part of CenturyLink, Dish Network Corporation, Starz, DIRECTV, and Comcast are a few of the many telecommunications companies with operations in the Denver area. These and other high-tech companies had a boom in Denver in the mid to late 1990s. After a rise in unemployment in the Great Recession, Denver&#x27;s unemployment rate recovered and had one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation at 2.6% in November 2016. As of December 2016, the unemployment rate for the Denver–Aurora–Broomfield MSA is 2.6%. The Downtown region has seen increased real estate investment with the construction of several new skyscrapers from 2010 onward and major development around Denver Union Station.

Denver has also enjoyed success as a pioneer in the fast-casual restaurant industry, with many popular national chain restaurants founded and based in Denver. Quiznos and Smashburger were founded and headquartered in Denver. Qdoba Mexican Grill, Noodles &amp; Company, and Good Times Burgers &amp; Frozen Custard originated in Denver, but have moved their headquarters to the suburbs of Wheat Ridge, Broomfield, and Golden, respectively. Chipotle Mexican Grill was founded in Denver, but moved its headquarters to Newport Beach, California in 2018.

In 2015, Denver ranked No. 1 on &quot;Forbes&quot;″ list of the Best Places for Business and Careers. 

In 2024, Denver based Ibotta&#x27;s initial public offering (IPO) was the largest tech IPO in Colorado&#x27;s history.

The city acquired the estate of abstract expressionist painter Clyfford Still in 2004 and built a museum to exhibit his works near the Denver Art Museum. The Denver Museum of Nature and Science holds an aquamarine specimen valued at over $1 million, as well as specimens of the state mineral, rhodochrosite. Every September the Denver Mart, at 451 E. 58th Avenue, hosts a gem and mineral show. The state history museum, History Colorado Center, opened in April 2012. It features hands-on and interactive exhibits, artifacts and programs about Colorado history. It was named in 2013 by &quot;True West Magazine&quot; as one of the top-ten &quot;must see&quot; history museums in the country. History Colorado&#x27;s Byers-Evans House Museum and the Molly Brown House are nearby.

Denver has numerous art districts, including Denver&#x27;s Art District on Santa Fe and the River North Art District (RiNo).

Of particular note is Denver&#x27;s importance in the folk scene of the 1960s and 1970s. Well-known folk artists such as Bob Dylan, Judy Collins and John Denver lived in Denver at various points during this time and performed at local clubs. Three members of the widely popular group Earth, Wind, and Fire are also from Denver.

==Parks and recreation==
, Denver had over 200 parks, from small pocket parks all over the city to the giant City Park. Denver also has 29 recreation centers providing places and programming for resident&#x27;s recreation and relaxation.

Many of Denver&#x27;s parks were acquired from state lands in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This coincided with the City Beautiful movement, and Denver mayor Robert Speer (1904–12 and 1916–18) set out to expand and beautify the city&#x27;s parks. Reinhard Schuetze was the city&#x27;s first landscape architect, and he brought his German-educated landscaping genius to Washington Park, Cheesman Park, and City Park among others. Speer used Schuetze as well as other landscape architects such as Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. and Saco Rienk DeBoer to design not only parks such as Civic Center Park, but many city parkways and tree-lawns. Cheesman Park neighbor the Denver Botanic Gardens displays the beauty and versatility of micro-climates within the semi-arid Denver Basin. All of these parks were fed with South Platte River water diverted through the city ditch.

In addition to the parks within Denver, the city acquired land for mountain parks starting in the 1911s. Over the years, Denver has acquired, built and maintained approximately of mountain parks, including Red Rocks Park, which is known for its scenery and musical history revolving around the unique Red Rocks Amphitheatre. Denver also owns the mountain on which the Winter Park Resort ski area operates in Grand County, west of Denver. City parks are important places for Denverites and visitors, inciting controversy with every change. Denver continues to grow its park system with the development of many new parks along the Platte River through the city, and with Central Park and Bluff Lake Nature Center in the Central Park neighborhood redevelopment. All of these parks are important gathering places for residents and allow what was once a dry plain to be lush, active, and green. Denver is also home to a large network of public community gardens, most of which are managed by Denver Urban Gardens, a non-profit organization.

Since 1974, Denver and the surrounding jurisdictions have rehabilitated the urban South Platte River and its tributaries for recreational use by hikers and cyclists. The main stem of the South Platte River Greenway runs along the South Platte into Adams County in the north. The Greenway project is recognized as one of the best urban reclamation projects in the U.S., winning, for example, the Silver Medal Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence in 2001.

, Park Score by the Trust for Public Land, a national land conservation organization, reported Denver as having the 18th best park system among the 50 most populous U.S. cities. The report noted that 89% of Denverites live within a 10-minute walk of a park.


==Government==

Denver is a consolidated city-county with a mayor elected on a nonpartisan ballot, a 13-member city council, and an auditor. The Denver City Council is elected from 11 districts with two at-large council members and is responsible for passing and changing all laws, resolutions, and ordinances, usually after a public hearing. The city council can also call for misconduct investigations of Denver&#x27;s departmental officials. All elected officials have four-year terms, with a maximum of three terms. The current mayor is Mike Johnston.

Denver has a strong mayor/weak city council government. The mayor can approve or veto any ordinances or resolutions approved by the council, makes sure all contracts with the city are kept and performed, signs all bonds and contracts, is responsible for the city budget, and can appoint people to various city departments, organizations, and commissions. The council can override the mayor&#x27;s veto with a nine votes. The city budget must be approved and can be changed by a simple majority vote of the council. The auditor checks all expenditures and may refuse to allow specific ones, usually for financial reasons.

The Denver Department of Safety oversees three branches: the Denver Police Department, Denver Fire Department, and Denver Sheriff Department. The Denver County Court is an integrated Colorado County Court and Municipal Court and is managed by Denver instead of the state.

===Politics===
While Denver elections are nonpartisan, Democrats have long dominated the city&#x27;s politics; most citywide officials are known to be registered with the Democratic Party. The mayor&#x27;s office has been occupied by a Democrat since the 1963 municipal election. All the city&#x27;s seats in the state legislature are held by Democrats.

In statewide elections, the city also tends to favor Democrats, though Republicans were occasionally competitive until the turn of the millennium. The last Republican to win Denver in a gubernatorial election was John A. Love in 1970 by a narrow majority. Bill Owens in 2002 remains the last Republican governor to receive at least 40% of Denver&#x27;s vote. The last Republican Senator to carry Denver was William L. Armstrong during his 1984 landslide. The last statewide Republican officeholder to carry Denver was Secretary of State Victoria Buckley in 1994 by 1.2% margin; she was, at the time, the highest ranking African-American Republican woman in the United States.

In federal elections, Denver is a Democratic stronghold. It has supported a Democrat for president in every election since 1984. Despite then-president Ronald Reagan&#x27;s landslide that year both nationally and in Colorado, Democrat Walter Mondale won Denver by a margin of 2.32%, and since then the party has increased its margin in almost every election. At the federal level, Denver is the heart of , which includes all of Denver and parts of Arapahoe County. It is the most Democratic district in the Mountain West and has been in Democratic hands for all but two terms since 1933. It is currently represented by Democrat Diana DeGette.

Benjamin F. Stapleton was the mayor of Denver for two periods, from 1923 to 1931 and from 1935 to 1947. He was responsible for many civic improvements, notably during his second term, when he had access to funds and manpower from the New Deal. During this time, the park system was considerably expanded and the Civic Center completed. His signature project was the construction of Denver Municipal Airport, which began in 1929 amid heavy criticism. It was later renamed Stapleton International Airport in his honor. Today, the airport has been replaced by a neighborhood initially named Stapleton. In 2020, during the George Floyd protests, because of Stapleton&#x27;s demonstrated racism and prominent membership in the Ku Klux Klan, neighborhood residents changed the name to Central Park. Stapleton Street continues to bear his name.

During the 1960s and 1970s, Denver was one of the centers of the Chicano Movement. The boxer-turned-activist Rodolfo &quot;Corky&quot; Gonzales formed an organization called the Crusade for Justice, which battled police brutality, fought for bilingual education, and, most notably, hosted the First National Chicano Youth Liberation Conference in March 1969.

In recent years, Denver has taken a stance on helping people who are or become homeless, particularly under the administrations of mayors John Hickenlooper and Wellington Webb. At a rate of 19 homeless per 10,000 residents in 2011 as compared to 50 or more per 10,000 residents for the four metro areas with the highest rate of homelessness, Denver&#x27;s homeless population and rate of homeless are both considerably lower than many other major cities. But residents of the city streets suffer Denver winters – which, although mild and dry much of the time, can have brief periods of extremely cold temperatures and snow.

In 2005, Denver became the first major U.S. city to vote to make the private possession of less than an ounce of marijuana legal for adults 21 and older. The city voted 53.5 percent in favor of the marijuana legalization measure, which, as then-mayor John Hickenlooper pointed out, was without effect, because the city cannot usurp state law, which at that time treated marijuana possession in much the same way as a speeding ticket, with fines of up to $100 and no jail time. Denver passed an initiative in the fourth quarter of 2007 requiring the mayor to appoint an 11-member review panel to monitor the city&#x27;s compliance with the 2005 ordinance. In May 2019, Denver became the first U.S. city to decriminalize psilocybin mushrooms after an initiative passed with 50.6% of the vote. The measure prohibits Denver from using any resources to prosecute adults over 21 for personal use of psilocybin mushrooms, though such use remains illegal under state and federal law.

Denver hosted the 2008 Democratic National Convention, which was the centennial of the city&#x27;s first hosting of the landmark 1908 convention. It also hosted the G7 summit between June 20 and 22 in 1997 and the 2000 National Convention of the Green Party. In 1972, 1981, and 2008, Denver also hosted the Libertarian Party of the United States National Convention. The 1972 Convention was notable for nominating Tonie Nathan for vice president, the first woman, as well as the first Jew, to receive an electoral vote in a United States presidential election.

On October 3, 2012, the University of Denver hosted the first of the three 2012 presidential debates.

In July 2019, Mayor Hancock said that Denver will not assist U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents with immigration raids.











===Taxes===
The City and County of Denver levies an occupational privilege tax (OPT or head tax) on employers and employees.
*If any employee performs work in the city limits and is paid over $500 for that work in a single month, the employee and employer are both liable for the OPT regardless of where the main business office is located or headquartered.
*The employer is liable for $4 per employee per month and the employee is liable for $5.75 per month.
*It is the employer&#x27;s responsibility to withhold, remit, and file the OPT returns. If an employer does not comply, the employer can be held liable for both portions of the OPT as well as penalties and interest.

==Education==

Denver Public Schools (DPS) is the public school system in all of Denver. It educates approximately 92,000 students in 92 elementary schools, 44 K-8 schools, 34 middle schools, 18 high schools, and 19 charter schools. The first school of what is now DPS was a log cabin that opened in 1859, which later became East High School. East High School, along with the other three directional high schools (West, North, and South), made up the first four high schools in Denver. The district boundaries are coextensive with the city limits. The Cherry Creek School District serves some areas with Denver postal addresses that are outside the city limits.

Denver&#x27;s many colleges and universities range in age and study programs. Three major public schools constitute the Auraria Campus: the University of Colorado Denver, Metropolitan State University of Denver, and Community College of Denver. The private University of Denver was the first institution of higher learning in the city and was founded in 1864. Other prominent Denver higher education institutions include Johnson &amp; Wales University, Catholic (Jesuit) Regis University, and the city has Roman Catholic and Jewish institutions, as well as a health sciences school. In addition to those schools within the city, there are a number of schools throughout the surrounding metro area.
==Media==

The Denver metropolitan area is served by a variety of media outlets in print, radio, television, and the Internet.

===Television stations===
Denver is the 16th-largest market in the country for television, according to the 2009–2010 rankings from Nielsen Media Research.
* KWGN-TV, channel 2, a CW O&amp;O station owned by Nexstar Media Group, who also owns Fox affiliate KDVR 31. KWGN is run by KDVR management and is Colorado&#x27;s first TV station, on the air since July 1952.
*KCDO-TV, channel 3, an independent station owned by the E. W. Scripps Company, who also own KMGH-TV as part of a duopoly.
* KCNC-TV, channel 4, a CBS O&amp;O station.
* KRMA-TV, channel 6, the flagship of Rocky Mountain PBS, a state network of five public TV stations throughout Colorado.
* KMGH-TV, channel 7, an ABC affiliate owned by the E. W. Scripps Company, previously owned by the McGraw-Hill company for 40 years prior to 2012. The station is part of a duopoly with KCDO-TV.
* KUSA-TV, channel 9, an NBC affiliate owned by Tegna, who also owns KTVD 20, a MyNetworkTV affiliate.
* KBDI-TV, channel 12, a secondary PBS member station.
* KDEN-TV, channel 25, a Telemundo O&amp;O station.
* KPJR-TV, channel 38, a TBN O&amp;O station.
* KCEC, channel 50, a Univision affiliate.
* KETD, channel 53, an Estrella TV O&amp;O station.

===Radio stations===
Denver is also served by over 40 AM and FM radio stations, covering a wide variety of formats and styles. Denver–Boulder radio is the No. 19 market in the United States, according to the Spring 2011 Arbitron ranking (up from No. 20 in Fall 2009). For a list of Denver radio stations, see List of radio stations in Colorado.

===Print===
After continued rivalry between Denver&#x27;s two main newspapers, &quot;The Denver Post&quot; and the &quot;Rocky Mountain News&quot;, the papers merged operations in 2001 under a joint operating agreement that formed the Denver Newspaper Agency. This arrangement lasted until February 2009 when the E. W. Scripps Company, the owner of the &quot;Rocky Mountain News&quot;, closed the paper. There are also several alternative or localized newspapers published in Denver, including the &quot;Westword&quot;, &quot;Law Week Colorado&quot;, &quot;Out Front Colorado,&quot; and the &quot;Intermountain Jewish News&quot;. Denver is home to multiple regional magazines such as &quot;5280&quot;, which takes its name from the city&#x27;s mile-high elevation (). The &quot;Colorado Times News&quot; is a Korean-language publication based in Denver.

==Transportation==
===City streets===

Most of Denver has a straightforward street grid oriented to the four cardinal directions. Blocks are usually identified in hundreds from the median streets, identified as &quot;00&quot;, which are Broadway (the east–west median, running north–south) and Ellsworth Avenue (the north–south median, running east–west). Colfax Avenue, a major east–west artery through Denver, is 15 blocks (1500) north of the median. Avenues north of Ellsworth are numbered (with the exception of Colfax Avenue and several others, such as Martin Luther King, Jr. Blvd and Montview Blvd.), while avenues south of Ellsworth are named.

There is also an older downtown grid system that was designed to be parallel to the confluence of the South Platte River and Cherry Creek. Most of the streets downtown and in LoDo run northeast–southwest and northwest–southeast. This system has an unplanned benefit for snow removal; if the streets were in a normal N–S/E–W grid, only the N–S streets would receive sunlight. With the grid oriented to the diagonal directions, the NW–SE streets receive sunlight to melt snow in the morning and the NE–SW streets receive it in the afternoon. This idea was from Henry Brown the founder of the Brown Palace Hotel. There is now a plaque across the street from the Brown Palace Hotel that honors this idea. The NW–SE streets are numbered, while the NE–SW streets are named. The named streets start at the intersection of Colfax Avenue and Broadway with the block-long Cheyenne Place. The numbered streets start underneath the Colfax and I-25 viaducts. There are 27 named and 44 numbered streets on this grid. There are also a few vestiges of the old grid system in the normal grid, such as Park Avenue, Morrison Road, and Speer Boulevard. Larimer Street, named after William Larimer Jr., the founder of Denver, which is in the heart of LoDo, is the oldest street in Denver.

All roads in the downtown grid system are streets (e.g., 16th Street, Stout Street), except for the five NE–SW roads nearest the intersection of Colfax Avenue and Broadway: Cheyenne Place, Cleveland Place, Court Place, Tremont Place and Glenarm Place. Roads outside that system that travel east–west are designated &quot;avenues&quot; and those that travel north–south are designated &quot;streets&quot; (e.g., Colfax Avenue, Lincoln Street). Boulevards are higher capacity streets and travel any direction (more commonly north and south). Smaller roads are sometimes referred to as places, drives (though not all drives are smaller capacity roads; some are major thoroughfares), or courts. Most streets outside the area between Broadway and Colorado Boulevard are organized alphabetically from the city&#x27;s center.

East of Colorado Boulevard, the naming convention of streets takes on a predictable pattern of going through the alphabet by using each letter twice (i.e. AA, BB, CC, DD, through YY – there is no Z). The first street is almost always named after a plant or fruit, the second street is almost always named after a foreign place or location. For example, Jersey Street / Jasmine Street, Quebec Street / Quince Street, and Syracuse Street / Spruce Street. Inexplicably, the letter Y only has one street (Yosemite), and there is no Z. This double-alphabet naming convention continues in some form into Aurora, Colorado.

Some Denver streets have bicycle lanes, leaving a patchwork of disjointed routes throughout the city. There are over of paved, off-road, bike paths in Denver parks and along bodies of water, like Cherry Creek and the South Platte. This allows for a significant portion of Denver&#x27;s population to be bicycle commuters and has led to Denver being known as a bicycle-friendly city. Some residents strongly oppose bike lanes, which has caused some plans to be watered down or nixed. The review process for one bike line on Broadway will last over a year before city council members will make a decision. In addition to the many bike paths, Denver launched B-Cycle – a citywide bicycle sharing program – in late April 2010. The B-Cycle network was the largest in the United States at the time of its launch, boasting 400 bicycles.

The Denver Boot, a car-disabling device, was first used in Denver.

===Cycling===
The League of American Bicyclists rated Colorado as the sixth most bicycle-friendly state in the nation for 2014. This is due in large part to Front Range cities like Boulder, Fort Collins and Denver placing an emphasis on legislation, programs and infrastructure developments that promote cycling as a mode of transportation. Walk Score has rated Denver as the fourth most bicycle-friendly large city in the United States. According to data from the 2011 American Community Survey, Denver ranks 6th among US cities with populations over 400,000 in terms of the percentage of workers who commute by bicycle at 2.2% of commuters.

B-Cycle – Denver&#x27;s citywide bicycle sharing program – was the largest in the United States at the time of its launch in 2010, boasting 400 bicycles. B-Cycle ridership peaked in 2014, then steadily declined. The program announced it would cease operations at the end of January 2020. The city announced plans to seek one or more new contractors to run a bike-share program starting mid-2020.

=== Electric rental scooters ===
In 2018, electric scooter services began to place scooters in Denver. Hundreds of unsanctioned LimeBike and Bird electric scooters appeared on Denver streets in May, causing an uproar. In June, the city ordered the companies to remove them and acted quickly to create an official program, including a requirement that scooters be left at RTD stops and out of the public right-of-way. Lime and Bird scooters then reappeared in late July, with limited compliance. Uber&#x27;s Jump e-bikes arrived in late August, followed by Lyft&#x27;s nationwide electric scooter launch in early September. Lyft says that it will, each night, take the scooters to the warehouse for safety checks, maintenance and charging. Additionally, Spin and Razor each were permitted to add 350 scooters.

===Walkability===
2017 rankings by Walk Score placed Denver twenty-sixth among 108 U.S. cities with a population of 200,000 or greater. City leaders have acknowledged the concerns of walkability advocates that Denver has serious gaps in its sidewalk network. The 2019 &quot;Denver Moves: Pedestrians&quot; plan outlines a need for approximate $1.3 billion in sidewalk funding, plus $400 million for trails. In 2022, Denver voters passed Initiative 307, dubbed &quot;Denver Deserves Sidewalks&quot;, to complete sidewalk construction and repair by shifting responsibility for sidewalk maintenance from property owners to the city and imposing a new fee on property owners based on the length of a property&#x27;s sidewalk frontage, although the measure may be revised in the course of implementation.

===Modal characteristics===
In 2015, 9.6 percent of Denver households lacked a car, and in 2016, this was virtually unchanged (9.4 percent). The national average was 8.7 percent in 2016. Denver averaged 1.62 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8.

===Freeways and highways===
Denver is primarily served by the interstate freeways I-25 and I-70. The problematic intersection of the two interstates is referred to locally as &quot;the mousetrap&quot; because, when viewed from the air, the junction (and subsequent vehicles) resemble mice in a large trap.
* Interstate 25 runs north–south from New Mexico through Denver to Wyoming
* Interstate 225 traverses neighboring Aurora. I-225 was designed to link Aurora with I-25 in the southeastern corner of Denver, and I-70 to the north of Aurora, with construction starting May 1964 and ending May 21, 1976.
* Interstate 70 runs east–west from Utah to Maryland. It is also the primary corridor on which motorists access the mountains.
* Interstate 270 runs concurrently with US 36 from an interchange with Interstate 70 in northeast Denver to an interchange with Interstate 25 north of Denver. The freeway continues as US 36 from the interchange with Interstate 25.
* Interstate 76 begins from I-70 just west of the city in Arvada. It intersects I-25 north of the city and runs northeast to Nebraska where it ends at I-80.
* US 6 follows the alignment of 6th Avenue west of I-25, and connects downtown Denver to the west-central suburbs of Golden and Lakewood. It continues west through Utah and Nevada to Bishop, California. To the east, it continues as far as Provincetown, on Cape Cod in Massachusetts.
* US 285 ends its route through New Mexico and Texas at Interstate 25 in the University Hills neighborhood.
* US 85 also travels through Denver. This highway is often used as an alternate route to Castle Rock instead of taking Interstate 25.
* U.S. Route 87 runs north–south and through Denver. It is concurrent with I-25 the entire length in the state.
* US 36 connects Denver to Boulder and Rocky Mountain National Park near Estes Park. It runs east into Ohio, after crossing four other states.
* State Highway 93 starts in the western Metropolitan area in Golden, Colorado, and travels almost to meet with SH 119 in central Boulder. This highway is often used as an alternate route to Boulder instead of taking US 36.
* State Highway 470 (C-470, SH 470) is the southwestern portion of the Denver metro area&#x27;s beltway. Originally planned as Interstate 470 in the 1960s, the beltway project was attacked on environmental impact grounds and the interstate beltway was never built. The portion of &quot;Interstate 470&quot; built as a state highway is the present-day SH 470, which is a freeway for its entire length.

Denver also has a nearly complete beltway known as &quot;the 470&#x27;s&quot;. These are SH 470 (also known as C-470), a freeway in the southwest Metro area, and two toll highways, E-470 (from southeast to northeast) and Northwest Parkway (from terminus of E-470 to US 36). SH 470 was intended to be I-470 and built with federal highway funds, but the funding was redirected to complete conversion of downtown Denver&#x27;s 16th Street to a pedestrian mall. As a result, construction was delayed until 1980 after state and local legislation was passed. I-470 was also once called &quot;The Silver Stake Highway&quot;, from Gov. Lamm&#x27;s declared intention to drive a silver stake through it and kill it.

A highway expansion and transit project for the southern I-25 corridor, dubbed T-REX (Transportation Expansion Project), was completed on November 17, 2006. The project installed wider and additional highway lanes, and improved highway access and drainage. The project also includes a light rail line that traverses from downtown to the south end of the metro area at Lincoln Avenue. The project spanned almost along the highway with an additional line traveling parallel to part of I-225, stopping just short of Parker Road.

Metro Denver highway conditions can be accessed on the Colorado Department of Transportation COtrip website.

===Mass transportation===

Mass transportation throughout the Denver metropolitan area is managed and coordinated by the Regional Transportation District (RTD). RTD operates more than 1,000 buses serving over 10,000 bus stops in 38 municipal jurisdictions in eight counties around the Denver and Boulder metropolitan areas. Additionally, RTD operates ten rail lines, the A, B, D, E, G, H, L, N, R, and W, with a total of of track, serving 77 stations, 35 of which are located within the City of Denver proper. The D, E, H, L, R, and W Lines are light rail while the A, B, G, and N Lines are commuter rail.

FasTracks is a commuter rail, light rail, and bus expansion project approved by voters in 2004, which will serve neighboring suburbs and communities. The W Line, or West line, opened in April 2013 serving Golden/Federal Center. The commuter rail A Line from Denver Union Station to Denver International Airport opened in April 2016 with ridership exceeding RTD&#x27;s early expectations. The light rail R Line through Aurora opened in February 2017. The G Line to the suburb of Arvada (originally planned to open in the Fall of 2016) opened on April 26, 2019. The N Line to Commerce City and Thornton opened on September 21, 2020.

An express bus service, known as the Flatiron Flyer, serves to connect Boulder and Denver. The service, billed as bus rapid transit, has been accused of bus rapid transit creep for failing to meet the majority of BRT requirements, including level boarding and all-door entry. A commuter rail connection to Boulder and its suburb of Longmont, also part of the FasTracks ballot initiative and an extension of the B Line, is planned to be finished by RTD, but no construction funds have yet been identified prior to 2040. RTD is currently considering an interim commuter service which would run rush-hour trains from Longmont to Denver.

The Colorado Department of Transportation runs Bustang, a bus system that offers weekday and weekend service connecting Denver with Grand Junction, Colorado Springs, Fort Collins, and Gunnison.

Greyhound Lines, the intercity bus operator, has a major hub in Denver, with routes to New York City, Portland, Reno, Las Vegas, and their headquarters, Dallas. Subsidiary Autobuses Americanos provides service to El Paso. Allied bus operators Express Arrow, and Burlington Trailways provide service to Billings, Omaha, Indianapolis, and Alamosa.

Amtrak, the national passenger rail system, provides service to Denver, operating its &quot;California Zephyr&quot; daily in both directions between Chicago and Emeryville, California, across the bay from San Francisco. Amtrak Thruway service operated by private bus companies links the Denver station with Rocky Mountain points. In 2017 the Colorado legislature reinvigorated studies of passenger rail service along the Front Range, potentially connecting Denver to Fort Collins and Pueblo, or further to Amtrak connections in Cheyenne, Wyoming and Trinidad. Front Range Passenger Rail is a current proposal (as of 2023) to link the cities from Pueblo in the south, north to Fort Collins and possibly to Cheyenne, Wyoming.

At Albuquerque, New Mexico, Denver Thruway connections are made daily with the Amtrak &quot;Southwest Chief&quot;. Additionally, the Ski Train operated on the former Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad, which took passengers between Denver and the Winter Park Ski Resort, but it is no longer in service. The Ski Train made its final run to Winter Park on March 29, 2009. The service was revived on a trial basis in 2016 with a great amount of local fanfare. Further development of a mountain corridor rail option, though publicly popular, has been met with resistance from politicians, namely the director of Colorado Department of Transportation. The Ski Train did return to service under Amtrak with the name &quot;Winter Park Express&quot; in 2017, and currently runs only on Saturdays, Sundays, and major holidays during the winter ski seasons.

Denver&#x27;s early years as a major train hub of the west are still very visible today. Trains stop in Denver at historic Union Station, where travelers can access RTD&#x27;s 16th Street Free MallRide or use light rail to tour the city. Union Station will also serve as the main juncture for rail travel in the metro area, at the completion of FasTracks. The city also plans to invest billions to bringing frequent public transit within one-fourth of a mile of most of its residents.

====Denver public transportation statistics====
The average amount of time people spend commuting on public transit in Denver and Boulder, Colorado—for example, to and from work, on a weekday—is 77 minutes; 31% of public transit riders ride for more than two hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 14 minutes, while 25% of riders wait for over 20 minutes, on average, every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is , while 31% travel over in a single direction.

===Airports===

Denver International Airport (IATA: DEN, ICAO: KDEN), commonly known as DIA, serves as the primary airport for the Front Range Urban Corridor surrounding Denver. DIA is east-northeast of the Colorado State Capitol and opened in 1995. DIA is the 3rd busiest airport in the world with 58.8 million passengers in 2021; it had the 5th highest number of passengers in the U.S., 61 million, in the pre-pandemic year 2019. It covers more than , making it the largest airport by land area in the United States and larger than the island of Manhattan. DIA serves as a major hub for United Airlines, is the headquarters and primary hub for Frontier Airlines, and is a major focus city and the fastest-growing market for Southwest Airlines.

In 2017, Denver International Airport was rated by Skytrax as the 28th-best airport in the world, falling to second place in the United States behind Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. Skytrax also named DIA as the second-best regional airport in North America for 2017, and the fourth-best regional airport in the world.

Three general aviation airports serve the Denver area. Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport (KBJC) is north-northwest, Centennial Airport (KAPA) is south-southeast, and Colorado Air and Space Port (KCFO), formerly Front Range Airport, is east of the state capitol. Centennial Airport also offers limited commercial airline service, on two cargo airlines.

In the past, Denver has been home to several other airports that are no longer operational. Stapleton International Airport was closed in 1995 when it was replaced by DIA. Lowry Air Force Base was a military flight training facility that ceased flight operations in 1966, with the base finally closing in 1994. Both Stapleton and Lowry have since been redeveloped into primarily residential neighborhoods. Buckley Space Force Base is the only military facility in the Denver area.

==Notable people==
==Twin towns – sister cities==
Denver&#x27;s relationship with Brest, France, began in 1948, making it the second-oldest sister city in the United States. In 1947, Amanda Knecht, a teacher at East High School, visited World War II–ravaged Brest. When she returned, she shared her experiences in the city with her students, and her class raised $32,000 to help rebuild the children&#x27;s wing of Brest&#x27;s hospital. The gift led to the development of the sister city program with Brest. There were serious efforts in the early 2000s, in both Denver and Sochi, Russian Federation, to establish sister-city ties, but the negotiations did not come to fruition.

Since then, Denver has established relationships with additional sister cities:
* Brest, France (1948)
* Takayama, Japan (1960)
* Nairobi, Kenya (1975)
* Karmiel, Israel (1977)
* Cuernavaca, Mexico (1983)
* Potenza, Italy (1983)
* Chennai, India (1984)
* Kunming, China (1985)
* Axum, Ethiopia (1995)
* Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia (2001)
* Akureyri, Iceland (2012)

<doc id="8524" wikidata="Q102296" url="?curid=8524" title="Deuterium">
<text>Deuterium (hydrogen-2, symbol H or D, also known as heavy hydrogen) is one of two stable isotopes of hydrogen; the other is protium, or hydrogen-1, H. The deuterium nucleus (deuteron) contains one proton and one neutron, whereas the far more common H has no neutrons. 

The name &quot;deuterium&quot; comes from Greek &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;second&quot;. American chemist Harold Urey discovered deuterium in 1931. Urey and others produced samples of heavy water in which the H had been highly concentrated. The discovery of deuterium won Urey a Nobel Prize in 1934.

Nearly all deuterium found in nature was synthesized in the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago, forming the primordial ratio of H to H (≈26 deuterium nuclei per 10 hydrogen nuclei). Deuterium is subsequently produced by the slow stellar proton–proton chain, but rapidly destroyed by exothermic fusion reactions. The deuterium-deuterium reaction has the second-lowest energy threshold, and is the most astrophysically accessible, occurring in both stars and brown dwarfs.

The gas giant planets display the primordial ratio of deuterium. Comets show an elevated ratio similar to Earth&#x27;s oceans (156 deuterium nuclei per 10 hydrogen nuclei). This reinforces theories that much of Earth&#x27;s ocean water is of cometary origin. The deuterium ratio of comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko, as measured by the &quot;Rosetta&quot; space probe, is about three times that of Earth water. This figure is the highest yet measured in a comet, thus deuterium ratios continue to be an active topic of research in both astronomy and climatology.

Deuterium is used in most nuclear weapons, many fusion power experiments, and as the most effective neutron moderator, primarily in heavy water nuclear reactors. It is also used as an isotopic label, in biogeochemistry, NMR spectroscopy, and deuterated drugs.

== Differences from common hydrogen (protium) ==
=== Chemical symbol ===
Deuterium is often represented by the chemical symbol D. Since it is an isotope of hydrogen with mass number 2, it is also represented by H. IUPAC allows both D and H, though H is preferred. A distinct chemical symbol is used for convenience because of the isotope&#x27;s common use in various scientific processes. Also, its large mass difference with protium (H) confers non-negligible chemical differences with H compounds. Deuterium has a mass of , about twice the mean hydrogen atomic weight of , or twice protium&#x27;s mass of . The isotope weight ratios within other elements are largely insignificant in this regard.

=== Spectroscopy ===
In quantum mechanics, the energy levels of electrons in atoms depend on the reduced mass of the system of electron and nucleus. For a hydrogen atom, the role of reduced mass is most simply seen in the Bohr model of the atom, where the reduced mass appears in a simple calculation of the Rydberg constant and Rydberg equation, but the reduced mass also appears in the Schrödinger equation, and the Dirac equation for calculating atomic energy levels.

The reduced mass of the system in these equations is close to the mass of a single electron, but differs from it by a small amount about equal to the ratio of mass of the electron to the nucleus. For H, this amount is about , or 1.000545, and for H it is even smaller: , or 1.0002725. The energies of electronic spectra lines for H and H therefore differ by the ratio of these two numbers, which is 1.000272. The wavelengths of all deuterium spectroscopic lines are shorter than the corresponding lines of light hydrogen, by 0.0272%. In astronomical observation, this corresponds to a blue Doppler shift of 0.0272% of the speed of light, or 81.6 km/s.

The differences are much more pronounced in vibrational spectroscopy such as infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy, and in rotational spectra such as microwave spectroscopy because the reduced mass of the deuterium is markedly higher than that of protium. In nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, deuterium has a very different NMR frequency (e.g. 61 MHz when protium is at 400 MHz) and is much less sensitive. Deuterated solvents are usually used in protium NMR to prevent the solvent from overlapping with the signal, though deuterium NMR on its own right is also possible.

=== Big Bang nucleosynthesis ===

Deuterium is thought to have played an important role in setting the number and ratios of the elements that were formed in the Big Bang. Combining thermodynamics and the changes brought about by cosmic expansion, one can calculate the fraction of protons and neutrons based on the temperature at the point that the universe cooled enough to allow formation of nuclei. This calculation indicates seven protons for every neutron at the beginning of nucleogenesis, a ratio that would remain stable even after nucleogenesis was over. This fraction was in favor of protons initially, primarily because the lower mass of the proton favored their production. As the Universe expanded, it cooled. Free neutrons and protons are less stable than helium nuclei, and the protons and neutrons had a strong energetic reason to form helium-4. However, forming helium-4 requires the intermediate step of forming deuterium.

Through much of the few minutes after the Big Bang during which nucleosynthesis could have occurred, the temperature was high enough that the mean energy per particle was greater than the binding energy of weakly bound deuterium; therefore, any deuterium that was formed was immediately destroyed. This situation is known as the deuterium bottleneck. The bottleneck delayed formation of any helium-4 until the Universe became cool enough to form deuterium (at about a temperature equivalent to 100 keV). At this point, there was a sudden burst of element formation (first deuterium, which immediately fused into helium). However, very soon thereafter, at twenty minutes after the Big Bang, the Universe became too cool for any further nuclear fusion or nucleosynthesis. At this point, the elemental abundances were nearly fixed, with the only change as some of the radioactive products of Big Bang nucleosynthesis (such as tritium) decay. The deuterium bottleneck in the formation of helium, together with the lack of stable ways for helium to combine with hydrogen or with itself (no stable nucleus has a mass number of 5 or 8) meant that an insignificant amount of carbon, or any elements heavier than carbon, formed in the Big Bang. These elements thus required formation in stars. At the same time, the failure of much nucleogenesis during the Big Bang ensured that there would be plenty of hydrogen in the later universe available to form long-lived stars, such as the Sun.

=== Abundance ===
Deuterium occurs in trace amounts naturally as deuterium gas (H or D), but most deuterium atoms in the Universe are bonded with H to form a gas called hydrogen deuteride (HD or HH). Similarly, natural water contains deuterated molecules, almost all as semiheavy water HDO with only one deuterium.

The existence of deuterium on Earth, elsewhere in the Solar System (as confirmed by planetary probes), and in the spectra of stars, is also an important datum in cosmology. Gamma radiation from ordinary nuclear fusion dissociates deuterium into protons and neutrons, and there is no known natural process other than Big Bang nucleosynthesis that might have produced deuterium at anything close to its observed natural abundance. Deuterium is produced by the rare cluster decay, and occasional absorption of naturally occurring neutrons by light hydrogen, but these are trivial sources. There is thought to be little deuterium in the interior of the Sun and other stars, as at these temperatures the nuclear fusion reactions that consume deuterium happen much faster than the proton–proton reaction that creates deuterium. However, deuterium persists in the outer solar atmosphere at roughly the same concentration as in Jupiter, and this has probably been unchanged since the origin of the Solar System. The natural abundance of H seems to be a very similar fraction of hydrogen, wherever hydrogen is found, unless there are obvious processes at work that concentrate it.

The existence of deuterium at a low but constant primordial fraction in all hydrogen is another one of the arguments in favor of the Big Bang over the Steady State theory of the Universe. The observed ratios of hydrogen to helium to deuterium in the universe are difficult to explain except with a Big Bang model. It is estimated that the abundances of deuterium have not evolved significantly since their production about 13.8 billion years ago. Measurements of Milky Way galactic deuterium from ultraviolet spectral analysis show a ratio of as much as 23 atoms of deuterium per million hydrogen atoms in undisturbed gas clouds, which is only 15% below the WMAP estimated primordial ratio of about 27 atoms per million from the Big Bang. This has been interpreted to mean that less deuterium has been destroyed in star formation in the Milky Way galaxy than expected, or perhaps deuterium has been replenished by a large in-fall of primordial hydrogen from outside the galaxy. In space a few hundred light years from the Sun, deuterium abundance is only 15 atoms per million, but this value is presumably influenced by differential adsorption of deuterium onto carbon dust grains in interstellar space.

The abundance of deuterium in Jupiter&#x27;s atmosphere has been directly measured by the &quot;Galileo&quot; space probe as 26 atoms per million hydrogen atoms. ISO-SWS observations find 22 atoms per million hydrogen atoms in Jupiter. and this abundance is thought to represent close to the primordial Solar System ratio. This is about 17% of the terrestrial ratio of 156 deuterium atoms per million hydrogen atoms.

Comets such as Comet Hale-Bopp and Halley&#x27;s Comet have been measured to contain more deuterium (about 200 atoms per million hydrogens), ratios which are enriched with respect to the presumed protosolar nebula ratio, probably due to heating, and which are similar to the ratios found in Earth seawater. The recent measurement of deuterium amounts of 161 atoms per million hydrogen in Comet 103P/Hartley (a former Kuiper belt object), a ratio almost exactly that in Earth&#x27;s oceans (155.76 ± 0.1, but in fact from 153 to 156 ppm), emphasizes the theory that Earth&#x27;s surface water may be largely from comets. Most recently the HHR of 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko as measured by &quot;Rosetta&quot; is about three times that of Earth water. This has caused renewed interest in suggestions that Earth&#x27;s water may be partly of asteroidal origin.

Deuterium has also been observed to be concentrated over the mean solar abundance in other terrestrial planets, in particular Mars and Venus.

=== Production ===
Deuterium is produced for industrial, scientific and military purposes, by starting with ordinary water—a small fraction of which is naturally occurring heavy water—and then separating out the heavy water by the Girdler sulfide process, distillation, or other methods.

In theory, deuterium for heavy water could be created in a nuclear reactor, but separation from ordinary water is the cheapest bulk production process.

The world&#x27;s leading supplier of deuterium was Atomic Energy of Canada Limited until 1997, when the last heavy water plant was shut down. Canada uses heavy water as a neutron moderator for the operation of the CANDU reactor design.

Another major producer of heavy water is India. All but one of India&#x27;s atomic energy plants are pressurized heavy water plants, which use natural (i.e., not enriched) uranium. India has eight heavy water plants, of which seven are in operation. Six plants, of which five are in operation, are based on D–H exchange in ammonia gas. The other two plants extract deuterium from natural water in a process that uses hydrogen sulfide gas at high pressure.

While India is self-sufficient in heavy water for its own use, India also exports reactor-grade heavy water.

=== Physical properties ===

Compared to hydrogen in its natural composition on Earth, pure deuterium (H) has a higher melting point (18.72 K vs. 13.99 K), a higher boiling point (23.64 vs. 20.27 K), a higher critical temperature (38.3 vs. 32.94 K) and a higher critical pressure (1.6496 vs. 1.2858 MPa).

The physical properties of deuterium compounds can exhibit significant kinetic isotope effects and other physical and chemical property differences from the protium analogs. HO, for example, is more viscous than normal . There are differences in bond energy and length for compounds of heavy hydrogen isotopes compared to protium, which are larger than the isotopic differences in any other element. Bonds involving deuterium and tritium are somewhat stronger than the corresponding bonds in protium, and these differences are enough to cause significant changes in biological reactions. Pharmaceutical firms are interested in the fact that H is harder to remove from carbon than H.

Deuterium can replace H in water molecules to form heavy water (HO), which is about 10.6% denser than normal water (so that ice made from it sinks in normal water). Heavy water is slightly toxic in eukaryotic animals, with 25% substitution of the body water causing cell division problems and sterility, and 50% substitution causing death by cytotoxic syndrome (bone marrow failure and gastrointestinal lining failure). Prokaryotic organisms, however, can survive and grow in pure heavy water, though they develop slowly. Despite this toxicity, consumption of heavy water under normal circumstances does not pose a health threat to humans. It is estimated that a person might drink of heavy water without serious consequences. Small doses of heavy water (a few grams in humans, containing an amount of deuterium comparable to that normally present in the body) are routinely used as harmless metabolic tracers in humans and animals.

=== Quantum properties ===
The deuteron has spin +1 (&quot;triplet state&quot;) and is thus a boson. The NMR frequency of deuterium is significantly different from normal hydrogen. Infrared spectroscopy also easily differentiates many deuterated compounds, due to the large difference in IR absorption frequency seen in the vibration of a chemical bond containing deuterium, versus light hydrogen. The two stable isotopes of hydrogen can also be distinguished by using mass spectrometry.

The triplet deuteron nucleon is barely bound at , and none of the higher energy states are bound. The singlet deuteron is a virtual state, with a negative binding energy of . There is no such stable particle, but this virtual particle transiently exists during neutron–proton inelastic scattering, accounting for the unusually large neutron scattering cross-section of the proton.

=== Nuclear properties (deuteron) ===

==== Deuteron mass and radius ====
The deuterium nucleus is called a deuteron. It has a mass of (just over ).

The charge radius of a deuteron is 

Like the proton radius, measurements using muonic deuterium produce a smaller result: .

==== Spin and energy ====

Deuterium is one of only five stable nuclides with an odd number of protons and an odd number of neutrons. (H, Li, B, N, Ta; the long-lived radionuclides K, V, La, Lu also occur naturally.) Most odd–odd nuclei are unstable to beta decay, because the decay products are even–even, and thus more strongly bound, due to nuclear pairing effects. Deuterium, however, benefits from having its proton and neutron coupled to a spin-1 state, which gives a stronger nuclear attraction; the corresponding spin-1 state does not exist in the two-neutron or two-proton system, due to the Pauli exclusion principle which would require one or the other identical particle with the same spin to have some other different quantum number, such as orbital angular momentum. But orbital angular momentum of either particle gives a lower binding energy for the system, mainly due to increasing distance of the particles in the steep gradient of the nuclear force. In both cases, this causes the diproton and dineutron to be unstable.

The proton and neutron in deuterium can be dissociated through neutral current interactions with neutrinos. The cross section for this interaction is comparatively large, and deuterium was successfully used as a neutrino target in the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory experiment.

Diatomic deuterium (H) has ortho and para nuclear spin isomers like diatomic hydrogen, but with differences in the number and population of spin states and rotational levels, which occur because the deuteron is a boson with nuclear spin equal to one.

====Isospin singlet state of the deuteron ====
Due to the similarity in mass and nuclear properties between the proton and neutron, they are sometimes considered as two symmetric types of the same object, a nucleon. While only the proton has electric charge, this is often negligible due to the weakness of the electromagnetic interaction relative to the strong nuclear interaction. The symmetry relating the proton and neutron is known as isospin and denoted &quot;I&quot; (or sometimes &quot;T&quot;).

Isospin is an SU(2) symmetry, like ordinary spin, so is completely analogous to it. The proton and neutron, each of which have isospin-1/2, form an isospin doublet (analogous to a spin doublet), with a &quot;down&quot; state (↓) being a neutron and an &quot;up&quot; state (↑) being a proton. A pair of nucleons can either be in an antisymmetric state of isospin called singlet, or in a symmetric state called triplet. In terms of the &quot;down&quot; state and &quot;up&quot; state, the singlet is
: formula_1, which can also be written :formula_2

This is a nucleus with one proton and one neutron, i.e. a deuterium nucleus. The triplet is
: formula_3
and thus consists of three types of nuclei, which are supposed to be symmetric: a deuterium nucleus (actually a highly excited state of it), a nucleus with two protons, and a nucleus with two neutrons. These states are not stable.

==== Approximated wavefunction of the deuteron ====
The deuteron wavefunction must be antisymmetric if the isospin representation is used (since a proton and a neutron are not identical particles, the wavefunction need not be antisymmetric in general). Apart from their isospin, the two nucleons also have spin and spatial distributions of their wavefunction. The latter is symmetric if the deuteron is symmetric under parity (i.e. has an &quot;even&quot; or &quot;positive&quot; parity), and antisymmetric if the deuteron is antisymmetric under parity (i.e. has an &quot;odd&quot; or &quot;negative&quot; parity). The parity is fully determined by the total orbital angular momentum of the two nucleons: if it is even then the parity is even (positive), and if it is odd then the parity is odd (negative).

The deuteron, being an isospin singlet, is antisymmetric under nucleons exchange due to isospin, and therefore must be symmetric under the double exchange of their spin and location. Therefore, it can be in either of the following two different states:
* Symmetric spin and symmetric under parity. In this case, the exchange of the two nucleons will multiply the deuterium wavefunction by (−1) from isospin exchange, (+1) from spin exchange and (+1) from parity (location exchange), for a total of (−1) as needed for antisymmetry.
* Antisymmetric spin and antisymmetric under parity. In this case, the exchange of the two nucleons will multiply the deuterium wavefunction by (−1) from isospin exchange, (−1) from spin exchange and (−1) from parity (location exchange), again for a total of (−1) as needed for antisymmetry.

In the first case the deuteron is a spin triplet, so that its total spin &quot;s&quot; is 1. It also has an even parity and therefore even orbital angular momentum &quot;l&quot;. The lower its orbital angular momentum, the lower its energy. Therefore, the lowest possible energy state has , .

In the second case the deuteron is a spin singlet, so that its total spin &quot;s&quot; is 0. It also has an odd parity and therefore odd orbital angular momentum &quot;l&quot;. Therefore, the lowest possible energy state has , .

Since gives a stronger nuclear attraction, the deuterium ground state is in the , state.

The same considerations lead to the possible states of an isospin triplet having , or , . Thus, the state of lowest energy has , , higher than that of the isospin singlet.

The analysis just given is in fact only approximate, both because isospin is not an exact symmetry, and more importantly because the strong nuclear interaction between the two nucleons is related to angular momentum in spin–orbit interaction that mixes different &quot;s&quot; and &quot;l&quot; states. That is, &quot;s&quot; and &quot;l&quot; are not constant in time (they do not commute with the Hamiltonian), and over time a state such as , may become a state of , . Parity is still constant in time, so these do not mix with odd &quot;l&quot; states (such as , ). Therefore, the quantum state of the deuterium is a superposition (a linear combination) of the , state and the , state, even though the first component is much bigger. Since the total angular momentum &quot;j&quot; is also a good quantum number (it is a constant in time), both components must have the same &quot;j&quot;, and therefore . This is the total spin of the deuterium nucleus.

To summarize, the deuterium nucleus is antisymmetric in terms of isospin, and has spin 1 and even (+1) parity. The relative angular momentum of its nucleons &quot;l&quot; is not well defined, and the deuteron is a superposition of mostly with some .

==== Magnetic and electric multipoles ====
In order to find theoretically the deuterium magnetic dipole moment &quot;μ&quot;, one uses the formula for a nuclear magnetic moment
: formula_4
with
: formula_5
&quot;g&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are &quot;g&quot;-factors of the nucleons.

Since the proton and neutron have different values for &quot;g&quot; and &quot;g&quot;, one must separate their contributions. Each gets half of the deuterium orbital angular momentum formula_6 and spin formula_7. One arrives at
: formula_8
where subscripts p and n stand for the proton and neutron, and .

By using the same identities as here and using the value , one gets the following result, in units of the nuclear magneton &quot;μ&quot;
: formula_9

For the , state (), we obtain
: formula_10

For the , state (), we obtain
: formula_11

The measured value of the deuterium magnetic dipole moment, is , which is 97.5% of the value obtained by simply adding moments of the proton and neutron. This suggests that the state of the deuterium is indeed to a good approximation , state, which occurs with both nucleons spinning in the same direction, but their magnetic moments subtracting because of the neutron&#x27;s negative moment.

But the slightly lower experimental number than that which results from simple addition of proton and (negative) neutron moments shows that deuterium is actually a linear combination of mostly , state with a slight admixture of , state.

The electric dipole is zero as usual.

The measured electric quadrupole of the deuterium is . While the order of magnitude is reasonable, since the deuteron radius is of order of 1 femtometer (see below) and its electric charge is e, the above model does not suffice for its computation. More specifically, the electric quadrupole does not get a contribution from the state (which is the dominant one) and does get a contribution from a term mixing the and the states, because the electric quadrupole operator does not commute with angular momentum.

The latter contribution is dominant in the absence of a pure contribution, but cannot be calculated without knowing the exact spatial form of the nucleons wavefunction inside the deuterium.

Higher magnetic and electric multipole moments cannot be calculated by the above model, for similar reasons.

== Applications ==
=== Nuclear reactors ===

Deuterium is used in heavy water moderated fission reactors, usually as liquid HO, to slow neutrons without the high neutron absorption of ordinary hydrogen. This is a common commercial use for larger amounts of deuterium.

In research reactors, liquid H is used in cold sources to moderate neutrons to very low energies and wavelengths appropriate for scattering experiments.

Experimentally, deuterium is the most common nuclide used in fusion reactor designs, especially in combination with tritium, because of the large reaction rate (or nuclear cross section) and high energy yield of the deuterium–tritium (DT) reaction. There is an even higher-yield H–He fusion reaction, though the breakeven point of H–He is higher than that of most other fusion reactions; together with the scarcity of He, this makes it implausible as a practical power source, at least until DT and deuterium–deuterium (DD) fusion have been performed on a commercial scale. Commercial nuclear fusion is not yet an accomplished technology.

=== NMR spectroscopy ===
Deuterium is most commonly used in hydrogen nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (proton NMR) in the following way. NMR ordinarily requires compounds of interest to be analyzed as dissolved in solution. Because of deuterium&#x27;s nuclear spin properties which differ from the light hydrogen usually present in organic molecules, NMR spectra of hydrogen/protium are highly differentiable from that of deuterium, and in practice deuterium is not &quot;seen&quot; by an NMR instrument tuned for H. Deuterated solvents (including heavy water, but also compounds like deuterated chloroform, CDCl or CHCl, are therefore routinely used in NMR spectroscopy, in order to allow only the light-hydrogen spectra of the compound of interest to be measured, without solvent-signal interference.

Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy can also be used to obtain information about the deuteron&#x27;s environment in isotopically labelled samples (deuterium NMR). For example, the configuration of hydrocarbon chains in lipid bilayers can be quantified using solid state deuterium NMR with deuterium-labelled lipid molecules.

Deuterium NMR spectra are especially informative in the solid state because of its relatively small quadrupole moment in comparison with those of bigger quadrupolar nuclei such as chlorine-35, for example.

=== Mass spectrometry ===
Deuterated (i.e. where all or some hydrogen atoms are replaced with deuterium) compounds are often used as internal standards in mass spectrometry. Like other isotopically labeled species, such standards improve accuracy, while often at a much lower cost than other isotopically labeled standards. Deuterated molecules are usually prepared via hydrogen isotope exchange reactions.

=== Tracing ===

In chemistry, biochemistry and environmental sciences, deuterium is used as a non-radioactive, stable isotopic tracer, for example, in the doubly labeled water test. In chemical reactions and metabolic pathways, deuterium behaves somewhat similarly to ordinary hydrogen (with a few chemical differences, as noted). It can be distinguished from normal hydrogen most easily by its mass, using mass spectrometry or infrared spectrometry. Deuterium can be detected by femtosecond infrared spectroscopy, since the mass difference drastically affects the frequency of molecular vibrations; H–carbon bond vibrations are found in spectral regions free of other signals.

Measurements of small variations in the natural abundances of deuterium, along with those of the stable heavy oxygen isotopes O and O, are of importance in hydrology, to trace the geographic origin of Earth&#x27;s waters. The heavy isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen in rainwater (meteoric water) are enriched as a function of the environmental temperature of the region in which the precipitation falls (and thus enrichment is related to latitude). The relative enrichment of the heavy isotopes in rainwater (as referenced to mean ocean water), when plotted against temperature falls predictably along a line called the global meteoric water line (GMWL). This plot allows samples of precipitation-originated water to be identified along with general information about the climate in which it originated. Evaporative and other processes in bodies of water, and also ground water processes, also differentially alter the ratios of heavy hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in fresh and salt waters, in characteristic and often regionally distinctive ways. The ratio of concentration of H to H is usually indicated with a delta as δH and the geographic patterns of these values are plotted in maps termed as isoscapes. Stable isotopes are incorporated into plants and animals and an analysis of the ratios in a migrant bird or insect can help suggest a rough guide to their origins.

=== Contrast properties ===
Neutron scattering techniques particularly profit from availability of deuterated samples: The H and H cross sections are very distinct and different in sign, which allows contrast variation in such experiments. Further, a nuisance problem of normal hydrogen is its large incoherent neutron cross section, which is nil for H. The substitution of deuterium for normal hydrogen thus reduces scattering noise.

Hydrogen is an important and major component in all materials of organic chemistry and life science, but it barely interacts with X-rays. As hydrogen atoms (including deuterium) interact strongly with neutrons; neutron scattering techniques, together with a modern deuteration facility, fills a niche in many studies of macromolecules in biology and many other areas.

=== Nuclear weapons ===
See below. Most stars, including the Sun, generate energy over most of their lives by fusing hydrogen into heavier elements; yet such fusion of light hydrogen (protium) has never been successful in the conditions attainable on Earth. Thus, all artificial fusion, including the hydrogen fusion in hydrogen bombs, requires heavy hydrogen (deuterium, tritium, or both).

=== Drugs ===

A deuterated drug is a small molecule medicinal product in which one or more of the hydrogen atoms in the drug molecule have been replaced by deuterium. Because of the kinetic isotope effect, deuterium-containing drugs may have significantly lower rates of metabolism, and hence a longer half-life. In 2017, deutetrabenazine became the first deuterated drug to receive FDA approval.

=== Reinforced essential nutrients ===
Deuterium can be used to reinforce specific oxidation-vulnerable C–H bonds within essential or conditionally essential nutrients, such as certain amino acids, or polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), making them more resistant to oxidative damage. Deuterated polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as linoleic acid, slow down the chain reaction of lipid peroxidation that damage living cells. Deuterated ethyl ester of linoleic acid (RT001), developed by Retrotope, is in a compassionate use trial in infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy and has successfully completed a Phase I/II trial in Friedreich&#x27;s ataxia.

=== Thermostabilization ===
Live vaccines, such as oral polio vaccine, can be stabilized by deuterium, either alone or in combination with other stabilizers such as MgCl.

=== Slowing circadian oscillations ===
Deuterium has been shown to lengthen the period of oscillation of the circadian clock when dosed in rats, hamsters, and Gonyaulax dinoflagellates. In rats, chronic intake of 25% HO disrupts circadian rhythm by lengthening the circadian period of suprachiasmatic nucleus-dependent rhythms in the brain&#x27;s hypothalamus. Experiments in hamsters also support the theory that deuterium acts directly on the suprachiasmatic nucleus to lengthen the free-running circadian period.

== History ==

=== Suspicion of lighter element isotopes ===
The existence of nonradioactive isotopes of lighter elements had been suspected in studies of neon as early as 1913, and proven by mass spectrometry of light elements in 1920. At that time the neutron had not yet been discovered, and the prevailing theory was that isotopes of an element differ by the existence of additional &quot;protons&quot; in the nucleus accompanied by an equal number of &quot;nuclear electrons&quot;. In this theory, the deuterium nucleus with mass two and charge one would contain two protons and one nuclear electron. However, it was expected that the element hydrogen with a measured average atomic mass very close to , the known mass of the proton, always has a nucleus composed of a single proton (a known particle), and could not contain a second proton. Thus, hydrogen was thought to have no heavy isotopes.

=== Deuterium detected ===
It was first detected spectroscopically in late 1931 by Harold Urey, a chemist at Columbia University. Urey&#x27;s collaborator, Ferdinand Brickwedde, distilled five liters of cryogenically produced liquid hydrogen to of liquid, using the low-temperature physics laboratory that had recently been established at the National Bureau of Standards (now National Institute of Standards and Technology) in Washington, DC. The technique had previously been used to isolate heavy isotopes of neon. The cryogenic boiloff technique concentrated the fraction of the mass-2 isotope of hydrogen to a degree that made its spectroscopic identification unambiguous.

=== Naming of the isotope and Nobel Prize ===
Urey created the names &quot;protium&quot;, &quot;deuterium&quot;, and &quot;tritium&quot; in an article published in 1934. The name is based in part on advice from Gilbert N. Lewis who had proposed the name &quot;deutium&quot;. The name comes from Greek &quot;deuteros&quot; &#x27;second&#x27;, and the nucleus was to be called a &quot;deuteron&quot; or &quot;deuton&quot;. Isotopes and new elements were traditionally given the name that their discoverer decided. Some British scientists, such as Ernest Rutherford, wanted to call the isotope &quot;diplogen&quot;, from Greek &quot;diploos&quot; &#x27;double&#x27;, and the nucleus to be called &quot;diplon&quot;.

The amount inferred for normal abundance of deuterium was so small (only about 1 atom in 6400 hydrogen atoms in seawater [156 parts per million]) that it had not noticeably affected previous measurements of (average) hydrogen atomic mass. This explained why it hadn&#x27;t been suspected before. Urey was able to concentrate water to show partial enrichment of deuterium. Lewis, Urey&#x27;s graduate advisor at Berkeley, had prepared and characterized the first samples of pure heavy water in 1933. The discovery of deuterium, coming before the discovery of the neutron in 1932, was an experimental shock to theory; but when the neutron was reported, making deuterium&#x27;s existence more explicable, Urey was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry only three years after the isotope&#x27;s isolation. Lewis was deeply disappointed by the Nobel Committee&#x27;s decision in 1934 and several high-ranking administrators at Berkeley believed this disappointment played a central role in his suicide a decade later.

=== &quot;Heavy water&quot; experiments in World War II ===

Shortly before the war, Hans von Halban and Lew Kowarski moved their research on neutron moderation from France to Britain, smuggling the entire global supply of heavy water (which had been made in Norway) across in twenty-six steel drums.

During World War II, Nazi Germany was known to be conducting experiments using heavy water as moderator for a nuclear reactor design. Such experiments were a source of concern because they might allow them to produce plutonium for an atomic bomb. Ultimately it led to the Allied operation called the &quot;Norwegian heavy water sabotage&quot;, the purpose of which was to destroy the Vemork deuterium production/enrichment facility in Norway. At the time this was considered important to the potential progress of the war.

After World War II ended, the Allies discovered that Germany was not putting as much serious effort into the program as had been previously thought. The Germans had completed only a small, partly built experimental reactor (which had been hidden away) and had been unable to sustain a chain reaction. By the end of the war, the Germans did not even have a fifth of the amount of heavy water needed to run the reactor, partially due to the Norwegian heavy water sabotage operation. However, even if the Germans had succeeded in getting a reactor operational (as the U.S. did with Chicago Pile-1 in late 1942), they would still have been at least several years away from the development of an atomic bomb. The engineering process, even with maximal effort and funding, required about two and a half years (from first critical reactor to bomb) in both the U.S. and U.S.S.R., for example.

=== In thermonuclear weapons ===

The 62-ton Ivy Mike device built by the United States and exploded on 1 November 1952, was the first fully successful hydrogen bomb (thermonuclear bomb). In this context, it was the first bomb in which most of the energy released came from nuclear reaction stages that followed the primary nuclear fission stage of the atomic bomb. The Ivy Mike bomb was a factory-like building, rather than a deliverable weapon. At its center, a very large cylindrical, insulated vacuum flask or cryostat, held cryogenic liquid deuterium in a volume of about 1000 liters (160 kilograms in mass, if this volume had been completely filled). Then, a conventional atomic bomb (the &quot;primary&quot;) at one end of the bomb was used to create the conditions of extreme temperature and pressure that were needed to set off the thermonuclear reaction.

Within a few years, so-called &quot;dry&quot; hydrogen bombs were developed that did not need cryogenic hydrogen. Released information suggests that all thermonuclear weapons built since then contain chemical compounds of deuterium and lithium in their secondary stages. The material that contains the deuterium is mostly lithium deuteride, with the lithium consisting of the isotope lithium-6. When the lithium-6 is bombarded with fast neutrons from the atomic bomb, tritium (hydrogen-3) is produced, and then the deuterium and the tritium quickly engage in thermonuclear fusion, releasing abundant energy, helium-4, and even more free neutrons. &quot;Pure&quot; fusion weapons such as the Tsar Bomba are believed to be obsolete. In most modern (&quot;boosted&quot;) thermonuclear weapons, fusion directly provides only a small fraction of the total energy. Fission of a natural uranium-238 tamper by fast neutrons produced from D–T fusion accounts for a much larger (i.e. boosted) energy release than the fusion reaction itself.

=== Modern research ===
In August 2018, scientists announced the transformation of gaseous deuterium into a liquid metallic form. This may help researchers better understand gas giant planets, such as Jupiter, Saturn and some exoplanets, since such planets are thought to contain a lot of liquid metallic hydrogen, which may be responsible for their observed powerful magnetic fields.

== Antideuterium ==
An antideuteron is the antimatter counterpart of the deuteron, consisting of an antiproton and an antineutron. The antideuteron was first produced in 1965 at the Proton Synchrotron at CERN and the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron at Brookhaven National Laboratory. A complete atom, with a positron orbiting the nucleus, would be called &quot;antideuterium&quot;, but antideuterium has not yet been created. The proposed symbol for antideuterium is , that is, D with an overbar.

<text>Digital signal processing (DSP) is the use of digital processing, such as by computers or more specialized digital signal processors, to perform a wide variety of signal processing operations. The digital signals processed in this manner are a sequence of numbers that represent samples of a continuous variable in a domain such as time, space, or frequency. In digital electronics, a digital signal is represented as a pulse train, which is typically generated by the switching of a transistor.

Digital signal processing and analog signal processing are subfields of signal processing. DSP applications include audio and speech processing, sonar, radar and other sensor array processing, spectral density estimation, statistical signal processing, digital image processing, data compression, video coding, audio coding, image compression, signal processing for telecommunications, control systems, biomedical engineering, and seismology, among others.

DSP can involve linear or nonlinear operations. Nonlinear signal processing is closely related to nonlinear system identification and can be implemented in the time, frequency, and spatio-temporal domains.

The application of digital computation to signal processing allows for many advantages over analog processing in many applications, such as error detection and correction in transmission as well as data compression. Digital signal processing is also fundamental to digital technology, such as digital telecommunication and wireless communications. DSP is applicable to both streaming data and static (stored) data.

== Signal sampling ==
To digitally analyze and manipulate an analog signal, it must be digitized with an analog-to-digital converter (ADC). Sampling is usually carried out in two stages, discretization and quantization. Discretization means that the signal is divided into equal intervals of time, and each interval is represented by a single measurement of amplitude. Quantization means each amplitude measurement is approximated by a value from a finite set. Rounding real numbers to integers is an example.

The Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem states that a signal can be exactly reconstructed from its samples if the sampling frequency is greater than twice the highest frequency component in the signal. In practice, the sampling frequency is often significantly higher than this. It is common to use an anti-aliasing filter to limit the signal bandwidth to comply with the sampling theorem, however careful selection of this filter is required because the reconstructed signal will be the filtered signal plus residual aliasing from imperfect stop band rejection instead of the original (unfiltered) signal.

Theoretical DSP analyses and derivations are typically performed on discrete-time signal models with no amplitude inaccuracies (quantization error), created by the abstract process of sampling. Numerical methods require a quantized signal, such as those produced by an ADC. The processed result might be a frequency spectrum or a set of statistics. But often it is another quantized signal that is converted back to analog form by a digital-to-analog converter (DAC).

== Domains ==
DSP engineers usually study digital signals in one of the following domains: time domain (one-dimensional signals), spatial domain (multidimensional signals), frequency domain, and wavelet domains. They choose the domain in which to process a signal by making an informed assumption (or by trying different possibilities) as to which domain best represents the essential characteristics of the signal and the processing to be applied to it. A sequence of samples from a measuring device produces a temporal or spatial domain representation, whereas a discrete Fourier transform produces the frequency domain representation.

=== Time and space domains ===
Time domain refers to the analysis of signals with respect to time. Similarly, space domain refers to the analysis of signals with respect to position, e.g., pixel location for the case of image processing.

The most common processing approach in the time or space domain is enhancement of the input signal through a method called filtering. Digital filtering generally consists of some linear transformation of a number of surrounding samples around the current sample of the input or output signal. The surrounding samples may be identified with respect to time or space. The output of a linear digital filter to any given input may be calculated by convolving the input signal with an impulse response.

=== Frequency domain ===
Signals are converted from time or space domain to the frequency domain usually through use of the Fourier transform. The Fourier transform converts the time or space information to a magnitude and phase component of each frequency. With some applications, how the phase varies with frequency can be a significant consideration. Where phase is unimportant, often the Fourier transform is converted to the power spectrum, which is the magnitude of each frequency component squared.

The most common purpose for analysis of signals in the frequency domain is analysis of signal properties. The engineer can study the spectrum to determine which frequencies are present in the input signal and which are missing. Frequency domain analysis is also called &quot;spectrum-&quot; or &quot;spectral analysis&quot;.

Filtering, particularly in non-realtime work can also be achieved in the frequency domain, applying the filter and then converting back to the time domain. This can be an efficient implementation and can give essentially any filter response including excellent approximations to brickwall filters.

There are some commonly used frequency domain transformations. For example, the cepstrum converts a signal to the frequency domain through Fourier transform, takes the logarithm, then applies another Fourier transform. This emphasizes the harmonic structure of the original spectrum.

===Z-plane analysis===
Digital filters come in both infinite impulse response (IIR) and finite impulse response (FIR) types. Whereas FIR filters are always stable, IIR filters have feedback loops that may become unstable and oscillate. The Z-transform provides a tool for analyzing stability issues of digital IIR filters. It is analogous to the Laplace transform, which is used to design and analyze analog IIR filters.

===Autoregression analysis===
A signal is represented as linear combination of its previous samples. Coefficients of the combination are called autoregression coefficients. This method has higher frequency resolution and can process shorter signals compared to the Fourier transform. Prony&#x27;s method can be used to estimate phases, amplitudes, initial phases and decays of the components of signal. Components are assumed to be complex decaying exponents.

===Time-frequency analysis===
A time-frequency representation of signal can capture both temporal evolution and frequency structure of analyzed signal. Temporal and frequency resolution are limited by the principle of uncertainty and the tradeoff is adjusted by the width of analysis window. Linear techniques such as Short-time Fourier transform, wavelet transform, filter bank, non-linear (e.g., Wigner–Ville transform) and autoregressive methods (e.g. segmented Prony method) are used for representation of signal on the time-frequency plane. Non-linear and segmented Prony methods can provide higher resolution, but may produce undesirable artifacts. Time-frequency analysis is usually used for analysis of non-stationary signals. For example, methods of fundamental frequency estimation, such as RAPT and PEFAC are based on windowed spectral analysis.

===Wavelet===

In numerical analysis and functional analysis, a discrete wavelet transform is any wavelet transform for which the wavelets are discretely sampled. As with other wavelet transforms, a key advantage it has over Fourier transforms is temporal resolution: it captures both frequency &quot;and&quot; location information. The accuracy of the joint time-frequency resolution is limited by the uncertainty principle of time-frequency.

===Empirical mode decomposition===
Empirical mode decomposition is based on decomposition signal into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). IMFs are quasi-harmonical oscillations that are extracted from the signal.

== Implementation ==
DSP algorithms may be run on general-purpose computers and digital signal processors. DSP algorithms are also implemented on purpose-built hardware such as application-specific integrated circuit (ASICs). Additional technologies for digital signal processing include more powerful general-purpose microprocessors, graphics processing units, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), digital signal controllers (mostly for industrial applications such as motor control), and stream processors.

For systems that do not have a real-time computing requirement and the signal data (either input or output) exists in data files, processing may be done economically with a general-purpose computer. This is essentially no different from any other data processing, except DSP mathematical techniques (such as the DCT and FFT) are used, and the sampled data is usually assumed to be uniformly sampled in time or space. An example of such an application is processing digital photographs with software such as Photoshop.

When the application requirement is real-time, DSP is often implemented using specialized or dedicated processors or microprocessors, sometimes using multiple processors or multiple processing cores. These may process data using fixed-point arithmetic or floating point. For more demanding applications FPGAs may be used. For the most demanding applications or high-volume products, ASICs might be designed specifically for the application.

Parallel implementations of DSP algorithms, utilizing multi-core CPU and many-core GPU architectures, are developed to improve the performances in terms of latency of these algorithms.

 is done by the computer&#x27;s CPU rather than by DSP or outboard processing, which is done by additional third-party DSP chips located on extension cards or external hardware boxes or racks. Many digital audio workstations such as Logic Pro, Cubase, Digital Performer and Pro Tools LE use native processing. Others, such as Pro Tools HD, Universal Audio&#x27;s UAD-1 and TC Electronic&#x27;s Powercore use DSP processing.

<doc id="8527" wikidata="Q7340" url="?curid=8527" title="Discordianism">
<text>Discordianism is a belief system based around Eris, the Greek goddess of strife and discord, and variously defined as a religion, new religious movement, virtual religion, or act of social commentary; though prior to 2005, some sources categorized it as a parody religion. It was founded after the 1963 publication of its holy book, &quot;Principia Discordia&quot;, written by Greg Hill with Kerry Wendell Thornley, the two working under the pseudonyms Malaclypse the Younger and Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst.

David Chidester considers Discordianism to be the first virtual religion and the first to take up the challenge of establishing its religious authenticity. When the Yahoo search engine categorized Discordianism as a parody religion, in May 2001 Discordians started an email campaign to get the religion reclassified. It is difficult to estimate the number of Discordians because they are not required to hold Discordianism as their only belief system.

According to Arthur Versluis, Discordianism &quot;both shaped and reflects the counterculture of the 1960s and 1970s&quot;.

== Founding and structure ==
The foundational document of Discordianism is &quot;Principia Discordia&quot;, fourth edition (1970), written by Malaclypse the Younger, an alias of Gregory Hill. &quot;Principia Discordia&quot; often hints that Discordianism was founded as a dialectic antithesis to more popular religions based on order, although the rhetoric throughout the book describes chaos as a much more underlying impulse of the universe. This may have been done with the intention of merely &quot;balancing out&quot; the creative forces of order and disorder, but the focus is on the more disorderly aspects of the world — at times the forces of order are even vilified. Disharmony is particularly emphasized, along with its relation to harmony.

===Organizations===
====Discordian Society====
The most general group, presumably including all Discordians (and potentially others), is the Discordian Society, whose definition is &quot;The Discordian Society has no definition&quot;. Its members include many adherents of Neopaganism and Thelema.

====POEE====
The sect of Discordianism founded by Malaclypse the Younger and Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst is known as the Paratheo-Anametamystikhood of Eris Esoteric (POEE), a non-prophet irreligious disorganisation. &quot;Principia Discordia&quot; contains some details about the structure of POEE. In particular:

=== Episkopos ===
Episkoposes are the overseers of sects of Discordianism which they have created. They speak to Eris through the use of their pineal gland. It is said in &quot;Principia Discordia&quot; that Eris says different things to each listener. She may even say radically different things to each Episkopos, but all of what she says is equally her word (even if it contradicts another iteration of her word).

=== Popes ===
According to &quot;Principia Discordia&quot;, &quot;every single man, woman, and child on this Earth&quot; is a pope. Included in &quot;Principia Discordia&quot; is an official Pope card that may be reproduced and distributed freely to anyone and everyone.

===Saints===

There are also five classes of saints within Discordianism, who are those who best act as exemplars and are closer to perfection. Only the first of these classes &quot;Saint Second Class&quot; contains real human beings (deceased and alive), with higher classes reserved for fictional beings who, by virtue of being fictional, are better able to reach the Discordian view of perfection.

An example of a second-class saint is Emperor Norton, a citizen in 19th-century San Francisco, who despite suffering delusions was beloved by much of the city. He is honoured as a saint within Discordianism for living his life according to truth as he saw it and a disregard for reality as others would perceive it.

===Other===
Since the first edition, various approaches to a Discordian organization chart – called in the work is &quot;disorganization&quot; and later &quot;disorganizational matrix&quot; – have differed from volume to volume, but have included especially the House of the Apostles of Eris, which is inclusive of the founders as the Apostles, of the Golden Apple Corps and Holders of the Sacred Chao, of the priesthood and saints, of the episkoposes, and even of &quot;heretical&quot; or &quot;protestant&quot; internal opponents of some of these, but not inclusive of the popes, legionnaires, disciples, and various other parties. A variety of other notional organizations were renamed and shuffled around and often enough replaced, as part of POEE (which did not appear in the first edition). But the House of the Apostles of Eris continued to be credited as the sanctioning body of the later editions, and remained the top division of the POEE &quot;Eristocracy&quot;.

Another recurrent organizational name is the Legion of Dynamic Discord, inclusive of legionnaires, disciples, and evangelists. LODD was also introduced in the first edition and survived throughout later versions (as an element of POEE&#x27;s House of the Rising Podge for the Disciples), as well as in works less centrally associated with Discordianism, such &quot;The Zenarchist&#x27;s Cookbook&quot; which integrates some elements of Thornley&#x27;s Zenarchy material and is dedicated (in an obfuscatory introduction) to the LODD.

== Mythology ==
===Eris and Aneris and their brother Spirituality===
In Discordian mythology, Aneris is described as the sister of Eris a.k.a. Discordia. Whereas Eris/Discordia is the goddess of disorder and being, Aneris/Harmonia is the goddess of order and non-being.

&quot;DOGMA III – HISTORY 32, &#x27;COSMOGONY in &quot;Principia Discordia&quot;, states:

The sterile Aneris becomes jealous of Eris (who was born pregnant), and starts making existent things non-existent. This explains why life begins, and later ends in death:

However, the Void decrees that Aneris may not absorb her brother Spirituality, that he can only be absorbed back into the Void itself. Cusack points out that this is &quot;distilled into a teaching about the ultimate fate of humans: &#x27;so it shall be that non-existence shall take us back from existence and that nameless spirituality shall return to the Void, like a tired child home from a very wild circus.&#x27;&quot;

===Hand of Eris===
The &quot;five-fingered hand of Eris&quot; (shown at right) is one of several symbols used in Discordianism. It was adapted as an astronomical/astrological symbol for the dwarf planet Eris. Initially, the planetary symbol, designed by Discordian Denis Moskowitz, was rotated 90 degrees and had a cross-bar added so that it resembled two lunate epsilons (Є) back-to-back (), with epsilon being the Greek initial of &quot;Eris&quot;. The cross-bar was later dropped, but the vertical orientation retained. The Hand of Eris has appeared in a public-outreach publication by NASA, though planetary symbols play only a minor role in modern astronomy.

The symbol was accepted by Unicode in 2016 as ().

===Original Snub===

The &quot;Original Snub&quot; is the Discordian name for the events leading up to the judgement of Paris, although more focus is put on the actions of Eris. Zeus believes that Eris is a troublemaker, so he does not invite her to Peleus and Thetis&#x27;s wedding. Having been snubbed, Eris creates a golden apple with the word (, &#x27;for the prettiest&#x27;) inscribed in it. This, the Apple of Discord, is a notable symbol in Discordianism for its inclusion in the Sacred Chao, and is traditionally described as being made of gold.

===Curse of Greyface===
One of the most important parts of Discordianism, the Curse of Greyface features prominently on several pages of the &quot;Principia Discordia&quot;. According to &quot;Principia Discordia&quot;, Greyface was a man who lived in the year 1166 BC and taught that life is serious and play is sin. The curse is the psychological and spiritual imbalance that results from these beliefs, both individually and within groups, nations, and civilizations.

In addition to the generic advice of cultivating the natural love of chaos and playing with Her, the &quot;Principia Discordia&quot; provides &quot;The Turkey Curse Revealed by the Apostle Dr. Van Van Mojo&quot; to counteract the Curse of Greyface. The Turkey Curse is designed to counteract destructive order. It derives its name from the fact that the incantation resembles the sounds of a turkey.

== Theology ==
===Three core principles===
The &quot;Principia Discordia&quot; holds three core principles: the Aneristic and Eristic principles representing order and disorder, and the notion that both are mere illusions.

=== The Pentabarf ===
The Pentabarf are five rules of Discordianism, described by David G. Robertson as &quot;the Discordian take on the Ten Commandments&quot;. As venerators of Eris, Discordian views vary from one person to the next as neither order or disorder, nor chaos are requisites of falling into the Discordian category. The fifth rule is representative of that.

=== Sri Syadasti ===
The third &quot;apostle of Eris &amp; who they be&#x27;s&quot; name, commonly called just Sri Syadasti, is Sanskrit, and means: All affirmations are true in some sense, false in some sense, meaningless in some sense, true and false in some sense, true and meaningless in some sense, false and meaningless in some sense, and true and false and meaningless in some sense.

=== The Sacred Chao ===


A unique symbol created in Discordianism, the Sacred Chao is said to have been devised by the Apostle Hung Mung in ancient China. It is a modified version of the Yin-Yang, a common symbol in Taoism. The Sacred Chao is not the Yin-Yang of the Taoists. On one side of the Sacred Chao is a pentagon and on the other depicts the golden Apple of Discord. The Sacred Chao symbolizes absolutely everything anyone would need to ever know about anything, and more. It even symbolizes everything not worth knowing, depicted by the internal empty space surrounding.

Discordians pronounce &quot;chao&quot; as &quot;cow&quot;, thus making the terms &quot;Sacred Chao&quot;, &quot;Holy Chao&quot;, and &quot;Wholly Chao&quot;, into puns and inside jokes.

=== Operation Mindfuck ===
Operation Mindfuck is an important practice in the Discordian religion, in which &quot;all national calamities, assassinations, or conspiracies&quot; are publicly attributed to the Bavarian Illuminati, an 18th-century secret society, in an attempt to &quot;sow the culture with paranoia&quot;. The concept was developed by Kerry Thornley and Robert Anton Wilson in 1968 and given its name by Wilson and Robert Shea in &quot;The Illuminatus! Trilogy&quot;.

Operation Mindfuck uses many of the recurring themes of Discordianism, including &quot;hidden knowledge, secret societies, chaos magic, ancient cults, mysterious rituals and conspiracy theories&quot;. Stuart Rathbone described it as &quot;a deliberate campaign of revolutionary disinformation&quot; and notes that &quot;many of these topics have had a lasting impact on anarchism, the pseudo-sciences and even mainstream culture.&quot;

==Writings==
Discordian works include a number of books, including &quot;Principia Discordia&quot;, drafted in 1963 and first published in 1965 (which includes portions of &quot;The Honest Book of Truth&quot;); and &quot;The Illuminatus! Trilogy&quot;, which had its first volume published in 1975.

===&quot;Principia Discordia&quot; editions===

The first edition was printed using Jim Garrison&#x27;s Xerox printer in 1963. The second edition was published under the title &quot;Principia Discordia or How The West Was Lost&quot; in a limited edition of five copies (and released into the public domain) in 1965.

In 1978, a copy of the work from Kerry Thornley, under the title &quot;The Principia Discordia or How the West Was Lost&quot;, was placed in the HSCA JFK collections as document 010857. Adam Gorightly said he had been given Greg Hill&#x27;s copy of the first edition. This appeared in its entirety in &quot;Historia Discordia&quot;, a book on Discordian history released in spring of 2014.

=== Related works ===
The Discordian movement encompasses a diverse array of works, both real and fictitious, that explore themes of chaos, satire, and alternative spirituality. These include &quot;Zen Without Zen Masters&quot; by Camden Benares, which presents koans and stories of a Discordian nature, and &quot;Zenarchy&quot; by Kerry Thornley, which proposes a non-combative approach to anarchy infused with Zen philosophy. &quot;Natural Law, or Don&#x27;t Put a Rubber on Your Willy&quot; by Robert Anton Wilson delves into themes of personal freedom and self-awareness, expanding upon Wilson&#x27;s essay originally published in 1985. In addition, there are compilations such as &quot;Apocrypha Discordia&quot; and &quot;Historia Discordia&quot;, which gather diverse materials from the Discordian tradition, including writings by both original and contemporary Discordians.

Several works also explore the lives of key figures within Discordianism, such as &quot;The Prankster and the Conspiracy&quot; by Adam Gorightly, which focuses on Kerry Thornley&#x27;s interactions with countercultural figures like Lee Harvey Oswald. &quot;Chasing Eris&quot; by Brenton Clutterbuck provides an in-depth examination of Discordianism&#x27;s impact on various aspects of culture and society, offering interviews and insights into the movement&#x27;s global reach and influence.

==Religious studies==
Academic interest in Discordianism has grown over the years, with scholars examining its role in the broader context of new religious movements (NRMs) and its reflection of the social and cultural upheavals of the 20th century. The religion’s ability to blur the lines between parody and serious belief has made it a unique subject of study in the field of religious studies and has contributed to ongoing discussions about the nature of religion in the modern world.

The first academic study of Discordianism was David Chidester&#x27;s 2005 book &quot;Authentic Fakes&quot;, who wrote that &quot;If it were possible to trace a genealogy of virtual religions on the Internet, it would probably begin with Discordianism.&quot; According to J. Christian Greer, this study was published just at the time Discordianism had transformed itself from a parody religion to a new religious movement.

The entry for Discordianism in Rabinovitch and Lewis&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopedia of Modern Witchcraft and Neo-Paganism&quot; (2002) defines Discordianism as &quot;somewhere between parody, social commentary, and religion&quot;. However, David G. Robertson writes that &quot;Although Hill and Thornley started Discordianism as a joke, then, they came in time to believe, if not entirely trust, in Eris.&quot; Robertson discusses Discordian theology in the 2012 book &quot;Handbook of New Religions and Cultural Production&quot;, writing that despite Discordian claims that its &quot;catmas&quot; are soft, optional beliefs:

Robertson writes in the 2016 book &quot;Fiction, Invention and Hyper-reality&quot; that:

==Influence==
Discordianism has exerted a notable influence on several facets of counterculture, particularly during the 1960s and 1970s. One of the religion&#x27;s key contributions lies in its challenge to established norms through the use of humor, satire, and paradox. This approach mirrored the broader countercultural movements that sought to upend conventional thinking and embrace new forms of expression.

Discordianism’s foundational text, the &quot;Principia Discordia&quot;, became a cornerstone for other works that blend satire with serious philosophical inquiry. A prime example is Robert Anton Wilson and Robert Shea’s &quot;The Illuminatus! Trilogy&quot; (1975), which played a significant role in spreading Discordian ideas. The trilogy’s mix of conspiracy theory, satire, and occultism deeply resonated with the countercultural mindset and has been credited with influencing later works in both literature and popular culture.

Moreover, Discordianism has impacted the development of NRMs by promoting a model of religious practice that is decentralized, playful, and often ironic. This model has informed other NRMs that prioritize personal spiritual experiences over rigid dogma. In particular, Discordianism&#x27;s embrace of paradox and chaos has inspired movements that reject traditional religious hierarchies in favor of more fluid and adaptable structures.

===In popular culture===

The Discordian phrase &quot;Hail Eris! All Hail Discordia!&quot; can be heard in the background on many rock albums.

<text>Disjunction introduction or addition (also called or introduction) is a rule of inference of propositional logic and almost every other deduction system. The rule makes it possible to introduce disjunctions to logical proofs. It is the inference that if &quot;P&quot; is true, then &quot;P or Q&quot; must be true.

An example in English:
:Socrates is a man.
:Therefore, Socrates is a man or pigs are flying in formation over the English Channel.

The rule can be expressed as:
:formula_1

where the rule is that whenever instances of &quot;formula_2&quot; appear on lines of a proof, &quot;formula_3&quot; can be placed on a subsequent line. 

More generally it&#x27;s also a simple valid argument form, this means that if the premise is true, then the conclusion is also true as any rule of inference should be, and an immediate inference, as it has a single proposition in its premises. 

Disjunction introduction is not a rule in some paraconsistent logics because in combination with other rules of logic, it leads to explosion (i.e. everything becomes provable) and paraconsistent logic tries to avoid explosion and to be able to reason with contradictions. One of the solutions is to introduce disjunction with over rules. See .

== Formal notation ==
The &quot;disjunction introduction&quot; rule may be written in sequent notation:

: formula_4

where formula_5 is a metalogical symbol meaning that formula_3 is a syntactic consequence of formula_2 in some logical system;

and expressed as a truth-functional tautology or theorem of propositional logic:

:formula_8

where formula_2 and formula_10 are propositions expressed in some formal system.

<text>In propositional logic, disjunction elimination (sometimes named proof by cases, case analysis, or or elimination) is the valid argument form and rule of inference that allows one to eliminate a disjunctive statement from a logical proof. It is the inference that if a statement formula_1 implies a statement formula_2 and a statement formula_3 also implies formula_2, then if either formula_1 or formula_3 is true, then formula_2 has to be true. The reasoning is simple: since at least one of the statements P and R is true, and since either of them would be sufficient to entail Q, Q is certainly true.

An example in English:
:If I&#x27;m inside, I have my wallet on me.
:If I&#x27;m outside, I have my wallet on me.
:It is true that either I&#x27;m inside or I&#x27;m outside.
:Therefore, I have my wallet on me.

It is the rule can be stated as:

:formula_8

where the rule is that whenever instances of &quot;formula_9&quot;, and &quot;formula_10&quot; and &quot;formula_11&quot; appear on lines of a proof, &quot;formula_2&quot; can be placed on a subsequent line.

== Formal notation ==
The &quot;disjunction elimination&quot; rule may be written in sequent notation:

: formula_13

where formula_14 is a metalogical symbol meaning that formula_2 is a syntactic consequence of formula_9, and formula_10 and formula_11 in some logical system;

and expressed as a truth-functional tautology or theorem of propositional logic:

:formula_19

where formula_1, formula_2, and formula_3 are propositions expressed in some formal system.

<text>The Dead Sea (, or ; ), also known by other names, is a landlocked salt lake bordered by Jordan to the east, the Israeli-occupied West Bank to the west and Israel to the southwest. It lies in the endorheic basin of the Jordan Rift Valley, and its main tributary is the Jordan River.

As of 2019, the lake&#x27;s surface is below sea level, making its shores the lowest land-based elevation on Earth. It is deep, the deepest hypersaline lake in the world. With a salinity of 342 g/kg, or 34.2% (in 2011), it is one of the world&#x27;s saltiest bodies of water – 9.6 times as salty as the ocean – and has a density of 1.24 kg/litre, which makes swimming similar to floating. This salinity makes for a harsh environment in which plants and animals cannot flourish, hence its name. The Dead Sea&#x27;s main, northern basin is long and wide at its widest point.

The Dead Sea has attracted visitors from around the Mediterranean basin for thousands of years. It was one of the world&#x27;s first health resorts, and it has been the supplier of a wide variety of products, from asphalt for Egyptian mummification to potash for fertilisers. Today, tourists visit the sea on its Israeli, Jordanian and West Bank coastlines.

The Dead Sea is receding at a swift rate; its surface area today is , having been in 1930. Multiple canal and pipeline proposals, such as the scrapped Red Sea–Dead Sea Water Conveyance project, have been made to reduce its recession.
==Names==
The English name &quot;Dead Sea&quot; is a calque of the Arabic name, itself a calque of earlier Greek and Latin names, in reference to the scarcity of aquatic life caused by the lake&#x27;s extreme salinity.
Historical English names include the , from the biblical account of its destruction and from Greek and Latin.

The name &quot;Dead Sea&quot; occasionally appears in Hebrew literature as (), &#x27;Sea of Death&#x27;.
The usual biblical and modern Hebrew name for the lake is the (, ). Other Hebrew names for the lake also mentioned in the Bible are the (, ) and the (, ).

The Arabic name is (), or usually without the article &quot;al-&quot;, so just etc.
It is also known in Arabic as the (, , , or ) from the nephew of Abraham whose wife was said to have turned into a pillar of salt during the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. Less often, it has been known in Arabic as the Sea of Zo&#x27;ar from a formerly important city along its shores.

Because of the large volume of ancient trade in the lake&#x27;s naturally occurring free-floating bitumen, its usual names in ancient Greek and Roman geography were some form of ( or , or ; ) or Sea (, ).
It was also known as the &#x27;Dead Sea&#x27; (Greek , , Latin ().

==Geography==

The Dead Sea is a salt lake is bordered by Jordan to the east and Palestine&#x27;s Israeli-occupied West Bank and Israel to the west. It is an endorheic lake, meaning there are no outlet streams.

The Dead Sea lies in the Jordan Rift Valley, a geographic feature formed by the Dead Sea Transform (DST). This left lateral-moving transform fault lies along the tectonic plate boundary between the African Plate and the Arabian Plate. It runs between the East Anatolian Fault zone in Turkey and the northern end of the Red Sea Rift offshore of the southern tip of Sinai.

Water feeds into the Dead Sea from various sources, many small or intermittent, including:
* Jordan River, international border from the north
* Arava Stream (Wadi Arava), international border from the south
* Wadi Mujib (Arnon Stream), Jordan, Karak Governorate
* Wadi Darga (Wadi Darajeh, Nahal Darga, or Nahal Dragot), West Bank
* Wadi al-Hasa (Brook of Zered), Jordan, boundary between Karak Governorate and Tafilah Governorate
* Nahal Arugot (Wadi Areijeh or Wadi Argot), mouth at Ein Gedi, Israel
* Wadi Wala, Jordan side
* Wadi Zarqa Ma&#x27;in, Jordan side
* Nahal Tur, West Bank
* Groundwater seepage
* Direct rainfall

(Wadi is the Arabic term for a river valley with a small or intermittent stream; &quot;Nahal&quot; is the equivalent in Hebrew. The two terms are often used interchangeably in English names for the same body of water.)

The water of Wadi Hassa is now completely consumed in Jordan. The Jordan River, which passes through the Sea of Galilee, has been substantially diverted. It currently only contributes about one-sixth of the inflow to the Dead Sea, less than direct rainfall.

There are also small perennial springs under and around the Dead Sea, forming pools and quicksand pits along the edges.

The Wadi Mujib valley, 420 m below the sea level in the southern part of the Jordan valley, is a biosphere reserve, with an area of .
Rainfall is scarcely per year in the northern part of the Dead Sea and barely in the southern part. The Dead Sea zone&#x27;s aridity is due to the rainshadow effect of the Judaean Mountains. The highlands east of the Dead Sea receive more rainfall than the Dead Sea itself.

To the west of the Dead Sea, the Judaean mountains rise less steeply and are much lower than the mountains to the east. Along the southwestern side of the lake is a tall halite mineral formation called Mount Sodom.

==Geology==

===Formation theories===
There are two contending hypotheses about the origin of the low elevation of the Dead Sea. The older hypothesis is that the Dead Sea lies in a true rift zone, an extension of the Red Sea Rift, or even of the Great Rift Valley of eastern Africa. A more recent hypothesis is that the Dead Sea basin is a consequence of a &quot;step-over&quot; discontinuity along the Dead Sea Transform, creating an extension of the crust with consequent subsidence.

===Sedom Lagoon===
During the late Pliocene-early Pleistocene, what is now the valley of the Jordan River, Dead Sea, and the northern Wadi Arabah was repeatedly inundated by waters from the Mediterranean Sea. The waters formed in a narrow, crooked bay that is called by geologists the Sedom Lagoon, which was connected to the sea through what is now the Jezreel Valley. The floods of the valley came and went depending on long-scale changes in the tectonic and climatic conditions.

The Sedom Lagoon extended at its maximum from the Sea of Galilee in the north to somewhere around south of the current southern end of the Dead Sea, and the subsequent lakes never surpassed this expanse. The Hula Depression was never part of any of these water bodies due to its higher elevation and the high threshold of the Korazim block separating it from the Sea of Galilee basin.

===Salt deposits===
The Sedom Lagoon deposited evaporites mainly consisting of rock salt, which eventually reached a thickness of on the old basin floor in the area of today&#x27;s Mount Sedom.

===Lake formation===
According to Kafri, during the late Neogene, i.e. in the Pliocene (ended c. 2.5 million years ago), the eustatic sea level was at 50–100 metres above the current sea level, thus flooding the northern valleys connecting the Mediterranean Sea with the Jordan Rift Valley, which led to the creation of a crooked-shaped lagoon. This high eustatic sea level situation subsequently came to an end, and the ocean could no longer flood the area. Thus, the long lagoon became a landlocked lake, which – due to the high evaporation rate – retreated toward the lower, southern part of the rift valley. However, Mordechai Stein considers the formation process as not yet clarified, speaking of a late Pliocene-early Pleistocene process in which tectonics might also have played a part in blocking water ingression from the Mediterranean to its former bay or lagoon.

The first prehistoric lake to follow the Sedom Lagoon is named Lake Amora (which possibly appeared in the early Pleistocene; its sediments developed into the Amora (Samra) Formation, dated to over 200–80 kyr BP), followed by Lake Lisan (c. 70–14 kyr) and finally by the Dead Sea.

===Lake salinity===
The water levels and salinity of the successive lakes (Amora, Lisan, Dead Sea) have either risen or fallen as an effect of the tectonic dropping of the valley bottom, and due to climate variation. As the climate became more arid, Lake Lisan finally shrank and became saltier, leaving the Dead Sea as its last remainder.

From 70,000 to 12,000 years ago, Lake Lisan&#x27;s level was higher than its current level, possibly due to lower evaporation than in the present. Its level fluctuated dramatically, rising to its highest level around 26,000 years ago, indicating a very wet climate in the Near East. Around 10,000 years ago, the lake&#x27;s level dropped dramatically, probably even lower than today. During the last several thousand years, the lake has fluctuated approximately , with some significant drops and rises. Current theories as to the cause of this dramatic drop in levels rule out volcanic activity; therefore, it may have been a seismic event.

===Salt mounts formation===
In prehistoric times, great amounts of sediment collected on the floor of Lake Amora. The sediment was heavier than the salt deposits and squeezed the salt deposits upwards into what are now the Lisan Peninsula and Mount Sodom (on the southwest side of the lake). Geologists explain the effect in terms of a bucket of mud into which a large flat stone is placed, forcing the mud to creep up the sides of the bucket. When the floor of the Dead Sea dropped further due to tectonic forces, the salt mounts of Lisan and Mount Sodom stayed in place as high cliffs (see salt dome).

==Climate==
The Dead Sea has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh), with year-round sunny skies and dry air. It has less than mean annual rainfall and a summer average temperature between . Winter average temperatures range between . The region has weaker ultraviolet radiation, particularly the UVB (erythrogenic rays). Given the higher atmospheric pressure, the air has a slightly higher oxygen content (3.3% in summer to 4.8% in winter) as compared to oxygen concentration at sea level. Barometric pressures at the Dead Sea were measured between 1061 and 1065 hPa and clinically compared with health effects at higher altitude. (This barometric measure is about 5% higher than sea level standard atmospheric pressure of 1013.25 hPa, which is the global ocean mean or ATM.) The Dead Sea affects temperatures nearby because of the moderating effect a large body of water has on climate. During the winter, sea temperatures tend to be higher than land temperatures, and vice versa during the summer months. This is the result of the water&#x27;s mass and specific heat capacity. On average, there are 192 days above annually.

==Chemistry==

With 34.2% salinity (in 2011), it is one of the world&#x27;s saltiest bodies of water, though Lake Vanda in Antarctica (35%), Lake Assal in Djibouti (34.8%), Lagoon Garabogazköl in the Caspian Sea (up to 35%) and some hypersaline ponds and lakes of the McMurdo Dry Valleys in Antarctica (such as Don Juan Pond (44%)) have reported higher salinities.

In the 19th century and the early 20th century, the surface layers of the Dead Sea were less salty than today, which resulted in an average density in the range of 1.15–1.17 g/cm3 instead of the present value of around 1.25 g/cm3. A sample tested by Bernays in the 19th century had a salinity of 19%. By the year 1926, the salinity had increased (although it was also suspected that the salinity varies seasonally and depends on the distance from the mouth of the Jordan).

Until the winter of 1978–79, when a major mixing event took place, the Dead Sea was composed of two stratified layers of water that differed in temperature, density, age, and salinity. The topmost or so of the Dead Sea had an average salinity of about 30%, and a temperature that swung between . Underneath a zone of transition, the lowest level of the Dead Sea had waters of a consistent temperature, salinity of over 34%, and complete saturation of sodium chloride (NaCl). Since the water near the bottom is saturated with NaCl, that salt precipitates out of solution onto the sea floor.

Beginning in the 1960s, water inflow to the Dead Sea from the Jordan River was reduced as a result of large-scale irrigation and generally low rainfall. By 1975, the upper water layer was saltier than the lower layer. Nevertheless, the upper layer remained suspended above the lower layer because its waters were warmer and thus less dense. When the upper layer cooled so its density was greater than the lower layer, the waters mixed (1978–79). For the first time in centuries, the lake was a homogeneous body of water. Since then, stratification has begun to redevelop.

The mineral content of the Dead Sea is very different from that of ocean water. The exact composition of the Dead Sea water varies mainly with season, depth and temperature. In the early 1980s, the concentration of ionic species (in g/kg) of Dead Sea surface water was Cl− (181.4), Br− (4.2), SO42− (0.4), HCO3− (0.2), Ca2+ (14.1), Na+ (32.5), K+ (6.2) and Mg2+ (35.2). The total salinity was 276 g/kg. These results show that the composition of the salt, as anhydrous chlorides on a weight percentage basis, was calcium chloride (CaCl2) 14.4%, potassium chloride (KCl) 4.4%, magnesium chloride (MgCl2) 50.8% and sodium chloride (NaCl) 30.4%. In comparison, the salt in the water of most oceans and seas is approximately 85% sodium chloride. The concentration of sulfate ions (SO42−) is very low, and the concentration of bromide ions (Br−) is the highest of all waters on Earth.
The salt concentration of the Dead Sea fluctuates around 31.5%. This is unusually high and results in a nominal density of 1.24 kg/L. Anyone can easily float in the Dead Sea because of natural buoyancy. In this respect the Dead Sea is similar to the Great Salt Lake in Utah in the United States.

An unusual feature of the Dead Sea is its discharge of asphalt. From deep seeps, the Dead Sea constantly spits up small pebbles and blocks of the black substance. Asphalt-coated figurines and bitumen-coated Neolithic skulls from archaeological sites have been found. Egyptian mummification processes used asphalt imported from the Dead Sea region.

==Putative therapies==

The Dead Sea area has become a location for health research and potential treatment for several reasons. The mineral content of the water, the low content of pollens and other allergens in the atmosphere, the reduced ultraviolet component of solar radiation, and the higher atmospheric pressure at this great depth each may have specific health effects. For example, persons experiencing reduced respiratory function from diseases such as cystic fibrosis seem to benefit from the increased atmospheric pressure.

The region&#x27;s climate and low elevation have made it a popular center for assessment of putative therapies:
* Climatotherapy: Treatment which exploits local climatic features such as temperature, humidity, sunshine, barometric pressure and special atmospheric constituents
* Heliotherapy: Treatment that exploits the biological effects of the sun&#x27;s radiation
* Thalassotherapy: Treatment that exploits bathing in Dead Sea water

There is evidence that the unique attenuation and spectrum of UV rays near the Dead Sea contribute to effective photoclimatherapy for psoriasis, in part because the reduced exposure to solar radiation allows for longer periods of sunbathing.

Rhinosinusitis patients receiving Dead Sea saline nasal irrigation exhibited improved symptom relief compared to standard hypertonic saline spray in one study.

Dead Sea mud pack therapy has been suggested to temporarily relieve pain in patients with osteoarthritis of the knees. According to researchers of the Ben Gurion University of the Negev, treatment with mineral-rich mud compresses can be used to augment conventional medical therapy.

==Life forms==
The sea is called &quot;dead&quot; because its high salinity prevents macroscopic aquatic organisms, such as fish and aquatic plants, from living in it, though minuscule quantities of bacteria and microbial fungi are present.

In times of flood, the salt content of the Dead Sea can drop from its usual 35% to 30% or lower. It temporarily comes to life in the wake of rainy winters. In 1980, after one such rainy winter, the normally dark blue Dead Sea turned red. Researchers from Hebrew University of Jerusalem found it to be teeming with an alga called &quot;Dunaliella&quot;. &quot;Dunaliella&quot; in turn nourished carotenoid-containing (red-pigmented) halobacteria, whose presence caused the color change. Since 1980, the basin has been dry and the algae and the bacteria have not returned in measurable numbers.

In 2011 a group of scientists from Be&#x27;er Sheva, Israel and Germany discovered fissures in the floor of the Dead Sea by scuba diving and observing the surface. These fissures allow fresh and brackish water to enter. They sampled biofilms surrounding the fissures and discovered numerous species of bacteria and archaea.

==Human settlement==
There are several small communities near the Dead Sea. These include Ein Gedi, Neve Zohar and the Israeli settlements in the Megilot Regional Council: Kalya, Mitzpe Shalem and Avnat. There is a nature preserve at Ein Gedi, and several Dead Sea hotels are located on the southwest end at Ein Bokek near Neve Zohar. Highway 90 runs north–south on the Israeli side for a total distance of from Metula on the Lebanese border in the north to its southern terminus at the Egyptian border near the Red Sea port of Eilat.

Potash City is a small community on the Jordanian side of the Dead Sea, and others including Suweima. Highway 65 runs north–south on the Jordanian side from near Jordan&#x27;s northern tip down past the Dead Sea to the port of Aqaba.

==Human history==
===Biblical period===

Dwelling in caves near the Dead Sea is recorded in the Hebrew Bible as having taken place before the Israelites came to Canaan, and extensively at the time of King David.

Just northwest of the Dead Sea is Jericho. Somewhere, perhaps on the southeastern shore, would be the cities mentioned in the Book of Genesis which were said to have been destroyed in the time of Abraham: Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 18) and the three other &quot;Cities of the Plain&quot;, Admah, Zeboim and Zoar (Deuteronomy 29:23). Zoar escaped destruction when Abraham&#x27;s nephew Lot escaped to Zoar from Sodom (Genesis 19:21–22). Before the destruction, the Dead Sea was a valley full of natural tar pits, which was called the vale of Siddim. King David was said to have hidden from Saul at Ein Gedi nearby.

In Ezekiel 47:8–9 there is a specific prophecy that the sea will &quot;be healed and made fresh&quot;, becoming a normal lake capable of supporting marine life. A similar prophecy is stated in Zechariah 14:8, which says that &quot;living waters will go out from Jerusalem, half of them to the eastern sea [likely the Dead Sea] and half to the western sea [the Mediterranean].&quot;

===Greek and Roman period===
Greek and Jewish writers report that the Nabateans had monopolistic control over the Dead Sea.

Archaeological evidence shows multiple anchorages existing on both sides of the sea, including in Ein Gedi, Khirbet Mazin (where the ruins of a Hasmonean-era dry dock are located), Numeira and near Masada.

King Herod the Great built or rebuilt several fortresses and palaces on the western bank of the Dead Sea. The most famous was Masada, where in 70 CE a small group of Jewish zealots fled after the fall of the destruction of the Second Temple. The zealots survived until 73 CE, when a siege by the X Legion ended in the deaths by suicide of its 960 inhabitants. Another historically important fortress was Machaerus (מכוור), on the eastern bank, where, according to Josephus, John the Baptist was imprisoned by Herod Antipas and died.

Also in Roman times, some Essenes settled on the Dead Sea&#x27;s western shore; Pliny the Elder identifies their location with the words, &quot;on the west side of the Dead Sea, away from the coast ... [above] the town of Engeda&quot; (&quot;Natural History&quot;, Bk 5.73); and it is therefore a hugely popular but contested hypothesis today, that same Essenes are identical with the settlers at Qumran and that &quot;the Dead Sea Scrolls&quot; discovered during the 20th century in the nearby caves had been their own library.

 Josephus identified the Dead Sea in geographic proximity to the ancient Biblical city of Sodom. However, he referred to the lake by its Greek name, Asphaltites.

Various sects of Jews settled in caves overlooking the Dead Sea. The best known of these are the Essenes of Qumran, who left an extensive library known as the Dead Sea Scrolls. The town of Ein Gedi, mentioned many times in the Mishna, produced persimmon for the temple&#x27;s fragrance and for export, using a secret recipe. &quot;Sodomite salt&quot; was an essential mineral for the temple&#x27;s holy incense, but was said to be dangerous for home use and could cause blindness. The Roman camps surrounding Masada were built by Jewish slaves receiving water from the towns around the lake. These towns had drinking water from the Ein Feshcha springs and other sweetwater springs in the vicinity.

===Byzantine period===
The sixth-century mosaic known as the Madaba Map indicates that trade across the Dead Sea was very prevalent during the Byzantine period.

Connected with the Judean wilderness to its northwest and west, the Dead Sea was a place of escape and refuge. The remoteness of the region attracted Greek Orthodox monks since the Byzantine era. Their monasteries, such as Saint George in Wadi Kelt and Mar Saba in the Judaean Desert, are places of pilgrimage. 
===Medieval period===

From the seventh century onwards, the Dead Sea area entered a period of decline and its population decreased. The cultivation of sugarcane near the northern and southern shores of the lake began to develop during the Crusader period and reached its peak under the Mamluks.

===Modern times===

In the 19th century the River Jordan and the Dead Sea were explored by boat primarily by Christopher Costigan in 1835, Thomas Howard Molyneux in 1847, William Francis Lynch in 1848, and John MacGregor in 1869. The full text of W. F. Lynch&#x27;s 1849 book &quot;&quot; is available online. Charles Leonard Irby and James Mangles travelled along the shores of the Dead Sea already in 1817–18, but didn&#x27;t navigate on its waters.
Explorers and scientists arrived in the area to analyze the minerals and research the unique climate.

After the find of the &quot;Moabite Stone&quot; in 1868 on the plateau east of the Dead Sea, Moses Wilhelm Shapira and his partner Salim al-Khouri forged and sold a whole range of presumed &quot;Moabite&quot; antiquities, and in 1883 Shapira presented what is now known as the &quot;Shapira Strips&quot;, a supposedly ancient scroll written on leather strips which he claimed had been found near the Dead Sea. The strips were declared to be forgeries and Shapira took his own life in disgrace.

The 1922 census of Palestine lists 100 people (68 Muslims and 32 Christians) with &quot;Dead Sea &amp; Jordan&quot; as their main locality. The 1931 census shows a sharp increase with 535 people (264 Muslims, 230 Jews, 21 Christians, 17 Druze, and three with no religion) listing &quot;Dead Sea&quot; as their main village/town. The 1938 nor 1945 village statistics does not give a number for the general Dead Sea area.

In the late 1940s and early 1950s, hundreds of Jewish religious documents dated between 150 BCE and 70 CE were found in caves near the ancient settlement of Qumran, about inland from the northwestern shore of the Dead Sea (presently in the West Bank). They became known and famous as the Dead Sea Scrolls.

The world&#x27;s lowest roads, Highway 90, run along the Israeli and West Bank shores of the Dead Sea, along with Highway 65 on the Jordanian side, at below sea level.

==Tourism and leisure==
===British Mandate period===
A golf course named for Sodom and Gomorrah was built by the British at Kalia on the northern shore.

===Israel===
The first major Israeli hotels were built in nearby Arad, and since the 1960s at the Ein Bokek resort complex.

Israel has 15 hotels along the Dead Sea shore, generating total revenues of $291 million in 2012. Most Israeli hotels and resorts on the Dead Sea are on a stretch of the southern shore.

===Jordan===

On the Jordanian side, nine international franchises have opened seaside resort hotels near the King Hussein Bin Talal Convention Center, along with resort apartments, on the eastern shore of the Dead Sea. The 9 hotels have boosted the Jordanian side&#x27;s capacity to 2,800 rooms.

On November 22, 2015, the Dead Sea panorama road was included along with 40 archaeological locations in Jordan, to become live on Google Street View.

===Palestine (West Bank)===
The portion of Dead Sea coast which Palestinians could possibly eventually manage is about long. The World Bank estimates that such Dead Sea tourism industry could generate $290 million of revenues per year and 2,900 jobs. However, Palestinians have been unable to obtain construction permits for tourism-related investments on the Dead Sea. According to the World Bank, officials in the Palestinian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities state that the only way to apply for such permits is through the Joint Committees established under the Oslo Agreement, but the relevant committee has not met with any degree of regularity since 2000.

==Chemical industry==
===British Mandate period===
In the early part of the 20th century, the Dead Sea began to attract interest from chemists who deduced the sea was a natural deposit of potash (potassium chloride) and bromine. A concession was granted by the British Mandatory government to the newly formed Palestine Potash Company in 1929. Its founder, Siberian Jewish engineer and pioneer of Lake Baikal exploitation, Moses Novomeysky, had worked for the charter for over ten years having first visited the area in 1911. The first plant, on the north shore of the Dead Sea at Kalya, commenced production in 1931 and produced potash by solar evaporation of the brine. Employing Arabs and Jews, it was an island of peace in turbulent times. In 1934 a second plant was built on the southwest shore, in the Mount Sodom area, south of the &#x27;Lashon&#x27; region of the Dead Sea. Palestine Potash Company supplied half of Britain&#x27;s potash during World War II. Both plants were destroyed by the Jordanians in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.

===Israel===
The Dead Sea Works was founded in 1952 as a state-owned enterprise based on the remnants of the Palestine Potash Company. In 1995, the company was privatized and it is now owned by Israel Chemicals. From the Dead Sea brine, Israel produces (2001) 1.77 million tons potash, 206,000 tons elemental bromine, 44,900 tons caustic soda, 25,000 tons magnesium metal, and sodium chloride. Israeli companies generate around US$3 billion annually from the sale of Dead Sea minerals (primarily potash and bromine), and from other products that are derived from Dead Sea Minerals.

===Jordan===
On the Jordanian side of the Dead Sea, Arab Potash (APC), formed in 1956, produces 2.0 million tons of potash annually, as well as sodium chloride and bromine. The plant is located at Safi, South Aghwar Department, in the Karak Governorate.

Jordanian Dead Sea mineral industries generate about $1.2 billion in sales (equivalent to 4 percent of Jordan&#x27;s GDP).

===West Bank===
The Palestinian Dead Sea Coast is about long. The Palestinian economy is unable to benefit from Dead Sea chemicals due to restricted access, permit issues and the uncertainties of the investment climate. The World Bank estimates that a Palestinian Dead Sea chemicals industry could generate $918M incremental value added per year, &quot;almost equivalent to the contribution of the entire manufacturing sector of Palestinian territories today&quot;.

===Extraction===
Both companies, Dead Sea Works Ltd. and Arab Potash, use extensive salt evaporation pans that have essentially diked the entire southern end of the Dead Sea for the purpose of producing carnallite, potassium magnesium chloride, which is then processed further to produce potassium chloride. The ponds are separated by a central dike that runs roughly north–south along the international border. The power plant on the Israeli side allows production of magnesium metal (by a subsidiary, Dead Sea Magnesium Ltd.).

Due to the popularity of the sea&#x27;s therapeutic and healing properties, several companies have also shown interest in the manufacturing and supplying of Dead Sea salts as raw materials for body and skin care products.

==Recession and environmental concerns==
===Receding shoreline===
Since 1930, when its surface was and its level was below sea level, the Dead Sea has been monitored continuously. The Dead Sea has been rapidly shrinking since the 1960s because of diversion of incoming water from the Jordan River to the north as part of the National Water Carrier scheme, completed in 1964. The southern end is fed by a canal maintained by the Dead Sea Works, a company that converts the sea&#x27;s raw materials. From a water surface of below sea level in 1970 it fell below sea level in 2006, reaching a drop rate of per year. As the water level decreases, the characteristics of the Sea and surrounding region may substantially change.

, the surface of the Sea has shrunk by about 33 percent since the 1960s, which is partly attributed to the much-reduced flow of the Jordan River since the construction of the National Water Carrier project, and the amount of water from the rains reaching the Dead Sea has diminished even further since flash floods started pouring into the sinkholes left by its shrinkage. The EcoPeace Middle East, a joint Israeli-Palestinian-Jordanian environmental group, has estimated that the annual flow into the Dead Sea from the Jordan is less than of water, compared with former flows of between and .

====Sinkholes and their impact====
The Dead Sea level drop has been followed by a groundwater level drop, causing brines that used to occupy underground layers near the shoreline to be flushed out by freshwater. This is believed to be the cause of the recent appearance of large sinkholes along the western shore—incoming freshwater dissolves salt layers, rapidly creating subsurface cavities that subsequently collapse to form these sinkholes. Ein Gedi, on the western coast, has been subject to a large number of sinkholes appearing in the area, attributed to the decline in the water level of the Dead Sea.

As a result of the sinkholes, most beach resorts along the west shore of the northern basin had to be shut down, with just three remaining near the basin&#x27;s northwest tip (see List of beaches in Palestine: Dead Sea).

===Link to the Red Sea===

In May 2009 at the World Economic Forum, Jordan introduced plans for a &quot;Jordan National Red Sea Development Project&quot; (JRSP). This is a plan to convey seawater from the Red Sea near Aqaba to the Dead Sea. Water would be desalinated along the route to provide fresh water to Jordan, with the brine discharge sent to the Dead Sea for replenishment. Israel has expressed its support and will likely benefit from some of the water delivery to its Negev region.

At a regional conference in July 2009, officials expressed concern about the declining water levels. Some suggested industrial activities around the Dead Sea might need to be reduced. Others advised environmental measures to restore conditions such as increasing the volume of flow from the Jordan River to replenish the Dead Sea. Currently, only sewage and effluent from fish ponds run in the river&#x27;s channel. Experts also stressed the need for strict conservation efforts. They said agriculture should not be expanded, sustainable support capabilities should be incorporated into the area and pollution sources should be reduced.

In October 2009, the Jordanians accelerated plans to extract around of water per year from the Red Sea, desalinate it for use as fresh water and send the waste water to the Dead Sea by tunnel, despite concerns about inadequate time to assess the potential environmental impact. According to Jordan&#x27;s minister for water, General Maysoun Zu&#x27;bi, this project could be considered as the first phase of the Red Sea–Dead Sea Water Conveyance.

In December 2013, Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority signed an agreement for laying a water pipeline to link the Red Sea with the Dead Sea. The pipeline would be long and is estimated to take up to five years to complete. In January 2015 it was reported that the level of water was dropping by a year.

On 27 November 2016, the Jordanian government shortlisted five consortia to implement the project. Jordan&#x27;s ministry of Water and Irrigation said that the $100 million first phase of the project would begin construction in the first quarter of 2018, and would be completed by 2021. The project was officially abandoned in June 2021, having never broken ground.

<text>A dragon is a magical legendary creature that appears in the folklore of multiple cultures worldwide. Beliefs about dragons vary considerably through regions, but dragons in Western cultures since the High Middle Ages have often been depicted as winged, horned, and capable of breathing fire. Dragons in eastern cultures are usually depicted as wingless, four-legged, serpentine creatures with above-average intelligence. Commonalities between dragons&#x27; traits are often a hybridization of reptilian, mammalian, and avian features.

==Etymology==

The word &quot;dragon&quot; entered the English language in the early 13th century from Old French , which, in turn, comes from Latin (genitive ), meaning &quot;huge serpent, dragon&quot;, from Ancient Greek , (genitive , ) &quot;serpent&quot;. The Greek and Latin term referred to any great serpent, not necessarily mythological. The Greek word is most likely derived from the Greek verb () meaning &quot;I see&quot;, the aorist form of which is (). This is thought to have referred to something with a &quot;deadly glance&quot;, or unusually bright or &quot;sharp&quot; eyes, or because a snake&#x27;s eyes appear to be always open; each eye actually sees through a big transparent scale in its eyelids, which are permanently shut. The Greek word probably derives from an Indo-European base meaning &quot;to see&quot;; the Sanskrit root () also means &quot;to see&quot;.

==Overview==

Draconic creatures appear in virtually all cultures around the globe and the earliest attested reports of draconic creatures resemble giant snakes. Draconic creatures are first described in the mythologies of the ancient Near East and appear in ancient Mesopotamian art and literature. Stories about storm-gods slaying giant serpents occur throughout nearly all Near Eastern and Indo-European mythologies. Famous prototypical draconic creatures include the &quot;mušḫuššu&quot; of ancient Mesopotamia; Apep in Egyptian mythology; Vṛtra in the &quot;Rigveda&quot;; the Leviathan in the Hebrew Bible; Grand&#x27;Goule in the Poitou region in France; Python, Ladon, Wyvern and the Lernaean Hydra in Greek mythology; Kulshedra in Albanian Mythology; Unhcegila in Lakota mythology; Quetzalcoatl in Aztec Culture; Jörmungandr, Níðhöggr, and Fafnir in Norse mythology; the dragon from &quot;Beowulf&quot;; and aži and az in ancient Persian mythology, closely related to another mythological figure, called Aži Dahaka or Zahhak.

Nonetheless, scholars dispute where the idea of a dragon originates from, and a wide variety of hypotheses have been proposed.

In his book &quot;An Instinct for Dragons&quot; (2000), anthropologist David E. Jones suggests a hypothesis that humans, like monkeys, have inherited instinctive reactions to snakes, large cats, and birds of prey. He cites a study which found that approximately 39 people in a hundred are afraid of snakes and notes that fear of snakes is especially prominent in children, even in areas where snakes are rare. The earliest attested dragons all resemble snakes or have snakelike attributes. Jones therefore concludes that dragons appear in nearly all cultures because humans have an innate fear of snakes and other animals that were major predators of humans&#x27; primate ancestors. Dragons are usually said to reside in &quot;dark caves, deep pools, wild mountain reaches, sea bottoms, haunted forests&quot;, all places which would have been fraught with danger for early human ancestors.

In her book &quot;The First Fossil Hunters: Dinosaurs, Mammoths, and Myth in Greek and Roman Times&quot; (2000), Adrienne Mayor argues that some stories of dragons may have been inspired by ancient discoveries of fossils belonging to dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals. She argues that the dragon lore of northern India may have been inspired by &quot;observations of oversized, extraordinary bones in the fossilbeds of the Siwalik Hills below the Himalayas&quot; and that ancient Greek artistic depictions of the Monster of Troy may have been influenced by fossils of &quot;Samotherium&quot;, an extinct species of giraffe whose fossils are common in the Mediterranean region. In China, a region where fossils of large prehistoric animals are common, these remains are frequently identified as &quot;dragon bones&quot; and are commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine. Mayor, however, is careful to point out that not all stories of dragons and giants are inspired by fossils and notes that Scandinavia has many stories of dragons and sea monsters, but has long &quot;been considered barren of large fossils.&quot; In one of her later books, she states that, &quot;Many dragon images around the world were based on folk knowledge or exaggerations of living reptiles, such as Komodo dragons, Gila monsters, iguanas, alligators, or, in California, alligator lizards, though this still fails to account for the Scandinavian legends, as no such animals (historical or otherwise) have ever been found in this region.&quot;

Robert Blust in &quot;The Origin of Dragons&quot; (2000) argues that, like many other creations of traditional cultures, dragons are largely explicable as products of a convergence of rational pre-scientific speculation about the world of real events. In this case, the event is the natural mechanism governing rainfall and drought, with particular attention paid to the phenomenon of the rainbow.

In Egyptian mythology, Apep or Apophis is a giant serpentine creature who resides in the Duat, the Egyptian Underworld. The Bremner-Rhind papyrus, written around 310 BC, preserves an account of a much older Egyptian tradition that the setting of the sun is caused by Ra descending to the Duat to battle Apep. In some accounts, Apep is as long as the height of eight men with a head made of flint. Thunderstorms and earthquakes were thought to be caused by Apep&#x27;s roar and solar eclipses were thought to be the result of Apep attacking Ra during the daytime. In some myths, Apep is slain by the god Set. Nehebkau is another giant serpent who guards the Duat and aided Ra in his battle against Apep. Nehebkau was so massive in some stories that the entire earth was believed to rest atop his coils. Denwen is a giant serpent mentioned in the Pyramid Texts whose body was made of fire and who ignited a conflagration that nearly destroyed all the gods of the Egyptian pantheon. He was ultimately defeated by the Pharaoh, a victory which affirmed the Pharaoh&#x27;s divine right to rule.

The ouroboros was a well-known Egyptian symbol of a serpent swallowing its own tail. The precursor to the ouroboros was the &quot;Many-Faced&quot;, a serpent with five heads, who, according to the Amduat, the oldest surviving Book of the Afterlife, was said to coil around the corpse of the sun god Ra protectively. The earliest surviving depiction of a &quot;true&quot; ouroboros comes from the gilded shrines in the tomb of Tutankhamun. In the early centuries AD, the ouroboros was adopted as a symbol by Gnostic Christians and chapter 136 of the &quot;Pistis Sophia&quot;, an early Gnostic text, describes &quot;a great dragon whose tail is in its mouth&quot;. In medieval alchemy, the ouroboros became a typical western dragon with wings, legs, and a tail. A famous image of the dragon gnawing on its tail from the eleventh-century Codex Marcianus was copied in numerous works on alchemy.

===Mesopotamia===

Ancient people across the Near East believed in creatures similar to what modern people call &quot;dragons&quot;. These ancient people were unaware of the existence of dinosaurs or similar creatures in the distant past. References to dragons of both benevolent and malevolent characters occur throughout ancient Mesopotamian literature. In Sumerian poetry, great kings are often compared to the &quot;ušumgal&quot;, a gigantic, serpentine monster. A draconic creature with the foreparts of a lion and the hind-legs, tail, and wings of a bird appears in Mesopotamian artwork from the Akkadian Period ( 2334 – 2154 BC) until the Neo-Babylonian Period (626 BC–539 BC). The dragon is usually shown with its mouth open. It may have been known as the &quot;(ūmu) nā’iru&quot;, which means &quot;roaring weather beast&quot;, and may have been associated with the god Ishkur (Hadad). A slightly different lion-dragon with two horns and the tail of a scorpion appears in art from the Neo-Assyrian Period (911 BC–609 BC). A relief probably commissioned by Sennacherib shows the gods Ashur, Sin, and Adad standing on its back.

Another draconic creature with horns, the body and neck of a snake, the forelegs of a lion, and the hind-legs of a bird appears in Mesopotamian art from the Akkadian Period until the Hellenistic Period (323 BC–31 BC). This creature, known in Akkadian as the &quot;mušḫuššu&quot;, meaning &quot;furious serpent&quot;, was used as a symbol for particular deities and also as a general protective emblem. It seems to have originally been the attendant of the Underworld god Ninazu, but later became the attendant to the Hurrian storm-god Tishpak, as well as, later, Ninazu&#x27;s son Ningishzida, the Babylonian national god Marduk, the scribal god Nabu, and the Assyrian national god Ashur.

Scholars disagree regarding the appearance of Tiamat, the Babylonian goddess personifying primeval chaos, slain by Marduk in the Babylonian creation epic &quot;Enûma Eliš&quot;. She was traditionally regarded by scholars as having had the form of a giant serpent, but several scholars have pointed out that this shape &quot;cannot be imputed to Tiamat with certainty&quot; and she seems to have at least sometimes been regarded as anthropomorphic. Nonetheless, in some texts, she seems to be described with horns, a tail, and a hide that no weapon can penetrate, all features which suggest she was conceived as some form of dragoness.

===Levant===

In the mythologies of the Ugarit region, specifically the Baal Cycle from the Ugaritic texts, the sea-dragon Lōtanu is described as &quot;the twisting serpent / the powerful one with seven heads.&quot; In &quot;KTU&quot; 1.5 I 2–3, Lōtanu is slain by the storm-god Baal, but, in &quot;KTU&quot; 1.3 III 41–42, he is instead slain by the virgin warrior goddess Anat.

In the Hebrew Bible, in the Book of Psalms, Psalm 74, Psalm 74:13–14, the sea-dragon Leviathan, is slain by Yahweh, god of the kingdoms of Israel and Judah, as part of the creation of the world. Isaiah describes Leviathan as a (), which is translated as &quot;sea monster&quot;, &quot;serpent&quot;, or &quot;dragon&quot;. In Isaiah 27:1, Yahweh&#x27;s destruction of Leviathan is foretold as part of his impending overhaul of the universal order:

Job 41:1–34 contains a detailed description of the Leviathan, who is described as being so powerful that only Yahweh can overcome it. Job 41:19–21 states that the Leviathan exhales fire and smoke, making its identification as a mythical dragon clearly apparent. In some parts of the Old Testament, the Leviathan is historicized as a symbol for the nations that stand against Yahweh. Rahab, a synonym for &quot;Leviathan&quot;, is used in several Biblical passages in reference to Egypt. Isaiah 30:7 declares: &quot;For Egypt&#x27;s help is worthless and empty, therefore I have called her &#x27;the silenced Rahab&#x27;.&quot; Similarly, Psalm 87:3 reads: &quot;I reckon Rahab and Babylon as those that know me...&quot; In Ezekiel 29:3–5 and Ezekiel 32:2–8, the pharaoh of Egypt is described as a &quot;dragon&quot; (&quot;tannîn&quot;). In the deuterocanonical story of Bel and the Dragon from the Book of Daniel, the prophet Daniel sees a dragon being worshipped by the Babylonians. Daniel makes &quot;cakes of pitch, fat, and hair&quot;; the dragon eats them and bursts open.

===Iran===
Azhi Dahaka (Avestan Great Snake) is a dragon or demonic figure in the texts and mythology of Zoroastrian Persia, where he is one of the subordinates of Angra Mainyu. Alternate names include Azi Dahak, Dahaka, and Dahak. Aži (nominative ažiš) is the Avestan word for &quot;serpent&quot; or &quot;dragon. The Avestan term Aži Dahāka and the Middle Persian azdahāg are the sources of the Middle Persian Manichaean demon of greed &quot;Az&quot;, Old Armenian mythological figure Azhdahak, Modern Persian &#x27;aždehâ/aždahâ&#x27;, Tajik Persian &#x27;azhdahâ&#x27;, Urdu &#x27;azhdahā&#x27; (اژدها).
The name also migrated to Eastern Europe, assumed the form &quot;azhdaja&quot; and the meaning &quot;dragon&quot;, &quot;dragoness&quot; or &quot;water snake&quot; in the Balkanic and Slavic languages.

Despite the negative aspect of Aži Dahāka in mythology, dragons have been used on some banners of war throughout the history of Iranian peoples.

The Azhdarchid group of pterosaurs are named from a Persian word for &quot;dragon&quot; that ultimately comes from Aži Dahāka.

In Persian Sufi literature, Rumi writes in his &quot;Masnavi&quot; that the dragon symbolizes the sensual soul (&quot;nafs&quot;), greed and lust, that need to be mortified in a spiritual battle.
In Ferdowsi&#x27;s &quot;Shahnameh,&quot; the Iranian hero Rostam must slay an 80-meter-long dragon (which renders itself invisible to human sight) with the aid of his legendary horse, Rakhsh. As Rostam is sleeping, the dragon approaches; Rakhsh attempts to wake Rostam, but fails to alert him to the danger until Rostam sees the dragon. Rakhsh bites the dragon, while Rostam decapitates it. This is the third trial of Rostam&#x27;s Seven Labors.

Rostam is also credited with the slaughter of other dragons in the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; and in other Iranian oral traditions, notably in the myth of &quot;Babr-e-Bayan&quot;. In this tale, Rostam is still an adolescent and kills a dragon in the &quot;Orient&quot; (either India or China, depending on the source) by forcing it to swallow either ox hides filled with quicklime and stones or poisoned blades. The dragon swallows these foreign objects and its stomach bursts, after which Rostam flays the dragon and fashions a coat from its hide called the &quot;babr-e bayān&quot;. In some variants of the story, Rostam then remains unconscious for two days and nights, but is guarded by his steed Rakhsh. On reviving, he washes himself in a spring. In the Mandean tradition of the story, Rostam hides in a box, is swallowed by the dragon, and kills it from inside its belly. The king of China then gives Rostam his daughter in marriage as a reward.

==East Asia==
===China===

The word &quot;dragon&quot; has come to be applied to the legendary creature in Chinese mythology, &quot;loong&quot; (traditional 龍, simplified 龙, Japanese simplified 竜, Pinyin &quot;lóng&quot;), which is associated with good fortune, and many East Asian deities and demigods have dragons as their personal mounts or companions. Dragons were also identified with the Emperor of China, who, during later Chinese imperial history, was the only one permitted to have dragons on his house, clothing, or personal articles.
Archaeologist Zhōu Chong-Fa believes that the Chinese word for dragon is an onomatopoeia of the sound of thunder or &quot;lùhng&quot; in Cantonese.

The Chinese dragon () is the highest-ranking creature in the Chinese animal hierarchy. Its origins are vague, but its &quot;ancestors can be found on Neolithic pottery as well as Bronze Age ritual vessels.&quot; A number of popular stories deal with the rearing of dragons. The &quot;Zuo zhuan&quot;, which was probably written during the Warring States period, describes a man named Dongfu, a descendant of Yangshu&#x27;an, who loved dragons and, because he could understand a dragon&#x27;s will, he was able to tame them and raise them well. He served Emperor Shun, who gave him the family name Huanlong, meaning &quot;dragon-raiser&quot;. In another story, Kong Jia, the fourteenth emperor of the Xia dynasty, was given a male and a female dragon as a reward for his obedience to the god of heaven, but could not train them, so he hired a dragon-trainer named Liulei, who had learned how to train dragons from Huanlong. One day, the female dragon died unexpectedly, so Liulei secretly chopped her up, cooked her meat, and served it to the king, who loved it so much that he demanded Liulei to serve him the same meal again. Since Liulei had no means of procuring more dragon meat, he fled the palace.

One of the most famous dragon stories is about the Lord Ye Gao, who loved dragons obsessively, even though he had never seen one. He decorated his whole house with dragon motifs and, seeing this display of admiration, a real dragon came and visited Ye Gao, but the lord was so terrified at the sight of the creature that he ran away. In Chinese legend, the culture hero Fu Hsi is said to have been crossing the Lo River, when he saw the &quot;lung ma&quot;, a Chinese horse-dragon with seven dots on its face, six on its back, eight on its left flank, and nine on its right flank. He was so moved by this apparition that, when he arrived home, he drew a picture of it, including the dots. He later used these dots as letters and invented Chinese writing, which he used to write his book &quot;I Ching&quot;. In another Chinese legend, the physician Ma Shih Huang is said to have healed a sick dragon. Another legend reports that a man once came to the healer Lo Chên-jen, telling him that he was a dragon and that he needed to be healed. After Lo Chên-jen healed the man, a dragon appeared to him and carried him to heaven.

In the &quot;Shanhaijing&quot;, a classic mythography probably compiled mostly during the Han dynasty, various deities and demigods are associated with dragons. One of the most famous Chinese dragons is Ying Long (&quot;responding dragon&quot;), who helped the Huangdi, the Yellow Emperor, defeat the tyrant Chiyou. The dragon Zhulong (&quot;torch dragon&quot;) is a god &quot;who composed the universe with his body.&quot; In the &quot;Shanhaijing&quot;, many mythic heroes are said to have been conceived after their mothers copulated with divine dragons, including Huangdi, Shennong, Emperor Yao, and Emperor Shun. The god Zhurong and the emperor Qi are both described as being carried by two dragons, as are Huangdi, Zhuanxu, Yuqiang, and Roshou in various other texts. According to the &quot;Huainanzi&quot;, an evil black dragon once caused a destructive deluge, which was ended by the mother goddess Nüwa by slaying the dragon.
A large number of ethnic myths about dragons are told throughout China. The &quot;Houhanshu&quot;, compiled in the fifth century BC by Fan Ye, reports a story belonging to the Ailaoyi people, which holds that a woman named Shayi who lived in the region around Mount Lao became pregnant with ten sons after being touched by a tree trunk floating in the water while fishing. She gave birth to the sons and the tree trunk turned into a dragon, who asked to see his sons. The woman showed them to him, but all of them ran away except for the youngest, who the dragon licked on the back and named Jiu Long, meaning &quot;sitting back&quot;. The sons later elected him king and the descendants of the ten sons became the Ailaoyi people, who tattooed dragons on their backs in honor of their ancestor. The Miao people of southwest China have a story that a divine dragon created the first humans by breathing on monkeys that came to play in his cave. The Han people have many stories about Short-Tailed Old Li, a black dragon who was born to a poor family in Shandong. When his mother saw him for the first time, she fainted and, when his father came home from the field and saw him, he hit him with a spade and cut off part of his tail. Li burst through the ceiling and flew away to the Black Dragon River in northeast China, where he became the god of that river. On the anniversary of his mother&#x27;s death on the Chinese lunar calendar, Old Li returns home, causing it to rain. He is still worshipped as a rain god.
In China, a dragon is thought to have power over rain. Dragons and their associations with rain are the source of the Chinese customs of dragon dancing and dragon boat racing. Dragons are closely associated with rain and drought is thought to be caused by a dragon&#x27;s laziness. Prayers invoking dragons to bring rain are common in Chinese texts. The &quot;Luxuriant Dew of the Spring and Autumn Annals&quot;, attributed to the Han dynasty scholar Dong Zhongshu, prescribes making clay figurines of dragons during a time of drought and having young men and boys pace and dance among the figurines in order to encourage the dragons to bring rain. Texts from the Qing dynasty advise hurling the bone of a tiger or dirty objects into the pool where the dragon lives; since dragons cannot stand tigers or dirt, the dragon of the pool will cause heavy rain to drive the object out. Rainmaking rituals invoking dragons are still very common in many Chinese villages, where each village has its own god said to bring rain and many of these gods are dragons. The Chinese dragon kings are thought of as the inspiration for the Hindu myth of the naga. According to these stories, every body of water is ruled by a dragon king, each with a different power, rank, and ability, so people began establishing temples across the countryside dedicated to these figures.
Many traditional Chinese customs revolve around dragons. During various holidays, including the Spring Festival and Lantern Festival, villagers will construct an approximately sixteen-foot-long dragon from grass, cloth, bamboo strips, and paper, which they will parade through the city as part of a dragon dance. The original purpose of this ritual was to bring good weather and a strong harvest, but now it is done mostly only for entertainment. During the Duanwu festival, several villages, or even a whole province, will hold a dragon boat race, in which people race across a body of water in boats carved to look like dragons, while a large audience watches on the banks. The custom is traditionally said to have originated after the poet Qu Yuan committed suicide by drowning himself in the Miluo River and people raced out in boats hoping to save him. But most historians agree that the custom actually originated much earlier as a ritual to avert ill fortune. Starting during the Han dynasty and continuing until the Qing dynasty, the Chinese emperor gradually became closely identified with dragons, and emperors themselves claimed to be the incarnations of a divine dragon. Eventually, dragons were only allowed to appear on clothing, houses, and articles of everyday use belonging to the emperor and any commoner who possessed everyday items bearing the image of the dragon was ordered to be executed. After the last Chinese emperor was overthrown in 1911, this situation changed and now many ordinary Chinese people identify themselves as descendants of dragons.

The impression of dragons in a large number of Asian countries has been influenced by Chinese culture, such as Korea, Vietnam, Japan, and so on. Chinese tradition has always used the dragon totem as the national emblem, and the &quot;Yellow Dragon flag&quot; of the Qing dynasty has influenced the impression that China is a dragon in many European countries.

===Korea===
The Korean dragon is in many ways similar in appearance to other East Asian dragons such as the Chinese and Japanese dragons. It differs from the Chinese dragon in that it developed a longer beard. Very occasionally, a dragon may be depicted as carrying an orb known as the Yeouiju (여의주), the Korean name for the mythical Cintamani, in its claws or its mouth. It was said that whoever could wield the Yeouiju was blessed with the abilities of omnipotence and creation at will, and that only four-toed dragons (who had thumbs with which to hold the orbs) were both wise and powerful enough to wield these orbs, as opposed to the lesser, three-toed dragons. As with China, the number nine is significant and auspicious in Korea, and dragons were said to have 81 (9×9) scales on their backs, representing yang essence. Dragons in Korean mythology are primarily benevolent beings related to water and agriculture, often considered bringers of rain and clouds. Hence, many Korean dragons are said to have resided in rivers, lakes, oceans, or even deep mountain ponds. And human journeys to undersea realms, and especially the undersea palace of the Dragon King (용왕), are common in Korean folklore.

In Korean myths, some kings who founded kingdoms were described as descendants of dragons because the dragon was a symbol of the monarch. Lady Aryeong, who was the first queen of Silla, is said to have been born from a cockatrice, while the grandmother of Taejo of Goryeo, founder of Goryeo, was reportedly the daughter of the dragon king of the West Sea. And King Munmu of Silla who, on his deathbed, wished to become a dragon of the East Sea in order to protect the kingdom. Dragon patterns were used exclusively by the royal family. The royal robe was also called the dragon robe (용포). In the Joseon dynasty, the royal insignia, featuring embroidered dragons, were attached to the robe&#x27;s shoulders, the chest, and back. The King wore five-taloned dragon insignia while the Crown Prince wore four-taloned dragon insignia.

Korean folk mythology states that most dragons were originally Imugis (이무기), or lesser dragons, which were said to resemble gigantic serpents. There are a few different versions of Korean folklore that describe both what imugis are and how they aspire to become full-fledged dragons. Koreans thought that an Imugi could become a true dragon, &quot;yong&quot; or &quot;mireu&quot;, if it caught a Yeouiju which had fallen from heaven. Another explanation states they are hornless creatures resembling dragons who have been cursed and thus were unable to become dragons. By other accounts, an Imugi is a &quot;proto-dragon&quot; which must survive one thousand years in order to become a fully-fledged dragon. In either case, they are said to be large, benevolent, python-like creatures that live in water or caves, and their sighting is associated with good luck.

===Japan===
Japanese dragon myths amalgamate native legends with imported stories about dragons from China. Like some other dragons, most Japanese dragons are water deities associated with rainfall and bodies of water, and are typically depicted as large, wingless, serpentine creatures with clawed feet. Gould writes (1896:248), the Japanese dragon is &quot;invariably figured as possessing three claws&quot;. A story about the &quot;samurai&quot; Minamoto no Mitsunaka tells that, while he was hunting in his own territory of Settsu, he dreamt under a tree and had a dream in which a beautiful woman appeared to him and begged him to save her land from a giant serpent which was defiling it. Mitsunaka agreed to help and the maiden gave him a magnificent horse. When he woke up, the seahorse was standing before him. He rode it to the Sumiyoshi temple, where he prayed for eight days. Then he confronted the serpent and slew it with an arrow.

It was believed that dragons could be appeased or exorcised with metal. Nitta Yoshisada is said to have hurled a famous sword into the sea at Sagami to appease the dragon-god of the sea and Ki no Tsurayuki threw a metal mirror into the sea at Sumiyoshi for the same purpose. Japanese Buddhism has also adapted dragons by subjecting them to Buddhist law; the Japanese Buddhist deities Benten and Kwannon are often shown sitting or standing on the back of a dragon. Several Japanese &quot;sennin&quot; (&quot;immortals&quot;) have taken dragons as their mounts. Bômô is said to have hurled his staff into a puddle of water, causing a dragon to come forth and let him ride it to heaven. The &quot;rakan&quot; Handaka is said to have been able to conjure a dragon out of a bowl, which he is often shown playing with on &quot;kagamibuta&quot;. The &quot;shachihoko&quot; is a creature with the head of a dragon, a bushy tail, fishlike scales, and sometimes with fire emerging from its armpits. The &quot;fun&quot; has the head of a dragon, feathered wings, and the tail and claws of a bird. A white dragon was believed to reside in a pool in Yamashiro Province and, every fifty years, it would turn into a bird called the Ogonchô, which had a call like the &quot;howling of a wild dog&quot;. This event was believed to herald terrible famine. In the Japanese village of Okumura, near Edo, during times of drought, the villagers would make a dragon effigy out of straw, magnolia leaves, and bamboo and parade it through the village to attract rainfall.

===Vietnam===

The Vietnamese dragon () was a mythical creature that was often used as a deity symbol and was associated with royalty. Similar to other cultures, dragons in Vietnamese culture represent yang and godly beings associated with creation and life. In the creation myth of the Vietnamese people, they are descended from the dragon lord Lạc Long Quân and the fairy Âu Cơ, who bore 100 eggs. When they separated, Lạc Long Quân brought 50 children to the sea while Âu Cơ brought the rest up the mountains. To this day, Vietnamese people often describe themselves as &quot;Children of the dragon, grandchildren of the fairy&quot; (&quot;Con rồng cháu tiên&quot;).

==South Asia==
===India===

In the &quot;Rigveda&quot;, the oldest of the four Vedas, Indra, the Vedic god of storms, battles Vṛtra, a giant serpent who represents drought. Indra kills Vṛtra using his &quot;vajra&quot; (thunderbolt) and clears the path for rain, which is described in the form of cattle: &quot;You won the cows, hero, you won the Soma,/You freed the seven streams to flow&quot; (&quot;Rigveda&quot; 1.32.12). In another Rigvedic legend, the three-headed serpent Viśvarūpa, the son of Tvaṣṭṛ, guards a wealth of cows and horses. Indra delivers Viśvarūpa to a god named Trita Āptya, who fights and kills him and sets his cattle free. Indra cuts off Viśvarūpa&#x27;s heads and drives the cattle home for Trita. This same story is alluded to in the Younger Avesta, in which the hero Thraētaona, the son of Āthbya, slays the three-headed dragon Aži Dahāka and takes his two beautiful wives as spoils. Thraētaona&#x27;s name (meaning &quot;third grandson of the waters&quot;) indicates that Aži Dahāka, like Vṛtra, was seen as a blocker of waters and cause of drought.

===Bhutan===
The Druk (), also known as &#x27;Thunder Dragon&#x27;, is one of the national symbols of Bhutan. In the Dzongkha language, Bhutan is known as &quot;Druk Yul&quot; &quot;Land of Druk&quot;, and Bhutanese leaders are called Druk Gyalpo, &quot;Thunder Dragon Kings&quot;. The druk was adopted as an emblem by the Drukpa Lineage, which originated in Tibet and later spread to Bhutan.

==Europe==

===Proto-Indo-European===

The tale of a hero slaying a giant serpent occurs in almost all Indo-European mythology. In most stories, the hero is some kind of thunder-god. In nearly every iteration of the story, the serpent is either multi-headed or &quot;multiple&quot; in some other way. Furthermore, in nearly every story, the serpent is always somehow associated with water. Bruce Lincoln has proposed that a Proto-Indo-European dragon-slaying myth can be reconstructed as follows: First, the sky gods give cattle to a man named &quot;*Tritos&quot; (&quot;the third&quot;), who is so named because he is the third man on earth, but a three-headed serpent named *&quot;&quot; steals them. &quot;*Tritos&quot; pursues the serpent and is accompanied by &quot;*Hanér&quot;, whose name means &quot;man&quot;. Together, the two heroes slay the serpent and rescue the cattle.

===Ancient Greece===

The ancient Greek word usually translated as &quot;dragon&quot; (δράκων &quot;drákōn&quot;, genitive δράκοντοϛ &quot;drákontos&quot;) could also mean &quot;snake&quot;, but it usually refers to a kind of giant serpent that either possesses supernatural characteristics or is otherwise controlled by some supernatural power. The first mention of a &quot;dragon&quot; in ancient Greek literature occurs in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, in which Agamemnon is described as having a blue dragon motif on his sword belt and an emblem of a three-headed dragon on his breast plate. In lines 820–880 of the &quot;Theogony&quot;, a Greek poem written in the seventh century BC by the Boeotian poet Hesiod, the Greek god Zeus battles the monster Typhon, who has one hundred serpent heads that breathe fire and make many frightening animal noises. Zeus scorches all of Typhon&#x27;s heads with his lightning bolts and then hurls Typhon into Tartarus. In other Greek sources, Typhon is often depicted as a winged, fire-breathing serpent-like dragon. In the &quot;Homeric Hymn to Apollo&quot;, the god Apollo uses his poisoned arrows to slay the serpent Python, who has been causing death and pestilence in the area around Delphi. Apollo then sets up his shrine there.

The Roman poet Virgil in his poem &quot;Culex&quot;, lines 163–201 Appendix Vergiliana: Culex, describing a shepherd having a fight with a big constricting snake, calls it &quot;&quot; and also &quot;&quot;, showing that in his time the two words were probably interchangeable.
Hesiod also mentions that the hero Heracles slew the Lernaean Hydra, a multiple-headed serpent which dwelt in the swamps of Lerna. The name &quot;Hydra&quot; means &quot;water snake&quot; in Greek. According to the &quot;Bibliotheka&quot; of Pseudo-Apollodorus, the slaying of the Hydra was the second of the Twelve Labors of Heracles. Accounts disagree on which weapon Heracles used to slay the Hydra, but, by the end of the sixth century BC, it was agreed that the clubbed or severed heads needed to be cauterized to prevent them from growing back. Heracles was aided in this task by his nephew Iolaus. During the battle, a giant crab crawled out of the marsh and pinched Heracles&#x27;s foot, but he crushed it under his heel. Hera placed the crab in the sky as the constellation Cancer. One of the Hydra&#x27;s heads was immortal, so Heracles buried it under a heavy rock after cutting it off. For his Eleventh Labor, Heracles must procure a golden apple from the tree in the Garden of the Hesperides, which is guarded by an enormous serpent that never sleeps, which Pseudo-Apollodorus calls &quot;Ladon&quot;. In earlier depictions, Ladon is often shown with many heads. In Pseudo-Apollodorus&#x27;s account, Ladon is immortal, but Sophocles and Euripides both describe Heracles as killing him, although neither of them specifies how. Some suggest that the golden apple was not claimed through battle with Ladon at all but through Heracles charming the Hesperides. The mythographer Herodorus is the first to state that Heracles slew him using his famous club. Apollonius of Rhodes, in his epic poem, the &quot;Argonautica&quot;, describes Ladon as having been shot full of poisoned arrows dipped in the blood of the Hydra.

In Pindar&#x27;s &quot;Fourth Pythian Ode&quot;, Aeëtes of Colchis tells the hero Jason that the Golden Fleece he is seeking is in a copse guarded by a dragon, &quot;which surpassed in breadth and length a fifty-oared ship&quot;. Jason slays the dragon and makes off with the Golden Fleece together with his co-conspirator, Aeëtes&#x27;s daughter, Medea. The earliest artistic representation of this story is an Attic red-figure &quot;kylix&quot; dated to 480–470 BC, showing a bedraggled Jason being disgorged from the dragon&#x27;s open mouth as the Golden Fleece hangs in a tree behind him and Athena, the goddess of wisdom, stands watching. A fragment from Pherecydes of Athens states that Jason killed the dragon, but fragments from the &quot;Naupactica&quot; and from Herodorus state that he merely stole the Fleece and escaped. In Euripides&#x27;s &quot;Medea&quot;, Medea boasts that she killed the Colchian dragon herself. In the final scene of the play, Medea also flies away on a chariot pulled by two dragons. In the most famous retelling of the story from Apollonius of Rhodes&#x27;s &quot;Argonautica&quot;, Medea drugs the dragon to sleep, allowing Jason to steal the Fleece. Greek vase paintings show her feeding the dragon the sleeping drug in a liquid form from a &quot;phialē&quot;, or shallow cup.
In the founding myth of Thebes, Cadmus, a Phoenician prince, was instructed by Apollo to follow a heifer and found a city wherever it laid down. Cadmus and his men followed the heifer and, when it laid down, Cadmus ordered his men to find a spring so he could sacrifice the heifer to Athena. His men found a spring, but it was guarded by a dragon, which had been placed there by the god Ares, and the dragon killed them. Cadmus killed the dragon in revenge, either by smashing its head with a rock or using his sword. Following the advice of Athena, Cadmus tore out the dragon&#x27;s teeth and planted them in the earth. An army of giant warriors (known as &quot;spartoi&quot;, which means &quot;sown men&quot;) grew from the teeth like plants. Cadmus hurled stones into their midst, causing them to kill each other until only five were left. To make restitution for having killed Ares&#x27;s dragon, Cadmus was forced to serve Ares as a slave for eight years. At the end of this period, Cadmus married Harmonia, the daughter of Ares and Aphrodite. Cadmus and Harmonia moved to Illyria, where they ruled as king and queen, before eventually being transformed into dragons themselves.

In the fifth century BC, the Greek historian Herodotus reported in Book IV of his &quot;Histories&quot; that western Libya was inhabited by monstrous serpents and, in Book III, he states that Arabia was home to many small, winged serpents, which came in a variety of colors and enjoyed the trees that produced frankincense. Herodotus remarks that the serpent&#x27;s wings were like those of bats and that, unlike vipers, which are found in every land, winged serpents are only found in Arabia. The second-century BC Greek astronomer Hipparchus ( 190 BC –  120 BC) listed the constellation Draco (&quot;the dragon&quot;) as one of forty-six constellations. Hipparchus described the constellation as containing fifteen stars, but the later astronomer Ptolemy ( 100 –  170 AD) increased this number to thirty-one in his &quot;Almagest&quot;.

In the New Testament, Revelation 12:3, written by John of Patmos, describes a vision of a Great Red Dragon with seven heads, ten horns, seven crowns, and a massive tail, an image which is clearly inspired by the vision of the four beasts from the sea in the Book of Daniel and the Leviathan described in various Old Testament passages. The Great Red Dragon knocks &quot;a third of the sun ... a third of the moon, and a third of the stars&quot; out of the sky and pursues the Woman of the Apocalypse. Revelation 12:7–9 declares: &quot;And war broke out in Heaven. Michael and his angels fought against Dragon. Dragon and his angels fought back, but they were defeated, and there was no longer any place for them in Heaven. Dragon the Great was thrown down, that ancient serpent who is called Devil and Satan, the one deceiving the whole inhabited World – he was thrown down to earth and his angels were thrown down with him.&quot; Then a voice booms down from Heaven heralding the defeat of &quot;the Accuser&quot; (&quot;ho Kantegor&quot;).

In , Flavius Philostratus discussed dragons (δράκων, drákōn) in India in &quot;The Life of Apollonius of Tyana&quot; (II,17 and III,6–8). The Loeb Classical Library translation (by F.C. Conybeare) mentions (III,7) that, &quot;In most respects the tusks resemble the largest swine&#x27;s, but they are slighter in build and twisted, and have a point as unabraded as sharks&#x27; teeth.&quot; According to a collection of books by Claudius Aelianus called &quot;On Animals&quot;, Ethiopia was inhabited by a species of dragon that hunted elephants and could grow to a length of 180 feet (55 m) with a lifespan rivaling that of the most enduring of animals. In the 4th century, Basil of Caesarea, on chapter IX of his Address to Young Men on Greek Literature, mentions mythological dragons as guarding treasures and riches.

In the Old Norse poem &quot;Grímnismál&quot; in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, the dragon Níðhöggr is described as gnawing on the roots of Yggdrasil, the world tree. In Norse mythology, Jörmungandr is a giant serpent that encircles the entire realm of Miðgarð in the sea around it. According to the &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; from the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, written by the thirteenth-century Icelandic mythographer Snorri Sturluson, Thor, the Norse god of thunder, once went out on a boat with the giant Hymnir to the outer sea and fished for Jörmungandr using an ox-head as bait. Thor caught the serpent and, after pulling its head out of the water, smashed it with his hammer, Mjölnir. Snorri states that the blow was not fatal: &quot;and men say that he struck its head off on the sea bed. But I think the truth to tell you is that the Miðgarð Serpent still lives and lies in the surrounding sea.&quot;

Towards the end of the Old English epic poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;, a slave steals a cup from the hoard of a sleeping dragon, causing the dragon to wake up and go on a rampage of destruction across the countryside. The eponymous hero of the poem insists on confronting the dragon alone, even though he is of advanced age, but Wiglaf, the youngest of the twelve warriors Beowulf has brought with him, insists on accompanying his king into the battle. Beowulf&#x27;s sword shatters during the fight and he is mortally wounded, but Wiglaf comes to his rescue and helps him slay the dragon. Beowulf dies and tells Wiglaf that the dragon&#x27;s treasure must be buried rather than shared with the cowardly warriors who did not come to the aid of their king.

In the Old Norse &quot;Völsunga saga&quot;, the hero Sigurd catches the dragon Fafnir by digging a pit between the cave where he lives and the spring where he drinks his water and kills him by stabbing him in the underside. At the advice of Odin, Sigurd drains Fafnir&#x27;s blood and drinks it, which gives him the ability to understand the language of the birds, who he hears talking about how his mentor Regin is plotting to betray him so that he can keep all of Fafnir&#x27;s treasure for himself. The motif of a hero trying to sneak past a sleeping dragon and steal some of its treasure is common throughout many Old Norse sagas. The fourteenth-century &quot;Flóres saga konungs ok sona hans&quot; describes a hero who is actively concerned not to wake a sleeping dragon while sneaking past it. In the &quot;Yngvars saga víðförla&quot;, the protagonist attempts to steal treasure from several sleeping dragons, but accidentally wakes them up.

===Post-classical===

The modern, western image of a dragon developed in western Europe during the Middle Ages through the combination of the snakelike dragons of classical Graeco-Roman literature, references to Near Eastern dragons preserved in the Bible, and western European folk traditions. The period between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries represents the height of European interest in dragons as living creatures. The twelfth-century Welsh monk, Geoffrey of Monmouth, recounts a famous legend in his &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; in which the child prophet Merlin witnesses the Romano-Celtic warlord Vortigern attempt to build a tower on Snowdon to keep safe from the Anglo-Saxons, but the tower keeps being swallowed into the ground. Merlin informs Vortigern that, underneath the foundation he has built, is a pool with two dragons sleeping in it. Vortigern orders for the pool to be drained, exposing a red dragon and a white dragon, who immediately begin fighting. Merlin delivers a prophecy that the white dragon will triumph over the red, symbolizing England&#x27;s conquest of Wales, but declares that the red dragon will eventually return and defeat the white one. This story remained popular throughout the fifteenth century.

Dragons are generally depicted as living in rivers or having an underground lair or cave. They are envisioned as greedy and gluttonous, with voracious appetites. They are often identified with Satan, due to the references to Satan as a &quot;dragon&quot; in the Book of Revelation. The thirteenth-century &quot;Golden Legend&quot;, written in Latin, records the story of Saint Margaret of Antioch, a virgin martyr who, after being tortured for her faith in the Diocletianic Persecution and thrown back into her cell, is said to have been confronted by a monstrous dragon, but she made the sign of the cross and the dragon vanished. In some versions of the story, she is actually swallowed by the dragon alive and, after making the sign of the cross in the dragon&#x27;s stomach, emerges unharmed.
The legend of Saint George and the Dragon may be referenced as early as the sixth century AD, but the earliest artistic representations of it come from the eleventh century and the first full account of it comes from an eleventh-century Georgian text. The most famous version of the story from the &quot;Golden Legend&quot; holds that a dragon kept pillaging the sheep of the town of Silene in Libya. After it ate a young shepherd, the people were forced to placate it by leaving two sheep as sacrificial offerings every morning beside the lake where the dragon lived. Eventually, the dragon ate all of the sheep and the people were forced to start offering it their own children. One day, the king&#x27;s own daughter came up in the lottery and, despite the king&#x27;s pleas for her life, she was dressed as a bride and chained to a rock beside the lake to be eaten. Then, Saint George arrived and saw the princess. When the dragon arrived to eat her, he stabbed it with his lance and subdued it by making the sign of the cross and tying the princess&#x27;s girdle around its neck. Saint George and the princess led the now-docile dragon into the town and George promised to kill it if the townspeople would convert to Christianity. All the townspeople converted and Saint George killed the dragon with his sword. In some versions, Saint George marries the princess, but, in others, he continues wandering.
Dragons are well known in myths and legends of Spain, in no small part because St. George (Catalan Sant Jordi) is the patron saint of Catalonia. Like most mythical reptiles, the Catalan dragon (Catalan drac) is an enormous serpent-like creature with four legs and a pair of wings, or rarely, a two-legged creature with a pair of wings, called a wyvern. As in many other parts of the world, the dragon&#x27;s face may be like that of some other animal, such as a lion or a bull. As is common elsewhere, Catalan dragons are fire-breathers, and the dragon-fire is all-consuming. Catalan dragons also can emit a fetid odor, which can rot away anything it touches.

Gargoyles are carved stone figures sometimes resembling dragons that originally served as waterspouts on buildings. Precursors to the medieval gargoyle can be found on ancient Greek and Egyptian temples, but, over the course of the Middle Ages, many fantastic stories were invented to explain them. One medieval French legend holds that, in ancient times, a fearsome dragon known as &quot;La Gargouille&quot; had been causing floods and sinking ships on the river Seine, so the people of the town of Rouen would offer the dragon a human sacrifice once each year to appease its hunger. Then, around 600 AD, a priest named Romanus promised that, if the people would build a church, he would rid them of the dragon. Romanus slew the dragon and its severed head was mounted on the walls of the city as the first gargoyle.

Dragons are prominent in medieval heraldry. Uther Pendragon was famously said to have had two gold dragons crowned with red standing back-to-back on his royal coat of arms. Originally, heraldic dragons could have any number of legs, but, by the late Middle Ages, due to the widespread proliferation of bestiaries, heraldry began to distinguish between a &quot;dragon&quot; (which could only have exactly four legs) and a &quot;wyvern&quot; (which could only have exactly two). In myths, wyverns are associated with viciousness, envy, and pestilence, but, in heraldry, they are used as symbols for overthrowing the tyranny of Satan and his demonic forces. Late medieval heraldry also distinguished a draconic creature known as a &quot;cockatrice&quot;. A cockatrice is supposedly born when a serpent hatches an egg that has been laid on a dunghill by a rooster and it is so venomous that its breath and its gaze are both lethal to any living creature, except for a weasel, which is the cockatrice&#x27;s mortal enemy. A basilisk is a serpent with the head of a dragon at the end of its tail that is born when a toad hatches an egg that has been laid in a midden by a nine-year-old cockatrice. Like the cockatrice, its glare is said to be deadly.

===Post-classical Eastern===

In Albanian mythology and folklore, &quot;stihi&quot;, &quot;ljubi&quot;, &quot;bolla, bollar, errshaja, and kulshedra&quot; are mythological figures described as serpentine dragons. It is believed that &quot;bolla&quot;, a water and chthonic demonic serpent, undergoes metamorphosis passing through four distinct phases if it lives many years without being seen by a human. The &quot;bollar&quot; and &quot;errshaja&quot; are the intermediate stages, while the &quot;kulshedra&quot; is the ultimate phase, described as a huge multi-headed fire-spitting female serpent which causes drought, storms, flooding, earthquakes, and other natural disasters against mankind. She is usually fought and defeated by a drangue, a semi-human winged divine hero and protector of humans. Heavy thunderstorms are thought to be the result of their battles.

In Slavic mythology, the words &quot;zmey&quot;, &quot;&quot;zmiy&quot;,&quot; or &quot;zmaj&quot; are used to describe dragons. These words are masculine forms of the Slavic word for &quot;snake&quot;, which are normally feminine (like Russian &quot;zmeya&quot;). In Romania, there is a similar figure, derived from the Slavic dragon and named &quot;zmeu&quot;. Exclusively in Polish and Belarusian folklore, as well as in the other Slavic folklores, a dragon is also called (variously) &quot;смок&quot;, &quot;цмок&quot;, or &quot;smok&quot;. In South Slavic folklores, the same thing is also called &quot;lamya&quot; (ламя, ламjа, lamja). Although quite similar to other European dragons, Slavic dragons have their peculiarities.

In Russian and Ukrainian folklore, Zmey Gorynych is a dragon with three heads, each one bearing twin goatlike horns. He is said to have breathed fire and smelled of sulfur. It was believed that eclipses were caused by Gorynych temporarily swallowing the sun. According to one legend, Gorynych&#x27;s uncle was the evil sorcerer Nemal Chelovek, who abducted the daughter of the tsar and imprisoned her in his castle in the Ural Mountains. Many knights tried to free her, but all of them were killed by Gorynych&#x27;s fire. Then a palace guard in Moscow named Ivan Tsarevich overheard two crows talking about the princess. He went to the tsar, who gave him a magic sword, and snuck into the castle. When Chelovek attacked Ivan in the form of a giant, the sword flew from Ivan&#x27;s hand unbidden and killed him. Then the sword cut off all three of Gorynych&#x27;s heads at once. Ivan brought the princess back to the tsar, who declared Ivan a nobleman and allowed him to marry the princess.

A popular Polish folk tale is the legend of the Wawel Dragon, which is first recorded in the &quot;Chronica Polonorum&quot; of Wincenty Kadłubek, written between 1190 and 1208. According to Kadłubek, the dragon appeared during the reign of King Krakus and demanded to be fed a fixed number of cattle every week. If the villagers failed to provide enough cattle, the dragon would eat the same number of villagers as the number of cattle they had failed to provide. Krakus ordered his sons to slay the dragon. Since they could not slay it by hand, they tricked the dragon into eating calfskins filled with burning sulfur. Once the dragon was dead, the younger brother attacked and murdered his older brother and returned home to claim all the glory for himself, telling his father that his brother had died fighting the dragon. The younger brother became king after his father died, but his secret was eventually revealed and he was banished. In the fifteenth century, Jan Długosz rewrote the story so that King Krakus himself was the one who slew the dragon. Another version of the story told by Marcin Bielski instead has the clever shoemaker Skuba come up with the idea for slaying the dragon. Bielski&#x27;s version is now the most popular.

==Modern depictions==
Dragons and dragon motifs are featured in many works of modern literature, particularly within the fantasy genre. As early as the eighteenth century, critical thinkers such as Denis Diderot were already asserting that too much literature had been published on dragons: &quot;There are already in books all too many fabulous stories of dragons&quot;. In Lewis Carroll&#x27;s classic children&#x27;s novel &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot; (1871), one of the inset poems describes the Jabberwock, a kind of dragon. Carroll&#x27;s illustrator John Tenniel, a famous political cartoonist, humorously showed the Jabberwock with the waistcoat, buck teeth, and myopic eyes of a Victorian university lecturer, such as Carroll himself. In works of comedic children&#x27;s fantasy, dragons often fulfill the role of a magic fairy tale helper. In such works, rather than being frightening as they are traditionally portrayed, dragons are instead represented as harmless, benevolent, and inferior to humans. They are sometimes shown living in contact with humans, or in isolated communities of only dragons. Though popular in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, &quot;such comic and idyllic stories&quot; began to grow increasingly rare after the 1960s, due to demand for more serious children&#x27;s literature.

One of the most iconic modern dragons is Smaug from J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s classic novel, &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. Dragons also appear in the best-selling &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series of children&#x27;s novels by J. K. Rowling. Other prominent works depicting dragons include Anne McCaffrey&#x27;s &quot;Dragonriders of Pern&quot;, Ursula K. Le Guin&#x27;s &quot;Earthsea Cycle&quot;, George R. R. Martin&#x27;s series &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot;, and Christopher Paolini&#x27;s &quot;The Inheritance Cycle&quot;. Sandra Martina Schwab writes, &quot;With a few exceptions, including McCaffrey&#x27;s Pern novels and the 2002 film &quot;Reign of Fire&quot;, dragons seem to fit more into the medievalized setting of fantasy literature than into the more technological world of science fiction. Indeed, they have been called the emblem of fantasy. The hero&#x27;s fight against the dragon emphasizes and celebrates his masculinity, whereas revisionist fantasies of dragons and dragon-slaying often undermine traditional gender roles. In children&#x27;s literature (such as Cressida Cowell&#x27;s &quot;How to Train Your Dragon&quot; series) the friendly dragon may become a powerful ally in battling the child&#x27;s fears.&quot; The popular role-playing game system &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (D&amp;D) makes heavy use of dragons.

<text>Depeche Mode are an English electronic music band formed in Basildon, Essex in 1980. Originally formed with the lineup of Dave Gahan, Martin Gore, Andy Fletcher and Vince Clarke, the band currently consists of Gahan and Gore.

With Clarke as their primary songwriter, Depeche Mode released their debut album &quot;Speak &amp; Spell&quot; in 1981 amid the British new wave scene. Clarke left the band at the end of 1981, going on to form the groups Yazoo and later Erasure. The remaining trio recorded their second album, &quot;A Broken Frame&quot; (1982), with Martin Gore as chief songwriter. The band then recruited Alan Wilder, establishing a lineup that continued until 1995, beginning with the albums &quot;Construction Time Again&quot; (1983) and &quot;Some Great Reward&quot; (1984). The albums &quot;Black Celebration&quot; (1986) and &quot;Music for the Masses&quot; (1987) cemented them as a dominant force within the electronic and alternative music scenes, and their June 1988 concert at the Pasadena Rose Bowl drew a crowd of over 60,000 people.

In 1990, they released their seventh album, &quot;Violator&quot;, which reached number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified triple platinum by the RIAA. The following album &quot;Songs of Faith and Devotion&quot; (1993) was also a success, though the band&#x27;s internal struggles during recording and touring resulted in Wilder&#x27;s departure in 1995. The band returned to the lineup of Gahan, Gore, and Fletcher, and released the album &quot;Ultra&quot; in 1997. The band continued touring and recorded five more albums as a trio—&quot;Exciter&quot; (2001), &quot;Playing the Angel&quot; (2005), &quot;Sounds of the Universe&quot; (2009), &quot;Delta Machine&quot; (2013) and &quot;Spirit&quot; (2017)—until Fletcher&#x27;s death in 2022. Gahan and Gore have since continued as a duo. Their latest album, &quot;Memento Mori&quot;, was released in 2023.

Depeche Mode have had 54 songs in the UK Singles Chart, 17 Top 10 albums in the UK chart, and have sold more than 100 million records worldwide. &quot;Q&quot; included the band in its list of the &quot;50 Bands That Changed the World!&quot; Depeche Mode also rank No. 98 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time.&quot; In 2016, &quot;Billboard&quot; named Depeche Mode the 10th Greatest of All Time Top Dance Club Artists. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2020.

==History==
===Formation (1977–1980)===

Depeche Mode&#x27;s origins date to 1977, when schoolmates Vince Clarke and Andy Fletcher formed a band called No Romance in China with Clarke on vocals and guitar and Fletcher on bass. Fletcher would later recall, &quot;Why am I in the band? It was accidental right from the beginning. I was actually forced to be in the band. I played the guitar and I had a bass; it was a question of them roping me in.&quot; In 1979, Clarke played guitar in an Ultravox-influenced band, the Plan, with friends Robert Marlow and Paul Langwith. In 1978–1979, Martin Gore played guitar in an acoustic duo, Norman and the Worms, with school friend Phil Burdett on vocals. In 1980, Clarke and Fletcher formed a band called Composition of Sound, with Clarke on vocals/guitar and Fletcher on bass; the pair were soon joined by Gore as a third instrumentalist. Dave Gahan joined the ensemble later in 1980 after Clarke heard him perform at a local Scout hut jam session, singing a rendition of David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Heroes&quot;.

With the advent of affordable synthesisers and the increasing popularity of electronic music, the group began pursuing a synth-pop direction. The first live concert of Composition of Sound as a four-piece was on 14 June 1980 at Nicholas School, Basildon, England, UK. There is a plaque commemorating the gig at the James Hornsby School in Basildon, where Gore and Fletcher were pupils. Gahan&#x27;s and Gore&#x27;s favourite artists included Siouxsie and the Banshees, Sparks, Cabaret Voltaire, Talking Heads and Iggy Pop. Gahan&#x27;s onstage persona was influenced by Dave Vanian, frontman of The Damned. Gahan has also later credited David Bowie, James Brown, Elvis Presley and Prince as influences on his performance style.

Composition of Sound would become embarrassed about their band name and started thinking of changing it. There were several potential variants, including the name &quot;Musical Moments&quot; that was suggested by Vince Clarke as both a band name and the name of their first album. Starting at their concert on 24 September 1980 at Bridge House, the band changed their name to Depeche Mode, chosen by Dave Gahan. When explaining the choice for the new name, which was taken from a mistranslation of the name of French fashion magazine &quot;Dépêche Mode&quot;, Gore said, &quot;It means &#x27;hurried fashion&#x27; or &#x27;fashion dispatch&#x27;. I like the sound of that.&quot; However, the more accurate translation of the magazine&#x27;s name (and therefore the band&#x27;s name) is &quot;Fashion News&quot; or &quot;Fashion Update&quot;.

===&quot;Speak &amp; Spell&quot; and Clarke&#x27;s departure (1980–1981)===

The band made their recording debut in late 1980 for the &quot;Some Bizzare Album&quot; (released in 1981) with the song &quot;Photographic&quot;, later re-recorded for their debut album &quot;Speak &amp; Spell&quot;.

The band made a demo tape but, instead of mailing the tape to record labels, they would go in and personally deliver it. They would demand the labels play it; according to Dave Gahan, &quot;most of them would tell us to fuck off. They&#x27;d say &#x27;leave the tape with us&#x27; and we&#x27;d say &#x27;it&#x27;s our only one&#x27;. Then we&#x27;d say goodbye and go somewhere else.&quot;

According to Gahan, prior to securing their record contract, they were receiving offers from all the major labels. Phonogram offered them &quot;money you could never have imagined and all sorts of crazy things like clothes allowances&quot;.

While playing a live gig at the Bridge House in Canning Town, the band was approached by Daniel Miller, an electronic producer and founder of Mute Records, who was interested in their recording a single for his burgeoning label. The result of this verbal contract was their first single, &quot;Dreaming of Me&quot;, recorded in December 1980 and released in February 1981. It reached number 57 in the UK charts. Encouraged by this, the band recorded their second single, &quot;New Life&quot;, which climbed to number 11 in the UK charts and got them an appearance on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. The band went to London by train, carrying their synthesisers all the way to the BBC studios.

The band&#x27;s next single was &quot;Just Can&#x27;t Get Enough&quot;. The synth-pop single became the band&#x27;s first UK top ten hit. The video is the only one to feature Vince Clarke. Depeche Mode&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Speak &amp; Spell&quot;, was released in October 1981 and peaked at number ten on the UK album charts. Critical reviews were mixed; &quot;Melody Maker&quot; described it as a &quot;great album … one they had to make to conquer fresh audiences and please the fans who just can&#x27;t get enough&quot;, while &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; was more critical, calling the album &quot;PG-rated fluff&quot;.

Clarke began to voice his discomfort at the direction the band was taking, saying &quot;there was never enough time to do anything. Not with all the interviews and photo sessions&quot;. Clarke also said he was sick of touring, which Gahan said years later was &quot;bullshit to be quite honest&quot;. Gahan went on to say he &quot;suddenly lost interest in it and he started getting letters from fans asking what kind of socks he wore.&quot; In November 1981, Clarke publicly announced that he was leaving Depeche Mode.

Soon afterwards, Clarke joined up with blues singer Alison Moyet to form Yazoo (or Yaz in the United States). Initial talk of Clarke&#x27;s continuing to write material for Depeche Mode ultimately amounted to nothing. According to third-party sources, Clarke offered the remaining members of Depeche Mode the track &quot;Only You&quot;, but they declined. Clarke, however, denied in an interview that such an offer ever took place saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t know where that came from. That&#x27;s not true.&quot; The song went on to become a UK Top 3 hit for Yazoo. Gore, who had written &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; and the instrumental &quot;Big Muff&quot; for &quot;Speak &amp; Spell&quot;, became the band&#x27;s main composer and lyricist.

===&quot;A Broken Frame&quot; and Wilder joining (1981–1982)===

In late 1981, the band placed an anonymous ad in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; looking for another musician: &quot;Name band, synthesise, must be under twenty-one.&quot; Alan Wilder, a classically trained keyboardist from West London, responded and, after two auditions and despite being 22 years old, was hired in early 1982, initially on a trial basis as a touring member. Wilder would later be called the &quot;Musical Director&quot; of the band, responsible for the band&#x27;s sound until his departure in 1995. As producer Flood would say, &quot;[Alan] is sort of the craftsman, Martin&#x27;s the idea man and [Dave] is the attitude.&quot;

In January 1982, the band released &quot;See You&quot;, their first single without Clarke, which managed to beat all three Clarke-penned singles in the UK charts, reaching number six. The following tour saw the band playing their first shows in North America. Two more singles, &quot;The Meaning of Love&quot; and &quot;Leave in Silence&quot;, were released ahead of the band&#x27;s second studio album, on which they began work in July 1982. Daniel Miller informed Wilder that he wasn&#x27;t needed for the recording of the album, as the core trio wanted to prove they could succeed without Vince Clarke. &quot;A Broken Frame&quot; was released that September, and the following month the band began their 1982 tour.

===&quot;Construction Time Again&quot; (1983)===
A non-album single, &quot;Get the Balance Right!&quot;, was released in January 1983, the first Depeche Mode track to be recorded with Wilder, now an official member of the band. For their third album, &quot;Construction Time Again&quot;, Depeche Mode worked with producer Gareth Jones, at John Foxx&#x27;s Garden Studios and at Hansa Studios in West Berlin (where much of David Bowie&#x27;s seminal Berlin Trilogy featuring Brian Eno had been produced). The album saw a dramatic shift in the group&#x27;s sound, due in part to Wilder&#x27;s introduction of the Synclavier and E-mu Emulator samplers. By sampling the noises of everyday objects, the band created an eclectic, industrial-influenced sound, with similarities to groups such as the Art of Noise and Einstürzende Neubauten (the latter becoming Mute labelmates in 1983).

&quot;Everything Counts&quot; rose to number six in the UK, also reaching the top 30 in Ireland, South Africa, Switzerland, Sweden and West Germany. Wilder contributed two songs to the album, &quot;The Landscape Is Changing&quot; and &quot;Two Minute Warning&quot;. In September 1983, to promote &quot;Construction Time Again&quot;, the band launched a European concert tour.

===&quot;Some Great Reward&quot; (1984)===
In their early years, Depeche Mode had really attained success only in Europe and Australia. This changed in March 1984, when they released the single &quot;People Are People&quot;. The song became a hit, reaching No. 2 in Ireland and Poland, No. 4 in the UK and Switzerland, and No. 1 in West Germany – the first time a DM single topped a country&#x27;s singles chart – where it was used as the theme to West German TV&#x27;s coverage of the 1984 Olympics. Beyond this European success, the song also reached No. 13 on the US charts in mid-1985, the first appearance of a DM single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and was a Top 20 hit in Canada. &quot;People Are People&quot; became an anthem for the LGBT community, regularly played at gay establishments and gay pride festivals in the late 1980s. Sire, the band&#x27;s North American record label, released a compilation of the same name which included tracks from &quot;A Broken Frame&quot; and &quot;Construction Time Again&quot; as well as several B-sides.

On the American tour, the band was, according to Gore, &quot;shocked by the way the fans were turning up in droves at the concerts&quot;. He said that although the concerts were selling well, Depeche Mode struggled to sell records.

In September 1984, &quot;Some Great Reward&quot; was released. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; claimed that the album made one &quot;sit up and take notice of what is happening here, right under your nose.&quot; In contrast to the political and environmental subjects addressed on the previous album, the songs on &quot;Some Great Reward&quot; were mostly concerned with more personal themes such as sexual politics (&quot;Master and Servant&quot;), adulterous relationships (&quot;Lie to Me&quot;), and arbitrary divine justice (&quot;Blasphemous Rumours&quot;). Also included was the first Martin Gore ballad, &quot;Somebody&quot;—such songs would become a feature of all following albums. &quot;Somebody&quot; was released as a double A-side with &quot;Blasphemous Rumours&quot;, and was the first single with Gore on lead vocal. &quot;Some Great Reward&quot; became the first Depeche Mode album to enter the US album charts, and made the Top 10 in several European countries.

&quot;The World We Live In and Live in Hamburg&quot; was the band&#x27;s first video release, almost an entire concert from their 1984 Some Great Reward Tour.

===&quot;Black Celebration&quot; (1985–1986)===
In July 1985, the band played their first-ever concerts behind the Iron Curtain, in Budapest and Warsaw. In October 1985, Mute released a compilation, &quot;The Singles 81→85&quot; (&quot;Catching Up with Depeche Mode&quot; in the US), which included the two new non-album hit singles &quot;Shake the Disease&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Called a Heart&quot;, with the US version also including their B-sides (&quot;Fly on the Windscreen&quot;, the B-side of &quot;It&#x27;s Called a Heart&quot;, would also be included on the next studio album &quot;Black Celebration&quot;).

In the United States, the band&#x27;s music appealed primarily to an alternative audience who were disenchanted with the predominance of &quot;soft rock and &#x27;disco hell&#x27;&quot; on the radio. This view of the band was in sharp contrast to how the band was perceived in Europe, despite the increasingly dark and serious tone in their songs. In Germany, France, and other European countries, Depeche Mode were considered teen idols and regularly featured in European teen magazines, becoming one of the most famous synth-pop bands in the mid-&#x27;80s.
Depeche Mode&#x27;s musical style shifted slightly again in 1986 with the release of their fifteenth single, &quot;Stripped&quot;, and its accompanying album &quot;Black Celebration&quot;. Retaining their often imaginative sampling and beginning to move away from the &quot;industrial pop&quot; sound that had characterised their previous two LPs, the band introduced an ominous, highly atmospheric and textured sound. Gore&#x27;s lyrics also took on a darker tone and became more pessimistic.

The music video for &quot;A Question of Time&quot; was the first to be directed by Anton Corbijn, beginning a working relationship that continues to the present. Corbijn has directed 22 of the band&#x27;s videos. He has also filmed some of their live performances and designed stage sets, as well as most covers for albums and singles starting from &quot;Violator&quot;.

===&quot;Music for the Masses&quot; (1987–1989)===

For 1987&#x27;s &quot;Music for the Masses&quot;, the band&#x27;s sound and working methods continued to develop. It was the first time they worked with a producer not related to Mute Records. Dave Bascombe was called to assist with the recording sessions; although, according to Alan Wilder, Bascombe&#x27;s role ended up being more that of engineer. In making the album, the band largely eschewed sampling in favour of synthesiser experimentation. While chart performance of the singles &quot;Strangelove&quot;, &quot;Never Let Me Down Again&quot; and &quot;Behind the Wheel&quot; proved to be disappointing in the UK, they performed well in countries such as Canada, Brazil, West Germany, South Africa, Sweden and Switzerland, often reaching the top 10. &quot;Record Mirror&quot; described &quot;Music for the Masses&quot; as &quot;the most accomplished and sexy Mode album to date&quot;. The album also reached No. 35 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart.

The Music for the Masses Tour began 22 October 1987. On 7 March 1988, with no previous announcement that they would be the headlining act, Depeche Mode played in the Werner-Seelenbinder-Halle, East Berlin, becoming one of the few Western groups to perform in East Germany. They also performed concerts in Budapest and Prague in 1988. 

The world tour ended on 18 June 1988 with a concert at the Pasadena Rose Bowl. Paid attendance of 60,453 was the highest in eight years for the venue. Its massive success marked a breakthrough for the band in the United States.. The event was documented in &quot;101&quot;, a concert film by D. A. Pennebaker and its accompanying soundtrack album. The film is notable for its portrayal of fan interaction. Alan Wilder came up with the title, noting that it was the 101st and final performance of the tour. On 7 September 1988, Depeche Mode performed &quot;Strangelove&quot; at the 1988 MTV Video Music Awards at the Universal Amphitheatre in Los Angeles.

===&quot;Violator&quot; (1989–1990)===

In mid-1989, the band began recording in Milan with producer Flood and engineer François Kevorkian. The initial result of this session was the single &quot;Personal Jesus&quot;. Prior to its release, a marketing campaign was launched with advertisements placed in the personals columns of UK regional newspapers with the words &quot;Your own personal Jesus.&quot; Later, the ads included a phone number one could dial to hear the song. The resulting furore helped propel the single to number 13 on the UK charts, becoming one of their biggest sellers to date. In the United States, it was their first gold single and their first Top 40 hit since &quot;People Are People&quot;, eventually becoming the biggest-selling 12-inch single in Warner Records&#x27; history up to that point.
Released in February 1990, &quot;Enjoy the Silence&quot; reached number six in the UK (the first Top 10 hit in that country since &quot;Master And Servant&quot;). A few months later it reached number eight in the US and earned the band a second gold record, and it won Best British Single at the 1991 Brit Awards. To promote their new album, &quot;Violator&quot;, the band held an in-store autograph signing at Wherehouse Entertainment in Los Angeles. The event attracted approximately 20,000 fans and turned into a near riot. Some attendees were injured while being pressed against the store&#x27;s glass by the crowd. As an apology to those injured, the band released a limited edition cassette tape to fans in Los Angeles, distributed through radio station KROQ (the sponsor of the Wherehouse event).

&quot;Violator&quot; was the first Depeche Mode album to enter the Top 10 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, reaching Number 7 and staying 74 weeks in the chart. It was certified triple platinum in America. Two more singles from the album—&quot;Policy of Truth&quot; and &quot;World in My Eyes&quot;—were hits in the UK, with the former also charting in the US.
The World Violation Tour saw the band play several stadium shows in the US. 42,000 tickets were sold within four hours for a show at Giants Stadium, and 48,000 tickets were sold within half-an-hour of going on sale for a show at Dodger Stadium. An estimated 1.2 million fans saw this tour worldwide.

===&quot;Songs of Faith and Devotion&quot; and Wilder&#x27;s departure (1991–1995)===
In 1991, Depeche Mode contribution &quot;Death&#x27;s Door&quot; was released on the soundtrack album for the film &quot;Until the End of the World&quot;. Film director Wim Wenders had challenged musical artists to write music the way they imagined they would in the year 2000, the setting of the movie.

The members of Depeche Mode regrouped in Madrid in February 1992. Gahan had become interested in the new grunge scene sweeping the US and was influenced by the likes of Jane&#x27;s Addiction, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains and Nirvana.

In 1993, &quot;Songs of Faith and Devotion&quot;, again with Flood producing, saw them experimenting with arrangements based as much on heavily distorted electric guitars and live drums (played by Alan Wilder, whose debut as a studio drummer had come on the &quot;Violator&quot; track &quot;Clean&quot;) as on synthesisers. Live strings, uilleann pipes and female gospel vocals were other new additions to the band&#x27;s sound. The album debuted at number one in both the UK and the US, only the sixth British act to achieve such a distinction to date. The first single from the album was the grunge-influenced &quot;I Feel You&quot;. The gospel influences are most noticeable on the album&#x27;s third single, &quot;Condemnation&quot;. Interviews given by the band during this period tended to be conducted separately, unlike earlier albums, where the band was interviewed as a group.

The Devotional Tour followed, documented by a concert film of the same name. The film was directed by Anton Corbijn, and in 1995 earned the band their first Grammy nomination. The band&#x27;s second live album, &quot;Songs of Faith and Devotion Live&quot;, was released in December 1993. The tour continued into 1994 with the Exotic Tour, which began in February 1994 in South Africa, and ended in April in Mexico. The final leg of the tour, consisting of more North American dates, followed shortly thereafter and ran until July. As a whole, the Devotional Tour is to date the longest and most geographically diverse Depeche Mode tour, spanning fourteen months and 159 individual performances.

&quot;Q&quot; magazine described the 1993 Devotional Tour as &quot;The Most Debauched Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Tour Ever&quot;. According to &quot;The Independent&quot;, the &quot;smack-blasted&quot; Gahan &quot;required cortisone shots just to perform, borderline alcoholic Gore suffered two stress-induced seizures, and Andrew Fletcher&#x27;s deepening depression resulted, in the summer of 1994, in a full nervous breakdown.&quot; After the band played at the McNichols Sports Arena in Denver, Colorado, local police arrested Gore and fined him $50 for disturbing the peace when he held a loud party in his hotel room. Fletcher declined to participate in the second half of the Exotic Tour due to mental instability; he was replaced on stage by Daryl Bamonte, who had worked with the band as a personal assistant since the beginning of their career in 1980.

In June 1995, Alan Wilder announced that he was leaving Depeche Mode, explaining:
He continued to work on his personal project Recoil, releasing a fourth album (&quot;Unsound Methods&quot;) in 1997.

===&quot;Ultra&quot; (1996–1998)===

Despite Gahan&#x27;s increasingly severe personal problems, Gore tried repeatedly during 1995 and 1996 to get the band recording again. However, Gahan would rarely turn up to scheduled sessions, and when he did, it would take weeks to get any vocals recorded; one six-week session at Electric Lady in New York produced just one usable vocal (for &quot;Sister of Night&quot;), and even that was pieced together from multiple takes. Gore was forced to contemplate breaking the band up and considered releasing the songs he had written as a solo album. In mid-1996, after his near-fatal overdose in which his heart stopped beating for two minutes, Gahan entered a court-ordered drug rehabilitation program to battle his addiction to cocaine and heroin. With Gahan out of rehab in 1996, Depeche Mode held recording sessions with producer Tim Simenon.

Preceded by two singles, &quot;Barrel of a Gun&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s No Good&quot;, the album &quot;Ultra&quot; was released in April 1997. The album debuted at No. 1 in the UK as well as Germany, and No. 5 in the US. The band did not tour in support of the album, with Fletcher quoted as saying: &quot;We&#x27;re not fit enough. Dave&#x27;s only eight months into his sobriety, and our bodies are telling us to spend time with our families.&quot; As part of the promotion for the release of the album, they did perform two short concerts in London and Los Angeles, promoted as &quot;Ultra Parties&quot;. &quot;Ultra&quot; spawned two further singles, &quot;Home&quot; and &quot;Useless&quot;.

A second singles compilation, &quot;The Singles 86&gt;98&quot;, was released in 1998, preceded by the new single &quot;Only When I Lose Myself&quot;. In April 1998, Depeche Mode held a press conference at the Hyatt Hotel in Cologne to announce the Singles Tour. The tour was the first to feature two backing musicians in place of Wilder—Austrian drummer Christian Eigner and British keyboardist Peter Gordeno.

===&quot;Exciter&quot; (1999–2004)===

In 2001, Depeche Mode released &quot;Exciter&quot;, produced by Mark Bell (of techno group LFO). Bell introduced a minimalist, digital sound to much of the album, influenced by IDM and glitch. &quot;Dream On&quot;, &quot;I Feel Loved&quot;, &quot;Freelove&quot; and &quot;Goodnight Lovers&quot; were released as singles in 2001 and 2002. Critical response to the album was mixed, with reasonably positive reviews from some magazines (&quot;NME&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;LA Weekly&quot;), while others (including &quot;Q&quot; magazine, &quot;PopMatters&quot; and &quot;Pitchfork&quot;) derided it as sounding underproduced, dull and lacking in luster.

In March 2001, Depeche Mode held a press conference at the Valentino Hotel in Hamburg to announce the Exciter Tour. The tour featured 84 performances for over 1.5 million fans in 24 countries. The concerts held in Paris at the Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy were filmed and later released in May 2002 as a live DVD entitled &quot;One Night in Paris&quot;.

In October 2002 the band won the first-ever &quot;Q&quot; magazine &quot;Innovation Award&quot;.

In 2003, Gahan released his first solo album, &quot;Paper Monsters&quot;, and toured to promote the record. Also released in 2003 was Gore&#x27;s second solo album &quot;Counterfeit²&quot;. Fletcher founded his own record label, Toast Hawaii, specialising in promoting electronic music.

A new remix compilation album, &quot;Remixes 81–04&quot;, was released in 2004, featuring new and unreleased promo mixes of the band&#x27;s singles from 1981 to 2004. A new version of &quot;Enjoy the Silence&quot;, remixed by Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park, &quot;Enjoy the Silence 04&quot;, was released as a single and reached No. 7 on the UK charts.

===&quot;Playing the Angel&quot; (2005–2007)===

In October 2005, the band released their 11th studio album &quot;Playing the Angel&quot;. Produced by Ben Hillier, the album peaked at No. 1 in 18 countries and featured the hit single &quot;Precious&quot;. This is the first Depeche Mode album to feature lyrics written by Gahan and, consequently, the first album since 1984&#x27;s &quot;Some Great Reward&quot; featuring songs not written by Gore. &quot;Suffer Well&quot; was the first ever post-Clarke Depeche Mode single not to be written by Gore (lyrics by Gahan, music by Philpott/Eigner). The final single from the album was &quot;John the Revelator&quot;, an up-tempo electronic track with a running religious theme, accompanied by &quot;Lilian&quot;, a lush track that was a hit in many clubs all over the world.

To promote &quot;Playing the Angel&quot;, the band launched Touring the Angel, a concert tour of Europe and North America that began in November 2005 and ran for nine months. During the last two legs of the tour Depeche Mode headlined a number of festivals including the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and the O2 Wireless Festival. In total, the band played to more than 2.8 million people across 31 countries and the tour was one of the highest grossing and critically acclaimed tours of 2005/2006. Speaking about the tour, Gahan praised it as &quot;probably the most enjoyable, rewarding live shows we&#x27;ve ever done. The new material was just waiting to be played live. It took on a life of its own. With the energy of the crowds, it just came to life.&quot; Two shows at Milan&#x27;s Fila Forum were filmed and edited into a concert film, released on DVD as &quot;Touring the Angel: Live in Milan&quot;.

A &quot;best-of&quot; compilation was released in November 2006, entitled &quot;The Best of Depeche Mode Volume 1&quot; featuring a new single &quot;Martyr&quot;, an outtake from the &quot;Playing the Angel&quot; sessions. Later that month Depeche Mode received the MTV Europe Music Award in the Best Group category.

In December 2006, iTunes released &quot;The Complete Depeche Mode&quot; as its fourth ever digital box-set.

In August 2007, during promotion for Gahan&#x27;s second solo album, &quot;Hourglass&quot;, it was announced that Depeche Mode were heading back in studio in early 2008 to work on a new album.

===&quot;Sounds of the Universe&quot; (2008–2011)===
In May 2008, the band returned to the studio with producer Ben Hillier to work on some songs that Martin Gore had demoed at his home studio in Santa Barbara, California. Later that year it was announced that Depeche Mode were splitting from their long-term US label, Warner Music, and signing with EMI Music worldwide. The album was created in four sessions, two in New York and two in Santa Barbara. A total of 22 songs were recorded, with the standard album being 13 songs in length while many of the others were released in subsequent deluxe editions.

In 2009, Depeche Mode allowed their likeness to be used in Valve&#x27;s &quot;Left 4 Dead 2&quot;.
On 15 January 2009, the official Depeche Mode website announced that the band&#x27;s twelfth studio album would be called &quot;Sounds of the Universe&quot;. The album was released on 14 April 2009, also made available through an iTunes Pass, where the buyer received individual tracks in the weeks leading up to the official release date. Fletcher said the idea for their iTunes Pass was a combination of the band&#x27;s and iTunes&#x27;: &quot;I think the digital and record companies are starting to get their act together. They were very lazy in the first 10 years when downloads came in. Now they&#x27;re collaborating more and coming up with interesting ideas for fans to buy products.&quot; The album went to number one in 21 countries. Critical response was generally positive and it was nominated for a Grammy in the Best Alternative Album category. &quot;Wrong&quot; was the first single from the album, released digitally in February 2009. Subsequent singles were &quot;Peace&quot; and the double A-side &quot;Fragile Tension / Hole to Feed&quot;. In addition, &quot;Perfect&quot; was released as a promotional-only (non-commercial) single in the United States.

On 23 April 2009, Depeche Mode performed for the television program &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; at the famed corner of Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Street, drawing more than 12,000 fans, which was the largest audience the program had seen since its 2003 premiere, with a performance by Coldplay.

In May 2009, the band embarked on a concert tour in support of the album, called Tour of the Universe; it had been announced at a press conference in October 2008 at the Olympiastadion in Berlin. There was a warm up show in Luxembourg and it officially started on 10 May 2009 in Tel Aviv. The first leg of the tour was disrupted when Dave Gahan was struck down with gastroenteritis. During treatment, doctors found and removed a low-grade tumour from the singer&#x27;s bladder. Gahan&#x27;s illness caused 16 concerts to be cancelled, but several of the shows were rescheduled for 2010. The band headlined the Lollapalooza festival during the North American leg of the tour. The tour also took the band back to South America for the first time since 1994&#x27;s Exotic Tour. During the final European leg, the band played a show at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall in aid of the Teenage Cancer Trust, where former member Alan Wilder joined Martin Gore on stage for a performance of &quot;Somebody&quot;. In total the band played to more than 2.7 million people across 32 countries and the tour was one of the most profitable in America in 2009. The concerts held at Palau Sant Jordi, Barcelona, Spain were filmed and later released on DVD and Blu-ray release entitled &quot;Tour of the Universe: Barcelona 20/21.11.09&quot;. In March 2010, Depeche Mode won the award for &quot;Best International Group – Rock / Pop&quot; at the Echo Awards in Germany.

On 6 June 2011, as the final commitment to their contract with EMI, the band released a remix compilation album, entitled &quot;Remixes 2: 81–11&quot; that features remixes by former members Vince Clarke and Alan Wilder. Other remixers involved with the project were Nick Rhodes of Duran Duran, Röyksopp, Karlsson &amp; Winnberg of Miike Snow, Eric Prydz, Clark and more. A new remix of &quot;Personal Jesus&quot; by Stargate, entitled &quot;Personal Jesus 2011&quot;, was released as a single on 30 May 2011, in support of the compilation.

Depeche Mode contributed their cover of the U2 song &quot;So Cruel&quot; to the tribute album &quot;AHK-toong BAY-bi Covered&quot; honouring the 20th anniversary of &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;, a 1991 album by U2. The compilation CD was released with the December 2011 issue of &quot;Q&quot;.

===&quot;Delta Machine&quot; (2012–2014)===
In October 2012 during a press conference in Paris, Dave Gahan, Martin Gore and Andy Fletcher announced plans for a new album and a 2013 worldwide tour starting from Tel Aviv and continuing in Europe and North America. Martin Gore revealed that Flood mixed the album, marking the producer&#x27;s first studio collaboration with the band since 1993&#x27;s &quot;Songs of Faith and Devotion&quot;.

In December 2012, the band officially announced signing a worldwide deal with Columbia Records and releasing a new album in March 2013. On 24 January 2013, it was confirmed that the album was titled &quot;Delta Machine&quot;. &quot;Heaven&quot;, the debut single from &quot;Delta Machine&quot; was released commercially on Friday 1 February 2013 (although not in the UK). The release date in the UK was pushed back to 18 March 2013 (17 March 2013 on iTunes). The physical release still bore the Mute Records logo, even though the band have now severed ties with their long-standing label. Fletcher mentioned in an interview this was due to their &quot;devotion&quot; to the label and with the band&#x27;s insistence.&quot;Delta Machine&quot; spawned two further singles, &quot;Soothe My Soul&quot; on 6 May and &quot;Should Be Higher&quot; on 11 October. Though neither performed well in the UK charts they did perform moderately in other European charts.

In March, the band announced North American dates to their Delta Machine Tour, starting 22 August from Detroit and ending 8 October in Phoenix. In June, other European dates were confirmed for early 2014. The final gig of the tour took place in Moscow, Russia on 7 March 2014, at Olimpiski venue.

That month, Depeche Mode won the award for &quot;Best International Group – Rock / Pop&quot; at the Echo Awards in Germany. Also, they were nominated at the category &quot;Album des Jahres (national oder international)&quot; for &quot;Delta Machine&quot; but lost against Helene Fischer&#x27;s &quot;Farbenspiel&quot;.

On 8 October 2014, the band announced &quot;Live in Berlin&quot;, the new video and audio release filmed and recorded at the O2 World in Berlin, Germany in November 2013 during the Delta Machine Tour. It was released on 17 November 2014 worldwide.

===&quot;Spirit&quot; (2015–2021)===

In a 2015 Rolling Stone interview celebrating the 25th anniversary of &quot;Violator&quot;, Gore stated that Johnny Cash&#x27;s cover of &quot;Personal Jesus&quot; is his favorite cover version of a Depeche Mode song.

On 25 January 2016, Gore announced a projected return to the recording studio in April, with both Gore and Gahan having already written and demoed new songs. In September, the official Depeche Mode Facebook page hinted at a new release, later confirmed by the band to be a music video compilation, &quot;Video Singles Collection&quot;, scheduled for release in November by Sony. In October 2016, the band announced that their fourteenth album titled &quot;Spirit.&quot; It was produced by James Ford, and was released on 17 March 2017.

&quot;Where&#x27;s the Revolution&quot;, the lead single from &quot;Spirit&quot;, was released 3 February 2017, along with its lyric video. The official video was published a week later, on 9 February. The Global Spirit Tour officially kicked off on 5 May 2017 with a performance in Stockholm, Sweden, at the Friends Arena. The first leg of the tour covered European countries only, ending with a final stadium show in Cluj-Napoca, Romania, at the Cluj Arena. The second leg of the tour covered North America and returned to Europe. The North America leg of the tour kicked off in Salt Lake City, Utah, on 23 August, at the USANA Amphitheatre. Depeche Mode broke a record when the band became the first to play four nights at the Hollywood Bowl. The band remained in North America until 15 November when they left for Dublin to resume the European leg. The band ended the tour in Europe with two sold-out shows on 23 and 25 July 2018 in Berlin, Germany, at the Waldbühne.

In September 2019, the band announced that &quot;Spirits in the Forest&quot;, a documentary that was partially filmed during these shows by long-time collaborator Anton Corbijn, would be released in theatres for one night only, 21 November 2019. It was released on CD, DVD and Blu-ray under the title &quot;LiVE SPiRiTS&quot; on 26 June 2020.

On 7 November 2020, the band were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

=== Fletcher&#x27;s death and &quot;Memento Mori&quot; (2022–present)===

On 26 May 2022, Andy Fletcher died, aged 60, after suffering an aortic dissection while at home. His bandmates Gahan and Gore stated, &quot;we are shocked and filled with overwhelming sadness with the untimely passing of our dear friend, family member and bandmate Andy &#x27;Fletch&#x27; Fletcher.&quot; Former Depeche Mode member Alan Wilder stated that learning of Fletcher&#x27;s death was &quot;a real bolt from the blue.&quot;

Prior to Fletcher&#x27;s death, Gahan said: &quot;There&#x27;s a ton of stuff that we&#x27;ve done with Depeche Mode that I&#x27;m really proud of. I think that&#x27;s come with time and age. Martin put out a record last year which I really liked. I actually bought a copy because it wouldn&#x27;t feel right otherwise. I know he&#x27;s been pottering away in his studio as well, so I guess at some point next year we&#x27;ll get together. Hopefully at least to just have a chat about what we both feel like we could move forward with.&quot;
On 15 August 2022, the social media accounts for Depeche Mode posted a photo of Gahan and Gore in a recording studio, with them tweeting, &quot;finding stability in what we know and love, and focusing on what gives life meaning and purpose&quot;, which magazines like &quot;NME&quot; suggested was a hint at work on a new studio album.

On 4 October 2022, Depeche Mode announced their fifteenth studio album &quot;Memento Mori&quot; and a tour to support the album which started on 23 March 2023.

The first single, &quot;Ghosts Again&quot;, released on 9 February 2023, was co-written by Richard Butler of the Psychedelic Furs. It received relative success in the UK, charting at No. 14. &quot;Ghosts Again&quot; had widespread success in the US, charting in the top 10 of 3 &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. Reaching number 2 on the Adult Alternative Songs chart, Gahan said it &quot;captures this perfect balance of melancholy and joy&quot;, while Gore said it has &quot;such an upbeat feel to it&quot; and how rare it is for the band to record a song that &quot;I just don&#x27;t get sick of listening to.&quot;

The band stated that work on the album began during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Gahan and Gore said they would send each other ideas for songs, for example Gahan said, &quot;I played guitar and sort of sang on my iPhone&quot;, while Gore &quot;sent it back with his angelic voice.&quot; They also stated that they would be working with James Ford once again as producer along with Marta Salogni mixing for the album.

==Musical style and influences==
Gore recalled, &quot;My dream was to combine the emotion of Neil Young or John Lennon transmitted by Kraftwerk&#x27;s synthesisers. Soul music played by electronic instruments.&quot; Gore also cited synth-pop group Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD), who provided support on the Music for the Masses Tour; Clarke stated that Depeche Mode would never have happened without OMD. Fletcher mentioned influences including the late 1970s punk rock scene, the post-punk bands Siouxsie and the Banshees and the Cure, and electronic group the Human League. Band members have also cited David Bowie, the Clash, Roxy Music and Brian Eno, Elvis Presley, the Velvet Underground, Fad Gadget, Suicide, and the blues.

Depeche Mode were considered a teen pop group during their early period in the UK, and interviewed in teen pop magazines such as &quot;Smash Hits&quot;. Following the departure of Clarke, their music began to take on a darker tone, establishing a darker sound in the band&#x27;s music, as Gore assumed lead songwriting duties. Gore&#x27;s lyrics include themes such as sex, religion, and politics. Gore has stated he feels lyrical themes which tackle issues related to solitude and loneliness are a better representation of reality, whereas he finds &quot;happy songs&quot; fake and unrealistic. At the same time, he asserts that the group&#x27;s music contains &quot;an element of hope&quot;.

Depeche Mode&#x27;s music has been variously described as synth-pop, electronic rock, new wave, dark wave, dance-rock, post-punk, alternative rock, and pop rock. The band have also experimented with other genres throughout their career, including avant-garde, electronica, pop, soul, techno, industrial rock and heavy metal.

==Legacy==
Depeche Mode have released a total of 15 studio albums, 10 compilation albums, six live albums, eight box sets, 13 video albums, 71 music videos, and 54 singles. They have sold over 100 million records and played live to more than 35 million fans worldwide. The band has had 50 songs in the UK Singles Chart, and one US and two UK number-one albums. In addition, all of their studio albums have reached the UK Top 10 and their albums have spent over 210 weeks on the UK Charts. Along with the Red Hot Chili Peppers and U2, Depeche Mode are one of three acts that have charted at least once on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Alternative Airplay chart in every decade since its debut in 1988.

In 2006, music critic Sasha Frere-Jones stated that &quot;the last serious English influence was Depeche Mode, who seem more and more significant as time passes.&quot; Depeche Mode&#x27;s releases have been nominated for five Grammy Awards: &quot;Devotional&quot; for Best Long Form Music Video; &quot;I Feel Loved&quot; and &quot;Suffer Well&quot;, both for Best Dance Recording; &quot;Sounds of the Universe&quot; for Best Alternative Album; and &quot;Wrong&quot; for Best Short Form Music Video. In addition, Depeche Mode have been honoured with a Brit Award for &quot;Enjoy the Silence&quot; in the Best British Single category, the first-ever &quot;Q&quot; Innovation Award, and an Ivor Novello Award for Martin Gore in the category of International Achievement.

Depeche Mode were called &quot;the most popular electronic band the world has ever known&quot; by &quot;Q&quot;, &quot;one of the greatest British pop groups of all time&quot; by &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot;, and &quot;the quintessential eighties techno-pop band&quot; by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and AllMusic. They were ranked No. 2 on Electronic Music Realm&#x27;s list of The 100 Greatest Artists of Electronic Music, and &quot;Q&quot; included them on their list of &quot;50 bands that changed the world&quot;.

Other musicians have stated their admiration for Depeche Mode. In an interview in 2009, Simple Minds lead singer Jim Kerr argued that Depeche Mode and U2 were the only contemporaries of his band which could be said to have &quot;stayed constantly relevant&quot;. Muse&#x27;s Matt Bellamy said, &quot;They had their own thing, their own style, own sound. I respect them very much.&quot; During Depeche Mode&#x27;s induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Coldplay&#x27;s Chris Martin remarked, &quot;sonically, they were and are about throwing away all the rulebooks.&quot; Arcade Fire&#x27;s Win Butler added, &quot;I feel like their music still sounds like it could come out 20 years from now. Depeche were able to take that spirit and spread it, which is really kind of a sacred responsibility.&quot;

On December 13, 2023, Los Angeles city council member Monica Rodriguez, officially declared December 13th as &quot;Depeche Mode Day&quot; in the city of Los Angeles. Dave Gahan and Martin Gore were present as they were honored in a public ceremony held at Los Angeles City Hall.

===Influence===
Many major artists have cited the band as an influence, including: Arcade Fire, The Killers, Nine Inch Nails, Chvrches, The Smashing Pumpkins, Coldplay, Muse, Metric, No Doubt, A Perfect Circle, Marilyn Manson, Linkin Park, The Crystal Method, Fear Factory, La Roux, Gotye, Amanda Palmer, Rammstein, a-ha, Tegan and Sara (on &quot;Sainthood&quot;) and Paul van Dyk. Depeche Mode contemporaries Pet Shop Boys, Tears for Fears and Gary Numan have also cited the band as an influence. Colombian singer Shakira described &quot;Enjoy the Silence&quot; as the song that first sparked her passion for pop music.

The dark themes and moods of Depeche Mode&#x27;s lyrics and music have been enjoyed by several heavy metal artists, and the band influenced acts such as Marilyn Manson and Deftones. Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails also cited Depeche Mode, in particular their 1986 album &quot;Black Celebration&quot;, as a major influence on his beginnings. They have also been named as an influence on Detroit techno and indie rock.

==Philanthropy==
Early in their career, Depeche Mode was dismissive of benefit concerts such as Live Aid. Gore himself stated, &quot;If these bands really care so much, they should just donate the money and let that be it. Why can&#x27;t they do it without all the surrounding hype?&quot;.

Since 2010, the band has applied their celebrity and cultural longevity to help promote and raise funds for several notable charity endeavours. They lent their support to high-profile charities such as MusiCares, Cancer Research UK and the Teenage Cancer Trust. The band has also supported the Small Steps Project, a humanitarian organization based in the UK, aiming to assist economically disadvantaged children into education. They have partnered with Swiss watchmaker Hublot to support , aimed at the provision of clean drinking water in developing countries. Such collaboration led to the release of two different limited edition watches, the Hublot Big Bang Depeche Mode in 2017 and The Singles Limited Edition series based from the Big Bang model in 2018. The proceeds helped raise $1.7 million for Charity: Water. In 2014, the partnership hosted a gala and fundraiser at the TsUM building in Moscow, raising $1.4 million for the charity.

<text>[[Differential (mathematics)|Differential]] cryptanalysis is a general form of cryptanalysis applicable primarily to block ciphers, but also to stream ciphers and cryptographic hash functions. In the broadest sense, it is the study of how differences in information input can affect the resultant difference at the output. In the case of a block cipher, it refers to a set of techniques for tracing differences through the network of transformation, discovering where the cipher exhibits non-random behavior, and exploiting such properties to recover the secret key (cryptography key).

==History==
The discovery of differential cryptanalysis is generally attributed to Eli Biham and Adi Shamir in the late 1980s, who published a number of attacks against various block ciphers and hash functions, including a theoretical weakness in the Data Encryption Standard (DES). It was noted by Biham and Shamir that DES was surprisingly resistant to differential cryptanalysis, but small modifications to the algorithm would make it much more susceptible.

In 1994, a member of the original IBM DES team, Don Coppersmith, published a paper stating that differential cryptanalysis was known to IBM as early as 1974, and that defending against differential cryptanalysis had been a design goal. According to author Steven Levy, IBM had discovered differential cryptanalysis on its own, and the NSA was apparently well aware of the technique. IBM kept some secrets, as Coppersmith explains: &quot;After discussions with NSA, it was decided that disclosure of the design considerations would reveal the technique of differential cryptanalysis, a powerful technique that could be used against many ciphers. This in turn would weaken the competitive advantage the United States enjoyed over other countries in the field of cryptography.&quot; Within IBM, differential cryptanalysis was known as the &quot;T-attack&quot; or &quot;Tickle attack&quot;.

While DES was designed with resistance to differential cryptanalysis in mind, other contemporary ciphers proved to be vulnerable. An early target for the attack was the FEAL block cipher. The original proposed version with four rounds (FEAL-4) can be broken using only eight chosen plaintexts, and even a 31-round version of FEAL is susceptible to the attack. In contrast, the scheme can successfully cryptanalyze DES with an effort on the order of 247 chosen plaintexts.

==Attack mechanics==

Differential cryptanalysis is usually a chosen plaintext attack, meaning that the attacker must be able to obtain ciphertexts for some set of plaintexts of their choosing. There are, however, extensions that would allow a known plaintext or even a ciphertext-only attack. The basic method uses pairs of plaintexts related by a constant &quot;difference&quot;. Difference can be defined in several ways, but the eXclusive OR (XOR) operation is usual. The attacker then computes the differences of the corresponding ciphertexts, hoping to detect statistical patterns in their distribution. The resulting pair of differences is called a differential. Their statistical properties depend upon the nature of the S-boxes used for encryption, so the attacker analyses differentials formula_1 where
formula_2
(and ⊕ denotes exclusive or) for each such S-box &quot;S&quot;. In the basic attack, one particular ciphertext difference is expected to be especially frequent. In this way, the cipher can be distinguished from random. More sophisticated variations allow the key to be recovered faster than an exhaustive search.

In the most basic form of key recovery through differential cryptanalysis, an attacker requests the ciphertexts for a large number of plaintext pairs, then assumes that the differential holds for at least &quot;r&quot; − 1 rounds, where &quot;r&quot; is the total number of rounds. The attacker then deduces which round keys (for the final round) are possible, assuming the difference between the blocks before the final round is fixed. When round keys are short, this can be achieved by simply exhaustively decrypting the ciphertext pairs one round with each possible round key. When one round key has been deemed a potential round key considerably more often than any other key, it is assumed to be the correct round key.

For any particular cipher, the input difference must be carefully selected for the attack to be successful. An analysis of the algorithm&#x27;s internals is undertaken; the standard method is to trace a path of highly probable differences through the various stages of encryption, termed a &quot;differential characteristic&quot;.

Since differential cryptanalysis became public knowledge, it has become a basic concern of cipher designers. New designs are expected to be accompanied by evidence that the algorithm is resistant to this attack and many including the Advanced Encryption Standard, have been proven secure against the attack.

==Attack in detail==

The attack relies primarily on the fact that a given input/output difference pattern only occurs for certain values of inputs. Usually the attack is applied in essence to the non-linear components as if they were a solid component (usually they are in fact look-up tables or &quot;S-boxes&quot;). Observing the desired output difference (between two chosen or known plaintext inputs) &quot;suggests&quot; possible key values.

For example, if a differential of 1 =&gt; 1 (implying a difference in the least significant bit (LSB) of the input leads to an output difference in the LSB) occurs with probability of 4/256 (possible with the non-linear function in the AES cipher for instance) then for only 4 values (or 2 pairs) of inputs is that differential possible. Suppose we have a non-linear function where the key is XOR&#x27;ed before evaluation and the values that allow the differential are {2,3} and {4,5}. If the attacker sends in the values of {6, 7} and observes the correct output difference it means the key is either 6 ⊕ K = 2, or 6 ⊕ K = 4, meaning the key K is either 2 or 4.

In essence, to protect a cipher from the attack, for an n-bit non-linear function one would ideally seek as close to 2−(&quot;n&quot; − 1) as possible to achieve &quot;differential uniformity&quot;. When this happens, the differential attack requires as much work to determine the key as simply brute forcing the key.

The AES non-linear function has a maximum differential probability of 4/256 (most entries however are either 0 or 2). Meaning that in theory one could determine the key with half as much work as brute force, however, the high branch of AES prevents any high probability trails from existing over multiple rounds. In fact, the AES cipher would be just as immune to differential and linear attacks with a much &quot;weaker&quot; non-linear function. The incredibly high branch (active S-box count) of 25 over 4R means that over 8 rounds, no attack involves fewer than 50 non-linear transforms, meaning that the probability of success does not exceed Pr[attack] ≤ Pr[best attack on S-box]50. For example, with the current S-box AES emits no fixed differential with a probability higher than (4/256)50 or 2−300 which is far lower than the required threshold of 2−128 for a 128-bit block cipher. This would have allowed room for a more efficient S-box, even if it is 16-uniform the probability of attack would have still been 2−200.

There exist no bijections for even sized inputs/outputs with 2-uniformity. They exist in odd fields (such as GF(27)) using either cubing or inversion (there are other exponents that can be used as well). For instance, S(x) = x3 in any odd binary field is immune to differential and linear cryptanalysis. This is in part why the MISTY designs use 7- and 9-bit functions in the 16-bit non-linear function. What these functions gain in immunity to differential and linear attacks, they lose to algebraic attacks. That is, they are possible to describe and solve via a SAT solver. This is in part why AES (for instance) has an affine mapping after the inversion.

<doc id="8537" wikidata="Q212327" url="?curid=8537" title="Document type definition">
<text>A document type definition (DTD) is a specification file that contains set of &quot;markup declarations&quot; that define a &quot;document type&quot; for an SGML-family markup language (GML, SGML, XML, HTML). The DTD specification file can be used to validate documents. 

A DTD defines the valid building blocks of an XML document. It defines the document structure with a list of validated elements and attributes. A DTD can be declared inline inside an XML document, or as an external reference.

A namespace-aware version of DTDs is being developed as Part 9 of ISO DSDL. DTDs persist in applications that need special publishing characters, such as the XML and HTML Character Entity References, which derive from larger sets defined as part of the ISO SGML standard effort. XML uses a subset of SGML DTD.

, newer XML namespace-aware schema languages (such as W3C XML Schema and ISO RELAX NG) have largely superseded DTDs as a better way to validate XML structure.

== Associating DTDs with documents ==
A DTD is associated with an XML or SGML document by means of a document type declaration (DOCTYPE). The DOCTYPE appears in the syntactic fragment &quot;doctypedecl&quot; near the start of an XML document. The declaration establishes that the document is an instance of the type defined by the referenced DTD.

DOCTYPEs make two sorts of declarations:
* an optional &quot;external subset&quot;
* an optional &quot;internal subset&quot;.

The declarations in the internal subset form part of the DOCTYPE in the document itself. The declarations in the external subset are located in a separate text file. The external subset may be referenced via a &quot;public identifier&quot; and/or a &quot;system identifier&quot;. Programs for reading documents may not be required to read the external subset.

Any valid SGML or XML document that references an &quot;external subset&quot; in its DTD, or whose body contains references to &quot;parsed external entities&quot; declared in its DTD (including those declared within its &quot;internal subset&quot;), may only be partially parsed but cannot be fully validated by &quot;validating&quot; SGML or XML parsers in their &quot;standalone&quot; mode (this means that these validating parsers do not attempt to retrieve these external entities, and their replacement text is not accessible).

However, such documents are still fully parsable in the &quot;non&quot;-standalone mode of validating parsers, which signals an error if it can not locate these external entities with their specified &quot;public identifier&quot; (FPI) or &quot;system identifier&quot; (a URI), or are inaccessible. (Notations declared in the DTD are also referencing external entities, but these unparsed entities are not needed for the validation of documents in the &quot;standalone&quot; mode of these parsers: the validation of all external entities referenced by notations is left to the application using the SGML or XML parser). Non-validating parsers &quot;may&quot; eventually attempt to locate these external entities in the &quot;non&quot;-standalone mode (by partially interpreting the DTD only to resolve their declared parsable entities), but do not validate the content model of these documents.

=== Examples ===
The following example of a DOCTYPE contains both public and system identifiers:
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN&quot;
&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd&quot;&gt;
All HTML 4.01 documents conform to one of three SGML DTDs. The public identifiers of these DTDs are constant and are as follows:
* codice_1
* codice_2
* codice_3

The system identifiers of these DTDs, if present in the DOCTYPE, are URI references. A system identifier usually points to a specific set of declarations in a resolvable location. SGML allows mapping public identifiers to system identifiers in catalogs that are optionally available to the URI resolvers used by document parsing software.

This DOCTYPE can only appear &quot;after&quot; the optional XML declaration, and before the document body, if the document syntax conforms to XML. This includes XHTML documents:
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN&quot;
&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;!-- the XHTML document body starts here--&gt;
&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
An additional internal subset can also be provided after the external subset:
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN&quot;
&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd&quot; [
 &lt;!-- an internal subset can be embedded here --&gt;
&lt;!-- the XHTML document body starts here--&gt;
&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
Alternatively, only the internal subset may be provided:
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html [
 &lt;!-- an internal subset can be embedded here --&gt;
&lt;!-- the XHTML document body starts here--&gt;
&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
Finally, the document type definition may include no subset at all; in that case, it just specifies that the document has a single top-level element (this is an implicit requirement for all valid XML and HTML documents, but not for document fragments or for all SGML documents, whose top-level elements may be different from the implied root element), and it indicates the type name of the root element:

&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;!-- the XHTML document body starts here--&gt;
&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
== Markup declarations ==
DTDs describe the structure of a class of documents via element and attribute-list declarations. Element declarations name the allowable set of elements within the document, and specify whether and how declared elements and runs of character data may be contained within each element. Attribute-list declarations name the allowable set of attributes for each declared element, including the type of each attribute value, if not an explicit set of valid values.

DTD markup declarations declare which element types, attribute lists, entities, and notations are allowed in the structure of the corresponding class of XML documents.

=== Element type declarations ===
An element type declaration defines an element and its possible content. A valid XML document contains only elements that are defined in the DTD.

Various keywords and characters specify an element&#x27;s content:
* EMPTY for specifying that the defined element allows no content, i.e., it cannot have any children elements, not even text elements (if there are whitespaces, they are ignored);
* ANY for specifying that the defined element allows any content, without restriction, i.e., that it may have any number (including none) and type of children elements (including text elements);
* or an expression, specifying the only elements allowed as direct children in the content of the defined element; this content can be either:
** a mixed content, which means that the content may include at least one text element and zero or more named elements, but their order and number of occurrences cannot be restricted; this can be:
*** ( #PCDATA ): historically meaning &quot;parsed character data&quot;, this means that only one text element is allowed in the content (no quantifier is allowed);
*** ( #PCDATA | &quot;element name&quot; | ... )*: a limited choice (in an exclusive list between parentheses and separated by &quot;|&quot; pipe characters and terminated by the required &quot;*&quot; quantifier) of two or more child elements (including only text elements or the specified named elements) may be used in any order and number of occurrences in the content.
** an element content, which means that there must be no text elements in the children elements of the content (all whitespaces encoded between child elements are then ignored, just like comments). Such element content is specified as &quot;content particle&quot; in a variant of Backus–Naur form without terminal symbols and element names as non-terminal symbols. Element content consists of:
*** a content particle can be either the name of an element declared in the DTD, or a &quot;sequence list&quot; or &quot;choice list&quot;. It may be followed by an optional &quot;quantifier&quot;.
**** a sequence list means an ordered list (specified between parentheses and separated by a &quot;,&quot; comma character) of one or more &quot;content particles&quot;: all the &quot;content particles&quot; must appear successively as direct children in the content of the defined element, at the specified position and relative order;
**** a choice list means a mutually exclusive list (specified between parentheses and separated by a &quot;|&quot; pipe character) of two or more &quot;content particles&quot;: only one of these &quot;content particles&quot; may appear in the content of the defined element at the same position.
*** A quantifier is a single character that immediately follows the specified item it applies to, to restrict the number of successive occurrences of these items at the specified position in the content of the element; it may be either:
**** + for specifying that there must be one or more occurrences of the item — the effective content of each occurrence may be different;
**** * for specifying that any number (zero or more) of occurrences is allowed — the item is optional and the effective content of each occurrence may be different;
**** ? for specifying that there must not be more than one occurrence — the item is optional;
**** If there is no quantifier, the specified item must occur exactly one time at the specified position in the content of the element.

For example:

&lt;!ELEMENT html (head, body)&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT p (#PCDATA | p | ul | dl | table | h1|h2|h3)*&gt;
Element type declarations are ignored by &quot;non-validating&quot; SGML and XML parsers (in which cases, any elements are accepted in any order, and in any number of occurrences in the parsed document), but these declarations are still checked for form and validity.

=== Attribute list declarations ===
An attribute list specifies for a given element type the list of all possible attribute associated with that type. For each possible attribute, it contains:
* the declared name of the attribute,
* its data type (or an enumeration of its possible values),
* and its default value.

For example:

&lt;!ATTLIST img
 src CDATA #REQUIRED
 id ID #IMPLIED
 sort CDATA #FIXED &quot;true&quot;
 print (yes | no) &quot;yes&quot;


Here are some attribute types supported by both SGML and XML:
; codice_4: this type means &quot;characters data&quot; and indicates that the effective value of the attribute can be any textual value, unless the attribute is specified as fixed (the comments in the DTD may further document values that are effectively accepted, but the DTD syntax does not allow such precise specification);
; codice_5: the effective value of the attribute must be a valid identifier, and it is used to define and anchor to the current element the target of references using this defined identifier (including as document fragment identifiers that may be specified at end of an URI after a &quot;#&quot; sign); it is an error if distinct elements in the same document are defining the same identifier; the uniqueness constraint also implies that the identifier itself carries no other semantics and that identifiers must be treated as opaque in applications; XML also predefines the standard pseudo-attribute &quot;codice_6&quot; with this type, without needing any declaration in the DTD, so the uniqueness constraint also applies to these defined identifiers when they are specified anywhere in a XML document.
; codice_7 or codice_8: the effective value of the attribute can only be a valid identifier (or a space-separated list of such identifiers) and must be referencing the unique element defined in the document with an attribute declared with the type codice_5 in the DTD (or the unique element defined in an XML document with a pseudo-attribute &quot;codice_6&quot;) and whose effective value is the same identifier;
; codice_11 or codice_12: the effective value of the attribute can only be a valid name token (or a spaced-separated list of such name tokens), but it is not restricted to a unique identifier within the document; this name may carry supplementary and application-dependent semantics and may require additional naming constraints, but this is out of scope of the DTD;
; codice_13 or codice_14: the effective value of the attribute can only be the name of an unparsed external entity (or a space-separated list of such names), which must also be declared in the document type declaration; this type is not supported in HTML parsers, but is valid in SGML and XML 1.0 or 1.1 (including XHTML and SVG);
; codice_15: the effective value of the attribute can only be one of the enumerated list (specified between parentheses and separated by a &quot;codice_16&quot; pipe character) of textual values, where each value in the enumeration is possibly specified between codice_17singlecodice_17 or codice_19doublecodice_19 quotation marks if it&#x27;s not a simple name token;
; codice_21: the effective value of the attribute can only be any one of the enumerated list (specified between parentheses and separated by a &quot;codice_16&quot; pipe character) of notation names, where each notation name in the enumeration must also be declared in the document type declaration; this type is not supported in HTML parsers, but is valid in SGML and XML 1.0 or 1.1 (including XHTML and SVG).

A default value can define whether an attribute must occur (codice_23) or not (codice_24), or whether it has a fixed value (codice_25), or which value should be used as a default value (&quot;…&quot;) in case the given attribute is left out in an XML tag.

Attribute list declarations are ignored by &quot;non-validating&quot; SGML and XML parsers (in which cases any attribute is accepted within all elements of the parsed document), but these declarations are still checked for well-formedness and validity.

=== Entity declarations ===
An entity is similar to a macro. The entity declaration assigns it a value that is retained throughout the document. A common use is to have a name more recognizable than a numeric character reference for an unfamiliar character. Entities help to improve legibility of an XML text. In general, there are two types: internal and external.
* Internal (parsed) entities are associating a name with any arbitrary textual content defined in their declaration (which may be in the &quot;internal subset&quot; or in the &quot;external subset&quot; of the DTD declared in the document). When a named entity reference is then encountered in the rest of the document (including in the rest of the DTD), and if this entity name has effectively been defined as a parsed entity, the reference itself is replaced immediately by the textual content defined in the parsed entity, and the parsing continues within this replacement text.
** Predefined named character entities are similar to internal entities: 5 of them however are treated specially in all SGML, HTML and XML parsers. These entities are a bit different from normal parsed entities, because when a named character entity reference is encountered in the document, the reference is also replaced immediately by the character content defined in the entity, but the parsing continues after the replacement text, which is immediately inserted literally in the currently parsed token (if such character is permitted in the textual value of that token). This allows some characters that are needed for the core syntax of HTML or XML themselves to be escaped from their special syntactic role (notably &quot;&amp;&quot; which is reserved for beginning entity references, &quot;&lt;&quot; or &quot;&gt;&quot; which delimit the markup tags, and &quot;double&quot; or &#x27;single&#x27; quotation marks, which delimit the values of attributes and entity definitions). Predefined character entities also include numeric character references that are handled the same way and can also be used to escape the characters they represent, or to bypass limitations in the character repertoire supported by the document encoding.
** In basic profiles for SGML or in HTML documents, the declaration of internal entities is not possible (because external DTD subsets are not retrieved, and internal DTD subsets are not supported in these basic profiles).
** Instead, HTML standards predefine a large set of several hundred named character entities, which can still be handled as standard parsed entities defined in the DTD used by the parser.
* External entities refer to external storage objects. They are just declared by a unique name in the document, and defined with a public identifier (an FPI) and/or a system identifier (interpreted as an URI) specifying where the source of their content. They exist in fact in two variants:
** parsed external entities (most often defined with a SYSTEM identifier indicating the URI of their content) that are &quot;not&quot; associated in their definition to a named annotation, in which case validating XML or SGML parsers retrieve their contents and parse them as if they were declared as internal entities (the external entity containing their effective replacement text);
** unparsed external entities that are defined and associated with an annotation name, in which case they are treated as opaque references and signaled as such to the application using the SGML or XML parser: their interpretation, retrieval and parsing is left to the application, according to the types of annotations it supports (see the next section about annotations and for examples of unparsed external entities).
** External entities are not supported in basic profiles for SGML or in HTML documents, but are valid in full implementations of SGML and in XML 1.0 or 1.1 (including XHTML and SVG, even if they are not strictly needed in those document types).

An example of internal entity declarations (here in an internal DTD subset of an SGML document) is:

&lt;!DOCTYPE sgml [
 &lt;!ELEMENT sgml ANY&gt;
 &lt;!ENTITY % std &quot;standard SGML&quot;&gt;
 &lt;!ENTITY % signature &quot; &amp;#x2014; &amp;author;.&quot;&gt;
 &lt;!ENTITY % question &quot;Why couldn&amp;#x2019;t I publish my books directly in %std;?&quot;&gt;
 &lt;!ENTITY % author &quot;William Shakespeare&quot;&gt;


&lt;sgml&gt;&amp;question;&amp;signature;&lt;/sgml&gt;
Internal entities may be defined in any order, as long as they are not referenced and parsed in the DTD or in the body of the document, in their order of parsing: it is valid to include a reference to a still undefined entity within the content of a parsed entity, but it is invalid to include anywhere else any named entity reference before this entity has been fully defined, including all other internal entities referenced in its defined content (this also prevents circular or recursive definitions of internal entities). This document is parsed as if it was:

&lt;!DOCTYPE sgml [
 &lt;!ELEMENT sgml ANY&gt;
 &lt;!ENTITY % std &quot;standard SGML&quot;&gt;
 &lt;!ENTITY % signature &quot; — &amp;author;.&quot;&gt;
 &lt;!ENTITY % question &quot;Why couldn’t I publish my books directly in standard SGML?&quot;&gt;
 &lt;!ENTITY % author &quot;William Shakespeare&quot;&gt;


&lt;sgml&gt;Why couldn’t I publish my books directly in standard SGML? — William Shakespeare.&lt;/sgml&gt;
Reference to the &quot;author&quot; internal entity is not substituted in the replacement text of the &quot;signature&quot; internal entity. Instead, it is replaced only when the &quot;signature&quot; entity reference is parsed within the content of the &quot;sgml&quot; element, but only by validating parsers (non-validating parsers do not substitute entity references occurring within contents of element or within attribute values, in the body of the document.

This is possible because the replacement text specified in the internal entity definitions permits a distinction between parameter entity references (that are introduced by the &quot;%&quot; character and whose replacement applies to the parsed DTD contents) and general entity references (that are introduced by the &quot;&amp;&quot; character and whose replacement is delayed until they are effectively parsed and validated). The &quot;%&quot; character for introducing parameter entity references in the DTD loses its special role outside the DTD and it becomes a literal character.

However, the references to predefined character entities are substituted wherever they occur, without needing a validating parser (they are only introduced by the &quot;&amp;&quot; character).

=== Notation declarations ===
Notations are used in SGML or XML. They provide a complete reference to unparsed external entities whose interpretation is left to the application (which interprets them directly or retrieves the external entity themselves), by assigning them a simple name, which is usable in the body of the document. For example, notations may be used to reference non-XML data in an XML 1.1 document. For example, to annotate SVG images to associate them with a specific renderer:

&lt;!NOTATION type-image-svg SYSTEM &quot;image/svg&quot;&gt;
This declares the TEXT of external images with this type, and associates it with a notation name &quot;type-image-svg&quot;. However, notation names usually follow a naming convention that is specific to the application generating or using the notation: notations are interpreted as additional meta-data whose effective content is an external entity and either a PUBLIC FPI, registered in the catalogs used by XML or SGML parsers, or a SYSTEM URI, whose interpretation is application dependent (here a MIME type, interpreted as a relative URI, but it could be an absolute URI to a specific renderer, or a URN indicating an OS-specific object identifier such as a UUID).

The declared notation name must be unique within all the document type declaration, i.e. in the external subset as well as the internal subset, at least for conformance with XML.

Notations can be associated to unparsed external entities included in the body of the SGML or XML document. The PUBLIC or SYSTEM parameter of these external entities specifies the FPI and/or the URI where the unparsed data of the external entity is located, and the additional NDATA parameter of these defined entities specifies the additional notation (i.e., effectively the MIME type here). For example:

&lt;!DOCTYPE sgml [
 &lt;!ELEMENT sgml (img)*&gt;

 &lt;!ELEMENT img EMPTY&gt;
 &lt;!ATTLIST img
 data ENTITY #IMPLIED&gt;

 &lt;!ENTITY example1SVG SYSTEM &quot;example1.svg&quot; NDATA example1SVG-rdf&gt;
 &lt;!NOTATION example1SVG-rdf SYSTEM &quot;example1.svg.rdf&quot;&gt;


&lt;sgml&gt;
 &lt;img data=&quot;example1SVG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/sgml&gt;
Within the body of the SGML document, these referenced external entities (whose name is specified between &quot;&amp;&quot; and &quot;;&quot;) are &quot;not&quot; replaced like usual named entities (defined with a CDATA value), but are left as distinct unparsed tokens that may be used either as the value of an element attribute (like above) or within the element contents, provided that either the DTD allows such external entities in the declared content type of elements or in the declared type of attributes (here the ENTITY type for the data attribute), or the SGML parser is not validating the content.

Notations may also be associated directly to elements as additional meta-data, without associating them to another external entity, by giving their names as possible values of some additional attributes (also declared in the DTD within the &lt;!ATTLIST ...&gt; declaration of the element). For example:

&lt;!DOCTYPE sgml [
 &lt;!ELEMENT sgml (img)*&gt;
 the optional &quot;type&quot; attribute value can only be set to this notation.
 &lt;!ATTLIST sgml
 type NOTATION (
 type-vendor-specific ) #IMPLIED&gt;

 &lt;!ELEMENT img ANY&gt; &lt;!-- optional content can be only parsable SGML or XML data --&gt;
 The optional &quot;title&quot; attribute value must be parsable as text.
 The optional &quot;data&quot; attribute value is set to an unparsed external entity.
 The optional &quot;type&quot; attribute value can only be one of the two notations.
 &lt;!ATTLIST img
 title CDATA #IMPLIED
 data ENTITY #IMPLIED
 type NOTATION (
 type-image-svg |
 type-image-gif ) #IMPLIED&gt;
 Notations are referencing external entities and may be set in the &quot;type&quot; attributes above,
 or must be referenced by any defined external entities that cannot be parsed.
 &lt;!NOTATION type-image-svg PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN&quot;
 &quot;http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd&quot;&gt;
 &lt;!NOTATION type-image-gif PUBLIC &quot;image/gif&quot;&gt;
 &lt;!NOTATION type-vendor-specific PUBLIC &quot;application/VND.specific+sgml&quot;&gt;

 &lt;!ENTITY example1SVGTitle &quot;Title of example1.svg&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- parsed internal entity --&gt;
 &lt;!ENTITY example1SVG SYSTEM &quot;example1.svg&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- parsed external entity --&gt;
 &lt;!ENTITY example1GIFTitle &quot;Title of example1.gif&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- parsed internal entity --&gt;
 &lt;!ENTITY example1GIF SYSTEM &quot;example1.gif&quot; NDATA type-image-gif&gt; &lt;!-- unparsed external entity --&gt;


&lt;sgml type=&quot;type-vendor-specific&quot;&gt;
 &lt;!-- an SVG image is parsable as valid SGML or XML text --&gt;
 &lt;img title=&quot;&amp;example1SVGTitle;&quot; type=&quot;type-image-svg&quot;&gt;&amp;example1SVG;&lt;/img&gt;

 &lt;!-- it can also be referenced as an unparsed external entity --&gt;
 &lt;img title=&quot;&amp;example1SVGTitle;&quot; data=&quot;example1SVG&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;!-- a GIF image is not parsable and can only be referenced as an external entity --&gt;
 &lt;img title=&quot;&amp;example1GIFTitle;&quot; data=&quot;example1GIF&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/sgml&gt;
The example above shows a notation named &quot;type-image-svg&quot; that references the standard public FPI and the system identifier (the standard URI) of an SVG 1.1 document, instead of specifying just a system identifier as in the first example (which was a relative URI interpreted locally as a MIME type). This annotation is referenced directly within the unparsed &quot;type&quot; attribute of the &quot;img&quot; element, but its content is not retrieved. It also declares another notation for a vendor-specific application, to annotate the &quot;sgml&quot; root element in the document. In both cases, the declared notation named is used directly in a declared &quot;type&quot; attribute, whose content is specified in the DTD with the &quot;NOTATION&quot; attribute type (this &quot;type&quot; attribute is declared for the &quot;sgml&quot; element, as well as for the &quot;img&quot; element).

However, the &quot;title&quot; attribute of the &quot;img&quot; element specifies the internal entity &quot;example1SVGTitle&quot; whose declaration that does not define an annotation, so it is parsed by validating parsers and the entity replacement text is &quot;Title of example1.svg&quot;.

The content of the &quot;img&quot; element references another external entity &quot;example1SVG&quot; whose declaration also does not define a notation, so it is also parsed by validating parsers and the entity replacement text is located by its defined SYSTEM identifier &quot;example1.svg&quot; (also interpreted as a relative URI). The effective content for the &quot;img&quot; element be the content of this second external resource. The difference with the GIF image, is that the SVG image is parsed within the SGML document, according to the declarations in the DTD, where the GIF image is just referenced as an opaque external object (which is not parsable with SGML) via its &quot;data&quot; attribute (whose value type is an opaque ENTITY).

Only one notation name may be specified in the value of ENTITY attributes (there is no support in SGML, XML 1.0 or XML 1.1 for multiple notation names in the same declared external ENTITY, so separate attributes are needed). However multiple external entities may be referenced (in a space-separated list of names) in attributes declared with type ENTITIES, and where each named external entity is also declared with its own notation).

Notations are also completely opaque for XML and SGML parsers, so they are not differentiated by the type of the external entity that they may reference (for these parsers they just have a unique name associated to a public identifier (an FPI) and/or a system identifier (a URI)).

Some applications (but not XML or SGML parsers themselves) also allow referencing notations indirectly by naming them in the &quot;URN:&quot;name&quot;&quot; value of a standard CDATA attribute, everywhere a URI can be specified. However this behaviour is application-specific, and requires that the application maintains a catalog of known URNs to resolve them into the notations that have been parsed in a standard SGML or XML parser. This use allows notations to be defined only in a DTD stored as an external entity and referenced only as the external subset of documents, and allows these documents to remain compatible with validating XML or SGML parsers that have no direct support for notations.

Notations are not used in HTML, or in basic profiles for XHTML and SVG, because:
* All external entities used by these standard document types are referenced by simple attributes, declared with the CDATA type in their standard DTD (such as the &quot;href&quot; attribute of an anchor &quot;a&quot; element, or the &quot;src&quot; attribute of an image &quot;img&quot; element, whose values are interpreted as a URI, without needing any catalog of public identifiers, i.e., known FPI)
* All external entities for additional meta-data are referenced by either:
** Additional attributes (such as &quot;type&quot;, which indicates the MIME type of the external entity, or the &quot;charset&quot; attribute, which indicates its encoding)
** Additional elements (such as &quot;link&quot; or &quot;meta&quot; in HTML and XHTML) within their own attributes
** Standard pseudo-attributes in XML and XHTML (such as &quot;xml:lang&quot;, or &quot;xmlns&quot; and &quot;xmlns:*&quot; for namespace declarations).

Even in validating SGML or XML 1.0 or XML 1.1 parsers, the external entities referenced by an FPI and/or URI in declared notations are not retrieved automatically by the parsers themselves. Instead, these parsers just provide to the application the parsed FPI and/or URI associated to the notations found in the parsed SGML or XML document, and with a facility for a dictionary containing all notation names declared in the DTD; these validating parsers also check the uniqueness of notation name declarations, and report a validation error if some notation names are used anywhere in the DTD or in the document body but not declared:
* If the application can not use any notation (or if their FPI and/or URI are unknown or not supported in their local catalog), these notations may be either ignored silently by the application or the application could signal an error.
* Otherwise, the applications decide themselves how to interpret them, then if the external entities must be retrieved and then parsed separately.
* Applications may then signal an error, if such interpretation, retrieval or separate parsing fails.
* Unrecognized notations that may cause an application to signal an error should not block interpretation of the validated document using them.

== XML DTDs and schema validation ==
The XML DTD syntax is one of several XML schema languages. However, many of the schema languages do not fully replace the XML DTD. Notably, the XML DTD allows defining entities and notations that have no direct equivalents in DTD-less XML (because internal entities and parsable external entities are not part of XML schema languages, and because other unparsed external entities and notations have no simple equivalent mappings in most XML schema languages).

Most XML schema languages are only replacements for element declarations and attribute list declarations, in such a way that it becomes possible to parse XML documents with &quot;non-validating&quot; XML parsers (if the only purpose of the external DTD subset was to define the schema). In addition, documents for these XML schema languages must be parsed separately, so validating the schema of XML documents in pure standalone mode is not really possible with these languages: the document type declaration remains necessary for at least identifying (with a XML Catalog) the schema used in the parsed XML document and that is validated in another language.

A common misconception holds that a &quot;non-validating&quot; XML parser does not have to read document type declarations, when in fact, the document type declarations must still be scanned for correct syntax as well as validity of declarations, and the parser must still parse all entity declarations in the &quot;internal subset&quot;, and substitute the replacement texts of internal entities occurring anywhere in the document type declaration or in the document body.

A &quot;non-validating&quot; parser may, however, elect not to read parsable &quot;external entities&quot; (including the &quot;external subset&quot;), and does not have to honor the content model restrictions defined in element declarations and in attribute list declarations.

If the XML document depends on parsable external entities (including the specified &quot;external subset&quot;, or parsable external entities declared in the &quot;internal subset&quot;), it should assert codice_26 in its XML declaration. The validating DTD may be identified by using XML Catalogs to retrieve its specified &quot;external subset&quot;.

In the example below, the XML document is declared with codice_26 because it has an external subset in its document type declaration:

&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot; standalone=&quot;no&quot;?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE people_list SYSTEM &quot;example.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;people_list /&gt;
If the XML document type declaration includes any SYSTEM identifier for the external subset, it can not be safely processed as standalone: the URI should be retrieved, otherwise there may be unknown named character entities whose definition may be needed to correctly parse the effective XML syntax in the internal subset or in the document body (the XML syntax parsing is normally performed &quot;after&quot; the substitution of all named entities, excluding the five entities that are predefined in XML and that are implicitly substituted &quot;after&quot; parsing the XML document into lexical tokens). If it just includes any PUBLIC identifier, it &quot;may&quot; be processed as standalone, if the XML processor knows this PUBLIC identifier in its local catalog from where it can retrieve an associated DTD entity.

== XML DTD schema example ==
An example of a very simple external XML DTD to describe the schema of a list of persons might consist of:

&lt;!ELEMENT people_list (person)*&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT person (name, birthdate?, gender?, socialsecuritynumber?)&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT name (#PCDATA)&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT birthdate (#PCDATA)&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT gender (#PCDATA)&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT socialsecuritynumber (#PCDATA)&gt;
Taking this line by line:
# codice_28 is a valid element name, and an instance of such an element contains any number of codice_29 elements. The codice_30 denotes there can be 0 or more codice_29 elements within the codice_28 element.
# codice_29 is a valid element name, and an instance of such an element contains one element named codice_34, followed by one named codice_35 (optional), then codice_36 (also optional) and codice_37 (also optional). The codice_38 indicates that an element is optional. The reference to the codice_34 element name has no codice_38, so a codice_29 element &quot;must&quot; contain a codice_34 element.
# codice_34 is a valid element name, and an instance of such an element contains &quot;parsed character data&quot; (#PCDATA).
# codice_35 is a valid element name, and an instance of such an element contains parsed character data.
# codice_36 is a valid element name, and an instance of such an element contains parsed character data.
# codice_37 is a valid element name, and an instance of such an element contains parsed character data.

An example of an XML file that uses and conforms to this DTD follows. The DTD is referenced here as an external subset, via the SYSTEM specifier and a URI. It assumes that we can identify the DTD with the relative URI reference &quot;example.dtd&quot;; the &quot;people_list&quot; after &quot;!DOCTYPE&quot; tells us that the root tags, or the first element defined in the DTD, is called &quot;people_list&quot;:

&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot; standalone=&quot;no&quot;?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE people_list SYSTEM &quot;example.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;people_list&gt;
 &lt;person&gt;
 &lt;name&gt;Fred Bloggs&lt;/name&gt;
 &lt;birthdate&gt;2008-11-27&lt;/birthdate&gt;
 &lt;gender&gt;Male&lt;/gender&gt;
 &lt;/person&gt;
&lt;/people_list&gt;
One can render this in an XML-enabled browser (such as Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox) by pasting and saving the DTD component above to a text file named &quot;example.dtd&quot; and the XML file to a differently-named text file, and opening the XML file with the browser. The files should both be saved in the same directory. However, many browsers do not check that an XML document confirms to the rules in the DTD; they are only required to check that the DTD is syntactically correct. For security reasons, they may also choose not to read the external DTD.

The same DTD can also be embedded directly in the XML document itself as an internal subset, by encasing it within [square brackets] in the document type declaration, in which case the document no longer depends on external entities and can be processed in standalone mode:

&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot; standalone=&quot;yes&quot;?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE people_list [
 &lt;!ELEMENT people_list (person*)&gt;
 &lt;!ELEMENT person (name, birthdate?, gender?, socialsecuritynumber?)&gt;
 &lt;!ELEMENT name (#PCDATA)&gt;
 &lt;!ELEMENT birthdate (#PCDATA)&gt;
 &lt;!ELEMENT gender (#PCDATA)&gt;
 &lt;!ELEMENT socialsecuritynumber (#PCDATA)&gt;
&lt;people_list&gt;
 &lt;person&gt;
 &lt;name&gt;Fred Bloggs&lt;/name&gt;
 &lt;birthdate&gt;2008-11-27&lt;/birthdate&gt;
 &lt;gender&gt;Male&lt;/gender&gt;
 &lt;/person&gt;
&lt;/people_list&gt;
== Alternatives ==
Alternatives to DTDs (for specifying schemas) are available:
* XML Schema, also referred to as XML Schema Definition (XSD), has achieved Recommendation status within the W3C, and is popular for &quot;data oriented&quot; (that is, transactional non-publishing) XML use because of its stronger typing and easier round-tripping to Java declarations. Most of the publishing world has found that the added complexity of XSD would not bring them any particular benefits, so DTDs are still far more popular there. An XML Schema Definition is itself an XML document while a DTD is not.
* RELAX NG, which is also a part of DSDL, is an ISO international standard. It is more expressive than XSD, while providing a simpler syntax, but commercial software support has been slow in coming.

== Security ==
An XML DTD can be used to create a denial of service (DoS) attack by defining nested entities that expand exponentially, or by sending the XML parser to an external resource that never returns.

For this reason, .NET Framework provides a property that allows prohibiting or skipping DTD parsing, and recent versions of Microsoft Office applications (Microsoft Office 2010 and higher) refuse to open XML files that contain DTD declarations.

<text>A devil is the personification of evil as it is conceived in various cultures and religious traditions. It is seen as the objectification of a hostile and destructive force. Jeffrey Burton Russell states that the different conceptions of the devil can be summed up as 1) a principle of evil independent from God, 2) an aspect of God, 3) a created being turning evil (a &quot;fallen angel&quot;) or 4) a symbol of human evil.

Each tradition, culture, and religion with a devil in its mythos offers a different lens on manifestations of evil. The history of these perspectives intertwines with theology, mythology, psychiatry, art, and literature, developing independently within each of the traditions. It occurs historically in many contexts and cultures, and is given many different names—Satan (Judaism), Lucifer (Christianity), Beelzebub (Judeo-Christian), Mephistopheles (German), Iblis (Islam)—and attributes: it is portrayed as blue, black, or red; it is portrayed as having horns on its head, and without horns, and so on.

== Etymology ==
The Modern English word &quot;devil&quot; derives from the Middle English &quot;&quot;, from the Old English &quot;&quot;, that in turn represents an early Germanic borrowing of the Latin &quot;diabolus&quot;. This in turn was borrowed from the Greek &quot;diábolos&quot;, &quot;slanderer&quot;, from &quot;diabállein&quot;, &quot;to slander&quot; from &quot;diá&quot;, &quot;across, through&quot; and βάλλειν &quot;bállein&quot;, &quot;to hurl&quot;, probably akin to the Sanskrit &quot;gurate&quot;, &quot;he lifts up&quot;.

== Definitions ==
In his book &quot;The Devil: Perceptions of Evil from Antiquity to Primitive Christianity&quot;, Jeffrey Burton Russell discusses various meanings and difficulties that are encountered when using the term &quot;devil&quot;. He does not claim to define the word in a general sense, but he describes the limited use that he intends for the word in his book—limited in order to &quot;minimize this difficulty&quot; and &quot;for the sake of clarity&quot;. In this book Russell uses the word &quot;devil&quot; as &quot;the personification of evil found in a variety of cultures&quot;, as opposed to the word &quot;Satan&quot;, which he reserves specifically for the figure in the Abrahamic religions.

In the Introduction to his book &quot;Satan: A Biography&quot;, Henry Ansgar Kelly discusses various considerations and meanings that he has encountered in using terms such as &quot;devil&quot; and &quot;Satan&quot;, etc. While not offering a general definition, he describes that in his book &quot;whenever &quot;diabolos&quot; is used as the proper name of Satan&quot;, he signals it by using &quot;small caps&quot;.

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; has a variety of definitions for the meaning of &quot;devil&quot;, supported by a range of citations: &quot;Devil&quot; may refer to Satan, the supreme spirit of evil, or one of Satan&#x27;s emissaries or demons that populate Hell, or to one of the spirits that possess a demoniac person; &quot;devil&quot; may refer to one of the &quot;malignant deities&quot; feared and worshiped by &quot;heathen people&quot;, a demon, a malignant being of superhuman powers; figuratively &quot;devil&quot; may be applied to a wicked person, or playfully to a rogue or rascal, or in empathy often accompanied by the word &quot;poor&quot; to a person—&quot;poor devil&quot;.

== Baháʼí Faith ==
In the Baháʼí Faith, a malevolent, superhuman entity such as a &quot;devil&quot; or &quot;satan&quot; is not believed to exist. However, these terms do appear in the Baháʼí writings, where they are used as metaphors for the lower nature of man. Human beings are seen to have free will, and are thus able to turn towards God and develop spiritual qualities or turn away from God and become immersed in their self-centered desires. Individuals who follow the temptations of the self and do not develop spiritual virtues are often described in the Baháʼí writings with the word &quot;satanic&quot;. The Baháʼí writings also state that the devil is a metaphor for the &quot;insistent self&quot; or &quot;lower self&quot;, which is a self-serving inclination within each individual. Those who follow their lower nature are also described as followers of &quot;the Evil One&quot;.

== Christianity ==

In Christianity, the devil or Satan is a fallen angel who is the primary opponent of God. Some Christians also considered the Roman and Greek deities to be devils.

Christianity describes Satan as a fallen angel who terrorizes the world through evil, is opposed to truth, and shall be condemned, together with the fallen angels who follow him, to eternal fire at the Last Judgment.

=== Christian Bible ===

==== Old Testament ====
The Devil is identified with several figures in the Bible including the serpent in the Garden of Eden, Lucifer, Satan, the tempter of the Gospels, Leviathan, and the dragon in the Book of Revelation. Some parts of the Bible, which do not refer to an evil spirit or Satan at the time of the composition of the texts, are interpreted as references to the Devil in Christian tradition. Genesis 3 mentions the serpent in the Garden of Eden, which tempts Adam and Eve into eating the forbidden fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thus causing their expulsion from the Garden. The Babylonian myth of a rising star, as the embodiment of a heavenly being who is thrown down for his attempt to ascend into the higher planes of the gods, is also found in the Bible and interpreted as a fallen angel (Isaiah 14:12–15). 

Ezekiel&#x27;s cherub in Eden is thought to be a description of the major characteristic of the Devil, that he was created good, as a high ranking angel and lived in Eden, later turning evil on his own accord:

The Hebrew term () was originally a common noun meaning &quot;accuser&quot; or &quot;adversary&quot; and derived from a verb meaning primarily &quot;to obstruct, oppose&quot;. Satan is conceptualized as a heavenly being hostile to humans and a personification of evil 18 times in Job 1–2 and Zechariah 3. In the Book of Job, Job is a righteous man favored by God. Job 1:6–8 describes the &quot;sons of God&quot; () presenting themselves before God. Satan thinks Job only loves God because he has been blessed, so he requests that God tests the sincerity of Job&#x27;s love for God through suffering, expecting Job to abandon his faith. God consents; Satan destroys Job&#x27;s family, health, servants and flocks, yet Job refuses to condemn God. 

==== New Testament ====
The Devil figures much more prominently in the New Testament and in Christian theology than in the Old Testament. The Devil is a unique entity throughout the New Testament, neither identical to the demons nor the fallen angels, the tempter and perhaps rules over the kingdoms of earth. In the temptation of Christ (Matthew 4:8–9 and Luke 4:6–7), the devil offers all kingdoms of the earth to Jesus, implying they belong to him. Since Jesus does not dispute this offer, it may indicate that the authors of those gospels believed this to be true. This event is described in all three synoptic gospels, (Matthew 4:1–11, Mark 1:12–13 and Luke 4:1–13). Some Church Fathers, such as Irenaeus, reject that the Devil holds such power, arguing that, since the devil was a liar since the beginning, he also lied here and that all kingdoms belong to God, referring to Proverbs 21.

Adversaries of Jesus are suggested to be under the influence of the Devil. speaks about the Pharisees as the &quot;offspring of the devil&quot;. John 13:2 states that the devil entered Judas Iscariot before Judas&#x27; betrayal (Luke 22:3). In all three synoptic gospels (Matthew 9:22–29, Mark 3:22–30 and Luke 11:14–20), Jesus himself is also accused of serving the Devil. Jesus&#x27; adversaries claim that he receives the power to cast out demons from Beelzebub, the Devil. In response, Jesus says that a house divided against itself will fall, and that there would be no reason for the devil to allow one to defeat the devil&#x27;s works with his own power.

According to the First Epistle of Peter, &quot;Like a roaring lion your adversary the devil prowls around, looking for someone to devour&quot; (1 Peter 5:8). The authors of the Second Epistle of Peter and the Epistle of Jude believe that God prepares judgment for the devil and his fellow fallen angels, who are bound in darkness until the Divine retribution. In the Epistle to the Romans, the inspirer of sin is also implied to be the author of death. The Epistle to the Hebrews speaks of the devil as the one who has the power of death but is defeated through the death of Jesus (Hebrews 2:14). In the Second Epistle to the Corinthians, Paul the Apostle warns that Satan is often disguised as an angel of light.

In the Book of Revelation, a a dragon/serpent &quot;called the devil, or Satan&quot; wages war against the archangel Michael resulting in the dragon&#x27;s fall. The devil is described with features similar to primordial chaos monsters, like the Leviathan in the Old Testament. The identification of this serpent as Satan supports identification of the serpent in Genesis with the devil.

=== Theology ===
In Christian Theology the Devil is the personification of evil, traditionally held to have rebelled against God in an attempt to become equal to God himself. He is said to be a fallen angel, who was expelled from Heaven at the beginning of time, before God created the material world, and is in constant opposition to God.

Many scholars explain the Devil&#x27;s fall from God&#x27;s grace in Neoplatonic fashion. According to Origen, God created rational creatures first then the material world. The rational creatures are divided into angels and humans, both endowed with free will, and the material world is a result of their evil choices. Therefore, the Devil is considered most remote from the presence of God, and those who adhere to the Devil&#x27;s will follow the Devil&#x27;s removal from God&#x27;s presence. Similar, Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite considers evil as a deficiency having no real ontological existence. Thus the Devil is conceptualized as the entity most remote from God. Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot; follows a similar portrayal of the Devil by placing him at the bottom of hell where he becomes the center of the material and sinful world to which all sinfulness is drawn.

From the beginning of the early modern period (around the 1400s), Christians started to imagine the Devil as an increasingly powerful entity, actively leading people into falsehood. For Martin Luther the Devil was not a deficit of good, but a real, personal and powerful entity, with a presumptuous will against God, his word and his creation. Luther lists several hosts of &quot;greater&quot; and &quot;lesser&quot; devils. Greater devils would incite to greater sins, like unbelief and heresy, while lesser devils to minor sins like greed and fornication. Among these devils also appears Asmodeus known from the Book of Tobit. These anthropomorphic devils are used as stylistic devices for his audience, although Luther regards them as different manifestations of one spirit (i.e. the Devil).

Others rejected that the Devil has any independent reality on his own. David Joris was the first of the Anabaptists to suggest the Devil was only an allegory (); this view found a small but persistent following in the Netherlands. The Devil as a fallen angel symbolized Adam&#x27;s fall from God&#x27;s grace and Satan represented a power within man. Rudolf Bultmann taught that Christians need to reject belief in a literal devil as part of formulating an authentic faith in today&#x27;s world.

== Gnostic religions ==
Gnostic and Gnostic-influenced religions postulate the idea that the material world is inherently evil. The &quot;One true God&quot; is remote, beyond the material universe; therefore, this universe must be governed by an inferior imposter deity. This deity was identified with the deity of the Old Testament by some sects, such as the Sethians and the Marcions. Tertullian accuses Marcion of Sinope, that he John Arendzen (1909) in the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; (1913) mentions that Eusebius accused Apelles, the 2nd-century AD Gnostic, of considering the Inspirer of Old Testament prophecies to be not a god, but an evil angel. These writings commonly refer to the Creator of the material world as &quot;a demiurgus&quot; to distinguish him from the &quot;One true God&quot;. Some texts, such as the Apocryphon of John and On the Origin of the World, not only demonized the Creator God but also called him by the name of the devil in some Jewish writings, &quot;Samael&quot;.

=== Catharism ===
In the 12th century in Europe the Cathars, who were rooted in Gnosticism, dealt with the problem of evil, and developed ideas of dualism and demonology. The Cathars were seen as a serious potential challenge to the Catholic church of the time. The Cathars split into two camps. The first is &quot;absolute&quot; dualism, which held that evil was completely separate from the good God, and that God and the devil each had power. The second camp is &quot;mitigated&quot; dualism, which considers Lucifer to be a son of God and a brother to Christ. To explain this, they used the parable of the prodigal son, with Christ as the good son, and Lucifer as the son that strayed into evilness. The Catholic Church responded to dualism in AD 1215 in the Fourth Lateran Council, saying that God created everything from nothing, and the devil was good when he was created, but he made himself bad by his own free will. In the &quot;Gospel of the Secret Supper&quot;, Lucifer, just as in prior Gnostic systems, appears as a demiurge, who created the material world.

== Islam ==

In Islam, the principle of evil is expressed by two terms referring to the same entity: &quot;Shaitan&quot; (meaning &quot;astray&quot;, &quot;distant&quot; or &quot;devil&quot;) and &quot;Iblis&quot;. Iblis is the proper name of the devil representing the characteristics of evil. Iblis is mentioned in the Quranic narrative about the creation of humanity. When God created Adam, he ordered the angels to prostrate themselves before him. Out of pride, Iblis refused and claimed to be superior to Adam. Therefore, pride but also envy became a sign of &quot;unbelief&quot; in Islam. Thereafter, Iblis was condemned to Hell, but God granted him a request to lead humanity astray, knowing the righteous would resist Iblis&#x27; attempts to misguide them. In Islam, both good and evil are ultimately created by God. But since God&#x27;s will is good, the evil in the world must be part of God&#x27;s plan. Actually, God allowed the devil to seduce humanity. Evil and suffering are regarded as a test or a chance to prove confidence in God. Some philosophers and mystics emphasized Iblis himself as a role model of confidence in God. Because God ordered the angels to prostrate themselves, Iblis was forced to choose between God&#x27;s command and God&#x27;s will (not to praise someone other than God). He successfully passed the test, yet his disobedience caused his punishment and therefore suffering. However, he stays patient and is rewarded in the end.

Muslims hold that the pre-Islamic jinn, tutelary deities, became subject under Islam to the judgment of God, and that those who did not submit to the law of God are devils.

Although Iblis is often compared to the devil in Christian theology, Islam rejects the idea that Satan is an opponent of God and the implied struggle between God and the devil. Iblis might either be regarded as &quot;the most monotheistic&quot; or &quot;the greatest sinner&quot;, but remains only a creature of God. Iblis did not become an unbeliever due to his disobedience, but because of attributing injustice to God; that is, by asserting that the command to prostrate himself before Adam was inappropriate. There is no reference to angelic revolt in the Quran and no mention of Iblis trying to take God&#x27;s throne, and Iblis&#x27;s sin could be forgiven at any time by God. According to the Quran, Iblis&#x27;s disobedience was due to his disdain for humanity, a narrative already occurring in early New Testament apocrypha. 

As in Christianity, Iblis was once a pious creature of God but later cast out of Heaven due to his pride. However, to maintain God&#x27;s absolute sovereignty, Islam matches the line taken by Irenaeus instead of the later Christian consensus that the devil did not rebel against God but against humanity. Further, although Iblis is generally regarded as a real bodily entity, he plays a less significant role as the personification of evil than in Christianity. Iblis is merely a tempter, notable for inciting humans into sin by &quot;whispering&quot; into humans minds (waswās), akin to the Jewish idea of the devil as &quot;yetzer hara&quot;.

On the other hand, &quot;Shaitan&quot; refers unilaterally to forces of evil, including the devil Iblis who causes mischief. Shaitan is also linked to humans&#x27; psychological nature, appearing in dreams, causing anger, or interrupting the mental preparation for prayer. Furthermore, the term &quot;Shaitan&quot; also refers to beings who follow the evil suggestions of Iblis. Also, the principle of &quot;shaitan&quot; is in many ways a symbol of spiritual impurity, representing humans&#x27; own deficits, in contrast to a &quot;true Muslim&quot;, who is free from anger, lust and other devilish desires.

In Muslim culture, devils are believed to be hermaphrodite creatures created from hell-fire, with one male and one female thigh, and able to procreate without a mate. It is generally believed that devils can harm the souls of humans through their whisperings. While whisperings tempt humans to sin, the devils might enter the hearth (&quot;qalb&quot;) of an individual. If the devils take over the soul of a person, this would render them aggressive or insane. In extreme cases, the alterings of the soul are believed to have effect on the body, matching its spiritual qualities.

=== In Sufism and mysticism ===

In contrast to Occidental philosophy, the Sufi idea of seeing &quot;Many as One&quot; and considering the creation in its essence as the Absolute, leads to the idea of the dissolution of any dualism between the ego substance and the &quot;external&quot; substantial objects. The rebellion against God, mentioned in the Quran, takes place on the level of the psyche that must be trained and disciplined for its union with the spirit that is pure. Since psyche drives the body, &quot;flesh&quot; is not the obstacle to humans but rather an unawareness that allows the impulsive forces to cause rebellion against God on the level of the psyche. Yet it is not a dualism between body, psyche and spirit, since the spirit embraces both psyche and corporeal aspects of humanity. Since the world is held to be the mirror in which God&#x27;s attributes are reflected, participation in worldly affairs is not necessarily seen as opposed to God. The devil activates the selfish desires of the psyche, leading the human astray from the Divine. Thus, it is the &quot;I&quot; that is regarded as evil, and both Iblis and &quot;Pharao&quot; are present as symbols for uttering &quot;I&quot; in ones own behavior. Therefore, it is recommended to use the term &quot;I&quot; as little as possible. It is only God who has the right to say &quot;I&quot;, since it is only God who is self-subsistent. Uttering &quot;I&quot; is therefore a way to compare oneself to God, regarded as &quot;shirk&quot;.

=== Islamist movements ===

Many Salafi strands emphasize a dualistic worldview between believers and unbelievers, The unbelievers are considered to be under the domain of the Devil and are the enemies of the faithful. The former are credited with tempting the latter to sin and away from God&#x27;s path. The Devil will ultimately be defeated by the power of God, but remains until then a serious threat for the believer. 

The notion of a substantial reality of evil (or a form of dualism between God and the Devil) has no precedence in the Quran or earlier Muslim traditions. Neither in the writings of ibn Sina, Ghazali, nor ibn Taimiyya, has evil any positive existence, but is described as the absence of good. Accordingly, infidelity among humans, civilizations, and empires are not described evil or devilish in Classical Islamic sources. This is in stark contrast to Islamists, such as Osama bin Laden, who justifies his violence against the infidels by contrary assertions. 

While in classical hadiths, devils (&quot;shayāṭīn&quot;) and jinn are responsible for ritual impurity, many Salafis substitute local demons by an omnipresent threat through the Devil himself. Only through remembrance of God and ritual purity, the devil can be kept away. As such, the Devil becomes an increasinly powerful entity who is believed to interfer with both personal and political life. For example, many Salafis blame the Devil for Western emancipation.

== Judaism ==

Yahweh, the god in pre-exilic Judaism, created both good and evil, as stated in Isaiah 45:7: &quot;I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the Lord do all these things.&quot; The devil does not exist in Jewish scriptures. However, the influence of Zoroastrianism during the Achaemenid Empire introduced evil as a separate principle into the Jewish belief system, which gradually externalized the opposition until the Hebrew term &quot;satan&quot; developed into a specific type of supernatural entity, changing the monistic view of Judaism into a dualistic one. Later, Rabbinic Judaism rejected the Enochian books (written during the Second Temple period under Persian influence), which depicted the devil as an independent force of evil besides God. After the apocalyptic period, references to Satan in the Tanakh are thought to be allegorical.

== Mandaeism ==
In Mandaean mythology, Ruha fell apart from the World of Light and became the queen of the World of Darkness, also referred to as Sheol. She is considered evil and a liar, sorcerer and seductress.She gives birth to Ur, also referred to as Leviathan. He is portrayed as a large, ferocious dragon or snake and is considered the king of the World of Darkness. Together they rule the underworld and create the seven planets and twelve zodiac constellations. Also found in the underworld is Krun, the greatest of the five Mandaean Lords of the underworld. He dwells in the lowest depths of creation and his epithet is the &#x27;mountain of flesh&#x27;. Prominent infernal beings found in the World of Darkness include &quot;lilith&quot;, &quot;nalai&quot; (vampire), &quot;niuli&quot; (hobgoblin), &quot;latabi&quot; (devil), &quot;gadalta&quot; (ghost), &quot;satani&quot; (Satan) and various other demons and evil spirits.

== Manichaeism ==

In Manichaeism, God and the devil are two unrelated principles. God created &quot;good&quot; and inhabits the realm of light, while the devil (also called the &quot;prince of darkness&quot;) created evil and inhabits the kingdom of darkness. The contemporary world came into existence, when the kingdom of darkness assaulted the kingdom of light and mingled with the spiritual world. At the end, the devil and his followers will be sealed forever and the kingdom of light and the kingdom of darkness will continue to co-exist eternally, never to commingle again.

Hegemonius (4th century CE) accuses that the Persian prophet Mani, founder of the Manichaean sect in the 3rd century CE, identified Jehovah as &quot;the devil god which created the world&quot; and said that &quot;he who spoke with Moses, the Jews, and the priests … is the [Prince] of Darkness, … not the god of truth.&quot;

== Tengrism ==
Among the Tengristic myths of central Asia, &quot;Erlik&quot; refers to a devil-like figure as the ruler of Tamag (Hell), who was also the first human. According to one narrative, Erlik and God swam together over the primordial waters. When God was about to create the Earth, he sent Erlik to dive into the waters and collect some mud. Erlik hid some inside his mouth to later create his own world. But when God commanded the Earth to expand, Erlik got troubled by the mud in his mouth. God aided Erlik to spit it out. The mud carried by Erlik gave place to the unpleasant areas of the world. Because of his sin, he was assigned to evil. In another variant, the creator-god is identified with Ulgen. Again, Erlik appears to be the first human. He desired to create a human just as Ulgen did, thereupon Ulgen reacted by punishing Erlik, casting him into the Underworld where he becomes its ruler.

According to Tengrism, there is no death, meaning that, when life comes to an end, it is merely a transition into the invisible world. As the ruler of Hell, Erlik enslaves the souls, who are damned to Hell. Further, he lurks on the souls of those humans living on Earth by causing death, disease and illnesses. At the time of birth, Erlik sends a Kormos to seize the soul of the newborn, following him for the rest of his life in an attempt to seize his soul by hampering, misguiding, and injuring him. When Erlik succeeds in destroying a human&#x27;s body, the Kormos sent by Erlik will try take him down into the Underworld. However a good soul will be brought to Paradise by a &quot;Yayutshi&quot; sent by Ulgen. Some shamans also made sacrifices to Erlik, for gaining a higher rank in the Underworld, if they should be damned to Hell.

== Yazidism ==
According to Yazidism there is no entity that represents evil in opposition to God; such dualism is rejected by Yazidis, and evil is regarded as nonexistent. Yazidis adhere to strict monism and are prohibited from uttering the word &quot;devil&quot; and from speaking of anything related to Hell.

== Zoroastrianism ==
Zoroastrianism probably introduced the first idea of the devil; a principle of evil independently existing apart from God. In Zoroastrianism, good and evil derive from two ultimately opposed forces. The force of good is called Ahura Mazda and the &quot;destructive spirit&quot; in the Avestan language is called Angra Mainyu. The Middle Persian equivalent is Ahriman. They are in eternal struggle and neither is all-powerful, especially Angra Mainyu is limited to space and time: in the end of time, he will be finally defeated. While Ahura Mazda creates what is good, Angra Mainyu is responsible for every evil and suffering in the world, such as toads and scorpions.
Iranian Zoroastrians also considered the Daeva as devil creature, because of this in the Shahnameh, it is mentioned as both Ahriman Div () as a devil.

== Devil in moral philosophy ==
=== Spinoza ===
A non-published manuscript of Spinoza&#x27;s &quot;Ethics&quot; contained a chapter (Chapter XXI) on the devil, where Spinoza examined whether the devil may exist or not. He defines the devil as an entity which is contrary to God. However, if the devil is the opposite of God, the devil would consist of Nothingness, which does not exist.

In a paper called &quot;On Devils&quot;, he writes that we can a priori find out that such a thing cannot exist. Because the duration of a thing results in its degree of perfection, and the more essence a thing possess the more lasting it is, and since the devil has no perfection at all, it is impossible for the devil to be an existing thing. Evil or immoral behaviour in humans, such as anger, hate, envy, and all things for which the devil is blamed for could be explained without the proposal of a devil. Thus, the devil does not have any explanatory power and should be dismissed (Occam&#x27;s razor). 

Regarding evil through free choice, Spinoza asks how it can be that Adam would have chosen sin over his own well-being. Theology traditionally responds to this by asserting it is the devil who tempts humans into sin, but who would have tempted the devil? According to Spinoza, a rational being, such as the devil must have been, could not choose his own damnation. The devil must have known his sin would lead to doom, thus the devil was not knowing, or the devil did not know his sin will lead to doom, thus the devil would not have been a rational being. Spinoza deducts a strict determinism in which moral agency as a free choice, cannot exist.

=== Kant ===
In &quot;Religion Within the Limits of Reason Alone&quot;, Immanuel Kant uses the devil as the personification of maximum moral reprehensibility. Deviating from the common Christian idea, Kant does not locate the morally reprehensible in sensual urges. Since evil has to be intelligible, only when the sensual is consciously placed above the moral obligation can something be regarded as morally evil. Thus, to be evil, the devil must be able to comprehend morality but consciously reject it, and, as a &quot;spiritual being&quot; (Geistwesen), having no relation to any form of sensual pleasure. It is necessarily required for the devil to be a spiritual being because if the devil were also a sensual being, it would be possible that the devil does evil to satisfy lower sensual desires, and does not act from the mind alone. The devil acts against morals, not to satisfy sensual lust, but solely for the sake of evil. As such, the devil is unselfish, for he does not benefit from his evil deeds. 

However, Kant denies that a human being could ever be completely devilish. Kant admits that there are devilish vices (ingratitude, envy, and malicious joy), i.e., vices that do not bring any personal advantage, but a person can never be completely a devil. In his &quot;Lecture on Moral Philosophy&quot; (1774/75) Kant gives an example of a tulip seller who was in possession of a rare tulip, but when he learned that another seller had the same tulip, he bought it from him and then destroyed it instead of keeping it for himself. If he had acted according to his sensual urges, the seller would have kept the tulip for himself to make a profit, but not have destroyed it. Nevertheless, the destruction of the tulip cannot be completely absolved from sensual impulses, since a sensual joy or relief still accompanies the destruction of the tulip and therefore cannot be thought of solely as a violation of morality.

Kant further argues that a (spiritual) devil would be a contradiction. If the devil would be defined by doing evil, the devil had no free choice in the first place. But if the devil had no free-choice, the devil could not have been held accountable for his actions, since he had no free will but was only following his nature.
