<text>The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), known informally as the Biodiversity Convention, is a multilateral treaty. The Convention has three main goals: the conservation of biological diversity (or biodiversity); the sustainable use of its components; and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from genetic resources. Its objective is to develop national strategies for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, and it is often seen as the key document regarding sustainable development.

The Convention was opened for signature at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro on 5 June 1992 and entered into force on 29 December 1993. The United States is the only UN member state which has not ratified the Convention. It has two supplementary agreements, the Cartagena Protocol and Nagoya Protocol.

The Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity is an international treaty governing the movements of living modified organisms (LMOs) resulting from modern biotechnology from one country to another. It was adopted on 29 January 2000 as a supplementary agreement to the CBD and entered into force on 11 September 2003.

The Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization (ABS) to the Convention on Biological Diversity is another supplementary agreement to the CBD. It provides a transparent legal framework for the effective implementation of one of the three objectives of the CBD: the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources. The Nagoya Protocol was adopted on 29 October 2010 in Nagoya, Japan, and entered into force on 12 October 2014.

2010 was also the International Year of Biodiversity, and the Secretariat of the CBD was its focal point. Following a recommendation of CBD signatories at Nagoya, the UN declared 2011 to 2020 as the United Nations Decade on Biodiversity in December 2010. The Convention&#x27;s &quot;Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011–2020&quot;, created in 2010, include the Aichi Biodiversity Targets.

The meetings of the Parties to the Convention are known as Conferences of the Parties (COP), with the first one (COP 1) held in Nassau, Bahamas, in 1994 and the most recent one (COP 16) in 2024 in Cali, Colombia.

In the area of marine and coastal biodiversity CBD&#x27;s focus at present is to identify Ecologically or Biologically Significant Marine Areas (EBSAs) in specific ocean locations based on scientific criteria. The aim is to create an international legally binding instrument (ILBI) involving area-based planning and decision-making under UNCLOS to support the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction (BBNJ treaty or High Seas Treaty).

==Origin and scope==

The notion of an international convention on biodiversity was conceived at a United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Ad Hoc Working Group of Experts on Biological Diversity in November 1988. The subsequent year, the Ad Hoc Working Group of Technical and Legal Experts was established for the drafting of a legal text which addressed the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, as well as the sharing of benefits arising from their utilization with sovereign states and local communities.
In 1991, an intergovernmental negotiating committee was established, tasked with finalizing the Convention&#x27;s text.

A Conference for the Adoption of the Agreed Text of the Convention on Biological Diversity was held in Nairobi, Kenya, in 1992, and its conclusions were distilled in the Nairobi Final Act. The Convention&#x27;s text was opened for signature on 5 June 1992 at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (the Rio &quot;Earth Summit&quot;). By its closing date, 4 June 1993, the Convention had received 168 signatures. It entered into force on 29 December 1993.

The Convention recognized for the first time in international law that the conservation of biodiversity is &quot;a common concern of humankind&quot; and is an integral part of the development process. The agreement covers all ecosystems, species, and genetic resources. It links traditional conservation efforts to the economic goal of using biological resources sustainably. It sets principles for the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the use of genetic resources, notably those destined for commercial use. It also covers the rapidly expanding field of biotechnology through its Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, addressing technology development and transfer, benefit-sharing and biosafety issues. Importantly, the Convention is legally binding; countries that join it (&#x27;Parties&#x27;) are obliged to implement its provisions.

The Convention reminds decision-makers of the finite status of natural resources and sets out a philosophy of sustainable use. While past conservation efforts were aimed at protecting particular species and habitats, the Convention recognizes that ecosystems, species and genes must be used for the benefit of humans. However, this should be done in a way and at a rate that does not lead to the long-term decline of biological diversity.

The Convention also offers decision-makers guidance based on the precautionary principle which demands that where there is a threat of significant reduction or loss of biological diversity, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to avoid or minimize such a threat. The Convention acknowledges that substantial investments are required to conserve biological diversity. It argues, however, that conservation will bring us significant environmental, economic and social benefits in return.

The Convention on Biological Diversity of 2010 banned some forms of geoengineering.

==Executive secretary==
As of April 2024, the acting executive secretary is Astrid Schomaker.

The previous executive secretaries were: David Cooper (2023–2024), Elizabeth Maruma Mrema (2020–2023), 
:pl:Cristiana Pașca Palmer (2017–2019), Braulio Ferreira de Souza Dias (2012–2017), Ahmed Djoghlaf (2006–2012), Hamdallah Zedan (1998–2005), Calestous Juma (1995–1998), and Angela Cropper (1993–1995).

==Issues==
Some of the many issues dealt with under the Convention include:
* Measures the incentives for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity.
* Regulated access to genetic resources and traditional knowledge, including Prior Informed Consent of the party providing resources.
* Sharing, in a fair and equitable way, the results of research and development and the benefits arising from the commercial and other utilization of genetic resources with the Contracting Party providing such resources (governments and/or local communities that provided the traditional knowledge or biodiversity resources utilized).
* Access to and transfer of technology, including biotechnology, to the governments and/or local communities that provided traditional knowledge and/or biodiversity resources.
* Technical and scientific cooperation.
* Coordination of a global directory of taxonomic expertise (Global Taxonomy Initiative).
* Impact assessment.
* Education and public awareness.
* Provision of financial resources.
* National reporting on efforts to implement treaty commitments.

==International bodies established==

===Conference of the Parties (COP)===
The Convention&#x27;s governing body is the Conference of the Parties (COP), consisting of all governments (and regional economic integration organizations) that have ratified the treaty. This ultimate authority reviews progress under the Convention, identifies new priorities, and sets work plans for members. The COP can also make amendments to the Convention, create expert advisory bodies, review progress reports by member nations, and collaborate with other international organizations and agreements.

The Conference of the Parties uses expertise and support from several other bodies that are established by the Convention. In addition to committees or mechanisms established on an ad hoc basis, the main organs are:

===CBD Secretariat===
The CBD Secretariat, based in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, operates under UNEP, the United Nations Environment Programme. Its main functions are to organize meetings, draft documents, assist member governments in the implementation of the programme of work, coordinate with other international organizations, and collect and disseminate information.

===Subsidiary Body for Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA)===
The SBSTTA is a committee composed of experts from member governments competent in relevant fields. It plays a key role in making recommendations to the COP on scientific and technical issues. It provides assessments of the status of biological diversity and of various measures taken in accordance with Convention, and also gives recommendations to the Conference of the Parties, which may be endorsed in whole, in part or in modified form by the COPs. SBSTTA had met 26 times, with a 26th meeting taking place in Nairobi, Kenya in 2024.

===Subsidiary Body on Implementation===
In 2014, the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity established the Subsidiary Body on Implementation (SBI) to replace the Ad Hoc Open-ended Working Group on Review of Implementation of the Convention. The four functions and core areas of work of SBI are: (a) review of progress in implementation; (b) strategic actions to enhance implementation; (c) strengthening means of implementation; and (d) operations of the Convention and the Protocols. The first meeting of the SBI was held on 2–6 May 2016 and the second meeting was held on 9–13 July 2018, both in Montreal, Canada. The latest (fifth) meeting of the SBI was held in October 2024 in Cali, Colombia. The Bureau of the Conference of the Parties serves as the Bureau of the SBI. The current chair of the SBI is Ms. Clarissa Souza Della Nina of Brazil.

==Parties==
As of 2016, the Convention has 196 Parties, which includes 195 states and the European Union. All UN member states—with the exception of the United States—have ratified the treaty. Non-UN member states that have ratified are the Cook Islands, Niue, and the State of Palestine. The Holy See and the states with limited recognition are non-Parties. The US has signed but not ratified the treaty, because ratification requires a two-thirds majority in the Senate and is blocked by Republican Party senators.

The European Union created the Cartagena Protocol (see below) in 2000 to enhance biosafety regulation and propagate the &quot;precautionary principle&quot; over the &quot;sound science principle&quot; defended by the United States. Whereas the impact of the Cartagena Protocol on domestic regulations has been substantial, its impact on international trade law remains uncertain. In 2006, the World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled that the European Union had violated international trade law between 1999 and 2003 by imposing a moratorium on the approval of genetically modified organisms (GMO) imports. Disappointing the United States, the panel nevertheless &quot;decided not to decide&quot; by not invalidating the stringent European biosafety regulations.

Implementation by the Parties to the Convention is achieved using two means:

===National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAP)===
National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAP) are the principal instruments for implementing the Convention at the national level. The Convention requires that countries prepare a national biodiversity strategy and to ensure that this strategy is included in planning for activities in all sectors where diversity may be impacted. As of early 2012, 173 Parties had developed NBSAPs.

The United Kingdom, New Zealand and Tanzania carried out elaborate responses to conserve individual species and specific habitats. The United States of America, a signatory who had not yet ratified the treaty by 2010, produced one of the most thorough implementation programs through species recovery programs and other mechanisms long in place in the US for species conservation.

Singapore established a detailed &quot;National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan&quot;. The &quot;National Biodiversity Centre&quot; of Singapore represents Singapore in the Convention for Biological Diversity.

===National Reports===
In accordance with Article 26 of the Convention, Parties prepare national reports on the status of implementation of the Convention.

==Protocols and plans developed by CBD==
===Cartagena Protocol (2000)===

The Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, also known as the Biosafety Protocol, was adopted in January 2000, after a CBD Open-ended Ad Hoc Working Group on Biosafety had met six times between July 1996 and February 1999. The Working Group submitted a draft text of the Protocol for consideration by Conference of the Parties at its first extraordinary meeting, which was convened for the express purpose of adopting a protocol on biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity. After a few delays, the Cartagena Protocol was eventually adopted on 29 January 2000. The Biosafety Protocol seeks to protect biological diversity from the potential risks posed by living modified organisms resulting from modern biotechnology.

The Biosafety Protocol makes clear that products from new technologies must be based on the precautionary principle and allow developing nations to balance public health against economic benefits. It will, for example, let countries ban imports of a genetically modified organism if they feel there is not enough scientific evidence the product is safe and requires exporters to label shipments containing genetically modified commodities such as corn or cotton.

The required number of 50 instruments of ratification/accession/approval/acceptance by countries was reached in May 2003. In accordance with the provisions of its Article 37, the Protocol entered into force on 11 September 2003.

=== Global Strategy for Plant Conservation (2002) ===

In April 2002, the Parties of the UN CBD adopted the recommendations of the Gran Canaria Declaration Calling for a Global Plant Conservation Strategy, and adopted a 16-point plan aiming to slow the rate of plant extinctions around the world by 2010.

===Nagoya Protocol (2010)===
The Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization to the Convention on Biological Diversity was adopted on 29 October 2010 in Nagoya, Aichi Prefecture, Japan, at the tenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties, and entered into force on 12 October 2014. The protocol is a supplementary agreement to the Convention on Biological Diversity, and provides a transparent legal framework for the effective implementation of one of the three objectives of the CBD: the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources. It thereby contributes to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity.

===Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011–2020===
Also at the tenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties, held from 18 to 29 October 2010 in Nagoya, a revised and updated &quot;Strategic Plan for Biodiversity, 2011–2020&quot; was agreed and published. This document included the &quot;Aichi Biodiversity Targets&quot;, comprising 20 targets that address each of five strategic goals defined in the plan. The strategic plan includes the following strategic goals:
* Strategic Goal A: Address the underlying causes of biodiversity loss by mainstreaming biodiversity across government and society
* Strategic Goal B: Reduce the direct pressures on biodiversity and promote sustainable use
* Strategic Goal C: To improve the status of biodiversity by safeguarding ecosystems, species and genetic diversity
* Strategic Goal D: Enhance the benefits to all from biodiversity and ecosystem services
* Strategic Goal E: Enhance implementation through participatory planning, knowledge management and capacity building
Upon the launch of Agenda 2030, CBD released a technical note mapping and identifying synergies between the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the 20 Aichi Biodiversity Targets. This helps to understand the contributions of biodiversity to achieving the SDGs.

=== Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework ===

A new plan, known as the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) was developed to guide action through 2030. A first draft of this framework was released in July 2021, and its final content was discussed and negotiated as part of the COP 15 meetings. Reducing agricultural pollution and sharing the benefits of digital sequence information arose as key points of contention among Parties during development of the framework. A final version was adopted by the Convention on 19 December 2022. The framework includes a number of ambitious goals, including a commitment to designate at least 30 percent of global land and sea as protected areas (known as the &quot;30 by 30&quot; initiative).

=== Marine and coastal biodiversity ===
The CBD has a significant focus on marine and coastal biodiversity. A series of expert workshops have been held (2018–2022) to identify options for modifying the description of Ecologically or Biologically Significant Marine Areas (EBSAs) and describing new areas. These have focused on the North-East, North-West and South-Eastern Atlantic Ocean, Baltic Sea, Caspian Sea, Black Sea, Seas of East Asia, North-West Indian Ocean and Adjacent Gulf Areas, Southern and North-East Indian Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, North and South Pacific, Eastern Tropical and Temperate Pacific, Wider Caribbean and Western Mid-Atlantic. The workshop meetings have followed the EBSA process based on internationally agreed scientific criteria. This is aimed at creating an international legally binding instrument (ILBI) under UNCLOS to support the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction (BBNJ or High Seas Treaty). The central mechanism is area-based planning and decision-making. It integrates EBSAs, Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VMEs) and High Seas (Marine Protected Areas) with Blue Growth scenarios. There is also linkage with the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive.

==Criticism==

There have been criticisms against CBD that its implementation has been weakened due to resistance of Western countries to the implementation of pro-South provisions of the Convention. CBD is also regarded as a case of a hard treaty gone soft in the implementation trajectory. The argument to enforce the treaty as a legally binding multilateral instrument with the Conference of Parties reviewing the infractions and non-compliance is also gaining strength.

Although the Convention explicitly states that all forms of life are covered by its provisions, examination of reports and of national biodiversity strategies and action plans submitted by participating countries shows that in practice this is not happening. The fifth report of the European Union, for example, makes frequent reference to animals (particularly fish) and plants, but does not mention bacteria, fungi or protists at all. The International Society for Fungal Conservation has assessed more than 100 of these CBD documents for their coverage of fungi using defined criteria to place each in one of six categories. No documents were assessed as good or adequate, less than 10% as nearly adequate or poor, and the rest as deficient, seriously deficient or totally deficient.

Scientists working with biodiversity and medical research are expressing fears that the Nagoya Protocol is counterproductive, and will hamper disease prevention and conservation efforts, and that the threat of imprisonment of scientists will have a chilling effect on research. Non-commercial researchers and institutions such as natural history museums fear maintaining biological reference collections and exchanging material between institutions will become difficult, and medical researchers have expressed alarm at plans to expand the protocol to make it illegal to publicly share genetic information, e.g. via GenBank.

William Yancey Brown, when with the Brookings Institution, suggested that the Convention on Biological Diversity should include the preservation of intact genomes and viable cells for every known species and for new species as they are discovered.

==Meetings of the Parties==
A Conference of the Parties (COP) was held annually for three years after 1994, and thence biennially on even-numbered years.


===1994 COP 1===
The first ordinary meeting of the Parties to the Convention took place in November and December 1994, in Nassau, Bahamas. The International Coral Reef Initiative (ICRI) was launched at this first COP for the Convention on Biological Diversity. 

===1995 COP 2===
The second ordinary meeting of the Parties to the Convention took place in November 1995, in Jakarta, Indonesia.

===1996 COP 3===
The third ordinary meeting of the Parties to the Convention took place in November 1996, in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

===1998 COP 4===
The fourth ordinary meeting of the Parties to the Convention took place in May 1998, in Bratislava, Slovakia.

===1999 EX-COP 1 (Cartagena)===
The First Extraordinary Meeting of the Conference of the Parties took place in February 1999, in Cartagena, Colombia. A series of meetings led to the adoption of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety in January 2000, effective from 2003.

===2000 COP 5===
The fifth ordinary meeting of the Parties to the Convention took place in May 2000, in Nairobi, Kenya.

===2002 COP 6===
The sixth ordinary meeting of the Parties to the Convention took place in April 2002, in The Hague, Netherlands.

===2004 COP 7===
The seventh ordinary meeting of the Parties to the Convention took place in February 2004, in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

===2006 COP 8===
The eighth ordinary meeting of the Parties to the Convention took place in March 2006, in Curitiba, Brazil.

===2008 COP 9===
The ninth ordinary meeting of the Parties to the Convention took place in May 2008, in Bonn, Germany.

===2010 COP 10 (Nagoya)===

The tenth ordinary meeting of the Parties to the Convention took place in October 2010, in Nagoya, Japan. It was at this meeting that the Nagoya Protocol was ratified.

2010 was the International Year of Biodiversity, which resulted in 110 reports on the loss of biodiversity in different countries, but little or no progress toward the goal of &quot;significant reduction&quot; in the problem. Following a recommendation of CBD signatories, the UN declared 2011 to 2020 as the United Nations Decade on Biodiversity.

===2012 COP 11===

Leading up to the Conference of the Parties (COP 11) meeting on biodiversity in Hyderabad, India, 2012, preparations for a World Wide Views on Biodiversity has begun, involving old and new partners and building on the experiences from the World Wide Views on Global Warming.

===2014 COP 12===
Under the theme, &quot;Biodiversity for Sustainable Development&quot;, thousands of representatives of governments, NGOs, indigenous peoples, scientists and the private sector gathered in Pyeongchang, Republic of Korea in October 2014 for the 12th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (COP 12).

From 6–17 October 2014, Parties discussed the implementation of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011–2020 and its Aichi Biodiversity Targets, which are to be achieved by the end of this decade. The results of Global Biodiversity Outlook 4, the flagship assessment report of the CBD informed the discussions.

The conference gave a mid-term evaluation to the UN Decade on Biodiversity (2011–2020) initiative, which aims to promote the conservation and sustainable use of nature. The meeting achieved a total of 35 decisions, including a decision on &quot;Mainstreaming gender considerations&quot;, to incorporate gender perspective to the analysis of biodiversity.

At the end of the meeting, the meeting adopted the &quot;Pyeongchang Road Map&quot;, which addresses ways to achieve biodiversity through technology cooperation, funding and strengthening the capacity of developing countries.

===2016 COP 13===

The thirteenth ordinary meeting of the Parties to the Convention took place between 2 and 17 December 2016 in Cancún, Mexico.

===2018 COP 14===
The 14th ordinary meeting of the Parties to the Convention took place on 17–29 November 2018, in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. The 2018 UN Biodiversity Conference closed on 29 November 2018 with broad international agreement on reversing the global destruction of nature and biodiversity loss threatening all forms of life on Earth. Parties adopted the Voluntary Guidelines for the design and effective implementation of ecosystem-based approaches to climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction. Governments also agreed to accelerate action to achieve the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, agreed in 2010, until 2020. Work to achieve these targets would take place at the global, regional, national and subnational levels.

===2021/2022 COP 15===

The 15th meeting of the Parties was originally scheduled to take place in Kunming, China in 2020, but was postponed several times due to the COVID-19 pandemic. After the start date was delayed for a third time, the Convention was split into two sessions. A mostly online event took place in October 2021, where over 100 nations signed the Kunming declaration on biodiversity. The theme of the declaration was &quot;Ecological Civilization: Building a Shared Future for All Life on Earth&quot;. Twenty-one action-oriented draft targets were provisionally agreed in the October meeting, to be further discussed in the second session: an in-person event that was originally scheduled to start in April 2022, but was rescheduled to occur later in 2022. The second part of COP 15 ultimately took place in Montreal, Canada, from 5–17 December 2022. At the meeting, the Parties to the Convention adopted a new action plan, the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework.

===2024 COP 16===
The 16th meeting of the Parties is scheduled to be held in Cali, Colombia in 2024. Originally, Turkey was going to host it but after a series of earthquakes in February 2023 they had to withdraw.

<text>The Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution, often abbreviated as Air Convention or CLRTAP, is intended to protect the human environment against air pollution and to gradually reduce and prevent air pollution, including long-range transboundary air pollution. It is implemented by the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP), directed by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE).

The convention opened for signature on , and entered into force on .

== Secretariat ==
The Convention, which now has 51 Parties, identifies the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) as its secretariat. The current parties to the Convention are shown on the map.

The Convention is implemented by the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP) (short for &quot;Co-operative Programme for Monitoring and Evaluation of the Long-range Transmission of Air Pollutants in Europe&quot;). Results of the EMEP programme are published on the EMEP website, www.emep.int.

== Procedure ==
The aim of the Convention is that Parties shall endeavour to limit and, as far as possible, gradually reduce and prevent air pollution including long-range transboundary air pollution. Parties develop policies and strategies to combat the discharge of air pollutants through exchanges of information, consultation, research and monitoring.

The Parties meet annually at sessions of the Executive Body to review ongoing work and plan future activities including a workplan for the coming year. The three main subsidiary bodies – the Working Group on Effects, the Steering Body to EMEP and the Working Group on Strategies and Review – as well as the Convention&#x27;s Implementation Committee, report to the Executive Body each year.

Currently, the Convention&#x27;s priority activities include review and possible revision of its most recent protocols, implementation of the Convention and its protocols across the entire UNECE region (with special focus on Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia and South-East Europe) and sharing its knowledge and information with other regions of the world.

== Protocols ==
Since 1979 the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution has addressed some of the major environmental problems of the UNECE region through scientific collaboration and policy negotiation. The Convention has been extended by eight protocols that identify specific measures to be taken by Parties to cut their emissions of air pollutants:

* Protocol on Long-Term Financing of the Cooperative Programme for Monitoring and Evaluation of the Long-range Transmission of Air Pollutants in Europe (EMEP) (1984)
* 1985 Helsinki Protocol on the Reduction of Sulphur Emissions
* Nitrogen Oxide Protocol (1988)
* Volatile Organic Compounds Protocol (1991)
* 1994 Oslo Protocol on Further Reduction of Sulphur Emissions
* Protocol on Heavy Metals (1998)
* Aarhus Protocol on Persistent Organic Pollutants (1998)
* 1999 Gothenburg Protocol to Abate Acidification, Eutrophication and Ground-level Ozone (1999)

<doc id="6201" wikidata="Q191836" url="?curid=6201" title="CITES">
<text>CITES (shorter name for the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, also known as the Washington Convention) is a multilateral treaty to protect endangered plants and animals from the threats of international trade. It was drafted as a result of a resolution adopted in 1963 at a meeting of members of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The convention was opened for signature in 1973 and CITES entered into force on 1 July 1975.

Its aim is to ensure that international trade (import/export) in specimens of animals and plants included under CITES does not threaten the survival of the species in the wild. This is achieved via a system of permits and certificates. CITES affords varying degrees of protection to more than 40,900 species.

, the Secretary-General of CITES is Ivonne Higuero.

==Background==
CITES is one of the largest and oldest conservation and sustainable use agreements in existence. There are three working languages of the Convention (English, French and Spanish) in which all documents are made available. Participation is voluntary and countries that have agreed to be bound by the convention are known as Parties. Although CITES is legally binding on the Parties, it does not take the place of national laws. Rather it provides a framework respected by each Party, which must adopt their own domestic legislation to implement CITES at the national level.

Originally, CITES addressed depletion resulting from demand for luxury goods such as furs in Western countries, but with the rising wealth of Asia, particularly in China, the focus changed to products demanded there, particularly those used for luxury goods such as elephant ivory or rhinoceros horn. As of 2022, CITES has expanded to include thousands of species previously considered unremarkable and in no danger of extinction such as manta rays or pangolins.

===Ratifications===

The text of the convention was finalized at a meeting of representatives of 80 countries in Washington, D.C., United States, on 3 March 1973. It was then open for signature until 31 December 1974. It entered into force after the 10th ratification by a signatory country, on 1 July 1975. Countries that signed the Convention become Parties by ratifying, accepting or approving it. By the end of 2003, all signatory countries had become Parties. States that were not signatories may become Parties by acceding to the convention. , the convention has 184 parties, including 183 states and the European Union.

The CITES Convention includes provisions and rules for trade with non-Parties. All member states of the United Nations are party to the treaty, with the exception of North Korea, Federated States of Micronesia, Haiti, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, South Sudan, East Timor, Turkmenistan, and Tuvalu. UN observer the Holy See is also not a member. The Faroe Islands, an autonomous region in the Kingdom of Denmark, is also treated as a non-Party to CITES (both the Danish mainland and Greenland are part of CITES).

An amendment to the text of the convention, known as the Gaborone Amendment allows regional economic integration organizations (REIO), such as the European Union, to have the status of a member state and to be a Party to the convention. The REIO can vote at CITES meetings with the number of votes representing the number of members in the REIO, but it does not have an additional vote.

In accordance with Article XVII, paragraph 3, of the CITES Convention, the Gaborone Amendment entered into force on 29 November 2013, 60 days after 54 (two-thirds) of the 80 States that were party to CITES on 30 April 1983 deposited their instrument of acceptance of the amendment. At that time it entered into force only for those States that had accepted the amendment. The amended text of the convention will apply automatically to any State that becomes a Party after 29 November 2013. For States that became party to the convention before that date and have not accepted the amendment, it will enter into force 60 days after they accept it.

== Governing Structure of CITES ==
CITES operates to support the member Parties. This support consists of the input from three Committees (Standing, Animal and Plant) who are overseen by the Secretary-General. The secretariat position has been held by a variety of people from different nations. 

=== Timeline of CITES Secretary-General Offices ===
1978-1981: Peter H. Sand

He was born in Bavaria, Germany and was educated in international law in Germany, France and Canada. He became a professor and an author, focusing on environmental law, holding other positions such as the Director-General of the IUCN and legal advisor for environmental affairs to the World Bank. 

1982-1990: Eugene Lapointe

A Canadian native, Lapointe served in the military for many years and acted as a diplomat before governing the CITES. He is currently an author and holds the position of President of the IWMC World Conservation Trust, a non-profit organization that promotes wildlife conservation with an emphasis on a human-centered approach to natural-resources.

1991 - 1998: Izgrev Topkov

Born and raised in Bulgaria, Topkov was a diplomat before managing CITES, and was removed from that position following the misuse of permits that violated CITES guidelines.

1999 - 2010: Willem Wijnstekers

A native of the Netherlands and graduate from the University of Amsterdam, Wijnsteker held the position of Secretary-General for the longest period of time and is now an author. 

2010 - 2018: John E. Scanlon

An Australian who studied environmental law, Scanlon was active in combating illegal animal trade and currently works in the effort to protect Elephants in Africa as CEO of the Elephant Protection Initiative Foundation (EPIF). 

2018- Current: Ivonne Higuero 

The first woman to hold this position, Higuero was educated in environmental economics and is from Panama.

== Regulation of trade ==
CITES works by subjecting international trade in specimens of listed taxa to controls as they move across international borders. CITES specimens can include a wide range of items including the whole animal/plant (whether alive or dead), or a product that contains a part or derivative of the listed taxa such as cosmetics or traditional medicines.

Four types of trade are recognized by CITES - import, export, re-export (export of any specimen that has previously been imported) and introduction from the sea (transportation into a state of specimens of any species which were taken in the marine environment not under the jurisdiction of any state). The CITES definition of &quot;trade&quot; does not require a financial transaction to be occurring. All trade in specimens of species covered by CITES must be authorized through a system of permits and certificates prior to the trade taking place. CITES permits and certificates are issued by one or more Management Authorities in charge of administering the CITES system in each country. Management Authorities are advised by one or more Scientific Authorities on the effects of trade of the specimen on the status of CITES-listed species. CITES permits and certificates must be presented to relevant border authorities in each country in order to authorize the trade.

Each party must enact their own domestic legislation to bring the provisions of CITES into effect in their territories. Parties may choose to take stricter domestic measures than CITES provides (for example by requiring permits/certificates in cases where they would not normally be needed or by prohibiting trade in some specimens).

===Appendices===
Over 40,900 species, subspecies and populations are protected under CITES. Each protected taxa or population is included in one of three lists called Appendices. The Appendix that lists a taxon or population reflects the level of the threat posed by international trade and the CITES controls that apply.

Taxa may be split-listed meaning that some populations of a species are on one Appendix, while some are on another. The African bush elephant (&quot;Loxodonta africana&quot;) is currently split-listed, with all populations except those of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe listed in Appendix I. Those of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe are listed in Appendix II. There are also species that have only some populations listed in an Appendix. One example is the pronghorn (&quot;Antilocapra americana&quot;), a ruminant native to North America. Its Mexican population is listed in Appendix I, but its U.S. and Canadian populations are not listed (though certain U.S. populations in Arizona are nonetheless protected under other domestic legislation, in this case the Endangered Species Act).

Taxa are proposed for inclusion, amendment or deletion in Appendices I and II at meetings of the Conference of the Parties (CoP), which are held approximately once every three years. Amendments to listing in Appendix III may be made unilaterally by individual parties.

====Appendix I====
Appendix I taxa are those that are threatened with extinction and to which the highest level of CITES protection is afforded. Commercial trade in wild-sourced specimens of these taxa is not permitted and non-commercial trade is strictly controlled by requiring an import permit and export permit to be granted by the relevant Management Authorities in each country before the trade occurs.

Notable taxa listed in Appendix I include the red panda (&quot;Ailurus fulgens&quot;), western gorilla (&quot;Gorilla gorilla&quot;), the chimpanzee species (&quot;Pan spp.&quot;), tigers (&quot;Panthera tigris&quot; sp.), Asian elephant (&quot;Elephas maximus&quot;), snow leopard (&quot;Panthera uncia&quot;), red-shanked douc (&quot;Pygathrix nemaeus&quot;), some populations of African bush elephant (&quot;Loxodonta africana&quot;), and the monkey puzzle tree (&quot;Araucaria araucana&quot;).

====Appendix II====
Appendix II taxa are those that are not necessarily threatened with extinction, but trade must be controlled in order to avoid utilization incompatible with their survival. Appendix II taxa may also include species similar in appearance to species already listed in the Appendices. The vast majority of taxa listed under CITES are listed in Appendix II. Any trade in Appendix II taxa standardly requires a CITES export permit or re-export certificate to be granted by the Management Authority of the exporting country before the trade occurs.

Examples of taxa listed on Appendix II are the great white shark (&quot;Carcharodon carcharias&quot;), the American black bear (&quot;Ursus americanus&quot;), Hartmann&#x27;s mountain zebra (&quot;Equus zebra hartmannae&quot;), green iguana (&quot;Iguana iguana&quot;), queen conch (&quot;Strombus gigas&quot;), emperor scorpion (&quot;Pandinus imperator&quot;), Mertens&#x27; water monitor (&quot;Varanus mertensi&quot;), bigleaf mahogany (&quot;Swietenia macrophylla&quot;), lignum vitae (&quot;Guaiacum officinale&quot;), the chambered nautilus (&quot;Nautilus pompilius&quot;), all stony corals (&quot;Scleractinia&quot; spp.), Jungle cat (&quot;Felis chaus&quot;) and American ginseng (&quot;Panax quinquefolius&quot;).

====Appendix III====
Appendix III species are those that are protected in at least one country, and that country has asked other CITES Parties for assistance in controlling the trade.
Any trade in Appendix III species standardly requires a CITES export permit (if sourced from the country that listed the species) or a certificate of origin (from any other country) to be granted before the trade occurs.

Examples of species listed on Appendix III and the countries that listed them are the Hoffmann&#x27;s two-toed sloth (&quot;Choloepus hoffmanni&quot;) by Costa Rica, sitatunga (&quot;Tragelaphus spekii&quot;) by Ghana and African civet (&quot;Civettictis civetta&quot;) by Botswana.

===Exemptions and special procedures===
Under Article VII, the Convention allows for certain exceptions to the general trade requirements described above.

====Pre-Convention specimens====
CITES provides for a special process for specimens that were acquired before the provisions of the Convention applied to that specimen. These are known as &quot;pre-Convention&quot; specimens and must be granted a CITES pre-Convention certificate before the trade occurs. Only specimens legally acquired before the date on which the species concerned was first included in the Appendices qualify for this exemption.

====Personal and household effects====
CITES provides that the standard permit/certificate requirements for trade in CITES specimens do not generally apply if a specimen is a personal or household effect. However there are a number of situations where permits/certificates for personal or household effects are required and some countries choose to take stricter domestic measures by requiring permits/certificates for some or all personal or household effects.

====Captive bred or artificially propagated specimens====
CITES allows trade in specimens to follow special procedures if Management Authorities are satisfied that they are sourced from captive bred animals or artificially propagated plants. 
In the case of commercial trade of Appendix I taxa, captive bred or artificially propagated specimens may be traded as if they were Appendix II. This reduces the permit requirements from two permits (import/export) to one (export only). 
In the case of non-commercial trade, specimens may be traded with a certificate of captive breeding/artificial propagation issued by the Management Authority of the state of export in lieu of standard permits.

====Scientific exchange====
Standard CITES permit and certificates are not required for the non-commercial loan, donation or exchange between scientific or forensic institutions that have been registered by a Management Authority of their State. Consignments containing the specimens must carry a label issued or approved by that Management Authority (in some cases Customs Declaration labels may be used). Specimens that may be included under this provision include museum, herbarium, diagnostic and forensic research specimens. Registered institutions are listed on the CITES website.

==Amendments and reservations==
Amendments to the Convention must be supported by a two-thirds majority who are &quot;present and voting&quot; and can be made during an extraordinary meeting of the COP if one-third of the Parties are interested in such a meeting. The Gaborone Amendment (1983) allows regional economic blocs to accede to the treaty. Trade with non-Party states is allowed, although permits and certificates are recommended to be issued by exporters and sought by importers.

Species in the Appendices may be proposed for addition, change of Appendix, or de-listing (i.e., deletion) by any Party, whether or not it is a range State and changes may be made despite objections by range States if there is sufficient (2/3 majority) support for the listing. Species listings are made at the Conference of Parties.

Upon acceding to the Convention or within 90 days of a species listing being amended, Parties may make reservations. In these cases, the party is treated as being a state that is not a Party to CITES with respect to trade in the species concerned. Notable reservations include those by Iceland, Japan, and Norway on various baleen whale species and those on Falconiformes by Saudi Arabia.

==Shortcomings and concerns==

===Implementation===
As of 2002, 50% of Parties lacked one or more of the four major CITES requirements - designation of Management and Scientific Authorities; laws prohibiting the trade in violation of CITES; penalties for such trade and laws providing for the confiscation of specimens.

Although the Convention itself does not provide for arbitration or dispute in the case of noncompliance, 36 years of CITES in practice has resulted in several strategies to deal with infractions by Parties. The Secretariat, when informed of an infraction by a Party, will notify all other parties. The Secretariat will give the Party time to respond to the allegations and may provide technical assistance to prevent further infractions. Other actions the Convention itself does not provide for but that derive from subsequent COP resolutions may be taken against the offending Party. These include:
*Mandatory confirmation of all permits by the Secretariat
*Suspension of cooperation from the Secretariat
*A formal warning
*A visit by the Secretariat to verify capacity
*Recommendations to all Parties to suspend CITES related trade with the offending party
*Dictation of corrective measures to be taken by the offending Party before the Secretariat will resume cooperation or recommend resumption of trade
Bilateral sanctions have been imposed on the basis of national legislation (e.g. the USA used certification under the Pelly Amendment to get Japan to revoke its reservation to hawksbill turtle products in 1991, thus reducing the volume of its exports).

Infractions may include negligence with respect to permit issuing, excessive trade, lax enforcement, and failing to produce annual reports (the most common).

===Approach to biodiversity conservation===
General limitations about the structure and philosophy of CITES include: by design and intent it focuses on trade at the species level and does not address habitat loss, ecosystem approaches to conservation, or poverty; it seeks to prevent unsustainable use rather than promote sustainable use (which generally conflicts with the Convention on Biological Diversity), although this has been changing (see Nile crocodile, African elephant, South African white rhino case studies in Hutton and Dickinson 2000). It does not explicitly address market demand. In fact, CITES listings have been demonstrated to increase financial speculation in certain markets for high value species. Funding does not provide for increased on-the-ground enforcement (it must apply for bilateral aid for most projects of this nature).

There has been increasing willingness within the Parties to allow for trade in products from well-managed populations. For instance, sales of the South African white rhino have generated revenues that helped pay for protection. Listing the species on Appendix I increased the price of rhino horn (which fueled more poaching), but the species survived wherever there was adequate on-the-ground protection. Thus field protection may be the primary mechanism that saved the population, but it is likely that field protection would not have been increased without CITES protection. In another instance, the United States initially stopped exports of bobcat and lynx hides in 1977 when it first implemented CITES for lack of data to support no detriment findings. However, in this Federal Register notice, issued by William Yancey Brown, the U.S. Endangered Species Scientific Authority (ESSA) established a framework of no detriment findings for each state and the Navajo nation and indicated that approval would be forthcoming if the states and Navajo nation provided evidence that their furbearer management programs assured the species would be conserved. Management programs for these species expanded rapidly, including tagging for export, and are currently recognized in program approvals under regulations of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

===Drafting===
By design, CITES regulates and monitors trade in the manner of a &quot;negative list&quot; such that trade in all species is permitted and unregulated &quot;unless&quot; the species in question appears on the Appendices or looks very much like one of those taxa. Then and only then, trade is regulated or constrained. Because the remit of the Convention covers millions of species of plants and animals, and tens of thousands of these taxa are potentially of economic value, in practice this negative list approach effectively forces CITES signatories to expend limited resources on just a select few, leaving many species to be traded with neither constraint nor review. For example, recently several bird classified as threatened with extinction appeared in the legal wild bird trade because the CITES process never considered their status. If a &quot;positive list&quot; approach were taken, only species evaluated and approved for the positive list would be permitted in trade, thus lightening the review burden for member states and the Secretariat, and also preventing inadvertent legal trade threats to poorly known species.

Specific weaknesses in the text include: it does not stipulate guidelines for the &#x27;non-detriment&#x27; finding required of national Scientific Authorities; non-detriment findings require copious amounts of information; the &#x27;household effects&#x27; clause is often not rigid enough/specific enough to prevent CITES violations by means of this Article (VII); non-reporting from Parties means Secretariat monitoring is incomplete; and it has no capacity to address domestic trade in listed species.

In order to ensure that the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was not violated, the Secretariat of GATT was consulted during the drafting process.

===Animal sourced pathogens===
During the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 CEO Ivonne Higuero noted that illegal wildlife trade not only helps to destroy habitats, but these habitats create a safety barrier for humans that can prevent pathogens from animals passing themselves on to people.

===Reform suggestions===
Suggestions for improvement in the operation of CITES include: more regular missions by the Secretariat (not reserved just for high-profile species); improvement of national legislation and enforcement; better reporting by Parties (and the consolidation of information from all sources-NGOs, TRAFFIC, the wildlife trade monitoring network and Parties); more emphasis on enforcement-including a technical committee enforcement officer; the development of CITES Action Plans (akin to Biodiversity Action Plans related to the Convention on Biological Diversity) including: designation of Scientific/Management Authorities and national enforcement strategies; incentives for reporting and timelines for both Action Plans and reporting. CITES would benefit from access to Global Environment Facility (GEF), funds-although this is difficult given the GEFs more ecosystem approach-or other more regular funds. Development of a future mechanism similar to that of the Montreal Protocol (developed nations contribute to a fund for developing nations) could allow more funds for non-Secretariat activities.

=== TRAFFIC Data ===
From 2005 to 2009 the legal trade corresponded with these numbers:
* 317,000 live birds
* More than 2 million live reptiles
* 2.5 million crocodile skins
* 2.1 million snake skins
* 73 tons of caviar
* 1.1 million beaver skins
* Millions of pieces of coral
* 20,000 mammalian hunting trophies
In the 1990s the annual trade of legal animal products was $160 billion annually. In 2009 the estimated value almost doubled to $300 billion.

Traffic released a report in December, 2024 outlining illegal trade in animal products occurring in Vietnam:
Additional information about the documented trade can be extracted through queries on the CITES website.

==Meetings==
The Conference of the Parties (CoP) is held once every three years. The location of the next CoP is chosen at the close of each CoP by a secret ballot vote.

The CITES Committees (Animals Committee, Plants Committee and Standing Committee) hold meetings during each year that does not have a CoP, while the Standing committee meets also in years with a CoP. The Committee meetings take place in Geneva, Switzerland (where the Secretariat of the CITES Convention is located), unless another country offers to host the meeting. The Secretariat is administered by UNEP. The Animals and Plants Committees have sometimes held joint meetings. The previous joint meeting was held in March 2012 in Dublin, Ireland, and the latest one was held in Veracruz, Mexico, in May 2014.

A current list of upcoming meetings appears on the CITES calendar.

At the seventeenth Conference of the Parties (CoP 17), Namibia and Zimbabwe introduced proposals to amend their listing of elephant populations in Appendix II. Instead, they wished to establish controlled trade in all elephant specimens, including ivory. They argue that revenue from regulated trade could be used for elephant conservation and rural communities&#x27; development. However, both proposals were opposed by the US and other countries.

<text>The Environmental Modification Convention (ENMOD), formally the Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques, is an international treaty prohibiting the military or other hostile use of environmental modification techniques having widespread, long-lasting or severe effects. It opened for signature on 18 May 1977 in Geneva and entered into force on 5 October 1978.

The Convention bans weather warfare, which is the use of weather modification techniques for the purposes of inducing damage or destruction. The Convention on Biological Diversity of 2010 would also ban some forms of weather modification or geoengineering.

Many states do not regard this as a complete ban on the use of herbicides in warfare, such as Agent Orange, but it does require case-by-case consideration.

==Parties==

The convention was signed by 48 states; 16 of the signatories have not ratified. As of 2022 the convention has 78 state parties.

==History==
The problem of artificial modification of the environment for military or other hostile purposes was brought to the international agenda in the early 1970s. Following the US decision of July 1972 to renounce the use of climate modification techniques for hostile purposes, the 1973 resolution by the US Senate calling for an international agreement &quot;prohibiting the use of any environmental or geophysical modification activity as a weapon of war&quot;, and an in-depth review by the Department of Defense of the military aspects of weather and other environmental modification techniques, US decided to seek agreement with the Soviet Union to explore the possibilities of an international agreement.

In July 1974, US and USSR agreed to hold bilateral discussions on measures to overcome the danger of the use of environmental modification techniques for military purposes and three subsequent rounds of discussions in 1974 and 1975. In August 1975, US and USSR tabled identical draft texts of a convention at the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament (CCD), Conference on Disarmament, where intensive negotiations resulted in a modified text and understandings regarding four articles of this Convention in 1976.

The convention was approved by Resolution 31/72 of the General Assembly of the United Nations on 10 December 1976, by 96 to 8 votes with 30 abstentions.

==Environmental Modification Technique==
Environmental Modification Technique includes any technique for changing – through the deliberate manipulation of natural processes – the dynamics, composition or structure of the earth, including its biota, lithosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere, or of outer space.

==Structure of ENMOD==
The Convention contains ten articles and one Annex on the Consultative Committee of Experts. Integral part of the convention are also the Understandings relating to articles I, II, III and VIII. These Understandings are not incorporated into the convention but are part of the negotiating record and were included in the report transmitted by the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament to the United Nations General Assembly in September 1976 Report of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament, Volume I, General Assembly Official records: Thirty-first session, Supplement No. 27 (A/31/27), New York, United Nations, 1976, pp. 91–92.

==Anthropogenic climate change==
ENMOD treaty members are responsible for 83% of carbon dioxide emissions since the treaty entered into force in 1978. The ENMOD treaty could potentially be used by ENMOD member states seeking climate-change loss and damage compensation from other ENMOD member states at the International Court of Justice. With the knowledge that carbon dioxide emissions can enhance extreme weather events, the continued unmitigated greenhouse gas emissions from some ENMOD member states could be viewed as ‘reckless’ in the context of deliberately declining emissions from other ENMOD member states. It is unclear whether the International Court of Justice will consider the ENMOD treaty when it issues a legal opinion on international climate change obligations requested by the United Nations General Assembly on 29 March 2023.

<doc id="6205" wikidata="Q735775" url="?curid=6205" title="Chaitin's constant">
<text>In the computer science subfield of algorithmic information theory, a Chaitin constant (Chaitin omega number) or halting probability is a real number that, informally speaking, represents the probability that a randomly constructed program will halt. These numbers are formed from a construction due to Gregory Chaitin.

Although there are infinitely many halting probabilities, one for each (universal, see below) method of encoding programs, it is common to use the letter to refer to them as if there were only one. Because depends on the program encoding used, it is sometimes called Chaitin&#x27;s construction when not referring to any specific encoding.

Each halting probability is a normal and transcendental real number that is not computable, which means that there is no algorithm to compute its digits. Each halting probability is Martin-Löf random, meaning there is not even any algorithm which can reliably guess its digits.

== Background ==
The definition of a halting probability relies on the existence of a prefix-free universal computable function. Such a function, intuitively, represents a program in a programming language with the property that no valid program can be obtained as a proper extension of another valid program. Computer programming languages generally consist of sequences of commands, so no programming language is a prefix-free universal computable function.

Suppose that is a partial function that takes one argument, a finite binary string, and possibly returns a single binary string as output. The function is called computable if there is a Turing machine that computes it, in the sense that for any finite binary strings and , if and only if the Turing machine halts with on its tape when given the input .

The function is called universal if for every computable function of a single variable there is a string such that for all , ; here represents the concatenation of the two strings and . This means that can be used to simulate any computable function of one variable. Informally, represents a &quot;script&quot; for the computable function , and represents an &quot;interpreter&quot; that parses the script as a prefix of its input and then executes it on the remainder of input.

The domain of is the set of all inputs on which it is defined. For that are universal, such a can generally be seen both as the concatenation of a program part and a data part, and as a single program for the function .

The function is called prefix-free if there are no two elements , in its domain such that is a proper extension of . This can be rephrased as: the domain of is a prefix-free code (instantaneous code) on the set of finite binary strings. A simple way to enforce prefix-free-ness is to use machines whose means of input is a binary stream from which bits can be read one at a time. There is no end-of-stream marker; the end of input is determined by when the universal machine decides to stop reading more bits, and the remaining bits are not considered part of the accepted string. Here, the difference between the two notions of program mentioned in the last paragraph becomes clear; one is easily recognized by some grammar, while the other requires arbitrary computation to recognize.

The domain of any universal computable function is a computably enumerable set but never a computable set. The domain is always Turing equivalent to the halting problem.

== Definition ==
Let be the domain of a prefix-free universal computable function . The constant is then defined as

formula_1

where denotes the length of a string . This is an infinite sum which has one summand for every in the domain of . The requirement that the domain be prefix-free, together with Kraft&#x27;s inequality, ensures that this sum converges to a real number between 0 and 1. If is clear from context then may be denoted simply , although different prefix-free universal computable functions lead to different values of .

== Relationship to the halting problem ==
Knowing the first bits of , one could calculate the halting problem for all programs of a size up to . Let the program for which the halting problem is to be solved be bits long. In dovetailing fashion, all programs of all lengths are run, until enough have halted to jointly contribute enough probability to match these first bits. If the program has not halted yet, then it never will, since its contribution to the halting probability would affect the first bits. Thus, the halting problem would be solved for .

Because many outstanding problems in number theory, such as Goldbach&#x27;s conjecture, are equivalent to solving the halting problem for special programs (which would basically search for counter-examples and halt if one is found), knowing enough bits of Chaitin&#x27;s constant would also imply knowing the answer to these problems. But as the halting problem is not generally solvable, and therefore calculating any but the first few bits of Chaitin&#x27;s constant is not possible for a universal language. This reduces hard problems to impossible ones, much like trying to build an oracle machine for the halting problem would be.

== Interpretation as a probability ==
The Cantor space is the collection of all infinite sequences of 0s and 1s. A halting probability can be interpreted as the measure of a certain subset of Cantor space under the usual probability measure on Cantor space. It is from this interpretation that halting probabilities take their name.

The probability measure on Cantor space, sometimes called the fair-coin measure, is defined so that for any binary string the set of sequences that begin with has measure . This implies that for each natural number , the set of sequences in Cantor space such that = 1 has measure , and the set of sequences whose th element is 0 also has measure .

Let be a prefix-free universal computable function. The domain of consists of an infinite set of binary strings

formula_2

Each of these strings determines a subset of Cantor space; the set contains all sequences in cantor space that begin with . These sets are disjoint because is a prefix-free set. The sum

formula_3

represents the measure of the set 

formula_4

In this way, represents the probability that a randomly selected infinite sequence of 0s and 1s begins with a bit string (of some finite length) that is in the domain of . It is for this reason that is called a halting probability.

== Properties ==
Each Chaitin constant has the following properties:

* It is algorithmically random (also known as Martin-Löf random or 1-random). This means that the shortest program to output the first bits of must be of size at least . This is because, as in the Goldbach example, those bits enable us to find out exactly which programs halt among all those of length at most .
* As a consequence, it is a normal number, which means that its digits are equidistributed as if they were generated by tossing a fair coin.
* It is not a computable number; there is no computable function that enumerates its binary expansion, as discussed below.
* The set of rational numbers such that is computably enumerable; a real number with such a property is called a left-c.e. real number in recursion theory.
* The set of rational numbers such that is not computably enumerable. (Reason: every left-c.e. real with this property is computable, which is not.)
* It is an arithmetical number.
* It is Turing equivalent to the halting problem and thus at level of the arithmetical hierarchy.

Not every set that is Turing equivalent to the halting problem is a halting probability. A finer equivalence relation, Solovay equivalence, can be used to characterize the halting probabilities among the left-c.e. reals. One can show that a real number in is a Chaitin constant (i.e. the halting probability of some prefix-free universal computable function) if and only if it is left-c.e. and algorithmically random. is among the few definable algorithmically random numbers and is the best-known algorithmically random number, but it is not at all typical of all algorithmically random numbers.

== Uncomputability ==
A real number is called computable if there is an algorithm which, given , returns the first digits of the number. This is equivalent to the existence of a program that enumerates the digits of the real number.

No halting probability is computable. The proof of this fact relies on an algorithm which, given the first digits of , solves Turing&#x27;s halting problem for programs of length up to . Since the halting problem is undecidable, cannot be computed.

The algorithm proceeds as follows. Given the first digits of and a , the algorithm enumerates the domain of until enough elements of the domain have been found so that the probability they represent is within of . After this point, no additional program of length can be in the domain, because each of these would add to the measure, which is impossible. Thus the set of strings of length in the domain is exactly the set of such strings already enumerated.

== Algorithmic randomness ==
A real number is random if the binary sequence representing the real number is an algorithmically random sequence. Calude, Hertling, Khoussainov, and Wang showed that a recursively enumerable real number is an algorithmically random sequence if and only if it is a Chaitin&#x27;s number.

== Incompleteness theorem for halting probabilities ==
For each specific consistent effectively represented axiomatic system for the natural numbers, such as Peano arithmetic, there exists a constant such that no bit of after the th can be proven to be 1 or 0 within that system. The constant depends on how the formal system is effectively represented, and thus does not directly reflect the complexity of the axiomatic system. This incompleteness result is similar to Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem in that it shows that no consistent formal theory for arithmetic can be complete.

== Super Omega ==
The first bits of Gregory Chaitin&#x27;s constant are random or incompressible in the sense that they cannot be computed by a halting algorithm with fewer than bits. However, consider the short but never halting algorithm which systematically lists and runs all possible programs; whenever one of them halts its probability gets added to the output (initialized by zero). After finite time the first bits of the output will never change any more (it does not matter that this time itself is not computable by a halting program). So there is a short non-halting algorithm whose output converges (after finite time) onto the first bits of . In other words, the enumerable first bits of are highly compressible in the sense that they are limit-computable by a very short algorithm; they are not random with respect to the set of enumerating algorithms. Jürgen Schmidhuber constructed a limit-computable &quot;Super &quot; which in a sense is much more random than the original limit-computable , as one cannot significantly compress the Super by any enumerating non-halting algorithm.

For an alternative &quot;Super &quot;, the universality probability of a prefix-free universal Turing machine (UTM) namely, the probability that it remains universal even when every input of it (as a binary string) is prefixed by a random binary string can be seen as the non-halting probability of a machine with oracle the third iteration of the halting problem (i.e., using Turing jump notation).

<text>In mathematics, computable numbers are the real numbers that can be computed to within any desired precision by a finite, terminating algorithm. They are also known as the recursive numbers, effective numbers, computable reals, or recursive reals. The concept of a computable real number was introduced by Émile Borel in 1912, using the intuitive notion of computability available at the time.

Equivalent definitions can be given using μ-recursive functions, Turing machines, or λ-calculus as the formal representation of algorithms. The computable numbers form a real closed field and can be used in the place of real numbers for many, but not all, mathematical purposes.

==Informal definition==
In the following, Marvin Minsky defines the numbers to be computed in a manner similar to those defined by Alan Turing in 1936; i.e., as &quot;sequences of digits interpreted as decimal fractions&quot; between 0 and 1:


The key notions in the definition are (1) that some &quot;n&quot; is specified at the start, (2) for any &quot;n&quot; the computation only takes a finite number of steps, after which the machine produces the desired output and terminates.

An alternate form of (2) – the machine successively prints all &quot;n&quot; of the digits on its tape, halting after printing the &quot;n&quot;th – emphasizes Minsky&#x27;s observation: (3) That by use of a Turing machine, a &quot;finite&quot; definition – in the form of the machine&#x27;s state table – is being used to define what is a potentially &quot;infinite&quot; string of decimal digits.

This is however not the modern definition which only requires the result be accurate to within any given accuracy. The informal definition above is subject to a rounding problem called the table-maker&#x27;s dilemma whereas the modern definition is not.

==Formal definition==
A real number &quot;a&quot; is computable if it can be approximated by some computable function formula_1 in the following manner: given any positive integer &quot;n&quot;, the function produces an integer &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) such that:

:formula_2

A complex number is called computable if its real and imaginary parts are computable.

===Equivalent definitions===
There are two similar definitions that are equivalent:
*There exists a computable function which, given any positive rational error bound formula_3, produces a rational number &quot;r&quot; such that formula_4
*There is a computable sequence of rational numbers formula_5 converging to formula_6 such that formula_7 for each &quot;i&quot;.

There is another equivalent definition of computable numbers via computable Dedekind cuts. A computable Dedekind cut is a computable function formula_8 which when provided with a rational number formula_9 as input returns formula_10 or formula_11, satisfying the following conditions:
:formula_12
:formula_13
:formula_14
An example is given by a program &quot;D&quot; that defines the cube root of 3. Assuming formula_15 this is defined by:
:formula_16
:formula_17

A real number is computable if and only if there is a computable Dedekind cut &quot;D&quot; corresponding to it. The function &quot;D&quot; is unique for each computable number (although of course two different programs may provide the same function).

==Properties==

===Not computably enumerable===
Assigning a Gödel number to each Turing machine definition produces a subset formula_18 of the natural numbers corresponding to the computable numbers and identifies a surjection from formula_18 to the computable numbers. There are only countably many Turing machines, showing that the computable numbers are subcountable. The set formula_18 of these Gödel numbers, however, is not computably enumerable (and consequently, neither are subsets of formula_18 that are defined in terms of it). This is because there is no algorithm to determine which Gödel numbers correspond to Turing machines that produce computable reals. In order to produce a computable real, a Turing machine must compute a total function, but the corresponding decision problem is in Turing degree 0′′. Consequently, there is no surjective computable function from the natural numbers to the set formula_18 of machines representing computable reals, and Cantor&#x27;s diagonal argument cannot be used constructively to demonstrate uncountably many of them.

While the set of real numbers is uncountable, the set of computable numbers is classically countable and thus almost all real numbers are not computable. Here, for any given computable number formula_23 the well ordering principle provides that there is a minimal element in formula_18 which corresponds to formula_25, and therefore there exists a subset consisting of the minimal elements, on which the map is a bijection. The inverse of this bijection is an injection into the natural numbers of the computable numbers, proving that they are countable. But, again, this subset is not computable, even though the computable reals are themselves ordered.

===Properties as a field===
The arithmetical operations on computable numbers are themselves computable in the sense that whenever real numbers &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are computable then the following real numbers are also computable: &quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot;, &quot;a&quot; - &quot;b&quot;, &quot;ab&quot;, and &quot;a&quot;/&quot;b&quot; if &quot;b&quot; is nonzero.
These operations are actually &quot;uniformly computable&quot;; for example, there is a Turing machine which on input (&quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot;,formula_26) produces output &quot;r&quot;, where &quot;A&quot; is the description of a Turing machine approximating &quot;a&quot;, &quot;B&quot; is the description of a Turing machine approximating &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;r&quot; is an formula_26 approximation of &quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot;.

The fact that computable real numbers form a field was first proved by Henry Gordon Rice in 1954.

Computable reals however do not form a computable field, because the definition of a computable field requires effective equality.

===Non-computability of the ordering===
The order relation on the computable numbers is not computable. Let &quot;A&quot; be the description of a Turing machine approximating the number formula_6. Then there is no Turing machine which on input &quot;A&quot; outputs &quot;YES&quot; if formula_29 and &quot;NO&quot; if formula_30 To see why, suppose the machine described by &quot;A&quot; keeps outputting 0 as formula_26 approximations. It is not clear how long to wait before deciding that the machine will &quot;never&quot; output an approximation which forces &quot;a&quot; to be positive. Thus the machine will eventually have to guess that the number will equal 0, in order to produce an output; the sequence may later become different from 0. This idea can be used to show that the machine is incorrect on some sequences if it computes a total function. A similar problem occurs when the computable reals are represented as Dedekind cuts. The same holds for the equality relation: the equality test is not computable.

While the full order relation is not computable, the restriction of it to pairs of unequal numbers is computable. That is, there is a program that takes as input two Turing machines &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; approximating numbers formula_32 and formula_33, where formula_34, and outputs whether formula_35 or formula_36 It is sufficient to use formula_26-approximations where formula_38 so by taking increasingly small formula_26 (approaching 0), one eventually can decide whether formula_35 or formula_36

===Other properties===
The computable real numbers do not share all the properties of the real numbers used in analysis. For example, the least upper bound of a bounded increasing computable sequence of computable real numbers need not be a computable real number. A sequence with this property is known as a Specker sequence, as the first construction is due to Ernst Specker in 1949. Despite the existence of counterexamples such as these, parts of calculus and real analysis can be developed in the field of computable numbers, leading to the study of computable analysis.

Every computable number is arithmetically definable, but not vice versa. There are many arithmetically definable, noncomputable real numbers, including:
*any number that encodes the solution of the halting problem (or any other undecidable problem) according to a chosen encoding scheme.
*Chaitin&#x27;s constant, formula_42, which is a type of real number that is Turing equivalent to the halting problem.
Both of these examples in fact define an infinite set of definable, uncomputable numbers, one for each universal Turing machine.
A real number is computable if and only if the set of natural numbers it represents (when written in binary and viewed as a characteristic function) is computable.

The set of computable real numbers (as well as every countable, densely ordered subset of computable reals without ends) is order-isomorphic to the set of rational numbers.

==Digit strings and the Cantor and Baire spaces==

Turing&#x27;s original paper defined computable numbers as follows:

(The decimal expansion of &quot;a&quot; only refers to the digits following the decimal point.)

Turing was aware that this definition is equivalent to the formula_26-approximation definition given above. The argument proceeds as follows: if a number is computable in the Turing sense, then it is also computable in the formula_26 sense: if formula_45, then the first &quot;n&quot; digits of the decimal expansion for &quot;a&quot; provide an formula_26 approximation of &quot;a&quot;. For the converse, we pick an formula_26 computable real number &quot;a&quot; and generate increasingly precise approximations until the &quot;n&quot;th digit after the decimal point is certain. This always generates a decimal expansion equal to &quot;a&quot; but it may improperly end in an infinite sequence of 9&#x27;s in which case it must have a finite (and thus computable) proper decimal expansion.

Unless certain topological properties of the real numbers are relevant, it is often more convenient to deal with elements of formula_48 (total 0,1 valued functions) instead of reals numbers in formula_49. The members of formula_48 can be identified with binary decimal expansions, but since the decimal expansions formula_51 and formula_52 denote the same real number, the interval formula_49 can only be bijectively (and homeomorphically under the subset topology) identified with the subset of formula_48 not ending in all 1&#x27;s.

Note that this property of decimal expansions means that it is impossible to effectively identify the computable real numbers defined in terms of a decimal expansion and those defined in the formula_26 approximation sense. Hirst has shown that there is no algorithm which takes as input the description of a Turing machine which produces formula_26 approximations for the computable number &quot;a&quot;, and produces as output a Turing machine which enumerates the digits of &quot;a&quot; in the sense of Turing&#x27;s definition. Similarly, it means that the arithmetic operations on the computable reals are not effective on their decimal representations as when adding decimal numbers. In order to produce one digit, it may be necessary to look arbitrarily far to the right to determine if there is a carry to the current location. This lack of uniformity is one reason why the contemporary definition of computable numbers uses formula_26 approximations rather than decimal expansions.

However, from a computability theoretic or measure theoretic perspective, the two structures formula_48 and formula_49 are essentially identical. Thus, computability theorists often refer to members of formula_48 as reals. While formula_48 is totally disconnected, for questions about formula_62 classes or randomness it is easier to work in formula_48.

Elements of formula_64 are sometimes called reals as well and though containing a homeomorphic image of formula_65, formula_64 isn&#x27;t even locally compact (in addition to being totally disconnected). This leads to genuine differences in the computational properties. For instance the formula_67 satisfying formula_68, with formula_69 quantifier free, must be computable while the unique formula_70 satisfying a universal formula may have an arbitrarily high position in the hyperarithmetic hierarchy.

==Use in place of the reals==

The computable numbers include the specific real numbers which appear in practice, including all real algebraic numbers, as well as &quot;e&quot;, &quot;π&quot;, and many other transcendental numbers. Though the computable reals exhaust those reals we can calculate or approximate, the assumption that all reals are computable leads to substantially different conclusions about the real numbers. The question naturally arises of whether it is possible to dispose of the full set of reals and use computable numbers for all of mathematics. This idea is appealing from a constructivist point of view, and has been pursued by the Russian school of constructive mathematics.

To actually develop analysis over computable numbers, some care must be taken. For example, if one uses the classical definition of a sequence, the set of computable numbers is not closed under the basic operation of taking the supremum of a bounded sequence (for example, consider a Specker sequence, see the section above). This difficulty is addressed by considering only sequences which have a computable modulus of convergence. The resulting mathematical theory is called computable analysis.

==Implementations of exact arithmetic==

Computer packages representing real numbers as programs computing approximations have been proposed as early as 1985, under the name &quot;exact arithmetic&quot;. Modern examples include the CoRN library (Coq), and the RealLib package (C++). A related line of work is based on taking a real RAM program and running it with rational or floating-point numbers of sufficient precision, such as the package.

<doc id="6207" wikidata="Q11651" url="?curid=6207" title="Electric current">
<text>An electric current is a flow of charged particles, such as electrons or ions, moving through an electrical conductor or space. It is defined as the net rate of flow of electric charge through a surface. The moving particles are called charge carriers, which may be one of several types of particles, depending on the conductor. In electric circuits the charge carriers are often electrons moving through a wire. In semiconductors they can be electrons or holes. In an electrolyte the charge carriers are ions, while in plasma, an ionized gas, they are ions and electrons.

In the International System of Units (SI), electric current is expressed in units of ampere (sometimes called an &quot;amp&quot;, symbol A), which is equivalent to one coulomb per second. The ampere is an SI base unit and electric current is a base quantity in the International System of Quantities (ISQ). Electric current is also known as amperage and is measured using a device called an &quot;ammeter&quot;.

Electric currents create magnetic fields, which are used in motors, generators, inductors, and transformers. In ordinary conductors, they cause Joule heating, which creates light in incandescent light bulbs. Time-varying currents emit electromagnetic waves, which are used in telecommunications to broadcast information.

==Symbol==
The conventional symbol for current is , which originates from the French phrase , (current intensity). Current intensity is often referred to simply as &quot;current&quot;. The symbol was used by André-Marie Ampère, after whom the unit of electric current is named, in formulating Ampère&#x27;s force law (1820). The notation travelled from France to Great Britain, where it became standard, although at least one journal did not change from using to until 1896.

==Conventions==

The conventional direction of current, also known as &quot;conventional current&quot;, is arbitrarily defined as the direction in which charges flow. In a conductive material, the moving charged particles that constitute the electric current are called charge carriers. In metals, which make up the wires and other conductors in most electrical circuits, the positively charged atomic nuclei of the atoms are held in a fixed position, and the negatively charged electrons are the charge carriers, free to move about in the metal. In other materials, notably the semiconductors, the charge carriers can be positive &quot;or&quot; negative, depending on the dopant used. Positive and negative charge carriers may even be present at the same time, as happens in an electrolyte in an electrochemical cell.

A flow of positive charges gives the same electric current, and has the same effect in a circuit, as an equal flow of negative charges in the opposite direction. Since current can be the flow of either positive or negative charges, or both, a convention is needed for the direction of current that is independent of the type of charge carriers. Negatively charged carriers, such as the electrons (the charge carriers in metal wires and many other electronic circuit components), therefore flow in the opposite direction of conventional current flow in an electrical circuit.

===Reference direction===
A current in a wire or circuit element can flow in either of two directions. When defining a variable formula_1 to represent the current, the direction representing positive current must be specified, usually by an arrow on the circuit schematic diagram. This is called the &quot;reference direction&quot; of the current formula_1. When analyzing electrical circuits, the actual direction of current through a specific circuit element is usually unknown until the analysis is completed. Consequently, the reference directions of currents are often assigned arbitrarily. When the circuit is solved, a negative value for the current implies the actual direction of current through that circuit element is opposite that of the chosen reference direction.

==Ohm&#x27;s law==
Ohm&#x27;s law states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the potential difference across the two points. Introducing the constant of proportionality, the resistance, one arrives at the usual mathematical equation that describes this relationship:
formula_3

where &quot;I&quot; is the current through the conductor in units of amperes, &quot;V&quot; is the potential difference measured &quot;across&quot; the conductor in units of volts, and &quot;R&quot; is the resistance of the conductor in units of ohms. More specifically, Ohm&#x27;s law states that the &quot;R&quot; in this relation is constant, independent of the current.

==Alternating and direct current==
In alternating current (AC) systems, the movement of electric charge periodically reverses direction. AC is the form of electric power most commonly delivered to businesses and residences. The usual waveform of an AC power circuit is a sine wave, though certain applications use alternative waveforms, such as triangular or square waves. Audio and radio signals carried on electrical wires are also examples of alternating current. An important goal in these applications is recovery of information encoded (or &quot;modulated&quot;) onto the AC signal.

In contrast, direct current (DC) refers to a system in which the movement of electric charge in only one direction (sometimes called unidirectional flow). Direct current is produced by sources such as batteries, thermocouples, solar cells, and commutator-type electric machines of the dynamo type. Alternating current can also be converted to direct current through use of a rectifier. Direct current may flow in a conductor such as a wire, but can also flow through semiconductors, insulators, or even through a vacuum as in electron or ion beams. An old name for direct current was &quot;galvanic current&quot;.

==Occurrences==
Natural observable examples of electric current include lightning, static electric discharge, and the solar wind, the source of the polar auroras.

Man-made occurrences of electric current include the flow of conduction electrons in metal wires such as the overhead power lines that deliver electrical energy across long distances and the smaller wires within electrical and electronic equipment. Eddy currents are electric currents that occur in conductors exposed to changing magnetic fields. Similarly, electric currents occur, particularly in the surface, of conductors exposed to electromagnetic waves. When oscillating electric currents flow at the correct voltages within radio antennas, radio waves are generated.

In electronics, other forms of electric current include the flow of electrons through resistors or through the vacuum in a vacuum tube, the flow of ions inside a battery, and the flow of holes within metals and semiconductors. 

A biological example of current is the flow of ions in neurons and nerves, responsible for both thought and sensory perception.

==Measurement==
Current can be measured using an ammeter.

Electric current can be directly measured with a galvanometer, but this method involves breaking the electrical circuit, which is sometimes inconvenient. 

Current can also be measured without breaking the circuit by detecting the magnetic field associated with the current. 
Devices, at the circuit level, use various techniques to measure current:
* Shunt resistors
* Hall effect current sensor transducers
* Transformers (ac and changes or fluctuations in dc)
* Magnetoresistive field sensors
* Rogowski coils
* Current clamps

==Resistive heating==

Joule heating, also known as &quot;ohmic heating&quot; and &quot;resistive heating&quot;, is the process of power dissipation by which the passage of an electric current through a conductor increases the internal energy of the conductor, converting thermodynamic work into heat. The phenomenon was first studied by James Prescott Joule in 1841. Joule immersed a length of wire in a fixed mass of water and measured the temperature rise due to a known current through the wire for a 30 minute period. By varying the current and the length of the wire he deduced that the heat produced was proportional to the square of the current multiplied by the electrical resistance of the wire.

formula_4

This relationship is known as Joule&#x27;s Law. The SI unit of energy was subsequently named the joule and given the symbol &quot;J&quot;. The commonly known SI unit of power, the watt (symbol: W), is equivalent to one joule per second.

==Electromagnetism==

===Electromagnet===
In an electromagnet a coil of wires behaves like a magnet when an electric current flows through it. When the current is switched off, the coil loses its magnetism immediately.
Electric current produces a magnetic field. The magnetic field can be visualized as a pattern of circular field lines surrounding the wire that persists as long as there is current.

===Electromagnetic induction===
Magnetic fields can also be used to make electric currents. When a changing magnetic field is applied to a conductor, an electromotive force (EMF) is induced, which starts an electric current, when there is a suitable path.

===Radio waves===
When an electric current flows in a suitably shaped conductor at radio frequencies, radio waves can be generated. These travel at the speed of light and can cause electric currents in distant conductors.

==Conduction mechanisms in various media==

In metallic solids, electric charge flows by means of electrons, from lower to higher electrical potential. In other media, any stream of charged objects (ions, for example) may constitute an electric current. To provide a definition of current independent of the type of charge carriers, &quot;conventional current&quot; is defined as moving in the same direction as the positive charge flow. So, in metals where the charge carriers (electrons) are negative, conventional current is in the opposite direction to the overall electron movement. In conductors where the charge carriers are positive, conventional current is in the same direction as the charge carriers.

In a vacuum, a beam of ions or electrons may be formed. In other conductive materials, the electric current is due to the flow of both positively and negatively charged particles at the same time. In still others, the current is entirely due to positive charge flow. For example, the electric currents in electrolytes are flows of positively and negatively charged ions. In a common lead-acid electrochemical cell, electric currents are composed of positive hydronium ions flowing in one direction, and negative sulfate ions flowing in the other. Electric currents in sparks or plasma are flows of electrons as well as positive and negative ions. In ice and in certain solid electrolytes, the electric current is entirely composed of flowing ions.

=== Metals ===

In a metal, some of the outer electrons in each atom are not bound to the individual molecules as they are in molecular solids, or in full bands as they are in insulating materials, but are free to move within the metal lattice. These conduction electrons can serve as charge carriers, carrying a current. Metals are particularly conductive because there are many of these free electrons. With no external electric field applied, these electrons move about randomly due to thermal energy but, on average, there is zero net current within the metal. At room temperature, the average speed of these random motions is 106 metres per second. Given a surface through which a metal wire passes, electrons move in both directions across the surface at an equal rate. As George Gamow wrote in his popular science book, &quot;One, Two, Three...Infinity&quot; (1947), &quot;The metallic substances differ from all other materials by the fact that the outer shells of their atoms are bound rather loosely, and often let one of their electrons go free. Thus the interior of a metal is filled up with a large number of unattached electrons that travel aimlessly around like a crowd of displaced persons. When a metal wire is subjected to electric force applied on its opposite ends, these free electrons rush in the direction of the force, thus forming what we call an electric current.&quot;

When a metal wire is connected across the two terminals of a DC voltage source such as a battery, the source places an electric field across the conductor. The moment contact is made, the free electrons of the conductor are forced to drift toward the positive terminal under the influence of this field. The free electrons are therefore the charge carrier in a typical solid conductor.

For a steady flow of charge through a surface, the current &quot;I&quot; (in amperes) can be calculated with the following equation:
formula_5
where &quot;Q&quot; is the electric charge transferred through the surface over a time &quot;t&quot;. If &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;t&quot; are measured in coulombs and seconds respectively, &quot;I&quot; is in amperes.

More generally, electric current can be represented as the rate at which charge flows through a given surface as:
formula_6

===Electrolytes===

Electric currents in electrolytes are flows of electrically charged particles (ions). For example, if an electric field is placed across a solution of Na+ and Cl− (and conditions are right) the sodium ions move towards the negative electrode (cathode), while the chloride ions move towards the positive electrode (anode). Reactions take place at both electrode surfaces, neutralizing each ion.

Water-ice and certain solid electrolytes called &quot;proton conductors&quot; contain positive hydrogen ions (&quot;protons&quot;) that are mobile. In these materials, electric currents are composed of moving protons, as opposed to the moving electrons in metals.

In certain electrolyte mixtures, brightly coloured ions are the moving electric charges. The slow progress of the colour makes the current visible.

===Gases and plasmas===
In air and other ordinary gases below the breakdown field, the dominant source of electrical conduction is via relatively few mobile ions produced by radioactive gases, ultraviolet light, or cosmic rays. Since the electrical conductivity is low, gases are dielectrics or insulators. However, once the applied electric field approaches the breakdown value, free electrons become sufficiently accelerated by the electric field to create additional free electrons by colliding, and ionizing, neutral gas atoms or molecules in a process called avalanche breakdown. The breakdown process forms a plasma that contains enough mobile electrons and positive ions to make it an electrical conductor. In the process, it forms a light emitting conductive path, such as a spark, arc or lightning.

Plasma is the state of matter where some of the electrons in a gas are stripped or &quot;ionized&quot; from their molecules or atoms. A plasma can be formed by high temperature, or by application of a high electric or alternating magnetic field as noted above. Due to their lower mass, the electrons in a plasma accelerate more quickly in response to an electric field than the heavier positive ions, and hence carry the bulk of the current. The free ions recombine to create new chemical compounds (for example, breaking atmospheric oxygen into single oxygen [O2 → 2O], which then recombine creating ozone [O3]).

===Vacuum===
Since a &quot;perfect vacuum&quot; contains no charged particles, it normally behaves as a perfect insulator. However, metal electrode surfaces can cause a region of the vacuum to become conductive by injecting free electrons or ions through either field electron emission or thermionic emission. Thermionic emission occurs when the thermal energy exceeds the metal&#x27;s work function, while field electron emission occurs when the electric field at the surface of the metal is high enough to cause tunneling, which results in the ejection of free electrons from the metal into the vacuum. Externally heated electrodes are often used to generate an electron cloud as in the filament or indirectly heated cathode of vacuum tubes. Cold electrodes can also spontaneously produce electron clouds via thermionic emission when small incandescent regions (called &quot;cathode spots&quot; or &quot;anode spots&quot;) are formed. These are incandescent regions of the electrode surface that are created by a localized high current. These regions may be initiated by field electron emission, but are then sustained by localized thermionic emission once a vacuum arc forms. These small electron-emitting regions can form quite rapidly, even explosively, on a metal surface subjected to a high electrical field. Vacuum tubes and sprytrons are some of the electronic switching and amplifying devices based on vacuum conductivity.

===Superconductivity===
Superconductivity is a phenomenon of exactly zero electrical resistance and expulsion of magnetic fields occurring in certain materials when cooled below a characteristic critical temperature. It was discovered by Heike Kamerlingh Onnes on April 8, 1911 in Leiden. Like ferromagnetism and atomic spectral lines, superconductivity is a quantum mechanical phenomenon. It is characterized by the Meissner effect, the complete ejection of magnetic field lines from the interior of the superconductor as it transitions into the superconducting state. The occurrence of the Meissner effect indicates that superconductivity cannot be understood simply as the idealization of &quot;perfect conductivity&quot; in classical physics.

===Semiconductor===
In a semiconductor it is sometimes useful to think of the current as due to the flow of positive &quot;holes&quot; (the mobile positive charge carriers that are places where the semiconductor crystal is missing a valence electron). This is the case in a p-type semiconductor. A semiconductor has electrical conductivity intermediate in magnitude between that of a conductor and an insulator. This means a conductivity roughly in the range of 10−2 to 104 siemens per centimeter (S⋅cm−1).

In the classic crystalline semiconductors, electrons can have energies only within certain bands (i.e. ranges of levels of energy). Energetically, these bands are located between the energy of the ground state, the state in which electrons are tightly bound to the atomic nuclei of the material, and the free electron energy, the latter describing the energy required for an electron to escape entirely from the material. The energy bands each correspond to many discrete quantum states of the electrons, and most of the states with low energy (closer to the nucleus) are occupied, up to a particular band called the &quot;valence band&quot;. Semiconductors and insulators are distinguished from metals because the valence band in any given metal is nearly filled with electrons under usual operating conditions, while very few (semiconductor) or virtually none (insulator) of them are available in the &quot;conduction band&quot;, the band immediately above the valence band.

The ease of exciting electrons in the semiconductor from the valence band to the conduction band depends on the band gap between the bands. The size of this energy band gap serves as an arbitrary dividing line (roughly 4 eV) between semiconductors and insulators.

With covalent bonds, an electron moves by hopping to a neighboring bond. The Pauli exclusion principle requires that the electron be lifted into the higher anti-bonding state of that bond. For delocalized states, for example in one dimensionthat is in a nanowire, for every energy there is a state with electrons flowing in one direction and another state with the electrons flowing in the other. For a net current to flow, more states for one direction than for the other direction must be occupied. For this to occur, energy is required, as in the semiconductor the next higher states lie above the band gap. Often this is stated as: full bands do not contribute to the electrical conductivity. However, as a semiconductor&#x27;s temperature rises above absolute zero, there is more energy in the semiconductor to spend on lattice vibration and on exciting electrons into the conduction band. The current-carrying electrons in the conduction band are known as &quot;free electrons&quot;, though they are often simply called &quot;electrons&quot; if that is clear in context.

==Current density and Ohm&#x27;s law==

Current density is the rate at which charge passes through a chosen unit area. It is defined as a vector whose magnitude is the current per unit cross-sectional area. As discussed in Reference direction, the direction is arbitrary. Conventionally, if the moving charges are positive, then the current density has the same sign as the velocity of the charges. For negative charges, the sign of the current density is opposite to the velocity of the charges. In SI units, current density (symbol: j) is expressed in the SI base units of amperes per square metre.

In linear materials such as metals, and under low frequencies, the current density across the conductor surface is uniform. In such conditions, Ohm&#x27;s law states that the current is directly proportional to the potential difference between two ends (across) of that metal (ideal) resistor (or other ohmic device):
formula_7

where formula_1 is the current, measured in amperes; formula_9 is the potential difference, measured in volts; and formula_10 is the resistance, measured in ohms. For alternating currents, especially at higher frequencies, skin effect causes the current to spread unevenly across the conductor cross-section, with higher density near the surface, thus increasing the apparent resistance.

==Drift speed==
The mobile charged particles within a conductor move constantly in random directions, like the particles of a gas. (More accurately, a Fermi gas.) To create a net flow of charge, the particles must also move together with an average drift rate. Electrons are the charge carriers in most metals and they follow an erratic path, bouncing from atom to atom, but generally drifting in the opposite direction of the electric field. The speed they drift at can be calculated from the equation:
formula_11
where
* formula_1 is the electric current
* formula_13 is number of charged particles per unit volume (or charge carrier density)
* formula_14 is the cross-sectional area of the conductor
* formula_15 is the drift velocity, and
* formula_16 is the charge on each particle.
Typically, electric charges in solids flow slowly. For example, in a copper wire of cross-section 0.5 mm2, carrying a current of 5 A, the drift velocity of the electrons is on the order of a millimetre per second. To take a different example, in the near-vacuum inside a cathode-ray tube, the electrons travel in near-straight lines at about a tenth of the speed of light.

Any accelerating electric charge, and therefore any changing electric current, gives rise to an electromagnetic wave that propagates at very high speed outside the surface of the conductor. This speed is usually a significant fraction of the speed of light, as can be deduced from Maxwell&#x27;s equations, and is therefore many times faster than the drift velocity of the electrons. For example, in AC power lines, the waves of electromagnetic energy propagate through the space between the wires, moving from a source to a distant load, even though the electrons in the wires only move back and forth over a tiny distance.

The ratio of the speed of the electromagnetic wave to the speed of light in free space is called the velocity factor, and depends on the electromagnetic properties of the conductor and the insulating materials surrounding it, and on their shape and size.

The magnitudes (not the natures) of these three velocities can be illustrated by an analogy with the three similar velocities associated with gases. (See also hydraulic analogy.)
* The low drift velocity of charge carriers is analogous to air motion; in other words, winds.
* The high speed of electromagnetic waves is roughly analogous to the speed of sound in a gas (sound waves move through air much faster than large-scale motions such as convection)
* The random motion of charges is analogous to heatthe thermal velocity of randomly vibrating gas particles.

<text>Charles Ancillon (28 July 16595 July 1715) was a French jurist and diplomat.

==Life==
Ancillon was born in Metz into a distinguished family of Huguenots. His father, David Ancillon (1617–1692), was obliged to leave France on the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, and became pastor of the French Protestant community in Berlin.

Ancillon studied law at Marburg, Geneva and Paris, where he was called to the bar. At the request of the Huguenots at Metz, he pleaded its cause at the court of King Louis XIV, urging that it should be excepted in the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, but his efforts were unsuccessful, and he joined his father in Berlin. He was at once appointed by Elector Frederick III &quot;&quot;juge et directeur de colonie de Berlin&quot;.&quot; He also became the first headmaster of Französisches Gymnasium Berlin. Before this, he had published several works on the revocation of the Edict of Nantes and its consequences, but his literary capacity was mediocre, his style stiff and cold, and it was his personal character rather than his reputation as a writer that earned him the confidence of the elector.

In 1687 Ancillon was appointed head of the so-called &quot;Academie des nobles,&quot; the principal educational establishment of the state; later on, as councillor of embassy, he took part in the negotiations which led to the assumption of the title of &quot;King in Prussia&quot; by the elector. In 1699 he succeeded Samuel Pufendorf as historiographer to the elector, and the same year replaced his uncle Joseph Ancillon as judge of all the French refugees in the Margraviate of Brandenburg.

Ancillon is mainly remembered for what he did for education in Brandenburg-Prussia, and the share he took, in co-operation with Gottfried Leibniz, in founding the Academy of Berlin. Of his fairly numerous works the most valued is the &quot;Histoire de l&#x27;etablissement des Francais refugies dans les etats de Brandebourg&quot; published in Berlin in 1690.

<doc id="6210" wikidata="Q555298" url="?curid=6210" title="Clark Ashton Smith">
<text>Clark Ashton Smith (January 13, 1893 – August 14, 1961) was an influential American writer of fantasy, horror, and science fiction stories and poetry, and an artist. He achieved early recognition in California (largely through the enthusiasm of George Sterling) for traditional verse in the vein of Swinburne. As a poet, Smith is grouped with the West Coast Romantics alongside Joaquin Miller, Sterling, and Nora May French and remembered as &quot;The Last of the Great Romantics&quot; and &quot;The Bard of Auburn&quot;. Smith&#x27;s work was praised by his contemporaries. H. P. Lovecraft stated that &quot;in sheer daemonic strangeness and fertility of conception, Clark Ashton Smith is perhaps unexcelled&quot;, and Ray Bradbury said that Smith &quot;filled my mind with incredible worlds, impossibly beautiful cities, and still more fantastic creatures&quot;. Additional writers influenced by Smith include Leigh Brackett, Harlan Ellison, Stephen King, Fritz Lieber, George R. R. Martin, and Donald Sidney-Fryer.

Smith was one of &quot;the big three of &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, with Robert E. Howard and H. P. Lovecraft&quot;, though some readers objected to his morbidness and violation of pulp traditions. The fantasy writer and critic L. Sprague de Camp said of him that &quot;nobody since Poe has so loved a well-rotted corpse&quot;. Smith was a member of the Lovecraft circle, and his literary friendship with Lovecraft lasted from 1922 until Lovecraft&#x27;s death in 1937. His work is marked by an extraordinarily rich and ornate vocabulary, a cosmic perspective and a vein of sardonic and sometimes ribald humor.

Of his writing style, Smith stated: &quot;My own conscious ideal has been to delude the reader into accepting an impossibility, or series of impossibilities, by means of a sort of verbal black magic, in the achievement of which I make use of prose-rhythm, metaphor, simile, tone-color, counter-point, and other stylistic resources, like a sort of incantation.&quot;

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Smith was born January 13, 1893, in Long Valley, Placer County, California, into a family of English and New England heritage. He spent most of his life in the small town of Auburn, California, living in a cabin built by his parents, Fanny and Timeus Smith. Smith professed to hate the town&#x27;s provincialism but rarely left it until he married late in life.

His formal education was limited: he suffered from psychological disorders including intense agoraphobia, and although he was accepted to high school after attending eight years of grammar school, his parents decided it was better for him to be taught at home. An insatiable reader with an extraordinary eidetic memory, Smith appeared to retain most or all of whatever he read. After leaving formal education, he embarked upon a self-directed course of literature, including &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;, &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;, the fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen and Madame d&#x27;Aulnoy, the &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; and the poems of Edgar Allan Poe. He read an unabridged dictionary word for word, studying not only the definitions of the words but also their etymology.

The other main course in Smith&#x27;s self-education was to read the complete 11th edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; at least twice. Smith later taught himself French and Spanish to translate verse out of those languages, including works by Gérard de Nerval, Paul Verlaine, Amado Nervo, Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer and all but 6 of Charles Baudelaire&#x27;s 157 poems in &quot;The Flowers of Evil&quot;.

===Early writing ===

His first literary efforts, at the age of 11, took the form of fairy tales and imitations of the Arabian Nights. Later, he wrote long adventure novels dealing with Oriental life. By 14 he had already written a short adventure novel called &quot;The Black Diamonds&quot; which was lost for years until published in 2002. Another juvenile novel was written in his teenaged years: &quot;The Sword of Zagan&quot; (unpublished until 2004). Like &quot;The Black Diamonds&quot;, it uses a medieval, &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;-like setting, and the &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;, like the fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm and the works of Edgar Allan Poe, are known to have strongly influenced Smith&#x27;s early writing, as did William Beckford&#x27;s &quot;Vathek&quot;.

When he was 15, Smith read George Sterling&#x27;s fantasy-horror poem &quot;A Wine of Wizardry&quot; in a national magazine (which he later described as &quot;In the ruck of magazine verse it was like finding a fire-opal of the Titans in a potato bin&quot;) and decided he wanted to become a poet. At age 17, he sold several tales to &quot;The Black Cat&quot;, a magazine which specialized in unusual tales. He also published some tales in the &quot;Overland Monthly&quot; in this brief foray into fiction which preceded his poetic career.

However, it was primarily poetry that motivated the young Smith and he confined his efforts to poetry for more than a decade. In his later youth, Smith met Sterling through a member of the local Auburn Monday Night Club, where Smith read several of his poems with considerable success. On a month-long visit to Sterling in Carmel, California, Smith was introduced by Sterling to the poetry of Charles Baudelaire.

He became Sterling&#x27;s protégé and Sterling helped him to publish his first volume of poems, &quot;The Star-Treader and Other Poems&quot;, at the age of 19. Smith received international acclaim for the collection. &quot;The Star-Treader&quot; was received very favorably by American critics, one of whom named Smith &quot;the Keats of the Pacific&quot;. Smith briefly moved among the circle that included Ambrose Bierce and Jack London, but his early fame soon faded away.

===Health breakdown period===
A little later, Smith&#x27;s health broke down and for eight years his literary production was intermittent, though he produced his best poetry during this period. A small volume, &quot;Odes and Sonnets&quot;, was brought out in 1918. Smith came into contact with literary figures who would later form part of H.P. Lovecraft&#x27;s circle of correspondents; Smith knew them far earlier than Lovecraft. These figures include poet Samuel Loveman and bookman George Kirk. It was Smith who in fact later introduced Donald Wandrei to Lovecraft. For this reason, it has been suggested that Lovecraft might as well be referred to as a member of a &quot;Smith&quot; circle as Smith was a member of a Lovecraft one.

In 1920 Smith composed a celebrated long poem in blank verse, &quot;The Hashish Eater, or The Apocalypse of Evil&quot;, published in &quot;Ebony and Crystal&quot; (1922). This was followed by a fan letter from H. P. Lovecraft, which was the beginning of 15 years of friendship and correspondence. With studied playfulness, Smith and Lovecraft borrowed each other&#x27;s coinages of place names and the names of strange gods for their stories, though so different is Smith&#x27;s treatment of the Lovecraft theme that it has been dubbed the &quot;Clark Ashton Smythos.&quot;

In 1925 Smith published &quot;Sandalwood&quot;, which was partly funded by a gift of $50 from Donald Wandrei. He wrote little fiction in this period with the exception of some imaginative vignettes or prose poems. Smith was poor for most of his life and often did hard manual jobs such as fruit picking and woodcutting to support himself and his parents. He was an able cook and made many kinds of wine. He also did well digging, typing and journalism, as well as contributing a column to &quot;The Auburn Journal&quot; and sometimes worked as its night editor.

One of Smith&#x27;s artistic patrons and frequent correspondents was San Francisco businessman Albert Bender.

===Prolific fiction-writing period===
At the beginning of the Depression in 1929, with his aged parents&#x27; health weakening, Smith resumed fiction writing and turned out more than a hundred short stories between 1929 and 1934, nearly all of which can be classed as weird horror or science fiction. Like Lovecraft, he drew upon the nightmares that had plagued him during youthful spells of sickness. Brian Stableford has written that the stories written during this brief phase of hectic productivity &quot;constitute one of the most remarkable oeuvres in imaginative literature&quot;.

He published at his own expense a volume containing six of his best stories, &quot;The Double Shadow and Other Fantasies&quot;, in an edition of 1000 copies printed by the &quot;Auburn Journal&quot;. The theme of much of his work is egotism and its supernatural punishment; his weird fiction is generally macabre in subject matter, gloatingly preoccupied with images of death, decay and abnormality.

Most of Smith&#x27;s weird fiction falls into four series set variously in Hyperborea, Poseidonis, Averoigne and Zothique. Hyperborea, which is a lost continent of the Miocene period, and Poseidonis, which is a remnant of Atlantis, are much the same, with a magical culture characterized by bizarreness, cruelty, death and postmortem horrors. Averoigne is Smith&#x27;s version of pre-modern France, comparable to James Branch Cabell&#x27;s Poictesme. Zothique exists millions of years in the future. It is &quot;the last continent of earth, when the sun is dim and tarnished&quot;. These tales have been compared to the &quot;Dying Earth&quot; sequence of Jack Vance.

In 1933 Smith began corresponding with Robert E. Howard, the Texan creator of Conan the Barbarian. From 1933 to 1936, Smith, Howard and Lovecraft were the leaders of the Weird Tales school of fiction and corresponded frequently, although they never met. The writer of oriental fantasies E. Hoffmann Price is the only man known to have met all three in the flesh.

Critic Steve Behrends has suggested that the frequent theme of &#x27;loss&#x27; in Smith&#x27;s fiction (many of his characters attempt to recapture a long-vanished youth, early love, or picturesque past) may reflect Smith&#x27;s own feeling that his career had suffered a &quot;fall from grace&quot;:
===Mid-late career: return to poetry and sculpture===
In September 1935, Smith&#x27;s mother Fanny died. Smith spent the next two years nursing his father through his last illness. Timeus died in December 1937. Aged 44, Smith now virtually ceased writing fiction. He had been severely affected by several tragedies occurring in a short period of time: Robert E. Howard&#x27;s death by suicide (1936), Lovecraft&#x27;s death from cancer (1937) and the deaths of his parents, which left him exhausted. As a result, he withdrew from the scene, marking the end of &quot;Weird Tales&quot;″s Golden Age. He began sculpting and resumed the writing of poetry. However, Smith was visited by many writers at his cabin, including Fritz Leiber, Rah Hoffman, Francis T. Laney and others.

In 1942, three years after August Derleth founded Arkham House for the purpose of preserving the work of H.P. Lovecraft, Derleth published the first of several major collections of Smith&#x27;s fiction, &quot;Out of Space and Time&quot; (1942). This was followed by &quot;Lost Worlds&quot; (1944). The books sold slowly, went out of print and became costly rarities. Derleth published five more volumes of Smith&#x27;s prose and two of his verse, and at his death in 1971 had a large volume of Smith&#x27;s poems in press.

===Later life, marriage and death===
In 1953, Smith suffered a coronary attack. Aged 61, he married Carol(yn) Jones Dorman on November 10, 1954. Dorman had much experience in Hollywood and radio public relations. After honeymooning at the Smith cabin, they moved to Pacific Grove, California, where he set up a household including her three children from a previous marriage. For several years he alternated between the house on Indian Ridge and their house in Pacific Grove. Smith having sold most of his father&#x27;s tract, in 1957 the old house burned – the Smiths believed by arson, others said by accident.

Smith now reluctantly did gardening for other residents at Pacific Grove, and grew a goatee. He spent much time shopping and walking near the seafront but despite Derleth&#x27;s badgering, resisted the writing of more fiction. In 1961 he suffered a series of strokes and in August 1961 he quietly died in his sleep, aged 68. After Smith&#x27;s death, Carol remarried (becoming Carolyn Wakefield) and subsequently died of cancer.

The poet&#x27;s ashes were buried beside, or beneath, a boulder to the immediate west of where his childhood home (destroyed by fire in 1957) stood; some were also scattered in a stand of blue oaks near the boulder. There was no marker. Plaques recognizing Smith have been erected at the Auburn Placer County Library in 1985 and in Bicentennial Park in Auburn in 2003.

Bookseller Roy A. Squires was appointed Smith&#x27;s &quot;west coast executor&quot;, with Jack L. Chalker as his &quot;east coast executor&quot;. Squires published many letterpress editions of individual Smith poems.

Smith&#x27;s literary estate is represented by his stepson, Prof William Dorman, director of CASiana Literary Enterprises. Arkham House owns the copyright to many Smith stories, though some are now in the public domain.

==Artistic periods==
While Smith was always an artist who worked in several very different media, it is possible to identify three distinct periods in which one form of art had precedence over the others.

===Poetry: until 1925===
Smith published most of his volumes of poetry in this period, including the aforementioned &quot;The Star-Treader and Other Poems&quot;, as well as &quot;Odes and Sonnets&quot; (1918), &quot;Ebony and Crystal&quot; (1922) and &quot;Sandalwood&quot; (1925). His long poem &quot;The Hashish-Eater; Or, the Apocalypse of Evil&quot; was written in 1920.

===Weird fiction: 1926–1935===

Smith wrote most of his weird fiction and Cthulhu Mythos stories, inspired by H. P. Lovecraft. Creatures of his invention include Aforgomon, Rlim-Shaikorth, Mordiggian, Tsathoggua, the wizard Eibon, and various others. In an homage to his friend, Lovecraft referred in &quot;The Whisperer in Darkness&quot; and &quot;The Battle That Ended the Century&quot; (written in collaboration with R. H. Barlow) to an Atlantean high-priest, &quot;Klarkash-Ton&quot;.

Smith&#x27;s weird stories form several cycles, called after the lands in which they are set: Averoigne, Hyperborea, Mars, Poseidonis, Zothique. To some extent Smith was influenced in his vision of such lost worlds by the teachings of Theosophy and the writings of Helena Blavatsky. Stories set in Zothique belong to the Dying Earth subgenre. Amongst Smith&#x27;s science fiction tales are stories set on Mars and the invented planet of Xiccarph.

His short stories originally appeared in the magazines &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, &quot;Strange Tales&quot;, &quot;Astounding Stories&quot;, &quot;Stirring Science Stories&quot; and &quot;Wonder Stories&quot;.

Clark Ashton Smith was the third member of the great triumvirate of &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, with Lovecraft and Robert E. Howard.

Many of Smith&#x27;s stories were published in six hardcover volumes by August Derleth under his Arkham House imprint. For a full bibliography to 1978, see Sidney-Fryer, &quot;Emperor of Dreams&quot; (cited below). S. T. Joshi is working with other scholars to produce an updated bibliography of Smith&#x27;s work.

===Audio===
* &quot;Clark Ashton Smith: Live from Auburn: The Elder Tapes&quot;. In the late 1950s Smith recorded a number of his poems on the tape-recorder of his friend Robert B. Elder. Elder chose the 11 poems at random from Smith&#x27;s books &quot;The Dark Chateau&quot; and &quot;Spells and Philtres&quot;. (Elder had first met Smith when reporting on his 1954 wedding to the former Carol Dorman for &quot;The Auburn Courier&quot; and they became friends when Smith praised Elder&#x27;s novel &quot;Whom the Gods Destroy&quot;.) In 1995 Necronomicon Press released the audiocassette &quot;Clark Ashton Smith: Live from Auburn: The Elder Tapes&quot;, which includes an introduction by Elder and then Smith reading his poems. The recording was produced by Wayne Haigh. The cassette was accompanied by a booklet featuring a c.1960 photo of Smith and reprints all 11 poems. Gahan Wilson provided the cover art for the cassette and booklet. The recording has not been released on CD.

<text>A context-sensitive grammar (CSG) is a formal grammar in which the left-hand sides and right-hand sides of any production rules may be surrounded by a context of terminal and nonterminal symbols. Context-sensitive grammars are more general than context-free grammars, in the sense that there are languages that can be described by a CSG but not by a context-free grammar. Context-sensitive grammars are less general (in the same sense) than unrestricted grammars. Thus, CSGs are positioned between context-free and unrestricted grammars in the Chomsky hierarchy.

A formal language that can be described by a context-sensitive grammar, or, equivalently, by a noncontracting grammar or a linear bounded automaton, is called a context-sensitive language. Some textbooks actually define CSGs as non-contracting, although this is not how Noam Chomsky defined them in 1959. This choice of definition makes no difference in terms of the languages generated (i.e. the two definitions are weakly equivalent), but it does make a difference in terms of what grammars are structurally considered context-sensitive; the latter issue was analyzed by Chomsky in 1963.

Chomsky introduced context-sensitive grammars as a way to describe the syntax of natural language where it is often the case that a word may or may not be appropriate in a certain place depending on the context. Walter Savitch has criticized the terminology &quot;context-sensitive&quot; as misleading and proposed &quot;non-erasing&quot; as better explaining the distinction between a CSG and an unrestricted grammar.

Although it is well known that certain features of languages (e.g. cross-serial dependency) are not context-free, it is an open question how much of CSGs&#x27; expressive power is needed to capture the context sensitivity found in natural languages. Subsequent research in this area has focused on the more computationally tractable mildly context-sensitive languages. The syntaxes of some visual programming languages can be described by context-sensitive graph grammars.

==Formal definition==

=== Formal grammar ===
Let us notate a formal grammar as formula_1, with formula_2 a set of nonterminal symbols, formula_3 a set of terminal symbols, formula_4 a set of production rules, and formula_5 the start symbol.

A string formula_6 &quot;directly yields&quot;, or &quot;directly derives to&quot;, a string formula_7, denoted as formula_8, if &quot;v&quot; can be obtained from &quot;u&quot; by an application of some production rule in &quot;P&quot;, that is, if formula_9 and formula_10, where formula_11 is a production rule, and formula_12 is the unaffected left and right part of the string, respectively.
More generally, &quot;u&quot; is said to &quot;yield&quot;, or &quot;derive to&quot;, &quot;v&quot;, denoted as formula_13, if &quot;v&quot; can be obtained from &quot;u&quot; by repeated application of production rules, that is, if formula_14 for some &quot;n&quot; ≥ 0 and some strings formula_15. In other words, the relation formula_16 is the reflexive transitive closure of the relation formula_17.

The language of the grammar &quot;G&quot; is the set of all terminal-symbol strings derivable from its start symbol, formally: formula_18.
Derivations that do not end in a string composed of terminal symbols only are possible, but do not contribute to &quot;L&quot;(&quot;G&quot;).

=== Context-sensitive grammar ===
A formal grammar is context-sensitive if each rule in &quot;P&quot; is either of the form formula_19 where formula_20 is the empty string, or of the form
: α&quot;A&quot;β → αγβ
with &quot;A&quot; ∈ &quot;N&quot;, formula_21, and formula_22.

The name &quot;context-sensitive&quot; is explained by the α and β that form the context of &quot;A&quot; and determine whether &quot;A&quot; can be replaced with γ or not.
By contrast, in a context-free grammar, no context is present: the left hand side of every production rule is just a nonterminal.

The string γ is not allowed to be empty. Without this restriction, the resulting grammars become equal in power to unrestricted grammars.

=== (Weakly) equivalent definitions ===
A noncontracting grammar is a grammar in which for any production rule, of the form &quot;u&quot; → &quot;v&quot;, the length of &quot;u&quot; is less than or equal to the length of &quot;v&quot;.

Every context-sensitive grammar is noncontracting, while every noncontracting grammar can be converted into an equivalent context-sensitive grammar; the two classes are weakly equivalent.

Some authors use the term &quot;context-sensitive grammar&quot; to refer to noncontracting grammars in general.

The left-context- and right-context-sensitive grammars are defined by restricting the rules to just the form α&quot;A&quot; → αγ and to just &quot;A&quot;β → γβ, respectively. The languages generated by these grammars are also the full class of context-sensitive languages. The equivalence was established by Penttonen normal form.

== Examples ==
=== &quot;anbncn&quot; ===
The following context-sensitive grammar, with start symbol &quot;S&quot;, generates the canonical non-context-free language { &quot;anbncn&quot; | &quot;n&quot; ≥ 1 } :


Rules 1 and 2 allow for blowing-up &quot;S&quot; to &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;&quot;BC&quot;(&quot;BC&quot;)&quot;n&quot;−1; rules 3 to 6 allow for successively exchanging each &quot;CB&quot; to &quot;BC&quot; (four rules are needed for that since a rule &quot;CB&quot; → &quot;BC&quot; wouldn&#x27;t fit into the scheme α&quot;A&quot;β → αγβ); rules 7–10 allow replacing a non-terminal &quot;B&quot; or &quot;C&quot; with its corresponding terminal &quot;b&quot; or &quot;c&quot;, respectively, provided it is in the right place.
A generation chain for &quot;&quot; is:
: &quot;S&quot;
: →2 
: →2 
: →1 
: →3 
: →4 
: →5 
: →6 
: →3 
: →4 
: →5 
: →6 
: →3 
: →4 
: →5 
: →6 
: →7 
: →8 
: →8 
: →9 
: →10 
: →10 

=== &quot;anbncndn&quot;, etc. ===
More complicated grammars can be used to parse { &quot;anbncndn&quot; | &quot;n&quot; ≥ 1 }, and other languages with even more letters. Here we show a simpler approach using non-contracting grammars:
Start with a kernel of regular productions generating the sentential forms
formula_23 and then include the non contracting productions
formula_24,
formula_25,
formula_26,
formula_27,
formula_28,
formula_29,
formula_30,
formula_31,
formula_32,
formula_33.

=== &quot;ambncmdn&quot; ===
A non contracting grammar (for which there is an equivalent CSG) for the language formula_34 is defined by
:formula_35,
:formula_36,
:formula_37,
:formula_38,
:formula_39, 
:formula_40, 
:formula_41, and
:formula_42.

With these definitions, a derivation for formula_43 is:
formula_44.

=== &quot;a&quot;2&quot;i&quot; ===
A noncontracting grammar for the language { &quot;a&quot;2&quot;i&quot; | &quot;i&quot; ≥ 1 } is constructed in Example 9.5 (p. 224) of (Hopcroft, Ullman, 1979):

# formula_45
# formula_46
# formula_47
# formula_48
# formula_49
# formula_50
# formula_51
# formula_52

== Kuroda normal form ==
Every context-sensitive grammar which does not generate the empty string can be transformed into a weakly equivalent one in Kuroda normal form. &quot;Weakly equivalent&quot; here means that the two grammars generate the same language. The normal form will not in general be context-sensitive, but will be a noncontracting grammar.

The Kuroda normal form is an actual normal form for non-contracting grammars.

== Properties and uses ==

=== Equivalence to linear bounded automaton ===
A formal language can be described by a context-sensitive grammar if and only if it is accepted by some linear bounded automaton (LBA). In some textbooks this result is attributed solely to Landweber and Kuroda. Others call it the Myhill–Landweber–Kuroda theorem. (Myhill introduced the concept of deterministic LBA in 1960. Peter S. Landweber published in 1963 that the language accepted by a deterministic LBA is context sensitive. Kuroda introduced the notion of non-deterministic LBA and the equivalence between LBA and CSGs in 1964.)

 it is still an open question whether every context-sensitive language can be accepted by a &quot;deterministic&quot; LBA.

=== Closure properties ===
Context-sensitive languages are closed under complement. This 1988 result is known as the Immerman–Szelepcsényi theorem.
Moreover, they are closed under union, intersection, concatenation, substitution, inverse homomorphism, and Kleene plus.

Every recursively enumerable language &quot;L&quot; can be written as &quot;h&quot;(&quot;L&quot;) for some context-sensitive language &quot;L&quot; and some string homomorphism &quot;h&quot;.

=== Computational problems ===
The decision problem that asks whether a certain string &quot;s&quot; belongs to the language of a given context-sensitive grammar &quot;G&quot;, is PSPACE-complete. Moreover, there are context-sensitive grammars whose languages are PSPACE-complete. In other words, there is a context-sensitive grammar &quot;G&quot; such that deciding whether a certain string &quot;s&quot; belongs to the language of &quot;G&quot; is PSPACE-complete (so &quot;G&quot; is fixed and only &quot;s&quot; is part of the input of the problem).

The emptiness problem for context-sensitive grammars (given a context-sensitive grammar &quot;G&quot;, is &quot;L&quot;(&quot;G&quot;)=∅ ?) is undecidable.

=== As model of natural languages ===
Savitch has proven the following theoretical result, on which he bases his criticism of CSGs as basis for natural language: for any recursively enumerable set &quot;R&quot;, there exists a context-sensitive language/grammar &quot;G&quot; which can be used as a sort of proxy to test membership in &quot;R&quot; in the following way: given a string &quot;s&quot;, &quot;s&quot; is in &quot;R&quot; if and only if there exists a positive integer &quot;n&quot; for which &quot;scn&quot; is in G, where &quot;c&quot; is an arbitrary symbol not part of &quot;R&quot;.

It has been shown that nearly all natural languages may in general be characterized by context-sensitive grammars, but the whole class of CSGs seems to be much bigger than natural languages. Worse yet, since the aforementioned decision problem for CSGs is PSPACE-complete, that makes them totally unworkable for practical use, as a polynomial-time algorithm for a PSPACE-complete problem would imply P=NP.

It was proven that some natural languages are not context-free, based on identifying so-called cross-serial dependencies and unbounded scrambling phenomena. However this does not necessarily imply that the class of CSGs is necessary to capture &quot;context sensitivity&quot; in the colloquial sense of these terms in natural languages. For example, linear context-free rewriting systems (LCFRSs) are strictly weaker than CSGs but can account for the phenomenon of cross-serial dependencies; one can write a LCFRS grammar for {&quot;anbncndn&quot; | &quot;n&quot; ≥ 1} for example.

Ongoing research on computational linguistics has focused on formulating other classes of languages that are &quot;mildly context-sensitive&quot; whose decision problems are feasible, such as tree-adjoining grammars, combinatory categorial grammars, coupled context-free languages, and linear context-free rewriting systems. The languages generated by these formalisms properly lie between the context-free and context-sensitive languages.

More recently, the class PTIME has been identified with range concatenation grammars, which are now considered to be the most expressive of the mild-context sensitive language classes.

<text>In formal language theory, a context-sensitive language is a language that can be defined by a context-sensitive grammar (and equivalently by a noncontracting grammar). Context-sensitive is known as type-1 in the Chomsky hierarchy of formal languages.

== Computational properties ==

Computationally, a context-sensitive language is equivalent to a linear bounded nondeterministic Turing machine, also called a linear bounded automaton. That is a non-deterministic Turing machine with a tape of only formula_1 cells, where formula_2 is the size of the input and formula_3 is a constant associated with the machine. This means that every formal language that can be decided by such a machine is a context-sensitive language, and every context-sensitive language can be decided by such a machine.

This set of languages is also known as NLINSPACE or NSPACE(&quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)), because they can be accepted using linear space on a non-deterministic Turing machine. The class LINSPACE (or DSPACE(&quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;))) is defined the same, except using a deterministic Turing machine. Clearly LINSPACE is a subset of NLINSPACE, but it is not known whether LINSPACE = NLINSPACE.

== Examples ==

One of the simplest context-sensitive but not context-free languages is formula_4: the language of all strings consisting of occurrences of the symbol &quot;a&quot;, then &quot;b&quot;s, then &quot;c&quot;s (abc, , , etc.). A superset of this language, called the Bach language, is defined as the set of all strings where &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot; (or any other set of three symbols) occurs equally often (, , etc.) and is also context-sensitive.

 can be shown to be a context-sensitive language by constructing a linear bounded automaton which accepts . The language can easily be shown to be neither regular nor context-free by applying the respective pumping lemmas for each of the language classes to .

Similarly:
formula_5 is another context-sensitive language; the corresponding context-sensitive grammar can be easily projected starting with two context-free grammars generating sentential forms in the formats
formula_6
and
formula_7
and then supplementing them with a permutation production like 
formula_8, a new starting symbol and standard syntactic sugar.

formula_9 is another context-sensitive language (the &quot;3&quot; in the name of this language is intended to mean a ternary alphabet); that is, the &quot;product&quot; operation defines a context-sensitive language (but the &quot;sum&quot; defines only a context-free language as the grammar formula_10 and formula_11 shows). Because of the commutative property of the product, the most intuitive grammar for formula_12 is ambiguous. This problem can be avoided considering a somehow more restrictive definition of the language, e.g. formula_13. This can be specialized to 
formula_14 and, from this, to formula_15, formula_16, etc.

formula_17 is a context-sensitive language. The corresponding context-sensitive grammar can be obtained as a generalization of the context-sensitive grammars for formula_18, formula_19, etc.

formula_20 is a context-sensitive language.

formula_21 is a context-sensitive language (the &quot;2&quot; in the name of this language is intended to mean a binary alphabet). This was proved by Hartmanis using pumping lemmas for regular and context-free languages over a binary alphabet and, after that, sketching a linear bounded multitape automaton accepting formula_22.

formula_23 is a context-sensitive language (the &quot;1&quot; in the name of this language is intended to mean a unary alphabet). This was credited by A. Salomaa to Matti Soittola by means of a linear bounded automaton over a unary alphabet (pages 213-214, exercise 6.8) and also to Marti Penttonen by means of a context-sensitive grammar also over a unary alphabet (See: Formal Languages by A. Salomaa, page 14, Example 2.5).

An example of recursive language that is not context-sensitive is any recursive language whose decision is an EXPSPACE-hard problem, say, the set of pairs of equivalent regular expressions with exponentiation.

== Properties of context-sensitive languages ==

* The union, intersection, concatenation of two context-sensitive languages is context-sensitive, also the Kleene plus of a context-sensitive language is context-sensitive.
* The complement of a context-sensitive language is itself context-sensitive a result known as the Immerman–Szelepcsényi theorem.
* Membership of a string in a language defined by an arbitrary context-sensitive grammar, or by an arbitrary deterministic context-sensitive grammar, is a PSPACE-complete problem.

<doc id="6216" wikidata="Q304726" url="?curid=6216" title="Chinese room">
<text>The Chinese room argument holds that a computer executing a program cannot have a mind, understanding, or consciousness, regardless of how intelligently or human-like the program may make the computer behave. The argument was presented in a 1980 paper by the philosopher John Searle entitled &quot;Minds, Brains, and Programs&quot; and published in the journal &quot;Behavioral and Brain Sciences&quot;. Before Searle, similar arguments had been presented by figures including Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1714), Anatoly Dneprov (1961), Lawrence Davis (1974) and Ned Block (1978). Searle&#x27;s version has been widely discussed in the years since. The centerpiece of Searle&#x27;s argument is a thought experiment known as the Chinese room.

The thought experiment starts by placing a computer that can perfectly converse in Chinese in one room, and a human that only knows English in another, with a door separating them. Chinese characters are written and placed on a piece of paper underneath the door, and the computer can reply fluently, slipping the reply underneath the door. The human is then given English instructions which replicate the instructions and function of the computer program to converse in Chinese. The human follows the instructions and the two rooms can perfectly communicate in Chinese, but the human still does not actually understand the characters, merely following instructions to converse. Searle states that both the computer and human are doing identical tasks, following instructions without truly understanding or &quot;thinking&quot;.

The argument is directed against the philosophical positions of functionalism and computationalism, which hold that the mind may be viewed as an information-processing system operating on formal symbols, and that simulation of a given mental state is sufficient for its presence. Specifically, the argument is intended to refute a position Searle calls the strong AI hypothesis: &quot;The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.&quot;

Although its proponents originally presented the argument in reaction to statements of artificial intelligence (AI) researchers, it is not an argument against the goals of mainstream AI research because it does not show a limit in the amount of intelligent behavior a machine can display. The argument applies only to digital computers running programs and does not apply to machines in general. While widely discussed, the argument has been subject to significant criticism and remains controversial among philosophers of mind and AI researchers.

==Searle&#x27;s thought experiment==
Suppose that artificial intelligence research has succeeded in programming a computer to behave as if it understands Chinese. The machine accepts Chinese characters as input, carries out each instruction of the program step by step, and then produces Chinese characters as output. The machine does this so perfectly that no one can tell that they are communicating with a machine and not a hidden Chinese speaker.

The questions at issue are these: does the machine actually understand the conversation, or is it just simulating the ability to understand the conversation? Does the machine have a mind in exactly the same sense that people do, or is it just acting as if it has a mind?

Now suppose that Searle is in a room with an English version of the program, along with sufficient pencils, paper, erasers and filing cabinets. Chinese characters are slipped in under the door, he follows the program step-by-step, which eventually instructs him to slide other Chinese characters back out under the door. If the computer had passed the Turing test this way, it follows that Searle would do so as well, simply by running the program by hand.

Searle asserts that there is no essential difference between the roles of the computer and himself in the experiment. Each simply follows a program, step-by-step, producing behavior that makes them appear to understand. However, Searle would not be able to understand the conversation. Therefore, he argues, it follows that the computer would not be able to understand the conversation either.

Searle argues that, without &quot;understanding&quot; (or &quot;intentionality&quot;), we cannot describe what the machine is doing as &quot;thinking&quot; and, since it does not think, it does not have a &quot;mind&quot; in the normal sense of the word. Therefore, he concludes that the strong AI hypothesis is false: a computer running a program that simulates a mind would not have a mind in the same sense that human beings have a mind.

==History==
Gottfried Leibniz made a similar argument in 1714 against mechanism (the idea that everything that makes up a human being could, in principle, be explained in mechanical terms. In other words, that a person, including their mind, is merely a very complex machine). Leibniz used the thought experiment of expanding the brain until it was the size of a mill. Leibniz found it difficult to imagine that a &quot;mind&quot; capable of &quot;perception&quot; could be constructed using only mechanical processes.

Peter Winch made the same point in his book &quot;The Idea of a Social Science and its Relation to Philosophy&quot; (1958), where he provides an argument to show that &quot;a man who understands Chinese is not a man who has a firm grasp of the statistical probabilities for the occurrence of the various words in the Chinese language&quot; (p. 108).

Soviet cyberneticist Anatoly Dneprov made an essentially identical argument in 1961, in the form of the short story &quot;The Game&quot;. In it, a stadium of people act as switches and memory cells implementing a program to translate a sentence of Portuguese, a language that none of them know. The game was organized by a &quot;Professor Zarubin&quot; to answer the question &quot;Can mathematical machines think?&quot; Speaking through Zarubin, Dneprov writes &quot;the only way to prove that machines can think is to turn yourself into a machine and examine your thinking process&quot; and he concludes, as Searle does, &quot;We&#x27;ve proven that even the most perfect simulation of machine thinking is not the thinking process itself.&quot;

In 1974, Lawrence H. Davis imagined duplicating the brain using telephone lines and offices staffed by people, and in 1978 Ned Block envisioned the entire population of China involved in such a brain simulation. This thought experiment is called the China brain, also the &quot;Chinese Nation&quot; or the &quot;Chinese Gym&quot;.
Searle&#x27;s version appeared in his 1980 paper &quot;Minds, Brains, and Programs&quot;, published in &quot;Behavioral and Brain Sciences&quot;. It eventually became the journal&#x27;s &quot;most influential target article&quot;, generating an enormous number of commentaries and responses in the ensuing decades, and Searle has continued to defend and refine the argument in many papers, popular articles and books. David Cole writes that &quot;the Chinese Room argument has probably been the most widely discussed philosophical argument in cognitive science to appear in the past 25 years&quot;.

Most of the discussion consists of attempts to refute it. &quot;The overwhelming majority&quot;, notes &quot;Behavioral and Brain Sciences&quot; editor Stevan Harnad, &quot;still think that the Chinese Room Argument is dead wrong&quot;. The sheer volume of the literature that has grown up around it inspired Pat Hayes to comment that the field of cognitive science ought to be redefined as &quot;the ongoing research program of showing Searle&#x27;s Chinese Room Argument to be false&quot;.

Searle&#x27;s argument has become &quot;something of a classic in cognitive science&quot;, according to Harnad. Varol Akman agrees, and has described the original paper as &quot;an exemplar of philosophical clarity and purity&quot;.

== Philosophy ==
Although the Chinese Room argument was originally presented in reaction to the statements of artificial intelligence researchers, philosophers have come to consider it as an important part of the philosophy of mind. It is a challenge to functionalism and the computational theory of mind, and is related to such questions as the mind–body problem, the problem of other minds, the symbol grounding problem, and the hard problem of consciousness.

=== Strong AI ===
Searle identified a philosophical position he calls &quot;strong AI&quot;:

The definition depends on the distinction between simulating a mind and actually having one. Searle writes that &quot;according to Strong AI, the correct simulation really is a mind. According to Weak AI, the correct simulation is a model of the mind.&quot;

The claim is implicit in some of the statements of early AI researchers and analysts. For example, in 1955, AI founder Herbert A. Simon declared that &quot;there are now in the world machines that think, that learn and create&quot;. Simon, together with Allen Newell and Cliff Shaw, after having completed the first program that could do formal reasoning (the Logic Theorist), claimed that they had &quot;solved the venerable mind–body problem, explaining how a system composed of matter can have the properties of mind.&quot; John Haugeland wrote that &quot;AI wants only the genuine article: machines with minds, in the full and literal sense. This is not science fiction, but real science, based on a theoretical conception as deep as it is daring: namely, we are, at root, computers ourselves.&quot;

Searle also ascribes the following claims to advocates of strong AI:
* AI systems can be used to explain the mind;
* The study of the brain is irrelevant to the study of the mind; and
* The Turing test is adequate for establishing the existence of mental states.

=== Strong AI as computationalism or functionalism ===
In more recent presentations of the Chinese room argument, Searle has identified &quot;strong AI&quot; as &quot;computer functionalism&quot; (a term he attributes to Daniel Dennett). Functionalism is a position in modern philosophy of mind that holds that we can define mental phenomena (such as beliefs, desires, and perceptions) by describing their functions in relation to each other and to the outside world. Because a computer program can accurately represent functional relationships as relationships between symbols, a computer can have mental phenomena if it runs the right program, according to functionalism.

Stevan Harnad argues that Searle&#x27;s depictions of strong AI can be reformulated as &quot;recognizable tenets of computationalism, a position (unlike &quot;strong AI&quot;) that is actually held by many thinkers, and hence one worth refuting.&quot; Computationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind which argues that the mind can be accurately described as an information-processing system.

Each of the following, according to Harnad, is a &quot;tenet&quot; of computationalism:
* Mental states are computational states (which is why computers can have mental states and help to explain the mind);
* Computational states are implementation-independent—in other words, it is the software that determines the computational state, not the hardware (which is why the brain, being hardware, is irrelevant); and that
* Since implementation is unimportant, the only empirical data that matters is how the system functions; hence the Turing test is definitive.

Recent philosophical discussions have revisited the implications of computationalism for artificial intelligence. Goldstein and Levinstein explore whether large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT can possess minds, focusing on their ability to exhibit folk psychology, including beliefs, desires, and intentions. The authors argue that LLMs satisfy several philosophical theories of mental representation, such as informational, causal, and structural theories, by demonstrating robust internal representations of the world. However, they highlight that the evidence for LLMs having action dispositions necessary for belief-desire psychology remains inconclusive. Additionally, they refute common skeptical challenges, such as the &quot;stochastic parrots&quot; argument and concerns over memorization, asserting that LLMs exhibit structured internal representations that align with these philosophical criteria.

Building on this discourse, Kristina Šekrst highlights how AI hallucinations offer a unique perspective on computationalism. While functionalism defines mental states through their functional relationships, the emergence of hallucinations in AI systems reveals the limitations of such states when divorced from intrinsic understanding. These hallucinations, though arising from accurate functional representations, underscore the gap between computational reliability and the ontological complexity of human mental states. By doing so, they challenge the adequacy of functional accuracy in attributing mental phenomena to AI systems within a computationalist framework.

David Chalmers suggests that while current LLMs lack features like recurrent processing and unified agency, advancements in AI could address these limitations within the next decade, potentially enabling systems to achieve consciousness. This perspective challenges Searle&#x27;s original claim that purely &quot;syntactic&quot; processing cannot yield understanding or consciousness, arguing instead that such systems could have authentic mental states.

=== Strong AI vs. biological naturalism ===
Searle holds a philosophical position he calls &quot;biological naturalism&quot;: that consciousness and understanding require specific biological machinery that are found in brains. He writes &quot;brains cause minds&quot; and that &quot;actual human mental phenomena [are] dependent on actual physical–chemical properties of actual human brains&quot;. Searle argues that this machinery (known in neuroscience as the &quot;neural correlates of consciousness&quot;) must have some causal powers that permit the human experience of consciousness. Searle&#x27;s belief in the existence of these powers has been criticized.

Searle does not disagree with the notion that machines can have consciousness and understanding, because, as he writes, &quot;we are precisely such machines&quot;. Searle holds that the brain is, in fact, a machine, but that the brain gives rise to consciousness and understanding using specific machinery. If neuroscience is able to isolate the mechanical process that gives rise to consciousness, then Searle grants that it may be possible to create machines that have consciousness and understanding. However, without the specific machinery required, Searle does not believe that consciousness can occur.

Biological naturalism implies that one cannot determine if the experience of consciousness is occurring merely by examining how a system functions, because the specific machinery of the brain is essential. Thus, biological naturalism is directly opposed to both behaviorism and functionalism (including &quot;computer functionalism&quot; or &quot;strong AI&quot;). Biological naturalism is similar to identity theory (the position that mental states are &quot;identical to&quot; or &quot;composed of&quot; neurological events); however, Searle has specific technical objections to identity theory. Searle&#x27;s biological naturalism and strong AI are both opposed to Cartesian dualism, the classical idea that the brain and mind are made of different &quot;substances&quot;. Indeed, Searle accuses strong AI of dualism, writing that &quot;strong AI only makes sense given the dualistic assumption that, where the mind is concerned, the brain doesn&#x27;t matter&quot;.

=== Consciousness ===
Searle&#x27;s original presentation emphasized understanding—that is, mental states with intentionality—and did not directly address other closely related ideas such as &quot;consciousness&quot;. However, in more recent presentations, Searle has included consciousness as the real target of the argument.

David Chalmers writes, &quot;it is fairly clear that consciousness is at the root of the matter&quot; of the Chinese room.

Colin McGinn argues that the Chinese room provides strong evidence that the hard problem of consciousness is fundamentally insoluble. The argument, to be clear, is not about whether a machine can be conscious, but about whether it (or anything else for that matter) can be shown to be conscious. It is plain that any other method of probing the occupant of a Chinese room has the same difficulties in principle as exchanging questions and answers in Chinese. It is simply not possible to divine whether a conscious agency or some clever simulation inhabits the room.

Searle argues that this is only true for an observer outside of the room. The whole point of the thought experiment is to put someone inside the room, where they can directly observe the operations of consciousness. Searle claims that from his vantage point within the room there is nothing he can see that could imaginably give rise to consciousness, other than himself, and clearly he does not have a mind that can speak Chinese. In Searle&#x27;s words, &quot;the computer has nothing more than I have in the case where I understand nothing&quot;.

===Applied ethics ===

Patrick Hew used the Chinese Room argument to deduce requirements from military command and control systems if they are to preserve a commander&#x27;s moral agency. He drew an analogy between a commander in their command center and the person in the Chinese Room, and analyzed it under a reading of Aristotle&#x27;s notions of &quot;compulsory&quot; and &quot;ignorance&quot;. Information could be &quot;down converted&quot; from meaning to symbols, and manipulated symbolically, but moral agency could be undermined if there was inadequate &#x27;up conversion&#x27; into meaning. Hew cited examples from the USS &quot;Vincennes&quot; incident.

== Computer science ==
The Chinese room argument is primarily an argument in the philosophy of mind, and both major computer scientists and artificial intelligence researchers consider it irrelevant to their fields. However, several concepts developed by computer scientists are essential to understanding the argument, including symbol processing, Turing machines, Turing completeness, and the Turing test.

=== Strong AI vs. AI research ===
Searle&#x27;s arguments are not usually considered an issue for AI research. The primary mission of artificial intelligence research is only to create useful systems that act intelligently and it does not matter if the intelligence is &quot;merely&quot; a simulation. AI researchers Stuart J. Russell and Peter Norvig wrote in 2021: &quot;We are interested in programs that behave intelligently. Individual aspects of consciousness—awareness, self-awareness, attention—can be programmed and can be part of an intelligent machine. The additional project making a machine conscious in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on.&quot;

Searle does not disagree that AI research can create machines that are capable of highly intelligent behavior. The Chinese room argument leaves open the possibility that a digital machine could be built that acts more intelligently than a person, but does not have a mind or intentionality in the same way that brains do.

Searle&#x27;s &quot;strong AI hypothesis&quot; should not be confused with &quot;strong AI&quot; as defined by Ray Kurzweil and other futurists, who use the term to describe machine intelligence that rivals or exceeds human intelligence—that is, artificial general intelligence, human level AI or superintelligence. Kurzweil is referring primarily to the amount of intelligence displayed by the machine, whereas Searle&#x27;s argument sets no limit on this. Searle argues that a superintelligent machine would not necessarily have a mind and consciousness.

=== Turing test ===
The Chinese room implements a version of the Turing test. Alan Turing introduced the test in 1950 to help answer the question &quot;can machines think?&quot; In the standard version, a human judge engages in a natural language conversation with a human and a machine designed to generate performance indistinguishable from that of a human being. All participants are separated from one another. If the judge cannot reliably tell the machine from the human, the machine is said to have passed the test.

Turing then considered each possible objection to the proposal &quot;machines can think&quot;, and found that there are simple, obvious answers if the question is de-mystified in this way. He did not, however, intend for the test to measure for the presence of &quot;consciousness&quot; or &quot;understanding&quot;. He did not believe this was relevant to the issues that he was addressing. He wrote:
To Searle, as a philosopher investigating in the nature of mind and consciousness, these are the relevant mysteries. The Chinese room is designed to show that the Turing test is insufficient to detect the presence of consciousness, even if the room can behave or function as a conscious mind would.

=== Symbol processing ===

Computers manipulate physical objects in order to carry out calculations and do simulations. AI researchers Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon called this kind of machine a physical symbol system. It is also equivalent to the formal systems used in the field of mathematical logic.

Searle emphasizes the fact that this kind of symbol manipulation is syntactic (borrowing a term from the study of grammar). The computer manipulates the symbols using a form of syntax, without any knowledge of the symbol&#x27;s semantics (that is, their meaning).

Newell and Simon had conjectured that a physical symbol system (such as a digital computer) had all the necessary machinery for &quot;general intelligent action&quot;, or, as it is known today, artificial general intelligence. They framed this as a philosophical position, the physical symbol system hypothesis: &quot;A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means for general intelligent action.&quot; The Chinese room argument does not refute this, because it is framed in terms of &quot;intelligent action&quot;, i.e. the external behavior of the machine, rather than the presence or absence of understanding, consciousness and mind.

Twenty-first century AI programs (such as &quot;deep learning&quot;) do mathematical operations on huge matrixes of unidentified numbers and bear little resemblance to the symbolic processing used by AI programs at the time Searle wrote his critique in 1980. Nils Nilsson describes systems like these as &quot;dynamic&quot; rather than &quot;symbolic&quot;. Nilsson notes that these are essentially digitized representations of dynamic systems—the individual numbers do not have a specific semantics, but are instead samples or data points from a dynamic signal, and it is the signal being approximated which would have semantics. Nilsson argues it is not reasonable to consider these signals as &quot;symbol processing&quot; in the same sense as the physical symbol systems hypothesis.

===Chinese room and Turing completeness===

The Chinese room has a design analogous to that of a modern computer. It has a Von Neumann architecture, which consists of a program (the book of instructions), some memory (the papers and file cabinets), a machine that follows the instructions (the man), and a means to write symbols in memory (the pencil and eraser). A machine with this design is known in theoretical computer science as &quot;Turing complete&quot;, because it has the necessary machinery to carry out any computation that a Turing machine can do, and therefore it is capable of doing a step-by-step simulation of any other digital machine, given enough memory and time. Turing writes, &quot;all digital computers are in a sense equivalent.&quot; The widely accepted Church–Turing thesis holds that any function computable by an effective procedure is computable by a Turing machine.

The Turing completeness of the Chinese room implies that it can do whatever any other digital computer can do (albeit much, much more slowly). Thus, if the Chinese room does not or can not contain a Chinese-speaking mind, then no other digital computer can contain a mind. Some replies to Searle begin by arguing that the room, as described, cannot have a Chinese-speaking mind. Arguments of this form, according to Stevan Harnad, are &quot;no refutation (but rather an affirmation)&quot; of the Chinese room argument, because these arguments actually imply that no digital computers can have a mind.

There are some critics, such as Hanoch Ben-Yami, who argue that the Chinese room cannot simulate all the abilities of a digital computer, such as being able to determine the current time.

== Complete argument ==
Searle has produced a more formal version of the argument of which the Chinese Room forms a part. He presented the first version in 1984. The version given below is from 1990. The Chinese room thought experiment is intended to prove point A3.

He begins with three axioms:
:(A1) &quot;Programs are formal (syntactic).&quot;
::A program uses syntax to manipulate symbols and pays no attention to the semantics of the symbols. It knows where to put the symbols and how to move them around, but it does not know what they stand for or what they mean. For the program, the symbols are just physical objects like any others.

:(A2) &quot;Minds have mental contents (semantics).&quot;
::Unlike the symbols used by a program, our thoughts have meaning: they represent things and we know what it is they represent.

:(A3) &quot;Syntax by itself is neither constitutive of nor sufficient for semantics.&quot;
::This is what the Chinese room thought experiment is intended to prove: the Chinese room has syntax (because there is a man in there moving symbols around). The Chinese room has no semantics (because, according to Searle, there is no one or nothing in the room that understands what the symbols mean). Therefore, having syntax is not enough to generate semantics.

Searle posits that these lead directly to this conclusion:

:(C1) Programs are neither constitutive of nor sufficient for minds.
::This should follow without controversy from the first three: Programs don&#x27;t have semantics. Programs have only syntax, and syntax is insufficient for semantics. Every mind has semantics. Therefore no programs are minds.

This much of the argument is intended to show that artificial intelligence can never produce a machine with a mind by writing programs that manipulate symbols. The remainder of the argument addresses a different issue. Is the human brain running a program? In other words, is the computational theory of mind correct? He begins with an axiom that is intended to express the basic modern scientific consensus about brains and minds:

:(A4) Brains cause minds.

Searle claims that we can derive &quot;immediately&quot; and &quot;trivially&quot; that:

:(C2) Any other system capable of causing minds would have to have causal powers (at least) equivalent to those of brains.
::Brains must have something that causes a mind to exist. Science has yet to determine exactly what it is, but it must exist, because minds exist. Searle calls it &quot;causal powers&quot;. &quot;Causal powers&quot; is whatever the brain uses to create a mind. If anything else can cause a mind to exist, it must have &quot;equivalent causal powers&quot;. &quot;Equivalent causal powers&quot; is whatever else that could be used to make a mind.

And from this he derives the further conclusions:

:(C3) Any artifact that produced mental phenomena, any artificial brain, would have to be able to duplicate the specific causal powers of brains, and it could not do that just by running a formal program.
::This follows from C1 and C2: Since no program can produce a mind, and &quot;equivalent causal powers&quot; produce minds, it follows that programs do not have &quot;equivalent causal powers.&quot;

:(C4) The way that human brains actually produce mental phenomena cannot be solely by virtue of running a computer program.
::Since programs do not have &quot;equivalent causal powers&quot;, &quot;equivalent causal powers&quot; produce minds, and brains produce minds, it follows that brains do not use programs to produce minds.

Refutations of Searle&#x27;s argument take many different forms (see below). Computationalists and functionalists reject A3, arguing that &quot;syntax&quot; (as Searle describes it) can have &quot;semantics&quot; if the syntax has the right functional structure. Eliminative materialists reject A2, arguing that minds don&#x27;t actually have &quot;semantics&quot;—that thoughts and other mental phenomena are inherently meaningless but nevertheless function as if they had meaning.

== Replies ==
Replies to Searle&#x27;s argument may be classified according to what they claim to show:
* Those which identify who speaks Chinese
* Those which demonstrate how meaningless symbols can become meaningful
* Those which suggest that the Chinese room should be redesigned in some way
* Those which contend that Searle&#x27;s argument is misleading
* Those which argue that the argument makes false assumptions about subjective conscious experience and therefore proves nothing

Some of the arguments (robot and brain simulation, for example) fall into multiple categories.

===Systems and virtual mind replies: finding the mind===
These replies attempt to answer the question: since the man in the room does not speak Chinese, where is the mind that does? These replies address the key ontological issues of mind versus body and simulation vs. reality. All of the replies that identify the mind in the room are versions of &quot;the system reply&quot;.

==== System reply ====
The basic version of the system reply argues that it is the &quot;whole system&quot; that understands Chinese. While the man understands only English, when he is combined with the program, scratch paper, pencils and file cabinets, they form a system that can understand Chinese. &quot;Here, understanding is not being ascribed to the mere individual; rather it is being ascribed to this whole system of which he is a part&quot; Searle explains.

Searle notes that (in this simple version of the reply) the &quot;system&quot; is nothing more than a collection of ordinary physical objects; it grants the power of understanding and consciousness to &quot;the conjunction of that person and bits of paper&quot; without making any effort to explain how this pile of objects has become a conscious, thinking being. Searle argues that no reasonable person should be satisfied with the reply, unless they are &quot;under the grip of an ideology;&quot; In order for this reply to be remotely plausible, one must take it for granted that consciousness can be the product of an information processing &quot;system&quot;, and does not require anything resembling the actual biology of the brain.

Searle then responds by simplifying this list of physical objects: he asks what happens if the man memorizes the rules and keeps track of everything in his head? Then the whole system consists of just one object: the man himself. Searle argues that if the man does not understand Chinese then the system does not understand Chinese either because now &quot;the system&quot; and &quot;the man&quot; both describe exactly the same object.

Critics of Searle&#x27;s response argue that the program has allowed the man to have two minds in one head. If we assume a &quot;mind&quot; is a form of information processing, then the theory of computation can account for two computations occurring at once, namely (1) the computation for universal programmability (which is the function instantiated by the person and note-taking materials independently from any particular program contents) and (2) the computation of the Turing machine that is described by the program (which is instantiated by everything including the specific program). The theory of computation thus formally explains the open possibility that the second computation in the Chinese Room could entail a human-equivalent semantic understanding of the Chinese inputs. The focus belongs on the program&#x27;s Turing machine rather than on the person&#x27;s. However, from Searle&#x27;s perspective, this argument is circular. The question at issue is whether consciousness is a form of information processing, and this reply requires that we make that assumption.

More sophisticated versions of the systems reply try to identify more precisely what &quot;the system&quot; is and they differ in exactly how they describe it. According to these replies, the &quot;mind that speaks Chinese&quot; could be such things as: the &quot;software&quot;, a &quot;program&quot;, a &quot;running program&quot;, a simulation of the &quot;neural correlates of consciousness&quot;, the &quot;functional system&quot;, a &quot;simulated mind&quot;, an &quot;emergent property&quot;, or &quot;a virtual mind&quot;.

==== Virtual mind reply ====
Marvin Minsky suggested a version of the system reply known as the &quot;virtual mind reply&quot;. The term &quot;virtual&quot; is used in computer science to describe an object that appears to exist &quot;in&quot; a computer (or computer network) only because software makes it appear to exist. The objects &quot;inside&quot; computers (including files, folders, and so on) are all &quot;virtual&quot;, except for the computer&#x27;s electronic components. Similarly, Minsky that a computer may contain a &quot;mind&quot; that is virtual in the same sense as virtual machines, virtual communities and virtual reality.

To clarify the distinction between the simple systems reply given above and virtual mind reply, David Cole notes that two simulations could be running on one system at the same time: one speaking Chinese and one speaking Korean. While there is only one system, there can be multiple &quot;virtual minds,&quot; thus the &quot;system&quot; cannot be the &quot;mind&quot;.

Searle responds that such a mind is at best a simulation, and writes: &quot;No one supposes that computer simulations of a five-alarm fire will burn the neighborhood down or that a computer simulation of a rainstorm will leave us all drenched.&quot; Nicholas Fearn responds that, for some things, simulation is as good as the real thing. &quot;When we call up the pocket calculator function on a desktop computer, the image of a pocket calculator appears on the screen. We don&#x27;t complain that it isn&#x27;t really a calculator, because the physical attributes of the device do not matter.&quot; The question is, is the human mind like the pocket calculator, essentially composed of information, where a perfect simulation of the thing just is the thing? Or is the mind like the rainstorm, a thing in the world that is more than just its simulation, and not realizable in full by a computer simulation? For decades, this question of simulation has led AI researchers and philosophers to consider whether the term &quot;synthetic intelligence&quot; is more appropriate than the common description of such intelligences as &quot;artificial.&quot;

These replies provide an explanation of exactly who it is that understands Chinese. If there is something &quot;besides&quot; the man in the room that can understand Chinese, Searle cannot argue that (1) the man does not understand Chinese, therefore (2) nothing in the room understands Chinese. This, according to those who make this reply, shows that Searle&#x27;s argument fails to prove that &quot;strong AI&quot; is false.

These replies, by themselves, do not provide any evidence that strong AI is true, however. They do not show that the system (or the virtual mind) understands Chinese, other than the hypothetical premise that it passes the Turing test. Searle argues that, if we are to consider Strong AI remotely plausible, the Chinese Room is an example that requires explanation, and it is difficult or impossible to explain how consciousness might &quot;emerge&quot; from the room or how the system would have consciousness. As Searle writes &quot;the systems reply simply begs the question by insisting that the system must understand Chinese&quot; and thus is dodging the question or hopelessly circular.

===Robot and semantics replies: finding the meaning===
As far as the person in the room is concerned, the symbols are just meaningless &quot;squiggles.&quot; But if the Chinese room really &quot;understands&quot; what it is saying, then the symbols must get their meaning from somewhere. These arguments attempt to connect the symbols to the things they symbolize. These replies address Searle&#x27;s concerns about intentionality, symbol grounding and syntax vs. semantics.

==== Robot reply ====
Suppose that instead of a room, the program was placed into a robot that could wander around and interact with its environment. This would allow a &quot;causal connection&quot; between the symbols and things they represent. Hans Moravec comments: &quot;If we could graft a robot to a reasoning program, we wouldn&#x27;t need a person to provide the meaning anymore: it would come from the physical world.&quot;

Searle&#x27;s reply is to suppose that, unbeknownst to the individual in the Chinese room, some of the inputs came directly from a camera mounted on a robot, and some of the outputs were used to manipulate the arms and legs of the robot. Nevertheless, the person in the room is still just following the rules, and does not know what the symbols mean. Searle writes &quot;he doesn&#x27;t see what comes into the robot&#x27;s eyes.&quot;

==== Derived meaning ====
Some respond that the room, as Searle describes it, is connected to the world: through the Chinese speakers that it is &quot;talking&quot; to and through the programmers who designed the knowledge base in his file cabinet. The symbols Searle manipulates are already meaningful, they are just not meaningful to him.

Searle says that the symbols only have a &quot;derived&quot; meaning, like the meaning of words in books. The meaning of the symbols depends on the conscious understanding of the Chinese speakers and the programmers outside the room. The room, like a book, has no understanding of its own.

====Contextualist reply====
Some have argued that the meanings of the symbols would come from a vast &quot;background&quot; of commonsense knowledge encoded in the program and the filing cabinets. This would provide a &quot;context&quot; that would give the symbols their meaning.

Searle agrees that this background exists, but he does not agree that it can be built into programs. Hubert Dreyfus has also criticized the idea that the &quot;background&quot; can be represented symbolically.

To each of these suggestions, Searle&#x27;s response is the same: no matter how much knowledge is written into the program and no matter how the program is connected to the world, he is still in the room manipulating symbols according to rules. His actions are syntactic and this can never explain to him what the symbols stand for. Searle writes &quot;syntax is insufficient for semantics.&quot;

However, for those who accept that Searle&#x27;s actions simulate a mind, separate from his own, the important question is not what the symbols mean to Searle, what is important is what they mean to the virtual mind. While Searle is trapped in the room, the virtual mind is not: it is connected to the outside world through the Chinese speakers it speaks to, through the programmers who gave it world knowledge, and through the cameras and other sensors that roboticists can supply.

=== Brain simulation and connectionist replies: redesigning the room ===
These arguments are all versions of the systems reply that identify a particular kind of system as being important; they identify some special technology that would create conscious understanding in a machine. (The &quot;robot&quot; and &quot;commonsense knowledge&quot; replies above also specify a certain kind of system as being important.)

==== Brain simulator reply ====
Suppose that the program simulated in fine detail the action of every neuron in the brain of a Chinese speaker. This strengthens the intuition that there would be no significant difference between the operation of the program and the operation of a live human brain.

Searle replies that such a simulation does not reproduce the important features of the brain—its causal and intentional states. He is adamant that &quot;human mental phenomena [are] dependent on actual physical–chemical properties of actual human brains.&quot; Moreover, he argues:
=====China brain=====
What if we ask each citizen of China to simulate one neuron, using the telephone system to simulate the connections between axons and dendrites? In this version, it seems obvious that no individual would have any understanding of what the brain might be saying. It is also obvious that this system would be functionally equivalent to a brain, so if consciousness is a function, this system would be conscious.

=====Brain replacement scenario=====
In this, we are asked to imagine that engineers have invented a tiny computer that simulates the action of an individual neuron. What would happen if we replaced one neuron at a time? Replacing one would clearly do nothing to change conscious awareness. Replacing all of them would create a digital computer that simulates a brain. If Searle is right, then conscious awareness must disappear during the procedure (either gradually or all at once). Searle&#x27;s critics argue that there would be no point during the procedure when he can claim that conscious awareness ends and mindless simulation begins. (See Ship of Theseus for a similar thought experiment.)

====Connectionist replies====
:Closely related to the brain simulator reply, this claims that a massively parallel connectionist architecture would be capable of understanding. Modern deep learning is massively parallel and has successfully displayed intelligent behavior in many domains. Nils Nilsson argues that modern AI is using digitized &quot;dynamic signals&quot; rather than symbols of the kind used by AI in 1980. Here it is the sampled signal which would have the semantics, not the individual numbers manipulated by the program. This is a different kind of machine than the one that Searle visualized.

====Combination reply====
:This response combines the robot reply with the brain simulation reply, arguing that a brain simulation connected to the world through a robot body could have a mind.

====Many mansions / wait till next year reply====
:Better technology in the future will allow computers to understand. Searle agrees that this is possible, but considers this point irrelevant. Searle agrees that there may be other hardware besides brains that have conscious understanding.

These arguments (and the robot or common-sense knowledge replies) identify some special technology that would help create conscious understanding in a machine. They may be interpreted in two ways: either they claim (1) this technology is required for consciousness, the Chinese room does not or cannot implement this technology, and therefore the Chinese room cannot pass the Turing test or (even if it did) it would not have conscious understanding. Or they may be claiming that (2) it is easier to see that the Chinese room has a mind if we visualize this technology as being used to create it.

In the first case, where features like a robot body or a connectionist architecture are required, Searle claims that strong AI (as he understands it) has been abandoned. The Chinese room has all the elements of a Turing complete machine, and thus is capable of simulating any digital computation whatsoever. If Searle&#x27;s room cannot pass the Turing test then there is no other digital technology that could pass the Turing test. If Searle&#x27;s room could pass the Turing test, but still does not have a mind, then the Turing test is not sufficient to determine if the room has a &quot;mind&quot;. Either way, it denies one or the other of the positions Searle thinks of as &quot;strong AI&quot;, proving his argument.

The brain arguments in particular deny strong AI if they assume that there is no simpler way to describe the mind than to create a program that is just as mysterious as the brain was. He writes &quot;I thought the whole idea of strong AI was that we don&#x27;t need to know how the brain works to know how the mind works.&quot; If computation does not provide an explanation of the human mind, then strong AI has failed, according to Searle.

Other critics hold that the room as Searle described it does, in fact, have a mind, however they argue that it is difficult to see—Searle&#x27;s description is correct, but misleading. By redesigning the room more realistically they hope to make this more obvious. In this case, these arguments are being used as appeals to intuition (see next section).

In fact, the room can just as easily be redesigned to weaken our intuitions. Ned Block&#x27;s Blockhead argument suggests that the program could, in theory, be rewritten into a simple lookup table of rules of the form &quot;if the user writes &quot;S&quot;, reply with &quot;P&quot; and goto X&quot;. At least in principle, any program can be rewritten (or &quot;refactored&quot;) into this form, even a brain simulation. In the blockhead scenario, the entire mental state is hidden in the letter X, which represents a memory address—a number associated with the next rule. It is hard to visualize that an instant of one&#x27;s conscious experience can be captured in a single large number, yet this is exactly what &quot;strong AI&quot; claims. On the other hand, such a lookup table would be ridiculously large (to the point of being physically impossible), and the states could therefore be overly specific.

Searle argues that however the program is written or however the machine is connected to the world, the mind is being simulated by a simple step-by-step digital machine (or machines). These machines are always just like the man in the room: they understand nothing and do not speak Chinese. They are merely manipulating symbols without knowing what they mean. Searle writes: &quot;I can have any formal program you like, but I still understand nothing.&quot;

=== Speed and complexity: appeals to intuition ===
The following arguments (and the intuitive interpretations of the arguments above) do not directly explain how a Chinese speaking mind could exist in Searle&#x27;s room, or how the symbols he manipulates could become meaningful. However, by raising doubts about Searle&#x27;s intuitions they support other positions, such as the system and robot replies. These arguments, if accepted, prevent Searle from claiming that his conclusion is obvious by undermining the intuitions that his certainty requires.

Several critics believe that Searle&#x27;s argument relies entirely on intuitions. Block writes &quot;Searle&#x27;s argument depends for its force on intuitions that certain entities do not think.&quot; Daniel Dennett describes the Chinese room argument as a misleading &quot;intuition pump&quot; and writes &quot;Searle&#x27;s thought experiment depends, illicitly, on your imagining too simple a case, an irrelevant case, and drawing the obvious conclusion from it.&quot;

Some of the arguments above also function as appeals to intuition, especially those that are intended to make it seem more plausible that the Chinese room contains a mind, which can include the robot, commonsense knowledge, brain simulation and connectionist replies. Several of the replies above also address the specific issue of complexity. The connectionist reply emphasizes that a working artificial intelligence system would have to be as complex and as interconnected as the human brain. The commonsense knowledge reply emphasizes that any program that passed a Turing test would have to be &quot;an extraordinarily supple, sophisticated, and multilayered system, brimming with &#x27;world knowledge&#x27; and meta-knowledge and meta-meta-knowledge&quot;, as Daniel Dennett explains.

==== Speed and complexity replies ====
Many of these critiques emphasize speed and complexity of the human brain, which processes information at 100 billion operations per second (by some estimates). Several critics point out that the man in the room would probably take millions of years to respond to a simple question, and would require &quot;filing cabinets&quot; of astronomical proportions. This brings the clarity of Searle&#x27;s intuition into doubt.

An especially vivid version of the speed and complexity reply is from Paul and Patricia Churchland. They propose this analogous thought experiment: &quot;Consider a dark room containing a man holding a bar magnet or charged object. If the man pumps the magnet up and down, then, according to Maxwell&#x27;s theory of artificial luminance (AL), it will initiate a spreading circle of electromagnetic waves and will thus be luminous. But as all of us who have toyed with magnets or charged balls well know, their forces (or any other forces for that matter), even when set in motion produce no luminance at all. It is inconceivable that you might constitute real luminance just by moving forces around!&quot; Churchland&#x27;s point is that the problem is that he would have to wave the magnet up and down something like 450 trillion times per second in order to see anything.

Stevan Harnad is critical of speed and complexity replies when they stray beyond addressing our intuitions. He writes &quot;Some have made a cult of speed and timing, holding that, when accelerated to the right speed, the computational may make a phase transition into the mental. It should be clear that is not a counterargument but merely an ad hoc speculation (as is the view that it is all just a matter of ratcheting up to the right degree of &#x27;complexity.&#x27;)&quot;

Searle argues that his critics are also relying on intuitions, however his opponents&#x27; intuitions have no empirical basis. He writes that, in order to consider the &quot;system reply&quot; as remotely plausible, a person must be &quot;under the grip of an ideology&quot;. The system reply only makes sense (to Searle) if one assumes that any &quot;system&quot; can have consciousness, just by virtue of being a system with the right behavior and functional parts. This assumption, he argues, is not tenable given our experience of consciousness.

=== Other minds and zombies: meaninglessness ===
Several replies argue that Searle&#x27;s argument is irrelevant because his assumptions about the mind and consciousness are faulty. Searle believes that human beings directly experience their consciousness, intentionality and the nature of the mind every day, and that this experience of consciousness is not open to question. He writes that we must &quot;presuppose the reality and knowability of the mental.&quot; The replies below question whether Searle is justified in using his own experience of consciousness to determine that it is more than mechanical symbol processing. In particular, the other minds reply argues that we cannot use our experience of consciousness to answer questions about other minds (even the mind of a computer), the epiphenoma replies question whether we can make any argument at all about something like consciousness which can not, by definition, be detected by any experiment, and the eliminative materialist reply argues that Searle&#x27;s own personal consciousness does not &quot;exist&quot; in the sense that Searle thinks it does.

==== Other minds reply ====
The &quot;Other Minds Reply&quot; points out that Searle&#x27;s argument is a version of the problem of other minds, applied to machines. There is no way we can determine if other people&#x27;s subjective experience is the same as our own. We can only study their behavior (i.e., by giving them our own Turing test). Critics of Searle argue that he is holding the Chinese room to a higher standard than we would hold an ordinary person.

Nils Nilsson writes &quot;If a program behaves as if it were multiplying, most of us would say that it is, in fact, multiplying. For all I know, Searle may only be behaving as if he were thinking deeply about these matters. But, even though I disagree with him, his simulation is pretty good, so I&#x27;m willing to credit him with real thought.&quot;

Turing anticipated Searle&#x27;s line of argument (which he called &quot;The Argument from Consciousness&quot;) in 1950 and makes the other minds reply. He noted that people never consider the problem of other minds when dealing with each other. He writes that &quot;instead of arguing continually over this point it is usual to have the polite convention that everyone thinks.&quot; The Turing test simply extends this &quot;polite convention&quot; to machines. He does not intend to solve the problem of other minds (for machines or people) and he does not think we need to.

==== Replies considering that Searle&#x27;s &quot;consciousness&quot; is undetectable ====
If we accept Searle&#x27;s description of intentionality, consciousness, and the mind, we are forced to accept that consciousness is epiphenomenal: that it &quot;casts no shadow&quot; i.e. is undetectable in the outside world. Searle&#x27;s &quot;causal properties&quot; cannot be detected by anyone outside the mind, otherwise the Chinese Room could not pass the Turing test—the people outside would be able to tell there was not a Chinese speaker in the room by detecting their causal properties. Since they cannot detect causal properties, they cannot detect the existence of the mental. Thus, Searle&#x27;s &quot;causal properties&quot; and consciousness itself is undetectable, and anything that cannot be detected either does not exist or does not matter.

Mike Alder calls this the &quot;Newton&#x27;s Flaming Laser Sword Reply&quot;. He argues that the entire argument is frivolous, because it is non-verificationist: not only is the distinction between simulating a mind and having a mind ill-defined, but it is also irrelevant because no experiments were, or even can be, proposed to distinguish between the two.

Daniel Dennett provides this illustration: suppose that, by some mutation, a human being is born that does not have Searle&#x27;s &quot;causal properties&quot; but nevertheless acts exactly like a human being. This is a philosophical zombie, as formulated in the philosophy of mind. This new animal would reproduce just as any other human and eventually there would be more of these zombies. Natural selection would favor the zombies, since their design is (we could suppose) a bit simpler. Eventually the humans would die out. So therefore, if Searle is right, it is most likely that human beings (as we see them today) are actually &quot;zombies&quot;, who nevertheless insist they are conscious. It is impossible to know whether we are all zombies or not. Even if we are all zombies, we would still believe that we are not.

==== Eliminative materialist reply ====
Several philosophers argue that consciousness, as Searle describes it, does not exist. Daniel Dennett describes consciousness as a &quot;user illusion&quot;.

This position is sometimes referred to as eliminative materialism: the view that consciousness is not a concept that can &quot;enjoy reduction&quot; to a strictly mechanical description, but rather is a concept that will be simply &quot;eliminated&quot; once the way the &quot;material&quot; brain works is fully understood, in just the same way as the concept of a demon has already been eliminated from science rather than enjoying reduction to a strictly mechanical description. Other mental properties, such as original intentionality (also called “meaning”, “content”, and “semantic character”), are also commonly regarded as special properties related to beliefs and other propositional attitudes. Eliminative materialism maintains that propositional attitudes such as beliefs and desires, among other intentional mental states that have content, do not exist. If eliminative materialism is the correct scientific account of human cognition then the assumption of the Chinese room argument that &quot;minds have mental contents (semantics)&quot; must be rejected.

Searle disagrees with this analysis and argues that &quot;the study of the mind starts with such facts as that humans have beliefs, while thermostats, telephones, and adding machines don&#x27;t ... what we wanted to know is what distinguishes the mind from thermostats and livers.&quot; He takes it as obvious that we can detect the presence of consciousness and dismisses these replies as being off the point.

=== Other replies ===
Margaret Boden argued in her paper &quot;Escaping from the Chinese Room&quot; that even if the person in the room does not understand the Chinese, it does not mean there is no understanding in the room. The person in the room at least understands the rule book used to provide output responses.

==== Carbon chauvinism ====
Searle conclusion that &quot;human mental phenomena [are] dependent on actual physical–chemical properties of actual human brains&quot; have been sometimes described as a form of &quot;Carbon chauvinism&quot;. Steven Pinker suggested that a response to that conclusion would be to make a counter thought experiment to the Chinese Room, where the incredulity goes the other way. He brings as an example the short story &quot;They&#x27;re Made Out of Meat&quot; which depicts an alien race composed of some electronic beings who upon finding Earth express disbelief that the meat brain of humans can experience consciousness and thought.

However, Searle himself denied being &quot;Carbon chauvinist&quot;. He said &quot;I have not tried to show that only biological based systems like our brains can think. [...] I regard this issue as up for grabs&quot;. He said that even silicon machines could theoretically have human-like consciousness and thought, if the actual physical–chemical properties of silicon could be used in a way that can produce consciousness and thought, but &quot;until we know how the brain does it we are not in a position to try to do it artificially&quot;.

<doc id="6220" wikidata="Q17278" url="?curid=6220" title="Circle">
<text>A circle is a shape consisting of all points in a plane that are at a given distance from a given point, the centre. The distance between any point of the circle and the centre is called the radius. The length of a line segment connecting two points on the circle and passing through the centre is called the diameter. A circle bounds a region of the plane called a disc.

The circle has been known since before the beginning of recorded history. Natural circles are common, such as the full moon or a slice of round fruit. The circle is the basis for the wheel, which, with related inventions such as gears, makes much of modern machinery possible. In mathematics, the study of the circle has helped inspire the development of geometry, astronomy and calculus.

==Terminology==
* Annulus: a ring-shaped object, the region bounded by two concentric circles.
* Arc: any connected part of a circle. Specifying two end points of an arc and a centre allows for two arcs that together make up a full circle.
* Centre: the point equidistant from all points on the circle.
* Chord: a line segment whose endpoints lie on the circle, thus dividing a circle into two segments.
* Circumference: the length of one circuit along the circle, or the distance around the circle.
* Diameter: a line segment whose endpoints lie on the circle and that passes through the centre; or the length of such a line segment. This is the largest distance between any two points on the circle. It is a special case of a chord, namely the longest chord for a given circle, and its length is twice the length of a radius.
* Disc: the region of the plane bounded by a circle. In strict mathematical usage, a circle is only the boundary of the disc (or disk), while in everyday use the term &quot;circle&quot; may also refer to a disc.
* Lens: the region common to (the intersection of) two overlapping discs.
* Radius: a line segment joining the centre of a circle with any single point on the circle itself; or the length of such a segment, which is half (the length of) a diameter. Usually, the radius is denoted formula_1 and required to be a positive number. A circle with formula_2 is a degenerate case consisting of a single point.
* Sector: a region bounded by two radii of equal length with a common centre and either of the two possible arcs, determined by this centre and the endpoints of the radii.
* Segment: a region bounded by a chord and one of the arcs connecting the chord&#x27;s endpoints. The length of the chord imposes a lower boundary on the diameter of possible arcs. Sometimes the term &quot;segment&quot; is used only for regions not containing the centre of the circle to which their arc belongs.
* Secant: an extended chord, a coplanar straight line, intersecting a circle in two points.
* Semicircle: one of the two possible arcs determined by the endpoints of a diameter, taking its midpoint as centre. In non-technical common usage it may mean the interior of the two-dimensional region bounded by a diameter and one of its arcs, that is technically called a half-disc. A half-disc is a special case of a segment, namely the largest one.
* Tangent: a coplanar straight line that has one single point in common with a circle (&quot;touches the circle at this point&quot;).
All of the specified regions may be considered as &quot;open&quot;, that is, not containing their boundaries, or as &quot;closed&quot;, including their respective boundaries.


==Etymology==
The word &quot;circle&quot; derives from the Greek κίρκος/κύκλος (&quot;kirkos/kuklos&quot;), itself a metathesis of the Homeric Greek κρίκος (&quot;krikos&quot;), meaning &quot;hoop&quot; or &quot;ring&quot;. The origins of the words &quot;circus&quot; and &quot;&quot; are closely related.

==History==
Prehistoric people made stone circles and timber circles, and circular elements are common in petroglyphs and cave paintings. Disc-shaped prehistoric artifacts include the Nebra sky disc and jade discs called Bi.

The Egyptian Rhind papyrus, dated to 1700 BCE, gives a method to find the area of a circle. The result corresponds to (3.16049...) as an approximate value of .

Book 3 of Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; deals with the properties of circles. Euclid&#x27;s definition of a circle is:
In Plato&#x27;s Seventh Letter there is a detailed definition and explanation of the circle. Plato explains the perfect circle, and how it is different from any drawing, words, definition or explanation. Early science, particularly geometry and astrology and astronomy, was connected to the divine for most medieval scholars, and many believed that there was something intrinsically &quot;divine&quot; or &quot;perfect&quot; that could be found in circles.

In 1880 CE, Ferdinand von Lindemann proved that is transcendental, proving that the millennia-old problem of squaring the circle cannot be performed with straightedge and compass.

With the advent of abstract art in the early 20th century, geometric objects became an artistic subject in their own right. Wassily Kandinsky in particular often used circles as an element of his compositions.

===Symbolism and religious use===

From the time of the earliest known civilisations – such as the Assyrians and ancient Egyptians, those in the Indus Valley and along the Yellow River in China, and the Western civilisations of ancient Greece and Rome during classical Antiquity – the circle has been used directly or indirectly in visual art to convey the artist&#x27;s message and to express certain ideas.
However, differences in worldview (beliefs and culture) had a great impact on artists&#x27; perceptions. While some emphasised the circle&#x27;s perimeter to demonstrate their democratic manifestation, others focused on its centre to symbolise the concept of cosmic unity. In mystical doctrines, the circle mainly symbolises the infinite and cyclical nature of existence, but in religious traditions it represents heavenly bodies and divine spirits.

The circle signifies many sacred and spiritual concepts, including unity, infinity, wholeness, the universe, divinity, balance, stability and perfection, among others. Such concepts have been conveyed in cultures worldwide through the use of symbols, for example, a compass, a halo, the vesica piscis and its derivatives (fish, eye, aureole, mandorla, etc.), the ouroboros, the Dharma wheel, a rainbow, mandalas, rose windows and so forth. Magic circles are part of some traditions of Western esotericism.

==Analytic results==
===Circumference===

The ratio of a circle&#x27;s circumference to its diameter is (pi), an irrational constant approximately equal to 3.141592654. The ratio of a circle&#x27;s circumference to its radius is . Thus the circumference &quot;C&quot; is related to the radius &quot;r&quot; and diameter &quot;d&quot; by:
formula_3

===Area enclosed===
As proved by Archimedes, in his Measurement of a Circle, the area enclosed by a circle is equal to that of a triangle whose base has the length of the circle&#x27;s circumference and whose height equals the circle&#x27;s radius, which comes to multiplied by the radius squared:
formula_4

Equivalently, denoting diameter by &quot;d&quot;,
formula_5
that is, approximately 79% of the circumscribing square (whose side is of length &quot;d&quot;).

The circle is the plane curve enclosing the maximum area for a given arc length. This relates the circle to a problem in the calculus of variations, namely the isoperimetric inequality.

===Radian===

If a circle of radius is centred at the vertex of an angle, and that angle intercepts an arc of the circle with an arc length of , then the radian measure of the angle is the ratio of the arc length to the radius:
formula_6

The circular arc is said to subtend the angle, known as the central angle, at the centre of the circle. The angle subtended by a complete circle at its centre is a complete angle, which measures radians, 360 degrees, or one turn.

Using radians, the formula for the arc length of a circular arc of radius and subtending a central angle of measure is
formula_7

and the formula for the area of a circular sector of radius and with central angle of measure is
formula_8

In the special case , these formulae yield the circumference of a complete circle and area of a complete disc, respectively.

===Equations===
==== Cartesian coordinates ====

===== Equation of a circle =====
In an &quot;x&quot;–&quot;y&quot; Cartesian coordinate system, the circle with centre coordinates (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) and radius &quot;r&quot; is the set of all points (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) such that
formula_9

This equation, known as the &quot;equation of the circle&quot;, follows from the Pythagorean theorem applied to any point on the circle: as shown in the adjacent diagram, the radius is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle whose other sides are of length |&quot;x&quot; − &quot;a&quot;| and |&quot;y&quot; − &quot;b&quot;|. If the circle is centred at the origin (0, 0), then the equation simplifies to
formula_10

===== One coordinate as a function of the other =====
The circle of radius with center at in the – plane can be broken into two semicircles each of which is the graph of a function, and , respectively:
formula_11
for values of ranging from to .

===== Parametric form =====
The equation can be written in parametric form using the trigonometric functions sine and cosine as
formula_12
where &quot;t&quot; is a parametric variable in the range 0 to 2, interpreted geometrically as the angle that the ray from (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) to (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) makes with the positive &quot;x&quot; axis.

An alternative parametrisation of the circle is
formula_13

In this parameterisation, the ratio of &quot;t&quot; to &quot;r&quot; can be interpreted geometrically as the stereographic projection of the line passing through the centre parallel to the &quot;x&quot; axis (see Tangent half-angle substitution). However, this parameterisation works only if &quot;t&quot; is made to range not only through all reals but also to a point at infinity; otherwise, the leftmost point of the circle would be omitted.

===== 3-point form =====
The equation of the circle determined by three points formula_14 not on a line is obtained by a conversion of the &quot;3-point form of a circle equation&quot;:
formula_15

===== Homogeneous form =====
In homogeneous coordinates, each conic section with the equation of a circle has the form
formula_16

It can be proven that a conic section is a circle exactly when it contains (when extended to the complex projective plane) the points &quot;I&quot;(1: &quot;i&quot;: 0) and &quot;J&quot;(1: −&quot;i&quot;: 0). These points are called the circular points at infinity.

====Polar coordinates====
In polar coordinates, the equation of a circle is
formula_17

where &quot;a&quot; is the radius of the circle, formula_18 are the polar coordinates of a generic point on the circle, and formula_19 are the polar coordinates of the centre of the circle (i.e., &quot;r&quot;0 is the distance from the origin to the centre of the circle, and &quot;φ&quot; is the anticlockwise angle from the positive &quot;x&quot; axis to the line connecting the origin to the centre of the circle). For a circle centred on the origin, i.e. , this reduces to . When , or when the origin lies on the circle, the equation becomes
formula_20

In the general case, the equation can be solved for &quot;r&quot;, giving
formula_21
Without the ± sign, the equation would in some cases describe only half a circle.

====Complex plane====
In the complex plane, a circle with a centre at &quot;c&quot; and radius &quot;r&quot; has the equation
formula_22

In parametric form, this can be written as
formula_23

The slightly generalised equation
formula_24

for real &quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot; and complex &quot;g&quot; is sometimes called a generalised circle. This becomes the above equation for a circle with formula_25, since formula_26. Not all generalised circles are actually circles: a generalised circle is either a (true) circle or a line.

===Tangent lines===

The tangent line through a point &quot;P&quot; on the circle is perpendicular to the diameter passing through &quot;P&quot;. If and the circle has centre (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) and radius &quot;r&quot;, then the tangent line is perpendicular to the line from (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) to (&quot;x&quot;1, &quot;y&quot;1), so it has the form . Evaluating at (&quot;x&quot;1, &quot;y&quot;1) determines the value of &quot;c&quot;, and the result is that the equation of the tangent is
formula_27
or
formula_28

If , then the slope of this line is
formula_29

This can also be found using implicit differentiation.

When the centre of the circle is at the origin, then the equation of the tangent line becomes
formula_30
and its slope is
formula_31

==Properties==
* The circle is the shape with the largest area for a given length of perimeter (see Isoperimetric inequality).
* The circle is a highly symmetric shape: every line through the centre forms a line of reflection symmetry, and it has rotational symmetry around the centre for every angle. Its symmetry group is the orthogonal group O(2,&quot;R&quot;). The group of rotations alone is the circle group T.
* All circles are similar.
** A circle circumference and radius are proportional.
** The area enclosed and the square of its radius are proportional.
** The constants of proportionality are 2 and respectively.
* The circle that is centred at the origin with radius 1 is called the unit circle.
** Thought of as a great circle of the unit sphere, it becomes the Riemannian circle.
* Through any three points, not all on the same line, there lies a unique circle. In Cartesian coordinates, it is possible to give explicit formulae for the coordinates of the centre of the circle and the radius in terms of the coordinates of the three given points. See circumcircle.

===Chord===
* Chords are equidistant from the centre of a circle if and only if they are equal in length.
* The perpendicular bisector of a chord passes through the centre of a circle; equivalent statements stemming from the uniqueness of the perpendicular bisector are:
** A perpendicular line from the centre of a circle bisects the chord.
** The line segment through the centre bisecting a chord is perpendicular to the chord.
* If a central angle and an inscribed angle of a circle are subtended by the same chord and on the same side of the chord, then the central angle is twice the inscribed angle.
* If two angles are inscribed on the same chord and on the same side of the chord, then they are equal.
* If two angles are inscribed on the same chord and on opposite sides of the chord, then they are supplementary.
** For a cyclic quadrilateral, the exterior angle is equal to the interior opposite angle.
* An inscribed angle subtended by a diameter is a right angle (see Thales&#x27; theorem).
* The diameter is the longest chord of the circle.
** Among all the circles with a chord AB in common, the circle with minimal radius is the one with diameter AB.
* If the intersection of any two chords divides one chord into lengths &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; and divides the other chord into lengths &quot;c&quot; and &quot;d&quot;, then .
* If the intersection of any two perpendicular chords divides one chord into lengths &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; and divides the other chord into lengths &quot;c&quot; and &quot;d&quot;, then equals the square of the diameter.
* The sum of the squared lengths of any two chords intersecting at right angles at a given point is the same as that of any other two perpendicular chords intersecting at the same point and is given by 8&quot;r&quot;2 − 4&quot;p&quot;2, where &quot;r&quot; is the circle radius, and &quot;p&quot; is the distance from the centre point to the point of intersection.
* The distance from a point on the circle to a given chord times the diameter of the circle equals the product of the distances from the point to the ends of the chord.

===Tangent===
* A line drawn perpendicular to a radius through the end point of the radius lying on the circle is a tangent to the circle.
* A line drawn perpendicular to a tangent through the point of contact with a circle passes through the centre of the circle.
* Two tangents can always be drawn to a circle from any point outside the circle, and these tangents are equal in length.
* If a tangent at &quot;A&quot; and a tangent at &quot;B&quot; intersect at the exterior point &quot;P&quot;, then denoting the centre as &quot;O&quot;, the angles ∠&quot;BOA&quot; and ∠&quot;BPA&quot; are supplementary.
* If &quot;AD&quot; is tangent to the circle at &quot;A&quot; and if &quot;AQ&quot; is a chord of the circle, then .

===Theorems===
* The chord theorem states that if two chords, &quot;CD&quot; and &quot;EB&quot;, intersect at &quot;A&quot;, then .
* If two secants, &quot;AE&quot; and &quot;AD&quot;, also cut the circle at &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; respectively, then (corollary of the chord theorem).
* A tangent can be considered a limiting case of a secant whose ends are coincident. If a tangent from an external point &quot;A&quot; meets the circle at &quot;F&quot; and a secant from the external point &quot;A&quot; meets the circle at &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; respectively, then (tangent–secant theorem).
* The angle between a chord and the tangent at one of its endpoints is equal to one half the angle subtended at the centre of the circle, on the opposite side of the chord (tangent chord angle).
* If the angle subtended by the chord at the centre is 90°, then , where &quot;ℓ&quot; is the length of the chord, and &quot;r&quot; is the radius of the circle.
* If two secants are inscribed in the circle as shown at right, then the measurement of angle &quot;A&quot; is equal to one half the difference of the measurements of the enclosed arcs (formula_32 and formula_33). That is, formula_34, where &quot;O&quot; is the centre of the circle (secant–secant theorem).

===Inscribed angles===
An inscribed angle (examples are the blue and green angles in the figure) is exactly half the corresponding central angle (red). Hence, all inscribed angles that subtend the same arc (pink) are equal. Angles inscribed on the arc (brown) are supplementary. In particular, every inscribed angle that subtends a diameter is a right angle (since the central angle is 180°).

===Sagitta===

The sagitta (also known as the versine) is a line segment drawn perpendicular to a chord, between the midpoint of that chord and the arc of the circle.

Given the length &quot;y&quot; of a chord and the length &quot;x&quot; of the sagitta, the Pythagorean theorem can be used to calculate the radius of the unique circle that will fit around the two lines:
formula_35

Another proof of this result, which relies only on two chord properties given above, is as follows. Given a chord of length &quot;y&quot; and with sagitta of length &quot;x&quot;, since the sagitta intersects the midpoint of the chord, we know that it is a part of a diameter of the circle. Since the diameter is twice the radius, the &quot;missing&quot; part of the diameter is () in length. Using the fact that one part of one chord times the other part is equal to the same product taken along a chord intersecting the first chord, we find that (. Solving for &quot;r&quot;, we find the required result.

==Compass and straightedge constructions==
There are many compass-and-straightedge constructions resulting in circles.

The simplest and most basic is the construction given the centre of the circle and a point on the circle. Place the fixed leg of the compass on the centre point, the movable leg on the point on the circle and rotate the compass.

===Construction with given diameter===
* Construct the midpoint of the diameter.
* Construct the circle with centre passing through one of the endpoints of the diameter (it will also pass through the other endpoint).

===Construction through three noncollinear points===
* Name the points , and ,
* Construct the perpendicular bisector of the segment .
* Construct the perpendicular bisector of the segment .
* Label the point of intersection of these two perpendicular bisectors . (They meet because the points are not collinear).
* Construct the circle with centre passing through one of the points , or (it will also pass through the other two points).

==Circle of Apollonius==

Apollonius of Perga showed that a circle may also be defined as the set of points in a plane having a constant &quot;ratio&quot; (other than 1) of distances to two fixed foci, &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;. (The set of points where the distances are equal is the perpendicular bisector of segment &quot;AB&quot;, a line.) That circle is sometimes said to be drawn &quot;about&quot; two points.

The proof is in two parts. First, one must prove that, given two foci &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; and a ratio of distances, any point &quot;P&quot; satisfying the ratio of distances must fall on a particular circle. Let &quot;C&quot; be another point, also satisfying the ratio and lying on segment &quot;AB&quot;. By the angle bisector theorem the line segment &quot;PC&quot; will bisect the interior angle &quot;APB&quot;, since the segments are similar:
formula_36

Analogously, a line segment &quot;PD&quot; through some point &quot;D&quot; on &quot;AB&quot; extended bisects the corresponding exterior angle &quot;BPQ&quot; where &quot;Q&quot; is on &quot;AP&quot; extended. Since the interior and exterior angles sum to 180 degrees, the angle &quot;CPD&quot; is exactly 90 degrees; that is, a right angle. The set of points &quot;P&quot; such that angle &quot;CPD&quot; is a right angle forms a circle, of which &quot;CD&quot; is a diameter.

Second, see for a proof that every point on the indicated circle satisfies the given ratio.

===Cross-ratios===
A closely related property of circles involves the geometry of the cross-ratio of points in the complex plane. If &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, and &quot;C&quot; are as above, then the circle of Apollonius for these three points is the collection of points &quot;P&quot; for which the absolute value of the cross-ratio is equal to one:
formula_37

Stated another way, &quot;P&quot; is a point on the circle of Apollonius if and only if the cross-ratio is on the unit circle in the complex plane.

=== Generalised circles===

If &quot;C&quot; is the midpoint of the segment &quot;AB&quot;, then the collection of points &quot;P&quot; satisfying the Apollonius condition
formula_38
is not a circle, but rather a line.

Thus, if &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, and &quot;C&quot; are given distinct points in the plane, then the locus of points &quot;P&quot; satisfying the above equation is called a &quot;generalised circle.&quot; It may either be a true circle or a line. In this sense a line is a generalised circle of infinite radius.

==Inscription in or circumscription about other figures==
In every triangle a unique circle, called the incircle, can be inscribed such that it is tangent to each of the three sides of the triangle.

About every triangle a unique circle, called the circumcircle, can be circumscribed such that it goes through each of the triangle&#x27;s three vertices.

A tangential polygon, such as a tangential quadrilateral, is any convex polygon within which a circle can be inscribed that is tangent to each side of the polygon. Every regular polygon and every triangle is a tangential polygon.

A cyclic polygon is any convex polygon about which a circle can be circumscribed, passing through each vertex. A well-studied example is the cyclic quadrilateral. Every regular polygon and every triangle is a cyclic polygon. A polygon that is both cyclic and tangential is called a bicentric polygon.

A hypocycloid is a curve that is inscribed in a given circle by tracing a fixed point on a smaller circle that rolls within and tangent to the given circle.

==Limiting case of other figures==
The circle can be viewed as a limiting case of various other figures:
* The series of regular polygons with &quot;n&quot; sides has the circle as its limit as &quot;n&quot; approaches infinity. This fact was applied by Archimedes to approximate π.
* A Cartesian oval is a set of points such that a weighted sum of the distances from any of its points to two fixed points (foci) is a constant. An ellipse is the case in which the weights are equal. A circle is an ellipse with an eccentricity of zero, meaning that the two foci coincide with each other as the centre of the circle. A circle is also a different special case of a Cartesian oval in which one of the weights is zero.
* A superellipse has an equation of the form formula_39 for positive &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;n&quot;. A supercircle has . A circle is the special case of a supercircle in which .
* A Cassini oval is a set of points such that the product of the distances from any of its points to two fixed points is a constant. When the two fixed points coincide, a circle results.
* A curve of constant width is a figure whose width, defined as the perpendicular distance between two distinct parallel lines each intersecting its boundary in a single point, is the same regardless of the direction of those two parallel lines. The circle is the simplest example of this type of figure.

==Locus of constant sum==
Consider a finite set of formula_40 points in the plane. The locus of points such that the sum of the squares of the distances to the given points is constant is a circle, whose centre is at the centroid of the given points.
A generalisation for higher powers of distances is obtained if, instead of formula_40 points, the vertices of the regular polygon formula_42 are taken. The locus of points such that the sum of the formula_43-th power of distances formula_44 to the vertices of a given regular polygon with circumradius formula_45 is constant is a circle, if
formula_46
whose centre is the centroid of the formula_42.

In the case of the equilateral triangle, the loci of the constant sums of the second and fourth powers are circles, whereas for the square, the loci are circles for the constant sums of the second, fourth, and sixth powers. For the regular pentagon the constant sum of the eighth powers of the distances will be added and so forth.

==Squaring the circle==

Squaring the circle is the problem, proposed by ancient geometers, of constructing a square with the same area as a given circle by using only a finite number of steps with compass and straightedge.

In 1882, the task was proven to be impossible, as a consequence of the Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem, which proves that pi () is a transcendental number, rather than an algebraic irrational number; that is, it is not the root of any polynomial with rational coefficients. Despite the impossibility, this topic continues to be of interest for pseudomath enthusiasts.

== Generalisations ==
===In other &quot;p&quot;-norms===

Defining a circle as the set of points with a fixed distance from a point, different shapes can be considered circles under different definitions of distance. In &quot;p&quot;-norm, distance is determined by
formula_48
In Euclidean geometry, &quot;p&quot; = 2, giving the familiar
formula_49

In taxicab geometry, &quot;p&quot; = 1. Taxicab circles are squares with sides oriented at a 45° angle to the coordinate axes. While each side would have length formula_50 using a Euclidean metric, where &quot;r&quot; is the circle&#x27;s radius, its length in taxicab geometry is 2&quot;r&quot;. Thus, a circle&#x27;s circumference is 8&quot;r&quot;. Thus, the value of a geometric analog to formula_51 is 4 in this geometry. The formula for the unit circle in taxicab geometry is formula_52 in Cartesian coordinates and
formula_53
in polar coordinates.

A circle of radius 1 (using this distance) is the von Neumann neighborhood of its centre.

A circle of radius &quot;r&quot; for the Chebyshev distance (&quot;L&quot;∞ metric) on a plane is also a square with side length 2&quot;r&quot; parallel to the coordinate axes, so planar Chebyshev distance can be viewed as equivalent by rotation and scaling to planar taxicab distance. However, this equivalence between &quot;L&quot;1 and &quot;L&quot;∞ metrics does not generalise to higher dimensions.

===Topological definition===
The circle is the one-dimensional hypersphere (the 1-sphere).

In topology, a circle is not limited to the geometric concept, but to all of its homeomorphisms. Two topological circles are equivalent if one can be transformed into the other via a deformation of R3 upon itself (known as an ambient isotopy).

<doc id="6221" wikidata="Q45722" url="?curid=6221" title="Cardinal (Catholic Church)">
<text>A cardinal () is a senior member of the clergy of the Catholic Church. As titular members of the clergy of the Diocese of Rome, they serve as advisors to the pope, who is the bishop of Rome. Cardinals are chosen and formally created by the pope, and typically hold the title for life. Collectively, they constitute the College of Cardinals. The most solemn responsibility of the cardinals is to elect a new pope in a conclave, almost always from among themselves (with a few historical exceptions), when the Holy See is vacant. During the period between a pope&#x27;s death or resignation and the election of his successor, the day-to-day governance of the Holy See is in the hands of the College of Cardinals. The right to participate in a conclave is limited to cardinals who have not reached the age of 80 years by the day the vacancy occurs. In addition, cardinals collectively participate in papal consistories, in which matters of importance to the Church are considered and new cardinals may be created. Cardinals of working age are also appointed to roles overseeing dicasteries of the Roman Curia, the central administration of the Catholic Church.

Cardinals are drawn from a variety of backgrounds, being appointed as cardinals in addition to their existing roles within the Church. Most cardinals are bishops and archbishops leading dioceses and archdioceses around the world – often the most prominent diocese or archdiocese in their country. Others are titular bishops who are current or former officials within the Roman Curia (generally the heads of dicasteries and other bodies linked to the Curia). A very small number are priests recognised by the pope for their service to the Church; as canon law requires them to be generally consecrated as bishops before they are made cardinals, but some are granted a papal dispensation. There are no strict criteria for elevation to the College of Cardinals. Since 1917, a potential cardinal must already be at least a priest, but laymen have been cardinals in the past. The selection is entirely up to the pope, and tradition is his only guide.

 there are serving cardinals, of whom are eligible to vote in a conclave to elect a new pope.

==History==

There is general disagreement about the origin of the term, but a chief consensus is that the Latin comes from the term (meaning &#x27;pivot&#x27; or &#x27;hinge&#x27;), and was first used in late antiquity to designate a bishop or priest who was incorporated into a church for which he had not originally been ordained. In Rome the first persons to be called cardinals were the deacons of the seven regions of the city at the beginning of the 6th century, when the word began to mean &#x27;principal&#x27;, &#x27;eminent&#x27;, or &#x27;superior&#x27;. The name was also given to the senior priest in each of the &quot;title&quot; churches (the parish churches) of Rome and to the bishops of the seven sees surrounding the city. By the 8th century the Roman cardinals constituted a privileged class among the Roman clergy. They took part in the administration of the Church of Rome and in the papal liturgy. By decree of a synod of 769, only a cardinal was eligible to become Bishop of Rome. Cardinals were granted the privilege of wearing the red hat by Pope Innocent IV in 1244.

In cities other than Rome, the name cardinal began to be applied to certain churchmen as a mark of honour. The earliest example of this occurs in a letter sent by Pope Zacharias in 747 to Pippin the Younger, ruler of the Franks, in which Zacharias applied the title to the priests of Paris to distinguish them from country clergy. This meaning of the word spread rapidly, and from the 9th century various episcopal cities had a special class among the clergy known as cardinals. The use of the title was reserved for the cardinals of Rome in 1567 by Pius V.

In 1059 (five years after the East-West Schism), the right of electing the pope was reserved to the principal clergy of Rome and the bishops of the seven suburbicarian sees. In the 12th century the practice of appointing ecclesiastics from outside Rome as cardinals began, with each of them assigned a church in Rome as his titular church or linked with one of the suburbicarian dioceses, while still being incardinated in a diocese other than that of Rome.

The term &quot;cardinal&quot; at one time applied to any priest permanently assigned or incardinated to a church, or specifically to the senior priest of an important church, based on the Latin (&#x27;hinge&#x27;), meaning &#x27;pivotal&#x27; as in &quot;principal&quot; or &quot;chief&quot;. The term was applied in this sense as early as the 9th century to the priests of the (parishes) of the diocese of Rome.

In the year 1563, the Ecumenical Council of Trent, headed by Pope Pius IV, wrote about the importance of selecting good cardinals: &quot;nothing is more necessary to the Church of God than that the holy Roman pontiff apply that solicitude which by the duty of his office he owes the universal Church in a very special way by associating with himself as cardinals the most select persons only, and appoint to each church most eminently upright and competent shepherds; and this the more so, because our Lord Jesus Christ will require at his hands the blood of the sheep of Christ that perish through the evil government of shepherds who are negligent and forgetful of their office.&quot;

The earlier influence of temporal rulers, notably the kings of France, reasserted itself through the influence of cardinals of certain nationalities or politically significant movements. Traditions even developed entitling certain monarchs, including those of Austria, Spain, and France, to nominate one of their trusted clerical subjects to be created cardinal, a so-called &quot;crown-cardinal&quot;.

In early modern times, cardinals often had important roles in secular affairs. In some cases, they took on powerful positions in government. In Henry VIII&#x27;s England, his chief minister was for some time Cardinal Wolsey. Cardinal Richelieu&#x27;s power was so great that he was for many years effectively the ruler of France. Richelieu&#x27;s successor was also a cardinal, Jules Mazarin. Guillaume Dubois and André-Hercule de Fleury complete the list of the four great cardinals to have ruled France. In Portugal, due to a succession crisis, one cardinal, Henry of Portugal, was crowned king, the only example of a cardinal-king (although John II Casimir Vasa was a cardinal from 1646 until he resigned in 1647, later being elected and crowned King of Poland, in 1648 and 1649, respectively).

While the incumbents of some sees are regularly made cardinals, and some countries are entitled to at least one cardinal by concordat (usually earning either its primate or the metropolitan of the capital city the cardinal&#x27;s hat), almost no see carries an actual right to the cardinalate, not even if its bishop is a patriarch: the notable exception is the Patriarch of Lisbon who, by Pope Clement XII&#x27;s 1737 bull , is accorded the right to be elevated to the rank of cardinal in the consistory following his appointment.

==Papal elections==

In 1059, Pope Nicholas II gave cardinals the right to elect the Bishop of Rome in the papal bull . For a time this power was assigned exclusively to the cardinal bishops, but in 1179 the Third Lateran Council restored the right to the whole body of cardinals.

==Numbers==

In 1586, Pope Sixtus V limited the number of cardinals to 70: six cardinal bishops, 50 cardinal priests, and 14 cardinal deacons. Pope John XXIII exceeded that limit citing the need to staff church offices. In November 1970, in , Pope Paul VI established that electors would be under the age of 80 years. When it took effect on 1 January 1971, it deprived 25 cardinals of the right to participate in a conclave. In October 1975 in , he set the maximum number of electors at 120, while establishing no limit on the overall size of the college.

Popes can set aside church laws and they have regularly brought the number of cardinals under the age of 80 to more than 120, twice reaching as high as 135 with Pope John Paul II&#x27;s consistories of February 2001 and October 2003. No more than 120 electors have ever participated in a conclave, but most canon lawyers believe that if their number exceeded 120 they would all participate.

Pope Paul VI also increased the number of cardinal bishops by assigning that rank, in 1965, to patriarchs of the Eastern Catholic Churches when named cardinals. In 2018, Pope Francis expanded the cardinal bishops of Roman title, because this had not been done despite recent decades&#x27; expansion in the two lower orders of cardinals, besides having all six such cardinals being over the age limit for a conclave.

==Titular churches==

Each cardinal is assigned a titular church upon his creation, which is always a church in the city of Rome. Through the process of opting (), a cardinal can rise through the ranks from cardinal deacon to priest, and from cardinal priest to that of cardinal bishop – in which case he obtains one of the suburbicarian sees located around the city of Rome. The only exception is for patriarchs of the Eastern Catholic Churches. Nevertheless, cardinals possess no power of governance nor are they to intervene in any way in matters which pertain to the administration of goods, discipline, or the service of their titular churches. They are allowed to celebrate Mass and hear confessions and lead visits and pilgrimages to their titular churches, in coordination with the staff of the church. They often support their churches monetarily, and many cardinals do keep in contact with the pastoral staffs of their titular churches.

The Dean of the College of Cardinals in addition to such a titular church also receives the titular bishopric of Ostia, the primary suburbicarian see. Cardinals governing a particular church retain that church.

==Title and reference style==

In 1630, Pope Urban VIII decreed their title to be &quot;Eminence&quot; (previously, it had been and ) and decreed that their secular rank would equate to prince, making them second only to the pope and crowned monarchs.

In accordance with tradition, they sign by placing the title &quot;Cardinal&quot; (abbreviated &quot;Card.&quot;) after their personal name and before their surname as, for instance, &quot;John Card(inal) Doe&quot; or, in Latin, &quot;Ioannes Card(inalis) Doe&quot;. Some writers, such as James-Charles Noonan, hold that, in the case of cardinals, the form used for signatures should be used also when referring to them in English. However, official sources, such as the Catholic News Service, say that the correct form for referring to a cardinal in English is normally as &quot;Cardinal [First name] [Surname]&quot;. This is the rule given also in stylebooks not associated with the church. This style is also generally followed on the websites of the Holy See and episcopal conferences. Oriental patriarchs who are created cardinals customarily use as their full title, probably because they do not belong to the Roman clergy.

The &quot;[First name] Cardinal [Surname]&quot; order is used in the Latin proclamation of the election of a new pope by the cardinal protodeacon, if the new pope is a cardinal, as has been the case since 1389.

The term &quot;Prince of the Church&quot; has historically been applied to cardinals of the Catholic church, and sometimes more broadly to senior members of the church hierarchy. It has been rejected by Pope Francis, who stated to a group of newly created cardinals &quot;He (Jesus) does not call you to become &#x27;princes&#x27; of the Church, to &#x27;sit on his right or on his left.&#x27; He calls you to serve like Him and with Him.&quot; The term is still applied, both seriously and as a criticism of the perceived attitudes of some cardinals.

== Orders and their chief offices ==

=== Cardinal bishops ===

Cardinal bishops (cardinals of the episcopal order; ) are the senior order of cardinals. Though in modern times the vast majority of cardinals are also bishops or archbishops, few are &quot;cardinal bishops&quot;. For most of the second millennium there were six cardinal bishops, each presiding over one of the seven suburbicarian sees around Rome: Ostia, Albano, Porto and Santa Rufina, Palestrina, Sabina and Mentana, Frascati, and Velletri. Velletri was united with Ostia from 1150 until 1914, when Pope Pius X separated them again, but decreed that whichever cardinal bishop became Dean of the College of Cardinals would keep the suburbicarian see he already held, adding to it that of Ostia, with the result that there continued to be only six cardinal bishops. Since 1962, the cardinal bishops have only a titular relationship with the suburbicarian sees, each of which is governed by a separate ordinary.

Until 1961, membership in the order of cardinal bishops was achieved through precedence in the College of Cardinals. When a suburbicarian see fell vacant, the most senior cardinal by precedence could exercise his option to claim the see and be promoted to the order of cardinal bishops. Pope John XXIII abolished that privilege on 10 March 1961 and made the right to promote someone to the order of cardinal bishops the sole prerogative of the pope.

In 1965, Pope Paul VI decreed in his that patriarchs of the Eastern Catholic Churches who were named cardinals (i.e. &quot;cardinal patriarchs&quot;) would also be cardinal bishops, ranking after the six Latin Church cardinal bishops of the suburbicarian sees. (Latin Church patriarchs who become cardinals are cardinal priests, not cardinal bishops: for example Angelo Scola was made Patriarch of Venice in 2002 and cardinal priest of Santi XII Apostoli in 2003.) Those of cardinal patriarch rank continue to hold their patriarchal see and are not assigned any Roman title (suburbicarian see or title or deaconry).

At the June 2018 consistory, Pope Francis increased the number of Latin Church cardinal bishops to match the expansion in cardinal priests and cardinal deacons in recent decades. He elevated four cardinals to this rank granting their titular churches and deaconries suburbicarian rank (temporarily) and making them equivalent to suburbicarian see titles. At the time of the announcement, all six cardinal bishops of suburbicarian see titles, as well as two of the three cardinal patriarchs, were non-electors as they had reached the age of 80. Pope Francis created another cardinal bishop in the same way on 1 May 2020, bringing the number of Latin Church cardinal bishops to 11.

The Dean of the College of Cardinals, the highest ranking cardinal, was formerly the longest serving cardinal bishop, but since 1965 is elected by the Latin Church cardinal bishops from among their number, subject to papal approval. Likewise the Vice-Dean, formerly the second longest serving, is also elected. Seniority of the remaining Latin Church cardinal bishops is still by date of appointment to the rank. The current Dean is Giovanni Battista Re and the Vice-Dean is Leonardo Sandri.

=== Cardinal priests ===

Cardinal priests () are the most numerous of the three orders of cardinals in the Catholic Church, ranking above the cardinal deacons and below the cardinal bishops. Those who are named cardinal priests today are generally also bishops of important dioceses throughout the world, though some hold Curial positions.

In modern times, the term &quot;cardinal priest&quot; is interpreted as meaning a cardinal who is of the order of priests. Originally, however, this referred to certain key priests of important churches of the Diocese of Rome, who were recognized as the priests – the important priests chosen by the pope to advise him in his duties as Bishop of Rome. Certain clerics in many dioceses at the time, not just that of Rome, were said to be the key personnel—the term gradually became exclusive to Rome to indicate those entrusted with electing the Bishop of Rome, the pope.

While the cardinalate has long been expanded beyond the Roman pastoral clergy and Roman Curia, every cardinal priest has a titular church in Rome, though they may be bishops or archbishops elsewhere, just as cardinal bishops were given one of the suburbicarian dioceses around Rome. Pope Paul VI abolished all administrative rights cardinals had with regard to their titular churches, though the cardinal&#x27;s name and coat of arms are still posted in the church, and they are expected to celebrate Mass and preach there if convenient when they are in Rome.

While the number of cardinals was small from the times of the Roman Empire to the Renaissance, and frequently smaller than the number of recognized churches entitled to a cardinal priest, in the 16th century the college expanded markedly. In 1587, Pope Sixtus V sought to arrest this growth by fixing the maximum size of the college at 70, including 50 cardinal priests, about twice the historical number. This limit was respected until 1958, and the list of titular churches modified only on rare occasions, generally when a building fell into disrepair. When Pope John XXIII abolished the limit, he began to add new churches to the list, which Popes Paul VI and John Paul II continued to do. Today there are close to 150 titular churches, out of over 300 churches in Rome.

The cardinal who is the longest-serving member of the order of cardinal priests is titled &quot;cardinal protopriest&quot;. He had certain ceremonial duties in the conclave that have effectively ceased because he would generally have already reached age 80, at which cardinals are barred from the conclave. The current cardinal protopriest is Michael Michai Kitbunchu of Thailand.

=== Cardinal deacons ===

The cardinal deacons () are the lowest-ranking cardinals. Cardinals elevated to the diaconal order are either officials of the Roman Curia or priests elevated after their 80th birthday, chosen mainly for the honor of it (since those over 80 are not able to vote in a conclave). While bishops with diocesan responsibilities are created cardinal priests, it is generally not so for cardinal deacons.

Cardinal deacons derive originally from the seven deacons in the Papal Household who supervised the church&#x27;s works in the 14 districts of Rome during the early Middle Ages, when church administration was effectively the government of Rome and provided all social services. They came to be called &quot;cardinal deacons&quot; by the late eighth century, and they were granted active rights in papal elections and made eligible for the election as pope by the decree of 769.

Cardinals elevated to the diaconal order are mainly officials of the Roman Curia holding various posts in the church administration. Their number and influence has varied through the years. While historically predominantly Italian, the group has become much more internationally diverse in later years. While in 1939 about half were Italian, by 1994 the number was reduced to one third. Their influence in the election of the pope has been considered important. They are better informed and connected than the dislocated cardinals but their level of unity has been varied. Under the 1587 decree of Pope Sixtus V, which fixed the maximum size of the College of Cardinals, there were 14 cardinal deacons. Later the number increased. As late as 1939 almost half of the cardinals were members of the Curia. Pius XII reduced this percentage to 24 percent. John XXIII brought it back up to 37 percent but Paul VI brought it down to 27 percent. John Paul II maintained this ratio.

As of 2005, there were over 50 churches recognized as cardinalatial deaconries, though there were only 30 cardinals of the order of deacons. Cardinal deacons have long enjoyed the right to &quot;opt for the order of cardinal priests&quot; () after they have been cardinal deacons for 10 years. They may on such elevation take a vacant &quot;title&quot; (a church allotted to a cardinal priest as the church in Rome with which he is associated) or their diaconal church may be temporarily elevated to a cardinal priest&#x27;s &quot;title&quot; for that occasion. When elevated to cardinal priests, they take their precedence according to the day they were first made cardinal deacons (thus ranking above cardinal priests who were elevated to the college after them, regardless of order).

When not celebrating Mass, but still serving a liturgical function, such as the semiannual papal blessing, some Papal Masses and some events at Ecumenical Councils, cardinal deacons can be recognized by the dalmatics they would don with the simple white mitre (so called ).

==== Cardinal protodeacon ====

The cardinal protodeacon is the senior cardinal deacon in order of appointment to the College of Cardinals. If he is a cardinal elector and participates in a conclave, he announces a new pope&#x27;s election and name from the central balcony of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Vatican City. The protodeacon also bestows the pallium on the new pope and crowns him with the papal tiara, although the crowning has not been celebrated since Pope John Paul I opted for a simpler papal inauguration ceremony in 1978. The current cardinal protodeacon is Dominique Mamberti.

==Special types of cardinals==

===Camerlengo===

The Cardinal Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church, assisted by the Vice-Camerlengo and the other prelates of the office known as the Apostolic Camera, has functions that in essence are limited to a period of of the papacy. He is to collate information about the financial situation of all administrations dependent on the Holy See and present the results to the College of Cardinals, as they gather for the papal conclave.

===Cardinals who are not bishops===

Until 1918, any cleric, even one only in minor orders, could be created a cardinal (see &quot;lay cardinals&quot;, below), but enrolled only in the order of cardinal deacons. For example, in the 16th century, Reginald Pole was a cardinal for 18 years before he was ordained a priest. The 1917 Code of Canon Law mandated that all cardinals, even cardinal deacons, had to be priests, and, in 1962, Pope John XXIII set the norm that all cardinals be consecrated as bishops, even if they are only priests at the time of appointment. As a consequence of these two changes, canon 351 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law requires that a cardinal be at least in the order of priesthood at his appointment, and that those who are not already bishops must receive episcopal consecration. Several cardinals near to or over the age of 80 when appointed have obtained dispensation from the rule of having to be a bishop. These were all appointed cardinal-deacons, but Roberto Tucci and Albert Vanhoye lived long enough to exercise the right of option and be promoted to the rank of cardinal-priest. No cardinal who was not a bishop has participated in a papal conclave since the 1962 rule change.

A cardinal who is not a bishop is entitled to wear and use the episcopal vestments and other pontificalia (episcopal regalia: mitre, crozier, zucchetto, pectoral cross, and ring). He has both actual and honorary precedence over archbishops, and bishops who are not cardinals. However, he cannot perform the sacrament of ordination or other rites reserved solely to bishops.

===&quot;Lay cardinals&quot;===

At various times, there have been cardinals who had only received first tonsure and minor orders but not yet been ordained as deacons or priests. Though clerics, they were inaccurately called &quot;lay cardinals&quot;. Teodolfo Mertel was among the last of the lay cardinals. When he died in 1899 he was the last surviving cardinal who was not at least ordained a priest. With the revision of the Code of Canon Law promulgated in 1917 by Pope Benedict XV, only those who are already priests or bishops may be appointed cardinals. Since the time of Pope John XXIII a priest who is appointed a cardinal must be consecrated a bishop, unless he obtains a dispensation.

=== Cardinals or secret cardinals ===
In addition to the named cardinals, the pope may name secret cardinals or cardinals (Latin for &#x27;in the breast&#x27;). During the Western Schism, many cardinals were created by the contending popes. Beginning with the reign of Pope Martin V, cardinals were created without publishing their names until later, a practice termed . A cardinal named is known only to the pope. In the modern era, popes have named cardinals to protect them or their congregations from political reprisals. If conditions change, the pope makes the appointment public. The cardinal in question then ranks in precedence with those made cardinals at the time of his appointment. If a pope dies before revealing the identity of an cardinal, the person&#x27;s status as cardinal expires. The last pope known to have named a cardinal is Pope John Paul II, who named four, including one whose identity was never revealed.

==Vesture and privileges==

When in choir dress, a Latin Church cardinal wears scarlet garments—the blood-like red symbolizes a cardinal&#x27;s willingness to die for his faith. Excluding the rochet—which is always white—the scarlet garments include the cassock, mozzetta, and biretta (over the usual scarlet zucchetto). The biretta of a cardinal is distinctive not merely for its scarlet color, but also for the fact that it does not have a pompom or tassel on the top as do the birettas of other prelates. Until the 1460s, it was customary for cardinals to wear a violet or blue cape unless granted the privilege of wearing red when acting on papal business. His normal-wear cassock is black but has scarlet piping and a scarlet fascia (sash). Occasionally, a cardinal wears a scarlet which is a cape worn over the shoulders, tied at the neck in a bow by narrow strips of cloth in the front, without any &#x27;trim&#x27; or piping on it. It is because of the scarlet color of cardinals&#x27; vesture that the bird of the same name has become known as such.

Eastern Catholic cardinals continue to wear the normal dress appropriate to their liturgical tradition, though some may line their cassocks with scarlet and wear scarlet fascias, or in some cases, wear Eastern-style cassocks entirely of scarlet.

In previous times, at the consistory at which the pope named a new cardinal, he would bestow upon him a distinctive wide-brimmed hat called a galero. This custom was discontinued in 1969 and the investiture now takes place with the scarlet biretta. In ecclesiastical heraldry, however, the scarlet galero is still displayed on the cardinal&#x27;s coat of arms. Cardinals had the right to display the galero in their cathedral, and when a cardinal died, it would be suspended from the ceiling above his tomb. Some cardinals will still have a galero made, even though it is not officially part of their apparel.

To symbolize their bond with the papacy, the pope gives each newly appointed cardinal a gold ring, which is traditionally kissed by Catholics when greeting a cardinal (as with a bishop&#x27;s episcopal ring). Before the new uniformity imposed by John Paul II, each cardinal was given a ring, the central piece of which was a gem, usually a sapphire, with the pope&#x27;s stemma engraved on the inside. There is now no gemstone, and the pope chooses the image on the outside: under Pope Benedict XVI it was a modern depiction of the crucifixion of Jesus, with Mary and John to each side. The ring includes the pope&#x27;s coat of arms on the inside.

Cardinals have in canon law a &quot;privilege of forum&quot; (i.e., exemption from being judged by ecclesiastical tribunals of ordinary rank): only the pope is competent to judge them in matters subject to ecclesiastical jurisdiction (cases that refer to matters that are spiritual or linked with the spiritual, or with regard to infringement of ecclesiastical laws and whatever contains an element of sin, where culpability must be determined and the appropriate
ecclesiastical penalty imposed). The pope either decides the case himself or delegates the decision to a tribunal, usually one of the tribunals or congregations of the Roman Curia. Without such delegation, no ecclesiastical court, even the Roman Rota, is competent to judge a canon law case against a cardinal.

Additionally, canon law gives cardinals the faculty of hearing confessions validly and licitly everywhere, whereas other priests and bishops must be granted this faculty and might be restricted in its use by the local bishop.

<text>The Cantigas de Santa Maria (, ; &quot;Canticles of Holy Mary&quot;) are 420 poems with musical notation, written in the medieval Galician-Portuguese language during the reign of Alfonso X of Castile &quot;El Sabio&quot; (1221–1284). Traditionally, they are all attributed to Alfonso, though scholars have since established that the musicians and poets of his court were responsible for most of them, with Alfonso being credited with a few as well.

It is one of the largest collections of monophonic (solo) songs from the Middle Ages and is characterized by the mention of the Virgin Mary in every song, while every tenth song is a hymn.

The &quot;Cantigas&quot; have survived in four manuscript codices: two at El Escorial, one at Madrid&#x27;s National Library, and one in Florence, Italy. The E codex from El Escorial is illuminated with colored miniatures showing pairs of musicians playing a wide variety of instruments. The &quot;Códice Rico&quot; (T) from El Escorial and the one in the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale of Florence (F) are richly illuminated with narrative vignettes.

==Description==
The Cantigas are written in the early Medieval Galician variety of Galician-Portuguese, using Galician spelling; this was because of Galician-Portuguese being fashionable as a lyrical language in Castile at the time, as well as Alfonso X having passed part of his early years in Galicia and so probably being a fluent speaker since his childhood.

The Cantigas are a collection of 420 poems, 356 of which are in a narrative format relating to Marian miracles; the rest of them, except an introduction and two prologues, are of songs of praise or involve Marian festivities. The Cantigas depict the Virgin Mary in a very humanized way, often having her play a role in earthly episodes.

The authors are unknown, although several studies have suggested that Galician poet Airas Nunes might have been the author of a large number of the Cantiga poems. King Alfonso X — named as Affonso in the Cantigas — is also believed to be an author of some of them as he refers himself in first person. Support for this theory can be found in the prologue of the Cantigas. Also, many sources credit Alfonso owing to his influence on other works within the poetic tradition, including his introduction on religious song. Although King Alfonso X&#x27;s authorship is debatable, his influence is not. While the other major works that came out of Alfonso&#x27;s workshops, including histories and other prose texts, were in Castilian, the Cantigas are in Galician-Portuguese, and reflect the popularity in the Castilian court of other poetic corpuses such as the &quot;cantigas d&#x27;amigo&quot; and &quot;cantigas d&#x27;amor&quot;.

The metrics are extraordinarily diverse: 280 different formats for the 420 Cantigas. The most common are the &quot;virelai&quot; and the &quot;rondeau&quot;. The length of the lines varies between two and 24 syllables. The narrative voice in many of the songs describes an erotic relationship, in the troubadour fashion, with the Divine.
The music is written in notation which is similar to that used for chant, but also contains some information about the length of the notes. Several transcriptions exist. The Cantigas are frequently recorded and performed by early music groups, and quite a few CDs featuring music from the Cantigas are available.

===Codices===

The Cantigas are preserved in four manuscripts:

* &quot;To&quot; (&quot;códice de Toledo,&quot; Biblioteca Nacional de España, MS 10069, link to manuscript)
* &quot;T&quot; (&quot;códice rico,&quot; Biblioteca de El Escorial, MS T.I.1, link to manuscript)
* &quot;F&quot; (&quot;códice de Florencia,&quot; Florence, Biblioteca Nazionale, MS b.r. 20, link to manuscript)
* &quot;E&quot; (&quot;códice de los músicos,&quot; Biblioteca de El Escorial MS B.I.2, link to manuscript)

&quot;E&quot; contains the largest number of songs (406 Cantigas, plus the Introduction and the Prologue); it contains 41 carefully detailed miniatures and many illuminated letters. &quot;To&quot; is the earliest collection and contains 129 songs. Although not illustrated, it is richly decorated with pen flourished initials, and great care has been taken over its construction. The &quot;T&quot; and &quot;F&quot; manuscripts are sister volumes. &quot;T&quot; contains 195 surviving cantigas (8 are missing due to loss of folios) which roughly correspond in order to the first two hundred in &quot;E&quot;, each song being illustrated with either 6 or 12 miniatures that depict scenes from the cantiga. &quot;F&quot; follows the same format but has only 111 cantigas, of which 7 have no text, only miniatures. These are basically a subset of those found in the second half of &quot;E&quot;, but are presented here in a radically different order. &quot;F&quot; was never finished, and so no music was ever added. Only the empty staves display the intention to add musical notation to the codex at a later date. It is generally thought that the codices were constructed during Alfonso&#x27;s lifetime, &quot;To&quot; perhaps in the 1270s, and &quot;T&quot;/&quot;F&quot; and &quot;E&quot; in the early 1280s up until the time of his death in 1284.

===The music===

The musical forms within the Cantigas, and there are many, are still being studied. There have been many false leads, and there is little beyond pitch value that is very reliable. Mensuration is a particular problem in the Cantigas, and most attempts at determining meaningful rhythmic schemes have tended, with some exceptions, to be unsatisfactory. This remains a lively topic of debate and study. Progress, while on-going, has nevertheless been significant over the course of the last 20 years.

<doc id="6226" wikidata="Q53068" url="?curid=6226" title="Claudio Monteverdi">
<text>Claudio Giovanni Antonio Monteverdi (baptized 15 May 1567 – 29 November 1643) was an Italian composer, choirmaster and string player. A composer of both secular and sacred music, and a pioneer in the development of opera, he is considered a crucial transitional figure between the Renaissance and Baroque periods of music history.

Born in Cremona, where he undertook his first musical studies and compositions, Monteverdi developed his career first at the court of Mantua () and then until his death in the Republic of Venice where he was &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; at the basilica of San Marco. His surviving letters give insight into the life of a professional musician in Italy of the period, including problems of income, patronage and politics.

Much of Monteverdi&#x27;s output, including many stage works, has been lost. His surviving music includes nine books of madrigals, large-scale religious works, such as his &quot;Vespro della Beata Vergine&quot; (&quot;Vespers for the Blessed Virgin&quot;) of 1610, and three complete operas. His opera &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot; (1607) is the earliest of the genre still widely performed; towards the end of his life he wrote works for Venice, including &quot;Il ritorno d&#x27;Ulisse in patria&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;incoronazione di Poppea&quot;.

While he worked extensively in the tradition of earlier Renaissance polyphony, as evidenced in his madrigals, he undertook great developments in form and melody, and began to employ the basso continuo technique, distinctive of the Baroque. No stranger to controversy, he defended his sometimes novel techniques as elements of a &quot;seconda pratica&quot;, contrasting with the more orthodox earlier style which he termed the &quot;prima pratica&quot;. Largely forgotten during the eighteenth and much of the nineteenth centuries, his works enjoyed a rediscovery around the beginning of the twentieth century. He is now established both as a significant influence in European musical history and as a composer whose works are regularly performed and recorded.

== Life ==
===Cremona: 1567–1591===
Monteverdi was baptised in the church of SS Nazaro e Celso, Cremona, on 15 May 1567. The register records his name as &quot;Claudio Zuan Antonio&quot; the son of &quot;Messer Baldasar Mondeverdo&quot;. He was the first child of the apothecary Baldassare Monteverdi and his first wife Maddalena (née Zignani); they had married early the previous year. Claudio&#x27;s brother Giulio Cesare Monteverdi (b. 1573) was also to become a musician; there were two other brothers and two sisters from Baldassare&#x27;s marriage to Maddalena and his subsequent marriage in 1576 or 1577. Cremona was close to the border of the Republic of Venice, and not far from the lands controlled by the Duchy of Mantua, in both of which states Monteverdi was later to establish his career.

There is no clear record of Monteverdi&#x27;s early musical training, or evidence that (as is sometimes claimed) he was a member of the Cathedral choir or studied at Cremona University. Monteverdi&#x27;s first published work, a set of motets, &quot; (Sacred Songs)&quot; for three voices, was issued in Venice in 1582, when he was only fifteen years old. In this, and his other initial publications, he describes himself as the pupil of Marc&#x27;Antonio Ingegneri, who was from 1581 (and possibly from 1576) to 1592 the &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; at Cremona Cathedral. The musicologist Tim Carter deduces that Ingegneri &quot;gave him a solid grounding in counterpoint and composition&quot;, and that Monteverdi would also have studied playing instruments of the viol family and singing.

Monteverdi&#x27;s first publications also give evidence of his connections beyond Cremona, even in his early years. His second published work, &quot;Madrigali spirituali&quot; (Spiritual Madrigals, 1583), was printed at Brescia. His next works (his first published secular compositions) were sets of five-part madrigals, according to his biographer Paolo Fabbri: &quot;the inevitable proving ground for any composer of the second half of the sixteenth century ... the secular genre &quot;par excellence&quot;&quot;. The first book of madrigals (Venice, 1587) was dedicated to Count Marco Verità of Verona; the second book of madrigals (Venice, 1590) was dedicated to the President of the Senate of Milan, Giacomo Ricardi, for whom he had played the viola da braccio in 1587.

===Mantua: 1591–1613===
====Court musician====
In the dedication of his second book of madrigals, Monteverdi had described himself as a player of the &quot;vivuola&quot; (which could mean either viola da gamba or viola da braccio). In 1590 or 1591 he entered the service of Duke Vincenzo I Gonzaga of Mantua; he recalled in his dedication to the Duke of his third book of madrigals (Venice, 1592) that &quot;the most noble exercise of the &quot;vivuola&quot; opened to me the fortunate way into your service.&quot; In the same dedication he compares his instrumental playing to &quot;flowers&quot; and his compositions as &quot;fruit&quot; which as it matures &quot;can more worthily and more perfectly serve you&quot;, indicating his intentions to establish himself as a composer.

Duke Vincenzo was keen to establish his court as a musical centre, and sought to recruit leading musicians. When Monteverdi arrived in Mantua, the &quot;maestro di capella&quot; at the court was the Flemish musician Giaches de Wert. Other notable musicians at the court during this period included the composer and violinist Salomone Rossi, Rossi&#x27;s sister, the singer Madama Europa, and Francesco Rasi. Monteverdi married the court singer Claudia de Cattaneis in 1599; they were to have three children, two sons (Francesco, b. 1601 and Massimiliano, b. 1604), and a daughter who died soon after birth in 1603. Monteverdi&#x27;s brother Giulio Cesare joined the court musicians in 1602.

When Wert died in 1596, his post was given to Benedetto Pallavicino, but Monteverdi was clearly highly regarded by Vincenzo and accompanied him on his military campaigns in Hungary (1595) and also on a visit to Flanders in 1599. Here at the town of Spa he is reported by his brother Giulio Cesare as encountering, and bringing back to Italy, the &quot;canto alla francese&quot;. (The meaning of this, literally &quot;song in the French style&quot;, is debatable, but may refer to the French-influenced poetry of Gabriello Chiabrera, some of which was set by Monteverdi in his &quot;Scherzi musicali&quot;, and which departs from the traditional Italian style of lines of 9 or 11 syllables). Monteverdi may possibly have been a member of Vincenzo&#x27;s entourage at Florence in 1600 for the marriage of Maria de&#x27; Medici and Henry IV of France, at which celebrations Jacopo Peri&#x27;s opera &quot;Euridice&quot; (the earliest surviving opera) was premiered. On the death of Pallavicino in 1601, Monteverdi was confirmed as the new &quot;maestro di capella&quot;.

====Artusi controversy and &quot;seconda pratica&quot;====
At the turn of the 17th century, Monteverdi found himself the target of musical controversy. The influential Bolognese theorist Giovanni Maria Artusi attacked Monteverdi&#x27;s music (without naming the composer) in his work &quot;L&#x27;Artusi, overo Delle imperfettioni della moderna musica (Artusi, or On the imperfections of modern music)&quot; of 1600, followed by a sequel in 1603. Artusi cited extracts from Monteverdi&#x27;s works not yet published (they later formed parts of his fourth and fifth books of madrigals of 1603 and 1605), condemning their use of harmony and their innovations in use of musical modes, compared to orthodox polyphonic practice of the sixteenth century. Artusi attempted to correspond with Monteverdi on these issues; the composer refused to respond, but found a champion in a pseudonymous supporter, &quot;L&#x27;Ottuso Academico&quot; (&quot;The Obtuse Academic&quot;). Eventually Monteverdi replied in the preface to the fifth book of madrigals that his duties at court prevented him from a detailed reply; but in a note to &quot;the studious reader&quot;, he claimed that he would shortly publish a response, &quot;Seconda Pratica, overo Perfettione della Moderna Musica (The Second Style, or Perfection of Modern Music)&quot;. This work never appeared, but a later publication by Claudio&#x27;s brother Giulio Cesare made it clear that the &quot;seconda pratica&quot; which Monteverdi defended was not seen by him as a radical change or his own invention, but was an evolution from previous styles (&quot;prima pratica&quot;) which was complementary to them.

This debate seems in any case to have raised the composer&#x27;s profile, leading to reprints of his earlier books of madrigals. Some of his madrigals were published in Copenhagen in 1605 and 1606, and the poet Tommaso Stigliani (1573–1651) published a eulogy of him in his 1605 poem &quot;O sirene de&#x27; fiumi&quot;. The composer of madrigal comedies and theorist Adriano Banchieri wrote in 1609: &quot;I must not neglect to mention the most noble of composers, Monteverdi ... his expressive qualities are truly deserving of the highest commendation, and we find in them countless examples of matchless declamation ... enhanced by comparable harmonies.&quot; The modern music historian Massimo Ossi has placed the Artusi issue in the context of Monteverdi&#x27;s artistic development: &quot;If the controversy seems to define Monteverdi&#x27;s historical position, it also seems to have been about stylistic developments that by 1600 Monteverdi had already outgrown&quot;.

The non-appearance of Monteverdi&#x27;s promised explanatory treatise may have been a deliberate ploy, since by 1608, by Monteverdi&#x27;s reckoning, Artusi had become fully reconciled to modern trends in music, and the &quot;seconda pratica&quot; was by then well established; Monteverdi had no need to revisit the issue. On the other hand, letters to Giovanni Battista Doni of 1632 show that Monteverdi was still preparing a defence of the &quot;seconda pratica&quot;, in a treatise entitled &quot;Melodia&quot;; he may still have been working on this at the time of his death ten years later.

====Opera, conflict and departure====

In 1606 Vincenzo&#x27;s heir Francesco commissioned from Monteverdi the opera &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot;, to a libretto by Alessandro Striggio, for the Carnival season of 1607. It was given two performances in February and March 1607; the singers included, in the title role, Rasi, who had sung in the first performance of &quot;Euridice&quot; witnessed by Vincenzo in 1600. This was followed in 1608 by the opera &quot;L&#x27;Arianna&quot; (libretto by Ottavio Rinuccini), intended for the celebration of the marriage of Francesco to Margherita of Savoy. All the music for this opera is lost apart from &quot;Ariadne&#x27;s Lament&quot;, which became extremely popular. To this period also belongs the ballet entertainment &quot;Il ballo delle ingrate&quot;.

The strain of the hard work Monteverdi had been putting into these and other compositions was exacerbated by personal tragedies. His wife died in September 1607 and the young singer Caterina Martinelli, intended for the title role of &quot;Arianna&quot;, died of smallpox in March 1608. Monteverdi also resented his increasingly poor financial treatment by the Gonzagas. He retired to Cremona in 1608 to convalesce, and wrote a bitter letter to Vincenzo&#x27;s minister Annibale Chieppio in November of that year seeking (unsuccessfully) &quot;an honourable dismissal&quot;. Although the Duke increased Monteverdi&#x27;s salary and pension, and Monteverdi returned to continue his work at the court, he began to seek patronage elsewhere. After publishing his Vespers in 1610, which were dedicated to Pope Paul V, he visited Rome, ostensibly hoping to place his son Francesco at a seminary, but apparently also seeking alternative employment. In the same year he may also have visited Venice, where a large collection of his church music was being printed, with a similar intention.

Duke Vincenzo died on 18 February 1612. When Francesco succeeded him, court intrigues and cost-cutting led to the dismissal of Monteverdi and his brother Giulio Cesare, who both returned, almost penniless, to Cremona. Despite Francesco&#x27;s own death from smallpox in December 1612, Monteverdi was unable to return to favour with his successor, his brother Cardinal Ferdinando Gonzaga. In 1613, following the death of Giulio Cesare Martinengo, Monteverdi auditioned for his post as &quot;maestro&quot; at the basilica of San Marco in Venice, for which he submitted music for a Mass. He was appointed in August 1613, and given 50 ducats for his expenses (of which he was robbed, together with his other belongings, by highwaymen at Sanguinetto on his return to Cremona).

===Venice: 1613–1643===
====Maturity: 1613–1630====
Martinengo had been ill for some time before his death and had left the music of San Marco in a fragile state. The choir had been neglected and the administration overlooked. When Monteverdi arrived to take up his post, his principal responsibility was to recruit, train, discipline and manage the musicians of San Marco (the &quot;capella&quot;), who amounted to about 30 singers and six instrumentalists; the numbers could be increased for major events. Among the recruits to the choir was Francesco Cavalli, who joined in 1616 at the age of 14; he remained connected with San Marco throughout his life, and developed a close association with Monteverdi. Monteverdi also sought to expand the repertory, including not only the traditional &quot;a cappella&quot; repertoire of Roman and Flemish composers, but also examples of the modern style which he favoured, including the use of continuo and other instruments. Apart from this he was of course expected to compose music for all the major feasts of the church. This included a new mass each year for Holy Cross Day and Christmas Eve, cantatas in honour of the Venetian Doge, and numerous other works (many of which are lost). Monteverdi was also free to obtain income by providing music for other Venetian churches and for other patrons, and was frequently commissioned to provide music for state banquets. The Procurators of San Marco, to whom Monteverdi was directly responsible, showed their satisfaction with his work in 1616 by raising his annual salary from 300 ducats to 400.

The relative freedom which the Republic of Venice afforded him, compared to the problems of court politics in Mantua, are reflected in Monteverdi&#x27;s letters to Striggio, particularly his letter of 13 March 1620, when he rejects an invitation to return to Mantua, extolling his present position and finances in Venice, and referring to the pension which Mantua still owes him. Nonetheless, remaining a Mantuan citizen, he accepted commissions from the new Duke Ferdinando, who had formally renounced his position as Cardinal in 1616 to take on the duties of state. These included the &quot;balli&quot; &quot;Tirsi e Clori&quot; (1616) and &quot;Apollo&quot; (1620), an opera &quot;Andromeda&quot; (1620) and an &quot;intermedio&quot;, &quot;Le nozze di Tetide&quot;, for the marriage of Ferdinando with Caterina de&#x27; Medici (1617). Most of these compositions were extensively delayed in creation – partly, as shown by surviving correspondence, through the composer&#x27;s unwillingness to prioritise them, and partly because of constant changes in the court&#x27;s requirements. They are now lost, apart from &quot;Tirsi e Clori&quot;, which was included in the seventh book of madrigals (published 1619) and dedicated to the Duchess Caterina, for which the composer received a pearl necklace from the Duchess. A subsequent major commission, the opera &quot;La finta pazza Licori&quot;, to a libretto by Giulio Strozzi, was completed for Fernando&#x27;s successor Vincenzo II, who succeeded to the dukedom in 1626. Because of the latter&#x27;s illness (he died in 1627), it was never performed, and it is now also lost.

Monteverdi also received commissions from other Italian states and from their communities in Venice. These included, for the Milanese community in 1620, music for the Feast of St. Charles Borromeo, and for the Florentine community a Requiem Mass for Cosimo II de&#x27; Medici (1621). Monteverdi acted on behalf of Paolo Giordano II, Duke of Bracciano, to arrange publication of works by the Cremona musician Francesco Petratti. Among Monteverdi&#x27;s private Venetian patrons was the nobleman Girolamo Mocenigo, at whose home was premiered in 1624 the dramatic entertainment &quot;Il combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda&quot; based on an episode from Torquato Tasso&#x27;s &quot;La Gerusalemme liberata&quot;. In 1627 Monteverdi received a major commission from Odoardo Farnese, Duke of Parma, for a series of works, and gained leave from the Procurators to spend time there during 1627 and 1628.

Monteverdi&#x27;s musical direction received the attention of foreign visitors. The Dutch diplomat and musician Constantijn Huygens, attending a Vespers service at the church of SS. Giovanni e Lucia, wrote that he &quot;heard the most perfect music I had ever heard in my life. It was directed by the most famous Claudio Monteverdi ... who was also the composer and was accompanied by four theorbos, two cornettos, two bassoons, one &quot;basso de viola&quot; of huge size, organs and other instruments ...&quot;. Monteverdi wrote a mass, and provided other musical entertainment, for the visit to Venice in 1625 of the Crown Prince Władysław of Poland, who may have sought to revive attempts made a few years previously to lure Monteverdi to Warsaw. He also provided chamber music for Wolfgang Wilhelm, Count Palatine of Neuburg, when the latter was paying an incognito visit to Venice in July 1625.

Correspondence of Monteverdi in 1625 and 1626 with the Mantuan courtier Ercole Marigliani reveals an interest in alchemy, which apparently Monteverdi had taken up as a hobby. He discusses experiments to transform lead into gold, the problems of obtaining mercury, and mentions commissioning special vessels for his experiments from the glassworks at Murano.

Despite his generally satisfactory situation in Venice, Monteverdi experienced personal problems from time to time. He was on one occasion – probably because of his wide network of contacts – the subject of an anonymous denunciation to the Venetian authorities alleging that he supported the Habsburgs. He was also subject to anxieties about his children. His son Francesco, while a student of law at Padua in 1619, was spending in Monteverdi&#x27;s opinion too much time with music, and he, therefore, moved him to the University of Bologna. This change did not have the desired result, and it seems that Monteverdi resigned himself to Francesco having a musical career – he joined the choir of San Marco in 1623. His other son Massimiliano, who graduated in medicine, was arrested by the Inquisition in Mantua in 1627 for reading forbidden literature. Monteverdi was obliged to sell the necklace he had received from Duchess Caterina to pay for his son&#x27;s (eventually successful) defence. Monteverdi wrote at the time to Striggio seeking his help, and fearing that Massimiliano might be subject to torture; it seems that Striggio&#x27;s intervention was helpful. Money worries at this time also led Monteverdi to visit Cremona to secure for himself a church canonry.

====Pause and priesthood: 1630–1637====
A series of disturbing events troubled Monteverdi&#x27;s world in the period around 1630. Mantua was invaded by Habsburg armies in 1630, who besieged the plague-stricken town, and after its fall in July looted its treasures, and dispersed the artistic community. The plague was carried to Mantua&#x27;s ally Venice by an embassy led by Monteverdi&#x27;s confidante Striggio, and over a period of 16 months led to over 45,000 deaths, leaving Venice&#x27;s population in 1633 at just above 100,000, the lowest level for about 150 years. Among the plague victims was Monteverdi&#x27;s assistant at San Marco, and a notable composer in his own right, Alessandro Grandi. The plague and the after-effects of war had an inevitable deleterious effect on the economy and artistic life of Venice. Monteverdi&#x27;s younger brother Giulio Cesare also died at this time, probably from the plague.

By this time Monteverdi was in his sixties, and his rate of composition seems to have slowed down. He had written a setting of Strozzi&#x27;s &quot;Proserpina rapita (The Abduction of Proserpina)&quot;, now lost except for one vocal trio, for a Mocenigo wedding in 1630, and produced a Mass for deliverance from the plague for San Marco which was performed in November 1631. His set of &quot;Scherzi musicali&quot; was published in Venice in 1632. In 1631, Monteverdi was admitted to the tonsure, and was ordained deacon, and later priest, in 1632. Although these ceremonies took place in Venice, he was nominated as a member of Diocese of Cremona; this may imply that he intended to retire there.

====Late flowering: 1637–1643====
The opening of the opera house of San Cassiano in 1637, the first public opera house in Europe, stimulated the city&#x27;s musical life and coincided with a new burst of the composer&#x27;s activity. The year 1638 saw the publication of Monteverdi&#x27;s eighth book of madrigals and a revision of the &quot;Ballo delle ingrate&quot;. The eighth book contains a &quot;ballo&quot;, &quot;Volgendi il ciel&quot;, which may have been composed for the Holy Roman Emperor, Ferdinand III, to whom the book is dedicated. The years 1640–1641 saw the publication of the extensive collection of church music, &quot;Selva morale e spirituale&quot;. Among other commissions, Monteverdi wrote music in 1637 and 1638 for Strozzi&#x27;s &quot;Accademia degli Unisoni&quot; in Venice, and in 1641 a ballet, &quot;La vittoria d&#x27;Amore&quot;, for the court of Piacenza.

Monteverdi was still not entirely free from his responsibilities for the musicians at San Marco. He wrote to complain about one of his singers to the Procurators, on 9 June 1637: &quot;I, Claudio Monteverdi ... come humbly ... to set forth to you how Domenicato Aldegati ... a bass, yesterday morning ... at the time of the greatest concourse of people ... spoke these exact words ...&#x27;The Director of Music comes from a brood of cut-throat bastards, a thieving, fucking, he-goat ... and I shit on him and whoever protects him ...

Monteverdi&#x27;s contribution to opera at this period is notable. He revised his earlier opera &quot;L&#x27;Arianna&quot; in 1640 and wrote three new works for the commercial stage, &quot;Il ritorno d&#x27;Ulisse in patria&quot; (&quot;The Return of Ulysses to his Homeland&quot;, 1640, first performed in Bologna with Venetian singers), &quot;Le nozze d&#x27;Enea e Lavinia&quot; (&quot;The Marriage of Aeneas and Lavinia&quot;, 1641, music now lost), and &quot;L&#x27;incoronazione di Poppea&quot; (&quot;The Coronation of Poppea&quot;, 1643). The introduction to the printed scenario of &quot;Le nozze d&#x27;Enea&quot;, by an unknown author, acknowledges that Monteverdi is to be credited for the rebirth of theatrical music and that &quot;he will be sighed for in later ages, for his compositions will surely outlive the ravages of time.&quot;

In his last surviving letter (20 August 1643), Monteverdi, already ill, was still hoping for the settlement of the long-disputed pension from Mantua, and asked the Doge of Venice to intervene on his behalf. He died in Venice on 29 November 1643, after paying a brief visit to Cremona, and is buried in the Church of the Frari. He was survived by his sons; Masimilliano died in 1661, Francesco after 1677.

==Music==

===Background: Renaissance to Baroque===

There is a consensus among music historians that a period extending from the mid-15th century to around 1625, characterised in Lewis Lockwood&#x27;s phrase by &quot;substantial unity of outlook and language&quot;, should be identified as the period of &quot;Renaissance music&quot;. Musical literature has also defined the succeeding period (covering music from approximately 1580 to 1750) as the era of &quot;Baroque music&quot;. It is in the late-16th to early-17th-century overlap of these periods that much of Monteverdi&#x27;s creativity flourished; he stands as a transitional figure between the Renaissance and the Baroque.

In the Renaissance era, music had developed as a formal discipline, a &quot;pure science of relationships&quot; in the words of Lockwood. In the Baroque era it became a form of aesthetic expression, increasingly used to adorn religious, social and festive celebrations in which, in accordance with Plato&#x27;s ideal, the music was subordinated to the text. Solo singing with instrumental accompaniment, or monody, acquired greater significance towards the end of the 16th century, replacing polyphony as the principal means of dramatic music expression. This was the changing world in which Monteverdi was active. Percy Scholes in his &quot;Oxford Companion to Music&quot; describes the &quot;new music&quot; thus: &quot;[Composers] discarded the choral polyphony of the madrigal style as barbaric, and set dialogue or soliloquy for single voices, imitating more or less the inflexions of speech and accompanying the voice by playing mere supporting chords. Short choruses were interspersed, but they too were homophonic rather than polyphonic.&quot;

===Novice years: Madrigal books 1 and 2===
Marc&#x27;Antonio Ingegneri, Monteverdi&#x27;s first tutor, was a master of the &quot;musica reservata&quot; vocal style, which involved the use of chromatic progressions and word-painting; Monteverdi&#x27;s early compositions were grounded in this style. Ingegneri was a traditional Renaissance composer, &quot;something of an anachronism&quot;, according to Arnold, but Monteverdi also studied the work of more &quot;modern&quot; composers such as Luca Marenzio, Luzzasco Luzzaschi, and a little later, Giaches de Wert, from whom he would learn the art of expressing passion. He was a precocious and productive student, as indicated by his youthful publications of 1582–83. Mark Ringer writes that &quot;these teenaged efforts reveal palpable ambition matched with a convincing mastery of contemporary style&quot;, but at this stage they display their creator&#x27;s competence rather than any striking originality. Geoffrey Chew classifies them as &quot;not in the most modern vein for the period&quot;, acceptable but out-of-date. Chew rates the &quot;Canzonette&quot; collection of 1584 much more highly than the earlier juvenilia: &quot;These brief three-voice pieces draw on the airy, modern style of the villanellas of Marenzio, [drawing on] a substantial vocabulary of text-related madrigalisms&quot;.

The canzonetta form was much used by composers of the day as a technical exercise, and is a prominent element in Monteverdi&#x27;s first book of madrigals published in 1587. In this book, the playful, pastoral settings again reflect the style of Marenzio, while Luzzaschi&#x27;s influence is evident in Monteverdi&#x27;s use of dissonance. The second book (1590) begins with a setting modelled on Marenzio of a modern verse, Torquato Tasso&#x27;s &quot;Non si levav&#x27; ancor&quot;, and concludes with a text from 50 years earlier: Pietro Bembo&#x27;s &quot;Cantai un tempo&quot;. Monteverdi set the latter to music in an archaic style reminiscent of the long-dead Cipriano de Rore. Between them is &quot;Ecco mormorar l&#x27;onde&quot;, strongly influenced by de Wert and hailed by Chew as the great masterpiece of the second book.

A thread common throughout these early works is Monteverdi&#x27;s use of the technique of &quot;imitatio&quot;, a general practice among composers of the period whereby material from earlier or contemporary composers was used as models for their own work. Monteverdi continued to use this procedure well beyond his apprentice years, a factor that in some critics&#x27; eyes has compromised his reputation for originality.

===Madrigals 1590–1605: books 3, 4, 5===
Monteverdi&#x27;s first fifteen years of service in Mantua are bracketed by his publications of the third book of madrigals in 1592 and the fourth and fifth books in 1603 and 1605. Between 1592 and 1603 he made minor contributions to other anthologies. How much he composed in this period is a matter of conjecture; his many duties in the Mantuan court may have limited his opportunities, but several of the madrigals that he published in the fourth and fifth books were written and performed during the 1590s, some figuring prominently in the Artusi controversy.

The third book shows strongly the increased influence of Wert, by that time Monteverdi&#x27;s direct superior as &quot;maestro de capella&quot; at Mantua. Two poets dominate the collection: Tasso, whose lyrical poetry had figured prominently in the second book but is here represented through the more epic, heroic verses from &quot;Gerusalemme liberata&quot;, and Giovanni Battista Guarini, whose verses had appeared sporadically in Monteverdi&#x27;s earlier publications, but form around half of the contents of the third book. Wert&#x27;s influence is reflected in Monteverdi&#x27;s forthrightly modern approach, and his expressive and chromatic settings of Tasso&#x27;s verses. Of the Guarini settings, Chew writes: &quot;The epigrammatic style ... closely matches a poetic and musical ideal of the period ... [and] often depends on strong, final cadential progressions, with or without the intensification provided by chains of suspended dissonances&quot;. Chew cites the setting of &quot;Stracciami pur il core&quot; as &quot;a prime example of Monteverdi&#x27;s irregular dissonance practice&quot;. Tasso and Guarini were both regular visitors to the Mantuan court; Monteverdi&#x27;s association with them and his absorption of their ideas may have helped lay the foundations of his own approach to the musical dramas that he would create a decade later.

As the 1590s progressed, Monteverdi moved closer towards the form that he would identify in due course as the &quot;seconda pratica&quot;. Claude V. Palisca quotes the madrigal &quot;Ohimè, se tanto amate&quot;, published in the fourth book but written before 1600 – it is among the works attacked by Artusi – as a typical example of the composer&#x27;s developing powers of invention. In this madrigal Monteverdi again departs from the established practice in the use of dissonance, by means of a vocal ornament Palisca describes as &quot;échappé&quot;. Monteverdi&#x27;s daring use of this device is, says Palisca, &quot;like a forbidden pleasure&quot;. In this and in other settings the poet&#x27;s images were supreme, even at the expense of musical consistency.

The fourth book includes madrigals to which Artusi objected on the grounds of their &quot;modernism&quot;. However, Ossi describes it as &quot;an anthology of disparate works firmly rooted in the 16th century&quot;, closer in nature to the third book than to the fifth. Besides Tasso and Guarini, Monteverdi set to music verses by Rinuccini, Maurizio Moro (&quot;Sì ch&#x27;io vorrei morire&quot;) and Ridolfo Arlotti (&quot;Luci serene e chiare&quot;). There is evidence of the composer&#x27;s familiarity with the works of Carlo Gesualdo, and with composers of the school of Ferrara such as Luzzaschi; the book was dedicated to a Ferrarese musical society, the &quot;Accademici Intrepidi&quot;.

The fifth book looks more to the future; for example, Monteverdi employs the &quot;concertato&quot; style with basso continuo (a device that was to become a typical feature in the emergent Baroque era), and includes a &quot;sinfonia&quot; (instrumental interlude) in the final piece. He presents his music through complex counterpoint and daring harmonies, although at times combining the expressive possibilities of the new music with traditional polyphony.

Aquilino Coppini drew much of the music for his sacred contrafacta of 1608 from Monteverdi&#x27;s 3rd, 4th and 5th books of madrigals. In writing to a friend in 1609 Coppini commented that Monteverdi&#x27;s pieces &quot;require, during their performance, more flexible rests and bars that are not strictly regular, now pressing forward or abandoning themselves to slowing down [...] In them there is a truly wondrous capacity for moving the affections&quot;.

===Opera and sacred music: 1607–1612===

In Monteverdi&#x27;s final five years&#x27; service in Mantua he completed the operas &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot; (1607) and &quot;L&#x27;Arianna&quot; (1608), and wrote quantities of sacred music, including the &quot;Messa in illo tempore&quot; (1610) and also the collection known as &quot;Vespro della Beata Vergine&quot; which is often referred to as &quot;Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;Vespers&quot;&quot; (1610). He also published &quot;Scherzi musicale a tre voci&quot; (1607), settings of verses composed since 1599 and dedicated to the Gonzaga heir, Francesco. The vocal trio in the &quot;Scherzi&quot; comprises two sopranos and a bass, accompanied by simple instrumental ritornellos. According to Bowers the music &quot;reflected the modesty of the prince&#x27;s resources; it was, nevertheless, the earliest publication to associate voices and instruments in this particular way&quot;.

====&quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot;====

The opera opens with a brief trumpet toccata. The prologue of La musica (a figure representing music) is introduced with a ritornello by the strings, repeated often to represent the &quot;power of music&quot; – one of the earliest examples of an operatic leitmotif. Act 1 presents a pastoral idyll, the buoyant mood of which continues into Act 2. The confusion and grief which follow the news of Euridice&#x27;s death are musically reflected by harsh dissonances and the juxtaposition of keys. The music remains in this vein until the act ends with the consoling sounds of the ritornello.

Act 3 is dominated by Orfeo&#x27;s aria &quot;Possente spirto e formidabil nume&quot; by which he attempts to persuade Caronte to allow him to enter Hades. Monteverdi&#x27;s vocal embellishments and virtuoso accompaniment provide what Tim Carter has described as &quot;one of the most compelling visual and aural representations&quot; in early opera. In Act 4 the warmth of Proserpina&#x27;s singing on behalf of Orfeo is retained until Orfeo fatally &quot;looks back&quot;. The brief final act, which sees Orfeo&#x27;s rescue and metamorphosis, is framed by the final appearance of the ritornello and by a lively moresca that brings the audience back to their everyday world.

Throughout the opera Monteverdi makes innovative use of polyphony, extending the rules beyond the conventions which composers normally observed in fidelity to Palestrina. He combines elements of the traditional 16th-century madrigal with the new monodic style where the text dominates the music and sinfonias and instrumental ritornellos illustrate the action.

====&quot;L&#x27;Arianna&quot;====

The music for this opera is lost except for the &quot;Lamento d&#x27;Arianna&quot;, which was published in the sixth book in 1614 as a five-voice madrigal; a separate monodic version was published in 1623. In its operatic context the lament depicts Arianna&#x27;s various emotional reactions to her abandonment: sorrow, anger, fear, self-pity, desolation and a sense of futility. Throughout, indignation and anger are punctuated by tenderness, until a descending line brings the piece to a quiet conclusion.

The musicologist Suzanne Cusick writes that Monteverdi &quot;creat[ed] the lament as a recognizable genre of vocal chamber music and as a standard scene in opera ... that would become crucial, almost genre-defining, to the full-scale public operas of 17th-century Venice&quot;. Cusick observes how Monteverdi is able to match in music the &quot;rhetorical and syntactical gestures&quot; in the text of Ottavio Rinuccini. The opening repeated words &quot;Lasciatemi morire&quot; (Let me die) are accompanied by a dominant seventh chord which Ringer describes as &quot;an unforgettable chromatic stab of pain&quot;. Ringer suggests that the lament defines Monteverdi&#x27;s innovative creativity in a manner similar to that in which the Prelude and the Liebestod in &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; announced Wagner&#x27;s discovery of new expressive frontiers.

Rinuccini&#x27;s full libretto, which has survived, was set in modern times by Alexander Goehr (&quot;Arianna&quot;, 1995), including a version of Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;Lament&quot;.

====Vespers====

The &quot;Vespro della Beata Vergine&quot;, Monteverdi&#x27;s first published sacred music since the &quot;Madrigali spirituali&quot; of 1583, consists of 14 components: an introductory versicle and response, five psalms interspersed with five &quot;sacred concertos&quot; (Monteverdi&#x27;s term), a hymn, and two Magnificat settings. Collectively these pieces fulfil the requirements for a Vespers service on any feast day of the Virgin. Monteverdi employs many musical styles; the more traditional features, such as cantus firmus, falsobordone and Venetian canzone, are mixed with the latest madrigal style, including echo effects and chains of dissonances. Some of the musical features used are reminiscent of &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot;, written slightly earlier for similar instrumental and vocal forces.

In this work the &quot;sacred concertos&quot; fulfil the role of the antiphons which divide the psalms in regular Vespers services. Their non-liturgical character has led writers to question whether they should be within the service, or indeed whether this was Monteverdi&#x27;s intention. In some versions of Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;Vespers&quot; (for example, those of Denis Stevens) the concertos are replaced with antiphons associated with the Virgin, although John Whenham in his analysis of the work argues that the collection as a whole should be regarded as a single liturgical and artistic entity.

All the psalms, and the Magnificat, are based on melodically limited and repetitious Gregorian chant psalm tones, around which Monteverdi builds a range of innovative textures. This concertato style challenges the traditional cantus firmus, and is most evident in the &quot;Sonata sopra Sancta Maria&quot;, written for eight string and wind instruments plus basso continuo, and a single soprano voice. Monteverdi uses modern rhythms, frequent metre changes and constantly varying textures; yet, according to John Eliot Gardiner, &quot;for all the virtuosity of its instrumental writing and the evident care which has gone into the combinations of timbre&quot;, Monteverdi&#x27;s chief concern was resolving the proper combination of words and music.

The actual musical ingredients of the Vespers were not novel to Mantua – concertato had been used by Lodovico Grossi da Viadana, a former choirmaster at the cathedral of Mantua, while the &quot;Sonata sopra&quot; had been anticipated by Archangelo Crotti in his &quot;Sancta Maria&quot; published in 1608. It is, writes Denis Arnold, Monteverdi&#x27;s mixture of the various elements that makes the music unique. Arnold adds that the Vespers achieved fame and popularity only after their 20th-century rediscovery; they were not particularly regarded in Monteverdi&#x27;s time.

===Madrigals 1614–1638: books 6, 7 and 8===
====Sixth book====
During his years in Venice Monteverdi published his sixth (1614), seventh (1619) and eighth (1638) books of madrigals. The sixth book consists of works written before the composer&#x27;s departure from Mantua. Hans Redlich sees it as a transitional work, containing Monteverdi&#x27;s last madrigal compositions in the manner of the &quot;prima pratica&quot;, together with music which is typical of the new style of expression which Monteverdi had displayed in the dramatic works of 1607–08. The central theme of the collection is loss; the best-known work is the five-voice version of the &quot;Lamento d&#x27;Arianna&quot;, which, says Massimo Ossi, gives &quot;an object lesson in the close relationship between monodic recitative and counterpoint&quot;. The book contains Monteverdi&#x27;s first settings of verses by Giambattista Marino, and two settings of Petrarch which Ossi considers the most extraordinary pieces in the volume, providing some &quot;stunning musical moments&quot;.

====Seventh book====
While Monteverdi had looked backwards in the sixth book, he moved forward in the seventh book from the traditional concept of the madrigal, and from monody, in favour of chamber duets. There are exceptions, such the two solo &quot;lettere amorose&quot; (love letters) &quot;Se i languidi miei sguardi&quot; and &quot;Se pur destina e vole&quot;, written to be performed &quot;genere rapresentativo&quot; – acted as well as sung. Of the duets which are the main features of the volume, Chew highlights &quot;Ohimé, dov&#x27;è il mio ben, dov&#x27;è il mio core&quot;, a romanesca in which two high voices express dissonances above a repetitive bass pattern. The book also contains large-scale ensemble works, and the ballet &quot;Tirsi e Clori&quot;. This was the height of Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;Marino period&quot;; six of the pieces in the book are settings of the poet&#x27;s verses. As Carter puts it, Monteverdi &quot;embraced Marino&#x27;s madrigalian kisses and love-bites with ... the enthusiasm typical of the period&quot;. Some commentators have opined that the composer should have had better poetic taste.

====Eighth book====

The eighth book, subtitled &quot;Madrigali guerrieri, et amorosi ...&quot; (&quot;Madrigals of war and love&quot;) is structured in two symmetrical halves, one for &quot;war&quot; and one for &quot;love&quot;. Each half begins with a six-voice setting, followed by an equally large-scale Petrarch setting, then a series of duets mainly for tenor voices, and concludes with a theatrical number and a final ballet. The &quot;war&quot; half contains several items written as tributes to the emperor Ferdinand III, who had succeeded to the Habsburg throne in 1637. Many of Monteverdi&#x27;s familiar poets – Strozzi, Rinuccini, Tasso, Marino, Guarini – are represented in the settings.

It is difficult to gauge when many of the pieces were composed, although the ballet &quot;Mascherata dell&#x27; ingrate&quot; that ends the book dates back to 1608 and the celebration of the Gonzaga-Savoy marriage. The &quot;Combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda&quot;, centrepiece of the &quot;war&quot; settings, had been written and performed in Venice in 1624; on its publication in the eighth book, Monteverdi explicitly linked it to his concept of &quot;concitato genera&quot; (otherwise &quot;stile concitato&quot; – &quot;aroused style&quot;) that would &quot;fittingly imitate the utterance and the accents of a brave man who is engaged in warfare&quot;, and implied that since he had originated this style, others had begun to copy it. The work employed for the first time instructions for the use of pizzicato string chords, and also evocations of fanfares and other sounds of combat.

The critic Andrew Clements describes the eighth book as &quot;a statement of artistic principles and compositional authority&quot;, in which Monteverdi &quot;shaped and expanded the madrigal form to accommodate what he wanted to do ... the pieces collected in Book Eight make up a treasury of what music in the first half the 17th century could possibly express.&quot;

===Other Venetian music: 1614–1638===
During this period of his Venetian residency, Monteverdi composed quantities of sacred music. Numerous motets and other short works were included in anthologies by local publishers such as Giulio Cesare Bianchi (a former student of Monteverdi) and Lorenzo Calvi, and others were published elsewhere in Italy and Austria. The range of styles in the motets is broad, from simple strophic arias with string accompaniment to full-scale declamations with an alleluia finale.

Monteverdi retained emotional and political attachments to the Mantuan court and wrote for it, or undertook to write, large amounts of stage music including at least four operas. The ballet &quot;Tirsi e Clori&quot; survives through its inclusion in the seventh book, but the rest of the Mantuan dramatic music is lost. Many of the missing manuscripts may have disappeared in the wars that overcame Mantua in 1630. The most significant aspect of their loss, according to Carter, is the extent to which they might have provided musical links between Monteverdi&#x27;s early Mantuan operas and those he wrote in Venice after 1638: &quot;Without these links ... it is hard to a produce a coherent account of his development as a composer for the stage&quot;. Likewise, Janet Beat regrets that the 30-year gap hampers the study of how opera orchestration developed during those critical early years.

Apart from the madrigal books, Monteverdi&#x27;s only published collection during this period was the volume of &quot;Scherzi musicale&quot; in 1632. For unknown reasons, the composer&#x27;s name does not appear on the inscription, the dedication being signed by the Venetian printer Bartolomeo Magni; Carter surmises that the recently ordained Monteverdi may have wished to keep his distance from this secular collection. It mixes strophic continuo songs for solo voice with more complex works which employ continuous variation over repeated bass patterns. Chew selects the chaconne for two tenors, &quot;Zefiro torna e di soavi accenti&quot;, as the outstanding item in the collection: &quot;[T]he greater part of this piece consists of repetitions of a bass pattern which ensures tonal unity of a simple kind, owing to its being framed as a simple cadence in a G major tonal type: over these repetitions, inventive variations unfold in virtuoso passage-work&quot;.

=== Late operas and final works ===
&quot;Main articles&quot;: &quot;Il ritorno d&#x27;Ulisse in patria&quot;; &quot;L&#x27;incoronazione di Poppea&quot;; &quot;Selva morale e spirituale&quot;
The last years of Monteverdi&#x27;s life were much occupied with opera for the Venetian stage. Richard Taruskin, in his &quot;Oxford History of Western Music&quot;, gave his chapter on this topic the title &quot;Opera from Monteverdi to Monteverdi.&quot; This wording, originally proposed humorously by the Italian music historian Nino Pirrotta, is interpreted seriously by Taruskin as indicating that Monteverdi is significantly responsible for the transformation of the opera genre from a private entertainment of the nobility (as with &quot;Orfeo&quot; in 1607), to what became a major commercial genre, as exemplified by his opera &quot;L&#x27;incoronazione di Poppea&quot; (1643). His two surviving operatic works of this period, &quot;Il ritorno d&#x27;Ulisse in patria&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;incoronazione&quot; are held by Arnold to be the first &quot;modern&quot; operas; &quot;Il ritorno&quot; is the first Venetian opera to depart from what Ellen Rosand terms &quot;the mythological pastoral&quot;. However, David Johnson in the &quot;North American Review&quot; warns audiences not to expect immediate affinity with Mozart, Verdi or Puccini: &quot;You have to submit yourself to a much slower pace, to a much more chaste conception of melody, to a vocal style that is at first merely like dry declamation and only on repeated hearings begins to assume an extraordinary eloquence.&quot;

&quot;Il ritorno&quot;, says Carter, is clearly influenced by Monteverdi&#x27;s earlier works. Penelope&#x27;s lament in Act I is close in character to the lament from &quot;L&#x27;Arianna&quot;, while the martial episodes recall &quot;Il combattimento&quot;. &quot;Stile concitato&quot; is prominent in the fight scenes and in the slaying of Penelope&#x27;s suitors. In &quot;L&#x27;incoronazione&quot;, Monteverdi represents moods and situations by specific musical devices: triple metre stands for the language of love; arpeggios demonstrate conflict; &quot;stile concitato&quot; represents rage. There is continuing debate about how much of the extant &quot;L&#x27;incoronazione&quot; music is Monteverdi&#x27;s original, and how much is the work of others (there are, for instance, traces of music by Francesco Cavalli).

The &quot;Selva morale e spirituale&quot; of 1641, and the posthumous &quot;Messa et salmi&quot; published in 1650 (which was edited by Cavalli), are selections of the sacred music that Monteverdi wrote for San Marco during his 30-year tenure – much else was likely written but not published. The &quot;Selva morale&quot; volume opens with a series of madrigal settings on moral texts, dwelling on themes such as &quot;the transitory nature of love, earthly rank and achievement, even existence itself&quot;. They are followed by a Mass in conservative style (&quot;stile antico&quot;), the high point of which is an extended seven-voice &quot;Gloria&quot;. Scholars believe that this might have been written to celebrate the end of the 1631 plague. The rest of the volume is made up of numerous psalm settings, two Magnificats and three &quot;Salve Reginas&quot;. The &quot;Messa et salmi&quot; volume includes a &quot;stile antico&quot; Mass for four voices, a polyphonic setting of the psalm &quot;Laetatus Sum&quot;, and a version of the Litany of Lareto that Monteverdi had originally published in 1620.

The posthumous ninth book of madrigals was published in 1651, a miscellany dating back to the early 1630s, some items being repeats of previously published pieces, such as the popular duet &quot;O sia tranquillo il mare&quot; from 1638. The book includes a trio for three sopranos, &quot;Come dolce oggi l&#x27;auretta&quot;, which is the only surviving music from the 1630 lost opera &quot;Proserpina rapita&quot;.

==Historical perspective==
In his lifetime Monteverdi enjoyed considerable status among musicians and the public. This is evidenced by the scale of his funeral rites: &quot;[W]ith truly royal pomp a catafalque was erected in the Chiesa de Padrini Minori de Frari, decorated all in mourning, but surrounded with so many candles that the church resembled a night sky luminous with stars&quot;. This glorification was transitory; Carter writes that in Monteverdi&#x27;s day, music rarely survived beyond the circumstances of its initial performance and was quickly forgotten along with its creator. In this regard Monteverdi fared better than most. His operatic works were revived in several cities in the decade following his death; according to Severo Bonini, writing in 1651, every musical household in Italy possessed a copy of the &quot;Lamento d&#x27;Arianna&quot;.

The German composer Heinrich Schütz, who had studied in Venice under Giovanni Gabrieli shortly before Monteverdi&#x27;s arrival there, possessed a copy of &quot;Il combattimento&quot; and himself took up elements of the &quot;stile concitato&quot;. On his second visit to Venice in 1628–1629, Arnold believes, Schütz absorbed the concepts of &quot;basso continuo&quot; and expressiveness of word-setting, but he opines that Schütz was more directly influenced by the style of the younger generation of Venetian composers, including Grandi and Giovanni Rovetta (the eventual successor to Monteverdi at San Marco). Schütz published a first book of &quot;Symphoniae sacrae&quot;, settings of biblical texts in the style of &quot;seconda pratica&quot;, in Venice in 1629. &quot;Es steh Gott auf&quot;, from his &quot;Symphoniae sacrae II&quot;, published in Dresden in 1647, contains specific quotations from Monteverdi.

After the 1650s, Monteverdi&#x27;s name quickly disappears from contemporary accounts, his music generally forgotten except for the &quot;Lamento&quot;, the prototype of a genre that would endure well into the 18th century.

Interest in Monteverdi revived in the late 18th and early 19th centuries among music scholars in Germany and Italy, although he was still regarded as essentially a historical curiosity. Wider interest in the music itself began in 1881, when Robert Eitner published a shortened version of the &quot;Orfeo&quot; score. Around this time Kurt Vogel scored the madrigals from the original manuscripts, but more critical interest was shown in the operas, following the discovery of the &quot;L&#x27;incoronazione&quot; manuscript in 1888 and that of &quot;Il ritorno&quot; in 1904. Largely through the efforts of Vincent d&#x27;Indy, all three operas were staged in one form or another, during the first quarter of the 20th century: &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot; in May 1911, &quot;L&#x27;incoronazione&quot; in February 1913 and &quot;Il ritorno&quot; in May 1925.

The Italian nationalist poet Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio lauded Monteverdi and in his novel &quot;Il fuoco&quot; (1900) wrote of &quot;&quot;il divino Claudio&quot; ... what a heroic soul, purely Italian in its essence!&quot; His vision of Monteverdi as the true founder of Italian musical lyricism was adopted by musicians who worked with the regime of Benito Mussolini (1922–1945), including Gian Francesco Malipiero, Luigi Dallapiccola, and , who contrasted Monteverdi with the decadence of the music of Richard Strauss, Claude Debussy and Igor Stravinsky.

In the years after the Second World War the operas began to be performed in the major opera houses, and eventually were established in the general repertory. The resuscitation of Monteverdi&#x27;s sacred music took longer; he did not benefit from the Catholic Church&#x27;s 19th-century revival of Renaissance music in the way that Palestrina did, perhaps, as Carter suggests, because Monteverdi was viewed chiefly as a secular composer. It was not until 1932 that the 1610 &quot;Vespers&quot; were published in a modern edition, followed by Redlich&#x27;s revision two years later. Modern editions of the &quot;Selva morale&quot; and &quot;Missa e Salmi&quot; volumes were published respectively in 1940 and 1942.

The revival of public interest in Monteverdi&#x27;s music gathered pace in the second half of the 20th century, reaching full spate in the general early-music revival of the 1970s, during which time the emphasis turned increasingly towards &quot;authentic&quot; performance using historical instruments. The magazine &quot;Gramophone&quot; notes over 30 recordings of the &quot;Vespers&quot; between 1976 and 2011, and 27 of &quot;Il combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda&quot; between 1971 and 2013. Monteverdi&#x27;s surviving operas are today regularly performed; the website Operabase notes 555 performances of the operas in 149 productions worldwide in the seasons 2011–2016, ranking Monteverdi at 30th position for all composers, and at 8th ranking for Italian opera composers. In 1985, Manfred H. Stattkus published an index to Monteverdi&#x27;s works, the Stattkus-Verzeichnis, (revised in 2006) giving each composition an &quot;SV&quot; number, to be used for cataloguing and references.

Monteverdi is lauded by modern critics as &quot;the most significant composer in late Renaissance and early Baroque Italy&quot;; &quot;one of the principal composers in the history of Western music&quot;; and, routinely, as the first great opera composer. These assessments reflect a contemporary perspective, since his music was largely unknown to the composers who followed him during an extensive period, spanning more than two centuries after his death. It is, as Redlich and others have pointed out, the composers of the 20th and 21st century who have rediscovered Monteverdi and sought to make his music a basis for their own. Possibly, as Chew suggests, they are attracted by Monteverdi&#x27;s reputation as &quot;a Modern, a breaker of rules, against the Ancients, those who deferred to ancient authority&quot; – although the composer was, essentially, a pragmatist, &quot;showing what can only be described as an opportunistic and eclectic willingness to use whatever lay to hand for the purpose&quot;. In a letter dated 16 October 1633, Monteverdi appears to endorse the view of himself as a &quot;modern&quot;: &quot;I would rather be moderately praised for the new style than greatly praised for the ordinary&quot;. However, Chew, in his final summation, sees the composer historically as facing both ways, willing to use modern techniques but while at the same time protective of his status as a competent composer in the &quot;stile antico&quot;. Thus, says Chew, &quot;his achievement was both retrospective and progressive&quot;. Monteverdi represents the late Renaissance era while simultaneously summing up much of the early Baroque. &quot;And in one respect in particular, his achievement was enduring: the effective projection of human emotions in music, in a way adequate for theatre as well as for chamber music.&quot;

<text>Colossus was a set of computers developed by British codebreakers in the years 1943–1945 to help in the cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher. Colossus used thermionic valves (vacuum tubes) to perform Boolean and counting operations. Colossus is thus regarded as the world&#x27;s first programmable, electronic, digital computer, although it was programmed by switches and plugs and not by a stored program.

Colossus was designed by General Post Office (GPO) research telephone engineer Tommy Flowers based on plans developed by mathematician Max Newman at the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS) at Bletchley Park.

Alan Turing&#x27;s use of probability in cryptanalysis (see Banburismus) contributed to its design. It has sometimes been erroneously stated that Turing designed Colossus to aid the cryptanalysis of the Enigma. (Turing&#x27;s machine that helped decode Enigma was the electromechanical Bombe, not Colossus.)

The prototype, Colossus Mark 1, was shown to be working in December 1943 and was in use at Bletchley Park by early 1944. An improved Colossus Mark 2 that used shift registers to run five times faster first worked on 1 June 1944, just in time for the Normandy landings on D-Day. Ten Colossi were in use by the end of the war and an eleventh was being commissioned. Bletchley Park&#x27;s use of these machines allowed the Allies to obtain a vast amount of high-level military intelligence from intercepted radiotelegraphy messages between the German High Command (&quot;OKW&quot;) and their army commands throughout occupied Europe.

The existence of the Colossus machines was kept secret until the mid-1970s. All but two machines were dismantled into such small parts that their use could not be inferred. The two retained machines were eventually dismantled in the 1960s. In January 2024, new photos were released by GCHQ that showed re-engineered Colossus in a very different environment from the Bletchley Park buildings, presumably at GCHQ Cheltenham. A functioning reconstruction of a Mark 2 Colossus was completed in 2008 by Tony Sale and a team of volunteers; it is on display in The National Museum of Computing at Bletchley Park.

==Purpose and origins==


The Colossus computers were used to help decipher intercepted radio teleprinter messages that had been encrypted using an unknown device. Intelligence information revealed that the Germans called the wireless teleprinter transmission systems &quot;Sägefisch&quot; (sawfish). This led the British to call encrypted German teleprinter traffic &quot;Fish&quot;, and the unknown machine and its intercepted messages &quot;Tunny&quot; (tunafish).

Before the Germans increased the security of their operating procedures, British cryptanalysts diagnosed how the unseen machine functioned and built an imitation of it called &quot;British Tunny&quot;.

It was deduced that the machine had twelve wheels and used a Vernam ciphering technique on message characters in the standard 5-bit ITA2 telegraph code. It did this by combining the plaintext characters with a stream of key characters using the XOR Boolean function to produce the ciphertext.

In August 1941, a blunder by German operators led to the transmission of two versions of the same message with identical machine settings. These were intercepted and worked on at Bletchley Park. First, John Tiltman, a very talented GC&amp;CS cryptanalyst, derived a keystream of almost 4000 characters. Then Bill Tutte, a newly arrived member of the Research Section, used this keystream to work out the logical structure of the Lorenz machine. He deduced that the twelve wheels consisted of two groups of five, which he named the χ (&quot;chi&quot;) and ψ (&quot;psi&quot;) wheels, the remaining two he called μ (&quot;mu&quot;) or &quot;motor&quot; wheels. The &quot;chi&quot; wheels stepped regularly with each letter that was encrypted, while the &quot;psi&quot; wheels stepped irregularly, under the control of the motor wheels.
With a sufficiently random keystream, a Vernam cipher removes the natural language property of a plaintext message of having an uneven frequency distribution of the different characters, to produce a uniform distribution in the ciphertext. The Tunny machine did this well. However, the cryptanalysts worked out that by examining the frequency distribution of the character-to-character changes in the ciphertext, instead of the plain characters, there was a departure from uniformity which provided a way into the system. This was achieved by &quot;differencing&quot; in which each bit or character was XOR-ed with its successor. After Germany surrendered, allied forces captured a Tunny machine and discovered that it was the electromechanical Lorenz SZ (&quot;Schlüsselzusatzgerät&quot;, cipher attachment) in-line cipher machine.

In order to decrypt the transmitted messages, two tasks had to be performed. The first was &quot;wheel breaking&quot;, which was the discovery of the cam patterns for all the wheels. These patterns were set up on the Lorenz machine and then used for a fixed period of time for a succession of different messages. Each transmission, which often contained more than one message, was enciphered with a different start position of the wheels. Alan Turing invented a method of wheel-breaking that became known as Turingery. Turing&#x27;s technique was further developed into &quot;Rectangling&quot;, for which Colossus could produce tables for manual analysis. Colossi 2, 4, 6, 7 and 9 had a &quot;gadget&quot; to aid this process.

The second task was &quot;wheel setting&quot;, which worked out the start positions of the wheels for a particular message and could only be attempted once the cam patterns were known. It was this task for which Colossus was initially designed. To discover the start position of the &quot;chi&quot; wheels for a message, Colossus compared two character streams, counting statistics from the evaluation of programmable Boolean functions. The two streams were the ciphertext, which was read at high speed from a paper tape, and the keystream, which was generated internally, in a simulation of the unknown German machine. After a succession of different Colossus runs to discover the likely &quot;chi&quot;-wheel settings, they were checked by examining the frequency distribution of the characters in the processed ciphertext. Colossus produced these frequency counts.

==Decryption processes==

By using differencing and knowing that the &quot;psi&quot; wheels did not advance with each character, Tutte worked out that trying just two differenced bits (impulses) of the &quot;chi&quot;-stream against the differenced ciphertext would produce a statistic that was non-random. This became known as Tutte&#x27;s &quot;1+2 break in&quot;. It involved calculating the following Boolean function:
:::formula_1
and counting the number of times it yielded &quot;false&quot; (zero). If this number exceeded a pre-defined threshold value known as the &quot;set total&quot;, it was printed out. The cryptanalyst would examine the printout to determine which of the putative start positions was most likely to be the correct one for the &quot;chi&quot;-1 and &quot;chi&quot;-2 wheels.

This technique would then be applied to other pairs of, or single, impulses to determine the likely start position of all five &quot;chi&quot; wheels. From this, the de-&quot;chi&quot; (D) of a ciphertext could be obtained, from which the &quot;psi&quot; component could be removed by manual methods. If the frequency distribution of characters in the de-&quot;chi&quot; version of the ciphertext was within certain bounds, &quot;wheel setting&quot; of the &quot;chi&quot; wheels was considered to have been achieved, and the message settings and de-&quot;chi&quot; were passed to the &quot;Testery&quot;. This was the section at Bletchley Park led by Major Ralph Tester where the bulk of the decrypting work was done by manual and linguistic methods.

Colossus could also derive the start position of the &quot;psi&quot; and motor wheels. The feasibility of utilizing this additional capability regularly was made possible in the last few months of the war when there were plenty of Colossi available and the number of Tunny messages had declined.

==Design and construction==

Colossus was developed for the &quot;Newmanry&quot;, the section headed by the mathematician Max Newman that was responsible for machine methods against the twelve-rotor Lorenz SZ40/42 on-line teleprinter cipher machine (code-named Tunny, for tunafish). The Colossus design arose out of a parallel project that produced a less-ambitious counting machine dubbed &quot;Heath Robinson&quot;. Although the Heath Robinson machine proved the concept of machine analysis for this part of the process, it had serious limitations. The electro-mechanical parts were relatively slow and it was difficult to synchronise two looped paper tapes, one containing the enciphered message, and the other representing part of the keystream of the Lorenz machine. Also the tapes tended to stretch and break when being read at up to 2000 characters per second.
Tommy Flowers MBE was a senior electrical engineer and Head of the Switching Group at the Post Office Research Station at Dollis Hill. Prior to his work on Colossus, he had been involved with GC&amp;CS at Bletchley Park from February 1941 in an attempt to improve the Bombes that were used in the cryptanalysis of the German Enigma cipher machine. He was recommended to Max Newman by Alan Turing, who had been impressed by his work on the Bombes. The main components of the Heath Robinson machine were as follows.
* A tape transport and reading mechanism that ran the looped key and message tapes at between 1000 and 2000 characters per second.
* A combining unit that implemented the logic of Tutte&#x27;s method.
* A counting unit that had been designed by C. E. Wynn-Williams of the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) at Malvern, which counted the number of times the logical function returned a specified truth value.

Flowers had been brought in to design the Heath Robinson&#x27;s combining unit. He was not impressed by the system of a key tape that had to be kept synchronised with the message tape and, on his own initiative, he designed an electronic machine which eliminated the need for the key tape by having an electronic analogue of the Lorenz (Tunny) machine. He presented this design to Max Newman in February 1943, but the idea that the one to two thousand thermionic valves (vacuum tubes and thyratrons) proposed, could work together reliably, was greeted with great scepticism, so more Robinsons were ordered from Dollis Hill. Flowers, however, knew from his pre-war work that most thermionic valve failures occurred as a result of the thermal stresses at power-up, so not powering a machine down reduced failure rates to very low levels. Additionally, if the heaters were started at a low voltage then slowly brought up to full voltage, thermal stress was reduced. The valves themselves could be soldered-in to avoid problems with plug-in bases, which could be unreliable. Flowers persisted with the idea and obtained support from the Director of the Research Station, W Gordon Radley.

Flowers and his team of some fifty people in the switching group spent eleven months from early February 1943 designing and building a machine that dispensed with the second tape of the Heath Robinson, by generating the wheel patterns electronically. Flowers used some of his own money for the project. This prototype, Mark 1 Colossus, contained 1,600 thermionic valves (tubes). It performed satisfactorily at Dollis Hill on 8 December 1943 and was dismantled and shipped to Bletchley Park, where it was delivered on 18 January and re-assembled by Harry Fensom and Don Horwood. It was operational in January and it successfully attacked its first message on 5 February 1944. It was a large structure and was dubbed &#x27;Colossus&#x27;. A memo held in the National Archives written by Max Newman on 18 January 1944 records that &quot;Colossus arrives today&quot;.

During the development of the prototype, an improved design had been developed – the Mark 2 Colossus. Four of these were ordered in March 1944 and by the end of April the number on order had been increased to twelve. Dollis Hill was put under pressure to have the first of these working by 1 June. Allen Coombs took over leadership of the production Mark 2 Colossi, the first of which – containing 2,400 valves – became operational at 08:00 on 1 June 1944, just in time for the Allied Invasion of Normandy on D-Day. Subsequently, Colossi were delivered at the rate of about one a month. By the time of V-E Day there were ten Colossi working at Bletchley Park and a start had been made on assembling an eleventh. Seven of the Colossi were used for &#x27;wheel setting&#x27; and three for &#x27;wheel breaking&#x27;.
The main units of the Mark 2 design were as follows.
* A tape transport with an 8-photocell reading mechanism.
* A six character FIFO shift register.
* Twelve thyratron ring stores that simulated the Lorenz machine generating a bit-stream for each wheel.
* Panels of switches for specifying the program and the &quot;set total&quot;.
* A set of functional units that performed Boolean operations.
* A &quot;span counter&quot; that could suspend counting for part of the tape.
* A master control that handled clocking, start and stop signals, counter readout and printing.
* Five electronic counters.
* An electric typewriter.

Most of the design of the electronics was the work of Tommy Flowers, assisted by William Chandler, Sidney Broadhurst and Allen Coombs; with Erie Speight and Arnold Lynch developing the photoelectric reading mechanism. Coombs remembered Flowers, having produced a rough draft of his design, tearing it into pieces that he handed out to his colleagues for them to do the detailed design and get their team to manufacture it. The Mark 2 Colossi were both five times faster and were simpler to operate than the prototype.

Data input to Colossus was by photoelectric reading of a paper tape transcription of the enciphered intercepted message. This was arranged in a continuous loop so that it could be read and re-read multiple times – there being no internal storage for the data. The design overcame the problem of synchronizing the electronics with the speed of the message tape by generating a clock signal from reading its sprocket holes. The speed of operation was thus limited by the mechanics of reading the tape. During development, the tape reader was tested up to 9700 characters per second (53 mph) before the tape disintegrated. So 5000 characters/second () was settled on as the speed for regular use. Flowers designed a 6-character shift register, which was used both for computing the delta function (ΔZ) and for testing five different possible starting points of Tunny&#x27;s wheels in the five processors. This five-way parallelism enabled five simultaneous tests and counts to be performed giving an effective processing speed of 25,000 characters per second. The computation used algorithms devised by W. T. Tutte and colleagues to decrypt a Tunny message.

==Operation==

The Newmanry was staffed by cryptanalysts, operators from the Women&#x27;s Royal Naval Service (WRNS) – known as &quot;Wrens&quot; – and engineers who were permanently on hand for maintenance and repair. By the end of the war the staffing was 272 Wrens and 27 men.

The first job in operating Colossus for a new message was to prepare the paper tape loop. This was performed by the Wrens who stuck the two ends together using Bostik glue, ensuring that there was a 150-character length of blank tape between the end and the start of the message. Using a special hand punch they inserted a start hole between the third and fourth channels sprocket holes from the end of the blank section, and a stop hole between the fourth and fifth channels sprocket holes from the end of the characters of the message. These were read by specially positioned photocells and indicated when the message was about to start and when it ended. The operator would then thread the paper tape through the gate and around the pulleys of the bedstead and adjust the tension. The two-tape bedstead design had been carried on from Heath Robinson so that one tape could be loaded whilst the previous one was being run. A switch on the Selection Panel specified the &quot;near&quot; or the &quot;far&quot; tape.

After performing various resetting and zeroizing tasks, the Wren operators would, under instruction from the cryptanalyst, operate the &quot;set total&quot; decade switches and the K2 panel switches to set the desired algorithm. They would then start the bedstead tape motor and lamp and, when the tape was up to speed, operate the master start switch.

==Programming==
Howard Campaigne, a mathematician and cryptanalyst from the US Navy&#x27;s OP-20-G, wrote the following in a foreword to Flowers&#x27; 1983 paper &quot;The Design of Colossus&quot;.

Colossus was not a stored-program computer. The input data for the five parallel processors was read from the looped message paper tape and the electronic pattern generators for the &quot;chi&quot;, &quot;psi&quot; and motor wheels. The programs for the processors were set and held on the switches and jack panel connections. Each processor could evaluate a Boolean function and count and display the number of times it yielded the specified value of &quot;false&quot; (0) or &quot;true&quot; (1) for each pass of the message tape.

Input to the processors came from two sources, the shift registers from tape reading and the thyratron rings that emulated the wheels of the Tunny machine. The characters on the paper tape were called Z and the characters from the Tunny emulator were referred to by the Greek letters that Bill Tutte had given them when working out the logical structure of the machine. On the selection panel, switches specified either Z or ΔZ, either formula_2 or Δformula_2 and either formula_4 or Δformula_4 for the data to be passed to the jack field and &#x27;K2 switch panel&#x27;. These signals from the wheel simulators could be specified as stepping on with each new pass of the message tape or not.

The K2 switch panel had a group of switches on the left-hand side to specify the algorithm. The switches on the right-hand side selected the counter to which the result was fed. The plugboard allowed less specialized conditions to be imposed. Overall the K2 switch panel switches and the plugboard allowed about five billion different combinations of the selected variables.

As an example: a set of runs for a message tape might initially involve two &quot;chi&quot; wheels, as in Tutte&#x27;s 1+2 algorithm. Such a two-wheel run was called a long run, taking on average eight minutes unless the parallelism was utilised to cut the time by a factor of five. The subsequent runs might only involve setting one &quot;chi&quot; wheel, giving a short run taking about two minutes. Initially, after the initial long run, the choice of the next algorithm to be tried was specified by the cryptanalyst. Experience showed, however, that decision trees for this iterative process could be produced for use by the Wren operators in a proportion of cases.

==Influence and fate==
Although the Colossus was the first of the electronic digital machines with programmability, albeit limited by modern standards, it was not a general-purpose machine, being designed for a range of cryptanalytic tasks, most involving counting the results of evaluating Boolean algorithms.

A Colossus computer was thus not a fully Turing complete machine. However, University of San Francisco professor Benjamin Wells has shown that if all ten Colossus machines made were rearranged in a specific cluster, then the entire set of computers could have simulated a universal Turing machine, and thus be Turing complete.

Colossus and the reasons for its construction were highly secret and remained so for 30 years after the War. Consequently, it was not included in the history of computing hardware for many years, and Flowers and his associates were deprived of the recognition they were due. All but two of the Colossi were dismantled after the war and parts returned to the Post Office. Some parts, sanitised as to their original purpose, were taken to Max Newman&#x27;s Royal Society Computing Machine Laboratory at Manchester University. Two Colossi, along with two Tunny machines, were retained and moved to GCHQ&#x27;s new headquarters at Eastcote in April 1946, and then to Cheltenham between 1952 and 1954. One of the Colossi, known as &quot;Colossus Blue&quot;, was dismantled in 1959; the other in the 1960s. Tommy Flowers was ordered to destroy all documentation. He duly burnt them in a furnace and later said of that order:
The Colossi were adapted for other purposes, with varying degrees of success; in their later years they were used for training. Jack Good related how he was the first to use Colossus after the war, persuading the US National Security Agency that it could be used to perform a function for which they were planning to build a special-purpose machine. Colossus was also used to perform character counts on one-time pad tape to test for non-randomness.

A small number of people who were associated with Colossus—and knew that large-scale, reliable, high-speed electronic digital computing devices were feasible—played significant roles in early computer work in the UK and probably in the US. However, being so secret, it had little direct influence on the development of later computers; it was EDVAC that was the seminal computer architecture of the time. In 1972, Herman Goldstine, who was unaware of Colossus and its legacy to the projects of people such as Alan Turing (ACE), Max Newman (Manchester computers) and Harry Huskey (Bendix G-15), wrote that,

Professor Brian Randell, who unearthed information about Colossus in the 1970s, commented on this, saying that:
Randell&#x27;s efforts started to bear fruit in the mid-1970s. The secrecy about Bletchley Park had been broken when Group Captain Winterbotham published his book &quot;The Ultra Secret&quot; in 1974. Randell was researching the history of computer science in Britain for a conference on the history of computing held at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, New Mexico on 10–15 June 1976, and got permission to present a paper on wartime development of the COLOSSI at the Post Office Research Station, Dollis Hill (in October 1975 the British Government had released a series of captioned photographs from the Public Record Office). The interest in the &quot;revelations&quot; in his paper resulted in a special evening meeting when Randell and Coombs answered further questions. Coombs later wrote that &quot;no member of our team could ever forget the fellowship, the sense of purpose and, above all, the breathless excitement of those days&quot;. In 1977 Randell published an article &quot;The First Electronic Computer&quot; in several journals. 

In October 2000, a 500-page technical report on the Tunny cipher and its cryptanalysis—entitled &quot;General Report on Tunny&quot;—was released by GCHQ to the national Public Record Office, and it contains a fascinating paean to Colossus by the cryptographers who worked with it:
==Reconstruction==

A team led by Tony Sale built a fully functional reconstruction of a Colossus Mark 2 between 1993 and 2008. In spite of the blueprints and hardware being destroyed, a surprising amount of material had survived, mainly in engineers&#x27; notebooks, but a considerable amount of it in the U.S. The optical tape reader might have posed the biggest problem, but Dr. Arnold Lynch, its original designer was able to redesign it to his own original specification. The reconstruction is on display, in the historically correct place for Colossus No. 9, at The National Museum of Computing, in H Block Bletchley Park in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire.

In November 2007, to celebrate the project completion and to mark the start of a fundraising initiative for The National Museum of Computing, a Cipher Challenge pitted the rebuilt Colossus against radio amateurs worldwide in being first to receive and decode three messages enciphered using the Lorenz SZ42 and transmitted from radio station DL0HNF in the &quot;Heinz Nixdorf MuseumsForum&quot; computer museum. The challenge was easily won by radio amateur Joachim Schüth, who had carefully prepared for the event and developed his own signal processing and code-breaking code using Ada. The Colossus team were hampered by their wish to use World War II radio equipment, delaying them by a day because of poor reception conditions. Nevertheless, the victor&#x27;s 1.4 GHz laptop, running his own code, took less than a minute to find the settings for all 12 wheels. The German codebreaker said: &quot;My laptop digested ciphertext at a speed of 1.2 million characters per second—240 times faster than Colossus. If you scale the CPU frequency by that factor, you get an equivalent clock of 5.8 MHz for Colossus. That is a remarkable speed for a computer built in 1944.&quot;

The Cipher Challenge verified the successful completion of the rebuilding project. &quot;On the strength of today&#x27;s performance Colossus is as good as it was six decades ago&quot;, commented Tony Sale. &quot;We are delighted to have produced a fitting tribute to the people who worked at Bletchley Park and whose brainpower devised these fantastic machines which broke these ciphers and shortened the war by many months.&quot;

==Other meanings==

There was a fictional computer named &quot;Colossus&quot; in the 1970 film &quot;&quot; which was based on the 1966 novel &quot;Colossus&quot; by D. F. Jones. This was a coincidence as it pre-dates the public release of information about Colossus, or even its name.

Neal Stephenson&#x27;s novel &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot; (1999) also contains a fictional treatment of the historical role played by Turing and Bletchley Park.

<text>The Canadian Shield ( ), also called the Laurentian Shield or the Laurentian Plateau, is a geologic shield, a large area of exposed Precambrian igneous and high-grade metamorphic rocks. It forms the North American Craton (or Laurentia), the ancient geologic core of the North American continent. Glaciation has left the area with only a thin layer of soil, through which exposures of igneous bedrock resulting from its long volcanic history are frequently visible. As a deep, common, joined bedrock region in eastern and central Canada, the shield stretches north from the Great Lakes to the Arctic Ocean, covering over half of Canada and most of Greenland; it also extends south into the northern reaches of the continental United States.

== Geographical extent ==
The Canadian Shield is a physiographic division comprising four smaller physiographic provinces: the Laurentian Upland, Kazan Region, Davis and James. The shield extends into the United States as the Adirondack Mountains (connected by the Frontenac Axis) and the Superior Upland. The Canadian Shield is a U-shaped subsection of the Laurentia craton signifying the area of greatest glacial impact (scraping down to bare rock) creating the thin soils. The age of the Canadian Shield is estimated to be 4.28 Ga. The Canadian Shield once had jagged peaks, higher than any of today&#x27;s mountains, but millions of years of erosion have changed these mountains to rolling hills.

The Canadian Shield is a collage of Archean plates and accreted juvenile arc terranes and sedimentary basins of the Proterozoic Eon that were progressively amalgamated during the interval 2.45–1.24 Ga, with the most substantial growth period occurring during the Trans-Hudson orogeny, between c. 1.90–1.80 Ga. The Canadian Shield was the first part of North America to be permanently elevated above sea level and has remained almost wholly untouched by successive encroachments of the sea upon the continent. It is the Earth&#x27;s greatest area of exposed Archean rock. The metamorphic base rocks are mostly from the Precambrian (between 4.5 Ga and 540 Ma) and have been repeatedly uplifted and eroded. Today it consists largely of an area of low relief above sea level with a few monadnocks and low mountain ranges (including the Laurentian Mountains) probably eroded from the plateau during the Cenozoic Era. During the Pleistocene Epoch, continental ice sheets depressed the land surface (creating Hudson Bay) but also tilted up its northeastern &quot;rim&quot; (the Torngat), scooped out thousands of lake basins, and carried away much of the region&#x27;s soil. The northeastern portion, however, became tilted up so that, in northern Labrador and Baffin Island, the land rises to more than 1,500 metres (5,000 feet) above sea level.

When the Greenland section is included, the Canadian Shield is approximately circular, bounded on the northeast by the northeast edge of Greenland, with Hudson Bay in the middle. It covers much of Greenland, all of Labrador and the Great Northern Peninsula of Newfoundland, most of Quebec north of the St. Lawrence River, much of Ontario including northern sections of the Ontario Peninsula, the Adirondack Mountains of New York, the northernmost part of Lower Michigan and all of Upper Michigan, northern Wisconsin, northeastern Minnesota, the central and northern portions of Manitoba, northern Saskatchewan, a small portion of northeastern Alberta, mainland Northwest Territories to the east of a line extended north from the Saskatchewan-Alberta border, most of Nunavut&#x27;s mainland and, of its Arctic Archipelago, Baffin Island and significant bands through Somerset, Southampton, Devon and Ellesmere islands. In total, the exposed area of the shield covers approximately . The true extent of the shield is greater still and stretches from the Western Cordillera in the west to the Appalachians in the east and as far south as Texas, but these regions are overlaid with much younger rocks and sediment.

== Geology ==
The Canadian Shield is among the oldest geologic areas on Earth, with regions dating from 2.5 to 4.2 billion years. The multitude of rivers and lakes in the region is classical example of a deranged drainage system, caused by the watersheds of the area being disturbed by glaciation and the effect of post-glacial rebound. The shield was originally an area of very large, very tall mountains (about ) with much volcanic activity, but the area was eroded to nearly its current topographic appearance of relatively low relief over 500 Ma. Erosion has exposed the roots of the mountains, which take the form of greenstone belts in which belts of volcanic rock that have been altered by metamorphism are surrounded by granitic rock. These belts range in age from 3.6 to 2.7 Ga. Much of the granitic rock belongs to the distinctive tonalite–trondhjemite–granodiorite family of rocks, which are characteristic of Archean continental crust. Many of Canada&#x27;s major ore deposits are associated with greenstone belts.

The Sturgeon Lake Caldera in Kenora District, Ontario, is one of the world&#x27;s best preserved mineralized Neoarchean caldera complexes, which is 2.7 Ga. The Canadian Shield also contains the Mackenzie dike swarm, which is the largest dike swarm known on Earth. The North American craton is the bedrock forming the heart of the North American continent, and the Canadian Shield is the largest exposed part of the craton&#x27;s bedrock. The Canadian Shield is part of an ancient continent called Arctica, which was formed about 2.5 Ga during the Neoarchean era.

Mountains have deep roots and float on the denser mantle much like an iceberg at sea. As mountains erode, their roots rise and are eroded in turn. The rocks that now form the surface of the shield were once far below the Earth&#x27;s surface. The high pressures and temperatures at those depths provided ideal conditions for mineralization. Although these mountains are now heavily eroded, many large mountains still exist in Canada&#x27;s far north called the Arctic Cordillera. This is a vast, deeply dissected mountain range, stretching from northernmost Ellesmere Island to the northernmost tip of Labrador. The range&#x27;s highest peak is Nunavut&#x27;s Barbeau Peak at above sea level. Precambrian rock is the major component of the bedrock.

== Ecology ==

The current surface expression of the shield is one of very thin soil lying on top of the bedrock, with many bare outcrops. This arrangement was caused by severe glaciation during the ice ages that covered the shield and scraped the rock clean. The lowlands of the Canadian Shield have a very dense soil that is not suitable for forestation; it also contains many marshes and bogs (muskegs). The rest of the region has coarse soil that does not retain moisture well and is frozen with permafrost throughout the year. Forests are not as dense in the north.

The shield is covered in parts by vast boreal forests in the south that support natural ecosystems as well as a major logging industry. The boreal forest area gives way to the Eastern Canadian Shield taiga that covers northern Quebec and most of Labrador. The Midwestern Canadian Shield forests that run westwards from Northwestern Ontario have boreal forests that give way to taiga in the most northerly parts of Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Hydrologic drainage is generally poor, the soil compacting effects of glaciation being one of the many causes. Tundra typically prevails in the northern regions. 

Many mammals such as beaver, caribou, white-tailed deer, moose, wolves, wolverines, weasels, mink, otters, grizzly bear, polar bears and black bears are present. In the case of polar bears (), the shield area contains many of their denning locations, such as the Wapusk National Park.
The many lakes and rivers on the shield contain a plentiful quantity of different sports fish species, including walleye, northern pike, lake trout, yellow perch, whitefish, brook trout, arctic grayling, and many types of baitfish. The water surfaces are also home to many waterfowl, most notably Canada geese, loons and gulls. The vast forests contain a myriad population of other birds, including ravens and crows, predatory birds and many songbirds.

== Mining and economics ==
The Canadian Shield is one of the world&#x27;s richest areas in terms of mineral ores. It is filled with substantial deposits of nickel, gold, silver, and copper. There are many mining towns extracting these minerals. The largest, and one of the best known, is Sudbury, Ontario. Sudbury is an exception to the normal process of forming minerals in the shield since the Sudbury Basin is an ancient meteorite impact crater. Ejecta from the meteorite impact was found in the Rove Formation in May 2007. The nearby but less-known Temagami Magnetic Anomaly has striking similarities to the Sudbury Basin. This suggests it could be a second metal-rich impact crater. In northeastern Quebec, the giant Manicouagan Reservoir is the site of an extensive hydroelectric project (Manic-cinq, or Manic-5). This is one of the largest-known meteorite impact craters on Earth, though not as large as the Sudbury crater.

The Flin Flon greenstone belt in central Manitoba and east-central Saskatchewan &quot;is one of the largest Paleoproterozoic volcanic-hosted massive sulfide (VMS) districts in the world, containing 27 copper-zinc-(gold) deposits from which more than 183 million tonnes of sulfide have been mined.&quot; The portion in the Northwest Territories has recently been the site of several major diamond discoveries. The kimberlite pipes in which the diamonds are found are closely associated with cratons, which provide the deep lithospheric mantle required to stabilize diamond as a mineral. The kimberlite eruptions then bring the diamonds from over depth to the surface. The Ekati and Diavik mines are actively mining kimberlite diamonds.

<text>A comic book, comic-[[magazine]], or simply comic is a publication that consists of comics art in the form of sequential juxtaposed panels that represent individual scenes. Panels are often accompanied by descriptive prose and written narrative, usually dialogue contained in word balloons emblematic of the comics art form.

&quot;Comic Cuts&quot; was a British comic published from 1890 to 1953. It was preceded by &quot;Ally Sloper&#x27;s Half Holiday&quot; (1884), which is notable for its use of sequential cartoons to unfold narrative. These British comics existed alongside the popular lurid &quot;penny dreadfuls&quot; (such as &quot;Spring-heeled Jack&quot;), boys&#x27; &quot;story papers&quot; and the humorous &quot;Punch&quot; magazine, which was the first to use the term &quot;cartoon&quot; in its modern sense of a humorous drawing.

The first modern American-style comic book, &quot;Famous Funnies: A Carnival of Comics&quot;, was released in the U.S. in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor comic strips, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics. The term &quot;comic book&quot; derives from American comic books once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone.

The largest comic book market is Japan. By 1995, the manga market in Japan was valued at (), with annual sales of 1.9billion manga books ( volumes and manga magazines) in Japan, equivalent to 15issues per person. In 2020 the manga market in Japan reached a new record value of due to a fast growth of digital manga sales as well as an increase in print sales. The comic book market in the United States and Canada was valued at in 2016. , the largest comic book publisher in the United States is manga distributor Viz Media, followed by DC Comics and Marvel Comics featuring superhero comics franchises such as Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Spider-Man, the Incredible Hulk, and the X-Men. The best-selling comic book categories in the US are juvenile children&#x27;s fiction at 41%, manga at 28% and superhero comics at 10% of the market. Another major comic book market is France, where Franco-Belgian comics and Japanese manga each represent 40% of the market, followed by American comics at 10% market share.

==Structure==
Comic books heavily rely on their organization and visual presentation. Authors dedicate significant attention to aspects like page layout, size, orientation, and the positioning of panels. These characteristics are crucial for effectively conveying the content and messages within the comic book. Key components of comic books encompass panels, speech bubbles (also known as balloons), text lines, and characters. Speech balloons generally take the form of convex containers that hold character dialogue and are connected to the character via a tail element. The tail comprises an origin, path, tip, and directional point. The creation of comic books involves several essential steps: writing, drawing, and coloring. Various technological tools and methods are employed to craft comic books, incorporating concepts such as directions, axes, data, and metrics. Following these formatting guidelines, the process unfolds with writing, drawing, and coloring. In the United States, the term &quot;comic book&quot;, is generally used for comics periodicals and trade paperbacks while &quot;graphic novel&quot; is the term used for standalone books.

==American comic books==

Comics as a print medium have existed in the United States since the printing of &quot;The Adventures of Mr. Obadiah Oldbuck&quot; in 1842 in hardcover, making it the first known American prototype comic book. Proto-comics periodicals began appearing early in the 20th century, with the first comic standard-sized comic being &quot;Funnies on Parade&quot;. &quot;Funnies on Parades&quot; was the first book that established the size, duration, and format of the modern comic book. Following this was, Dell Publishing&#x27;s 36-page &quot;Famous Funnies: A Carnival of Comics&quot; as the first true newsstand American comic book; Goulart, for example, calls it &quot;the cornerstone for one of the most lucrative branches of magazine publishing&quot;. In 1905 G.W. Dillingham Company published 24 select strips by the cartoonist Gustave Verbeek in an anthology book called &#x27;The Incredible Upside-Downs of Little Lady Lovekins and Old Man Muffaroo&#x27;. The introduction of Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster&#x27;s Superman in 1938 turned comic books into a major industry and ushered in the Golden Age of Comic Books. The Golden Age originated the archetype of the superhero. According to historian Michael A. Amundson, appealing comic-book characters helped ease young readers&#x27; fear of nuclear war and neutralize anxiety about the questions posed by atomic power.

Historians generally divide the timeline of the American comic book into eras. The Golden Age of Comic Books began in 1938, with the debut of Superman in Action Comics #1, published by Detective Comics (predecessor of DC Comics), which is generally considered the beginning of the modern comic book as it is known today. The Silver Age of Comic Books is generally considered to date from the first successful revival of the then-dormant superhero form, with the debut of the Flash in &quot;Showcase&quot; #4 (Oct. 1956). The Silver Age lasted through the late 1960s or early 1970s, during which time Marvel Comics revolutionized the medium with such naturalistic superheroes as Stan Lee and Jack Kirby&#x27;s Fantastic Four and Lee and Steve Ditko&#x27;s Spider-Man. The demarcation between the Silver Age and the following era, the Bronze Age of Comic Books, is less well-defined, with the Bronze Age running from the very early 1970s through the mid-1980s. The Modern Age of Comic Books runs from the mid-1980s to the present day.

A significant event in the timeline of American comic books occurred when psychiatrist Fredric Wertham voiced his criticisms of the medium through his book &quot;Seduction of the Innocent&quot; (1954). This critique led to the involvement of the American Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency, which launched an investigation into comic books. Wertham argued that comic books were accountable for a surge in juvenile delinquency and posed a potential impact on a child&#x27;s sexuality and moral values. In response to attention from the government and from the media, the US comic book industry set up the Comics Magazine Association of America. The CMAA instilled the Comics Code Authority in 1954 and drafted the self-censorship Comics Code that year, which required all comic books to go through a process of approval. It was not until the 1970s that comic books could be published without passing through the inspection of the CMAA. The Code was made formally defunct in November 2011.

=== Underground comic books ===
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, a surge of creativity emerged in what became known as underground comix. Published and distributed independently of the established comics industry, most of such comics reflected the youth counterculture and drug culture of the time. Underground comix &quot;reflected and commented on the social divisions and tensions of American society&quot;. Many had an uninhibited, often irreverent style; their frank depictions of nudity, sex, profanity, and politics had no parallel outside their precursors, the pornographic and even more obscure &quot;Tijuana bibles&quot;. Underground comics were almost never sold at newsstands, but rather in such youth-oriented outlets as head shops and record stores, as well as by mail order. The underground comics encouraged creators to publish their work independently so that they would have full ownership rights to their characters.

Frank Stack&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Jesus&quot;, published under the name Foolbert Sturgeon, has been credited as the first underground comix; while R. Crumb and the crew of cartoonists who worked on &quot;Zap Comix&quot; popularized the form.

===Alternative comics===
The rise of comic book specialty stores in the late 1970s created and paralleled a dedicated market for &quot;independent&quot; or &quot;alternative comics&quot; in the US. The first such comics included the anthology series &quot;Star Reach&quot;, published by comic book writer Mike Friedrich from 1974 to 1979, and Harvey Pekar&#x27;s &quot;American Splendor&quot;, which continued sporadic publication into the 21st century and which Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini adapted into a 2003 film. Some independent comics continued in the tradition of underground comics. While their content generally remained less explicit, others resembled the output of mainstream publishers in format and genre but were published by smaller artist-owned companies or by single artists. A few (notably &quot;RAW&quot;) represented experimental attempts to bring comics closer to the status of fine art.

During the 1970s the &quot;small press&quot; culture grew and diversified. By the 1980s, several independent publishers – such as Pacific, Eclipse, First, , and Fantagraphics – had started releasing a wide range of styles and formats—from color-superhero, detective, and science-fiction comic books to black-and-white magazine-format stories of Latin American magical realism.

A number of small publishers in the 1990s, changed the format and distribution of their comics to more closely resemble non-comics publishing. The &quot;minicomics&quot; form, an extremely informal version of self-publishing, arose in the 1980s and became increasingly popular among artists in the 1990s, despite reaching an even more limited audience than the small press.

Small publishers regularly releasing titles include Avatar Press, Hyperwerks, Raytoons, and Terminal Press, buoyed by such advances in printing technology as digital print-on-demand.

===Graphic novels===
In 1964, Richard Kyle coined the term &quot;graphic novel&quot;.

Precursors of the form existed by the 1920s, which saw a revival of the medieval woodcut tradition by Belgian Frans Masereel, American Lynd Ward and others, including Stan Lee.

In 1947, Fawcett Publications published &quot;Comics Novel No. 1&quot;, as the first in an intended series of these &quot;comics novels&quot;. The story in the first issue was &quot;Anarcho, Dictator of Death&quot;, a five chapter spy genre tale written by Otto Binder and drawn by Al Carreno. It is readable online in the Digital Comic Museum. The magazine never reached a second issue.

In 1950, St. John Publications produced the digest-sized, adult-oriented &quot;picture novel&quot; &quot;It Rhymes with Lust&quot;, a 128-page digest by pseudonymous writer &quot;Drake Waller&quot; (Arnold Drake and Leslie Waller), penciler Matt Baker and inker Ray Osrin, touted as &quot;an original full-length novel&quot; on its cover. &quot;It Rhymes with Lust&quot; is also available to read online in the Digital Comic Museum.

In 1971, writer-artist Gil Kane and collaborators applied a paperback format to their &quot;comics novel&quot; &quot;Blackmark&quot;. Will Eisner popularized the term &quot;graphic novel&quot; when he used it on the cover of the paperback edition of his work &quot;A Contract with God, and Other Tenement Stories&quot; in 1978 and, subsequently, the usage of the term began to increase.

===Digital comics===
===Market size===
In 2017, the comic book market size for North America was just over $1 billion with digital sales being flat, book stores having a 1% decline, and comic book stores having a 10% decline over 2016. The global comic book market saw a substantial 12% growth in 2020, reaching a total worth of US$8.49 billion. This positive trajectory continued in 2021, with the market&#x27;s annual valuation surging to US$9.21 billion. The rising popularity of comic books can be attributed to heightened global interest, driven significantly by collaborative efforts among diverse brands. These collaborations are geared towards producing more engaging and appealing comic content, contributing to the industry&#x27;s continued growth.

===Comic book collecting===
The 1970s saw the advent of specialty comic book stores. Initially, comic books were marketed by publishers to children because comic books were perceived as children&#x27;s entertainment. However, with increasing recognition of comics as an art form and the growing pop culture presence of comic book conventions, they are now embraced by many adults.

Comic book collectors often exhibit a lifelong passion for the stories within comics, often focusing on specific superheroes and striving to gather a complete collection of a particular series. Comics are assigned sequential numbers, and the initial issue of a long-lasting comic book series tends to be both the scarcest and the most coveted among collectors. The introduction of a new character might occur within an existing title. For instance, the first appearance of Spider-Man took place in &quot;Amazing Fantasy&quot; #15. New characters were frequently introduced in this manner, waiting for an established audience before launching their own titles. Consequently, comics featuring the debut appearance of a significant character can sometimes be even more challenging to locate than the inaugural issue of that character&#x27;s standalone series.

Some rare comic books include copies of the unreleased &quot;Motion Picture Funnies Weekly&quot; #1 from 1939. Eight copies, plus one without a cover, emerged in the estate of the deceased publisher in 1974. The &quot;Pay Copy&quot; of this book sold for $43,125 in a 2005 Heritage auction.

The most valuable American comics have combined rarity and quality with the first appearances of popular and enduring characters. Four comic books have sold for over US$1 million , including two examples of &quot;Action Comics&quot; #1, the first appearance of Superman, both sold privately through online dealer ComicConnect.com in 2010, and &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #27, the first appearance of Batman, via public auction.

Updating the above price obtained for &quot;Action Comics&quot; #1, the first appearance of Superman, the highest sale on record for this book is $3.2 million, for a 9.0 copy. 

Misprints, promotional comic-dealer incentive printings, and issues with exceptionally low distribution tend to possess scarcity value in the comic book market. The rarest modern comic books include the original press run of &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot; #5, which DC executive Paul Levitz recalled and pulped due to the appearance of a vintage Victorian era advertisement for &quot;Marvel Douche&quot;, which the publisher considered offensive; only 100 copies exist, most of which have been CGC graded. (See Recalled comics for more pulped, recalled, and erroneous comics.)

In 2000, a company named Comics Guaranty (CGC) initiated the practice of &quot;slabbing&quot; comics, which involves encasing them within thick plastic cases and assigning them a numerical grade. This approach inspired the emergence of Comic Book Certification Service. Given the significance of condition in determining the value of rare comics, the concept of grading by an impartial company, one that does not engage in buying or selling comics, seemed promising. Nevertheless, there is an ongoing debate regarding whether the relatively high cost of this grading service is justified and whether it serves the interests of collectors or mainly caters to speculators seeking rapid profits, akin to trading in stocks or fine art. Comic grading has played a role in establishing standards for valuation, which online price guides such as GoCollect and GPAnalysis utilize to provide real-time market value information.

Collectors also seek out the original artwork pages from comic books, which are perhaps the most rarefied items in the realm of comic book collecting. These pages hold unparalleled scarcity due to the fact that there exists only one unique page of artwork for every page that was printed and published.

The creation of these original artwork pages involves a collaborative effort: a writer crafts the story, a pencil artist designs the sequential panels on the page, an ink artist goes over the pencil with pen and ink, a letterer provides the dialogue and narration through hand-lettering, and finally, a colorist adds color as the final touch before the pages are sent to the printer.

When the printer returns the original artwork pages, they are typically returned to the artists themselves. These artists sometimes opt to sell these pages at comic book conventions, in galleries, and at art shows centered around comic book art. The original pages from DC and Marvel, featuring the debut appearances of iconic characters such as Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, the Flash, Captain Marvel, Spider-Man, the Incredible Hulk, Iron Man, Captain America and the Mighty Thor are regarded as priceless treasures within the comic book world.

===History of race in U.S. comic books===

Many early iterations of black characters in comics &quot;became variations on the &#x27;single stereotypical image of Sambo&#x27;.&quot; Sambo was closely related to the coon stereotype but had some subtle differences. They are both a derogatory way of portraying black characters. &quot;The name itself, an abbreviation of raccoon, is dehumanizing. As with Sambo, the coon was portrayed as a lazy, easily frightened, chronically idle, inarticulate, buffoon.&quot; This portrayal &quot;was of course another attempt to solidify the intellectual inferiority of the black race through popular culture.&quot; However, in the 1940s there was a change in portrayal of black characters. &quot;A cursory glance...might give the impression that situations had improved for African Americans in comics.&quot; In many comics being produced in this time there was a major push for tolerance between races. &quot;These equality minded heroes began to spring to action just as African Americans were being asked to participate in the war effort.&quot;

During this time, a government ran program, the Writers&#x27; War Board, became heavily involved in what would be published in comics. &quot;The Writers&#x27; War Board used comic books to shape popular perceptions of race and ethnicity...&quot; Not only were they using comic books as a means of recruiting all Americans, they were also using it as propaganda to &quot;[construct] a justification for race-based hatred of America&#x27;s foreign enemies.&quot; The Writers&#x27; War Board created comics books that were meant to &quot;[promote] domestic racial harmony&quot;. However, &quot;these pro-tolerance narratives struggled to overcome the popular and widely understood negative tropes used for decades in American mass culture...&quot;. However, they were not accomplishing this agenda within all of their comics.

In the comic series &quot;Captain Marvel Adventures&quot;, there was a character named Steamboat who embodied a collection of highly negative stereotypes prevalent during that period. The Writers&#x27; War Board did not request any alterations to this character despite the problematic portrayal. The removal of Steamboat from the series only came about due to the persistent advocacy of a black youth group based in New York City.&quot; Originally their request was refused by individuals working on the comic stating, &quot;&quot;Captain Marvel Adventures&quot; included many kinds of caricatures &#x27;for the sake of humor&#x27;.&quot; The black youth group responded with &quot;this is not the Negro race, but your one-and-a-half millions readers will think it so.&quot; Afterwards, Steamboat disappeared from the comics all together. There was a comic created about the 99th Squadron, also known as the Tuskegee Airmen, an all-black air force unit. Instead of making the comic about their story, the comic was about Hop Harrigan. A white pilot who captures a Nazi, shows him videos of the 99th Squadron defeating his men and then reveals to the Nazi that his men were defeated by African Americans which infuriated him as he sees them as a less superior race and cannot believe they bested his men.&quot;The Tuskegee Airmen, and images of black aviators appear in just three of the fifty three panels... the pilots of the 99th Squadron have no dialogue and interact with neither Hop Harrigan nor his Nazi captive.&quot; During this time, they also used black characters in comic books as a means to invalidate the militant black groups that were fighting for equality within the U.S. &quot;Spider-Man &#x27;made it clear that militant black power was not the remedy for racial injustice&#x27;.&quot; &quot;The Falcon openly criticized black behavior stating&#x27; maybe it&#x27;s important us to cool things down-so we can protect the rights we been fightin&#x27; for&#x27;.&quot; This portrayal and character development of black characters can be partially blamed on the fact that, during this time, &quot;there had rarely been a black artist or writer allowed in a major comics company.&quot;

Asian characters within comic books encountered similar prejudiced treatment as black characters did. They were subjected to dehumanizing depictions, with narratives often portraying them as &quot;incompetent and subhuman.&quot; In a 1944 edition of the publication &quot;United States Marines&quot;, there was a story titled &quot;The Smell of the Monkeymen&quot;. This narrative portrayed Japanese soldiers as brutish simians, and it depicted their concealed positions being betrayed by their repugnant body odor. Chinese characters received the same treatment. &quot;By the time the United States entered WWII, negative perceptions of Chinese were an established part of mass culture...&quot; However, concerned that the Japanese could use America&#x27;s anti-Chinese material as propaganda they began &quot;to present a more positive image of America&#x27;s Chinese allies...&quot; Just as they tried to show better representation for Black people in comics they did the same for Asian people. However, &quot;Japanese and Filipino characters were visually indistinguishable. Both groups have grotesque buckteeth, tattered clothing, and bright yellow skin.&quot; &quot;Publishers depicted America&#x27;s Asian allies through derogatory images and language honed over the preceding decades.&quot; Asian characters were previously portrayed as, &quot;ghastly yellow demons&quot;. During WWII, &quot;[every] major superhero worth his spandex devoted himself to the eradication of Asian invaders.&quot; There was &quot;a constant relay race in which one Asian culture merely handed off the baton of hatred to another with no perceptible changes in the manner in which the characters would be portrayed.&quot;

&quot;The only specific depiction of a Hispanic superhero did not end well. In 1975, Marvel gave us Hector Ayala (a.k.a. The White Tiger).&quot; &quot;Although he fought for several years alongside the likes of much more popular heroes such as Spider-Man and Daredevil, he only lasted six years before sales of comics featuring him got so bad that Marvel had him retire. The most famous Hispanic character is Bane, a villain from Batman.&quot;

The Native American representation in comic books &quot;can be summed up in the noble savage stereotype&quot; &quot; a recurring theme...urged American indians to abandon their traditional hostility towards the United States. They were the ones painted as intolerant and disrespectful of the dominant concerns of white America&quot;.

===Japanese manga===
Manga (漫画) are comic books or graphic novels originating from Japan. Most manga conform to a style developed in Japan in the late 19th century, though the art form has a long prehistory in earlier Japanese art. The term &quot;manga&quot; is used in Japan to refer to both comics and cartooning in general. Outside Japan, the word is typically used to refer to comics originally published in the country.

===Dōjinshi===
, fan-made Japanese comics, operate in a far larger market in Japan than the American &quot;underground comix&quot; market; the largest dōjinshi fair, Comiket, attracts 500,000 visitors twice a year.

===Korean manhwa===
Manhwa (만화) are comic books or graphic novels originating from Korea. The term &quot;manhwa&quot; is used in Korea to refer to both comics and cartooning in general. Outside Korea, the term usually refers to comics originally published in Korea. Manhwa is greatly influenced by Japanese Manga comics though it differs from manga and manhua with its own distinct features.

===Webtoons===
Webtoons have become popular in South Korea as a new way to read comics. Thanks in part to different censorship rules, color and unique visual effects, and optimization for easier reading on smartphones and computers. More manhwa have made the switch from traditional print manhwa to online webtoons thanks to better pay and more freedom than traditional print manhwa. The webtoon format has also expanded to other countries outside of Korea like China, Japan, Southeast Asia, and Western countries. Major webtoon distributors include Lezhin, Naver, and Kakao.

===Chinese manhua===

==European comics==
===Franco-Belgian comics===
France and Belgium have a long tradition in comics and comic books, often called &quot;BDs&quot; (an abbreviation of &quot;bandes dessinées&quot;, meaning literally &quot;drawn strips&quot;) in French, and &quot;strips&quot; in Dutch or Flemish. Belgian comic books originally written in Dutch show the influence of the Francophone &quot;Franco-Belgian&quot; comics but have their own distinct style.

===British comics===

Although &quot;Ally Sloper&#x27;s Half Holiday&quot; (1884) was aimed at an adult market, publishers quickly targeted a younger demographic, which has led to most publications being for children and has created an association in the public&#x27;s mind of comics as somewhat juvenile. &quot;The Guardian&quot; refers to Ally Sloper as &quot;one of the world&#x27;s first iconic cartoon characters&quot;, and &quot;as famous in Victorian Britain as Dennis the Menace would be a century later.&quot; British comics in the early 20th century typically evolved from illustrated penny dreadfuls of the Victorian era (featuring Sweeney Todd, Dick Turpin and &quot;Varney the Vampire&quot;). First published in the 1830s, penny dreadfuls were &quot;Britain&#x27;s first taste of mass-produced popular culture for the young.&quot;
The two most popular British comic books, &quot;The Beano&quot; and &quot;The Dandy&quot;, were first published by DC Thomson in the 1930s. By 1950 the weekly circulation of both reached 2 million. Explaining the enormous popularity of comics in the UK during this period, Anita O&#x27;Brien, director curator at London&#x27;s Cartoon Museum, states: &quot;When comics like the Beano and Dandy were invented back in the 1930s – and through really to the 1950s and 60s – these comics were almost the only entertainment available to children.&quot; &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; was created in the 1950s, which saw sales for &quot;The Beano&quot; soar. He features in the cover of &quot;The Beano&quot;, with the BBC referring to him as the &quot;definitive naughty boy of the comic world.&quot;

In 1954, &quot;Tiger&quot; comics introduced &quot;Roy of the Rovers&quot;, the hugely popular football based strip recounting the life of Roy Race and the team he played for, Melchester Rovers. The stock media phrase &quot;real &#x27;Roy of the Rovers&#x27; stuff&quot; is often used by football writers, commentators and fans when describing displays of great skill, or surprising results that go against the odds, in reference to the dramatic storylines that were the strip&#x27;s trademark. Other comic books such as &quot;Eagle&quot;, &quot;Valiant&quot;, &quot;Warrior&quot;, &quot;Viz&quot; and &quot;2000 AD&quot; also flourished. Some comics, such as &quot;Judge Dredd&quot; and other &quot;2000 AD&quot; titles, have been published in a tabloid form. Underground comics and &quot;small press&quot; titles have also appeared in the UK, notably &quot;Oz&quot; and &quot;Escape Magazine&quot;.

The content of &quot;Action&quot;, another title aimed at children and launched in the mid-1970s, became the subject of discussion in the House of Commons. Although on a smaller scale than similar investigations in the US, such concerns led to a moderation of content published within British comics. Such moderation never became formalized to the extent of promulgating a code, nor did it last long. The UK has also established a healthy market in the reprinting and repackaging of material, notably material originating in the US. The lack of reliable supplies of American comic books led to a variety of black-and-white reprints, including Marvel&#x27;s monster comics of the 1950s, Fawcett&#x27;s Captain Marvel, and other characters such as Sheena, Mandrake the Magician, and the Phantom. Several reprint companies became involved in repackaging American material for the British market, notably the importer and distributor Thorpe &amp; Porter. Marvel Comics established a UK office in 1972. DC Comics and Dark Horse Comics also opened offices in the 1990s. The repackaging of European material has occurred less frequently, although &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; and &quot;Asterix&quot; serials have been successfully translated and repackaged in softcover books. The number of European comics available in the UK has increased in the last two decades. The British company Cinebook, founded in 2005, has released English translated versions of many European series.

In the 1980s, a resurgence of British writers and artists gained prominence in mainstream comic books, which was dubbed the &quot;British Invasion&quot; in comic book history. These writers and artists brought with them their own mature themes and philosophy such as anarchy, controversy and politics common in British media. These elements would pave the way for mature and &quot;darker and edgier&quot; comic books and jump start the Modern Age of Comics. Writers included Alan Moore, famous for his &quot;V for Vendetta&quot;, &quot;From Hell&quot;, &quot;Watchmen&quot;, &quot;Marvelman&quot;, and &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot;; Neil Gaiman with &quot;The Sandman&quot; mythos and &quot;Books of Magic&quot;; Warren Ellis, creator of &quot;Transmetropolitan&quot; and &quot;Planetary&quot;; and others such as Mark Millar, creator of &quot;Wanted&quot; and &quot;Kick-Ass&quot;. The comic book series &quot;John Constantine, Hellblazer&quot;, which is largely set in Britain and starring the magician John Constantine, paved the way for British writers such as Jamie Delano.

The English musician Peter Gabriel issued in 2000 The Story of OVO which was released in a CD-booklet-shaped comic book as part of the CD edition with the title &quot;OVO The Millennium Show&quot;. The 2000 Millennium Dome Show based on it.

At Christmas, publishers repackage and commission material for comic annuals, printed and bound as hardcover A4-size books; &quot;Rupert&quot; supplies a famous example of the British comic annual. DC Thomson also repackages &quot;The Broons&quot; and &quot;Oor Wullie&quot; strips in softcover A4-size books for the holiday season.

On 19 March 2012, the British postal service, the Royal Mail, released a set of stamps depicting British comic book characters and series. The collection featured &quot;The Beano&quot;, &quot;The Dandy&quot;, &quot;Eagle&quot;, &quot;The Topper&quot;, &quot;Roy of the Rovers&quot;, &quot;Bunty&quot;, &quot;Buster&quot;, &quot;Valiant&quot;, &quot;Twinkle&quot; and &quot;2000 AD&quot;.

===Spanish comics===
It has been stated that the 13th century &quot;Cantigas de Santa María&quot; could be considered as the first Spanish &quot;comic&quot;, although comic books (also known in Spain as &quot;historietas&quot; or &quot;tebeos&quot;) made their debut around 1857. The magazine &quot;TBO&quot; was influential in popularizing the medium. After the Spanish Civil War, the Franco regime imposed strict censorship in all media: superhero comics were forbidden and as a result, comic heroes were based on historical fiction (in 1944 the medieval hero &quot;El Guerrero del Antifaz&quot; was created by Manuel Gago and another popular medieval hero, &quot;Capitán Trueno&quot;, was created in 1956 by Víctor Mora and Miguel Ambrosio Zaragoza). Two publishing houses — Editorial Bruguera and Editorial Valenciana — dominated the Spanish comics market during its golden age (1950–1970). The most popular comics showed a recognizable style of slapstick humor (influenced by Franco-Belgian authors such as Franquin): Escobar&#x27;s &quot;Carpanta&quot; and &quot;Zipi y Zape&quot;, Vázquez&#x27;s &quot;Las hermanas Gilda&quot; and &quot;Anacleto,&quot; Ibáñez&#x27;s &quot;Mortadelo y Filemón&quot; and &quot;13. Rue del Percebe&quot; or Jan&#x27;s &quot;Superlópez&quot;. After the end of the Francoist period, there was an increased interest in adult comics with magazines such as &quot;Totem&quot;, &quot;El Jueves&quot;, &quot;1984&quot;, and &quot;El Víbora,&quot; and works such as &quot;Paracuellos&quot; by Carlos Giménez.

Spanish artists have traditionally worked in other markets finding great success, either in the American (e.g., Eisner Award winners Sergio Aragonés, Salvador Larroca, Gabriel Hernández Walta, Marcos Martín or David Aja), the British (e.g., Carlos Ezquerra, co-creator of &quot;Judge Dredd&quot;) or the Franco-Belgian one (e.g., Fauve d&#x27;Or winner Julio Ribera or &quot;Blacksad&quot; authors Juan Díaz Canales and Juanjo Guarnido).

===Italian comics===
In Italy, comics (known in Italian as &quot;fumetti&quot;) made their debut as humor strips at the end of the 19th century, and later evolved into adventure stories. After World War II, however, artists like Hugo Pratt and Guido Crepax exposed Italian comics to an international audience. Popular comic books such as &quot;Diabolik&quot; or the &quot;Bonelli&quot; line—namely &quot;Tex Willer&quot; or &quot;Dylan Dog&quot;—remain best-sellers.

Mainstream comics are usually published on a monthly basis, in a black-and-white digest size format, with approximately 100 to 132 pages. Collections of classic material for the most famous characters, usually with more than 200 pages, are also common. Author comics are published in the French BD format, with an example being Pratt&#x27;s &quot;Corto Maltese&quot;.

Italian cartoonists show the influence of comics from other countries, including France, Belgium, Spain, and Argentina. Italy is also famous for being one of the foremost producers of Walt Disney comic stories outside the US; Donald Duck&#x27;s superhero alter ego, Paperinik, known in English as Superduck, was created in Italy.

==Comics in other countries==
==Distribution==
The comic book industry has struggled with distribution issues throughout its history, as numerous mainstream retailers have been hesitant to stock substantial quantities of the most engaging and sought-after comics. The smartphone and the tablet have turned out to be an ideal medium for online distribution.

===Digital distribution===
On 13 November 2007, Marvel Comics launched Marvel Digital Comics Unlimited, a subscription service allowing readers to read many comics from Marvel&#x27;s history online. The service also includes periodic release new comics not available elsewhere. With the release of &quot;Avenging Spider-Man&quot; #1, Marvel also became the first publisher to provide free digital copies as part of the print copy of the comic book.

With the growing popularity of smartphones and tablets, many major publishers have begun releasing titles in digital form. The most popular platform is comiXology. Some platforms, such as Graphicly, have shut down.

== Comic collections in libraries ==
Numerous libraries house extensive collections of comics in the form of graphic novels. This serves as a convenient means for the general public to become acquainted with the medium.

== Guinness World Records ==
In 2015, the Japanese manga artist Eiichiro Oda was awarded the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; title for having the &quot;Most copies published for the same comic book series by a single author&quot;. His manga series &quot;One Piece&quot;, which he writes and illustrates, has been serialized in the Japanese magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; since December 1997, and by 2015, 77 collected volumes had been released. &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; reported in their announcement that the collected volumes of the series had sold a total of 320,866,000 units. &quot;One Piece&quot; also holds the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; title for &quot;Most copies published for the same manga series&quot;.

On 5 August 2018, the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; title for the &quot;Largest comic book ever published&quot; was awarded to the Brazilian comic book &quot;Turma da Mônica — O Maior Gibi do Mundo!&quot;, published by Panini Comics Brasil and Mauricio de Sousa Produções. The comic book measures . The 18-page comic book had a print run of 120 copies.

With the July 2021 publication of the 201st collected volume of his manga series &quot;Golgo 13&quot;, Japanese manga artist Takao Saito was awarded the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; title for &quot;Most volumes published for a single manga series.&quot; &quot;Golgo 13&quot; has been continuously serialized in the Japanese magazine &quot;Big Comic&quot; since October 1968, which also makes it the oldest manga still in publication.

<text>In topology and related branches of mathematics, a connected space is a topological space that cannot be represented as the union of two or more disjoint non-empty open subsets. Connectedness is one of the principal topological properties that are used to distinguish topological spaces.

A subset of a topological space formula_1 is a  if it is a connected space when viewed as a subspace of formula_1.

Some related but stronger conditions are path connected, simply connected, and formula_3-connected. Another related notion is &quot;locally connected&quot;, which neither implies nor follows from connectedness.

==Formal definition==
A topological space formula_1 is said to be if it is the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets. Otherwise, formula_1 is said to be connected. A subset of a topological space is said to be connected if it is connected under its subspace topology. Some authors exclude the empty set (with its unique topology) as a connected space, but this article does not follow that practice.

For a topological space formula_1 the following conditions are equivalent:

#formula_1 is connected, that is, it cannot be divided into two disjoint non-empty open sets.
#The only subsets of formula_1 which are both open and closed (clopen sets) are formula_1 and the empty set.
#The only subsets of formula_1 with empty boundary are formula_1 and the empty set.
#formula_1 cannot be written as the union of two non-empty separated sets (sets for which each is disjoint from the other&#x27;s closure). 
#All continuous functions from formula_1 to formula_14 are constant, where formula_14 is the two-point space endowed with the discrete topology.

Historically this modern formulation of the notion of connectedness (in terms of no partition of formula_1 into two separated sets) first appeared (independently) with N.J. Lennes, Frigyes Riesz, and Felix Hausdorff at the beginning of the 20th century. See for details.

===Connected components===

Given some point formula_17 in a topological space formula_18 the union of any collection of connected subsets such that each contains formula_17 will once again be a connected subset. 
The connected component of a point formula_17 in formula_1 is the union of all connected subsets of formula_1 that contain formula_23 it is the unique largest (with respect to formula_24) connected subset of formula_1 that contains formula_26 
The maximal connected subsets (ordered by inclusion formula_24) of a non-empty topological space are called the connected components of the space.
The components of any topological space formula_1 form a partition of formula_1: they are disjoint, non-empty and their union is the whole space.
Every component is a closed subset of the original space. It follows that, in the case where their number is finite, each component is also an open subset. However, if their number is infinite, this might not be the case; for instance, the connected components of the set of the rational numbers are the one-point sets (singletons), which are not open. Proof: Any two distinct rational numbers formula_30 are in different components. Take an irrational number formula_31 and then set formula_32 and formula_33 Then formula_34 is a separation of formula_35 and formula_36. Thus each component is a one-point set.

Let formula_37 be the connected component of formula_17 in a topological space formula_18 and formula_40 be the intersection of all clopen sets containing formula_17 (called quasi-component of formula_17). Then formula_43 where the equality holds if formula_1 is compact Hausdorff or locally connected.

===Disconnected spaces===
A space in which all components are one-point sets is called &#x27;. Related to this property, a space formula_1 is called &#x27; if, for any two distinct elements formula_17 and formula_47 of formula_1, there exist disjoint open sets formula_49 containing formula_17 and formula_51 containing formula_47 such that formula_1 is the union of formula_49 and formula_51. Clearly, any totally separated space is totally disconnected, but the converse does not hold. For example, take two copies of the rational numbers formula_56, and identify them at every point except zero. The resulting space, with the quotient topology, is totally disconnected. However, by considering the two copies of zero, one sees that the space is not totally separated. In fact, it is not even Hausdorff, and the condition of being totally separated is strictly stronger than the condition of being Hausdorff.

==Examples==

* The closed interval formula_57 in the standard subspace topology is connected; although it can, for example, be written as the union of formula_58 and formula_59 the second set is not open in the chosen topology of formula_60
* The union of formula_58 and formula_62 is disconnected; both of these intervals are open in the standard topological space formula_63
* formula_64 is disconnected.
* A convex subset of formula_65 is connected; it is actually simply connected.
* A Euclidean plane excluding the origin, formula_66 is connected, but is not simply connected. The three-dimensional Euclidean space without the origin is connected, and even simply connected. In contrast, the one-dimensional Euclidean space without the origin is not connected.
* A Euclidean plane with a straight line removed is not connected since it consists of two half-planes.
* formula_67, the space of real numbers with the usual topology, is connected.
* The Sorgenfrey line is disconnected. 
* If even a single point is removed from formula_68, the remainder is disconnected. However, if even a countable infinity of points are removed from formula_65, where formula_70 the remainder is connected. If formula_71, then formula_65 remains simply connected after removal of countably many points.
* Any topological vector space, e.g. any Hilbert space or Banach space, over a connected field (such as formula_67 or formula_74), is simply connected.
* Every discrete topological space with at least two elements is disconnected, in fact such a space is totally disconnected. The simplest example is the discrete two-point space.
* On the other hand, a finite set might be connected. For example, the spectrum of a discrete valuation ring consists of two points and is connected. It is an example of a Sierpiński space.
* The Cantor set is totally disconnected; since the set contains uncountably many points, it has uncountably many components.
* If a space formula_1 is homotopy equivalent to a connected space, then formula_1 is itself connected.
* The topologist&#x27;s sine curve is an example of a set that is connected but is neither path connected nor locally connected.
* The general linear group formula_77 (that is, the group of formula_3-by-formula_3 real, invertible matrices) consists of two connected components: the one with matrices of positive determinant and the other of negative determinant. In particular, it is not connected. In contrast, formula_80 is connected. More generally, the set of invertible bounded operators on a complex Hilbert space is connected.
* The spectra of commutative local ring and integral domains are connected. More generally, the following are equivalent
*# The spectrum of a commutative ring formula_81 is connected
*# Every finitely generated projective module over formula_81 has constant rank.
*# formula_81 has no idempotent formula_84 (i.e., formula_81 is not a product of two rings in a nontrivial way).

An example of a space that is not connected is a plane with an infinite line deleted from it. Other examples of disconnected spaces (that is, spaces which are not connected) include the plane with an annulus removed, as well as the union of two disjoint closed disks, where all examples of this paragraph bear the subspace topology induced by two-dimensional Euclidean space.

== Path connectedness ==
A &#x27; is a stronger notion of connectedness, requiring the structure of a path. A path from a point formula_17 to a point formula_47 in a topological space formula_1 is a continuous function formula_89 from the unit interval formula_90 to formula_1 with formula_92 and formula_93. A &#x27; of formula_1 is an equivalence class of formula_1 under the equivalence relation which makes formula_17 equivalent to formula_47 if and only if there is a path from formula_17 to formula_47. The space formula_1 is said to be path-connected (or pathwise connected or formula_101-connected) if there is exactly one path-component. For non-empty spaces, this is equivalent to the statement that there is a path joining any two points in formula_1. Again, many authors exclude the empty space.

Every path-connected space is connected. The converse is not always true: examples of connected spaces that are not path-connected include the extended long line formula_103 and the topologist&#x27;s sine curve.

Subsets of the real line formula_67 are connected if and only if they are path-connected; these subsets are the intervals and rays of formula_67.
Also, open subsets of formula_65 or formula_107 are connected if and only if they are path-connected.
Additionally, connectedness and path-connectedness are the same for finite topological spaces.

== Arc connectedness == 
A space formula_1 is said to be arc-connected or arcwise connected if any two topologically distinguishable points can be joined by an arc, which is an embedding formula_109. An arc-component of formula_1 is a maximal arc-connected subset of formula_1; or equivalently an equivalence class of the equivalence relation of whether two points can be joined by an arc or by a path whose points are topologically indistinguishable.

Every Hausdorff space that is path-connected is also arc-connected; more generally this is true for a formula_112-Hausdorff space, which is a space where each image of a path is closed. An example of a space which is path-connected but not arc-connected is given by the line with two origins; its two copies of formula_113 can be connected by a path but not by an arc.

Intuition for path-connected spaces does not readily transfer to arc-connected spaces. Let formula_1 be the line with two origins. The following are facts whose analogues hold for path-connected spaces, but do not hold for arc-connected spaces:

* Continuous image of arc-connected space may not be arc-connected: for example, a quotient map from an arc-connected space to its quotient with countably many (at least 2) topologically distinguishable points cannot be arc-connected due to too small cardinality.
* Arc-components may not be disjoint. For example, formula_1 has two overlapping arc-components.
* Arc-connected product space may not be a product of arc-connected spaces. For example, formula_116 is arc-connected, but formula_1 is not.
* Arc-components of a product space may not be products of arc-components of the marginal spaces. For example, formula_116 has a single arc-component, but formula_1 has two arc-components.
*If arc-connected subsets have a non-empty intersection, then their union may not be arc-connected. For example, the arc-components of formula_1 intersect, but their union is not arc-connected.

== Local connectedness ==

A topological space is said to be locally connected at a point formula_17 if every neighbourhood of formula_17 contains a connected open neighbourhood. It is locally connected if it has a base of connected sets. It can be shown that a space formula_1 is locally connected if and only if every component of every open set of formula_1 is open.

Similarly, a topological space is said to be if it has a base of path-connected sets.
An open subset of a locally path-connected space is connected if and only if it is path-connected.
This generalizes the earlier statement about formula_65 and formula_107, each of which is locally path-connected. More generally, any topological manifold is locally path-connected.

Locally connected does not imply connected, nor does locally path-connected imply path connected. A simple example of a locally connected (and locally path-connected) space that is not connected (or path-connected) is the union of two separated intervals in formula_67, such as formula_128.

A classical example of a connected space that is not locally connected is the so-called topologist&#x27;s sine curve, defined as formula_129, with the Euclidean topology induced by inclusion in formula_130.

== Set operations ==
The intersection of connected sets is not necessarily connected.

The union of connected sets is not necessarily connected, as can be seen by considering formula_131.

Each ellipse is a connected set, but the union is not connected, since it can be partitioned to two disjoint open sets formula_49 and formula_51.

This means that, if the union formula_1 is disconnected, then the collection formula_135 can be partitioned to two sub-collections, such that the unions of the sub-collections are disjoint and open in formula_1 (see picture). This implies that in several cases, a union of connected sets necessarily connected. In particular:

# If the common intersection of all sets is not empty (formula_137), then obviously they cannot be partitioned to collections with disjoint unions. Hence the union of connected sets with non-empty intersection is connected.
# If the intersection of each pair of sets is not empty (formula_138) then again they cannot be partitioned to collections with disjoint unions, so their union must be connected.
# If the sets can be ordered as a &quot;linked chain&quot;, i.e. indexed by integer indices and formula_139, then again their union must be connected.
# If the sets are pairwise-disjoint and the quotient space formula_140 is connected, then must be connected. Otherwise, if formula_141 is a separation of then formula_142 is a separation of the quotient space (since formula_143 are disjoint and open in the quotient space).

The set difference of connected sets is not necessarily connected. However, if formula_144 and their difference formula_145 is disconnected (and thus can be written as a union of two open sets formula_146 and formula_147), then the union of formula_148 with each such component is connected (i.e. formula_149 is connected for all formula_150).

== Theorems ==
*Main theorem of connectedness: Let formula_1 and formula_148 be topological spaces and let formula_153 be a continuous function. If formula_1 is (path-)connected then the image formula_155 is (path-)connected. This result can be considered a generalization of the intermediate value theorem.
*Every path-connected space is connected.
*In a locally path-connected space, every open connected set is path-connected.
*Every locally path-connected space is locally connected.
*A locally path-connected space is path-connected if and only if it is connected.
*The closure of a connected subset is connected. Furthermore, any subset between a connected subset and its closure is connected.
*The connected components are always closed (but in general not open)
*The connected components of a locally connected space are also open.
*The connected components of a space are disjoint unions of the path-connected components (which in general are neither open nor closed).
*Every quotient of a connected (resp. locally connected, path-connected, locally path-connected) space is connected (resp. locally connected, path-connected, locally path-connected).
*Every product of a family of connected (resp. path-connected) spaces is connected (resp. path-connected).
*Every open subset of a locally connected (resp. locally path-connected) space is locally connected (resp. locally path-connected).
*Every manifold is locally path-connected.
*Arc-wise connected space is path connected, but path-wise connected space may not be arc-wise connected
*Continuous image of arc-wise connected set is arc-wise connected.

==Graphs==
Graphs have path connected subsets, namely those subsets for which every pair of points has a path of edges joining them.
But it is not always possible to find a topology on the set of points which induces the same connected sets. The 5-cycle graph (and any formula_3-cycle with formula_157 odd) is one such example.

As a consequence, a notion of connectedness can be formulated independently of the topology on a space. To wit, there is a category of connective spaces consisting of sets with collections of connected subsets satisfying connectivity axioms; their morphisms are those functions which map connected sets to connected sets . Topological spaces and graphs are special cases of connective spaces; indeed, the finite connective spaces are precisely the finite graphs.

However, every graph can be canonically made into a topological space, by treating vertices as points and edges as copies of the unit interval (see topological graph theory#Graphs as topological spaces). Then one can show that the graph is connected (in the graph theoretical sense) if and only if it is connected as a topological space.

== Stronger forms of connectedness ==
There are stronger forms of connectedness for topological spaces, for instance: 
* If there exist no two disjoint non-empty open sets in a topological space formula_1, formula_1 must be connected, and thus hyperconnected spaces are also connected.
* Since a simply connected space is, by definition, also required to be path connected, any simply connected space is also connected. If the &quot;path connectedness&quot; requirement is dropped from the definition of simple connectivity, a simply connected space does not need to be connected.
*Yet stronger versions of connectivity include the notion of a contractible space. Every contractible space is path connected and thus also connected.

In general, any path connected space must be connected but there exist connected spaces that are not path connected. The deleted comb space furnishes such an example, as does the above-mentioned topologist&#x27;s sine curve.

<text>The cell nucleus (; : nuclei) is a membrane-bound organelle found in eukaryotic cells. Eukaryotic cells usually have a single nucleus, but a few cell types, such as mammalian red blood cells, have no nuclei, and a few others including osteoclasts have many. The main structures making up the nucleus are the nuclear envelope, a double membrane that encloses the entire organelle and isolates its contents from the cellular cytoplasm; and the nuclear matrix, a network within the nucleus that adds mechanical support.

The cell nucleus contains nearly all of the cell&#x27;s genome. Nuclear DNA is often organized into multiple chromosomes – long strands of DNA dotted with various proteins, such as histones, that protect and organize the DNA. The genes within these chromosomes are structured in such a way to promote cell function. The nucleus maintains the integrity of genes and controls the activities of the cell by regulating gene expression.

Because the nuclear envelope is impermeable to large molecules, nuclear pores are required to regulate nuclear transport of molecules across the envelope. The pores cross both nuclear membranes, providing a channel through which larger molecules must be actively transported by carrier proteins while allowing free movement of small molecules and ions. Movement of large molecules such as proteins and RNA through the pores is required for both gene expression and the maintenance of chromosomes. Although the interior of the nucleus does not contain any membrane-bound subcompartments, a number of nuclear bodies exist, made up of unique proteins, RNA molecules, and particular parts of the chromosomes. The best-known of these is the nucleolus, involved in the assembly of ribosomes.

==Chromosomes==

The cell nucleus contains the majority of the cell&#x27;s genetic material in the form of multiple linear DNA molecules organized into structures called chromosomes. Each human cell contains roughly two meters of DNA. During most of the cell cycle these are organized in a DNA-protein complex known as chromatin, and during cell division the chromatin can be seen to form the well-defined chromosomes familiar from a karyotype. A small fraction of the cell&#x27;s genes are located instead in the mitochondria.

There are two types of chromatin. Euchromatin is the less compact DNA form, and contains genes that are frequently expressed by the cell. The other type, heterochromatin, is the more compact form, and contains DNA that is infrequently transcribed. This structure is further categorized into &quot;facultative&quot; heterochromatin, consisting of genes that are organized as heterochromatin only in certain cell types or at certain stages of development, and &quot;constitutive&quot; heterochromatin that consists of chromosome structural components such as telomeres and centromeres. During interphase the chromatin organizes itself into discrete individual patches, called &quot;chromosome territories&quot;. Active genes, which are generally found in the euchromatic region of the chromosome, tend to be located towards the chromosome&#x27;s territory boundary.

Antibodies to certain types of chromatin organization, in particular, nucleosomes, have been associated with a number of autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus. These are known as anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) and have also been observed in concert with multiple sclerosis as part of general immune system dysfunction.

==Nuclear structures and landmarks==

The nucleus contains nearly all of the cell&#x27;s DNA, surrounded by a network of fibrous intermediate filaments called the nuclear matrix, and is enveloped in a double membrane called the nuclear envelope. The nuclear envelope separates the fluid inside the nucleus, called the nucleoplasm, from the rest of the cell. The size of the nucleus is correlated to the size of the cell, and this ratio is reported across a range of cell types and species. In eukaryotes the nucleus in many cells typically occupies 10% of the cell volume. The nucleus is the largest organelle in animal cells. In human cells, the diameter of the nucleus is approximately six micrometres (μm).

===Nuclear envelope and pores===


The nuclear envelope consists of two membranes, an inner and an outer nuclear membrane, perforated by nuclear pores. Together, these membranes serve to separate the cell&#x27;s genetic material from the rest of the cell contents, and allow the nucleus to maintain an environment distinct from the rest of the cell. Despite their close apposition around much of the nucleus, the two membranes differ substantially in shape and contents. The inner membrane surrounds the nuclear content, providing its defining edge. Embedded within the inner membrane, various proteins bind the intermediate filaments that give the nucleus its structure. The outer membrane encloses the inner membrane, and is continuous with the adjacent endoplasmic reticulum membrane. As part of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, the outer nuclear membrane is studded with ribosomes that are actively translating proteins across membrane. The space between the two membranes is called the perinuclear space, and is continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum lumen.

In a mammalian nuclear envelope there are between 3000 and 4000 nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) perforating the envelope. Each NPC contains an eightfold-symmetric ring-shaped structure at a position where the inner and outer membranes fuse. The number of NPCs can vary considerably across cell types; small glial cells only have about a few hundred, with large Purkinje cells having around 20,000. The NPC provides selective transport of molecules between the nucleoplasm and the cytosol. The nuclear pore complex is composed of approximately thirty different proteins known as nucleoporins. The pores are about 60–80 million daltons in molecular weight and consist of around 50 (in yeast) to several hundred proteins (in vertebrates). The pores are 100 nm in total diameter; however, the gap through which molecules freely diffuse is only about 9 nm wide, due to the presence of regulatory systems within the center of the pore. This size selectively allows the passage of small water-soluble molecules while preventing larger molecules, such as nucleic acids and larger proteins, from inappropriately entering or exiting the nucleus. These large molecules must be actively transported into the nucleus instead. Attached to the ring is a structure called the &quot;nuclear basket&quot; that extends into the nucleoplasm, and a series of filamentous extensions that reach into the cytoplasm. Both structures serve to mediate binding to nuclear transport proteins.

Most proteins, ribosomal subunits, and some RNAs are transported through the pore complexes in a process mediated by a family of transport factors known as karyopherins. Those karyopherins that mediate movement into the nucleus are also called importins, whereas those that mediate movement out of the nucleus are called exportins. Most karyopherins interact directly with their cargo, although some use adaptor proteins. Steroid hormones such as cortisol and aldosterone, as well as other small lipid-soluble molecules involved in intercellular signaling, can diffuse through the cell membrane and into the cytoplasm, where they bind nuclear receptor proteins that are trafficked into the nucleus. There they serve as transcription factors when bound to their ligand; in the absence of a ligand, many such receptors function as histone deacetylases that repress gene expression.

===Nuclear lamina===

In animal cells, two networks of intermediate filaments provide the nucleus with mechanical support: The nuclear lamina forms an organized meshwork on the internal face of the envelope, while less organized support is provided on the cytosolic face of the envelope. Both systems provide structural support for the nuclear envelope and anchoring sites for chromosomes and nuclear pores.

The nuclear lamina is composed mostly of lamin proteins. Like all proteins, lamins are synthesized in the cytoplasm and later transported to the nucleus interior, where they are assembled before being incorporated into the existing network of nuclear lamina. Lamins found on the cytosolic face of the membrane, such as emerin and nesprin, bind to the cytoskeleton to provide structural support. Lamins are also found inside the nucleoplasm where they form another regular structure, known as the &quot;nucleoplasmic veil&quot;, that is visible using fluorescence microscopy. The actual function of the veil is not clear, although it is excluded from the nucleolus and is present during interphase. Lamin structures that make up the veil, such as LEM3, bind chromatin and disrupting their structure inhibits transcription of protein-coding genes.

Like the components of other intermediate filaments, the lamin monomer contains an alpha-helical domain used by two monomers to coil around each other, forming a dimer structure called a coiled coil. Two of these dimer structures then join side by side, in an antiparallel arrangement, to form a tetramer called a &quot;protofilament&quot;. Eight of these protofilaments form a lateral arrangement that is twisted to form a ropelike &quot;filament&quot;. These filaments can be assembled or disassembled in a dynamic manner, meaning that changes in the length of the filament depend on the competing rates of filament addition and removal.

Mutations in lamin genes leading to defects in filament assembly cause a group of rare genetic disorders known as &quot;laminopathies&quot;. The most notable laminopathy is the family of diseases known as progeria, which causes the appearance of premature aging in those with the condition. The exact mechanism by which the associated biochemical changes give rise to the aged phenotype is not well understood.

===Nucleolus===


The nucleolus is the largest of the discrete densely stained, membraneless structures known as nuclear bodies found in the nucleus. It forms around tandem repeats of rDNA, DNA coding for ribosomal RNA (rRNA). These regions are called nucleolar organizer regions (NOR). The main roles of the nucleolus are to synthesize rRNA and assemble ribosomes. The structural cohesion of the nucleolus depends on its activity, as ribosomal assembly in the nucleolus results in the transient association of nucleolar components, facilitating further ribosomal assembly, and hence further association. This model is supported by observations that inactivation of rDNA results in intermingling of nucleolar structures.

In the first step of ribosome assembly, a protein called RNA polymerase I transcribes rDNA, which forms a large pre-rRNA precursor. This is cleaved into two large rRNA subunits – 5.8S, and 28S, and a small rRNA subunit 18S. The transcription, post-transcriptional processing, and assembly of rRNA occurs in the nucleolus, aided by small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) molecules, some of which are derived from spliced introns from messenger RNAs encoding genes related to ribosomal function. The assembled ribosomal subunits are the largest structures passed through the nuclear pores.

When observed under the electron microscope, the nucleolus can be seen to consist of three distinguishable regions: the innermost &quot;fibrillar centers&quot; (FCs), surrounded by the &quot;dense fibrillar component&quot; (DFC) (that contains fibrillarin and nucleolin), which in turn is bordered by the &quot;granular component&quot; (GC) (that contains the protein nucleophosmin). Transcription of the rDNA occurs either in the FC or at the FC-DFC boundary, and, therefore, when rDNA transcription in the cell is increased, more FCs are detected. Most of the cleavage and modification of rRNAs occurs in the DFC, while the latter steps involving protein assembly onto the ribosomal subunits occur in the GC.

=== Splicing speckles===

Speckles are subnuclear structures that are enriched in pre-messenger RNA splicing factors and are located in the interchromatin regions of the nucleoplasm of mammalian cells.
At the fluorescence-microscope level they appear as irregular, punctate structures, which vary in size and shape, and when examined by electron microscopy they are seen as clusters of interchromatin granules. Speckles are dynamic structures, and both their protein and RNA-protein components can cycle continuously between speckles and other nuclear locations, including active transcription sites. Speckles can work with p53 as enhancers of gene activity to directly enhance the activity of certain genes. Moreover, speckle-associating and non-associating p53 gene targets are functionally distinct.

Studies on the composition, structure and behaviour of speckles have provided a model for understanding the functional compartmentalization of the nucleus and the organization of the gene-expression machinery splicing snRNPs and other splicing proteins necessary for pre-mRNA processing. Because of a cell&#x27;s changing requirements, the composition and location of these bodies changes according to mRNA transcription and regulation via phosphorylation of specific proteins. The splicing speckles are also known as nuclear speckles (nuclear specks), splicing factor compartments (SF compartments), interchromatin granule clusters (IGCs), and B snurposomes.
B snurposomes are found in the amphibian oocyte nuclei and in &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; embryos. B snurposomes appear alone or attached to the Cajal bodies in the electron micrographs of the amphibian nuclei. While nuclear speckles were originally thought to be storage sites for the splicing factors, a more recent study demonstrated that organizing genes and pre-mRNA substrates near speckles increases the kinetic efficiency of pre-mRNA splicing, ultimately boosting protein levels by modulation of splicing.

===Cajal bodies and gems===

A nucleus typically contains between one and ten compact structures called Cajal bodies or coiled bodies (CB), whose diameter measures between 0.2 μm and 2.0 μm depending on the cell type and species. When seen under an electron microscope, they resemble balls of tangled thread and are dense foci of distribution for the protein coilin. CBs are involved in a number of different roles relating to RNA processing, specifically small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) and small nuclear RNA (snRNA) maturation, and histone mRNA modification.

Similar to Cajal bodies are Gemini of Cajal bodies, or gems, whose name is derived from the Gemini constellation in reference to their close &quot;twin&quot; relationship with CBs. Gems are similar in size and shape to CBs, and in fact are virtually indistinguishable under the microscope. Unlike CBs, gems do not contain small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), but do contain a protein called survival of motor neuron (SMN) whose function relates to snRNP biogenesis. Gems are believed to assist CBs in snRNP biogenesis, though it has also been suggested from microscopy evidence that CBs and gems are different manifestations of the same structure. Later ultrastructural studies have shown gems to be twins of Cajal bodies with the difference being in the coilin component; Cajal bodies are SMN positive and coilin positive, and gems are SMN positive and coilin negative.

===Other nuclear bodies===


Beyond the nuclear bodies first described by Santiago Ramón y Cajal above (e.g., nucleolus, nuclear speckles, Cajal bodies) the nucleus contains a number of other nuclear bodies. These include polymorphic interphase karyosomal association (PIKA), promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) bodies, and paraspeckles. Although little is known about a number of these domains, they are significant in that they show that the nucleoplasm is not a uniform mixture, but rather contains organized functional subdomains.

Other subnuclear structures appear as part of abnormal disease processes. For example, the presence of small intranuclear rods has been reported in some cases of nemaline myopathy. This condition typically results from mutations in actin, and the rods themselves consist of mutant actin as well as other cytoskeletal proteins.

====PIKA and PTF domains====
PIKA domains, or polymorphic interphase karyosomal associations, were first described in microscopy studies in 1991. Their function remains unclear, though they were not thought to be associated with active DNA replication, transcription, or RNA processing. They have been found to often associate with discrete domains defined by dense localization of the transcription factor PTF, which promotes transcription of small nuclear RNA (snRNA).

====PML-nuclear bodies====
Promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML-nuclear bodies) are spherical bodies found scattered throughout the nucleoplasm, measuring around 0.1–1.0 μm. They are known by a number of other names, including nuclear domain 10 (ND10), Kremer bodies, and PML oncogenic domains. PML-nuclear bodies are named after one of their major components, the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML). They are often seen in the nucleus in association with Cajal bodies and cleavage bodies. Pml-/- mice, which are unable to create PML-nuclear bodies, develop normally without obvious ill effects, showing that PML-nuclear bodies are not required for most essential biological processes.

====Paraspeckles====

Discovered by Fox et al. in 2002, paraspeckles are irregularly shaped compartments in the interchromatin space of the nucleus. First documented in HeLa cells, where there are generally 10–30 per nucleus, paraspeckles are now known to also exist in all human primary cells, transformed cell lines, and tissue sections. Their name is derived from their distribution in the nucleus; the &quot;para&quot; is short for parallel and the &quot;speckles&quot; refers to the splicing speckles to which they are always in close proximity.

Paraspeckles sequester nuclear proteins and RNA and thus appear to function as a molecular sponge that is involved in the regulation of gene expression. Furthermore, paraspeckles are dynamic structures that are altered in response to changes in cellular metabolic activity. They are transcription dependent and in the absence of RNA Pol II transcription, the paraspeckle disappears and all of its associated protein components (PSP1, p54nrb, PSP2, CFI(m)68, and PSF) form a crescent shaped perinucleolar cap in the nucleolus. This phenomenon is demonstrated during the cell cycle. In the cell cycle, paraspeckles are present during interphase and during all of mitosis except for telophase. During telophase, when the two daughter nuclei are formed, there is no RNA Pol II transcription so the protein components instead form a perinucleolar cap.

==== Perichromatin fibrils====

Perichromatin fibrils are visible only under electron microscope. They are located next to the transcriptionally active chromatin and are hypothesized to be the sites of active pre-mRNA processing.

====Clastosomes====

Clastosomes are small nuclear bodies (0.2–0.5 μm) described as having a thick ring-shape due to the peripheral capsule around these bodies. This name is derived from the Greek &quot;klastos&quot; (), broken and &quot;soma&quot; (), body. Clastosomes are not typically present in normal cells, making them hard to detect. They form under high proteolytic conditions within the nucleus and degrade once there is a decrease in activity or if cells are treated with proteasome inhibitors. The scarcity of clastosomes in cells indicates that they are not required for proteasome function. Osmotic stress has also been shown to cause the formation of clastosomes. These nuclear bodies contain catalytic and regulatory subunits of the proteasome and its substrates, indicating that clastosomes are sites for degrading proteins.

== Function ==
The nucleus provides a site for genetic transcription that is segregated from the location of translation in the cytoplasm, allowing levels of gene regulation that are not available to prokaryotes. The main function of the cell nucleus is to control gene expression and mediate the replication of DNA during the cell cycle.

===Cell compartmentalization===
The nuclear envelope allows control of the nuclear contents, and separates them from the rest of the cytoplasm where necessary. This is important for controlling processes on either side of the nuclear membrane: In most cases where a cytoplasmic process needs to be restricted, a key participant is removed to the nucleus, where it interacts with transcription factors to downregulate the production of certain enzymes in the pathway. This regulatory mechanism occurs in the case of glycolysis, a cellular pathway for breaking down glucose to produce energy. Hexokinase is an enzyme responsible for the first step of glycolysis, forming glucose-6-phosphate from glucose. At high concentrations of fructose-6-phosphate, a molecule made later from glucose-6-phosphate, a regulator protein removes hexokinase to the nucleus, where it forms a transcriptional repressor complex with nuclear proteins to reduce the expression of genes involved in glycolysis.

In order to control which genes are being transcribed, the cell separates some transcription factor proteins responsible for regulating gene expression from physical access to the DNA until they are activated by other signaling pathways. This prevents even low levels of inappropriate gene expression. For example, in the case of NF-κB-controlled genes, which are involved in most inflammatory responses, transcription is induced in response to a signal pathway such as that initiated by the signaling molecule TNF-α, binds to a cell membrane receptor, resulting in the recruitment of signalling proteins, and eventually activating the transcription factor NF-κB. A nuclear localisation signal on the NF-κB protein allows it to be transported through the nuclear pore and into the nucleus, where it stimulates the transcription of the target genes.

The compartmentalization allows the cell to prevent translation of unspliced mRNA. Eukaryotic mRNA contains introns that must be removed before being translated to produce functional proteins. The splicing is done inside the nucleus before the mRNA can be accessed by ribosomes for translation. Without the nucleus, ribosomes would translate newly transcribed (unprocessed) mRNA, resulting in malformed and nonfunctional proteins.

===Replication===
The main function of the cell nucleus is to control gene expression and mediate the replication of DNA during the cell cycle. It has been found that replication happens in a localised way in the cell nucleus. In the S phase of interphase of the cell cycle; replication takes place. Contrary to the traditional view of moving replication forks along stagnant DNA, a concept of &quot;replication factories&quot; emerged, which means replication forks are concentrated towards some immobilised &#x27;factory&#x27; regions through which the template DNA strands pass like conveyor belts.

===Gene expression===


Gene expression first involves transcription, in which DNA is used as a template to produce RNA. In the case of genes encoding proteins, that RNA produced from this process is messenger RNA (mRNA), which then needs to be translated by ribosomes to form a protein. As ribosomes are located outside the nucleus, mRNA produced needs to be exported.

Since the nucleus is the site of transcription, it also contains a variety of proteins that either directly mediate transcription or are involved in regulating the process. These proteins include helicases, which unwind the double-stranded DNA molecule to facilitate access to it, RNA polymerases, which bind to the DNA promoter to synthesize the growing RNA molecule, topoisomerases, which change the amount of supercoiling in DNA, helping it wind and unwind, as well as a large variety of transcription factors that regulate expression.

===Processing of pre-mRNA===

Newly synthesized mRNA molecules are known as primary transcripts or pre-mRNA. They must undergo post-transcriptional modification in the nucleus before being exported to the cytoplasm; mRNA that appears in the cytoplasm without these modifications is degraded rather than used for protein translation. The three main modifications are 5&#x27; capping, 3&#x27; polyadenylation, and RNA splicing. While in the nucleus, pre-mRNA is associated with a variety of proteins in complexes known as heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein particles (hnRNPs). Addition of the 5&#x27; cap occurs co-transcriptionally and is the first step in post-transcriptional modification. The 3&#x27; poly-adenine tail is only added after transcription is complete.

RNA splicing, carried out by a complex called the spliceosome, is the process by which introns, or regions of DNA that do not code for protein, are removed from the pre-mRNA and the remaining exons connected to re-form a single continuous molecule. This process normally occurs after 5&#x27; capping and 3&#x27; polyadenylation but can begin before synthesis is complete in transcripts with many exons. Many pre-mRNAs can be spliced in multiple ways to produce different mature mRNAs that encode different protein sequences. This process is known as alternative splicing, and allows production of a large variety of proteins from a limited amount of DNA.
==Dynamics and regulation==

===Nuclear transport===


The entry and exit of large molecules from the nucleus is tightly controlled by the nuclear pore complexes. Although small molecules can enter the nucleus without regulation, macromolecules such as RNA and proteins require association karyopherins called importins to enter the nucleus and exportins to exit. &quot;Cargo&quot; proteins that must be translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus contain short amino acid sequences known as nuclear localization signals, which are bound by importins, while those transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm carry nuclear export signals bound by exportins. The ability of importins and exportins to transport their cargo is regulated by GTPases, enzymes that hydrolyze the molecule guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to release energy. The key GTPase in nuclear transport is Ran, which is bound to either GTP or GDP (guanosine diphosphate), depending on whether it is located in the nucleus or the cytoplasm. Whereas importins depend on RanGTP to dissociate from their cargo, exportins require RanGTP in order to bind to their cargo.

Nuclear import depends on the importin binding its cargo in the cytoplasm and carrying it through the nuclear pore into the nucleus. Inside the nucleus, RanGTP acts to separate the cargo from the importin, allowing the importin to exit the nucleus and be reused. Nuclear export is similar, as the exportin binds the cargo inside the nucleus in a process facilitated by RanGTP, exits through the nuclear pore, and separates from its cargo in the cytoplasm.

Specialized export proteins exist for translocation of mature mRNA and tRNA to the cytoplasm after post-transcriptional modification is complete. This quality-control mechanism is important due to these molecules&#x27; central role in protein translation. Mis-expression of a protein due to incomplete excision of exons or mis-incorporation of amino acids could have negative consequences for the cell; thus, incompletely modified RNA that reaches the cytoplasm is degraded rather than used in translation.

===Assembly and disassembly===
During its lifetime, a nucleus may be broken down or destroyed, either in the process of cell division or as a consequence of apoptosis (the process of programmed cell death). During these events, the structural components of the nucleus — the envelope and lamina — can be systematically degraded.
In most cells, the disassembly of the nuclear envelope marks the end of the prophase of mitosis. However, this disassembly of the nucleus is not a universal feature of mitosis and does not occur in all cells. Some unicellular eukaryotes (e.g., yeasts) undergo so-called closed mitosis, in which the nuclear envelope remains intact. In closed mitosis, the daughter chromosomes migrate to opposite poles of the nucleus, which then divides in two. The cells of higher eukaryotes, however, usually undergo open mitosis, which is characterized by breakdown of the nuclear envelope. The daughter chromosomes then migrate to opposite poles of the mitotic spindle, and new nuclei reassemble around them.

At a certain point during the cell cycle in open mitosis, the cell divides to form two cells. In order for this process to be possible, each of the new daughter cells must have a full set of genes, a process requiring replication of the chromosomes as well as segregation of the separate sets. This occurs by the replicated chromosomes, the sister chromatids, attaching to microtubules, which in turn are attached to different centrosomes. The sister chromatids can then be pulled to separate locations in the cell. In many cells, the centrosome is located in the cytoplasm, outside the nucleus; the microtubules would be unable to attach to the chromatids in the presence of the nuclear envelope. Therefore, the early stages in the cell cycle, beginning in prophase and until around prometaphase, the nuclear membrane is dismantled. Likewise, during the same period, the nuclear lamina is also disassembled, a process regulated by phosphorylation of the lamins by protein kinases such as the CDC2 protein kinase. Towards the end of the cell cycle, the nuclear membrane is reformed, and around the same time, the nuclear lamina are reassembled by dephosphorylating the lamins.

However, in dinoflagellates, the nuclear envelope remains intact, the centrosomes are located in the cytoplasm, and the microtubules come in contact with chromosomes, whose centromeric regions are incorporated into the nuclear envelope (the so-called closed mitosis with extranuclear spindle). In many other protists (e.g., ciliates, sporozoans) and fungi, the centrosomes are intranuclear, and their nuclear envelope also does not disassemble during cell division.

Apoptosis is a controlled process in which the cell&#x27;s structural components are destroyed, resulting in death of the cell. Changes associated with apoptosis directly affect the nucleus and its contents, for example, in the condensation of chromatin and the disintegration of the nuclear envelope and lamina. The destruction of the lamin networks is controlled by specialized apoptotic proteases called caspases, which cleave the lamin proteins and, thus, degrade the nucleus&#x27; structural integrity. Lamin cleavage is sometimes used as a laboratory indicator of caspase activity in assays for early apoptotic activity. Cells that express mutant caspase-resistant lamins are deficient in nuclear changes related to apoptosis, suggesting that lamins play a role in initiating the events that lead to apoptotic degradation of the nucleus. Inhibition of lamin assembly itself is an inducer of apoptosis.

The nuclear envelope acts as a barrier that prevents both DNA and RNA viruses from entering the nucleus. Some viruses require access to proteins inside the nucleus in order to replicate and/or assemble. DNA viruses, such as herpesvirus replicate and assemble in the cell nucleus, and exit by budding through the inner nuclear membrane. This process is accompanied by disassembly of the lamina on the nuclear face of the inner membrane.

===Disease-related dynamics===
Initially, it has been suspected that immunoglobulins in general and autoantibodies in particular do not enter the nucleus. Now there is a body of evidence that under pathological conditions (e.g. lupus erythematosus) IgG can enter the nucleus.

==Nuclei per cell==

Most eukaryotic cell types usually have a single nucleus, but some have no nuclei, while others have several. This can result from normal development, as in the maturation of mammalian red blood cells, or from faulty cell division.

===Anucleated cells===

An anucleated cell contains no nucleus and is, therefore, incapable of dividing to produce daughter cells. The best-known anucleated cell is the mammalian red blood cell, or erythrocyte, which also lacks other organelles such as mitochondria, and serves primarily as a transport vessel to ferry oxygen from the lungs to the body&#x27;s tissues. Erythrocytes mature through erythropoiesis in the bone marrow, where they lose their nuclei, organelles, and ribosomes. The nucleus is expelled during the process of differentiation from an erythroblast to a reticulocyte, which is the immediate precursor of the mature erythrocyte. The presence of mutagens may induce the release of some immature &quot;micronucleated&quot; erythrocytes into the bloodstream. Anucleated cells can also arise from flawed cell division in which one daughter lacks a nucleus and the other has two nuclei.

In flowering plants, this condition occurs in sieve tube elements.

===Multinucleated cells===

Multinucleated cells contain multiple nuclei. Most acantharean species of protozoa and some fungi in mycorrhizae have naturally multinucleated cells. Other examples include the intestinal parasites in the genus &quot;Giardia&quot;, which have two nuclei per cell. Ciliates have two kinds of nuclei in a single cell, a somatic macronucleus and a germline micronucleus. In humans, skeletal muscle cells, also called myocytes and syncytium, become multinucleated during development; the resulting arrangement of nuclei near the periphery of the cells allows maximal intracellular space for myofibrils. Other multinucleate cells in the human are osteoclasts a type of bone cell. Multinucleated and binucleated cells can also be abnormal in humans; for example, cells arising from the fusion of monocytes and macrophages, known as giant multinucleated cells, sometimes accompany inflammation and are also implicated in tumor formation.

A number of dinoflagellates are known to have two nuclei. Unlike other multinucleated cells these nuclei contain two distinct lineages of DNA: one from the dinoflagellate and the other from a symbiotic diatom.

==Evolution==
As the major defining characteristic of the eukaryotic cell, the nucleus&#x27;s evolutionary origin has been the subject of much speculation. Four major hypotheses have been proposed to explain the existence of the nucleus, although none have yet earned widespread support.

The first model known as the &quot;syntrophic model&quot; proposes that a symbiotic relationship between the archaea and bacteria created the nucleus-containing eukaryotic cell. (Organisms of the Archaeal and Bacterial domains have no cell nucleus.) It is hypothesized that the symbiosis originated when ancient archaea similar to modern methanogenic archaea, invaded and lived within bacteria similar to modern myxobacteria, eventually forming the early nucleus. This theory is analogous to the accepted theory for the origin of eukaryotic mitochondria and chloroplasts, which are thought to have developed from a similar endosymbiotic relationship between proto-eukaryotes and aerobic bacteria. One possibility is that the nuclear membrane arose as a new membrane system following the origin of mitochondria in an archaebacterial host. The nuclear membrane may have served to protect the genome from damaging reactive oxygen species produced by the protomitochondria. The archaeal origin of the nucleus is supported by observations that archaea and eukarya have similar genes for certain proteins, including histones. Observations that myxobacteria are motile, can form multicellular complexes, and possess kinases and G proteins similar to eukarya, support a bacterial origin for the eukaryotic cell.

A second model proposes that proto-eukaryotic cells evolved from bacteria without an endosymbiotic stage. This model is based on the existence of modern Planctomycetota bacteria that possess a nuclear structure with primitive pores and other compartmentalized membrane structures. A similar proposal states that a eukaryote-like cell, the chronocyte, evolved first and phagocytosed archaea and bacteria to generate the nucleus and the eukaryotic cell.

The most controversial model, known as &quot;viral eukaryogenesis&quot;, posits that the membrane-bound nucleus, along with other eukaryotic features, originated from the infection of a prokaryote by a virus. The suggestion is based on similarities between eukaryotes and viruses such as linear DNA strands, mRNA capping, and tight binding to proteins (analogizing histones to viral envelopes). One version of the proposal suggests that the nucleus evolved in concert with phagocytosis to form an early cellular &quot;predator&quot;. Another variant proposes that eukaryotes originated from early archaea infected by poxviruses, on the basis of observed similarity between the DNA polymerases in modern poxviruses and eukaryotes. It has been suggested that the unresolved question of the evolution of sex could be related to the viral eukaryogenesis hypothesis.

A more recent proposal, the &quot;exomembrane hypothesis&quot;, suggests that the nucleus instead originated from a single ancestral cell that evolved a second exterior cell membrane; the interior membrane enclosing the original cell then became the nuclear membrane and evolved increasingly elaborate pore structures for passage of internally synthesized cellular components such as ribosomal subunits.

==History==
The nucleus was the first organelle to be discovered. What is most likely the oldest preserved drawing dates back to the early microscopist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632–1723). He observed a &quot;lumen&quot;, the nucleus, in the red blood cells of salmon. Unlike mammalian red blood cells, those of other vertebrates still contain nuclei.

The nucleus was also described by Franz Bauer in 1804 and in more detail in 1831 by Scottish botanist Robert Brown in a talk at the Linnean Society of London. Brown was studying orchids under the microscope when he observed an opaque area, which he called the &quot;areola&quot; or &quot;nucleus&quot;, in the cells of the flower&#x27;s outer layer. He did not suggest a potential function.

In 1838, Matthias Schleiden proposed that the nucleus plays a role in generating cells, thus he introduced the name &quot;cytoblast&quot; (&quot;cell builder&quot;). He believed that he had observed new cells assembling around &quot;cytoblasts&quot;. Franz Meyen was a strong opponent of this view, having already described cells multiplying by division and believing that many cells would have no nuclei. The idea that cells can be generated de novo, by the &quot;cytoblast&quot; or otherwise, contradicted work by Robert Remak (1852) and Rudolf Virchow (1855) who decisively propagated the new paradigm that cells are generated solely by cells (&quot;&quot;). The function of the nucleus remained unclear.

Between 1877 and 1878, Oscar Hertwig published several studies on the fertilization of sea urchin eggs, showing that the nucleus of the sperm enters the oocyte and fuses with its nucleus. This was the first time it was suggested that an individual develops from a (single) nucleated cell. This was in contradiction to Ernst Haeckel&#x27;s theory that the complete phylogeny of a species would be repeated during embryonic development, including generation of the first nucleated cell from a &quot;monerula&quot;, a structureless mass of primordial protoplasm (&quot;Urschleim&quot;). Therefore, the necessity of the sperm nucleus for fertilization was discussed for quite some time. However, Hertwig confirmed his observation in other animal groups, including amphibians and molluscs. Eduard Strasburger produced the same results for plants in 1884. This paved the way to assign the nucleus an important role in heredity. In 1873, August Weismann postulated the equivalence of the maternal and paternal germ &quot;cells&quot; for heredity. The function of the nucleus as carrier of genetic information became clear only later, after mitosis was discovered and the Mendelian rules were rediscovered at the beginning of the 20th century; the chromosome theory of heredity was therefore developed.

<text>Christmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, observed primarily on December 25 as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world. A liturgical feast central to Christianity, Christmas preparation begins on the First Sunday of Advent and it is followed by Christmastide, which historically in the West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night. Christmas Day is a public holiday in many countries, is observed religiously by a majority of Christians, as well as celebrated culturally by many non-Christians, and forms an integral part of the annual holiday season.

The traditional Christmas narrative recounted in the New Testament, known as the Nativity of Jesus, says that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in accordance with messianic prophecies. When Joseph and Mary arrived in the city, the inn had no room, and so they were offered a stable where the Christ Child was soon born, with angels proclaiming this news to shepherds, who then spread the word.

There are different hypotheses regarding the date of Jesus&#x27;s birth. In the early fourth century, the church fixed the date as December 25, the date of the winter solstice in the Roman Empire. It is nine months after Annunciation on March 25, also the Roman date of the spring equinox. Most Christians celebrate on December 25 in the Gregorian calendar, which has been adopted almost universally in the civil calendars used in countries throughout the world. However, part of the Eastern Christian Churches celebrate Christmas on December 25 of the older Julian calendar, which currently corresponds to January 7 in the Gregorian calendar. For Christians, celebrating that God came into the world in the form of man to atone for the sins of humanity is more important than knowing Jesus&#x27;s exact birth date.

The customs associated with Christmas in various countries have a mix of , Christian, and secular themes and origins. Popular holiday traditions include gift giving; completing an Advent calendar or Advent wreath; Christmas music and caroling; watching Christmas movies; viewing a Nativity play; an exchange of Christmas cards; attending church services; a special meal; and displaying various Christmas decorations, including Christmas trees, Christmas lights, nativity scenes, poinsettias, garlands, wreaths, mistletoe, and holly. Additionally, several related and often interchangeable figures, known as Santa Claus, Father Christmas, Saint Nicholas, and Christkind, are associated with bringing gifts to children during the Christmas season and have their own body of traditions and lore. Because gift-giving and many other aspects of the Christmas festival involve heightened economic activity, the holiday has become a significant event and a key sales period for retailers and businesses. Over the past few centuries, Christmas has had a steadily growing economic effect in many regions of the world.

The English word &quot;Christmas&quot; is a shortened form of &#x27;Christ&#x27;s Mass&#x27;. The word is recorded as in 1038 and in 1131. (genitive ) is from the Greek (, &#x27;Christ&#x27;), a translation of the Hebrew (, &#x27;Messiah&#x27;), meaning &#x27;anointed&#x27;; and is from the Latin , the celebration of the Eucharist.

The form &quot;Christenmas&quot; was also used during some periods, but is now considered archaic and dialectal. The term derives from Middle English , meaning &#x27;Christian mass&#x27;. &quot;Xmas&quot; is an abbreviation of &quot;Christmas&quot; found particularly in print, based on the initial letter chi (Χ) in the Greek , although some style guides discourage its use. This abbreviation has precedent in Middle English (where is another abbreviation of the Greek word).

=== Other names ===

The holiday has had various other English names throughout its history. The Anglo-Saxons referred to the feast as &quot;midwinter&quot;, or, more rarely, as (from the Latin below). &quot;Nativity&quot;, meaning &#x27;birth&#x27;, is from the Latin . In Old English, (&#x27;Yule&#x27;) referred to the period corresponding to December and January, which was eventually equated with Christian Christmas. &#x27;Noel&#x27; (also &#x27;Nowel&#x27; or &#x27;Nowell&#x27;, as in &quot;The First Nowell&quot;) entered English in the late 14th century and is from the Old French or , itself ultimately from the Latin meaning &#x27;birth (day)&#x27;.

&quot;Koleda&quot; is the traditional Slavic name for Christmas and the period from Christmas to Epiphany or, more generally, to Slavic Christmas-related rituals, some dating to pre-Christian times.

== Nativity ==

The gospels of Luke and Matthew describe Jesus as being born in Bethlehem to the Virgin Mary. In the Gospel of Luke, Joseph and Mary travel from Nazareth to Bethlehem in order to be counted for a census, and Jesus is born there and placed in a manger. Angels proclaim him a savior for all people, and three shepherds come to adore him. In the Gospel of Matthew, by contrast, three magi follow a star to Bethlehem to bring gifts to Jesus, born the king of the Jews. King Herod orders the massacre of all the boys less than two years old in Bethlehem, but the family flees to Egypt and later returns to Nazareth.

== History ==
=== Early and medieval era ===

In the 2nd century, the &quot;earliest church records&quot; indicate that &quot;Christians were remembering and celebrating the birth of the Lord&quot;, an &quot;observance [that] sprang up organically from the authentic devotion of ordinary believers&quot;; although &quot;they did not agree upon a set date&quot;. The earliest document to place Jesus&#x27;s birthday on December 25 is the Chronograph of 354 (also called the Calendar of Filocalus), which also names it as the birthday of Sol Invictus (the &#x27;Invincible Sun&#x27;).

Liturgical historians generally agree that this part of the text was written in Rome in AD 336. This is consistent with the assertion that the date was formally set by Pope Julius I, bishop of Rome from 337 to 352. Though Christmas did not appear on the lists of festivals given by the early Christian writers Irenaeus and Tertullian, the early Church Fathers John Chrysostom, Augustine of Hippo, and Jerome attested to December 25 as the date of Christmas toward the end of the fourth century. December 25 was the traditional date of the winter solstice in the Roman Empire, where most Christians lived, and the Roman festival (birthday of Sol Invictus) had been held on this date since 274 AD.

In the East, the birth of Jesus was celebrated in connection with the Epiphany on January 6. This holiday was not primarily about Christ&#x27;s birth, but rather his baptism. Christmas was promoted in the East as part of the revival of Orthodox Christianity that followed the death of the pro-Arian Emperor Valens at the Battle of Adrianople in 378. The feast was introduced in Constantinople in 379, in Antioch by John Chrysostom towards the end of the fourth century, probably in 388, and in Alexandria in the following century. The Georgian Iadgari demonstrates that Christmas was celebrated in Jerusalem by the sixth century.

In the Early Middle Ages, Christmas Day was overshadowed by Epiphany, which in western Christianity focused on the visit of the magi. However, the medieval calendar was dominated by Christmas-related holidays. The forty days before Christmas became the &quot;forty days of St. Martin&quot; (which began on November 11, the feast of St. Martin of Tours), now known as Advent. In Italy, former Saturnalian traditions were attached to Advent. Around the 12th century, these traditions transferred again to the Twelve Days of Christmas (December 25 – January 5); a time that appears in the liturgical calendars as Christmastide or Twelve Holy Days.

In 567, the Council of Tours put in place the season of Christmastide, proclaiming &quot;the twelve days from Christmas to Epiphany as a sacred and festive season, and established the duty of Advent fasting in preparation for the feast&quot;. This was done in order to solve the &quot;administrative problem for the Roman Empire as it tried to coordinate the solar Julian calendar with the lunar calendars of its provinces in the east&quot;.

The prominence of Christmas Day increased gradually after Charlemagne was crowned Emperor on Christmas Day in 800. King Edmund the Martyr was anointed on Christmas in 855 and King William I of England was crowned on Christmas Day 1066.

By the High Middle Ages, the holiday had become so prominent that chroniclers routinely noted where various magnates celebrated Christmas. King Richard II of England hosted a Christmas feast in 1377 at which 28 oxen and 300 sheep were eaten. The Yule boar was a common feature of medieval Christmas feasts. Caroling also became popular, and was originally performed by a group of dancers who sang. The group was composed of a lead singer and a ring of dancers that provided the chorus. Various writers of the time condemned caroling as lewd, indicating that the unruly traditions of Saturnalia and Yule may have continued in this form. &quot;Misrule&quot;—drunkenness, promiscuity, gambling—was also an important aspect of the festival. In England, gifts were exchanged on New Year&#x27;s Day (a custom at the royal court), and there was special Christmas ale.

Christmas during the Middle Ages was a public festival that incorporated ivy, holly, and other evergreens. Christmas gift-giving during the Middle Ages was usually between people with legal relationships, such as tenant and landlord. The annual indulgence in eating, dancing, singing, sporting, and card playing escalated in England, and by the 17th century the Christmas season featured lavish dinners, elaborate masques, and pageants. In 1607, King James I insisted that a play be acted on Christmas night and that the court indulge in games. It was during the Reformation in 16th–17th-century Europe that many Protestants changed the gift bringer to the Christ Child or &quot;Christkindl&quot;, and the date of giving gifts changed from December 6 to Christmas Eve.

=== 17th and 18th centuries ===
Following the Protestant Reformation, many of the new denominations, including the Anglican Church and Lutheran Church, continued to celebrate Christmas. In 1629, the Anglican poet John Milton penned &quot;On the Morning of Christ&#x27;s Nativity&quot;, a poem that has since been read by many during Christmastide. Donald Heinz, a professor at California State University, Chico, states that Martin Luther &quot;inaugurated a period in which Germany would produce a unique culture of Christmas, much copied in North America&quot;. Among the congregations of the Dutch Reformed Church, Christmas was celebrated as one of the principal evangelical feasts.

However, in 17th century England, some groups such as the Puritans strongly condemned the celebration of Christmas, considering it a Catholic invention and the &quot;trappings of popery&quot; or the &quot;rags of the Beast&quot;. In contrast, the established Anglican Church &quot;pressed for a more elaborate observance of feasts, penitential seasons, and saints&#x27; days. The calendar reform became a major point of tension between the Anglican party and the Puritan party&quot;. The Catholic Church also responded, promoting the festival in a more religiously oriented form. King Charles I of England directed his noblemen and gentry to return to their landed estates in midwinter to keep up their old-style Christmas generosity. Following the Parliamentarian victory over Charles I during the English Civil War, England&#x27;s Puritan rulers banned Christmas in 1647.

Protests followed as pro-Christmas rioting broke out in several cities and for weeks Canterbury was controlled by the rioters, who decorated doorways with holly and shouted royalist slogans. Football, among the sports the Puritans banned on a Sunday, was also used as a rebellious force: when Puritans outlawed Christmas in England in December 1647 the crowd brought out footballs as a symbol of festive misrule. The book, &quot;The Vindication of Christmas&quot; (London, 1652), argued against the Puritans, and makes note of Old English Christmas traditions, dinner, roast apples on the fire, card playing, dances with &quot;plow-boys&quot; and &quot;maidservants&quot;, old Father Christmas and carol singing. During the ban, semi-clandestine religious services marking Christ&#x27;s birth continued to be held, and people sang carols in secret.

It was restored as a legal holiday in England with the Restoration of King Charles II in 1660 when Puritan legislation was declared null and void, with Christmas again freely celebrated in England. Many Calvinist clergymen disapproved of Christmas celebration. As such, in Scotland, the Presbyterian Church of Scotland discouraged the observance of Christmas, and though James VI commanded its celebration in 1618, attendance at church was scant. The Parliament of Scotland officially abolished the observance of Christmas in 1640, claiming that the church had been &quot;purged of all superstitious observation of days&quot;. Whereas in England, Wales and Ireland Christmas Day is a common law holiday, having been a customary holiday since time immemorial, it was not until 1871 that it was designated a bank holiday in Scotland. Following the Restoration of Charles II, &quot;Poor Robin&#x27;s Almanack&quot; contained the lines: &quot;Now thanks to God for Charles return, / Whose absence made old Christmas mourn. / For then we scarcely did it know, / Whether it Christmas were or no&quot;. The diary of James Woodforde, from the latter half of the 18th century, details the observance of Christmas and celebrations associated with the season over a number of years.

As in England, Puritans in Colonial America staunchly opposed the observation of Christmas. The Pilgrims of New England pointedly spent their first December 25 in the New World working normally. Puritans such as Cotton Mather condemned Christmas both because scripture did not mention its observance and because Christmas celebrations of the day often involved boisterous behavior. Many non-Puritans in New England deplored the loss of the holidays enjoyed by the laboring classes in England. Christmas observance was outlawed in Boston in 1659. The ban on Christmas observance was revoked in 1681 by English governor Edmund Andros, but it was not until the mid-19th century that celebrating Christmas became fashionable in the Boston region.

At the same time, Christian residents of Virginia and New York observed the holiday freely. Pennsylvania Dutch settlers, predominantly Moravian settlers of Bethlehem, Nazareth, and Lititz in Pennsylvania and the Wachovia settlements in North Carolina, were enthusiastic celebrators of Christmas. The Moravians in Bethlehem had the first Christmas trees in America as well as the first Nativity Scenes. Christmas fell out of favor in the United States after the American Revolution, when it was considered an English custom.
George Washington attacked Hessian (German) mercenaries on the day after Christmas during the Battle of Trenton on December 26, 1776, Christmas being much more popular in Germany than in America at this time.

With the atheistic Cult of Reason in power during the era of Revolutionary France, Christian Christmas religious services were banned and the three kings cake was renamed the &quot;equality cake&quot; under anticlerical government policies.

=== 19th century ===

In the early 19th century, Christmas festivities and services became widespread with the rise of the Oxford Movement in the Church of England that emphasized the centrality of Christmas in Christianity and charity to the poor, along with Washington Irving, Charles Dickens, and other authors emphasizing family, children, kind-heartedness, gift-giving, and Santa Claus (for Irving), or Father Christmas (for Dickens).

In the early-19th century, writers imagined Tudor-period Christmas as a time of heartfelt celebration. In 1843, Charles Dickens wrote the novel &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, which helped revive the &quot;spirit&quot; of Christmas and seasonal merriment. Its instant popularity played a major role in portraying Christmas as a holiday emphasizing family, goodwill, and compassion.

Dickens sought to construct Christmas as a family-centered festival of generosity, linking &quot;worship and feasting, within a context of social reconciliation&quot;. Superimposing his humanitarian vision of the holiday, in what has been termed &quot;Carol Philosophy&quot;, Dickens influenced many aspects of Christmas that are celebrated today in Western culture, such as family gatherings, seasonal food and drink, dancing, games, and a festive generosity of spirit. A prominent phrase from the tale, &quot;Merry Christmas&quot;, was popularized following the appearance of the story. This coincided with the appearance of the Oxford Movement and the growth of Anglo-Catholicism, which led a revival in traditional rituals and religious observances.

The term &quot;Scrooge&quot; became a synonym for miser, with the phrase &quot;Bah! Humbug!&quot; becoming emblematic of a dismissive attitude of the festive spirit. In 1843, the first commercial Christmas card was produced by Sir Henry Cole. The revival of the Christmas Carol began with William Sandys&#x27;s &quot;Christmas Carols Ancient and Modern&quot; (1833), with the first appearance in print of &quot;The First Noel&quot;, &quot;I Saw Three Ships&quot;, &quot;Hark the Herald Angels Sing&quot; and &quot;God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen&quot;, popularized in Dickens&#x27;s &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;.


In Britain, the Christmas tree was introduced in the early 19th century by the German-born Queen Charlotte. In 1832, the future Queen Victoria wrote about her delight at having a Christmas tree, hung with lights, ornaments, and presents placed round it. After her marriage to her German cousin Prince Albert, by 1841 the custom became more widespread throughout Britain. An image of the British royal family with their Christmas tree at Windsor Castle created a sensation when it was published in the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot; in 1848. A modified version of this image was published in &quot;Godey&#x27;s Lady&#x27;s Book&quot;, Philadelphia in 1850. By the 1870s, putting up a Christmas tree had become common in America.

In America, interest in Christmas had been revived in the 1820s by several short stories by Washington Irving which appear in his &quot;The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent.&quot; and &quot;Old Christmas&quot;. Irving&#x27;s stories depicted harmonious warm-hearted English Christmas festivities he experienced while staying in Aston Hall, Birmingham, England, that had largely been abandoned, and he used the tract &quot;Vindication of Christmas&quot; (1652) of Old English Christmas traditions, that he had transcribed into his journal as a format for his stories.

In 1822, Clement Clarke Moore wrote the poem &quot;A Visit From St. Nicholas&quot; (popularly known by its first line: &quot;Twas the Night Before Christmas&quot;). The poem helped popularize the tradition of exchanging gifts, and seasonal Christmas shopping began to assume economic importance. This also started the cultural conflict between the holiday&#x27;s spiritual significance and its associated commercialism that some see as corrupting the holiday. In her 1850 book &quot;The First Christmas in New England&quot;, Harriet Beecher Stowe includes a character who complains that the true meaning of Christmas was lost in a shopping spree.

While the celebration of Christmas was not yet customary in some regions in the U.S., Henry Wadsworth Longfellow detected &quot;a transition state about Christmas here in New England&quot; in 1856. &quot;The old puritan feeling prevents it from being a cheerful, hearty holiday; though every year makes it more so&quot;. In Reading, Pennsylvania, a newspaper remarked in 1861, &quot;Even our presbyterian friends who have hitherto steadfastly ignored Christmas—threw open their church doors and assembled in force to celebrate the anniversary of the Savior&#x27;s birth.&quot;

The First Congregational Church of Rockford, Illinois, &quot;although of genuine Puritan stock&quot;, was &#x27;preparing for a grand Christmas jubilee&#x27;, a news correspondent reported in 1864. By 1860, fourteen states including several from New England had adopted Christmas as a legal holiday. In 1875, Louis Prang introduced the Christmas card to Americans. He has been called the &quot;father of the American Christmas card&quot;. On June 28, 1870, Christmas was formally declared a United States federal holiday.

=== 20th and 21st centuries ===
During the First World War and particularly (but not exclusively) in 1914, a series of informal truces took place for Christmas between opposing armies. The truces, which were organised spontaneously by fighting men, ranged from promises not to shoot (shouted at a distance in order to ease the pressure of war for the day) to friendly socializing, gift giving and even sport between enemies. These incidents became a well known and semi-mythologised part of popular memory. They have been described as a symbol of common humanity even in the darkest of situations and used to demonstrate to children the ideals of Christmas.

Under the state atheism of the Soviet Union, after its foundation in 1917, Christmas celebrations—along with other Christian holidays—were prohibited in public. During the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, the League of Militant Atheists encouraged school pupils to campaign against Christmas traditions, such as the Christmas tree, as well as other Christian holidays, including Easter; the League established an antireligious holiday to be the 31st of each month as a replacement. At the height of this persecution, in 1929, on Christmas Day, children in Moscow were encouraged to spit on crucifixes as a protest against the holiday. Instead, the importance of the holiday and all its trappings, such as the Christmas tree and gift-giving, was transferred to the New Year. It was not until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 that the persecution ended and Orthodox Christmas became a state holiday again for the first time in Russia after seven decades.
In 1991, the Gubbio Christmas Tree, in Italy, 650 meters high and decorated with over 700 lights, entered the Guinness Book of Records as the tallest Christmas tree in the world. European History Professor Joseph Perry wrote that likewise, in Nazi Germany, &quot;because Nazi ideologues saw organized religion as an enemy of the totalitarian state, propagandists sought to deemphasize—or eliminate altogether—the Christian aspects of the holiday&quot; and that &quot;Propagandists tirelessly promoted numerous Nazified Christmas songs, which replaced Christian themes with the regime&#x27;s racial ideologies&quot;.

As Christmas celebrations began to spread globally even outside traditional Christian cultures, several Muslim-majority countries began to ban the observance of Christmas, claiming it undermined Islam. In 2023, public Christmas celebrations were cancelled in Bethlehem, the city synonymous with the birth of Jesus. Palestinian leaders of various Christian denominations cited the ongoing Israel–Hamas war in their unanimous decision to cancel celebrations.

== Observance and traditions ==

Christmas Day is celebrated as a major festival and public holiday in countries around the world, including many whose populations are mostly non-Christian. In some non-Christian areas, periods of former colonial rule introduced the celebration (e.g. Hong Kong); in others, Christian minorities or foreign cultural influences have led populations to observe the holiday. Countries such as Japan, where Christmas is popular despite there being only a small number of Christians, have adopted many of the cultural aspects of Christmas, such as gift-giving, decorations, and Christmas trees. A similar example is in Turkey, being Muslim-majority and with a small number of Christians, where Christmas trees and decorations tend to line public streets during the festival.

Many popular customs associated with Christmas developed independently of the commemoration of Jesus&#x27;s birth, with some claiming that certain elements are Christianized and have origins in pre-Christian festivals that were celebrated by pagan populations who were later converted to Christianity; other scholars reject these claims and affirm that Christmas customs largely developed in a Christian context. The prevailing atmosphere of Christmas has also continually evolved since the holiday&#x27;s inception, ranging from a sometimes raucous, drunken, carnival-like state in the Middle Ages, to a tamer family-oriented and children-centered theme introduced in a 19th-century transformation. The celebration of Christmas was banned on more than one occasion within certain groups, such as the Puritans and Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses (who do not celebrate birthdays in general), due to concerns that it was too unbiblical. Celtic winter herbs such as mistletoe and ivy, and the custom of kissing under a mistletoe, are common in modern Christmas celebrations in the English-speaking countries.

The pre-Christian Germanic peoples—including the Anglo-Saxons and the Norse—celebrated a winter festival called Yule, held in the late December to early January period, yielding modern English &quot;yule&quot;, today used as a synonym for &quot;Christmas&quot;. In Germanic language-speaking areas, numerous elements of modern Christmas folk custom and iconography may have originated from Yule, including the Yule log, Yule boar, and the Yule goat. Often leading a ghostly procession through the sky (the Wild Hunt), the long-bearded god Odin is referred to as &quot;the Yule one&quot; and &quot;Yule father&quot; in Old Norse texts, while other gods are referred to as &quot;Yule beings&quot;. On the other hand, as there are no reliable existing references to a Christmas log prior to the 16th century, the burning of the Christmas block may have been an early modern invention by Christians unrelated to the pagan practice.

Among countries with a strong Christian tradition, a variety of Christmas celebrations have developed that incorporate regional and local cultures. For example, in eastern Europe Christmas celebrations incorporated pre-Christian traditions such as the Koleda, which shares parallels with the Christmas carol.

=== Church attendance ===

Christmas Day (inclusive of its vigil, Christmas Eve), is a Festival in the Lutheran Churches, a solemnity in the Roman Catholic Church, and a Principal Feast of the Anglican Communion. Other Christian denominations do not rank their feast days but nevertheless place importance on Christmas Eve/Christmas Day, as with other Christian feasts like Easter, Ascension Day, and Pentecost. As such, for Christians, attending a Christmas Eve or Christmas Day church service plays an important part in the recognition of the Christmas season. Christmas, along with Easter, is the period of highest annual church attendance. A 2010 survey by LifeWay Christian Resources found that six in ten Americans attend church services during this time. In the United Kingdom, the Church of England reported an estimated attendance of 2.5million people at Christmas services in 2015.

=== Decorations ===


Nativity scenes are known from 10th-century Rome. They were popularised by Saint Francis of Assisi from 1223, quickly spreading across Europe. Different types of decorations developed across the Christian world, dependent on local tradition and available resources, and can vary from simple representations of the crib to far more elaborate sets – renowned manger scene traditions include the colourful in Poland, which imitate Kraków&#x27;s historical buildings as settings, the elaborate Italian (, and ), or the Provençal crèches in southern France, using hand-painted terracotta figurines called . In certain parts of the world, notably Sicily, living nativity scenes following the tradition of Saint Francis are a popular alternative to static crèches. The first commercially produced decorations appeared in Germany in the 1860s, inspired by paper chains made by children. In countries where a representation of the Nativity scene is very popular, people are encouraged to compete and create the most original or realistic ones. Within some families, the pieces used to make the representation are considered a valuable family heirloom.

The traditional colors of Christmas decorations are red, green, and gold. Red symbolizes the blood of Jesus, which was shed in his crucifixion; green symbolizes eternal life, and in particular the evergreen tree, which does not lose its leaves in the winter; and gold is the first color associated with Christmas, as one of the three gifts of the Magi, symbolizing royalty.

The Christmas tree was first used by German Lutherans in the 16th century, with records indicating that a Christmas tree was placed in the Cathedral of Strassburg in 1539, under the leadership of the Protestant Reformer, Martin Bucer. In the United States, these &quot;German Lutherans brought the decorated Christmas tree with them; the Moravians put lighted candles on those trees&quot;. When decorating the Christmas tree, many individuals place a star at the top of the tree symbolizing the Star of Bethlehem, a fact recorded by &quot;The School Journal&quot; in 1897. Professor David Albert Jones of Oxford University writes that in the 19th century, it became popular for people to also use an angel to top the Christmas tree in order to symbolize the angels mentioned in the accounts of the Nativity of Jesus. Additionally, in the context of a Christian celebration of Christmas, the Christmas tree, being evergreen in colour, is symbolic of Christ, who offers eternal life; the candles or lights on the tree represent the Light of the World—Jesus—born in Bethlehem. Christian services for family use and public worship have been published for the blessing of a Christmas tree, after it has been erected. The Christmas tree is considered by some as Christianisation of pagan tradition and ritual surrounding the Winter Solstice, which included the use of evergreen boughs, and an adaptation of pagan tree worship; according to eighth-century biographer Æddi Stephanus, Saint Boniface (634–709), who was a missionary in Germany, took an ax to an oak tree dedicated to Thor and pointed out a fir tree, which he stated was a more fitting object of reverence because it pointed to heaven and it had a triangular shape, which he said was symbolic of the Trinity. The English language phrase &quot;Christmas tree&quot; is first recorded in 1835 and represents an importation from the German language.

Since the 16th century, the poinsettia, a native plant from Mexico, has been associated with Christmas carrying the Christian symbolism of the Star of Bethlehem; in that country it is known in Spanish as the &quot;Flower of the Holy Night&quot;. Other popular holiday plants include holly, mistletoe, red amaryllis, and Christmas cactus. Along with a Christmas tree, the interior of a home may be decorated with these plants, along with garlands and evergreen foliage. The display of Christmas villages has also become a tradition in many homes this season. The outside of houses may be decorated with lights and sometimes with illuminated sleighs, snowmen, and other Christmas figures. Mistletoe features prominently in European myth and folklore (for example, the legend of Baldr); it is an evergreen parasitic plant that grows on trees, especially apple and poplar, and turns golden when it is dried. It is customary to hang a sprig of mistletoe in the house at Christmas, and anyone standing underneath it may be kissed. 
Other traditional decorations include bells, candles, candy canes, stockings, wreaths, and angels. The wreaths and candles in each window are a more traditional Christmas display. The concentric assortment of leaves, usually from an evergreen, make up Christmas wreaths. Candles in each window are meant to demonstrate that Christians believe that Jesus Christ is the ultimate light of the world.

Christmas lights and banners may be hung along streets, music played by speakers, and Christmas trees placed in prominent places. It is common in many parts of the world for town squares and consumer shopping areas to sponsor and display decorations. Rolls of brightly colored paper with secular or religious Christmas motifs are manufactured to wrap gifts. In some countries, Christmas decorations are traditionally taken down on Twelfth Night.

=== Nativity play ===
The tradition of the Nativity scene comes from Italy. One of the earliest representation in art of the nativity was found in the early Christian Roman catacomb of Saint Valentine. It dates to about AD 380. Another, of similar date, is beneath the pulpit in Sant&#x27;Ambrogio, Milan.

For the Christian celebration of Christmas, the viewing of the Nativity play is one of the oldest Christmastime traditions, with the first reenactment of the Nativity of Jesus taking place in A.D. 1223 in the Italian town of Greccio. In that year, Francis of Assisi assembled a Nativity scene outside of his church in Italy and children sang Christmas carols celebrating the birth of Jesus.

Each year, this grew larger, and people travelled from afar to see Francis&#x27; depiction of the Nativity of Jesus that came to feature drama and music. Nativity plays eventually spread throughout all of Europe, where they remain popular. Christmas Eve and Christmas Day church services often came to feature Nativity plays, as did schools and theatres. In France, Germany, Mexico, and Spain, Nativity plays are often reenacted outdoors in the streets.

=== Music and carols ===


The earliest extant specifically Christmas hymns appear in fourth-century Rome. Latin hymns such as , written by Ambrose, Archbishop of Milan, were austere statements of the theological doctrine of the Incarnation in opposition to Arianism. (&quot;Of the Father&#x27;s love begotten&quot;) by the Spanish poet Prudentius ( 413) is still sung in some churches today. In the 9th and 10th centuries, the Christmas &quot;Sequence&quot; or &quot;Prose&quot; was introduced in North European monasteries, developing under Bernard of Clairvaux into a sequence of rhymed stanzas. In the 12th century the Parisian monk Adam of St. Victor began to derive music from popular songs, introducing something closer to the traditional Christmas carol. Christmas carols in English appear in a 1426 work of John Awdlay who lists twenty five &quot;caroles of Cristemas&quot;, probably sung by groups of &#x27;wassailers&#x27;, who went from house to house.

The songs now known specifically as carols were originally communal folk songs sung during celebrations such as &quot;harvest tide&quot; as well as Christmas. It was only later that carols began to be sung in church. Traditionally, carols have often been based on medieval chord patterns, and it is this that gives them their uniquely characteristic musical sound. Some carols like &quot;Personent hodie&quot;, &quot;Good King Wenceslas&quot;, and can be traced directly back to the Middle Ages. They are among the oldest musical compositions still regularly sung. (O Come all ye faithful) appeared in its current form in the mid-18th century.

The singing of carols increased in popularity after the Protestant Reformation in the Lutheran areas of Europe, as the Reformer Martin Luther wrote carols and encouraged their use in worship, in addition to spearheading the practice of caroling outside the Mass. The 18th-century English reformer Charles Wesley, a founder of Methodism, understood the importance of music to Christian worship. In addition to setting many psalms to melodies, he wrote texts for at least three Christmas carols. The best known was originally entitled &quot;Hark! How All the Welkin Rings&quot;, later renamed &quot;Hark! The Herald Angels Sing&quot;.

Christmas seasonal songs of a secular nature emerged in the late 18th century. The Welsh melody for &quot;Deck the Halls&quot; dates from 1794, with the lyrics added by Scottish musician Thomas Oliphant in 1862, and the American &quot;Jingle Bells&quot; was copyrighted in 1857. Other popular carols include &quot;The First Noel&quot;, &quot;God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen&quot;, &quot;The Holly and the Ivy&quot;, &quot;I Saw Three Ships&quot;, &quot;In the Bleak Midwinter&quot;, &quot;Joy to the World&quot;, &quot;Once in Royal David&#x27;s City&quot; and &quot;While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks&quot;. In the 19th and 20th centuries, African American spirituals and songs about Christmas, based in their tradition of spirituals, became more widely known. An increasing number of seasonal holiday songs were commercially produced in the 20th century, including jazz and blues variations. In addition, there was a revival of interest in early music, from groups singing folk music, such as The Revels, to performers of early medieval and classical music.

One of the most ubiquitous festive songs is &quot;We Wish You a Merry Christmas&quot;, which originates from the West Country of England in the 1930s. Radio has covered Christmas music from variety shows from the 1940s and 1950s, as well as modern-day stations that exclusively play Christmas music from late November through December 25. Hollywood movies have featured new Christmas music, such as &quot;White Christmas&quot; in &quot;Holiday Inn&quot; and &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot;. Traditional carols have also been included in Hollywood films, such as &quot;Hark! The Herald Angels Sing&quot; in &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; (1946), and &quot;Silent Night&quot; in &quot;A Christmas Story&quot;.

=== Traditional cuisine ===


A special Christmas family meal is traditionally an important part of the holiday&#x27;s celebration, and the food served varies greatly from country to country. Some regions have special meals for Christmas Eve, such as Sicily, where 12 kinds of fish are served. In the United Kingdom and countries influenced by its traditions, a standard Christmas meal includes turkey, goose or other large bird, gravy, potatoes, vegetables, sometimes bread, and cider. Special desserts are also prepared, such as Christmas pudding, mince pies, fruit cake and Yule log cake.

In Poland and Scandinavia, fish is often used for the traditional main course, but richer meat such as lamb is increasingly served. In Sweden, it is common with a special variety of smörgåsbord, where ham, meatballs, and herring play a prominent role. In Germany, France, and Austria, goose and pork are favored. Beef, ham, and chicken in various recipes are popular worldwide. The Maltese traditionally serve &quot;Imbuljuta tal-Qastan&quot;, a chocolate and chestnuts beverage, after Midnight Mass and throughout the Christmas season. Slovenes prepare the traditional Christmas bread potica, &quot;bûche de Noël&quot; in France, &quot;panettone&quot; in Italy, and elaborate tarts and cakes. &quot;Panettone&quot;, an Italian type of sweet bread and fruitcake, originally from Milan, Italy, usually prepared and enjoyed for Christmas and New Year in Western, Southern, and Southeastern Europe, as well as in South America, Eritrea, Australia and North America.

The eating of sweets and chocolates has become popular worldwide, and sweeter Christmas delicacies include the German &quot;stollen&quot;, marzipan cake or candy, and Jamaican rum fruit cake. As one of the few fruits traditionally available to northern countries in winter, oranges have been long associated with special Christmas foods. Eggnog is a sweetened dairy-based beverage traditionally made with milk, cream, sugar, and whipped eggs (which gives it a frothy texture). Spirits such as brandy, rum, or bourbon are often added. The finished serving is often garnished with a sprinkling of ground cinnamon or nutmeg.

=== Cards ===
Christmas cards are illustrated messages of greeting exchanged between friends and family members during the weeks preceding Christmas Day. The traditional greeting reads &quot;wishing you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year&quot;, much like that of the first commercial Christmas card, produced by Sir Henry Cole in London in 1843. The custom of sending them has become popular among a wide cross-section of people with the emergence of the modern trend towards exchanging E-cards.

Christmas cards are purchased in considerable quantities and feature artwork, commercially designed and relevant to the season. The content of the design might relate directly to the Christmas narrative, with depictions of the Nativity of Jesus, or Christian symbols such as the Star of Bethlehem, or a white dove, which can represent both the Holy Spirit and Peace on Earth. Other Christmas cards are more secular and can depict Christmas traditions, figures such as Santa Claus, objects directly associated with Christmas such as candles, holly, and baubles, or a variety of images associated with the season, such as Christmastide activities, snow scenes, and the wildlife of the northern winter.

=== Commemorative stamps ===
A number of nations have issued commemorative stamps at Christmastide. Postal customers will often use these stamps to mail Christmas cards, and they are popular with philatelists. These stamps are regular postage stamps, unlike Christmas seals, and are valid for postage year-round. They usually go on sale sometime between early October and early December and are printed in considerable quantities.

===Christmas seals===

Christmas seals were first issued to raise funding to fight and bring awareness to tuberculosis. The first Christmas seal was issued in Denmark in 1904, and since then other countries have issued their own Christmas seals.

=== Gift giving ===

The exchanging of gifts is one of the core aspects of the modern Christmas celebration, making it the most profitable time of year for retailers and businesses throughout the world. On Christmas, people exchange gifts based on the Christian tradition associated with Saint Nicholas, and the gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh which were given to the baby Jesus by the Magi. The practice of gift giving in the Roman celebration of Saturnalia may have influenced Christian customs, but on the other hand the Christian &quot;core dogma of the Incarnation, however, solidly established the giving and receiving of gifts as the structural principle of that recurrent yet unique event&quot;, because it was the Biblical Magi, &quot;together with all their fellow men, who received the gift of God through man&#x27;s renewed participation in the divine life&quot;. However, Thomas J. Talley holds that the Roman Emperor Aurelian placed the alternate festival on December 25 in order to compete with the growing rate of the Christian Church, which had already been celebrating Christmas on that date first.

==== Gift-bearing figures ====
A number of figures are associated with Christmas and the seasonal giving of gifts. Among these are Father Christmas, also known as Santa Claus (derived from the Dutch for Saint Nicholas), Père Noël, and the Weihnachtsmann; Saint Nicholas or Sinterklaas; the Christkind; Kris Kringle; Joulupukki; tomte/nisse; Babbo Natale; Saint Basil; and Ded Moroz. The Scandinavian tomte (also called nisse) is sometimes depicted as a gnome instead of Santa Claus.

The best known of these figures today is red-dressed Santa Claus, of diverse origins. The name &#x27;Santa Claus&#x27; can be traced back to the Dutch (&#x27;Saint Nicholas&#x27;). Nicholas was a 4th-century Greek bishop of Myra, a city in the Roman province of Lycia, whose ruins are from modern Demre in southwest Turkey. Among other saintly attributes, he was noted for the care of children, generosity, and the giving of gifts. His feast day, December 6, came to be celebrated in many countries with the giving of gifts.

Saint Nicholas traditionally appeared in bishop&#x27;s attire, accompanied by helpers, inquiring about the behaviour of children during the past year before deciding whether they deserved a gift or not. By the 13th century, Saint Nicholas was well known in the Netherlands, and the practice of gift-giving in his name spread to other parts of central and southern Europe. At the Reformation in 16th- and 17th-century Europe, many Protestants changed the gift bringer to the Christ Child or , corrupted in English to &#x27;Kris Kringle&#x27;, and the date of giving gifts changed from December 6 to Christmas Eve.

The modern popular image of Santa Claus, however, was created in the United States, and in particular in New York. The transformation was accomplished with the aid of notable contributors including Washington Irving and the German-American cartoonist Thomas Nast (1840–1902). Following the American Revolutionary War, some of the inhabitants of New York City sought out symbols of the city&#x27;s non-English past. New York had originally been established as the Dutch colonial town of New Amsterdam and the Dutch Sinterklaas tradition was reinvented as Saint Nicholas.

Current tradition in several Latin American countries (such as Venezuela and Colombia) holds that while Santa makes the toys, he then gives them to the Baby Jesus, who is the one who actually delivers them to the children&#x27;s homes, a reconciliation between traditional religious beliefs and the iconography of Santa Claus imported from the United States.
In Italy&#x27;s South Tyrol, Austria, the Czech Republic, Southern Germany, Hungary, Liechtenstein, Slovakia, and Switzerland, the Christkind (Ježíšek in Czech, Jézuska in Hungarian and Ježiško in Slovak) brings the presents. Greek children get their presents from Saint Basil on New Year&#x27;s Eve, the eve of that saint&#x27;s liturgical feast. The German St. Nikolaus is not identical with the Weihnachtsmann (who is the German version of Santa Claus / Father Christmas). St. Nikolaus wears a bishop&#x27;s dress and still brings small gifts (usually candies, nuts, and fruits) on December 6 and is accompanied by Knecht Ruprecht. Although many parents around the world routinely teach their children about Santa Claus and other gift bringers, some have come to reject this practice, considering it deceptive.

Multiple gift-giver figures exist in Poland, varying between regions and individual families. St Nicholas () dominates Central and North-East areas, the Starman () is most common in Greater Poland, Baby Jesus () is unique to Upper Silesia, with the Little Star () and the Little Angel () being common in the South and the South-East. Grandfather Frost () is less commonly accepted in some areas of Eastern Poland. It is worth noting that across all of Poland, St Nicholas is the gift giver on Saint Nicholas Day on December 6.

===Sport===
Christmas during the Middle Ages was a public festival with annual indulgences included the sporting. When Puritans outlawed Christmas in England in December 1647 the crowd brought out footballs as a symbol of festive misrule. The Orkney Christmas Day Ba&#x27; tradition continues. In the former top tier of English football, home and away Christmas Day and Boxing Day double headers were often played guaranteeing football clubs large crowds by allowing many working people their only chance to watch a game. Champions Preston North End faced Aston Villa on Christmas Day 1889 and the last December 25 fixture was in 1965 in England, Blackpool beating Blackburn Rovers 4–2. One of the most memorable images of the Christmas truce during World War I was the games of football played between the opposing sides on Christmas Day 1914.

More recently, in the United States, both NFL and NBA have held fixtures on Christmas Day.

===Christmas in China===
During the late Qing dynasty the &quot;Shanghai News&quot; referred to Christmas by a variety of terms. In 1872 it initially called Christmas &quot;Jesus&#x27; birthday&quot; (), but from 1873 to 1881 it used terms such as &quot;Western countries&#x27; Winter Solstice&quot; () and &quot;Western peoples&#x27; Winter Solstice&quot; (), before finally settling on &quot;Foreign Winter Solstice&quot; () from 1882 onwards. This term was gradually replaced by the now standard term &quot;Festival of the birth of the Holy One&quot; () during the early years of the twentieth century.

===Scandinavia and the Nordics===

In Scandinavia—Denmark, Norway, Sweden—where Lutheranism is dominant, Christmas (&quot;jul&quot;) is celebrated on 24 December.In Sweden, it is traditional for companies to host a Christmas buffet lunch (julbord or jullunch) for their employees a week before Christmas. To prevent food poisoning during the holiday season, Swedish newspapers annually publish reports and laboratory tests warning the public to avoid leaving cold cuts, mayonnaise, and other perishable foods at room temperature to prevent spoilage. Christmas in Sweden is a time to indulge in festive meals, with roasted ham being the centerpiece of the feast. However, the exact day for enjoying this treat varies across regions, with each area having its own traditions. Another well-established custom in Sweden is tuning in to watch a special Disney television program at precisely 3 p.m. on December 24.

In Norway, the Christmas feast is held on December 24, with each region offering its own special dishes for Christmas dinner. After the meal, &quot;Julenissen&quot; (where &quot;jule&quot; means Christmas and &quot;nissen&quot; refers to a mythical elf in Norwegian folklore) brings gifts to well-behaved children. Following a quiet family gathering on December 25, another grand celebration takes place on Boxing Day, December 26, where children go door-to-door visiting neighbors and receiving treats.

==Choice of date==
=== Theories ===
There are several theories as to why December 25 was chosen as the date for Christmas. However, theology professor Susan Roll notes that &quot;no liturgical historian [...] goes so far as to deny that it has any sort of relation with the sun, the winter solstice and the popularity of solar worship in the later Roman Empire&quot;. The early Church linked Jesus Christ to the Sun and referred to him as the &#x27;Sun of Righteousness&#x27; () prophesied by Malachi. In the early fifth century, Augustine of Hippo and Maximus of Turin preached that it was fitting to celebrate Christ&#x27;s birth at the winter solstice, because it marked the point when the hours of daylight begin to grow.

The &#x27;history of religions&#x27; or &#x27;substitution&#x27; theory suggests that the Church chose December 25 as Christ&#x27;s birthday () to appropriate the Roman winter solstice festival (birthday of , the &#x27;Invincible Sun&#x27;), held on this date since 274 AD; before the earliest evidence of Christmas on that date. Gary Forsythe, Professor of Ancient History, says that the followed &quot;the seven-day period of the (December 17–23), Rome&#x27;s most joyous holiday season since Republican times, characterized by parties, banquets, and exchanges of gifts&quot;. Roll says that &quot;the specific nature of the relation&quot; between Christmas and the &quot;Natalis Solis Invicti&quot; has not yet been &quot;conclusively proven from extant texts&quot;.

The &#x27;calculation theory&#x27; suggests that December 25 was calculated as nine months after a date chosen for Jesus&#x27;s conception: 25 March, the Roman date of the spring equinox, which later became the Feast of the Annunciation.

=== Date according to Julian calendar ===
Some jurisdictions of the Eastern Orthodox Church, including those of Russia, Georgia, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Jerusalem, mark feasts using the older Julian calendar. , there is a difference of 13 days between the Julian calendar and the modern Gregorian calendar, which is used internationally for most secular purposes. As a result, December 25 on the Julian calendar currently corresponds to January 7 on the calendar used by most governments and people in everyday life. Therefore, the aforementioned Orthodox Christians mark December 25 (and thus Christmas) on the day that is internationally considered to be January 7.

However, following the Council of Constantinople in 1923, other Orthodox Christians, such as those belonging to the jurisdictions of Constantinople, Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, Antioch, Alexandria, Albania, Cyprus, Finland, and the Orthodox Church in America, among others, began using the Revised Julian calendar, which at present corresponds exactly to the Gregorian calendar. Therefore, these Orthodox Christians mark December 25 (and thus Christmas) on the same day that is internationally considered to be December 25.

A further complication is added by the fact that the Armenian Apostolic Church continues the original ancient Eastern Christian practice of celebrating the birth of Christ not as a separate holiday, but on the same day as the celebration of his baptism (Theophany), which is on January 6. This is a public holiday in Armenia, and it is held on the same day that is internationally considered to be January 6, because since 1923 the Armenian Church in Armenia has used the Gregorian calendar.

However, there is also a small Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem, which maintains the traditional Armenian custom of celebrating the birth of Christ on the same day as Theophany (January 6), but uses the Julian calendar for the determination of that date. As a result, this church celebrates &quot;Christmas&quot; (more properly called Theophany) on the day that is considered January 19 on the Gregorian calendar in use by the majority of the world.

Following the 2022 invasion of its territory by Russia, Ukraine officially moved its Christmas date from January 7 to December 25, to distance itself from the Russian Orthodox Church that had supported Russia&#x27;s invasion. This followed the Orthodox Church of Ukraine formally adopting the Revised Julian calendar for fixed feasts and solemnities.

=== Table of dates ===
There are four different dates used by different Christian groups to mark the birth of Christ, given in the table below.

== Economy ==
Christmas is typically a peak selling season for retailers in many nations around the world; sales increase dramatically during this time as people purchase gifts, decorations, and supplies to celebrate. In the United States, the &quot;Christmas shopping season&quot; starts as early as October. In Canada, merchants begin advertising campaigns before Halloween (October 31) and step up their marketing following Remembrance Day on November 11. In the UK and Ireland, the Christmas shopping season starts from mid-November, around the time when high street Christmas lights are turned on. A concept devised by retail entrepreneur David Lewis, the first Christmas grotto opened in Lewis&#x27;s department store in Liverpool, England in 1879. In the United States, it has been calculated that a quarter of all personal spending takes place during the Christmas/holiday shopping season. Figures from the US Census Bureau reveal that expenditure in department stores nationwide rose from $20.8billion in November 2004 to $31.9billion in December 2004, an increase of 54 percent. In other sectors, the pre-Christmas increase in spending was even greater, there being a November–December buying surge of 100 percent in bookstores and 170 percent in jewelry stores. In the same year employment in American retail stores rose from 1.6million to 1.8million in the two months leading up to Christmas. Industries completely dependent on Christmas include Christmas cards, of which 1.9billion are sent in the United States each year, and live Christmas trees, of which 20.8million were cut in the US in 2002. In the UK in 2010, up to £8billion was expected to be spent online at Christmas, approximately a quarter of total retail festive sales.

In most Western nations, Christmas Day is the least active day of the year for business and commerce; almost all retail, commercial and institutional businesses are closed, and almost all industries cease activity (more than any other day of the year), whether laws require such or not. In England and Wales, the Christmas Day (Trading) Act 2004 prevents all large shops from trading on Christmas Day. Similar legislation was approved in Scotland in 2007. Film studios release many high-budget movies during the holiday season, including Christmas films, fantasy movies or high-tone dramas with high production values to hopes of maximizing the chance of nominations for the Academy Awards.

One economist&#x27;s analysis calculates that despite increased overall spending, Christmas is a deadweight loss under orthodox microeconomic theory, because of the effect of gift-giving. This loss is calculated as the difference between what the gift giver spent on the item and what the gift receiver would have paid for the item. It is estimated that in 2001, Christmas resulted in a $4billion deadweight loss in the US alone. Because of complicating factors, this analysis is sometimes used to discuss possible flaws in current microeconomic theory. Other deadweight losses include the effects of Christmas on the environment and the fact that material gifts are often perceived as white elephants, imposing cost for upkeep and storage and contributing to clutter.

== Controversies ==


Christmas has been the subject of controversy and attacks from various sources, both Christian and non-Christian. Historically, it was prohibited by Puritans during their ascendency in the Commonwealth of England (1647–1660) and in Colonial New England where the Puritans outlawed the celebration of Christmas in 1659 on the grounds that Christmas was not mentioned in Scripture and therefore violated the Reformed regulative principle of worship. The Parliament of Scotland, which was dominated by Presbyterians, passed a series of acts outlawing the observance of Christmas between 1637 and 1690; Christmas Day did not become a public holiday in Scotland until 1871. Today, some conservative Reformed denominations such as the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland and the Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America likewise reject the celebration of Christmas based on the regulative principle and what they see as its non-Scriptural origin. Celebrating Christmas is banned in the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, as the Governing Body believes that Christmas is originally pagan and again that it is without basis in Scripture. Christmas celebrations have also been prohibited by atheist states such as the Soviet Union and more recently majority Muslim states such as Somalia, Tajikistan and Brunei.

Some Christians and organizations such as Pat Robertson&#x27;s American Center for Law and Justice cite alleged attacks on Christmas (dubbing them a &quot;war on Christmas&quot;). Such groups claim that any specific mention of the term &quot;Christmas&quot; or its religious aspects is being increasingly censored, avoided, or discouraged by a number of advertisers, retailers, government (prominently schools), and other public and private organizations. One controversy is the occurrence of Christmas trees being renamed Holiday trees. In the U.S. there has been a tendency to replace the greeting &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; with &quot;Happy Holidays&quot;, which is considered inclusive at the time of the Jewish celebration of Hanukkah. In the U.S., and Canada, where the use of the term &quot;Holidays&quot; is most prevalent, opponents have denounced its usage and avoidance of using the term &quot;Christmas&quot; as being politically correct. In 1984, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Lynch v. Donnelly&quot; that a Christmas display (which included a Nativity scene) owned and displayed by the city of Pawtucket, Rhode Island, did not violate the First Amendment. American Muslim scholar Abdul Malik Mujahid has said that Muslims must treat Christmas with respect, even if they disagree with it.

The government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China officially espouses state atheism, and has conducted antireligious campaigns to this end. In December 2018, officials raided Christian churches prior to Christmastide and coerced them to close; Christmas trees and Santa Clauses were also forcibly removed.

<doc id="6239" wikidata="Q515173" url="?curid=6239" title="Contraction mapping">
<text>In mathematics, a contraction mapping, or contraction or contractor, on a metric space (&quot;M&quot;, &quot;d&quot;) is a function &quot;f&quot; from &quot;M&quot; to itself, with the property that there is some real number formula_1 such that for all &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; in &quot;M&quot;,

:formula_2
The smallest such value of &quot;k&quot; is called the Lipschitz constant of &quot;f&quot;. Contractive maps are sometimes called Lipschitzian maps. If the above condition is instead satisfied for
&quot;k&quot; ≤ 1, then the mapping is said to be a non-expansive map.

More generally, the idea of a contractive mapping can be defined for maps between metric spaces. Thus, if (&quot;M&quot;, &quot;d&quot;) and (&quot;N&quot;, &quot;d&quot;&#x27;) are two metric spaces, then formula_3 is a contractive mapping if there is a constant formula_1 such that
:formula_5
for all &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; in &quot;M&quot;.

Every contraction mapping is Lipschitz continuous and hence uniformly continuous (for a Lipschitz continuous function, the constant &quot;k&quot; is no longer necessarily less than 1).

A contraction mapping has at most one fixed point. Moreover, the Banach fixed-point theorem states that every contraction mapping on a non-empty complete metric space has a unique fixed point, and that for any &quot;x&quot; in &quot;M&quot; the iterated function sequence &quot;x&quot;, &quot;f&quot; (&quot;x&quot;), &quot;f&quot; (&quot;f&quot; (&quot;x&quot;)), &quot;f&quot; (&quot;f&quot; (&quot;f&quot; (&quot;x&quot;))), ... converges to the fixed point. This concept is very useful for iterated function systems where contraction mappings are often used. Banach&#x27;s fixed-point theorem is also applied in proving the existence of solutions of ordinary differential equations, and is used in one proof of the inverse function theorem.

Contraction mappings play an important role in dynamic programming problems.

==Firmly non-expansive mapping==
A non-expansive mapping with formula_6 can be generalized to a firmly non-expansive mapping in a Hilbert space formula_7 if the following holds for all &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; in formula_7:
:formula_9
where
:formula_10.

This is a special case of formula_11 averaged nonexpansive operators with formula_12. A firmly non-expansive mapping is always non-expansive, via the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality.

The class of firmly non-expansive maps is closed under convex combinations, but not compositions. This class includes proximal mappings of proper, convex, lower-semicontinuous functions, hence it also includes orthogonal projections onto non-empty closed convex sets. The class of firmly nonexpansive operators is equal to the set of resolvents of maximally monotone operators. Surprisingly, while iterating non-expansive maps has no guarantee to find a fixed point (e.g. multiplication by -1), firm non-expansiveness is sufficient to guarantee global convergence to a fixed point, provided a fixed point exists. More precisely, if formula_13, then for any initial point formula_14, iterating

formula_15

yields convergence to a fixed point formula_16. This convergence might be weak in an infinite-dimensional setting.

==Subcontraction map==
A subcontraction map or subcontractor is a map &quot;f&quot; on a metric space (&quot;M&quot;, &quot;d&quot;) such that

:formula_17
:formula_18

If the image of a subcontractor &quot;f&quot; is compact, then &quot;f&quot; has a fixed point.

==Locally convex spaces==
In a locally convex space (&quot;E&quot;, &quot;P&quot;) with topology given by a set &quot;P&quot; of seminorms, one can define for any &quot;p&quot; ∈ &quot;P&quot; a &quot;p&quot;-contraction as a map &quot;f&quot; such that there is some &quot;k&quot;&quot;p&quot; &lt; 1 such that ≤ . If &quot;f&quot; is a &quot;p&quot;-contraction for all &quot;p&quot; ∈ &quot;P&quot; and (&quot;E&quot;, &quot;P&quot;) is sequentially complete, then &quot;f&quot; has a fixed point, given as limit of any sequence &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1 = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;), and if (&quot;E&quot;, &quot;P&quot;) is Hausdorff, then the fixed point is unique.

<text>A covalent bond is a chemical bond that involves the sharing of electrons to form electron pairs between atoms. These electron pairs are known as shared pairs or bonding pairs. The stable balance of attractive and repulsive forces between atoms, when they share electrons, is known as covalent bonding. For many molecules, the sharing of electrons allows each atom to attain the equivalent of a full valence shell, corresponding to a stable electronic configuration. In organic chemistry, covalent bonding is much more common than ionic bonding.

Covalent bonding also includes many kinds of interactions, including σ-bonding, π-bonding, metal-to-metal bonding, agostic interactions, bent bonds, three-center two-electron bonds and three-center four-electron bonds. The term &quot;covalent bond&quot; dates from 1939. The prefix &quot;co-&quot; means &quot;jointly, associated in action, partnered to a lesser degree, &quot; etc.; thus a &quot;co-valent bond&quot;, in essence, means that the atoms share &quot;valence&quot;, such as is discussed in valence bond theory.

In the molecule , the hydrogen atoms share the two electrons via covalent bonding. Covalency is greatest between atoms of similar electronegativities. Thus, covalent bonding does not necessarily require that the two atoms be of the same elements, only that they be of comparable electronegativity. Covalent bonding that entails the sharing of electrons over more than two atoms is said to be delocalized.

== History ==
The term &quot;covalence&quot; in regard to bonding was first used in 1919 by Irving Langmuir in a &quot;Journal of the American Chemical Society&quot; article entitled &quot;The Arrangement of Electrons in Atoms and Molecules&quot;. Langmuir wrote that &quot;we shall denote by the term &quot;covalence&quot; the number of pairs of electrons that a given atom shares with its neighbors.&quot;

The idea of covalent bonding can be traced several years before 1919 to Gilbert N. Lewis, who in 1916 described the sharing of electron pairs between atoms (and in 1926 he also coined the term &quot;photon&quot; for the smallest unit of radiant energy). He introduced the &quot;Lewis notation&quot; or &quot;electron dot notation&quot; or &quot;Lewis dot structure&quot;, in which valence electrons (those in the outer shell) are represented as dots around the atomic symbols. Pairs of electrons located between atoms represent covalent bonds. Multiple pairs represent multiple bonds, such as double bonds and triple bonds. An alternative form of representation, not shown here, has bond-forming electron pairs represented as solid lines.

Lewis proposed that an atom forms enough covalent bonds to form a full (or closed) outer electron shell. In the diagram of methane shown here, the carbon atom has a valence of four and is, therefore, surrounded by eight electrons (the octet rule), four from the carbon itself and four from the hydrogens bonded to it. Each hydrogen has a valence of one and is surrounded by two electrons (a duet rule) – its own one electron plus one from the carbon. The numbers of electrons correspond to full shells in the quantum theory of the atom; the outer shell of a carbon atom is the &quot;n&quot; = 2 shell, which can hold eight electrons, whereas the outer (and only) shell of a hydrogen atom is the &quot;n&quot; = 1 shell, which can hold only two.

While the idea of shared electron pairs provides an effective qualitative picture of covalent bonding, quantum mechanics is needed to understand the nature of these bonds and predict the structures and properties of simple molecules. Walter Heitler and Fritz London are credited with the first successful quantum mechanical explanation of a chemical bond (molecular hydrogen) in 1927. Their work was based on the valence bond model, which assumes that a chemical bond is formed when there is good overlap between the atomic orbitals of participating atoms.

==Types of covalent bonds==
Atomic orbitals (except for s orbitals) have specific directional properties leading to different types of covalent bonds. Sigma (σ) bonds are the strongest covalent bonds and are due to head-on overlapping of orbitals on two different atoms. A single bond is usually a σ bond. Pi (π) bonds are weaker and are due to lateral overlap between p (or d) orbitals. A double bond between two given atoms consists of one σ and one π bond, and a triple bond is one σ and two π bonds.

Covalent bonds are also affected by the electronegativity of the connected atoms which determines the chemical polarity of the bond. Two atoms with equal electronegativity will make nonpolar covalent bonds such as H–H. An unequal relationship creates a polar covalent bond such as with H−Cl. However polarity also requires geometric asymmetry, or else dipoles may cancel out, resulting in a non-polar molecule.

== Covalent structures ==
There are several types of structures for covalent substances, including individual molecules, molecular structures, macromolecular structures and giant covalent structures. Individual molecules have strong bonds that hold the atoms together, but generally, there are negligible forces of attraction between molecules. Such covalent substances are usually gases, for example, HCl, SO2, CO2, and CH4. In molecular structures, there are weak forces of attraction. Such covalent substances are low-boiling-temperature liquids (such as ethanol), and low-melting-temperature solids (such as iodine and solid CO2). Macromolecular structures have large numbers of atoms linked by covalent bonds in chains, including synthetic polymers such as polyethylene and nylon, and biopolymers such as proteins and starch. Network covalent structures (or giant covalent structures) contain large numbers of atoms linked in sheets (such as graphite), or 3-dimensional structures (such as diamond and quartz). These substances have high melting and boiling points, are frequently brittle, and tend to have high electrical resistivity. Elements that have high electronegativity, and the ability to form three or four electron pair bonds, often form such large macromolecular structures.

== One- and three-electron bonds ==

Bonds with one or three electrons can be found in radical species, which have an odd number of electrons. The simplest example of a 1-electron bond is found in the dihydrogen cation, . One-electron bonds often have about half the bond energy of a 2-electron bond, and are therefore called &quot;half bonds&quot;. However, there are exceptions: in the case of dilithium, the bond is actually stronger for the 1-electron than for the 2-electron Li2. This exception can be explained in terms of hybridization and inner-shell effects.

The simplest example of three-electron bonding can be found in the helium dimer cation, . It is considered a &quot;half bond&quot; because it consists of only one shared electron (rather than two); in molecular orbital terms, the third electron is in an anti-bonding orbital which cancels out half of the bond formed by the other two electrons. Another example of a molecule containing a 3-electron bond, in addition to two 2-electron bonds, is nitric oxide, NO. The oxygen molecule, O2 can also be regarded as having two 3-electron bonds and one 2-electron bond, which accounts for its paramagnetism and its formal bond order of 2. Chlorine dioxide and its heavier analogues bromine dioxide and iodine dioxide also contain three-electron bonds.

Molecules with odd-electron bonds are usually highly reactive. These types of bond are only stable between atoms with similar electronegativities.

== Resonance ==

There are situations whereby a single Lewis structure is insufficient to explain the electron configuration in a molecule and its resulting experimentally-determined properties, hence a superposition of structures is needed. The same two atoms in such molecules can be bonded differently in different Lewis structures (a single bond in one, a double bond in another, or even none at all), resulting in a non-integer bond order. The nitrate ion is one such example with three equivalent structures. The bond between the nitrogen and each oxygen is a double bond in one structure and a single bond in the other two, so that the average bond order for each N–O interaction is = .

=== Aromaticity ===
In organic chemistry, when a molecule with a planar ring obeys Hückel&#x27;s rule, where the number of π electrons fit the formula 4&quot;n&quot; + 2 (where &quot;n&quot; is an integer), it attains extra stability and symmetry. In benzene, the prototypical aromatic compound, there are 6 π bonding electrons (&quot;n&quot; = 1, 4&quot;n&quot; + 2 = 6). These occupy three delocalized π molecular orbitals (molecular orbital theory) or form conjugate π bonds in two resonance structures that linearly combine (valence bond theory), creating a regular hexagon exhibiting a greater stabilization than the hypothetical 1,3,5-cyclohexatriene.

In the case of heterocyclic aromatics and substituted benzenes, the electronegativity differences between different parts of the ring may dominate the chemical behavior of aromatic ring bonds, which otherwise are equivalent.

=== Hypervalence ===

Certain molecules such as xenon difluoride and sulfur hexafluoride have higher coordination numbers than would be possible due to strictly covalent bonding according to the octet rule. This is explained by the three-center four-electron bond (&quot;3c–4e&quot;) model which interprets the molecular wavefunction in terms of non-bonding highest occupied molecular orbitals in molecular orbital theory and resonance of sigma bonds in valence bond theory.

=== Electron deficiency ===

In three-center two-electron bonds (&quot;3c–2e&quot;) three atoms share two electrons in bonding. This type of bonding occurs in boron hydrides such as diborane (B2H6), which are often described as electron deficient because there are not enough valence electrons to form localized (2-centre 2-electron) bonds joining all the atoms. However, the more modern description using 3c–2e bonds does provide enough bonding orbitals to connect all the atoms so that the molecules can instead be classified as electron-precise.

Each such bond (2 per molecule in diborane) contains a pair of electrons which connect the boron atoms to each other in a banana shape, with a proton (the nucleus of a hydrogen atom) in the middle of the bond, sharing electrons with both boron atoms. In certain cluster compounds, so-called four-center two-electron bonds also have been postulated.

== Quantum mechanical description ==
After the development of quantum mechanics, two basic theories were proposed to provide a quantum description of chemical bonding: valence bond (VB) theory and molecular orbital (MO) theory. A more recent quantum description is given in terms of atomic contributions to the electronic density of states.

=== Comparison of VB and MO theories ===
The two theories represent two ways to build up the electron configuration of the molecule. For valence bond theory, the atomic hybrid orbitals are filled with electrons first to produce a fully bonded valence configuration, followed by performing a linear combination of contributing structures (resonance) if there are several of them. In contrast, for molecular orbital theory, a linear combination of atomic orbitals is performed first, followed by filling of the resulting molecular orbitals with electrons.

The two approaches are regarded as complementary, and each provides its own insights into the problem of chemical bonding. As valence bond theory builds the molecular wavefunction out of localized bonds, it is more suited for the calculation of bond energies and the understanding of reaction mechanisms. As molecular orbital theory builds the molecular wavefunction out of delocalized orbitals, it is more suited for the calculation of ionization energies and the understanding of spectral absorption bands.

At the qualitative level, both theories contain incorrect predictions. Simple (Heitler–London) valence bond theory correctly predicts the dissociation of homonuclear diatomic molecules into separate atoms, while simple (Hartree–Fock) molecular orbital theory incorrectly predicts dissociation into a mixture of atoms and ions. On the other hand, simple molecular orbital theory correctly predicts Hückel&#x27;s rule of aromaticity, while simple valence bond theory incorrectly predicts that cyclobutadiene has larger resonance energy than benzene.

Although the wavefunctions generated by both theories at the qualitative level do not agree and do not match the stabilization energy by experiment, they can be corrected by configuration interaction. This is done by combining the valence bond covalent function with the functions describing all possible ionic structures or by combining the molecular orbital ground state function with the functions describing all possible excited states using unoccupied orbitals. It can then be seen that the simple molecular orbital approach overestimates the weight of the ionic structures while the simple valence bond approach neglects them. This can also be described as saying that the simple molecular orbital approach neglects electron correlation while the simple valence bond approach overestimates it.

Modern calculations in quantum chemistry usually start from (but ultimately go far beyond) a molecular orbital rather than a valence bond approach, not because of any intrinsic superiority in the former but rather because the MO approach is more readily adapted to numerical computations. Molecular orbitals are orthogonal, which significantly increases the feasibility and speed of computer calculations compared to nonorthogonal valence bond orbitals.

=== Covalency from atomic contribution to the electronic density of states ===
Evaluation of bond covalency is dependent on the basis set for approximate quantum-chemical methods such as COOP (crystal orbital overlap population), COHP (Crystal orbital Hamilton population), and BCOOP (Balanced crystal orbital overlap population). To overcome this issue, an alternative formulation of the bond covalency can be provided in this way.

The mass center of an atomic orbital formula_1 with quantum numbers for atom A is defined as

:formula_2

where formula_3 is the contribution of the atomic orbital formula_4 of the atom A to the total electronic density of states of the solid

:formula_5

where the outer sum runs over all atoms A of the unit cell. The energy window is chosen in such a way that it encompasses all of the relevant bands participating in the bond. If the range to select is unclear, it can be identified in practice by examining the molecular orbitals that describe the electron density along with the considered bond.

The relative position of the mass center of formula_6 levels of atom A with respect to the mass center of formula_7 levels of atom B is given as

:formula_8

where the contributions of the magnetic and spin quantum numbers are summed. According to this definition, the relative position of the A levels with respect to the B levels is

:formula_9

where, for simplicity, we may omit the dependence from the principal quantum number in the notation referring to 

In this formalism, the greater the value of the higher the overlap of the selected atomic bands, and thus the electron density described by those orbitals gives a more covalent bond. The quantity is denoted as the &quot;covalency&quot; of the bond, which is specified in the same units of the energy .

== Analogous effect in nuclear systems ==
An analogous effect to covalent binding is believed to occur in some nuclear systems, with the difference that the shared fermions are quarks rather than electrons. High energy proton-proton scattering cross-section indicates that quark interchange of either u or d quarks is the dominant process of the nuclear force at short distance. In particular, it dominates over the Yukawa interaction where a meson is exchanged. Therefore, covalent binding by quark interchange is expected to be the dominating mechanism of nuclear binding at small distance when the bound hadrons have covalence quarks in common.

<text>In polymer chemistry, condensation polymers are any kind of polymers whose process of polymerization involves a condensation reaction (i.e. a small molecule, such as water or methanol, is produced as a byproduct). Natural proteins as well as some common plastics such as nylon and PETE are formed in this way. Condensation polymers are formed by polycondensation, when the polymer is formed by condensation reactions between species of all degrees of polymerization, or by condensative chain polymerization, when the polymer is formed by sequential addition of monomers to an active site in a chain reaction. The main alternative forms of polymerization are chain polymerization and polyaddition, both of which give addition polymers.

Condensation polymerization is a form of step-growth polymerization. Linear polymers are produced from bifunctional monomers, i.e. compounds with two reactive end-groups. Common condensation polymers include polyesters, polyamides such as nylon, polyacetals, and proteins.

==Polyamides==
One important class of condensation polymers are polyamides. They arise from the reaction of carboxylic acid and an amine. Examples include nylons and proteins. When prepared from amino-carboxylic acids, e.g. amino acids, the stoichiometry of the polymerization includes co-formation of water:
:n H2N-X-CO2H → [HN-X-C(O)]n + (n-1) H2O

When prepared from diamines and dicarboxylic acids, e.g. the production of nylon 66, the polymerization produces two molecules of water per repeat unit:
:n H2N-X-NH2 + n HO2C-Y-CO2H → [HN-X-NHC(O)-Y-C(O)]n + (2n-1) H2O

==Polyesters==
Another important class of condensation polymers are polyesters. They arise from the reaction of a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. An example is polyethyleneterephthalate, the common plastic PET (recycling #1 in the USA):
:n HO-X-OH + n HO2C-Y-CO2H → [O-X-O2C-Y-C(O)]n + (2n-1) H2O
==Safety and environmental considerations==
Condensation polymers tend to be more biodegradable than addition polymers. The peptide or ester bonds between monomers can be hydrolysed, especially in the presence of catalysts or bacterial enzymes.
