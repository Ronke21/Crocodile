<text>The Kingdom of Dahomey () was a West African kingdom located within present-day Benin that existed from approximately 1600 until 1904. It developed on the Abomey Plateau amongst the Fon people in the early 17th century and became a regional power in the 18th century by expanding south to conquer key cities like Whydah belonging to the Kingdom of Whydah on the Atlantic coast which granted it unhindered access to the tricontinental Atlantic Slave Trade.

For much of the middle 19th century, the Kingdom of Dahomey became a key regional state, after eventually ending tributary status to the Oyo Empire. European visitors extensively documented the kingdom, and it became one of the most familiar African nations known to Europeans. The Kingdom of Dahomey was an important regional power that had an organized domestic economy built on conquest and slave labor, significant international trade and diplomatic relations with Europeans, a centralized administration, taxation systems, and an organized military. Notable in the kingdom were significant artwork, an all-female military unit called the Dahomey Amazons by European observers, and the elaborate religious practices of Vodun.

The growth of Dahomey coincided with the growth of the Atlantic slave trade, and it became known to Europeans as a major supplier of slaves. Dahomey was a highly militaristic society constantly organised for warfare; it captured captives during wars and raids against neighboring societies and sold them into the Atlantic slave trade in exchange for European goods such as rifles, gunpowder, fabrics, cowrie shells, tobacco, pipes, and alcohol. Other captives became slaves in Dahomey, where they worked on royal plantations or were killed in human sacrifices during the festival celebrations known as the Annual Customs of Dahomey. The Annual Customs of Dahomey involved significant collection and distribution of gifts and tribute, religious Vodun ceremonies, military parades, and discussions by dignitaries about the future for the kingdom.

In the 1840s, Dahomey began to face decline with British pressure to abolish the slave trade, which included the anti-slavery blockade of Africa by the Royal Navy&#x27;s West Africa Squadron. Dahomey was also weakened after facing crushing defeats at the hands of Abeokuta, a Yoruba city-state which was founded by the Oyo Empire refugees migrating southward. Dahomey later began experiencing territorial disputes with France which led to the war in 1890 and part of the kingdom becoming a French protectorate. The kingdom fell four years later, when renewed fighting resulted in the last king, Béhanzin, to be overthrown and the country annexed into French West Africa. 

French Dahomey would gain independence in 1960 as the Republic of Dahomey, which would rename itself Benin in 1975.

==Name==
The Kingdom of Dahomey was referred to by many different names and has been written in a variety of ways, including &quot;Danxome&quot;, &quot;Danhome&quot;, and &quot;Fon&quot;. The name &quot;Fon&quot; relates to the dominant ethnic and language group, the Fon people, of the royal families of the kingdom and is how the kingdom first became known to Europeans. The names &quot;Dahomey&quot;, &quot;Danxome&quot;, and &quot;Danhome&quot; share an origin story, which historian Edna Bay says may be a false etymology.

The story goes that Dakodonu, considered the second king in modern kings lists, was granted permission by the Gedevi chiefs, the local rulers, to settle in the Abomey Plateau. Dakodonu requested additional land from a prominent chief named Dan (or Da) to which the chief responded sarcastically, &quot;Should I open up my belly and build you a house in it?&quot; For this insult, Dakodonu killed Dan and began the construction of his palace on the spot. The name of the kingdom was derived from the incident: &quot;Dan&quot; meaning &quot;chief&quot;, &quot;xo&quot; meaning &quot;belly&quot;, and &quot;me&quot; meaning &quot;inside of&quot;, in the Fon language.

==History==

The Kingdom of Dahomey was established around 1600 as an offshoot of the royal dynasty of the Kingdom of Allada. The foundational king for Dahomey is often considered to be Houegbadja (c. 1645–1685), who built the Royal Palaces of Abomey and began raiding and taking over towns outside of the Abomey Plateau.

=== Kings ===
Source:

===Rule of Agaja (1708–1740)===
King Agaja, Houegbadja&#x27;s grandson, came to the throne in 1708 and began significant expansion of the Kingdom of Dahomey. This expansion was made possible by the superior military force of King Agaja&#x27;s Dahomey. In contrast to surrounding regions, Dahomey employed a professional standing army numbering around ten thousand. What the Dahomey lacked in numbers, they made up for in discipline and superior arms. In 1724, Agaja conquered Allada, the origin for the royal family according to oral tradition, and in 1727 he conquered Whydah. This increased size of the kingdom, particularly along the Atlantic coast, and increased power made Dahomey into a regional power. The result was near constant warfare with the main regional state, the Oyo Empire, from 1728 until 1740. The warfare with the Oyo empire resulted in Dahomey assuming a tributary status to the Oyo empire.

===Rule of Tegbesu (1740–1774)===
Tegbesu, also spelled as Tegbessou, was King of Dahomey, in present-day Benin, from 1740 until 1774. Tegbesu was not the oldest son of King Agaja (1708–1740), but was selected following his father&#x27;s death after winning a succession struggle with a brother. King Agaja had significantly expanded the Kingdom of Dahomey during his reign, notably conquering Whydah in 1727. This increased the size of the kingdom and increased both domestic dissent and regional opposition. Tegbessou ruled over Dahomey at a point where it needed to increase its legitimacy over those whom it had recently conquered. As a result, Tegbesu is often credited with a number of administrative changes in the kingdom in order to establish the legitimacy of the kingdom. 

The slave trade increased significantly during Tegbessou&#x27;s reign and began to provide the largest part of the income for the king. In addition, Tegbesu&#x27;s rule is the one with the first significant &quot;kpojito&quot; or mother of the leopard with Hwanjile in that role. The &quot;kpojito&quot; became a prominently important person in Dahomey royalty. Hwanjile, in particular, is said to have changed dramatically the religious practices of Dahomey by creating two new deities and more closely tying worship to that of the king. According to one oral tradition, as part of the tribute owed by Dahomey to Oyo, Agaja had to give to Oyo one of his sons. The story claims that only Hwanjile, of all of Agaja&#x27;s wives, was willing to allow her son to go to Oyo. This act of sacrifice, according to the oral tradition made Tegbesu, was favored by Agaja. Agaja reportedly told Tegbesu that he was the future king, but his brother Zinga was still the official heir.

=== Rule of Ghezo (1818–1859) ===
When King Ghezo ascended the throne in 1818, he was confronted by two immediate obstacles: the Kingdom of Dahomey was in political turmoil, and it was financially unstable. First, he needed to gain political independence by removing the tributary yoke that the Yoruba empire of Oyo had over the Dahomey since 1748. Secondly, he needed to revitalize the Dahomey economy. Both of these objectives relied on the slave trade. King Ghezo implemented new military strategies, which allowed them to take a physical stand against the Oyo, who were also a major competitor in the slave trade. He also put stipulations on Dahomey&#x27;s participation in the slave trade. Under his reign, no longer would the Dahomey be traded, as they were under the leadership of his brother, Adandozan. Dahomey would focus on capturing their enemies and trading them instead. King Ghezo sought to eventually lead his people toward the &quot;legitimate&quot; trade of palm oil.

The Dahomey were soon met with victory when they brought down the Oyo Empire and its yoke at Paonignan in 1827. While Brazil&#x27;s demand for slaves increased in 1830, the British started a campaign to abolish the slave trade in Africa. The British government began putting significant pressure on King Ghezo in the 1840s to end the slave trade in Dahomey. King Ghezo responded to these requests by emphasizing that he was unable to end the slave trade because of domestic pressure. He explained to them that the entire region had become dependent on the slave trading, so ending immediately would destabilize his kingdom and lead to anarchy. King William Dappa Pepple of Bonny and King Kosoko of Lagos took the same stance toward the British requests. Instead, King Ghezo proposed an expansion of the palm oil trade and gradual abolition of the slave trade.

King Ghezo&#x27;s reign was marked by great battles and significant changes to the empire, including the elevation of the Agojie. These &quot;Dahomey Amazon&quot; were pivotal to the defeat of Oyo Empire. His reign also cemented the Kingdom of Dahomey as one of the most powerful African kingdoms that stood against attempts by European missionaries, with Egba support, at converting people to Christianity, and maintained their traditional religion, known as Vodun. He abolished the human sacrifice of slaves and removed the death penalty for certain lesser offenses, such as adultery. Despite the kingdom&#x27;s history of brutality, King Ghezo was often characterized as honorable and unconquerable, even by his enemies. British missionary Thomas Birch Freeman described him as &quot;one of the most remarkable men of his age, whether we consider him in his private capacity as a man, or as a warrior and a statesmen.&quot;

===End===

The kingdom fought the First Franco-Dahomean War and Second Franco-Dahomean War with France. The kingdom was reduced and made a French protectorate in 1894.

In 1904, the area became part of a French colony, French Dahomey.

In 1958, French Dahomey became the self-governing colony called the Republic of Dahomey and gained full independence in 1960. It was renamed in 1975 the People&#x27;s Republic of Benin and in 1991 the Republic of Benin.

=== Modernity ===
Today, the kingdom continues to exist as a constituent monarchy located within Benin. Its rulers no longer hold any official powers under Benin&#x27;s constitution, but they retain some political and economic influence. Modern kings participate in important Vodun religious festivals and other traditional ceremonies.

==Politics==
Early writings often presented the kingdom as an absolute monarchy led by a despotic king. These depictions were often deployed as arguments by different sides in the slave trade debates, mainly in the United Kingdom, and as such were probably exaggerations. Recent historical work has emphasized the limits of monarchical power in the Kingdom of Dahomey. Historian John C. Yoder, with attention to the Great Council in the kingdom, argued that its activities do not &quot;imply that Dahomey&#x27;s government was democratic or even that her politics approximated those of nineteenth-century European monarchies. Such evidence supports the thesis that governmental decisions were molded by conscious responses to internal political pressures as well as by executive fiat.&quot; The primary political divisions revolved around villages with chiefs and administrative posts appointed by the king and acting as his representatives to adjudicate disputes in the village.

===King===
The King of Dahomey (&quot;Ahosu&quot; in the Fon language) was the sovereign power of the kingdom. All of the kings claimed to be part of the &quot;Alladaxonou&quot; dynasty, claiming descent from the royal family in Allada. Much of the succession rules and administrative structures were created early by Kings Houegbadja, Akaba, and Agaja. Succession through the male members of the line was the norm, with the kingship typically (but not always) going to the oldest son. The king was selected largely through discussion and decision in the meetings of the Great Council, although how this operated was not always clear. The Great Council brought together a host of different dignitaries from throughout the kingdom yearly to meet at the Annual Customs of Dahomey. Discussions would be lengthy and included members, both men and women, from throughout the kingdom. At the end of the discussions, the king would declare the consensus of the group.

===Royal court===
Key positions in the King&#x27;s court included the &quot;migan&quot; (Prime Minister), the &quot;mehu&quot; (Finance Minister), the &quot;yovogan&quot;, the &quot;tokpo&quot; (Minister of Agriculture), the &quot;agan&quot; (general of the army), the &quot;kpojito&quot; (or queen mother), and later the &quot;chacha&quot; (or viceroy) of Whydah. Each of these cabinet positionswhich, with the exception of the &quot;kpojito&quot;, were headed by menhad a female counterpart to complement them. The &quot;migan&quot;a combination of &quot;mi&quot; (our) and &quot;gan&quot; (chief)was a primary consul for the king, a key judicial figure, and served as the head executioner. The &quot;mehu&quot; was similarly a key administrative officer who managed the palaces and the affairs of the royal family, economic matters, and the areas to the south of Allada (making the position key to contact with Europeans).

==Foreign relations==

The relations between Dahomey and other countries were complex and heavily impacted by the transatlantic slave trade.

===Brazil===
In 1750, the Kingdom of Dahomey sent a diplomatic mission to Salvador, Portuguese colony of Brazil in order to strengthen diplomatic relations with this Portuguese colony following an incident which led to the expulsion of Portuguese-Brazilian diplomatic authorities in 1743.

Other Dahomey missions were sent to Portuguese colony of Brazil from 1795 to 1805 with the purpose of strengthening relations with Portuguese colonial authorities and slave buyers residing in Brazilian territory, ensuring that they maintained an interest in purchasing enslaved people supplied by Dahomey rather than rival kingdoms. It is also recorded that in 1823, the Kingdom of Dahomey formally recognized Brazil&#x27;s independence, making it one of the first political entities in the world to do so.

The Atlantic slave trade between Brazil and Dahomey remained intense even under pressure from the United Kingdom for its abolition. Francisco Félix de Sousa, a former enslaved person and later a major slave trader in the Dahomey region, became a politically influential figure in that kingdom after the ascent of Guezo to the Dahomean throne. He was granted the honorary title of Chachá, vice-king of Ajudá, and a monopoly on the exportation of slaves.

===France===
In 1861, the kingdom of Porto-Novo, one of Dahomey&#x27;s tributaries, was bombarded by the Royal Navy. Porto-Novo asked for protection from France and became a French protectorate as a result in 1863. This status was rejected by King Behanzin, who still declared Porto-Novo to be a tributary of Dahomey. Another issue of contention was the status of Cotonou, a port the French believed was under their control because of a treaty signed by Dahomey&#x27;s representative in Whydah. Dahomey ignored all French claims there as well and continued to collect customs from the port. These territorial disputes escalated into the First Franco-Dahomean War in 1890, resulting in French victory. Dahomey was forced to sign a treaty surrendering Porto-Novo and Cotonou to the French. It later returned to raiding the area and disregarded French complaints, triggering the Second Franco-Dahomean War in 1892. The kingdom was defeated in 1894, it was annexed into the French colonial empire as French Dahomey, and King Behanzin was exiled to Algeria.

===Portugal===
The Portuguese fort at Ouidah was destroyed by the army of Dahomey in 1743 during its conquest of the city, so King Tegbesu desired to renew relations with Portugal. Dahomey sent at least five embassies to Portugal and Brazil during the years of 1750, 1795, 1805, 1811 and 1818, with the goal of negotiating the terms of the Atlantic slave trade. These missions created an official correspondence between the kings of Dahomey and the kings of Portugal, and gifts were exchanged between them. The Portuguese Crown paid for the expenses travel and accommodation expenses of Dahomey&#x27;s ambassadors, who traveled between Lisbon and Salvador, Bahia. The embassies of 1805 and 1811 brought letters from King Adandozan, who had imprisoned Portuguese subjects in the Dahomean capital of Abomey and requested for Portugal to trade exclusively at Ouidah. Portugal promised to answer to his demands if he released the prisoners.

A long and detailed letter from King Adandonzan dated 9 October 1810 shows that he had knowledge of the Napoleonic Wars and the subsequent exile of the Portuguese royal family to Brazil, and he expressed remorse that he was not able to help the Portuguese royal family during their war against France. After detailing how he defeated the king of the Mahi nation, Adandonzan tells the Portuguese,
===United Kingdom===

Dahomey became a target of the British Empire&#x27;s anti-slavery campaign during the 19th century. The British sent diplomatic missions to Dahomey in an effort to convince King Ghezo to abolish human sacrifice and slave trading. Ghezo did not immediately concede to British demands but attempted to maintain friendly relations with Britain by encouraging the growth of new trade in palm oil instead. In 1851, the Royal Navy imposed a naval blockade against Dahomey, forcing Ghezo to sign a treaty in 1852 that immediately abolished the export of slaves. This was broken when slave trading resumed in 1857 and 1858. Historian Martin Meredith quotes Ghezo telling the British:


During a diplomatic mission to Dahomey in 1849, Captain Frederick E. Forbes of the Royal Navy received an enslaved girl (later named Sara Forbes Bonetta) from King Ghezo as a &quot;gift&quot;, who would later become a goddaughter to Queen Victoria.

===United States===
During the American Revolution, the rebelling United Colonies prohibited the international slave trade for a variety of economic, political, and moral reasons depending on the colony. Following the end of the revolution, U.S. President Thomas Jefferson signed the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves in 1807, which federally outlawed the international slave trade, though domestic slavery itself would persist until the American Civil War. Thus, the United States never established any formal diplomatic relations with the Kingdom of Dahomey. The last known slave ship that sailed to the United States secretly and illegally imported 110 slaves from Dahomey, purchased long after the abolition of the slave trade. The story was mentioned in the newspaper &quot;The Tarboro Southerner&quot; on July 14, 1860. Five days earlier, a schooner called &quot;Clotilda&quot;, captained by William Foster, arrived in the bay of Mobile, Alabama carrying the last known shipment of slaves to the U.S. In 1858, an American man named Timothy Meaher made a wager with acquaintances that despite the law banning the slave trade, he could safely bring a load of slaves from Africa. He built the &quot;Clotilda&quot; slave ship and sent William Foster to captain it and retrieve enslaved Africans.

Captain William Foster arrived in Ouidah, a coastal port of Dahomey, and retrieved 110 slaves. Describing how he came in possession of the slaves, he wrote in his journal in 1860,

Zora Neale Hurston wrote about her interviews with Oluale Kossola, who was thought to be the last survivor of the &quot;Clotilda&quot;, in her book &quot;&quot;. Later, it was found that Matilda McCrear was the last living survivor of that atrocity. A notable descendant of a slave from this ship is Ahmir Khalib Thompson, an American music artist known as Questlove. Mr. Thompson&#x27;s story is depicted in the PBS Television show &quot;Finding Your Roots&quot; [Season 4, Episode 9].

===Yoruba===
The Oyo Empire engaged in frequent conflicts with the Kingdom of Dahomey and Dahomey became a tributary of the Oyo from 1732 until 1823. The city-state of Porto-Novo, under the protection of Oyo, and Dahomey had a long-standing rivalry largely over control of the slave trade along the coast. The rise of Abeokuta in the 1840s created another power rivaling Dahomey, largely by creating a safe haven for people from the slave trade.

Notable Yoruba people who were captured by Dahomey in slave raids following the collapse of the Oyo Empire include Sara Forbes Bonetta (Aina), Cudjoe Lewis (Oluale Kossola), Matilda McCrear (Abake), Redoshi, and Seriki Williams Abass (Ifaremilekun Fagbemi).

==Military==
The military of the Kingdom of Dahomey was divided into two units: the right and the left. The right was controlled by the &quot;migan&quot; and the left was controlled by the &quot;mehu&quot;. At least by the time of Agaja, the kingdom had developed a standing army that remained encamped wherever the king was. Soldiers in the army were recruited as young as seven or eight years old, initially serving as shield carriers for regular soldiers. After years of apprenticeship and military experience, they were allowed to join the army as regular soldiers. To further incentivize the soldiers, each soldier received bonuses paid in cowry shells for each enemy they killed or captured in battle. This combination of lifelong military experience and monetary incentives resulted in a cohesive, well-disciplined military. One European said Agaja&#x27;s standing army consisted of &quot;elite troops, brave and well-disciplined, led by a prince full of valor and prudence, supported by a staff of experienced officers&quot;. The army consisted of 15,000 personnel which was divided into right, left, center and reserve; and in each of these was further divided into companies and platoons.

In addition to being well trained, the Dahomey army under Agaja was also very well armed. The Dahomey army favored imported European weapons as opposed to traditional weapons. For example, they used European flintlock muskets in long-range combat and imported steel swords and cutlasses in close combat. The Dahomey army also possessed twenty-five cannons. By the late 19th century, Dahomey had a large arsenal of weapons. These included the Chassepot Dreyse, Mauser, Snider Enfield, Wanzel, Werndl, Peabody action, Winchester, Spencer, Albini, Robert Jones carbine, French musketoon 1882 and the Mitrailleuse Reffye 1867. Along with firearms, Dahomey employed mortars.

When going into battle, the king would take a secondary position to the field commander with the reason given that if any spirit were to punish the commander for decisions it should not be the king. Dahomey units were drilled constantly. They fired on command, employed countermarch, and formed extended lines from deep columns. Tactics such as covering fire, frontal attacks and flanking movements were used in the warfare of Dahomey. The Dahomey Amazons, a unit of all-female soldiers, is one of the most unusual aspects of the military of the kingdom. Unlike other regional powers, the military of Dahomey did not have a significant cavalry (like the Oyo empire) or naval power (which prevented expansion along the coast). From the 18th century, the state could obtain naval support from Ardra where they had created a subordinate dynasty after conquering the state in the early 18th century. Dahomey enlisted the services of Ardra&#x27;s navy against the Epe in 1778 and Badagry in 1783.

===Amazons===
The Dahomean state became widely known for its corps of female soldiers. Their origins are debated; they may have formed from a palace guard or from (female hunting teams).

They were organized around 1729 to fill out the army and make it look larger in battle, armed only with banners. The women reportedly behaved so courageously they became a permanent corps. In the beginning, the soldiers were criminals pressed into service rather than death. Eventually, the corps was respected enough that King Ghezo ordered every family to send him their daughters, with the fittest being chosen as soldiers. European accounts clarified that seven distinct movements were required to load a Dane gun which took an Amazon 30 seconds in comparison to the 50 seconds it took a Dahomean male soldier to load.

=== Siege and engineering ===
In order to repress the navies of its neighbors, Dahomey built causeways starting from 1774. During a campaign against Whydah that year, Dahomey was able to force Whydah to fortify itself at an island called Foudou-Cong. Dahomey cut trees which were planted in the water to serve as a causeway and bridge the army&#x27;s access to the fortified Whydah island. The causeway also obstructed the movement of a 700 canoe force belonging to Whydah. As a result, the Whydah army had to survive on the boats for months sustaining its forces with fish diet. According to Thornton, Dahomey used this strategy of siege causeways again in 1776 against another opponent state where it built 3 bridges to connect the island housing the opponent forces. 

Coastal belligerents opposing Dahomey allied with European forts against the state. Dahomey was able to capture Dutch and Portuguese forts in the 18th century through the use of ladders and sappers. Thornton writes that in 1737, Dahomey used scale ladders against the Dutch fort in Keta simultaneously as its sappers built a tunnel under the fort&#x27;s bastion causing it to collapse when its defenders fired an artillery round within the bastion. A similar tactic was employed against a Portuguese fort with 30 mounted guns at Whydah in 1743 as its bastions collapsed enabling the Dahomey infantry to enter the fort. In 1728, Dahomey forces captured and destroyed a French fort at Whydah by blowing up the magazine that held the fort&#x27;s ammunition and gunpowder. Another tactic for attacking coastal forts was the burning of nearby villages during a land breeze in order for the wind to carry the flames toward the fort. This tactic was first revealed by a British commander at Whydah in 1728, who countered it by burning the nearby villages during a sea breeze to prevent the Dahomeyan army from burning the villages during a land breeze. 

As a result of the threat posed by Oyo in the 18th century, the state built fortifications of its own with the help of a French officer from whom they learnt field fortification and artillery. According to a Dutch source in 1772, the king of Dahomey &quot;has made deep ditches around his entire country as well as walls and batteries mounted with cannons he captured at Fida [Whydah].&quot; Thornton suggests these fortifications were mostly built out of wood. Dahomey used a tactic of trench construction against Oyo where its forces withdrew into the trenches after confrontation with the Oyo force. Despite this, Dahomey was overwhelmed by an Oyo siege after the arrival of reinforcement. In the mid 18th century, Abomey was surrounded by a ditch accessible by bridges whiles in 1772 the royal residence was surrounded with a mud brick wall 20 feet high, &quot;with blockhouses on each wall.&quot; 

Dahomey also built underground chambers in Abomey which served varying functions including that of providing military installations for the army. These souterrains have been dated to the late 17th century. Wheeled vehicles are recorded to have been implemented in Dahomeyan warfare. In an operation against Abeokuta in 1864, Dahomey fielded three guns mounted on locally made carriages of which historian Robin Law adds that these weapons did not play an effective role in the battle. Some references exist about the possible production of guns and gunpowder in Dahomey. In 1880, king Béhanzin informed a French mission that firearms were manufactured in the state. Amid the war with France in 1892, a French expeditionary force discovered tools and resources such as cartridge cases, signal rockets and electric batteries which are necessary for making cartridges and repairing firearms.

==Economy==
The economic structure of the kingdom was highly intertwined with the political and religious systems and these developed together significantly. The main currency was cowry shells.

===Domestic===
The domestic economy largely focused on agriculture and crafts for local consumption. Until the development of palm oil, very little agricultural or craft goods were traded outside of the kingdom. Markets served a key role in the kingdom and were organized around a rotating cycle of four days with a different market each day (the market type for the day was religiously sanctioned). Agriculture work was largely decentralized and done by most families. With the expansion of the kingdom, agricultural plantations began to be a common agricultural method in the kingdom. Craftwork was largely dominated by a formal guild system. Several wealthy citizens stored their cowrie wealth in a building called &quot;akueho&quot; (cowrie huts) located in the compounds of their houses. Such cowrie huts were designed to protect the cowries from fire and theft. Iroko argues that this was a form of banking in Dahomey because the owners of such &quot;akueho&quot; houses regularly kept the deposits of others in the storehouse which they used as a form of loans to 3rd parties. Guyer and Stiansen on the other hand, are skeptical of Iroko&#x27;s theory.

==== Taxation ==== 
Herskovits recounts a complex tax system in the kingdom, in which officials who represented the king, the , gathered data from each village regarding their harvest. Then the king set a tax based upon the level of production and village population. In addition, the king&#x27;s own land and production were taxed. After significant road construction undertaken by the kingdom, toll booths were also established that collected yearly taxes based on the goods people carried and their occupation. Officials also sometimes imposed fines for public nuisance before allowing people to pass. Tax officials on road tolls were provided with armed guards. 

Taxes were imposed on craft workers including blacksmiths, weavers and wood cutters for example. Kangaroo courts could be held at any place such as the market or on roads, presided over by officials recognized by the central government. Such courts could extract some form of tax from the litigants before judging the case. Since the 18th century, prostitution (&quot;Ko-si&quot;) was licensed by the king. Robert Norris and Archibald Dalzel documented in the late 18th century that the central government was responsible for distributing prostitutes throughout the state at a price set by civil decree. Taxes were derived from prostitutes during the annual customs.

=== Royal Road ===
An unpaved road system was developed from the port of Ouidah through Cana up to Abomey. Its purpose was to improve the transportation of the king between Cana and Abomey. The Royal Road dates to the 18th century but most primary sources about the road date to the century after. The road stretched over seven miles in a near straight line, between the gates of the two towns and its width was estimated to be 20–30 meters. The road was occasionally kept weeded and cleared with cutlass. Primary sources give varying accounts that the Royal Road was kept cleared every two or three months or even six weeks. The road was shaded by tall trees. The biggest specimen was that of a bombax tree species. Surrounding the road on both sides were intensive farms which Forbes stated in the mid 19th century, to have &quot;rivaled that of the Chinese.&quot; 

In addition, religious shrines were lined along the road and Forbes counted 60 of them en route to Abomey. A palace was built halfway along the road by Tegbesu (1740–1774) to host the king as a resting place during transport. There is a lack of information about security provided across the Royal Road. Primary sources from the mid 19th century indicate that a large pair of carronades was placed on each side of the road near Abomey, which pointed toward Cana. A large number of cannons with diverse calibers were also placed at the road&#x27;s end before the gates of Cana. Historian Alpern, indicates that the cannons in front of Cana might have served a ceremonial purpose because they lacked carriages to utilize.

===Slavery===

Both domestic slavery and the Atlantic slave trade were important to the economy of Dahomey. Men, women, and children captured by Dahomey in wars and slave raids were sold to European slave traders in exchange for various goods such as rifles, gunpowder, textiles, cowry shells, and alcohol. Dahomey used magical rituals for slave trading. Prior to being sold to Europeans, slaves were forced to march in circles around the &quot;Tree of Forgetfulness&quot; so they would lose memories of their culture, family, and homeland. The purpose of this ritual was to prevent the spirits of deceased slaves from returning and seeking revenge against the royalty of Dahomey.

Other war captives who were not intended to be sold to Europeans remained in Dahomey as slaves. There, they worked on royal plantations that supplied food for the army and royal court. Some historians such as Watson and Schellinger have argued that the shift from slave trading to a plantation economy in the 19th century worsened the social perception of slaves in Dahomey. They cite reasons that slaves before then were treated as members of their master&#x27;s family and they could attain free status after a generation or two. Following the intensification of palm oil in the state, it became common for slaves to be abused and ill treated. To solve this issue, King Ghezo declared the trial of cases involving the murder of slaves at the Judicial Court in Abomey.

There was a history of large-scale human sacrifice using slaves.

==Religion==

The Kingdom of Dahomey shared many religious rituals with surrounding populations. It also developed unique ceremonies, beliefs, and religious stories. These included royal ancestor worship and West African Vodun.

===Royal ancestor worship===

Early kings established clear worship of royal ancestors and centralized their ceremonies in the Annual Customs of Dahomey. The spirits of the kings had an exalted position in the land of the dead and it was necessary to get their permission for many activities on earth. Ancestor worship predated the kingdom of Dahomey; under King Agaja, a cycle of ritual was created centered on first celebrating the ancestors of the king and then celebrating a family lineage.

The Annual Customs of Dahomey ( or in Fon) involved multiple elaborate components and some aspects may have been added in the 19th century. In general, the celebration involved distribution of gifts, human sacrifice, military parades, and political councils. Its main religious aspect was to offer thanks and gain the approval for ancestors of the royal lineage.

Human sacrifice was an important part of the practice. During the Annual Custom, 500 prisoners would be sacrificed. In addition, when a ruler died, hundreds, to thousands of prisoners would be sacrificed. In 1727, an English trader alleged that he witness the Dahomey massacre 400 people during a Vodun ceremony. The number is also often reported to be 4,000. Human sacrifice was often exaggerated by contemporary anti-abolitionist Western authors, who sought to justify the continued need for slavery as a means to &quot;rescue&quot; Africans from a worse fate in Dahomey.

===Cosmology===
Dahomey had a unique form of West African Vodun that linked together preexisting animist traditions with vodun practices. Oral history recounted that Hwanjile, a wife of Agaja and mother of Tegbessou, brought Vodun to the kingdom and ensured its spread. The primary deity is the combined Mawu-Lisa (Mawu having female characteristics and Lisa having male characteristics) and it is claimed that this god took over the world that was created by their mother Nana-Buluku. Mawu-Lisa governs the sky and is the highest pantheon of gods, but other gods exist in the earth and in thunder. Religious practice organized different priesthoods and shrines for each different god and each different pantheon (sky, earth or thunder). Women made up a significant amount of the priest class and the chief priest was always a descendant of Dakodonou.

==Arts==

The arts in Dahomey were unique and distinct from the artistic traditions elsewhere in Africa. The arts were substantially supported by the king and his family, had non-religious traditions, assembled multiple different materials, and borrowed widely from other peoples in the region. Common art forms included wood and ivory carving, metalwork (including silver, iron and brass, appliqué cloth, and clay bas-reliefs).

The king was key in supporting the arts and many of them provided significant sums for artists resulting in the unique development, for the region, of a non-religious artistic tradition in the kingdom. Artists were not of a specific class but both royalty and commoners made important artistic contributions. Kings were often depicted in large zoomorphic forms with each king resembling a particular animal in multiple representations.

Suzanne Blier identifies two unique aspects of art in Dahomey: Assemblage of different components and borrowing from other states. Assemblage of art, involving the combination of multiple components (often of different materials) combined in a single piece of art, was common in all forms and was the result of the various kings promoting finished products rather than particular styles. This assembling may have been a result of the second feature, which involved the wide borrowing of styles and techniques from other cultures and states. Clothing, cloth work, architecture, and the other forms of art all resemble other artistic representation from around the region.

Much of the artwork revolved around the royalty. Each of the palaces at the Royal Palaces of Abomey contained elaborate bas-reliefs (&quot;noundidė&quot; in Fon) providing a record of the king&#x27;s accomplishments. Each king had his own palace within the palace complex and within the outer walls of their personal palace was a series of clay reliefs designed specific to that king. These were not solely designed for royalty and chiefs, temples, and other important buildings had similar reliefs. The reliefs would present Dahomey kings often in military battles against the Oyo or Mahi tribes to the north of Dahomey with their opponents depicted in various negative depictions (the king of Oyo is depicted in one as a baboon eating a cob of corn). Historical themes dominated representation and characters were basically designed and often assembled on top of each other or in close proximity creating an ensemble effect. In addition to the royal depictions in the reliefs, royal members were depicted in power sculptures known as &quot;bocio&quot;, which incorporated mixed materials (including metal, wood, beads, cloth, fur, feathers, and bone) onto a base forming a standing figure. The bocio are religiously designed to include different forces together to unlock powerful forces. In addition, the cloth appliqué of Dahomey depicted royalty often in similar zoomorphic representation and dealt with matters similar to the reliefs, often the kings leading during warfare.

Dahomey had a distinctive tradition of casting small brass figures of animals or people, which were worn as jewellery or displayed in the homes of the relatively well-off. These figures, which continue to be made for the tourist trade, were relatively unusual in traditional African art in having no religious aspect, being purely decorative, as well as indicative of some wealth. Also unusual, by being so early and clearly provenanced, is a carved wooden tray (not dissimilar to much more recent examples) in Ulm, Germany, which was brought to Europe before 1659, when it was described in a printed catalogue.

Wheeled carriages were used in Dahomey after their introduction into the region of modern Benin in the late 17th century. Some carriages were manufactured indigenously while most were obtained as gifts from European allies. The carriages were often used for ceremonial purposes and were drawn mostly by men due to the small number of horses in the state. Carriages in Dahomey came in varying sizes and shapes. Some were modelled after ships, elephants and horses. Burton noted that the road between Abomey and the town of Cana, which was about six to seven miles long, was regularly kept weeded for the convenience of the royal carriages.

==In popular culture==

The Kingdom of Dahomey has been depicted in a number of different works of fiction or creative nonfiction.

===Literature and theatre===
*In the novel &quot;Robur the Conqueror&quot; (1886) by Jules Verne, the crew and passengers of the &quot;Albatross&quot; travel to Dahomey, where they interrupt an act of human sacrifice.
*&quot;In Dahomey&quot; (1903) was a successful Broadway musical, the first full-length Broadway musical written entirely by African Americans, in the early 20th century. 
*Novelist Paul Hazoumé&#x27;s first novel &quot;Doguicimi&quot; (1938) was based on decades of research into the oral traditions of the Kingdom of Dahomey during the reign of King Ghezo. 
*The anthropologist Judith Gleason wrote a novel, &quot;Agõtĩme: Her Legend&quot; (1970), centered on one of the wives of a king of Dahomey in the late 18th century, who offends her husband who sells her to slavery in Brazil; she makes a bargain with a &quot;vodu&quot; (deity), putting her son on the throne of Dahomey and bringing her home. 
*Another novel tracing the background of a slave, this time in the United States, was &quot;The Dahomean&quot;, or &quot;The Man from Dahomey&quot; (1971), by the African-American novelist Frank Yerby; its hero is an aristocratic warrior. 
*In the third of George McDonald Fraser&#x27;s Flashman novels, &quot;Flash for Freedom!&quot; (1971), Flashman dabbles in the slave trade and visits Dahomey. 
*&quot;The Viceroy of Ouidah&quot; (1980) by Bruce Chatwin is the story of a Brazilian who, hoping to make his fortune from slave trading, sails to Dahomey in 1812, befriending its unbalanced king and coming to a bad end. 
*The main character of one of the two parallel stories in &quot;Will Do Magic for Small Change&quot; (2016) by Andrea Hairston is Kehinde, a Yoruba woman forced into the Dahomean army; she struggles with divided loyalty, and after the fall of Behanzin, joins a French entertainment troupe who intend to exhibit her as an Amazon at the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair. 
*The Booker Prize-winning novel &quot;Girl, Woman, Other&quot; (2019) by Bernardine Evaristo features a character named Amma who writes and directs a play titled &quot;The Last Amazon of Dahomey&quot;.
*Behanzin&#x27;s resistance to the French attempt to end slave trading and human sacrifice has been central to a number of works. Jean Pliya&#x27;s first play &quot;Kondo le requin&quot; (1967), winner of the Grand Prize for African History Literature, tells the story of Behanzin&#x27;s struggle to maintain the old order. Maryse Condé&#x27;s novel &quot;The Last of the African Kings&quot; (1992) similarly focuses on Behanzin&#x27;s resistance and his exile to the Caribbean. The novel &quot;Thread of Gold Beads&quot; (2012) by Nike Campbell centers on a daughter of Behanzin; through her eyes, the end of his reign is observed.
* Zora Neale Hurston&#x27;s book &quot;&quot;, posthumously published May 2018.

===Film and television===
*Dahomey&#x27;s role in the slave trade is the central focus of the film &quot;Cobra Verde&quot; (1987), directed by Werner Herzog and adapted from the novel &quot;The Viceroy of Ouidah&quot; (1980). The main protagonist is a fictional Brazilian slave trader who travels to the kingdom, and the character is based upon the historical Brazilian slave trader Francisco Félix de Sousa, who was politically and economically influential in Dahomey during the reigns of King Adandozan and King Ghezo. 
*The historical television drama &quot;Victoria&quot; (2016) portrays the real-life story of Sara Forbes Bonetta being freed from slavery in Dahomey in season 2 episode 17 (&quot;Comfort and Joy&quot;).
*The Dahomey Amazons are depicted in the film &quot;The Woman King&quot; (2022), directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood.
* A documentary titled &quot;Dahomey&quot; directed by Mati Diop, an international co-production among France, Senegal and Benin, was selected in the Competition at the 74th Berlin International Film Festival to be held from 15 to 25 February 2024, where it will compete for the Golden Bear. It is about return of 26 of the royal treasures of the Kingdom of Dahomey to Benin.

===Video games===
Dahomey has been depicted in some historical war strategy video games. 
*The Dahomey Amazons appear in the historical strategy video game &quot;&quot; (2009), developed by Creative Assembly.
*In the grand strategy video games &quot;Europa Universalis IV&quot; (2013) and &quot;Victoria 3&quot; (2022), both developed by Paradox Interactive, Dahomey appears as one of many historical nations that players can play as or interact with.

<doc id="8767" wikidata="Q194199" url="?curid=8767" title="Dragoon">
<text>Dragoons were originally a class of mounted infantry, who used horses for mobility, but dismounted to fight on foot. From the early 17th century onward, dragoons were increasingly also employed as conventional cavalry and trained for combat with swords and firearms from horseback. While their use goes back to the late 16th century, dragoon regiments were established in most European armies during the 17th and early 18th centuries; they provided greater mobility than regular infantry but were far less expensive than cavalry.

The name reputedly derives from a type of firearm, called a &quot;dragon&quot;, which was a handgun version of a blunderbuss, carried by dragoons of the French Army.

The title has been retained in modern times by a number of armoured or ceremonial mounted regiments.

== Origins and name ==
The establishment of dragoons evolved from the practice of sometimes transporting infantry by horse when speed of movement was needed. In 1552, Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma, mounted several companies of infantry on pack horses to achieve surprise, another example being that used by Louis of Nassau in 1572 during operations near Mons in Hainaut, when 500 infantry were transported this way. It is also suggested the first dragoons were raised by the Marshal de Brissac in 1600. According to old German literature, dragoons were invented by Count Ernst von Mansfeld, one of the greatest German military commanders, in the early 1620s. There are other instances of mounted infantry predating this. However Mansfeld, who had learned his profession in Hungary and the Netherlands, often used horses to make his foot troops more mobile, creating what was called an &quot;armée volante&quot; (French for &#x27;flying army&#x27;).

During the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire in the 16th century, Spanish conquistadors fought on horse with arquebuses, prefiguring the origin of European dragoons.

The origin of the name remains disputed and obscure. It possibly derives from an early weapon, a short wheellock, called a &quot;dragon&quot; because its muzzle was decorated with a dragon&#x27;s head. The practice comes from a time when all gunpowder weapons had distinctive names, including the culverin, serpentine, falcon, falconet, etc. It is also sometimes claimed a galloping infantryman with his loose coat and the burning match resembled a dragon. It has also been asserted that the name was coined by Mansfeld as a comparison to dragons represented as &quot;spitting fire and being swift on the wing&quot;. Finally, it has been suggested that the name derives from the German &quot;tragen&quot; or the Dutch &quot;dragen&quot;, both being the verb &quot;to carry&quot; in their respective languages. Howard Reid claims the name and role descend from the Latin &quot;Draconarius&quot;.

=== Use as a verb ===
Dragoon is occasionally used as a verb meaning to subjugate or persecute by the imposition of troops; and by extension to compel by any violent measures or threats. The term dates from 1689, when dragoons were being used by the French monarchy to persecute Protestants, particularly by forcing Protestants to lodge a dragoon (&quot;dragonnades&quot;) in their house to watch over them at the householder&#x27;s expense.

== Early history and role ==
Early dragoons were not organized in squadrons or troops as were cavalry, but in companies like the infantry. Their commissioned and non-commissioned officers bore infantry ranks, while they used drummers, not buglers, to communicate orders on the battlefield. The flexibility of mounted infantry made dragoons a useful arm, especially when employed for what would now be termed &quot;internal security&quot; against smugglers or civil unrest, and on line of communication security duties.

In Britain, companies of dragoons were first raised during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms and prior to 1645 either served as independent troops or were attached to cavalry units. When the New Model Army was first approved by Parliament in January 1645, it included ten regiments of cavalry, each with a company of dragoons attached. At the urging of Sir Thomas Fairfax, on 1 March they were formed into a separate unit of 1,000 men, commanded by Colonel John Okey, and played an important part at the Battle of Naseby in June.

Supplied with inferior horses and more basic equipment, the dragoon regiments were cheaper to raise and maintain than the expensive regiments of cavalry. When in the 17th century Gustav II Adolf introduced dragoons into the Swedish Army, he provided them with a sword, an axe and a matchlock musket, using them as &quot;labourers on horseback&quot;. Many of the European armies henceforth imitated this all-purpose set of weaponry. Dragoons of the late 17th and early 18th centuries retained strong links with infantry in appearance and equipment, differing mainly in the substitution of riding boots for shoes and the adoption of caps instead of broad-brimmed hats to enable muskets to be worn slung.

A non-military use of dragoons was the 1681 &quot;Dragonnades&quot;, a policy instituted by Louis XIV to intimidate Huguenot families into either leaving France or re-converting to Catholicism by billeting ill-disciplined dragoons in Protestant households. While other categories of infantry and cavalry were also used, the mobility, flexibility and available numbers of the dragoon regiments made them particularly suitable for repressive work of this nature over a wide area.

In the Spanish Army, Pedro de la Puente organized a body of dragoons in Innsbruck in 1635. In 1640, a &quot;tercio&quot; of a thousand dragoons armed with the arquebus was created in Spain. By the end of the 17th century, the Spanish Army had three &quot;tercios&quot; of dragoons in Spain, plus three in the Netherlands and three more in Milan. In 1704, the Spanish dragoons were reorganised into regiments by Philip V, as were the rest of the &quot;tercios&quot;.

Dragoons were at a disadvantage when engaged against true cavalry, and constantly sought to improve their horsemanship, armament and social status. By the Seven Years&#x27; War in 1756, their primary role in most European armies had progressed from that of mounted infantry to that of heavy cavalry. They were sometimes described as &quot;medium&quot; cavalry, midway between heavy/armoured and light/unarmoured regiments, though this was a classification that was rarely used at the time. Their original responsibilities for scouting and picket duty had passed to hussars and similar light cavalry corps in the French, Austrian, Prussian, and other armies. In the Imperial Russian Army, due to the availability of Cossack troops, the dragoons were retained in their original role for much longer.

An exception to the rule was the British Army, which from 1746 onward gradually redesignated all regiments of &quot;horse&quot; (regular cavalry) as lower paid &quot;dragoons&quot;, in an economy measure. Starting in 1756, seven regiments of light dragoons were raised and trained in reconnaissance, skirmishing and other work requiring endurance in accordance with contemporary standards of light cavalry performance. The success of this new class of cavalry was such that another eight dragoon regiments were converted between 1768 and 1783. When this reorganisation was completed in 1788, the cavalry arm consisted of regular dragoons and seven units of dragoon guards. The designation of dragoon guards did not mean that these regiments (the former 2nd to 8th horse) had become household troops, but simply that they had been given a more dignified title to compensate for the loss of pay and prestige.

Towards the end of 1776, George Washington realized the need for a mounted branch of the American military. In January 1777 four regiments of light dragoons were raised. Short term enlistments were abandoned and the dragoons joined for three years, or &quot;the war&quot;. They participated in most of the major engagements of the American War of Independence, including the battles of White Plains, Trenton, Princeton, Brandywine, Germantown, Saratoga, Cowpens, and Monmouth, as well as the Yorktown campaign.

== 19th century ==
During the Napoleonic Wars, dragoons generally assumed a cavalry role, though remaining a lighter class of mounted troops than the armored cuirassiers. Dragoons rode larger horses than the light cavalry and wielded straight, rather than curved swords. 

=== France ===
Emperor Napoleon often formed complete divisions out of his 30 dragoon regiments, while in 1811 six regiments were converted to &quot;Chevau-Legers Lanciers&quot;; they were often used in battle to break the enemy&#x27;s main resistance. In northern and eastern Europe they were employed as heavy cavalry, while in the Peninsular War they also fulfilled the role of lighter cavalry, for example in anti-guerrilla operations. In 1809, French dragoons scored notable successes against Spanish armies at the Battle of Ocana and the Battle of Alba de Tormes.

=== British Army ===

Between 1806 and 1808, the 7th, 10th, 15th and 18th regiments of Light Dragoons of the British Army were re-designated as hussars and when the Napoleonic Wars ended in 1815, some became lancers. The transition from dragoons to hussars was however a slow one, affecting uniforms but not equipment and functions. Even titles often remained ambiguous until 1861, for example, 18th King&#x27;s Light Dragoons (Hussars).

The seven regiments of Dragoon Guards served as the heavy cavalry arm of the British Army, although unlike continental cuirassiers they carried no armour. Between 1816 and 1861, the other twenty-one cavalry regiments were either disbanded or rebadged as lancers or hussars.

=== Kingdom of Prussia ===
The Kingdom of Prussia in the Napoleonic era included 14 Regiments of Dragoons, designated Numbers 1 through 14, in their Order of Battle at the start of the 1806 Campaign against Napoleon&#x27;s French Army. Prussian cavalry regiments were better known by their &quot;Chef&quot; or &quot;Inhaber&quot;, the titular commander responsible for supporting the regiment, while command in the field might fall to a more junior Colonel, Lt. Colonel, or even a Major. As a result, every time there was a change in &quot;Chef&quot; the name of the regiment changed. By 1806, the Prussian Dragoons wore a very tall bicorn hat worn slanted slightly obliquely with a tall, white plume. Their uniforms had changed by 1802 from coats that had been cut like the infantry to short, medium-blue cavalry tunics. Each regiment had differentiating colors for a variety of uniform accessories such as small pompoms at the side of the hat, tunic facings and shoulder flaps on the left shoulder, woolen tassels for the sabre straps, and the horse saddlecloths. Dragoons were issued a long, straight blade with a single edge, the Dragoon Pallasch sword, which featured a brass basket hilt for hand protection. The Pallasch was designed for powerful cutting and thrusting action, making it effective for cavalry charges.

For the period of 1798 to October of 1806, the majority of Prussian Dragoon regiments were similar to Prussian Cuirassier regiments in staffing and organization. Most were made up of 5 squadrons with an &#x27;on paper&#x27; war-time regimental strength of 935 men including soldiers, officers, and all the support staff. The minor difference was that Dragoon regiments had 10 more carabiniers (60 in a Dragoon regiment compared to 50 in a Cuirassier regiment) and therefore ten fewer regular troopers (660 Dragoons compared to 670 Cuirassiers). The average regimental staff of most of the regiments was around 37 officers, 65 NCOs, one staff trumpeter and 14 trumpeters, supported by 5 surgeons led by a regimental surgeon, 9 blacksmiths, a regimental quartermaster, a chaplain and a judge, a horse trainer, a saddlemaker, a gunsmith and a gunstock maker, a provost, and 68 servants. The two regiments that were exceptions were the 5th &quot;Bayreuth&quot; (re-designated in March 1806 as the Queen&#x27;s or &quot;Königin&quot; Dragoons) and the 6th &quot;Auer&quot; Dragoon regiments, which were double-strength with 10 squadrons and retained 2/3rd German heavy horses. 

After the disastrous results of the 1806-07 war with France, most of the Prussian army had ceased to exist. For example, the 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, and 14th Dragoon regiments were totally lost and even the 9th and 14th Dragoon regimental depots had been destroyed. The complete re-organization of the Prussian army in 1808 led to numerous regiments being re-organized and re-designated, mixing surviving Dragoons and Cuirassier veterans with new recruits into a new numeric system and losing the traditional &quot;Chef&quot; naming schema in favor of a mostly geographical designation, with a few exceptions. For example, the old pre-1807 5th &quot;Bayreuth&quot;/&quot;Königin&quot; Dragoons became the 1st &quot;Königin&quot; Dragoon regiment, while the 7th &quot;von Baczko&quot; Dragoons became the 3rd &quot;Lithuanian&quot; Dragoon regiment. The newly designated 5th &quot;Brandenburg&quot; Dragoons were formed from merging the remains of the 5th &quot;von Bailliodz&quot; Cuirassier regiment and its depot with the remains of the old 1st &quot;Konig von Bayern&quot; Dragoon regiment and its depot. This resulted in the reduction of Prussian Dragoon regiments from 14 to 6.

Many of these new Prussian Dragoon regiments fought in the 1813 Wars of Liberation in the Sixth Coalition against Napoleon in central Europe and France into 1814.

=== German Empire ===
The creation of a unified German state in 1871 brought together the dragoon regiments of Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony, Mecklenburg, Oldenburg, Baden, Hesse, and Württemberg in a single numbered sequence, although historic distinctions of insignia and uniform were largely preserved. Two regiments of the Imperial Guard were designated as dragoons.

=== Austria ===
The Austrian (later Austro-Hungarian) Army of the 19th century included six regiments of dragoons in 1836, classed as heavy cavalry for shock action, but in practice used as multi-purpose medium troops. After 1859 all but two Austrian dragoon regiments were converted to cuirassiers or disbanded. From 1868 to 1918 the Austro-Hungarian dragoons numbered 15 regiments.

=== Spain ===
During the 18th century, Spain raised several regiments of dragoons to protect the northern provinces and borders of New Spain, the present-day states of California, Nevada, Colorado, Texas, Kansas, Arizona, Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota. In mainland Spain, dragoons were reclassified as light cavalry from 1803 but remained among the elite units of the Spanish Colonial Army. A number of dragoon officers played a leading role in initiating the Mexican War of Independence in 1810, including Ignacio Allende, Juan Aldama and Agustin de Iturbide, who briefly served as Emperor of México from 1822 to 1823.

=== USA ===
Prior to the War of 1812, the U.S. organized the Regiment of Light Dragoons. For the war, a second regiment was activated; that regiment was consolidated with the original regiment in 1814. The original regiment was consolidated with the Corps of Artillery in June 1815. The United States Dragoons was organized by an Act of Congress approved on 2 March 1833 after the disbandment of the Battalion of Mounted Rangers. The unit became the &quot;First Regiment of Dragoons&quot; when the Second Dragoons was raised in 1836. In 1861, they were re-designated as the 1st and 2nd Cavalry but did not change their role or equipment, although the traditional orange uniform braiding of the dragoons was replaced by the standard yellow of the Cavalry branch. This marked the official end of dragoons in the U.S. Army in name, although certain modern units trace their origins back to the historic dragoon regiments. In practice, all US cavalry assumed a dragoon-like role, frequently using carbines and pistols, in addition to their swords.

=== Russian Empire ===
Between 1881 and 1907, all Russian cavalry (other than Cossacks and Imperial Guard regiments) were designated as dragoons, reflecting an emphasis on the double ability of dismounted action as well as the new cavalry tactics in their training and a growing acceptance of the impracticality of employing historical cavalry tactics against modern firepower. Upon the reinstatement of Uhlan and Hussar Regiments in 1907 their training pattern, as well as that of the Cuirassiers of the Guard, remained unchanged until the collapse of the Russian Imperial Army.

=== Japan ===
In Japan, during the late 19th and early 20th century, dragoons were deployed in the same way as in other armies, but were dressed as hussars.

== 20th century ==
In the period before 1914, dragoon regiments still existed in the British and French armies, as well as the German, Russian, Austro-Hungarian, Canadian, Peruvian, Swiss, Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, and Spanish. Their uniforms varied greatly, lacking the characteristic features of hussar or lancer regiments. Uniforms bore occasional reminders of their mounted infantry origins: the 28 dragoon regiments of the Imperial German Army wore the infantry Pickelhaube or spiked helmet, while British dragoons wore scarlet tunics for full dress while hussars and all but one of the lancer regiments wore dark blue. In other respects however dragoons had adopted the same tactics, roles and equipment as other branches of the cavalry and the distinction had become simply one of traditional titles. Weaponry had ceased to have a historic connection, with both the French and German dragoon regiments carrying lances during the early stages of World War I.

The historic German, Russian and Austro-Hungarian dragoon regiments ceased to exist as distinct branches following the overthrow of the respective imperial regimes of these countries during 1917–18. The Spanish dragoons, which dated back to 1640, were reclassified as numbered cavalry regiments in 1931 as part of the army modernization policies of the Second Spanish Republic.

In 1914, at the outbreak of World War I, France maintained 32 regiments of dragoons. Armed with lances, sabres and carbines they were primarily intended to carry out reconnaissance and infantry flanking functions.


The Australian Light Horse were similar to 18th-century dragoon regiments in some respects, being mounted infantry which normally fought on foot, their horses&#x27; purpose being transportation. They served during the Second Boer War and World War I. The Australian 4th Light Horse Brigade became famous for the Battle of Beersheba in 1917 where they charged on horseback using rifle bayonets in hand, since neither sabres nor lances were part of their equipment. Later in the Palestine campaign Pattern 1908 cavalry swords were issued and used in the campaign leading to the fall of Damascus.

Probably the last use of real dragoons (infantry on horseback) in combat was made by the Portuguese Army in the war in Angola during the 1960s and 1970s. In 1966, the Portuguese created an experimental horse platoon to operate against the guerrillas in the high grass region of Eastern Angola, in which each soldier was armed with a G3 battle rifle for combat on foot and with a semi-automatic pistol to fire from horseback. The troops on horseback were able to operate in difficult terrain unsuited to motor vehicles and had the advantage of being able to control the area around them, with a clear view over the grass that foot troops did not have. Moreover, these unconventional troops created a psychological impact on an enemy that was not used to facing horse troops, and thus had no training or strategy to deal with them. The experimental horse platoon was so successful that its entire parent battalion was transformed from an armored reconnaissance unit to a three-squadron horse battalion known as the &quot;Dragoons of Angola&quot;. One of the typical operations carried out by the Dragoons of Angola, in cooperation with airmobile forces, consisted of the dragoons chasing the guerrillas and pushing them in one direction, with the airmobile troops being launched from helicopter in the enemy rear, trapping the enemy between the two forces.

=== Dragoner rank ===
Until 1918, &quot;Dragoner&quot; (en: dragoon) was the designation given to the lowest ranks in the dragoon regiments of the Austro-Hungarian and Imperial German armies. The &quot;Dragoner&quot; rank, together with all other private ranks of the different branch of service, belonged to the so-called &quot;Gemeine&quot; rank group.

==Modern dragoons==

=== Brazil ===

The guard of honour for the President of Brazil includes the 1st Guards Cavalry Regiment of the Brazilian Army, known as the &quot;Dragões da Independência&quot; (Independence Dragoons). The name was given in 1927 and refers to the fact that a detachment of dragoons escorted the Prince Royal of Portugal and Brazil, Pedro of Braganza, at the time when he declared the Brazilian independence from the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves on 7 September 1822.

The Independence Dragoons wear 19th-century dress uniforms similar to those of the earlier Imperial Honor Guard, which are used as the regimental full dress uniform since 1927. The uniform was designed by Debret, in white and red, with plumed bronze helmets. The colors and pattern were influenced by the Austrian dragoons of the period, as the Brazilian Empress consort was also an Austrian archduchess. The color of the plumes varies according to rank. The Independence Dragoons are armed with lances and sabres, the latter only for the officers and the colour guard.

The regiment was established in 1808 by the Prince Regent and future King of Portugal, John VI, with the duty of protecting the Portuguese royal family, which had sought refuge in Brazil during the Napoleonic wars. However dragoons had existed in Portugal since at least the early 18th century and, in 1719, units of this type of cavalry were sent to Brazil, initially to escort shipments of gold and diamonds and to guard the Viceroy who resided in Rio de Janeiro (1st Cavalry Regiment – Vice-Roy Guard Squadron). Later, they were also sent to the south to serve against the Spanish during frontier clashes. After the proclamation of the Brazilian independence, the title of the regiment was changed to that of the Imperial Honor Guard, with the role of protecting the Imperial Family. The Guard was later disbanded by Emperor Pedro II and would be recreated only later in the republican era.

At the time of the Republic proclamation in 1889, horse No. 6 of the Imperial Honor Guard was ridden by the officer making the declaration of the end of Imperial rule, Second lieutenant Eduardo José Barbosa. This is commemorated by the custom under which the horse having this number is used only by the commander of the modern regiment.

=== Canada ===

There are three dragoon regiments in the Canadian Army: The Royal Canadian Dragoons and two reserve regiments, the British Columbia Dragoons and the Saskatchewan Dragoons.

The Royal Canadian Dragoons is the senior Armoured regiment in the Canadian Army. The regiment was authorized in 1883 as the Cavalry School Corps, being redesignated as Canadian Dragoons in 1892, adding the Royal designation the next year. The RCD has a history of fighting dismounted, serving in the Second Boer War in South Africa as mounted infantry, fighting as infantry with the 1st Canadian Division in Flanders in 1915–1916 and spending the majority of the regiment&#x27;s service in the Italian Campaign 1944–1945 fighting dismounted. In 1994 when the regiment deployed to Bosnia as part of the United Nations Protection Force, B Squadron was employed as a mechanized infantry company. The current role of The Royal Canadian Dragoons is to provide Armour Reconnaissance support to 2 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group (2 CMBG) as well as C Squadron RCD in Gagetown which is a part of 2 CMBG and the RCD Regiment with Leopard 2A4 and 2A6 tanks.

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police were accorded the formal status of a regiment of dragoons in 1921. The modern RCMP does not retain any military status however.

=== Chile ===
Founded as the &quot;Dragones de la Reina&quot; (Queen&#x27;s Dragoons) in 1758 and later renamed the Dragoons of Chile in 1812, and then becoming the Carabineros de Chile in 1903. The Carabineros are the national police of Chile. The military counterpart, that of the 15th Reinforced Regiment &quot;Dragoons&quot; is now as of 2010 the 4th Armored Brigade &quot;Chorrillos&quot; based in Punta Arenas as the 6th Armored Cavalry Squadron &quot;Dragoons&quot;, and form part of the 5th Army Division.

=== Denmark ===
The Royal Danish Army includes amongst its historic regiments the Jutland Dragoon Regiment, which was raised in 1670.

=== France ===
The modern French Army retains three dragoon regiments from the thirty-two in existence at the beginning of World War I: the 2nd, which is a nuclear, biological and chemical protection regiment, the 5th, an experimental Combined arms regiment, and the 13th (Special Reconnaissance).

=== Lithuania ===
Beginning in the 17th century, the mercenary army of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania included dragoon units. In the middle of the 17th century there were 1,660 dragoons in an army totaling 8,000 men. By the 18th century there were four regiments of dragoons.

Lithuanian cavalrymen served in dragoon regiments of both the Russian and Prussian armies, after the Partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

Between 1920 and 1924, and again between 1935 and 1940, the Lithuanian Army included the Third Dragoon &quot;Iron Wolf&quot; Regiment. The dragoons were the equivalent of the present-day Volunteer Forces.

In modern Lithuania the Grand Duke Butigeidis Dragoon Battalion (&quot;Lithuanian: didžiojo kunigaikščio Butigeidžio dragūnų batalionas&quot;) is designated as dragoons, with a motorized infantry role.

=== Mexico ===
During the times of the Viceroyalty, regiments of dragoons (Dragon de cuera) were created to defend New Spain. They were mostly horsemen from the provinces. During and after the Mexican war of independence, dragons have played an important role in military conflicts within the country such as the Battle of Puebla during the French intervention, until the Mexican Revolution. One of the best-known military marches in Mexico is the Marcha Dragona (dragon march), the only one currently used by cavalry and motorized units during the parade on 16 September to commemorate Independence Day.

=== Norway ===
In the Norwegian Army during the early part of the 20th century, dragoons served in part as mounted troops, and in part on skis or bicycles (&quot;hjulryttere&quot;, meaning &quot;wheel-riders&quot;). Dragoons fought on horses, bicycles and skis against the German invasion in 1940. After World War II the dragoon regiments were reorganized as armoured reconnaissance units. &quot;Dragon&quot; is the rank of a compulsory service private cavalryman while enlisted (regular) cavalrymen have the same rank as infantrymen: &quot;Grenader&quot;.

=== Pakistan ===
The Armoured Regiment &quot;34 Lancers&quot; of Pakistan Army Armoured Corps is also known as &quot;Dragoons&quot;.

=== Peru ===
The &quot;Mariscal Domingo Nieto&quot; Cavalry Regiment Escort, named after Field Marshal Domingo Nieto, a former President of Peru, were the traditional Guard of the Government Palace until 5 March 1987 and its disbandment in that year. However, by Ministerial Resolution No 139-2012/DE/EP of 2 February 2012 the restoration of the Cavalry Regiment &quot;Marshal Domingo Nieto&quot; as the official escort of the President of the Republic of Peru was announced. The main mission of the reestablished regiment was to guarantee the security of the President of the Republic and of the Government Palace.

This regiment of dragoons was created in 1904 following the suggestion of a French military mission which undertook the reorganization of the Peruvian Army in 1896. The initial title of the unit was Cavalry Squadron &quot;President&#x27;s Escort&quot;. It was modelled on the French dragoons of the period. The unit was later renamed as the Cavalry Regiment &quot;President&#x27;s Escort&quot; before receiving its current title in 1949.

The Peruvian Dragoon Guard has throughout its existence worn French-style uniforms of black tunic and red breeches in winter and white coat and red breeches in summer, with red and white plumed bronze helmets with the coat of arms of Peru and golden or red epaulettes depending on rank. They retain their original armament of lances and sabres, until the 1980s rifles were used for dismounted drill.

At 13:00 hours every day, the main esplanade in front of the Government Palace of Perú fronting Lima&#x27;s Main Square serves as the stage for the changing of the guard, undertaken by members of the Presidential Life Guard Escort Dragoons, mounted or dismounted. While the dismounted changing is held on Mondays and Fridays, the mounted ceremony is held twice a month on a Sunday.

=== Portugal ===
The Portuguese Army still maintains two units which are descended from former regiments of dragoons. These are the 3rd Regiment of Cavalry (the former &quot;Olivença Dragoons&quot;) and the 6th Regiment of Cavalry (the former &quot;Chaves Dragoons&quot;). Both regiments are, presently, armoured units. The Portuguese Rapid Reaction Brigade&#x27;s Armoured Reconnaissance Squadron – a unit from the 3rd Regiment of Cavalry – is known as the &quot;Paratroopers Dragoons&quot;.

During the Portuguese Colonial War in the 1960s and the 1970s, the Portuguese Army created an experimental horse platoon, to combat the guerrillas in eastern Angola. This unit was soon augmented, becoming a group of three squadrons, known as the &quot;Angola Dragoons&quot;. The Angola Dragoons operated as mounted infantry – like the original dragoons – each soldier being armed with a pistol to fire when on horseback and with an automatic rifle, to use when dismounted. A unit of the same type was being created in Mozambique when the war ended in 1974.

=== Spain ===
The Spanish Army began the training of a dragoon corps in 1635 under the direction of Pedro de la Puente at Innsbruck. In 1640 the first dragoon &quot;tercio&quot; was created, equipped with arquebuses and maces. The number of dragoon tercios was increased to nine by the end of the XVII century: three garrisoned in Spain, another three in the Netherlands and the remainder in Milan.

The &quot;tercio&quot;s were converted into a Regimental system, beginning in 1704. Philip V created several additional dragoon regiments to perform the functions of a police corps in the New World. Notable amongst those units were the leather-clad &quot;dragones de cuera&quot;.

In 1803, the dragoon regiments were renamed as &quot;&quot;caballería ligera&quot; (light cavalry). By 1815, these units had been disbanded.

Spain recreated its dragoons in the late nineteenth century. Three Spanish dragoon regiments were still in existence in 1930.

=== Sweden ===
In the Swedish Army, dragoons comprise the Military Police and Military Police Rangers. They also form the 13th Battalion of the Life Guards, which is a military police unit. The 13th (Dragoons) Battalion have roots that go back as far as 1523, making it one of the world&#x27;s oldest military units still in service. Today, the only mounted units still retained by the Swedish Army are the two dragoons squadrons of the King&#x27;s Guards Battalion of the Life Guards. Horses are used for ceremonial purposes only, most often when the dragoons take part in the changing of the guards at The Royal Palace in Stockholm. &quot;Livdragon&quot; is the rank of a private cavalryman.

=== Switzerland ===
Mounted dragoons existed in the Swiss Armed Forces until the early 1970s, when they were converted into Armoured Grenadiers units. The &quot;Dragoner&quot;&quot; had to prove he was able to keep a horse at home before entering the army. At the end of basic training they had to buy a horse at a reduced price from the army and to take it home together with equipment, uniform and weapon. In the &quot;yearly repetition course&quot; the dragoons served with their horses, often riding from home to the meeting point.

The abolition of the dragoon units, believed to be the last non-ceremonial horse cavalry in Europe, was a contentious issue in Switzerland. On 5 December 1972 the Swiss &quot;National Council&quot; approved the measure by 91 votes, against 71 for retention.

=== United Kingdom ===
As of 2021, the British Army contains four regiments designated as dragoons: 1st The Queens Dragoon Guards, Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, the Royal Dragoon Guards, and the Light Dragoons. These perform a variety of reconnaissance and light support activities, including convoy protection, and operate the Jackal, the Coyote Reconnaissance Vehicle and the FV107 Scimitar light tank.

=== United States ===
The 1st and 2nd Battalion, 48th Infantry were mechanized infantry units assigned to the 3rd Armored Division (3AD) in West Germany during the Cold War. The unit crest of the 48th Infantry designated the unit as Dragoons, purely a traditional designation.

The 1st Dragoons was reformed in the Vietnam War era as the 1st Squadron, 1st U.S. Cavalry. It served in the Iraq War and remains as the oldest cavalry unit, as well as the most decorated one, in the U.S. Army. Today&#x27;s modern 1–1 Cavalry is a scout/attack unit, equipped with MRAPs, M3A3 Bradley CFVs, and Strykers.

Another modern United States Army unit, informally known as the 2nd Dragoons, is the 2nd Cavalry Regiment. This unit was originally organized as the Second Regiment of Dragoons in 1836 and was renamed the Second Cavalry Regiment in 1861, being redesignated as the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment in 1948. The regiment is currently equipped with the Stryker family of wheeled fighting vehicles and was redesignated as the 2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment in 2006. In 2011 the 2nd Dragoon regiment was redesignated as the 2nd Cavalry Regiment. The 2nd Cavalry Regiment has the distinction of being the longest continuously serving regiment in the United States Army.

The 113th Army Band at Fort Knox is also officially nicknamed as &quot;The Dragoons&quot;. This derives from its formation as the Band, First Regiment of Dragoons on 8 July 1840.

Company D, 3rd Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion of the United States Marine Corps, is nicknamed the &quot;Dragoons&quot;. Their combat history includes service in the Iraq War and the War in Afghanistan from 2002 to 2013.

<doc id="8768" wikidata="Q341663" url="?curid=8768" title="Dulcimer">
<text>The term dulcimer refers to two families of musical string instruments.

==Hammered dulcimers==
The word &quot;dulcimer&quot; originally referred to a trapezoidal zither similar to a psaltery whose many strings are struck by handheld &quot;hammers&quot;. Variants of this instrument are found in many cultures, including:
* Hammered dulcimer (England, Scotland, United States)
* Hackbrett (southern Germany, Austria, Switzerland)
* Tsymbaly (Ukraine), tsimbl (Ashkenazi Jewish), țambal (Romania) and cimbalom (Hungary) may refer to either a relatively small folk instrument or a larger classical instrument. The santouri (Greece) (called &quot;santur&quot; in the Ottoman Empire) is almost identical to the Jewish and Romanian folk instruments.
* Santur (Iran and Iraq)
* Santoor (northern India and Pakistan) is constructed and tuned differently from the santur of Iran and Iraq
* Khim (Cambodia, Laos, Thailand)
* Yangqin (China), Đàn tam thập lục (Vietnam), yanggeum (Korea)

==Appalachian dulcimer and derivatives==

In the Appalachian region of the U.S. in the nineteenth century, hammered dulcimers were rare. There, the word &quot;dulcimer&quot;, which was familiar from the King James Version of the Bible, was used to refer to a three or four stringed fretted instrument, generally played on the lap by strumming. 

Variants include:
* The original Appalachian dulcimer
* Various twentieth century derivatives, including
** Banjo dulcimer, with banjo-like resonating membrane
** Resonator dulcimer, with inset conical resonator
** Bowed dulcimer, teardrop-shaped and played upright with a bow
** Electric dulcimer, various types of dulcimer which use a pickup to amplify the sound

<doc id="8769" wikidata="Q617066" url="?curid=8769" title="Dutch West India Company">
<text>The Dutch West India Company () was a Dutch chartered company that was founded in 1621 and went defunct in 1792. Among its founders were Reynier Pauw, Willem Usselincx (1567–1647), and Jessé de Forest (1576–1624). On 3 June 1621, it was granted a charter for a trade monopoly in the Dutch West Indies by the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands and given jurisdiction over Dutch participation in the Atlantic slave trade, Brazil, the Caribbean, and North America.

The area where the company could operate consisted of West Africa (between the Tropic of Cancer and the Cape of Good Hope) and the Americas, which included the Pacific Ocean and ended east of the Maluku Islands, according to the Treaty of Tordesillas. The intended purpose of the charter was to eliminate competition, particularly Spanish or Portuguese, between the various trading posts established by the merchants. The company became instrumental in the largely ephemeral Dutch colonization of the Americas (including New Netherland) in the seventeenth century.

From 1624 to 1654, in the context of the Dutch–Portuguese War, the GWC held Portuguese territory in northeast Brazil, but they were ousted from Dutch Brazil following fierce resistance. After several reversals, the GWC reorganized and a new charter was granted in 1675, largely on the strength in the Atlantic slave trade. This &quot;new&quot; version lasted for more than a century, until after the Fourth Anglo–Dutch War, during which it lost most of its assets.

==Origins==

When the Dutch East India Company (VOC) was founded in 1602, some traders in Amsterdam did not agree with its monopolistic policies. With help from Petrus Plancius, a Dutch-Flemish astronomer, cartographer, and clergyman, they sought for a northeastern or northwestern access to Asia to circumvent the VOC monopoly. In 1609, English explorer Henry Hudson, in employment of the VOC, landed on the coast of New England and sailed up what is now known as the Hudson River in his quest for the Northwest Passage to Asia. However, he failed to find a passage. Consequently, in 1615, Isaac Le Maire and Samuel Blommaert, assisted by others, focused on finding a south-westerly route around South America&#x27;s Tierra del Fuego archipelago in order to circumvent the monopoly of the VOC.

One of the first sailors who focused on trade with Africa was Balthazar de Moucheron. The trade with Africa offered several possibilities to set up trading posts or factories, an important starting point for negotiations. It was Blommaert, however, who stated that, in 1600, eight companies sailed on the coast of Africa, competing with each other for the supply of copper, from the Kingdom of Loango. Pieter van den Broecke was employed by one of these companies. In 1612, a Dutch fortress was built in Mouree (present day Ghana), along the Dutch Gold Coast.

Trade with the Caribbean, for salt, sugar and tobacco, was hampered by Spain and delayed because of peace negotiations. Spain offered peace on condition that the Dutch Republic would withdraw from trading with Asia and America. Spain refused to sign the peace treaty if a West Indian Company would be established. At this time, the Dutch War of Independence (1568–1648) between Spain and the Dutch Republic was occurring. Grand Pensionary Johan van Oldenbarnevelt offered to suspend trade with the West Indies in exchange for the Twelve Years&#x27; Truce. He took the proposal of founding a West-India Company off table. The result was that, during a few years, the Dutch sailed under a foreign flag to South America. However, ten years later, Stadtholder Maurice of Orange, proposed to continue the war with Spain, but also to distract attention from Spain to the Republic. In 1619, his opponent Johan van Oldenbarnevelt was beheaded, and when in April 1621 the truce expired, the West Indian Company could be established.

The West India Company received its charter from the States-General in June 1621, granting it a 24-year monopoly on trade and colonization that included the American coast between Newfoundland and the Straits of Magellan. One of the promotors was Reynier Pauw, who went on to appoint two of his sons as the first managers in 1621; both Pieter and Michiel Reyniersz Pauw were in place for fifteen years. Reynier Pauw II, Cornelis Bicker, and Samuel Blommaert were appointed in 1622.

==Organization==

The &quot;Dutch West India Company&quot; was organized similarly to the Dutch East India Company (VOC). Like the VOC, the GWC had five offices, called chambers (&quot;kamers&quot;), in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Hoorn, Middelburg and Groningen, of which the chambers in Amsterdam and Middelburg contributed most to the company. The board consisted of 19 members, known as the Heeren XIX (the Nineteen Gentlemen, as opposed to the Heeren XVII who controlled the East India company.) The institutional structure of the GWC followed the federal structure, which entailed extensive discussion for any decision, with regional representation: 8 from Amsterdam; 4 from Zeeland, 2 each from the Northern Quarter (Hoorn and Enkhuizen), the Maas (Rotterdam, Delft, and Dordrecht), the region of Groningen, and one representative from the States General. Each region had its own chamber and board of directors. The validity of the charter was set at 24 years.

Only in 1623 was funding arranged, after several bidders were put under pressure. The States General of the Netherlands and the VOC pledged one million guilders in the form of capital and subsidy. Although Iberian writers said that crypto-Jews or Marranos played an important role in the formation of both the VOC and the GWC, research has shown that initially they played a minor role, but expanded during the period of the Dutch in Brazil. Emigrant Calvinists from the Spanish Netherlands did make significant investments in the GWC. Investors did not rush to put their money in the company in 1621, but the States-General urged municipalities and other institutions to invest. Explanations for the slow investment by individuals were that shareholders had &quot;no control over the directors&#x27; policy and the handling of ordinary investors&#x27; money,&quot; that it was a &quot;racket&quot; to provide &quot;cushy posts for the directors and their relatives, at the expense of ordinary shareholders&quot;. The VOC directors invested money in the GWC, without consulting their shareholders, causing dissent among a number of shareholders. In order to attract foreign shareholders, the GWC offered equal standing to foreign investors with Dutch, resulting in shareholders from France, Switzerland, and Venice. A translation of the original 1621 charter appeared in English, &quot;Orders and Articles granted by the High and Mightie Lords the States General of the United Provinces concerning the erecting of a West-Indies Companie, Anno Dom. MDCXII&quot;. by 1623, the capital for the GWC at 2.8 million florins was not as great the VOC&#x27;s original capitalization of 6.5 million, but it was still a substantial sum. The GWC had 15 ships to carry trade and plied the west African coast and Brazil.

Unlike the VOC, the GWC had no right to deploy military troops. When the Twelve Years&#x27; Truce in 1621 was over, the Republic had a free hand to re-wage war with Spain. A &quot;Groot Desseyn&quot; (&quot;grand design&quot;) was devised to seize the Portuguese colonies in Africa and the Americas, so as to dominate the sugar and slave trade. When this plan failed, privateering became one of the major goals within the GWC. The arming of merchant ships with guns and soldiers to defend themselves against Spanish ships was of great importance. On almost all ships in 1623, 40 to 50 soldiers were stationed, possibly to assist in the hijacking of enemy ships. It is unclear whether the first expedition was the expedition by Jacques l&#x27;Hermite to the coast of Chile, Peru and Bolivia, set up by Stadtholder Maurice with the support of the States General and the VOC.

The company was initially a dismal failure, in terms of its expensive early projects, and its directors shifted emphasis from conquest of territory to pursue plunder of shipping. The most spectacular success for the GWC was Piet Heyn&#x27;s seizure of the Spanish silver fleet, which carried silver from Spanish colonies to Spain. He had also seized a consignment of sugar from Brazil and a galleon from Honduras with cacao, indigo, and other valuable goods. Privateering was its most profitable activity in the late 1620s. Despite Heyn&#x27;s success at plunder, the company&#x27;s directors realized that it was not a basis to build long-term profit, leading them to renew their attempts to seize Iberian territory in the Americas. They decided their target was Brazil. (Recapture of Bahia)

===Involvement in Brazil===

There were conflicts between directors from different areas of The Netherlands, with Amsterdam less supportive of the company. Non-maritime cities, including Haarlem, Leiden, and Gouda, along with Enkhuizen and Hoorn were enthusiastic about seizing territory. They sent a fleet to Brazil, capturing Olinda and Pernambuco in 1630 in their initial foray to create a Dutch Brazil, but could not hold them due to a strong Portuguese resistance. Company ships continued privateering in the Caribbean, as well seizing vital land resources, particularly salt pans. The company&#x27;s general lack of success saw their shares plummet and the Dutch and The Spanish renewed truce talks in 1633.

In 1629, the GWC gave permission to a number of investors in New Netherlands to found patroonships, enabled by the Charter of Freedoms and Exemptions which was ratified by the Dutch States General on 7 June 1629. The patroonships were created to help populate the colony, by providing investors grants providing land for approximately 50 people &quot;upwards of 15 years old&quot;, per grant, mainly in the region of New Netherland. Patroon investors could expand the size of their land grants as large as 4 miles, &quot;along the shore or along one bank of a navigable river...&quot; Rensselaerswyck was the most successful Dutch West India Company patroonship.

The New Netherland area, which included New Amsterdam, covered parts of present-day New York, Connecticut, Delaware, and New Jersey, with Manhattan and Fort Amsterdam serving as the first capital. Other settlements were established on the Netherlands Antilles, and in South America, in Dutch Brazil, Suriname and Guyana. In Africa, posts were established on the Gold Coast (now Ghana), the Slave Coast (now Benin), and briefly in Dutch Loango-Angola. It was a neo-feudal system, where patrons were permitted considerable powers to control the overseas colony. In the Americas, fur (North America) and sugar (South America) were the most important trade goods, while African settlements traded the enslaved (mainly destined for the plantations on the Antilles and Suriname), gold, copper and ivory.

===Decline===


In North America, the settlers Albert Burgh, Samuel Blommaert, Samuel Godijn, Johannes de Laet had little success with populating the colony of New Netherland, and to defend themselves against local Amerindians. Only Kiliaen Van Rensselaer managed to maintain his settlement in the north along the Hudson. Blommaert secretly tried to secure his interests with the founding of the colony of New Sweden on behalf of Sweden on the Delaware in the south. The main focus of the GWC now went to Brazil.

The West India Company managed to conquer parts of Brazil from Portugal in 1630. That same year, the colony of New Holland was founded, with a capital in Mauritsstad (present-day Recife). In the meantime, the war demanded so many of its forces that the company had to operate under a permanent threat of bankruptcy. In fact, the GWC went bankrupt in 1636 and all attempts at rehabilitation were doomed to failure. In 1636, the Dutch West India Company took possession of St. Eustatius, Sint Maarten, and Saba which all fell under Dutch control. A commander was stationed on St. Eustatius to govern all three islands by 1678.

Because of the ongoing war in Brazil, the situation for the GWC in 1645, at the end of the charter, was very bad. An attempt to compensate the losses of the GWC with the profits of the VOC failed because the directors of the VOC did not want to. In 1645, the main participants in the GWC were members of the Trip family. Merging the two companies was not feasible. Amsterdam was not willing to help out, because it had too much interest in peace and healthy trade relations with Portugal. This indifferent attitude of Amsterdam was the main cause of the slow, half-hearted policy, which would eventually lead to losing the colony. In 1647, the company made a restart using 1.5 million guilders, capital of the VOC. The States General took responsibility for the warfare in Brazil.

===Restart===
Due to the Peace of Westphalia, the attacks on Spanish shipping were forbidden to the GWC. The Portuguese succeeded in the recapture of Angola. Many merchants from Amsterdam and Zeeland decided to work with marine and merchants from the Holy Roman Empire, Denmark–Norway, England and other European countries. In 1649, a competing Swedish Africa Company was founded; the GWC obtained a monopoly on gold and enslaved Africans with the kingdom of Accra (present-day Ghana). Elmina Castle was the main port. In 1654 the Dutch were thrown out of Brazil after the recapture of Recife. In 1656, the company signed the Treaty of Butre (Dutch Gold Coast). In 1659 the Danish West India Company, an undercover Dutch enterprise, was founded. (In 1660 the Royal African Company was founded, led by the Duke of York.)

In 1662, the GWC obtained several &quot;asiento&quot; subcontracts with the Spanish Crown, under which the Dutch were allowed to deliver 24,000 enslaved Africans. The GWC made Curaçao a centre of the Atlantic slave trade, bringing slaves from West Africa to the island, before selling them elsewhere in the Caribbean and Spanish Main. The influence of the GWC in Africa was threatened during the Second and Third Anglo–Dutch Wars, but English efforts to displace the Dutch from the region ultimately proved unsuccessful.

The first West India Company suffered a long agony, and its end in 1674 was painless. The reason that the GWC could drag on for 27 years seems to have been its valuable West African possessions, due to its slaves. 

==Second West India Company==
When the GWC could not repay its debts in 1674, the company was dissolved. But due to continued high demand for trade between West Africa and the Dutch colonies in the Americas (mainly slave trade), a second West India Company known as the New West India Company was chartered that same year. This new company controlled the same trade area as the first but privateering was no longer an asset. All ships, fortresses, etc. were taken over by the new company. Nobody was fired, but the number of directors was reduced from 19 to 10, and the number of governors from 74 to 50. By 1679, the new GWC had slightly more than guilders which was largely supplied by the Amsterdam Chamber. In 1687, due to the Asiento possessed by Balthasar Coymans, the company paid the highest dividend.

From 1694 until 1700, the GWC waged a long conflict against the Eguafo Kingdom along the Gold Coast, present-day Ghana. The Komenda Wars drew in significant numbers of neighbouring African kingdoms and led to the replacement of the gold trade with enslaved Africans. Calabar was the largest slave trading place in Africa. Sint Eustatius (Dutch Caribbean) became the most profitable asset of the GWC and a transit point for enslaved Africans in the transatlantic slave trade. After 1734 the GWC was primarily engaged in facilitating the slave trade, and only responsible for the supply of slaves until 1738. The company then began to outsource the slave trade and left it to private enterprise, especially in Middelburg, Zeeland.

In 1750 Thomas Hope was elected in the board of the company, but preferred the Heren XVII after two years; he was succeeded by Nicolaas Geelvinck in 1764. In 1773, when drinking coffee and cocoa was popular almost everywhere, the family Van Aerssen van Sommelsdijck sold its property in the colony of Surinam. The GWC participated in a bigger share together with the Society of Suriname. Many planters in Surinam and the Caribbean came into financial trouble because of the mortgages (Crisis of 1772); the demand for slaves dropped. In 1775, the last slave ship entered the port of Willemstad. From 1780 on the company made losses and paid no dividend.

After the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War, it became apparent that the GWC was no longer capable of defending its own colonies, as Sint Eustatius, Berbice, Essequibo, Demerara, and some forts on the Dutch Gold Coast were rapidly taken by the British. In 1791 it was decided not to renew the patent to the GWC and to dissolve the company. All stocks were sold and territories previously held by the GWC came under the rule of the States General of the Netherlands. A directorate Ad-Interim took over the administration. A Council of Colonies was established as administrator over the affairs of the GWC until 1795. Around 1800 there was an attempt to create a third West India Company, but without success.

<doc id="8771" wikidata="Q32706" url="?curid=8771" title="Dyula language">
<text>Dyula (or Jula, Dioula, &quot;Julakan&quot; ߖߎ߬ߟߊ߬ߞߊ߲) is a language of the Mande language family spoken mainly in Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast and Mali, and also in some other countries, including Ghana, Guinea and Guinea-Bissau. It is one of the Manding languages and is most closely related to Bambara, being mutually intelligible with Bambara as well as Malinke. It is a trade language in West Africa and is spoken by millions of people, either as a first or second language. Similar to the other Mande languages, it uses tones. It may be written in the Latin, Arabic or N&#x27;Ko scripts.

== History ==
Historically, Dyula (&quot;jula&quot; in the language) was not an ethonym, but rather a Manding language label literally meaning &#x27;trader&#x27;. The term used to distinguish Muslim traders from the non-Muslim population living in the same area, mainly Senufo agricultors. It then became an exonym for Manding-speaking traders such as the Bambara or the Mandinka and their languages. At the same time, however, a process of ethnogenesis across the centuries led to some communities in modern towns like Bobo-Dioulasso, Odienné and Kong adopting the label as one of their ethnic identity. These communities speak varieties of Dyula with common traits that distinguish it from the lingua franca form of Jula that one hears in markets across much of Burkina Faso and Côte d&#x27;Ivoire.

Later, the term was also used for a simplified version of Bambara, which comes from Mali, mixed with elements of Maninka. It became a widely used lingua franca. Native speakers of Manding in the Ivory Coast use the pejorative term &#x27;Tagbusikan&#x27; to refer to this simplified language, while they called their own language &#x27;Konyakakan&#x27;, &#x27;Odiennekakan&#x27; or &#x27;Maukakan&#x27;. The influx of millions of migrant workers from the Sahel further boostered the use of Dyula in the Ivory Coast due to the need of a lingua franca. Many Burkinabe learned Dyula while staying in the Ivory Coast and further disseminated it back home. Today, Dyula is used to at least some extent by 61% of the population of the Ivory Coast and by about 35% of the Burkinabe (mainly those living in the southern or western part of the country).

== Phonology ==

=== Consonants ===
=== Vowels ===

The seven vowel sounds may also be either lengthened or nasalized .

==Writing systems==

=== N&#x27;Ko alphabet ===
The N&#x27;Ko script is an indigenous writing system for the Manding language continuum, invented in 1949 by Solomana Kanté, a Guinean educator. Today, the script has been digitised as part of Unicode, which allows it to be used easily online, but the lack of funding and the official status of French means that use of this alphabet largely happens outside of formal education and is not systematically used on street signs, etc.

=== Latin alphabet and orthography ===
Dioula orthography is regulated in Burkina Faso by the Dioula Sub-Commission of the National Commission for Languages. On 15 July 1971, the National Sub-Commission for Dioula was created and on 16 July 1971, it began a study in order to set the Dioula alphabet. An alphabet was published on 27 July 1973 and gained official status on 2 February 1979. Some letters were added later, for borrowed words, and others were replaced: by , and by .

In Burkina Faso, the Dioula alphabet is made up of 28 letters each representing a single phoneme. In the orthography, long vowels are represented by doubled letters; thus, /e/ is written and /eː/, . The nasalisation of a vowel is written followed by an n; for example, /ẽ/ is written .

The notation of tones was recommended in 1973, but in practice they are not written. The transcription guide published in 2003 does not reiterate this recommendation. Tones are noted solely in lexicographical works. However, to avoid ambiguity, tone marking is obligatory in certain cases.

For example:

* &quot;he/she&quot; (third person singular pronoun)
* &quot;you&quot; (second person plural pronoun)

== Use in media ==
Dioula can be heard spoken in the 2004 film &quot;Night of Truth&quot;, directed by Fanta Régina Nacro, Burkina Faso&#x27;s first female director.

<text>Desiderio Alberto Arnaz y de Acha III (March 2, 1917 – December 2, 1986), known as Desi Arnaz, was a Cuban-American actor, musician, producer, and bandleader. He played Ricky Ricardo on the American television sitcom &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, in which he co-starred with his wife Lucille Ball. Arnaz and Ball are credited as the innovators of the syndicated rerun, which they pioneered with the &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; series.

Arnaz and Lucille Ball co-founded and ran the television production company Desilu Productions, originally to market &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; to television networks. After &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; ended, Arnaz went on to produce several other television series, at first with Desilu Productions, and later independently, including &quot;The Ann Sothern Show&quot; and &quot;The Untouchables&quot;. He was also the bandleader of his Latin group, the Desi Arnaz Orchestra. He was known for playing conga drums and popularized the conga line in the United States.

==Early life==
Arnaz was born in Santiago de Cuba, Cuba, to Desiderio Alberto Arnaz y de Alberni II (March 8, 1894 – May 31, 1973) and Dolores &quot;Lolita&quot; de Acha y de Socias (April 2, 1896 – October 24, 1988). His father was Santiago&#x27;s youngest mayor and also served in the Cuban House of Representatives. His maternal grandfather was Alberto de Acha, an executive at rum producer Bacardi &amp; Co.

A descendant of Cuban nobility, Arnaz was a great-great-great-grandson of José Joaquín, a mayor of Santiago de Cuba. The Cuban Revolution of 1933 forced Arnaz and his family to lose everything and flee Cuba. A mob attacked and destroyed the family&#x27;s houses, property, and livestock. Arnaz narrowly escaped the attack because he was able to hop in a car driving away. His father, Alberto Arnaz, was jailed and all of his property was confiscated. He was released after six months when his father-in-law, Alberto de Acha, intervened on his behalf.

The family then fled to Miami, where Desi attended high school; his classmates included Albert &#x27;Sonny&#x27; Capone, only child of Chicago mobster Al Capone. Arnaz&#x27; family came to the U.S. with no money and he had to live with his father in a garage that was infested with rats and roaches. In the summer of 1934, he attended Saint Leo Prep (near Tampa) to improve his English. His first jobs included working at Woolworth&#x27;s and cleaning canary cages in Miami. He then went into the tile business with his father before turning to show business full time.

==Professional career==
===Musician and actor===
After finishing high school, Arnaz joined a band, the Siboney Septet, and began making a name for himself in Miami. Xavier Cugat, after seeing Arnaz perform, hired him for his touring orchestra, playing the conga drum and singing. Becoming a star attraction encouraged him to start his own band, the Desi Arnaz Orchestra.

Arnaz and his orchestra became a hit in New York City&#x27;s club scene, including a club named La Conga, where he is credited with introducing the concept of conga line dancing to the United States.

He came to the attention of Rodgers and Hart who, in 1939, cast him in their Broadway musical &quot;Too Many Girls&quot;. The show was a hit and RKO Pictures bought the movie rights.

Arnaz went to Hollywood the next year to appear in the show&#x27;s movie version at RKO, which also starred Lucille Ball. Arnaz and Ball fell in love during the film&#x27;s production and eloped on November 30, 1940.

Arnaz appeared in several movies in the 1940s such as &quot;Bataan&quot;, starring Robert Taylor (1943). His portrayal of Felix Ramirez, the jive-loving California National Guardsman, was described by &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Bosley Crowther as one of several supporting players who were &quot;convincing in soldier roles&quot;.

===Military service===
On April 27, 1943, Arnaz received his draft notice. However, Arnaz was disqualified from overseas service due to hypertension and knee injuries, which caused him pain with prolonged physical exertion, according to his military physical examination. He had injured his left knee prior to his enlistment and injured his right knee soon after enlisting on May 23, 1943, during a baseball game at Camp Arlington. He completed his recruit training, but was classified for limited service in the United States Army during World War II.

He was assigned to direct United Service Organization (USO) programs at the Birmingham General Army Hospital in the San Fernando Valley. It was his responsibility to keep injured soldiers entertained while they recovered in the hospital. Thanks to his Hollywood connections, Arnaz was able to bring celebrities to visit the hospital and boost morale of the soldiers. For example, upon discovering the first thing the wounded soldiers requested was a glass of cold milk, he arranged for movie starlets to meet them and pour the milk for them.

Arnaz served two years, seven months and four days. His primary unit was the 9th Service Command, Army Service Forces. For his service during World War II, he was awarded the Army Good Conduct Medal, the American Campaign Medal, and the World War II Victory Medal.

Arnaz was discharged as a staff sergeant on September 30, 1945.

===Career post-military===
On December 1, 1945, Arnaz formed another orchestra, which was successful in live appearances and recordings. He sang for troops in Birmingham Hospital with John Macchia and hired his childhood friend Marco Rizo to play piano and arrange for the orchestra. For the 1946–47 season, Arnaz was the bandleader, conducting his Desi Arnaz Orchestra, on Bob Hope&#x27;s radio show (&quot;The Pepsodent Show&quot;) on NBC.

In 1951, Arnaz was given a game show on CBS Radio, &quot;Your Tropical Trip&quot; to entice Arnaz and Ball to stay at CBS over a competing offer from NBC, and to keep Arnaz and his band employed and in Hollywood, rather than touring. The musical game show, hosted by Arnaz and featuring Arnaz&#x27;s orchestra, had audience members competing for a Caribbean vacation. The program aired from January 1951 until September, shortly before the premiere of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; in October.

When he became successful in television, he kept the orchestra on his payroll, and Rizo arranged and orchestrated the music for &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;.

===&quot;I Love Lucy&quot;===

On October 15, 1951, Arnaz co-starred in the premiere of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, in which he played a fictionalized version of himself, Cuban orchestra leader Enrique &quot;Ricky&quot; Ricardo. His co-star was his real-life wife, Lucille Ball, who played Ricky&#x27;s wife, Lucy. Television executives had been pursuing Ball to adapt her very popular radio series &quot;My Favorite Husband&quot; for television. Ball insisted on Arnaz playing her on-air spouse so the two would be able to spend more time together. CBS wanted Ball&#x27;s &quot;Husband&quot; co-star Richard Denning.

The original premise was for the couple to portray Lucy and Larry Lopez, a successful show business couple whose glamorous careers interfered with their efforts to maintain a normal marriage. Market research indicated, however, that this scenario would not be popular, so Jess Oppenheimer changed it to make Ricky Ricardo a struggling young orchestra leader and Lucy an ordinary housewife who had show business fantasies but no talent. The character name &quot;Larry Lopez&quot; was dropped because of a real-life bandleader named Vincent Lopez, and was replaced with &quot;Ricky Ricardo&quot;. The name was inspired by Henry Richard, a family friend and the brother of P.C. Richard of P.C. Richard &amp; Son. This name translates to Enrique Ricardo. Ricky often appeared at, and later owned, the Tropicana Club, which under his ownership he renamed Club Babalu.

Initially, the idea of having Ball and the distinctly Latin American Arnaz portray a married couple encountered resistance as they were told that Desi&#x27;s Cuban accent and Latin style would not be agreeable to American viewers. The couple overcame these objections, however, by touring together, during the summer of 1950, in a live vaudeville act they developed with the help of Spanish clown Pepito Pérez, together with Ball&#x27;s radio show writers. Much of the material from their vaudeville act, including Lucy&#x27;s memorable seal routine, was used in the pilot episode of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;. Segments of the pilot were recreated in the sixth episode of the show&#x27;s first season. During his time on the show, Arnaz and Ball became TV&#x27;s most successful entrepreneurs.

=== Desilu Productions ===
With Ball, Arnaz founded Desilu Productions in 1950, initially to produce the vaudeville-style touring act that led to &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;. At that time, most television programs were broadcast live, and as the largest markets were in New York, the rest of the country received only kinescope images. Karl Freund, Arnaz&#x27;s cameraman, and even Arnaz himself have been credited with the development of the multiple-camera setup production style using adjacent sets in front of a live audience that became the standard for subsequent situation comedies. The use of film enabled every station around the country to broadcast high-quality images of the show. Arnaz was told that it would be impossible to allow an audience onto a sound stage, but he worked with Freund to design a set that would accommodate an audience, allow filming, and adhere to fire and safety codes. Due to the expense of 35mm film, Arnaz and Ball agreed to salary cuts. In return, they retained the rights to the films. This was the basis for their invention of re-runs and syndicating TV shows (a huge source of new revenue).

In addition to &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, he executive produced &quot;The Ann Sothern Show&quot; and &quot;Those Whiting Girls&quot; (starring Margaret Whiting and Barbara Whiting), and was involved in several other series such as &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, &quot;Whirlybirds&quot;, and &quot;Sheriff of Cochise&quot; / &quot;United States Marshal&quot;. While he was producing &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, Arnaz was allegedly the target of a mafia murder plot, which was later called off, due to the show&#x27;s negative publicity of gangsters. These allegations were made in the 1980s by Jimmy Fratianno in his book, &quot;The Last Mafioso&quot;, although they were rejected by Arnaz. He also produced the feature film &quot;Forever, Darling&quot; (1956), in which he and Ball starred.

The original Desilu company continued long after Arnaz&#x27;s divorce from Ball and her subsequent marriage to Gary Morton. Desilu continued to produce its own programs in addition to providing facilities to other producers. In 1962, Arnaz sold his share of Desilu to Ball and formed his own production company after their divorce. With the newly formed Desi Arnaz Productions, he made &quot;The Mothers-In-Law&quot; (at Desilu) for United Artists Television and NBC. This sitcom ran for two seasons from 1967 to 1969. During its two-year run, Arnaz made four guest appearances as a Spanish matador, Señor Delgado.

Arnaz&#x27;s company was succeeded-in-interest by the company now known as Desilu, Too. Desilu, Too and Lucille Ball Productions worked hand-in-hand with MPI Home Video in the home video reissues of the Ball/Arnaz material not owned by CBS (successor-in-interest to Paramount Television, which in turn succeeded the original Desilu company). This material included &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot; and &quot;The Mothers-In-Law&quot;, as well as many programs and specials Ball and Arnaz made independently of each other.

===Later career===
In the 1970s, Arnaz co-hosted a week of shows with daytime host and producer Mike Douglas. Vivian Vance appeared as a guest. Arnaz also headlined a &quot;Kraft Music Hall&quot; special on NBC that featured his two children, with a brief appearance by Vance. Arnaz suffered a severe attack of diverticulitis in 1971, which required an operation and several years of recovery. He worked with Universal Studios for two years working on development deals for two shows that eventually fell through, &quot;Dr. Domingo&quot; (the character did appear on one episode of &quot;Ironside&quot;) and &quot;Chairman of the Board&quot; starring Elke Sommer. Arnaz moved on to work on his autobiography for two years.

To promote his autobiography, &quot;A Book&quot;, on February 21, 1976, Arnaz served as a guest host on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, with his son, Desi, Jr., also appearing. The program contained spoofs of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; and &quot;The Untouchables&quot;. The spoofs of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; were supposed to be earlier concepts of the show that never made it on the air, such as &quot;I Love Louie&quot;, where Desi lived with Louis Armstrong. He read Lewis Carroll&#x27;s poem &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; in a heavy Cuban accent (he pronounced it &quot;Habberwocky&quot;). Desi Jr., played the drums and, supported by the &quot;SNL&quot; band, Desi sang both &quot;Babalú&quot; and another favorite from his dance band days, &quot;Cuban Pete&quot;; the arrangements were similar to the ones used on &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;. He ended the broadcast by leading the entire cast in a conga line through the &quot;SNL&quot; studio.

In 1976, CBS paid tribute to Lucille Ball with the two-hour special &quot;CBS Salutes Lucy: The First 25 Years.&quot; Both Ball and Arnaz appeared on the screen for the special, which is the first time they appeared together in 16 years since their divorce.

When asked about returning to television in a 1976 newspaper article, Arnaz said, &quot;People ask me to go back on TV but the thin&#x27; is, it&#x27;s too tough competing with the Ricky Ricardo of 20 years ago. He looks a lot better than I do.&quot; Arnaz made a guest appearance on the TV series &quot;Alice&quot;, in 1978 starring Linda Lavin and produced by &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; co-creators Madelyn Pugh (Madelyn Davis) and Bob Carroll, Jr. His last acting role was as Mayor Leon Quiñones in the 1982 film, &quot;The Escape Artist&quot;.

Arnaz owned the in Palm Desert, CA. He also taught classes at San Diego State University in studio production and acting for television.

==Personal life==

=== Beliefs ===
Arnaz and Ball decided that &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; would maintain what Arnaz termed &quot;basic good taste&quot; and were therefore determined to avoid ethnic jokes, as well as humor based on physical handicaps or mental disabilities. Arnaz recalled that the only exception consisted of making fun of Ricky Ricardo&#x27;s accent; even these jokes worked only when Lucy, as his wife, did the mimicking.

Arnaz was a lifelong Catholic.

===Politics===
A lifelong Republican, Arnaz was deeply patriotic about the United States. In his memoirs, he wrote that he knew of no other country in the world where &quot;a sixteen-year-old kid, broke and unable to speak the language&quot; could achieve the successes that he had. He was a supporter of Richard Nixon and member of the Spanish-Speaking Committee for the Re-Election of the President in 1972. Nixon appointed Arnaz as the U.S. roving ambassador to Latin America in the early 1970s. He was a supporter of Ronald Reagan and spoke at campaign rallies, such as one hosted by the National Republican Hispanic Assembly in 1980. He was an advocate for the Hispanic community, encouraging them to take the 1980 census to increase federal funding for their communities.

=== Marriages ===

Arnaz and Lucille Ball were married on November 30, 1940. Their marriage was always turbulent. Convinced that Arnaz was being unfaithful to her, along with him coming home drunk several times, Ball filed for divorce in September 1944. The interlocutory decree became final in October 1944, but because they had spent the night together the day before, California state law at the time had declared it null and void. Arnaz and Ball subsequently had two children, actors Lucie Arnaz (born 1951) and Desi Arnaz Jr. (born 1953).

Hollywood procurer of prostitutes Scotty Bowers claimed in his memoir &quot;Full Service&quot; that he had procured as many as two to three prostitutes per week for Arnaz, each of whom was paid 200 dollars, as opposed to the usual 20. Lucille Ball confronted Bowers about this and publicly slapped him in the face, yelling &quot;You! Stop pimping for my husband!&quot;

Arnaz&#x27;s marriage with Ball began to collapse under the strain of his growing problems with alcohol, gambling, and infidelity. According to his memoir, the combined pressures of managing the production company, as well as supervising its day-to-day operations, had greatly worsened as the company grew much larger, and he felt compelled to seek outlets to alleviate the stress. Arnaz also suffered from diverticulitis. Ball divorced him on March 2, 1960, which was coincidentally his birthday. When Ball returned to weekly television, she and Arnaz worked out an agreement regarding Desilu, wherein she bought him out.

Edith Mack Hirsch (née McSkimming) was Arnaz&#x27;s second wife. After the two married on March 2, 1963 (Arnaz&#x27;s 46th birthday), he greatly reduced his show business activities. The two were married for 22 years until Edith died from cancer on March 23, 1985.

Although Arnaz and Ball both married other spouses after their divorce in 1960, they remained friends and grew closer in his final decade. For Lucy&#x27;s appearance at the Kennedy Center Honors in 1986, Arnaz had written a statement. Read by Robert Stack as a posthumous statement, Arnaz wrote, &quot;P.S. I Love Lucy was never just a title.&quot; Family home video later aired on television showed Ball and Arnaz playing together with their grandson Simon shortly before Arnaz&#x27;s death.

=== Health ===
Arnaz suffered from knee injuries as a young man shortly before and during his military service in World War II. The pain was troublesome enough that he was disqualified from serving overseas. In the late 1960s, he was seriously injured in an accident when the floor collapsed and he was impaled by a tree stump in his home in Baja California. An operation saved his life, although his health was never the same after the incident. Throughout his life he periodically had to seek medical treatment for diverticulitis and intestinal issues, sometimes requiring hospitalization.

After his second wife Edith&#x27;s death in 1985, Arnaz was persuaded by his children to seek treatment for his decades-long alcohol addiction, which by then had seriously damaged his health. Lucie Arnaz described her pride at attending a treatment meeting with her father where he stood up and said &quot;I&#x27;m Desi, and I&#x27;m an alcoholic&quot;.

=== Arrests ===
Arnaz had a few run-ins with the law. He was arrested in 1959 on an intoxication charge while he was walking Hollywood Blvd. In 1966, he was arrested and charged with assault with a deadly weapon after an altercation with youth parking in front of his house. Two young men were allegedly partying nearby and harassing his then-15-year-old daughter Lucie and her friend. Arnaz confronted them, threatened to shoot their tires and cars, and then fired two shots that went into the ground. He spent three hours at the San Diego jail and was released on $1,100 bail.

==Later life==

Desi Arnaz spent his retirement doing activities he enjoyed including sailing his yacht (he was a skilled yachtsman since childhood), fishing, and cooking Cuban dishes. He suffered from numerous health issues later in life. He contributed to charitable and nonprofit organizations, including San Diego State University. He was active in politics and made occasional public appearances. He was the guest of honor at the Carnival Miami in March 1982 where he performed with his children, Lucie and Desi Jr., in front of a crowd of 35,000.

Arnaz was known to be very loving to his grandchildren.

===Thoroughbred racing===
Arnaz and his second wife eventually moved to Del Mar, California where he lived the rest of his life in semi-retirement. He owned a horse-breeding farm in Corona, California and raced Thoroughbreds. The Desi Arnaz Stakes at Del Mar Racetrack is named in his honor.

==Death==
Arnaz was a regular smoker for much of his life and often smoked cigarettes on the set of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;. He smoked cigars until he was in his sixties. Arnaz was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1986 and underwent treatment. Lucille Ball visited him during this time in the hospital and the two watched VHS tapes of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;. His daughter Lucie was by his side constantly during his final days.

On November 30, 1986, Ball called him. They talked for a short time due to Arnaz&#x27;s state of health, as he had barely spoken to anyone and had not eaten for three days. According to Lucie, her mother simply said &quot;I love you. I love you. Desi, I love you,&quot; repeating the words over the phone. Arnaz finished the conversation by answering &quot;I love you, too, honey. Good luck with your show.&quot; Lucie hadn&#x27;t realized the solemnity of this last time, not until she checked her diary to notice the date had been the 46th anniversary of Ball and Arnaz&#x27;s wedding.

He died two days later on December 2, 1986, at the age of 69, just 3 years before Lucy&#x27;s death. Arnaz was cremated and his ashes were scattered at Sea of Cortés in Mexico. Ball was one of hundreds to attend Arnaz&#x27;s funeral, which was held at St. James Roman Catholic Church in San Diego County, California.
His death came just five days before Lucille Ball received the Kennedy Center Honors. His mother outlived him by almost two years.

==Legacy==

Desi Arnaz has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: one at 6301 Hollywood Boulevard for contributions to motion pictures and one at 6250 Hollywood Boulevard for television. Unlike his co-stars, Arnaz was never nominated for an Emmy for his performance in &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;; however, as executive producer of the series, he was nominated four times in the Best Situation Comedy category, winning twice. In 1956, he won a Golden Globe for Best Television Achievement for helping to shape the American Comedy through his contributions in front of and behind the camera of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;. He was inducted into the Television Academy&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

The Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Center museum is in Jamestown, New York, and the Desi Arnaz Bandshell in the Lucille Ball Memorial Park is in Celoron, New York.

Desi Arnaz appears as a character in Oscar Hijuelos&#x27;s 1989 novel &quot;The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love&quot; and is portrayed by his son, Desi Arnaz Jr., in the 1992 film adaptation, &quot;The Mambo Kings&quot;.

Maurice Benard portrayed Desi Arnaz in the 1991 television film &quot;Lucy &amp; Desi: Before the Laughter&quot;.

In the 2003 television film &quot;Lucy&quot;, Desi Arnaz was portrayed by Danny Pino.

Arnaz was portrayed by Oscar Nuñez in &quot;I Love Lucy: A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Sitcom&quot;, a comedy about how Arnaz and Ball battled to get their sitcom on the air. It had its world premiere in Los Angeles on July 12, 2018, co-starring Sarah Drew as Lucille Ball and Seamus Dever as &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; creator-producer-head writer Jess Oppenheimer. The play, written by Jess Oppenheimer&#x27;s son, Gregg Oppenheimer, was recorded in front of a live audience for nationwide public radio broadcast and online distribution. BBC Radio 4 broadcast a serialized version of the play in the UK in August 2020, as &quot;LUCY LOVES DESI: A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Sitcom,&quot; starring Wilmer Valderrama as Arnaz and co-starring Anne Heche as Lucille Ball.

On March 2, 2019, Google celebrated what would have been Arnaz&#x27;s 102nd birthday with a Google Doodle.

Javier Bardem portrayed Arnaz in the 2021 biographical film &quot;Being the Ricardos&quot; written and directed by Aaron Sorkin and produced by Amazon Studios, alongside Nicole Kidman as Ball. He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor.

<text>A DNA virus is a virus that has a genome made of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that is replicated by a DNA polymerase. They can be divided between those that have two strands of DNA in their genome, called double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses, and those that have one strand of DNA in their genome, called single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses. dsDNA viruses primarily belong to two realms: &quot;Duplodnaviria&quot; and &quot;Varidnaviria&quot;, and ssDNA viruses are almost exclusively assigned to the realm &quot;Monodnaviria&quot;, which also includes some dsDNA viruses. Additionally, many DNA viruses are unassigned to higher taxa. Reverse transcribing viruses, which have a DNA genome that is replicated through an RNA intermediate by a reverse transcriptase, are classified into the kingdom &quot;Pararnavirae&quot; in the realm &quot;Riboviria&quot;.

DNA viruses are ubiquitous worldwide, especially in marine environments where they form an important part of marine ecosystems, and infect both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. They appear to have multiple origins, as viruses in &quot;Monodnaviria&quot; appear to have emerged from archaeal and bacterial plasmids on multiple occasions, though the origins of &quot;Duplodnaviria&quot; and &quot;Varidnaviria&quot; are less clear.

Prominent disease-causing DNA viruses include herpesviruses, papillomaviruses, and poxviruses.

==Baltimore classification==
The Baltimore classification system is used to group viruses together based on their manner of messenger RNA (mRNA) synthesis and is often used alongside standard virus taxonomy, which is based on evolutionary history. DNA viruses constitute two Baltimore groups: Group I: double-stranded DNA viruses, and Group II: single-stranded DNA viruses. While Baltimore classification is chiefly based on transcription of mRNA, viruses in each Baltimore group also typically share their manner of replication. Viruses in a Baltimore group do not necessarily share genetic relation or morphology.

===Double-stranded DNA viruses===
The first Baltimore group of DNA viruses are those that have a double-stranded DNA genome. All dsDNA viruses have their mRNA synthesized in a three-step process. First, a transcription preinitiation complex binds to the DNA upstream of the site where transcription begins, allowing for the recruitment of a host RNA polymerase. Second, once the RNA polymerase is recruited, it uses the negative strand as a template for synthesizing mRNA strands. Third, the RNA polymerase terminates transcription upon reaching a specific signal, such as a polyadenylation site.

dsDNA viruses make use of several mechanisms to replicate their genome. Bidirectional replication, in which two replication forks are established at a replication origin site and move in opposite directions of each other, is widely used. A rolling circle mechanism that produces linear strands while progressing in a loop around the circular genome is also common. Some dsDNA viruses use a strand displacement method whereby one strand is synthesized from a template strand, and a complementary strand is then synthesized from the prior synthesized strand, forming a dsDNA genome. Lastly, some dsDNA viruses are replicated as part of a process called replicative transposition whereby a viral genome in a host cell&#x27;s DNA is replicated to another part of a host genome.

dsDNA viruses can be subdivided between those that replicate in the cell nucleus, and as such are relatively dependent on host cell machinery for transcription and replication, and those that replicate in the cytoplasm, in which case they have evolved or acquired their own means of executing transcription and replication. dsDNA viruses are also commonly divided between tailed dsDNA viruses, referring to members of the realm &quot;Duplodnaviria&quot;, usually the tailed bacteriophages of the order &quot;Caudovirales&quot;, and tailless or non-tailed dsDNA viruses of the realm &quot;Varidnaviria&quot;.

===Single-stranded DNA viruses===

The second Baltimore group of DNA viruses are those that have a single-stranded DNA genome. ssDNA viruses have the same manner of transcription as dsDNA viruses. However, because the genome is single-stranded, it is first made into a double-stranded form by a DNA polymerase upon entering a host cell. mRNA is then synthesized from the double-stranded form. The double-stranded form of ssDNA viruses may be produced either directly after entry into a cell or as a consequence of replication of the viral genome. Eukaryotic ssDNA viruses are replicated in the nucleus.

Most ssDNA viruses contain circular genomes that are replicated via rolling circle replication (RCR). ssDNA RCR is initiated by an endonuclease that bonds to and cleaves the positive strand, allowing a DNA polymerase to use the negative strand as a template for replication. Replication progresses in a loop around the genome by means of extending the 3&#x27;-end of the positive strand, displacing the prior positive strand, and the endonuclease cleaves the positive strand again to create a standalone genome that is ligated into a circular loop. The new ssDNA may be packaged into virions or replicated by a DNA polymerase to form a double-stranded form for transcription or continuation of the replication cycle.

Parvoviruses contain linear ssDNA genomes that are replicated via rolling hairpin replication (RHR), which is similar to RCR. Parvovirus genomes have hairpin loops at each end of the genome that repeatedly unfold and refold during replication to change the direction of DNA synthesis to move back and forth along the genome, producing numerous copies of the genome in a continuous process. Individual genomes are then excised from this molecule by the viral endonuclease. For parvoviruses, either the positive or negative sense strand may be packaged into capsids, varying from virus to virus.

Nearly all ssDNA viruses have positive sense genomes, but a few exceptions and peculiarities exist. The family &quot;Anelloviridae&quot; is the only ssDNA family whose members have negative sense genomes, which are circular. Parvoviruses, as previously mentioned, may package either the positive or negative sense strand into virions. Lastly, bidnaviruses package both the positive and negative linear strands.

==ICTV classification==
The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) oversees virus taxonomy and organizes viruses at the basal level at the rank of realm. Virus realms correspond to the rank of domain used for cellular life but differ in that viruses within a realm do not necessarily share common ancestry, nor do the realms share common ancestry with each other. As such, each virus realm represents at least one instance of viruses coming into existence. Within each realm, viruses are grouped together based on shared characteristics that are highly conserved over time. Three DNA virus realms are recognized: &quot;Duplodnaviria&quot;, &quot;Monodnaviria&quot;, and &quot;Varidnaviria&quot;.

===&quot;Duplodnaviria&quot;===

&quot;Duplodnaviria&quot; contains dsDNA viruses that encode a major capsid protein (MCP) that has the HK97 fold. Viruses in the realm also share a number of other characteristics involving the capsid and capsid assembly, including an icosahedral capsid shape and a terminase enzyme that packages viral DNA into the capsid during assembly. Two groups of viruses are included in the realm: tailed bacteriophages, which infect prokaryotes and are assigned to the order &quot;Caudovirales&quot;, and herpesviruses, which infect animals and are assigned to the order &quot;Herpesvirales&quot;.

&quot;Duplodnaviria&quot; is a very ancient realm, perhaps predating the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) of cellular life. Its origins not known, nor whether it is monophyletic or polyphyletic. A characteristic feature is the HK97-fold found in the MCP of all members, which is found outside the realm only in encapsulins, a type of nanocompartment found in bacteria: this relation is not fully understood.

The relation between caudoviruses and herpesviruses is also uncertain: they may share a common ancestor or herpesviruses may be a divergent clade from the realm &quot;Caudovirales&quot;. A common trait among duplodnaviruses is that they cause latent infections without replication while still being able to replicate in the future. Tailed bacteriophages are ubiquitous worldwide, important in marine ecology, and the subject of much research. Herpesviruses are known to cause a variety of epithelial diseases, including herpes simplex, chickenpox and shingles, and Kaposi&#x27;s sarcoma.

===&quot;Monodnaviria&quot;===
&quot;Monodnaviria&quot; contains ssDNA viruses that encode an endonuclease of the HUH superfamily that initiates rolling circle replication and all other viruses descended from such viruses. The prototypical members of the realm are called CRESS-DNA viruses and have circular ssDNA genomes. ssDNA viruses with linear genomes are descended from them, and in turn some dsDNA viruses with circular genomes are descended from linear ssDNA viruses.

Viruses in &quot;Monodnaviria&quot; appear to have emerged on multiple occasions from archaeal and bacterial plasmids, a type of extra-chromosomal DNA molecule that self-replicates inside its host. The kingdom &quot;Shotokuvirae&quot; in the realm likely emerged from recombination events that merged the DNA of these plasmids and complementary DNA encoding the capsid proteins of RNA viruses.

CRESS-DNA viruses include three kingdoms that infect prokaryotes: &quot;Loebvirae&quot;, &quot;Sangervirae&quot;, and &quot;Trapavirae&quot;. The kingdom &quot;Shotokuvirae&quot; contains eukaryotic CRESS-DNA viruses and the atypical members of &quot;Monodnaviria&quot;. Eukaryotic monodnaviruses are associated with many diseases, and they include papillomaviruses and polyomaviruses, which cause many cancers, and geminiviruses, which infect many economically important crops.

===&quot;Varidnaviria&quot;===

&quot;Varidnaviria&quot; contains DNA viruses that encode MCPs that have a jelly roll fold folded structure in which the jelly roll (JR) fold is perpendicular to the surface of the viral capsid. Many members also share a variety of other characteristics, including a minor capsid protein that has a single JR fold, an ATPase that packages the genome during capsid assembly, and a common DNA polymerase. Two kingdoms are recognized: &quot;Helvetiavirae&quot;, whose members have MCPs with a single vertical JR fold, and &quot;Bamfordvirae&quot;, whose members have MCPs with two vertical JR folds.

Varidnaviria is either monophyletic or polyphyletic and may predate the LUCA. The kingdom &quot;Bamfordvirae&quot; is likely derived from the other kingdom &quot;Helvetiavirae&quot; via fusion of two MCPs to have an MCP with two jelly roll folds instead of one. The single jelly roll (SJR) fold MCPs of &quot;Helvetiavirae&quot; show a relation to a group of proteins that contain SJR folds, including the Cupin superfamily and nucleoplasmins.

Marine viruses in &quot;Varidnaviria&quot; are ubiquitous worldwide and, like tailed bacteriophages, play an important role in marine ecology. Most identified eukaryotic DNA viruses belong to the realm. Notable disease-causing viruses in &quot;Varidnaviria&quot; include adenoviruses, poxviruses, and the African swine fever virus. Poxviruses have been highly prominent in the history of modern medicine, especially &quot;Variola virus&quot;, which caused smallpox. Many varidnaviruses can become endogenized in their host&#x27;s genome; a peculiar example are virophages, which after infecting a host, can protect the host against giant viruses.

===Baltimore classification===
dsDNA viruses are classified into three realms and include many taxa that are unassigned to a realm:
* All viruses in &quot;Duplodnaviria&quot; are dsDNA viruses.
* In &quot;Monodnaviria&quot;, members of the class &quot;Papovaviricetes&quot; are dsDNA viruses.
* All viruses in &quot;Varidnaviria&quot; are dsDNA viruses.
* The following taxa that are unassigned to a realm exclusively contain dsDNA viruses:
** Orders: &quot;Ligamenvirales&quot;
** Families: &quot;Ampullaviridae&quot;, &quot;Baculoviridae&quot;, &quot;Bicaudaviridae&quot;, &quot;Clavaviridae&quot;, &quot;Fuselloviridae&quot;, &quot;Globuloviridae&quot;, &quot;Guttaviridae&quot;, &quot;Halspiviridae&quot;, &quot;Hytrosaviridae&quot;, &quot;Nimaviridae&quot;, &quot;Nudiviridae&quot;, &quot;Ovaliviridae&quot;, &quot;Plasmaviridae&quot;, &quot;Polydnaviridae&quot;, &quot;Portogloboviridae&quot;, &quot;Thaspiviridae&quot;, &quot;Tristromaviridae&quot;
** Genera: &quot;Dinodnavirus&quot;, &quot;Rhizidiovirus&quot;

ssDNA viruses are classified into one realm and include several families that are unassigned to a realm:
* In &quot;Monodnaviria&quot;, all members except viruses in &quot;Papovaviricetes&quot; are ssDNA viruses.
* The unassigned families &quot;Anelloviridae&quot; and &quot;Spiraviridae&quot; are ssDNA virus families.
* Viruses in the family &quot;Finnlakeviridae&quot; contain ssDNA genomes. &quot;Finnlakeviridae&quot; is unassigned to a realm but is a proposed member of &quot;Varidnaviria&quot;.

<doc id="8778" wikidata="Q57402" url="?curid=8778" title="Daniel Ortega">
<text>José Daniel Ortega Saavedra (; ; born 11 November 1945) is a Nicaraguan politician and dictator who has been the co-president of Nicaragua since 30 January 2025, alongside his wife Rosario Murillo. He was the 54th and 58th president of Nicaragua from 1985 to 1990 and from 2007 to 2025. He previously led Nicaragua as the first Coordinator of the Junta of National Reconstruction from 1979 to 1985.

Ortega came to prominence with the overthrow and exile of US-backed dictator Anastasio Somoza Debayle in 1979 during the Nicaraguan Revolution. As a leader in the Sandinista National Liberation Front (, FSLN) Ortega became leader of the ruling Junta of National Reconstruction. A Marxist–Leninist, Ortega pursued a program of nationalization, land reform, wealth redistribution, and literacy programs during his first period in office. Ortega&#x27;s government was responsible for the forced displacement of 10,000 indigenous people. In 1984, Ortega won Nicaragua&#x27;s first ever free and fair presidential election with over 60% of the vote as the FSLN&#x27;s candidate. During his first term, he implemented policies to achieve leftist reforms across Nicaragua. Throughout the 1980s, Ortega&#x27;s government faced a rebellion by US-backed rebels, known as the Contras. After a presidency marred by conflict and economic collapse, Ortega was defeated in the 1990 Nicaraguan general election by Violeta Chamorro.

Ortega was an unsuccessful presidential candidate in 1996 and 2001 but won the 2006 Nicaraguan general election. In office, he allied with fellow Latin American socialists. In contrast to his previous political career, his second administration abandoned most of his earlier leftist principles, becoming increasingly anti-democratic and pro-business, alienating many of his former revolutionary allies. Under his tenure, Nicaragua has experienced democratic backsliding. In June 2018, organizations such as Amnesty International and the Organization of American States reported that Ortega had engaged in a violent oppression campaign against anti-government protests. The violent crackdown and subsequent constriction of civil liberties have led to waves of emigration to neighboring Costa Rica, with more than 30,000 Nicaraguans filing for asylum in that country.

His government jailed many potential rival candidates in the 2021 Nicaraguan general election, including Cristiana Chamorro Barrios. Ortega&#x27;s government also imprisoned other opponents, such as former allies Dora María Téllez and Hugo Torres Jiménez. In August 2021, Nicaragua cancelled the operating permits of six US and European NGOs. Many critics of the Ortega government, including opposition leaders, journalists and members of civil society, fled the country in mid-2021. In his fourth term, Ortega ordered the closure of several NGOs, universities, and newspapers, and resumed his repression of the Catholic Church after a brief rapprochement, imprisoning prelate Rolando José Álvarez Lagos.

==Early life==
===Early childhood===
Ortega was born in La Libertad in Chontales Department, Nicaragua, into a working-class family. His parents, Daniel Ortega Cerda and Lidia Saavedra, were opposed to the regime of Anastasio Somoza Debayle. Ortega&#x27;s mother was imprisoned by Somoza&#x27;s National Guard for being in possession of &quot;love letters&quot;, which police said were coded political missives. Ortega and his two brothers grew up to become revolutionaries. His late brother Humberto Ortega was a former general, military leader, and published writer, and the third brother Camilo Ortega died fighting the Somoza regime in 1978. They had a sister, Germania, who died.

=== Juigalpa and Managua===
Seeking stable employment, the family migrated from La Libertad to the provincial capital of Juigalpa, and then to a middle-class neighborhood in Managua. In Managua, Ortega and his brother studied at the upper-middle class high school, the LaSalle Institute, where Ortega was classmates with Arnoldo Aleman, who would go on to be mayor of Managua (1990–1995) and later President of Nicaragua (1997–2002). Ortega&#x27;s father Daniel Ortega Cedra detested US military intervention in Nicaragua and Washington&#x27;s support for the Somoza government. He imparted this anti-American sentiment to his sons.

=== Early political activity===
From an early age, Ortega opposed Nicaragua&#x27;s president Anastasio Somoza Debayle, and became involved in the underground movement against his government. Ortega and his brother Humberto formed the Insurrectionist, or Tercerista (Third Way) faction, culminating in the Nicaraguan Revolution. After the overthrow and exile of Somoza Debayle&#x27;s government, Ortega became leader of the ruling multi-partisan Junta of National Reconstruction.

Ortega was first arrested for political activities at the age of 15, and quickly joined the then-underground Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) in 1963. In 1964, Ortega travelled to Guatemala, where the police arrested him and turned him over to the Nicaraguan National Guard. After his release from detainment, Ortega arranged the assassination of his torturer, Guardsman Gonzalo Lacayo, in August 1967.

=== Imprisonment===
He was imprisoned in 1967 for taking part in armed robbery of a branch of the Bank of America. He told collaborators that they should be killed if they did not take part in the robbery. Ortega was released in late 1974, along with other Sandinista prisoners, in exchange for Somocista hostages. While imprisoned at the El Modelo jail, just outside Managua, Ortega wrote poems, one of which he titled &quot;I Never Saw Managua When Miniskirts Were in Fashion&quot;. During his imprisonment, Ortega was tortured. While he was incarcerated at El Modelo, his mother helped stage protests and hunger strikes for political prisoners; this resulted in improving the treatment of incarcerated Sandinistas.

=== Exile in Cuba===
Upon release in 1974, Ortega was exiled to Cuba. There he received training in guerrilla warfare from Fidel Castro&#x27;s Marxist–Leninist government. He later returned secretly to Nicaragua.

=== Sectional division within the FSLN===
In the late 1970s, divisions over the FSLN&#x27;s campaign against Somoza led Ortega and his brother Humberto to form the Insurrectionist, or &quot;Tercerista&quot; (Third Way) faction. The Terceristas sought to combine the distinct guerrilla war strategies of the two other factions, Tomás Borge&#x27;s &quot;Guerra Prolongada Popular&quot; (GPP, or Prolonged People&#x27;s War), and Jaime Wheelock&#x27;s &quot;Proletarian Tendency&quot;. The Ortega brothers forged alliances with a wide array of anti-Somoza forces, including Catholic and Protestant activists, and other non-Marxist civil society groups. The Terceristas became the most effective faction in wielding political and military strength, and their push for FSLN solidarity received the support of revolutionary leaders such as Fidel Castro.

=== Marriage and family===
Ortega married Rosario Murillo in 1979 in a secret ceremony. They moved to Costa Rica with her three children from a previous marriage. Ortega remarried Murillo in 2005 in order to have the marriage recognized by the Catholic Church, as part of his effort to reconcile with the church. The couple has eight children, three of them together. Murillo serves as the Ortega government&#x27;s spokeswoman and a government minister, among other positions. Ortega adopted stepdaughter Zoilamérica Ortega Murillo in 1986, through a court case. In 1998, she accused him of sexually abusing her as a child.

==Sandinista revolution and first presidency (1979–1990)==


When Somoza was overthrown by the FSLN in July 1979, Ortega became a member of the five-person Junta of National Reconstruction, which included Sandinista militant Moisés Hassan, novelist Sergio Ramírez, businessman Alfonso Robelo, and Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, the widow of a murdered journalist. In September 1979, United States President Carter hosted Ortega at the White House, and warned him against arming other Central American leftist guerrilla movements. At the time, Ortega spoke truthfully when he denied Sandinista involvement in neighboring countries. When Ortega questioned the Americans about CIA support for anti-Sandinista groups, Carter and Deputy Secretary of State Warren Christopher said the reports were false. After the meeting, Carter asked Congress for $75 million in aid to Nicaragua, contingent on the Sandinista government&#x27;s promise not to aid other guerrillas.

The FSLN came to dominate the junta, Robelo and Chamorro resigned, and in 1981 Ortega became the coordinator of the Junta. As the only member of the FSLN National Directorate in the Junta, he was the effective leader of the country. After attaining power, the FSLN embarked upon an ambitious programme of social reform. They arranged to redistribute of land to about 100,000 families; launched a literacy drive, and made health care improvements that ended polio through mass vaccinations, and reduced the frequency of other treatable diseases. The Sandinista nationalization efforts affected mostly banks and industries owned by the extended Somoza family. More than half of all farms, businesses, and industries remained in private hands. The revolutionary government wanted to preserve a mixed economy and support private sector investment. The Superior Council of Private Enterprise (COSEP) opposed the Sandinistas&#x27; economic reform. The main organization of Nicaraguan big business was composed of prosperous families from the Pacific coast cities, who dominated commerce and banking. Ortega took a very hard line against opposition to his policies: On 21 February 1981, the Sandinista army killed 7 Miskito Indians and wounded 17.

Ortega&#x27;s administration forced displacement of many of the indigenous population: 10,000 individuals had been moved by 1982. Thousands of Indians fled to take refuge across the border in Honduras, and Ortega&#x27;s government imprisoned 14,000 in Nicaragua. Anthropologist Gilles Bataillon termed this &quot;politics of ethnocide&quot; in Nicaragua. The Indians formed two rebel groups – the Misura and Misurasata. They were joined in the north by Nicaraguan Democratic Force (FDN) and in the south by former Sandinistas and peasantry who, under the leadership of Edén Pastora, were resisting forced collectivization.

In 1980 the Sandinista government launched the massive Nicaraguan Literacy Campaign and said the illiteracy rate fell from 50% to 13% in the span of five months. Robert F. Arnove said the figures were excessive because many &quot;unteachable&quot; illiterates were omitted from the statistics, and many people declared literate were found to be unable to read or write a simple sentence. Richard Kraft said that even if the figures were exaggerated, the &quot;accomplishment is without precedent in educational history&quot;. In 1980, UNESCO awarded Nicaragua the Nadezhda K. Krupskaya prize in recognition of its efforts. The FSLN also focused on improving the Nicaraguan health system, particularly through vaccination campaigns and the construction of public hospitals. These actions reduced child mortality by half, to 40 deaths per thousand. By 1982, the World Health Organization deemed Nicaragua a model for primary health care. During this period, Nicaragua won the UNESCO prize for exceptional health progress.

In 1981, United States President Ronald Reagan accused the FSLN of joining with Soviet-backed Cuba in supporting Marxist revolutionary movements in other Latin American countries, such as El Salvador. People within the Reagan administration authorized the CIA to begin financing, arming and training rebels as anti-Sandinista guerrillas, some of whom were former officers from Somoza&#x27;s National Guard. These were known collectively as the Contras. This resulted in one of the largest political scandals in US history, (the Iran–Contra affair). Oliver North and several members of the Reagan administration defied the Boland Amendment, selling arms to Iran and using the proceeds in order to secretly fund the Contras.

The Contra war claimed 30,000 lives in Nicaragua. The tactics used by the Sandinista government to fight the Contras have been widely condemned for their suppression of civil rights. On 15 March 1982, the junta declared a state of siege, which allowed it to close independent radio stations, suspend the right of association, and limit the freedom of trade unions. Nicaragua&#x27;s Permanent Commission on Human Rights condemned Sandinista human rights violations, accusing them of killing and forcibly disappearing thousands of persons in the first few years of the war.

At the 1984 general election Ortega won the presidency with 67% of the vote and took office on 10 January 1985. In the early phases of the campaign, Ortega enjoyed many institutional advantages, and used the full power of the press, police, and Supreme Electoral Council against the fractured opposition. In the weeks before the November election, Ortega gave a U.N. speech denouncing talks held in Rio de Janeiro on electoral reform. But by 22 October, the Sandinistas signed an accord with opposition parties to reform electoral and campaign laws, making the process more fair and transparent. While campaigning, Ortega promoted the Sandinistas&#x27; achievements, and at a rally said that &quot;Democracy is literacy, democracy is land reform, democracy is education and public health.&quot; International observers judged the election to be the first free election held in the country in more than half a century. A report by an Irish governmentary delegation stated: &quot;The electoral process was carried out with total integrity. The seven parties participating in the elections represented a broad spectrum of political ideologies.&quot; The general counsel of New York&#x27;s Human Rights Commission described the election as &quot;free, fair and hotly contested&quot;. A study by the US Latin American Studies Association (LASA) concluded that the FSLN (Sandinista Front) &quot;did little more to take advantage of its incumbency than incumbent parties everywhere (including the U.S.) routinely do&quot;. However, the Reagan administration described the elections as &quot;a Soviet-style sham&quot;, and contemporary North-American press coverage tended to cast doubt on the election&#x27;s legitimacy.
Thirty-three per cent of the Nicaraguan voters cast ballots for one of six opposition parties—three to the right of the Sandinistas, three to the left—which had campaigned with the aid of government funds and free TV and radio time. Two conservative parties captured a combined 23% of the vote. They held rallies across the country (a few of which were disrupted by FSLN supporters) and blasted the Sandinistas in harsh terms. Most foreign and independent observers noted this pluralism in debunking the Reagan administration charge—ubiquitous in the US media—that it was a &quot;Soviet-style sham&quot; election. Some opposition parties boycotted the election, allegedly under pressure from US embassy officials, and so it was denounced as being unfair by the Reagan administration. Reagan thus maintained that he was justified to continue supporting what he referred to as the Contras&#x27; &quot;democratic resistance&quot;.

The illegal intervention of the Contras continued (albeit covertly) after Ortega&#x27;s democratic election. Peace talks between five Central American heads of state in July 1987 led to the signing of the Central American Peace Accords, and the beginning of a roadmap to the end of the conflict. In 1988, the Contras first entered into peace talks with the Sandinista government, although the violence continued, as did their US support. Despite US opposition, disarmament of the Contras began in 1989.

==In opposition (1990–2007)==
In the 1990 presidential election, Ortega lost his reelection bid to Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, his former colleague in the junta. Chamorro was supported by the US and a 14-party anti-Sandinista alliance known as the National Opposition Union (Unión Nacional Oppositora, UNO), an alliance that ranged from conservatives and liberals to communists. She ran an effective campaign, presenting herself as the peace candidate and promising to end the US-funded Contra War if she won. Ortega campaigned on the slogan, &quot;Everything Will Be Better&quot;, and promised that, with the Contra war over, he could focus on the nation&#x27;s recovery. Contrary to what most observers expected, Chamorro shocked Ortega and won the election. Chamorro&#x27;s UNO coalition garnered 54% of the vote, and won 51 of the 92 seats in the National Assembly. Immediately after the loss, the Sandinistas tried to maintain unity around their revolutionary posture. In Ortega&#x27;s concession speech the following day he vowed to keep &quot;ruling from below&quot; a reference to the power that the FSLN still wielded in various sectors. He also stressed his belief that the Sandinistas had the goal of bringing &quot;dignity&quot; to Latin America, and not necessarily to hold on to government posts. In 1991, Ortega said elections were &quot;an instrument to reaffirm&quot; the FSLN&#x27;s &quot;political and ideological positions&quot;, and also &quot;confront capitalism&quot;. However, the electoral loss led to pronounced divisions in the FSLN. Some members adopted more pragmatic positions, and sought to transform the FSLN into a modern social democratic party engaged in national reconciliation and class cooperation. Ortega and other party insiders found common ground with the radicals, who still promoted anti-imperialism and class conflict to achieve social change.

Possible explanations for his loss include that the Nicaraguan people were disenchanted with the Ortega government as well as the fact that already in November 1989, the White House had announced that the economic embargo against Nicaragua would continue unless Violeta Chamorro won. Also, there had been reports of intimidation from the side of the contras, with a Canadian observer mission stating that 42 people were killed by the contras in &quot;election violence&quot; in October 1989. This led many commentators to assume that Nicaraguans voted against the Sandinistas out of fear of a continuation of the contra war and economic deprivation.

From 19 to 21 July 1991, the FSLN held a National Congress to mend the rifts between members and form a new overarching political program. The effort failed to unite the party, and intense debates over the internal governance of the FSLN continued. The pragmatists, led by the former vice president Sergio Ramirez, formed the basis of a &quot;renovating&quot; faction, and supported collaboration with other political forces to preserve the rule of law in Nicaragua. Under the leadership of Ortega and Tomás Borge, the radicals regrouped into the &quot;principled&quot; faction, and branded themselves the Izquierda Democratica (ID), or Democratic Left (DL). The DL fought the Chamorro government with disruptive labor strikes and demonstrations, and renewed calls for the revolutionary reconstruction of Nicaraguan society. During the 20–23 May 1994, extraordinary congress, Ortega ran against a fellow National Directorate member, Henry Ruiz, for the position of party secretary-general. Ortega was elected with 287 to Ruiz&#x27;s 147 votes, and the DL secured the most dominant role in the FSLN.

On 9 September 1994, Ortega gained more power after taking over Sergio Ramirez&#x27;s seat in the Asamblea Sandinista (Sandinista Assembly). Ramirez had been chief of the FSLN&#x27;s parliamentary caucus since 1990, but Ortega came to oppose his actions in the National Assembly, setting the stage for Ramirez&#x27;s removal. Historic leaders, such as Ernesto Cardenal, a former minister of culture in the Sandinista government, rejected Ortega&#x27;s consolidation of power: &quot;My resignation from the FSLN has been caused by the kidnapping of the party carried out by Daniel Ortega and the group he heads.&quot; The party formally split on 8 January 1995, when Ramirez and a number of prominent Sandinista officials quit.

Ortega ran for election again, in October 1996 and November 2001, but lost on both occasions to Arnoldo Alemán and Enrique Bolaños, respectively. In these elections, a key issue was the allegation of corruption. In Ortega&#x27;s last days as president, through a series of legislative acts known as &quot;The Piñata&quot;, estates that had been seized by the Sandinista government (some valued at millions and even billions of US dollars) became the private property of various FSLN officials, including Ortega himself.

In the 1996 campaign, Ortega faced the Liberal Alliance (Alianza Liberal), headed by Arnoldo Aleman Lacayo, a former mayor of Managua. The Sandinistas softened their anti-imperialist rhetoric, with Ortega calling the US &quot;our great neighbor&quot;, and vowing to cooperate &quot;within a framework of respect, equality, and justice&quot;. The image change failed, as Aleman&#x27;s Liberal Alliance came first with 51.03% of the vote, while Ortega&#x27;s FSLN secured 37.75%.

Ortega&#x27;s policies became more moderate during his time in opposition, and he gradually changed much of his former Marxist–Leninist stance in favor of an agenda of democratic socialism. His Roman Catholic faith has become more public in recent years as well, leading Ortega to embrace a variety of socially conservative policies; in 2006 the FSLN endorsed a strict law banning all abortions in Nicaragua. In the run-up to the 2006 elections, Ortega displayed his ties to the Catholic Church by renewing his marriage vows before Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo.

Ortega was instrumental in creating the controversial strategic pact between the FSLN and the Constitutional Liberal Party (Partido Liberal Constitucionalista, PLC). The controversial alliance of Nicaragua&#x27;s two major parties is aimed at distributing power between the PLC and FSLN, and preventing other parties from rising. After sealing the agreement in January 2000, the two parties controlled the three key institutions of the state: the Comptroller General of the Republic, the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Electoral Council. &quot;&quot;El Pacto&quot;,&quot; as it is known in Nicaragua, is said to have personally benefited former presidents Ortega and Alemán greatly, while constraining then-president Bolaños. One of the key accords of the pact was to lower the ratio necessary to win a presidential election in the first round from 45% to 35%, a change in electoral law that would become decisive in Ortega&#x27;s favor in the 2006 elections.

At the Fourth Ordinary Congress of the FSLN, held 17–18 March 2002, Ortega eliminated the National Directorate (DN). Once the main collective leadership body of the party, with nine members, the DN no longer met routinely, and only three historic members remained. Instead, the body just supported decisions already made by the secretary-general. Ortega sidelined party officials and other members while empowering his own informal circle, known as the ring of iron.

=== 2001 presidential election ===

In the November 2001 general elections, Ortega lost his third successive presidential election, this time to Enrique Bolaños of the Constitutionalist Liberal Party.

Under Ortega&#x27;s direction, the FSLN formed the broad National Convergence (Convergencia Nacional) coalition in opposition to the PLC. Ortega abandoned the revolutionary tone of the past, and infused his campaign with religious imagery, giving thanks in speeches to &quot;God and the Revolution&quot; for the post-1990 democracy, and said a Sandinista victory would enable the Nicaraguan people to &quot;pass through the sea and reach the Promised Land&quot;. The US opposed Ortega&#x27;s candidacy from the beginning. The US ambassador even appeared with the PLC&#x27;s Enrique Bolaños while distributing food aid. The 11 September 2001, terrorist attacks doomed Ortega&#x27;s chances, as the threat of a US invasion became an issue. Bolanos convinced many Nicaraguans that the renewed US hostility towards terrorism would endanger their country if the openly anti-US Ortega prevailed. Bolanos ended up with 56.3% of the vote, and Ortega won 42.3%.

===2006 presidential election===

In 2006, Daniel Ortega was elected president with 38% of the vote. This occurred despite the fact that the breakaway Sandinista Renovation Movement (MRS) continued to oppose the FSLN, running former Mayor of Managua, Herty Lewites as its candidate for president. Ortega personally attacked Lewites&#x27; Jewish background, compared him to Judas, and warned he &quot;could end up hanged.&quot; However, Lewites died several months before the elections.

Ortega emphasized peace and reconciliation in his campaign, and selected a former Contra leader, Jaime Morales Carazo, as his running mate. The FSLN also won 38 seats in the congressional elections, becoming the party with the largest representation in parliament. The split in the Constitutionalist Liberal Party helped allow the FSLN to become the largest party in Congress; however, the Sandinista vote had a minuscule split between the FSLN and MRS, and that the liberal party combined is larger than the Frente Faction. In 2010, several liberal congressmen accused the FSLN of attempting to buy votes to pass constitutional reforms that would allow Ortega to run for office for the 6th time since 1984.

==Second presidency (2007–present)==
According to Tim Rogers, writing in &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, during his second term as president, Ortega took &quot;full control of all four branches of government, state institutions, the military, and police&quot;, and in the process dismantled &quot;Nicaragua&#x27;s institutional democracy&quot;. Frances Robles wrote that Ortega took control &quot;every aspect of government ... the National Assembly, the Supreme Court, the armed forces, the judiciary, the police and the prosecutor&#x27;s office&quot;. In its 2019 World Report, Human Rights Watch wrote that Ortega &quot;aggressively dismantled all institutional checks on presidential power&quot;. Many journalists and governments criticize Ortega and label him a dictator.

===2008 elections===
In June 2008, the Nicaraguan Supreme Court disqualified the MRS and the Conservative Party from participation in municipal elections. In November 2008, the Supreme Electoral Council received national and international criticism following irregularities in municipal elections, but agreed to review results for Managua only, while the opposition demanded a nationwide review. For the first time since 1990, the Council decided not to allow national or international observers to witness the election. Instances of intimidation, violence, and harassment of opposition political party members and NGO representatives have been recorded. Official results show Sandinista candidates winning 94 of the 146 municipal mayoralties, compared to 46 for the main opposition Liberal Constitutional Party (PLC). The opposition claimed that marked ballots were dumped and destroyed, that party members were refused access to some of the vote counts and that tallies from many polling places were altered. As a result of the fraud allegations, the European Union suspended $70m of aid, and the US$64m.

With the late-2000s recession, Ortega in 2011 characterised capitalism as in its &quot;death throes&quot; and portrayed the Bolivarian Alternative for the People of Our America (ALBA) was the most advanced, most Christian and fairest project. He also said God was punishing the United States with the financial crisis for trying to impose its economic principles on poor countries. &quot;It&#x27;s incredible that in the most powerful country in the world, which spends billions of dollars on brutal wars ... people do not have enough money to stay in their homes.&quot;

Before the National Sandinista Council held in September 2009, Lenin Cerna, the secretary of the party organization, called for diversifying its political strategies. He declared the FSLN&#x27;s future depended on implementing new plans, &quot;so that the party can advance via new routes and in new ways, always under Ortega&#x27;s leadership&quot;. Ortega gained power over the selection of candidates, allowing him to personally choose all candidates for public office.

During an interview with David Frost for the Al Jazeera English programme &quot;Frost Over the World&quot; in March 2009, Ortega suggested that he would like to change the constitution to allow him to run again for president. In Judicial Decision 504, issued on 19 October 2009, the Supreme Court of Justice of Nicaragua declared portions of Articles 147 and 178 of the Constitution of Nicaragua inapplicable; these provisions concerned the eligibility of candidates for president, vice-president, mayor, and vice-mayor—a decision that had the effect of allowing Ortega to run for reelection in 2011.

For this decision, the Sandinista magistrates formed the required quorum by excluding the opposition magistrates and replacing them with Sandinista substitutes, violating the Nicaraguan constitution. Opposing parties, the church and human rights groups in Nicaragua denounced the decision. Throughout 2010, court rulings gave Ortega greater power over judicial and civil service appointments.

While supporting abortion rights during his presidency during the 1980s, Ortega has since embraced the Catholic Church&#x27;s position of strong opposition. While non-emergency abortions have long been illegal in Nicaragua, recently even abortions &quot;in the case where the pregnancy endangers the mother&#x27;s life&quot;, otherwise known as therapeutic abortions have been made illegal in the days before the 2006 election, with a six-year prison term in such cases, too—a move supported by Ortega.

===2011 election===
Ortega was re-elected president with a vote on 6 November and confirmation on 16 November 2011. During the election, the Supreme Electoral Council (CSE) blocked both domestic and international poll observers from multiple polling stations. According to the Supreme Electoral Council, Ortega defeated Fabio Gadea, with 63% of the vote.
;2014 amendments
In January 2014 the National Assembly, dominated by the FSLN, approved constitutional amendments that abolished term limits for the presidency and allowed a president to run for an unlimited number of five-year terms. While the FSLN claimed the amendments would assure the stability Nicaragua needed to deal with long-term problems, the opposition claimed they were a threat to democracy. The constitutional reforms also gave Ortega the sole power to appoint military and police commanders.

===2016 elections===
As of 2016, Ortega&#x27;s family owns three of the nine free-to-air television channels in Nicaragua, and controls a fourth (the public Channel 6). Four of the remaining five are controlled by Mexican mogul Ángel González, and are generally considered to be aligned with Ortega&#x27;s ruling FSLN party. There are no government restrictions on Internet use; the Ortega administration attempted to gain complete control over online media in 2015, but failed due to opposition from civil society, political parties, and private organizations.

In June 2016, the Nicaraguan supreme court ruled to oust Eduardo Montealegre, the leader of the main opposition party, leaving the main opposition coalition with no means of contesting the November 2016 national elections. In August 2016, Ortega chose his wife, Rosario Murillo, as his vice-presidential running-mate for re-election.

According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, figures announced on November 7, 2016, put Daniel Ortega in line for his third consecutive term as president, also being his fourth term overall. The Supreme Electoral Council (CSE) reported Ortega and Murillo won 72.4% of the vote, with 68% turnout. The opposition coalition had called the election a &quot;farce&quot; and had called for the boycott of the election. International observers were not allowed to observe the vote. Nevertheless, according to the BBC, Ortega was the most popular candidate by far, possibly due to Nicaragua&#x27;s stable economic growth and lack of violence compared to its neighbours El Salvador and Honduras in recent years.

;Economic situation during presidency
According to Tim Rogers, until the 2018 unrest, as president Ortega presided over &quot;the fastest-growing economy in Central America&quot; and was a &quot;poster child for foreign investment and citizen security in a region known for gangs and unrest&quot;. During this time the Ortega government formed an alliance with the Superior Council for Private Enterprise (COSEP), Nicaragua&#x27;s council of business chambers. However the same unpopular decree which &quot;unilaterally overhauling the social-security tax system&quot; (mentioned below) and precipitated the unrest in April 2018, also broke Ortega&#x27;s arrangement with COSEP, and along with US sanctions, brought a sharp economic drop that as of mid-2020 is still &quot;crippling&quot; Nicaragua&#x27;s economy.

===Response to the COVID-19 pandemic===
President Ortega&#x27;s government has been the target of criticism for its lack of a response to the pandemic.

On 14 March 2020, Ortega&#x27;s government called a massive demonstration called &quot;Love in the Time of COVID-19&quot; as a show of support to him and his government. This occurred in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic which had only recently been officially declared by the WHO.

According to CNN, as of mid-June 2020, Ortega had &quot;refused to impose strict, preventive quarantine measures seen in neighboring countries&quot; to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. &quot;Public schools remain open, businesses continue to operate, festivals and cultural events are happening on an almost-weekly basis.&quot; The story stated that from mid-March to mid-June six politicians had died, and, according to witnesses, their remains disposed of at night in &quot;express burials&quot; (with police in attendance but &quot;no Mass, no wake and no funeral arrangements&quot;, no photographs). The Ortega government said reports of &quot;express burials&quot; were &quot;false news&quot;. According to AP News &quot;the government threatened to ban&quot; professional baseball players &quot;who refuse to play baseball ... And everyone is warned to keep quiet.&quot;
In hospitals &quot;ruling-party activists ensure no information leaks out&quot;, and it quotes a doctor (anesthesiologist María Nela Escoto) complaining that in the public hospital where she works &quot;everything is secret. They don&#x27;t allow suggestions, and you can&#x27;t question anything because they&#x27;re watching. It&#x27;s a very hostile environment.&quot;
(At the start of the pandemic, Ortega was out of the public eye for &quot;more than 40 days&quot;, and no explanation was given for his absence when he returned.)

===2018–2022 Nicaraguan protests===
In April 2018, student protests over a nature reserve fire expanded to cover an unpopular decree that would have cut social security benefits and increased taxpayer contributions. The protesters were violently set upon by the state sponsored Sandinista Youth. Despite attempts by Ortega&#x27;s government to hide the incident through censorship of all private-owned news outlets, photos and videos of the violence made their way to social media where they sparked outrage and urged more Nicaraguans to join in on the protests. Tensions escalated quickly, as police began using tear gas canisters and rubber bullets, and eventually live ammunition on unarmed protesters. Authorities were also seen arming Sandinista Youth members with weapons to serve as paramilitary forces. Dozens of student protesters were subsequently killed. Despite the withdrawal of the unpopular decree, the protests continue, with most protesters demanding Ortega&#x27;s and his cabinet&#x27;s resignations.

On 30 May 2018, Nicaragua&#x27;s Mother&#x27;s Day, over 300,000 people marched to honor the mothers of students killed in the preceding protests. Despite the attendance of children, mothers and retirees, and lack of any violence by marchers, marchers were attacked in an event dubbed the &quot;Mother&#x27;s Day Massacre&quot;. 16 were killed, and 88 injured, as &quot;police sprayed the crowd with bullets, government sharpshooters positioned on the roof of the national baseball stadium went headhunting with sniper rifles&quot;.

In June 2018, Tim Rogers wrote in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; magazine:Over the past seven weeks, Ortega&#x27;s police and paramilitaries have killed more than 120 people, mostly students and other young protesters who are demanding the president&#x27;s ouster and a return to democracy, according to a human-rights group [CENIDH, Nicaraguan Center for Human Rights]. Police hunt students like enemy combatants. Sandinista Youth paramilitaries, armed and paid by Ortega&#x27;s party, drive around in pickup trucks attacking protesters. Gangs of masked men loot and burn shops with impunity. Cops wear civilian clothing, and some paramilitaries dress in police uniforms. &quot;This is starting to look more like Syria than Caracas,&quot; one Nicaraguan business leader told me.

By December 3, 22 people were dead and 565 imprisoned. Professionals involved in the protests (lawyers, engineering majors, radio broadcasters and merchants) had been reduced to lives of &quot;ever-changing safe houses, encrypted messaging apps and pseudonyms&quot;, with the Ortega government allegedly &quot;hunting us like deer&quot;, according to one dissident (Roberto Carlos Membreño Briceño). Human rights organization offices were raided, computers seized and observers expelled. Observers from the Organization of American States were expelled after releasing a critical investigative report of the government&#x27;s response to the protests. The report found the government had progressed from &quot;using tear gas to rubber bullets, then real bullets and finally military firepower like assault rifles and grenade launchers&quot;, based on an analysis of videos posted on social media. At least 1,400 people involved in the protests were hurt, although that the number was probably &quot;far higher because most people were too afraid to go to public hospitals, where doctors were fired for treating wounded protesters&quot;. By July 2019 the international human rights organization Human Rights Watch called on the United States to impose sanctions on Ortega &quot;and other top&quot; Nicaraguan officials &quot;implicated&quot; in the crackdown on protests.

===Term extension===
On 20 November 2024, Ortega unveiled proposals to amend the Nicaraguan constitution in order to extend his term from five years to six and have his wife and vice president Rosario Murillo declared co-president. The measures passed in a first reading at the National Assembly on 22 November and became official following a second reading on 30 January 2025.

===Foreign policy===
Soon after the 2006 election, Ortega paid an official visit to Iran and met Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Ortega told the press that the &quot;revolutions of Iran and Nicaragua are almost twin revolutions ... since both revolutions are about justice, liberty, self-determination, and the struggle against imperialism&quot;.

On 6 March 2008, following the 2008 Andean diplomatic crisis, Ortega announced that Nicaragua was breaking diplomatic ties with Colombia &quot;in solidarity with the Ecuadorian people&quot;. Ortega also stated, &quot;We are not breaking relations with the Colombian people. We are breaking relations with the terrorist policy practiced by Álvaro Uribe&#x27;s government&quot;. The relations were restored with the resolution at a Rio Group summit held in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, on 7 March 2008. At the summit Colombia&#x27;s Álvaro Uribe, Ecuador&#x27;s Rafael Correa, Venezuela&#x27;s Hugo Chávez and Ortega publicly shook hands in a show of good-will. The handshakes, broadcast live throughout Latin America, appeared to signal that a week of military buildups and diplomatic repercussions was over. After the handshakes, Ortega said he would re-establish diplomatic ties with Colombia. Uribe then quipped that he would send him the bill for his ambassador&#x27;s plane fare.

On 25 May 2008, Ortega, upon learning of the death of FARC guerrilla leader Manuel Marulanda in Colombia, expressed condolences to the family of Marulanda and solidarity with the FARC and called Marulanda an extraordinary fighter who battled against profound inequalities in Colombia. The declarations were protested by the Colombian government and criticized in the major Colombian media outlets.

On 2 September 2008, during ceremonies for the 29th anniversary of the founding of the Nicaraguan army, Ortega announced that &quot;Nicaragua recognizes the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia and fully supports the Russian government&#x27;s position&quot;. Ortega&#x27;s decision made Nicaragua the second country (after Russia) to recognize the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia from Georgia.

Under Ortega&#x27;s leadership, Nicaragua joined the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas.

When seeking office, Ortega threatened to cut diplomatic recognition with the Republic of China (Taiwan, formerly Nationalist China) in order to restore relations with the Mainland-based People&#x27;s Republic of China (as in the period from 1985 to 1990) as the legal government of China. But he did not do so. In 2007 Ortega stated that Nicaragua did not accept the One China Policy of the PRC government and that Nicaragua reserved the right to maintain official diplomatic relations with the ROC. He reassured President Chen Shui Bian in 2007 that Nicaragua would not break diplomatic relations with the ROC. He explained that during the Reagan administration the United States imposed sanctions on Nicaragua. But cutting ties with Taipei was a sad and painful decision because of the friendship between Nicaragua and Taiwan&#x27;s people and government. Ortega met with the ROC President Ma Ying-jeou in 2009 and both agreed to improve the diplomatic ties between both countries. However, with a trade show from China (PRC) in Managua in 2010, he is attempting a two-track policy to get benefits from both sides. In 2016 Nicaragua and China (ROC) signed an air services agreement and Ortega stated that Nicaragua&#x27;s free trade deal with the ROC had benefited both nations. The ROC increased its investment in Nicaragua. In December 2021, Nicaragua once again switched recognition with the PRC.

In September 2010, after a US report listed Nicaragua as a &quot;major&quot; drug-trafficking centre, with Costa Rica and Honduras, Ortega urged the US Congress and Obama administration to allocate more resources to assist the fight against drug trafficking.

During the Libyan Civil War, Ortega was among the very few leaders who spoke out in clear defense of the embattled Muammar Gaddafi. During a telephone conversation between the two, Ortega told Gaddafi that he was &quot;waging a great battle to defend his nation&quot; and stated that &quot;it&#x27;s at difficult times that loyalty and resolve are put to the test.&quot;

Ortega has said that Assad&#x27;s victory in the 2014 election is an important step to &quot;attain peace in Syria and a clear cut evidence that the Syrian people trust their president as a national leader and support his policies which aim at maintaining Syria&#x27;s sovereignty and unity&quot;.

Ortega attended the swearing-in ceremony of Nicolás Maduro for his second term on 10 January 2019.

In an interview with Max Blumenthal in August 2019, Ortega stated that he was open to the idea of Bernie Sanders (who had visited him in 1985) winning the US presidency in 2020 and that Sanders&#x27;s message &quot;goes in the right direction for the U.S. to become a pole of peace, development, and cooperation&quot;.

===Environmental policy===
In 2016, Daniel Ortega did not sign the Paris Agreement because he felt the deal did not do enough to protect the climate, although he later changed his mind. Moreover, Nicaragua rejected projects of mining of the Canadian group B2 Gold which could represent a threat to the environment. According to government estimates, Nicaragua has passed from 25% renewable electricity to 52% between 2007 and 2016.

===International sanctions===
==== United States ====
In November 2021, Joe Biden signed into law the &quot;Reinforcing Nicaragua&#x27;s Adherence to Conditions for Electoral Reform Act&quot; (RENACER Act) which extended US sanctions against Nicaragua and gave Biden the power to exclude Nicaragua from the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) and to obstruct multilateral loans to Nicaragua. Venezuela and Russia condemned the new law.

==== Ukraine ====
In February 2021, Ukraine&#x27;s parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, approved economic sanctions against President Ortega and his government. The sanctions were in response to Ortega sending a delegation to Russian-occupied Crimea in November 2020.

==Criticisms and concerns ==
Ortega&#x27;s second presidency has been subject to much criticism and accusations of his becoming a strongman. The 2018 protests have been pointed to as being symbolic of these tensions. In 2018, Frances Robles wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that the &quot;many Ortega adult children manage everything from gasoline distribution to television stations&quot; in Nicaragua.

In the months preceding the November 2021 Nicaraguan general election, Ortega&#x27;s government arrested many prominent opposition members. As of 23 July, 26 opposition leaders have been imprisoned.

On 24 March 2022, the ambassador Arturo McFields, condemned the Ortega government and requested the release of political prisoners, alluding that the government people were &quot;tired of dictatorship&quot; and that it was not easy to denounce it. As a result, he was dismissed.

The American lawyer Paul Reichler also left his position as representative due to &quot;moral conscience&quot;, who felt that the president &quot;was no longer the Daniel Ortega whom he respected so much and served with so much pride&quot;. Reichler found it inconceivable that someone like Ortega would have mercilessly suppressed peaceful demonstrations and imprisoned his former colleagues in inhumane conditions, and accused him of &quot;murdering&quot; a general by withholding medical treatment. This figure of American origin served as Nicaragua&#x27;s international legal adviser before the International Court of Justice, when Managua denounced the United States for financing the counterrevolution, winning the case.

The Ortega administration also ordered the closure of the Nicaraguan Language Academy for failing to register as a &quot;foreign agent&quot; ratified by the Sandinista parliament with the favorable vote of 75 deputies of the ruling FSLN.

===Sexual abuse allegations===
In 1998, Daniel Ortega&#x27;s adopted stepdaughter Zoilamérica Narváez released a 48-page report in which she alleged he had sexually abused her from 1979, when she was 12, until 1990. Ortega and his wife Murillo denied the allegation. The case could not proceed in Nicaraguan courts, which have been consistently allied with Ortega, because he had immunity from prosecution as a member of parliament, and the five-year statute of limitations for sexual abuse and rape charges had expired. Narváez&#x27;s complaint to the Inter-American Human Rights Commission was ruled admissible on 15 October 2001. On 4 March 2002, the Nicaraguan government accepted the commission&#x27;s recommendation of a &quot;friendly agreement&quot;. Narváez withdrew the accusations in 2008. Following the 2016 election, Narváez renewed her accusations and said that she had become an outcast in her family.

In 2019 a documentary film &quot;Exiliada&quot; was released which revolves around Zoilamérica Narváez and her sexual abuse allegations against Ortega.

There is also the case of Elvia Junieth who was allegedly abused by the president in 2005, and, according to the family, a girl was born from that relationship that Ortega did not recognize. Ernesto Moncada Lau, another of the assistants to the Sandinista president, appears on the birth certificate as the father of the minor. Her brother died in the Tipitapa Model prison in November 2021.

<text>In naval terminology, a destroyer is a fast, maneuverable, long-endurance warship intended to escort
larger vessels in a fleet, convoy, or carrier battle group and defend them against a wide range of general threats. They were originally conceived in 1885 by Fernando Villaamil for the Spanish Navy as a defense against torpedo boats, and by the time of the Russo-Japanese War in 1904, these &quot;torpedo boat destroyers&quot; (TBDs) were &quot;large, swift, and powerfully armed torpedo boats designed to destroy other torpedo boats&quot;. Although the term &quot;destroyer&quot; had been used interchangeably with &quot;TBD&quot; and &quot;torpedo boat destroyer&quot; by navies since 1892, the term &quot;torpedo boat destroyer&quot; had been generally shortened to simply &quot;destroyer&quot; by nearly all navies by the First World War.

Before World War II, destroyers were light vessels with little endurance for unattended ocean operations; typically, a number of destroyers and a single destroyer tender operated together. After the war, destroyers grew in size. The American s had a displacement of 2,200 tons, while the has a displacement of up to 9,600 tons, a difference of nearly 340%. Moreover, the advent of guided missiles allowed destroyers to take on the surface-combatant roles previously filled by battleships and cruisers. This resulted in larger and more powerful guided missile destroyers more capable of independent operation.

At the start of the 21st century, destroyers are the global standard for surface-combatant ships, with only two nations (the United States and Russia) officially operating the heavier cruisers, with no battleships or true battlecruisers remaining. Modern guided-missile destroyers are equivalent in tonnage but vastly superior in firepower to cruisers of the World War II era, and are capable of carrying nuclear-tipped cruise missiles. At long, a displacement of 9,200 tons, and with an armament of more than 90 missiles, guided-missile destroyers such as the &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; class are actually larger and more heavily armed than most previous ships classified as guided-missile cruisers. The Chinese Type 055 destroyer has been described as a cruiser in some US Navy reports due to its size and armament.

Many NATO navies, such as the French, Spanish, Dutch, Danish, and German, use the term &quot;frigate&quot; for their destroyers, which leads to some confusion.

==Origins==

The emergence and development of the destroyer was related to the invention of the self-propelled torpedo in the 1860s. A navy now had the potential to destroy a superior enemy battle fleet using steam launches to fire torpedoes. Cheap, fast boats armed with torpedoes called torpedo boats were built and became a threat to large capital ships near enemy coasts. The first seagoing vessel designed to launch the self-propelled Whitehead torpedo was the 33-ton in 1876. She was armed with two drop collars to launch these weapons; these were replaced in 1879 by a single torpedo tube in the bow. By the 1880s, the type had evolved into small ships of 50–100 tons, fast enough to evade enemy picket boats.

At first, the threat of a torpedo-boat attack to a battle fleet was considered to exist only when at anchor, but as faster and longer-range torpedo boats and torpedoes were developed, the threat extended to cruising at sea. In response to this new threat, more heavily gunned picket boats called &quot;catchers&quot; were built, which were used to escort the battle fleet at sea. They needed significant seaworthiness and endurance to operate with the battle fleet, and as they inherently became larger, they became officially designated &quot;torpedo-boat destroyers&quot;, and by the First World War were largely known as &quot;destroyers&quot; in English. The antitorpedo boat origin of this type of ship is retained in its name in other languages, including French (), Italian (), Portuguese (), Czech (), Greek (, ), Dutch () and, up until the Second World War, Polish (, now obsolete).

Once destroyers became more than just catchers guarding an anchorage, they were recognized to be also ideal to take over the offensive role of torpedo boats themselves, so they were also fitted with torpedo tubes in addition to their antitorpedo-boat guns. At that time, and even into World War I, the only function of destroyers was to protect their own battle fleet from enemy torpedo attacks and to make such attacks on the battleships of the enemy. The task of escorting merchant convoys was still in the future.

===Early designs===

An important development came with the construction of HMS &quot;Swift&quot; in 1884, later redesignated TB 81. This was a large (137 ton) torpedo boat with four 47 mm quick-firing guns and three torpedo tubes. At , while still not fast enough to engage enemy torpedo boats reliably, the ship at least had the armament to deal with them.

Another forerunner of the torpedo-boat destroyer (TBD) was the Japanese torpedo boat (&quot;Falcon&quot;), built in 1885. Designed to Japanese specifications and ordered from the Isle of Dogs, London Yarrow shipyard in 1885, she was transported in parts to Japan, where she was assembled and launched in 1887. The long vessel was armed with four 1-pounder (37 mm) quick-firing guns and six torpedo tubes, reached , and at 203 tons, was the largest torpedo boat built to date. In her trials in 1889, &quot;Kotaka&quot; demonstrated that she could exceed the role of coastal defense, and was capable of accompanying larger warships on the high seas. The Yarrow shipyards, builder of the parts for &quot;Kotaka&quot;, &quot;considered Japan to have effectively invented the destroyer&quot;.

The German aviso , launched in 1886, was designed as a &quot;Torpedojäger&quot; (torpedo hunter), intended to screen the fleet against attacks by torpedo boats. The ship was significantly larger than torpedo boats of the period, displacing some , with an armament of guns and Hotchkiss revolver cannon.

===Torpedo gunboat===
The first vessel designed for the explicit purpose of hunting and destroying torpedo boats was the torpedo gunboat. Essentially very small cruisers, torpedo gunboats were equipped with torpedo tubes and an adequate gun armament, intended for hunting down smaller enemy boats. By the end of the 1890s, torpedo gunboats were made obsolete by their more successful contemporaries, the TBDs, which were much faster.

The first example of this was , designed by Nathaniel Barnaby in 1885, and commissioned in response to the Russian War scare. The gunboat was armed with torpedoes and designed for hunting and destroying smaller torpedo boats. Exactly long and in beam, she displaced 550 tons. Built of steel, &quot;Rattlesnake&quot; was unarmoured with the exception of a -inch protective deck. She was armed with a single 4-inch/25-pounder breech-loading gun, six 3-pounder QF guns and four torpedo tubes, arranged with two fixed tubes at the bow and a set of torpedo-dropping carriages on either side. Four torpedo reloads were carried.

A number of torpedo gunboat classes followed, including the &quot;Grasshopper&quot; class, the , the , and the – all built for the Royal Navy during the 1880s and the 1890s. In the 1880s, the Chilean Navy ordered the construction of two torpedo gunboats from the British shipyard Laird Brothers, which specialized in the construction of this type of vessel. The novelty is that one of these &quot;Almirante Lynch&quot;-class torpedo boats managed to sink the ironclad with self-propelled torpedoes in the Battle of Caldera Bay in 1891, thus surpassing its main function of hunting torpedo boats.

Fernando Villaamil, second officer of the Ministry of the Navy of Spain, designed his own torpedo gunboat to combat the threat from the torpedo boat. He asked several British shipyards to submit proposals capable of fulfilling these specifications. In 1885, the Spanish Navy chose the design submitted by the shipyard of James and George Thomson of Clydebank. (&quot;Destroyer&quot; in Spanish) was laid down at the end of the year, launched in 1886, and commissioned in 1887. Some authors considered her as the first destroyer ever built.

She displaced 348 tons, and was the first warship equipped with twin triple-expansion engines generating , for a maximum speed of , which made her one of the faster ships in the world in 1888. She was armed with one Spanish-designed Hontoria breech-loading gun, four (6-pounder) Nordenfelt guns, two (3-pdr) Hotchkiss cannons and two Schwartzkopff torpedo tubes. The ship carried three torpedoes per tube. She carried a crew of 60.

In terms of gunnery, speed, and dimensions, the specialised design to chase torpedo boats and her high-seas capabilities, &quot;Destructor&quot; was an important precursor to the TBD.

==Development of modern destroyers==

The first classes of ships to bear the formal designation TBD were the of two ships and of two ships of the Royal Navy.

Early torpedo gunboat designs lacked the range and speed to keep up with the fleet they were supposed to protect. In 1892, the Third Sea Lord, Rear Admiral John &quot;Jacky&quot; Fisher ordered the development of a new type of ships equipped with the then-novel water-tube boilers and quick-firing small-calibre guns. Six ships to the specifications circulated by the admiralty were ordered initially, comprising three different designs each produced by a different shipbuilder: and from John I. Thornycroft &amp; Company, and from Yarrows, and and from Laird, Son &amp; Company.

These ships all featured a turtleback (i.e. rounded) forecastle that was characteristic of early British TBDs. and were both built by Thornycroft, displaced 260 tons (287.8 tons full load), and were 185 feet in length. They were armed with one 12-pounder gun and three 6-pounder guns, with one fixed 18-in torpedo tube in the bow plus two more torpedo tubes on a revolving mount abaft the two funnels. Later, the bow torpedo tube was removed and two more 6-pounder guns added, instead. They produced 4,200 hp from a pair of Thornycroft water-tube boilers, giving them a top speed of 27 knots, giving the range and speed to travel effectively with a battle fleet. In common with subsequent early Thornycroft boats, they had sloping sterns and double rudders.

The French navy, an extensive user of torpedo boats, built its first TBD in 1899, with the &quot;torpilleur d&#x27;escadre&quot;. The United States commissioned its first TBD, , Destroyer No. 1, in 1902, and by 1906, 16 destroyers were in service with the US Navy.

===Subsequent improvements===

Torpedo boat destroyer designs continued to evolve around the turn of the 20th century in several key ways. The first was the introduction of the steam turbine. The spectacular unauthorized demonstration of the turbine-powered at the 1897 Spithead Navy Review, which, significantly, was of torpedo-boat size, prompted the Royal Navy to order a prototype turbine-powered destroyer, of 1899. This was the first turbine warship of any kind, and achieved a remarkable on sea trials. By 1910, the turbine had been widely adopted by all navies for their faster ships.

The second development was the replacement of the torpedo boat-style turtleback foredeck by a raised forecastle for the new s built in 1903, which provided better sea-keeping and more space below deck.

The first warship to use only fuel oil propulsion was the Royal Navy&#x27;s TBD , after experiments in 1904, although the obsolescence of coal as a fuel in British warships was delayed by oil&#x27;s availability. Other navies also adopted oil, for instance the USN with the of 1909.
In spite of all this variety, destroyers adopted a largely similar pattern. The hull was long and narrow, with a relatively shallow draft. The bow was either raised in a forecastle or covered under a turtleback; underneath this were the crew spaces, extending to the way along the hull. Aft of the crew spaces was as much engine space as the technology of the time would allow - several boilers and engines or turbines. Above deck, one or more quick-firing guns were mounted in the bows, in front of the bridge; several more were mounted amidships and astern. Two tube mountings (later on, multiple mountings) were generally found amidships.

Between 1892 and 1914, destroyers became markedly larger; initially 275 tons with a length of for the Royal Navy&#x27;s first of TBDs, up to the First World War with long destroyers displacing 1,000 tons was not unusual. Construction remained focused on putting the biggest possible engines into a small hull, though, resulting in a somewhat flimsy construction. Often, hulls were built of high-tensile steel only thick.

By 1910, the steam-driven displacement (that is, not hydroplaning) torpedo boat had become redundant as a separate type. Germany, nevertheless, continued to build such boats until the end of World War I, although these were effectively small coastal destroyers. In fact, Germany never distinguished between the two types, giving them pennant numbers in the same series and never giving names to destroyers. Ultimately, the term &quot;torpedo boat&quot; came to be attached to a quite different vessel – the very fast-hydroplaning, motor-driven motor torpedo boat.

==Early use and World War I==
Navies originally built TBDrs to protect against torpedo boats, but admirals soon appreciated the flexibility of the fast, multipurpose vessels that resulted. Vice-Admiral Sir Baldwin Walker laid down destroyer duties for the Royal Navy:
* Screening the advance of a fleet when hostile torpedo craft are about
* Searching a hostile coast along which a fleet might pass
* Watching an enemy&#x27;s port for the purpose of harassing his torpedo craft and preventing their return
* Attacking an enemy fleet

Early destroyers were extremely cramped places to live, being &quot;without a doubt magnificent fighting vessels... but unable to stand bad weather&quot;. During the Russo-Japanese War in 1904, the commander of the Imperial Japanese Navy TBD &quot;Akatsuki&quot; described &quot;being in command of a destroyer for a long period, especially in wartime... is not very good for the health&quot;. Stating that he had originally been strong and healthy, he continued, &quot;life on a destroyer in winter, with bad food, no comforts, would sap the powers of the strongest men in the long run. A &quot;destroyer&quot; is always more uncomfortable than the others, and rain, snow, and &quot;sea-water&quot; combine to make them damp; in fact, in bad weather, there is not a dry spot where one can rest for a moment.&quot;

The Japanese destroyer-commander finished with, &quot;Yesterday, I looked at myself in a mirror for a long time; I was disagreeably surprised to see my face thin, full of wrinkles, and as old as though I were 50. My clothes (uniform) cover nothing but a skeleton, and my bones are full of rheumatism.&quot;

In 1898, the US Navy officially classified , a long all steel vessel displacing 165 tons, as a torpedo boat, but her commander, LT. John C. Fremont, described her as &quot;...a compact mass of machinery not meant to keep the sea nor to live in... as five-sevenths of the ship are taken up by machinery and fuel, whilst the remaining two-sevenths, fore and aft, are the crew&#x27;s quarters; officers forward and the men placed aft. And even in those spaces are placed anchor engines, steering engines, steam pipes, etc. rendering them unbearably hot in tropical regions.&quot;

===Early combat===

The TBD&#x27;s first major use in combat came during the Japanese surprise attack on the Russian fleet anchored in Port Arthur at the opening of the Russo-Japanese War on 8 February 1904.

Three destroyer divisions attacked the Russian fleet in port, firing a total of 18 torpedoes, but only two Russian battleships, and , and a protected cruiser, , were seriously damaged due to the proper deployment of torpedo nets. &quot;Tsesarevich&quot;, the Russian flagship, had her nets deployed, with at least four enemy torpedoes &quot;hung up&quot; in them, and other warships were similarly saved from further damage by their nets.

While capital-ship engagements were scarce in World War I, destroyer units engaged almost continually in raiding and patrol actions. The first shot of the war at sea was fired on 5 August 1914 by , one of the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla, in an engagement with the German auxiliary minelayer .

Destroyers were involved in the skirmishes that prompted the Battle of Heligoland Bight, and filled a range of roles in the Battle of Gallipoli, acting as troop transports and as fire-support vessels, as well as their fleet-screening role. Over 80 British destroyers and 60 German torpedo boats took part in the Battle of Jutland, which involved pitched small-boat actions between the main fleets, and several foolhardy attacks by unsupported destroyers on capital ships. Jutland also concluded with a messy night action between the German High Seas Fleet and part of the British destroyer screen.
The threat evolved by World War I with the development of the submarine, or U-boat. The submarine had the potential to hide from gunfire and close underwater to fire torpedoes. Early-war destroyers had the speed and armament to intercept submarines before they submerged, either by gunfire or by ramming. Destroyers also had a shallow enough draft that they were difficult to hit with torpedoes.
The desire to attack submarines under water led to rapid destroyer evolution during the war. They were quickly equipped with strengthened bows for ramming, and depth charges and hydrophones for identifying submarine targets. The first submarine casualty credited to a destroyer was the German , rammed by on 29 October 1914. While &quot;U-19&quot; was only damaged, the next month, successfully sank . The first depth-charge sinking was on 4 December 1916, when was sunk by HMS &quot;Llewellyn&quot;.

The submarine threat meant that many destroyers spent their time on antisubmarine patrol. Once Germany adopted unrestricted submarine warfare in January 1917, destroyers were called on to escort merchant convoys. US Navy destroyers were among the first American units to be dispatched upon the American entry to the war, and a squadron of Japanese destroyers even joined Allied patrols in the Mediterranean. Patrol duty was far from safe; of the 67 British destroyers lost in the war, collisions accounted for 18, while 12 were wrecked.

At the end of the war, the state-of-the-art was represented by the British W class.

==1918–1945==


The trend during World War I had been towards larger destroyers with heavier armaments. A number of opportunities to fire at capital ships had been missed during the war, because destroyers had expended all their torpedoes in an initial salvo. The British V and W classes of the late war had sought to address this by mounting six torpedo tubes in two triple mounts, instead of the four or two on earlier models. The V and W classes set the standard of destroyer building well into the 1920s.

Two Romanian destroyers and , though, had the greatest firepower of all destroyers in the world throughout the first half of the 1920s. This was largely because, between their commissioning in 1920 and 1926, they retained the armament that they had while serving in the Italian Navy as scout cruisers (&quot;esploratori&quot;). When initially ordered by Romania in 1913, the Romanian specifications envisioned three 120 mm guns, a caliber which would eventually be adopted as the standard for future Italian destroyers. Armed with three 152 mm and four 76 mm guns after being completed as scout cruisers, the two warships were officially re-rated as destroyers by the Romanian Navy. The two Romanian warships were thus the destroyers with the greatest firepower in the world throughout much of the interwar period. As of 1939, when the Second World War started, their artillery, although changed, was still close to cruiser standards, amounting to nine heavy naval guns (five of 120 mm and four of 76 mm). In addition, they retained their two twin 457 mm torpedo tubes and two machine guns, plus the capacity to carry up to 50 mines.

The next major innovation came with the Japanese or &quot;special type&quot;, designed in 1923 and delivered in 1928. The design was initially noted for its powerful armament of six 5-inch (127 mm) guns and three triple torpedo mounts. The second batch of the class gave the guns high-angle turrets for antiaircraft warfare, and the , oxygen-fueled Long Lance Type 93 torpedo. The later of 1931 further improved the torpedo armament by storing its reload torpedoes close at hand in the superstructure, allowing reloading within 15 minutes.

Most other nations replied with similar larger ships. The US adopted twin 5-inch (127 mm) guns, and the subsequent and es (the latter of 1934) increased the number of torpedo tubes to 12 and 16, respectively.
In the Mediterranean, the Italian Navy&#x27;s building of very fast light cruisers of the prompted the French to produce exceptional destroyer designs. The French had long been keen on large destroyers, with their of 1922 displacing over 2,000 tons and carrying 130 mm guns; a further three similar classes were produced around 1930. The of 1935 carried five guns and nine torpedo tubes, but could achieve speeds of , which remains the record speed for a steamship and for any destroyer. The Italians&#x27; own destroyers were almost as swift; most Italian designs of the 1930s were rated at over , while carrying torpedoes and either four or six 120 mm guns.

Germany started to build destroyers again during the 1930s as part of Hitler&#x27;s rearmament program. The Germans were also fond of large destroyers, but while the initial Type 1934 displaced over 3,000 tons, their armament was equal to smaller vessels. This changed from the Type 1936 onwards, which mounted heavy guns. German destroyers also used innovative high-pressure steam machinery; while this should have helped their efficiency, it more often resulted in mechanical problems.

Once German and Japanese rearmament became clear, the British and American navies consciously focused on building destroyers that were smaller, but more numerous than those used by other nations. The British built a series of destroyers (the to ), which were about 1,400 tons standard displacement, and had four guns and eight torpedo tubes; the American of 1938 was similar in size, but carried five guns and ten torpedo tubes. Realizing the need for heavier gun armament, the British built the of 1936 (sometimes called &quot;Afridi&quot; after one of two lead ships). These ships displaced 1,850 tons and were armed with eight guns in four twin turrets and four torpedo tubes. These were followed by the J-class and L-class destroyers, with six guns in twin turrets and eight torpedo tubes.

Antisubmarine sensors included sonar (or ASDIC), although training in their use was indifferent. Antisubmarine weapons changed little, and ahead-throwing weapons, a need recognized in World War I, had made no progress.

===Later combat===

During the 1920s and 1930s, destroyers were often deployed to areas of diplomatic tension or humanitarian disaster. British and American destroyers were common on the Chinese coast and rivers, even supplying landing parties to protect colonial interests. By World War II, the threat had evolved once again. Submarines were more effective, and aircraft had become important weapons of naval warfare; once again the early-war fleet destroyers were ill-equipped for combating these new targets. They were fitted with new light antiaircraft guns, radar, and forward-launched ASW weapons, in addition to their existing dual-purpose guns, depth charges, and torpedoes. Increasing size allowed improved internal arrangement of propulsion machinery with compartmentation, so ships were less likely to be sunk by a single hit. In most cases torpedo and/or dual-purpose gun armament was reduced to accommodate new anti-air and anti-submarine weapons. By this time the destroyers had become large, multi-purpose vessels, expensive targets in their own right. As a result, casualties on destroyers were among the highest. In the US Navy, particularly in World War II, destroyers became known as tin cans due to their light armor compared to battleships and cruisers.

The need for large numbers of antisubmarine ships led to the introduction of smaller and cheaper specialized antisubmarine warships called corvettes and frigates by the Royal Navy and destroyer escorts by the USN. A similar programme was belatedly started by the Japanese (see ). These ships had the size and displacement of the original TBDs from which the contemporary destroyer had evolved.

==Post-World War II==

Some conventional destroyers completed in the late 1940s and 1950s were built on wartime experience. These vessels were significantly larger than wartime ships and had fully automatic main guns, unit machinery, radar, sonar, and antisubmarine weapons, such as the squid mortar. Examples include the British , US , and the Soviet s.

Some World War II–vintage ships were modernized for antisubmarine warfare, and to extend their service lives, to avoid having to build (expensive) brand-new ships. Examples include the US FRAM I programme and the British Type 15 frigates converted from fleet destroyers.

The advent of surface-to-air missiles and surface-to-surface missiles, such as the Exocet, in the early 1960s changed naval warfare. Guided missile destroyers (DDG in the US Navy) were developed to carry these weapons and protect the fleet from air, submarine, and surface threats. Examples include the Soviet , the British , and the US .

The 21st century destroyers tend to display features such as large, slab sides without complicated corners and crevices to keep the radar cross-section small, vertical launch systems to carry a large number of missiles at high readiness to fire, and helicopter flight decks and hangars.

==Operators==

<text>Dorothy Parker (née Rothschild; August 22, 1893 – June 7, 1967) was an American poet and writer of fiction, plays and screenplays based in New York; she was known for her caustic wisecracks, and eye for 20th-century urban foibles.

Parker rose to acclaim, both for her literary works published in magazines, such as &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, and as a founding member of the Algonquin Round Table. In the early 1930s, Parker traveled to Hollywood to pursue screenwriting. Her successes there, including two Academy Award nominations, were curtailed when her involvement in left-wing politics resulted in her being placed on the Hollywood blacklist.

Dismissive of her own talents, she deplored her reputation as a &quot;wisecracker&quot;. Nevertheless, both her literary output and reputation for sharp wit have endured. Some of her works have been set to music.

== Early life and education ==
Also known as Dot or Dottie, Parker was born Dorothy Rothschild in 1893 to Jacob Henry Rothschild and his wife Eliza Annie (née Marston) (1851–1898) at 732 Ocean Avenue in Long Branch, New Jersey. Parker wrote in her essay &quot;My Home Town&quot; that her parents returned from their summer beach cottage there to their Manhattan apartment shortly after Labor Day (September 4) so that she could be called a true New Yorker.

Parker&#x27;s mother was of Scottish descent. Her father was the son of Sampson Jacob Rothschild (1818–1899) and Mary Greissman (b. 1824), both Prussian-born Jews. Sampson Jacob Rothschild was a merchant who immigrated to the United States around 1846, settling in Monroe County, Alabama. Dorothy&#x27;s father was one of five known siblings: Simon (1854–1908); Samuel (b. 1857); Hannah (1860–1911), later Mrs. William Henry Theobald; and Martin, born in Manhattan on December 12, 1865, who perished in the sinking of the &quot;Titanic&quot; in 1912.

Her mother died in Manhattan in July 1898, a month before Parker&#x27;s fifth birthday. Her father remarried in 1900 to Eleanor Frances Lewis (1851–1903), a Protestant.

Author Dorothy Herrmann claimed that Parker hated her father, who allegedly physically abused her, and her stepmother, whom she refused to call &quot;mother&quot;, &quot;stepmother&quot;, or &quot;Eleanor&quot;, instead referring to her as &quot;the housekeeper&quot;. However, her biographer Marion Meade refers to this account as &quot;largely false&quot;, stating that the atmosphere in which Parker grew up was indulgent, affectionate, supportive and generous.

Parker grew up on the Upper West Side and attended a Roman Catholic elementary school at the Convent of the Blessed Sacrament on West 79th Street with her sister, Helen, and classmate Mercedes de Acosta. Parker once joked that she was asked to leave following her characterization of the Immaculate Conception as &quot;spontaneous combustion&quot;.

Her stepmother died in 1903, when Parker was nine. Parker later attended Miss Dana&#x27;s School, a finishing school in Morristown, New Jersey. She graduated in 1911, at the age of 18, according to Kinney, just before the school closed, although Rhonda Pettit and Marion Meade state she never graduated from high school. Following her father&#x27;s death in 1913, she played piano at a dancing school to earn a living while she worked on her poetry.

She sold her first poem to &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; magazine in 1914 and some months later was hired as an editorial assistant for &quot;Vogue&quot;, another Condé Nast magazine. She moved to &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; as a staff writer after two years at &quot;Vogue.&quot;

In 1917, she met a Wall Street stockbroker, Edwin Pond Parker II
(1893–1933) and they married before he left to serve in World War I with the U.S. Army 4th Division.

== Algonquin Round Table years ==
Parker&#x27;s career took off in 1918 while she was writing theater criticism for &quot;Vanity Fair,&quot; filling in for the vacationing P. G. Wodehouse. At the magazine, she met Robert Benchley, who became a close friend, and Robert E. Sherwood. The trio began lunching at the Algonquin Hotel almost daily and became founding members of what became known as the Algonquin Round Table. This numbered among its members the newspaper columnists Franklin P. Adams and Alexander Woollcott, as well as the editor Harold Ross, the novelist Edna Ferber, the reporter Heywood Broun, and the comedian Harpo Marx. Through their publication of her lunchtime remarks and short verses, particularly in Adams&#x27; column &quot;The Conning Tower&quot;, Parker began developing a national reputation as a wit.

Parker&#x27;s caustic wit as a critic initially proved popular, but she was eventually dismissed by &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; on January 11, 1920, after her criticisms had too often offended the playwright–producer David Belasco, the actor Billie Burke, the impresario Florenz Ziegfeld, and others. Benchley resigned in protest. (Sherwood is sometimes reported to have done so too, but in fact had been fired in December 1919.) Parker soon started working for &quot;Ainslee&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, which had a higher circulation. She also published pieces in &quot;Vanity Fair,&quot; which was happier to publish her than employ her, &quot;The Smart Set&quot;, and &quot;The American Mercury&quot;, but also in the popular &quot;Ladies’ Home Journal&quot;, &quot;Saturday Evening Post,&quot; and &quot;Life&quot;.

When Harold Ross founded &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 1925, Parker and Benchley were part of a board of editors he established to allay the concerns of his investors. Parker&#x27;s first piece for the magazine was published in its second issue. She became famous for her short, viciously humorous poems, many highlighting ludicrous aspects of her many (largely unsuccessful) romantic affairs and others wistfully considering the appeal of suicide.

The next 15 years were Parker&#x27;s period of greatest productivity and success. In the 1920s alone she published some 300 poems and free verses in &quot;Vanity Fair,&quot; &quot;Vogue,&quot; &quot;The Conning Tower&quot; and &quot;The New Yorker&quot; as well as &quot;Life&quot;, &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;The New Republic.&quot; Her poem &quot;Song in a Minor Key&quot; was published during a candid interview with New York N.E.A. writer Josephine van der Grift.
Parker published her first volume of poetry, &quot;Enough Rope,&quot; in 1926. It sold 47,000 copies and garnered impressive reviews. &quot;The Nation&quot; described her verse as &quot;caked with a salty humor, rough with splinters of disillusion, and tarred with a bright black authenticity&quot;. Although some critics, notably &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewer, dismissed her work as &quot;flapper verse&quot;, the book helped Parker&#x27;s reputation for sparkling wit. She released two more volumes of verse, &quot;Sunset Gun&quot; (1928) and &quot;Death and Taxes&quot; (1931), along with the short story collections &quot;Laments for the Living&quot; (1930) and &quot;After Such Pleasures&quot; (1933). &quot;Not So Deep as a Well&quot; (1936) collected much of the material previously published in &quot;Rope,&quot; &quot;Gun,&quot; and &quot;Death&quot;; and she re-released her fiction with a few new pieces in 1939 as &quot;Here Lies&quot;.

Parker collaborated with playwright Elmer Rice to create &quot;Close Harmony,&quot; which ran on Broadway in December 1924. The play was well received in out-of-town previews and favorably reviewed in New York, but it closed after only 24 performances. As &quot;The Lady Next Door&quot;, it became a successful touring production.

Some of Parker&#x27;s most popular work was published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in the form of acerbic book reviews under the byline &quot;Constant Reader&quot;. Her response to the whimsy of A. A. Milne&#x27;s &quot;The House at Pooh Corner&quot; was &quot;Tonstant Weader fwowed up.&quot; Her reviews appeared semi-regularly from 1927 to 1933, were widely read, and were posthumously published in 1970 in a collection titled &quot;Constant Reader&quot;.

Her best-known short story, &quot;Big Blonde&quot;, published in &quot;The Bookman&quot;, was awarded the O. Henry Award as the best short story of 1929. Her short stories, though often witty, were also spare and incisive, and more bittersweet than comic; her poetry has been described as sardonic.

Parker eventually separated from her husband Edwin Parker, divorcing in 1928. She had a number of affairs, her lovers including reporter-turned-playwright Charles MacArthur and the publisher Seward Collins. Her relationship with MacArthur resulted in a pregnancy. Parker is alleged to have said, &quot;how like me, to put all my eggs into one bastard”. She had an abortion, and fell into a depression that culminated in her first attempt at suicide.

Toward the end of this period, Parker began to become more politically aware and active. What would become a lifelong commitment to activism began in 1927, when she became concerned about the pending executions of Sacco and Vanzetti. Parker traveled to Boston to protest the proceedings. She and fellow Round Tabler Ruth Hale were arrested, and Parker eventually pleaded guilty to a charge of &quot;loitering and sauntering&quot;, paying a $5 fine.

== Hollywood ==
In February 1932, over a breakup with boyfriend John McClain, Parker attempted suicide by swallowing barbiturates.&lt;ref name=&quot;nhL/parker-west-hollywood&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932, Parker met Alan Campbell, an actor hoping to become a screenwriter. They married two years later in Raton, New Mexico. Campbell&#x27;s mixed parentage was the reverse of Parker&#x27;s: he had a German-Jewish mother and a Scottish father. She learned that he was bisexual and later proclaimed in public that he was &quot;queer as a billy goat&quot;. The pair moved to Hollywood and signed ten-week contracts with Paramount Pictures, with Campbell (also expected to act) earning $250 per week and Parker earning $1,000 per week. They would eventually earn $2,000 and sometimes more than $5,000 per week as freelancers for various studios. She and Campbell &quot;[received] writing credit for over 15 films between 1934 and 1941&quot;.

In 1933, when informed that famously taciturn former president Calvin Coolidge had died, Parker remarked, &quot;How could they tell?&quot;

In 1935, Parker contributed lyrics for the song &quot;I Wished on the Moon&quot;, with music by Ralph Rainger. The song was introduced in &quot;The Big Broadcast of 1936&quot; by Bing Crosby.

With Campbell and Robert Carson, she wrote the script for the 1937 film &quot;A Star Is Born&quot;, for which they were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Writing—Screenplay. She wrote additional dialogue for &quot;The Little Foxes&quot; in 1941. Together with Frank Cavett, she received a &quot;Writing (Motion Picture Story)&quot; Oscar nomination for &quot;Smash-Up, the Story of a Woman&quot; (1947), starring Susan Hayward.

After the United States entered the Second World War, Parker and Alexander Woollcott collaborated to produce an anthology of her work as part of a series published by Viking Press for servicemen stationed overseas. With an introduction by W. Somerset Maugham, the volume compiled over two dozen of Parker&#x27;s short stories, along with selected poems from &quot;Enough Rope&quot;, &quot;Sunset Gun&quot;, and &quot;Death and Taxes&quot;. It was published in the United States in 1944 as &quot;The Portable Dorothy Parker&quot;. Hers is one of three volumes in the &quot;Portable&quot; series, including volumes devoted to William Shakespeare and the Bible, that had remained in continuous print as of 1976.

During the 1930s and 1940s, Parker became an increasingly vocal advocate of civil liberties and civil rights and a frequent critic of authority figures. During the Great Depression, she was among numerous American intellectuals and artists who became involved in related social movements. She reported in 1937 on the Loyalist cause in Spain for the Communist magazine &quot;New Masses&quot;. At the behest of Otto Katz, a covert Soviet Comintern agent and operative of German Communist Party agent Willi Münzenberg, Parker helped to found the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League in 1936, which the FBI suspected of being a Communist Party front. The League&#x27;s membership eventually grew to around 4,000. According to David Caute, its often wealthy members were &quot;able to contribute as much to [Communist] Party funds as the whole American working class&quot;, although they may not have been intending to support the Party cause.

Parker also chaired the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee&#x27;s fundraising arm, &quot;Spanish Refugee Appeal&quot;. She organized Project Rescue Ship to transport Loyalist veterans to Mexico, headed Spanish Children&#x27;s Relief, and lent her name to many other left-wing causes and organizations. Her former Round Table friends saw less and less of her, and her relationship with Robert Benchley became particularly strained (although they would reconcile). Parker met S. J. Perelman at a party in 1932 and, despite a rocky start (Perelman called it &quot;a scarifying ordeal&quot;), they remained friends for the next 35 years. They became neighbors when the Perelmans helped Parker and Campbell buy a run-down farm in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, near New Hope, a popular summer destination among many writers and artists from New York.

Parker was listed as a Communist by the anti-Communist publication &quot;Red Channels&quot; in 1950. The FBI compiled a 1,000-page dossier on her because of her suspected involvement in Communism during the era when Senator Joseph McCarthy was raising alarms about communists in government and Hollywood. As a result, movie studio bosses placed her on the Hollywood blacklist. Her final screenplay was &quot;The Fan,&quot; a 1949 adaptation of Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;Lady Windermere&#x27;s Fan&quot;, directed by Otto Preminger.

Her marriage to Campbell was tempestuous, with tensions exacerbated by Parker&#x27;s increasing alcohol consumption and Campbell&#x27;s long-term affair with a married woman in Europe during World War II. They divorced in 1947, remarried in 1950, then separated in 1952 when Parker moved back to New York. From 1957 to 1962, she wrote book reviews for &quot;Esquire.&quot; Her writing became increasingly erratic owing to her continued abuse of alcohol. She returned to Hollywood in 1961, reconciled with Campbell, and collaborated with him on a number of unproduced projects until Campbell died from a drug overdose in 1963.

== Later life and death ==
Following Campbell&#x27;s death, Parker returned to New York City and the Volney residential hotel. In her later years, she denigrated the Algonquin Round Table, although it had brought her such early notoriety:
Parker occasionally participated in radio programs, including &quot;Information Please&quot; (as a guest) and &quot;Author, Author&quot; (as a regular panelist). She wrote for the &quot;Columbia Workshop&quot;, and both Ilka Chase and Tallulah Bankhead used her material for radio monologues.

Parker died on June 7, 1967, of a heart attack at the age of 73. In her will, she bequeathed her estate to Martin Luther King Jr., and upon King&#x27;s death, to the NAACP. At the time of her death, she was living at the Volney residential hotel on East 74th Street.

=== Burial ===

Following her cremation, Parker&#x27;s ashes were unclaimed for several years. Finally, in 1973, the crematorium sent them to her lawyer&#x27;s office; by then he had retired, and the ashes remained in his colleague Paul O&#x27;Dwyer&#x27;s filing cabinet for about 17 years. In 1988, O&#x27;Dwyer brought this to public attention, with the aid of celebrity columnist Liz Smith; after some discussion, the NAACP claimed Parker&#x27;s remains and designed a memorial garden for them outside its Baltimore headquarters. The plaque read:


In early 2020, the NAACP moved its headquarters to downtown Baltimore and how this might affect Parker&#x27;s ashes became the topic of much speculation, especially after the NAACP formally announced it would later move to Washington, D.C.

The NAACP restated that Parker&#x27;s ashes would ultimately be where her family wished. &quot;It’s important to us that we do this right,&quot; said the NAACP.

Relatives called for the ashes to be moved to the family&#x27;s plot in Woodlawn Cemetery, in the Bronx, where a place had been reserved for Parker by her father. On August 18, 2020, Parker&#x27;s urn was exhumed. &quot;Two executives from the N.A.A.C.P. spoke, and a rabbi who had attended her initial burial said Kaddish.&quot; On August 22, 2020, Parker was re-buried privately in Woodlawn, with the possibility of a more public ceremony later. &quot;Her legacy means a lot,&quot; added representatives from the NAACP.

== Honors ==

On August 22, 1992, the 99th anniversary of Parker&#x27;s birth, the United States Postal Service issued a 29¢ U.S. commemorative postage stamp in the Literary Arts series. The Algonquin Round Table, as well as the number of other literary and theatrical greats who lodged at the hotel, contributed to the Algonquin Hotel&#x27;s being designated in 1987 as a New York City Historic Landmark. In 1996, the hotel was designated as a National Literary Landmark by the Friends of Libraries USA, based on the contributions of Parker and other members of the Round Table. The organization&#x27;s bronze plaque is attached to the front of the hotel. Parker&#x27;s birthplace at the Jersey Shore was also designated a National Literary Landmark by Friends of Libraries USA in 2005 and a bronze plaque marks the former site of her family house.

In 2014, Parker was elected to the New Jersey Hall of Fame.

== In popular culture ==
Parker inspired a number of fictional characters in several plays of her day. These included &quot;Lily Malone&quot; in Philip Barry&#x27;s &quot;Hotel Universe&quot; (1932), &quot;Mary Hilliard&quot; (played by Ruth Gordon) in George Oppenheimer&#x27;s &quot;Here Today&quot; (1932), &quot;Paula Wharton&quot; in Gordon&#x27;s 1944 play &quot;Over Twenty-one&quot; (directed by George S. Kaufman), and &quot;Julia Glenn&quot; in the Kaufman–Moss Hart collaboration &quot;Merrily We Roll Along&quot; (1934). Kaufman&#x27;s representation of her in &quot;Merrily We Roll Along&quot; led Parker, once his Round Table compatriot, to despise him. She also was portrayed as &quot;Daisy Lester&quot; in Charles Brackett&#x27;s 1934 novel &quot;Entirely Surrounded&quot;. She is mentioned in the original introductory lyrics in Cole Porter&#x27;s song &quot;Just One of Those Things&quot; from the 1935 Broadway musical &quot;Jubilee&quot;, which have been retained in the standard interpretation of the song as part of the Great American Songbook.

Parker is a character in the novel &quot;The Dorothy Parker Murder Case&quot; by George Baxt (1984), in a series of &quot;Algonquin Round Table Mysteries&quot; by J. J. Murphy (2011– ), and in Ellen Meister&#x27;s novel &quot;Farewell, Dorothy Parker&quot; (2013). She is the main character in &quot;Love For Miss Dottie&quot;, a short story by Larry N Mayer, which was selected by writer Mary Gaitskill for the collection &quot;Best New American Voices 2009&quot; (Harcourt).

She has been portrayed on film and television by Dolores Sutton in &quot;F. Scott Fitzgerald in Hollywood&quot; (1976), Rosemary Murphy in &quot;Julia&quot; (1977), Bebe Neuwirth in &quot;Dash and Lilly&quot; (1999), and Jennifer Jason Leigh in &quot;Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle&quot; (1994). Neuwirth was nominated for an Emmy Award for her performance, and Leigh received a number of awards and nominations, including a Golden Globe nomination.

Television creator Amy Sherman-Palladino named her production company &#x27;Dorothy Parker Drank Here Productions&#x27; in tribute to Parker.

Tucson actress Lesley Abrams wrote and performed the one-woman show &quot;Dorothy Parker&#x27;s Last Call&quot; in 2009 in Tucson, Arizona, presented by the Winding Road Theater Ensemble. She reprised the role at the Live Theatre Workshop in Tucson in 2014. The play was selected to be part of the Capital Fringe Festival in DC in 2010.

In 2018, American drag queen Miz Cracker played Parker in the celebrity-impersonation game show episode of the Season 10 of &quot;Rupaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot;.

In the 2018 film &quot;Can You Ever Forgive Me?&quot; (based on the 2008 memoir of the same name), Melissa McCarthy plays Lee Israel, an author who for a time forged original letters in Dorothy Parker&#x27;s name.

== 2007 Dorothy Parker Copyright Trial ==
In &quot;Silverstein v. Penguin Putnam, Inc,&quot; the plaintiff claimed copyright in certain Parker poems that had been reproduced in Penguin&#x27;s &quot;Dorothy Parker: Complete Poems&quot; after appearing in &quot;Not Much Fun&quot;, a volume edited by Silverstein that had been the first collection to include these particular poems. 

== Adaptations ==

In 1982, Anni-Frid Lyngstad recorded &quot;Threnody&quot;, set to music by Per Gessle, for her third solo album &quot;Something&#x27;s Going On&quot;, after she offered him a book of poems by Dorothy Parker.

In the 2010s some of her poems from the early 20th century have been set to music by the composer Marcus Paus as the operatic song cycle &quot;Hate Songs for Mezzo-Soprano and Orchestra&quot; (2014); Paus&#x27;s &quot;Hate Songs&quot; was described by musicologist Ralph P. Locke as &quot;one of the most engaging works&quot; in recent years; &quot;the cycle expresses Parker&#x27;s favorite theme: how awful human beings are, especially the male of the species&quot;.

With the authorization of the NAACP, lyrics taken from her book of poetry &quot;Not So Deep as a Well&quot; were used in 2014 by Canadian singer Myriam Gendron to create a folk album of the same title. Also in 2014, Chicago jazz bassist/singer/composer Katie Ernst issued her album &quot;Little Words&quot;, consisting of her authorized settings of seven of Parker&#x27;s poems.

In 2021 her book &quot;Men I&#x27;m Not Married To&quot; was adapted as an opera of the same name by composer Lisa DeSpain and librettist Rachel J. Peters. It premiered virtually as part of Operas in Place and Virtual Festival of New Operas commissioned by Baldwin Wallace Conservatory Voice Performance, Cleveland Opera Theater, and On Site Opera on February 18, 2021.

<doc id="8783" wikidata="Q191023" url="?curid=8783" title="Dylan Thomas">
<text>Dylan Marlais Thomas (27 October 1914 – 9 November 1953) was a Welsh poet and writer, whose works include the poems &quot;Do not go gentle into that good night&quot; and &quot;And death shall have no dominion&quot;, as well as the &quot;play for voices&quot; &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;. He also wrote stories and radio broadcasts such as &quot;A Child&#x27;s Christmas in Wales&quot; and &quot;Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog&quot;. He became widely popular in his lifetime; and remained so after his death at the age of 39 in New York City. By then, he had acquired a reputation, which he had encouraged, as a &quot;roistering, drunken and doomed poet&quot;.

Dylan Thomas was born in Swansea, in 1914, leaving school in 1932 to become a reporter for the &quot;South Wales Daily Post&quot;. Many of his works appeared in print while he was still a teenager. In 1934, the publication of &quot;Light breaks where no sun shines&quot; caught the attention of the literary world. While living in London, Thomas met Caitlin Macnamara; they married in 1937 and had three children: Llewelyn, Aeronwy, and Colm.

He came to be appreciated as a popular poet during his lifetime, though he found earning a living as a writer difficult. He began augmenting his income with reading tours and radio broadcasts. His radio recordings for the BBC during the late 1940s brought him to the public&#x27;s attention, and he was frequently featured by the BBC as an accessible voice of the literary scene. Thomas first travelled to the United States in the 1950s; his readings there brought him a degree of fame, while his erratic behaviour and drinking worsened. During his fourth trip to New York in 1953, Thomas became gravely ill and fell into a coma. He died on 9 November, and his body was returned to Wales. On 25 November, he was interred at St. Martin&#x27;s churchyard in Laugharne, Carmarthenshire.

Appraisals of Thomas’s work have noted his original, rhythmic, and ingenious use of words and imagery. Further appraisals following on from new critical editions of his poems, have sought to explore in more depth his unique modernist poetic, setting aside the distracting legend of the &quot;doomed poet&quot;, and seeking thereby to secure his status as a major poet of the 20th century.

==Life and career==
===Early life===

Dylan Thomas was born on 27 October 1914 in Swansea, the son of Florence Hannah (&quot;née&quot; Williams; 1882–1958), a seamstress, and David John &#x27;Jack&#x27; Thomas (1876–1952), a teacher. His father had a first-class honours degree in English from University College, Aberystwyth, and ambitions to rise above his position teaching English literature at the local grammar school. Thomas had one sibling, Nancy Marles (1906–1953), who was eight years his senior.

At the 1921 census, Nancy and Dylan are noted as speaking both Welsh and English. Their parents were also bilingual in English and Welsh, and Jack Thomas taught Welsh at evening classes. One of their Swansea relations has recalled that, at home, &quot;Both Auntie Florrie and Uncle Jack always spoke Welsh.&quot; There are three accounts from the 1940s of Dylan singing Welsh hymns and songs, and of speaking a little Welsh.

Thomas&#x27;s father chose the name Dylan, which could be translated as &quot;son of the sea&quot; after Dylan ail Don, a character in &quot;The Mabinogion&quot;. His middle name, Marlais, was given in honour of his great-uncle, William Thomas, a Unitarian minister and poet whose bardic name was Gwilym Marles. Dylan, pronounced [ˈdəlan] (Dull-an) in Welsh, caused his mother to worry that he might be teased as the &quot;dull one&quot;. When he broadcast on Welsh BBC early in his career, he was introduced using this pronunciation. Thomas favoured the Anglicised pronunciation and gave instructions that it should be Dillan .

The red-brick semi-detached house at 5 Cwmdonkin Drive (in the respectable area of the Uplands), in which Thomas was born and lived until he was 23, had been bought by his parents a few months before his birth.

====Childhood====
Thomas has written a number of accounts of his childhood growing up in Swansea, and there are also accounts available by those who knew him as a young child. Thomas wrote several poems about his childhood and early teenage years, including &quot;Once it was the colour of saying&quot; and &quot;The hunchback in the park&quot;, as well as short stories such as &quot;The Fight&quot; and &quot;A Child&#x27;s Christmas in Wales&quot;.

Thomas&#x27;s four grandparents played no part in his childhood. For the first ten years or so of his life, Thomas&#x27;s Swansea aunts and uncles helped with his upbringing. These were his mother&#x27;s three siblings, Polly and Bob, who lived in the St Thomas district of Swansea and Theodosia, and her husband, the Rev. David Rees, in Newton, Swansea, where parishioners recall Thomas sometimes staying for a month or so at a time. All four aunts and uncles spoke Welsh and English.

Thomas&#x27;s childhood also featured regular summer trips to the Llansteffan peninsula, a Welsh-speaking part of Carmarthenshire. In the land between Llangain and Llansteffan, his mother&#x27;s family, the Williamses and their close relatives, worked a dozen farms with over a thousand acres between them. The memory of Fernhill, a dilapidated 15-acre farm rented by his maternal aunt, Ann Jones, and her husband, Jim Jones, is evoked in the 1945 lyrical poem &quot;Fern Hill&quot;, but is portrayed more accurately in his short story, &quot;The Peaches&quot;. Thomas also spent part of his summer holidays with Jim&#x27;s sister, Rachel Jones, at neighbouring Pentrewyman farm, where he spent his time riding Prince the cart horse, chasing pheasants and fishing for trout.

All these relatives were bilingual, and many worshipped at Smyrna chapel in Llangain where the services were always in Welsh, including Sunday School which Thomas sometimes attended. There is also an account of the young Thomas being taught how to swear in Welsh. His schoolboy friends recalled that &quot;It was all Welsh—and the children played in Welsh...he couldn&#x27;t speak English when he stopped at Fernhill...in all his surroundings, everybody else spoke Welsh...&quot; At the 1921 census, 95% of residents in the two parishes around Fernhill were Welsh speakers. Across the whole peninsula, 13%—more than 200 people—spoke only Welsh.

A few fields south of Fernhill lay Blaencwm, a pair of stone cottages to which his mother&#x27;s Swansea siblings had retired, and with whom the young Thomas and his sister, Nancy, would sometimes stay. A couple of miles down the road from Blaencwm is the village of Llansteffan, where Thomas used to holiday at Rose Cottage with another Welsh-speaking aunt, Anne Williams, his mother&#x27;s half-sister who had married into local gentry. Anne&#x27;s daughter, Doris, married a dentist, Randy Fulleylove. The young Dylan also holidayed with them in Abergavenny, where Fulleylove had his practice.

Thomas&#x27;s paternal grandparents, Anne and Evan Thomas, lived at The Poplars in Johnstown, just outside Carmarthen. Anne was the daughter of William Lewis, a gardener in the town. She had been born and brought up in Llangadog, as had her father, who is thought to be &quot;Grandpa&quot; in Thomas&#x27;s short story &quot;A Visit to Grandpa&#x27;s&quot;, in which Grandpa expresses his determination to be buried not in Llansteffan but in Llangadog.

Evan worked on the railways and was known as Thomas the Guard. His family had originated in another part of Welsh-speaking Carmarthenshire, in the farms that lay around the villages of Brechfa, Abergorlech, Gwernogle and Llanybydder, and which the young Thomas occasionally visited with his father. His father&#x27;s side of the family also provided the young Thomas with another kind of experience; many lived in the towns of the South Wales industrial belt, including Port Talbot, Pontarddulais and Cross Hands.

Thomas had bronchitis and asthma in childhood and struggled with these throughout his life. He was indulged by his mother, Florence, and enjoyed being mollycoddled, a trait he carried into adulthood, becoming skilled in gaining attention and sympathy. But Florence would have known that child deaths had been a recurring event in the family&#x27;s history, and it is said that she herself had lost a child soon after her marriage. But if Thomas was protected and spoiled at home, the real spoilers were his many aunts and older cousins, those in both Swansea and the Llansteffan countryside. Some of them played an important part in both his upbringing and his later life, as Thomas&#x27;s wife, Caitlin, has observed: &quot;He couldn&#x27;t stand their company for more than five minutes... Yet Dylan couldn&#x27;t break away from them, either. They were the background from which he had sprung, and he needed that background all his life, like a tree needs roots.&quot;.

====Education====
Thomas&#x27;s formal education began at Mrs Hole&#x27;s dame school, a private school on Mirador Crescent, a few streets away from his home. He described his experience there in &quot;Reminiscences of Childhood&quot;:

Never was there such a dame school as ours, so firm and kind and smelling of galoshes, with the sweet and fumbled music of the piano lessons drifting down from upstairs to the lonely schoolroom, where only the sometimes tearful wicked sat over undone sums, or to repent a little crime – the pulling of a girl&#x27;s hair during geography, the sly shin kick under the table during English literature.
Alongside dame school, Thomas also took private lessons from Gwen James, an elocution teacher who had studied at drama school in London, winning several major prizes. She also taught &quot;Dramatic Art&quot; and &quot;Voice Production&quot;, and would often help cast members of the Swansea Little Theatre (see below) with the parts they were playing. Thomas&#x27;s parents&#x27; storytelling and dramatic talents, as well as their theatre-going interests, could also have contributed to the young Thomas&#x27;s interest in performance.

In October 1925, Thomas enrolled at Swansea Grammar School for boys, in Mount Pleasant, where his father taught English. There are several accounts by his teachers and fellow pupils of Thomas&#x27;s time at grammar school. He was an undistinguished pupil who shied away from school, preferring reading and drama activities. In his first year one of his poems was published in the school&#x27;s magazine, and before he left he became its editor. Thomas&#x27;s various contributions to the school magazine can be found here:

During his final school years he began writing poetry in notebooks; the first poem, dated 27 April (1930), is entitled &quot;Osiris, come to Isis&quot;. In June 1928, Thomas won the school&#x27;s mile race, held at St. Helen&#x27;s Ground; he carried a newspaper photograph of his victory with him until his death.

In 1931, when he was 16, Thomas left school to become a reporter for the &quot;South Wales Daily Post&quot;, where he remained for some 18 months. After leaving the newspaper, Thomas continued to work as a freelance journalist for several years, during which time he remained at Cwmdonkin Drive and continued to add to his notebooks, amassing 200 poems in four books between 1930 and 1934. Of the 90 poems he published, half were written during these years. In 2014 a fifth notebook, compiled between 1934 and August 1935, was discovered. There were sixteen poems with dates of revisions of their previous versions leading to major alterations in the hitherto accepted chronology of their composition dates.

====On the stage====

The stage was also an important part of Thomas&#x27;s life from 1929 to 1934, as an actor, writer, producer and set painter. He took part in productions at Swansea Grammar School, and with the YMCA Junior Players and the Little Theatre, which was based in the Mumbles. It was also a touring company that took part in drama competitions and festivals around South Wales. Between October 1933 and March 1934, for example, Thomas and his fellow actors took part in five productions at the Mumbles theatre, as well as nine touring performances. Thomas continued with acting and production throughout his life, including his time in Laugharne, South Leigh and London (in the theatre and on radio), as well as taking part in nine stage readings of &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;. The Shakespearian actor, John Laurie, who had worked with Thomas on both the stage and radio thought that Thomas would &quot;have loved to have been an actor&quot; and, had he chosen to do so, would have been &quot;Our first real poet-dramatist since Shakespeare.&quot;

Painting the sets at the Little Theatre was just one aspect of the young Thomas&#x27;s interest in art. His own drawings and paintings hung in his bedroom in Cwmdonkin Drive, and his early letters reveal a broader interest in art and art theory. Thomas saw writing a poem as an act of construction &quot;as a sculptor works at stone,&quot; later advising a student &quot;to treat words as a craftsman does his wood or stone...hew, carve, mould, coil, polish and plane them...&quot; Throughout his life, his friends included artists, both in Swansea and in London, as well as in America.

In his free time, Thomas visited the cinema in Uplands, took walks along Swansea Bay, and frequented Swansea&#x27;s pubs, especially the Antelope and the Mermaid Hotels in Mumbles. In the Kardomah Café, close to the newspaper office in Castle Street, he met his creative contemporaries, including his friend the poet Vernon Watkins and the musician and composer, Daniel Jones with whom, as teenagers, Thomas had helped to set up the &quot;Warmley Broadcasting Corporation&quot;. This group of writers, musicians and artists became known as &quot;The Kardomah Gang&quot;. This was also the period of his friendship with Bert Trick, a local shopkeeper, left-wing political activist and would-be poet, and with the Rev. Leon Atkin, a Swansea minister, human rights activist and local politician.

In 1933, Thomas visited London for probably the first time.

===London, 1933–1939===
Thomas was a teenager when many of the poems for which he became famous were published: &quot;And death shall have no dominion&quot;, &quot;Before I Knocked&quot; and &quot;The Force That Through the Green Fuse Drives the Flower&quot;. &quot;And death shall have no dominion&quot; appeared in the &quot;New English Weekly&quot; in May 1933. In May 1934, Thomas made his first visit to Laugharne, &quot;the strangest town in Wales&quot;, as he described it in an extended letter to Pamela Hansford Johnson, in which he also writes about the town&#x27;s estuarine bleakness, and the dismal lives of the women cockle pickers working the shore around him.

From 1933 onwards, poet Victor Neuburg edited a section called &quot;The Poet&#x27;s Corner&quot; in a British newspaper, the &quot;Sunday Referee&quot;. Here he encouraged new talent by awarding weekly prizes. One prize went to the then-unknown Thomas, and the publisher of the &quot;Sunday Referee&quot; sponsored and Neuburg arranged for the publication of Thomas&#x27;s first book, &quot;18 Poems&quot;, in December 1934. The anthology was published by Fortune Press, in part a vanity publisher that did not pay its writers and expected them to buy a certain number of copies themselves. &quot;18 Poems&quot; was noted for its visionary qualities which led to critic Desmond Hawkins writing that the work was &quot;the sort of bomb that bursts no more than once in three years&quot;. The volume was critically acclaimed, netting him new admirers from the London poetry world, including Edith Sitwell and Edwin Muir. When &quot;Light breaks where no sun shines&quot; appeared in &quot;The Listener&quot; in 1934, it caught the attention of three senior figures in literary London, T. S. Eliot, Geoffrey Grigson and Stephen Spender.

The following year, in September 1935, Thomas met Vernon Watkins, thus beginning a lifelong friendship. Thomas introduced Watkins, working at Lloyds Bank at the time, to his friends, now known as The Kardomah Gang. In those days, Thomas used to frequent the cinema on Mondays with Tom Warner who, like Watkins, had recently suffered a nervous breakdown. After these trips, Warner would bring Thomas back for supper with his aunt. On one occasion, when she served him a boiled egg, she had to cut its top off for him, as Thomas did not know how to do this. This was because his mother had done it for him all his life, an example of her coddling him. Years later, his wife Caitlin would still have to prepare his eggs for him.

In December 1935, Thomas contributed the poem &quot;The Hand That Signed the Paper&quot; to Issue 18 of the bi-monthly &quot;New Verse&quot;. In 1936, his next collection &quot;Twenty-five Poems&quot;, published by J. M. Dent, also received much critical praise. Two years later, in 1938, Thomas won the Oscar Blumenthal Prize for Poetry; it was also the year in which New Directions offered to be his publisher in the United States. In all, he wrote half his poems while living at Cwmdonkin Drive before moving to London. During this time Thomas&#x27;s reputation for heavy drinking developed.

By the late 1930s, Thomas was embraced as the &quot;poetic herald&quot; for a group of English poets, the New Apocalyptics. Thomas refused to align himself with them and declined to sign their manifesto. He later stated that he believed they were &quot;intellectual muckpots leaning on a theory&quot;. Despite this, many of the group, including Henry Treece, modelled their work on Thomas&#x27;s.

In the politically charged atmosphere of the 1930s Thomas&#x27;s sympathies were very much with the radical left, to the point of his holding close links with the communists; he was also decidedly pacifist and anti-fascist. He was a supporter of the left-wing No More War Movement and boasted about participating in demonstrations against the British Union of Fascists. Bert Trick has provided an extensive account of an Oswald Mosley rally in the Plaza cinema in Swansea in July 1933 that he and Thomas attended.

====Marriage====
In early 1936, Thomas met Caitlin Macnamara (1913–1994), a 22-year-old dancer of Irish and French Quaker descent. She had run away from home, intent on making a career in dance, and aged 18 joined the chorus line at the London Palladium. Introduced by Augustus John, Caitlin&#x27;s lover, they met in The Wheatsheaf pub on Rathbone Place in London&#x27;s West End. Laying his head in her lap, a drunken Thomas proposed. Thomas liked to assert that he and Caitlin were in bed together ten minutes after they first met. Although Caitlin initially continued her relationship with John, she and Thomas began a correspondence, and in the second half of 1936 were courting. They married at the register office in Penzance, Cornwall, on 11 July 1937.

In May 1938, they moved to Wales, renting a cottage in the village of Laugharne, Carmarthenshire. They lived there intermittently for just under two years until July 1941, and did not return to live in Laugharne until 1949. Their first child, Llewelyn Edouard, was born on 30 January 1939.

===Wartime 1939–1945===
In 1939, a collection of 16 poems and seven of the 20 short stories published by Thomas in magazines since 1934, appeared as &quot;The Map of Love&quot;. Ten stories in his next book, &quot;Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog&quot; (1940), were based less on lavish fantasy than those in &quot;The Map of Love&quot; and more on real-life romances featuring himself in Wales. Sales of both books were poor, resulting in Thomas living on meagre fees from writing and reviewing. At this time he borrowed heavily from friends and acquaintances. Hounded by creditors, Thomas and his family left Laugharne in July 1940 and moved to the home of critic John Davenport in Marshfield near Chippenham in Gloucestershire. There Thomas collaborated with Davenport on the satire &quot;The Death of the King&#x27;s Canary&quot;, though due to fears of libel the work was not published until 1976.

At the outset of the Second World War, worried about conscription, Thomas unsuccessfully sought employment in a reserved occupation with the Ministry of Information. However, an “unreliable lung”, as he described his chronic condition – coughing sometimes confined him to bed, and he had a history of bringing up blood and mucus – proved to be the grounds for the military authorities to allocate him a C3 category medical exemption which meant that he would be among the last to be called up for service. He would subsequently be recognised as engaged in essential war work through his role in broadcasting for the BBC and documentary film making, work he took up in 1941 after he and Caitlin moved to London, leaving their son with Caitlin’s mother at Blashford. Thomas produced film scripts for the Strand Film Company, work which provided him with a much needed financial mainstay throughout the war years and his first regular source of income since working for the &quot;South Wales Daily Post&quot;.

In February 1941, Swansea was bombed by the Luftwaffe in a &quot;three nights&#x27; blitz&quot;. Castle Street was one of many streets that suffered badly; rows of shops, including the Kardomah Café, were destroyed. Thomas walked through the bombed-out shell of the town centre with his friend Bert Trick. Upset at the sight, he concluded: &quot;Our Swansea is dead&quot;. Thomas later wrote a feature programme for the radio, &quot;Return Journey&quot;, which described the café as being &quot;razed to the snow&quot;. The programme, produced by Philip Burton, was first broadcast on 15 June 1947. The Kardomah Café reopened on Portland Street after the war.

In early 1943, Thomas began a relationship with Pamela Glendower, one of several affairs he had during his marriage. The affairs either ran out of steam or were halted after Caitlin discovered his infidelity. In March 1943, Caitlin gave birth to a daughter, Aeronwy, in London. They lived in a run-down studio in Chelsea, made up of a single large room with a curtain to separate the kitchen.

====Escaping to Wales====
The Thomas family also made several escapes back to Wales. Between 1941 and 1943, they lived intermittently in Plas Gelli, Talsarn, in Cardiganshire. Plas Gelli sits close by the River Aeron, after whom Aeronwy is thought to have been named. Some of Thomas&#x27;s letters from Gelli can be found in his &quot;Collected Letters&quot; whilst an extended account of Thomas&#x27;s time there can be found in D. N. Thomas&#x27;s book, &quot;Dylan Thomas: A Farm, Two Mansions and a Bungalow&quot; (2000). The Thomases shared the mansion with his childhood friends from Swansea, Vera and Evelyn Phillips. Vera&#x27;s friendship with the Thomases in nearby New Quay is portrayed in the 2008 film &quot;The Edge of Love&quot;.

In July 1944, with the threat in London of German flying bombs, Thomas moved to the family cottage at Blaencwm near Llangain, Carmarthenshire, where he resumed writing poetry, completing &quot;Holy Spring&quot; and &quot;Vision and Prayer&quot;.

In September that year, the Thomas family moved to New Quay in Cardiganshire (Ceredigion), where they rented Majoda, a wood and asbestos bungalow on the cliffs overlooking Cardigan Bay. It was there that Thomas wrote a radio piece about New Quay, &quot;Quite Early One Morning&quot;, a sketch for his later work, &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;. Of the poetry written at this time, of note is &quot;Fern Hill&quot;, started while living in New Quay, continued at Blaencwm in July and August 1945 and first published in October 1945

Thomas&#x27;s nine months in New Quay, said first biographer, Constantine FitzGibbon, were &quot;a second flowering, a period of fertility that recalls the earliest days…[with a] great outpouring of poems&quot;, as well as a good deal of other material. His second biographer, Paul Ferris, agreed: &quot;On the grounds of output, the bungalow deserves a plaque of its own.&quot; Thomas&#x27;s third biographer, George Tremlett, concurred, describing the time in New Quay as &quot;one of the most creative periods of Thomas&#x27;s life.&quot; Walford Davies, who co-edited the 1995 definitive edition of the play, has noted that New Quay &quot;was crucial in supplementing the gallery of characters Thomas had to hand for writing &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;.&quot;

====War poetry====
Thomas’s horror of war, foreshadowed in some of his poems of the 1930s and fuelled by his lived experience of the bombing raids and fire storms of the Blitz in London, received further expression in his poems of the war period. These include elegies for an elderly man – &quot;Among Those Killed in a Dawn Raid Was a Man Aged a Hundred&quot; (1941) – and for child victims of incendiary bombing raids in &quot;Ceremony After a Fire Raid&quot; (1944) and &quot;A Refusal to Mourn the Death, by Fire, of a Child in London&quot; (1945). They were collected in &quot;Deaths and Entrances&quot;, the fourth volume of his poetry, published in 1946. The sentiments expressed in his war poems were, according to Walford Davies, representative of “the real temper of the British people of the time – the resilience and the guts”.

=== Making films 1941–1948 ===
From September 1941 Thomas worked for the Strand Film Company in London. Strand produced films for the Ministry of Information and Thomas produced film scripts for six such films in 1942: &quot;This is Colour&quot; (on aniline dye processing), &quot;New Towns for Old&quot;, &quot;Balloon Site 568&quot; (a recruitment film), &quot;CEMA&quot; (on arts organisation), &quot;Young Farmers&quot; and &quot;Battle for Freedom&quot;. He also scripted and produced &quot;Wales – Green Mountain, Black Mountain&quot;, a British Council commission and a bi-lingual production. &quot;These Are The Men&quot; (1943) was a more ambitious piece in which Thomas&#x27;s verse accompanies Leni Riefenstahl&#x27;s footage of an early Nuremberg Rally. &quot;Conquest of a Germ&quot; (1944) explored the use of early antibiotics in the fight against pneumonia and tuberculosis. &quot;Our Country&quot; (1945) was a romantic tour of Britain set to Thomas&#x27;s poetry.

Thomas continued to work in the film industry after the war, working on feature film scripts which included: &quot;No Room at the Inn&quot; (1948), &quot;The Three Weird Sisters&quot; (1948), &quot;The Doctor and the Devils&quot; (1944 - not produced until 1985) and &quot;Rebecca&#x27;s Daughters&quot; (1948 – not produced until 1992). His screenplay for &quot;The Beach of Falesá&quot;, not produced as a film, received a BBC Radio 3 production in May 2014. Altogether in his work in the film industry Thomas produced 28 film scripts (not all of which reached production) as well as acting as producer and director in some cases. When recession overtook the film industry in the late 1940s he lost his most reliable source of income. The experience he gained in his film work was a significant factor, according to Walford Davies, in the maturation of Under Milk Wood.

===Broadcasting years 1945–1949===

Although Thomas had previously written for the BBC, it was a minor and intermittent source of income. In 1943, he wrote and recorded a 15-minute talk titled &quot;Reminiscences of Childhood&quot; for the Welsh BBC. In December 1944, he recorded &quot;Quite Early One Morning&quot; (produced by Aneirin Talfan Davies, again for the Welsh BBC) but when Davies offered it for national broadcast BBC London turned it down. On 31 August 1945, the BBC Home Service broadcast &quot;Quite Early One Morning&quot; and, in the three years beginning in October 1945, Thomas made over a hundred broadcasts for the corporation. Thomas was employed not only for his poetry readings, but for discussions and critiques.

In the second half of 1945, Thomas began reading for the BBC Radio programme, &quot;Book of Verse&quot;, broadcast weekly to the Far East. This provided Thomas with a regular income and brought him into contact with Louis MacNeice, a congenial drinking companion whose advice Thomas cherished. On 29 September 1946, the BBC began transmitting the Third Programme, a high-culture network which provided opportunities for Thomas. He appeared in the play &quot;Comus&quot; for the Third Programme, the day after the network launched, and his rich, sonorous voice led to character parts, including the lead in Aeschylus&#x27;s &quot;Agamemnon&quot; and Satan in an adaptation of &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;. Thomas remained a popular guest on radio talk shows for the BBC, who regarded him as &quot;useful should a younger generation poet be needed&quot;. He had an uneasy relationship with BBC management and a staff job was never an option, with drinking cited as the problem. Despite this, Thomas became a familiar radio voice and within Britain was &quot;in every sense a celebrity&quot;.
By late September 1945, the Thomases had left Wales and were living with various friends in London. In December, they moved to Oxford to live in a summerhouse on the banks of the Cherwell. It belonged to the historian, A. J. P. Taylor. His wife, Margaret, would prove to be Thomas&#x27;s most committed patron.

The publication of &quot;Deaths and Entrances&quot; in February 1946 was a major turning point for Thomas. Poet and critic Walter J. Turner commented in &quot;The Spectator&quot;, &quot;This book alone, in my opinion, ranks him as a major poet&quot;.

====Italy, South Leigh and Prague...====
The following year, in April 1947, the Thomases travelled to Italy, after Thomas had been awarded a Society of Authors scholarship. They stayed first in villas near Rapallo and then Florence, before moving to a hotel in Rio Marina on the island of Elba. On their return, Thomas and family moved, in September 1947, into the Manor House in South Leigh, just west of Oxford, found for him by Margaret Taylor. He continued with his work for the BBC, completed a number of film scripts and worked further on his ideas for &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;, including a discussion in late 1947 of &quot;The Village of the Mad&quot; (as the play was then called) with the BBC producer Philip Burton. He later recalled that, during the meeting, Thomas had discussed his ideas for having a blind narrator, an organist who played for a dog and two lovers who wrote to each other every day but never met.

In March 1949 Thomas travelled to Prague. He had been invited by the Czech government to attend the inauguration of the Czechoslovak Writers&#x27; Union. Jiřina Hauková, who had previously published translations of some of Thomas&#x27;s poems, was his guide and interpreter. In her memoir, Hauková recalls that at a party in Prague, Thomas &quot;narrated the first version of his radio play &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;.&quot; She describes how he outlined the plot about a town that was declared insane, mentioning the organist who played for sheep and goats and the baker with two wives.

====...and back to Laugharne====
A month later, in May 1949, Thomas and his family moved to his final home, the Boat House at Laugharne, purchased for him at a cost of £2,500 in April 1949 by Margaret Taylor. Thomas acquired a garage a hundred yards from the house on a cliff ledge which he turned into his writing shed, and where he wrote several of his most acclaimed poems. He also rented &quot;Pelican House&quot; opposite his regular drinking den, Brown&#x27;s Hotel, for his parents who lived there from 1949 until 1953.

Caitlin gave birth to their third child, a boy named Colm Garan Hart, on 25 July 1949.

In October, the New Zealand poet, Allen Curnow, came to visit Thomas at the Boat House, who took him to his writing shed and &quot;fished out a draft to show me of the unfinished &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;&quot; that was, says Curnow, titled &quot;The Town That Was Mad&quot;. This is the first known sighting of the script of the play that was to become &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;.

===America, Iran... and &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;, 1950–1953===
American poet John Brinnin invited Thomas to New York, where in February 1950 they embarked on a lucrative three-month tour of arts centres and campuses. The tour, which began in front of an audience of a thousand at the Kaufmann Auditorium of the Poetry Centre in New York, took in about 40 venues. During the tour, Thomas was invited to many parties and functions and on several occasions became drunk – going out of his way to shock people – and was a difficult guest. Thomas drank before some of his readings, though it is argued he may have pretended to be more affected by it than he actually was. The writer Elizabeth Hardwick recalled how intoxicating a performer he was and how the tension would build before a performance: &quot;Would he arrive only to break down on the stage? Would some dismaying scene take place at the faculty party? Would he be offensive, violent, obscene?&quot; Caitlin said in her memoir, &quot;Nobody ever needed encouragement less, and he was drowned in it.&quot;
On returning to Britain, Thomas began work on two further poems, &quot;In the white giant&#x27;s thigh&quot;, which he read on the &quot;Third Programme&quot; in September 1950, and the incomplete &quot;In country heaven&quot;. In October, Thomas sent a draft of the first 39 pages of &#x27;The Town That Was Mad&#x27; to the BBC. The task of seeing this work through to production as &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot; was assigned to the BBC&#x27;s Douglas Cleverdon, who had been responsible for casting Thomas in &#x27;Paradise Lost&#x27;.

Despite Cleverdon&#x27;s urgings, the script slipped from Thomas&#x27;s priorities and in January 1951 he went to Iran to work on a film for the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, an assignment which Callard has speculated was undertaken on behalf of British intelligence agencies. Thomas toured the country with the film crew, and his letters home vividly express his shock and anger with the poverty he saw around him. He also gave a reading at the British Council and talked with a number of Iranian intellectuals, including Ebrahim Golestan whose account of his meeting with Thomas has been translated and published. The film was never made, with Thomas returning to Wales in February, though his time in Iran allowed him to provide a few minutes of material for a BBC documentary, &#x27;Persian Oil&#x27;. Thomas&#x27; journey through Iran has also been the subject of the 2024 documentary film &quot;Pouring Water on Troubled Oil&quot;. The film was written and directed by Nariman Massoumi, Department of Film and Television at Bristol University, with narration by Michael Sheen.

Later that year, Thomas published two poems, which have been described as &quot;unusually blunt.&quot; They were an ode, in the form of a villanelle, to his dying father, &quot;Do not go gentle into that good night&quot;, and the ribald &quot;Lament&quot;.

Although he had a range of wealthy patrons, including Margaret Taylor, Princess Marguerite Caetani and Marged Howard-Stepney, Thomas was still in financial difficulty, and he wrote several begging letters to notable literary figures, including T. S. Eliot. Taylor was not keen on Thomas taking another trip to the United States, and thought that if he had a permanent address in London he would be able to gain steady work there. She bought a property, 54 Delancey Street, in Camden Town, and in late 1951 Thomas and Caitlin lived in the basement flat. Thomas would describe the flat as his &quot;London house of horror&quot; and did not return there after his 1952 tour of America.

====Second tour January 20 to May 16, 1952====
Thomas undertook a second tour of the United States in 1952, this time with Caitlin – after she had discovered he had been unfaithful on his earlier trip. They drank heavily, and Thomas began to suffer with gout and lung problems. The second tour was the most intensive of the four, taking in 46 engagements. The trip also resulted in Thomas recording his first poetry to vinyl, which Caedmon Records released in America later that year. One of his works recorded during this time, &quot;A Child&#x27;s Christmas in Wales&quot;, became his most popular prose work in America. The original 1952 recording of the book was a 2008 selection for the United States National Recording Registry, stating that it is &quot;credited with launching the audiobook industry in the United States&quot;.

A shortened version of the first half of &quot;The Town That Was Mad&quot; was published in &quot;Botteghe Oscure&quot; in May 1952, with the title &quot;Llareggub. A Piece for Radio Perhaps&quot;. Thomas had been in Laugharne for almost three years, but his half-play had made little progress since his time living in South Leigh. By the summer of 1952, the half-play&#x27;s title had been changed to &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot; because John Brinnin thought the title &quot;Llareggub&quot; would not attract American audiences. On 6 November 1952, Thomas wrote to the editor of &quot;Botteghe Oscure&quot; to explain why he hadn&#x27;t been able to &quot;finish the second half of my piece for you.&quot; He had failed shamefully, he said, to add to &quot;my lonely half of a looney maybe-play&quot;.

On 10 November 1952 Thomas&#x27;s last collection &quot;Collected Poems, 1934–1952&quot;, was published by Dent; he was 38. It won the Foyle poetry prize. Reviewing the volume, critic Philip Toynbee declared that &quot;Thomas is the greatest living poet in the English language&quot;. The winter of 1952/3 brought much personal tragedy: Thomas&#x27;s father died from pneumonia just before Christmas 1952; and in the Spring of 1953 his sister died from liver cancer, one of his patrons overdosed, three friends died at young ages and Caitlin had an abortion.

====Third tour 21 April to 3 June 1953====
In April 1953, Thomas returned alone for a third tour of America. He performed a &quot;work in progress&quot; version of &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;, solo, for the first time at Harvard University on 3 May. A week later, the work was performed with a full cast at the Poetry Centre in New York. He met the deadline only after being locked in a room by Brinnin&#x27;s assistant, Liz Reitell, and he was still editing the script on the afternoon of the performance; its last lines were handed to the actors as they were putting on their makeup.

During this penultimate tour, Thomas met the composer Igor Stravinsky who had become an admirer after having been introduced to his poetry by W. H. Auden. They had discussions about collaborating on a &quot;musical theatrical work&quot; for which Thomas would provide the libretto on the theme of &quot;the rediscovery of love and language in what might be left after the world after the bomb.&quot; The shock of Thomas&#x27;s death later in the year moved Stravinsky to compose his &quot;In Memoriam Dylan Thomas&quot; for tenor, string quartet and four trombones. The first performance in Los Angeles in 1954 was introduced with a tribute to Thomas from Aldous Huxley.

Thomas spent the last nine or ten days of his third tour in New York mostly in the company of Reitell, with whom he had an affair. During this time, Thomas fractured his arm falling down a flight of stairs when drunk. Reitell&#x27;s doctor, Milton Feltenstein, put his arm in plaster and treated him for gout and gastritis.

After returning home, Thomas worked on &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot; in Laugharne. Aeronwy, his daughter, noticed that his health had &quot;visibly deteriorated...I could hear his racking cough. Every morning he had a prolonged coughing attack...The coughing was nothing new but it seemed worse than before.&quot; She also noted that the blackouts that Thomas was experiencing were &quot;a constant source of comment&quot; amongst his Laugharne friends.

Thomas sent the original manuscript to Douglas Cleverdon on 15 October 1953. It was copied and returned to Thomas, who lost it in a pub in London and required a duplicate to take to America. Thomas flew to the States on 19 October 1953 for what would be his final tour. He died in New York before the BBC could record &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;. Richard Burton starred in the first broadcast in 1954, and was joined by Elizabeth Taylor in a subsequent film. In 1954, the play won the Prix Italia for literary or dramatic programmes.

=== Final tour and death in New York===

Thomas left Laugharne on 9 October 1953 on the first leg of his fourth trip to America. He called on his mother, Florence, to say goodbye: &quot;He always felt that he had to get out from this country because of his chest being so bad.&quot; Thomas had suffered from chest problems for most of his life, though they began in earnest soon after he moved in May 1949 to the Boat House at Laugharne – the &quot;bronchial heronry&quot;, as he called it. Within weeks of moving in, he visited a local doctor, who prescribed medicine for both his chest and throat.

While waiting in London before his flight, Thomas stayed with the comedian Harry Locke and worked on &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;. Locke noted that Thomas was having trouble with his chest, &quot;terrible&quot; coughing fits that made him go purple in the face. He was also using an inhaler to help his breathing. There were reports, too, that Thomas was also having blackouts. His visit to the BBC producer Philip Burton, a few days before he left for New York, was interrupted by a blackout. On his last night in London, he had another in the company of his fellow poet Louis MacNeice.

Thomas arrived in New York on 20 October 1953 to undertake further performances of &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;, organised by John Brinnin, his American agent and Director of the Poetry Centre. Brinnin did not travel to New York but remained in Boston to write. He handed responsibility to his assistant, Liz Reitell. She met Thomas at Idlewild Airport and was shocked at his appearance. He looked pale, delicate and shaky, not his usual robust self: &quot;He was very ill when he got here.&quot; After being taken by Reitell to check in at the Chelsea Hotel, Thomas took the first rehearsal of &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;. They then went to the White Horse Tavern in Greenwich Village, before returning to the Chelsea Hotel.

The next day, Reitell invited him to her apartment, but he declined. They went sightseeing, but Thomas felt unwell and retired to his bed for the rest of the afternoon. Reitell gave him half a grain (32.4 milligrams) of phenobarbitone to help him sleep and spent the night at the hotel with him. Two days later, on 23 October, at the third rehearsal, Thomas said he was too ill to take part, but he struggled on, shivering and burning with fever, before collapsing on the stage.

The following day, 24 October, Reitell took Thomas to see her doctor, Milton Feltenstein, who administered cortisone injections and Thomas made it through the first performance that evening, but collapsed immediately afterwards. &quot;This circus out there,&quot; he told a friend who had come back-stage, &quot;has taken the life out of me for now.&quot; Reitell later said that Feltenstein was &quot;rather a wild doctor who thought injections would cure anything.&quot;

At the next performance on 25 October, his fellow actors realised that Thomas was very ill: &quot;He was desperately ill…we didn&#x27;t think that he would be able to do the last performance because he was so ill…Dylan literally couldn&#x27;t speak he was so ill…still my greatest memory of it is that he had no voice.&quot;

On the evening of 27 October, Thomas attended his 39th birthday party but felt unwell and returned to his hotel after an hour. The next day, he took part in &quot;Poetry and the Film&quot;, a recorded symposium at Cinema 16.

A turning point came on 2 November. Air pollution in New York had risen significantly and exacerbated chest illnesses such as Thomas had. By the end of the month, over 200 New Yorkers had died from the smog.
On 3 November, Thomas spent most of the day in his room, entertaining various friends. He went out in the evening to keep two drink appointments. After returning to the hotel, he went out again for a drink at 2 am. After drinking at the White Horse, Thomas returned to the Hotel Chelsea, declaring, &quot;I&#x27;ve had eighteen straight whiskies. I think that&#x27;s the record!&quot; The barman and the owner of the pub who served him later commented that Thomas could not have drunk more than half that amount.

Thomas had an appointment at a clam house in New Jersey with Ruthven Todd on 4 November. When Todd telephoned the Chelsea that morning, Thomas said he was feeling ill and postponed the engagement. Todd thought he sounded &quot;terrible&quot;. The poet, Harvey Breit, was another to phone that morning. He thought that Thomas sounded &quot;bad&quot;. Thomas&#x27;s voice, recalled Breit, was &quot;low and hoarse&quot;. He had wanted to say: &quot;You sound as though from the tomb&quot;, but instead he told Thomas that he sounded like Louis Armstrong.

Later, Thomas went drinking with Reitell at the White Horse and, feeling sick again, returned to the hotel. Feltenstein came to see him three times that day, administering the cortisone secretant ACTH by injection (a tropic peptide hormone produced and secreted by the anterior pituitary gland) and, on his third visit, half a grain (32.4 milligrams) of morphine sulphate. This amount was three times more than was medically appropriate and was, by affecting Thomas&#x27;s breathing and consequently the oxygen supply to his brain, the precipitating cause of his death. After Reitell became increasingly concerned and telephoned Feltenstein for advice he suggested she get male assistance, so she called upon the painter Jack Heliker, who arrived before 11 pm. At midnight on 5 November, Thomas&#x27;s breathing became more difficult and his face turned blue. Reitell phoned Feltenstein who arrived at the hotel at about 1 am, and called for an ambulance. It then took another hour for the ambulance to arrive at St. Vincent&#x27;s, even though it was only a few blocks from the Chelsea.

Thomas was admitted to the emergency ward at St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital at 1:58 am. He was comatose, and his medical notes state that &quot;the impression upon admission was acute alcoholic encephalopathy damage to the brain by alcohol, for which the patient was treated without response&quot;. Feltenstein then took control of Thomas&#x27;s care, even though he did not have admitting rights at St. Vincent&#x27;s. The hospital&#x27;s senior brain specialist, C.G. Gutierrez-Mahoney, was not called to examine Thomas until the afternoon of 6 November, some 36 hours after Thomas&#x27;s admission.

Caitlin, having flown from Britain, arrived at the hospital the following morning, by which time a tracheotomy had been performed. Her first words are reported to have been, &quot;Is the bloody man dead yet?&quot; Permitted to see Thomas for a short time, she returned, drunk, in the afternoon and made threats to John Brinnin. Feltenstein had her put into a straitjacket and committed to the River Crest Sanitarium.

It is now believed that Thomas had been suffering from bronchitis, pneumonia, emphysema and asthma before his admission to St Vincent&#x27;s. In their 2004 paper, &quot;Death by Neglect&quot;, D. N. Thomas and former GP Principal Simon Barton disclose that Thomas was found to have pneumonia when he was admitted to hospital in a coma. Doctors took three hours to restore his breathing, using artificial respiration and oxygen. Summarising their findings, they conclude: &quot;The medical notes indicate that, on admission, Dylan&#x27;s bronchial disease was found to be very extensive, affecting upper, mid and lower lung fields, both left and right.&quot; The forensic pathologist, Bernard Knight, who examined the post-mortem report, concurs: &quot;death was clearly due to a severe lung infection with extensive advanced bronchopneumonia...the severity of the chest infection, with greyish consolidated areas of well-established pneumonia, suggests that it had started before admission to hospital.&quot;

Thomas died at noon on 9 November, having never recovered from his coma. A nurse, and the poet John Berryman, were present with him at the time of death.

===Aftermath===
Rumours circulated of a brain haemorrhage, followed by competing reports of a mugging or even that Thomas had drunk himself to death. Later, speculation arose about drugs and diabetes. At the post-mortem, the pathologist found three causes of death – pneumonia, brain swelling and a fatty liver. His liver showed no sign of cirrhosis.

The publication of John Brinnin&#x27;s 1955 biography &quot;Dylan Thomas in America&quot; cemented Thomas&#x27;s reputation as a &quot;roistering, drunken and doomed poet&quot;; Brinnin focuses on Thomas&#x27;s last few years and paints a picture of him as a drunk and a philanderer. Later biographies have criticised Brinnin&#x27;s view, especially his coverage of Thomas&#x27;s death. David Thomas in &quot;Fatal Neglect: Who Killed Dylan Thomas?&quot; writes that Brinnin, along with Reitell and Feltenstein, were culpable. FitzGibbon&#x27;s 1965 biography ignores Thomas&#x27;s heavy drinking and skims over his death, giving just two pages in his detailed book to Thomas&#x27;s demise. Ferris in his 1989 biography includes Thomas&#x27;s heavy drinking, but is more critical of those around him in his final days and does not draw the conclusion that he drank himself to death. Many sources have criticised Feltenstein&#x27;s role and actions, especially his incorrect diagnosis of delirium tremens and the high dose of morphine he administered. Dr C. G. de Gutierrez-Mahoney, the doctor who treated Thomas while at St. Vincents, concluded that Feltenstein&#x27;s failure to see that Thomas was gravely ill and have him admitted to hospital sooner &quot;was even more culpable than his use of morphine&quot;.

Caitlin Thomas&#x27;s autobiographies, &quot;Leftover Life to Kill&quot; (1957) and &quot;My Life with Dylan Thomas: Double Drink Story&quot; (1997), describe the effects of alcohol on him and their relationship. &quot;Ours was not only a love story, it was a drink story, because without alcohol it would never had got on its rocking feet&quot;, she wrote, and &quot;The bar was our altar.&quot; Biographer Andrew Lycett ascribed the decline in Thomas&#x27;s health to an alcoholic co-dependent relationship with his wife, who deeply resented his extramarital affairs. In contrast, Dylan biographers Andrew Sinclair and George Tremlett express the view that Thomas was not an alcoholic. Tremlett argues that many of Thomas&#x27;s health issues stemmed from undiagnosed diabetes.

Thomas died intestate, with assets worth £100. His body was brought back to Wales for burial in the village churchyard at Laugharne. Thomas&#x27;s funeral, which Brinnin did not attend, took place at St Martin&#x27;s Church in Laugharne on 24 November. Six friends from the village carried Thomas&#x27;s coffin. Caitlin, without her customary hat, walked behind the coffin, with his childhood friend Daniel Jones at her arm and her mother by her side. The procession to the church was filmed and the wake took place at Brown&#x27;s Hotel. Thomas&#x27;s fellow poet and long-time friend Vernon Watkins wrote &quot;The Times&quot; obituary.

Thomas&#x27;s widow, Caitlin, died in 1994 and was buried alongside him. Thomas&#x27;s father, &quot;DJ&quot;, died on 16 December 1952 and his mother Florence in August 1958. Thomas&#x27;s elder son, Llewelyn, died in 2000, his daughter, Aeronwy in 2009, and his younger son, Colm, in 2012.

==Poetry==
===Poetic style and influences===
Thomas&#x27;s refusal to align with any literary group or movement has made him and his work difficult to categorise. However the formative influence of the modernist symbolist and surrealist movements has been discerned throughout his poetic output and as especially evident in his poetry of the 1930s, the period in which he forged a unique modernist poetic which rejected the referential, discursive and often propagandist voice of his contemporaries for a relish of exuberant word-play and language itself.

Thomas took his major theme as the unity of all life in which the turmoil of sexuality and death linked the generations, envisaging men and women locked in cycles of growth, love, procreation, new growth, death, and new life. Thomas derived his imagery from sources which include the new scientific accounts of physiology and sexuality, the Bible, Welsh folklore, and Sigmund Freud as well as from the established literary canon.

Whereas earlier appraisals of his work have found an impasse in its obscurity 
 more recent accounts have given readings which have explored in depth the complexity of Thomas’s allusions, accepting that obscurity, paradox and ambiguity are integral to his work. As Thomas wrote in a letter to Glyn Jones: &quot;My own obscurity is quite an unfashionable one, based, as it is, on a preconceived symbolism derived (I&#x27;m afraid all this sounds wooly and pretentious) from the cosmic significance of the human anatomy”. 
Distinguishing features of Thomas&#x27;s early poetry include its verbal density, use of alliteration, sprung rhythm and internal rhyme, with some critics detecting the influence of the English poet Gerard Manley Hopkins. Walford Davies suggests there is little else than “a coincidence of poetic temprament.” Thomas himself wrote to Henry Treece, who had compared the two, denying any significant influence. Thomas also employed fixed verse form, such as in the villanelle &quot;Do not go gentle into that good night&quot;.

Thomas greatly admired Thomas Hardy, who is regarded as an influence. When Thomas travelled in America, he recited some of Hardy&#x27;s work in his readings. Other poets from whom critics believe Thomas drew influence include James Joyce, Arthur Rimbaud and D. H. Lawrence. William York Tindall, in his 1962 study, &quot;A Reader&#x27;s Guide to Dylan Thomas&quot;, finds comparison between Thomas&#x27;s and Joyce&#x27;s wordplay, while he notes the themes of rebirth and nature are common to the works of Lawrence and Thomas. Although Thomas described himself as the &quot;Rimbaud of Cwmdonkin Drive&quot;, he stated that the phrase &quot;Swansea&#x27;s Rimbaud&quot; was coined by poet Roy Campbell. Critics have explored the origins of Thomas&#x27;s mythological pasts in his works such as &quot;The Orchards&quot;, which Ann Elizabeth Mayer believes reflects the Welsh myths of the &quot;Mabinogion&quot;.
Thomas&#x27;s poetry is notable for its musicality, most clear in &quot;Fern Hill&quot;, &quot;In Country Sleep&quot;, &quot;Ballad of the Long-legged Bait&quot; and &quot;In the White Giant&#x27;s Thigh&quot;.

In 1951, in response to an American student&#x27;s question, Thomas alluded to the formative influence of the nursery rhymes which his parents taught him when he was a child:
Thomas became an accomplished writer of prose poetry, with collections such as &quot;Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog&quot; (1940) and &quot;Quite Early One Morning&quot; (1954) showing he was capable of writing moving short stories. His first published prose work, &quot;After the Fair&quot;, appeared in &quot;The New English Weekly&quot; on 15 March 1934. Jacob Korg believes that one can classify Thomas&#x27;s fiction work into two main bodies: vigorous fantasies in a poetic style and, after 1939, more straightforward narratives. Korg surmises that Thomas approached his prose writing as an alternate poetic form, which allowed him to produce complex, involuted narratives that do not allow the reader to rest.

===Welsh poet===
 Thomas disliked being regarded as a provincial poet and decried any notion of &#x27;Welshness&#x27; in his poetry. When he wrote to Stephen Spender in 1952, thanking him for a review of his &quot;Collected Poems&quot;, he added &quot;Oh, &amp; I forgot. I&#x27;m not influenced by Welsh bardic poetry. I can&#x27;t read Welsh.&quot; Despite this his work was rooted in the geography of Wales. Thomas acknowledged that he returned to Wales when he had difficulty writing, and John Ackerman argues that &quot;His inspiration and imagination were rooted in his Welsh background&quot;. Caitlin Thomas wrote that he worked &quot;in a fanatically narrow groove, although there was nothing narrow about the depth and understanding of his feelings. The groove of direct hereditary descent in the land of his birth, which he never in thought, and hardly in body, moved out of.&quot;

Head of Programmes Wales at the BBC, Aneirin Talfan Davies, who commissioned several of Thomas&#x27;s early radio talks, believed that the poet&#x27;s &quot;whole attitude is that of the medieval bards.&quot; Kenneth O. Morgan counter-argues that it is a &#x27;difficult enterprise&#x27; to find traces of &quot;cynghanedd&quot; (consonant harmony) or &quot;cerdd dafod&quot; (tongue-craft) in Thomas&#x27;s poetry. Instead he believes his work, especially his earlier more autobiographical poems, are rooted in a changing country which echoes the Welshness of the past and the Anglicisation of the new industrial nation: &quot;rural and urban, chapel-going and profane, Welsh and English, Unforgiving and deeply compassionate.&quot; Fellow poet and critic Glyn Jones believed that any traces of &quot;cynghanedd&quot; in Thomas&#x27;s work were accidental, although he felt Thomas consciously employed one element of Welsh metrics; that of counting syllables per line instead of feet. Constantine Fitzgibbon, who was his first in-depth biographer, wrote &quot;No major English poet has ever been as Welsh as Dylan&quot;.

Although Thomas had a deep connection with Wales, he disliked Welsh nationalism. He once wrote, &quot;Land of my fathers, and my fathers can keep it&quot;. While often attributed to Thomas himself, this line actually comes from the character Owen Morgan-Vaughan, in the screenplay Thomas wrote for the 1948 British melodrama &quot;The Three Weird Sisters&quot;. Robert Pocock, a friend from the BBC, recalled &quot;I only once heard Dylan express an opinion on Welsh Nationalism. He used three words. Two of them were Welsh Nationalism.&quot; Although not expressed as strongly, Glyn Jones believed that he and Thomas&#x27;s friendship cooled in the later years as he had not &#x27;rejected enough&#x27; of the elements that Thomas disliked – &quot;Welsh nationalism and a sort of hill farm morality&quot;. Apologetically, in a letter to Keidrych Rhys, editor of the literary magazine &quot;Wales&quot;, Thomas&#x27;s father wrote that he was &quot;afraid Dylan isn&#x27;t much of a Welshman&quot;. Though FitzGibbon asserts that Thomas&#x27;s negativity towards Welsh nationalism was fostered by his father&#x27;s hostility towards the Welsh language.

==Critical reception==
Thomas&#x27;s work and stature as a poet have been much debated by critics and biographers since his death. Critical studies have been clouded by Thomas&#x27;s personality and mythology, especially his drunken persona and death in New York. When Seamus Heaney gave an Oxford lecture on the poet he opened by addressing the assembly, &quot;Dylan Thomas is now as much a case history as a chapter in the history of poetry&quot;, querying how &quot;Thomas the Poet&quot; is one of his forgotten attributes. David Holbrook, who has written three books about Thomas, stated in his 1962 publication &quot;Llareggub Revisited&quot;, &quot;the strangest feature of Dylan Thomas&#x27;s notoriety—not that he is bogus, but that attitudes to poetry attached themselves to him which not only threaten the prestige, effectiveness and accessibility to English poetry but also destroyed his true voice and, at last, him.&quot; The Poetry Archive notes that &quot;Dylan Thomas&#x27;s detractors accuse him of being drunk on language as well as whiskey, but whilst there&#x27;s no doubt that the sound of language is central to his style, he was also a disciplined writer who re-drafted obsessively&quot;.

Many critics have argued that Thomas&#x27;s work is too narrow and that he suffers from verbal extravagance. Those that have championed his work have found the criticism baffling. Robert Lowell wrote in 1947: &quot;Nothing could be more wrongheaded than the English disputes about Dylan Thomas&#x27;s greatness ... He is a dazzling obscure writer who can be enjoyed without understanding.&quot; Kenneth Rexroth said, on reading &quot;Eighteen Poems&quot;: &quot;The reeling excitement of a poetry-intoxicated schoolboy smote the Philistine as hard a blow with one small book as Swinburne had with &quot;Poems and Ballads&quot;.&quot; Philip Larkin in a letter to Kingsley Amis in 1948, wrote that &quot;no one can &#x27;stick words into us like pins&#x27;... like he [Thomas] can&quot;, but followed that by stating that he &quot;doesn&#x27;t use his words to any advantage&quot;. Amis was far harsher, finding little of merit in his work, and claiming that he was &#x27;frothing at the mouth with piss.&#x27; In 1956, the publication of the anthology &quot;New Lines&quot; featuring works by the British collective The Movement, which included Amis and Larkin among its number, set out a vision of modern poetry that was damning towards the poets of the 1940s. Thomas&#x27;s work in particular was criticised. David Lodge, writing about The Movement in 1981 stated: &quot;Dylan Thomas was made to stand for everything they detest, verbal obscurity, metaphysical pretentiousness, and romantic rhapsodizing.&quot;

Despite criticism by sections of academia, Thomas&#x27;s work has been embraced by readers more so than many of his contemporaries, and he is one of the few modern poets whose name is recognised by the general public. In 2009, more than 18,000 votes were cast in a BBC poll to find the UK&#x27;s favourite poet; Thomas was placed 10th. Several of his poems have passed into the cultural mainstream, and his work has been used by authors, musicians and film and television writers. The BBC Radio programme &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;, in which guests usually choose their favourite songs, has heard 50 participants select a Dylan Thomas recording. John Goodby states that this popularity with the reading public allows Thomas&#x27;s work to be classed as vulgar and common. Goodby also cites that, despite a brief period during the 1960s when Thomas was considered a cultural icon, the poet has been marginalized in critical circles due to his exuberance, in both life and work, and his refusal to know his place. Goodby believes that Thomas has been mainly snubbed since the 1970s and has become &quot;... an embarrassment to twentieth-century poetry criticism&quot;, his work failing to fit standard narratives and thus being ignored rather than studied. In June 2022, Thomas was the subject of BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;In Our Time&quot;.

==Memorials==
In Swansea&#x27;s maritime quarter are the Dylan Thomas Theatre, home of the Swansea Little Theatre of which Thomas was once a member, and the former Guildhall, built in 1825 and now occupied by the Dylan Thomas Centre, a literature centre, where exhibitions and lectures are held and setting for the annual Dylan Thomas Festival.

Outside the centre stands a bronze statue of Thomas, by John Doubleday. Another monument to Thomas stands in Cwmdonkin Park, one of his favourite childhood haunts, close to his birthplace. The memorial is a small rock in an enclosed garden within the park cut by and inscribed by the late sculptor Ronald Cour with the closing lines from &quot;Fern Hill&quot;.
&lt;poem&gt;
:::Oh as I was young and easy in the mercy of his means
:::Time held me green and dying
:::Though I sang in my chains like the sea.
&lt;/poem&gt;
Thomas&#x27;s home in Laugharne, the Boathouse, is a museum run by Carmarthenshire County Council. His writing shed is also preserved. In 2004, the Dylan Thomas Prize was created in his honour, awarded to the best published writer in English under the age of 30. In 2005, the Dylan Thomas Screenplay Award was established. The prize, administered by the Dylan Thomas Centre, is awarded at the annual Swansea Bay Film Festival. In 1982 a plaque was unveiled in Poets&#x27; Corner, Westminster Abbey. The plaque is also inscribed with the last two lines of &quot;Fern Hill&quot;.

In 2014, the Royal Patron of The Dylan Thomas 100 Festival was Charles, Prince of Wales, who in 2013 made a recording of &quot;Fern Hill&quot; for National Poetry Day.

In 2014, to celebrate the centenary of Thomas&#x27;s birth, the British Council Wales undertook a year-long programme of cultural and educational works. Highlights included a touring replica of Thomas&#x27;s work shed, Sir Peter Blake&#x27;s exhibition of illustrations based on &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot; and a 36-hour marathon of readings, which included Michael Sheen and Sir Ian McKellen performing Thomas&#x27;s work. The same year, Thomas was among the ten people commemorated on a UK postage stamp issued by the Royal Mail in their &quot;Remarkable Lives&quot; issue.

<text>&quot;Fern Hill&quot; (1945) is a poem by the Welsh poet Dylan Thomas, first published in &quot;Horizon&quot; magazine in October 1945, with its first book publication in 1946 as the last poem in &quot;Deaths and Entrances&quot;.

==Creation==
Thomas had started writing &quot;Fern Hill&quot; in New Quay, Cardiganshire, where he lived from 4 September 1944 to July 1945. Further work was done on the poem in July and August 1945 at Blaencwm, the family cottage in Carmarthenshire. A draft was sent to a friend in late August, and then the completed poem to his publisher on 18 September 1945.

The house Fernhill is a Grade 2 listed residence just outside Llangain in Carmarthenshire. In Thomas&#x27; day, it had an orchard and fifteen acres of farmland, most of it of poor quality. Thomas had extended stays here in the 1920s with his aunt Annie and her husband, Jim Jones. They had lived at Fernhill from about 1908 to 1928, renting it from the daughter of Robert Ricketts Evans (also known as Robert Anderson Evans), an occasional hangman and public executioner who once lived in Fernhill. Thomas&#x27; own notes about Fernhill confirm that he knew the various stories about Evans the Hangman.

Thomas wrote about Fernhill (calling it Gorsehill) in his short story, &quot;The Peaches&quot;, in which he describes it as a ramshackle house of hollow fear. Fernhill&#x27;s dilapidated farmyard and buildings are also described in &quot;The Peaches&quot;. Jim Jones had shown little interest in farming, as his neighbours had noticed: there was &quot;no work in him...left Fernhill farm to ruins.&quot; Jim had sold most of his farming machinery, implements and livestock before moving to Fernhill. He had also been convicted for allowing decomposing animal carcasses to lie around his fields.

Fernhill, said an official survey, had an outside earth closet, water was carried in from a well in the farmyard, washing oneself was done in the kitchen, whilst meals were cooked on an open fire. Its two living rooms were lit by candles and paraffin lamps. The house, said the survey, had &quot;extreme rising dampness&quot; and smelt, wrote Thomas in &quot;The Peaches&quot;, &quot;of rotten wood and damp and animals&quot;.

Thomas&#x27; holidays here have been recalled in interviews with his schoolboy friends and with Annie and Jim&#x27;s neighbours. A further account describes both Thomas&#x27; childhood and later years on the family farms between Llangain and Llansteffan, as well as suggesting that the poem &quot;Fern Hill&quot; was inspired not just by the house Fernhill but by another farm as well.

==Linguistic considerations==

The poem starts as a straightforward evocation of his childhood visits to his Aunt Annie&#x27;s farm:
:Now as I was young and easy under the apple boughs
:About the lilting house and happy as the grass was green,
:The night above the dingle starry,

In the middle section, the idyllic scene is expanded upon, reinforced by the lilting rhythm of the poem, the dreamlike, pastoral metaphors and allusion to Eden. 
:All the sun long it was running, it was lovely, the hay
:Fields high as the house, the tunes from the chimneys, it was air...
:With the dew, come back, the cock on his shoulder: it was all
:Shining, it was Adam and maiden,

By the end, the poet&#x27;s older voice has taken over, mourning his lost youth with echoes of the opening:
:Oh as I was young and easy in the mercy of his means,
:Time held me green and dying
:Though I sang in my chains like the sea.

The poem uses internal half rhyme and full rhyme as well as end rhyme. Thomas was very conscious of the effect of spoken or intoned verse and explored the potentialities of sound and rhythm, in a manner reminiscent of Gerard Manley Hopkins. He always denied having conscious knowledge of Welsh, but &quot;his lines chime with internal consonantal correspondence, or &quot;cynghanedd&quot;, a prescribed feature of Welsh versification&quot;.

==Legacy==
In 1960, American composer John Corigliano set &quot;Fern Hill&quot; to music as part of &quot;A&quot; &quot;Dylan Thomas Trilogy&quot; (1960–1976), a trilogy of choral symphony. The poem is also quoted in the title of the 1973 drama film &quot;Happy as the Grass Was Green&quot; and in the lyrics of the 2022 song &quot;Blacktop&quot; by Yeah Yeah Yeahs.

<text>David Robert Jones (8 January 194710 January 2016), known professionally as David Bowie ( ), was an English singer, songwriter, musician and actor. Regarded as one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century, Bowie was acclaimed by critics and musicians, particularly for his innovative work during the 1970s. His career was marked by reinvention and visual presentation, and his music and stagecraft has had a significant impact on popular music.

Bowie developed an interest in music from an early age. He studied art, music and design before embarking on a professional career as a musician in 1963. He released a string of unsuccessful singles with local bands and a self-titled solo album (1967) before achieving his first top-five entry on the UK singles chart with &quot;Space Oddity&quot; (1969). After a period of experimentation, he re-emerged in 1972 during the glam rock era with the flamboyant and androgynous alter ego Ziggy Stardust. The character was spearheaded by the success of the single &quot;Starman&quot; and its album &quot;The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars&quot; (both 1972), which won him widespread popularity. In 1975, Bowie&#x27;s style shifted towards a sound he characterised as &quot;plastic soul&quot;, initially alienating many of his UK fans but garnering his first major US crossover success with the number-one single &quot;Fame&quot; and the album &quot;Young Americans&quot; (both 1975). In 1976, Bowie starred in the cult film &quot;The Man Who Fell to Earth&quot; and released &quot;Station to Station&quot;. In 1977, he again changed direction with the electronic-inflected album &quot;Low&quot;, the first of three collaborations with Brian Eno that came to be known as the Berlin Trilogy. &quot;&quot;Heroes&quot;&quot; (1977) and &quot;Lodger&quot; (1979) followed; each album reached the UK top-five and received lasting critical praise.

After uneven commercial success in the late 1970s, Bowie had three number-one hits: the 1980 single &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot;, its album &quot;Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)&quot; and &quot;Under Pressure&quot; (a 1981 collaboration with Queen). He achieved his greatest commercial success in the 1980s with &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; (1983). Between 1988 and 1992, he fronted the hard rock band Tin Machine before resuming his solo career in 1993. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles, including industrial and jungle. He also continued acting; his roles included Major Jack Celliers in &quot;Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence&quot; (1983), Jareth the Goblin King in &quot;Labyrinth&quot; (1986), Phillip Jeffries in &quot;Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me&quot; (1992), Andy Warhol in the biopic &quot;Basquiat&quot; (1996), and Nikola Tesla in &quot;The Prestige&quot; (2006), among other film and television appearances and cameos. He ceased touring after 2004 and his last live performance was at a charity event in 2006. He returned from a decade-long recording hiatus in 2013 with &quot;The Next Day&quot; and remained musically active until his death from liver cancer in 2016. He died two days after both his 69th birthday and the release of his final album, &quot;Blackstar&quot;.

During his lifetime, his record sales, estimated at over 100 million worldwide, made him one of the best-selling musicians of all time. He is the recipient of numerous accolades, including six Grammy Awards and four Brit Awards. Often dubbed the &quot;chameleon of rock&quot; due to his continual musical reinventions, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked him among the greatest singers, songwriters and artists of all time. As of 2022, Bowie was the best-selling vinyl artist of the 21st century.

==Early life==
David Robert Jones was born on 8 January 1947 in Brixton, London. His mother, Margaret Mary &quot;Peggy&quot; (née Burns), was born at Shorncliffe Army Camp near Cheriton, Kent. Her paternal grandparents were Irish immigrants who had settled in Manchester. She worked as a waitress at a cinema in Royal Tunbridge Wells. His father, Haywood Stenton &quot;John&quot; Jones, was from Doncaster, Yorkshire, and worked as a promotions officer for the children&#x27;s charity Barnardo&#x27;s. The family lived at 40 Stansfield Road, on the boundary between Brixton and Stockwell in the south London borough of Lambeth. Bowie attended Stockwell Infants School until he was six, acquiring a reputation as a gifted and single-minded child—and a defiant brawler.

From 1953, Bowie moved with his family to Bickley and then Bromley Common, before settling in Sundridge Park in 1955 where he attended Burnt Ash Junior School. His voice was considered &quot;adequate&quot; by the school choir, and he demonstrated above-average abilities in playing the recorder. At the age of nine, his dancing during the newly introduced music and movement classes was strikingly imaginative: teachers called his interpretations &quot;vividly artistic&quot; and his poise &quot;astonishing&quot; for a child. The same year, his interest in music was further stimulated when his father brought home a collection of American 45s by artists including the Teenagers, the Platters, Fats Domino, Elvis Presley and Little Richard. Upon listening to Little Richard&#x27;s song &quot;Tutti Frutti&quot;, Bowie later said that he had &quot;heard God&quot;.

Bowie was first impressed with Presley when he saw his cousin Kristina dance to &quot;Hound Dog&quot; soon after its release in 1956. According to Kristina, she and David &quot;danced like possessed elves&quot; to records of various artists. By the end of the following year, Bowie had taken up the ukulele and tea-chest bass, begun to participate in skiffle sessions with friends, and had started to play the piano; meanwhile, his stage presentation of numbers by both Presley and Chuck Berry—complete with gyrations in tribute to the original artists—to his local Wolf Cub group was described as &quot;mesmerizing ... like someone from another planet&quot;. Having encouraged his son to follow his dreams of being an entertainer since he was a toddler, in the late 1950s David&#x27;s father took him to meet singers and other performers preparing for the Royal Variety Performance, introducing him to Alma Cogan and Tommy Steele. After taking his eleven-plus exam at the conclusion of his Burnt Ash Junior education, Bowie went to Bromley Technical High School. It was an unusual technical school, as biographer Christopher Sandford wrote:

Bowie&#x27;s maternal half-brother, Terry Burns, was a substantial influence on his early life. Burns, who was 10 years older than Bowie, had schizophrenia and seizures, and lived alternately at home and in psychiatric wards; while living with Bowie, he introduced the younger man to many of his lifelong influences, such as modern jazz, Buddhism, Beat poetry and the occult. In addition to Burns, a significant proportion of Bowie&#x27;s extended family members had schizophrenia spectrum disorders, including an aunt who was institutionalised and another who underwent a lobotomy; this has been labelled as an influence on his early work.

Bowie studied art, music and design, including layout and typesetting. After Burns introduced him to modern jazz, his enthusiasm for players like Charles Mingus and John Coltrane led his mother to give him a Grafton saxophone in 1961. He was soon receiving lessons from baritone saxophonist Ronnie Ross.

He received a serious injury at school in 1962 when his friend George Underwood punched him in the left eye during a fight over a girl. After a series of operations during a four-month hospitalisation, his doctors determined that the damage could not be fully repaired and Bowie was left with faulty depth perception and anisocoria (a permanently dilated pupil), which gave a false impression of a change in the iris&#x27; colour, erroneously suggesting he had heterochromia iridum (one iris a different colour to the other); his eye later became one of Bowie&#x27;s most recognisable features. Despite their altercation, Bowie remained on good terms with Underwood, who went on to create the artwork for Bowie&#x27;s early albums.

==Music career==

===1962–1967: Early career to debut album===

Bowie formed his first band, the Konrads, in 1962 at the age of 15. Playing guitar-based rock and roll at local youth gatherings and weddings, the Konrads had a varying line-up of between four and eight members, Underwood among them. When Bowie left the technical school the following year, he informed his parents of his intention to become a pop star. His mother arranged his employment as an electrician&#x27;s mate. Frustrated by his bandmates&#x27; limited aspirations, Bowie left the Konrads and joined another band, the King Bees. He wrote to the newly successful washing-machine entrepreneur John Bloom inviting him to &quot;do for us what Brian Epstein has done for the Beatles—and make another million.&quot; Bloom did not respond to the offer, but his referral to Dick James&#x27;s partner Leslie Conn led to Bowie&#x27;s first personal management contract.

Conn quickly began to promote Bowie. His debut single, &quot;Liza Jane&quot;, credited to Davie Jones with the King Bees, was not commercially successful. Dissatisfied with the King Bees and their repertoire of Howlin&#x27; Wolf and Willie Dixon covers, Bowie quit the band less than a month later to join the Manish Boys, another blues outfit, who incorporated folk and soul—&quot;I used to dream of being their Mick Jagger&quot;, he recalled. Their cover of Bobby Bland&#x27;s &quot;I Pity the Fool&quot; was no more successful than &quot;Liza Jane&quot;, and Bowie soon moved on again to join the Lower Third, a blues trio strongly influenced by the Who. &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Habit of Leaving&quot; fared no better, signalling the end of Conn&#x27;s contract. Declaring that he would exit the pop music world &quot;to study mime at Sadler&#x27;s Wells&quot;, Bowie nevertheless remained with the Lower Third. His new manager, Ralph Horton, later instrumental in his transition to solo artist, helped secure him a contract with Pye Records. Publicist Tony Hatch signed Bowie on the basis that he wrote his own songs. Dissatisfied with Davy (and Davie) Jones, which in the mid-1960s invited confusion with Davy Jones of the Monkees, he took on the stage name David Bowie after the 19th-century American pioneer James Bowie and the knife he had popularised. His first release under the name was the January 1966 single &quot;Can&#x27;t Help Thinking About Me&quot;, recorded with the Lower Third. It flopped like its predecessors.

Bowie departed the Lower Third after the single&#x27;s release, partly due to Horton&#x27;s influence, and released two more singles for Pye, &quot;Do Anything You Say&quot; and &quot;I Dig Everything&quot;, both of which featured a new band called the Buzz, before signing with Deram Records. Around this time Bowie also joined the Riot Squad; their recordings, which included one of Bowie&#x27;s original songs and material by the Velvet Underground, went unreleased. Kenneth Pitt, introduced by Horton, took over as Bowie&#x27;s manager. His April 1967 solo single, &quot;The Laughing Gnome&quot;, on which speeded-up and high-pitched vocals were used to portray the gnome, failed to chart. Released six weeks later, his album debut, &quot;David Bowie&quot;, an amalgam of pop, psychedelia and music hall, met the same fate. It was his last release for two years. In September, Bowie recorded &quot;Let Me Sleep Beside You&quot; and &quot;Karma Man&quot;, both rejected by Deram and left unreleased until 1970. The tracks marked the beginning of Bowie&#x27;s working relationship with producer Tony Visconti which, with large gaps, lasted for the rest of Bowie&#x27;s career.

=== 1968–1971: &quot;Space Oddity&quot; to &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; ===

Studying the dramatic arts under Lindsay Kemp, from avant-garde theatre and mime to commedia dell&#x27;arte, Bowie became immersed in the creation of personae to present to the world. Satirising life in a British prison, his composition &quot;Over the Wall We Go&quot; became a 1967 single for Oscar; another Bowie song, &quot;Silly Boy Blue&quot;, was released by Billy Fury the following year. Playing acoustic guitar, Hermione Farthingale formed a group with Bowie and guitarist John Hutchinson named Feathers; between September 1968 and early 1969 the trio gave a small number of concerts combining folk, Merseybeat, poetry and mime.

After the break-up with Farthingale, Bowie moved in with Mary Finnigan as her lodger. In February and March 1969, he undertook a short tour with Marc Bolan&#x27;s duo Tyrannosaurus Rex, as third on the bill, performing a mime act. Continuing the divergence from rock and roll and blues begun by his work with Farthingale, Bowie joined forces with Finnigan, Christina Ostrom and Barrie Jackson to run a folk club on Sunday nights at the Three Tuns pub in Beckenham High Street. The club was influenced by the Arts Lab movement, developing into the Beckenham Arts Lab and became extremely popular. The Arts Lab hosted a free festival in a local park, the subject of his song &quot;Memory of a Free Festival&quot;.
Pitt attempted to introduce Bowie to a larger audience with the &quot;Love You till Tuesday&quot; film, which went unreleased until 1984. Feeling alienated over his unsuccessful career and deeply affected by his break-up, Bowie wrote &quot;Space Oddity&quot;, a tale about a fictional astronaut named Major Tom. The song earned him a contract with Mercury Records and its UK subsidiary Philips, who issued &quot;Space Oddity&quot; as a single on 11 July 1969, five days ahead of the Apollo 11 launch. Reaching the top five in the UK, it was his first and last hit for three years. Bowie&#x27;s second album followed in November. Originally issued in the UK as &quot;David Bowie&quot;, it caused some confusion with its predecessor of the same name, and the US release was instead titled &quot;Man of Words/Man of Music&quot;; it was reissued internationally in 1972 by RCA Records as &quot;Space Oddity&quot;. Featuring philosophical post-hippie lyrics on peace, love and morality, its acoustic folk rock occasionally fortified by harder rock, the album was not a commercial success at the time.

Bowie met Angela Barnett in April 1969. They married within a year. Her impact on him was immediate—he wrote his 1970 single &quot;The Prettiest Star&quot; for her—and her involvement in his career far-reaching, leaving Pitt with limited influence which he found frustrating. Having established himself as a solo artist with &quot;Space Oddity&quot;, Bowie desired a full-time band he could record with and could relate to personally. The band Bowie assembled comprised John Cambridge, a drummer Bowie met at the Arts Lab, Visconti on bass and Mick Ronson on electric guitar. Known as Hype, the bandmates created characters for themselves and wore elaborate costumes that prefigured the glam style of the Spiders from Mars. After a disastrous opening gig at the London Roundhouse, they reverted to a configuration presenting Bowie as a solo artist. Their initial studio work was marred by a heated disagreement between Bowie and Cambridge over the latter&#x27;s drumming style, leading to his replacement by Mick Woodmansey. Not long after, Bowie fired his manager and replaced him with Tony Defries. This resulted in years of litigation that concluded with Bowie having to pay Pitt compensation.

The studio sessions continued and resulted in Bowie&#x27;s third album, &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; (1970), which contained references to schizophrenia, paranoia and delusion. It represented a departure from the acoustic guitar and folk rock style established by his second album, to a more hard rock sound. Mercury financed a coast-to-coast publicity tour across the US in which Bowie, between January and February 1971, was interviewed by media. Exploiting his androgynous appearance, the original cover of the UK version unveiled two months later depicted Bowie wearing a dress. He took the dress with him and wore it during interviews, to the approval of critics – including &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s John Mendelsohn, who described him as &quot;ravishing, almost disconcertingly reminiscent of Lauren Bacall&quot;.
During the tour, Bowie&#x27;s observation of two seminal American proto-punk artists led him to develop a concept that eventually found form in the Ziggy Stardust character: a melding of the persona of Iggy Pop with the music of Lou Reed, producing &quot;the ultimate pop idol&quot;. A girlfriend recalled his &quot;scrawling notes on a cocktail napkin about a crazy rock star named Iggy or Ziggy&quot;, and on his return to England he declared his intention to create a character &quot;who looks like he&#x27;s landed from Mars&quot;. The &quot;Stardust&quot; surname was a tribute to the &quot;Legendary Stardust Cowboy&quot;, whose record he was given during the tour. Bowie later covered &quot;I Took a Trip on a Gemini Space Ship&quot; on 2002&#x27;s &quot;Heathen&quot;.

&quot;Hunky Dory&quot; (1971) found Visconti supplanted in both roles by Ken Scott producing and Trevor Bolder on bass. It again featured a stylistic shift towards art pop and melodic pop rock, with light fare tracks such as &quot;Kooks&quot;, a song written for his son, Duncan Zowie Haywood Jones, born on 30 May. Elsewhere, the album explored more serious subjects, and found Bowie paying unusually direct homage to his influences with &quot;Song for Bob Dylan&quot;, &quot;Andy Warhol&quot; and &quot;Queen Bitch&quot;, the latter a Velvet Underground pastiche. His first release through RCA, it was a commercial failure, partly due lack of promotion from the label. Peter Noone of Herman&#x27;s Hermits covered the album&#x27;s track &quot;Oh! You Pretty Things&quot;, which reached number 12 in the UK.

===1972–1974: Glam rock era===

Dressed in a striking costume, his hair dyed reddish-brown, Bowie launched his Ziggy Stardust stage show with the Spiders from Mars—Ronson, Bolder, and Woodmansey—at the Toby Jug pub in Tolworth in Kingston upon Thames on 10 February 1972. The show was hugely popular, catapulting him to stardom as he toured the UK over the next six months and creating, as described by David Buckley, a &quot;cult of Bowie&quot; that was &quot;unique—its influence lasted longer and has been more creative than perhaps almost any other force within pop fandom.&quot; &quot;The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars&quot; (1972), combining the hard rock elements of &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; with the lighter experimental rock and pop of &quot;Hunky Dory&quot;, was released in June and was considered one of the defining albums of glam rock. &quot;Starman&quot;, issued as an April single ahead of the album, was to cement Bowie&#x27;s UK breakthrough: both single and album charted rapidly following his July &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; performance of the song. The album, which remained in the chart for two years, was soon joined there by the six-month-old &quot;Hunky Dory&quot;. At the same time, the non-album single &quot;John, I&#x27;m Only Dancing&quot; and &quot;All the Young Dudes&quot;, a song he wrote and produced for Mott the Hoople, were successful in the UK. The Ziggy Stardust Tour continued to the United States.

Bowie contributed backing vocals, keyboards and guitar to Reed&#x27;s 1972 solo breakthrough &quot;Transformer&quot;, co-producing the album with Ronson. The following year, Bowie co-produced and mixed the Stooges&#x27; album &quot;Raw Power&quot; alongside Iggy Pop. His own &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; (1973) was his first UK number-one album. Described by Bowie as &quot;Ziggy goes to America&quot;, it contained songs he wrote while travelling to and across the US during the earlier part of the Ziggy tour, which now continued to Japan to promote the new album. &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; spawned the UK top five singles &quot;The Jean Genie&quot; and &quot;Drive-In Saturday&quot;.

Bowie&#x27;s love of acting led to his total immersion in the characters he created for his music. &quot;Offstage I&#x27;m a robot. Onstage I achieve emotion. It&#x27;s probably why I prefer dressing up as Ziggy to being David.&quot; With satisfaction came severe personal difficulties: acting the same role over an extended period, it became impossible for him to separate Ziggy Stardust—and later, the Thin White Duke—from his own character offstage. Ziggy, Bowie said, &quot;wouldn&#x27;t leave me alone for years. That was when it all started to go sour ... My whole personality was affected. It became very dangerous. I really did have doubts about my sanity.&quot; His later Ziggy shows, which included songs from both &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; and &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot;, were ultra-theatrical affairs filled with shocking stage moments, such as Bowie stripping down to a sumo wrestling loincloth or simulating oral sex with Ronson&#x27;s guitar. Bowie toured and gave press conferences as Ziggy before a dramatic and abrupt on-stage &quot;retirement&quot; at London&#x27;s Hammersmith Odeon on 3 July 1973. Footage from the final show was incorporated for the film &quot;Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars&quot;, which premiered in 1979 and commercially released in 1983.
After breaking up the Spiders, Bowie attempted to move on from his Ziggy persona. His back catalogue was now highly sought after: &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; had been re-released in 1972 along with &quot;Space Oddity&quot;. &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; was released in June 1973 and peaked at number three on the UK Singles Chart. Entering the same chart in September, his 1967 novelty record &quot;The Laughing Gnome&quot; reached number six. &quot;Pin Ups&quot;, a collection of covers of his 1960s favourites, followed in October, producing a UK number three hit in his version of the McCoys&#x27;s &quot;Sorrow&quot; and itself peaking at number one, making Bowie the best-selling act of 1973 in the UK. It brought the total number of Bowie albums concurrently on the UK chart to six.

===1974–1976: &quot;Plastic soul&quot; and the Thin White Duke===

Bowie moved to the US in 1974, initially staying in New York City before settling in Los Angeles. &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; (1974), parts of which found him heading towards soul and funk, was the product of two distinct ideas: a musical based on a wild future in a post-apocalyptic city, and setting George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; to music. The album went to number one in the UK, spawning the hits &quot;Rebel Rebel&quot; and &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot;, and number five in the US. The supporting Diamond Dogs Tour visited cities in North America between June and December 1974. Choreographed by Toni Basil, and lavishly produced with theatrical special effects, the high-budget stage production was filmed by Alan Yentob. The resulting documentary, &quot;Cracked Actor&quot;, featured a pasty and emaciated Bowie: the tour coincided with his slide from heavy cocaine use into addiction, producing severe physical debilitation, paranoia and emotional problems. He later commented that the accompanying live album, &quot;David Live&quot;, ought to have been titled &quot;David Bowie Is Alive and Well and Living Only in Theory&quot;. &quot;David Live&quot; nevertheless solidified Bowie&#x27;s status as a superstar, charting at number two in the UK and number eight in the US. It also spawned a UK number ten hit in a cover of Eddie Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Knock on Wood&quot;. After a break in Philadelphia, where Bowie recorded new material, the tour resumed with a new emphasis on soul.
The fruit of the Philadelphia recording sessions was &quot;Young Americans&quot; (1975). Sandford writes, &quot;Over the years, most British rockers had tried, one way or another, to become black-by-extension. Few had succeeded as Bowie did now.&quot; The album&#x27;s sound, which Bowie identified as &quot;plastic soul&quot;, constituted a radical shift in style that initially alienated many of his UK devotees. &quot;Young Americans&quot; was a commercial success in both the US and the UK and yielded Bowie&#x27;s first US number one, &quot;Fame&quot;, a collaboration with John Lennon. A re-issue of the 1969 single &quot;Space Oddity&quot; became Bowie&#x27;s first number-one hit in the UK a few months after &quot;Fame&quot; achieved the same in the US. He mimed &quot;Fame&quot; and his November single &quot;Golden Years&quot; on the US variety show &quot;Soul Train&quot;, earning him the distinction of being one of the first white artists to appear on the programme. The same year, Bowie fired Defries as his manager. At the culmination of the ensuing months-long legal dispute, he watched, as described by Sandford, &quot;millions of dollars of his future earnings being surrendered&quot; in what were &quot;uniquely generous terms for Defries&quot;, then &quot;shut himself up in West 20th Street, where for a week his howls could be heard through the locked attic door.&quot; Michael Lippman, Bowie&#x27;s lawyer during the negotiations, became his new manager; Lippman, in turn, was awarded substantial compensation when he was fired the following year.
&quot;Station to Station&quot; (1976), produced by Bowie and Harry Maslin, introduced a new Bowie persona, the Thin White Duke of its title track. Visually, the character was an extension of Thomas Jerome Newton, the extraterrestrial being he portrayed in the film &quot;The Man Who Fell to Earth&quot; the same year. Developing the funk and soul of &quot;Young Americans&quot;, &quot;Station to Station&quot;″s synthesiser-heavy arrangements were influenced by electronic and German krautrock. Bowie&#x27;s cocaine addiction during this period was at its peak; he often did not sleep for three to four days at a time during &quot;Station to Station&quot; recording sessions and later said he remembered &quot;only flashes&quot; of its making. His sanity—by his own later admission—had become twisted from cocaine; he referenced the drug directly in the album&#x27;s ten-minute title track. The album&#x27;s release was followed by a -month-long concert tour, the Isolar Tour, of Europe and North America. The core band that coalesced to record the album and tour—rhythm guitarist Carlos Alomar, bassist George Murray and drummer Dennis Davis—continued as a stable unit for the remainder of the 1970s. Bowie performed on stage as the Thin White Duke.
The tour was highly successful but mired in political controversy. Bowie was quoted in Stockholm as saying that &quot;Britain could benefit from a Fascist leader&quot;, and was detained by customs on the Russian/Polish border for possessing Nazi paraphernalia. Matters came to a head in London in May in what became known as the &quot;Victoria Station incident&quot;. Arriving in an open-top Mercedes convertible, Bowie waved to the crowd in a gesture that some alleged was a Nazi salute, which was captured on camera and published in &quot;NME&quot;. Bowie said the photographer caught him in mid-wave. He later blamed his pro-fascism comments and his behaviour during the period on his cocaine addiction, the character of the Thin White Duke and his life living in Los Angeles, a city he later said &quot;should be wiped off the face of the Earth&quot;. He later apologised for these statements, and throughout the 1980s and 1990s criticised racism in European politics and the American music industry. Nevertheless, his comments on fascism, as well as Eric Clapton&#x27;s alcohol-fuelled denunciations of Pakistani immigrants in 1976, led to the establishment of Rock Against Racism.

===1976–1979: Berlin era===
In August 1976, Bowie moved to West Berlin with his old friend Iggy Pop to rid themselves of their drug addictions and escape the spotlight. Bowie&#x27;s interest in German krautrock and the ambient works of multi-instrumentalist Brian Eno culminated in the first of three albums, co-produced with Visconti, that became known as the Berlin Trilogy. The album, &quot;Low&quot; (1977), was recorded in France and took influence from krautrock and experimental music and featured both short song-fragments and ambient instrumentals. Before its recording, Bowie produced Iggy Pop&#x27;s debut solo album &quot;The Idiot&quot;, described by Pegg as &quot;a stepping stone between &quot;Station to Station&quot; and &quot;Low&quot;&quot;. &quot;Low&quot; was completed in November, but left unreleased for three months. RCA did not see the album as commercially viable and was expecting another success following &quot;Young Americans&quot; and &quot;Station to Station&quot;. Bowie&#x27;s former manager Tony Defries, who maintained a significant financial interest in Bowie&#x27;s affairs, had tried to prevent the album from being released. Upon its release in January 1977, &quot;Low&quot; yielded the UK number three single &quot;Sound and Vision&quot;, and its own performance surpassed that of &quot;Station to Station&quot; in the UK chart, where it reached number two. Bowie himself did not promote it, instead touring with Pop as his keyboardist throughout March and April before recording Pop&#x27;s follow-up, &quot;Lust for Life&quot;.
Echoing &quot;Low&quot;″s minimalist, instrumental approach, the second of the trilogy, &quot;&quot;Heroes&quot;&quot; (1977), incorporated pop and rock to a greater extent, seeing Bowie joined by guitarist Robert Fripp. It was the only album recorded entirely in Berlin. Incorporating ambient sounds from a variety of sources including white noise generators, synthesisers and koto, the album was another hit, reaching number three in the UK. Its title track was released in both German and French and, though only reached number 24 in the UK singles chart, later became one of his best-known tracks. In contrast to &quot;Low&quot;, Bowie promoted &quot;Heroes&quot; extensively, performing the title track on Marc Bolan&#x27;s television show &quot;Marc&quot;, and again two days later for Bing Crosby&#x27;s final CBS television Christmas special, when he joined Crosby in &quot;Peace on Earth/Little Drummer Boy&quot;, a version of &quot;The Little Drummer Boy&quot; with a new, contrapuntal verse. RCA belatedly released the recording as a single five years later in 1982, charting in the UK at number three.
After completing &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;Heroes&quot;, Bowie spent much of 1978 on the Isolar II world tour, bringing the music of the first two Berlin Trilogy albums to almost a million people during 70 concerts in 12 countries. By now he had broken his drug addiction; Buckley writes that Isolar II was &quot;Bowie&#x27;s first tour for five years in which he had probably not anaesthetised himself with copious quantities of cocaine before taking the stage. ... Without the oblivion that drugs had brought, he was now in a healthy enough mental condition to want to make friends.&quot; Recordings from the tour made up the live album &quot;Stage&quot;, released the same year. Bowie also recorded narration for an adaptation of Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s classical composition &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot;, which was released as an album in May 1978.

The final piece in what Bowie called his &quot;triptych&quot;, &quot;Lodger&quot; (1979), eschewed the minimalist, ambient nature of its two predecessors, making a partial return to the drum- and guitar-based rock and pop of his pre-Berlin era. The result was a complex mixture of new wave and world music, in places incorporating Hijaz non-Western scales. Some tracks were composed using Eno&#x27;s Oblique Strategies cards: &quot;Boys Keep Swinging&quot; entailed band members swapping instruments, &quot;Move On&quot; used the chords from Bowie&#x27;s early composition &quot;All the Young Dudes&quot; played backwards, and &quot;Red Money&quot; took backing tracks from &quot;The Idiot&quot; &quot;Sister Midnight&quot;. The album was recorded in Switzerland and New York City. Ahead of its release, RCA&#x27;s Mel Ilberman described it as &quot;a concept album that portrays the Lodger as a homeless wanderer, shunned and victimized by life&#x27;s pressures and technology.&quot; &quot;Lodger&quot; reached number four in the UK and number 20 in the US, and yielded the UK hit singles &quot;Boys Keep Swinging&quot; and &quot;DJ&quot;. Towards the end of the year, Bowie and Angie initiated divorce proceedings, and after months of court battles the marriage was ended in early 1980. The three albums were later adapted into classical music symphonies by American composer Philip Glass for his first, fourth and twelfth symphonies in 1992, 1997 and 2019, respectively. Glass praised Bowie&#x27;s gift for creating &quot;fairly complex pieces of music, masquerading as simple pieces&quot;.

===1980–1988: New Romantic and pop era===
&quot;Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)&quot; (1980) produced the number one single &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot;, featuring the textural guitar-synthesiser work of Chuck Hammer and revisiting the character of Major Tom from &quot;Space Oddity&quot;. The song gave international exposure to the underground New Romantic movement when Bowie visited the London club &quot;Blitz&quot;—the main New Romantic hangout—to recruit several of the regulars (including Steve Strange of the band Visage) to act in the accompanying video, renowned as one of the most innovative of all time. While &quot;Scary Monsters&quot; used principles established by the Berlin albums, it was considered by critics to be far more direct musically and lyrically. The album&#x27;s hard rock edge included conspicuous guitar contributions from Fripp and Pete Townshend. Topping the UK Albums Chart for the first time since &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot;, Buckley writes that with &quot;Scary Monsters&quot;, Bowie achieved &quot;the perfect balance&quot; of creativity and mainstream success.

Bowie paired with Queen in 1981 for a one-off single release, &quot;Under Pressure&quot;. The duet was a hit, becoming Bowie&#x27;s third UK number-one single. Bowie was given the lead role in the BBC&#x27;s 1982 televised adaptation of Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s play &quot;Baal&quot;. Coinciding with its transmission, a five-track EP of songs from the play was released as &quot;Baal&quot;. In March 1982, Bowie&#x27;s title song for Paul Schrader&#x27;s film &quot;Cat People&quot; was released as a single. A collaboration with Giorgio Moroder, it became a minor US hit and charted in the UK top 30. The same year, he departed RCA, having grown increasingly dissatisfied with them, and signed a new contract with EMI America Records for a reported $17 million. His 1975 severance settlement with Defries also ended in September.
Bowie reached his peak of popularity and commercial success in 1983 with &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot;. Co-produced by Chic&#x27;s Nile Rodgers, the album went platinum in both the UK and the US. Its three singles became top 20 hits in both countries, where its title track reached number one. &quot;Modern Love&quot; and &quot;China Girl&quot; each made number two in the UK, accompanied by a pair of &quot;absorbing&quot; music videos that Buckley said &quot;activated key archetypes in the pop world... &#x27;Let&#x27;s Dance&#x27;, with its little narrative surrounding the young Aboriginal couple, targeted &#x27;youth&#x27;, and &#x27;China Girl&#x27;, with its bare-bummed (and later partially censored) beach lovemaking scene... was sufficiently sexually provocative to guarantee heavy rotation on MTV&quot;. Then-unknown Texas blues guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan guested on the album, featuring prominently on the title track. &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; was followed by the six-month Serious Moonlight Tour, which was extremely successful. At the 1984 MTV Video Music Awards Bowie received two awards including the inaugural Video Vanguard Award.

&quot;Tonight&quot; (1984), another dance-oriented album, found Bowie collaborating with Pop and Tina Turner. Co-produced by Hugh Padgham, it included a number of cover songs, including three Pop covers and the 1966 Beach Boys hit &quot;God Only Knows&quot;. The album bore the transatlantic top 10 hit &quot;Blue Jean&quot;, itself the inspiration for the Julien Temple-directed short film &quot;Jazzin&#x27; for Blue Jean&quot;, in which Bowie played the dual roles of romantic protagonist Vic and arrogant rock star Screaming Lord Byron. The short won Bowie his only non-posthumous Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video. In early 1985, Bowie&#x27;s collaboration with the Pat Metheny Group, &quot;This Is Not America&quot;, for the soundtrack of &quot;The Falcon and the Snowman&quot;, was released as a single and became a top 40 hit in the UK and US. In July that year, Bowie performed at Wembley Stadium for Live Aid, a multi-venue benefit concert for Ethiopian famine relief. Bowie and Mick Jagger duetted on a cover of Martha and the Vandellas&#x27; &quot;Dancing in the Street&quot; as a fundraising single, which went to number one in the UK and number seven in the US; its video premiered during Live Aid.

Bowie took an acting role in the 1986 film &quot;Absolute Beginners&quot;, and his title song rose to number two in the UK charts. He also worked with composer Trevor Jones and wrote five original songs for the 1986 film &quot;Labyrinth&quot;, which he starred in. His final solo album of the decade was 1987&#x27;s &quot;Never Let Me Down&quot;, where he ditched the light sound of his previous two albums, instead combining pop rock with a harder rock sound. Peaking at number six in the UK, the album yielded the hits &quot;Day-In Day-Out&quot;, &quot;Time Will Crawl&quot; and &quot;Never Let Me Down&quot;. Bowie later described it as his &quot;nadir&quot;, calling it &quot;an awful album&quot;. He supported the album on the 86-concert Glass Spider Tour. The backing band included Peter Frampton on lead guitar. Contemporary critics maligned the tour as overproduced, saying it pandered to the current stadium rock trends in its special effects and dancing, although in later years critics acknowledged the tour&#x27;s strengths and influence on concert tours by other artists, such as Prince, Madonna and U2.

===1989–1991: Tin Machine===

Wanting to completely rejuvenate himself following the critical failures of &quot;Tonight&quot; and &quot;Never Let Me Down&quot;, Bowie placed his solo career on hold after meeting guitarist Reeves Gabrels and formed the hard rock quartet Tin Machine. The line-up was completed by bassist and drummer Tony and Hunt Sales, who had played with Bowie on Iggy Pop&#x27;s &quot;Lust for Life&quot; in 1977. Although he intended Tin Machine to operate as a democracy, Bowie dominated, both in songwriting and in decision-making. The band&#x27;s 1989 self-titled debut album received mixed reviews and, according to author Paul Trynka, was quickly dismissed as &quot;pompous, dogmatic and dull&quot;. EMI complained of &quot;lyrics that preach&quot; as well as &quot;repetitive tunes&quot; and &quot;minimalist or no production&quot;. It reached number three in the UK and was supported by a twelve-date tour.

The tour was a commercial success, but there was growing reluctance—among fans and critics alike—to accept Bowie&#x27;s presentation as merely a band member. A series of Tin Machine singles failed to chart, and Bowie, after a disagreement with EMI, left the label. Like his audience and his critics, Bowie himself became increasingly disaffected with his role as just one member of a band. Tin Machine began work on a second album, but recording halted while Bowie conducted the seven-month Sound+Vision Tour, which brought him commercial success and acclaim.
In October 1990, Bowie and Somali-born supermodel Iman were introduced by a mutual friend. He recalled, &quot;I was naming the children the night we met ... it was absolutely immediate.&quot; They married in 1992. Tin Machine resumed work the same month, but their audience and critics, ultimately left disappointed by the first album, showed little interest in a second. &quot;Tin Machine II&quot; (1991) was Bowie&#x27;s first album to miss the UK top 20 in nearly twenty years, and was controversial for its cover art. Depicting four ancient nude Kouroi statues, the new record label, Victory, deemed the cover &quot;a show of wrong, obscene images&quot; and airbrushed the statues&#x27; genitalia for the American release. Tin Machine toured again, but after the live album &quot;Tin Machine Live: Oy Vey, Baby&quot; (1992) failed commercially, Bowie dissolved the band and resumed his solo career. He continued to collaborate with Gabrels for the rest of the 1990s.

===1992–1998: Electronic period===
On 20 April 1992, Bowie appeared at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, following the Queen singer&#x27;s death the previous year. As well as performing &quot;Heroes&quot; and &quot;All the Young Dudes&quot;, he was joined on &quot;Under Pressure&quot; by Annie Lennox, who took Mercury&#x27;s vocal part; during his appearance, Bowie knelt and recited the Lord&#x27;s Prayer at Wembley Stadium. Four days later, Bowie and Iman married in Switzerland. Intending to move to Los Angeles, they flew in to search for a suitable property, but found themselves confined to their hotel, under curfew: the 1992 Los Angeles riots began the day they arrived. They settled in New York instead.

In 1993, Bowie released his first solo offering since his Tin Machine departure, the soul, jazz and hip-hop influenced &quot;Black Tie White Noise&quot;. Making prominent use of electronic instruments, the album, which reunited Bowie with &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; producer Nile Rodgers, confirmed Bowie&#x27;s return to popularity, topping the UK chart and spawning three top 40 hits, including the top 10 single &quot;Jump They Say&quot;. Bowie explored new directions on &quot;The Buddha of Suburbia&quot; (1993), which began as a soundtrack album for the BBC television adaptation of Hanif Kureishi&#x27;s novel &quot;The Buddha of Suburbia&quot; before turning into a full album; only the title track &quot;The Buddha of Suburbia&quot; was used in the programme. Referencing his 1970s works with pop, jazz, ambient and experimental material, it received a low-key release, had almost no promotion and flopped commercially, reaching number 87 in the UK. Nevertheless, it later received critical praise as Bowie&#x27;s &quot;lost great album&quot;.
Reuniting Bowie with Eno, the quasi-industrial &quot;Outside&quot; (1995) was originally conceived as the first volume in a non-linear narrative of art and murder. Featuring characters from a short story written by Bowie, the album achieved UK and US chart success and yielded three top 40 UK singles. In a move that provoked mixed reactions from both fans and critics, Bowie chose Nine Inch Nails as his tour partner for the Outside Tour. Visiting cities in Europe and North America between September 1995 and February 1996, the tour saw the return of Gabrels as Bowie&#x27;s guitarist. On 7 January 1997, Bowie celebrated his half century with a 50th birthday concert at Madison Square Garden at which he was joined in playing his songs and those of his guests, Lou Reed, Dave Grohl and the Foo Fighters, Robert Smith of the Cure, Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins, Black Francis of the Pixies, and Sonic Youth.

Incorporating experiments in jungle and drum &#x27;n&#x27; bass, &quot;Earthling&quot; (1997) was a critical and commercial success in the UK and the US, and two singles from the album—&quot;Little Wonder&quot; and &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot;—became UK top 40 hits. The song &quot;I&#x27;m Afraid of Americans&quot; from the Paul Verhoeven film &quot;Showgirls&quot; was re-recorded for the album, and remixed by Trent Reznor for a single release. The heavy rotation of the accompanying video, also featuring Reznor, contributed to the song&#x27;s 16-week stay in the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Bowie received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on 12 February 1997. The Earthling Tour took place in Europe and North America between June and November. In November, Bowie performed on the BBC&#x27;s Children in Need charity single &quot;Perfect Day&quot;, which reached number one in the UK. Bowie reunited with Visconti in 1998 to record &quot;(Safe in This) Sky Life&quot; for &quot;The Rugrats Movie&quot;. Although the track was edited out of the final cut, it was later re-recorded and released as &quot;Safe&quot; on the B-side of Bowie&#x27;s 2002 single &quot;Everyone Says &#x27;Hi&#x27;. The reunion led to other collaborations with his old producer, including a limited-edition single release version of Placebo&#x27;s track &quot;Without You I&#x27;m Nothing&quot; with Bowie&#x27;s harmonised vocal added to the original recording.

===1999–2012: Neoclassicist era===

Bowie, with Gabrels, created the soundtrack for &quot;&quot;, a 1999 computer game in which he and Iman also voiced characters based on their likenesses. Released the same year and containing re-recorded tracks from &quot;Omikron&quot;, his album &quot;Hours&quot; featured a song with lyrics by the winner of his &quot;Cyber Song Contest&quot; Internet competition, Alex Grant. Making extensive use of live instruments, the album was Bowie&#x27;s exit from heavy electronica. &quot;Hours&quot; and a performance on &quot;VH1 Storytellers&quot; in mid-1999 represented the end of Gabrels&#x27; association with Bowie as a performer and songwriter. Sessions for &quot;Toy&quot;, a planned collection of remakes of tracks from Bowie&#x27;s 1960s period, commenced in 2000, but was shelved due to EMI/Virgin&#x27;s lack of faith in its commercial appeal. Bowie and Visconti continued their collaboration, producing a new album of completely original songs instead: the result of the sessions was the 2002 album &quot;Heathen&quot;.

On 25 June 2000, Bowie made his second appearance at the Glastonbury Festival in England, playing almost 30 years after his first. The performance was released as a live album in November 2018. On 27 June, he performed a concert at the BBC Radio Theatre in London, which was released on the compilation album &quot;Bowie at the Beeb&quot;; this also featured BBC recording sessions from 1968 to 1972. Bowie and Iman&#x27;s daughter, Alexandra, was born on 15 August. His interest in Buddhism led him to support the Tibetan cause by performing at the February 2001 and February 2003 concerts to support Tibet House US at Carnegie Hall in New York.
In October 2001, Bowie opened the Concert for New York City, a charity event to benefit the victims of the September 11 attacks, with a minimalist performance of Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#x27;s &quot;America&quot;, followed by a full band performance of &quot;Heroes&quot;. 2002 saw the release of &quot;Heathen&quot;, and, during the second half of the year, the Heathen Tour. Taking place in Europe and North America, the tour opened at London&#x27;s annual &quot;Meltdown&quot; festival, for which Bowie was that year appointed artistic director. Among the acts he selected for the festival were Philip Glass, Television and the Dandy Warhols. As well as songs from the new album, the tour featured material from Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Low&quot; era. &quot;Reality&quot; (2003) followed, and its accompanying world tour, the A Reality Tour, with an estimated attendance of 722,000, grossed more than any other in 2004. On 13 June, Bowie headlined the last night of the Isle of Wight Festival 2004. On 25 June, he experienced chest pain while performing at the Hurricane Festival in Scheeßel, Germany. Originally thought to be a pinched nerve in his shoulder, the pain was later diagnosed as an acutely blocked coronary artery, requiring an emergency angioplasty in Hamburg. The remaining fourteen dates of the tour were cancelled.

In the years following his recuperation from the heart attack, Bowie reduced his musical output, making only one-off appearances on stage and in the studio. He sang in a duet of his 1971 song &quot;Changes&quot; with Butterfly Boucher for the 2004 animated film &quot;Shrek 2&quot;. During a relatively quiet 2005, he recorded the vocals for the song &quot;(She Can) Do That&quot;, co-written with Brian Transeau, for the film &quot;Stealth&quot;. He returned to the stage on 8 September 2005, appearing with Arcade Fire for the US nationally televised event Fashion Rocks, and performed with the Canadian band for the second time a week later during the CMJ Music Marathon. He contributed backing vocals on TV on the Radio&#x27;s song &quot;Province&quot; for their album &quot;Return to Cookie Mountain&quot;, and joined with Lou Reed on Danish alt-rockers Kashmir&#x27;s 2005 album &quot;No Balance Palace&quot;.
Bowie was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award on 8 February 2006. In April, he announced, &quot;I&#x27;m taking a year off—no touring, no albums.&quot; He made a surprise guest appearance at David Gilmour&#x27;s 29 May concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London. The event was recorded, and a selection of songs on which he had contributed joint vocals were subsequently released. He performed again in November, alongside Alicia Keys, at the Black Ball, a benefit event for Keep a Child Alive at the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York. The performance marked the last time Bowie performed his music on stage.

Bowie was chosen to curate the 2007 High Line Festival. The musicians and artists he selected for the Manhattan event included electronic pop duo AIR, surrealist photographer Claude Cahun and English comedian Ricky Gervais. Bowie performed on Scarlett Johansson&#x27;s 2008 album of Tom Waits covers, &quot;Anywhere I Lay My Head&quot;. In June 2008, a live album was released of a Ziggy Stardust-era concert from 1972. On the 40th anniversary of the July 1969 Moon landing—and Bowie&#x27;s accompanying commercial breakthrough with &quot;Space Oddity&quot;—EMI released the individual tracks from the original eight-track studio recording of the song, in a 2009 contest inviting members of the public to create a remix. A live album from the A Reality Tour was released in January 2010.

In late March 2011, &quot;Toy&quot;, Bowie&#x27;s previously unreleased album from 2001, was leaked onto the internet, containing material used for &quot;Heathen&quot; and most of its single B-sides, as well as unheard new versions of his early back catalogue.

===2013–2016: Final years===
On 8 January 2013, his 66th birthday, his website announced a new studio album—his first in a decade—to be titled &quot;The Next Day&quot; and scheduled for release in March; the announcement was accompanied by the immediate release of the single &quot;Where Are We Now?&quot;. A music video for the single was released onto Vimeo the same day, directed by New York artist Tony Oursler. The single topped the UK iTunes Chart within hours of its release, and debuted in the UK Singles Chart at number six, his first single to enter the Top 10 for two decades (since &quot;Jump They Say&quot; in 1993). A second single and video, &quot;The Stars (Are Out Tonight)&quot;, were released at the end of February. Directed by Floria Sigismondi, it stars Bowie and Tilda Swinton as a married couple.

Recorded in secret between 2011 and 2012, 29 songs were recorded during the album&#x27;s sessions, of which 22 saw official release in 2013, including fourteen on the standard album. Three bonus tracks were later packaged with seven outtakes and remixes on &quot;The Next Day Extra&quot;, released in November. On 1 March, the album was made available to stream for free through iTunes. Debuting at number one on the UK Albums Chart, &quot;The Next Day&quot; was his first album to top the chart since &quot;Black Tie White Noise&quot;, and was the fastest-selling album of 2013 at the time. The music video for the song &quot;The Next Day&quot; created some controversy due to its Christian themes and messages, initially being removed from YouTube for terms-of-service violation, then restored with a warning recommending viewing only by those 18 or over. According to &quot;The Times&quot;, Bowie ruled out ever giving an interview again. Later in 2013, he was featured in a cameo vocal in the Arcade Fire song &quot;Reflektor&quot;. A poll carried out by BBC History Magazine in October 2013 named Bowie as the best-dressed Briton in history. The success of &quot;The Next Day&quot; saw Bowie become the oldest ever recipient of a Brit Award when he won the award for British Male Solo Artist at the 2014 Brit Awards, which was collected on his behalf by Kate Moss.

In mid-2014, Bowie was diagnosed with liver cancer, which he kept private. A new compilation album, &quot;Nothing Has Changed&quot;, was released in November. The album featured rare tracks and old material from his catalogue in addition to a new song, &quot;Sue (Or in a Season of Crime)&quot;. Bowie continued working throughout 2015, secretly recording his final album &quot;Blackstar&quot; in New York between January and May. In August, it was announced that he was writing songs for a Broadway musical based on the &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; cartoon series; the final production included a retooled version of &quot;No Control&quot; from &quot;Outside&quot;. September saw the release of the box set &quot;Five Years (1969–1973)&quot;, the first in a series of retrospective releases compiling his albums from 1969 to 1973, and a look to his &quot;transition from folk artist to glam-rock legend&quot;. He also wrote and recorded the opening title song to the television series &quot;The Last Panthers&quot;, which aired in November. The theme that was used for &quot;The Last Panthers&quot; was also the title track for &quot;Blackstar&quot;. On 7 December, Bowie&#x27;s musical &quot;Lazarus&quot; debuted in New York; he made his final public appearance at its opening night.

&quot;Blackstar&quot; was released on 8 January 2016, Bowie&#x27;s 69th birthday, and was met with critical acclaim. He died two days later, after which Visconti revealed that Bowie had planned the album to be his swan song, and a &quot;parting gift&quot; for his fans before his death. Several reporters and critics subsequently noted that most of the lyrics on the album seem to revolve around his impending death, with CNN noting that the album &quot;reveals a man who appears to be grappling with his own mortality&quot;. Visconti also said that he had been planning a follow-up album, and had written and recorded demos of five songs in his final weeks, suggesting he believed he had a few months left. The day following his death, online viewing of Bowie&#x27;s music skyrocketed, breaking the record for Vevo&#x27;s most viewed artist in a single day. &quot;Blackstar&quot; debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart; nineteen of his albums were in the UK Top 100 Albums Chart, and thirteen singles were in the UK Top 100 Singles Chart. &quot;Blackstar&quot; also debuted at number one on album charts around the world, including Australia, France, Germany, Italy, New Zealand and the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

===Posthumous releases===
In September 2016, &quot;Who Can I Be Now? (1974–1976)&quot;, the second retrospective box set, was released covering Bowie&#x27;s mid-1970s soul period; it included &quot;The Gouster&quot;, a previously unreleased 1974 album that evolved into &quot;Young Americans&quot;. An EP, &quot;No Plan&quot;, was released on 8 January 2017, which would have been Bowie&#x27;s 70th birthday. Apart from &quot;Lazarus&quot;, the EP includes three songs that Bowie recorded during the &quot;Blackstar&quot; sessions, but were left off the album and appeared on the soundtrack album for the &quot;Lazarus&quot; musical in October 2016. A music video for the title track was also released. In 2017, a third retrospective box set, &quot;A New Career in a New Town (1977–1982)&quot;, was released, comprising his &quot;Berlin&quot; era. Through the following year, a series of posthumous live albums, &quot;Cracked Actor (Live Los Angeles &#x27;74)&quot;, &quot;Live Nassau Coliseum &#x27;76&quot; and &quot;Welcome to the Blackout (Live London &#x27;78)&quot;. In the two years following his death, Bowie sold five million records in the UK alone. In their top 10 list for the Global Recording Artist of the Year, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry named Bowie the second-bestselling artist worldwide in 2016, behind Drake.

At the 59th Annual Grammy Awards in 2017, Bowie won all five nominated awards: Best Rock Performance; Best Alternative Music Album; Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical; Best Recording Package; and Best Rock Song. They were Bowie&#x27;s first Grammy wins in musical categories. In September 2018, &quot;Loving the Alien (1983–1988)&quot;, the fourth retrospective box set comprising his releases during the 1980s, was released. On 8 January 2020, on what would have been Bowie&#x27;s 73rd birthday, a previously unreleased version of &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; was released and two releases were announced: a streaming-only EP, &quot;Is It Any Wonder?&quot;, and an album, &quot;ChangesNowBowie&quot;, released in November 2020 for Record Store Day. In August, another series of live shows were released, including sets from Dallas in 1995 and Paris in 1999. These and other shows, part of a series of live concerts spanning his tours from 1995 to 1999, was released in late 2020 and early 2021 as part of the box set &quot;Brilliant Live Adventures&quot;. In September 2021, Bowie&#x27;s estate signed a distribution deal with Warner Music Group, beginning in 2023, covering Bowie&#x27;s recordings from 2000 through 2016. That November, the fifth retrospective box set, &quot;Brilliant Adventure (1992–2001)&quot;, was released, comprising his albums from the decade of 1990, and the official release of his album &quot;Toy&quot;. The latter, which was recorded in 2000, was released separatedly on what would have been Bowie&#x27;s 75th birthday. On 3 January 2022, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Bowie&#x27;s estate had sold his publishing catalogue to Warner Chappell Music, &quot;for a price upwards of $250 million&quot;.

==Acting career==

In addition to music, Bowie took acting roles throughout his career, appearing in over 30 films, television shows and theatrical productions. His acting career was &quot;productively selective&quot;, largely eschewing starring roles for cameos and supporting parts; he once described his film career as &quot;splashing in the kids&#x27; pool&quot;. He mostly chose projects with arthouse directors that he felt were outside the Hollywood mainstream, commenting in 2000: &quot;One cameo for Scorsese to me brings so much more satisfaction than, say, a James Bond.&quot; Critics have believed that, had he not chosen to pursue music, he could have found great success as an actor. Others have felt that, while his screen presence was singular, his best contributions to film were the use of his songs in films such as &quot;Lost Highway&quot;, &quot;A Knight&#x27;s Tale&quot;, &quot;The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou&quot; and &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot;.

=== 1960s and 1970s ===
Bowie&#x27;s acting career predated his commercial breakthrough as a musician. His first film was a short fourteen-minute black-and-white film called &quot;The Image&quot;, shot in September 1967. Concerning a ghostly boy who emerges from a troubled artist&#x27;s painting to haunt him, Bowie later called the film &quot;awful&quot;. From December 1967 to March 1968, Bowie acted in mime Lindsay Kemp&#x27;s theatrical production &quot;Pierrot in Turquoise&quot;, during which he performed several songs from his self-titled debut album. The production was later adapted into the 1970 television film &quot;The Looking Glass Murders&quot;. In late January 1968, Bowie filmed a walk-on role for the BBC drama series &quot;Theatre 625&quot; that aired in May. He also appeared as a walk-on extra in the 1969 film adaptation of Leslie Thomas&#x27;s 1966 comic novel &quot;The Virgin Soldiers&quot;.

Bowie&#x27;s first major film role was in Nicolas Roeg&#x27;s &quot;The Man Who Fell to Earth&quot;, in which he portrayed Thomas Jerome Newton, an alien from a dying planet. The actor&#x27;s severe cocaine addiction at the time left him in such a fragile state of mind that he barely understood the film; he later said in 1993: &quot;My one snapshot of that film is not having to act. Just being me as I was, was perfectly adequate for the role. I wasn&#x27;t of this earth at that particular time.&quot; Bowie&#x27;s role was particularly singled out for praise by film critics both on release and in later decades; Pegg argues it stands as Bowie&#x27;s most significant role. In 1978, Bowie had a starring role in &quot;Just a Gigolo&quot;, directed by David Hemmings, portraying Prussian officer Paul von Przygodski, who, returning from World War I, discovers life has changed and becomes a gigolo employed by a Baroness, playing by Marlene Dietrich. The film was a critical and commercial failure, and Bowie expressed disappointment in the finished product.

=== 1980s ===

From July 1980 to January 1981, Bowie played Joseph Merrick in the Broadway theatre production &quot;The Elephant Man&quot;, which he undertook wearing no stage make-up, earning critical praise for his performance. &quot;Christiane F.&quot;, a 1981 biographical film focusing on a young girl&#x27;s drug addiction in West Berlin, featured Bowie in a cameo appearance as himself at a concert in Germany. Its soundtrack album, &quot;Christiane F.&quot; (1981), featured much material from his Berlin albums. The following year, he starred in the titular role in a BBC adaptation of the Bertolt Brecht play &quot;Baal&quot;.

Bowie made three on-screen appearances in 1983, the first as a vampire in Tony Scott&#x27;s erotic horror film &quot;The Hunger&quot;, with Catherine Deneuve and Susan Sarandon. Bowie later said that he felt &quot;very uncomfortable&quot; with the role, but was happy to work with Scott. The second was in Nagisa Ōshima&#x27;s &quot;Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence&quot;, based on Laurens van der Post&#x27;s novel &quot;The Seed and the Sower&quot;, in which he played Major Jack Celliers, a prisoner of war in a Japanese internment camp. While the film itself received mixed reviews, Bowie&#x27;s performance was praised. Pegg places it among his finest acting performances. Bowie&#x27;s third role in 1983 was a small cameo in Mel Damski&#x27;s pirate comedy &quot;Yellowbeard&quot;, heralded by several members of the Monty Python group. Bowie also filmed a 30-second introduction to the animated film &quot;The Snowman&quot;, based on Raymond Briggs&#x27;s book &quot;The Snowman&quot;.

In 1985, Bowie had a supporting role as hitman Colin in John Landis&#x27;s &quot;Into the Night&quot;. He declined to play the villain Max Zorin in the James Bond film &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; (1985). Bowie reteamed with Julian Temple for &quot;Absolute Beginners&quot;, a rock musical film adapted from Colin MacInnes&#x27;s novel &quot;Absolute Beginners&quot; about life in late 1950s London, in a supporting role as ad man Vendice Partners. The same year, Jim Henson&#x27;s dark musical fantasy &quot;Labyrinth&quot; cast him as Jareth, the villainous Goblin King. Despite initially performing poorly, the film grew in popularity and became a cult film. Two years later, he played Pontius Pilate in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s critically acclaimed biblical epic &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; (1988). Despite only appearing for a three-minute sequence, Pegg writes that Bowie &quot;acquits himself well with a thoughtful, unshowy performance.&quot;

=== 1990s ===
In 1991, Bowie reteamed with Landis for an episode of the HBO sitcom &quot;Dream On&quot; and played a disgruntled restaurant employee opposite Rosanna Arquette in &quot;The Linguini Incident&quot;. Bowie portrayed the mysterious FBI agent Phillip Jeffries in David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me&quot; (1992). The prequel to the television series was poorly received at the time of its release, but has since been critically reevaluated. He took a small but pivotal role as his friend Andy Warhol in &quot;Basquiat&quot;, artist/director Julian Schnabel&#x27;s 1996 biopic of Jean-Michel Basquiat, another artist he considered a friend and colleague. Bowie co-starred in Giovanni Veronesi&#x27;s Spaghetti Western &quot;Il Mio West&quot; (1998, released as &quot;Gunslinger&#x27;s Revenge&quot; in the US in 2005) as the most feared gunfighter in the region. He played the ageing gangster Bernie in Andrew Goth&#x27;s &quot;Everybody Loves Sunshine&quot; (1999, released in the US as &quot;B.U.S.T.E.D.&quot;), and appeared as the host in the second season of the television horror anthology series &quot;The Hunger&quot;. Despite having several episodes which focus on vampires and Bowie&#x27;s involvement, the show had no plot connection to the 1983 film &quot;The Hunger&quot;. In 1999, Bowie voiced two characters in the Dreamcast game &quot;Omikron: The Nomad Soul&quot;, his only appearance in a video game.

=== 2000s and posthumous notes ===
In &quot;Mr. Rice&#x27;s Secret&quot; (2000), Bowie played the title role as the neighbour of a terminally ill 12-year-old boy. Bowie appeared as himself in the 2001 Ben Stiller comedy &quot;Zoolander&quot;, judging a &quot;walk-off&quot; between rival male models, and in Eric Idle&#x27;s 2002 mockumentary &quot;The Rutles 2: Can&#x27;t Buy Me Lunch&quot;. In 2005, he filmed a commercial with Snoop Dogg for XM Satellite Radio. Bowie portrayed a fictionalised version of the inventor Nikola Tesla in Christopher Nolan&#x27;s film &quot;The Prestige&quot; (2006), which was about the bitter rivalry between two magicians in the late 19th century. Nolan later claimed that Bowie was his only preference to play Tesla, and that he personally appealed to Bowie to take the role after he initially passed. In the same year, he voice-acted in Luc Besson&#x27;s animated film &quot;Arthur and the Invisibles&quot; as the powerful villain Maltazard, and appeared as himself in an episode of the Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant television series &quot;Extras&quot;. In 2007, he voiced the character Lord Royal Highness in the &quot;SpongeBob&#x27;s Atlantis SquarePantis&quot; television film. In the 2008 film &quot;August&quot;, directed by Austin Chick, he played a supporting role as Ogilvie, a &quot;ruthless venture capitalist&quot;. Bowie&#x27;s final film appearance was a cameo as himself in the 2009 teen comedy &quot;Bandslam&quot;.

In a 2017 interview with &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot;, the director Denis Villeneuve revealed his intention to cast Bowie in &quot;Blade Runner 2049&quot; as the main villain but following his death, Villeneuve was forced to look for talent with similar &quot;rock star&quot; qualities, eventually casting the actor and singer Jared Leto. Talking about the casting process, Villeneuve said: &quot;Our first thought [for the character] had been David Bowie, who had influenced &quot;Blade Runner&quot; in many ways. When we learned the sad news, we looked around for someone like that. He [Bowie] embodied the &quot;Blade Runner&quot; spirit.&quot; David Lynch also hoped to have Bowie reprise his &quot;Fire Walk With Me&quot; character for &quot;Twin Peaks: The Return&quot; but Bowie&#x27;s illness prevented this. His character was portrayed via archival footage. At Bowie&#x27;s request, Lynch overdubbed Bowie&#x27;s original dialogue with a different actor&#x27;s voice, as Bowie was unhappy with his Cajun accent in the original film.

==Other works==
===Painter and art collector===

Bowie was a painter and artist. He moved to Switzerland in 1976, purchasing a chalet in the hills north of Lake Geneva. In the new environment, his cocaine use decreased, and he devoted more time to his painting, producing a number of post-modernist pieces. When on tour, he took to sketching in a notebook, and photographing scenes for later reference. Visiting galleries in Geneva and the Brücke Museum in Berlin, Bowie became, in the words of Sandford, &quot;a prolific producer and collector of contemporary art. ... Not only did he become a well-known patron of expressionist art: locked in Clos des Mésanges he began an intensive self-improvement course in classical music and literature, and started work on an autobiography.&quot;

One of Bowie&#x27;s paintings sold at auction in late 1990 for $500, and the cover for his 1995 album &quot;Outside&quot; is a close-up of a self-portrait he painted that year. His first solo show, titled &quot;New Afro/Pagan and Work: 1975–1995&quot;, was in 1995 at The Gallery in Cork Street, London. In 1997, he founded the publishing company 21 Publishing, whose first title was &quot;Blimey! – From Bohemia to Britpop: London Art World from Francis Bacon to Damien Hirst&quot; by Matthew Collings. A year later, Bowie was invited to join the editorial board of the journal &quot;Modern Painters&quot;, and participated in the Nat Tate art hoax later that year. The same year, during an interview with Michael Kimmelman for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, he said &quot;Art was, seriously, the only thing I&#x27;d ever wanted to own.&quot; Subsequently, in a 1999 interview for the BBC, he said &quot;The only thing I buy obsessively and addictively is art&quot;. His art collection, which included works by Damien Hirst, Derek Boshier, Frank Auerbach, Henry Moore, and Jean-Michel Basquiat among others, was valued at over £10 million in mid-2016.

After his death, his family decided to sell most of the collection because they &quot;didn&#x27;t have the space&quot; to store it. On 10 and 11 November, three auctions were held at Sotheby&#x27;s in London. The items on sale represented about 65 per cent of the collection. Exhibition of the works in the auction attracted 51,470 visitors, the auction itself was attended by 1,750 bidders, with over 1,000 more bidding online. The auctions has overall sale total £32.9 million (app. $41.5 million), while the highest-selling item, Basquiat&#x27;s graffiti-inspired painting &quot;Air Power&quot;, sold for £7.09 million.

===Writings===
Outside of music, Bowie dabbled in several forms of writings during his life. In the late 1990s, Bowie was commissioned for writings of various media, including an essay on Jean-Michel Basquiat for the 2001 anthology book &quot;Writers on Artists&quot; and forewords to Jo Levin&#x27;s 2001 publication &quot;GQ Cool&quot;, Mick Rock&#x27;s 2001 photography portfolio &quot;Blood and Glitter&quot;, his wife Iman&#x27;s 2001 book &quot;I Am Iman&quot;, &quot;Q&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2002 special &quot;The 100 Greatest Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Photographs&quot; and Jonathan Barnbrook&#x27;s artwork portfolio &quot;Barnbrook Bible: The Graphic Design of Jonathan Barnbrook&quot;. He also heavily contributed to the 2002 Genesis Publications memoir of the Ziggy Stardust years, &quot;Moonage Daydream&quot;, which was rereleased in 2022.

Bowie also wrote liner notes for several albums, including &quot;Too Many Fish in the Sea&quot; by Robin Clark, the wife of his guitarist Carlos Alomar, Stevie Ray Vaughan&#x27;s posthumous &quot;Live at Montreux 1982 &amp; 1985&quot; (2002), the Spinners&#x27; compilation &quot;The Chrome Collection&quot; (2003), the tenth anniversary reissue of Placebo&#x27;s debut album (2006) and Neu!&#x27;s &quot;Vinyl Box&quot; (2010). Bowie also wrote an appreciation piece in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; for Nine Inch Nails in 2005 and an essay for the booklet accompanying Iggy Pop&#x27;s &quot;A Million in Prizes: The Anthology&quot; the same year.

===Bowie Bonds===

&quot;Bowie Bonds&quot;, the first modern example of celebrity bonds, were asset-backed securities of current and future revenues of the 25 albums that Bowie recorded before 1990. Issued in 1997, the bonds were bought for US$55 million by the Prudential Insurance Company of America. Royalties from the 25 albums generated the cash flow that secured the bonds&#x27; interest payments. By forfeiting 10 years worth of royalties, Bowie received a payment of US$55 million up front. Bowie used this income to buy songs owned by Defries. The bonds liquidated in 2007 and the rights to the income from the songs reverted to Bowie.

===Websites===
Bowie launched two personal websites during his lifetime. The first, an Internet service provider titled BowieNet, was developed in conjunction with Robert Goodale and Ron Roy and launched in September 1998. Subscribers to the dial-up service were offered exclusive content as well as a BowieNet email address and Internet access. The service was closed by 2006. The second, www.bowieart.com, allowed fans to view and purchase selected paintings, prints and sculptures from his private collection. The service, which ran from 2000 to 2008, also offered a showcase for young art students, in Bowie&#x27;s words, &quot;to show and sell their work without having to go through a dealer. Therefore, they really make the money they deserve for their paintings.&quot;

===Philanthropy===
Bowie was involved in philanthropic and charitable efforts for HIV/AIDS research in Africa, as well as other humanitarian projects helping disadvantaged children and developing nations, ending poverty and hunger, promoting human rights, and providing education and health care to children affected by war. A portion of the proceeds from the Pay-per-view showing of Bowie&#x27;s 50th birthday concert in 1997 was donated to Save the Children.

==Musicianship==

From the time of his earliest recordings in the 1960s, Bowie employed a wide variety of musical styles. His early compositions and performances were strongly influenced by rock and roll singers like Little Richard and Elvis Presley, and also the wider world of show business. He particularly strove to emulate the British musical theatre singer-songwriter and actor Anthony Newley, whose vocal style he frequently adopted, and made prominent use of for his 1967 debut release, &quot;David Bowie&quot; (to the disgust of Newley himself, who destroyed the copy he received from Bowie&#x27;s publisher). Bowie&#x27;s fascination with music hall continued to surface sporadically alongside such diverse styles as hard rock and heavy metal, soul, psychedelic folk and pop.

The musicologist James E. Perone observes Bowie&#x27;s use of octave switches for different repetitions of the same melody, exemplified in &quot;Space Oddity&quot;, and later in &quot;Heroes&quot; to dramatic effect; the author writes that &quot;in the lowest part of his vocal register ... his voice has an almost crooner-like richness&quot;. The voice instructor Jo Thompson describes Bowie&#x27;s vocal vibrato technique as &quot;particularly deliberate and distinctive&quot;. The authors Scott Schinder and Andy Schwartz call him &quot;a vocalist of extraordinary technical ability, able to pitch his singing to particular effect.&quot; Here, too, as in his stagecraft and songwriting, Bowie&#x27;s roleplaying is evident: the historiographer Michael Campbell says that Bowie&#x27;s lyrics &quot;arrest our ear, without question. But Bowie continually shifts from person to person as he delivers them ... His voice changes dramatically from section to section.&quot; In addition to the guitar, Bowie also played a variety of keyboards, including piano, Mellotron, Chamberlin, and synthesisers; harmonica; alto and baritone saxophones; stylophone; viola; cello; koto (on the &quot;Heroes&quot; track &quot;Moss Garden&quot;); thumb piano; drums (on the &quot;Heathen&quot; track &quot;Cactus&quot;), and various percussion instruments.

==Personal life==
===Family===

Bowie married his first wife, Mary Angela Barnett, on 19 March 1970 at Bromley Register Office in Bromley, London. Their son Duncan, born on 30 May 1971, was at first known as Zowie. Angie later described her and David&#x27;s union as a marriage of convenience. &quot;We got married so that I could [get a permit to] work. I didn&#x27;t think it would last and David said, before we got married, &#x27;I&#x27;m not really in love with you&#x27; and I thought that&#x27;s probably a good thing,&quot; she said. Bowie said about Angie that &quot;living with her is like living with a blow torch&quot;. The couple divorced on 8 February 1980; David received custody of Duncan. After the gag order that was part of their divorce agreement ended, Angie wrote a memoir of their turbulent marriage, titled &quot;Backstage Passes: Life on the Wild Side with David Bowie&quot;.

David met Somali-American model Iman in Los Angeles following the Sound+Vision Tour in October 1990. They married in a private ceremony in Lausanne on 24 April 1992. The wedding was solemnised on 6 June in Florence. The couple&#x27;s marriage influenced the content of &quot;Black Tie White Noise&quot;, particularly on tracks such as &quot;The Wedding&quot;/&quot;The Wedding Song&quot; and &quot;Miracle Goodnight&quot;. They had one daughter, Alexandria &quot;Lexi&quot; Zahra Jones, born on 15 August 2000. The couple resided primarily in New York City and London as well as owning an apartment in Sydney&#x27;s Elizabeth Bay and Britannia Bay House on the island of Mustique. Following Bowie&#x27;s death, Iman expressed gratitude that the two were able to maintain separate identities during their marriage.

===Other relationships===

Bowie began a personal and professional relationship with the singer Dana Gillespie in 1964 when he was 17 and she was 14. Their relationship lasted a decade; Bowie wrote the song &quot;Andy Warhol&quot; for her, Gillespie sang backing vocals on &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot;, and Bowie and Mick Ronson produced her 1973 album &quot;Weren&#x27;t Born a Man&quot;. Bowie ended contact with Gillespie following his split from Angie. Gillespie looked back on her time with Bowie fondly.

Bowie met the dancer Lindsay Kemp in 1967 and enrolled in his dance class at the London Dance Centre. He commented in 1972 that meeting Kemp was when his interest in image &quot;really blossomed&quot;: &quot;He lived on his emotions, he was a wonderful influence. His day-to-day life was the most theatrical thing I had ever seen, ever. It was everything I thought Bohemia probably was. I joined the circus.&quot; In January 1968, Kemp choreographed a dance scene for a BBC play, &quot;The Pistol Shot&quot;, and used Bowie with a dancer, Hermione Farthingale; the pair began dating and moved into a London flat together. Bowie and Farthingale broke up in early 1969 when she went to Norway to take part in a film, &quot;Song of Norway&quot;; this affected him, and several songs, such as &quot;Letter to Hermione&quot; and &quot;An Occasional Dream&quot;, reference her; and, for the video accompanying &quot;Where Are We Now?&quot;, he wore a T-shirt with the words &quot;m/s Song of Norway&quot;. Bowie blamed himself for their break-up, saying in 2002 that he &quot;was totally unfaithful and couldn&#x27;t for the life of me keep it zipped&quot;. Farthingale, who spoke of deep affection for him in an interview with Pegg, said they last saw each other in 1970.

David and Angie had an open marriage and dated other people during it: David had relationships with the models Cyrinda Foxe, Lulu, Bebe Buell and the &quot;Young Americans&quot; backing singer Ava Cherry; Angie had encounters with the Stooges&#x27; members Ron Asheton and James Williamson, the Ziggy Stardust Tour bodyguard Anton Jones, and the drummer Roy Martin, which inspired the song &quot;Breaking Glass&quot;.

In 1983, Bowie briefly dated the New Zealand model Geeling Ng, who starred in the video for &quot;China Girl&quot;. While filming &quot;The Hunger&quot; the same year, Bowie had a sexual relationship with his co-star Susan Sarandon, who stated in 2014 &quot;He&#x27;s worth idolising. He&#x27;s extraordinary.&quot; Between 1987 and 1990, Bowie dated the Glass Spider Tour dancer Melissa Hurley. The two began their relationship at the end of the tour when she was 22 years old. Bowie&#x27;s Tin Machine collaborator Kevin Armstrong remembered her as &quot;a genuinely kind, sweet person&quot;. She inspired the song &quot;Amazing&quot; on &quot;Tin Machine&quot; (1989). They announced their engagement in May 1989 but never married; Bowie broke the relationship off during the latter half of the Sound+Vision Tour, primarily due to the age difference—he was 43 at the time. He later spoke of Hurley as &quot;such a wonderful, lovely, vibrant girl&quot;.

====Coco Schwab====
Corinne &quot;Coco&quot; Schwab was Bowie&#x27;s personal assistant for 43 years, from 1973 until his death in 2016. Originally a receptionist at the London office of MainMan, Schwab assisted in extracting Bowie from MainMan&#x27;s financial grip, after which he invited her to be his personal assistant. Bowie referred to Schwab as his best friend and credited her for saving his life in the 1970s by helping him quit his drug addiction; he dedicated the 1987 song &quot;Never Let Me Down&quot; to her. Schwab maintained close guard of him and did not get along with Angie, who later blamed Schwab for the downfall of her and Bowie&#x27;s marriage. Bowie left $2 million to Schwab in his will. Upon his death, friends of Bowie, including Tony Zanetta and Robin Clark, offered tributes to Schwab.

===Sexuality===
Bowie&#x27;s sexuality has been the subject of debate. While married to Angie, he famously declared himself gay in a 1972 interview with &quot;Melody Maker&quot; journalist Michael Watts, which generated publicity in both America and Britain; Bowie was adopted as a gay icon in both countries. According to Buckley, &quot;If Ziggy confused both his creator and his audience, a big part of that confusion centred on the topic of sexuality.&quot; He affirmed his stance in a 1976 interview with &quot;Playboy&quot;, stating: &quot;It&#x27;s true—I am a bisexual. But I can&#x27;t deny that I&#x27;ve used that fact very well. I suppose it&#x27;s the best thing that ever happened to me.&quot; His claim of bisexuality has been supported by Angie.

In 1983, Bowie told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writer Kurt Loder that his public declaration of bisexuality was &quot;the biggest mistake I ever made&quot; and &quot;I was always a closet heterosexual&quot;. On other occasions, he said his interest in homosexual and bisexual culture had been more a product of the times and the situation in which he found himself than of his own feelings. &quot;Blender&quot; asked Bowie in 2002 whether he still believed his public declaration was his biggest mistake. After a long pause, he said, &quot;I don&#x27;t think it was a mistake in Europe, but it was a lot tougher in America. I had no problem with people knowing I was bisexual. But I had no inclination to hold any banners nor be a representative of any group of people.&quot; Bowie said he wanted to be a songwriter and performer rather than a headline for his bisexuality, and in &quot;puritanical&quot; America, &quot;I think it stood in the way of so much I wanted to do.&quot;

Buckley wrote that Bowie &quot;mined sexual intrigue for its ability to shock&quot;. According to Mary Finnigan—a brief girlfriend of Bowie&#x27;s in 1969—David and Angie &quot;created their bisexual fantasy&quot;. Sandford wrote that David &quot;made a positive fetish of repeating the quip that he and his wife had met while &#x27;fucking the same bloke&#x27; ... Gay sex was always an anecdotal and laughing matter&quot;. The BBC&#x27;s Mark Easton stated in 2016 that Britain was &quot;far more tolerant of difference&quot;, and that gay rights and gender equality would not have &quot;enjoyed the broad support they do today without Bowie&#x27;s androgynous challenge all those years ago&quot;.

===Spirituality and religion===
Beginning in 1967 from the influence of his half-brother, Bowie became interested in Buddhism and, with commercial success eluding him, he considered becoming a Buddhist monk. Biographer Marc Spitz states that the religion reminded the young artist that other goals in life existed outside fame and material gain and one can learn about themselves through meditation and chanting. After a few months&#x27; study at Tibet House in London, he was told by his Lama, Chime Rinpoche, &quot;You don&#x27;t want to be Buddhist... You should follow music.&quot; By 1975, Bowie admitted, &quot;I felt totally, absolutely alone. And I probably was alone because I pretty much had abandoned God.&quot; In his will, Bowie stipulated that he be cremated and his ashes scattered in Bali &quot;in accordance with the Buddhist rituals&quot;.

After Bowie married Iman in a private ceremony in 1992, he said they knew that their &quot;real marriage, sanctified by God, had to happen in a church in Florence&quot;. Earlier that year, he knelt on stage at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert and recited the Lord&#x27;s Prayer before a television audience. In 1993, Bowie said he had an &quot;undying&quot; belief in the &quot;unquestionable&quot; existence of God. In a separate 1993 interview, while describing the genesis of the music for his album &quot;Black Tie White Noise&quot;, he said &quot;it was important for me to find something [musically] that also had no sort of representation of institutionalized and organized religion, of which I&#x27;m not a believer, I must make that clear.&quot; Interviewed in 2005, Bowie said whether God exists &quot;is not a question that can be answered... I&#x27;m not quite an atheist and it worries me. There&#x27;s that little bit that holds on: &#x27;Well, I&#x27;m &quot;almost&quot; an atheist. Give me a couple of months... I&#x27;ve nearly got it right. He had a tattoo of the Serenity Prayer in Japanese on his left calf.

Bowie stated that &quot;questioning [his] spiritual life [was] always ... germane&quot; to his songwriting. The song &quot;Station to Station&quot; is &quot;very much concerned with the Stations of the Cross&quot;; the song also specifically references Kabbalah. Bowie called the album &quot;extremely dark... the nearest album to a magick treatise that I&#x27;ve written&quot;. &quot;Earthling&quot; showed &quot;the abiding need in me to vacillate between atheism or a kind of gnosticism... What I need is to find a balance, spiritually, with the way I live and my demise.&quot; &quot;Hours&quot; boasted overtly Christian themes, with its artwork inspired by the Pietà. &quot;Blackstar&quot; &quot;Lazarus&quot; began with the words, &quot;Look up here, I&#x27;m in Heaven&quot; while the rest of the album deals with other matters of mysticism and mortality.

==Political views==
In his first ever television interview, Bowie, under the name Davie Jones, spoke out about prejudice against long-haired men after he and his then-band the Manish Boys were asked to cut their hair before a BBC television appearance. He and the Manish Boys were interviewed on the network&#x27;s 12 November 1964 instalment of &quot;Tonight&quot; to champion their cause, where Bowie claimed to be a spokesperson for the nonexistent Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Long-Haired Men. He stated on the programme, &quot;I think we all like long hair and we don&#x27;t see why other people should persecute us because of it.&quot;

In 1976, speaking as the Thin White Duke persona and &quot;at least partially tongue-in-cheek&quot;, he made statements that expressed support for fascism and perceived admiration for Adolf Hitler in interviews with &quot;Playboy&quot;, &quot;NME&quot; and a Swedish publication. Bowie was quoted as saying: &quot;Britain is ready for a fascist leader ... I think Britain could benefit from a fascist leader. After all, fascism is really nationalism... I believe very strongly in fascism, people have always responded with greater efficiency under a regimental leadership.&quot; He was also quoted as saying: &quot;Adolf Hitler was one of the first rock stars&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;ve got to have an extreme right front come up and sweep everything off its feet and tidy everything up.&quot; These comments, along with Eric Clapton&#x27;s comments in support of Enoch Powell at that time, have been named as an inspiration for the formation of the Rock Against Racism movement. Bowie retracted his comments in an interview with &quot;Melody Maker&quot; in October 1977, blaming them on mental instability caused by his drug problems, saying: &quot;I was out of my mind, totally, completely crazed.&quot; In the same interview, Bowie described himself as &quot;apolitical&quot;, stating &quot;the more I travel and the less sure I am about exactly which political philosophies are commendable. The more government systems I see, the less enticed I am to give my allegiance to any set of people, so it would be disastrous for me to adopt a definitive point of view, or to adopt a party of people and say &#x27;these are my people&#x27;.&quot;

In the 1980s and 1990s, Bowie&#x27;s public statements shifted sharply towards anti-racism and anti-fascism. In an interview with MTV anchor Mark Goodman in 1983, Bowie criticised the channel for not providing enough coverage of Black musicians, becoming visibly uncomfortable when Goodman suggested that the network&#x27;s fear of backlash from the American Midwest was one reason for such a lack of coverage. The music videos for &quot;China Girl&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; were described by Bowie as a &quot;very simple, very direct&quot; statement against racism. The album &quot;Tin Machine&quot; took a more direct stance against fascism and neo-Nazism, and was criticised for being too preachy. In 1993 he released the single &quot;Black Tie White Noise&quot; which dealt with the 1992 Los Angeles riots. In 2007 Bowie donated $10,000 to the defence fund for the Jena Six saying, &quot;there is clearly a separate and unequal judicial process going on in the town of Jena&quot;.

When Bowie won the British Male Solo Artist award at the 2014 Brit Awards, he referenced the forthcoming Scottish independence referendum by saying, &quot;Scotland, stay with us.&quot; This garnered a significant reaction throughout the UK on social media.

==Death==
Bowie died of liver cancer in his New York City apartment on 10 January 2016. He had been diagnosed 18 months earlier, but he had not made his condition public. The Belgian theatre director Ivo van Hove, who had worked with Bowie on his off-Broadway musical &quot;Lazarus&quot;, explained that while Bowie was unable to attend its rehearsals due to the progression of the disease, he had otherwise continued to work during his illness.

Tony Visconti wrote:

Following Bowie&#x27;s death, fans gathered at impromptu street shrines. At the mural of Bowie in his birthplace of Brixton, South London, which shows him in his &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; character, fans laid flowers and sang his songs. Other memorial sites included Berlin, Los Angeles, and outside his apartment in New York. After news of his death, sales of his albums and singles soared. Bowie had insisted that he did not want a funeral, and according to his death certificate he was cremated in New Jersey on 12 January. As he wished in his will, his ashes were scattered in a Buddhist ceremony in Bali.

David Bowie left an estate of around $100m to his wife, Iman, and his two children. He also left $2m to his long-standing assistant Corinne Schwab and $1m to his friend Marion Skene who was the nanny to his eldest child Duncan Jones. To his 15-year-old daughter Alexandria he left a 25% share in the estate and a property on Little Tonshi Mountain, near Woodstock. His 44-year-old son Duncan Jones, from his previous marriage to Angela Barnett, also received 25%. The remaining 50% of the estate went to Iman, in addition to his other properties, including their apartment on Lafayette Street in Manhattan.

== Legacy and influence ==
Bowie is generally regarded as one of the most influential musicians of all time. According to Alexis Petridis of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, by 1980 he was &quot;the most important and influential artist since the Beatles&quot;. His influence was wide-reaching due to constant reinvention, leading him to be dubbed the &quot;chameleon of rock&quot;. The biographer Thomas Forget said in 2002: &quot;Because he succeeded in so many different styles of music, it is almost impossible to find a popular artist today that has not been influenced by David Bowie.&quot; Neil McCormick of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; stated that Bowie had &quot;one of the supreme careers in popular music, art and culture of the 20th century&quot; and &quot;he was too inventive, too mercurial, too strange for all but his most devoted fans to keep up with&quot;.

Bowie&#x27;s songs and stagecraft brought a new dimension to popular music in the early 1970s, strongly influencing its immediate forms and subsequent development. Perone credited Bowie with having &quot;brought sophistication to rock music&quot;, and critical reviews frequently acknowledged the intellectual depth of his work and influence. The BBC&#x27;s arts editor Will Gompertz likened Bowie to Pablo Picasso, writing that he was &quot;an innovative, visionary, restless artist who synthesised complex avant garde concepts into beautifully coherent works that touched the hearts and minds of millions&quot;. Schinder and Schwartz credited Bowie and Marc Bolan as the founders of the glam rock genre. He also inspired the innovators of the punk rock movement and explored grunge and alternative rock styles with the band Tin Machine before those styles became popular.
In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Jon Pareles said Bowie &quot;transcended music, art and fashion&quot;, and introduced his audiences to Philadelphia funk, Japanese fashion, German electronica and drum-and-bass dance music. &quot;Billboard&quot; Joe Lynch argued Bowie &quot;influenced more musical genres than any other rock star&quot;, from glam rock, folk rock and hard rock, to electronic, industrial rock and synth-pop, to even hip hop and indie rock.

Broadcaster John Peel contrasted Bowie with his progressive rock contemporaries, arguing that Bowie was &quot;an interesting kind of fringe figure... on the outskirts of things&quot;. Peel said he &quot;liked the idea of him reinventing himself... the one distinguishing feature about early-70s progressive rock was that it didn&#x27;t progress. Before Bowie came along, people didn&#x27;t want too much change&quot;; then Bowie &quot;subverted the whole notion of what it was to be a rock star&quot;. Buckley called Bowie &quot;both star and icon. The vast body of work he has produced ... has created perhaps the biggest cult in popular culture. ... His influence has been unique in popular culture—he has permeated and altered more lives than any comparable figure.&quot;

The BBC&#x27;s Mark Easton argued that Bowie provided fuel for &quot;the creative powerhouse that Britain has become&quot; by challenging future generations &quot;to aim high, to be ambitious and provocative, to take risks&quot;, concluding that he had &quot;changed the way the world sees Britain. And the way Britain sees itself&quot;. In 2006, Bowie was voted the fourth greatest living British icon in a poll held by the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Culture Show&quot;. Annie Zaleski wrote, &quot;Every band or solo artist who&#x27;s decided to rip up their playbook and start again owes a debt to Bowie&quot;.

Numerous figures from the music industry whose careers Bowie had influenced paid tribute to him following his death; panegyrics on Twitter (tweets about him peaked at 20,000 a minute an hour after the announcement of his death) also came from outside the entertainment industry and pop culture, such as those from the Vatican, namely Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi, who quoted &quot;Space Oddity&quot;, and the German Federal Foreign Office, which thanked Bowie for his part in the fall of the Berlin Wall and referenced &quot;Heroes&quot;.

On 7 January 2017, the BBC broadcast the 90-minute documentary &quot;David Bowie: The Last Five Years&quot;. A day later, which would have been Bowie&#x27;s 70th birthday, a charity concert in his birthplace of Brixton was hosted by close friend and actor Gary Oldman. A David Bowie walking tour through Brixton was also launched, and other events marking his birthday weekend included concerts in New York, Los Angeles, Sydney, and Tokyo.

===&quot;David Bowie Is&quot;===

An exhibition of Bowie artefacts, called &quot;David Bowie Is&quot;, was organised by the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, and shown there in 2013. The London exhibit was visited by over 300,000 people, making it one of the most successful exhibitions ever staged at the museum. Later that year the exhibition began a world tour which started in Toronto and included stops lasting a few months each throughout Europe, Asia and North America before the exhibit ended in 2018 at the Brooklyn Museum. The exhibition hosted around 2,000,000 visitors over its run.

=== &quot;Stardust&quot; biopic ===

The biopic &quot;Stardust&quot; was announced on 31 January 2019, with musician and actor Johnny Flynn as Bowie, Jena Malone as his wife Angie, and Marc Maron as his publicist. Written by Christopher Bell and directed by Gabriel Range, the film follows Bowie on his first trip to the United States in 1971. Bowie&#x27;s son Duncan Jones spoke out against the film, saying he was not consulted and that the film would not have permission to use Bowie&#x27;s music. The film was set to premiere at the 2020 Tribeca Film Festival, but the festival was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Critics were generally unfavourable in their reviews.

===&quot;Moonage Daydream&quot;===

A film based on Bowie&#x27;s musical journey throughout his career was announced on 23 May 2022. Titled &quot;Moonage Daydream&quot;, after the song &quot;Moonage Daydream&quot;, the film is written and directed by Brett Morgen and features never-before-seen footage, performances and music framed by Bowie&#x27;s own narration. Morgan stated that &quot;Bowie cannot be defined, he can be experienced... That is why we crafted &quot;Moonage Daydream&quot; to be a unique cinematic experience&quot;. The documentary is the first posthumous film about Bowie to be approved by his estate. After spending five years in production, the film premiered at the 2022 Cannes Film Festival, and was released theatrically in the US in IMAX on 16 September. It received positive reviews.

==Awards and achievements==
Bowie&#x27;s 1969 commercial breakthrough, &quot;Space Oddity&quot;, won him an Ivor Novello Special Award For Originality. For his performance in &quot;The Man Who Fell to Earth&quot;, he won the Saturn Award for Best Actor. In the ensuing decades he received six Grammy Awards and four Brit Awards, including Best British Male Artist twice; the award for Outstanding Contribution to Music in 1996; and the Brits Icon award for his &quot;lasting impact on British culture&quot;, given posthumously in 2016.
In 1999, Bowie was made a Commander of the by the French government, and received an honorary doctorate from Berklee College of Music. He declined the royal honour of Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 2000, and turned down a knighthood in 2003. Bowie later stated &quot;I would never have any intention of accepting anything like that. I seriously don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s for. It&#x27;s not what I spent my life working for.&quot;

During his lifetime, Bowie sold over 100 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists. In the UK, he was awarded nine platinum, eleven gold and eight silver albums, and in the US, five platinum and nine gold. Since 2015, Parlophone has remastered Bowie&#x27;s catalogue through the &quot;Era&quot; box set series, starting with &quot;Five Years (1969–1973)&quot;. Bowie was announced as the best-selling vinyl artist of the 21st century in 2022.

The 2020 revision of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list includes &quot;The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars&quot; at number 40, &quot;Station to Station&quot; at 52, &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; at 88, &quot;Low&quot; at 206, and &quot;Scary Monsters&quot; at 443. On the 2021 revision of the same magazine&#x27;s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list, Bowie&#x27;s songs include &quot;Heroes&quot; at number 23, &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; at 105, &quot;Space Oddity&quot; at 189, &quot;Changes&quot; at 200, &quot;Young Americans&quot; at 204, &quot;Station to Station&quot; at 400, and &quot;Under Pressure&quot; at 429. Four of his songs are included in The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.
In the BBC&#x27;s 2002 poll of the 100 Greatest Britons, Bowie was ranked 29. In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked him 39th on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. Bowie was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 and into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2005. He was inducted into the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame in 2013. Days after Bowie&#x27;s death, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; contributor Rob Sheffield proclaimed him &quot;the greatest rock star ever&quot;. The magazine also listed him as the 39th greatest songwriter of all time. In 2022, Sky Arts ranked him the most influential artist in Britain of the last 50 years &quot;owing to his transcendent influence on British culture&quot;. He ranked 32nd on the 2023 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

<text>Dennis Lee Hopper (May 17, 1936 – May 29, 2010) was an American actor and film director. He is known for his roles as mentally disturbed outsiders and rebels. He earned prizes from the Cannes Film Festival and Venice International Film Festival as well as nominations for two Academy Awards, a Primetime Emmy Award and two Golden Globe Awards. Hopper studied acting at the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego and the Actors Studio in New York. Hopper also began a prolific and acclaimed photography career in the 1960s.

Hopper made his first television appearance in 1954, and soon after appeared in two of the films that made James Dean famous, &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; (1955) and &quot;Giant&quot; (1956). He then acted in &quot;Gunfight at the O.K. Corral&quot; (1957), &quot;The Sons of Katie Elder&quot; (1965), &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot; (1967), &quot;Hang &#x27;Em High&quot; (1968) and &quot;True Grit&quot; (1969). Hopper made his directorial film debut with &quot;Easy Rider&quot; (1969), which he and co-star Peter Fonda wrote with Terry Southern. The film earned Hopper a Cannes Film Festival Award and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.

He became frequently typecast as mentally disturbed outsiders in such films as &quot;Mad Dog Morgan&quot; (1976), &quot;The American Friend&quot; (1977), &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; (1979), &quot;Rumble Fish&quot; (1983), and &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; (1986). He received an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor nomination for his role in &quot;Hoosiers&quot; (1986). His later film roles included &quot;True Romance&quot; (1993), &quot;Speed&quot; (1994), &quot;Waterworld&quot; (1995) and &quot;Elegy&quot; (2009). He appeared posthumously in the long-delayed &quot;The Other Side of the Wind&quot; (2018), which had previously been filmed in the early 1970s.

Other directorial credits for Hopper include &quot;The Last Movie&quot; (1971), &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; (1980), &quot;Colors&quot; (1988), and &quot;The Hot Spot&quot; (1990). He received Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie nomination for his role in &quot;Paris Trout&quot; (1991). His other television roles include in the HBO film &quot;Doublecrossed&quot; (1991), &quot;24&quot; (2002), the NBC series &quot;E-Ring&quot; (2005–2006), and the Starz series &quot;Crash&quot; (2008–2009).

== Early life and education ==
Dennis Lee Hopper was born on May 17, 1936, in Dodge City, Kansas, to Marjorie Mae (née Davis; July 12, 1917 – January 12, 2007) and Jay Millard Hopper (June 23, 1916 – August 7, 1982). He had Scottish ancestors. Hopper had two younger brothers, Marvin and David.

After World War II, the family moved to Kansas City, Missouri, where the young Hopper attended Saturday art classes at the Kansas City Art Institute. When he was 13, Hopper and his family moved to San Diego, where his mother worked as a lifeguard instructor and his father was a post office manager, having previously served in the Office of Strategic Services, the precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency, in World War II in the China Burma India Theater. Hopper was voted most likely to succeed at Helix High School, where he was active in the drama club, speech and choir. It was there that he developed an interest in acting, studying at the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego, and the Actors Studio in New York City (he studied with Lee Strasberg for five years). Hopper struck up a friendship with actor Vincent Price, whose passion for art influenced Hopper&#x27;s interest in art. He was especially fond of the plays of William Shakespeare.

==Career==
=== 1954–1966: Early roles ===

Hopper was reported to have had an uncredited role in &quot;Johnny Guitar&quot; in 1954, but he was quoted as saying he was not in Hollywood when the film was made. Hopper made his debut on film in two roles with James Dean (whom he admired immensely) in &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; (1955) and &quot;Giant&quot; (1956). Dean&#x27;s death in a car accident in September 1955 affected the young Hopper deeply and it was shortly afterward that he got into a confrontation with veteran director Henry Hathaway on the film &quot;From Hell to Texas&quot; (1958). Hopper reportedly forced Hathaway to shoot more than 80 takes of a scene over several days before he acquiesced to Hathaway&#x27;s direction. After filming was finally completed, Hathaway allegedly told Hopper that his career in Hollywood was finished.

In his book &quot;Last Train to Memphis&quot;, American popular music historian Peter Guralnick says that in 1956, when Elvis Presley was making his first film in Hollywood, Hopper was roommates with fellow actor Nick Adams and the three became friends and socialized together. In 1959, Hopper moved to New York to study Method acting under Lee Strasberg at the Actors Studio. In 1961, Hopper played his first lead role in &quot;Night Tide&quot;, an atmospheric supernatural thriller involving a mermaid in an amusement park. In a December 1994 interview on the &quot;Charlie Rose Show&quot;, Hopper credited John Wayne with saving his career, as Hopper acknowledged that because of his insolent behavior, he could not find work in Hollywood for seven years. Hopper stated that, because of his marriage to Brooke Hayward, he was the son-in-law of actress Margaret Sullavan, a friend of John Wayne, and Wayne hired Hopper for a role in &quot;The Sons of Katie Elder&quot; (1965), also directed by Hathaway, which enabled Hopper to restart his film career.

Hopper debuted in an episode of the Richard Boone television series &quot;Medic&quot; in 1955, portraying a young epileptic. He appeared in the first episode of the popular TV series &quot;The Rifleman&quot; (1958–1963) as the troubled orphan protagonist Vernon Tippet who is exploited by his greedy uncle. The series starred Chuck Connors and the premiere episode &quot;The Sharpshooter&quot; was written by Sam Peckinpah. Hopper subsequently appeared in over 140 episodes of television shows such as &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, &quot;Bonanza&quot;, &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot;, &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, &quot;The Barbara Stanwyck Show&quot;, &quot;The Defenders&quot;, &quot;The Investigators&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Jesse James&quot;, &quot;Entourage&quot;, &quot;The Big Valley&quot;, &quot;The Time Tunnel&quot;, and &quot;Combat!&quot;.

=== 1967–1986: Breakthrough and acclaim ===

Hopper had a supporting role as the bet-taker, &quot;Babalugats&quot;, in &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot; (1967). In 1968, Hopper teamed with Peter Fonda, Terry Southern and Jack Nicholson to make &quot;Easy Rider&quot;, which premiered in July 1969. With the release of &quot;True Grit&quot; a month earlier, Hopper had starring roles in two major box-office films that summer. Hopper won wide acclaim as the director for his improvisational methods and innovative editing for &quot;Easy Rider&quot;. The production was plagued by creative differences and personal acrimony between Fonda and Hopper, the dissolution of Hopper&#x27;s marriage to Brooke Hayward, his unwillingness to leave the editor&#x27;s desk and his accelerating abuse of drugs and alcohol. Hopper said of &quot;Easy Rider&quot;: &quot;The cocaine problem in the United States is really because of me. There was no cocaine before &quot;Easy Rider&quot; on the street. After &quot;Easy Rider&quot;, it was everywhere&quot;.

Besides showing drug use on film, it was one of the first films to portray the hippie lifestyle. Hopper became a role model for some male youths who rejected traditional jobs and traditional American culture, partly exemplified by Fonda&#x27;s long sideburns and Hopper wearing shoulder-length hair and a long mustache. They were denied rooms in motels and proper service in restaurants as a result of their radical looks. Their long hair became a point of contention in various scenes during the film. Journalist Ann Hornaday wrote: &quot;With its portrait of counterculture heroes raising their middle fingers to the uptight middle-class hypocrisies, &quot;Easy Rider&quot; became the cinematic symbol of the 1960s, a celluloid anthem to freedom, macho bravado and anti-establishment rebellion&quot;. Film critic Matthew Hays wrote &quot;no other persona better signifies the lost idealism of the 1960s than that of Dennis Hopper&quot;.
Hopper was unable to capitalize on his &quot;Easy Rider&quot; success for several years. In 1970 he filmed &quot;The Last Movie&quot;, cowritten by Stewart Stern and photographed by László Kovács in Peru, and completed production in 1971. It won the prestigious CIDALC Award at that year&#x27;s Venice Film Festival, but Universal Studios leaders expected a blockbuster like &quot;Easy Rider&quot;, and did not like the film or give it an enthusiastic release, while American film audiences found it confounding – as convoluted as an abstract painting. On viewing the first release print, fresh from the lab, in his screening room at Universal, MCA founder Jules C. Stein rose from his chair and said, &quot;I just don&#x27;t understand this younger generation.&quot; During the tumultuous editing process, Hopper ensconced himself at the Mabel Dodge Luhan House in Taos, New Mexico, which he had purchased in 1970, for almost an entire year. In between contesting Fonda&#x27;s rights to the majority of the residual profits from &quot;Easy Rider&quot;, he married singer Michelle Phillips of The Mamas and the Papas on Halloween of 1970. The marriage lasted eight days.

Hopper acted in another John Wayne film, &quot;True Grit&quot; (1969), and during its production, he became well acquainted with Wayne. In both of the films with Wayne, Hopper&#x27;s character is killed in the presence of Wayne&#x27;s character, to whom he utters his dying words. On September 30, 1970, Hopper appeared on the second episode of season 2 of &quot;The Johnny Cash Show&quot; where he sang a duet with Cash entitled &quot;Goin&#x27; Up Goin&#x27; Down&quot;. Cash said the song was written by Kris Kristofferson about Hopper. Hopper added that Kristofferson had written some songs for his Peruvian-shot movie &quot;The Last Movie&quot;, in which Kristofferson appeared in his debut role with Julie Adams. Hopper also recited Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s famous poem If— during his appearance. Hopper was able to sustain his lifestyle and a measure of celebrity by acting in numerous low budget and European films throughout the 1970s as the archetypal &quot;tormented maniac&quot;, including &quot;Mad Dog Morgan&quot; (1976), &quot;Tracks&quot; (1976), and &quot;The American Friend&quot; (1977). With Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s blockbuster &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; (1979), Hopper returned to prominence as a hyper-manic Vietnam-era photojournalist. Stepping in for an overwhelmed director, Hopper won praise in 1980 for his directing and acting in &quot;Out of the Blue&quot;. Immediately thereafter, Hopper starred as an addled short-order cook &quot;Cracker&quot; in the Neil Young/Dean Stockwell low-budget collaboration &quot;Human Highway&quot;. Production was reportedly often delayed by his unreliable behavior. Peter Biskind states in the New Hollywood history &quot;Easy Riders, Raging Bulls&quot; that Hopper&#x27;s cocaine intake had reached three grams a day by this time, complemented by 30 beers, and some marijuana and Cuba libres.

After staging a &quot;suicide attempt&quot; (really more of a daredevil act) in a coffin using 17 sticks of dynamite during an &quot;art happening&quot; at the Rice University Media Center (filmed by professor and documentary filmmaker Brian Huberman), and later disappearing into the Mexican desert during a particularly extravagant bender, Hopper entered a drug rehabilitation program in 1983.

Though Hopper gave critically acclaimed performances in Coppola&#x27;s &quot;Rumble Fish&quot; (1983) and Sam Peckinpah&#x27;s &quot;The Osterman Weekend&quot; (1983), it was not until he portrayed the gas-huffing, obscenity-screaming villain Frank Booth in David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; (1986) that his career truly revived. On reading the script Hopper said to Lynch: &quot;You have to let me play Frank Booth. Because I am Frank Booth!&quot; He won critical acclaim and several awards for this role, and in the same year received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his role as an alcoholic assistant basketball coach in &quot;Hoosiers&quot;. Also in 1986, Hopper portrayed Lt. Enright in the comedy horror &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2&quot;.

=== 1987–2009: Later work and final roles ===

In 1987 he acted in the neo-noir thriller &quot;Black Widow&quot; alongside Debra Winger, the action comedy &quot;Straight to Hell&quot;, the adventure film &quot;Running Out of Luck&quot; starring Mick Jagger and the romantic comedy &quot;The Pick-up Artist&quot; starring Molly Ringwald and Robert Downey Jr. In 1988, he directed &quot;Colors&quot;, a critically acclaimed police procedural about gang violence in Los Angeles starring Sean Penn and Robert Duvall. Hopper plays an aging hippie prankster in the 1990 comedy &quot;Flashback&quot;, fleeing in a &quot;Furthur&quot;-like old bus to the tune of Steppenwolf&#x27;s &quot;Born to Be Wild&quot;. Hopper teamed with Nike in the early 1990s to make a series of television commercials. He appeared as a &quot;crazed referee&quot; in those ads. Hopper appeared on the final two episodes of the cult 1991 television show &quot;Fishing with John&quot; with host John Lurie. He was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie for the 1991 HBO film &quot;Paris Trout&quot;. Shortly thereafter, he played drug smuggler and DEA informant Barry Seal in the HBO film &quot;Doublecrossed&quot;.

He starred as King Koopa in &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, a 1993 critical and commercial failure loosely based on the video game of the same name. In 1993, he played Clifford Worley in &quot;True Romance&quot;. He co-starred in the 1994 blockbuster &quot;Speed&quot; with Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, and as magic-phobic H.P. Lovecraft in the TV movie &quot;Witch Hunt&quot;. In 1995, Hopper played a greedy TV self-help guru, Dr. Luther Waxling in &quot;Search and Destroy&quot;. The same year, he starred as Deacon, the one-eyed nemesis of Kevin Costner in &quot;Waterworld&quot;. And in 1996 he starred in the science fiction comedy &quot;Space Truckers&quot; directed by Stuart Gordon. Also in 1996 he appeared as art dealer Bruno Bischofberger in &quot;Basquiat&quot;. Hopper was originally cast as Christof in the 1998 Peter Weir film, &quot;The Truman Show&quot;, but left during the filming due to &quot;creative differences&quot;; he was replaced by Ed Harris. In 1999, he starred in &quot;The Prophet&#x27;s Game&quot; (a dark thriller), directed by David Worth and also starring Stephanie Zimbalist, Robert Yocum, Sondra Locke, Joe Penny and Tracey Birdsall. In 2003, Hopper was in the running for the dual lead in the indie horror drama &quot;Firecracker&quot;, but was ousted at the last minute in favor of Mike Patton.

In 2005, Hopper played Paul Kaufman in George A. Romero&#x27;s &quot;Land of the Dead&quot;. He portrayed villain Victor Drazen in the first season of the popular action drama &quot;24&quot;. Hopper starred as a U.S. Army colonel in the 2005 television series &quot;E-Ring&quot;, a drama set at The Pentagon, but the series was canceled after 14 episodes aired. Hopper appeared in all 22 episodes that were filmed. He also played the part of record producer Ben Cendars in the Starz television series &quot;Crash&quot;, which lasted two seasons (26 episodes).

In 2008, Hopper starred in &quot;An American Carol&quot;. In 2008 he also played The Death in Wim Wenders&#x27; &quot;Palermo Shooting&quot;. His last major feature film appearance was in the 2008 film &quot;Elegy&quot; with Ben Kingsley, Penélope Cruz and Debbie Harry. For his last performance, he was the voice of Tony, the alpha-male of the Eastern wolf pack in the 2010 animated film &quot;Alpha and Omega&quot;. He died before the movie was released. This brought the directors to dedicate the film to his memory at the beginning of the movie credits. Hopper filmed scenes for &quot;The Other Side of the Wind&quot; in 1971, appearing as himself; after decades of legal, financial and technical delays, the film was finally released on Netflix in 2018.

==Photography and art==

Hopper had several artistic pursuits beyond film. He was a prolific photographer, painter, and sculptor.

Hopper&#x27;s fascination with art began with painting lessons at the Nelson-Atkins Museum while still a child in Kansas City, Missouri. Early in his career, he painted and wrote poetry, though many of his works were destroyed in the 1961 Bel Air Fire, which burned hundreds of homes, including his and his wife&#x27;s, on Stone Canyon Road in Bel Air. His painting style ranges from abstract impressionism to photorealism and often includes references to his cinematic work and to other artists.

Ostracized by the Hollywood film studios due to his reputation for being a &quot;difficult&quot; actor, Hopper turned to photography in 1961 with a camera bought for him by his first wife Brooke Hayward. During this period he created the cover art for the Ike &amp; Tina Turner album &quot;River Deep – Mountain High&quot; (released in 1966). He became a prolific photographer, and noted writer Terry Southern profiled Hopper in &quot;Better Homes and Gardens&quot; as an up-and-coming photographer &quot;to watch&quot; in the mid-1960s. Hopper&#x27;s early photography is known for portraits from the 1960s, and he began shooting portraits for &quot;Vogue&quot; and other magazines. His photographs of Martin Luther King, Jr.&#x27;s 1963 March on Washington and the 1965 civil-rights march in Selma, Alabama, were published. His intimate and unguarded images of Andy Warhol, Jane Fonda, The Byrds, Paul Newman, Jasper Johns, Claes Oldenburg, Robert Rauschenberg, James Brown, Peter Fonda, Ed Ruscha, the Grateful Dead, Michael McClure, and Timothy Leary, among others, became the subject of gallery and museum shows and were collected in several books, including &quot;1712 North Crescent Heights&quot;. The book, whose title refers to the house where he lived with Hayward in the Hollywood Hills in the 1960s, was edited by his daughter Marin Hopper. In 1960–67, before the making of &quot;Easy Rider&quot;, Hopper created 18,000 images that chronicled the remarkable artists, musicians, actors, places, happenings, demonstrations, and concerts of that period. &quot;Dennis Hopper: Photographs 1961–1967&quot; was published in February 2011, by Taschen. German film director Wim Wenders said of Hopper that if &quot;he&#x27;d only been a photographer, he&#x27;d be one of the great photographers of the twentieth century.&quot; In &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Hopper, as photographer, was described as &quot;a compelling, important, and weirdly omnipresent chronicler of his times.&quot;

Hopper began working as a painter and a poet as well as a collector of art in the 1960s as well, particularly Pop Art. Over his lifetime he amassed a formidable array of 20th- and 21st-century art, including many of Julian Schnabel&#x27;s works (such as a shattered-plate portrait of Hopper); numerous works from his early cohorts, such as Ed Ruscha, Edward Kienholz, Roy Lichtenstein (&quot;Sinking Sun&quot;, 1964), and Warhol (&quot;Double Mona Lisa&quot;, 1963); and pieces by contemporary artists such as Damien Hirst and Robin Rhode. He was involved in L.A.&#x27;s Ferus and Virginia Dwan galleries in the 1960s, and he was a longtime friend and supporter to New York dealer Tony Shafrazi. One of the first art works Hopper owned was an early print of Andy Warhol&#x27;s Campbell&#x27;s Soup Cans bought for US$75. Hopper also once owned Warhol&#x27;s &quot;Mao&quot;, which he shot one evening in a fit of paranoia, the two bullet holes possibly adding to the print&#x27;s value. The print sold at Christie&#x27;s, New York, for US$302,500 in January 2011.

During his lifetime, Hopper&#x27;s own work as well as his collection was shown in monographic and group exhibitions around the world including the Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington D.C.; Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota; the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; the State Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg; MAK Vienna: Austrian Museum of Applied Arts/Contemporary Art, Vienna; the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; and the Cinémathèque Française, Paris, and the Australian Centre for the Moving Image, Melbourne. In March 2010, it was announced that Hopper was on the &quot;short list&quot; for Jeffrey Deitch&#x27;s inaugural show at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (MOCA). In April 2010, Deitch confirmed that Hopper&#x27;s work, curated by Julian Schnabel, will indeed be the focus of his debut at MOCA. The title of the exhibition, &quot;Double Standard&quot;, was taken from Hopper&#x27;s iconic 1961 photograph of the two Standard Oil signs seen through an automobile windshield at the intersection of Santa Monica Boulevard, Melrose Avenue, and North Doheny Drive on historic Route 66 in Los Angeles. The image was reproduced on the invitation for Ed Ruscha&#x27;s second solo exhibition at Ferus Gallery in 1964.

In 2011, Barricade Books published film historian Peter L. Winkler&#x27;s biography, &quot;Dennis Hopper: The Wild Ride of a Hollywood Rebel&quot;. In 2013, HarperCollins published &quot;Hopper: A Journey into the American Dream&quot;, a biography by American writer Tom Folsom.

On the Gorillaz album &quot;Demon Days&quot;, Hopper narrates the song &quot;Fire Coming Out of the Monkey&#x27;s Head&quot;.

In the late 1980s, Hopper purchased a trio of nearly identical two-story, loft-style condominiums at 330 Indiana Avenue in Venice Beach, California – one made of concrete, one of plywood, and one of green roofing shingles – built by Frank Gehry and two artist friends of Hopper&#x27;s, Chuck Arnoldi and Laddie John Dill, in 1981. In 1987, he commissioned an industrial-style main residence, with a corrugated metal exterior designed by Brian Murphy, as a place to display his artwork.

==Personal life==

According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, Hopper was &quot;one of Hollywood&#x27;s most notorious drug addicts&quot; for 20 years. He spent much of the 1970s and early 1980s living as an &quot;outcast&quot; in Taos, New Mexico, after the success of &quot;Easy Rider&quot;. Hopper was also &quot;notorious for his troubled relationships with women&quot;, including Michelle Phillips, who divorced him after eight days of marriage. Hopper was married five times:
* Brooke Hayward, married 1961 – divorced 1969, 1 child, daughter Marin Hopper (b. 1962);
* Michelle Phillips, married October 31, 1970 – divorced November 8, 1970;
* Daria Halprin, married 1972 – divorced 1976, 1 child, daughter Ruthanna Hopper (b. 1972);
* Katherine LaNasa, married June 17, 1989 – divorced April 1992, 1 child, son Henry Hopper (b. 1990);
* Victoria Duffy, married April 13, 1996 – separated January 12, 2010, 1 child, daughter Galen Grier Hopper (b. 2003).

Hopper has been widely reported to be the godfather of actress Amber Tamblyn; in a 2009 interview with &quot;Parade&quot;, Tamblyn explained that &quot;godfather&quot; was &quot;just a loose term&quot; for Hopper, Dean Stockwell and Neil Young, three famous friends of her father&#x27;s, who were always around the house when she was growing up, and who were big influences on her life.

In 1994, Rip Torn filed a defamation lawsuit against Hopper over a story Hopper told on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;. Hopper claimed that Torn pulled a knife on him during pre-production of the film &quot;Easy Rider&quot;. According to Hopper, Torn was originally cast in the film but was replaced with Jack Nicholson after the incident. According to Torn&#x27;s suit, it was actually Hopper who pulled the knife on him. A judge ruled in Torn&#x27;s favor and Hopper was ordered to pay US$475,000 in damages. Hopper then appealed but the judge again ruled in Torn&#x27;s favor and Hopper was required to pay another US$475,000 in punitive damages.

According to Newsmeat, Hopper donated US$2,000 to the Republican National Committee in 2004 and an equal amount in 2005. Hopper donated $600 to Irish political party Sinn Féin.

Hopper was honored with the rank of commander of France&#x27;s National Order of Arts and Letters, at a ceremony in Paris.

Despite being a Republican, Hopper supported Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election. Hopper confirmed this in an election day appearance on the ABC daytime show &quot;The View&quot;. He said his reason for not voting Republican was the selection of Sarah Palin as the Republican vice presidential candidate.

Hopper was a longtime friend of actress Sally Kirkland, who admitted in a 2021 Reelz documentary that they had a one-night stand early on in their friendship.

===Divorce from Victoria Duffy===
On January 14, 2010, Hopper filed for divorce from his fifth wife Victoria Duffy. After citing her &quot;outrageous conduct&quot; and stating she was &quot;insane&quot;, &quot;inhuman&quot; and &quot;volatile&quot;, Hopper was granted a restraining order against her on February 11, 2010, and as a result, she was forbidden to come within of him or contact him. On March 9, 2010, Duffy refused to move out of the Hopper home, despite the court&#x27;s order that she do so by March 15.

On April 5, 2010, a court ruled that Duffy could continue living on Hopper&#x27;s property, and that he must pay US$12,000 per month spousal and child support for their daughter Galen. Hopper did not attend the hearing. On May 12, 2010, a hearing was held before Judge Amy Pellman in downtown Los Angeles Superior Court. Though Hopper died two weeks later, Duffy insisted at the hearing that he was well enough to be deposed. The hearing also dealt with who would be the beneficiary on Hopper&#x27;s life insurance policy, which listed his wife as a beneficiary. A very ill Hopper did not appear in court though his estranged wife did. Despite Duffy&#x27;s bid to be named the sole beneficiary of Hopper&#x27;s million-dollar policy, the judge ruled against her and limited her claim to one-quarter of the policy. The remaining US$750,000 was to go to his estate.

==Illness and death==

On September 28, 2009, Hopper, then 73, was reportedly taken by ambulance to an unidentified Manhattan hospital wearing an oxygen mask and &quot;with numerous tubes visible&quot;. On October 2, he was discharged after receiving treatment for dehydration.

On October 29, 2009, Hopper&#x27;s manager Sam Maydew reported that he had been diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer. In January 2010, it was reported that Hopper&#x27;s cancer had metastasized to his bones.

On March 18, 2010, he was honored with the 2,403rd star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in front of Grauman&#x27;s Egyptian Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard. Surrounded by family, fans, and friends—including Jack Nicholson, Viggo Mortensen, David Lynch, and Michael Madsen—he attended its addition to the sidewalk six days later.

By March 2010, Hopper reportedly weighed only and was unable to carry on long conversations. According to papers filed in his divorce court case, Hopper was terminally ill and was unable to undergo chemotherapy to treat his prostate cancer.

Hopper died at his home in the coastal Venice district of Los Angeles, on May 29, 2010, at age 74. His funeral took place on June 3, 2010, at San Francisco de Asis Mission Church in Ranchos de Taos, New Mexico. His body was buried at the Jesus Nazareno Cemetery in Ranchos de Taos.
The film &quot;Alpha and Omega&quot;, which was among his last film roles, was dedicated to him, as was the 2011 film &quot;Restless&quot;, which starred his son Henry Hopper.

<text>The Detroit Red Wings (colloquially referred to as the Wings) are a professional ice hockey team based in Detroit. The Red Wings compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Atlantic Division in the Eastern Conference. The franchise is one of the Original Six of the league. Founded in 1926, the team was known as the Detroit Cougars until 1930. For the next two seasons, the team was named the Detroit Falcons, before changing their name to the Red Wings in 1932.

The Red Wings have won the most Stanley Cup championships of any NHL franchise based in the United States (11), and are third overall amongst active teams in total Stanley Cup championships, behind the Montreal Canadiens (24) and Toronto Maple Leafs (13). The Wings played their home games at Joe Louis Arena from 1979 until 2017, after playing for 52 years at Olympia Stadium. They moved into Little Caesars Arena beginning with the 2017–18 season. The Red Wings are one of the most popular and successful franchises in the NHL; fans and sports commentators refer to the Detroit area as &quot;Hockeytown&quot;, which has been a registered trademark owned by the franchise since 1996.

Between the 1931–32 and 1965–66 seasons, the Red Wings missed the playoffs only four times. They struggled between the 1966–67 and 1982–83 seasons, only making the playoffs twice in that stretch. After that, however, from 1983–84 to 2015–16, they made the playoffs 30 times in 32 seasons, including 25 straight from 1990–91 to 2015–16 (not including the cancelled 2004–05 season); in 2006, this became the longest active streak of postseason appearances in all of North American professional sports and finished tied for the third-longest streak in NHL history. Since 1983–84, the Red Wings have tallied six regular season first-place finishes and have won the Stanley Cup four times (1997, 1998, 2002, and 2008).

==History==
===Early years (1926–1949)===

Following the 1926 Stanley Cup playoffs, during which the Western Hockey League (WHL) was widely reported to be on the verge of folding, the NHL held a meeting on April 17 to consider applications for expansion franchises, at which it was reported that five different groups sought a team for Detroit. During a subsequent meeting on May 15, the league approved a franchise to the Townsend-Seyburn group of Detroit and named Charles A. Hughes as governor. WHL owners Frank and Lester Patrick made a deal to sell the league&#x27;s players to the NHL and cease league operations. The new Detroit franchise purchased the players of the WHL&#x27;s Victoria Cougars, who had won the Stanley Cup in 1925 and had made the Finals the previous winter, to play for the team. The new Detroit franchise also adopted the Cougars&#x27; nickname in honor of the folded franchise.

Since no arena in Detroit was ready at the time, the Cougars played their first season at the Border Cities Arena in Windsor, Ontario. For the 1927–28 season, the Cougars moved into the new Detroit Olympia, which would be their home rink until December 15, 1979. This was also the first season behind the bench for Jack Adams, who would be the face of the franchise for the next 36 years as either coach or general manager.

The Cougars made the Stanley Cup playoffs for the first time in 1929, with Carson Cooper leading the team in scoring. The Cougars were outscored 7–2 in the two-game series with the Toronto Maple Leafs. In 1930, the Cougars were renamed the Falcons, but their woes continued, as they usually finished near the bottom of the standings, even though they made the playoffs again in 1932.

In 1932, the NHL let grain merchant James E. Norris, who had made two previous unsuccessful bids to buy an NHL team, purchase the Falcons. Norris&#x27; first act was to rename the team; earlier in the century, Norris had been a member of the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association (MAAA), a multi-sport club whose winged-wheel emblem derived from its cycling roots, and whose hockey team won the first Stanley Cup in 1893. Norris decided that a red version of the MAAA &quot;Winged Wheelers&quot; logo would be perfect for a team playing in the &quot;Motor City&quot;, and on October 5, 1932, the club was renamed the Detroit Red Wings. Norris also placed coach Jack Adams on a one-year probation for the 1932–33 NHL season. Adams managed to pass his probationary period by leading the Red Wings to their first-ever playoff series victory, over the Montreal Maroons. The team then lost in the semifinals to the New York Rangers.

In 1934, the Red Wings made the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time, with John Sorrell scoring 21 goals over 47 games and Larry Aurie leading the team in scoring. However, the Chicago Black Hawks defeated the Red Wings in the Finals, winning the best-of-five series in four games to claim their first title. Two seasons later, the Red Wings won their first Stanley Cup in 1936, defeating Toronto in four games. Detroit repeated as Stanley Cup champions in 1937, winning over the Rangers in the full five games. In 1938, the Montreal Canadiens and the Red Wings became the first NHL teams to play in Europe, playing in Paris and London. The Wings played nine games against the Canadiens and went 3–5–1. They did not play in Europe again until the pre-season and start of the 2009–10 NHL season, in Sweden, against the St. Louis Blues.
The Red Wings made the Stanley Cup Finals in three consecutive years during the early 1940s. In 1941, they were swept by the Boston Bruins, and in 1942, they lost a seven-game series to Toronto after winning the first three games. However, in 1943, with Mud Bruneteau and Syd Howe scoring 23 and 20 goals, respectively, Detroit won their third Stanley Cup by sweeping the Bruins. Through the rest of the decade, the team made the playoffs every year, and reached the Finals three more times.

In 1946, one of the greatest players in hockey history came into the NHL with the Red Wings. Gordie Howe, a right winger from Floral, Saskatchewan, only scored seven goals and 15 assists in his first season, and would not reach his prime for a few more years. It was also the last season as head coach for Adams, who stepped down after the season to concentrate on his duties as general manager and was succeeded by minor league coach Tommy Ivan. By his second season, Howe was paired with Sid Abel and Ted Lindsay to form what would become one of the great lines in NHL history: the &quot;Production Line&quot;. Lindsay&#x27;s 33 goals propelled the Red Wings to the Stanley Cup Finals, where they were swept by the Maple Leafs. Detroit reached the Finals again the following season, only to be swept again by Toronto.

===Gordie Howe era (1950–1966)===
During the 1950 semifinals, Leo Reise Jr. scored the winning goal in overtime, which prevented the Maple Leafs from winning four straight championships. In the Finals, the Red Wings defeated the New York Rangers in seven games. In Game 7, Pete Babando scored the game winner in double overtime. After the game, Lindsay skated around the Olympia ice with the Stanley Cup.

After being upset by the Montreal Canadiens in the 1951 semifinals, Detroit won its fifth Stanley Cup in 1952, sweeping both the Maple Leafs and the Canadiens, with the Production Line of Howe, Abel and Lindsay joined by second-year goaltender Terry Sawchuk. Detroit became the first team in 17 years to go undefeated in the playoffs. They also scored 24 playoff goals, compared to Toronto and Montreal&#x27;s combined total of 5. Abel left the Red Wings for Chicago during the off-season, and his spot on the roster was replaced by Alex Delvecchio. In December 1952, James E. Norris died. He was succeeded as team president by his daughter, Marguerite, which made her the first woman to head an NHL franchise.
Following another playoff upset in 1953 at the hands of the Bruins, the Red Wings won back-to-back Stanley Cups, beating the rival powerhouse Montreal Canadiens. Both of the Stanley Cup Finals played between the two teams were decided in seven games. The seventh game during the 1954 Stanley Cup Finals was won with one of the oddest cup winning goals ever, when the 5&#x27;7&quot; left winger Tony Leswick, known more for his relentless checking than scoring prowess, shot a puck towards the Montreal goal from the middle of the ice. Habs defenseman Doug Harvey tried to gain control of the wobbly puck with his glove but instead redirected it past Montreal goalie Gerry McNeil. The repeat of the series the season after was closely contested, as all seven games were won by the home team, with Detroit taking the seventh game. Montreal was sorely lacking its all-star Maurice Richard, who was suspended after hitting a linesman during the regular season, and the Red Wings&#x27; stars carried their team, as Lindsay scored four goals in a single game and Howe scored 20 points during the playoffs, 12 of which during the Finals, all new records in the league.

The 1954–55 season ended a run of seven straight regular season titles, an NHL record. During the 1955 off-season, Marguerite Norris lost an intra-family power struggle, and was forced to turn over the Red Wings to her younger brother Bruce. Detroit and Montreal once again met, in the 1956 Stanley Cup Finals, but this time the Canadiens won the Stanley Cup, their first of five in a row. In 1957, Lindsay, who had scored 30 goals and led the league in assists with 55, teamed up with Harvey to help start the National Hockey League Players&#x27; Association (NHLPA). As a result, he and goaltender Glenn Hall were promptly traded to Chicago.

In 1959, the Red Wings missed the playoffs for the first time in 21 years. However, within a couple of years, the franchise was able to rejuvenate itself. The Red Wings made the Finals in four of the next six years between 1961 and 1966. However, they came away empty-handed.

===&quot;Dead Wings&quot; era (1967–1982)===

Only a year after making the Finals, the Red Wings finished a distant fifth, 24 points out of the playoffs. It was the beginning of a slump that they would not emerge from in almost 20 years. This period is derisively known as the &quot;Dead Wings&quot; era.

One factor in the Red Wings&#x27; decline was the end of the old development system. Another factor was Ned Harkness, who was hired as coach in 1970 and was promoted to general manager midway through the season. A successful college hockey coach, Harkness tried to force his two-way style of play on a veteran Red Wings team resistant to change. They chafed under his rule in which he demanded short hair and no smoking, and put other rules in place regarding drinking and phone calls. Harkness was forced to resign in 1974, ending the period colloquially referred to as &quot;Darkness with Harkness&quot;.

During the expansion season of 1967–68, the Red Wings acquired longtime star left-winger Frank Mahovlich from the defending Cup champions in Toronto. Mahovlich would go on a line with Howe and Delvecchio, and in 1968–69, he scored a career-high 49 goals and had two All-Star seasons in Detroit. However, Mahovlich was traded to Montreal in 1971, while Howe announced his retirement the same year. Throughout the decade, the Red Wings were hampered due to a number of factors.

On December 27, 1979, during the 1979–80 season, the Red Wings officially began playing at the Joe Louis Arena after leaving the Olympia, where they had played since 1927. In 1982, after 50 years of family ownership, Bruce Norris sold the Red Wings to Mike Ilitch, founder of the pizza chain Little Caesars.

===Steve Yzerman era (1983–2006)===
In 1983, the Red Wings drafted Steve Yzerman, a center from the Peterborough Petes, with their first-round pick. He led the team in scoring in his rookie year. That season, with John Ogrodnick, Ivan Boldirev, Ron Duguay, and Brad Park, Detroit made the playoffs for the first time in six years, with Park ended up winning the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy. He was later asked to coach the Red Wings after they fired Harry Neale 35 games into the 1985–86 season, however, he was fired on June 3, 1986, after they finished last place with a 17–57–6 record for only 40 points, the worst record in the league. This was the same year that the Red Wings added enforcer Bob Probert, one of the most familiar faces of the team during the 1980s and 1990s.
In the 1986–87 season, with Yzerman, now the captain following the departure of Danny Gare, joined by Petr Klima, Adam Oates, Gerard Gallant, defenseman Darren Veitch, and new head coach Jacques Demers, the Red Wings won a playoff series for only the second time in the modern era. They made it all the way to the conference finals against the powerful Edmonton Oilers, but lost to the eventual Stanley Cup champions in five games. In 1988, they won their first division title in 23 years. They did so, however, in a relatively weak division, as no other team in the Norris finished above .500. As was the case in the previous season, they made it to the conference finals only to lose again to the eventual Stanley Cup champion Oilers in five games.

In 1989, Yzerman scored a career-best 65 goals, but Detroit was upset in the first round by the Chicago Blackhawks. The following season, Yzerman scored 62 goals, but the team missed the playoffs.

After the season, Demers was fired and was replaced by Bryan Murray as the new head coach. Murray was unable to get them back over .500, but they returned to the playoffs. Yzerman was joined by Sergei Fedorov, who would be an award-winner and frequent all-star for the team during the 1990s. In 1991, the team signed free agent Ray Sheppard, who would score a career-best 52 goals three years later. In 1993, the Red Wings acquired top defenseman Paul Coffey. Also joining the Red Wings around this time were draft picks Vladimir Konstantinov, Nicklas Lidstrom, Vyacheslav Kozlov, Darren McCarty, and Chris Osgood.

====The Russian Five and back-to-back Stanley Cups (1994–1998)====
In 1993, former Montreal Canadiens coach Scotty Bowman was hired as the new head coach. In his second season, the lockout-shortened 1994–95 NHL season, Bowman guided Detroit to its first Finals appearance in 29 years, only to be swept by the New Jersey Devils.

During the 1995–96 season, the Red Wings won a then NHL record 62 games. However, after defeating the St. Louis Blues in seven games, they would fall in the conference finals to the eventual Stanley Cup champions, the Colorado Avalanche.

The following season, the Red Wings acquired Brendan Shanahan and Larry Murphy. In the playoffs, they would defeat the St. Louis Blues, the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim and the Avalanche in the first three rounds. In the Finals, the Red Wings swept the Philadelphia Flyers. It was their first Stanley Cup since 1955, breaking the longest drought (42 years long) in the league at that time. Mike Vernon was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy.

Misfortune befell the Red Wings six days after their championship; defenseman Vladimir Konstantinov, one of the members of the &quot;Russian Five&quot;, suffered a brain injury in a limousine accident, and his career came to an abrupt end. As a result, the team dedicated the 1997–98 season to him. The Red Wings won the Stanley Cup in four games, this time over the Washington Capitals, and Konstantinov was brought onto the ice in his wheelchair so he could touch it.

====Superstar acquisitions and more success (1999–2006)====
The following season, the Red Wings appeared to be poised to win a third consecutive Stanley Cup when they acquired three-time Norris Trophy winner Chris Chelios from his hometown Chicago Blackhawks in March 1999. Also acquired at the trade deadline were defenseman Ulf Samuelsson, winger Wendel Clark, and goaltender Bill Ranford. Despite high aspirations, however, Detroit would end up losing in the conference semifinals to Colorado in six games. In 2000, the Red Wings would finish second in the Central Division. Just like the previous season, however, they would lose to the Avalanche in the Western Conference semi-finals.
In 2001, Detroit, the NHL&#x27;s second-best team in the regular season, were upset in the playoffs by the Los Angeles Kings. During the ensuing off-season, the team acquired goaltender Dominik Hasek (the defending Vezina Trophy winner) and forwards Luc Robitaille and Brett Hull. Russian prospect Pavel Datsyuk also joined the team. Strengthened by the additions, the Red Wings posted the league&#x27;s best record in the 2001–02 regular season and defeated Colorado in seven games in the conference finals after beating the Vancouver Canucks and St. Louis Blues in rounds one and two. The Red Wings then went on to capture another Stanley Cup, in five games, over the Carolina Hurricanes, with Nicklas Lidstrom winning the Conn Smythe Trophy as the playoffs&#x27; MVP. Bowman and Hasek both retired after the season.

The 2002 off-season saw the Red Wings promote associate coach Dave Lewis to the head coach position after Bowman&#x27;s retirement. In the market for a new starting goaltender after Hasek&#x27;s retirement, they signed Curtis Joseph from the Toronto Maple Leafs to a three-year, $24 million deal. Also new to the lineup was highly touted Swedish prospect Henrik Zetterberg. The Red Wings finished the season second in the Western Conference, which pitted them in the 2003 playoffs against the seventh-seeded Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. The Mighty Ducks shocked the ice hockey world when they swept the Red Wings in four games en route to a Stanley Cup Finals appearance.

In the off-season, long time Red Wing Fedorov signed with the Mighty Ducks as a free agent. Additionally, Hasek opted to come out of retirement and join the Red Wings for the 2003–04 season. Joseph, despite being one of the highest-paid players in the NHL, spent part of the season in the minor leagues. Hasek himself would be sidelined with a groin injury. Notwithstanding, the Red Wings would finish atop of the Central Division and the NHL standings. The Red Wings eliminated the Nashville Predators in six games in the first round of the 2004 playoffs, which led to a second round match-up with the Calgary Flames. The teams split the first four games, and headed to Detroit for a pivotal Game 5, which the Red Wings lost 1–0. They were then eliminated two nights later in Calgary by the same score in overtime. The Red Wings did not play in the 2004–05 season due to the lockout, which cancelled the entire NHL season.
On July 15, 2005, Mike Babcock, former head coach in Anaheim, became the new head coach for the Red Wings. On November 21, 2005, defenseman Jiri Fischer went into cardiac arrest and collapsed on the bench during a game against the Nashville Predators. The game was cancelled because of his injury and was made up on January 23, 2006. This was the first time in NHL history a game had been postponed due to an injury. While the game was played for the full 60 minutes, the Predators were allowed to maintain their 1–0 lead from the original game and won 3–2. The Red Wings won the Presidents&#x27; Trophy with a 58–16–8 record, earning them 124 points and secured home ice advantage for the entire playoffs. They opened the 2006 playoffs against the Edmonton Oilers with a 3–2 overtime victory at Joe Louis Arena, but the Oilers won four of the next five games to take the series.

Continuing the shakeup of the Red Wings roster, the off-season saw the departure of Brendan Shanahan, the return of Dominik Hasek and the retirement of Steve Yzerman. Yzerman retired with the distinction of having been the longest-serving team captain in NHL history.

===The &quot;Euro-Twins&quot; era (2006–2017)===
The Red Wings opened the 2006–07 season with Nicklas Lidstrom as the new captain. The team retired Yzerman&#x27;s jersey number 19 on January 2, 2007. The Red Wings finished first in the Western Conference and tied for first in the NHL with the Buffalo Sabres, but the Sabres were awarded the Presidents&#x27; Trophy because they had more wins. Detroit advanced to the third round of the 2007 playoffs after defeating Calgary and the San Jose Sharks both in six games, coming back to win three-straight after the Sharks had a 2–1 series lead. The Red Wings would then lose to the eventual Stanley Cup champion Anaheim Ducks in the conference finals in six games.
To start the 2007–08 campaign, Zetterberg recorded at least a point in each of Detroit&#x27;s first 17 games, setting a club record. The Wings cruised to the playoffs, where they faced the Nashville Predators. After goaltender Dominik Hasek played poorly in Games 3 and 4 of the series, both losses, head coach Mike Babcock replaced him with Chris Osgood. Osgood never left the net for the remainder of the playoffs, as the Red Wings came back in that series in six games. In the second round, they swept the Colorado Avalanche in four games. They then went on to the Stanley Cup Finals after defeating the Dallas Stars in six games in the conference finals. The Red Wings won the Stanley Cup against the Pittsburgh Penguins in Game 6 on June 4, 2008, by the score of 3–2. This was the Red Wings&#x27; fourth Stanley Cup in 11 years and their 11th overall in franchise history. Zetterberg scored the winning goal in the decisive game, and was also named the winner of the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player of the playoffs. It was the first time a team captained by a non-North American player (Lidstrom) won the Stanley Cup.

On July 2, 2008, the Red Wings announced the signing of Marian Hossa. On January 1, 2009, the Red Wings played the Chicago Blackhawks in the second NHL Winter Classic at Chicago&#x27;s Wrigley Field, defeating them 6–4. Although they finished second in the conference to the San Jose Sharks, the Wings became the first team in NHL history to top 100 points in nine straight seasons. In the playoffs, the Red Wings swept the Columbus Blue Jackets, then defeated the eighth-seeded Anaheim Ducks in a hard-fought seven-game series. They took on the vastly improved Chicago Blackhawks in the conference finals, winning in five games. The Red Wings would face the Pittsburgh Penguins in the Finals for a second consecutive year, but this series would feature a different outcome as the Penguins defeated the Red Wings in seven games. The Red Wings became only the second NHL team to lose the Stanley Cup at home in Game 7.

The Red Wings began the 2009–10 NHL season in Stockholm, losing both games to the St. Louis Blues 4–3 and 5–3, respectively. They were plagued by injuries throughout the season and lost the second most man games to injury, with only the last place Edmonton Oilers losing more. The beginning of the season was a struggle for the Red Wings, with key players out of the lineup, including Zetterberg, Tomas Holmstrom, Johan Franzen, Valtteri Filppula and Niklas Kronwall. After the Olympic break, Detroit posted a record of 13–3–2 and earned 28 points, the most by any team in the NHL. This run helped them secure the fifth playoff seed in the Western Conference. This, however, was the first time the Red Wings did not have home ice advantage in a playoff series in ten seasons. Detroit won their first-round playoff series over the Phoenix Coyotes in seven games. In the second round, they would be defeated by the San Jose Sharks in five games.
A healthier Red Wings team finished the 2010–11 NHL season with a 47–25–10 record and 104 points to win the Central Division title. They once again faced the Phoenix Coyotes in the first round of the playoffs, this time sweeping them 4–0. The Red Wings then went on to face the Sharks in round two. After losing the first three games of the series, the Red Wings won three consecutive games to force a Game 7, becoming just the eighth team in NHL history to accomplish the feat. The Red Wings lost Game 7 to the Sharks by a score of 3–2 and were eliminated.

During the 2011 off-season, Red Wings defenseman Brian Rafalski retired. Detroit soon signed free agent defenseman Ian White to take his place. Long-time Red Wings Chris Osgood and Kris Draper also announced their retirement from hockey, with both soon taking positions within the club. Detroit signed goaltender Ty Conklin for his second stint with the team. Tragedy struck the organization and the rest of the NHL with the 2011 Lokomotiv Yaroslavl plane crash, which killed former Red Wings assistant coach Brad McCrimmon and defenseman Ruslan Salei, who had joined the KHL team during the summer. Stefan Liv, a former Red Wings goaltending prospect, was also among the fatalities. The Red Wings then added a patch to the left arm of their uniforms with the trio&#x27;s initials.

During the season, the Red Wings won an NHL-record 23 consecutive home games. The Red Wings also made the NHL playoffs, extending their streak of 21-straight playoff appearances, as the fifth seed. They were defeated in five games by their opening round opponent, the Nashville Predators. On May 31, 2012, Nicklas Lidstrom retired.

Zetterberg was named successor to Lidstrom as team captain. On July 1, 2012, the first day of the NHL free agency period, the Red Wings signed Swiss forward Damien Brunner to a one-year, entry-level contract; forward Jordin Tootoo to a three-year, $5.7 million contract; and goaltender Jonas Gustavsson to a two-year, $3 million deal.
The team won their final four games of the 2012–13 season to earn the seventh seed of the playoffs. The Red Wings&#x27; 3–0 victory over the Dallas Stars on April 27, 2013, preserved their streak of 22 consecutive playoff appearances. As the seventh seed in the 2013 playoffs, the Red Wings faced the second-seeded Anaheim Ducks. They survived a fierce battle that included four overtime games, winning the series 4–3 after a 3–2 Game 7 victory in Anaheim. The next round pitted the Red Wings against the top-seeded Chicago Blackhawks. Despite jumping out to a 3–1 series lead, the Red Wings would ultimately lose to the eventual Stanley Cup champions in seven games.

On July 5, 2013, the Red Wings signed long time Ottawa Senators captain Daniel Alfredsson to a one-year contract and long time Florida Panther Stephen Weiss to a five-year contract. In the 2013–14 season, the Red Wings moved to the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference as part of the NHL&#x27;s realignment. The move to the Eastern Conference allowed them to play a majority of their games against teams in the Eastern Time Zone. On April 9, 2014, the Red Wings clinched their 23rd consecutive playoff appearance. They would be eliminated in the first round by the Boston Bruins.

On April 9, 2015, the Red Wings clinched their 24th consecutive playoff appearance, thus extending their streak. The team was eliminated in the first round by the Tampa Bay Lightning. Petr Mrazek had earned the starting goaltender role from Jimmy Howard, and Kronwall was suspended for Game 7 as Tampa Bay erased a 3–2 deficit to win the series. Mike Babcock, concluding the final year of his contract, left the Red Wings to become the new head coach of the Toronto Maple Leafs. Jeff Blashill, head coach of the Red Wings&#x27; top minor league affiliate, the Grand Rapids Griffins, was named his successor on June 9.

On April 9, 2016, despite the Red Wings losing 3–2 to the New York Rangers, the Ottawa Senators defeated the Boston Bruins 6–1 as the Red Wings narrowly made the playoffs and extended their streak to a 25th season. They would lose in the first round to the Lightning again, this time in five games.

During the off-season, Datsyuk decided to return to Russia. On February 10, 2017, club owner Mike Ilitch died. The Red Wings&#x27; playoff streak ended after 25 seasons in the 2016–17 season. The Red Wings won their last game at Joe Louis Arena 4–1 on April 9, 2017, against the New Jersey Devils.

===The opening of Little Caesars Arena and rebuilding (2017–present)===

The Red Wings played their first regular season game at Little Caesars Arena on October 5, 2017, winning 4–2 over the Minnesota Wild. The Red Wings finished the 2017–18 season with a 30–39–13 record. They missed the playoffs for the second season in a row, marking the first time since the early 1980s the team missed the playoffs in consecutive years. The Red Wings finished the 2018–19 season with a 32–40–10 record, missing the playoffs for a third consecutive season.

On April 19, 2019, the Red Wings announced that Steve Yzerman rejoined the team as general manager and executive vice president. On February 21, 2020, the Red Wings became the first team to be eliminated from playoff contention before the trade deadline since the 2003–04 Pittsburgh Penguins. On March 10, 2020, the Red Wings clinched the worst overall record in NHL for the first time since the 1985–86 season. On March 12, the 2019–20 season was suspended by the NHL due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On May 26, 2020, the NHL announced that the rest of the season was over for the seven teams that did not qualify for the 24-team Stanley Cup playoffs, which included the Red Wings. With a record of 17–49–5, this was the first time since the 1985–86 season that the Red Wings finished with fewer than 20 wins. The Red Wings also became the second team since the 2004–05 NHL lockout, and the subsequent start of the salary cap era, to finish with a sub-.300 points percentage, along with the 2016–17 Colorado Avalanche. Their .275 points percentage was the worst for an NHL team since the 1999–2000 Atlanta Thrashers.

Dylan Larkin was named the Red Wings captain on January 13, 2021, who succeeded Henrik Zetterberg following his retirement in 2018. On April 26, the Red Wings were eliminated from playoff contention for the fifth consecutive season. They would ultimately finish with a 19–27–10 record. The Red Wings finished the 2021–22 season at 32–40–10. They missed the playoff for the sixth consecutive season. On April 30, 2022, Jeff Blashill was fired as head coach. They then hired Derek Lalonde as their head coach on June 30, 2022. During 2022–23 season, the Red Wings would re-sign Dylan Larkin to an eight-year contract extension. The Red Wings finished the season at 35–37–10. They missed the playoffs for the seventh consecutive season. The Red Wings finished the 2023–24 season with a 41–32–9 record. However, they were eliminated from playoff contention for the eighth consecutive season via tiebreaker on April 16, 2024, after the Washington Capitals&#x27; 2–1 win over the Philadelphia Flyers.

On December 26, 2024, after a slow start to the 2024–25 season, the Red Wings fired head coach Lalonde and assistant head coach Bob Boughner. Todd McLellan was hired as their new head coach, with Trent Yawney as an assistant head coach.

==Team information==

===Logo and uniforms===
The Red Wings&#x27; jerseys (traditionally known in hockey as &quot;sweaters&quot;) have been more or less the same since the 1930s – a white or red base with red or white piping. The only significant changes have been the replacement of the word &quot;Detroit&quot; with the &quot;winged wheel&quot; logo in 1932, and vertical arch lettering for the players&#x27; names and block letters in 1983. The Red Wings wear the vertical arched letters in the regular season and playoffs, but use straight serifed nameplates during the preseason.

&quot;The Hockey News&quot; voted the Red Wings&#x27; &quot;winged wheel&quot; logo the second best in the league in 2008. The Red Wings, like all NHL teams, updated their jerseys to the new Rbk Edge standard for the 2007–08 NHL season. The Red Wings kept their design as close to original as possible, the exceptions being: On the road (white) jersey, there was more red on the sleeves as the color panel began closer to the shoulder, and the letters of the captain and alternate captains were moved to the right shoulder.

When Adidas became the uniform outfitter starting with the 2017–18 season, the Red Wings kept the same basic look.

The Red Wings have rarely used any alternate logos or uniforms since the trend became popular in the 1990s, the sole exceptions were select games of the 1991–92 season commemorating the league&#x27;s 75th anniversary, and for a commemorative game on January 27, 1994, at Chicago Stadium. Those jerseys were based on the uniforms worn by the team (then the Detroit Cougars) in 1927–28. The throwbacks are primarily white with five red horizontal stripes on the body, the broadest middle stripe bearing &quot;Detroit&quot; in bold letters, and three red stripes on the sleeves. This jersey served as the basis for the uniforms worn by Wayne Gretzky&#x27;s team of NHLPA All-Stars, nicknamed the &quot;99ers&quot;, for their exhibition tour in Europe during the 1994–95 NHL lockout.
The Red Wings wore alternative &quot;retro&quot; jerseys for the 2009 Winter Classic in Chicago. The jerseys were based on the uniforms worn by the Detroit Cougars during their inaugural season of 1926–27. These jerseys were white, with a single bold red stripe on the sleeves and chest, and a uniquely styled white Old English &quot;D&quot; centered on the chest stripe. These jerseys were also worn for their final 2009 regular season home game, again against the Chicago Blackhawks. The Red Wings again used an alternate jersey mimicking throwback jerseys for the 2014 Winter Classic against the Toronto Maple Leafs at Michigan Stadium.

The Red Wings wore a specially designed one-time-only jersey for their Stadium Series game in Denver against the Colorado Avalanche on February 27, 2016. The majority of this jersey was the traditional red, decorated with a thick diagonal white stripe running from the player&#x27;s right shoulder across the front towards the left hip. The bottom of each sleeve featured a thick white stripe from wrist to elbow. The crest on the front of the jersey was a stylized red &quot;D&quot;. The words &quot;Red Wings&quot; were printed in all capital letters on the left side of the collar, and the phrase &quot;EST. 1926&quot; was printed inside the back of the collar. These jerseys featured the current Red Wings logo on the left shoulder cap. The names and numbers were printed larger than traditional NHL jerseys to increase visibility and player identification for fans watching the game at Coors Field, a stadium traditionally used for Major League Baseball.

The Red Wings unveiled a uniform patch on September 27, 2016, to honor Gordie Howe, who died on June 10, 2016. The patch was a depiction of Howe&#x27;s jersey number 9 and was worn by the team above the logo on the front of the jersey on the left side of the chest for all 82 regular season games during the 2016–17 season.

The Red Wings wore a specially designed one-time-only jersey for the Centennial Classic in Toronto against the Toronto Maple Leafs on January 1, 2017. It was a white jersey that had four stripes on the arms. Three of the stripes were red, while the fourth was silver. On the silver stripes were the years the Red Wings won the Stanley Cup. The logo and numbers were outlined in silver.

For the 2020–21 season, the Red Wings wore special &quot;Reverse Retro&quot; alternate jerseys designed by Adidas. The uniform featured a white base and white sleeves inspired by the Red Wings&#x27; road uniforms of the Original Six era. Silver stripes replaced red stripes in commemoration of the team&#x27;s 11 Stanley Cup championships and the 2017 Centennial Classic. A second &quot;Reverse Retro&quot; uniform was unveiled in the 2022–23 season, using the 1991–92 throwback uniform based on the original Cougars&#x27; uniforms but with a red base and black stripes.

The Red Wings&#x27; logo received significant media attention in August 2017 when it was discovered that a white supremacist group used a modified version of it, in which the wheel&#x27;s spokes consisted of the occult SS symbol Black Sun; it was the aegis of their shields during the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. As a result, the Red Wings condemned the group for the usage of the logo and threatened legal action.

On February 29, 2024, the Red Wings announced their first ever jersey patch advertisement with Priority, a local waste management company.

For the Red Wings&#x27; appearance in the 2025 NHL Stadium Series, they wore white uniforms with a script &quot;Detroit&quot; lettering in red. The lower sleeves and socks were predominantly red, and the trademark &quot;winged wheel&quot; logo is on the left shoulder. The &quot;Hockeytown&quot; slogan was placed on the right leg. The uniforms were generally inspired by Detroit&#x27;s automotive industry and hockey culture.

===Fan traditions===
The &quot;Legend of the Octopus&quot; is a sports tradition during Detroit Red Wings playoff games, in which an octopus is thrown onto the ice surface for good luck. During the playoffs, Joe Louis Arena was generally adorned with a giant octopus with red eyes, nicknamed &quot;Al&quot; after former head ice manager Al Sobotka.

The 1952 playoffs featured the start of the octopus throw. The owner of a local fish market, Peter Cusimano, threw one from the stands onto the ice. The eight legs are symbolic of the eight wins it took to win the Stanley Cup at the time. The Red Wings went on to sweep both of their opponents that year en route to a Stanley Cup championship. The NHL has, at various times, tried to eliminate this tradition but it continues to this day.

Sobotka was responsible for removing the thrown creatures from the ice. When the Red Wings played at Joe Louis Arena, he was known for swinging the tossed octopuses above his head when walking off the ice. On April 19, 2008, the NHL sent a memo to the Red Wings that forbade this; they said that violating the mandate would result in a $10,000 fine. Instead, it was to up to the linesmen to remove the octopuses. In an email to the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;, NHL spokesman Frank Brown justified the ban because matter flew off the octopus and got on the ice when Sobotka swung it above his head. This ban was later loosened to allow for the octopus twirling to take place at the Zamboni entrance.

Typically during the last minute or two of games that the Red Wings are winning, especially around the end of the season and during the playoffs, fans are known to start singing along to Journey&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Believin&#x27;.&quot; The song is played over the PA system and continues until it is muted while the crowd sings the words &quot;Born and raised in South Detroit,&quot; then the song resumes over the speakers in the arena.

The Red Wings have retired eight numbers. The first number the Red Wings retired was No. 9 in 1972 in honor of Gordie Howe, who played right wing for the team from 1946 to 1971. Howe won both the Art Ross Trophy and the Hart Memorial Trophy six times each and won the Stanley Cup as a Red Wing four times. In 2007, the Red Wings retired Steve Yzerman&#x27;s No. 19. During Yzerman&#x27;s career, he won the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy, the Conn Smythe Trophy, the Frank J. Selke Trophy, the Lester Patrick Trophy, and the Ted Lindsay Award. Yzerman served as Detroit&#x27;s captain for 19 seasons, an NHL record, and won the Stanley Cup three times as a player with the Red Wings. The most recent retired number is Red Kelly&#x27;s No. 4, which was retired on February 1, 2019. During Kelly&#x27;s 13-year career with the Red Wings, he won four Stanley Cups, the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy three times, and the James Norris Memorial Trophy once.

The Red Wings have also made the number 6 of Larry Aurie and the number 16 of Vladimir Konstantinov no longer available for issue. However, the numbers are not considered to be officially retired. Although Aurie&#x27;s number was retired in 1938 by James E. Norris, current team owners do not consider the number to be retired. Konstantinov&#x27;s number has not been issued to any player since he was permanently disabled in a vehicle accident after the 1997 Stanley Cup Finals. Number 99 is also unavailable as it was retired by the league in honor of Wayne Gretzky.

<text>In the Platonic, Neopythagorean, Middle Platonic, and Neoplatonic schools of philosophy, the demiurge () (sometimes spelled as demiurg) is an artisan-like figure responsible for fashioning and maintaining the physical universe. Various sects of Gnostics adopted the term &quot;demiurge&quot;. Although a fashioner, the demiurge is not necessarily the same as the creator figure in the monotheistic sense, because the demiurge itself and the material from which the demiurge fashions the universe are both considered consequences of something else. Depending on the system, they may be considered either uncreated and eternal or the product of some other entity. Some of these systems are monotheistic while others are henotheistic or polytheistic.

The word &quot;demiurge&quot; is an English word derived from &quot;demiurgus&quot;, a Latinised form of the Greek or . It was originally a common noun meaning &quot;craftsman&quot; or &quot;artisan&quot;, but gradually came to mean &quot;producer&quot;, and eventually &quot;creator&quot;. The philosophical usage and the proper noun derive from Plato&#x27;s &quot;Timaeus&quot;, written  360 BC, where the demiurge is presented as the creator of the universe. The demiurge is also described as a creator in the Platonic ( 310–90 BC) and Middle Platonic ( 90 BC–AD 300) philosophical traditions. In the various branches of the Neoplatonic school (third century onwards), the demiurge is the fashioner of the real, perceptible world after the model of the Ideas, but (in most Neoplatonic systems) is still not itself &quot;the One&quot;. 

Within the vast spectrum of Gnostic traditions views of the Demiurge range dramatically. It is generally understood and agreed upon to be a lesser divinity who governs the material universe. However the nature of its rule over the material realm differs from sect to sect. Sethian Gnosticism portrays the Demiurge as an oppressive, ignorant ruler, intentionally binding souls in an inherently corrupt material realm. In contrast, Valentinian Gnosticism sees the Demiurge as a well-meaning but limited figure whose rule reflects ignorance rather than malice.

==Platonism and Neoplatonism==
===Plato and the &quot;Timaeus&quot;===
Plato, as the speaker Timaeus, refers to the Demiurge frequently in the Socratic dialogue &quot;Timaeus&quot; (28a ),  360 BC. The main character refers to the Demiurge as the entity who &quot;fashioned and shaped&quot; the material world. Timaeus describes the Demiurge as unreservedly benevolent, and so it desires a world as good as possible. The result of his work is a universe as a living god with lesser gods, such as the stars, planets, and gods of traditional religion, inside it. Plato argues that the cosmos needed a Demiurge because the cosmos needed a cause that makes Becoming resemble Being. &quot;Timaeus&quot; is a philosophical reconciliation of Hesiod&#x27;s cosmology in his &quot;Theogony&quot;, syncretically reconciling Hesiod to Homer, though other scholars have argued that Plato&#x27;s theology &#x27;invokes a broad cultural horizon without committing to any specific poetic or religious tradition&#x27;. Moreover, Plato believed that the Demiurge created other, so-called &quot;lower&quot; gods who, in turn, created humanity. Some scholars have argued that the lower gods are gods of traditional mythology, such as Zeus and Hera.

===Middle Platonism===
In Middle Platonist and Numenius&#x27;s Neo-Pythagorean cosmogonies, the Demiurge is second God as the &quot;nous&quot; or thought of intelligibles and sensibles (Middle Platonism and Neo-Pythagoreanism overlapped: both originating in the early 1st century BC and extending through to the end of the 2nd century AD or even into the 3rd century).

===Neoplatonism===
The work of Plotinus and other later Platonists in the 3rd century AD to further clarify the Demiurge is known as Neoplatonism. To Plotinus, the second emanation represents an uncreated second cause (see Pythagoras&#x27; Dyad). Plotinus sought to reconcile Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;energeia&quot; with Plato&#x27;s Demiurge, which, as Demiurge and mind (&quot;nous&quot;), is a critical component in the ontological construct of human consciousness used to explain and clarify substance theory within Platonic realism (also called idealism). In order to reconcile Aristotelian with Platonian philosophy, Plotinus metaphorically identified the demiurge (or &quot;nous&quot;) within the pantheon of the Greek Gods as Zeus.

====Henology====
The first and highest aspect of God is described by Plato as the One (Τὸ Ἕν, &#x27;To Hen&#x27;), the source, or the Monad. This is the God above the Demiurge, and manifests through the actions of the Demiurge. The Monad emanated the demiurge or &quot;Nous&quot; (consciousness) from its &quot;indeterminate&quot; vitality due to the monad being so abundant that it overflowed back onto itself, causing self-reflection. This self-reflection of the indeterminate vitality was referred to by Plotinus as the &quot;Demiurge&quot; or creator. The second principle is organization in its reflection of the nonsentient force or &quot;dynamis&quot;, also called the one or the Monad. The dyad is &quot;energeia&quot; emanated by the one that is then the work, process or activity called &quot;nous&quot;, Demiurge, mind, consciousness that organizes the indeterminate vitality into the experience called the material world, universe, cosmos. Plotinus also elucidates the equation of matter with nothing or non-being in &quot;The Enneads&quot; which more correctly is to express the concept of idealism or that there is not anything or anywhere outside of the &quot;mind&quot; or &quot;nous&quot; (c.f. pantheism).

Plotinus&#x27; form of Platonic idealism is to treat the Demiurge, &quot;nous&quot;, as the contemplative faculty (&quot;ergon&quot;) within man which orders the force (&quot;dynamis&quot;) into conscious reality. In this, he claimed to reveal Plato&#x27;s true meaning: a doctrine he learned from Platonic tradition that did not appear outside the academy or in Plato&#x27;s text. This tradition of creator God as &quot;nous&quot; (the manifestation of consciousness), can be validated in the works of pre-Plotinus philosophers such as Numenius, as well as a connection between Hebrew and Platonic cosmology (see also Philo).

The Demiurge of Neoplatonism is the &quot;Nous&quot; (mind of God), and is one of the three ordering principles:
* &quot;Arche&quot; (Gr. &#x27;beginning&#x27;) – the source of all things,
* &quot;Logos&quot; (Gr. &#x27;reason/cause&#x27;) – the underlying order that is hidden beneath appearances,
* &quot;Harmonia&quot; (Gr. &#x27;harmony&#x27;) – numerical ratios in mathematics.

Before Numenius of Apamea and Plotinus&#x27; &quot;Enneads&quot;, no Platonic works ontologically clarified the Demiurge from the allegory in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Timaeus&quot;. The idea of Demiurge was, however, addressed before Plotinus in the works of Christian writer Justin Martyr who built his understanding of the Demiurge on the works of Numenius.

====Iamblichus====

Later, the Neoplatonist Iamblichus changed the role of the &quot;One&quot;, effectively altering the role of the Demiurge as second cause or dyad, which was one of the reasons that Iamblichus and his teacher Porphyry came into conflict.

The figure of the Demiurge emerges in the theoretic of Iamblichus, which conjoins the transcendent, incommunicable “One,” or Source. Here, at the summit of this system, the Source and Demiurge (material realm) coexist via the process of &quot;henosis&quot;.
Iamblichus describes the One as a monad whose first principle or emanation is intellect (&quot;nous&quot;), while among &quot;the many&quot; that follow it there is a second, super-existent &quot;One&quot; that is the producer of intellect or soul (&quot;psyche&quot;).

The &quot;One&quot; is further separated into spheres of intelligence; the first and superior sphere is objects of thought, while the latter sphere is the domain of thought. Thus, a is formed of the intelligible &quot;nous&quot;, the intellective &quot;nous&quot;, and the &quot;psyche&quot; in order to reconcile further the various Hellenistic philosophical schools of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;actus&quot; and &quot;potentia&quot; (actuality and potentiality) of the unmoved mover and Plato&#x27;s Demiurge.

Then within this intellectual triad Iamblichus assigns the third rank to the Demiurge, identifying it with the perfect or Divine &quot;nous&quot; with the intellectual triad being promoted to a &quot;hebdomad&quot; (pure intellect).

In the theoretic of Plotinus, &quot;nous&quot; produces nature through intellectual mediation, thus the intellectualizing gods are followed by a triad of psychic gods.

==Gnosticism==

Gnosticism presents a distinction between the highest, unknowable God or Supreme Being and the demiurgic &quot;creator&quot; of the material, identified in some traditions with Yahweh, the God of the Hebrew Bible. Several systems of Gnostic thought present the Demiurge as antagonistic to the will of the Supreme Being, with his creation initially having the malevolent intention of entrapping aspects of the divine &quot;in&quot; materiality. In other systems, the Demiurge is instead portrayed as &quot;merely&quot; incompetent or foolish: his creation is an unconscious attempt to replicate the divine world (the pleroma) based on faint recollections, and thus ends up fundamentally flawed. Thus, in such systems, the Demiurge is a proposed solution to the problem of evil: while the divine beings are omniscient and omnibenevolent, the Demiurge who rules over our own physical world is not.

===Angels===
Psalm 82 begins, &quot;God stands in the assembly of El , in the midst of the gods he renders judgment&quot;, indicating a plurality of gods, although it does not indicate that these gods were co-actors in creation. Philo had inferred from the expression &quot;Let us make man&quot; of the Book of Genesis that God had used other beings as assistants in the creation of man, and he explains in this way why man is capable of vice as well as virtue, ascribing the origin of the latter to God, of the former to his helpers in the work of creation.

The earliest Gnostic sects ascribe the work of creation to angels, some of them using the same passage in Genesis. So Irenaeus tells of the system of Simon Magus, of the system of Menander, of the system of Saturninus, in which the number of these angels is reckoned as seven, and of the system of Carpocrates. In Basilides&#x27;s system, he reports, the world was made by the angels who occupy the lowest heaven; but special mention is made of their chief, who is said to have been the God of the Jews, to have led that people out of the land of Egypt, and to have given them their law. The prophecies are ascribed not to the chief but to the other world-making angels.

The Latin translation, confirmed by Hippolytus of Rome, makes Irenaeus state that according to Cerinthus (who shows Ebionite influence), creation was made by a power quite separate from the Supreme God and ignorant of him. Theodoret, who here copies Irenaeus, turns this into the plural number &quot;powers&quot;, and so Epiphanius of Salamis represents Cerinthus as agreeing with Carpocrates in the doctrine that the world was made by angels.

===Yaldabaoth===

In the Archontic, Sethian, and Ophite systems, which have many affinities with the doctrine of Valentinus, the making of the world is ascribed to a company of seven archons, whose names are given, but still more prominent is their chief, &quot;Yaldabaoth&quot; (also known as &quot;Yaltabaoth&quot; or &quot;Ialdabaoth&quot;).

In the &quot;Apocryphon of John&quot;  AD 120–180, the demiurge declares that he has made the world by himself:

Now the archon [&quot;ruler&quot;] who is weak has three names. The first name is Yaltabaoth, the second is Saklas [&quot;fool&quot;], and the third is Samael [&quot;blind god&quot;]. And he is impious in his arrogance which is in him. For he said, &#x27;I am God and there is no other God beside me,&#x27; for he is ignorant of his strength, the place from which he had come.

He is Demiurge and maker of man, but as a ray of light from above enters the body of man and gives him a soul, Yaldabaoth is filled with envy; he tries to limit man&#x27;s knowledge by forbidding him the fruit of knowledge in paradise. At the consummation of all things, all light will return to the Pleroma. But Yaldabaoth, the Demiurge, with the material world, will be cast into the lower depths.

Yaldabaoth is frequently called &quot;the Lion-faced&quot;, &quot;leontoeides&quot;, and is said to have the body of a serpent. The demiurge is also described as having a fiery nature, applying the words of Moses to him: &quot;the Lord our God is a burning and consuming fire&quot;. Hippolytus claims that Simon used a similar description.

In &quot;Pistis Sophia&quot;, Yaldabaoth has already sunk from his high estate and resides in Chaos, where, with his forty-nine demons, he tortures wicked souls in boiling rivers of pitch, and with other punishments (pp. 257, 382). He is an archon with the face of a lion, half flame, and half darkness.

In the Nag Hammadi text &quot;On the Origin of the World&quot;, the three sons of Yaldabaoth are listed as Yao, Eloai, and Astaphaios.

Under the name of &quot;Nebro&quot; (rebel), Yaldabaoth is called an angel in the apocryphal &quot;Gospel of Judas&quot;. He is first mentioned in &quot;The Cosmos, Chaos, and the Underworld&quot; as one of the twelve angels to come &quot;into being [to] rule over chaos and the [underworld]&quot;. He comes from heaven, and it is said his &quot;face flashed with fire and [his] appearance was defiled with blood&quot;. Nebro creates six angels in addition to the angel Saklas to be his assistants. These six, in turn, create another twelve angels &quot;with each one receiving a portion in the heavens&quot;.

====Names====

The etymology of the name &quot;Yaldabaoth&quot; has been subject to many speculative theories. Until 1974, etymologies deriving from the unattested Aramaic: בהותא, &quot;bāhūthā&quot;, supposedly meaning &quot;chaos&quot;, represented the majority view. Following an analysis by the Jewish historian of religion Gershom Scholem published in 1974, this etymology no longer enjoyed any notable support. His analysis showed the unattested Aramaic term to have been fabulated and attested only in a single corrupted text from 1859, with its claimed translation having been transposed from the reading of an earlier etymology, whose explanation seemingly equated &quot;darkness&quot; and &quot;chaos&quot; when translating an unattested supposed plural form of .

&quot;Samael&quot; literally means &quot;Blind God&quot; or &quot;God of the Blind&quot; in Hebrew (). This being is considered not only blind, or ignorant of its own origins, but may, in addition, be evil; its name is also found in Judaism as the Angel of Death and in Christian demonology. This link to Judeo-Christian tradition leads to a further comparison with Satan. Another alternative title for the demiurge is &quot;Saklas&quot;, Aramaic for &quot;fool&quot;. In the &quot;Apocryphon of John&quot;, Yaldabaoth is also known as both Sakla and Samael.

The angelic name &quot;Ariel&quot; (Hebrew: &#x27;the lion of God&#x27;) has also been used to refer to the Demiurge and is called his &quot;perfect&quot; name; in some Gnostic lore, Ariel has been called an ancient or original name for Ialdabaoth. The name has also been inscribed on amulets as &quot;Ariel Ialdabaoth&quot;, and the figure of the archon inscribed with &quot;Aariel&quot;.

===Marcion===
According to Marcion, the title God was given to the Demiurge, who was to be sharply distinguished from the higher Good God. The former was &quot;díkaios&quot;, severely just, the latter &quot;agathós&quot;, or loving-kind; the former was the &quot;god of this world&quot;, the God of the Old Testament, the latter the true God of the New Testament. Christ, in reality, is the Son of the Good God. The true believer in Christ entered into God&#x27;s kingdom; the unbeliever remained forever the slave of the Demiurge.

===Valentinus===
It is in the system of Valentinus that the name &quot;Dēmiurgos&quot; is used, which occurs nowhere in Irenaeus except in connection with the Valentinian system. When it is employed by other Gnostics either it is not used in a technical sense, or its use has been borrowed from Valentinus. But it is only the name that can be said to be specially Valentinian; the personage intended by it corresponds more or less closely with the Yaldabaoth of the Ophites, the great Archon of Basilides, the Elohim of Justinus, etc.

The Valentinian theory elaborates that from Achamoth (&quot;he kátō sophía&quot; or lower wisdom) three kinds of substance take their origin, the spiritual (&quot;pneumatikoí&quot;), the animal (&quot;psychikoí&quot;) and the material (&quot;hylikoí&quot;). The Demiurge belongs to the second kind, as he was the offspring of a union of Achamoth with matter. And as Achamoth herself was only the daughter of &quot;Sophía&quot; the last of the thirty Aeons, the Demiurge was distant by many emanations from the Propatôr, or Supreme God.

In creating this world out of Chaos the Demiurge was unconsciously influenced for good; and the universe, to the surprise even of its Maker, became almost perfect. The Demiurge regretted even its slight imperfection, and as he thought himself the Supreme God, he attempted to remedy this by sending a Messiah. To this Messiah, however, was actually united with Jesus the Saviour, Who redeemed men. These are either &quot;hylikoí&quot; or &quot;pneumatikoí&quot;.

The first, or material men, will return to the grossness of matter and finally be consumed by fire; the second, or animal men, together with the Demiurge, will enter a middle state, neither Pleroma nor &quot;hyle&quot;; the purely spiritual men will be completely freed from the influence of the Demiurge and together with the Saviour and Achamoth, his spouse, will enter the Pleroma divested of body (&quot;hyle&quot;) and soul (&quot;psyché&quot;). In this most common form of Gnosticism the Demiurge had an inferior though not intrinsically evil function in the universe as the head of the animal, or psychic world.

===The devil===
Opinions on the devil, and his relationship to the Demiurge, vary. The Ophites held that he and his demons constantly oppose and thwart the human race, as it was on their account the devil was cast down into this world. According to one variant of the Valentinian system, the Demiurge is also the maker, out of the appropriate substance, of an order of &quot;spiritual&quot; beings, the devil, the prince of this world, and his angels. But the devil, as being a &quot;spirit&quot; of wickedness, is able to recognise the higher spiritual world, of which his maker the Demiurge, who is only animal, has no real knowledge. The devil resides in this lower world, of which he is the prince, the Demiurge in the heavens; his mother Sophia in the middle region, above the heavens and below the Pleroma.

The Valentinian Heracleon interpreted the devil as the &quot;principle&quot; of evil, that of &quot;hyle&quot; (matter). As he writes in his commentary on John 4:21,
The mountain represents the Devil, or his world, since the Devil was one part of the whole of matter, but the world is the total mountain of evil, a deserted dwelling place of beasts, to which all who lived before the law and all Gentiles render worship. But Jerusalem represents the creation or the Creator whom the Jews worship. ... You then who are spiritual should worship neither the creation nor the Craftsman, but the Father of Truth. 

This vilification of the creator was held to be inimical to Christianity by the early fathers of the church. In refuting the beliefs of the gnostics, Irenaeus stated that &quot;Plato is proved to be more religious than these men, for he allowed that the same God was both just and good, having power over all things, and himself executing judgment.&quot;

===Cathars===
Catharism apparently inherited their idea of Satan as the creator of the evil world from Gnosticism. Gilles Quispel writes, &quot;There is a direct link between ancient Gnosticism and Catharism. The Cathars held that the creator of the world, Satanael, had usurped the name of God, but that he had subsequently been unmasked and told that he was not really God.&quot;

==Neoplatonism and Gnosticism==
Gnosticism attributed falsehood or evil to the concept of the Demiurge or creator, though in some Gnostic traditions the creator is from a fallen, ignorant, or lesser—rather than evil—perspective, such as that of Valentinius.

===Plotinus===
The Neoplatonic philosopher Plotinus addressed within his works Gnosticism&#x27;s conception of the Demiurge, which he saw as un-Hellenic and blasphemous to the Demiurge or creator of Plato. Plotinus, along with his teacher Ammonius Saccas, was the founder of Neoplatonism. In the ninth tractate of the second of his &quot;Enneads&quot;, Plotinus criticizes his opponents for their appropriation of ideas from Plato:

Of note here is the remark concerning the second hypostasis or Creator and third hypostasis or World Soul. Plotinus criticizes his opponents for &quot;all the novelties through which they seek to establish a philosophy of their own&quot; which, he declares, &quot;have been picked up outside of the truth&quot;; they attempt to conceal rather than admit their indebtedness to ancient philosophy, which they have corrupted by their extraneous and misguided embellishments. Thus their understanding of the Demiurge is similarly flawed in comparison to Plato&#x27;s original intentions.

Whereas Plato&#x27;s Demiurge is good wishing good on his creation, Gnosticism contends that the Demiurge is not only the originator of evil but is evil as well. Hence the title of Plotinus&#x27; refutation: &quot;Against Those That Affirm the Creator of the Kosmos and the Kosmos Itself to be Evil&quot; (generally quoted as &quot;Against the Gnostics&quot;). Plotinus argues of the disconnect or great barrier that is created between the &quot;nous&quot; or mind&#x27;s noumenon (see Heraclitus) and the material world (phenomenon) by believing the material world is evil.

The majority of scholars tend to understand Plotinus&#x27; opponents as being a Gnostic sect—certainly (specifically Sethian), several such groups were present in Alexandria and elsewhere about the Mediterranean during Plotinus&#x27; lifetime. Plotinus specifically points to the Gnostic doctrine of Sophia and her emission of the Demiurge.

Though the former understanding certainly enjoys the greatest popularity, the identification of Plotinus&#x27; opponents as Gnostic is not without some contention. Christos Evangeliou has contended that Plotinus&#x27; opponents might be better described as simply &quot;Christian Gnostics&quot;, arguing that several of Plotinus&#x27; criticisms are as applicable to orthodox Christian doctrine as well. Also, considering the evidence from the time, Evangeliou thought the definition of the term &quot;Gnostics&quot; was unclear. Of note here is that while Plotinus&#x27; student Porphyry names Christianity specifically in Porphyry&#x27;s own works, and Plotinus is to have been a known associate of the Christian Origen, none of Plotinus&#x27; works mention Christ or Christianity—whereas Plotinus specifically addresses his target in the &quot;Enneads&quot; as the Gnostics.

A. H. Armstrong identified the so-called &quot;Gnostics&quot; that Plotinus was attacking as Jewish and Pagan, in his introduction to the tract in his translation of the &quot;Enneads&quot;. Armstrong alluding to Gnosticism being a Hellenic philosophical heresy of sorts, which later engaged Christianity and Neoplatonism.

John D. Turner, professor of religious studies at the University of Nebraska, and famed translator and editor of the Nag Hammadi library, stated that the text Plotinus and his students read was Sethian Gnosticism, which predates Christianity. It appears that Plotinus attempted to clarify how the philosophers of the academy had not arrived at the same conclusions (such as dystheism or misotheism for the creator God as an answer to the problem of evil) as the targets of his criticism.

Emil Cioran also wrote his &quot;Le mauvais démiurge&quot; (&quot;The Evil Demiurge&quot;), published in 1969, influenced by Gnosticism and Schopenhauerian interpretation of Platonic ontology, as well as that of Plotinus.

<text>Doubravka of Bohemia, Dobrawa (, ; ca. 940/45 – 977) was a Bohemian princess of the Přemyslid dynasty and by marriage Duchess of the Polans.

She was the daughter of Boleslaus I the Cruel, Duke of Bohemia, whose wife may have been the mysterious Biagota.

According to earlier sources, Doubravka urged her husband Mieszko I of Poland to accept baptism in 966, the year after their marriage. Modern historians believe, however, that the change of religion by Mieszko was one of the points discussed in the Polish-Bohemian agreement concluded soon before his marriage with Doubravka. Her role in his conversion is not considered now to be as important as it is often represented in medieval chronicles.

==Early life==

Doubravka&#x27;s date of birth is not known. The only indication is communicated by the chronicler Cosmas of Prague, who stated that the Bohemian princess at the time of her marriage with Mieszko I was &quot;an old woman&quot;. The passage is regarded as tendentious and of little reliability, and some researchers believe that the statement was made with malicious intent. It is possible that in the statement about Doubravka&#x27;s age, Cosmas was making a reference to the age difference between her and her sister Mlada. That would give him a basis for determining Doubravka as &quot;old.&quot; (The word &quot;Mlada&quot; means &quot;Young&quot;). It also found that Cosmas confuses Doubravka with Mieszko I&#x27;s second wife Oda, who at the time of her marriage was around 19–25 years old, a relatively advanced age for a bride according to the customs of the Middle Ages. Some researchers have taken up speculative views, such as Jerzy Strzelczyk, who assumed that &quot;in the light of contemporary concepts and habits of marriage of that time (when as a rule marriages were contracted with teenage girls) is assumed that Doubravka had passed her early youth, so, it&#x27;s probable that she was in her late teens or twenties&quot;.

Nothing is known about Doubravka&#x27;s childhood and youth. In 1895 Oswald Balzer refuted reports that previous to her marriage with Mieszko I, Doubravka was married to Gunther, Margrave of Merseburg and they had a son, Gunzelin. This view is based on the fact that Thietmar of Merseburg in his chronicles named Gunzelin, Gunther&#x27;s son, &quot;brother&quot; of Bolesław I the Brave, Doubravka&#x27;s son. Currently, historians believed that Gunzelin and Bolesław I are in fact cousins or brothers-in-law.

==Marriage and Christianization of Poland==
In the second half of 964 an alliance between Boleslav I the Cruel, Duke of Bohemia, and Mieszko I of Poland was concluded. In order to consolidate the agreement, in 965 Boleslav I&#x27;s daughter Doubravka was married to Mieszko I. The marriage cemented the Polish-Bohemian alliance, which continued even after Doubravka&#x27;s death.

Two independent sources attribute to Doubravka an important role in the conversion to Christianity of Mieszko I and Poland. The first is the chronicles of Thietmar, who was born two years before the death of Doubravka. He wrote that the Bohemian princess tried to persuade her husband to accept Christianity (even at the cost of breaking their marriage and with it the Polish-Bohemian alliance). In the end, she finally obtained the conversion of Mieszko I and with him, of all Poland. In turn, the 12th-century chronicler Gallus Anonymus says that Doubravka came to Poland surrounded by secular and religious dignitaries. She agreed to marry Mieszko I providing that he was baptized. The Polish ruler accepted, and only then was able to marry the Bohemian princess.

Modern historians agree that the baptism of Mieszko I was dictated by political benefits and should not be attributed to any action of Doubravka. She is held to have had virtually no role in the conversion of her husband. Historians note that the narrative of the conversion of Mieszko I thanks to Doubravka formed part of the tradition of the Church which stressed the conversion of Pagan rulers through the influence of women.

Doubravka did have a significant role in the Christianization of the Poles. In her wedding procession, she arrived in Poland with Christian clergymen, among them possibly Jordan, ordained the first bishop of Poland in 968. Tradition attributes to Doubravka the establishment of the Holy Trinity and St. Wit Churches in Gniezno and the Church of the Virgin Mary in Ostrów Tumski, Poznań.

==Children==
Doubravka and Mieszko I had at least one son, Bolesław the Brave (b. 967 – d. 17 June 1025). A daughter, called Świętosława or Sigrid the Haughty, married first King Eric the Victorious of Sweden and later King Sweyn Forkbeard of Denmark, by whom she was the mother of Canute the Great. Gunhilda of Poland, who married Swyen Forkbeard, is usually identified as this daughter. There is a hypothesis asserting the existence of another daughter of Mieszko I who was married to a Pomeranian Slavic prince. She could have been the daughter of either Doubravka or one of Mieszko&#x27;s previous pagan wives. Also, a theory has been advanced (apparently recorded by Thietmar of Prague and supported by Oswald Balzer in 1895) that Vladivoj (c. 981 – January 1003), who ruled as duke of Bohemia from 1002 until 1003, was another son of Doubravka and Mieszko I. Czech historiography has supported the notion of mixed Piast-Přemyslid parentage for Vladivoj.

==Death and burial==
Doubravka died in 977. In his study of 1888, Józef Ignacy Kraszewski wrote that &quot;her tomb was discovered in Gniezno Cathedral. It was a simple stone marked with a cross. Purple robes and a weighty gold loincloth were the only objects found in her tomb.&quot; A similar view of Doubravka&#x27;s burial place was expressed earlier, in 1843, by Edward Raczyński in his study &quot;Wspomnienia Wielkopolski to jest województw poznańskiego, kaliskiego i gnieźnieńskiego&quot; (Memories of the Greater Poland districts of Poznań, Kalisz and Gniezno). However, the burial place of the Bohemian princess is now considered to be unknown.

Doubravka&#x27;s death weakened the Polish-Bohemian alliance, which finally collapsed in the mid-980s.
