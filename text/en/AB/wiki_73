<text>In computational geometry, a Delaunay triangulation or Delone triangulation of a set of points in the plane subdivides their convex hull into triangles whose circumcircles do not contain any of the points. This maximizes the size of the smallest angle in any of the triangles, and tends to avoid sliver triangles.

The triangulation is named after Boris Delaunay for his work on it from 1934.

If the points all lie on a straight line, the notion of triangulation becomes degenerate and there is no Delaunay triangulation. For four or more points on the same circle (e.g., the vertices of a rectangle) the Delaunay triangulation is not unique: each of the two possible triangulations that split the quadrangle into two triangles satisfies the &quot;Delaunay condition&quot;, i.e., the requirement that the circumcircles of all triangles have empty interiors.

By considering circumscribed spheres, the notion of Delaunay triangulation extends to three and higher dimensions. Generalizations are possible to metrics other than Euclidean distance. However, in these cases a Delaunay triangulation is not guaranteed to exist or be unique.

==Relationship with the Voronoi diagram==

The Delaunay triangulation of a discrete point set in general position corresponds to the dual graph of the Voronoi diagram for .
The circumcenters of Delaunay triangles are the vertices of the Voronoi diagram.
In the 2D case, the Voronoi vertices are connected via edges, that can be derived from adjacency-relationships of the Delaunay triangles: If two triangles share an edge in the Delaunay triangulation, their circumcenters are to be connected with an edge in the Voronoi tesselation.

Special cases where this relationship does not hold, or is ambiguous, include cases like:
* Three or more collinear points, where the circumcircles are of infinite radii.
* Four or more points on a perfect circle, where the triangulation is ambiguous and all circumcenters are trivially identical. In this case the Voronoi diagram contains vertices of degree four or greater and its dual graph contains polygonal faces with four or more sides. The various triangulations of these faces complete the various possible Delaunay triangulations.
*Edges of the Voronoi diagram going to infinity are not defined by this relation in case of a finite set . If the Delaunay triangulation is calculated using the Bowyer–Watson algorithm then the circumcenters of triangles having a common vertex with the &quot;super&quot; triangle should be ignored. Edges going to infinity start from a circumcenter and they are perpendicular to the common edge between the kept and ignored triangle.

== &quot;d&quot;-dimensional Delaunay ==
For a set of points in the (-dimensional) Euclidean space, a Delaunay triangulation is a triangulation such that no point in is inside the circum-hypersphere of any -simplex in . It is known that there exists a unique Delaunay triangulation for if is a set of points in &quot;general position&quot;; that is, the affine hull of is -dimensional and no set of points in lie on the boundary of a ball whose interior does not intersect .

The problem of finding the Delaunay triangulation of a set of points in -dimensional Euclidean space can be converted to the problem of finding the convex hull of a set of points in ()-dimensional space. This may be done by giving each point an extra coordinate equal to , thus turning it into a hyper-paraboloid (this is termed &quot;lifting&quot;); taking the bottom side of the convex hull (as the top end-cap faces upwards away from the origin, and must be discarded); and mapping back to -dimensional space by deleting the last coordinate. As the convex hull is unique, so is the triangulation, assuming all facets of the convex hull are simplices. Nonsimplicial facets only occur when of the original points lie on the same -hypersphere, i.e., the points are not in general position.

==Properties==

Let be the number of points and the number of dimensions.

* The union of all simplices in the triangulation is the convex hull of the points.
* The Delaunay triangulation contains simplices.
* In the plane (), if there are vertices on the convex hull, then any triangulation of the points has at most triangles, plus one exterior face (see Euler characteristic).
* If points are distributed according to a Poisson process in the plane with constant intensity, then each vertex has on average six surrounding triangles. More generally for the same process in dimensions the average number of neighbors is a constant depending only on .
* In the plane, the Delaunay triangulation maximizes the minimum angle. Compared to any other triangulation of the points, the smallest angle in the Delaunay triangulation is at least as large as the smallest angle in any other. However, the Delaunay triangulation does not necessarily minimize the maximum angle. The Delaunay triangulation also does not necessarily minimize the length of the edges. 
* A circle circumscribing any Delaunay triangle does not contain any other input points in its interior.
* If a circle passing through two of the input points doesn&#x27;t contain any other input points in its interior, then the segment connecting the two points is an edge of a Delaunay triangulation of the given points.
* Each triangle of the Delaunay triangulation of a set of points in -dimensional spaces corresponds to a facet of convex hull of the projection of the points onto a ()-dimensional paraboloid, and vice versa.
* The closest neighbor to any point is on an edge in the Delaunay triangulation since the nearest neighbor graph is a subgraph of the Delaunay triangulation.
* The Delaunay triangulation is a geometric spanner: In the plane (), the shortest path between two vertices, along Delaunay edges, is known to be no longer than 1.998 times the Euclidean distance between them.

== Visual Delaunay definition: Flipping ==
From the above properties an important feature arises: Looking at two triangles with the common edge (see figures), if the sum of the angles , the triangles meet the Delaunay condition.

This is an important property because it allows the use of a &quot;flipping&quot; technique. If two triangles do not meet the Delaunay condition, switching the common edge for the common edge produces two triangles that do meet the Delaunay condition:

This operation is called a &quot;flip&quot;, and can be generalised to three and higher dimensions.

==Algorithms==

Many algorithms for computing Delaunay triangulations rely on fast operations for detecting when a point is within a triangle&#x27;s circumcircle and an efficient data structure for storing triangles and edges. In two dimensions, one way to detect if point lies in the circumcircle of is to evaluate the determinant:

: formula_1

When are sorted in a counterclockwise order, this determinant is positive only if lies inside the circumcircle.

===Flip algorithms===
As mentioned above, if a triangle is non-Delaunay, we can flip one of its edges. This leads to a straightforward algorithm: construct any triangulation of the points, and then flip edges until no triangle is non-Delaunay. Unfortunately, this can take edge flips. While this algorithm can be generalised to three and higher dimensions, its convergence is not guaranteed in these cases, as it is conditioned to the connectedness of the underlying flip graph: this graph is connected for two-dimensional sets of points, but may be disconnected in higher dimensions.

===Incremental===
The most straightforward way of efficiently computing the Delaunay triangulation is to repeatedly add one vertex at a time, retriangulating the affected parts of the graph. When a vertex is added, we split in three the triangle that contains , then we apply the flip algorithm. Done naïvely, this will take time: we search through all the triangles to find the one that contains , then we potentially flip away every triangle. Then the overall runtime is .

If we insert vertices in random order, it turns out (by a somewhat intricate proof) that each insertion will flip, on average, only triangles – although sometimes it will flip many more. This still leaves the point location time to improve. We can store the history of the splits and flips performed: each triangle stores a pointer to the two or three triangles that replaced it. To find the triangle that contains , we start at a root triangle, and follow the pointer that points to a triangle that contains , until we find a triangle that has not yet been replaced. On average, this will also take time. Over all vertices, then, this takes time. While the technique extends to higher dimension (as proved by Edelsbrunner and Shah), the runtime can be exponential in the dimension even if the final Delaunay triangulation is small.

The Bowyer–Watson algorithm provides another approach for incremental construction. It gives an alternative to edge flipping for computing the Delaunay triangles containing a newly inserted vertex.

Unfortunately the flipping-based algorithms are generally hard to parallelize, since adding some certain point (e.g. the center point of a wagon wheel) can lead to up to consecutive flips. Blelloch et al. proposed another version of incremental algorithm based on rip-and-tent, which is practical and highly parallelized with polylogarithmic span.

===Divide and conquer===
A divide and conquer algorithm for triangulations in two dimensions was developed by Lee and Schachter and improved by Guibas and Stolfi and later by Dwyer. In this algorithm, one recursively draws a line to split the vertices into two sets. The Delaunay triangulation is computed for each set, and then the two sets are merged along the splitting line. Using some clever tricks, the merge operation can be done in time , so the total running time is .

For certain types of point sets, such as a uniform random distribution, by intelligently picking the splitting lines the expected time can be reduced to while still maintaining worst-case performance.

A divide and conquer paradigm to performing a triangulation in dimensions is presented in &quot;DeWall: A fast divide and conquer Delaunay triangulation algorithm in E&quot;d&quot;&quot; by P. Cignoni, C. Montani, R. Scopigno.

The divide and conquer algorithm has been shown to be the fastest DT generation technique sequentially.

===Sweephull===

Sweephull is a hybrid technique for 2D Delaunay triangulation that uses a radially propagating sweep-hull, and a flipping algorithm. The sweep-hull is created sequentially by iterating a radially-sorted set of 2D points, and connecting triangles to the visible part of the convex hull, which gives a non-overlapping triangulation. One can build a convex hull in this manner so long as the order of points guarantees no point would fall within the triangle. But, radially sorting should minimize flipping by being highly Delaunay to start. This is then paired with a final iterative triangle flipping step.

== Applications ==
The Euclidean minimum spanning tree of a set of points is a subset of the Delaunay triangulation of the same points, and this can be exploited to compute it efficiently.

For modelling terrain or other objects given a point cloud, the Delaunay triangulation gives a nice set of triangles to use as polygons in the model. In particular, the Delaunay triangulation avoids narrow triangles (as they have large circumcircles compared to their area). See triangulated irregular network.

Delaunay triangulations can be used to determine the density or intensity of points samplings by means of the Delaunay tessellation field estimator (DTFE).
Delaunay triangulations are often used to generate meshes for space-discretised solvers such as the finite element method and the finite volume method of physics simulation, because of the angle guarantee and because fast triangulation algorithms have been developed. Typically, the domain to be meshed is specified as a coarse simplicial complex; for the mesh to be numerically stable, it must be refined, for instance by using Ruppert&#x27;s algorithm.

The increasing popularity of finite element method and boundary element method techniques increases the incentive to improve automatic meshing algorithms. However, all of these algorithms can create distorted and even unusable grid elements. Fortunately, several techniques exist which can take an existing mesh and improve its quality. For example, smoothing (also referred to as mesh refinement) is one such method, which repositions nodes to minimize element distortion. The stretched grid method allows the generation of pseudo-regular meshes that meet the Delaunay criteria easily and quickly in a one-step solution. 

Constrained Delaunay triangulation has found applications in path planning in automated driving and topographic surveying.

<text>In court proceedings, a defendant is a person or object who is the party either accused of committing a crime in criminal prosecution or against whom some type of civil relief is being sought in a civil case.

Terminology varies from one jurisdiction to another. In Scots law, the terms &quot;accused&quot; or &quot;panel&quot; are used instead in criminal proceedings and &quot;defender&quot; in civil proceedings. Another term in use is &quot;respondent&quot;.

==Criminal defendants==
In a criminal trial, a defendant is a person accused (charged) of committing an offense (a crime; an act defined as punishable under criminal law). The other party to a criminal trial is usually a public prosecutor, but in some jurisdictions, private prosecutions are allowed.

Criminal defendants are often taken into custody by police and brought before a court under an arrest warrant. Criminal defendants are usually obliged to post bail before being released from custody. For serious cases, such as murder, bail may be refused. Defendants must be present at every stage of the proceedings against them. (There is an exception for very minor cases such as traffic offenses in jurisdictions which treat them as crimes.)

If more than one person is accused, the people may be referred as &quot;co-defendant&quot; or &quot;co-conspirator&quot; in British and common law courts.

In some jurisdictions, vulnerable defendants may be able to get access of services of a non-registered intermediary to assist with communication at court.

==Civil defendants==
In a civil lawsuit, a defendant (or a respondent) is also the accused party, although not of an offense, but of a civil wrong (a tort or a breach of contract, for instance). The person who starts the civil action through filing a complaint is referred to as the plaintiff (also known as the appellant).

Defendants in civil actions usually make their first court appearance voluntarily in response to a summons. Historically, civil defendants could be taken into custody under a writ of &quot;capias ad respondendum&quot;. Modern-day civil defendants are usually able to avoid most (if not all) court appearances if represented by a lawyer.

Most often and familiarly, defendants are persons: either natural persons (actual human beings) or juridical persons (&quot;persona fiction&quot;) under the legal fiction of treating organizations as persons. But a defendant may be an object, in which case the object itself is the direct subject of the action. When a court has jurisdiction over an object, it is said to have jurisdiction &quot;in rem&quot;. An example of an &quot;in rem&quot; case is &quot;United States v. Forty Barrels and Twenty Kegs of Coca-Cola&quot; (1916), where the defendant was not the Coca-Cola Company itself, but rather &quot;Forty Barrels and Twenty Kegs of Coca-Cola&quot;. In current United States legal practice, &quot;in rem&quot; suits are primarily asset forfeiture cases, based on drug laws, as in &quot;USA v. $124,700&quot; (2006).

Defendants can set up an account to pay for litigation costs and legal expenses. These legal defense funds can have large membership counts where members contribute to the fund. The fund can be public or private and is set up for individuals, organizations, or a particular purpose. These funds are often used by public officials, civil-rights organizations, and public-interest organizations.

==England and Wales==
Historically, &quot;defendant&quot; was a legal term for a person prosecuted for misdemeanour. It was not applicable to a person prosecuted for felony.

<text>Gnaeus Domitius Afer (died 59) was a Roman orator and advocate, born at Nemausus (Nîmes) in Gallia Narbonensis. He flourished in the reigns of Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius and Nero. He was suffect consul in the &quot;nundinium&quot; of September to December 39 as the colleague of Aulus Didius Gallus.

==Life==
Afer became praetor in 25 AD, and gained the favor of Tiberius by accusing Claudia Pulchra, the second cousin of Agrippina, of adultery and the use of magic arts against the emperor, in 26 AD. From this time he became one of the most celebrated orators in Rome, but sacrificed his character by conducting accusations for the government. In the following year, 27 AD, he is again mentioned by Tacitus as the accuser of Quinctilius Varus, the son of Claudia Pulchra. In consequence of the accusation of Claudia Pulchra, and of some offense which he had given to Caligula, he was accused by the emperor in the senate, but by concealing his own skill in speaking, and pretending to be overpowered by the eloquence of Caligula, Afer not only escaped the danger, but was made consul suffectus in 39 AD.

In his old age Afer lost much of his reputation by continuing to speak in public, when his powers were exhausted. During the reign of Nero he became &quot;curator aquarum&quot;, or superintendent of the city&#x27;s water supply, but died not long afterwards, in 59 AD, having eaten himself to death, according to Jerome in the Chronicon of Eusebius.

Quintilian, when a young man, heard Afer, and frequently speaks of him as the most distinguished orator of his age. He says that Afer and Julius Africanus were the best orators he had heard, and that he prefers the former to the latter, Quintilian refers to a work of his &quot;On Testimony&quot;, to one entitled &quot;Dicta&quot;, and to some of his orations, of which those on behalf of Domitilla, or Cloantilla, and Lucius Volusenus Catulus seem to have been the most celebrated.

According to Pliny the Younger, in his will Afer had made Titius Marcellus Curvius Lucanus and Titius Marcellus Curvius Tullus his heirs on the condition that they take on his name. He had prosecuted their father, Sextus Curvius Tullus, stripping him of his wealth and citizenship. Pliny comments that Afer&#x27;s will had been drawn up 18 years previously, suggesting that Afer and Tullus the elder had once been friends.

<doc id="8875" wikidata="Q297538" url="?curid=8875" title="Dan Simmons">
<text>Dan Simmons (born April 4, 1948) is an American science fiction and horror writer. He is the author of the Hyperion Cantos and the Ilium/Olympos cycles, among other works that span the science fiction, horror, and fantasy genres, sometimes within a single novel. Simmons&#x27;s genre-intermingling&quot; Song of Kali&quot; (1985) won the World Fantasy Award. He also writes mysteries and thrillers, some of which feature the continuing character Joe Kurtz.

==Biography==
Born in Peoria, Illinois, Simmons started writing stories as a child with the goal of mesmerizing his audience with his story telling. Simmons received a B.A. in English from Wabash College in 1970 and, in 1971, a Masters in Education from Washington University in St. Louis. 

He soon started writing short stories, although his career did not take off until 1982, when, through Harlan Ellison&#x27;s help, Simmons was invited to the Milford workshop, which Ellison considered to be &quot;the best SF writing workshop in the world&quot;. Simmons considered Ellison as a mentor, friend, and the reason he pursued writing full-time. Simmons&#x27; short story &quot;The River Styx Runs Upstream&quot; was published and awarded first prize in a &quot;Twilight Zone Magazine&quot; story competition, and he was taken on as a client by Ellison&#x27;s agent, Richard Curtis. Simmons&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Song of Kali&quot;, was released in 1985. 

He worked in elementary education until 1989.

He lives in Longmont, Colorado .

==Horror fiction==
&quot;Summer of Night&quot; (1991) recounts the childhood of a group of pre-teens who band together in the 1960s, to defeat a centuries-old evil that terrorizes their hometown of Elm Haven, Illinois. The novel, which was praised by Stephen King in a cover blurb, is similar to King&#x27;s &quot;It&quot; (1986) in its focus on small-town life, the corruption of innocence, the return of an ancient evil, and the responsibility for others that emerges with the transition from youth to adulthood.

In the sequel to &quot;Summer of Night&quot;, &quot;A Winter Haunting&quot; (2002), Dale Stewart (one of the first book&#x27;s protagonists and now an adult), revisits his boyhood home to come to grips with mysteries that have disrupted his adult life.

Between the publication of &quot;Summer of Night&quot; (1991) and &quot;A Winter Haunting&quot; (2002), several additional characters from &quot;Summer of Night&quot; appeared in: &quot;Children of the Night&quot; (1992), a loose sequel to &quot;Summer of Night&quot;, which features Mike O&#x27;Rourke, now much older and a Roman Catholic priest, who is sent on a mission to investigate bizarre events in a European city; &quot;Fires of Eden&quot; (1994), in which the adult Cordie Cooke appears; and &quot;Darwin&#x27;s Blade&quot; (2000), a thriller in which Dale&#x27;s younger brother, Lawrence Stewart, appears as a minor character.

After &quot;Summer of Night&quot;, Simmons focused on writing science fiction until the 2007 work of historical fiction and horror, &quot;The Terror&quot;. His 2009 book &quot;Drood&quot; is based on the last years of Charles Dickens&#x27; life leading up to the writing of &quot;The Mystery of Edwin Drood&quot;, which Dickens had partially completed at the time of his death.

==Historical fiction==
&quot;The Terror&quot; (2007) crosses the bridge between horror and historical fiction. It is a fictionalized account of Sir John Franklin and his expedition to find the Northwest Passage. The two ships, and , become icebound the first winter, and the captains and crew struggle to survive while being stalked across an Arctic landscape by a monster. The novel was adapted into a ten-part television series.

&quot;The Abominable&quot; (2013) recounts a mid-1920s attempt on Mount Everest by five climbers—two British, one French, one Sherpa, and one American (the narrator)—to recover the body of a cousin of one the British characters.

==Literary references==
Many of Simmons&#x27;s works have strong ties with classic literature. For example:
* His 1989 novel &quot;Hyperion&quot;, winner of Hugo and Locus Awards for the best science fiction novel, deals with a space war and is inspired in its structure by Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;Decameron&quot; and Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;.
* The &quot;Hyperion Cantos&quot; take their titles from poems by the British Romantic John Keats.
* The title of &quot;Carrion Comfort&quot;, as well as many of its themes, derives from the poem &quot;Carrion Comfort&quot; by Gerard Manley Hopkins.
* &quot;The Hollow Man&quot; (1992) is a novel influenced by Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot; and T. S. Eliot
* &quot;The Great Lover&quot; (1993) is a short story inspired by the World War I War Poets
* Simmons&#x27;s collection of short stories, &quot;Worlds Enough &amp; Time&quot;, takes its name from the first line of the poem &quot;To His Coy Mistress&quot; by English poet Andrew Marvell: &quot;Had we but world enough, and time&quot;
* The detective in &quot;Flashback&quot; is named Nick Bottom after a character in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;

<text>Denis-Auguste Affre (; 27 September 179327 June 1848) was a French clergyman who served as Archbishop of Paris from 1840 to 1848. He was killed while trying to negotiate peace during the June Days uprising of 1848.

His cause for beatification has commenced and he is therefore titled a Servant of God.

==Life==

===Early life and career===
Affre was born at Saint-Rome-de-Tarn, in the department of Aveyron. At the age of 14, he began to study for the priesthood at the Seminary of Saint-Sulpice, Paris, which was under the direction of his uncle, the Abbé Denis Boyer, S.S. He was an excellent student, and, while still a seminarian, soon became an instructor of dogmatic theology at the seminary in Nantes.

In 1818, he was ordained as a Catholic priest. From 1823 to 1833 he served as the Vicar General, first of the Diocese of Luçon and then of Amiens. In 1839, he was appointed as coadjutor bishop of the Diocese of Strasbourg. This post, however, he never filled, being called on to act as Vicar-Capitular of Paris, conjointly with MM. Auger and Morel, at the death of Archbishop Quélen.

Affre was elevated to the post of Archbishop of Paris in 1840. Though opposed to the government of King Louis-Philippe I, he fully accepted the establishment of the French Second Republic in 1848; nevertheless he took no part in politics, but devoted himself to pastoral care. He opened new parishes in the working-class neighborhoods of the city. Among them were Ménilmontant, Plaisance, Petit-Montrouge, Maison-Blanche, Petit-Gentilly, Notre-Dame de la Gare, Billancourt, Gros-Caillou.

Affre was passionate in his determination to improve the study of theology in order to form clergy needed in the challenges which the Catholic Church faced at the time. He also was insistent on education as a human right. He opened a new seminary in Paris, called the St. Joseph of the Carmelites Seminary, on the site of a former Carmelite priory, and a school of theology at the Sorbonne.

===Death===
Affre&#x27;s episcopate is chiefly remembered for its tragic close during the insurrection of June 1848.

On 23 June 1848, faced with starvation due to plans by the French government to close the National Workshops it had recently created in order to provide work to the poor, a large segment of the citizenry began rioting, setting up barricades in the streets of Paris. The crisis led to the government&#x27;s handing dictatorial powers over the nation to General Louis Eugène Cavaignac, who was determined to use all force necessary to crush the rebellion and ordered the French National Guard into Paris. Seeing the carnage caused among the civilian population by this campaign, Frederic Ozanam, the founder of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, begged Affre to intervene to stop the bloodshed. The archbishop was led to believe that by his personal involvement peace might be restored between the military and the insurgents.

Accordingly, on 25 June, in spite of the warning of Cavaignac, Affre mounted the barricade at the entrance to the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, bearing a green branch as sign of peace, to address both sides. He had spoken only a few words when an exchange of fire began in which he was struck by a stray bullet. There have been conflicting claims as to whether the fatal bullet was fired by an insurgent or by the government forces. He was taken to his palace, where he died on 27 June.

On the next day, the National Assembly of France issued a decree expressing its great sorrow over Affre&#x27;s death, and the public funeral held on 7 July was one of the most striking public spectacles of the period. The crowd following his cortege was estimated to have numbered about 200,000 people.

Affre was buried in the Chapel of Saint-Denis in the Cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris. His heart was removed and preserved in the chapel of the Carmelite Seminary, which he had founded.

== Legacy ==

The pectoral cross which he was wearing when he was shot—seen in his portrait—is preserved by the Archdiocese of Paris as a relic.

In 1856, the smallest of the four &quot;Benjamines,&quot; four new bells made for Notre-Dame, was named Denise David in honor of Affre and Amédée-David de Pastoret. Affre&#x27;s niece by marriage, Marie Caroline Affre, served as godmother to the bell during the baptism ceremony.

A street in the 18th arrondissement of Paris is named in his honor.

==Writings==
Affre wrote several articles for a newspaper called &quot;La France chrétienne&quot;. Additionally he published two books to guide in the practical matters of handling Church property: &quot; Un Traité de l&#x27;administration temporelle des paroisses&quot; (Paris, 1827) and &quot;Un Traité de la propriété des biens ecclésiastiques&quot; (Paris, 1837). He also wrote a guide to studying the Christian faith, &quot;Une Introduction philosophique à l&#x27;étude du christianisme&quot; (Paris, 5th edition, 1846).

<text>Denis Colin Leary (born August 18, 1957) is an American stand-up comedian and actor. Born in Massachusetts, Leary first came to prominence as a stand-up comedian, especially through appearances on MTV (including the comedic song &quot;Asshole&quot;) and through the stand-up specials &quot;No Cure for Cancer&quot; (1993) and &quot;Lock &#x27;n Load&quot; (1997). Leary began taking roles in film and television starting in the 1990s, including substantial roles in the films &quot;Judgment Night&quot; (1993), &quot;Gunmen&quot; (1994), &quot;Operation Dumbo Drop&quot; (1995) and &quot;Wag the Dog&quot; (1997).

In the 2000s, he developed and starred in the television show &quot;The Job&quot; (2001–2002) and was the star and co-creator of &quot;Rescue Me&quot; (2004–2011), for which he received three Primetime Emmy nominations, one for writing and two for acting. He has continued to take starring roles in films, including Captain George Stacy in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; and Cleveland Browns head coach Vince Penn in &quot;Draft Day&quot;. Leary has done voice work, including Francis in &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; and Diego in the &quot;Ice Age&quot; franchise.

From 2015 to 2016, Leary wrote and starred in the comedy series &quot;Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll&quot; on FX.

==Early life==
Denis Colin Leary was born on August 18, 1957, in Worcester, Massachusetts, the son of Catholic immigrant parents from Killarney, County Kerry, Ireland. His mother, Nora (née Sullivan; b. 1929), was a maid, and his father, John Leary (1924–1985), was an auto mechanic. Leary is a citizen of both the United States and Ireland. Leary is a third cousin of talk show host and fellow comedian Conan O&#x27;Brien.

Leary attended Saint Peter&#x27;s High School (now Saint Paul&#x27;s) in Worcester and graduated from Emerson College in Boston. At Emerson, he befriended fellow comic Mario Cantone. While a student, Leary founded the Emerson Comedy Workshop, a troupe that continues on the campus today.

After graduating from Emerson in 1981, Leary taught comedy-writing classes at the school for five years. In May 2005 he received an honorary doctorate and spoke at his alma mater&#x27;s undergraduate commencement ceremony; and is credited as Dr. Denis Leary on the cover of his 2009 book &quot;Why We Suck&quot;.

==Career==
Leary began working as a comedian at the Boston underground club Play It Again Sam&#x27;s. His first real gig was at the Rascals Comedy Club as part of the TV show &quot;The Rascals Comedy Hour&quot;, on October 18, 1990. He wrote and appeared on a local comedy series, &quot;Lenny Clarke&#x27;s Late Show&quot;, hosted by his friend Lenny Clarke and written by Martin Olson. Leary and Clarke both spoke about their early affiliations and influences in the Boston comedy scene in the documentary film &quot;When Standup Stood Out&quot; (2006). During Leary&#x27;s time as a Boston-area stand-up comic, he developed his stage persona.

Leary appeared in sketches on the MTV game show &quot;Remote Control&quot;, playing characters such as Keith Richards, co-host Colin Quinn&#x27;s brother and artist Andy Warhol. He earned fame when he ranted about R.E.M. in an early 1990s MTV sketch. Several other commercials for MTV quickly followed, in which Leary would rant at high speeds about a variety of topics, playing off the then-popular and growing alternative scene. One of these rants served as an introduction to the video for &quot;Shamrocks and Shenanigans (Boom Shalock Lock Boom)&quot; by House of Pain. Leary released two records of his comedy: &quot;No Cure for Cancer&quot; (1993) and &quot;Lock &#x27;n Load&quot; (1997). In late 2004, he released the EP &quot;Merry F %$in&#x27; Christmas&quot;, which included a mix of new music, previously unreleased recordings and some tracks from &quot;Lock &#x27;n Load&quot;. 

In 1993, Leary&#x27;s sardonic song &quot;Asshole&quot;, about the stereotypical American male, achieved much notoriety. The song was voted No. 1 in an Australian radio poll and was used in Holsten Pils ads in the UK, with Leary&#x27;s participation, and with adapted lyrics criticizing a drunk driver. The single was a minor hit there, peaking at No. 58 in the UK Singles Chart in January 1996.

In 1995, Leary was asked by Boston Bruins legend Cam Neely to help orchestrate a Boston-based comedy benefit show for Neely&#x27;s cancer charity; this became Comics Come Home, which Leary has hosted annually ever since. Leary has appeared in many films, including &quot;The Sandlot&quot; as Scott&#x27;s stepfather Bill, &quot;Monument Ave.&quot;, &quot;The Matchmaker&quot;, &quot;The Ref&quot;, &quot;Draft Day&quot;, &quot;Suicide Kings&quot;, &quot;Dawg&quot;, &quot;Wag the Dog&quot;, &quot;Demolition Man&quot; (as an Emmanuel Goldstein-esque revolutionary to Nigel Hawthorne&#x27;s Big Brother), &quot;Judgment Night&quot;, &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot; and &quot;Operation Dumbo Drop&quot;. He had a role in Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; that was eventually cut. He held the lead role in two television series, &quot;The Job&quot; and &quot;Rescue Me &quot;. He co-created the latter, in which he played Tommy Gavin, a New York City firefighter dealing with alcoholism, family dysfunction and other issues in post-9/11 New York City.
Leary received Emmy Award nominations in 2006 and 2007 for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for &quot;Rescue Me&quot;, and in 2008 for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for the HBO movie &quot;Recount&quot;. Leary was offered the role of Dignam in &quot;The Departed&quot; (2006) but turned it down because of scheduling conflicts with &quot;Rescue Me&quot;. He provided voices for characters in animated films, such as a fire-breathing dragon named Flame in the series &quot;The Agents&quot;, a pugnacious ladybug named Francis in &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; and a prehistoric saber-toothed tiger named Diego in the &quot;Ice Age&quot; film series. He has produced numerous movies, television shows, and specials through his production company, Apostle; these include Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;Shorties Watchin&#x27; Shorties&quot;, the stand-up special &quot;Denis Leary&#x27;s Merry F#$%in&#x27; Christmas&quot; and the movie &quot;Blow&quot;. 

As a Boston Red Sox fan, Leary narrated the official 2004 World Series film. In 2006, Leary and Lenny Clarke appeared on television during a Red Sox telecast and, upon realizing that Red Sox first baseman Kevin Youkilis is Jewish, delivered a criticism of Mel Gibson&#x27;s antisemitic comments. As an ice hockey fan, Leary hosted the National Hockey League video &quot;NHL&#x27;s Greatest Goals&quot;. In 2003, he was the subject of the &quot;Comedy Central Roast of Denis Leary&quot;.

Leary did the TV voiceover for MLB 2K8 advertisements, using his trademark rant style in baseball terms, and ads for the 2009 Ford F-150 pickup truck. He has also appeared in commercials for Hulu and DirecTV&#x27;s NFL Sunday Ticket package. Leary was a producer of the Fox series &quot;Canterbury&#x27;s Law&quot;, and wrote and directed its pilot episode. &quot;Canterbury&#x27;s Law&quot; aired in the spring of 2008 and was canceled after eight episodes. On September 9, 2008, Leary hosted the sixth annual &quot;Fashion Rocks&quot; event, which aired on CBS. In December of the year, he appeared in a video on funnyordie.com critiquing a list of some of his &quot;best&quot; films, titled &quot;Denis Leary Remembers Denis Leary Movies&quot;. Also in 2008, Leary voiced a guest role as himself in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Lost Verizon&quot;.

On March 21, 2009, Leary began the Rescue Me Comedy Tour in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The 11-date tour, featuring &quot;Rescue Me&quot; co-stars Lenny Clarke and Adam Ferrara, was Leary&#x27;s first stand-up comedy tour in 12 years. The Comedy Central special &quot;Douchebags and Donuts&quot;, filmed during the tour, debuted on American television on January 16, 2011, with a DVD release on January 18, 2011.

Leary played Captain George Stacy in the movie &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, released in July 2012. He wrote the American adaptation of &quot;Sirens&quot;. He is an executive producer of the documentary &quot;Burn&quot;, which chronicles the struggles of the Detroit Fire Department. &quot;Burn&quot; won the 2012 Tribeca Film Festival Audience Award.

Leary created a television series for FX called &quot;Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll&quot;, taking the starring role himself. A 10-episode first season was ordered by FX, with the premiere on July 16, 2015. The show ran for two seasons.

In 2022, he was cast in the recurring role of Frank Donnelly, an NYPD officer on &quot;Law &amp; Order: Organized Crime&quot;.

Leary has been the narrator for NESN&#x27;s documentary show about the Boston Bruins called &quot;Behind the B&quot; since the show began in 2013.

==Personal life==

Leary has been married to author Ann Lembeck Leary since 1989. They met when he was her instructor in an English class at Emerson College. They have two children, son John Joseph &quot;Jack&quot; (born 1990) and daughter Devin (born 1992). Ann Leary published a memoir, &quot;An Innocent, a Broad&quot;, about the premature birth of their son on a visit to London. She has also written a novel, &quot;Outtakes From a Marriage&quot;, which was published in 2008. Her second novel, &quot;The Good House&quot;, was published in 2013. Her essay in a New York Times column about her marriage to Denis inspired the &quot;Modern Love&quot; series Episode 4: &quot;Rallying to Keep the Game Alive&quot;.

Leary is an ice hockey fan and has a backyard rink at his home in Roxbury, Connecticut, with piping installed under the ice surface to help it stay frozen. He is a fan of the Boston Bruins and the Boston Red Sox, as well as the Green Bay Packers.

Leary describes himself as a &quot;Jack Kennedy Democrat&quot; with some conservative ideologies, including support for the military. Leary told Glenn Beck, &quot;I was a life-long Democrat, but now at my age, I&#x27;ve come to realize that the Democrats suck, and the Republicans suck, and basically the entire system sucks. But you have to go within the system to find what you want.&quot;

Leary has said of his religious beliefs, &quot;I&#x27;m a lapsed Catholic in the best sense of the word. You know, I was raised with Irish parents, Irish immigrant parents. My parents, you know, prayed all the time, took us to Mass. And my father would sometimes swear in Gaelic. It doesn&#x27;t get more religious than that. But, no, after a while, they taught us wrong. I didn&#x27;t raise my kids with the fear of God. I raised my kids with the sense of, you know, to me, Jesus was this great guy...&quot;

Leary is godfather to Damian Hurley, the son of actress Elizabeth Hurley.

==Leary Firefighters Foundation==

On December 3, 1999, six firefighters from Leary&#x27;s hometown of Worcester were killed in the Worcester Cold Storage Warehouse fire. Among the dead were Leary&#x27;s cousin Jerry Lucey, as well as Leary&#x27;s close childhood friend, Lt. Tommy Spencer. In response, the comedian founded the Leary Firefighters Foundation. Since its creation in the year 2000, the foundation has distributed over $2.5 million (USD) to fire departments in the Worcester, Boston and New York City areas for equipment, training materials, new vehicles and new facilities. Leary won $125,000 for the foundation on the game show &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot;.

A separate fund run by Leary&#x27;s foundation, the Fund for New York&#x27;s Bravest, has distributed over $2 million to the families of the 343 firemen killed in the September 11 attacks in 2001, in addition to providing funding for necessities such as a new mobile command center, first-responder training, and a high-rise simulator for the New York City Fire Department&#x27;s training campus. As the foundation&#x27;s president, Leary has been active in all of the fundraising. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, Leary donated over a dozen boats to the New Orleans Fire Department to aid in rescue efforts in future disasters. The foundation also rebuilt entire NOLA firehouses.

==Controversies==
===Plagiarism===
For many years, Leary had been friends with fellow comedian Bill Hicks. But when Leary&#x27;s comedy album &quot;No Cure for Cancer&quot; was released, Leary was accused of stealing Hicks&#x27; act and material, ending their friendship abruptly. In April 1993, the &quot;Austin Comedy News&quot; remarked on the similarities of Leary&#x27;s performance: &quot;Watching Leary is like seeing Hicks from two years ago. He smokes with the same mannerisms. (Hicks recently quit.) He sports the same attitude, the same clothes. He touches on almost all of the same themes. Leary even invokes Jim Fixx.&quot; When asked about this, Hicks told the magazine, &quot;I have a scoop for you. I stole his [Leary&#x27;s] act. I camouflaged it with punchlines, and to really throw people off, I did it before he did&quot;.

At least three stand-up comedians have gone on the record stating they believe Leary stole Hicks&#x27; material, comedic persona and attitude. One similar routine was about the so-called Judas Priest &quot;suicide trial,&quot; during which Hicks says, &quot;I don&#x27;t think we lost a cancer cure.&quot;

During Leary&#x27;s 2003 Comedy Central Roast, comedian Lenny Clarke, a friend of Leary&#x27;s, said there was a carton of cigarettes backstage from Bill Hicks with the message, &quot;Wish I had gotten these to you sooner.&quot; This joke was cut from the final broadcast.

The feud is also mentioned in Cynthia True&#x27;s biography &quot;American Scream: The Bill Hicks Story&quot;:
According to the book, True said that upon hearing a tape of Leary&#x27;s album &quot;No Cure for Cancer&quot;, &quot;Bill was furious. All these years, aside from the occasional jibe, he had pretty much shrugged off Leary&#x27;s lifting. Comedians borrowed, stole stuff and even bought bits from one another. Milton Berle and Robin Williams were famous for it. This was different. Leary had, practically line for line, taken huge chunks of Bill&#x27;s act and &quot;recorded&quot; it.&quot;

In a 2008 appearance on &quot;The Opie and Anthony Show&quot;, comedian Louis C.K. claimed Leary stole his &quot;I&#x27;m an asshole&quot; routine, which was then expanded upon and turned into a hit song by Leary. On a later episode of the same show, Leary challenged this assertion by claiming to have co-written the song with Chris Phillips.

===Autism===
In his 2008 book &quot;Why We Suck: A Feel Good Guide to Staying Fat, Loud, Lazy and Stupid&quot;, Leary wrote:

Leary later stated that the quote was taken out of context and that in that paragraph he had been talking about what he calls the trend of &quot;unwarranted&quot; over-diagnosis of autism, which he attributed to American parents seeking an excuse for behavioral problems and under-performance. Later, he apologized to parents with children diagnosed with autism whom he had offended.

<doc id="8879" wikidata="Q7303086" url="?curid=8879" title="Recreational use of dextromethorphan">
<text>Dextromethorphan, or DXM, a common active ingredient found in many over-the-counter cough suppressant cold medicines, is used as a recreational drug and entheogen for its dissociative effects. Street names include Brownies, Dextro, Drix, Gel, Groove, Lean, Mega-perls, Poor man&#x27;s ecstasy, Poor man&#x27;s PCP, Red devils, Robo, Rojo, Rome, Skittles, Sizzurp, Triple Cs, Sky and Velvet.

It has almost no psychoactive effects at medically recommended doses. However, dextromethorphan has powerful dissociative and euphoric properties when administered in doses well above those considered therapeutic for cough suppression. Recreational use of DXM is sometimes referred to in slang form as &quot;robo-tripping&quot; or &quot;skittling&quot;, whose prefix derives from the Robitussin brand name, or &quot;Triple Cs&quot;, which derives from the Coricidin brand whose tablets are printed with &quot;CC+C&quot; for &quot;Coricidin Cough and Cold&quot;. However, this brand presents additional danger when used at recreational doses due to the presence of chlorpheniramine (antihistamine).

In over-the-counter formulations, DXM is often combined with acetaminophen (paracetamol, APAP) to relieve pain; however, to achieve DXM&#x27;s dissociative effects, the maximum daily therapeutic dose of 4000 mg of APAP is often exceeded, potentially causing acute or chronic liver failure, making abuse and subsequent tolerance of products which contain both DXM and APAP potentially fatal.

An online essay first published in 1995 entitled &quot;The DXM FAQ&quot; described dextromethorphan&#x27;s potential for recreational use, and classified its effects into so-called plateaus. Each plateau is categorized depending on how much MG of DXM is ingested, each featuring varying or more intense effects. The defined number of plateaus vary depending on source, but the generally agreed-upon number is 4 or 5.

Owing to its recreational use, many retailers in the US have moved dextromethorphan-containing products behind the counter so that one must ask a pharmacist to receive them or be 18 years (19 in New York and Alabama, 21 in Mississippi) or older to purchase them. Some retailers also give out printed recommendations about the potential for abuse with the purchase of products containing dextromethorphan.

== Classification ==
At high doses, dextromethorphan is classified as a dissociative general anesthetic and hallucinogen, similar to the controlled substances ketamine and phencyclidine (PCP). Also like those drugs, dextromethorphan is an NMDA receptor antagonist. It generally does not produce withdrawal symptoms characteristic of physical dependence-inducing substances, but cases of both psychological dependence and physical dependence have been reported in the past, although physical dependence is usually only seen in cases of heavy abuse. Due to dextromethorphan&#x27;s selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor-like action, the sudden cessation of recreational dosing in tolerant individuals can result in mental and physical withdrawal symptoms similar to the withdrawal from SSRIs. These withdrawal effects can manifest as psychological effects, including depression, irritability, cravings, and as physical effects, including lethargy, body aches, and a sensation of unpleasant tingling, not unlike a mild &quot;electric shock&quot;.

==Effects==
Dextromethorphan&#x27;s effects have been divided into four plateaus.
#The first plateau (1.5 to 2.5 mg per kg body weight) is described as having euphoria, auditory changes, mild stimulation, and change in perception of gravity.
#The second plateau (2.5 to 7.5 mg/kg) causes intense euphoria, vivid imagination, and closed-eye hallucinations.
#The third and fourth plateaus (7.5 mg/kg and over) cause profound alterations in consciousness, and users often report out-of-body experiences or temporary psychosis. This results in a sort of flanging (speeding up and/or slowing down) of sensory input, which is another characteristic effect of recreational use.

Also, a marked difference is seen between dextromethorphan hydrobromide, contained in most cough suppressant preparations, and dextromethorphan polistirex, contained in the brand name preparation Delsym. Polistirex is a polymer that is bonded to the dextromethorphan that requires more time for the stomach to digest it, as it requires that an ion exchange reaction take place prior to its dissolution into the blood. Because of this, dextromethorphan polistirex takes considerably longer to absorb, resulting in more gradual and longer lasting effects reminiscent of time-release pills. As a cough suppressant, the polistirex version lasts up to 12 hours. This duration also holds true when used recreationally.

In 1981, a paper by Gosselin estimated that the lethal dose is between 50 and 500 mg/kg. Doses as high as 15–20 mg/kg are taken by some recreational users. A single case study suggests that the antidote to dextromethorphan overdose is naloxone, administered intravenously.

In addition to producing PCP-like mental effects, high doses may cause a false-positive result for PCP and opiates in some drug tests.

== Risks associated with use ==

Dextromethorphan has not been shown to cause vacuolization in animals, also known as Olney&#x27;s lesions, despite early speculation that it might, due to similarities with ketamine. In rats, oral administration of dextromethorphan did not cause vacuolization in laboratory tests. Oral administration of dextromethorphan repeatedly during adolescence, however, has been shown to impair learning in those rats during adulthood. The occurrence of Olney&#x27;s lesions in humans, however, has not been proven or disproven.

William E. White, author of the &quot;DXM FAQ&quot;, has compiled informal research from correspondence with dextromethorphan users suggesting that heavy abuse may result in various deficits corresponding to the brain areas affected by Olney&#x27;s lesions; these include loss of episodic memory, decline in ability to learn, abnormalities in some aspects of visual processing, and deficits of abstract language comprehension. In 2004, however, White retracted the article in which he made these claims.

A formal survey of dextromethorphan users showed that more than half of users reported experience of these withdrawal symptoms individually for the first week after long-term/addictive dextromethorphan use: fatigue, apathy, flashbacks, and constipation. Over a quarter reported insomnia, nightmares, anhedonia, impaired memory, attention deficit, and decreased libido. Rarer side effects included panic attacks, impaired learning, tremor, jaundice, urticaria (hives), and myalgia. Medical DXM use has not been shown to cause the above issues.

=== Other ingredients ===

Misuse of multisymptom cold medications, rather than use of a cough suppressant whose sole active ingredient is dextromethorphan, carries significant risk of fatality or serious illness. Multisymptom cold medicines contain other active ingredients, such as paracetamol (acetaminophen), which can cause permanent bodily damage such as kidney failure or death if taken in quantities exceeding the recommended dose. Chlorphenamine and phenylephrine may also contribute to the harm. Sorbitol, an artificial sweetener found in many cough syrups containing dextromethorphan, can also have negative side effects, including diarrhea and nausea when taken at recreational dosages of dextromethorphan. Guaifenesin, an expectorant commonly accompanying dextromethorphan in cough preparations, can cause unpleasant symptoms including vomiting, nausea, kidney stones, and headache.

=== Interactions ===

Combining dextromethorphan with other substances can compound risks. Central nervous system (CNS) stimulants such as amphetamine and/or cocaine can cause a dangerous rise in blood pressure and heart rate. CNS depressants such as alcohol will have a combined depressant effect, which can cause a decreased respiratory rate. Combining dextromethorphan with other CYP2D6 substrates can cause both drugs to build to dangerous levels in the bloodstream. Combining dextromethorphan with other serotonergic drugs could possibly cause serotonin syndrome, an excess of serotonergic activity in the CNS and peripheral nervous system.

== Pharmacology ==
Dextromethorphan is primarily a sigma receptor agonist and an SNRI, and dextromethorphan&#x27;s effects as a dissociative hallucinogen may be attributed partially to dextrorphan (DXO), a metabolite produced when dextromethorphan is metabolized by the body. Both dextrorphan and dextromethorphan are NMDA receptor antagonists, alike other dissociative hallucinogens such as ketamine and PCP. Although dextrorphan is more potent than its &quot;parent molecule&quot; dextromethorphan, it likely works in combination with dextromethorphan to produce hallucinogenic effects due to only a small percentage of dextromethorphan being metabolized into dextrorphan.

As NMDA receptor antagonists, dextrorphan and dextromethorphan inhibit the excitatory amino acid and neurotransmitter glutamate in the brain. This can effectively slow, or even shut down certain neural pathways, preventing areas of the brain from communicating with each other. This leaves the user feeling dissociated or disconnected, experienced as brain fog or derealization.

== Legality ==
Antitussive preparations containing dextromethorphan are legal to purchase from pharmacies in most countries, with some exceptions being UAE, France, and Sweden. In Russia, dextromethorphan (commonly sold under the brand names Tussin+ and Glycodin) is a Schedule III controlled substance and is placed in the same list as benzodiazepines and the majority of barbiturates.

=== China ===
In December 2021, the National Medical Products Administration reclassified all oral single-component dextromethorphan to prescription drugs due to potential abuse. The authorities also mandated manufacturers to remove statements like &quot;no addiction or tolerance with long-term use&quot; from their instructions. Despite the online sales ban, the drug can still be found on some niche e-commerce platforms in China and Twitter.

In April 2024, the National Medical Products Administration announced that dextromethorphan, compound diphenoxylate tablets, nalfurafine, and lorcaserin are included in the second-class psychotropic drug catalog. The announcement took effect in July. In August, Xi&#x27;an police arrested a suspect and seized 23 boxes of dextromethorphan; in October, the Hepu County People&#x27;s Court sentenced one defendant to 7 months in prison, while the Yanchi County People&#x27;s Court sentenced a pharmacy owner to 6 months, both for drug trafficking involving dextromethorphan.

===Indonesia===
After previously being available over the counter, the National Agency of Drug and Food Control of Republic of Indonesia (BPOM-RI) now prohibits single-component dextromethorphan drug sales with or without prescription. Indonesia is the only country in the world that makes single-component dextromethorphan illegal even by prescription and violators may be prosecuted by law. Indonesian National Narcotic Bureau has even threatened to revoke pharmacies&#x27; and drug stores&#x27; licenses if they still stock dextromethorphan, and will notify the police for criminal prosecution. As a result of this regulation, 130 drugs have been withdrawn from the market, but drugs containing multicomponent dextromethorphan can be sold over the counter. In its official press release, the bureau also stated that dextromethorphan is often used as a substitute for marijuana, amphetamine, and heroin by drug abusers, and its use as an antitussive is less beneficial nowadays.

The Director of Narcotics, Psychotropics, and Addictive Substances Control (NAPZA) BPOM-RI, Dr. Danardi Sosrosumihardjo, SpKJ, explains that dextromethorphan, morphine, and heroin are derived from the same tree, and states the effect of dextromethorphan to be equivalent to 1/100 of morphine and injected heroin.
By contrast, the Deputy of Therapeutic Product and NAPZA Supervision BPOM-RI, Dra. Antonia Retno Tyas Utami, Apt. MEpid., states that dextromethorphan, being chemically similar to morphine, has a much more dangerous and direct effect to the central nervous system, thus causing mental breakdown in the user. She also claimed, without citing any prior scientific study or review, that unlike morphine users, dextromethorphan users cannot be rehabilitated. This claim is contradicted by numerous scientific studies which show that naloxone alone offers effective treatment and promising therapy results in treating dextromethorphan addiction and poisoning. Dra. Antonia Retno Tyas Utami also claimed high rates of dextromethorphan abuse - including fatalities - in Indonesia, and even more questionable, suggested that codeine, despite being a more physically addictive μ-opioid class antitussive, be made available as an alternative to dextromethorphan.

=== United States ===

No legal distinction currently exists in the United States between medical and recreational use, sale, or purchase. Some states and store chains have implemented restrictions, such as requiring signatures for DXM sale, limiting quantities allowable for purchase, and requiring that purchasers be over the age of majority in their state. The sale of dextromethorphan in its pure powder form may incur penalties, although no explicit law exists prohibiting its sale or possession, other than in Illinois. Cases of individuals being sentenced to time in prison and other penalties for selling pure dextromethorphan in this form have been reported, because of the incidental violation of more general laws for the sale of legitimate drugs – such as resale of a medication without proper warning labels.

Dextromethorphan was excluded from the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) of 1970 and was specifically excluded from the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. As of 2010, it was still excluded from U.S. Schedules of Controlled Substances; however, officials have warned that it could still be added if increased abuse warrants its scheduling. The motivation behind its exclusion from the CSA was that under the CSA, all optical isomers of listed Schedule II opiates are automatically Schedule II substances. Since dextromethorphan is an optical isomer of the Schedule II opiate levomethorphan (but does not act like an opiate), an exemption was necessary to keep it an uncontrolled substance. The Federal Analog Act does not apply to dextromethorphan because a new drug application has been filed for it.

<text>In Greek mythology, Dryope (; Ancient Greek: Δρυόπη derived from δρῦς &quot;drys&quot;, &quot;oak&quot;; &quot;dryope&quot; &quot;woodpecker&quot;) is the name attributed to several distinct figures:

*Dryope, daughter of Dryops and mother of Amphissus by Apollo. She was the wife of Andraemon.
* Dryope, mother of Tarquitus by Faunus, the god of the woods. Tarquitus was slain by Aeneas.
* Dryope, a nymph responsible for kidnapping Hylas, which she did in accord with Hera&#x27;s will. Her name may have to do with the fact that Hylas was the son of Theiodamas, the king of the Dryopes.
* Dryope, a Theban woman of Phoenician origin, mother of Chromis. She joined the Maenads disregarding her pregnancy, and went into labor when she was dragging a sacrificial bull by the horns.
* Dryope, a Lemnian.
* Dryope, mother of the Oenotropae by Anius.

<doc id="8881" wikidata="Q4618975" url="?curid=8881" title="Doctor (title)">
<text>Doctor is an academic title that originates from the Latin word of the same spelling and meaning. The word is originally an agentive noun of the Latin verb &#x27;to teach&#x27;. It has been used as an academic title in Europe since the 13th century, when the first doctorates were awarded at the University of Bologna and the University of Paris.

Having become established in European universities, this usage spread around the world. Contracted &quot;Dr&quot; or &quot;Dr.&quot;, it is used as a designation for a person who has obtained a doctorate (commonly a PhD). In past usage, the term could be applied to any learned person. In many parts of the world today it is also used by medical practitioners, regardless of whether they hold a doctoral-level degree.

==Origins==
The doctorate () appeared in medieval Europe as a license to teach () at a medieval university. Its roots can be traced to the early church, when the term &quot;doctor&quot; referred to the Apostles, church fathers and other Christian authorities who taught and interpreted the Bible. The right to grant a &quot;licentia docendi&quot; was originally reserved to the church which required the applicant to pass a test, take an Oath of allegiance and pay a fee. The Third Council of the Lateran of 1179 guaranteed the access — now largely free of charge — of all able applicants, who were, however, still tested for aptitude by the ecclesiastic scholastic. This right remained a bone of contention between church authorities and the slowly emancipating universities, but was granted by the pope to the University of Paris in 1213, when it became a universal license to teach (&quot;licentia ubiquie docendi&quot;). However, while the licentia continued to hold more prestige than the bachelor&#x27;s degree (&quot;Baccalaureus&quot;), it was eventually positioned below the magister and the doctorate, which became the only titles with which one could teach.

The earliest doctoral degrees — in theology, law, and medicine — reflected the historical separation of university study into these three fields. Over time, the Doctor of Divinity has become less common, whereas studies in law and medicine have become more common. These areas were historically referred to as &quot;philosophy&quot; (used as a general term for academic studies, not the specific academic discipline of philosophy), but are now classified as humanities and sciences, respectively. The historical usage survives in the degree of Doctor of Philosophy).

The Doctor of Philosophy was originally a degree granted by a university to learned individuals who had achieved the approval of their peers and who had demonstrated a long and productive career in the field of philosophy (in the broad sense of the term, meaning the pursuit of knowledge). The appellation &quot;Doctor&quot; (from Latin: teacher) was usually awarded only when the individual was in middle age. It indicated a life dedicated to learning, knowledge, and the spread of knowledge. The PhD entered widespread use in the 19th century at Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin as a degree to be granted to someone who had undertaken original research in the sciences or humanities. Prior to the formal degree, the contemporary doctorate (PhD), arguably, arose in Leipzig as a successor to the Master&#x27;s degree in 1652 (Dr. habil).

In some European countries, such as Italy and Portugal, &quot;Doctor&quot; became a title given to all or most degree holders, not just those with doctorates.
As a result, the title is now used by many professionals in these countries, including those such as lawyers who are not normally granted the title elsewhere. The title is also used for lawyers in South America, where they have traditionally earned doctoral degrees, as well as in the former Portuguese territories of Goa in India and Macau in China.

===Development in English-speaking countries===

The primary meaning of &quot;Doctor&quot; in English has historically been with reference to the holder of a doctoral degree. These particularly referred to the ancient faculties of divinity, law and medicine, sometimes with the addition of music, which were the only doctoral degrees offered until the 19th century. During the 19th century, PhDs became increasingly common in Britain, although to obtain the degree it was necessary to travel to continental Europe or (from 1861) to the United States, as the degree was not awarded in the UK until 1917.

However, the title, not being protected by law, was adopted by quacks. As a result, by the mid 19th century, it was normal in the UK to omit the title &quot;Dr&quot; when addressing letters to those holding doctoral degrees, and instead write the abbreviated form of the degree after the name, e.g., &quot;The Reverend Robert Phelps, D.D.&quot;, &quot;Thomas Elliotson, Esq. M.D.&quot;, or &quot;John Lindsey, Esq. Ph.D.&quot;, in order to avoid classing academic doctors &quot;with the village apothecary and the farrier&quot; and various &quot;quacks in literature, science, or art&quot;. In the US it similarly became customary to use post-nominals rather than the title of Doctor when addressing letters. All those with doctoral degrees continued to use the title professionally and socially.

Despite being historically associated with doctorates in law, the title of &quot;doctor&quot; for lawyers has not customarily been used in English-speaking countries, where lawyers were traditionally not required to have a university degree and were trained by other lawyers by apprenticeship or in the Inns of Court. The exception being those areas where, up to the 19th century, civil law rather than common law was the governing tradition, including admiralty law, probate and ecclesiastical law: such cases were heard in the Doctor&#x27;s Commons, and argued by advocates who held degrees either of doctor of civil law at Oxford or doctor of law at Cambridge. As such, lawyers practicing common law in England were not doctoral candidates and had not earned a doctorate. When university degrees became more common for those wanting to qualify as a lawyer in England, the degree awarded was the Bachelor of Laws (LLB). Similarly in the US, even though degrees became standard for lawyers much earlier, the degree was again the LLB, only becoming the Juris Doctor (JD) generally in the latter half of the 20th century.

In many English-speaking countries, it is common to refer to physicians by the title of doctor, even when they do not hold a doctoral level qualification. The word &quot;Doctor&quot; has long had a secondary meaning in English of physician, e.g., in Johnson&#x27;s Dictionary, which quotes its use with this meaning by Shakespeare. In the US, the medical societies established the proprietary medical colleges in the 19th century to award their own MDs, but in the UK and the British Empire, where degree granting was strictly controlled, this was not an option. The usage of the title to refer to medical practitioners, even when they did not hold doctoral degrees, was common by the mid 18th century. However, the first official recognition of Doctor being applied as a title to medical practitioners regardless of whether they held a doctoral degree was in 1838, when the Royal College of Physicians resolved that it would &quot;regard in the same light, and address by the same appellation, all who have obtained its diploma, whether they have graduated elsewhere or not.&quot;

The Medical Act 1858 made it illegal for anyone not qualified in medicine to use a title that implied they were. This led to prosecutions of people making unauthorised use of the title &quot;Dr&quot;. However, it also called into question the use of the title by licentiates of the Colleges of Physicians – all of whom were, under the new act, allowed to practice throughout the UK. In 1859, the London College reversed its earlier decision, resolving &quot;That the title of Doctor shall not be given in any official document issued from this College to any person who is not possessed of the Degree of Doctor of Medicine&quot;. This was followed up in 1860 by new bylaws that stated &quot;No Fellow, Member, or Licentiate of the College shall assume the title of Doctor of Medicine, or use any other name, title, designation or distinction implying that he is a Graduate in Medicine of an University, unless he be a Graduate in Medicine of an University&quot;. In Ireland, the question of whether the license of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland granted the title of Doctor of Medicine led to a court case in 1861, with the conclusion that it did not. The &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; (&quot;BMJ&quot;) observed, however, that anyone wanting the right to the title of &quot;Doctor&quot; could gain it &quot;with a five-shilling degree of Doctor of Philosophy&quot; from abroad, or could simply assume the title, as only &quot;Doctor of Medicine&quot; was actually protected. Debate continued as to the use of &quot;Doctor&quot; as a courtesy title by those who did not use it by right as holders of doctoral degrees, with the &quot;BMJ&quot; noting in 1876 that &quot;We have again a sort of flood of letters for and against the use of the title of Doctor by physicians&quot; and in 1882 that &quot;There is not any other subject which appears to excite so wide spread an interest as this&quot;. In February 1876, a report recommended that the Royal College of Physicians should use the courtesy title of Doctor for all fellows and members, but this was rejected. Then in April of the same year, the college amended its bylaws to forbid any fellow, member, extra-licentiate or licentiate from using the title of Doctor unless they had a doctorate in medicine from a recognised university – closing the loophole the &quot;BMJ&quot; had identified. It was not until the early 20th century that this was reversed. In 1905 the Royal College of Surgeons passed a motion instructing their council &quot;to take the necessary steps in conjunction with the Royal College of Physicians to ensure that all persons who pass the Conjoint examination shall be legally entitled to call themselves Doctors&quot;. The council of the surgeons&#x27; College felt it to be impractical to secure the legal right to the title as this would mean gaining the right to award MDs, but noted that the title had been used by the public to refer to medics for generations and was used without any legal right by Bachelors of Medicine – the only obstacle to licentiates of both colleges doing the same was the prohibition in the physicians&#x27; bylaws. On this occasion the College of Physicians refused to act, but they did finally relent in 1912, removing the clause forbidding the assumption of the title of Doctor. This was described in the American press as &quot;the British apostles of red-tape have been forced to bow to the popular will&quot;.

Regulation of the medical profession also took place in the United States in the latter half of the 19th century, preventing quacks from using the title of Doctor. However, medical usage of the title was far from exclusive, with it being acknowledged that other doctorate holders could use the title and that dentists and veterinarians frequently did. &quot;The Etiquette of To-day&quot;, published in 1913, recommended addressing letters to physicians &quot;(full name), M.D.&quot; and those to other people holding doctorates &quot;Dr. (full name)&quot;, although both were &quot;Dr.&quot; in the salutation and only physicians were explicitly said to include their title on their visiting card. By the 1920s there were a great variety of doctorates in the US, many of them taking entrants directly from high school, and ranging from the Doctor of Chiropractic (DC), which (at the time) required only two or three years of college-level education, up to the PhD. All doctoral degree holders, with the exception of the JD, were customarily addressed as &quot;Doctor&quot;, but the title was also regularly used, without doctoral degrees, by pharmacists, ministers of religion, teachers and chiropodists, and sometimes by other professions such as beauty practitioners, patent medicine manufacturers, etc.

By the 1940s, the widespread usage of the title in the US was under threat. A 1944 article claimed that &quot;the Ph.D. has immediate and far-reaching value of social as well as economic nature&quot; due to America&#x27;s &quot;national fondness for the tinsel of titles&quot;, but went on to note that some universities were moving away from using the title, concluding that &quot;it is ungracious in most environments not to render unto the Doctor of Philosophy his &#x27;Doctor&#x27; title&quot;. The same writer noted in a letter to the &quot;Journal of Higher Education&quot; in 1948 that Alfred University had banned the use of the title for faculty (while retaining it for the president and deans) &quot;in a strange move professedly designed to uphold and promote &#x27;democracy&#x27; and &#x27;Americanism. However, it was noted in 1959 that professors with PhDs were now generally addressed as &quot;Doctor&quot;, with the title of &quot;Professor&quot; sometimes being substituted for those without doctorates, leading to a decline in the perceived value of that title.
In the 1960s the inconsistent usage at American universities and colleges was mentioned in the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; and the editor of &quot;Science&quot; noted that: &quot;In some universities, administrators call all Ph.D.&#x27;s &#x27;Mister,&#x27; but students and colleagues call them &#x27;Doctor.&#x27; Often, but not always, Ph.D.&#x27;s are &#x27;Misters&#x27; socially. In industry and government, both socially and professionally, they are &#x27;Doctors,&#x27; as they are also in the pages of the &quot;New Yorker&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, the &quot;Saturday Review&quot;, and the New York &quot;Times&quot;.&quot; In 1965, the League of Women Voters designated MDs &quot;Dr.&quot; and PhDs &quot;Mr.&quot; at a hustings in Princeton, leading to a letter of protest in &quot;Science&quot;; it was reported that the League believed PhDs would be embarrassed by the title, and that etiquette writers differed in whether PhDs used the title. In 1970, reverse snobbism in the face of the rising number of &quot;discount doctorates&quot; was linked to professors at prestigious universities wanting to be called &quot;mister&quot;.

In the late 1960s the rising number of American law schools awarding Juris Doctor (JD) degrees led to debate over whether lawyers could ethically use the title &quot;Doctor&quot;. Initial informal ethics opinions, based on the Canons of Professional Ethics then in force, came down against this. These were then reinforced with a full ethics opinion that maintained the ban on using the title in legal practice as a form of self-laudation (except when dealing with countries where the use of &quot;Doctor&quot; by lawyers was standard practice), but allowed the use of the title in academia &quot;if the school of graduation thinks of the J.D. degree as a doctor&#x27;s degree&quot;. These opinions led to further debate. The introduction of the new Code of Professional Responsibility in 1969 seemed to settle the question – in states where this was adopted – in favour of allowing the use of the title. There was some dispute over whether only the PhD-level Doctor of Juridical Science should properly be seen as granting the title, but ethics opinions made it clear that the new Code allowed JD-holders to be called &quot;Doctor&quot;, while reaffirming that the older Canons did not. As not all state bars adopted the new Code, and some omitted the clause permitting the use of the title, confusion over whether lawyers could ethically use the title &quot;Doctor&quot; continued. The introduction of further professional doctorates in the US at ISCED level 7, the same as the MD and JD, has led to continuing debate about the use of the title by holders of such degrees, particularly in medical contexts.

In 2018, a decision by &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; newspaper in Canada to update its style guide so as to restrict the use of the title Doctor to medics led to a backlash on Twitter, particularly by women with PhDs, using the #ImmodestWomen hashtag. This was widely reported on internationally and led to &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; reverting to its earlier style of using Doctor for both physicians and PhD holders. The Canadian University of Calgary also announced that it would adopt the use of Doctor for those with doctoral degrees, breaking with the style recommended by the Canadian Press.

==Doctor as a noun==
Throughout much of the academic world, the term &quot;Doctor&quot; refers to someone who has earned a doctoral degree (highest degree) from a university. This is normally the Doctor of Philosophy, abbreviated PhD (sometimes Ph.D. in North America) from the Latin &quot;Philosophiae Doctor&quot; or DPhil from its English name, or equivalent research doctorates at level 8 of the International Standard Classification of Education 2011 classifications (ISCED 2011) or level 6 of the ISCED 1997 classifications. Beyond academia (but specifically in the anglophone world, Italy, and France), &quot;Doctor&quot; as a noun normally refers to a physician, who would usually hold a qualification at level 7 of ISCED 2011/level 5 of ISCED 1997 such as the British MBBS or the American MD or DO.

==Forms of address==

When addressing several people, each of whom holds a doctoral title, one may use the plural contraction &quot;Drs&quot; (or &quot;Drs.&quot; in American English) – or in some languages (for example, German) &quot;Dres.&quot; (from the Latin ) may be used – for example, instead of Dr. Miller and Dr. Ahmed: Drs. Miller and Ahmed. When referring to relatives with the same surname the form &quot;The Doctors Smith&quot; can be used. The abbreviation Drs. can also refer to doctorandus, a Dutch academic title that was replaced with the master title with the introduction of the master system.

In English, Dr is not usually combined with other titles, except for The Reverend in &quot;The Revd Dr&quot; before the surname of a minister of religion, e.g., &quot;The Revd Dr Smith&quot; or &quot;The Revd John Smith, DD&quot;, and similarly &quot;Rabbi Dr&quot;. In Caribbean English, the usage &quot;Dr. the Honourable&quot; is common for politicians holding doctoral degrees. Usage in many other languages is similar to English but some, notably German, allow for the stacking of titles.

==Usage by medical practitioners in the UK and culturally-related countries==
In the United Kingdom, India, Pakistan, Hong Kong, Trinidad and Tobago, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Ghana, and other countries whose cultures were recently linked to the UK, the title &quot;Dr&quot; is generally used both for those who hold doctoral degrees and for registered medical practitioners. History has dictated the use of the courtesy title &quot;Dr&quot; by physicians and general practitioners. However, surgeons do not use the title of &quot;Dr&quot; and, due to the origins of surgery with the barber surgeons, instead use &quot;Mr, Mrs, Ms, Miss&quot;, etc. This custom applies to surgeons of any grade who have passed the appropriate exams and is not the exclusive province of consultant-level surgeons. In recent times, other surgically orientated specialists, such as gynaecologists, have also adopted these prefixes. A surgeon who is also a professor is usually known as &quot;Professor&quot; and, similarly, a surgeon who has been ennobled, knighted, created a baronet or appointed a dame uses the corresponding title (Lord, Sir, Dame). Physicians, on the other hand, when they pass their &quot;MRCP(UK)&quot; examinations, or equivalent, do not drop &quot;Dr&quot; but retain it, even as consultants. The status and rank of consultant surgeons, addressed as &quot;Mister&quot; or &quot;Ms.&quot;, and consultant physicians, addressed as &quot;Doctor&quot;, is equivalent.

==Worldwide usage==

===Asia===

====Bangladesh====
In Bangladesh, use of the title of doctor (or Dr) is permitted for PhD degree holders and registered medical practitioners. For registered medical practitioners, only MBBS and BDS degree holders are allowed to use the title and be called &quot;medical doctors&quot;. Registered veterinary practitioners may use the title after earning a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) degree. However, registered homeopathic practitioners also use the title of doctor even though, according to the Homeopathic Practitioners Ordinance 1983, they are only permitted to use &quot;homeopath&quot;. Physiotherapy has no separate council and no act of parliament at present permits the use of the title for physiotherapist, but the High Court has given an interim order that permits physiotherapy graduates to use the title, pending the formation of a separate council. According to the Bangladesh Unani &amp; Ayurvedic Practitioners Ordinance 1983, practitioners of the Unani system are called &quot;Tabib&quot; or &quot;Hakim&quot; and practitioners of Ayurvedic system are called &quot;Vaid&quot; or &quot;Kabiraj&quot;; both are prohibited from using the title of doctor. Currently, medical practitioners having an MBBS degree or dental surgeons having a BDS are legally permitted to use Dr as a prefix; its use by other medical practitioners remains controversial.

==== Hong Kong ====
Hong Kong follows British practice in calling physicians &quot;Doctor&quot; even though many of them hold only a degree of Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS or MBChB). An attempt by their professional body to prevent chiropractors from calling themselves &quot;Doctor&quot; failed in the courts, in part because it was pointed out that practicing chiropractors may hold an academic doctorate in their discipline, and it would be anomalous to prevent them using the title when holders of doctorates in non-medical disciplines faced no such restriction.

====India====
In India, medical practitioners are legally referred to as &quot;registered medical practitioners&quot;. The title of doctor is frequently used by qualified professional medical practitioners in the fields of Allopathic medicine (MBBS) and dentistry (BDS), as well as by other practitioners like Siddha (BSMS), Yoga and Naturopathy (BNYS), Ayurveda (BAMS), Unani medicine (BUMS) and Homeopathy(BHMS), Veterinarians (BVSc) and holders of doctoral degrees, including PhDs and pharmacists with PharmDs. Physiotherapists (BPT) use &#x27;Doctor&#x27; as a suffix accompanied by the prefix PT.

The usage by pharmacists is legally disputed, while the Supreme Court of India has ruled against the use of the title as a prefix by physiotherapists.

====Indonesia====
The Indonesian titles &quot;dr.&quot; is used in front of the name of medical doctor who holds a specification as general practitioner, also when the doctor already holds his specialization to ___, such as &quot;Sp.THT&quot; or &quot;Spesialis Telinga, Hidung, Tenggorokan&quot; (ENT or Ear, Nose, and Throat Specialist).

Dr. is used in front of the name as the title &quot;Doktor&quot; for doctorate title, the same level as PhD title.

====Pakistan====
In Pakistan, the title of Doctor (Dr.) can be used by PhD degree holders as well as medical, dental, optometry and veterinary doctors with MBBS, BDS, OD and DVM degrees respectively. Usage by physiotherapists DPT degree respectively is disputed, with the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council saying they should not use the title, but the Pharmacy Council of Pakistan (the regulatory body for pharmacists) and the Higher Education Commission permitting and encouraging its use.

====Philippines====
In the Philippines, titles and names of occupations usually follow Spanish naming conventions which utilize gender-specific terms. &quot;&quot;Doktór&quot; is the masculine form, which retains the abbreviation &quot;Dr.&quot;; the feminine form is &quot;Doktóra&quot;, and is abbreviated usually as &quot;Dra.&quot;&quot;; others, however, some being Anglophones who wish to sound modern and Westernised (or were raised in an almost exclusively English-speaking family environment), or some who advocate gender equality, would dispense with the distinction altogether. There does exist in Filipino an equivalent, gender-neutral term for the professional that carries the more general notion of &quot;healer&quot;, traditional (for example, an &quot;albuláryo&quot;) or otherwise: &quot;manggagámot&quot;. Contracted &quot;Dr&quot; or &quot;Dr.&quot;, it is also used as a designation for a person who has obtained a doctorate degree (e.g. PhD, EdD, DPA).

====Sri Lanka====
In Sri Lanka the title doctor &quot;Dr.&quot; is used for PhD holders and medical practitioner such as physicians, surgeons, dental surgeons and veterinarians. However, when addressing in native Sinhalese a medical practitioner is addressed as &quot;Vaidya&quot; (වෛද්ය) or &quot;Dosthara&quot; (දොස්තර) while a PhD holder is addressed as &quot;Aacharya&quot; (ආචාර්ය). It is a common practice for married female medical practitioners to use the title &quot;Dr (Mrs)&quot; in a both professional and social capacity.

====Thailand====
The usage of Doctor (ดอกเตอร์) or Dr (ดร.) has been borrowed from English. It can be seen as a title in academic circles and in the mass media. In contrast to other academic titles (Professor, Associate Professor and assistant professor), the use of Doctor as a title has not been recognized by the Royal Institute of Thailand. Therefore, this title, in theory, cannot be used officially. For example, in court of justice where strictly formal Thai language is used, Dr cannot be mentioned as a person&#x27;s title.

===The Americas===

====Brazil====
The &#x27;doctor&#x27; title is used by individuals holding a PhD degree. &#x27;Doctor&#x27; is also used as a deferential title in Brazilian Portuguese. The title “Doctor” can also be used in Brazil to address medics and lawyers by the law since the imperial times. The law was enacted by the second Brazilian emperor, Dom Pedro II, to attract more medics and lawyers from other countries in imperial times when there was very few practitioners of both professions in the country for the crescent population of that time. The law still is enacted.

====Canada====
Canada lies somewhere between British and American usage of the degree and terminology of &quot;doctor&quot;. Holders of research doctorates – PhDs and similar degrees – commonly use the title &quot;doctor&quot;. A number of regulated healthcare professionals can also use the title &quot;doctor&quot;; in Ontario these are limited by law (in the provision of health care) to physicians, dentists, optometrists, chiropractors, doctorate-level psychologists and social workers who are members of the relevant Ontario college. In Alberta, Registered Nurses or Nurse Practitioners with an earned doctoral degree may use the title &quot;doctor&quot; in conjunction with professional practice. Some professionals earn degrees with the title of doctor but which are considered, despite their name, to be at bachelor&#x27;s-level, e.g. DDS, MD, JD. In Ontario, registered naturopathic doctors may only use the title &quot;doctor&quot; in written format if they also use the phrase, &quot;naturopathic doctor&quot; immediately following their name, while a 2006 amendment that would allow practitioners of Traditional Chinese Medicine to use the title has not, , entered into force. As of 2022, in Alberta, Doctors of Acupuncture may use the doctor title.

=====Quebec=====
The usage of the French &quot;Docteur&quot; and &quot;Docteure&quot;, and their abbreviated forms &quot;Dr&quot;, &quot;Dre&quot;, &quot;D&quot; and &quot;D&quot;, is controlled by the &quot;Code des professions&quot;. As a pre-nominal title it can be used without any further explication by physicians, veterinarians, and dentists. It can also be used prenominally, when accompanied by the name of the profession immediately after the name, by professionals who require a doctorate for their professional licence, such as psychology, and chiropractic, e.g. &quot;Dr X, psychologue&quot; or &quot;Dr Y, chiropraticien&quot;. Academic doctors, where the doctorate is not required to practice, bear the title only after their name; this is not abbreviated, e.g. &quot;M. Z, docteur en philosophie&quot; not &quot;M. Z, PhD&quot;

====United States====
In the United States, the use of the title &quot;Doctor&quot; is dependent upon the setting. The title is commonly used socially by physicians and those holding doctoral degrees; however, there was formerly a division between Letitia Baldrige and Miss Manners on its social usage by those who are not physicians. Baldrige saw this usage as acceptable, while in contrast, Miss Manners wrote that &quot;only people of the medical profession correctly use the title of doctor socially,&quot; but supports those who wish to use it in social contexts in the spirit of addressing people according to their wishes. Miss Manners has since softened her approach, noting in her &quot;The Washington Post&quot; column that there are two approaches: &quot;having been earned, it should be used&quot; and &quot;that level of education being assumed, it need not be expressly mentioned&quot;; while she maintains that everyone should be addressed according to their wishes, she no longer states that only medical professionals use the title correctly but instead acknowledges that the title has been earned by those with PhDs. The Emily Post Institute similarly advises that &quot;Socially as well as professionally, medical doctors, dentists, and other professionals are addressed by, and introduced with, their titles. People who have earned a Ph.D. or any other academic, nonmedical doctoral degree have the choice of whether to use &quot;Dr.&quot; both professionally and socially.&quot; Other advice columns have also noted that &quot;it has become common to see someone with a Ph.D. addressed on the envelope as Dr., and as a consequence, deviation from convention has become acceptable.&quot; The 2017 book &quot;Etiquette Rules!&quot; gives identical forms for addressing a &quot;doctor of medicine (MD), dental surgery (DDS), veterinary medicine (DVM), etc.&quot;, and the holder of a PhD, advising in both cases the use of initials after the name for formal correspondence and Dr. before the name for social correspondence. Although the usage of the title by Ph.D. graduates has become common, its use socially by holders of professional doctorates (other than those noted) is neither explicitly endorsed nor explicitly discouraged by writers on etiquette. Miss Manners has, however, stated that a physician who has had their license revoked should be addressed by their former preferred honorific (i.e. not according to their MD degree). It is unusual for those who hold honorary doctorates to use the title &quot;Doctor&quot;.

Publications from the office of the President of the United States of America also refer to PhD holders as Dr. Soandso,
and Jill Biden, who holds an EdD, used the style &quot;Dr. Jill Biden&quot; as second lady and has continued to do so as first lady. For addresses (defined as &quot;the conventional forms of address as determined by social and official custom&quot;), NASA uses &quot;Dr. (full name)&quot; in addresses for PhD holders while for physicians it uses &quot;(full name), MD&quot;, although both are addressed as &quot;Dr. (surname)&quot; in the salutation (which is described as &quot;informal&quot;). The National Institutes of Health similarly use &quot;Dr. (surname)&quot; in salutations for people with an MD, PhD or DDS. They advise using full name followed by degrees in addresses, explicitly stating not to use the title &quot;Dr.&quot;, although an example in the following paragraph does use the title rather than giving degrees.

Most newspapers in the US follow the AP Stylebook and reserve the title for physicians in their house styles; notable exceptions include &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which follows the preference of the individual when referring to PhD holders (although the title is not used for those with honorary doctorates),
and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, which similarly prefers &quot;Dr.&quot; for PhD holders and physicians (if this is the person&#x27;s choice) while stating explicitly that the title is not used for lawyers with JDs or people with honorary doctorates. Until 1989, The Washington Post used the title for &quot;practitioners of the healing arts (including chiropractors and osteopaths) but not for holders of PhDs or honorary degrees&quot;, after which it dropped its use entirely. Some sources state that AP style allows the use of Dr. for holders of non-medical doctoral degrees as long as their speciality is given.

The expansion of professional doctorates in clinical fields in the late 20th and early 21st centuries has led to disputes between physicians and other medical professions over who can use the title in a clinical context. This has been interpreted by some as part of larger battles within medicine, such as who gets to treat patients first and who has prescribing authority. The American Medical Association calls for non-physicians (those not holding an MD or DO) who use the title &quot;Doctor&quot; and are in direct contact with patients to clarify that they are not physicians and to &quot;define the nature of their doctorate degree&quot;, while the American Osteopathic Association opposes the use of the title by non-physicians in clinical settings absolutely as (in their view) &quot;such use deceives the public&quot;. Contrary to this, the Emergency Nurses Association has adopted as a position statement that &quot;1. Nurses are entitled to have their educational degrees recognized and acknowledged in the same manner as other professions. 2. The proper title protection and use of accurate credentials is appropriate in the clinical setting. 3. When being addressed or introduced as doctor in the clinical environment, it is responsible practice for all healthcare providers to clarify their professional role. 4. Patients, families and the general public have a right and expectation to be informed regarding the credentials of their caregivers, including the use of the title &quot;doctor&quot;.&quot;

The American Medical Association launched a campaign in 2011 for states to adopt &quot;truth in advertising&quot; legislation. As a result, many states now have laws in place that protect the title of doctor when offering medical services. In some jurisdictions, the use of the title in health care is limited to those who have both a doctorate and are licensed to practice medicine, and there is a requirement that the field of the doctorate be disclosed. Some other jurisdictions require the practitioner to hold a doctorate and to disclose the field, but make no stipulations as to licensing. Some states require name badges to be worn in medical facilities giving first name, licensure status, and staff position, although these laws may not explicitly address the use of the title &quot;Doctor&quot;.

Although lawyers in the United States do not customarily use the title, the law degree in that country is the Juris Doctor, a professional doctorate. Some JD holders in the United States use the title of doctor in professional situations, although ethics board decisions have varied on whether this is permissible or might mislead the public into believing the lawyer was medically qualified or had a PhD. It is also sometimes used by JD holders in academic situations. In 2011, &quot;Mother Jones&quot; published an article claiming that Michele Bachmann was misrepresenting her qualifications by using the &quot;bogus&quot; title Dr. based on her JD. The article was later amended to note that the use of the title by lawyers &quot;is a (begrudgingly) accepted practice in some states and not in others&quot;, although they maintained that it was rarely used as it &quot;suggests that you&#x27;re a medical doctor or a Ph.D.—and therefore conveys a false level of expertise&quot;.

Ecclesiastical seminaries and entitled churches award their own doctorates in the United States, e.g. the &quot;Doctor of Religious Science&quot; (Dr. sc. rel.), the &quot;Doctor of Divinity&quot; (DD), the &quot;Doctor of Biblical Studies&quot; (DBS) or the &quot;Doctor of Metaphysics&quot; (Dr. mph.). These titles are most commonly awarded to meritorious clerics for their outstanding work or another achievement in the field of religious and biblical studies.

American professional doctorates are not generally considered doctoral level degrees internationally, instead being classified as bachelor&#x27;s or master&#x27;s level. The ISCED mapping for these degrees, developed collaboratively between the US and UNESCO, places them at master&#x27;s level. As a result, holders of MD, JD, PharmD, etc. may not be permitted to use the title of Doctor in countries such as Germany where this is strictly controlled.

===Europe===
In the European Union, the title of &quot;doctor&quot; refers primarily to holders of post-graduate research doctorates, such as the PhD. In many European languages the term &quot;doctor&quot; is distinct from a medical practitioner, which can be referred to as e.g. &quot;läkare&quot; in Swedish, &quot;Arzt&quot; in German, &quot;dokter&quot; or &quot;arts&quot; in Dutch, or &quot;lääkäri&quot; in Finnish.

Standardisation of degrees into the three cycles of bachelor&#x27;s–master&#x27;s–doctorate across the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) is being carried out through the Bologna process, although not all EHEA member states have fully conformed to the 1999 Bologna declaration in favour of their own historic customs. With respect to the title &quot;doctor&quot;, the Bologna process makes no prescriptions regarding the names of degrees nor the titles they may confer. However, under the Lisbon Recognition Convention, recognition of a foreign degree allows &quot;the use of an academic title, subject to the laws and regulations of the country in which recognition is sought&quot;. According to the &quot;Explanatory report&quot;, this means that: &quot;The competent authorities of the Parties may grant the right to use the title in the exact form in which it was awarded in the Party concerned or in any other form. They may alternatively grant the right to use the corresponding title of the country in which recognition is sought.&quot;

====Austria====
In Austria, the degree &quot;Doktor&quot; is granted to holders of research degrees (ISCED 8) with a denoting Latin particle being added (&quot;Dr. techn.&quot;, &quot;Dr. phil.&quot;, &quot;Dr. rer. nat.&quot;, &quot;Dr.iur.&quot;, &quot;Dr.theol.&quot; etc.). Newer study programmes award a PhD, but these exist alongside the older degrees since many prefer obtaining a &quot;Dr.&quot; to a PhD. These degrees take 3–4 years full-time and are organised in doctoral schools.

In addition, the academic degree &quot;Doktor&quot; (ISCED 7) is granted to physicians (Dr. med. univ.) and dentists (Dr. med. dent.), who since 2002 do not obtain doctoral degrees (ISCED 8) but instead follow a master&#x27;s level six-year training (360 ECTS) programme, similar to an American MD or DDS. For these degrees, students have to write a &quot;Diplomarbeit&quot; thesis of 50-100 pages. Research doctorates in medicine (Dr. scient. med. or PhD) can also be obtained after a three year full-time post-graduate study programme at a medical university.

All doctors may be addressed as &quot;Doktor _____&quot;; the title is usually contracted to &quot;Dr. _____&quot;, oftentimes they are just addressed as &quot;Herr/Frau Doktor&quot; (Mr/Ms Doctor), omitting the family name unless they are being introduced to someone.

Contrary to popular belief in the country, the title &quot;Dr.&quot; is not part of a person&#x27;s name or a specific honour but simply a degree like BSc/BA, &quot;Mag&quot; (MA/MSc) or &quot;Dipl.-Ing.&quot; (MEng). It is not mandatory to use it, although it may be added to official documents (e.g. driver&#x27;s licence, passport), if desired

====Finland====
In Finland, the title of &quot;tohtori&quot; or &quot;doktor&quot; denotes holder of a research doctorate comparable to a PhD. Getting the doctorate requires advanced studies after the master&#x27;s degree, writing a thesis, nowadays often a thesis by publication, and publicly defending the thesis. Customary doctorates do not exist even in the field of medicine: physicians hold the degree of &quot;lääketieteen lisensiaatti&quot; (Licentiate of Medicine), and are referred to simply as &quot;lääkäri&quot; (physician); &quot;tohtori&quot; would be rustic or old-fashioned. A research doctorate in medicine, &quot;lääketieteen tohtori&quot;, requires further research work and a separate doctoral thesis, and is not taken by all medical graduates. Regardless, in Finnish usage, the use of titles is uncommon and restricted to only the most formal of contexts.

====France====

In France, the title of &quot;Docteur&quot; is only used generally for physicians (&quot;médecin&quot;) but can also be used by holders of research doctorates. Medical professionals do not normally hold a doctorate, which in France always refers to a research doctorate, but a &quot;State Diploma of Doctor of Medicine&quot; (&quot;Diplôme d&#x27;État de docteur en médecine&quot;).

The law in France allows the title of Dr to be used professionally by holders of research doctorates, with the field of their speciality being mentioned after the name. The courts have ruled that stating the specialisation is not necessary except in circumstances specifically related to professional practice; at other times the title alone may be used. The courts have also determined that questioning the right of the holder of a research doctorate to use the title Dr is a form of libel. The National Union of Hospital Scientists (&quot;Syndicat National des Scientifiques Hospitaliers&quot;) launched a campaign in 2015 to raise awareness of the right of scientists to use the title.

====Germany====
In German language-speaking countries, the word &quot;Doktor&quot; refers to a doctorate awardee in formal language (similar to a PhD). It is distinct from &quot;Arzt&quot;, since a doctoral degree is not a requirement for medical practitioners, though colloquial use of the word &quot;Doktor&quot; for physician is common and ordinary people often incorrectly assume that only Doktors may practice medicine. For this reason, 80% of all students in medicine write &quot;doctoral&quot; dissertations, often comparable to a master&#x27;s thesis in science, alongside their undergraduate studies to obtain a Dr. med. degree. The European Research Council decided in 2010 that those Dr. med. doctorates do not meet the international standards of a PhD research degree.

In Germany, the most common doctoral degrees are &quot;Dr. med.&quot; (medicine), &quot;Dr. med. dent.&quot; (dentistry), &quot;Dr. med. vet.&quot; (veterinary medicine), &quot;Dr. rer. nat.&quot; (natural sciences), &quot;Dr. phil.&quot; (humanities), &quot;Dr. iur.&quot; (law), &quot;Dr. rer. pol.&quot; (economic and political sciences, also as Dr. rer. oec. in Switzerland), &quot;Dr.-Ing.&quot; (engineering), and &quot;Dr. theol.&quot; (theology). All holders of doctoral degrees are appropriately addressed as &quot;Herr/Frau Dr. _____&quot; in all social situations.

In Germany, double doctorates are indicated in the title by &quot;Dr. Dr.&quot; or &quot;DDr.&quot; and triple doctorates as &quot;Dr. Dr. Dr.&quot; or &quot;DDDr.&quot; More doctorates are indicated by the addition of &quot;mult.&quot;, such as &quot;Dr. mult.&quot; Honorary titles are shown with the addition of &quot;h.c.&quot;, which stands for &quot;honoris causa&quot;. Example: &quot;Dr. h.c. mult.&quot; Some honorary titles are shown by addition of German equivalents of &quot;h.c.&quot;, like &quot;e.h.&quot;, &quot;E.h.&quot;, or &quot;eh.&quot;, which stand for &quot;ehrenhalber&quot; (honorary). Example: &quot;Dr. e.h. mult.&quot;

All people holding a doctorate from an EU member state are, since 2001, entitled to use &quot;Doctor&quot; or &quot;Dr.&quot; in all formal, legal and published communications without any further addenda. For academics with doctorates from non-EU member states, the qualification must be recognised formally (&quot;validated&quot;) by the Federal Educational Ministry in Bonn. The recognition process can be done by the employer or employee and may be part of the official bureaucracy for confirming professional status and is dependent on individual bilateral agreements between Germany and other countries and, since 2007, the Lisbon Recognition Convention. An example of mutual recognition of Doctor titles among EU countries is the &quot;Bonn Agreement of November 14, 1994&quot;, signed between Germany and Spain (prior to the general recognition of EU doctorates).

In 2008, The Standing Conference of the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder in the Federal Republic of Germany extended their 2001 decision to recognise EU PhDs to cover PhDs that were awarded in Australia, Israel, Japan, Canada, and some American universities. It was announced in 2012 that this would be further extended to cover PhDs awarded in New Zealand. PhDs that were awarded in the United States are recognized if the awarding institution is classified by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching as a &quot;Research University (high research activity)&quot; or as a &quot;Research University (very high research activity).&quot; Permission to use the title covers only scientific research degrees and does not extend to professional degrees such as the MD or JD.

====Greece====
In Greece, doctor &quot;Διδάκτωρ&quot; (&quot;didáktor&quot;) is indicated in the title as Δρ and it is used for holders of doctoral degrees. Other alternative names are also used, namely «δόκτωρ» and «δόκτορας», derived from the French &quot;docteur&quot;. The term &quot;Ιατρός&quot; (&quot;iatrós&quot;) indicates medical practitioners.

====Hungary====

In Hungary, graduates of six-year medical schools (&quot;dr. med.&quot;), five-year dentistry schools (&quot;dr. med. dent.&quot;), five-year law schools (&quot;dr. jur.&quot;) and five-year veterinary medical schools (&quot;dr. vet.&quot;) receive the title of a &quot;doctor&quot; at the end of their studies, after completing and successfully defending their thesis; their undergraduate studies must have lasted for a minimum of three years. Completing a PhD research programme (or DLA in arts and music) also leads to the doctor title. Since 2008, also those who graduated of five-year pharmacy schools have the right to use the title &quot;dr&quot; (&quot;dr. pharm.&quot;).

A large part of Hungarians with doctor titles received their titles for research in the old academic system before PhD was introduced in Hungary. Since the introduction of PhD title (1993), the &quot;dr. univ&quot; title (given before 1993). The CSc &quot;Candidate of Science&quot; title was a scientific title in the old academic system and is now treated as an equivalent of PhD. CSc titles were awarded by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.

The highest level doctoral degree in Hungary is DSc &quot;Doctor of Sciences&quot;, awarded by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. It is also called &quot;Doctor of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences&quot;.

The title of doctor used to become a part of the name and was added as such to personal identity documents. This practice is still common and graduates after receiving their diploma would usually change their personal documents in order to officially indicate the achievement.

====Ireland====
Usage in Ireland is similar to that in the UK. The title of doctor is used for holders of doctoral degrees as well as for medical practitioners (except surgeons), dentists, and vets. The title is also used in Ireland for Catholic bishops, who are styled &quot;The Most Reverend Dr X, Bishop of Y&quot; on envelopes.

====Italy====
The first university of Western civilization, the University of Bologna, is located in Italy, where until modern times the only degree granted was that of the doctorate, and all other Italian universities followed that model. During the 20th century Italian universities introduced more advanced research degrees, such as the PhD.

Italian academia is part of the Bologna Process, and has standardised its degrees as part of the 3+2+3 formula. The undergraduate degree &quot;laurea&quot; was reduced to 3 years (making it equivalent to a Bachelor&#x27;s degree). This is followed by a 2 year &quot;laurea magistrale&quot; (literally &quot;magistral degree&quot;, equivalent to a Master&#x27;s degree). The old-system &quot;laurea&quot;, which lasted about 5–6 years and is now discontinued, were made equivalent to a &quot;laurea magistrale&quot;. Few fields retain the 5-6 year system (such as law and medicine) but are called &quot;laurea magistrale a ciclo unico&quot; and are an integrated master&#x27;s degree. Finally, the Italian system also introduced a doctorate (&quot;dottorato di ricerca&quot;), which lasts 3 years and is the terminal degree of the educational hierarchy, corresponding to a PhD.

For historical reasons, the title of doctor is awarded to all university degree holders. &quot;Laurea&quot; holders are awarded the title of doctor (dottore/dottoressa), &quot;laurea magistrale&quot; holders are awarded the title of magistral doctor (dottore magistrale/dottoressa magistrale), and doctorate holders are called research doctors (dottore di ricerca/dottoressa di ricerca).

====Malta====
In Malta, the title of Doctor is used by academic doctors (with PhDs), medical practitioners, dentists and lawyers. Its use by lawyers is due to the qualifying degree for practicing law having been the LLD until reforms in 2014, and has been described as &quot;historical baggage&quot; by the Dean of the University of Malta&#x27;s law school. Lawyers do not generally use the title when practicing outside of Malta.

====Netherlands====
In the Dutch language doctor is used both for physicians and for the academic title, however the spelling differs with &quot;dokter&quot; referring to a physician, whereas &quot;doctor&quot; refers to the academic title. Both doctor titles are abbreviated as dr. placed before the holders name (note the lowercase).

To enter a Dutch doctoral defense, the candidate must hold a validated master&#x27;s degree (a master&#x27;s degree of an acknowledged university, or a master equivalent degree validated on a case-by-case basis by the Dutch government). In some cases the candidate can be granted special dispensation if no master&#x27;s degree is held.
There is no specific notation of the discipline in which the doctorate is obtained. Once the doctorate is obtained the preceding master&#x27;s degree is generally no longer reported. Exceptions only exist for the disciplines with specific master titles of engineering &quot;ir.&quot; (&quot;ingenieur&quot;, i.e. Engineer) and law &quot;mr.&quot; (&quot;meester&quot;, i.e. Master of Law) where the title dr. is added to the original master title. For these disciplines, the original master&#x27;s degree abbreviation is combined with the dr. abbreviation thus resulting in for example &quot;dr. ir. Familyman&quot;. The dr. title is always placed in front of the ir. title. In the case of a PhD in law, the original mr. title is placed before the dr. title (mr. dr., see e.g. Jan Peter Balkenende). For a person having a law master&#x27;s degree, but holding a PhD in another field than law the mr. title is placed after the dr. title (dr. mr.). No specific notation or title for the medical disciplines exists in the Netherlands. Although a physician is usually referred to as &quot;dokter&quot; (note the spelling difference) this does not necessarily imply the physician holds a doctoral degree; nor does it give the physician a title equivalent to that of PhD.

Confusion can be caused by the original Dutch Master level title &quot;drs.&quot; (for all non-engineering and non-law master&#x27;s degrees). This abbreviation stands for the Dutch title doctorandus Latin for &quot;he who should become a doctor&quot; (female form is &quot;doctoranda&quot;). Dutch drs. should not be confused with the plural &#x27;doctorates&#x27;: having multiple PhDs. Once a doctorate is achieved the doctorandus is promoted to doctor, and no longer uses the drs. abbreviation.
Stacking of multiples titles of the same level, as seen in countries like for example Germany (Dr. Dr. Dr. Musterfrau) is highly uncommon in the Netherlands (although stacking of titles with different levels is common: prof. dr. ir. Appelmans). Those who have multiple doctor titles may use dr.mult. before their name, although this is rarely used.

After obtaining a doctorate successfully, Dutch doctors may bear either the title dr. (lower case) before, or the letter D (rarely in practice) behind their name, but not both simultaneously. In the Netherlands, Academic titles are used exclusively within academia. Holding a doctorate has become a standard requirement for a university career. The doctor title has little to no meaning or implications for public life outside academia. It cannot be added to documentation (e.g. passport, drivers licence), and is used infrequently in daily practice.

Historically, the Netherlands used their own academic degree nomenclature, but for many years now have recognised and implemented the Bologna declaration. In everyday practice, the Anglo Saxon titles (e.g. PhD) are frequently used. Dutch academic titles and degrees are legally protected, and as of 2021 the traditional ’dr.’ and the PhD are legally equivalent and can be used interchangeably. Doctoral degrees (PhD degrees) can only be granted by recognised (research) universities. Illegal use of the title is considered a misdemeanour and subject to legal prosecution.

====Portugal====
In Portugal, up to recent times after the completion of an undergraduate degree – except in architecture and engineering – a person was referred to as &quot;doutor (Dr.) – male&quot; or &quot;doutora (Dra.) – female&quot;. The architects and engineers were referred by their professional titles: &quot;arquitecto&quot; (Arq.) and &quot;engenheiro&quot; (Eng.). Nurses are also referred to as &quot;nurse&quot;, &quot;enfermeiro&quot; (male) or &quot;enfermeira&quot; (female), the title being &quot;Enf.&quot; for both.

Nowadays Portugal is a signatory to the Bologna process and according to the current legislation the title of Doctor (&quot;doutor, doutora&quot;) is reserved for graduate holders of an academic doctorate. Professions such as physicians, attorneys, pharmacists, veterinarians, and few others are usually referred to by the title Dr. (doutor) even if they have not been awarded a doctoral degree.

However, custom gives the legislation little strength and most graduates use the Dr. title in its abbreviated form, although use of the full &quot;Doutor&quot; is normally restricted to those with doctorates. Those who are both holders of an academic doctorate and Professors at a college level are generally referred to as &quot;Professor Doutor&quot;.

====Spain====
The social standing of Doctors in Spain is evidenced by the fact that only PhD holders, Grandees and Dukes can take seat and cover their heads in the presence of the King.

PhD Degrees are regulated by Royal Decree (RD 1393–2007), &quot;Real Decreto&quot; (in Spanish). They are granted by the university on behalf of the King, and its Diploma has the force of a public document. The Ministry of Science keeps a national database of doctoral theses called TESEO. Any person who uses the Spanish title of &quot;doctor/doctora&quot; (or &quot;Dr./Dra.&quot;) without being included in this Government database can be prosecuted for fraud. However, the Spanish Royal Academy recognises that it is used colloquially to describe physicians, even without doctoral degrees, as well as (in the feminine form, &quot;doctora&quot;, abbreviated &quot;Dra.&quot;) the wives of doctors (i.e. holders of doctoral degrees) and medics, as well as &quot;women who shine with wisdom and understanding&quot;.

Unlike other countries, until recently Spain has registered a comparatively small number of Doctor degree holders, but the tendency is changing. According to the Spanish Statistical Office (INE), less than 5% of MSc degree holders are admitted to PhD programs. This reinforces the prestige that Doctors have historically enjoyed in Spain&#x27;s society.

====United Kingdom====

Doctor is commonly used in the United Kingdom as the title for a person who has received a doctoral degree or, as courtesy title, for a qualified medical practitioner or dentist who does not have a doctorate. There are no restrictions on the use of the title &quot;Doctor&quot; in the United Kingdom, except where, in commercial advertising, it might imply that the user holds a general medical qualification. The UK government allows medical doctors and holders of doctorates to have the title recorded on the observations page of their UK passport. The lack of legal restrictions was confirmed in Parliament in 1996 by health minister Gerald Malone, who noted that the title doctor had never been restricted by law to either medical practitioners or those with doctoral degrees in the UK, although the titles &quot;physician, doctor of medicine, licentiate in medicine and surgery, bachelor of medicine, surgeon, general practitioner and apothecary&quot; were protected.

According to the etiquette guide, Debrett&#x27;s, holders of doctoral degrees and medical doctors (but not surgeons) should be addressed as &quot;Doctor&quot;. For medical doctors, &quot;Doctor&quot; is a professional title rather than an academic one: it is due to their being a medical practitioner rather than their having gained a doctoral degree. The Quality Assurance Agency states that &quot;The use of the title &#x27;Dr&#x27; by medical doctors is a historical abbreviation for the profession; it does not indicate a qualification at doctoral level&quot;. On guest lists and seating plans for formal events, holders of academic doctorates (but not medical doctors or other people using the title as a courtesy title) are listed either as &quot;Dr John Smith&quot; or &quot;John Smith, Esq, PhD&quot;, while untitled men (other than those holding doctorates) are shown as either &quot;Mr John Smith&quot; or &quot;John Smith, Esq&quot; (as appropriate to ensure the styling remains consistent). The title &quot;Dr&quot; is also used on visiting cards.

Medical students in the UK normally complete a course of study leading to the degree of Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS, BMBS or MBChB). The MD degree is not a qualifying degree in the UK, but can be either a professional doctorate (at the same academic level as a PhD), a doctorate by thesis, or a higher doctorate, depending on the university. To be eligible for an MD degree in the UK one must already hold an entry-level medical degree (for example, MBBS, MBChB, BMed, or a North American MD degree) and usually must have had at least 5 years of postgraduate training and experience. Trainee doctors are permitted to use the title Doctor once they have started their post-graduation &quot;Foundation Programme&quot;.

Debrett&#x27;s states that medical doctors (except surgeons) should be addressed on envelopes as &quot;Dr (full name), (medical qualifications)&quot;, e.g. &quot;Dr John Smith, MD&quot;, &quot;Dr Anne Jones, MB BS, FRCP&quot;, &quot;Dr David Evans, MB ChB&quot;, contrary to the normal rule of not mixing titles and post-nominals. Surgeons (and dentists, if not holding a doctoral degree) should be &quot;(full name), Esq, (medical/dental qualifications)&quot;, e.g. &quot;John Smith, Esq, MS, FRCS&quot;, &quot;David Evans, Esq., BDS&quot;, but &quot;Dr Anne Jones, DDS, FDS RCS&quot;. By contrast, those holding (non medical or dental) doctoral degrees, if not surgeons, should be &quot;Dr (full name)&quot; without post-nominals on envelopes, e.g. &quot;Dr John Smith&quot;.

A &amp; C Black&#x27;s &quot;Titles and Forms of Address&quot; diverges from Debrett&#x27;s on how to address envelopes to medical doctors, omitting the pre-nominal title of Dr (e.g. John Smith, Esq, MD; John Smith, MD; John Smith, MB) except in Scotland and for general practitioners, where the post-nominals are instead usually omitted (e.g. Dr John Smith). Black&#x27;s also state that it is down to individual choice whether non-medical doctors are addressed on envelopes as &quot;Dr John Smith&quot; or &quot;John Smith, Esq, PhD&quot; (or appropriate letters for the doctorate held), with the exception of doctors of divinity, who would be &quot;The Rev. J. Smith, DD&quot; on the envelope and &quot;Reverend Sir&quot; in a formal salutation (informally in the salutation &quot;Dear Dr Smith&quot;, and &quot;Dr Smith&quot; in speech).

The custom of not referring to surgeons (members and fellows of the Royal College of Surgeons) as Dr has been commented on in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; and may stem from the historical origins of the profession such as that some barbers also used to function as surgeons. In 2005, the then-president of the Royal College of Surgeons called upon surgeons to use the title of Dr, saying that the use of Mr or Miss was confusing to patients. Black&#x27;s note that gynaecologists are addressed as surgeons in England and Wales but as doctors elsewhere.

In a similar manner to the medical MBBS, dentists qualify with a Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS) and vets with a Bachelor of Veterinary Science (BVSc), Bachelor of Veterinary Medicine (BVetMed) or Bachelor of Veterinary Medicine and Surgery (BVMS). All of these are, like the MBBS, master&#x27;s level qualifications that bear bachelor&#x27;s designations for historical reasons.

Dentists have traditionally (as dental surgeons) been referred to in the same way as surgeons, but since 1995 the General Dental Council have permitted dentists to use the title &quot;Doctor&quot;, though many do not choose to do this, thereby stressing their surgeon status. However, Debrett&#x27;s continues to advises that dentists are normally addressed as surgeons and that the title &quot;Doctor&quot; is usually only used for dentists who have a doctoral degree.

On 5 March 2015 the council of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (RCVS) voted to permit its members to use the courtesy title of &quot;Doctor&quot;. Guidance from the RCVS says the title should be used either with the description &quot;veterinary surgeon&quot; or the postnominals &quot;MRCVS&quot; to ensure there is no confusion with doctors of human medicine or holders of doctoral degrees.

Optometrists are not permitted to use the title &quot;Doctor&quot; based on their initial qualification (BOptom or BSc (Optom)). Optometrists can earn PhDs or Doctor of Optometry degrees (in the UK a PhD-level qualification for qualified optometrists with experience in practice). Ophthalmologists are fully qualified medical doctors. However, ophthalmology is considered a branch of surgery, thus ophthalmologists, like other surgeons in the UK, do not use the title &quot;Doctor&quot;.

The General Chiropractic Council permits registered chiropractors to use the title &quot;Doctor&quot;, although it advises chiropractors to avoid using the title in advertising or, if they do, to spell out that they are &quot;Doctors of Chiropractic&quot;. The Committee of Advertising Practice advises, however, that &quot;references to &#x27;DC&#x27; or &#x27;doctor of chiropractic&#x27; are unlikely to dispel that misleading impression [of being a medical practitioner], when used in conjunction with unqualified references to the prefix &#x27;Dr, saying that the use of the title by chiropractors may be acceptable in advertising if &quot;clearly and prominently qualified with additional text which makes clear it is a courtesy title and that the practitioner does not hold a general medical qualification&quot;.

The Advertising Standards Authority has ruled that practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine should not use the title doctor in adverts unless they hold a general medical qualification and are registered with the General Medical Council. It similarly advises that osteopaths should not use the title unless holding a general medical qualification. There have also been rulings that an advert for an osteomyologist which referred to him as a doctor was misleading, as was an advert which used the title &quot;Dr&quot; and the post-nominals &quot;PhD&quot; on the basis of a PhD from an unaccredited university.

Holders of honorary doctorates in the UK have the right, in most cases, to use the title of Doctor, although holders are encouraged to refrain from doing so. Black&#x27;s says that &quot;The same rules apply as to other holders&quot;, although notes that the post-nominals would not normally be used.

In some circumstances, &quot;doctor&quot; may be used on its own as a form of address rather than as a title before a name. This is limited to when the person is being addressed by their job title and so is only used for medical doctors.

=====Wales=====

Wales follows UK usage in English. In Welsh, the holder of a doctoral degree is &quot;doethur&quot; while a medical doctor is &quot;doctor&quot; or &quot;meddyg&quot;. The title &quot;y Doethur&quot; is used by those holding doctorates, e.g. &quot;y Doethur Brinley Jones&quot;, &quot;y Doethur John Elfed Jones&quot;, which can be abbreviated &quot;Dr&quot;. Medical doctors use, as in English, the title &quot;Doctor&quot;, also abbreviated &quot;Dr&quot;.

====Former Yugoslavia====

In countries that were formerly Yugoslavian republics, such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Slovenia the title formally belongs to holders of academic doctoral degree such as doctor of science (dr. sc.) or doctor of arts (dr. art.) degree. There is no &quot;Ph.D.&quot; in any of those countries, even though when holders are translating their dr. sc. degree to English, they nevertheless use &quot;Ph.D.&quot;, even though it should be &quot;D.Sc.&quot; or &quot;Sc.D.&quot;.

Informally, the title, in both its full and abbreviated form (i.e. &quot;dr.&quot;) is used honorifically to address medical doctors even in more formal environment like in lectored media texts, however officially it is reserved only for the holders of academic degrees. Formally the professional title for medical doctor is &quot;lijekar&quot; in Bosnian and Montenegrin, &quot;liječnik&quot; in Croatian, &quot;lekar/лекар&quot; in Macedonian and Serbian and &quot;zdravnik&quot; in Slovenian and they can hold different academic degrees, as well as additional honorific title of &quot;Primarius&quot; that is given to distinguished specialists with exemplary reputation and achievements.

===Oceania===

====Australia====
With the introduction of National Health Practitioner registration legislation on 1 July 2010, the title &quot;doctor&quot; is not restricted in any Australian state. The title &quot;medical practitioner&quot; is restricted for use by registered medical practitioners, while the title &quot;doctor&quot; is not restricted by law. Despite this, the Medical Board of Australia advises that practitioners who are not medical practitioners who choose to use the title &#x27;Doctor&#x27; (or &#x27;Dr&#x27;) should clearly state their profession in advertisements, even if they hold a PhD or another doctoral degree, e.g. &#x27;Dr Smith (Dentist)&#x27; or &#x27;Dr Jones (Chiropodist)&#x27;. The Psychology Board of Australia prohibits psychologists from using the title, to avoid confusion with psychiatrists, unless they hold a doctoral degree, in which case they must make it clear that they are not a medical practitioner or psychiatrist, e.g. by putting &#x27;(Psychologist)&#x27; after their name. The Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF) defines doctoral degrees as being at Level 10 of the framework; it specifies that: &quot;Individuals who have been awarded a Doctoral Degree at Level 10 on the AQF are entitled to use the title &#x27;Doctor&#x27;. The title &#x27;Doctor&#x27; will not be used by those who hold an honorary award.&quot; The name &#x27;Doctor&#x27; is also used in the name of some extended master&#x27;s degrees at Level 9 (e.g. Juris Doctor and Doctor of Medicine); these are not considered doctoral degrees.

==Abbreviation==
Doctor is abbreviated &quot;Dr&quot; in British English and &quot;Dr.&quot; in North American English. The plural abbreviation is &quot;Drs&quot;.

===British usage===
In British English it is not necessary to indicate an abbreviation with a full stop after the abbreviation, when the first and last letters of the abbreviation are the same as for the unabbreviated word, i.e. the abbreviation is a contraction, as in the case for &quot;Doctor&quot;.

In the United Kingdom, it is normal also to omit stops from postnominal letters, thus the usual abbreviation for &quot;Doctor of Philosophy&quot; is &quot;PhD&quot; (or &quot;DPhil&quot;, where this is used). The fully punctuated &quot;Ph.D.&quot; or &quot;D.Phil.&quot; is anachronistic and, where the abbreviated form of the degree is defined by regulation rather than custom (e.g. Oxford), may be technically incorrect.

===American usage===
American English makes no distinction between abbreviations that are contractions and abbreviations that are not. A period is used: the abbreviation of Doctor is usually written as &quot;Dr.&quot; in North America. However, the US Postal Service prefers punctuation to be omitted from addresses.

==Honorary doctorates==

An honorary doctorate is a doctoral degree awarded for service to the institution or the wider community. It may also be awarded for outstanding achievement in a particular field. This service or achievement does not need to be academic in nature. Often, the same set of degrees is used for higher doctorates, but they are distinguished as being &quot;honoris causa&quot;: in comprehensive lists, the lettering used to indicate the possession of a higher doctorate is often adjusted to indicate this, for example, &quot;Hon ScD&quot;, as opposed to the earned research doctorate &quot;ScD&quot;. The degrees of Doctor of the University (DUniv) and Doctor of Humane Letters (DHL), however, are only awarded as honorary degrees.

By convention, recipients of honorary doctorates do not use the title &quot;Dr&quot; in general correspondence, although in formal correspondence from the university issuing the honorary degree it is normal to address the recipient by the title. However, this social convention is not always scrupulously observed; notable people who defied social convention and used the honorary prefix include:

* Benjamin Franklin, who received honorary master&#x27;s degrees from Harvard and Yale in 1753, and from the College of William &amp; Mary in 1756, and doctorates from the University of St Andrews in 1759 and the University of Oxford in 1762 for his scientific accomplishments. He thereafter referred to himself as &quot;Doctor Franklin&quot;.
* Maya Angelou, who held many honorary doctorates, called herself and was referred to by many as &quot;Dr. Angelou&quot; despite holding no undergraduate or advanced (non-honorary) degree.
* Booker T. Washington was often referred to as &quot;Dr. Washington&quot; after receiving an honorary doctorate from Dartmouth College.
* Sukarno, President of Indonesia, was awarded twenty-six honorary doctorates from various international universities including Columbia University, the University of Michigan, the University of Berlin, the Al-Azhar University, the University of Belgrade, the Lomonosov University and many more. And also from domestic universities including the Universitas Gadjah Mada, the Universitas Indonesia, the Bandung Institute of Technology, and the Universitas Padjadjaran. He had often been referred to by Indonesian Government at the time as &#x27;Dr. Ir. Sukarno&#x27;, combined with his degree in architecture (Ir.) from Bandung Institute of Technology. Sukarno is the president with the highest number of honorary doctorates in the world.
* Author and lexicographer Samuel Johnson, who had some years earlier been unable (due to financial considerations) to complete his undergraduate studies at Pembroke College, Oxford, was awarded the degree of Master of Arts by diploma in 1755, in recognition of his scholarly achievements. In 1765, Trinity College Dublin awarded him the degree of Doctor of Laws and in 1775 Oxford bestowed upon him the degree of Doctor of Civil Law by diploma. He never referred to himself as &quot;Dr. Johnson&quot;, even though a degree by diploma is distinct from an honorary degree, but it was used by his contemporaries and in his biography by James Boswell.

==Other uses of &quot;doctor&quot;==
* In some regions, such as the Southern United States, &quot;Doctor&quot; is traditionally added to the first name of people holding doctorates, where it is used in either direct or indirect familiar address.
* &quot;Doc&quot; is a common nickname for someone with a doctoral degree, in real life and in fiction — for example, the gunfighter Doc Holliday, the Australian politician H.V. &quot;Doc&quot; Evatt, the character &quot;Doc&quot; in &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, and pulp hero Doc Savage.
* In Roman Catholicism and several other Christian denominations, a Doctor of the Church is an eminent theologian (for example, Saint Thomas Aquinas, also known as the Angelic Doctor) from whose teachings the whole Church is held to have derived great advantage.
* African leaders often refer to themselves as &quot;Doctor&quot; as part of their title upon assuming office.

<text>Domnall mac Ailpín (Modern Gaelic: &quot;Dòmhnall mac Ailpein&quot;), anglicised sometimes as Donald MacAlpin and known in most modern regnal lists as Donald I (812 – 13 April 862), was King of the Picts from 858 to 862. He followed his brother Kenneth I to the Pictish throne.

== Reign ==
The Chronicle of the Kings of Alba says that Domnall reigned for four years, matching the notices in the Annals of Ulster of his brother&#x27;s death in February 858 and his own in April 862. The Chronicle notes:

The laws of Áed Find are entirely lost, but it has been assumed that, like the laws attributed to Giric of Scotland and Constantine II (Causantín mac Áeda), these related to the church and in particular to granting the privileges and immunities common elsewhere. The significance of Forteviot as the site of this law-making, along with Kenneth&#x27;s death there and Constantine&#x27;s later gathering at nearby Scone, may point to this as being the heartland of the sons of Alpín&#x27;s support.

The Chronicle of Melrose says of Domnall, &quot;in war he was a vigorous soldier ... he is said to have been assassinated at Scone.&quot; No other source reports Domnall&#x27;s death by violence.

The Prophecy of Berchán may refer to Domnall in stanzas 123–124:

Although Domnall is generally supposed to have been childless, it has been suggested that Giric was a son of Domnall, reading his patronym as &quot;mac Domnaill&quot; rather than the commonly supposed &quot;mac Dúngail&quot;. This, however, is not widely accepted.

Domnall died, either at the palace of Cinnbelachoir (location unknown), or at &quot;Rathinveralmond&quot; (also unknown, and maybe the same place, presumed to be near the junction of the Almond and the Tay, near Scone). He was buried on Iona.

<doc id="8884" wikidata="Q473450" url="?curid=8884" title="Danse Macabre">
<text>The Danse Macabre (; ), also called the Dance of Death, is an artistic genre of allegory from the Late Middle Ages on the universality of death.

The &quot;Danse Macabre&quot; consists of the dead, or a personification of death, summoning representatives from all walks of life to dance along to the grave, typically with a pope, emperor, king, child, and labourer. The effect is both frivolous and terrifying, beseeching its audience to react emotionally. It was produced as &quot;memento mori&quot;, to remind people of the fragility of their lives and the vanity of earthly glory. Its origins are postulated from illustrated sermon texts; the earliest recorded visual scheme (apart from 14th century Triumph of Death paintings) was a now-lost mural at Holy Innocents&#x27; Cemetery in Paris dating from 1424 to 1425.

==Background==
Religion is an important contextual factor around the Dance of Death tradition and its effect on the population, with new eschatology concepts in the fourteenth century being critical for the development of the Dance of Death. Early examples of Dance of Death artwork were present in religious contexts such as murals on Christian church walls. These served to remind people about the inevitability of death and urge moral reflection in order to cope with this reality. In his 1998 study on medieval religious practices, historian Francis Rapp wrote thatChristians were moved by the sight of the Infant Jesus playing on his mother&#x27;s knee; their hearts were touched by the Pietà; and patron saints reassured them by their presence. But, all the while, the danse macabre urged them not to forget the end of all earthly things.It is generally agreed upon by scholars that Dance of Death depictions do show realistic dancing based on the quality of gestures seen in artwork and familiarity with steps found in texts. The paintings include body positions that seem to indicate movement, particular gestures, and specific orders and dynamics between the characters, while texts use relevant dance vocabulary. These elements may indicate the presence of past enacted dances and that the depictions were read for a performative function, as hypothesized by Gertsman in her paper “Pleyinge and Peyntynge: Performing the Dance of Death.” This view centers on the incorporation of both visual and theatrical devices in these depictions to create effective artwork. Gertsman writes thatBy drawing its inspiration from the sphere of performance, the Dance of Death imagery, along with its text, invites a performative reading, informed by specific structures of the verses, the concept of movement, and the understanding of the body language of the danse macabre&#x27;s protagonists. However, there is scarce evidence surrounding a physical dancing performance tradition of the Dance of Death outside of its other depictions. The &quot;Danse Macabre&quot; was possibly enacted at village pageants and at court masques, with people &quot;dressing up as corpses from various strata of society&quot;, and may have been the origin of costumes worn during Allhallowtide. Regardless, its main influence has been in the form of visual arts such as murals, paintings, and more.

The bubonic plague and its devastating effects on the European population were significantly contributing factors to the inspiration and solidification of the Dance of Death tradition in the fourteenth century. In her thesis, &quot;The Black Death and its Effect on 14th and 15th Century Art&quot;, Anna Louise Des Ormeaux describes the effect of the Black Death on art, mentioning the &quot;Danse Macabre&quot; as she does so:Some plague art contains gruesome imagery that was directly influenced by the mortality of the plague or by the medieval fascination with the macabre and awareness of death that were augmented by the plague. Some plague art documents psychosocial responses to the fear that plague aroused in its victims. Other plague art is of a subject that directly responds to people&#x27;s reliance on religion to give them hope. The cultural impact of mass outbreaks of disease are not fleeting or temporary. In their paper on “Black Death, Plagues, and the Danse Macabre. Depictions of Epidemics in Art,” Rittershaus and Eschenberg discuss artistic representations of various epidemics starting with the bubonic plague and extending to cholera and recent epidemics. The suffering and realization of death’s closeness, which the black death caused in Europe, were integrated with concepts of morality and Christianity to give rise to the Dance of Death tradition as a direct response to the epidemic. Cholera cases in the nineteenth century inspired a resurgence of Dance of Death depictions after the initial black death depictions, with religious connotations still present but less important. The Dance of Death tradition is a testament to the profound impact of an epidemic on people as depicted in art. A disease’s effect can endure past the initial stages of outbreak, in its deep etching upon the culture and society. This can be seen in the artworks and motifs of &quot;Danse Macabre&quot; as people attempted to cope with the death surrounding them.

==Paintings==
What is often considered to be the earliest recorded visual example is the lost mural on the south wall of the Cemetery of the Holy Innocents in Paris. It was painted in 1424–25 during the regency of John, Duke of Bedford. It features an emphatic inclusion of a dead crowned king at a time when France did not have a crowned king. The mural may well have had a political subtext. However, some have argued that 14th century Triumph of Death paintings such as the fresco by Francesco Traini are also examples of danse macabre.

There were also painted schemes in Basel (the earliest dating from ); a series of paintings on canvas by Bernt Notke (1440–1509) in Lübeck (1463); the initial fragment of the original Bernt Notke painting &quot;Danse Macabre&quot; (accomplished at the end of the 15th century) in the St Nicholas&#x27; Church, Tallinn, Estonia; the painting at the back wall of the chapel of Sv. Marija na Škrilinama in the Istrian town of Beram (1474), painted by Vincent of Kastav; the painting in the Holy Trinity Church of Hrastovlje, Istria by John of Kastav (1490).



A notable example was painted on the cemetery walls of the Dominican Abbey, in Bern, by Niklaus Manuel Deutsch (1484–1530) in 1516/7. This work of art was destroyed when the wall was torn down in 1660, but a 1649 copy by Albrecht Kauw (1621–1681) is extant. There was also a &quot;Dance of Death&quot; painted around 1430 and displayed on the walls of Pardon Churchyard at Old St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, London, with texts by John Lydgate (1370–1451) known as the &#x27;Dance of (St) Poulys&#x27;, which was destroyed in 1549.

The deathly horrors of the 14th century such as recurring famines, the Hundred Years&#x27; War in France, and, most of all, the Black Death, were culturally assimilated throughout Europe. The omnipresent possibility of sudden and painful death increased the religious desire for penance, but it also evoked a hysterical desire for amusement while still possible; a last dance as cold comfort. The &quot;Danse Macabre&quot; combines both desires: in many ways similar to the medieval mystery plays, the dance-with-death allegory was originally a didactic dialogue poem to remind people of the inevitability of death and to advise them strongly to be prepared at all times for death (see &quot;memento mori&quot; and ).

Short verse dialogues between Death and each of its victims, which could have been performed as plays, can be found in the direct aftermath of the Black Death in Germany and in Spain (where it was known as the &quot;Totentanz&quot; and &quot;la Danza de la Muerte&quot;, respectively).

The French term &quot;Danse Macabre&quot; may derive from the Latin &quot;Chorea Machabæorum&quot;, literally &quot;dance of the Maccabees.&quot; In 2 Maccabees, a deuterocanonical book of the Bible, the grim martyrdom of a mother and her seven sons is described and was a well-known medieval subject. It is possible that the Maccabean Martyrs were commemorated in some early French plays, or that people just associated the book&#x27;s vivid descriptions of the martyrdom with the interaction between Death and its prey.

An alternative explanation is that the term entered France via Spain, the , &quot;maqabir&quot; (pl., &quot;cemeteries&quot;) being the root of the word. Both the dialogues and the evolving paintings were ostensive penitential lessons that even illiterate people (who were the overwhelming majority) could understand.

==Mural paintings==

Frescoes and murals dealing with death had a long tradition, and were widespread. For example, the legend of the &quot;Three Living and the Three Dead.&quot; On a ride or hunt, three young gentlemen meet three cadavers (sometimes described as their ancestors) who warn them, &quot;Quod fuimus, estis; quod sumus, vos eritis&quot; (&quot;What we were, you are; what we are, you will be&quot;). Numerous mural versions of that legend from the 13th century onwards have survived (for instance, in the Hospital Church of Wismar or the residential Longthorpe Tower outside Peterborough). Since they showed pictorial sequences of men and corpses covered with shrouds, those paintings are sometimes regarded as cultural precursors of the new genre.

A &quot;Danse Macabre&quot; painting may show a round dance headed by Death or, more usually, a chain of alternating dead and live dancers. From the highest ranks of the mediaeval hierarchy (usually pope and emperor) descending to its lowest (beggar, peasant, and child), each mortal&#x27;s hand is taken by an animated skeleton or cadaver. The famous &quot;Totentanz&quot; by Bernt Notke in St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Lübeck (destroyed during the Allied bombing of Lübeck in World War II), presented the dead dancers as very lively and agile, making the impression that they were actually dancing, whereas their living dancing partners looked clumsy and passive. The apparent class distinction in almost all of these paintings is completely neutralized by Death as the ultimate equalizer, so that a sociocritical element is subtly inherent to the whole genre. The &quot;Totentanz&quot; of Metnitz, for example, shows how a pope crowned with his tiara is being led into Hell by Death.

Usually, a short dialogue is attached to each pair of dancers, in which Death is summoning him (or, more rarely, her) to dance and the summoned is moaning about impending death. In the first printed &quot;Totentanz&quot; textbook (Anon.: &quot;Vierzeiliger oberdeutscher Totentanz&quot;, Heidelberger Blockbuch, ), Death addresses, for example, the emperor:

At the lower end of the &quot;Totentanz&quot;, Death calls, for example, the peasant to dance, who answers:

==Hans Holbein&#x27;s woodcuts==

Renowned for his &quot;Dance of Death&quot; series, the famous designs by Hans Holbein the Younger (1497–1543) were drawn in 1526 while he was in Basel. They were cut in wood by the accomplished Formschneider (block cutter) Hans Lützelburger.

William Ivins (quoting W. J. Linton) writes of Lützelburger&#x27;s work wrote:

&quot;&quot;Nothing indeed, by knife or by graver, is of higher quality than this man&#x27;s doing.&#x27; For by common acclaim the originals are technically the most marvelous woodcuts ever made&quot;.&quot; 

These woodcuts soon appeared in proofs with titles in German. The first book edition, titled &quot;Les Simulachres et Historiées Faces de la Mort&quot; and containing forty-one woodcuts, was published at Lyons by the Treschsel brothers in 1538. The popularity of the work, and the currency of its message, are underscored by the fact that there were eleven editions before 1562, and over the sixteenth century perhaps as many as a hundred unauthorized editions and imitations. Ten further designs were added in later editions.

The &quot;Dance of Death&quot; (1523–26) refashions the late-medieval allegory of the &quot;Danse Macabre&quot; as a reformist satire, and one can see the beginnings of a gradual shift from traditional to reformed Christianity. That shift had many permutations however, and in a study Natalie Zemon Davis has shown that the contemporary reception and afterlife of Holbein&#x27;s designs lent themselves to neither purely Catholic or Protestant doctrine, but could be outfitted with different surrounding prefaces and sermons as printers and writers of different political and religious leanings took them up. Most importantly, &quot;The pictures and the Bible quotations above them were the main attractions […] Both Catholics and Protestants wished, through the pictures, to turn men&#x27;s thoughts to a Christian preparation for death.&quot;.

The 1538 edition which contained Latin quotations from the Bible above Holbein&#x27;s designs, and a French quatrain below composed by Gilles Corrozet (1510–1568) actually did not credit Holbein as the artist. It bore the title: Les simulachres &amp; / HISTORIEES FACES / DE LA MORT, AUTANT ELE/gammēt pourtraictes, que artifi/ciellement imaginées. / A Lyon. / Soubz l&#x27;escu de COLOIGNE. / M.D. XXXVIII. (&quot;Images and Illustrated facets of Death, as elegantly depicted as they are artfully conceived.&quot;) These images and workings of death as captured in the phrase &quot;histories faces&quot; of the title &quot;are the particular exemplification of the way death works, the individual scenes in which the lessons of mortality are brought home to people of every station.&quot;

In his preface to the work Jean de Vauzèle, the Prior of Montrosier, addresses Jehanne de Tourzelle, the Abbess of the Convent at St. Peter at Lyons, and names Holbein&#x27;s attempts to capture the ever-present, but never directly seen, abstract images of death &quot;simulachres.&quot; He writes: &quot;[…] simulachres les dis ie vrayement, pour ce que simulachre vient de simuler, &amp; faindre ce que n&#x27;est point.&quot; (&quot;Simulachres they are most correctly called, for simulachre derives from the verb to simulate and to feign that which is not really there.&quot;) He next employs a trope from the memento mori (remember we all must die) tradition and a metaphor from printing which well captures the undertakings of Death, the artist, and the printed book before us in which these simulachres of death barge in on the living: &quot;Et pourtant qu&#x27;on n&#x27;a peu trouver chose plus approchante a la similitude de Mort, que la personne morte, on d&#x27;icelle effigie simulachres, &amp; faces de Mort, pour en nos pensees imprimer la memoire de Mort plus au vis, que ne pourroient toutes les rhetoriques descriptiones de orateurs.&quot; (&quot;And yet we cannot discover any one thing more near the likeness of Death than the dead themselves, whence come these simulated effigies and images of Death&#x27;s affairs, which imprint the memory of Death with more force than all the rhetorical descriptions of the orators ever could.&quot;).

Holbein&#x27;s series shows the figure of &quot;Death&quot; in many disguises, confronting individuals from all walks of life. None escape Death&#x27;s skeletal clutches, not even the pious. As Davis writes, &quot;Holbein&#x27;s pictures are independent dramas in which Death comes upon his victim in the midst of the latter&#x27;s own surroundings and activities. This is perhaps nowhere more strikingly captured than in the wonderful blocks showing the plowman earning his bread by the sweat of his brow only to have his horses speed him to his end by Death. The Latin from the 1549 Italian edition pictured here reads: &quot;In sudore vultus tui, vesceris pane tuo.&quot; (&quot;Through the sweat of thy brow you shall eat your bread&quot;), quoting Genesis 3.19. The Italian verses below translate: (&quot;Miserable in the sweat of your brow,/ It is necessary that you acquire the bread you need eat,/ But, may it not displease you to come with me,/ If you are desirous of rest.&quot;). Or there is the nice balance in composition Holbein achieves between the heavy-laden traveling salesman insisting that he must still go to market while Death tugs at his sleeve to put down his wares once and for all: &quot;Venite ad me, qui onerati estis.&quot; (&quot;Come to me, all ye who [labour and] are heavy laden&quot;), quoting Matthew 11.28. The Italian here translates: &quot;Come with me, wretch, who are weighed down / Since I am the dame who rules the whole world:/ Come and hear my advice / Because I wish to lighten you of this load.&quot;

==Textual examples of the Danse Macabre==
The &quot;Danse Macabre&quot; was a frequent motif in poetry, drama and other written literature in the Middle Ages in several areas of western Europe. There is a Spanish , a French , and a German with various Latin manuscripts written during the 14th century. Printed editions of books began appearing in the 15th century, such as the ones produced by Guy Marchant of Paris. Similarly to the musical or artistic representations, the texts describe living and dead persons being called to dance or form a procession with Death.

&quot;Danse Macabre&quot; texts were often, though not always, illustrated with illuminations and woodcuts.

There is one danse macabre text devoted entirely to women: &quot;The Danse Macabre of Women&quot;. This work survives in five manuscripts, and two printed editions. In it, 36 women of various ages, in Paris, are called from their daily lives and occupations to join the Dance with Death. An English translation of the French manuscript was published by Ann Tukey Harrison in 1994.

John Lydgate&#x27;s &quot;Dance of Death&quot; is a Middle English poem written in the early 15th century. It is a translation of a French poem of the same name, and it is one of the most popular examples of the Danse Macabre genre.

The poem is a moral allegory in which Death leads a procession of people from all walks of life to their graves. The poem includes a variety of characters, including the emperor, the pope, the cardinal, the bishop, the abbot, the prioress, the monk, the nun, the doctor, the lawyer, the merchant, the knight, the plowman, the beggar, and the child.
The poem is written in rhyme royal, a seven-line stanzaic form that was popular in the Middle Ages.

<text>David Abercromby was a 17th-century Scottish physician and writer, thought to have died in 1702. Brought up at Douai as a Roman Catholic by Jesuit priests, he was converted to Protestantism in 1682 and came to abjure popery, and published &quot;Protestancy proved Safer than Popery&quot; (1686).

==Works==

His medical reputation was based on his &quot;Tuta ac efficax luis venereae saepe absque mercurio ac semper absque salivatione mercuriali curando methodus&quot; (1684) which was translated into French, Dutch and German. Two other works by him were &quot;De Pulsus Variatione&quot; (1685), and &quot;Ars explorandi medicas facultates plantarum ex solo sapore&quot; (1688); his &quot;Opuscula&quot; were collected in 1687. These professional writings gave him a place and memorial in Albrecht von Haller, &quot;Bibliotheca Medicinae Practicae&quot; (1779). According to Haller he was alive early in the 18th century.

He also wrote some books in theology and philosophy, controversial in their time but little remembered today. But the most noticeable of his productions is &quot;A Discourse of Wit&quot; (1685), which contains some of the most characteristic metaphysical opinions of the Scottish philosophy of common sense. It was followed by &quot;Academia Scientiarum&quot; (1687), and by &quot;A Moral Discourse of the Power of Interest&quot; (1690), dedicated to Robert Boyle, Abercromby&#x27;s patron in the 1680s. He later wrote &quot;Reasons Why A Protestant Should not Turn Papist&quot; (1687), which has often wrongly been attributed to Boyle. &quot;A Short Account of Scots Divines&quot;, by him, was printed at Edinburgh in 1833, edited by James Maidment.

<doc id="8886" wikidata="Q180348" url="?curid=8886" title="Deconstruction">
<text>In philosophy, deconstruction is a loosely-defined set of approaches to understanding the relationship between text and meaning. The concept of deconstruction was introduced by the philosopher Jacques Derrida, who described it as a turn away from Platonism&#x27;s ideas of &quot;true&quot; forms and essences which are valued above appearances. 

Since the 1980s, these proposals of language&#x27;s fluidity instead of being ideally static and discernible have inspired a range of studies in the humanities, including the disciplines of law, anthropology, historiography, linguistics, sociolinguistics, psychoanalysis, LGBT studies, and feminism. Deconstruction also inspired deconstructivism in architecture and remains important within art, music, and literary criticism.

==Overview==
Jacques Derrida&#x27;s 1967 book &quot;Of Grammatology&quot; introduced the majority of ideas influential within deconstruction. Derrida published a number of other works directly relevant to the concept of deconstruction, such as &quot;Différance&quot;, &quot;Speech and Phenomena&quot;, and &quot;Writing and Difference&quot;.

To Derrida,
According to Derrida, and taking inspiration from the work of Ferdinand de Saussure, language as a system of signs and words only has meaning because of the contrast between these signs. As Richard Rorty contends, &quot;words have meaning only because of contrast-effects with other words ... no word can acquire meaning in the way in which philosophers from Aristotle to Bertrand Russell have hoped it might—by being the unmediated expression of something non-linguistic (e.g., an emotion, a sensed observation, a physical object, an idea, a Platonic Form)&quot;. As a consequence, meaning is never present, but rather is deferred to other signs. Derrida refers to the—in his view, mistaken—belief that there is a self-sufficient, non-deferred meaning as metaphysics of presence. Rather, according to Derrida, a concept must be understood in the context of its opposite: for example, the word &quot;being&quot; does not have meaning without contrast with the word &quot;nothing&quot;.

Further, Derrida contends that &quot;in a classical philosophical opposition we are not dealing with the peaceful coexistence of a , but rather with a violent hierarchy. One of the two terms governs the other (axiologically, logically, etc.), or has the upper hand&quot;: signified over signifier; intelligible over sensible; speech over writing; activity over passivity, etc. The first task of deconstruction is, according to Derrida, to find and overturn these oppositions inside a text or texts; but the final objective of deconstruction is not to surpass all oppositions, because it is assumed they are structurally necessary to produce sense: the oppositions simply cannot be suspended once and for all, as the hierarchy of dual oppositions always reestablishes itself (because it is necessary for meaning). Deconstruction, Derrida says, only points to the necessity of an unending analysis that can make explicit the decisions and hierarchies intrinsic to all texts.

Derrida further argues that it is not enough to expose and deconstruct the way oppositions work and then stop there in a nihilistic or cynical position, &quot;thereby preventing any means of intervening in the field effectively&quot;. To be effective, deconstruction needs to create new terms, not to synthesize the concepts in opposition, but to mark their difference and eternal interplay. This explains why Derrida always proposes new terms in his deconstruction, not as a free play but from the necessity of analysis. Derrida called these undecidables—that is, unities of simulacrum—&quot;false&quot; verbal properties (nominal or semantic) that can no longer be included within philosophical (binary) opposition. Instead, they inhabit philosophical oppositions—resisting and organizing them—without ever constituting a third term or leaving room for a solution in the form of a Hegelian dialectic (e.g., , archi-writing, pharmakon, supplement, hymen, gram, spacing).

==Influences==
Derrida&#x27;s theories on deconstruction were themselves influenced by the work of linguists such as Ferdinand de Saussure (whose writings on semiotics also became a cornerstone of structuralism in the mid-20th century) and literary theorists such as Roland Barthes (whose works were an investigation of the logical ends of structuralist thought). Derrida&#x27;s views on deconstruction stood in opposition to the theories of structuralists such as psychoanalytic theorist Jacques Lacan, and anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss. However, Derrida resisted attempts to label his work as &quot;post-structuralist&quot;.

===Influence of Nietzsche===

Derrida&#x27;s motivation for developing deconstructive criticism, suggesting the fluidity of language over static forms, was largely inspired by Friedrich Nietzsche&#x27;s philosophy, beginning with his interpretation of Trophonius. In &quot;Daybreak&quot;, Nietzsche announces that &quot;All things that live long are gradually so saturated with reason that their origin in unreason thereby becomes improbable. Does not almost every precise history of an origination impress our feelings as paradoxical and wantonly offensive? Does the good historian not, at bottom, constantly contradict?&quot;.

Nietzsche&#x27;s point in &quot;Daybreak&quot; is that standing at the end of modern history, modern thinkers know too much to continue to be deceived by an illusory grasp of satisfactorily complete reason. Mere proposals of heightened reasoning, logic, philosophizing and science are no longer solely sufficient as the royal roads to truth. Nietzsche disregards Platonism to revisualize the history of the West as the self-perpetuating history of a series of political moves, that is, a manifestation of the will to power, that at bottom have no greater or lesser claim to truth in any noumenal (absolute) sense. By calling attention to the fact that he has assumed the role of a subterranean Trophonius, in dialectical opposition to Plato, Nietzsche hopes to sensitize readers to the political and cultural context, and the political influences that impact authorship.

Where Nietzsche did not achieve deconstruction, as Derrida sees it, is that he missed the opportunity to further explore the will to power as more than a manifestation of the sociopolitically effective operation of writing that Plato characterized, stepping beyond Nietzsche&#x27;s penultimate revaluation of all Western values, to the ultimate, which is the emphasis on &quot;the role of writing in the production of knowledge&quot;.

===Influence of Saussure===
Derrida approaches all texts as constructed around elemental oppositions which all discourse has to articulate if it intends to make any sense whatsoever. This is so because identity is viewed in non-essentialist terms as a construct, and because constructs only produce meaning through the interplay of difference inside a &quot;system of distinct signs&quot;. This approach to text is influenced by the semiology of Ferdinand de Saussure.

Saussure is considered one of the fathers of structuralism when he explained that terms get their meaning in reciprocal determination with other terms inside language:

In language there are only differences. Even more important: a difference generally implies positive terms between which the difference is set up; but in language there are only differences without positive terms. Whether we take the signified or the signifier, language has neither ideas nor sounds that existed before the linguistic system, but only conceptual and phonic differences that have issued from the system. The idea or phonic substance that a sign contains is of less importance than the other signs that surround it. [...] A linguistic system is a series of differences of sound combined with a series of differences of ideas; but the pairing of a certain number of acoustical signs with as many cuts made from the mass thought engenders a system of values.

Saussure explicitly suggested that linguistics was only a branch of a more general semiology, a science of signs in general, human codes being only one part. Nevertheless, in the end, as Derrida pointed out, Saussure made linguistics &quot;the regulatory model&quot;, and &quot;for essential, and essentially metaphysical, reasons had to privilege speech, and everything that links the sign to phone&quot;. Derrida will prefer to follow the more &quot;fruitful paths (formalization)&quot; of a general semiotics without falling into what he considered &quot;a hierarchizing teleology&quot; privileging linguistics, and to speak of &quot;mark&quot; rather than of language, not as something restricted to mankind, but as prelinguistic, as the pure possibility of language, working everywhere there is a relation to something else.

==Deconstruction according to Derrida==
===Etymology===
Derrida&#x27;s original use of the word &quot;deconstruction&quot; was a translation of &quot;Destruktion&quot;, a concept from the work of Martin Heidegger that Derrida sought to apply to textual reading. Heidegger&#x27;s term referred to a process of exploring the categories and concepts that tradition has imposed on a word, and the history behind them.

===Basic philosophical concerns===
Derrida&#x27;s concerns flow from a consideration of several issues:

* A desire to contribute to the re-evaluation of all Western values, a re-evaluation built on the 18th-century Kantian critique of pure reason, and carried forward to the 19th century, in its more radical implications, by Kierkegaard and Nietzsche.
* An assertion that texts outlive their authors, and become part of a set of cultural habits equal to, if not surpassing, the importance of authorial intent.
* A re-valuation of certain classic western dialectics: poetry vs. philosophy, reason vs. revelation, structure vs. creativity, episteme vs. techne, etc.

To this end, Derrida follows a long line of modern philosophers, who look backwards to Plato and his influence on the Western metaphysical tradition. Like Nietzsche, Derrida suspects Plato of dissimulation in the service of a political project, namely the education, through critical reflections, of a class of citizens more strategically positioned to influence the polis. However, unlike Nietzsche, Derrida is not satisfied with such a merely political interpretation of Plato, because of the particular dilemma in which modern humans find themselves. His Platonic reflections are inseparably part of his critique of modernity, hence his attempt to be something beyond the modern, because of his Nietzschean sense that the modern has lost its way and become mired in nihilism.

 is the observation that the meanings of words come from their synchrony with other words within the language and their diachrony between contemporary and historical definitions of a word. Understanding language, according to Derrida, requires an understanding of both viewpoints of linguistic analysis. The focus on diachrony has led to accusations against Derrida of engaging in the etymological fallacy.

There is one statement by Derrida—in an essay on Rousseau in &quot;Of Grammatology&quot;—which has been of great interest to his opponents. It is the assertion that &quot;there is no outside-text&quot; (), which is often mistranslated as &quot;there is nothing outside of the text&quot;. The mistranslation is often used to suggest Derrida believes that nothing exists but words. Michel Foucault, for instance, famously misattributed to Derrida the very different phrase for this purpose. According to Derrida, his statement simply refers to the unavoidability of context that is at the heart of .

For example, the word &quot;house&quot; derives its meaning more as a function of how it differs from &quot;shed&quot;, &quot;mansion&quot;, &quot;hotel&quot;, &quot;building&quot;, etc. (form of content, which Louis Hjelmslev distinguished from form of expression) than how the word &quot;house&quot; may be tied to a certain image of a traditional house (i.e., the relationship between signified and signifier), with each term being established in reciprocal determination with the other terms than by an ostensive description or definition: when can one talk about a &quot;house&quot; or a &quot;mansion&quot; or a &quot;shed&quot;? The same can be said about verbs in all languages: when should one stop saying &quot;walk&quot; and start saying &quot;run&quot;? The same happens, of course, with adjectives: when must one stop saying &quot;yellow&quot; and start saying &quot;orange&quot;, or exchange &quot;past&quot; for &quot;present&quot;? Not only are the topological differences between the words relevant here, but the differentials between what is signified is also covered by .

Thus, complete meaning is always &quot;differential&quot; and &quot;postponed&quot; in language; there is never a moment when meaning is complete and total. A simple example would consist of looking up a given word in a dictionary, then proceeding to look up the words found in that word&#x27;s definition, etc., also comparing with older dictionaries. Such a process would never end.

===Metaphysics of presence===

Derrida describes the task of deconstruction as the identification of metaphysics of presence, or &quot;logocentrism&quot; in western philosophy. Metaphysics of presence is the desire for immediate access to meaning, the privileging of presence over absence. This means that there is an assumed bias in certain binary oppositions where one side is placed in a position over another, such as good over bad, speech over the written word, male over female. Derrida writes,

To Derrida, the central bias of logocentrism was the now being placed as more important than the future or past. This argument is largely based on the earlier work of Heidegger, who, in &quot;Being and Time&quot;, claimed that the theoretical attitude of pure presence is parasitical upon a more involvement with the world in concepts such as ready-to-hand and being-with.

===Deconstruction and dialectics===
In the deconstruction procedure, one of the main concerns of Derrida is to not collapse into Hegel&#x27;s dialectic, where these oppositions would be reduced to contradictions in a dialectic that has the purpose of resolving it into a synthesis. The presence of Hegelian dialectics was enormous in the intellectual life of France during the second half of the 20th century, with the influence of Kojève and Hyppolite, but also with the impact of dialectics based on contradiction developed by Marxists, and including the existentialism of Sartre, etc. This explains Derrida&#x27;s concern to always distinguish his procedure from Hegel&#x27;s, since Hegelianism believes binary oppositions would produce a synthesis, while Derrida saw binary oppositions as incapable of collapsing into a synthesis free from the original contradiction.

==Difficulty of definition==
There have been problems defining deconstruction. Derrida claimed that all of his essays were attempts to define what deconstruction is, and that deconstruction is necessarily complicated and difficult to explain since it actively criticises the very language needed to explain it.

===Derrida&#x27;s &quot;negative&quot; descriptions===
Derrida has been more forthcoming with negative () than with positive descriptions of deconstruction. When asked by Toshihiko Izutsu some preliminary considerations on how to translate &quot;deconstruction&quot; in Japanese, in order to at least prevent using a Japanese term contrary to &quot;deconstruction&quot;&#x27;s actual meaning, Derrida began his response by saying that such a question amounts to &quot;what deconstruction is not, or rather &quot;ought&quot; not to be&quot;.

Derrida states that deconstruction is not an analysis, a critique, or a method in the traditional sense that philosophy understands these terms. In these negative descriptions of deconstruction, Derrida is seeking to &quot;multiply the cautionary indicators and put aside all the traditional philosophical concepts&quot;. This does not mean that deconstruction has absolutely nothing in common with an analysis, a critique, or a method, because while Derrida distances deconstruction from these terms, he reaffirms &quot;the necessity of returning to them, at least under erasure&quot;. Derrida&#x27;s necessity of returning to a term under erasure means that even though these terms are problematic, they must be used until they can be effectively reformulated or replaced. The relevance of the tradition of negative theology to Derrida&#x27;s preference for negative descriptions of deconstruction is the notion that a positive description of deconstruction would over-determine the idea of deconstruction and would close off the openness that Derrida wishes to preserve for deconstruction. If Derrida were to positively define deconstruction—as, for example, a critique—then this would make the concept of critique immune to itself being deconstructed. Some new philosophy beyond deconstruction would then be required in order to encompass the notion of critique.

====Not a method====
Derrida states that &quot;Deconstruction is not a method, and cannot be transformed into one&quot;. This is because deconstruction is not a mechanical operation. Derrida warns against considering deconstruction as a mechanical operation, when he states that &quot;It is true that in certain circles (university or cultural, especially in the United States) the technical and methodological &quot;metaphor&quot; that seems necessarily attached to the very word &#x27;deconstruction&#x27; has been able to seduce or lead astray&quot;. Commentator Richard Beardsworth explains that:

Derrida is careful to avoid this term [method] because it carries connotations of a procedural form of judgement. A thinker with a method has already decided &quot;how&quot; to proceed, is unable to give him or herself up to the matter of thought in hand, is a functionary of the criteria which structure his or her conceptual gestures. For Derrida [...] this is irresponsibility itself. Thus, to talk of a method in relation to deconstruction, especially regarding its ethico-political implications, would appear to go directly against the current of Derrida&#x27;s philosophical adventure.

Beardsworth here explains that it would be irresponsible to undertake a deconstruction with a complete set of rules that need only be applied as a method to the object of deconstruction, because this understanding would reduce deconstruction to a thesis of the reader that the text is then made to fit. This would be an irresponsible act of reading, because it becomes a prejudicial procedure that only finds what it sets out to find.

====Not a critique====
Derrida states that deconstruction is not a critique in the Kantian sense. This is because Kant defines the term &quot;critique&quot; as the opposite of dogmatism. For Derrida, it is not possible to escape the dogmatic baggage of the language used in order to perform a pure critique in the Kantian sense. Language is dogmatic because it is inescapably metaphysical. Derrida argues that language is inescapably metaphysical because it is made up of signifiers that only refer to that which transcends them—the signified. In addition, Derrida asks rhetorically &quot;Is not the idea of knowledge and of the acquisition of knowledge in itself metaphysical?&quot; By this, Derrida means that all claims to know something necessarily involve an assertion of the metaphysical type that something &quot;is&quot; the case somewhere. For Derrida the concept of neutrality is suspect and dogmatism is therefore involved in everything to a certain degree. Deconstruction can challenge a particular dogmatism and hence de-sediment dogmatism in general, but it cannot escape all dogmatism all at once.

====Not an analysis====
Derrida states that deconstruction is not an analysis in the traditional sense. This is because the possibility of analysis is predicated on the possibility of breaking up the text being analysed into elemental component parts. Derrida argues that there are no self-sufficient units of meaning in a text, because individual words or sentences in a text can only be properly understood in terms of how they fit into the larger structure of the text and language itself. For more on Derrida&#x27;s theory of meaning see the article on .

====Not post-structuralist====
Derrida states that his use of the word deconstruction first took place in a context in which &quot;structuralism was dominant&quot; and deconstruction&#x27;s meaning is within this context. Derrida states that deconstruction is an &quot;antistructuralist gesture&quot; because &quot;[s]tructures were to be undone, decomposed, desedimented&quot;. At the same time, deconstruction is also a &quot;structuralist gesture&quot; because it is concerned with the structure of texts. So, deconstruction involves &quot;a certain attention to structures&quot; and tries to &quot;understand how an &#x27;ensemble&#x27; was constituted&quot;. As both a structuralist and an antistructuralist gesture, deconstruction is tied up with what Derrida calls the &quot;structural problematic&quot;. The structural problematic for Derrida is the tension between genesis, that which is &quot;in the essential mode of creation or movement&quot;, and structure: &quot;systems, or complexes, or static configurations&quot;. An example of genesis would be the sensory ideas from which knowledge is then derived in the empirical epistemology. An example of structure would be a binary opposition such as good and evil where the meaning of each element is established, at least partly, through its relationship to the other element.

It is for this reason that Derrida distances his use of the term deconstruction from post-structuralism, a term that would suggest that philosophy could simply go beyond structuralism. Derrida states that &quot;the motif of deconstruction has been associated with &#x27;post-structuralism, but that this term was &quot;a word unknown in France until its &#x27;return&#x27; from the United States&quot;. In his deconstruction of Edmund Husserl, Derrida actually argues the contamination of pure origins by the structures of language and temporality. Manfred Frank has even referred to Derrida&#x27;s work as &quot;neostructuralism&quot;, identifying a &quot;distaste for the metaphysical concepts of domination and system&quot;.

===Alternative definitions===
The popularity of the term deconstruction, combined with the technical difficulty of Derrida&#x27;s primary material on deconstruction and his reluctance to elaborate his understanding of the term, has meant that many secondary sources have attempted to give a more straightforward explanation than Derrida himself ever attempted. Secondary definitions are therefore an interpretation of deconstruction by the person offering them rather than a summary of Derrida&#x27;s actual position.
* Paul de Man was a member of the Yale School and a prominent practitioner of deconstruction as he understood it. His definition of deconstruction is that, &quot;[i]t&#x27;s possible, within text, to frame a question or undo assertions made in the text, by means of elements which are in the text, which frequently would be precisely structures that play off the rhetorical against grammatical elements.&quot;
* Richard Rorty was a prominent interpreter of Derrida&#x27;s philosophy. His definition of deconstruction is that, &quot;the term &#x27;deconstruction&#x27; refers in the first instance to the way in which the &#x27;accidental&#x27; features of a text can be seen as betraying, subverting, its purportedly &#x27;essential&#x27; message.&quot;
* According to John D. Caputo, the very meaning and mission of deconstruction is:&quot;to show that things - texts, institutions, traditions, societies, beliefs, and practices of whatever size and sort you need - do not have definable meanings and determinable missions, that they are always more than any mission would impose, that they exceed the boundaries they currently occupy&quot;
* Niall Lucy points to the impossibility of defining the term at all, stating: &quot;While in a sense it &quot;is&quot; impossibly difficult to define, the impossibility has less to do with the adoption of a position or the assertion of a choice on deconstruction&#x27;s part than with the impossibility of every &#x27;is&#x27; as such. Deconstruction begins, as it were, from a refusal of the authority or determining power of every &#x27;is&#x27;, or simply from a refusal of authority in general. While such refusal may indeed count as a position, it is not the case that deconstruction holds this as a sort of &#x27;preference&#x27; &quot;.
* David B. Allison, an early translator of Derrida, states in the introduction to his translation of &quot;Speech and Phenomena&quot;: [Deconstruction] signifies a project of critical thought whose task is to locate and &#x27;take apart&#x27; those concepts which serve as the axioms or rules for a period of thought, those concepts which command the unfolding of an entire epoch of metaphysics. &#x27;Deconstruction&#x27; is somewhat less negative than the Heideggerian or Nietzschean terms &#x27;destruction&#x27; or &#x27;reversal&#x27;; it suggests that certain foundational concepts of metaphysics will never be entirely eliminated...There is no simple &#x27;overcoming&#x27; of metaphysics or the language of metaphysics.
* Paul Ricœur defines deconstruction as a way of uncovering the questions behind the answers of a text or tradition.

===Popular definitions===
A survey of the secondary literature reveals a wide range of heterogeneous arguments. Particularly problematic are the attempts to give neat introductions to deconstruction by people trained in literary criticism who sometimes have little or no expertise in the relevant areas of philosophy in which Derrida is working. These secondary works (e.g. &quot;Deconstruction for Beginners&quot; and &quot;Deconstructions: A User&#x27;s Guide&quot;) have attempted to explain deconstruction while being academically criticized for being too far removed from the original texts and Derrida&#x27;s actual position.

&quot;Cambridge Dictionary&quot; states that &quot;deconstruction&quot; is &quot;the act of breaking something down into its separate parts in order to understand its meaning, especially when this is different from how it was previously understood&quot;. The Merriam-Webster dictionary states that &quot;deconstruction&quot; is &quot;the analytic examination of something (such as a theory) often in order to reveal its inadequacy&quot;.

==Application==
Derrida&#x27;s observations have greatly influenced literary criticism and post-structuralism.

===Literary criticism===
Derrida&#x27;s method consisted of demonstrating all the forms and varieties of the originary complexity of semiotics, and their multiple consequences in many fields. His way of achieving this was by conducting readings of philosophical and literary texts, with the goal to understand what in those texts runs counter to their apparent systematicity (structural unity) or intended sense (authorial genesis). By demonstrating the aporias and ellipses of thought, Derrida hoped to show the infinitely subtle ways that this originary complexity, which by definition cannot ever be completely known, works its structuring and destructuring effects.

Deconstruction denotes the pursuing of the meaning of a text to the point of exposing the supposed contradictions and internal oppositions upon which it is founded—supposedly showing that those foundations are irreducibly complex, unstable, or impossible. It is an approach that may be deployed in philosophy, in literary analysis, and even in the analysis of scientific writings. Deconstruction generally tries to demonstrate that any text is not a discrete whole but contains several irreconcilable and contradictory meanings; that any text therefore has more than one interpretation; that the text itself links these interpretations inextricably; that the incompatibility of these interpretations is irreducible; and thus that an interpretative reading cannot go beyond a certain point. Derrida refers to this point as an &quot;aporia&quot; in the text; thus, deconstructive reading is termed &quot;aporetic&quot;. He insists that meaning is made possible by the relations of a word to other words within the network of structures that language is.

Derrida initially resisted granting to his approach the overarching name &quot;deconstruction&quot;, on the grounds that it was a precise technical term that could not be used to characterize his work generally. Nevertheless, he eventually accepted that the term had come into common use to refer to his textual approach, and Derrida himself increasingly began to use the term in this more general way.

Derrida&#x27;s deconstruction strategy is also used by postmodernists to locate meaning in a text rather than discover meaning due to the position that it has multiple readings. There is a focus on the deconstruction that denotes the tearing apart of a text to find arbitrary hierarchies and presuppositions for the purpose of tracing contradictions that shadow a text&#x27;s coherence. Here, the meaning of a text does not reside with the author or the author&#x27;s intentions because it is dependent on the interaction between reader and text. Even the process of translation is also seen as transformative since it &quot;modifies the original even as it modifies the translating language&quot;.

===Critique of structuralism===
Derrida&#x27;s lecture at Johns Hopkins University, &quot;Structure, Sign, and Play in the Human Sciences&quot;, often appears in collections as a manifesto against structuralism. Derrida&#x27;s essay was one of the earliest to propose some theoretical limitations to structuralism, and to attempt to theorize on terms that were clearly no longer structuralist. Structuralism viewed language as a number of signs, composed of a signified (the meaning) and a signifier (the word itself). Derrida proposed that signs always referred to other signs, existing only in relation to each other, and there was therefore no ultimate foundation or centre. This is the basis of .

==Development after Derrida==
===The Yale School===

Between the late 1960s and the early 1980s, many thinkers were influenced by deconstruction, including Paul de Man, Geoffrey Hartman, and J. Hillis Miller. This group came to be known as the Yale school and was especially influential in literary criticism. Derrida and Hillis Miller were subsequently affiliated with the University of California, Irvine.

Miller has described deconstruction this way: &quot;Deconstruction is not a dismantling of the structure of a text, but a demonstration that it has already dismantled itself. Its apparently solid ground is no rock, but thin air.&quot;

===Critical legal studies movement===

Arguing that law and politics cannot be separated, the founders of the Critical Legal Studies movement found it necessary to criticize the absence of the recognition of this inseparability at the level of theory. To demonstrate the indeterminacy of legal doctrine, these scholars often adopt a method, such as structuralism in linguistics, or deconstruction in Continental philosophy, to make explicit the deep structure of categories and tensions at work in legal texts and talk. The aim was to deconstruct the tensions and procedures by which they are constructed, expressed, and deployed.

For example, Duncan Kennedy, in explicit reference to semiotics and deconstruction procedures, maintains that various legal doctrines are constructed around the binary pairs of opposed concepts, each of which has a claim upon intuitive and formal forms of reasoning that must be made explicit in their meaning and relative value, and criticized. Self and other, private and public, subjective and objective, freedom and control are examples of such pairs demonstrating the influence of opposing concepts on the development of legal doctrines throughout history.

===&quot;Deconstructing History&quot;===
Deconstructive readings of history and sources have changed the entire discipline of history. In &quot;Deconstructing History&quot;, Alun Munslow examines history in what he argues is a postmodern age. He provides an introduction to the debates and issues of postmodernist history. He also surveys the latest research into the relationship between the past, history, and historical practice, as well as articulating his own theoretical challenges.

===&quot;The Inoperative Community&quot;===
Jean-Luc Nancy argues, in his 1982 book &quot;The Inoperative Community&quot;, for an understanding of community and society that is undeconstructable because it is prior to conceptualisation. Nancy&#x27;s work is an important development of deconstruction because it takes the challenge of deconstruction seriously and attempts to develop an understanding of political terms that is undeconstructable and therefore suitable for a philosophy after Derrida. Nancy&#x27;s work produced a critique of deconstruction by making the possibility for a relation to the other. This relation to the other is called “anastasis” in Nancy&#x27;s work.

===&quot;The Ethics of Deconstruction&quot;===
Simon Critchley argues, in his 1992 book &quot;The Ethics of Deconstruction&quot;, that Derrida&#x27;s deconstruction is an intrinsically ethical practice. Critchley argues that deconstruction involves an openness to the Other that makes it ethical in the Levinasian understanding of the term.

===&quot;Derrida and the Political&quot;===

Jacques Derrida has had a great influence on contemporary political theory and political philosophy. Derrida&#x27;s thinking has inspired Slavoj Zizek, Richard Rorty, Ernesto Laclau, Judith Butler and many more contemporary theorists who have developed a deconstructive approach to politics. Because deconstruction examines the internal logic of any given text or discourse it has helped many authors to analyse the contradictions inherent in all schools of thought; and, as such, it has proved revolutionary in political analysis, particularly ideology critiques.

Richard Beardsworth, developing from Critchley&#x27;s &quot;Ethics of Deconstruction&quot;, argues, in his 1996 &quot;Derrida and the Political&quot;, that deconstruction is an intrinsically political practice. He further argues that the future of deconstruction faces a perhaps undecidable choice between a theological approach and a technological approach, represented first of all by the work of Bernard Stiegler.

===Faith===

The term &quot;deconstructing faith&quot; has been used to describe processes of critically examining one&#x27;s religious beliefs with the possibility of rejecting them, taking individual responsibility for beliefs acquired from others, or reconstructing more nuanced or mature faith. This use of the term has been particularly prominent in American Evangelical Christianity in the 2020s. Author David Hayward said he &quot;co-opted the term&quot; &quot;deconstruction&quot; because he was reading the work of Derrida at the time his religious beliefs came into question. Others had earlier used the term &quot;faith deconstruction&quot; to describe similar processes, and theologian James W. Fowler articulated a similar concept as part of his faith stages theory.

===Cuisine===

Leading Spanish chef Ferran Adrià coined &quot;deconstruction&quot; as a style of cuisine, which he described as drawing from the creative principles of Spanish modernists like Salvador Dalí and Antoni Gaudí to deconstruct conventional cooking techniques in the modern era. Deconstructed recipes typically preserve the core ingredients and techniques of an established dish, but prepare components of a dish separately while experimenting radically with its flavor, texture, ratios, and assembly to culminate in a stark, minimalist style of presentation with similarly minimal portion sizes.

==Criticisms==
Derrida was involved in a number of high-profile disagreements with prominent philosophers, including Michel Foucault, John Searle, Willard Van Orman Quine, Peter Kreeft, and Jürgen Habermas. Most of the criticisms of deconstruction were first articulated by these philosophers and then repeated elsewhere.

===John Searle===

In the early 1970s, Searle had a brief exchange with Jacques Derrida regarding speech-act theory. The exchange was characterized by a degree of mutual hostility between the philosophers, each of whom accused the other of having misunderstood his basic points. Searle was particularly hostile to Derrida&#x27;s deconstructionist framework and much later refused to let his response to Derrida be printed along with Derrida&#x27;s papers in the 1988 collection &quot;Limited Inc&quot;. Searle did not consider Derrida&#x27;s approach to be legitimate philosophy, or even intelligible writing, and argued that he did not want to legitimize the deconstructionist point of view by paying any attention to it. Consequently, some critics have considered the exchange to be a series of elaborate misunderstandings rather than a debate, while others have seen either Derrida or Searle gaining the upper hand.

The debate began in 1972, when, in his paper &quot;Signature Event Context&quot;, Derrida analyzed J. L. Austin&#x27;s theory of the illocutionary act. While sympathetic to Austin&#x27;s departure from a purely denotational account of language to one that includes &quot;force&quot;, Derrida was sceptical of the framework of normativity employed by Austin. Derrida argued that Austin had missed the fact that any speech event is framed by a &quot;structure of absence&quot; (the words that are left unsaid due to contextual constraints) and by &quot;iterability&quot; (the constraints on what can be said, imposed by what has been said in the past). Derrida argued that the focus on intentionality in speech-act theory was misguided because intentionality is restricted to that which is already established as a possible intention. He also took issue with the way Austin had excluded the study of fiction, non-serious, or &quot;parasitic&quot; speech, wondering whether this exclusion was because Austin had considered these speech genres as governed by different structures of meaning, or had not considered them due to a lack of interest. In his brief reply to Derrida, &quot;Reiterating the Differences: A Reply to Derrida&quot;, Searle argued that Derrida&#x27;s critique was unwarranted because it assumed that Austin&#x27;s theory attempted to give a full account of language and meaning when its aim was much narrower. Searle considered the omission of parasitic discourse forms to be justified by the narrow scope of Austin&#x27;s inquiry. Searle agreed with Derrida&#x27;s proposal that intentionality presupposes iterability, but did not apply the same concept of intentionality used by Derrida, being unable or unwilling to engage with the continental conceptual apparatus. This, in turn, caused Derrida to criticize Searle for not being sufficiently familiar with perspectives on intentionality. Some critics have suggested that Searle, by being so grounded in the analytical tradition that he was unable to engage with Derrida&#x27;s continental phenomenological tradition, was at fault for the unsuccessful nature of the exchange, however Searle also argued that Derrida&#x27;s disagreement with Austin turned on Derrida&#x27;s having misunderstood Austin&#x27;s type–token distinction and having failed to understand Austin&#x27;s concept of failure in relation to performativity.

Derrida, in his response to Searle ( in &quot;Limited Inc&quot;), ridiculed Searle&#x27;s positions. Claiming that a clear sender of Searle&#x27;s message could not be established, Derrida suggested that Searle had formed with Austin a (a &quot;limited liability company&quot;) due to the ways in which the ambiguities of authorship within Searle&#x27;s reply circumvented the very speech act of his reply. Searle did not reply. Later in 1988, Derrida tried to review his position and his critiques of Austin and Searle, reiterating that he found the constant appeal to &quot;normality&quot; in the analytical tradition to be problematic.

===Jürgen Habermas===
In &quot;The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity&quot;, Jürgen Habermas criticized what he considered Derrida&#x27;s opposition to rational discourse. Further, in an essay on religion and religious language, Habermas criticized what he saw as Derrida&#x27;s emphasis on etymology and philology (see &quot;Etymological fallacy&quot;).

===Walter A. Davis===
The American philosopher Walter A. Davis, in &quot;Inwardness and Existence: Subjectivity in/and Hegel, Heidegger, Marx and Freud&quot;, argues that both deconstruction and structuralism are prematurely arrested moments of a dialectical movement that issues from Hegelian &quot;unhappy consciousness&quot;.

===In popular media===
Popular criticism of deconstruction intensified following the Sokal affair, which many people took as an indicator of the quality of deconstruction as a whole, despite the absence of Derrida from Sokal&#x27;s follow-up book &quot;Impostures intellectuelles&quot;.

Chip Morningstar holds a view critical of deconstruction, believing it to be &quot;epistemologically challenged&quot;. He claims the humanities are subject to isolation and genetic drift due to their unaccountability to the world outside academia. During the Second International Conference on Cyberspace (Santa Cruz, California, 1991), he reportedly heckled deconstructionists off the stage. He subsequently presented his views in the article &quot;How to Deconstruct Almost Anything&quot;, where he stated, &quot;Contrary to the report given in the &#x27;Hype List&#x27; column of issue #1 of Wired (&#x27;Po-Mo Gets Tek-No&#x27;, page 87), we did not shout down the postmodernists. We made fun of them.&quot;

<doc id="8887" wikidata="Q1778193" url="?curid=8887" title="Direct product">
<text>In mathematics, a direct product of objects already known can often be defined by giving a new one. That induces a structure on the Cartesian product of the underlying sets from that of the contributing objects. More abstractly, the product in category theory is mentioned, which formalizes those notions.

Examples are the product of sets, groups (described below), rings, and other algebraic structures. The product of topological spaces is another instance.

There is also the direct sum, which in some areas used interchangeably but in others is a different concept.

== Examples ==
* If formula_1 is thought of as the set of real numbers without further structure, the direct product formula_2 is just the Cartesian product formula_3
* If formula_1 is thought of as the group of real numbers under addition, the direct product formula_5 still has formula_6 as its underlying set. The difference between this and the preceding examples is that formula_2 is now a group and so how to add their elements must also be stated. That is done by defining formula_8
* If formula_1 is thought of as the ring of real numbers, the direct product formula_5 again has formula_6 as its underlying set. The ring structure consists of addition defined by formula_12 and multiplication defined by formula_13
* Although the ring formula_1 is a field, formula_2 is not because the nonzero element formula_16 does not have a multiplicative inverse.

In a similar manner, the direct product of finitely many algebraic structures can be talked about; for example, formula_17 That relies on the direct product being associative up to isomorphism. That is, formula_18 for any algebraic structures formula_19 formula_20 and formula_21 of the same kind. The direct product is also commutative up to isomorphism; that is, formula_22 for any algebraic structures formula_23 and formula_24 of the same kind. Even the direct product of infinitely many algebraic structures can be talked about; for example, the direct product of countably many copies of formula_25 is written as formula_26

== Direct product of groups ==

In group theory, define the direct product of two groups formula_27 and formula_28 can be denoted by formula_29 For abelian groups that are written additively, it may also be called the direct sum of two groups, denoted by formula_30

It is defined as follows:
* the set of the elements of the new group is the &quot;Cartesian product&quot; of the sets of elements of formula_31 that is formula_32
* on tse elements put an operation, defined element-wise: formula_33
Note that formula_27 may be the same as formula_35

The construction gives a new group, which has a normal subgroup that is isomorphic to formula_36 (given by the elements of the form formula_37) and one that is isomorphic to formula_38 (comprising the elements formula_39).

The reverse also holds in the recognition theorem. If a group formula_40 contains two normal subgroups formula_31 such that formula_42 and the intersection of formula_43 contains only the identity, formula_40 is isomorphic to formula_29 A relaxation of those conditions by requiring only one subgroup to be normal gives the semidirect product.

For example, formula_43 are taken as two copies of the unique (up to isomorphisms) group of order 2, formula_47 say formula_48 Then, formula_49 with the operation element by element. For instance, formula_50 andformula_51

With a direct product, some natural group homomorphisms are obtained for free: the projection maps defined by
formula_52
are called the coordinate functions.

Also, every homomorphism formula_53 to the direct product is totally determined by its component functions formula_54

For any group formula_27 and any integer formula_56 repeated application of the direct product gives the group of all formula_57-tuples formula_58 (for formula_59 that is the trivial group); for example, formula_60 and formula_61

== Direct product of modules ==
The direct product for modules (not to be confused with the tensor product) is very similar to the one that is defined for groups above by using the Cartesian product with the operation of addition being componentwise, and the scalar multiplication just distributing over all the components. Starting from formula_1, Euclidean space formula_63 is gotten, the prototypical example of a real formula_57-dimensional vector space. The direct product of formula_65 and formula_63 is formula_67

A direct product for a finite index formula_68 is canonically isomorphic to the direct sum formula_69 The direct sum and the direct product are not isomorphic for infinite indices for which the elements of a direct sum are zero for all but for a finite number of entries. They are dual in the sense of category theory: the direct sum is the coproduct, and the direct product is the product.

For example, for formula_70 and formula_71 the infinite direct product and direct sum of the real numbers. Only sequences with a finite number of non-zero elements are in formula_72 For example, formula_73 is in formula_74 but formula_75 is not. Both sequences are in the direct product formula_76 in fact, formula_74 is a proper subset of formula_78 (that is, formula_79).

== Topological space direct product ==
The direct product for a collection of topological spaces formula_80 for formula_81 in formula_82 some index set, once again makes use of the Cartesian product
formula_83

Defining the topology is a little tricky. For finitely many factors, it is the obvious and natural thing to do: simply take as a basis of open sets to be the collection of all Cartesian products of open subsets from each factor:
formula_84

That topology is called the product topology. For example, by directly defining the product topology on formula_85 by the open sets of formula_1 (disjoint unions of open intervals), the basis for that topology would consist of all disjoint unions of open rectangles in the plane (as it turns out, it coincides with the usual metric topology).

The product topology for infinite products has a twist, which has to do with being able to make all the projection maps continuous and to make all functions into the product continuous if and only if all its component functions are continuous (that is, to satisfy the categorical definition of product: the morphisms here are continuous functions). The basis of open sets is taken to be the collection of all Cartesian products of open subsets from each factor, as before, with the proviso that all but finitely many of the open subsets are the entire factor:
formula_87

The more natural-sounding topology would be, in this case, to take products of infinitely many open subsets as before, which yields a somewhat interesting topology, the box topology. However, it is not too difficult to find an example of bunch of continuous component functions whose product function is not continuous (see the separate entry box topology for an example and more). The problem that makes the twist necessary is ultimately rooted in the fact that the intersection of open sets is guaranteed to be open only for finitely many sets in the definition of topology.

Products (with the product topology) are nice with respect to preserving properties of their factors; for example, the product of Hausdorff spaces is Hausdorff, the product of connected spaces is connected, and the product of compact spaces is compact. That last one, called Tychonoff&#x27;s theorem, is yet another equivalence to the axiom of choice.

For more properties and equivalent formulations, see product topology.

== Direct product of binary relations ==
On the Cartesian product of two sets with binary relations formula_88 define formula_89 as formula_90 If formula_91 are both reflexive, irreflexive, transitive, symmetric, or antisymmetric, then formula_92 will be also. Similarly, totality of formula_92 is inherited from formula_94 If the properties are combined, that also applies for being a preorder and being an equivalence relation. However, if formula_91 are connected relations, formula_92 need not be connected; for example, the direct product of formula_97 on formula_98 with itself does not relate formula_99

== Direct product in universal algebra ==
If formula_100 is a fixed signature, formula_101 is an arbitrary (possibly infinite) index set, and formula_102 is an indexed family of formula_100 algebras, the direct product formula_104 is a formula_100 algebra defined as follows:
* The universe set formula_23 of formula_107 is the Cartesian product of the universe sets formula_108 of formula_109 formally: formula_110
* For each formula_57 and each formula_57-ary operation symbol formula_113 its interpretation formula_114 in formula_107 is defined componentwise, formally. For all formula_116 and each formula_117 the formula_81th component of formula_119 is defined as formula_120 
For each formula_117 the formula_81th projection formula_123 is defined by formula_124 It is a surjective homomorphism between the formula_100 algebras formula_126

As a special case, if the index set formula_127 the direct product of two formula_100 algebras formula_129 is obtained, written as formula_130 If formula_100 contains only one binary operation formula_132 the above definition of the direct product of groups is obtained by using the notation formula_133 formula_134 Similarly, the definition of the direct product of modules is subsumed here.

== Categorical product ==

The direct product can be abstracted to an arbitrary category. In a category, given a collection of objects formula_135 indexed by a set formula_101, a product of those objects is an object formula_23 together with morphisms formula_138 for all formula_139, such that if formula_24 is any other object with morphisms formula_141 for all formula_139, there is a unique morphism formula_143 whose composition with formula_144 equals formula_145 for every formula_81. 

Such formula_23 and formula_148 do not always exist. If they exist, then formula_149 is unique up to isomorphism, and formula_23 is denoted formula_151.

In the special case of the category of groups, a product always exists. The underlying set of formula_151 is the Cartesian product of the underlying sets of the formula_108, the group operation is componentwise multiplication, and the (homo)morphism formula_138 is the projection sending each tuple to its formula_81th coordinate.

== Internal and external direct product ==
Some authors draw a distinction between an internal direct product and an external direct product. For example, if formula_23 and formula_24 are subgroups of an additive abelian group formula_36 such that formula_159 and formula_160, formula_161 and it is said that formula_36 is the &quot;internal&quot; direct product of formula_23 and formula_24. To avoid ambiguity, the set formula_165 can be referred to as the &quot;external&quot; direct product of formula_23 and formula_24.

<text>Déjà vu ( , ; &quot;already seen&quot;) is the phenomenon of feeling as though one has lived through the present situation before. It is an illusion of memory whereby—despite a strong sense of recollection—the time, place, and context of the &quot;previous&quot; experience are uncertain or impossible. Approximately two-thirds of surveyed populations report experiencing &quot;déjà vu&quot; at least one time in their lives. The phenomenon manifests occasionally as a symptom of seizure auras, and some researchers have associated chronic/frequent &quot;pathological&quot; &quot;déjà vu&quot; with neurological or psychiatric 
 illness. Experiencing &quot;déjà vu&quot; has been correlated with higher socioeconomic status, better educational attainment, and lower ages. People who travel often, frequently watch films, or frequently remember their dreams are also more likely to report experiencing &quot;déjà vu&quot; than others.

== History ==
The term was first used by Émile Boirac in 1876. Boirac was a French philosopher whose book &quot;L&#x27;avenir des sciences psychiques&quot; () included the sensation of déjà vu. Déjà vu has been presented by Émile as a reminiscence of memories, &quot;These experiments have led scientists to suspect that déjà vu is a memory phenomenon. We encounter a situation that is similar to an actual memory but we can’t fully recall that memory.&quot; This evidence, found by Émile Boirac, helps the public understand what déjà vu can entail on the average brain. It was also stated, &quot;Our brain recognizes the similarities between our current experience and one in the past ... left with a feeling of familiarity that we can&#x27;t quite place.&quot;

Throughout history, there have been many theories on what causes déjà vu.

==Medical disorders==

&quot;Déjà vu&quot; is associated with temporal lobe epilepsy. This experience is a neurological anomaly related to epileptic electrical discharge in the brain, creating a strong sensation that an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past.

Migraines with aura are also associated with &quot;déjà vu&quot;.
Early researchers tried to establish a link between &quot;déjà vu&quot; and mental disorders such as anxiety, dissociative identity disorder and schizophrenia but failed to find correlations of any diagnostic value. No special association has been found between &quot;déjà vu&quot; and schizophrenia. A 2008 study found that &quot;déjà vu&quot; experiences are unlikely to be pathological dissociative experiences.

Some research has looked into genetics when considering &quot;déjà vu&quot;. Although there is not currently a gene associated with &quot;déjà vu&quot;, the LGI1 gene on chromosome 10 is being studied for a possible link. Certain forms of the gene are associated with a mild form of epilepsy, and, though by no means a certainty, &quot;déjà vu&quot;, along with &quot;jamais vu&quot;, occurs often enough during seizures (such as simple partial seizures) that researchers have reason to suspect a link.

==Pharmacology==
Certain combinations of medical drugs have been reported to increase the chances of &quot;déjà vu&quot; occurring in the user. Taiminen and Jääskeläinen (2001) explored the case of an otherwise healthy person who started experiencing intense and recurrent sensations of &quot;déjà vu&quot; upon taking the drugs amantadine and phenylpropanolamine together to relieve flu symptoms. Because of the dopaminergic action of the drugs and previous findings from electrode stimulation of the brain (e.g. Bancaud, Brunet-Bourgin, Chauvel, &amp; Halgren, 1994), Tamminen and Jääskeläinen speculated that &quot;déjà vu&quot; occurs as a result of hyperdopaminergic action in the medial temporal areas of the brain. A similar case study by Karla, Chancellor, and Zeman (2007) suggests a link between &quot;déjà vu&quot; and the serotonergic system, after an otherwise healthy woman began experiencing similar symptoms while taking a combination of 5-hydroxytryptophan and carbidopa.

==Explanations==

=== Split perception explanation ===
Déjà vu may happen if a person experienced the current sensory experience twice successively. The first input experience is brief, degraded, occluded, or distracted. Immediately following that, the second perception might be familiar because the person naturally related it to the first input. One possibility behind this mechanism is that the first input experience involves shallow processing, which means that only some superficial physical attributes are extracted from the stimulus.

=== Memory-based explanation ===
====Implicit memory====

Research has associated &quot;déjà vu&quot; experiences with good memory functions, particularly long-term implicit memory. Recognition memory enables people to realize the event or activity that they are experiencing has happened before. When people experience déjà vu, they may have their recognition memory triggered by certain situations which they have never encountered.

The similarity between a déjà-vu-eliciting stimulus and an existing, or non-existing but different, memory trace may lead to the sensation that an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past. Thus, encountering something that evokes the implicit associations of an experience or sensation that cannot be remembered may lead to déjà vu. In an effort to reproduce the sensation experimentally, Banister and Zangwill (1941) used hypnosis to give participants posthypnotic amnesia for material they had already seen. When this was later re-encountered, the restricted activation caused thereafter by the posthypnotic amnesia resulted in three of the 10 participants reporting what the authors termed &quot;paramnesias&quot;.

Two approaches are used by researchers to study feelings of previous experience, with the process of recollection and familiarity. Recollection-based recognition refers to an ostensible realization that the current situation has occurred before. Familiarity-based recognition refers to the feeling of familiarity with the current situation without being able to identify any specific memory or previous event that could be associated with the sensation.

In 2010, O&#x27;Connor, Moulin, and Conway developed another laboratory analog of &quot;déjà vu&quot; based on two contrast groups of carefully selected participants, a group under posthypnotic amnesia condition (PHA) and a group under posthypnotic familiarity condition (PHF). The idea of PHA group was based on the work done by Banister and Zangwill (1941), and the PHF group was built on the research results of O&#x27;Connor, Moulin, and Conway (2007). They applied the same puzzle game for both groups, &quot;Railroad Rush Hour&quot;, a game in which one aims to slide a red car through the exit by rearranging and shifting other blocking trucks and cars on the road. After completing the puzzle, each participant in the PHA group received a posthypnotic amnesia suggestion to forget the game in the hypnosis. Then, each participant in the PHF group was not given the puzzle but received a posthypnotic familiarity suggestion that they would feel familiar with this game during the hypnosis. After the hypnosis, all participants were asked to play the puzzle (the second time for PHA group) and reported the feelings of playing.

In the PHA condition, if a participant reported no memory of completing the puzzle game during hypnosis, researchers scored the participant as passing the suggestion. In the PHF condition, if participants reported that the puzzle game felt familiar, researchers scored the participant as passing the suggestion. It turned out that, both in the PHA and PHF conditions, five participants passed the suggestion and one did not, which is 83.33% of the total sample. More participants in PHF group felt a strong sense of familiarity, for instance, comments like &quot;I think I have done this several years ago.&quot; Furthermore, more participants in PHF group experienced a strong &quot;déjà vu&quot;, for example, &quot;I think I have done the exact puzzle before.&quot; Three out of six participants in the PHA group felt a sense of déjà vu, and none of them experienced a strong sense of it. These figures are consistent with Banister and Zangwill&#x27;s findings. Some participants in PHA group related the familiarity when completing the puzzle with an exact event that happened before, which is more likely to be a phenomenon of source amnesia. Other participants started to realize that they may have completed the puzzle game during hypnosis, which is more akin to the phenomenon of breaching. In contrast, participants in the PHF group reported that they felt confused about the strong familiarity of this puzzle, with the feeling of playing it just sliding across their minds. Overall, the experiences of participants in the PHF group is more likely to be the &quot;déjà vu&quot; in life, while the experiences of participants in the PHA group is unlikely to be real déjà vu.

A 2012 study in the journal &quot;Consciousness and Cognition&quot;, that used virtual reality technology to study reported &quot;déjà vu&quot; experiences, supported this idea. This virtual reality investigation suggested that similarity between a new scene&#x27;s spatial layout and the layout of a previously experienced scene in memory (but which fails to be recalled) may contribute to the &quot;déjà vu&quot; experience. When the previously experienced scene fails to come to mind in response to viewing the new scene, that previously experienced scene in memory can still exert an effect—that effect may be a feeling of familiarity with the new scene that is subjectively experienced as a feeling that an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past, or of having been there before despite knowing otherwise.

In 2018 a study examined volunteers&#x27; brains under experimentally induced déjà vu through the use of fMRI brain scans. The induced &quot;deja vu&quot; state was created by getting them to look at a series of logically related and unrelated words. The researchers would then ask the participants how many words starting with a specific letter they saw. With related words such as &quot;door, shutter, screen, breeze&quot;, the participants would be asked if they saw any words that started with &quot;W&quot; (i.e. Window, a term that was not presented to the participants). If they did note that they thought they saw a word that wasn&#x27;t presented to them, then déjà vu was induced. The researchers would then examine the volunteers&#x27; brains at the moment of induced déjà vu. From these scans, they noticed that there was visible activity in regions of the brain associated with mnemonic conflict. This finding suggests that more research regarding memory conflict may be important in better understanding déjà vu.

====Cryptomnesia====

Another possible explanation for the phenomenon of &quot;déjà vu&quot; is the occurrence of cryptomnesia, which is where information learned is forgotten but nevertheless stored in the brain, and similar occurrences invoke the contained knowledge, leading to a feeling of familiarity because the event or experience being experienced has already been experienced in the past, known as &quot;déjà vu&quot;. Some experts suggest that memory is a process of reconstruction, rather than a recollection of fixed, established events. This reconstruction comes from stored components, involving emotions, distortions, and omissions. Each successive recall of an event is merely a recall of the last reconstruction. The proposed sense of recognition (déjà vu) involves achieving a good match between the present experience and the stored data. This reconstruction, however, may now differ so much from the original event it is as though it had never been experienced before, even though it seems similar.

====Dual neurological processing====
In 1965, Robert Efron of Boston&#x27;s Veterans Hospital proposed that &quot;déjà vu&quot; is caused by dual neurological processing caused by delayed signals. Efron found that the brain&#x27;s sorting of incoming signals is done in the temporal lobe of the brain&#x27;s left hemisphere. However, signals enter the temporal lobe twice before processing, once from each hemisphere of the brain, normally with a slight delay of milliseconds between them. Efron proposed that if the two signals were occasionally not synchronized properly, then they would be processed as two separate experiences, with the second seeming to be a re-living of the first.

===Dream-based explanation===
Dreams can also be used to explain the experience of déjà vu, and they are related in three different aspects. Firstly, some &quot;déjà vu&quot; experiences duplicate the situation in dreams instead of waking conditions, according to the survey done by Brown (2004). Twenty percent of the respondents reported their &quot;déjà vu&quot; experiences were from dreams and 40% of the respondents reported from both reality and dreams. Secondly, people may experience &quot;déjà vu&quot; because some elements in their remembered dreams were shown. Research done by Zuger (1966) supported this idea by investigating the relationship between remembered dreams and &quot;déjà vu&quot; experiences, and suggested that there is a strong correlation. Thirdly, people may experience &quot;déjà vu&quot; during a dream state, which links &quot;déjà vu&quot; with dream frequency. Some researchers, including Swiss scientist Arthur Funkhouser, firmly believe that precognitive dreams are the source of many déjà vu experiences. Researchers also connected evidence of precognitive dreams experiences to déjà vu experiences that occurred anywhere from one day to eight years later.

===Collective unconscious===
Collective Unconscious is a controversial theory created by Carl Jung that has been used to explain the phenomenon of &quot;déjà vu&quot;. His theory was that all people have a shared pool of knowledge that has been passed down through generations and we can unconsciously access this knowledge. Some of said knowledge would be about certain archetypes like mother, father and hero or possibly about basic situations, emotions or other patterns. If we can access shared knowledge déjà vu could potentially be an effect of recognizing one of the collectively stored patterns.

==Related terms==

===&quot;Jamais vu&quot;===
&quot;Jamais vu&quot; (from French, meaning &quot;never seen&quot;) is any familiar situation which is not recognized by the observer.

Often described as the opposite of déjà vu, &quot;jamais vu&quot; involves a sense of eeriness and the observer&#x27;s impression of seeing the situation for the first time, despite rationally knowing that they have been in the situation before. &quot;Jamais vu&quot; is most commonly experienced when a person momentarily does not recognize a word, person or place that they already know. &quot;Jamais vu&quot; is sometimes associated with certain types of aphasia, amnesia, and epilepsy.

Theoretically, a &quot;jamais vu&quot; feeling in someone with a delirious disorder or intoxication could result in a delirious explanation of it, such as in the Capgras delusion, in which the patient takes a known person for a false double or impostor. If the impostor is himself, the clinical setting would be the same as the one described as depersonalization, hence &quot;jamais vus&quot; of oneself or of the &quot;reality of reality&quot;, are termed depersonalization (or surreality) feelings.

The feeling has been evoked through semantic satiation. Chris Moulin of the University of Leeds asked 95 volunteers to write the word &quot;door&quot; 30 times in 60 seconds. Sixty-eight percent of the subjects reported symptoms of &quot;jamais vu&quot;, with some beginning to doubt that &quot;door&quot; was a real word.

=== &quot;Déjà vécu&quot; ===
&quot;Déjà vécu&quot; (from French, meaning &quot;already lived&quot;) is an intense, but false, feeling of having already lived through the present situation. Recently, it has been considered a pathological form of déjà vu. However, unlike déjà vu, &quot;déjà vécu&quot; has behavioral consequences. Patients with déjà vécu often cannot tell that this feeling of familiarity is not real. Because of the intense feeling of familiarity, patients experiencing &quot;déjà vécu&quot; may withdraw from their current events or activities. Patients may justify their feelings of familiarity with beliefs bordering on delusion.

===&quot;Presque vu&quot;===
&quot;Presque vu&quot; (, from French, meaning &quot;almost seen&quot;) is the intense feeling of being on the very brink of a powerful epiphany, insight, or revelation, without actually achieving the revelation. The feeling is often therefore associated with a frustrating, tantalizing sense of incompleteness or near-completeness.

===&quot;Déjà rêvé&quot;===

&quot;Déjà rêvé&quot; (from French, meaning &quot;already dreamed&quot;) is the feeling of having already dreamed something that is currently being experienced.

===&quot;Déjà entendu&quot;===
&quot;Déjà entendu&quot; (literally &quot;already heard&quot;) is the experience of feeling sure about having already heard something, even though the exact details are uncertain or were perhaps imagined.

<text>Dionysius Thrax ( &quot;Dionýsios ho Thrâix&quot;, 170–90 BC) was a Greek grammarian and a pupil of Aristarchus of Samothrace. He was long considered to be the author of the earliest grammatical text on the Greek language, one that was used as a standard manual for perhaps some 1,500 years, and which was until recently regarded as the groundwork of the entire Western grammatical tradition.

==Life==
His place of origin was not Thrace, as the epithet &quot;Thrax&quot; denotes, but probably Alexandria. His Thracian background was inferred from the name of his father Tērēs (Τήρης), which is considered to be a Thracian name. One of his co-students during his studies in Alexandria under Aristarchus was Apollodorus of Athens, who also became a distinguished grammarian. Rudolf Pfeiffer dates his shift to the isle of Rhodes to , when political upheavals associated with the policies of Ptolemy VIII Euergetes II are thought to have led to his exile. According to a report in Athenaeus&#x27; Deipnosophistae (11,489a, b), his Rhodian pupils, grateful for his learning, gathered enough silver to enable him to fashion a cup whose shape aspired to recreate that of Nestor mentioned in the Iliad (Book 11, lines 632–637).

Dionysius was primarily a Homeric scholar, which was integral to his training under Aristarchus in Alexandria. His work shows some influence of earlier Stoic grammatical theory, particularly on word classes. He is also reported by Varro to have been an erudite analyst of Greek lyric poetry, perhaps referring to his linguistic and prosodic use of that material. He wrote prolifically in three genres: philological questions (γραμματικά); running commentaries (ὑπομνήματα) and treatises (συνταγματικά). Of the last genre, he wrote a polemical monograph criticizing the Homeric interpretations of Krates. Another work he is said to have written was the Περὶ ποσοτήτων (On quantities). From the scholia preserved from the critical works of Aristonicus and Didymus who excerpted Dionysius&#x27; work it is clear that he was decidedly independent in his textual judgements on the Homeric corpus, since he frequently contradicts his master&#x27;s known readings. His teaching may have exercised a formative impact on the rise of Roman grammatical studies if as an entry in the Suda suggests, the elder Tyrannion was one of his pupils. The founder of classical scholarship in Rome, L. Aelius Stilo, may have profited from Dionysius&#x27; instruction, since he accompanied to Rhodes Q. Metellus Numidicus when the latter went into voluntary exile, and while Dionysius was still teaching there.

==Tékhnē grammatikē==
Dionysius Thrax was credited traditionally as the author of the first extant grammar of Greek, &quot;Art of Grammar&quot; (, &quot;Tékhnē grammatikē&quot;). The Greek text, in August Immanuel Bekker&#x27;s edition, runs to fifty pages. Its importance in Byzantine scholarship is attested by the fact that commentaries on it by Byzantine scholiasts run to some 600 pages. The text itself was thought to be the unique extant example of a work by Hellenistic scholars. This general consensus began to break down when examinations of grammatical texts datable to a later period emerged among the finds of the Oxyrhynchus Papyri which, until relatively late, showed no awareness of key elements in the text attributed to Dionysius Thrax. It concerns itself primarily with a morphological description of Greek, lacking any treatment of syntax. The work was translated into Armenian sometime around the 5th to 6th centuries AD, and into Syriac by Joseph Huzaya around that same period.

Dionysius defines grammar at the beginning of the &quot;Tékhnē&quot; as &quot;the empirical knowledge of what is for the most part being said by poets and prose writers&quot;. He states that &quot;grammatikē&quot;, what we might nowadays call &quot;literary criticism&quot;, comprises six parts:

&quot;Grammatikḗ&quot;
* (a) ἀνάγνωσις ἐντριβὴς κατὰ προσῳδίαν (&quot;anagnōsis...&quot;): reading aloud with correct pronunciation, accent and punctuation.
* (b) ἐξήγησις κατὰ τοὺς ἐνυπάρχοντας ποιητικοὺς τρόπους (&quot;exēgēsis...&quot;): exposition of the tropes/τρόποι, the figurative language of texts.
* (c) ἀπόδοσις πρόχειρος γλωσσῶν τε καὶ ἰστοριῶν (&quot;apodosis...&quot;): common exposition of obsolete words and subject matter.
* (d) εὕρεσις ἐτυμολογίας (&quot;heuresis...&quot;): finding the correct meaning of words according to their origin (etymology).
* (e) ἐκλογισμὸς ἀναλογίας (&quot;eklogismos...&quot;): setting forth or considering analogies.
* (f) κρίσις ποιημάτων (&quot;krisis...&quot;): critical judgement of the works examined.

Paragraph 6 outlines the στοιχεῖα (&quot;stoikheia&quot;) or letters of the alphabet, together with the divisions into vowels, diphthongs and consonants.

Paragraphs 7–10 deal with syllables, long (μακραὶ συλλαβαί), short (βραχεῖαι συλλαβαί) and &quot;anceps&quot; (κοιναὶ συλλαβαί).

Paragraph 11 treats the eight-word classes, though strong doubts exist as to whether or not this division goes back to Dionysius Thrax, since ancient testimonies assert that he conflated proper nouns and appellatives, and classified the article together with pronouns. In the text attributed to Dionysius, the eight classes, which Di Benedetto and others argue was probably developed by Tryphon several decades after Dionysius, are as follows:

* (a) the &#x27;name&#x27; (ὄνομα &quot;ónoma&quot;), translated as noun: a part of speech inflected for case. Its three genders: masculine (ἀρσενικόν), feminine (θηλυκόν) and neutral (οὐδέτερον) are distinguished, together with the five case endings. He also notes however that two other terms are also in use: κοινόν (common) designating those words whose gender varies depending on the sex of the creature, such as ἵππος (&quot;hippos&quot; &#x27;horse&#x27;) and ἐπίκοινον (epicene) used to define words whose gender is stable, but which can refer to either sex, instancing χελιδών (&quot;khelidōn&quot; &#x27;swallow&#x27;). The &quot;name&quot; includes various &quot;species&quot; like nouns, adjectives, proper nouns, appellatives, collectives, ordinals, numerals and more.
** For example, the appellative (προσηγορία), which he considers a species (εἶδος) of the proper noun, not a distinct part of speech.
* (b) the verb (ῥῆμα) with its tenses.
* (c) the participle (μετοχή)
* (d) the article (ἄρθρον)
* (e) the pronoun (ἀντωνυμία)
* (f) the preposition (πρόθεσις)
* (g) the adverb (ἐπίρρημα)
* (h) the conjunction (σύνδεσμος)

Paragraphs 12-20 then elaborate successively on the parts of speech.

==Authorship==
Modern scepticism over the attribution is associated with the pioneering work of Vincenzo Di Benedetto in particular, though as early as 1822 Karl Wilhelm Göttling, by analyzing the scholia on the text that had recently been collected and published by A. I. Bekker, concluded that the text as we have it was to be dated, not to the Hellenistic period but rather to the Byzantine period. Göttling&#x27;s thesis convinced neither Moritz Schmidt nor Gustav Uhlig, and disappeared from view. In 1958/1959, Di Benedetto revived doubts by comparing the received text with ancient grammatical papyri that had since come to light. He argued that before the 3rd to 4th centuries AD, no papyri on Greek grammar reveal material structured in a way similar to the exposition we have in Dionysius&#x27;s treatise, that the surviving witnesses for the period before that late date, namely authors such as Sextus Empiricus, Aelius Herodianus, Apollonius Dyscolus and Quintilian, fail to cite him, and that Dionysius&#x27;s work only begins to receive explicit mention in the works written from the 5th century onwards by such scholars as Timotheus of Gaza, Ammonius Hermiae and Priscian. Di Benedetto concluded that only the first five paragraphs of the treatise came from Dionysius&#x27; hand.

Though initially rebuffed by scholars of the calibre of Pfeiffer and Hartmut Erbse, Di Benedetto&#x27;s argument has found general acceptance today among specialists.

<doc id="8900" wikidata="Q169207" url="?curid=8900" title="Discrimination">
<text>Discrimination is the process of making unfair or prejudicial distinctions between people based on the groups, classes, or other categories to which they belong or are perceived to belong, such as race, gender, age, class, religion, or sexual orientation. Discrimination typically leads to groups being unfairly treated on the basis of perceived statuses based on ethnic, racial, gender or religious categories. It involves depriving members of one group of opportunities or privileges that are available to members of another group.

Discriminatory traditions, policies, ideas, practices and laws exist in many countries and institutions in all parts of the world, including some, where such discrimination is generally decried. In some places, countervailing measures such as quotas have been used to redress the balance in favor of those who are believed to be current or past victims of discrimination. These attempts have often been met with controversy, and sometimes been called reverse discrimination.

==Etymology==

The term &quot;discriminate&quot; appeared in the early 17th century in the English language. It is from the Latin &quot;discriminat-&quot; &#x27;distinguished between&#x27;, from the verb &quot;discriminare&quot;, from &quot;discrimen&quot; &#x27;distinction&#x27;, from the verb &quot;discernere&quot; (corresponding to &quot;to discern&quot;). Since the American Civil War the term &quot;discrimination&quot; generally evolved in American English usage as an understanding of prejudicial treatment of an individual based solely on their race, later generalized as membership in a certain socially undesirable group or social category. 
Before this sense of the word became almost universal, it was a synonym for discernment, tact and culture as in &quot;taste and discrimination&quot;, generally a laudable attribute; to &quot;discriminate against&quot; being commonly disparaged.

==Definitions==

Moral philosophers have defined discrimination using a moralized definition. Under this approach, discrimination is defined as acts, practices, or policies that wrongfully impose a relative disadvantage or deprivation on persons based on their membership in a salient social group. This is a comparative definition. An individual need not be actually harmed in order to be discriminated against. He or she just needs to be treated &quot;worse&quot; than others for some arbitrary reason. If someone decides to donate to help orphan children, but decides to donate less, say, to children of a particular race out of a racist attitude, he or she will be acting in a discriminatory way even if he or she actually benefits the people he discriminates against by donating some money to them. Discrimination also develops into a source of oppression, the action of recognizing someone as &#x27;different&#x27; so much that they are treated inhumanly and degraded.

This moralized definition of discrimination is distinct from a non-moralized definition - in the former, discrimination is wrong by definition, whereas in the latter, this is not the case.

The United Nations stance on discrimination includes the statement: &quot;Discriminatory behaviors take many forms, but they all involve some form of exclusion or rejection.&quot; The United Nations Human Rights Council and other international bodies work towards helping ending discrimination around the world.

==Types==

===Age===
Ageism or age discrimination is discrimination and stereotyping based on the grounds of someone&#x27;s age. It is a set of beliefs, norms, and values which used to justify discrimination or subordination based on a person&#x27;s age. Ageism is most often directed toward elderly people, or adolescents and children.

Age discrimination in hiring has been shown to exist in the United States. Joanna Lahey, professor at The Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&amp;M, found that firms are more than 40% more likely to interview a young adult job applicant than an older job applicant. In Europe, Stijn Baert, Jennifer Norga, Yannick Thuy and Marieke Van Hecke, researchers at Ghent University, measured comparable ratios in Belgium. They found that age discrimination is heterogeneous by the activity older candidates undertook during their additional post-educational years. In Belgium, they are only discriminated if they have more years of inactivity or irrelevant employment.

In a survey for the University of Kent, England, 29% of respondents stated that they had suffered from age discrimination. This is a higher proportion than for gender or racial discrimination. Dominic Abrams, social psychology professor at the university, concluded that ageism is the most pervasive form of prejudice experienced in the UK population.

===Caste===
According to UNICEF and Human Rights Watch, caste discrimination affects an estimated 250 million people worldwide and is mainly prevalent in parts of Asia (India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, Japan) and Africa. , there were 200 million Dalits or Scheduled Castes (formerly known as &quot;untouchables&quot;) in India.

===Class===
===Disability===
Discrimination against people with disabilities in favor of people who are not is called ableism or disablism. Disability discrimination, which treats non-disabled individuals as the standard of &#x27;normal living&#x27;, results in public and private places and services, educational settings, and social services that are built to serve &#x27;standard&#x27; people, thereby excluding those with various disabilities. Studies have shown that disabled people not only need employment in order to be provided with the opportunity to earn a living but they also need employment in order to sustain their mental health and well-being. Work fulfils a number of basic needs for an individual such as collective purpose, social contact, status, and activity. A person with a disability is often found to be socially isolated and work is one way to reduce his or her isolation. In the United States, the Americans with Disabilities Act mandates the provision of equality of access to both buildings and services and is paralleled by similar acts in other countries, such as the Equality Act 2010 in the UK.

===Excellence===
===Language===

===Name===
Discrimination based on a person&#x27;s name may also occur, with researchers suggesting that this form of discrimination is present based on a name&#x27;s meaning, its pronunciation, its uniqueness, its gender affiliation, and its racial affiliation. Research has further shown that real world recruiters spend an average of just six seconds reviewing each résumé before making their initial &quot;fit/no fit&quot; screen-out decision and that a person&#x27;s name is one of the six things they focus on most. France has made it illegal to view a person&#x27;s name on a résumé when screening for the initial list of most qualified candidates. Great Britain, Germany, Sweden, and the Netherlands have also experimented with name-blind summary processes. Some apparent discrimination may be explained by other factors such as name frequency. The effects of name discrimination based on a name&#x27;s fluency is subtle, small and subject to significantly changing norms.

===Nationality===

The Anti-discrimination laws of most countries allow and make exceptions for discrimination based on nationality and immigration status. The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD) does not prohibit discrimination by nationality, citizenship or naturalization but forbids discrimination &quot;against any particular nationality&quot;.

Discrimination on the basis of nationality is usually included in employment laws (see above section for employment discrimination specifically). It is sometimes referred to as bound together with racial discrimination although it can be separate. It may vary from laws that stop refusals of hiring based on nationality, asking questions regarding origin, to prohibitions of firing, forced retirement, compensation and pay, etc., based on nationality.

Discrimination on the basis of nationality may show as a &quot;level of acceptance&quot; in a sport or work team regarding new team members and employees who differ from the nationality of the majority of team members.

In the GCC states, in the workplace, preferential treatment is given to full citizens, even though many of them lack experience or motivation to do the job. State benefits are also generally available for citizens only. Westerners might also get paid more than other expatriates.

===Race or ethnicity===



Racial and ethnic discrimination differentiates individuals on the basis of real and perceived racial and ethnic differences and leads to various forms of the ethnic penalty. It can also refer to the belief that groups of humans possess different behavioral traits corresponding to physical appearance and can be divided based on the superiority of one race over another. It may also mean prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against other people because they are of a different race or ethnicity. Modern variants of racism are often based in social perceptions of biological differences between peoples. These views can take the form of social actions, practices or beliefs, or political systems in which different races are ranked as inherently superior or inferior to each other, based on presumed shared inheritable traits, abilities, or qualities. It has been official government policy in several countries, such as South Africa during the apartheid era. Discriminatory policies towards ethnic minorities include the race-based discrimination against ethnic Indians and Chinese in Malaysia The concept of multiracism has been used to explain the varieties of race discrimination. After the Vietnam War, many Vietnamese refugees moved to Australia and the United States, where they faced discrimination.

===Region===
Regional or geographic discrimination is a form of discrimination that is based on the region in which a person lives or the region in which a person was born. It differs from national discrimination because it may not be based on national borders or the country in which the victim lives, instead, it is based on prejudices against a specific region of one or more countries. Examples include discrimination against Chinese people who were born in regions of the countryside that are far away from cities that are located within China, and discrimination against Americans who are from the southern or northern regions of the United States. It is often accompanied by discrimination that is based on accent, dialect, or cultural differences.

===Religious beliefs===


Religious discrimination is valuing or treating people or groups differently because of what they do or do not believe in or because of their feelings towards a given religion. For instance, the Jewish population of Germany, and indeed a large portion of Europe, was subjected to discrimination under Adolf Hitler and his Nazi party between 1933 and 1945. They were forced to live in ghettos, wear an identifying star of David on their clothes, and sent to concentration and death camps in rural Germany and Poland, where they were to be tortured and killed, all because of their Jewish religion. Many laws (most prominently the Nuremberg Laws of 1935) separated those of Jewish faith as supposedly inferior to the Christian population.

Restrictions on the types of occupations that Jewish people could hold were imposed by Christian authorities. Local rulers and church officials closed many professions to religious Jews, pushing them into marginal roles that were considered socially inferior, such as tax and rent collecting and moneylending, occupations that were only tolerated as a &quot;necessary evil&quot;. The number of Jews who were permitted to reside in different places was limited; they were concentrated in ghettos and banned from owning land. In Saudi Arabia, non-Muslims are not allowed to publicly practice their religions and they cannot enter Mecca and Medina. Furthermore, private non-Muslim religious gatherings might be raided by the religious police. In Maldives, non-Muslims living and visiting the country are prohibited from openly expressing their religious beliefs, holding public congregations to conduct religious activities, or involving Maldivians in such activities. Those expressing religious beliefs other than Islam may face imprisonment of up to five years or house arrest, fines ranging from 5,000 to 20,000 rufiyaa ($320 to $1,300), and deportation.

In a 1979 consultation on the issue, the United States commission on civil rights defined religious discrimination in relation to the civil rights which are guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. Whereas religious civil liberties, such as the right to hold or not to hold a religious belief, are essential for Freedom of Religion (in the United States as secured by the First Amendment), religious discrimination occurs when someone is denied &quot;equal protection under the law, equality of status under the law, equal treatment in the administration of justice, and equality of opportunity and access to employment, education, housing, public services and facilities, and public accommodation because of their exercise of their right to religious freedom&quot;.

===Sex, sex characteristics, gender, and gender identity ===

Sexism is a form of discrimination based on a person&#x27;s sex or gender. It has been linked to stereotypes and gender roles, and may include the belief that one sex or gender is intrinsically superior to another. Extreme sexism may foster sexual harassment, rape, and other forms of sexual violence. Gender discrimination may encompass sexism and is discrimination toward people based on their gender identity or their gender or sex differences. Gender discrimination is especially defined in terms of workplace inequality. It may arise from social or cultural customs and norms.

Intersex persons experience discrimination due to innate, atypical sex characteristics. Multiple jurisdictions now protect individuals on grounds of &quot;intersex status&quot; or &quot;sex characteristics&quot;. South Africa was the first country to explicitly add intersex to legislation, as part of the attribute of &#x27;sex&#x27;. Australia was the first country to add an independent attribute, of &#x27;intersex status&#x27;. Malta was the first to adopt a broader framework of &#x27;sex characteristics&#x27;, through legislation that also ended modifications to the sex characteristics of minors undertaken for social and cultural reasons. Global efforts such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 5 is also aimed at ending all forms of discrimination on the basis of gender and sex.

===Sexual orientation===

One&#x27;s sexual orientation is a &quot;predilection for homosexuality, heterosexuality, or bisexuality&quot;. Like most minority groups, homosexuals and bisexuals are vulnerable to prejudice and discrimination from the majority group. They may experience hatred from others because of their sexuality; a term for such hatred based upon one&#x27;s sexual orientation is often called homophobia. Many continue to hold negative feelings towards those with non-heterosexual orientations and will discriminate against people who have them or are thought to have them. People of other uncommon sexual orientations also experience discrimination. One study found its sample of heterosexuals to be more prejudiced against asexual people than against homosexual or bisexual people.

Employment discrimination based on sexual orientation varies by country. Revealing a lesbian sexual orientation (by means of mentioning an engagement in a rainbow organisation or by mentioning one&#x27;s partner name) lowers employment opportunities in Cyprus and Greece but overall, it has no negative effect in Sweden and Belgium. In the latter country, even a positive effect of revealing a lesbian sexual orientation is found for women at their fertile ages.

Besides these academic studies, in 2009, ILGA published a report based on research carried out by Daniel Ottosson at Södertörn University College in Stockholm, Sweden. This research found that of the 80 countries around the world that continue to consider homosexuality illegal, five carry the death penalty for homosexual activity, and two do in some regions of the country. In the report, this is described as &quot;State sponsored homophobia&quot;. This happens in Islamic states, or in two cases regions under Islamic authority. On February 5, 2005, the IRIN issued a reported titled &quot;Iraq: Male homosexuality still a taboo&quot;. The article stated, among other things that honor killings by Iraqis against a gay family member are common and given some legal protection. In August 2009, Human Rights Watch published an extensive report detailing torture of men accused of being gay in Iraq, including the blocking of men&#x27;s anuses with glue and then giving the men laxatives. Although gay marriage has been legal in South Africa since 2006, same-sex unions are often condemned as &quot;un-African&quot;. Research conducted in 2009 shows 86% of black lesbians from the Western Cape live in fear of sexual assault.
A number of countries, especially those in the Western world, have passed measures to alleviate discrimination against sexual minorities, including laws against anti-gay hate crimes and workplace discrimination. Some have also legalized same-sex marriage or civil unions in order to grant same-sex couples the same protections and benefits as opposite-sex couples. In 2011, the United Nations passed its first resolution recognizing LGBT rights.

===Reverse discrimination===

Reverse discrimination is discrimination against members of a dominant or majority group, in favor of members of a minority or historically disadvantaged group.

This discrimination may seek to redress social inequalities under which minority groups have had less access to privileges enjoyed by the majority group. In such cases it is intended to remove discrimination that minority groups may already face. Reverse discrimination can be defined as the unequal treatment of members of the majority groups resulting from preferential policies, as in college admissions or employment, intended to remedy earlier discrimination against minorities.

Conceptualizing affirmative action as reverse discrimination became popular in the early- to mid-1970s, a time period that focused on under-representation and action policies intended to remedy the effects of past discrimination in both government and the business world.

==Theories and philosophy==

Social theories such as egalitarianism assert that social equality should prevail. In some societies, including most developed countries, each individual&#x27;s civil rights include the right to be free from government sponsored social discrimination. Due to a belief in the capacity to perceive pain or suffering shared by all animals, abolitionist or vegan egalitarianism maintains that the interests of every individual (regardless of their species), warrant equal consideration with the interests of humans, and that not doing so is speciesist.

Philosophers have debated as to how inclusive the definition of discrimination should be. Some philosophers have argued that discrimination should only refer to wrongful or disadvantageous treatment in the context of a socially salient group (such as race, gender, sexuality etc.) within a given context. Under this view, failure to limit the concept of discrimination would lead to it being overinclusive; for example, since most murders occur because of some perceived difference between the perpetrator and the victim, many murders would constitute discrimination if the social salience requirement is not included. Thus this view argues that making the definition of discrimination overinclusive renders it meaningless. Conversely, other philosophers argue that discrimination should simply refer to wrongful disadvantageous treatment regardless of the social salience of the group, arguing that limiting the concept only to socially salient groups is arbitrary, as well as raising issues of determining which groups would count as socially salient. The issue of which groups should count has caused many political and social debates.

Based on realistic-conflict theory and social-identity theory, Rubin and Hewstone have highlighted a distinction among three types of discrimination:
# &quot;Realistic competition&quot; is driven by self-interest and is aimed at obtaining material resources (e.g., food, territory, customers) for the in-group (e.g., favoring an in-group in order to obtain more resources for its members, including the self).
# &quot;Social competition&quot; is driven by the need for self-esteem and is aimed at achieving a positive social status for the in-group relative to comparable out-groups (e.g., favoring an in-group in order to make it better than an out-group).
# &quot;Consensual discrimination&quot; is driven by the need for accuracy and reflects stable and legitimate intergroup status hierarchies (e.g., favoring a high-status in-group because it is high status).

===Labeling theory===
Discrimination, in labeling theory, takes form as mental categorization of minorities and the use of stereotype. This theory describes difference as deviance from the norm, which results in internal devaluation and social stigma that may be seen as discrimination. It is started by describing a &quot;natural&quot; social order. It is distinguished between the fundamental principle of fascism and social democracy. The Nazis in 1930s-era Germany and the pre-1990 Apartheid government of South Africa used racially discriminatory agendas for their political ends. This practice continues with some present day governments.

===Game theory===

Economist Yanis Varoufakis (2013) argues that &quot;discrimination based on utterly arbitrary characteristics evolves quickly and systematically in the experimental laboratory&quot;, and that neither classical game theory nor neoclassical economics can explain this.

In 2002, Varoufakis and Shaun Hargreaves-Heap ran an experiment where volunteers played a computer-mediated, multiround hawk-dove game. At the start of each session, each participant was assigned a color at random, either red or blue. At each round, each player learned the color assigned to his or her opponent, but nothing else about the opponent. Hargreaves-Heap and Varoufakis found that the players&#x27; behavior within a session frequently developed a discriminatory convention, giving a Nash equilibrium where players of one color (the &quot;advantaged&quot; color) consistently played the aggressive &quot;hawk&quot; strategy against players of the other, &quot;disadvantaged&quot; color, who played the acquiescent &quot;dove&quot; strategy against the advantaged color. Players of both colors used a mixed strategy when playing against players assigned the same color as their own. The experimenters then added a cooperation option to the game, and found that disadvantaged players usually cooperated with each other, while advantaged players usually did not. They state that while the equilibria reached in the original hawk-dove game are predicted by evolutionary game theory, game theory does not explain the emergence of cooperation in the disadvantaged group. Citing earlier psychological work of Matthew Rabin, they hypothesize that a norm of differing entitlements emerges across the two groups, and that this norm could define a &quot;fairness&quot; equilibrium within the disadvantaged group.

<doc id="8904" wikidata="Q1192005" url="?curid=8904" title="Double-ended queue">
<text>In computer science, a double-ended queue (abbreviated to deque, ) is an abstract data type that generalizes a queue, for which elements can be added to or removed from either the front (head) or back (tail). It is also often called a head-tail linked list, though properly this refers to a specific data structure &quot;implementation&quot; of a deque (see below).

==Naming conventions==
&quot;Deque&quot; is sometimes written &quot;dequeue&quot;, but this use is generally deprecated in technical literature or technical writing because &quot;dequeue&quot; is also a verb meaning &quot;to remove from a queue&quot;. Nevertheless, several libraries and some writers, such as Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman in their textbook &quot;Data Structures and Algorithms&quot;, spell it &quot;dequeue&quot;. John Mitchell, author of &quot;Concepts in Programming Languages,&quot; also uses this terminology.

==Distinctions and sub-types==
This differs from the queue abstract data type or &quot;first in first out&quot; list (FIFO), where elements can only be added to one end and removed from the other. This general data class has some possible sub-types:

*An input-restricted deque is one where deletion can be made from both ends, but insertion can be made at one end only.
*An output-restricted deque is one where insertion can be made at both ends, but deletion can be made from one end only.

Both the basic and most common list types in computing, queues and stacks can be considered specializations of deques, and can be implemented using deques. A deque is a data structure that allows users to perform push and pop operations at both ends, providing flexibility in managing the order of elements.

== Operations ==

The basic operations on a deque are &quot;enqueue&quot; and &quot;dequeue&quot; on either end. Also generally implemented are &quot;peek&quot; operations, which return the value at that end without dequeuing it.

Names vary between languages; major implementations include:
== Implementations ==
There are at least two common ways to efficiently implement a deque: with a modified dynamic array or with a doubly linked list.

The dynamic array approach uses a variant of a dynamic array that can grow from both ends, sometimes called array deques. These array deques have all the properties of a dynamic array, such as constant-time random access, good locality of reference, and inefficient insertion/removal in the middle, with the addition of amortized constant-time insertion/removal at both ends, instead of just one end. Three common implementations include:
* Storing deque contents in a circular buffer, and only resizing when the buffer becomes full. This decreases the frequency of resizings.
* Allocating deque contents from the center of the underlying array, and resizing the underlying array when either end is reached. This approach may require more frequent resizings and waste more space, particularly when elements are only inserted at one end.
* Storing contents in multiple smaller arrays, allocating additional arrays at the beginning or end as needed. Indexing is implemented by keeping a dynamic array containing pointers to each of the smaller arrays.

===Purely functional implementation===
Double-ended queues can also be implemented as a purely functional data structure. Two versions of the implementation exist. The first one, called &quot;&#x27;real-time deque&quot;, is presented below. It allows the queue to be persistent with operations in worst-case time, but requires lazy lists with memoization. The second one, with no lazy lists nor memoization is presented at the end of the sections. Its amortized time is if the persistency is not used; but the worst-time complexity of an operation is where is the number of elements in the double-ended queue.

Let us recall that, for a list codice_1, codice_2 denotes its length, that codice_3 represents an empty list and codice_4 represents the list whose head is codice_5 and whose tail is codice_6. The functions codice_7 and codice_8 return the list codice_1 without its first codice_10 elements, and the first codice_10 elements of codice_1, respectively. Or, if codice_13, they return the empty list and codice_1 respectively.

==== Real-time deques via lazy rebuilding and scheduling ====
A double-ended queue is represented as a sextuple codice_15 where codice_16 is a linked list which contains the front of the queue of length codice_17. Similarly, codice_18 is a linked list which represents the reverse of the rear of the queue, of length codice_19. Furthermore, it is assured that codice_20 and codice_21 - intuitively, it means that both the front and the rear contains between a third minus one and two thirds plus one of the elements. Finally, codice_22 and codice_23 are tails of codice_16 and of codice_18, they allow scheduling the moment where some lazy operations are forced. Note that, when a double-ended queue contains codice_26 elements in the front list and codice_26 elements in the rear list, then the inequality invariant remains satisfied after codice_10 insertions and codice_29 deletions when codice_30. That is, at most codice_31 operations can happen between each rebalancing.

Let us first give an implementation of the various operations that affect the front of the deque - cons, head and tail. Those implementations do not necessarily respect the invariant. In a second time we&#x27;ll explain how to modify a deque which does not satisfy the invariant into one which satisfies it. However, they use the invariant, in that if the front is empty then the rear has at most one element. The operations affecting the rear of the list are defined similarly by symmetry. 
empty = (0, NIL, NIL, 0, NIL, NIL)
fun insert&#x27;(x, (len_front, front, tail_front, len_rear, rear, tail_rear)) =
 (len_front+1, CONS(x, front), drop(2, tail_front), len_rear, rear, drop(2, tail_rear))
fun head((_, CONS(h, _), _, _, _, _)) = h
fun head((_, NIL, _, _, CONS(h, NIL), _)) = h
fun tail&#x27;((len_front, CONS(head_front, front), tail_front, len_rear, rear, tail_rear)) =
 (len_front - 1, front, drop(2, tail_front), len_rear, rear, drop(2, tail_rear))
fun tail&#x27;((_, NIL, _, _, CONS(h, NIL), _)) = empty 
It remains to explain how to define a method codice_32 that rebalance the deque if codice_33 or codice_34 broke the invariant. The method codice_35 and codice_34 can be defined by first applying codice_33 and codice_38 and then applying codice_32.
fun balance(q as (len_front, front, tail_front, len_rear, rear, tail_rear)) =
 let floor_half_len = (len_front + len_rear) / 2 in
 let ceil_half_len = len_front + len_rear - floor_half_len in
 if len_front &gt; 2*len_rear+1 then
 let val front&#x27; = take(ceil_half_len, front)
 val rear&#x27; = rotateDrop(rear, floor_half_len, front)
 in (ceil_half_len, front&#x27;, front&#x27;, floor_half_len, rear&#x27;, rear&#x27;)
 else if len_front &gt; 2*len_rear+1 then
 let val rear&#x27; = take(floor_half_len, rear)
 val front&#x27; = rotateDrop(front, ceil_half_len, rear)
 in (ceil_half_len, front&#x27;, front&#x27;, floor_half_len, rear&#x27;, rear&#x27;)
 else q

where codice_40 return the concatenation of codice_16 and of codice_42. That iscodice_43 put into codice_44 the content of codice_16 and the content of codice_18 that is not already in codice_47. Since dropping codice_26 elements takes formula_1 time, we use laziness to ensure that elements are dropped two by two, with two drops being done during each codice_38 and each codice_33 operation. 
fun rotateDrop(front, i, rear) =
 if i &lt; 2 then rotateRev(front, drop(i, rear), NIL)
 else let CONS(x, front&#x27;) = front in
 CONS(x, rotateDrop(front&#x27;, j-2, drop(2, rear)))

where codice_51 is a function that returns the front, followed by the middle reversed, followed by the rear. This function is also defined using laziness to ensure that it can be computed step by step, with one step executed during each codice_33 and codice_38 and taking a constant time. This function uses the invariant that codice_54 is 2 or 3. 
fun rotateRev(NIL, rear, a) =
 reverse(rear)++a
fun rotateRev(CONS(x, front), rear, a) =
 CONS(x, rotateRev(front, drop(2, rear), reverse(take(2, rear))++a))

where codice_55 is the function concatenating two lists.

==== Implementation without laziness ====
Note that, without the lazy part of the implementation, this would be a non-persistent implementation of queue in amortized time. In this case, the lists codice_22 and codice_23 could be removed from the representation of the double-ended queue.

== Language support ==
Ada&#x27;s containers provides the generic packages codice_58 and codice_59, for the dynamic array and linked list implementations, respectively.

C++&#x27;s Standard Template Library provides the class templates codice_60 and codice_61, for the multiple array and linked list implementations, respectively.

As of Java 6, Java&#x27;s Collections Framework provides a new interface that provides the functionality of insertion and removal at both ends. It is implemented by classes such as (also new in Java 6) and , providing the dynamic array and linked list implementations, respectively. However, the codice_62, contrary to its name, does not support random access.

Javascript&#x27;s Array prototype &amp; Perl&#x27;s arrays have native support for both removing (shift and pop) and adding (unshift and push) elements on both ends.

Python 2.4 introduced the codice_63 module with support for deque objects. It is implemented using a doubly linked list of fixed-length subarrays.

As of PHP 5.3, PHP&#x27;s SPL extension contains the &#x27;SplDoublyLinkedList&#x27; class that can be used to implement Deque datastructures. Previously to make a Deque structure the array functions array_shift/unshift/pop/push had to be used instead.

GHC&#x27;s Data.Sequence module implements an efficient, functional deque structure in Haskell. The implementation uses 2–3 finger trees annotated with sizes. There are other (fast) possibilities to implement purely functional (thus also persistent) double queues (most using heavily lazy evaluation). Kaplan and Tarjan were the first to implement optimal confluently persistent catenable deques. Their implementation was strictly purely functional in the sense that it did not use lazy evaluation. Okasaki simplified the data structure by using lazy evaluation with a bootstrapped data structure and degrading the performance bounds from worst-case to amortized. Kaplan, Okasaki, and Tarjan produced a simpler, non-bootstrapped, amortized version that can be implemented either using lazy evaluation or more efficiently using mutation in a broader but still restricted fashion. Mihaescu and Tarjan created a simpler (but still highly complex) strictly purely functional implementation of catenable deques, and also a much simpler implementation of strictly purely functional non-catenable deques, both of which have optimal worst-case bounds.

Rust&#x27;s codice_64 includes VecDeque which implements a double-ended queue using a growable ring buffer.

== Complexity ==
* In a doubly-linked list implementation and assuming no allocation/deallocation overhead, the time complexity of all deque operations is O(1). Additionally, the time complexity of insertion or deletion in the middle, given an iterator, is O(1); however, the time complexity of random access by index is O(n).
* In a growing array, the amortized time complexity of all deque operations is O(1). Additionally, the time complexity of random access by index is O(1); but the time complexity of insertion or deletion in the middle is O(n).
== Applications ==

One example where a deque can be used is the work stealing algorithm. This algorithm implements task scheduling for several processors. A separate deque with threads to be executed is maintained for each processor. To execute the next thread, the processor gets the first element from the deque (using the &quot;remove first element&quot; deque operation). If the current thread forks, it is put back to the front of the deque (&quot;insert element at front&quot;) and a new thread is executed. When one of the processors finishes execution of its own threads (i.e. its deque is empty), it can &quot;steal&quot; a thread from another processor: it gets the last element from the deque of another processor (&quot;remove last element&quot;) and executes it. The work stealing algorithm is used by Intel&#x27;s Threading Building Blocks (TBB) library for parallel programming.

<doc id="8905" wikidata="Q192678" url="?curid=8905" title="Diene">
<text>In organic chemistry, a diene ( ); also diolefin, ) or alkadiene) is a covalent compound that contains two double bonds, usually among carbon atoms. They thus contain two alk&quot;ene&quot; units, with the standard prefix &quot;di&quot; of systematic nomenclature. As a subunit of more complex molecules, dienes occur in naturally occurring and synthetic chemicals and are used in organic synthesis. Conjugated dienes are widely used as monomers in the polymer industry. Polyunsaturated fats are of interest to nutrition.

==Classes==
Dienes can be divided into three classes, depending on the relative location of the double bonds:
#Cumulated dienes have the double bonds sharing a common atom. The result is more specifically called an allene.
#Conjugated dienes have conjugated double bonds separated by one single bond. Conjugated dienes are more stable than other dienes because of resonance.
#Unconjugated dienes have the double bonds separated by two or more single bonds. They are usually less stable than isomeric conjugated dienes. This can also be known as an isolated diene.

According to the &quot;Gold Book&quot; definition, a &quot;diene&quot; could include one or more heteroatoms which replace unsaturated carbon atoms, giving structures that could more specifically be called &quot;heterodienes&quot;.

Compounds that contain more than two double bonds are called polyenes. Polyenes and dienes share many properties.

==Synthesis of dienes==

On an industrial scale, butadiene is prepared by thermal cracking of butanes. In a similarly non-selective process, dicyclopentadiene is obtained from coal tars.

In the laboratory, more directed and more delicate processes are employed such as dehydrohalogenations and condensations. Myriad methods have been developed, such as the Whiting reaction. Families of nonconjugated dienes are derived from the oligomerization and dimerization of conjugated dienes. For example, 1,5-cyclooctadiene and 4-vinylcyclohexene are produced by dimerization of 1,3-butadiene.

Diene-containing fatty acids are biosynthesized from acetyl CoA.

α,ω-Dienes have the formula (CH2)n(CH=CH2)2. They are prepared industrially by ethenolysis of cyclic dienes. For example, 1,5-hexadiene and 1,9-decadiene, useful crosslinking agents and synthetic intermediates, are produced from 1,5-cyclooctadiene and cyclooctene, respectively. The catalyst is derived from Re2O7 on alumina.

== Reactivity and uses==

===Polymerization===
The most heavily practiced reaction of alkenes, dienes included, is polymerization. 1,3-Butadiene is a precursor to rubber used in tires, and isoprene is the precursor to natural rubber. Chloroprene is related but it is a synthetic monomer.

===Cycloadditions===
An important reaction for conjugated dienes is the Diels–Alder reaction. Many specialized dienes have been developed to exploit this reactivity for the synthesis of natural products (e.g., Danishefsky&#x27;s diene).

===Other addition reactions===
Conjugated dienes add reagents such as bromine and hydrogen by both 1,2-addition and 1,4-addition pathways. Addition of polar reagents can generate complex architectures:

===Metathesis reactions===
Nonconjugated dienes are substrates for ring-closing metathesis reactions. These reactions require a metal catalyst:c

===Acidity===
The position adjacent to a double bond is acidic because the resulting allyl anion is stabilized by resonance. This effect becomes more pronounced as more alkenes are involved to create greater stability. For example, deprotonation at position 3 of a 1,4-diene or position 5 of a 1,3-diene give a pentadienyl anion. An even greater effect is seen if the anion is aromatic, for example, deprotonation of cyclopentadiene to give the cyclopentadienyl anion.

===As ligands===
Dienes are widely used chelating ligands in organometallic chemistry. In some cases they serve as placeholder ligands, being removed during a catalytic cycle. For example, the cyclooctadiene (&quot;cod&quot;) ligands in bis(cyclooctadiene)nickel(0) are labile. In some cases, dienes are spectator ligands, remaining coordinated throughout a catalytic cycle and influencing the product distributions. Chiral dienes have also been described. Other diene complexes include (butadiene)iron tricarbonyl, cyclobutadieneiron tricarbonyl, and cyclooctadiene rhodium chloride dimer.

<text>The Diatessaron (; c. 160–175 AD) is the most prominent early gospel harmony. It was created in the Syriac language by Tatian, an Assyrian early Christian apologist and ascetic. Tatian sought to combine all the textual material he found in the four gospels - Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John - into a single coherent narrative of Jesus&#x27;s life and death. However, and in contradistinction to most later gospel harmonists, Tatian appears not to have been motivated by any aspiration to validate the four separate canonical gospel accounts; or to demonstrate that, as they stood, they could each be shown as being without inconsistency or error.

Although widely used by early Syriac Christians, the original text has not survived. It was reconstructed in 1881 by Theodor Zahn from translations and commentaries.

==Terminology==
The title &quot;Diatessaron&quot; comes from the Latin &quot;diatessarōn&quot;, meaning: &quot;made of four [ingredients]&quot;; this is derived in turn from Greek, διὰ τεσσάρων (&quot;dia tessarōn&quot;), meaning &quot;out of four&quot; (i.e., &quot;, dia&quot;, &quot;at intervals of&quot; and &quot;tessarōn&quot; [genitive of , &quot;tessares&quot;], &quot;four&quot;).

The Syriac name for this gospel harmony is &quot; (&quot;Ewangeliyôn Damhalltê&quot;) meaning: &quot;Gospel of the Mixed&quot;.

==Overview==

Tatian&#x27;s harmony follows the gospels closely in terms of text but, in order to fit all the canonical material in, he created his own narrative sequence, which is different from both the synoptic sequence and John&#x27;s sequence; and occasionally creates intervening time periods that are found in none of the source accounts. This sequence is coherent and consistent within itself, but not necessarily consistent with that in all or any of the separate canonical gospels; and Tatian apparently applies the same principle in respect of the narrative itself. Where the gospels differ from one another in respect of the details of an event or teaching, the Diatessaron resolves such apparent contradictions by selecting one or another alternative wording and adding consistent details from the other gospels; while omitting apparent duplicate matter, especially across the synoptics. Hence, in respect of the healing of the blind at Jericho the Diatessaron reports only one blind man, Bartimeaus, healed by Jesus when leaving the city according to the account in Mark 10:46ff (expanded with phrases from Luke 18:36–37); consequently omitting any separate mention of two unnamed blind men healed by Jesus leaving Jericho (Matthew 20:29ff), and also the healing by Jesus entering Jericho the previous day of a single unnamed blind man (Luke 18:35ff).

Otherwise, Tatian originally omitted altogether both of the different genealogies in Matthew and Luke, as well as Luke&#x27;s introduction (Luke 1:1–4); and also did not originally include Jesus&#x27; encounter with the adulteress (the pericope adulterae: John 7:53–8:11). The pericope is present in western manuscripts believed to be based on the Diatessaron (e.g., Codex Fuldensis) but is generally considered to be a latter interpolation to the Gospel of John, with the Diatessaron itself often cited as an early textual witness in support of its omission. 

Most scholars agree that Tatian did, from the beginning, include the longer ending of Mark (Mark 16: 9–20), and correspondingly is amongst the earliest witnesses to this inclusion. Tatian added no significant wording to the textual material he took from the separate gospels. Only 56 verses in the canonical Gospels do not have a counterpart in the Diatessaron, mostly the genealogies and the pericope adulterae. The final work is about 72 per cent the length of the four gospels put together; around a quarter of the text of the separate gospels being adjudged by Tatian to be duplicated. (McFall, 1994).

In the early Church, the gospels at first circulated independently, with Matthew the most popular. The Diatessaron is notable evidence for the authority already enjoyed by the gospels by the mid- to late-2nd century. Within twenty years after Tatian&#x27;s harmony was written, Irenaeus was expressly arguing for the authoritative character of the Four Gospels. It is unclear whether Tatian intended the Diatessaron to supplement or replace the four separate gospels; but both outcomes came to pass in different churches. The Diatessaron became adopted as the standard lectionary text of the gospels in some Syriac-speaking churches from the late 2nd to the 5th century, until it gave way to the four separate Gospels such as the Syriac Sinaitic gospels, or later in the Peshitta version. At the same time, in the churches of the Latin west, the Diatessaron circulated as a supplement to the four gospels, especially in the Latin translation.

==Recensions and translations==
A number of recensions of the &quot;Diatessaron&quot; are extant. The earliest, part of the Eastern family of recensions, is preserved in 4th century theologian Ephrem the Syrian&#x27;s &quot;Commentary&quot; on Tatian&#x27;s work, which itself is preserved in two versions: an Armenian translation preserved in two copies, and a copy of Ephrem&#x27;s original Syriac text dated to the late 5th or early 6th century, which has been edited by Louis Leloir (Paris, 1966).

Many other translations have been made, sometimes including substantial revisions to the text. There are translations into Arabic, Latin, Old Georgian, Old High German, Middle High German, Middle English, Middle Dutch and Old Italian. There is a Persian harmony that seems to have borrowed some readings from the &quot;Diatessaron&quot;. There are also Parthian texts with borrowings from the &quot;Diatessaron&quot;. The Arabic translation was made by Ibn al-Tayyib in the early 11th century from the original Syriac.

== Tatian&#x27;s harmony ==

Tatian was an Assyrian who was a pupil of Justin Martyr in Rome, where, Justin says, the &quot;apomnemoneumata&quot; (recollections or memoirs) of the Apostles, the gospels, were read every Sunday. When Justin quotes the synoptic Gospels, he tends to do so in a harmonised form, and Helmut Koester and others conclude that Justin must have possessed a Greek harmony text of Matthew, Luke and Mark.

If so, it is unclear how much Tatian may have borrowed from this previous author in determining his own narrative sequence of Gospel elements. It is equally unclear whether Tatian took the Syriac Gospel texts composited into his Diatessaron from a previous translation, or whether the translation was his own. Where the Diatessaron records Gospel quotations from the Jewish Scriptures, the text appears to agree with that found in the Syriac Peshitta Old Testament rather than that found in the Greek Septuagint—as used by the original Gospel authors. The majority consensus is that the Peshitta Old Testament preceded the Diatessaron, and represents an independent translation from the Hebrew Bible. Resolution of these scholarly questions remained very difficult so long as no complete version of the &quot;Diatessaron&quot; in Syriac or Greek had been recovered; while the medieval translations that had survived—in Arabic and Latin—both relied on texts that had been heavily corrected to conform better with later canonical versions of the separate Gospel texts.

There is scholarly uncertainty about what language Tatian used for its original composition, whether Syriac or Greek.

== &quot;Diatessaron&quot; in Syriac Christianity ==

The &quot;Diatessaron&quot; was used as the standard Gospel text in the liturgy of at least some sections of the Syrian Church for possibly up to two centuries and was quoted or alluded to by Syrian writers. Ephrem the Syrian wrote a commentary on it, the Syriac original of which was rediscovered only in 1957, when a manuscript acquired by Sir Chester Beatty in 1957 (now Chester Beatty Syriac MS 709, Dublin) turned out to contain the text of Ephrem&#x27;s commentary. The manuscript constituted approximately half of the leaves of a volume of Syriac writings that had been catalogued in 1952 in the library of the Coptic monastery of Deir es-Suriani in Wadi Natrun, Egypt. Subsequently, the Chester Beatty library was able to track down and buy a further 42 leaves, so that now approximately eighty per cent of the Syriac commentary is available (McCarthy 1994). Ephrem did not comment on all passages in the Diatessaron, and nor does he always quote commentated passages in full; but for those phrases that he does quote, the commentary provides for the first time a dependable witness to Tatian&#x27;s original; and also confirms its content and their sequence. .

Theodoret, bishop of Cyrrhus on the Euphrates in upper Syria in 423, suspecting Tatian of having been a heretic, sought out and found more than two hundred copies of the &quot;Diatessaron&quot;, which he &quot;collected and put away, and introduced instead of them the Gospels of the four evangelists&quot;.

== Vernacular harmonies derived from the &quot;Diatessaron&quot; ==

No Christian tradition, other than some Syriac ones, has ever adopted a harmonized Gospel text for use in its liturgy. However, in many traditions, it was not unusual for subsequent Christian generations to seek to provide paraphrased Gospel versions in language closer to the vernacular of their own day. Frequently such versions have been constructed as Gospel harmonies, sometimes taking Tatian&#x27;s Diatessaron as an exemplar; other times proceeding independently. Hence from the Syriac Diatessaron text was derived an 11th-century Arabic harmony (the source for the published versions of the Diatessaron in English); and a 13th-century Persian harmony. The Arabic harmony preserves Tatian&#x27;s sequence exactly, but uses a source text corrected in most places to that of the standard Syriac Peshitta Gospels; the Persian harmony differs greatly in sequence, but translates a Syriac text that is rather closer to that in Ephrem&#x27;s commentary.

A Vetus Latina version of Tatian&#x27;s Syriac text appears to have circulated in the West from the late 2nd century; with a sequence adjusted to conform more closely to that of the canonical Gospel of Luke; and also including additional canonical text (such as the &quot;Pericope Adulterae&quot;), and possibly non-canonical matter from the Gospel of the Hebrews. With the gradual adoption of the Vulgate as the liturgical Gospel text of the Latin Church, the Latin Diatessaron was increasingly modified to conform to Vulgate readings. In 546 Victor of Capua discovered such a mixed manuscript; and, further corrected by Victor so as to provide a very pure Vulgate text within a modified Diatessaron sequence and to restore the two genealogies of Jesus side-by-side, this harmony, the Codex Fuldensis, survives in the monastic library at Fulda, where it served as the source text for vernacular harmonies in Old High German, Eastern Frankish and Old Saxon (the alliterative poem &#x27;Heliand&#x27;). The older mixed Vulgate/Diatessaron text type also appears to have continued as a distinct tradition, as such texts appear to underlie surviving 13th–14th century Gospel harmonies in Middle Dutch, Middle High German, Middle French, Middle English, Tuscan and Venetian; although no example of this hypothetical Latin sub-text has ever been identified. The Liège Diatessaron is a particularly poetic example. This Latin Diatessaron textual tradition has also been suggested as underlying the 16th century Islam-influenced Gospel of Barnabas (Joosten, 2002).

== Use of the word &quot;God&quot; ==
Robert F. Shedinger writes that in quotations to the Old Testament where the great uncial codices have &quot;κύριος&quot; and the Hebrew OT manuscripts יהוה (YHWH), Tatian wrote the term &quot;God&quot;. Pavlos D. Vasileiadis reports that &quot;Shedinger proposed that the Syriac Diatessaron, composed some time after the middle of the second century CE, may provide additional confirmation of Howard&#x27;s hypothesis (Tatian and the Jewish Scriptures, 136–140). Additionally, within the Syriac Peshitta is discernible the distinction between κύριος rendered as ܡܪܝܐ (&quot;marya&quot;, which means &quot;lord&quot; and refers to the God as signified by the Tetragrammaton; see Lu 1:32) and ܡܪܢ (&quot;maran&quot;, a more generic term for &quot;lord&quot;; see Joh 21:7).&quot; R. F. Shedinger holds that after יהוה, θεός could be a term before κύριος became the standard term in the New Testament Greek copies.

Shedinger&#x27;s work has been strongly criticized. Since Tatian&#x27;s Diatessaron is known only indirectly from references to it in other works, Shedinger&#x27;s dissertation is based on his collection of 69 &quot;possible&quot; readings, only two of which, in the judgment of William L. Petersen. reach the level of probability. Peterson complains of Shedinger&#x27;s &quot;inconsistent methodology&quot; and says that the surviving readings do not support his conclusions. Petersen thinks the dissertation should never have been accepted for a doctoral degree, in view of &quot;the illogical arguments, inconsistent standards, philological errors, and methodological blunders that mar this book. [...] the errors are so frequent and so fundamental that this volume can contribute nothing to scholarship. What it says that is true has already been said elsewhere, with greater clarity and perspective. What it says that is new is almost always wrong, plagued [...] with philological, logical, and methodological errors, and a gross insensitivity to things historical (both within the discipline, as well as the transmission-history of texts). Reading this book fills one with dismay and despair. It is shocking that a work which does not rise to the level of a master&#x27;s thesis should be approved as a doctoral dissertation; how it found its way into print is unfathomable. One shudders to think of the damage it will do when, in the future, it is cited by the ignorant and the unsuspecting as &quot;demonstrating&quot; what it has not.&quot; Jan Joosten&#x27;s review of Shedinger&#x27;s work is also condemnatory. In his judgment &quot;Shedinger&#x27;s study remains unconvincing, not only in the final conclusions but also in the details of the argument.&quot;

<text>Dean Ray Koontz (born July 9, 1945) is an American author. His novels are billed as suspense thrillers, but frequently incorporate elements of horror, fantasy, science fiction, mystery, and satire. Many of his books have appeared on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list, with fourteen hardcovers and sixteen paperbacks reaching the number-one position. Koontz wrote under a number of pen names earlier in his career, including &quot;David Axton&quot;, &quot;Deanna Dwyer&quot;, &quot;K.R. Dwyer&quot;, &quot;Leigh Nichols&quot; and &quot;Brian Coffey&quot;. He has published over 105 novels and a number of novellas and collections of short stories, and has sold over 450 million copies of his work.

== Early life ==
Koontz was born on July 9, 1945, in Everett, Pennsylvania, the son of Florence (née Logue) and Raymond Koontz. He has said that he was regularly beaten and abused by his alcoholic father, which influenced his later writing, as also did the courage of his physically diminutive mother in standing up to her husband. In his senior year at Shippensburg State College, he won a fiction competition sponsored by &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; magazine. After graduation in 1967, he went to work as an English teacher at Mechanicsburg High School in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania. In the 1960s, Koontz worked for the Appalachian Poverty Program, a federally funded initiative designed to help poor children. In a 1996 interview with &quot;Reason&quot; magazine, he said that while the program sounded &quot;very noble and wonderful, ... [i]n reality, it was a dumping ground for violent children ... and most of the funding ended up &#x27;disappearing somewhere.&#x27;&quot; This experience greatly shaped Koontz&#x27;s political outlook. In his book, &quot;The Dean Koontz Companion&quot;, he recalled that he

&quot;... realized that most of these programs are not meant to help anyone, merely to control people and make them dependent. I was forced to reconsider everything I&#x27;d once believed. I developed a profound distrust of government regardless of the philosophy of the people in power. I remained a liberal on civil-rights issues, became a conservative on defense, and a semi-libertarian on all other matters.&quot;

== Career ==
In his spare time, Koontz wrote his first novel, &quot;Star Quest&quot;, which was published in 1968. Koontz went on to write over a dozen science fiction novels. Seeing the Catholic faith as a contrast to the chaos in his family, Koontz converted in college because faith provided existential answers for life; he admired Catholicism&#x27;s &quot;intellectual rigor,&quot; saying it permitted a view of life that saw mystery and wonder in all things. He says he sees Catholicism as English writer and Catholic convert G. K. Chesterton did: that it encourages a &quot;joy about the gift of life&quot;. Koontz says that spirituality has always been part of his books, as are grace and our struggle as fallen souls, but he &quot;never get[s] on a soapbox&quot;.

In the 1970s, Koontz began writing suspense and horror fiction, both under his own name and several pseudonyms, sometimes publishing up to eight books a year. Koontz has stated that he began using pen names after several editors convinced him that authors who switched back and forth between different genres invariably fell victim to &quot;negative crossover&quot; (alienating established fans and simultaneously failing to pick up any new ones). Known pseudonyms used by Koontz during his career include Deanna Dwyer, K. R. Dwyer, Aaron Wolfe, David Axton, Brian Coffey, John Hill, Leigh Nichols, Owen West, Richard Paige, and Anthony North. As Brian Coffey, he wrote the &quot;Mike Tucker&quot; trilogy (&quot;Blood Risk&quot;, &quot;Surrounded&quot;, &quot;Wall of Masks&quot;) in acknowledged tribute to the Parker novels of Richard Stark (Donald E. Westlake). Many of Koontz&#x27;s pseudonymous novels are now available under his real name. Many others remain suppressed by Koontz, who bought back the rights to ensure they could not be republished; he has, on occasion, said that he might revise some for republication, but only three have appeared — &quot;Demon Seed&quot; and &quot;Invasion&quot; were both heavily rewritten before they were republished, and &quot;Prison of Ice&quot; had certain sections bowdlerised.

After writing full-time for more than 10 years, Koontz had his acknowledged breakthrough novel with &quot;Whispers&quot;, published in 1980. The two books before that, &quot;The Key to Midnight&quot; and &quot;The Funhouse&quot;, also sold over a million copies, but were written under pen names. His first bestseller was &quot;Demon Seed&quot;, the sales of which picked up after the release of the film of the same name in 1977, and sold over two million copies in one year. His first hardcover bestseller, which finally promised some financial stability and lifted him out of the midlist hit-and-miss range, was his book &quot;Strangers&quot;.
Since then, 12 hardcovers and 14 paperbacks written by Koontz have reached number one on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list.

Bestselling science fiction writer Brian Herbert has stated, &quot;I even went through a phase where I read everything that Dean Koontz wrote, and in the process I learned a lot about characterization and building suspense.&quot;

In 1997, psychologist Katherine Ramsland published an extensive biography of Koontz based on interviews with his family and him. This &quot;psychobiography&quot; (as Ramsland called it) often showed the conception of Koontz&#x27;s characters and plots from events in his own life.

Early author photos on the back of many of his novels show a balding Koontz with a mustache. After Koontz underwent hair transplantation surgery in the late 1990s, his subsequent books have featured a new, clean-shaven appearance with a fuller head of hair. Koontz explained the change by claiming that he was tired of looking like G. Gordon Liddy.

Many of his novels are set in and around Orange County, California. As of 2006, he lives there with his wife, Gerda (Cerra), in Newport Coast, California, behind the gates of Pelican Hills. In 2008, he was the world&#x27;s sixth-most highly paid author, tied with John Grisham, at $25 million annually.

In 2019, Koontz began publishing with Amazon Publishing. At the time of the announcement, Koontz was one of the company&#x27;s most notable signings.

== Pet dogs ==
One of Koontz&#x27;s pen names was inspired by his dog, Trixie Koontz, a Golden Retriever, shown in many of his book-jacket photos. Trixie originally was a service dog with Canine Companions for Independence (CCI), a charitable organization that provides service dogs for people with disabilities. Trixie was a gift from CCI in gratitude of Koontz&#x27;s substantial donations, totaling $2.5 million between 1991 and 2004. Koontz was taken with the charity while he was researching his novel &quot;Midnight&quot;, a book which included a CCI-trained dog, a black Labrador Retriever, named Moose.

In 2004, Koontz wrote and edited &quot;Life Is Good: Lessons in Joyful Living&quot; in her name, and in 2005, Koontz wrote a second book credited to Trixie, &quot;Christmas Is Good&quot;. Both books are written from a supposed canine perspective on the joys of life. The royalty payments of the books were donated to CCI. In 2007, Trixie contracted terminal cancer that created a tumor in her heart. The Koontzes had her euthanized outside their family home on June 30. After Trixie&#x27;s death, Koontz has continued writing on his website under the name &quot;TOTOS&quot;, standing for &quot;Trixie on the Other Side&quot;. Trixie is widely thought to have been his inspiration for his November 2007 book, &quot;The Darkest Evening of the Year&quot;, about a woman who runs a Golden Retriever rescue home, and who rescues a &quot;special&quot; dog, named Nickie, which eventually saves her life. In August 2009, Koontz published &quot;A Big Little Life&quot;, a memoir of his life with Trixie.

In October 2008, Koontz revealed that he had adopted a new dog, Anna. Eventually, he learned that Anna was the grandniece of Trixie. Anna died on May 22, 2016. Koontz then adopted a new dog, Elsa, on July 11, 2016.

== Disputed authorship ==
A number of letters, articles, and novels were ostensibly written by Koontz during the 1960s and 1970s, but he has stated he did not write them. These include 30 erotic novels, allegedly written together by Koontz and his wife Gerda, including books such as &quot;Thirteen and Ready!&quot;, &quot;Swappers Convention&quot;, and &quot;Hung&quot;, the last one published under the name &quot;Leonard Chris&quot;. They also include contributions to the fanzines &quot;Energumen&quot; and &quot;BeABohema&quot; in the late 1960s and early 1970s, including articles that mention the erotic novels, such as a movie column called &quot;Way Station&quot; in &quot;BeABohema&quot;.

Koontz wrote in &quot;How to Write Best Selling Fiction&quot;, a much revised and updated version of &#x27;Writing Popular Fiction&#x27; (1972), &quot;During my first six years as a full-time novelist ... I wrote a lot of ephemeral stuff; anything that would pay some bills ... I did Gothic romance novels under a pen-name ... Like many writers, I did some pornography too, and a variety of other things, none of which required me to commit my heart or my soul to the task. (This is not to say I didn&#x27;t bother to do a good job; on the contrary, I never wrote down to any market, and I always tried to give my editors and readers their money&#x27;s worth.)&quot; The Gothic novels are identifiable, but none of Koontz&#x27;s acknowledged work fits into the latter category.

Koontz has stated on his website that he used only the ten known pen names and &quot;there are no secret pen names used by Dean&quot;; he adds that his own identity was stolen by &quot;a person he had previously worked with professionally&quot;, who submitted letters and some articles to fanzines under Koontz&#x27;s name between 1969 and at least the early 1970s. Koontz has stated that he was only made aware of these bogus letters and articles in 1991 in a written admission from the identity thief. He has stated that he will reveal this person&#x27;s name in his memoirs.

<text>The Drake equation is a probabilistic argument used to estimate the number of active, communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way Galaxy.

The equation was formulated in 1961 by Frank Drake, not for purposes of quantifying the number of civilizations, but as a way to stimulate scientific dialogue at the first scientific meeting on the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI). The equation summarizes the main concepts which scientists must contemplate when considering the question of other radio-communicative life. It is more properly thought of as an approximation than as a serious attempt to determine a precise number.

Criticism related to the Drake equation focuses not on the equation itself, but on the fact that the estimated values for several of its factors are highly conjectural, the combined multiplicative effect being that the uncertainty associated with any derived value is so large that the equation cannot be used to draw firm conclusions.

==Equation==
The Drake equation is:

formula_1

where

* = the number of civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy with which communication might be possible (i.e. which are on the current past light cone);

and

* = the average rate of star formation in our Galaxy.
* = the fraction of those stars that have planets.
* = the average number of planets that can potentially support life per star that has planets.
* = the fraction of planets that could support life that actually develop life at some point.
* = the fraction of planets with life that go on to develop intelligent life (civilizations).
* = the fraction of civilizations that develop a technology that releases detectable signs of their existence into space.
* = the length of time for which such civilizations release detectable signals into space.

This form of the equation first appeared in Drake&#x27;s 1965 paper.

==History==
In September 1959, physicists Giuseppe Cocconi and Philip Morrison published an article in the journal &quot;Nature&quot; with the provocative title &quot;Searching for Interstellar Communications&quot;. Cocconi and Morrison argued that radio telescopes had become sensitive enough to pick up transmissions that might be broadcast into space by civilizations orbiting other stars. Such messages, they suggested, might be transmitted at a wavelength of 21 cm (1,420.4 MHz). This is the wavelength of radio emission by neutral hydrogen, the most common element in the universe, and they reasoned that other intelligences might see this as a logical landmark in the radio spectrum.

Two months later, Harvard University astronomy professor Harlow Shapley speculated on the number of inhabited planets in the universe, saying &quot;The universe has 10 million, million, million suns (10 followed by 18 zeros) similar to our own. One in a million has planets around it. Only one in a million million has the right combination of chemicals, temperature, water, days and nights to support planetary life as we know it. This calculation arrives at the estimated figure of 100 million worlds where life has been forged by evolution.&quot;

Seven months after Cocconi and Morrison published their article, Drake began searching for extraterrestrial intelligence in an experiment called Project Ozma. It was the first systematic search for signals from communicative extraterrestrial civilizations. Using the dish of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, Green Bank in Green Bank, West Virginia, Drake monitored two nearby Sun-like stars: Epsilon Eridani and Tau Ceti, slowly scanning frequencies close to the 21 cm wavelength for six hours per day from April to July 1960. The project was well designed, inexpensive, and simple by today&#x27;s standards. It detected no signals.

Soon thereafter, Drake hosted the first search for extraterrestrial intelligence conference on detecting their radio signals. The meeting was held at the Green Bank facility in 1961. The equation that bears Drake&#x27;s name arose out of his preparations for the meeting.

The ten attendees were conference organizer J. Peter Pearman, Frank Drake, Philip Morrison, businessman and radio amateur Dana Atchley, chemist Melvin Calvin, astronomer Su-Shu Huang, neuroscientist John C. Lilly, inventor Barney Oliver, astronomer Carl Sagan, and radio-astronomer Otto Struve. These participants called themselves &quot;The Order of the Dolphin&quot; (because of Lilly&#x27;s work on dolphin communication), and commemorated their first meeting with a plaque at the observatory hall.

==Usefulness==

The Drake equation results in a summary of the factors affecting the likelihood that we might detect radio-communication from intelligent extraterrestrial life. The last three parameters, , , and , are not known and are very difficult to estimate, with values ranging over many orders of magnitude (see ). Therefore, the usefulness of the Drake equation is not in the solving, but rather in the contemplation of all the various concepts which scientists must incorporate when considering the question of life elsewhere, and gives the question of life elsewhere a basis for scientific analysis. The equation has helped draw attention to some particular scientific problems related to life in the universe, for example abiogenesis, the development of multi-cellular life, and the development of intelligence itself.

Within the limits of existing human technology, any practical search for distant intelligent life must necessarily be a search for some manifestation of a distant technology. After about 50 years, the Drake equation is still of seminal importance because it is a &#x27;road map&#x27; of what we need to learn in order to solve this fundamental existential question. It also formed the backbone of astrobiology as a science; although speculation is entertained to give context, astrobiology concerns itself primarily with hypotheses that fit firmly into existing scientific theories. Some 50 years of SETI have failed to find anything, even though radio telescopes, receiver techniques, and computational abilities have improved significantly since the early 1960s. SETI efforts since 1961 have conclusively ruled out widespread alien emissions near the 21 cm wavelength of the hydrogen frequency.

==Estimates==

===Original estimates===
There is considerable disagreement on the values of these parameters, but the &#x27;educated guesses&#x27; used by Drake and his colleagues in 1961 were: 
* = 1 yr−1 (1 star formed per year, on the average over the life of the galaxy; this was regarded as conservative)
* = 0.2 to 0.5 (one fifth to one half of all stars formed will have planets)
* = 1 to 5 (stars with planets will have between 1 and 5 planets capable of developing life)
* = 1 (100% of these planets will develop life)
* = 1 (100% of which will develop intelligent life)
* = 0.1 to 0.2 (10–20% of which will be able to communicate)
* = somewhere between 1000 and 100,000,000 years

Inserting the above minimum numbers into the equation gives a minimum N of 20 (see: Range of results). Inserting the maximum numbers gives a maximum of 50,000,000. Drake states that given the uncertainties, the original meeting concluded that , and there were probably between 1000 and 100,000,000 planets with civilizations in the Milky Way Galaxy.

===Current estimates===
This section discusses and attempts to list the best current estimates for the parameters of the Drake equation.
====Rate of star creation in this Galaxy, ====
Calculations in 2010, from NASA and the European Space Agency indicate that the rate of star formation in this Galaxy is about of material per year. To get the number of stars per year, we divide this by the initial mass function (IMF) for stars, where the average new star&#x27;s mass is about . This gives a star formation rate of about 1.5–3 stars per year.

====Fraction of those stars that have planets, ====
Analysis of microlensing surveys, in 2012, has found that may approach 1—that is, stars are orbited by planets as a rule, rather than the exception; and that there are one or more bound planets per Milky Way star.

====Average number of planets that might support life per star that has planets, ====
In November 2013, astronomers reported, based on Kepler space telescope data, that there could be as many as 40 billion Earth-sized planets orbiting in the habitable zones of sun-like stars and red dwarf stars within the Milky Way Galaxy. 11 billion of these estimated planets may be orbiting sun-like stars. Since there are about 100 billion stars in the galaxy, this implies is roughly 0.4. The nearest planet in the habitable zone is Proxima Centauri b, which is as close as about 4.2 light-years away.

The consensus at the Green Bank meeting was that had a minimum value between 3 and 5. Dutch science journalist Govert Schilling has opined that this is optimistic. Even if planets are in the habitable zone, the number of planets with the right proportion of elements is difficult to estimate. Brad Gibson, Yeshe Fenner, and Charley Lineweaver determined that about 10% of star systems in the Milky Way Galaxy are hospitable to life, by having heavy elements, being far from supernovae and being stable for a sufficient time.

The discovery of numerous gas giants in close orbit with their stars has introduced doubt that life-supporting planets commonly survive the formation of their stellar systems. So-called hot Jupiters may migrate from distant orbits to near orbits, in the process disrupting the orbits of habitable planets.

On the other hand, the variety of star systems that might have habitable zones is not just limited to solar-type stars and Earth-sized planets. It is now estimated that even tidally locked planets close to red dwarf stars might have habitable zones, although the flaring behavior of these stars might speak against this. The possibility of life on moons of gas giants (such as Jupiter&#x27;s moon Europa, or Saturn&#x27;s moons Titan and Enceladus) adds further uncertainty to this figure.

The authors of the rare Earth hypothesis propose a number of additional constraints on habitability for planets, including being in galactic zones with suitably low radiation, high star metallicity, and low enough density to avoid excessive asteroid bombardment. They also propose that it is necessary to have a planetary system with large gas giants which provide bombardment protection without a hot Jupiter; and a planet with plate tectonics, a large moon that creates tidal pools, and moderate axial tilt to generate seasonal variation.

====Fraction of the above that actually go on to develop life, ====
Geological evidence from the Earth suggests that may be high; life on Earth appears to have begun around the same time as favorable conditions arose, suggesting that abiogenesis may be relatively common once conditions are right. However, this evidence only looks at the Earth (a single model planet), and contains anthropic bias, as the planet of study was not chosen randomly, but by the living organisms that already inhabit it (ourselves). From a classical hypothesis testing standpoint, without assuming that the underlying distribution of is the same for all planets in the Milky Way, there are zero degrees of freedom, permitting no valid estimates to be made. If life (or evidence of past life) were to be found on Mars, Europa, Enceladus or Titan that developed independently from life on Earth it would imply a value for close to 1. While this would raise the number of degrees of freedom from zero to one, there would remain a great deal of uncertainty on any estimate due to the small sample size, and the chance they are not really independent.

Countering this argument is that there is no evidence for abiogenesis occurring more than once on the Earth—that is, all terrestrial life stems from a common origin. If abiogenesis were more common it would be speculated to have occurred more than once on the Earth. Scientists have searched for this by looking for bacteria that are unrelated to other life on Earth, but none have been found yet. It is also possible that life arose more than once, but that other branches were out-competed, or died in mass extinctions, or were lost in other ways. Biochemists Francis Crick and Leslie Orgel laid special emphasis on this uncertainty: &quot;At the moment we have no means at all of knowing&quot; whether we are &quot;likely to be alone in the galaxy (Universe)&quot; or whether &quot;the galaxy may be pullulating with life of many different forms.&quot; As an alternative to abiogenesis on Earth, they proposed the hypothesis of directed panspermia, which states that Earth life began with &quot;microorganisms sent here deliberately by a technological society on another planet, by means of a special long-range unmanned spaceship&quot;.

In 2020, a paper by scholars at the University of Nottingham proposed an &quot;Astrobiological Copernican&quot; principle, based on the Principle of Mediocrity, and speculated that &quot;intelligent life would form on other [Earth-like] planets like it has on Earth, so within a few billion years life would automatically form as a natural part of evolution&quot;. In the authors&#x27; framework, , , and are all set to a probability of 1 (certainty). Their resultant calculation concludes there are more than thirty current technological civilizations in the galaxy (disregarding error bars).

====Fraction of the above that develops intelligent life, ====
This value remains particularly controversial. Those who favor a low value, such as the biologist Ernst Mayr, point out that of the billions of species that have existed on Earth, only one has become intelligent and from this, infer a tiny value for . Likewise, the Rare Earth hypothesis, notwithstanding their low value for above, also think a low value for dominates the analysis. Those who favor higher values note the generally increasing complexity of life over time, concluding that the appearance of intelligence is almost inevitable, implying an approaching 1. Skeptics point out that the large spread of values in this factor and others make all estimates unreliable. (See Criticism).

In addition, while it appears that life developed soon after the formation of Earth, the Cambrian explosion, in which a large variety of multicellular life forms came into being, occurred a considerable amount of time after the formation of Earth, which suggests the possibility that special conditions were necessary. Some scenarios such as the snowball Earth or research into extinction events have raised the possibility that life on Earth is relatively fragile. Research on any past life on Mars is relevant since a discovery that life did form on Mars but ceased to exist might raise the estimate of but would indicate that in half the known cases, intelligent life did not develop.

Estimates of have been affected by discoveries that the Solar System&#x27;s orbit is circular in the galaxy, at such a distance that it remains out of the spiral arms for tens of millions of years (evading radiation from novae). Also, Earth&#x27;s large moon may aid the evolution of life by stabilizing the planet&#x27;s axis of rotation.

There has been quantitative work to begin to define formula_2. One example is a Bayesian analysis published in 2020. In the conclusion, the author cautions that this study applies to Earth&#x27;s conditions. In Bayesian terms, the study favors the formation of intelligence on a planet with identical conditions to Earth but does not do so with high confidence.

Planetary scientist Pascal Lee of the SETI Institute proposes that this fraction is very low (0.0002). He based this estimate on how long it took Earth to develop intelligent life (1 million years since &quot;Homo erectus&quot; evolved, compared to 4.6 billion years since Earth formed).

====Fraction of the above revealing their existence via signal release into space, ====
For deliberate communication, the one example we have (the Earth) does not do much explicit communication, though there are some efforts covering only a tiny fraction of the stars that might look for human presence. (See Arecibo message, for example). There is considerable speculation why an extraterrestrial civilization might exist but choose not to communicate. However, deliberate communication is not required, and calculations indicate that current or near-future Earth-level technology might well be detectable to civilizations not too much more advanced than present day humans. By this standard, the Earth is a communicating civilization.

Another question is what percentage of civilizations in the galaxy are close enough for us to detect, assuming that they send out signals. For example, existing Earth radio telescopes could only detect Earth radio transmissions from roughly a light year away.

====Lifetime of such a civilization wherein it communicates its signals into space, ====
Michael Shermer estimated as 420 years, based on the duration of sixty historical Earthly civilizations. Using 28 civilizations more recent than the Roman Empire, he calculates a figure of 304 years for &quot;modern&quot; civilizations. It could also be argued from Michael Shermer&#x27;s results that the fall of most of these civilizations was followed by later civilizations that carried on the technologies, so it is doubtful that they are separate civilizations in the context of the Drake equation. In the expanded version, including &quot;reappearance number&quot;, this lack of specificity in defining single civilizations does not matter for the result, since such a civilization turnover could be described as an increase in the &quot;reappearance number&quot; rather than increase in , stating that a civilization reappears in the form of the succeeding cultures. Furthermore, since none could communicate over interstellar space, the method of comparing with historical civilizations could be regarded as invalid.

David Grinspoon has argued that once a civilization has developed enough, it might overcome all threats to its survival. It will then last for an indefinite period of time, making the value for potentially billions of years. If this is the case, then he proposes that the Milky Way Galaxy may have been steadily accumulating advanced civilizations since it formed. He proposes that the last factor be replaced with , where is the fraction of communicating civilizations that become &quot;immortal&quot; (in the sense that they simply do not die out), and representing the length of time during which this process has been going on. This has the advantage that would be a relatively easy-to-discover number, as it would simply be some fraction of the age of the universe.

It has also been hypothesized that once a civilization has learned of a more advanced one, its longevity could increase because it can learn from the experiences of the other.

The astronomer Carl Sagan speculated that all of the terms, except for the lifetime of a civilization, are relatively high and the determining factor in whether there are large or small numbers of civilizations in the universe is the civilization lifetime, or in other words, the ability of technological civilizations to avoid self-destruction. In Sagan&#x27;s case, the Drake equation was a strong motivating factor for his interest in environmental issues and his efforts to warn against the dangers of nuclear warfare. Paleobiologist Olev Vinn suggests that the lifetime of most technological civilizations is brief due to inherited behavior patterns present in all intelligent organisms. These behaviors, incompatible with civilized conditions, inevitably lead to self-destruction soon after the emergence of advanced technologies.

An intelligent civilization might not be organic, as some have suggested that artificial general intelligence may replace humanity.

===Range of results===
As many skeptics have pointed out, the Drake equation can give a very wide range of values, depending on the assumptions, as the values used in portions of the Drake equation are not well established. In particular, the result can be , meaning we are likely alone in the galaxy, or , implying there are many civilizations we might contact. One of the few points of wide agreement is that the presence of humanity implies a probability of intelligence arising of greater than zero.

As an example of a low estimate, combining NASA&#x27;s star formation rates, the rare Earth hypothesis value of , Mayr&#x27;s view on intelligence arising, Drake&#x27;s view of communication, and Shermer&#x27;s estimate of lifetime:
:, , , [Drake, above], and years
gives:
i.e., suggesting that we are probably alone in this galaxy, and possibly in the observable universe.

On the other hand, with larger values for each of the parameters above, values of can be derived that are greater than 1. The following higher values that have been proposed for each of the parameters:
:, , , , , [Drake, above], and years
Use of these parameters gives:

Monte Carlo simulations of estimates of the Drake equation factors based on a stellar and planetary model of the Milky Way have resulted in the number of civilizations varying by a factor of 100.

===Possible former technological civilizations===
In 2016, Adam Frank and Woodruff Sullivan modified the Drake equation to determine just how unlikely the event of a technological species arising on a given habitable planet must be, to give the result that Earth hosts the &quot;only&quot; technological species that has &quot;ever&quot; arisen, for two cases: (a) this Galaxy, and (b) the universe as a whole. By asking this different question, one removes the lifetime and simultaneous communication uncertainties. Since the numbers of habitable planets per star can today be reasonably estimated, the only remaining unknown in the Drake equation is the probability that a habitable planet &quot;ever&quot; develops a technological species over its lifetime. For Earth to have the only technological species that has ever occurred in the universe, they calculate the probability of any given habitable planet ever developing a technological species must be less than . Similarly, for Earth to have been the only case of hosting a technological species over the history of this Galaxy, the odds of a habitable zone planet ever hosting a technological species must be less than (about 1 in 60 billion). The figure for the universe implies that it is extremely unlikely that Earth hosts the only technological species that has ever occurred. On the other hand, for this Galaxy one must think that fewer than 1 in 60 billion habitable planets develop a technological species for there not to have been at least a second case of such a species over the past history of this Galaxy.

==Modifications==
As many observers have pointed out, the Drake equation is a very simple model that omits potentially relevant parameters, and many changes and modifications to the equation have been proposed. One line of modification, for example, attempts to account for the uncertainty inherent in many of the terms.
Combining the estimates of the original six factors by major researchers via a Monte Carlo procedure leads to a best value for the non-longevity factors of 0.85 1/years. This result differs insignificantly from the estimate of unity given both by Drake and the Cyclops report.

Others note that the Drake equation ignores many concepts that might be relevant to the odds of contacting other civilizations. For example, David Brin states: &quot;The Drake equation merely speaks of the number of sites at which ETIs spontaneously arise. The equation says nothing directly about the contact cross-section between an ETIS and contemporary human society&quot;. Because it is the contact cross-section that is of interest to the SETI community, many additional factors and modifications of the Drake equation have been proposed.

;Colonization : It has been proposed to generalize the Drake equation to include additional effects of alien civilizations colonizing other star systems. Each original site expands with an expansion velocity , and establishes additional sites that survive for a lifetime . The result is a more complex set of 3 equations.

;Reappearance factor : The Drake equation may furthermore be multiplied by &quot;how many times&quot; an intelligent civilization may occur on planets where it has happened once. Even if an intelligent civilization reaches the end of its lifetime after, for example, 10,000 years, life may still prevail on the planet for billions of years, permitting the next civilization to evolve. Thus, several civilizations may come and go during the lifespan of one and the same planet. Thus, if is the average number of times a new civilization reappears on the same planet where a previous civilization once has appeared and ended, then the total number of civilizations on such a planet would be , which is the actual &quot;reappearance factor&quot; added to the equation.

:The factor depends on what generally is the cause of civilization extinction. If it is generally by temporary uninhabitability, for example a nuclear winter, then may be relatively high. On the other hand, if it is generally by permanent uninhabitability, such as stellar evolution, then may be almost zero. In the case of total life extinction, a similar factor may be applicable for , that is, &quot;how many times&quot; life may appear on a planet where it has appeared once.

;METI factor : Alexander Zaitsev said that to be in a communicative phase and emit dedicated messages are not the same. For example, humans, although being in a communicative phase, are not a communicative civilization; we do not practise such activities as the purposeful and regular transmission of interstellar messages. For this reason, he suggested introducing the METI factor (messaging to extraterrestrial intelligence) to the classical Drake equation. He defined the factor as &quot;the fraction of communicative civilizations with clear and non-paranoid planetary consciousness&quot;, or alternatively expressed, the fraction of communicative civilizations that actually engage in deliberate interstellar transmission.

:The METI factor is somewhat misleading since active, purposeful transmission of messages by a civilization is not required for them to receive a broadcast sent by another that is seeking first contact. It is merely required they have capable and compatible receiver systems operational; however, this is a variable humans cannot accurately estimate.

;Biogenic gases : Astronomer Sara Seager proposed a revised equation that focuses on the search for planets with biosignature gases. These gases are produced by living organisms that can accumulate in a planet atmosphere to levels that can be detected with remote space telescopes.

:The Seager equation looks like this:
::formula_3
:where:
:: = the number of planets with detectable signs of life
:: = the number of stars observed
:: = the fraction of stars that are quiet
:: = the fraction of stars with rocky planets in the habitable zone
:: = the fraction of those planets that can be observed
:: = the fraction that have life
:: = the fraction on which life produces a detectable signature gas

:Seager stresses, &quot;We&#x27;re not throwing out the Drake Equation, which is really a different topic,&quot; explaining, &quot;Since Drake came up with the equation, we have discovered thousands of exoplanets. We as a community have had our views revolutionized as to what could possibly be out there. And now we have a real question on our hands, one that&#x27;s not related to intelligent life: Can we detect any signs of life in any way in the very near future?&quot;

;Carl Sagan&#x27;s version of the Drake equation:American astronomer Carl Sagan made some modifications in the Drake equation and presented it in the 1980 program &quot;&quot;. The modified equation is shown below

formula_4
where

* = the number of civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy with which communication might be possible (i.e. which are on the current past light cone);

and

* = Number of stars in the Milky Way Galaxy 
* = the fraction of those stars that have planets.
* = the average number of planets that can potentially support life per star that has planets.
* = the fraction of planets that could support life that actually develop life at some point.
* = the fraction of planets with life that go on to develop intelligent life (civilizations).
* = the fraction of civilizations that develop a technology that releases detectable signs of their existence into space.
* = fraction of a planetary lifetime graced by a technological civilization

==Criticism==
Criticism of the Drake equation is varied. Firstly, many of the terms in the equation are largely or entirely based on conjecture. Star formation rates are well-known, and the incidence of planets has a sound theoretical and observational basis, but the other terms in the equation become very speculative. The uncertainties revolve around the present day understanding of the evolution of life, intelligence, and civilization, not physics. No statistical estimates are possible for some of the parameters, where only one example is known. The net result is that the equation cannot be used to draw firm conclusions of any kind, and the resulting margin of error is huge, far beyond what some consider acceptable or meaningful.

Others point out that the equation was formulated before our understanding of the universe had matured. Astrophysicist Ethan Siegel, said:
One reply to such criticisms is that even though the Drake equation currently involves speculation about unmeasured parameters, it was intended as a way to stimulate dialogue on these topics. Then the focus becomes how to proceed experimentally. Indeed, Drake originally formulated the equation merely as an agenda for discussion at the Green Bank conference.

===Fermi paradox===

A civilization lasting for tens of millions of years could be able to spread throughout the galaxy, even at the slow speeds foreseeable with present-day technology. However, no confirmed signs of civilizations or intelligent life elsewhere have been found, either in this Galaxy or in the observable universe of 2 trillion galaxies. According to this line of thinking, the tendency to fill (or at least explore) all available territory seems to be a universal trait of living things, so the Earth should have already been colonized, or at least visited, but no evidence of this exists. Hence Fermi&#x27;s question &quot;Where is everybody?&quot;.

A large number of explanations have been proposed to explain this lack of contact; a book published in 2015 elaborated on 75 different explanations. In terms of the Drake Equation, the explanations can be divided into three classes:

*Few intelligent civilizations ever arise. This is an argument that at least one of the first few terms, , has a low value. The most common suspect is , but explanations such as the rare Earth hypothesis argue that is the small term.
*Intelligent civilizations exist, but we see no evidence, meaning is small. Typical arguments include that civilizations are too far apart, it is too expensive to spread throughout the galaxy, civilizations broadcast signals for only a brief period of time, communication is dangerous, and many others.
*The lifetime of intelligent, communicative civilizations is short, meaning the value of is small. Drake suggested that a large number of extraterrestrial civilizations would form, and he further speculated that the lack of evidence of such civilizations may be because technological civilizations tend to disappear rather quickly. Typical explanations include it is the nature of intelligent life to destroy itself, it is the nature of intelligent life to destroy others, they tend to be destroyed by natural events, and others.

These lines of reasoning lead to the Great Filter hypothesis, which states that since there are no observed extraterrestrial civilizations despite the vast number of stars, at least one step in the process must be acting as a filter to reduce the final value. According to this view, either it is very difficult for intelligent life to arise, or the lifetime of technologically advanced civilizations, or the period of time they reveal their existence must be relatively short.

An analysis by Anders Sandberg, Eric Drexler and Toby Ord suggests &quot;a substantial &quot;ex ante&quot; (predicted) probability of there being no other intelligent life in our observable universe&quot;.

==In popular culture==
The equation was cited by Gene Roddenberry as supporting the multiplicity of inhabited planets shown on &quot;Star Trek&quot;, the television series he created. However, Roddenberry did not have the equation with him, and he was forced to &quot;invent&quot; it for his original proposal. The invented equation created by Roddenberry is:

formula_5

Regarding Roddenberry&#x27;s fictional version of the equation, Drake himself commented that a number raised to the first power is just the number itself.

A commemorative plate on NASA&#x27;s Europa Clipper mission, planned for launch in October 2024, features a poem by the U.S. Poet Laureate Ada Limón, waveforms of the word &#x27;water&#x27; in 103 languages, a schematic of the water hole, the Drake equation, and a portrait of planetary scientist Ron Greeley on it.

The track &quot;Abiogenesis&quot; on the Carbon Based Lifeforms album World of Sleepers features the Drake equation in a spoken voice-over.

<doc id="8914" wikidata="Q3766" url="?curid=8914" title="Damascus">
<text>Damascus ( , ; ) is the capital and largest city of Syria. It is the oldest capital in the world and, according to some, the fourth holiest city in Islam. Known colloquially in Syria as () and dubbed, poetically, the &quot;City of Jasmine&quot; ( ), Damascus is a major cultural center of the Levant and the Arab world.

Situated in southwestern Syria, Damascus is the center of a large metropolitan area. Nestled among the eastern foothills of the Anti-Lebanon mountain range inland from the eastern shore of the Mediterranean on a plateau above sea level, Damascus experiences an arid climate because of the rain shadow effect. The Barada River flows through Damascus.

Damascus is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. First settled in the 3rd millennium BC, it was chosen as the capital of the Umayyad Caliphate from 661 to 750. After the victory of the Abbasid dynasty, the seat of Islamic power was moved to Baghdad. Damascus saw its importance decline throughout the Abbasid era, only to regain significant importance in the Ayyubid and Mamluk periods. 

Today, it is the seat of the central government of Syria. , eight years into the Syrian civil war, Damascus was named the least livable city out of 140 global cities in the Global Liveability Ranking. , it was the least livable out of 173 global cities in the same Global Liveability Ranking. In 2017, two new development projects have been launched in Damascus to build new residential districts, Marota City and Basillia City to symbolize post-war reconstruction.

==Names and etymology==
The name of Damascus first appeared in the geographical list of Thutmose III as () in the 15th century BC.
The etymology of the ancient name is uncertain. It is attested as () in Akkadian, () in Egyptian, () in Old Aramaic and () in Biblical Hebrew. A number of Akkadian spellings are found in the Amarna letters, from the 14th century BC: (), (), and ().

Later Aramaic spellings of the name often include an intrusive &quot;resh&quot; (letter &quot;r&quot;), perhaps influenced by the root , meaning &quot;dwelling&quot;. Thus, the English and Latin name of the city is , which was imported from Greek and originated from the Qumranic (), and () in Syriac, meaning &quot;a well-watered land&quot;.

In Arabic, the city is called Dimashq ( ). The city is also known as by the citizens of Damascus, of Syria and other Arab neighbors and Turkey (). is an Arabic term for &quot;Levant&quot; and for &quot;Syria&quot;; the latter, and particularly the historical region of Syria, is called (, ). The latter term etymologically means &quot;land of the left-hand side&quot; or &quot;the north&quot;, as someone in the Hijaz facing east, oriented to the sunrise, will find the north to the left. This is contrasted with the name of Yemen ( ), correspondingly meaning &quot;the right-hand side&quot; or &quot;the south&quot;. The variation (&#x27;), of the more typical (), is also attested in Old South Arabian, (), with the same semantic development.

==Geography==
Damascus was built in a strategic site on a plateau above sea level and about inland from the Mediterranean, sheltered by the Anti-Lebanon Mountains, supplied with water by the Barada River, and at a crossroads between trade routes: the north–south route connecting Egypt with Asia Minor, and the east–west cross-desert route connecting Lebanon with the Euphrates river valley. The Anti-Lebanon Mountains mark the border between Syria and Lebanon. The range has peaks of over and blocks precipitation from the Mediterranean Sea, so the region of Damascus is sometimes subject to droughts. However, in ancient times, the Barada River mitigated this, which originates from mountain streams fed by melting snow. Damascus is surrounded by the Ghouta, irrigated farmland where many vegetables, cereals, and fruits have been farmed since ancient times. Maps of Roman Syria indicate that the Barada River emptied into a lake of some size east of Damascus. Today it is called Bahira Atayba, the hesitant lake because in years of severe drought, it does not even exist.

The modern city has an area of , out of which is urban, while Jabal Qasioun occupies the rest.
The old city of Damascus, enclosed by the city walls, lies on the south bank of the river Barada which is almost dry ( left). To the southeast, north, and northeast it is surrounded by suburban areas whose history stretches back to the Middle Ages: Midan in the southwest, Sarouja and Imara in the north and north-west. These neighborhoods originally arose on roads leading out of the city, near the tombs of religious figures. In the 19th century outlying villages developed on the slopes of Jabal Qasioun, overlooking the city, already the site of the al-Salihiyah neighborhood centered on the important shrine of medieval Andalusian Sheikh and philosopher Ibn Arabi. These new neighborhoods were initially settled by Kurdish soldiery and Muslim refugees from the Europe regions of the Ottoman Empire which had fallen under Christian rule. Thus they were known as &quot;al-Akrad&quot; &quot;(the Kurds)&quot; and &quot;al-Muhajirin&quot; &quot;(the migrants)&quot;. They lay north of the old city.

From the late 19th century on, a modern administrative and commercial center began to spring up to the west of the old city, around the Barada, centered on the area known as al-Marjeh or &quot;the meadow&quot;. Al-Marjeh soon became the name of what was initially the central square of modern Damascus, with the city hall in it. The courts of justice, post office, and railway station stood on higher ground slightly to the south. A Europeanized residential quarter soon began to be built on the road leading between al-Marjeh and al-Salihiyah. The commercial and administrative center of the new city gradually shifted northwards slightly towards this area.

In the 20th century, newer suburbs developed north of the Barada, and to some extent to the south, invading the Ghouta oasis. In 1956–1957, the new neighborhood of Yarmouk became a second home to many Palestinian refugees. City planners preferred to preserve the Ghouta as far as possible, and in the later 20th century some of the main areas of development were to the north, in the western Mezzeh neighborhood and most recently along the Barada valley in Dummar in the northwest and on the slopes of the mountains at Barzeh in the north-east. Poorer areas, often built without official approval, have mostly developed south of the main city.

Damascus used to be surrounded by an oasis, the Ghouta region (), watered by the Barada river. The Fijeh spring, west along the Barada valley, used to provide the city with drinking water, and various sources to the west are tapped by water contractors. The flow of the Barada dropped with the rapid expansion of housing and industry in the city and it is almost dry. The lower aquifers are polluted by the city&#x27;s runoff from heavily used roads, industry, and sewage.

===Climate===
Damascus has a cool arid climate (&quot;BWk&quot;) in the Köppen-Geiger system, due to the rain shadow effect of the Anti-Lebanon Mountains and the prevailing ocean currents. Summers are prolonged, dry, and hot with less humidity. Winters are cool and somewhat rainy; snowfall is infrequent. Autumn is brief and mild, but has the most drastic temperature change, unlike spring where the transition to summer is more gradual and steady. Annual rainfall is around , occurring from October to May.

==History==
===Early settlement===
Carbon-14 dating at Tell Ramad, on the outskirts of Damascus, suggests that the site may have been occupied since the second half of the seventh millennium BC, possibly around 6300 BC. However, evidence of settlement in the wider Barada basin dating back to 9000 BC exists, although no large-scale settlement was present within Damascus&#x27; walls until the second millennium BC.

===Late Bronze===
Some of the earliest Egyptian records are from 1350 BC Amarna letters when Damascus (called &quot;Dimasqu&quot;) was ruled by king Biryawaza. The Damascus region, as well as the rest of Syria, became a battleground circa 1260 BC, between the Hittites from the north and the Egyptians from the south, ending with a signed treaty between Hattusili III and Ramesses II where the former handed over control of the Damascus area to Ramesses II in 1259 BC. The arrival of the Sea Peoples, around 1200 BC, marked the end of the Bronze Age in the region and brought about new development of warfare. Damascus was only a peripheral part of this picture, which mostly affected the larger population centers of ancient Syria. However, these events contributed to the development of Damascus as a new influential center that emerged with the transition from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age.

Damascus is mentioned in Genesis 14:15 as existing at the time of the War of the Kings. According to the 1st-century Jewish historian Flavius Josephus in his twenty-one volume &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot;, Damascus (along with Trachonitis), was founded by Uz, the son of Aram. In Antiquities i. 7, Josephus reports:

===Aram-Damascus===
Damascus is first documented as an important city during the arrival of the Aramaeans, a Semitic people, in the 11th century BC. By the start of the first millennium BC, several Aramaic kingdoms were formed, as Aramaeans abandoned their nomadic lifestyle and formed federated tribal states. One of these kingdoms was Aram-Damascus, centered on its capital Damascus. The Aramaeans who entered the city without battle, adopted the name &quot;Dimashqu&quot; for their new home. Noticing the agricultural potential of the still-undeveloped and sparsely populated area, they established the water distribution system of Damascus by constructing canals and tunnels which maximized the efficiency of the river Barada. The Romans and the Umayyads later improved the same network, and still forms the basis of the water system of the old part of the city today. The Aramaeans initially turned Damascus into an outpost of a loose federation of Aramaean tribes, known as Aram-Zobah, based in the Beqaa Valley.

The city would gain pre-eminence in southern Syria when Ezron, the claimant to Aram-Zobah&#x27;s throne who was denied kingship of the federation, fled Beqaa and captured Damascus by force in 965 BC. Ezron overthrew the city&#x27;s tribal governor and founded the independent entity of Aram-Damascus. As this new state expanded south, it prevented the Kingdom of Israel from spreading north and the two kingdoms soon clashed as they both sought to dominate trading hegemony in the east. Under Ezron&#x27;s grandson, Ben-Hadad I (880–841 BC), and his successor Hazael, Damascus annexed Bashan (modern-day Hauran region), and went on the offensive with Israel. This conflict continued until the early 8th century BC when Ben-Hadad II was captured by Israel after unsuccessfully besieging Samaria. As a result, he granted Israel trading rights in Damascus.

Another possible reason for the treaty between Aram-Damascus and Israel was the common threat of the Neo-Assyrian Empire which was attempting to expand into the Mediterranean coast. In 853 BC, King Hadadezer of Damascus led a Levantine coalition, that included forces from the northern Aram-Hamath kingdom and troops supplied by King Ahab of Israel, in the Battle of Qarqar against the Neo-Assyrian army. Aram-Damascus came out victorious, temporarily preventing the Assyrians from encroaching into Syria. However, after Hadadzezer was killed by his successor, Hazael, the Levantine alliance collapsed. Aram-Damascus attempted to invade Israel but was interrupted by the renewed Assyrian invasion. Hazael ordered a retreat to the walled part of Damascus while the Assyrians plundered the remainder of the kingdom. Unable to enter the city, they declared their supremacy in the Hauran and Beqa&#x27;a valleys.

By the 8th century BC, Damascus was practically engulfed by the Assyrians and entered a Dark Age. Nonetheless, it remained the economic and cultural center of the Near East as well as the Arameaen resistance. In 727, a revolt took place in the city but was put down by Assyrian forces. After Assyria led by Tiglath-Pileser III went on a wide-scale campaign of quelling revolts throughout Syria, Damascus became subjugated by their rule. A positive effect of this was stability for the city and benefits from the spice and incense trade with Arabia. In 694 BC, the town was called &quot;Šaʾimerišu&quot; (Akkadian: 𒐼𒄿𒈨𒊑𒋙𒌋) and its governor was named &quot;Ilu-issīya&quot;. However, Assyrian authority was dwindling by 609–605 BC, and Syria-Palestine was falling into the orbit of Pharaoh Necho II&#x27;s Egypt. In 572 BC, all of Syria had been conquered by Nebuchadnezzar II of the Neo-Babylonians, but the status of Damascus under Babylon is relatively unknown.

===Hellenistic period===
Damascus was conquered by Alexander the Great. After the death of Alexander in 323 BC, Damascus became the site of a struggle between the Seleucid and Ptolemaic empires. The control of the city passed frequently from one empire to the other. Seleucus I Nicator, one of Alexander&#x27;s generals, made Antioch the capital of his vast empire, which led to the decline of Damascus&#x27; importance compared with new Seleucid cities such as Syrian Laodicea in the north. Later, Demetrius III Philopator rebuilt the city according to the Greek hippodamian system and renamed it &quot;Demetrias&quot;.

=== Roman period ===
In 64 BC, the Roman general Pompey annexed the western part of Syria. The Romans occupied Damascus and subsequently incorporated it into the league of ten cities known as the Decapolis which themselves were incorporated into the province of Syria and granted autonomy.

The city of Damascus was entirely redesigned by the Romans after Pompey conquered the region. Still today the Old Town of Damascus retains the rectangular shape of the Roman city, with its two main axes: the Decumanus Maximus (east-west; known today as the &quot;Via Recta&quot;) and the Cardo (north-south), the Decumanus being about twice as long. The Romans built a monumental gate which still survives at the eastern end of Decumanus Maximus. The gate originally had three arches: the central arch was for chariots while the side arches were for pedestrians.
In 23 BC, Herod the Great was given lands controlled by Zenodorus by Caesar Augustus and some scholars believe that Herod was also granted control of Damascus as well. The control of Damascus reverted to Syria either upon the death of Herod the Great or was part of the lands given to Herod Philip which were given to Syria with his death in 33/34 AD.

It is speculated that control of Damascus was gained by Aretas IV Philopatris of Nabatea between the death of Herod Philip in 33/34 AD and the death of Aretas in 40 AD but there is substantial evidence against Aretas controlling the city before 37 AD and many reasons why it could not have been a gift from Caligula between 37 and 40 AD. In fact, all these theories stem not from any actual evidence outside the New Testament but rather &quot;a certain understanding of 2 Corinthians 11:32&quot; and in reality &quot;neither from archaeological evidence, secular-historical sources, nor New Testament texts can Nabatean sovereignty over Damascus in the first century AD be proven.&quot; Roman emperor Trajan who annexed the Nabataean Kingdom, creating the province of Arabia Petraea, had previously been in Damascus, as his father Marcus Ulpius Traianus served as governor of Syria from 73 to 74 AD, where he met the Nabatean architect and engineer, Apollodorus of Damascus, who joined him in Rome when he was a consul in 91 AD, and later built several monuments during the 2nd century AD.

Damascus became a metropolis by the beginning of the 2nd century and in 222 it was upgraded to a &quot;colonia&quot; by the Emperor Septimius Severus. During the &quot;Pax Romana&quot;, Damascus and the Roman province of Syria in general began to prosper. Damascus&#x27;s importance as a caravan city was evident with the trade routes from southern Arabia, Palmyra, Petra, and the Silk Road all converging on it. The city satisfied the Roman demands for eastern luxuries. Circa 125 AD the Roman emperor Hadrian promoted the city of Damascus to &quot;Metropolis of Coele-Syria&quot;.

Little remains of the architecture of the Romans, but the town planning of the old city did have a lasting effect. The Roman architects brought together the Greek and Aramaean foundations of the city and fused them into a new layout measuring approximately , surrounded by a city wall. The city wall contained seven gates, but only the eastern gate, Bab Sharqi, remains from the Roman period. Roman Damascus lies mostly at depths of up to below the modern city.

The old borough of Bab Tuma was developed at the end of the Roman/Byzantine era by the local Eastern Orthodox community. According to the Acts of the Apostles, Saint Paul and Saint Thomas both lived in that neighborhood. Roman Catholic historians also consider Bab Tuma to be the birthplace of several Popes such as John V and Gregory III. Accordingly, there was a community of Jewish Christians who converted to Christianity with the advent of Saint Paul&#x27;s proselytization.

During the Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628, the city was besieged and captured by Shahrbaraz in 613, along with a large number of Byzantine troops as prisoners, and was in Sasanian hands until near the end of the war.

===Rashidun period===
The Prophet Muhammad&#x27;s first indirect interaction with the people of Damascus was when he sent a letter, through his companion Shiya ibn Wahab, to Harith ibn Abi Shamir, the king of Damascus. The letter stated: &quot;Peace be upon him who follows true guidance. Be informed that my religion shall prevail everywhere. You should accept Islam, and whatever under your command shall remain yours.&quot;
After most of the Syrian countryside was conquered by the Rashidun Caliphate during the reign of Caliph Umar (), Damascus itself was conquered by the Arab Muslim general Khalid ibn al-Walid in August–September 634 CE. His army had previously attempted to capture the city in April 634 but without success. With Damascus now in Muslim-Arab hands, the Byzantines, alarmed at the loss of their most prestigious city in the Near East, had decided to wrest back control of it. Under Emperor Heraclius, the Byzantines fielded an army superior to that of the Rashidun in manpower. They advanced into southern Syria during the spring of 636 and consequently Khalid ibn al-Walid&#x27;s forces withdrew from Damascus to prepare for renewed confrontation. In August, the two sides met along the Yarmouk River where they fought a major battle which ended in a decisive Muslim victory, solidifying Muslim rule in Syria and Palestine. While the Muslims administered the city, the population of Damascus remained mostly Christian—Eastern Orthodox and Monophysite—with a growing community of Muslims from Mecca, Medina, and the Syrian Desert. The governor assigned to the city which had been chosen as the capital of Islamic Syria was Mu&#x27;awiya I.

=== Umayyad and Abbasid periods ===
Following the fourth Rashidun caliph Ali&#x27;s death in 661, Mu&#x27;awiya was chosen as the caliph of the expanding Islamic empire. Because of the vast amounts of assets his clan, the Umayyads, owned in the city and because of its traditional economic and social links with the Hijaz as well as the Christian Arab tribes of the region, Mu&#x27;awiya established Damascus as the capital of the entire Caliphate. With the ascension of Caliph Abd al-Malik in 685, an Islamic coinage system was introduced and all of the surplus revenue of the Caliphate&#x27;s provinces were forwarded to the treasury of Damascus. Arabic was also established as the official language, giving the Muslim minority of the city an advantage over the Aramaic-speaking Christians in administrative affairs.

Abd al-Malik&#x27;s successor, al-Walid initiated the construction of the Grand Mosque of Damascus (known as the Umayyad Mosque) in 706. The site originally had been the Christian Cathedral of St. John and the Muslims maintained the building&#x27;s dedication to John the Baptist. By 715, the mosque was complete. Al-Walid died that same year and he was succeeded at first by Suleiman ibn Abd al-Malik and then by Umar II, who each ruled for brief periods before the reign of Hisham in 724. With these successions, the status of Damascus was gradually weakening as Suleiman had chosen Ramla as his residence and later Hisham chose Resafa. Following the murder of the latter in 743, the Caliphate of the Umayyads—which by then stretched from Spain to India— was crumbling as a result of widespread revolts. During the reign of Marwan II in 744, the capital of the empire was relocated to Harran in the northern Jazira region.

On 25 August 750, the Abbasids, having already beaten the Umayyads in the Battle of the Zab in Iraq, conquered Damascus after facing little resistance. With the heralding of the Abbasid Caliphate, Damascus became eclipsed and subordinated by Baghdad, the new Islamic capital. Within the first six months of Abbasid rule, revolts began erupting in the city, albeit too isolated and unfocused to present a viable threat. Nonetheless, the last of the prominent Umayyads were executed, the traditional officials of Damascus were ostracised, and army generals from the city were dismissed. Afterwards, the Umayyad family cemetery was desecrated and the city walls were torn down, reducing Damascus into a provincial town of little importance. It roughly disappeared from written records for the next century and the only significant improvement of the city was the Abbasid-built treasury dome in the Umayyad Mosque in 789. In 811, distant remnants of the Umayyad dynasty staged a strong uprising in Damascus that was eventually put down.

On 24 November 847, a multiple earthquake struck and destroyed Damascus, causing the lives of 70,000 people in estimated deaths.

Ahmad ibn Tulun, a dissenting Turkish wali appointed by the Abbasids, conquered Syria, including Damascus, from his overlords in 878–79. In an act of respect for the previous Umayyad rulers, he erected a shrine on the site of Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s grave in the city. Tulunid rule of Damascus was brief, lasting only until 906 before being replaced by the Qarmatians who were adherents of Shia Islam. Due to their inability to control the vast amount of land they occupied, the Qarmatians withdrew from Damascus and a new dynasty, the Ikhshidids, took control of the city. They maintained the independence of Damascus from the Arab Hamdanid dynasty of Aleppo 967. A period of instability in the city followed, with a Qarmatian raid in 968, a Byzantine raid in 970, and increasing pressures from the Fatimids in the south and the Hamdanids in the north.

The Shia Fatimids gained control in 970, inflaming hostilities between them and the Sunni Arabs of the city who frequently revolted. A Turk, Alptakin drove out the Fatimids five years later, and through diplomacy, prevented the Byzantines during the Syrian campaigns of John Tzimiskes from attempting to annex the city. However, by 977, the Fatimids under Caliph al-Aziz, wrested back control of the city and tamed Sunni dissidents. The Arab geographer, al-Muqaddasi, visited Damascus in 985, remarking that the architecture and infrastructure of the city were &quot;magnificent&quot;, but living conditions were awful. Under al-Aziz, the city saw a brief period of stability that ended with the reign of al-Hakim (996–1021). In 998, hundreds of Damascus citizens were rounded up and executed by him for incitement. Three years after al-Hakim&#x27;s mysterious disappearance, a rebellion was initiated in southern Syria against the Fatimids, but was stifled by the Fatimid Turkish governor of Syria and Palestine, Anushtakin al-Duzbari, in 1029. This victory gave the latter mastery over Syria, displeasing his Fatimid overlords, but gaining the admiration of Damascus&#x27; citizens. He was exiled by Fatimid authorities to Aleppo where he died in 1041. From that date to 1063, there are no known records of the city&#x27;s history. By then, Damascus lacked a city administration, had an enfeebled economy, and a greatly reduced population.

===Seljuq and Ayyubid periods===

With the arrival of the Seljuq Turks in the late 11th century, Damascus again became the capital of independent states. It was ruled by Abu Sa&#x27;id Taj ad-Dawla Tutush I starting in 1079 and he was succeeded by his son Abu Nasr Duqaq in 1095. The Seljuqs established a court in Damascus and a systematic reversal of Shia inroads in the city. The city also saw an expansion of religious life through private endowments financing religious institutions (&quot;madrasas&quot;) and hospitals (&quot;maristans&quot;). Damascus soon became one of the most important centers of propagating Islamic thought in the Muslim world. After Duqaq died in 1104, his mentor (&quot;atabeg&quot;), Toghtekin, took control of Damascus and the Burid line of the Seljuq dynasty. Under Duqaq and Toghtekin, Damascus experienced stability, elevated status, and a revived role in commerce. In addition, the city&#x27;s Sunni majority enjoyed being a part of the larger Sunni framework effectively governed by various Turkic dynasties who in turn were under the moral authority of the Baghdad-based Abbasids.

While the rulers of Damascus were preoccupied in conflict with their fellow Seljuqs in Aleppo and Diyarbakir, the Crusaders, who arrived in the Levant in 1097, conquered Jerusalem, Mount Lebanon and Palestine. Duqaq seemed to have been content with Crusader&#x27;s rule as a buffer between his dominion and the Fatimid Caliphate of Egypt. Toghtekin, however, saw the Western invaders as a viable threat to Damascus which, at the time, nominally included Homs, the Beqaa Valley, Hauran, and the Golan Heights as part of its territories. With military support from Sharaf al-Din Mawdud of Mosul, Toghtekin managed to halt Crusader raids in the Golan and Hauran. Mawdud was assassinated in the Umayyad Mosque in 1109, depriving Damascus of northern Muslim backing and forcing Toghtekin to agree to a truce with the Crusaders in 1110. In 1126, the Crusader army led by Baldwin II fought Burid forces led by Toghtekin at Marj al-Saffar near Damascus; however, despite their tactical victory, the Crusaders failed in their objective to capture Damascus.
Following Toghtekin&#x27;s death in 1128, his son, Taj al-Muluk Buri, became the nominal ruler of Damascus. Coincidentally, the Seljuq prince of Mosul, Imad al-Din Zengi, took power in Aleppo and gained a mandate from the Abbasids to extend his authority to Damascus. In 1129, around 6,000 Isma&#x27;ili Muslims were killed in the city along with their leaders. The Sunnis were provoked by rumors alleging there was a plot by the Isma&#x27;ilis, who controlled the strategic fort at Banias, to aid the Crusaders in capturing Damascus in return for control of Tyre. Soon after the massacre, the Crusaders aimed to take advantage of the unstable situation and launch an assault against Damascus with nearly 2,000 knights and 10,000 infantry. However, Buri allied with Zengi and managed to prevent their army from reaching the city. Buri was assassinated by Isma&#x27;ili agents in 1132; he was succeeded by his son, Shams al-Mulk Isma&#x27;il who ruled tyrannically until he was murdered in 1135 on secret orders from his mother, Safwat al-Mulk Zumurrud; Isma&#x27;il&#x27;s brother, Shihab al-Din Mahmud, replaced him. Meanwhile, Zengi, intent on putting Damascus under his control, married Safwat al-Mulk in 1138. Mahmud&#x27;s reign then ended in 1139 after he was killed for relatively unknown reasons by members of his family. Mu&#x27;in al-Din Unur, his &quot;mamluk&quot; (&quot;slave soldier&quot;) took effective power of the city, prompting Zengi—with Safwat al-Mulk&#x27;s backing—to lay siege against Damascus the same year. In response, Damascus allied with the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem to resist Zengi&#x27;s forces. Consequently, Zengi withdrew his army and focused on campaigns against northern Syria.

In 1144, Zengi conquered Edessa, a crusader stronghold, which led to a new crusade from Europe in 1148. In the meantime, Zengi was assassinated and his territory was divided among his sons, one of whom, Nur ad-Din, emir of Aleppo, made an alliance with Damascus. When the European crusaders arrived, they and the nobles of Jerusalem agreed to attack Damascus. Their siege, however, was a complete failure. When the city seemed to be on the verge of collapse, the crusader army suddenly moved against another section of the walls and was driven back. By 1154, Damascus was firmly under Nur ad-Din&#x27;s control.

In 1164, King Amalric of Jerusalem invaded Fatimid Egypt, requested help from Nur ad-Din. The Nur ad-Din sent his general Shirkuh, and in 1166 Amalric was defeated at the Battle of al-Babein. When Shirkuh died in 1169, he was succeeded by his nephew Yusuf, better known as Saladin, who defeated a joint crusader-Byzantine siege of Damietta. Saladin eventually overthrew the Fatimid caliphs and established himself as Sultan of Egypt. He also began to assert his independence from Nur ad-Din, and with the death of both Amalric and Nur ad-Din in 1174, he was well-placed to begin exerting control over Damascus and Nur ad-Din&#x27;s other Syrian possessions. In 1177 Saladin was defeated by the crusaders at the Battle of Montgisard, despite his numerical superiority. Saladin also besieged Kerak in 1183, but was forced to withdraw. He finally launched a full invasion of Jerusalem in 1187 and annihilated the crusader army at the Battle of Hattin in July. Acre fell to Saladin soon after, and Jerusalem itself was captured in October. These events shocked Europe, resulting in the Third Crusade in 1189, led by Richard I of England, Philip II of France and Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor, though the last drowned en route.

The surviving crusaders, joined by new arrivals from Europe, put Acre to a lengthy siege which lasted until 1191. After re-capturing Acre, Richard defeated Saladin at the Battle of Arsuf in 1191 and the Battle of Jaffa in 1192, recovering most of the coast for the Christians, but could not recover Jerusalem or any of the inland territory of the kingdom. The crusade came to an end peacefully, with the Treaty of Jaffa in 1192. Saladin allowed pilgrimages to be made to Jerusalem, allowing the Crusaders to fulfill their vows, after which they all returned home. Local crusader barons set about rebuilding their kingdom from Acre and the other coastal cities.

Saladin died in 1193, and there were frequent conflicts between different Ayyubid sultans ruling in Damascus and Cairo. Damascus was the capital of independent Ayyubid rulers between 1193 and 1201, from 1218 to 1238, from 1239 to 1245, and from 1250 to 1260. At other times it was ruled by the Ayyubid rulers of Egypt. During the internecine wars fought by the Ayyubid rulers, Damascus was besieged repeatedly, as, e.g., in 1229.

The patterned Byzantine and Chinese silks available through Damascus, one of the Western termini of the Silk Road, gave the English language &quot;damask&quot;.

===Mamluk period===

Ayyubid rule (and independence) came to an end with the Mongol invasion of Syria in 1260, in which the Mongols led by Kitbuqa entered the city on 1 March 1260, along with the King of Armenia, Hethum I, and the Prince of Antioch, Bohemond VI; hence, the citizens of Damascus saw for the first time for six centuries three Christian potentates ride in triumph through their streets. However, following the Mongol defeat at Ain Jalut on 3 September 1260, Damascus was captured five days later and became the provincial capital of the Mamluk Sultanate, ruled from Egypt, following the Mongol withdrawal. Following their victory at the Battle of Wadi al-Khaznadar, the Mongols led by Ghazan besieged the city for ten days, which surrendered between December 30, 1299, and January 6, 1300, though its Citadel resisted. Ghazan then retreated with most of his forces in February, probably because the Mongol horses needed fodder, and left behind about 10,000 horsemen under the Mongol general Mulay. Around March 1300, Mulay returned with his horsemen to Damascus, then followed Ghazan back across the Euphrates. In May 1300, the Egyptian Mamluks returned from Egypt and reclaimed the entire area without a battle. In April 1303, the Mamluks managed to defeat the Mongol army led by Kutlushah and Mulay along with their Armenian allies at the Battle of Marj al-Saffar, to put an end to Mongol invasions of the Levant. Later on, the Black Death of 1348–1349 killed as much as half of the city&#x27;s population.

In 1400, Timur, the Turco-Mongol conqueror, besieged Damascus. The Mamluk sultan dispatched a deputation from Cairo, including Ibn Khaldun, who negotiated with him, but after their withdrawal, Timur sacked the city on 17 March 1401. The Umayyad Mosque was burnt and men and women were taken into slavery. A huge number of the city&#x27;s artisans were taken to Timur&#x27;s capital at Samarkand. These were the luckier citizens: many were slaughtered and their heads piled up in a field outside the north-east corner of the walls, where a city square still bears the name &quot;Burj al-Ru&#x27;us&quot; (between modern-day Al-Qassaa and Bab Tuma), originally &quot;the tower of heads&quot;.

Rebuilt, Damascus continued to serve as a Mamluk provincial capital until 1516.

===Ottoman period===


In early 1516, the Ottoman Empire, wary of the danger of an alliance between the Mamluks and the Persian Safavids, started a campaign of conquest against the Mamluk sultanate. On 21 September, the Mamluk governor of Damascus fled the city, and on 2 October the khutba in the Umayyad mosque was pronounced in the name of Selim I. The day after, the victorious sultan entered the city, staying for three months. On 15 December, he left Damascus by Bab al-Jabiya, intent on the conquest of Egypt. Little appeared to have changed in the city: one army had simply replaced another. However, on his return in October 1517, the sultan ordered the construction of a mosque, tekkiye and mausoleum at the shrine of Shaikh Muhi al-Din ibn Arabi in al-Salihiyah. This was to be the first of Damascus&#x27; great Ottoman monuments.
During this time, according to an Ottoman census, Damascus had 10,423 households.
The Ottomans remained for the next 400 years, except for a brief occupation by Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt from 1832 to 1840. Because of its importance as the point of departure for one of the two great Hajj caravans to Mecca, Damascus was treated with more attention by the Porte than its size might have warranted—for most of this period, Aleppo was more populous and commercially more important. In 1559 the western building of Sulaymaniyya Takiyya, comprising a mosque and khan for pilgrims on the road to Mecca, was completed to a design by the famous Ottoman architect Mimar Sinan, and soon afterward the Salimiyya Madrasa was built adjoining it.

Early in the nineteenth century, Damascus was noted for its shady cafes along the banks of the Barada. A depiction of these by William Henry Bartlett was published in 1836, along with a poetical illustration by Letitia Elizabeth Landon, see Under Ottoman rule, Christians and Jews were considered dhimmis and were allowed to practice their religious precepts. During the Damascus affair of 1840 the false accusation of ritual murder was brought against members of the Jewish community of Damascus. The massacre of Christians in 1860 was also one of the most notorious incidents of these centuries when fighting between Druze and Maronites in Mount Lebanon spilled over into the city. Several thousand Christians were killed in June 1860, with many more being saved through the intervention of the Algerian exile Abd al-Qadir and his soldiers (three days after the massacre started), who brought them to safety in Abd al-Qadir&#x27;s residence and the Citadel of Damascus. The Christian quarter of the old city (mostly inhabited by Catholics), including several churches, was burnt down. The Christian inhabitants of the notoriously poor and refractory Midan district outside the walls (mostly Orthodox) were, however, protected by their Muslim neighbors.

American Missionary E.C. Miller records that in 1867 the population of the city was &#x27;about&#x27; 140,000, of whom 30,000 were Christians, 10,000 Jews, and 100,000 &#x27;Mohammedans&#x27; with fewer than 100 Protestant Christians. In the meantime, American writer Mark Twain visited Damascus, then wrote about his travel in &quot;The Innocents Abroad&quot;, in which he mentioned: &quot;Though old as history itself, thou art fresh as the breath of spring, blooming as thine own rose-bud, and fragrant as thine own orange flower, O Damascus, pearl of the East!&quot;. In November 1898, German emperor Wilhelm II toured Damascus, during his trip to the Ottoman Empire.

===Modern period===
====20th century====
In the early years of the 20th century, nationalist sentiment in Damascus, initially cultural in its interest, began to take a political coloring, largely in reaction to the turkicisation program of the Committee of Union and Progress government established in Istanbul in 1908. The hanging of a number of patriotic intellectuals by Jamal Pasha, governor of Damascus, in Beirut and Damascus in 1915 and 1916 further stoked nationalist feeling, and in 1918, as the forces of the Arab Revolt and the British Imperial forces approached, residents fired on the retreating Turkish troops.
On 1 October 1918, T. E. Lawrence entered Damascus, the third arrival of the day, the first being the Australian 3rd Light Horse Brigade, led by Major A.C.N. &#x27;Harry&#x27; Olden. Two days later, 3 October 1918, the forces of the Arab revolt led by Prince Faisal also entered Damascus. A military government under Shukri Pasha was named and Faisal ibn Hussein was proclaimed king of Syria. Political tension arose in November 1917, when the new Bolshevik government in Russia revealed the Sykes-Picot Agreement whereby Britain and France had arranged to partition the Arab East between them. A new Franco-British proclamation on 17 November promised the &quot;complete and definitive freeing of the peoples so long oppressed by the Turks.&quot; The Syrian National Congress in March adopted a democratic constitution. However, the Versailles Conference had granted France a mandate over Syria, and in 1920 a French army commanded by the General Mariano Goybet crossed the Anti-Lebanon Mountains, defeated a small Syrian defensive expedition at the Battle of Maysalun and entered Damascus. The French made Damascus the capital of their League of Nations Mandate for Syria.

When in 1925 the Great Syrian Revolt in the Hauran spread to Damascus, the French suppressed it with heavy weaponry, bombing and shelling the city on 9 May 1926. As a result, the area of the old city between Al-Hamidiyah Souq and Medhat Pasha Souq was burned to the ground, with many deaths, and has since then been known as &quot;al-Hariqa&quot; (&quot;the fire&quot;). The old city was surrounded with barbed wire to prevent rebels from infiltrating the Ghouta, and a new road was built outside the northern ramparts to facilitate the movement of armored cars. Reporter George Seldes viewed 308 bodies, and suggested there might be more dead under the rubble -- and that a maximum might be one thousand. &quot;When the Muslims, who had rebelled, threatened to kill all Christians, General Maurice Sarrail gave the civilian population time to evacuate, then ordered Fort Gouraud to fire some warning shots, then shell the rebel sector.&quot; 

On 21 June 1941, 3 weeks into the Allied Syria-Lebanon campaign, Damascus was captured from the Vichy French forces by a mixed British Indian and Free French force. The French agreed to withdraw in 1946, following the British intervention during the Levant Crisis, thus leading to the full independence of Syria. Damascus remained the capital.

In 1979, the Old City of Damascus, with its collection of archaeological and historical religious sites, was listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.

==== Civil war ====


By January 2012, clashes between the regular army and rebels reached the outskirts of Damascus, reportedly preventing people from leaving or reaching their houses, especially when security operations there intensified from the end of January into February.

By June 2012, bullets and shrapnel shells smashed into homes in Damascus overnight as troops battled the Free Syrian Army in the streets. At least three tank shells slammed into residential areas in the central Damascus neighborhood of Qaboun, according to activists. Intense exchanges of assault rifle fire marked the clash, according to residents and amateur video posted online.

The Damascus suburb of Ghouta suffered heavy bombing in December 2017 and a further wave of bombing started in February 2018, also known as Rif Dimashq Offensive.

On 20 May 2018, Damascus and the entire Rif Dimashq Governorate came fully under government control for the first time in 7 years after the evacuation of IS from Yarmouk Camp. In September 2019, Damascus entered the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the least liveable city, scoring 30.7 points on the Economist&#x27;s Global Liveability Index in 2019, based on factors such as: stability, healthcare, culture and environment, education, and infrastructure. However, the trend of being the least liveable city on Earth started in 2017, and continued as of 2024.

Syrian rebels, led by the HTS rebel group entered Damascus on 8 December 2024 after a series of offensives, capturing Sednaya Prison and later resulting in the collapse of Ba&#x27;athist Syria. 

On 23 February 2025, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu demanded the complete demilitarization of southern Syria in the provinces of Quneitra, Daraa and Suweyda, and the withdrawal of Syrian forces from Syrian territory south of Damascus. Syria&#x27;s new regime under transitional President Ahmed al-Sharaa rejected Netanyahu&#x27;s demands. Hours later, Israel conducted a wave of airstrikes in Damascus and southern Syria.

==Economy==
The historical role that Damascus played as an important trade center has changed in recent years due to political development in the region as well as the development of modern trade. Most goods produced in Damascus, as well as in Syria, are distributed to countries of the Arabian peninsula. Damascus has also held an annual international trade exposition every fall, since 1954.

The tourism industry in Damascus has a lot of potential, however, the civil war has hampered these prospects. The abundance of cultural wealth in Damascus has been modestly employed since the late 1980s with the development of many accommodation and transportation establishments and other related investments. Since the early 2000s, numerous boutique hotels and bustling cafes opened in the old city which attracts plenty of European tourists and Damascenes alike.

In 2009 new office space was built and became available on the real estate market. Marota City and Basilia City are two new development projects in Damascus. These two projects are viewed as post-war reconstruction efforts. The Damascus stock exchange formally opened for trade in March 2009, and the exchange is the only stock exchange in Syria. It is located in the Barzeh district, within Syria&#x27;s financial markets and securities commission. Its final home is to be located in the upmarket business district of &quot;Yaafur&quot;.

Damascus is home to a wide range of industrial activities, such as textile, food processing, cement, and various chemical industries. The majority of factories are run by the state, however limited privatization in addition to economic activities led by the private sector, were permitted starting in the early 2000s with the liberalization of trade that took place.
Traditional handcrafts and artisan copper engravings are still produced in the old city.
==Demographics==
=== Population ===
In the 2004 Census of Population conducted by Central Bureau of Statistics (Syria), Damascus had a population of 1,552,161 living in 309,317 of its 345,097 total dwellings.

Damascus is the center of a crowded metropolitan area with an estimated population of 5 million. The metropolitan area of Damascus includes the cities of Douma, Harasta, Darayya, Al-Tall and Jaramana.

The city&#x27;s growth rate is higher than in Syria as a whole, primarily due to rural-urban migration and the influx of young Syrian migrants drawn by employment and educational opportunities. The migration of Syrian youths to Damascus has resulted in an average age within the city that is below the national average. Nonetheless, the population of Damascus is thought to have decreased in recent years as a result of the ongoing Syrian civil war.

===Ethnicity===
The vast majority of Damascenes are Syrian Arabs. The Kurds are the second largest ethnic minority, with a population of approximately 300,000. They reside primarily in the neighborhoods of Wadi al-Mashari (&quot;Zorava&quot; or &quot;Zore Afa&quot; in Kurdish) and Rukn al-Din. Other minorities include Palestinians, Assyrians, Syrian Turkmen, Armenians, Circassians and a small Greek community.

There was once a significant Jewish community in Damascus, but as of 2023, no Jews remain.

===Religion===

Islam is the largest religion. The majority of Muslims are Sunni while Alawites and Twelver Shi&#x27;a comprise sizeable minorities. Alawites live primarily in the neighbourhoods of Mezzeh 86 and Sumariyah part of the Mezzeh district, in addition to the neighbourhood of Eish al-Warwar in the district of Barzeh. Twelvers primarily live near the Shia holy sites of Sayyidah Ruqayya and Sayyidah Zaynab. It is believed that there are more than 200 mosques in Damascus, the most well-known being the Umayyad Mosque.

Christians represent about 10%–15% of the population. Several Eastern Christian rites have their headquarters in Damascus, including the Syriac Orthodox Church, the Syriac Catholic Church, the Melkite Greek Catholic Church, and the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch. The Christian districts in the city are Bab Tuma, Qassaa and Ghassani. Each have many churches, most notably the ancient Chapel of Saint Paul, St. Paul Cathedral, Our Lady of the Dormition Cathedral, and St Georges Cathedral in Bab Tuma. At the suburb of Soufanieh a series of apparitions of the Virgin Mary have reportedly been observed between 1982 and 2004. The Patriarchal See of the Syriac Orthodox is based in Damascus, Bab Touma.

A smaller Druze minority inhabits the city, notably in the mixed Christian-Druze suburbs of Tadamon, Jaramana, and Sahnaya.

There was a small Jewish community namely in what is called &quot;Harat al-Yahud&quot; the Jewish quarter. They are the remnants of an ancient and much larger Jewish presence in Syria, dating back at least to Roman times, if not before to the time of King David.

====Sufism====
Sufism throughout the second half of the 20th century has been an influential current in the Sunni religious practises, particularly in Damascus. The largest women-only and girls-only Muslim movement in the world happens to be Sufi-oriented and is based in Damascus, led by Munira al-Qubaysi. Syrian Sufism has its stronghold in urban regions such as Damascus, where it also established political movements such as Zayd, with the help of a series of mosques, and clergy such as Abd al-Ghani al-Nabulsi, Sa&#x27;id Hawwa, Abd al-Rahman al-Shaghouri and Muhammad al-Yaqoubi.

==Historical sites==

The Ancient City of Damascus was inscribed on the World Heritage List in 1979. Beginning with the Aramaic kingdom (11th-7th centuries BC), Damascus grew into the political and urban hub for the region. Today, the ancient city encompasses over 125 cultural heritage sites that represent Damascus’ long history, including archaeological and architectural remains from the Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, Islamic, and Ottoman periods. Tragically, ongoing conflict and war continues to threaten the archaeological heritage and prevent archaeological discovery of Damascus.

The Citadel of Damascus is in the northwest corner of the Old City. The &quot;Damascus Straight Street&quot; (referred to in the account of the conversion of St. Paul in Acts 9:11), also known as the &quot;Via Recta&quot;, was the decumanus (east–west main street) of Roman Damascus, and extended for over . Today, it consists of the street of Bab Sharqi and the Souk Medhat Pasha, a covered market. The Bab Sharqi street is filled with small shops and leads to the old Christian quarter of Bab Tuma (St. Thomas&#x27;s Gate), where St George&#x27;s Cathedral, the seat of the Syriac Orthodox Church, is notably located. Medhat Pasha Souq is also a main market in Damascus and was named after Midhat Pasha, the Ottoman governor of Syria who renovated the Souk. At the end of Bab Sharqi Street, one reaches the House of Ananias, an underground chapel that was the cellar of Ananias&#x27;s house. The Umayyad Mosque, also known as the Grand Mosque of Damascus, is one of the largest mosques in the world and also one of the oldest sites of continuous prayer since the rise of Islam. A shrine in the mosque is said to contain the body of St. John the Baptist. The mausoleum where Saladin was buried is located in the gardens just outside the mosque. Sayyidah Ruqayya Mosque, the shrine of the youngest daughter of Husayn ibn Ali, can also be found near the Umayyad Mosque. The ancient district of Amara is also within walking distance from these sites. Another heavily visited site is Sayyidah Zaynab Mosque, where the tomb of Zaynab bint Ali is located. Shias, Fatemids, and Dawoodi Bohras believe that after the battle of Karbala (680 AD), in Iraq, the Umayyad Caliph Yezid brought Imam Husain&#x27;s head to Damascus, where it was first kept in the courtyard of Yezid Mahal, now part of Umayyad Mosque complex. All other remaining members of Imam Husain&#x27;s family (left alive after Karbala) along with the heads of all other companions, who were killed at Karbala, were also brought to Damascus. These members were kept as prisoners on the outskirts of the city (near Bab al-Saghir), where the other heads were kept at the same location, now called Ru&#x27;ûs ash-Shuhadâ-e-Karbala or ganj-e-sarha-e-shuhada-e-Karbala. There is a qibla (place of worship) marked at the place, where devotees say Imam Ali-Zain-ul-Abedin used to pray while in captivity.

The Harat Al Yehud or Jewish Quarter is a recently restored historical tourist destination popular among Europeans before the outbreak of civil war.

===Walls and gates of Damascus===

The Old City of Damascus with an approximate area of 86.12 hectares is surrounded by ramparts on the northern and eastern sides and part of the southern side. There are seven extant city gates, the oldest of which dates back to the Roman period. These are, clockwise from the north of the citadel:
* Bab al-Faradis (&quot;the gate of the orchards&quot;, or &quot;of the paradise&quot;)
* Bab al-Salam (&quot;the gate of peace&quot;), all on the north boundary of the Old City
* Bab Tuma (&quot;Touma&quot; or &quot;Thomas&#x27;s Gate&quot;) in the north-east corner, leading into the Christian quarter of the same name,
* Bab Sharqi (&quot;eastern gate&quot;) in the east wall, the only one to retain its Roman plan
* Bab Kisan in the south-east, from which tradition holds that Saint Paul made his escape from Damascus, lowered from the ramparts in a basket; this gate has been closed and turned into Chapel of Saint Paul marking this event,
* Bab al-Saghir (The Small Gate)
* Bab al-Jabiya at the entrance to Souk Midhat Pasha, in the southwest.
Other areas outside the walled city also bear the name &quot;gate&quot;: Bab al-Faraj, Bab Mousalla and Bab Sreija, both to the south-west of the walled city.

* Beit al-Mamlouka, a 17th-century Damascene house, serving as a luxury boutique hotel within the old city since 2005.

===Threats to the future of the old City===
Due to the rapid decline of the population of Old Damascus (between 1995 and 2009 about 30,000 people moved out of the old city for more modern accommodation), a growing number of buildings are being abandoned or are falling into disrepair. In March 2007, the local government announced that it would be demolishing Old City buildings along a stretch of rampart walls as part of a redevelopment scheme. These factors resulted in the Old City being placed by the World Monuments Fund on its 2008 Watch List of the 100 Most Endangered Sites in the world. It is hoped that its inclusion on the list will draw more public awareness to these significant threats to the future of the historic Old City of Damascus.

====State of old Damascus====
In spite of the recommendations of the UNESCO World Heritage Center:
* Souq al-Atiq, a protected buffer zone, was destroyed in three days in November 2006;
* King Faysal Street, a traditional hand-craft region in a protected buffer zone near the walls of Old Damascus between the Citadel and &quot;Bab Touma&quot;, is threatened by a proposed motorway.
* In 2007, the Old City of Damascus and notably the district of Bab Tuma have been recognized by The World Monument Fund as one of the most endangered sites in the world.

In October 2010, Global Heritage Fund named Damascus one of 12 cultural heritage sites most &quot;on the verge&quot; of irreparable loss and destruction.

==Education==

Damascus is the main center of education in Syria. It is home to Damascus University, which is the oldest and largest university in Syria. After the enactment of legislation allowing private higher institutions, several new universities were established in the city and the surrounding area, including:
* Syrian Virtual University
* International University for Science and Technology
* Syrian Private University
* Arab International University
* University of Kalamoon
* Yarmouk Private University
* Wadi International University
* Al-Jazeera University
* European University Damascus

The institutes play an important rule in the education, including:

* Higher Institute of Applied Science and Technology
* Higher Institute of Dramatic Arts
* National Institute of Administration
In Damascus, Higher education in Syrian Arab Republic started with sustainable development steps through Damascus University. 
* Additional:

==Transportation==

Damascus is linked with other major cities in Syria via a motorway network. The M5 connects Damascus with Homs, Hama, Aleppo and Turkey in the north and Jordan in the south. The M1 is going from Homs onto Latakia and Tartus.
The M4 links the city with Al-Hasakah and Iraq. The M1 highway connects the city to western Syria and Beirut.

The main airport is Damascus International Airport, approximately away from the city, with connections to a few Middle Eastern cities. Before the beginning of the Syrian civil war, the airport had connectivity to many Asian, European, African, and, South American cities.
Streets in Damascus are often narrow, especially in the older parts of the city, and speed bumps are widely used to limit the speed of vehicles. Many taxi companies operate in Damascus. Fares are regulated by law and taxi drivers are obliged to use a taximeter.

Public transport in Damascus depends extensively on buses and minibuses. There are about one hundred lines that operate inside the city and some of them extend from the city center to nearby suburbs. There is no schedule for the lines, and due to the limited number of official bus stops, buses will usually stop wherever a passenger needs to get on or off. The number of buses serving the same line is relatively high, which minimizes the waiting time. Lines are not numbered, rather they are given captions mostly indicating the two endpoints and possibly an important station along the line. Between 2019 and 2022, more than 100 modern buses were delivered from China as part of the international agreement. These deliveries strengthened and modernized the public transport of Damascus.

Served by Chemins de Fer Syriens, the former main railway station of Damascus was al-Hejaz railway station, about west of the old city. The station is now defunct and the tracks have been removed, but there still is a ticket counter and a shuttle to Damascus Qadam station in the south of the city, which now functions as the main railway station.

In 2008, the government announced a plan to construct a Damascus Metro. The green line will be an essential west–east axis for the future public transportation network, serving Moadamiyeh, Sumariyeh, Mezzeh, Damascus University, Hijaz, the Old City, Abbassiyeen and Qaboun Pullman bus station. A four-line metro network is expected to be in operation by 2050.

==Culture==

Damascus was chosen as the 2008 Arab Capital of Culture. The preparation for the festivity began in February 2007 with the establishing of the Administrative Committee for &quot;Damascus Arab Capital of Culture&quot; by a presidential decree. Museums in Damascus includes National Museum of Damascus, Azem Palace, Military Museum, October War Panorama Museum, Museum of Arabic Calligraphy and Nur al-Din Bimaristan

The fifth and the seventh Pan Arab Games were held in Damascus in 1976 and 1992 respectively.

The now modernized Al-Fayhaa Sports City features a basketball court and a hall that can accommodate up to 8,000 people. In late November 2021, Syria&#x27;s national basketball team played there against Kazakhstan, making Damascus host of Syria&#x27;s first international basketball tournament in almost two decades.

The city also has a modern golf course located near the Ebla Cham Palace Hotel on the southeastern outskirts of Damascus.

Damascus has a busy nightlife. Coffeehouses offer Arabic coffee, tea and nargileh (water pipes). Card games, tables (backgammon variants), and chess are activities frequented in cafés. These coffeehouses had an international reputation in the past, as indicated by Letitia Elizabeth Landon&#x27;s poetical illustration, &quot;Cafes in Damascus&quot;, to a picture by William Henry Bartlett in Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1837. Current movies can be seen at Cinema City which was previously known as Cinema Dimashq.
Tishreen Park is one of the largest parks in Damascus. It is home to the annual Damascus Flower Show. Other parks include al-Jahiz, al-Sibbki, al-Tijara, al-Wahda, etc...

<doc id="8921" wikidata="Q753022" url="?curid=8921" title="Diplomatic immunity">
<text>Diplomatic immunity is a principle of international law by which certain foreign government officials are recognized as having legal immunity from the jurisdiction of another country. It allows diplomats safe passage and freedom of travel in a host country and affords almost total protection from local lawsuits and prosecution.

Diplomatic immunity is one of the oldest and most widespread practices in international relations; most civilizations since antiquity have granted some degree of special status to foreign envoys and messengers. It is designed to facilitate relations between states by allowing their respective representatives to conduct their duties freely and safely, even during periods of political tension and armed conflict. Moreover, such protections are generally understood to be reciprocal and therefore mutually beneficial.

As a longstanding and nearly universal concept, diplomatic immunity has long been considered customary law; however, it was traditionally granted on a bilateral, &quot;ad hoc&quot; basis, leading to varying and sometimes conflicting standards of protection. Modern practices of diplomatic immunity have largely conformed to the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which formally codified the legal and political status of diplomats, and has been ratified by the vast majority of sovereign states.

Contrary to popular belief, diplomats are not entirely immune from the jurisdiction of their host country. Like most foreign persons, they may still be declared &quot;persona non grata&quot; and expelled. A foreign official&#x27;s home country may waive immunity, typically in the event that they are involved in some manner in a serious crime unrelated to their diplomatic role (as opposed to, for example, allegations of spying). However, many countries refuse to waive immunity as a matter of course, and diplomats have no authority to waive their own immunity (except perhaps in cases of defection). Alternatively, the home country may prosecute the individual on its own accord or through the insistence of the host country.

The concept of diplomatic immunity can be found in ancient Indian epics like &quot;Ramayana&quot; and &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, where messengers and diplomats were given immunity from capital punishment. In &quot;Ramayana&quot;, when the demon king Ravana ordered the killing of Hanuman, Ravana&#x27;s younger brother Vibhishana pointed out that messengers or diplomats should not be killed, as per ancient practices.

During the evolution of international justice, many wars were considered rebellions or unlawful by one or more combatant sides. In such cases, the servants of the &quot;criminal&quot; sovereign were often considered accomplices and their persons violated. In other circumstances, harbingers of inconsiderable demands were killed as a declaration of war. Herodotus records that when heralds of the Persian king Xerxes demanded &quot;earth and water&quot; (i.e., symbols of submission) of Greek cities, the Athenians threw them into a pit and the Spartans threw them down a well for the purpose of suggesting they would find both earth and water at the bottom, these often being mentioned by the messenger as a threat of siege. However, even for Herodotus, this maltreatment of envoys is a crime. He recounts a story of divine vengeance befalling Sparta for this deed.

A Roman envoy was urinated on as he was leaving the city of Tarentum. The oath of the envoy, &quot;This stain will be washed away with blood!&quot;, was fulfilled during the Pyrrhic War.

Gregory of Tours recorded that Frankish envoys sent from King Childebert II to the Byzantine emperor Maurice were killed in Carthage by the prefect of the city, after one of the Franks had murdered a merchant. After Emperor Maurice heard about this, he ordered for several Carthaginians to be arrested and sent to Childebert for judgment on account of what happened to his envoys.

The arrest and ill-treatment of the envoy of Raja Raja Chola by the king of Kulasekhara dynasty (Second Cheras), which is now part of modern India, led to the naval Kandalur War in AD 994.

The Islamic prophet Muhammad sent and received envoys and strictly forbade harming them. This practice was continued by the Rashidun caliphs who exchanged diplomats with the Ethiopians and the Byzantines. This diplomatic exchange continued during the Arab–Byzantine wars.

Classical Sharia called for hospitality to be shown towards anyone who has been granted &quot;amān&quot; (or right of safe passage). &quot;Amān&quot; was readily granted to any emissary bearing a letter or another sealed document. The duration of the &quot;amān&quot; was typically a year. Envoys with this right of passage were given immunity of person and property. They were exempt from taxation, as long as they did not engage in trade.

As diplomats by definition enter the country under safe conduct, violating them is normally viewed as a great breach of honor. Genghis Khan and the Mongols were well known for insisting on the rights of diplomats, and would often take terrifying vengeance against any state that violated these rights; at times razing entire cities in retaliation for the execution of their ambassadors. The Mongols invaded and destroyed the Khwarezmid Empire after their ambassadors were mistreated.

===16th–19th century===

The British Parliament first guaranteed diplomatic immunity to foreign ambassadors under the Diplomatic Privileges Act in 1709, after Count Andrey Matveyev, a Russian resident in London, was subjected to verbal and physical abuse by British bailiffs.

Modern diplomatic immunity evolved parallel to the development of modern diplomacy. In the 17th century, European diplomats realized that protection from prosecution was essential to doing their jobs, and a set of rules evolved guaranteeing the rights of diplomats. These were still confined to Western Europe and were closely tied to the prerogatives of nobility. Thus, an emissary to the Ottoman Empire could expect to be arrested and imprisoned upon the outbreak of hostilities between his state and the empire. The French Revolution also disrupted this system, as the revolutionary state and Napoleon imprisoned numerous diplomats who were accused of working against France. More recently, the Iran hostage crisis is universally considered a violation of diplomatic immunity. Although the hostage takers did not officially represent the state, host countries are obligated to protect diplomatic property and personnel. On the other hand, during World War II, diplomatic immunity was upheld and the embassies of the belligerents were evacuated through neutral countries.

For the upper class of the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, diplomatic immunity was an easy concept to understand. The first embassies were not permanent establishments but actual visits by high-ranking representatives, often close relatives of the sovereign, or by the sovereign in person. As permanent representations evolved, usually on a treaty basis between two powers, they were frequently staffed by relatives of the sovereign or high-ranking nobles.

Warfare was a status of hostilities not between individual states but between their sovereigns, as well as the officers and officials of European governments, and armies often changed employers. Truces and ceasefires were commonplace, as was the fraternization between officers of opposing armies. If officers were taken prisoner, they usually gave their and were only restricted to a city away from the theatre of war. Almost always, they were given leave to carry their personal sidearms. Even during the French Revolutionary Wars, British scientists visited the French Academy. In such an atmosphere, it was easy to accept that some persons were immune to the laws. After all, they were still bound by strict requirements of honour and customs.

===Modern era and Vienna convention===

In the 19th century, the Congress of Vienna reasserted the rights of diplomats; they have been largely respected since then, as the European model has spread throughout the world. Currently, diplomatic relations, including diplomatic immunity, are governed internationally by the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which has been ratified by almost every country in the world.

In modern times, diplomatic immunity continues to provide a means, albeit imperfect, to safeguard diplomatic personnel from any animosity that might arise between nations. As one article put it: &quot;So why do we agree to a system in which we&#x27;re dependent on a foreign country&#x27;s whim before we can prosecute a criminal inside our own borders? The practical answer is: because we depend on other countries to honor our own diplomats&#x27; immunity just as scrupulously as we honor theirs.&quot;

During the 18 April 1961 Vienna Convention, the Holy See was granted diplomatic immunity to its foreign ambassadors as well.

In the United States, the Diplomatic Relations Act of 1978 ( et seq.) follows the principles introduced by the Vienna Conventions. The United States tends to be generous when granting diplomatic immunity to visiting diplomats, because a large number of US diplomats work in host countries less protective of individual rights. If the United States were to punish a visiting diplomat without sufficient grounds, US representatives in other countries could receive harsher treatment. If a person with immunity is alleged to have committed a crime or faces a civil lawsuit, the State Department asks the home country to waive immunity of the alleged offender so that the complaint can be moved to the courts. If immunity is not waived, prosecution cannot be undertaken. However, the State Department still has the right to expel the diplomat. In many such cases, the diplomat&#x27;s visas are revoked, and they and their family may be barred from returning to the United States. Crimes committed by members of a diplomat&#x27;s family can also result in dismissal.

==Exceptions to the Vienna Convention==

Some countries have made reservations to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, but they are minor. A number of countries limit the diplomatic immunity of persons who are citizens of the receiving country. As nations keep faith to their treaties with differing zeal, other rules may also apply, though in most cases this summary is a reasonably accurate approximation. The Convention does not cover the personnel of international organizations, whose privileges are decided upon on a case-by-case basis, usually in the treaties founding such organizations.

=== UN organisations ===

The United Nations system (including its agencies, which comprise the most recognizable international bodies such as the World Bank and many others) has a relatively standardized form of limited immunities for staff traveling on UN laissez-passer; diplomatic immunity is often granted to the highest-ranking officials of these agencies. Consular officials (that do not have concurrent diplomatic accreditation) formally have a more limited form of immunity, generally limited to their official duties. Diplomatic technical and administrative staff also have more limited immunity under the Vienna Convention; for this reason, some countries may accredit a member of technical or administrative staff as an attaché.

=== Others ===

Other categories of government officials that may travel frequently to other countries may not have diplomatic passports or diplomatic immunity, such as members of the military, high-ranking government officials, ministers, and others. For the US military, official passports can be used for work related travels only. Many countries provide non-diplomatic official passports to such personnel, and there may be different classes of such travel documents such as official passports, service passports, and others. De facto recognition of some form of immunity may be conveyed by states accepting officials traveling on such documents, or there may exist bilateral agreements to govern such cases (as in, for example, the case of military personnel conducting or observing exercises on the territory of the receiving country).

Formally, diplomatic immunity may be limited to officials accredited to a host country, or traveling to or from their host country. In practice, many countries may effectively recognize diplomatic immunity for those traveling on diplomatic passports, with admittance to the country constituting acceptance of the diplomatic status. However, this is not universal, and diplomats have been prosecuted and jailed for crimes committed outside the country they are accredited to.

As a result of their title, diplomats are exempt from being prosecuted by the state in open court when they are suspected to be guilty of a crime. Not only are these agents free from the criminal jurisdiction of the state, they are also immune from administrative and civil jurisdiction. This applies for most scenarios; however, there are some exceptions when the diplomatic immunity is subject to waiver.

# Any events that are associated with individual stationary property in the land of the given receiving State – with the exception of whether or not he is directed to do so for a plan. 
# Any events with regards to a diplomat serving as another role from another State, including heir, inheritor of a will, executor, administrator.
# Any activity by a diplomat, in the receiving State, that is related to any professional or commercial operations beyond the scope of his directed responsibilities.

Asadollah Asadi, an Iranian diplomat, was arrested while returning to his residence in Austria on a highway in Germany on June 10, 2018, accused of being involved in an attempted bombing at a gathering of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (a political organisation opposing the Iranian regime). While Assadi was entitled to diplomatic immunity where applicable, it was deemed that he was not protected when he was arrested as he was on holiday (in Germany) outside the country where he was posted and hence protected.

==Uses and abuses==

In reality, most diplomats are representatives of nations with a tradition of professional civil service; they are expected to obey regulations governing their behaviour and suffer severe disciplinary action if they flout local laws. In many nations, a professional diplomat&#x27;s career may be compromised if they (or members of their family) disobey the local authorities or cause serious embarrassment, and such cases are, at any rate, a violation of the spirit of the Vienna Conventions.

The Vienna Convention is explicit that &quot;without prejudice to their privileges and immunities, it is the duty of all persons enjoying such privileges and immunities to respect the laws and regulations of the receiving State.&quot; Nevertheless, on some occasions, protected diplomats have violated laws (including those that would be violations at home as well) of the host country, and that country has been essentially limited to informing the diplomat&#x27;s nation that the diplomat is no longer welcome (&quot;persona non grata&quot;). Diplomatic agents are not, however, exempt from the jurisdiction of their home state, and hence prosecution may be undertaken by the sending state. For minor violations of the law, the sending state may impose administrative procedures specific to the foreign service or diplomatic mission.

Violation of the law by diplomats has included espionage, smuggling, child custody law violations, money laundering, tax evasion, making terrorist threats, slavery, child solicitation, and murder.

===Offences against the person===

On-duty police officer Yvonne Fletcher was murdered in London in 1984, by a person shooting from inside the Libyan embassy during a protest. The incident caused a breakdown in diplomatic relations until Libya admitted &quot;general responsibility&quot; in 1999. The incident became a major factor in Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s decision to allow President of the United States Ronald Reagan to launch the US bombing of Libya in 1986 from American bases in the United Kingdom.

In 1987, the Human Resources Administration of New York City placed 9-year-old Terrence Karamba in a foster home after his elementary school teachers noticed suspicious scars and injuries. He and his 7-year-old sister, who was also placed in city custody, told officials the wounds had been inflicted by their father, Floyd Karamba, an administrative attaché at the Zimbabwean Mission to the UN. No charges were filed, as Karamba had diplomatic immunity.

In February 1999 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, Kazuko Shimokoji, wife of the Japanese Consul-General, showed up at the emergency department of a city hospital with two black eyes and a bruised neck. She told doctors that her husband had beaten her. When local police questioned her husband, Mr. Shimokoji said, &quot;Yes, I punched her out and she deserved it&quot;, and described the incident as &quot;a cultural thing and not a big deal&quot;. Although an arrest warrant was issued, Mr. Shimokoji could not be arrested due to his diplomatic immunity. However, his statement to the police was widely reported in both the local and Japanese press. The subsequent public uproar prompted the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to waive Mr. Shimokoji&#x27;s immunity. Though he pleaded guilty in Canadian court, he was given an absolute discharge. Nonetheless, he was recalled to Japan where he was reassigned to office duty and had his pay cut.

In 2002, a Colombian diplomat in the United Kingdom was prosecuted for manslaughter once diplomatic immunity was waived by the Colombian government.

In November 2006 in New York City, Fred Matwanga, Kenyan diplomat to the UN, was taken into police custody by officers responding to reports that he had assaulted his son; he was released after asserting diplomatic immunity.

In 2011, Turkish president Erdogan and his team started fighting with UN officials at the United Nations Headquarters. The then secretary general, Ban Ki Moon, soon ran over and apologised to Erdogan.

In April 2012 in the Philippines, Erick Shcks Bairnals, a technical officer of the Panama Maritime Authority&#x27;s regional office in Manila, was accused of raping a 19-year-old Filipino woman. Being an attached agency to the Panamanian embassy in Manila, the AMP office was classified as a diplomatic entity, its officers possessing the same privileges conferred to the embassy&#x27;s diplomats. Shcks was later released from detention because Shcks &quot;enjoys protection under the 1961 Vienna Convention.&quot;

In March 2013, the Supreme Court of India restricted Italian ambassador Daniele Mancini from leaving India for breaching an undertaking given to the apex court. Despite Italian and European Union protests regarding the restrictions as contrary to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, the Supreme Court of India said it would be unacceptable to argue diplomatic immunity after voluntarily submitting to the court&#x27;s jurisdiction. The Italian envoy had invoked Article 32 of the Constitution of India when filing an affidavit to the Supreme Court taking responsibility for the return of the two Italian marines to India after casting their votes in the March 2012 general elections in Italy. The Indian Supreme Court opined that the Italian ambassador had waived his diplomatic immunity and could be charged for contempt. The two marines were being tried in India for the murder of two Indian fishermen off the coast of Kerala (see the Enrica Lexie case).

In October 2013, Russian diplomat Dmitri Borodin was arrested in The Hague, The Netherlands, after neighbours called the police. Borodin was alleged to have been drunk and violent towards his children, aged two and four. Police were in the area because Borodin&#x27;s wife had lost control over her car while also intoxicated, and had rammed four parked cars near the diplomats&#x27; house. Russia immediately demanded an apology from the Dutch government for violating Borodin&#x27;s diplomatic immunity. The row came at a time of tension between Russia and the Netherlands, after the Russian security services captured a Greenpeace vessel sailing under the Dutch flag, &quot;Arctic Sunrise&quot;, that was protesting against oil drilling in the Prirazlomnoye field.

In June 2014, the New Zealand government confirmed that Mohammed Rizalman Bin Ismail from Malaysia, aged in his 30s and employed at Malaysia&#x27;s High Commission in Wellington, had invoked diplomatic immunity when faced with charges of burglary and assault with intent to rape after allegedly following a 21-year-old woman to her home. He returned to Malaysia in May 2014 with his family while the case was still in hearing. The New Zealand foreign ministry was criticized for allowing the defendant to leave the country, which was blamed on miscommunication between the foreign ministries of the two countries, as Prime Minister John Key expressed his view that &quot;the man should have faced the charges in New Zealand&quot;. Malaysia eventually agreed to send the diplomat back to assist in investigations and he was eventually tried and sentenced to nine months&#x27; home detention in New Zealand.

In July 2017, in Jordan, two Jordanian carpenters were invited to repair furniture at an Israeli diplomatic security agent&#x27;s residence near the Israeli embassy. It is believed that the Jordanians and Israeli security agent quarreled over the ongoing tensions regarding the installations of metal detectors at entry points to al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem. One carpenter, a teenager of Palestinian origin reportedly tried to stab the Israeli security agent with his screwdriver, and the Israeli security agent shot and killed the Jordanian carpenter, and also shot the property landlord as well, a doctor, who happened to be there at the time. Israel refused to allow Jordanian authorities to question the agent, claiming diplomatic immunity under the Vienna convention.

In August 2017, Grace Mugabe, the former First Lady of Zimbabwe, invoked diplomatic immunity on 15 August after assault charges were laid against her by a South African model.

In 2018, Saudi American journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed by Saudi officials inside the Saudi embassy in Turkey. The Turkish police were not allowed to enter the premises days after this death. Furthermore, a Saudi government vehicle with diplomatic license plates was spotted entering a park.

In August 2022, UN diplomat Charles Dickens Imene Oliha of South Sudan&#x27;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs claimed diplomatic immunity and was released from jail in New York City after raping a woman twice inside her apartment building. He subsequently returned to South Sudan, where he was suspended from his duties and is to be investigated.

===Theft===

In April 2021, two Pakistani diplomats in South Korea were caught shoplifting in Seoul. The Pakistani diplomats were caught stealing $1.70 worth of chocolate and a $10 hat. The case was closed owing to their diplomatic immunity.

===Smuggling===

Diplomats and officials involved in drug smuggling have benefited from diplomatic immunity. For example, a Venezuelan general wanted in the United States on drugs charges was arrested in Aruba only to be released after the Venezuelan government protested his diplomatic immunity and threatened sanctions if Aruba did not release him.

In December 2014, Gambian diplomats were found guilty by Southwark Crown Court of London for selling tax-free tobacco from the Gambian embassy in the United Kingdom. The Crown Prosecution Service told the court that much of this was sold from the embassy without paying value-added tax and excise duty.

===Employer abuse and slavery===

Diplomatic immunity from local employment and labor law has precipitated incidents in which diplomatic staff have been accused of abusing local workers, who are often hired for positions requiring local knowledge (such as an administrative assistant, press/PR officer) or for general labor. In such situations, the employees are in a legal limbo where the laws of neither the host country nor the diplomat&#x27;s country are enforceable. Diplomats have ignored local laws concerning minimum wages, maximum working hours, vacation and holidays, and in some cases have imprisoned employees in their homes, deprived them of their earned wages, passports, food, and communication with the outside world, abused them physically and emotionally, and invaded their privacy. Reported incidents include the following:

* In 1999, a Bangladeshi woman, Shamela Begum, claimed she had been enslaved by a senior Bahraini envoy to the United Nations and his wife. Begum charged that the couple took her passport, struck her, and paid her just $800 for ten months of service—during which she was only twice allowed out of the couple&#x27;s New York apartment. The envoy and his wife claimed diplomatic immunity, and Begum later reached a civil settlement with her employers. By some estimates, &quot;hundreds of women have been exploited by their diplomat employers over the past 20 years.&quot;
* In 2003 in Finland, a Filipina maid escaped from an embassy of an unidentified Asian country, and reported being held in conditions approaching slavery: she was forced to work from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m., 7 days a week, and the ambassador&#x27;s children were permitted to hit her. On grounds of diplomatic immunity, no charges could be filed.
* In 2009, South Africa was criticised for claiming immunity from labor laws relating to a Ukrainian domestic worker at the residence of the South African ambassador in Ireland.
* In 2010, the American Civil Liberties Union filed an amicus brief in &quot;Swarna v. Al-Awadi&quot; to argue that human trafficking is a commercial activity engaged in for personal profit, which falls outside the scope of a diplomat&#x27;s official functions, and therefore diplomatic immunity does not apply. An appeals court ruled that Al-Awadi did not have diplomatic immunity in that situation.
* In 2013, Indian consular official Devyani Khobragade was detained, hand-cuffed, strip searched, DNA swabbed, and held in a federal holding cell in New York, relating to allegations of non-payment of US minimum wage and for fraudulently lying about the wages to be paid on a visa application for her domestic worker. India registered a strong protest and initiated a review of privileges afforded to American consular officials in India as a result.
* In 2015, two Nepalese women were rescued from the fifth floor of the Gurgaon residence of a Saudi Arabian diplomat in India. They were allegedly confined there and abused physically and sexually by the diplomat and his family and friends. The women were rescued in a police raid planned after the police received a letter from the Nepal embassy regarding their plight. Several persons, the Saudi diplomat among them, were booked for wrongful confinement and gang rape. Saudi Ambassador Saud Mohammed Alsati commented, &quot;This is completely false. We would not like to comment any further since the case is under investigation by the Indian police.&quot; Ten days after the diplomat was accused, it was confirmed that he had left India.

===Vehicular offences===

====Parking violations====

A particular problem is the difficulty in enforcing ordinary laws, such as prohibitions on double parking. For example, the Autobahn 555 in Cologne, Germany was nicknamed the &quot;Diplomatenrennbahn&quot; (Diplomat&#x27;s Raceway), when Bonn was the capital of West Germany, because of the numerous diplomats that used to speed through the highway under diplomatic immunity. Certain cities, for example The Hague and New York City have taken to impounding such cars rather than fining their owners. Diplomats&#x27; status does not guarantee the release of impounded cars. Diplomats&#x27; cars may not be searched or entered in the US.

Diplomatic missions have their own regulations, but many require their staff to pay any fines due for parking violations. A 2006 economic study found that there was a significant correlation between home-country corruption (as measured by Transparency International) and unpaid parking fines: six countries had in excess of 100 violations per diplomat: Kuwait, Egypt, Chad, Sudan, Bulgaria and Mozambique. In particular, New York City, which hosts the United Nations Headquarters, regularly protests to the United States Department of State about nonpayment of parking tickets because of diplomatic status. In 2001, the city had more than 200,000 outstanding parking tickets from diplomats, totaling more than $21.3 million, of which only $160,682 had been collected; a decade later, the total cost of unpaid parking tickets was over $17 million. In 1997, then-mayor Rudy Giuliani proposed to the Clinton administration that the U.S. State Department revoke the special DPL plates for diplomats who ignore parking summonses; the State Department denied Giuliani&#x27;s request.

In cities that impose a congestion charge, the decision of some diplomatic missions not to furnish payment has proved controversial. In London, embassies have amassed approximately £58 million in unpaid charges as of 2012, with the American embassy comprising approximately £6 million and the Russian, German and Japanese missions around £2 million each.

====Vehicular assault and drunk driving====

=====Georgian driver in the United States=====

In January 1997, Gueorgui Makharadze, a high-ranking Georgian diplomat, caused a five-car pileup in Washington, D.C., in the United States, which killed a 16-year-old girl. Makharadze&#x27;s claim of diplomatic immunity created a national outrage in the United States, particularly given Makharadze&#x27;s previous record of driving offenses: In April 1996, Makharadze had been charged with speeding in Virginia, and four months later, he was detained by District of Columbia police on suspicion of drunk driving. In both prior cases, charges were dismissed based on his immunity. On the basis of the media coverage, Georgia revoked Makharadze&#x27;s immunity, and he was ultimately sentenced to seven years in prison after pleading guilty to one count of involuntary manslaughter and four counts of aggravated assault.

=====American driver in Russia=====

On 27 October 1998, in Vladivostok, Russia, Douglas Kent, the American Consul General to Russia, was involved in a car accident that left a young man, Alexander Kashin, disabled. Kent was not prosecuted in a US court. Under the Vienna Convention, diplomatic immunity does not apply to civil actions relating to vehicular accidents, but in 2006, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that, since he was using his vehicle for consular purposes, Kent could not be sued civilly.

=====Russian driver in Canada=====

In 2001, a Russian diplomat, Andrei Knyazev, hit and killed a woman while driving drunk in Ottawa. Knyazev refused to take a breathalyzer at the scene of the crash, citing diplomatic immunity. Russia refused Canadian requests to waive his immunity, and Knyazev was expelled from Canada. Though the Russian Foreign Ministry fired him and charged him with involuntary manslaughter, and Russian and Canadian authorities cooperated in the investigation, the case caused a political storm in Canada. Many accused the Foreign Ministry of incompetence after it emerged that Knyazev had twice been previously investigated for drunk driving. The Canadian Foreign Minister had fought unsuccessfully to have Knyazev tried in Ottawa. In 2002, Knyazev was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in Russia.

=====American driver in Romania=====

On 3 December 2004, in Bucharest, Romania, Christopher Van Goethem, an American Marine serving his embassy, ran a red traffic signal, collided with a taxi, and killed popular Romanian musician Teo Peter. The Romanian government requested the American government to lift his immunity, which it refused to do. In a court-martial, he was acquitted of manslaughter and adultery but was convicted of obstruction of justice and making false statements.

=====Canadian driver in Tanzania=====

On 9 December 2009, in Tanzania, Canadian Junior Envoy Jean Touchette was arrested after it was reported that he spat at a traffic police officer on duty in the middle of a traffic jam in the Banana district on the outskirts of Dar es Salaam. Canada&#x27;s High Commissioner, Robert Orr, was summoned by the Tanzanian Foreign Ministry over the incident, and the junior envoy was later recalled.

=====Romanian driver in Singapore=====

On 15 December 2009, in Singapore, the Romanian chargé d&#x27;affaires, Silviu Ionescu, was allegedly behind a drunk-driving hit-and-run accident that killed a 30-year-old man and seriously injured two others. He left Singapore for Romania three days after the accident. The Romanian foreign ministry suspended Ionescu from his post. A coroner&#x27;s inquiry in Singapore, which included testimony by the Romanian embassy driver, concluded that Ionescu was solely responsible for the accident. An Interpol Red Notice was subsequently issued for his arrest and possible extradition notwithstanding the fact that Romania had not waived his diplomatic immunity and had commenced criminal proceedings against him in Romania. The Singapore government argued that by reason of Article 39(2) of the Vienna Convention, Ionescu was no longer protected by diplomatic immunity. Ionescu was eventually sentenced to six years in jail.

=====American driver in Pakistan=====

In January 2011 in Lahore, Pakistan, American embassy employee Raymond Allen Davis shot and killed two Pakistani civilians, while a third man was struck and killed by a US consulate car responding to the shooting. According to Davis, they were about to rob him and he acted in self-defense. When detained by police, Davis claimed to be a consultant at the US consulate in Lahore. He was formally arrested and remanded into custody. Further investigations revealed that he was working with the CIA as a contractor in Pakistan. The US State Department declared him a diplomat and repeatedly requested immunity under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, to which Pakistan is a signatory. On 16 March 2011, Davis was released after the families of the two killed men were paid $2.4 million in &quot;diyya&quot; (a form of monetary compensation or blood money). Judges then acquitted him on all charges and Davis immediately departed Pakistan.

=====United Nations driver in Pakistan=====

On 10 April 2011, in Islamabad, Pakistan, Patrick Kibuta, an electrical engineer in the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan caused a vehicle collision with another vehicle, while under the influence of alcohol. Kibuta, who was driving in the opposing lane, injured a Canadian citizen residing in Islamabad, who suffered multiple fractures and required surgery. The Kohsar police impounded Kibuta&#x27;s UN vehicle on the scene, and a blood test confirmed that he had an elevated blood alcohol level. Charges for reckless and drunken driving were filed against Kibuta, who enjoyed diplomatic immunity.

=====American driver in Pakistan=====

On 14 February 2013, a vehicle bearing diplomatic plates registered to the US Embassy got into an accident in Islamabad, Pakistan involving two residents out of which one was killed and the other survived. Murder charges were laid under Section 320 of the Pakistani Penal Code against the driver of the vehicle who is a diplomat according to Pakistani officials.

=====American driver in Kenya=====

In July 2013, Joshua Walde, an American diplomat in Nairobi, Kenya, crashed into a mini-bus, killing one man and seriously injuring eight others, who were left with no financial assistance to pay for hospital bills. United States embassy officials took the diplomat and his family out of Kenya the following day. The United States government was concerned about the impact the accident could have on bilateral relations with Kenya. Walde gave a statement to police, but was not detained due to his diplomatic immunity. Kenyan police say the case remains under investigation.

=====Lebanese driver in South Korea=====

In September 2013, Jad Saeed al-Hassan, Lebanese Ambassador to South Korea, was involved in a hit-and-run in Seoul. Right after the accident, he drove directly into the Lebanese embassy compound and refused to cooperate with the local police investigation, claiming his diplomatic immunity. He stayed in his post as ambassador until his death due to another traffic collision in Seoul in 2014.

=====Qatari driver in the United States=====

On 12 September 2015, Sheikh Khalid bin Hamad Al Thani tried to claim diplomatic immunity when his Ferrari LaFerrari and a Porsche 911 GT3 were caught on camera drag racing through a residential neighborhood in Beverly Hills. He owns the cars and a drag racing team, and is a member of Qatar&#x27;s ruling family. The Beverly Hills Police Department contacted the US State Department to clarify if he had diplomatic immunity. They stated he did not. However, his face was not shown on camera, and no officer witnessed the crime, so the state of California has not yet pressed charges. He has since fled the country. The investigation is ongoing.

=====Saudi driver in Germany=====

In June 2017, in Berlin, Germany a Saudi driver killed a cyclist by opening the door of his Porsche directly into the cyclist&#x27;s path without checking to see if the road was clear. Anger arose when the Saudi claimed diplomatic immunity. Police said that under normal circumstances the driver would face investigation and possible prosecution on suspicion of negligent manslaughter, but prosecutors said they had no choice but to close the case because he had diplomatic immunity.

=====American driver in the United Kingdom=====

On 27 August 2019, Anne Sacoolas, the wife of an American government employee working in the United Kingdom, was a suspect in a traffic incident involving 19-year-old Harry Dunn in Croughton, Northamptonshire, England. Dunn was riding his motorcycle when it was reported that a woman emerged from RAF Croughton driving on the wrong side of the road, resulting in a head-on collision. After 999 handlers wrongly categorized the call, there was a 43-minute wait for an ambulance, resulting in a two-hour delay arriving at a trauma center, where Harry Dunn later died. Sacoolas was breathalyzed at the accident site. The following day, police interviewed Sacoolas at her home, learning the US claimed diplomatic immunity.

Sacoolas told police she had no immediate plans to leave the country. However, on 13 October US authorities notified the UK&#x27;s Foreign and Commonwealth Office of plans to send Sacoolas home, unless serious objections were raised: on 16 October, the UK&#x27;s Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, went to present objections, a day after the family was sent back.

Woody Johnson, U.S. Ambassador to the UK, expressed &quot;profound sadness&quot; at the death of Harry Dunn and the US Embassy also offered their sympathies and condolences. U.S. President Donald Trump called it a &quot;terrible accident&quot; and mentioned that the woman was &quot;driving on the wrong side of the road, and that can happen&quot;. The US government has not waived the diplomatic immunity afforded to Sacoolas and has stated she would not return to the UK, despite calls by the UK government to do so.

Sacoolas was scheduled to appear in UK court via video link charged with causing the death of Mr Dunn by dangerous driving. A hearing took place in Westminster Magistrates Court on the 18th January 2022. She appeared by video-link at the Old Bailey, where she pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving on 20 October 2022. She was handed an eight-month jail term, suspended for 12 months, and was also disqualified from driving for 12 months.

===== American driver in Zimbabwe =====
In 2023, a tragic accident in Zimbabwe claimed the life of 11-year-old Lillian Mapiye when she was struck by a vehicle driven by U.S. diplomat Eric Kimpton.
Invoking diplomatic immunity under the Vienna Convention, Kimpton avoided legal proceedings and returned to the United States. The heartbreaking loss of Lillian sparked discussions between the Zimbabwean government and the U.S.
Embassy, with officials emphasizing that while immunity protects diplomats, it does
not absolve them of their moral responsibility to respect the laws and lives of their host country 

===Financial abuse===

Historically, large debts run up by diplomats have caused many problems. Some financial institutions do not extend credit to diplomats because they have no legal means of ensuring the money be repaid. Local citizens and businesses are often at a disadvantage when filing civil claims against a diplomat, especially in cases of unpaid rent, alimony, and child support.

====Rents====

The bulk of diplomatic debt lies in the rental of office space and living quarters. Individual debts can range from a few thousand dollars to $1 million in back rent. A group of diplomats and the office space in which they work are referred to as a diplomatic mission. Creditors cannot sue missions individually to collect money they owe. Landlords and creditors have found that the only thing they can do is contact a city agency to see if they can try to get some money back. They cannot enter the offices or apartments of diplomats to evict them because the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act says that &quot;the property in the United States of a foreign state shall be immune from attachment, arrest and execution&quot; (). This has led creditors who are owed money by diplomats to become more cautious about their renters and to change their rental or payment policies.

In one case, for example, officials from Zaire stopped paying rent to their private landlord and ran up $400,000 in debt. When the landlord sued, the US State Department defended the Zaireans on the basis of diplomatic immunity, and a circuit court agreed. When the landlord finally cut off the utilities, the officials fled without paying their back rent. The landlords reportedly later reached an &quot;amicable agreement&quot; with the Zairean government.

====Alimony and child support====

The issue of abusing diplomatic immunity in family relations, especially alimony and child support, has become so widespread that it prompted discussion at the 1995 UN Fourth World Conference on Women, in Beijing. Historically, the United Nations has not become involved with family disputes and has refused to garnish the wages of diplomats who owe money for child support, citing sovereign immunity. However, in September 1995, the incumbent head of Legal Affairs for the United Nations acknowledged there was a moral and legal obligation to take at least a partial responsibility in family disputes. Fathers working as diplomats who refused to fulfill their family-related financial duties were increasing in numbers in the United Nations: several men who had left their wives and children were still claiming UN dependency, travel, and education allowances for their families, though they are no longer supporting those families.

====Taxes and fees====

Diplomats are exempt from most taxes, but not from &quot;charges levied for specific services rendered&quot;. In certain cases, whether a payment is or is not considered a tax may be disputed, such as central London&#x27;s congestion charge. It was reported in 2006 that the UAE embassy had agreed to pay their own accumulated charges of nearly £100,000.

There is an obligation for the receiving state not to &quot;discriminate as between states&quot;; in other words, any such fees should be payable by all accredited diplomats equally. This may allow the diplomatic corps to negotiate as a group with the authorities of the receiving country.

Diplomats are exempt from import duty and tariffs for items for their personal use. In some countries, this has led to charges that diplomatic agents are profiting personally from resale of &quot;tax free&quot; goods. The receiving state may choose to impose restrictions on what may reasonably constitute personal use (for example, only a certain quantity of cigarettes per day). When enacted, such restrictions are generally quite generous so as to avoid tit-for-tat responses.

==== Money laundering ====

&quot;United States v. Al Sharaf&quot; is a criminal case which was filed by the government on March 5, 2015, in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. Al Sharaf was a Kuwaiti Financial Attaché assigned to handle the finances of Kuwait Health Office in Washington, D.C. She was charged by the government as she had violated 18 U.S.C § 1956 for conspiring to launder money. Al Sharaf filed a motion to dismiss the case on the basis of lack of subject matter jurisdiction because as per the 22 U.S.C § 254d her actions were immune under the diplomatic immunity that she had. Since it was a criminal case, the prosecution presented evidence beyond a reasonable doubt to prove that Al Sharaf had engaged in commercial activity and her actions were different from her official functions as a representative of Kuwait, thereby, as per the VCDR art. 31(c) her diplomatic immunity was subject to waiver. The court ruled in prosecution&#x27;s favor and stated that since the defendant had engaged in commercial activity which was different from her official functions, her diplomatic immunity was subject to waiver and hence the defendant&#x27;s motion to dismiss the case on the basis of lack of subject matter jurisdiction was denied.

===Espionage and sabotage===

Franz von Papen entered the diplomatic service in December 1913 as a military attaché to the German ambassador in the United States. Starting in September 1914, Papen abused his diplomatic immunity as German military attaché, violating US laws to start organising plans for incursions into Canada for a campaign of sabotage against canals, bridges and railroads. In October 1914, Papen became involved with what was later dubbed &quot;the Hindu–German Conspiracy&quot;, by covertly arranging with Indian nationalists based in California for arms trafficking to the latter for a planned uprising against the British Raj. In February 1915, Papen also covertly organised the Vanceboro international bridge bombing, in which his diplomatic immunity protected him from arrest. At the same time, he remained involved in plans to restore Huerta to power, and arranged for the arming and financing of a planned invasion of Mexico. Papen&#x27;s covert operations were known to British intelligence, which shared its information with the US government. As a result, for complicity in the planning of acts of sabotage on 28 December 1915, Captain von Papen was declared &quot;persona non grata&quot; and recalled to Germany. Upon his return, he was awarded the Iron Cross.

On 24 April 2008, in New Orleans, Mexican press attaché Rafael Quintero Curiel was seen stealing BlackBerry PDA units from a White House press meeting room. Quintero made it all the way to the airport before members of the United States Secret Service caught up with him. He initially denied taking the devices, but after being confronted with security video, Quintero claimed it was purely accidental, gave the devices back, claimed diplomatic immunity and left New Orleans with the Mexican delegation. He was eventually fired for the incident.

In 2021, it was reported that the UAE Embassy in Canberra was building non-compliant fences and installing CCTV.

==In the United States==

The following chart outlines the immunities afforded to foreign diplomatic personnel residing in the United States. In general, these rules follow the Vienna Convention (or the New York Convention for UN officials) and apply in other countries as well (with the exceptions of immunities for United Nations officials, which can vary widely across countries based on the &quot;Host Country Agreement&quot; signed between the UN and the host country, whereby additional immunities beyond those granted by the New York Convention may be established).

<text>Double Data Rate Synchronous Dynamic Random-Access Memory (DDR SDRAM) is a double data rate (DDR) synchronous dynamic random-access memory (SDRAM) class of memory integrated circuits used in computers. DDR SDRAM, also retroactively called DDR1 SDRAM, has been superseded by DDR2 SDRAM, DDR3 SDRAM, DDR4 SDRAM and DDR5 SDRAM. None of its successors are forward or backward compatible with DDR1 SDRAM, meaning DDR2, DDR3, DDR4 and DDR5 memory modules will not work on DDR1-equipped motherboards, and vice versa.

Compared to single data rate (SDR) SDRAM, the DDR SDRAM interface makes higher transfer rates possible through more strict control of the timing of the electrical data and clock signals. Implementations often have to use schemes such as phase-locked loops and self-calibration to reach the required timing accuracy. The interface uses double pumping (transferring data on both the rising and falling edges of the clock signal) to double data bus bandwidth without a corresponding increase in clock frequency. One advantage of keeping the clock frequency low is that it reduces the signal integrity requirements on the circuit board connecting the memory to the controller. The name &quot;double data rate&quot; refers to the fact that a DDR SDRAM with a certain clock frequency achieves nearly twice the bandwidth of a SDR SDRAM running at the same clock frequency, due to this double pumping.

With data being transferred 64 bits at a time, DDR SDRAM gives a transfer rate (in bytes/s) of (memory bus clock rate) × 2 (for dual rate) × 64 (number of bits transferred) / 8 (number of bits/byte). Thus, with a bus frequency of 100 MHz, DDR SDRAM gives a maximum transfer rate of 1600 MB/s.

== History ==

In the late 1980s IBM invented DDR SDRAM, they built a dual-edge clocking RAM and presented their results at the International Solid-State Circuits Convention in 1990.

Samsung released the first commercial DDR SDRAM chip (64Mbit) in June 1998, followed soon after by Hyundai Electronics (now SK Hynix) the same year. DDR SDRAM specification was finalized by JEDEC in June 2000 (JESD79). JEDEC has set standards for the data rates of DDR SDRAM, divided into two parts. The first specification is for memory chips, and the second is for memory modules. The first retail PC motherboard using DDR SDRAM was released in August 2000.

== Specification ==


=== Modules ===
To increase memory capacity and bandwidth, chips are combined on a module. For instance, the 64-bit data bus for DIMM requires eight 8-bit chips, addressed in parallel. Multiple chips with common address lines are called a memory rank. The term was introduced to avoid confusion with chip internal rows and banks. A memory module may bear more than one rank. The term sides would also be confusing because it incorrectly suggests the physical placement of chips on the module. All ranks are connected to the same memory bus (address + data). The chip select signal is used to issue commands to specific rank.

Adding modules to the single memory bus creates additional electrical load on its drivers. To mitigate the resulting bus signaling rate drop and overcome the memory bottleneck, new chipsets employ the multi-channel architecture.

Note: All items listed above are specified by JEDEC as JESD79F. All RAM data rates in-between or above these listed specifications are not standardized by JEDEC – often they are simply manufacturer optimizations using tighter tolerances or overvolted chips. The package sizes in which DDR SDRAM is manufactured are also standardized by JEDEC.

There is no architectural difference between DDR SDRAM modules. Modules are instead designed to run at different clock frequencies: for example, a PC-1600 module is designed to run at , and a PC-2100 is designed to run at . A module&#x27;s clock speed designates the data rate at which it is guaranteed to perform, hence it is guaranteed to run at lower (&quot;underclocking&quot;) and can possibly run at higher (&quot;overclocking&quot;) clock rates than those for which it was made.

DDR SDRAM modules for desktop computers, dual in-line memory modules (DIMMs), have 184 pins (as opposed to 168 pins on SDRAM, or 240 pins on DDR2 SDRAM), and can be differentiated from SDRAM DIMMs by the number of notches (DDR SDRAM has one, SDRAM has two). DDR SDRAM for notebook computers, SO-DIMMs, have 200 pins, which is the same number of pins as DDR2 SO-DIMMs. These two specifications are notched very similarly and care must be taken during insertion if unsure of a correct match. Most DDR SDRAM operates at a voltage of 2.5 V, compared to 3.3 V for SDRAM. This can significantly reduce power consumption. Chips and modules with the DDR-400/PC-3200 standard have a nominal voltage of 2.6 V.

JEDEC Standard No. 21–C defines three possible operating voltages for 184 pin DDR, as identified by the key notch position relative to its centreline. Page 4.5.10-7 defines 2.5V (left), 1.8V (centre), TBD (right), while page 4.20.5–40 nominates 3.3V for the right notch position. The orientation of the module for determining the key notch position is with 52 contact positions to the left and 40 contact positions to the right.

Increasing the operating voltage slightly can increase maximum speed but at the cost of higher power dissipation and heating, and at the risk of malfunctioning or damage.

;Capacity
;Number of DRAM devices: The number of chips is a multiple of 8 for non-ECC modules and a multiple of 9 for ECC modules. Chips can occupy one side (&quot;single sided&quot;) or both sides (&quot;dual sided&quot;) of the module. The maximal number of chips per DDR module is 36 (9×4) for ECC and 32 (8x4) for non-ECC.
;ECC vs non-ECC: Modules that have error-correcting code are labeled as ECC. Modules without error correcting code are labeled non-ECC.
;Timings: CAS latency (CL), clock cycle time (tCK), row cycle time (tRC), refresh row cycle time (tRFC), row active time (tRAS).
;Buffering: Registered (or buffered) vs unbuffered.
;Packaging: Typically DIMM or SO-DIMM.
;Power consumption: A test with DDR and DDR2 RAM in 2005 found that average power consumption appeared to be of the order of 1–3 W per 512 MB module; this increases with clock rate and when in use rather than idling. A manufacturer has produced calculators to estimate the power used by various types of RAM.

Module and chip characteristics are inherently linked.

Total module capacity is a product of one chip&#x27;s capacity and the number of chips. ECC modules multiply it by because they use 1 bit per byte (8 bits) for error correction. A module of any particular size can therefore be assembled either from 32 small chips (36 for ECC memory), or 16(18) or 8(9) bigger ones.

DDR memory bus width per channel is 64 bits (72 for ECC memory). Total module bit width is a product of bits per chip and number of chips. It also equals number of ranks (rows) multiplied by DDR memory bus width. Consequently, a module with a greater number of chips or using ×8 chips instead of ×4 will have more ranks.

This example compares different real-world server memory modules with a common size of 1 GB. One should definitely be careful buying 1 GB memory modules, because all these variations can be sold under one price position without stating whether they are ×4 or ×8, single- or dual-ranked.

There is a common belief that number of module ranks equals number of sides. As above data shows, this is not true. One can also find 2-side/1-rank modules. One can even think of a 1-side/2-rank memory module having 16(18) chips on single side ×8 each, but it is unlikely such a module was ever produced.

=== Chip characteristics ===

;DRAM density: Size of the chip is measured in megabits. Most motherboards recognize only 1 GB modules if they contain &quot;64M×8&quot; chips (&quot;low density&quot;). If &quot;128M×4&quot; (&quot;high density&quot;) 1 GB modules are used, they most likely will not work. The JEDEC standard allows &quot;128M×4&quot; only for registered modules designed specifically for servers, but some generic manufacturers do not comply.
;Organization: The notation like &quot;64M×4&quot; means that the memory matrix has 64 million (the product of &quot;banks&quot; x &quot;rows&quot; x &quot;columns&quot;) 4-bit storage locations. There are &quot;×4, ×8,&quot; and &quot;×16&quot; DDR chips. The &quot;×4&quot; chips allow the use of advanced error correction features like Chipkill, memory scrubbing and Intel SDDC in server environments, while the &quot;×8&quot; and &quot;×16&quot; chips are somewhat less expensive. &quot;x8&quot; chips are mainly used in desktops/notebooks but are making an entry into the server market. There are normally 4 banks and only one row can be active in each bank.

==== Double data rate (DDR) SDRAM specification ====
From Ballot JCB-99-70, and modified by numerous other Board Ballots, formulated under the cognizance of Committee JC-42.3 on DRAM Parametrics.

Standard No. 79 Revision Log:
*Release 1, June 2000
*Release 2, May 2002
*Release C, March 2003 – JEDEC Standard No. 79C.

&quot;This comprehensive standard defines all required aspects of 64Mb through 1Gb DDR SDRAMs with X4/X8/X16 data interfaces, including features, functionality, ac and dc parametrics, packages and pin assignments. This scope will subsequently be expanded to formally apply to x32 devices, and higher density devices as well.&quot;

=== Organization ===
PC3200 is DDR SDRAM designed to operate at 200 MHz using DDR-400 chips with a bandwidth of 3,200 MB/s. Because PC3200 memory transfers data on both the rising and falling clock edges, its effective clock rate is 400 MHz.

1 GB PC3200 non-ECC modules are usually made with 16 512 Mbit chips, 8 on each side (512 Mbits × 16 chips) / (8 bits (per byte)) = 1,024 MB. The individual chips making up a 1 GB memory module are usually organized as 226 8-bit words, commonly expressed as 64M×8. Memory manufactured in this way is low-density RAM and is usually compatible with any motherboard specifying PC3200 DDR-400 memory.

== Generations ==
DDR (DDR1) was superseded by DDR2 SDRAM, which had modifications for a higher clock frequency and again doubled throughput, but operates on the same principle as DDR. Competing with DDR2 was Rambus XDR DRAM. DDR2 dominated due to cost and support factors. DDR2 was in turn superseded by DDR3 SDRAM, which offered higher performance for increased bus speeds and new features. DDR3 has been superseded by DDR4 SDRAM, which was first produced in 2011 and whose standards were still in flux (2012) with significant architectural changes.

DDR&#x27;s prefetch buffer depth is 2 (bits), while DDR2 uses 4. Although the effective clock rates of DDR2 are higher than DDR, the overall performance was not greater in the early implementations, primarily due to the high latencies of the first DDR2 modules. DDR2 started to be effective by the end of 2004, as modules with lower latencies became available.

Memory manufacturers stated that it was impractical to mass produce DDR1 memory with effective transfer rates in excess of 400 MHz (i.e. 400 MT/s and 200 MHz external clock) due to internal speed limitations. DDR2 picks up where DDR1 leaves off, utilizing internal clock rates similar to DDR1, but is available at effective transfer rates of 400 MHz and higher. DDR3 advances extended the ability to preserve internal clock rates while providing higher effective transfer rates by again doubling the prefetch depth.

The DDR4 SDRAM is a high-speed dynamic random-access memory internally configured as 16 banks, 4 bank groups with 4 banks for each bank group for ×4/×8 and 8 banks, 2 bank groups with 4 banks for each bank group for ×16 DRAM.
The DDR4 SDRAM uses an 8&quot;n&quot; prefetch architecture to achieve high-speed operation. The 8&quot;n&quot; prefetch architecture is combined with
an interface designed to transfer two data words per clock cycle at the I/O pins. A single read or write operation for the DDR4 SDRAM consists of a single 8&quot;n&quot;-bit-wide 4-clock data transfer at the internal DRAM core and 8 corresponding &quot;n&quot;-bit-wide half-clock-cycle data transfers at the I/O pins.

RDRAM was a particularly expensive alternative to DDR SDRAM, and most manufacturers dropped its support from their chipsets. DDR1 memory&#x27;s prices substantially increased from Q2 2008, while DDR2 prices declined. In January 2009, 1 GB DDR1 was 2–3 times more expensive than 1 GB DDR2. 

=== Mobile DDR ===
MDDR is an acronym that some enterprises use for Mobile DDR SDRAM, a type of memory used in some portable electronic devices, like mobile phones, handhelds, and digital audio players. Through techniques including reduced voltage supply and advanced refresh options, Mobile DDR can achieve greater power efficiency.

<text>Keno Don Hugo Rosa (), known as Don Rosa (born June 29, 1951), is an American comic book writer and illustrator known for his Disney comics stories about Scrooge McDuck, Donald Duck, and other characters which Carl Barks created for Disney-licensed comic books, first published in America by Dell Comics. Many of his stories are built on characters and locations created by Barks; among these was his first Duck story, &quot;The Son of the Sun&quot; (1987), which was nominated for a Harvey Award in the &quot;Best Story of the Year&quot; category.

Rosa created about 90 stories between 1987 and 2006. In 1995, his 12-chapter work &quot;The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck&quot; won the Eisner Award for Best Serialized Story.

==Early life==
Don Rosa&#x27;s grandfather, Gioachino Rosa, lived in Maniago, a town at the foot of the Alps in Northern Italy, in the province of Pordenone. He immigrated to Kentucky, the United States, around 1900, established a successful tile and terrazzo company, then returned to Italy to marry and start a family. In 1915 just after the birth of his son Ugo Rosa, Gioachino returned to Kentucky with his wife, two daughters and two sons. Ugo Rosa grew up and was later married in Kentucky. His wife was born to a German-American father and a mother with both Scottish and Irish ancestry.

Don Rosa was born Keno Don Hugo Rosa on June 29, 1951, in Louisville, Kentucky. He was named after both his father and grandfather. Gioachino was called &quot;Keno&quot; for short. Don&#x27;s father was named Ugo Dante Rosa but used the name &quot;Hugo Don&quot; Rosa in America.

Rosa&#x27;s older sister, Deanna, was an avid collector of comics and exposed Don to comics as a storytelling medium at a very early age, teaching him to “read the pictures.”

Rosa&#x27;s favorite comic books while growing up were &quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot; and &quot;Little Lulu&quot; comics from Dell Comics, as well as his sister&#x27;s collection of MAD magazines. At age 12, Rosa discovered the Superman titles of DC Comics, with particular attention to editor Mort Weisinger&#x27;s period, drawn mostly by Superman artists Curt Swan and Kurt Schaffenberger. Shortly after Rosa started to collect Superman comics, he also began to trade in the comics he had inherited from his older sister for old Superman comics. By the 1970s Rosa&#x27;s comic trading had ended up with him only having two Barks duck comics issues left from the collection his sister originally passed on to him. One of them being &quot;Dell Comics&#x27; Four Color Comics #386&quot; (also known as Dell Comics&#x27; One shot&#x27;s) issue titled: &quot;Uncle Scrooge in Only a Poor Old Man&quot;, which was unknown to him to be the first issue of the new Carl Barks Uncle Scrooge Title. The second issue is his other favorite Barks Comic from his youth, Dell&#x27;s Donald Duck in &quot;The Golden Helmet&quot;. Later when Rosa became a serious collector of all comics of the post-war years, he particularly enjoyed and collected the classic E.C. Comics of the horror and science fiction genres published in the early 1950s, Will Eisner&#x27;s &quot;The Spirit&quot;, Walt Kelly&#x27;s &quot;Pogo&quot;, and virtually all other comics from 1945 and onward.

Rosa entered the University of Kentucky in 1969. He graduated in 1973 with a Bachelor of Science degree in civil engineering.

==Career==
In 1969, while still in college, Rosa won an award as &quot;best political cartoonist in the nation in a college paper&quot;. &quot;I&#x27;m not really an editorial cartoonist. I&#x27;d much rather be doing comedy adventure. But I must have done something right, for at one point &quot;The Journal of Higher Education&quot; named me one of the five or six best college newspaper cartoonists in the nation.&quot;
Rosa&#x27;s first published comic (besides the spot illustrations in his grade school and high school newspapers) was a comic strip featuring his own character, Lancelot Pertwillaby, titled &quot;The Pertwillaby Papers&quot;. He created the strip in 1971 for &quot;The Kentucky Kernel&quot;, a college newspaper of the University of Kentucky, which wanted the strip to focus on political satire.

Rosa later switched the strip to comedy-adventure, his favorite style of comics, and drew the story &quot;Lost in (an alternative section of) the Andes&quot;. (The title is a reference to &quot;Lost in the Andes!&quot;, a Donald Duck story by Carl Barks, first published in April 1949.) The so-called &quot;Pertwillaby Papers&quot; included 127 published episodes by the time Rosa graduated in 1973.

Meanwhile, Rosa participated in contributing art and articles to comic collector fanzines. One contribution was &quot;An Index of Uncle Scrooge Comics&quot;. According to his introduction: &quot;Scrooge being my favorite character in comic history and Barks my favorite pure cartoonist, I&#x27;ll try not to get carried away too much.&quot; In 1970, he drew a Donald Duck fancomic titled &quot;Return to Duckburg Place&quot;, depicting a dark and dystopian vision of the future of Duckburg, and unsuccessfully submitted it to a fanzine for publication.

After attaining his bachelor&#x27;s degree, Rosa continued to draw comics purely as a hobby, his only income came from working in the &quot;Keno Rosa Tile and Terrazzo Company&quot;, a company founded by his paternal grandfather.

Rosa authored and illustrated the monthly &quot;Information Center&quot; column in the fanzine &quot;Rocket&#x27;s Blast Comicollector&quot; from 1974 to 1979. This was a question-and-answer feature dealing with readers&#x27; queries on all forms of pop entertainment of which Rosa was a student, including comics, TV and movies. He also revived the &quot;Pertwillaby Papers&quot; in this &quot;RBCC&quot; fanzine as a comic book style story rather than a newspaper comic strip from 1976 to 1978.

Rosa accepted an offer from the editor of the local newspaper to create a weekly comic strip. This led to his creation of the comic strip character Captain Kentucky for the Saturday edition of the local newspaper &quot;Louisville Times&quot;. Captain Kentucky was the superhero alter ego of Lancelot Pertwillaby. The pay was $25/week and not worth the 12+ hours each week&#x27;s strip entailed, but Rosa did it as part of his hobby. Publication started on October 6, 1979. The comic strip ended on August 15, 1982, after the publication of 150 episodes. After three years with Captain Kentucky, Don decided that it was not worth the effort. He retired from cartooning and did not draw a single line for the next four years. Years later, as his fame grew, his non-Disney work was published by the Norwegian publisher Gazette Bok in 2001, in the two hard cover &quot;Don Rosa Archives&quot; volumes, &quot;The Pertwillaby Papers&quot; and &quot;The Adventures of Captain Kentucky&quot;.

===Gladstone===
In 1986, Rosa discovered a Gladstone Comics comic book. This was the first American comic book that contained Disney characters since Western Publishing&#x27;s discontinuation of their Whitman Comics in the 1970s. Since early childhood Don Rosa had been fascinated by Carl Barks&#x27; stories about Donald Duck and Scrooge McDuck. He immediately called the editor, Byron Erickson, and told him that he was the only American who was born to write and draw one Scrooge McDuck adventure. Erickson agreed to let him send a story, and Don Rosa started drawing his first Duck story, &quot;The Son of the Sun,&quot; the very next day.

&quot;The Son of the Sun&quot; was a success and Rosa&#x27;s very first professional comic story was nominated for a Harvey Award &quot;Best Story of the Year&quot;. The plot of the story was the same as his earlier story, &quot;Lost in (an alternative section of) the Andes&quot;. As Don Rosa explained it, he was just &quot;(...) turning that old Pertwillaby Papers adventure back into the story it originally was in my head, starring Scrooge, Donald, the nephews, and Flintheart Glomgold.&quot;

Rosa created a few more comics for Gladstone until 1989. He then stopped working for them, because the policies of their licensor, Disney, did not allow for the return of original art for a story to its creators.

After making some stories for the Dutch publisher Oberon, the publishers of an American Disney children&#x27;s magazine called &quot;DuckTales&quot; (based on the animated series of the same name) offered Rosa employment. They even offered him a much higher salary than the one he received at Gladstone. Rosa made just one script (&quot;Back in Time for a Dime&quot;). The publishers never asked him to make more, and due to problems with receiving the payment, he did not care.

===Egmont===

After working with the &quot;DuckTales&quot; magazine, Rosa found out that the Denmark-based International publisher Egmont (at that time called Gutenberghus) was publishing reprints of his stories and wanted more. Rosa joined Egmont in 1990. Two years later, at Rosa&#x27;s suggestion, Byron Erickson, the former editor at Gladstone, also went to work for Egmont and has been working there ever since as an editor and later as a freelancer.

In 1991 Rosa started creating &quot;The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck&quot;, a 12 chapter story about his favorite character. The series was a success, and in 1995 he won an Eisner Award for best continuing series. After the end of the original series, Rosa sometimes produced additional &quot;missing&quot; chapters. Some of the extra chapters were turned down by Egmont, because they were not interested in any more episodes. Fortunately, the French magazine &quot;Picsou&quot; was eager to publish the stories. From 1999, Rosa started working freelance for Picsou magazine as well. All of these chapters were compiled as &quot;The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck Companion&quot;.

===On strike===
During early summer 2002, Rosa suddenly laid down work. As an artist, he could not live under the conditions Egmont was offering him but he did not want to give up making Scrooge McDuck comics either. So, his only choice was to go on hiatus and try to come to an agreement with Egmont. His main issues were that he had no control over his works. Rosa had discovered too often that his stories were printed with incorrect pages of art, improper colors, poor lettering, or pixelated computer conversions of the illustrations. Rosa has never, nor has any other artist working on Disney-licensed characters, received royalties for the use or multi-national reprinting of any of his stories worldwide.

Rosa came to an agreement with Egmont in December of the same year, which gave him more control over the stories and the manner in which they were publicized.

===Quitting===
Rosa, who had poor eyesight since childhood, experienced a severe retinal detachment in March 2008, which required emergency eye surgery. However, the surgery was only partially successful, and Rosa had to undergo further surgery in both eyes, making drawing even more challenging. In an interview at the Danish Komiks.dk fair on June 2, 2008, Rosa announced his decision not to continue creating comics due to various reasons such as his eye troubles, low pay, and the use of his stories by international Disney licensees in special hardback or album editions without payment of royalties or permission for the use of his name.

In 2012, Rosa wrote an essay about his retirement for Egmont&#x27;s 9-volume &quot;Don Rosa Collection&quot;, which was to be published in Finland, Norway, Germany and Sweden. The essay, posted at &quot;career-end.donrosa.de&quot;, cites the above reasons, with special emphasis on the &quot;Disney comics system&quot; for paying writers and artists a flat per-page rate, and then allowing publishers around the world to print the stories without payment to the creators.

Rosa is more popular with readers in Europe than in his native United States. According to him, even his next-door neighbors do not know his profession.

==Personal life==
In 1980, Rosa married Ann Payne. Payne is a retired social studies middle school teacher.

=== Character ===
Don Rosa describes himself as an introvert due to being socially isolated as a child. Also, he thinks of himself as a workaholic.

Rosa suffered from depression during the years before he quit. He believes that it was caused by working hard while taking little time for leisure, a result of his self-imposed work regimen due to his enthusiasm for Barks&#x27; characters.

===Hobbies===
Rosa is an avid collector of many things, including comic books, &quot;TV Guide&quot;, &quot;National Geographic&quot;, and movie magazines, fanzines, books, White Castle memorabilia, pinball machines and movies and more.

Rosa also grows exotic chili plants and tends nearly 30 acres of a private nature preserve with wildflower fields and numerous forest trails. That and taking semi-annual European signing tours to visit his fellow BarksDucks fans, takes up all of his time. He is also working to complete his collections of all American comic books published between 1945 and 1970.

==Work==

In Europe, Rosa is recognized as one of the best Disney comics creators. Carl Barks and Rosa are among the few artists who have their name written on the covers of Disney magazines when their stories are published. Rosa enjoys including subtle references to his favourite movies and comics as well as his own previous work. He normally uses about twelve panels per page, instead of the more common eight.

Rosa has an especially large following in Finland, and in 1999, he created a special 32-page adventure featuring Scrooge McDuck for his Finnish fans called; &quot;Sammon Salaisuus&quot; (translates to &quot;The secret of the Sampo&quot;, but it is officially named &quot;The Quest for Kalevala&quot; in English), based on the Finnish national epic, the Kalevala. The publication of this story created a national sensation in Finland where Donald Duck and the Kalevala are important aspects of culture. It was published in many other countries as well. The cover for the comic book was a spoof of a famous painting by Akseli Gallen-Kallela.

The latest work that Rosa has worked on is a cover for the album &quot;Music Inspired by the Life and Times of Scrooge&quot; by Tuomas Holopainen from Nightwish who is a fan of Rosa&#x27;s comics.

===Drawing style===
With a Bachelor of Arts degree in civil engineering as his only real drawing education, Rosa has some unusual drawing methods, as he writes: &quot;I suspect &quot;nothing&quot; I do is done the way anyone else does it.&quot;

Because of being self-taught in making comics, Rosa relies mostly on the skills he learned in engineering school, which means using technical pens and templates extensively. He applies templates and other engineering tools to draw what other artists draw freehand. He usually drew just under a page per day, but that depended on the amount of detail he puts in the picture.

Rosa&#x27;s drawing style is considered much more detailed and &quot;dirtier&quot; than that of most Disney artists, living or dead, and often likened to that of underground artists, and he is frequently compared to Robert Crumb. When Rosa was first told of this similarity, he said that he &quot;drew that bad&quot; long before he discovered underground comics during college. He went on to explain these similarities to underground artists with a similar background of making comics as a hobby:

:&quot;I think that both my style and that of Robert Crumb are similar only because we both grew up making comics for our personal enjoyment, without ever taking drawing seriously, and without ever trying to attain a style that would please the average comics publisher. We drew comics for fun!&quot;

===Carl Barks===

&quot;I want to take everything Barks wrote and forge it into a workable timeline. My original dream was to become the new Carl Barks. I wanted to write, draw, and letter all my own stories. People tell me that my pencils look just like Barks, but my inks are pure Rosa, and I can&#x27;t letter properly! So I&#x27;ll have to settle for being Don Rosa.&quot; – Don Rosa in 1987

&quot;Don Rosa has often been called the heir of Carl Barks, especially for the way in which he has carried on the Ducks&#x27; Family Saga. But I don&#x27;t think so: in my opinion Don Rosa [...] is an author who has used Barks&#x27; characters to make stories that are completely new, &#x27;Donrosian&#x27; rather than &#x27;Barksian&#x27;, just like Barks can&#x27;t be considered the heir of Al Taliaferro only because he has worked on the Ducks after him.&quot; – Carlo Chendi, Italian Disney comics writer

Rosa&#x27;s idol when it comes to comics is Carl Barks. Rosa builds almost all his stories on characters and locations that Barks invented. Many of Rosa&#x27;s stories contain references to some fact pointed out in a Barks story. At the request of publishers in response to reader demands, Rosa has even created sequels of old Barks stories. For example, his &quot;Return to Plain Awful&quot; is a sequel to &quot;Lost in the Andes!&quot;, where the Ducks return to the same hidden country. To add more to his admiration and consistency to Barks and Barks&#x27; stories, Rosa makes all his ducks&#x27; stories set in the 1950s. This is because Barks writes most of the stories about Scrooge, Donald and all people of Duckburg in the 1950s (it also conveniently resolves potential continuity problems, such as Scrooge&#x27;s age). As explained in text pages in the &quot;Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck&quot; and its companion volume, Rosa does intense research of time periods to ensure not only that he gets the physical details right, but also to ensure that all characters could have been present.

Barks either created most of the characters used by Rosa or is credited for greatly developing their personalities. Rosa thus feels obliged to make his stories factually consistent. He has spent a lot of time in making lists of facts and anecdotes pointed out in different stories by his mentor. Especially &quot;The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck&quot; was based mostly on the earlier works of Barks. Rosa admitted however that a scene of the first chapter was inspired by a story by Tony Strobl.

As most of the characters Rosa uses were created by Barks, and because Rosa considers Scrooge rather than Donald to be the main character of the Duck universe, he does not regard himself as a pure Disney artist, nor the characters really as Disney&#x27;s. &quot;Rosa prefers to say that the characters he uses are Barks&#x27;s, Barks having reshaped Donald Duck&#x27;s personality and creating everything else we know of Duckburg while working as a freelancer in 1942–1967 for an independent licensed publisher (Dell/Western Comics). Barks even claimed to have also created Huey, Dewey, and Louie while working as a writer on Donald Duck animated cartoons in 1937.&quot; Because of his idolization of Barks, he repeatedly discourages his fans to use an absolutist way of saying his clearly different drawing style would be better than Barks&#x27;s, and he found that notion confirmed when Barks himself spoke about Rosa&#x27;s style in a critical tone though it is uncertain whether those comments were Barks&#x27;s or those of his temporary &quot;business managers&quot; who filtered his communications.

&quot;I usually don&#x27;t like my stories. I mean I try really hard, but I know I don&#x27;t draw that well. I know people like it because it&#x27;s got lots of extra details, but art directors know good artwork, and they know mine is not good artwork. Now, people always say, &#x27;You&#x27;re being too modest, you&#x27;re being too modest&#x27;, and I say, &#x27;What?&#x27; They just have to ask me the right question. I know it&#x27;s not good artwork and I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s well-drawn, but I know it&#x27;s entertaining.&quot; – Don Rosa, Torino Comics Festival, April 2011

&quot;Don Rosa has a style that is a little bit different from the Disney style. I know that there is a great deal of people that like that style, which is extremely detailed. So, there is room in the business for artists like Don Rosa and for others like Van Horn. They have a different style. But if they have a good story and tell it properly, then people are going to like it.&quot; – Carl Barks, interview given at Disneyland Paris, July 7, 1994

Beside Rosa&#x27;s constant effort to remain faithful to the universe Barks created, there is also a number of notable differences between the two artists. The most obvious of these is Rosa&#x27;s much more detailed drawing style, often with many background gags, which has been credited as being a result of Rosa&#x27;s love of the Will Elder stories of &quot;MAD&quot; comics and magazines. While Barks himself discouraged the use of extreme grimacing and gesturing in any other panel for comical or dramatic effect, Rosa&#x27;s stories are rich with exaggerated facial expressions and physical slapstick. Barks had over 600 Duck stories to his name while Rosa only created 85 until his eye trouble set in, but whereas Barks made many short one and two-pagers centered around a subtle, compact gag, Rosa&#x27;s oeuvre consists almost exclusively of long adventure stories.

Andrea &quot;Bramo&quot; Bramini identifies the following four differences between Barks&#x27;s and Rosa&#x27;s way of storytelling:
* Rosa follows a very strict continuity, while Barks paid very little attention to continuity between stories.
* Rosa&#x27;s characterization of Scrooge is that of a much more sentimental person for often relishing his memories of past adventures.
* Barks situated his stories in the present day of when he was creating them and had a penchant for satire. Rosa strictly writes stories taking place in an era at least half a century prior to their creation, and mostly abstains from any political or social commentary.
* With his engineering degree, Rosa often goes to great lengths to give scientifically plausible explanations within his stories, whereas Barks never cared much for any detailed scientific rationalizations to his stories.

===D.U.C.K.===
Most of Rosa&#x27;s stories have the letters D.U.C.K. hidden within either the first panel or, if Rosa has created the cover art, within the cover art itself. D.U.C.K. is a backronym for &quot;Dedicated to Unca Carl from Keno&quot; (Carl being Carl Barks and Keno being Rosa&#x27;s given first name). Due to Disney&#x27;s refusal to allow artists to sign their work, early Rosa dedications to Barks were deleted as they seemed to be a form of a signature. Later Rosa began hiding the dedication acronym from his editors in various and unlikely places within his drawings.

Rosa has drawn covers for reprints of Carl Barks stories and has included his D.U.C.K. dedication within them as well.

===Mickey===
Another curiosity is his Hidden Mickeys. Rosa is only interested in creating stories featuring the Duck family, but he often hides small Mickey Mouse heads or figures in the pictures, sometimes in a humiliating or unwanted situation. An example of this is in the story &quot;The Terror of the Transvaal&quot; where a flat Mickey can be seen under an elephant&#x27;s foot. Rosa has admitted to neither liking nor disliking Mickey Mouse, but being indifferent to him.

In the story &quot;Attack of the Hideous Space-Varmints&quot;, the asteroid with Uncle Scrooge&#x27;s money bin on it crashes into the Moon along with two missiles, creating a large Mickey Mouse head on the surface. When Huey, Dewey, and Louie tell Donald that the missiles hit the &quot;dark&quot; (far) side of the Moon, Donald is thankful no one is going to see it  — &quot;For a minute there, I thought we were going to have some legal problems.&quot;

In the second Rosa story featuring The Three Caballeros, Donald Duck is shocked by the sight of a capybara standing on its hind legs, with shrubs, leaves and fruit in front of its body, coincidentally making it look like Mickey Mouse. José Carioca and Panchito Pistoles, never having seen Mickey Mouse, ask Donald what is wrong, but Donald replies he is just tired. Later in the same story, the Caballeros free several animals from a poacher. One panel shows the animals fleeing; Mickey can be seen among them.

In &quot;The Quest for Kalevala&quot; this running gag can be seen on the original, Akseli Gallen-Kallela-inspired cover art. In the original work, Louhi is depicted as bare-chested, but the Disneyfied version has been drawn a top, of fabric patterned with Mickey Mouse heads.

==Awards==

His work has won Rosa a great deal of recognition in the industry, including nominations for the Comics&#x27; Buyer&#x27;s Guide Award for Favorite Writer in 1997, 1998, and 1999. Heidi MacDonald of Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide also mentioned Rosa&#x27;s 1994 story &quot;Guardians of the Lost Library&quot; as &quot;possibly the greatest comic book story of all time&quot;.

In 1995, Rosa was awarded the Eisner Award for Best Serialized Story for &quot;The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck&quot;. In 1997 he won an Eisner for Best Artist/Writer – Humor Category. He was awarded the Inkpot Award in 2014.

Rosa&#x27;s story &quot;The Black Knight GLORPS Again!&quot; was nominated for the 2007 Eisner Award in the category Best Short Story. While &quot;The Prisoner of White Agony Creek&quot;, Rosa&#x27;s latest Duck story to-date, was published in 2006, he was also nominated for the 2007 Harvey Awards in five categories (more than any other creator was that year) for his Uncle Scrooge comics: &quot;Best Writer&quot;, &quot;Best Artist&quot;, &quot;Best Cartoonist&quot;, &quot;Best Cover Artist&quot;, and &quot;Special Award for Humor in Comics.&quot; In 2013 Rosa received the Bill Finger Award which recognizes excellence in comic book writing for writers who have not received their rightful reward and/or recognition.

International &quot;Best Cartoonist of the Year&quot; awards include:
*Germany: International Grand Prize 2005 (Frankfurt Book Fair).
*Denmark: ORLA Award (DR Television Network).

==Biographies==
In 1997 the Italian publishing house Editrice ComicArt published a lavish volume about Rosa&#x27;s biography and work related to the Disney characters. It was titled &quot;Don Rosa e il Rinascimento Disneyano&quot; (&quot;Don Rosa and the Disneyean Renaissance&quot;) and written by famous Disney and Rosa scholars, Alberto Becattini, Leonardo Gori and Francesco Stajano. This work not only discusses all of Rosa&#x27;s creative life up to 1997, but it also gives a comprehensive biography, lists up to that date his Disney work and presents an extensive interview with Rosa.

In 2009, Danish director Sebastian S. Cordes shot a 75-minute documentary called &quot;The Life and Times of Don Rosa&quot;, consisting of exclusive interviews with Rosa himself on his farm near Louisville, Kentucky. According to the project&#x27;s Facebook group, the English-language DVD was released in Denmark on April 16, 2011.

In 2011, Italian Disney fan forum &quot;papersera.net&quot; published &quot;Don Rosa: A Little Something Special&quot; (edited by Italian Rosa fan Paolo Castagno), a large folio format, bilingual (Italian and English) book about Rosa&#x27;s life and work, containing interviews with Rosa and articles by many Italian and European Disney artists, Disney scholars, and established art critics commenting on Rosa&#x27;s work and career, also including many exclusive, rare Rosa drawings and illustrations. The book was originally made as a gift by &quot;papersera.net&quot; for Rosa himself upon the occasion of Rosa&#x27;s April 2011 visit to Turin, Italy.

In 2017 the book, &quot;I Still Get Chills!&quot;, featuring text by German journalist Alex Jakubowski and photographs by Lois Lammerhuber, was published by Edition Lammerhuber in honour of Rosa&#x27;s 66th birthday and the 70th anniversary of the first appearance of Scrooge McDuck.

A feature documentary about Don Rosa and Scrooge McDuck by French director Morgann Gicquel titled &quot;The Scrooge Mystery&quot; was released in December 2017 and was released on DVD and Blu-ray in 2018.

<text>Dziga Vertov (, born David Abelevich Kaufman, , and also known as Denis Kaufman; – 12 February 1954) was a Soviet pioneer documentary film and newsreel director, as well as a cinema theorist. His filming practices and theories influenced the cinéma vérité style of documentary movie-making and the Dziga Vertov Group, a radical film-making cooperative which was active from 1968 to 1972. He was a member of the Kinoks collective, with Elizaveta Svilova and Mikhail Kaufman.

In the 2012 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; poll, critics voted Vertov&#x27;s &quot;Man with a Movie Camera&quot; (1929) the eighth-greatest film ever made.

Vertov&#x27;s younger brothers Boris Kaufman and Mikhail Kaufman were also noted filmmakers, as was his wife, Yelizaveta Svilova. He worked with Boris Kaufman and cinematographer Mikhail Kaufman on his most famous film &quot;Man with a Movie Camera&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Vertov was born David Abelevich Kaufman into a Jewish family in Białystok, Poland, then a part of the Russian Empire. He Russified his Jewish name and patronymic, David Abelevich, to Denis Arkadievich at some point after 1918. Vertov studied music at Białystok Conservatory until his family fled from the invading German Army to Moscow in 1915. The Kaufmans soon settled in Petrograd, where Vertov began writing poetry, science fiction, and satire. In 1916–1917 Vertov was studying medicine at the Psychoneurological Institute in Saint Petersburg and experimenting with &quot;sound collages&quot; in his free time. He eventually adopted the name &quot;Dziga Vertov&quot;, which translates loosely from Ukrainian as &#x27;spinning top&#x27;.

===Early writings===
Vertov is known for many early writings, mainly while still in school, that focus on the individual versus the perceptive nature of the camera lens, which he was known to call his &quot;second eye&quot;.

Most of Vertov&#x27;s early work was unpublished, and few manuscripts survived after the Second World War, though some material surfaced in later films and documentaries created by Vertov and his brothers, Boris Kaufman and Mikhail Kaufman.

Vertov is known for quotes on perception, and its ineffability, in relation to the nature of qualia (sensory experiences).

===After the October Revolution===
After the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, at the age of 22, Vertov began editing for &quot;Kino-Nedelya&quot; (, the Moscow Cinema Committee&#x27;s weekly film series, and the first newsreel series in Russia), which first came out in June 1918. While working for &quot;Kino-Nedelya&quot; he met his future wife, the film director and editor, Elizaveta Svilova, who at the time was working as an editor at Goskino. She began collaborating with Vertov, beginning as his editor but becoming assistant and co-director in subsequent films, such as &quot;Man with a Movie Camera&quot; (1929), and &quot;Three Songs About Lenin&quot; (1934).

Vertov worked on the &quot;Kino-Nedelya&quot; series for three years, helping establish and run a film-car on Mikhail Kalinin&#x27;s agit-train during the ongoing Russian Civil War between Communists and counterrevolutionaries. Some of the cars on the agit-trains were equipped with actors for live performances or printing presses; Vertov&#x27;s had equipment to shoot, develop, edit, and project film. The trains went to battlefronts on agitation-propaganda missions intended primarily to bolster the morale of the troops; they were also intended to stir up revolutionary fervor of the masses.

In 1919, Vertov compiled newsreel footage for his documentary &quot;Anniversary of the Revolution;&quot; he also supervised the filming of his project &quot;The Battle for Tsaritsyn&quot; (1919). in 1921 he compiled &quot;History of the Civil War.&quot; The so-called &quot;Council of Three,&quot; a group issuing manifestoes in LEF, a radical Russian newsmagazine, was established in 1922; the group&#x27;s &quot;three&quot; were Vertov, his (future) wife and editor Elizaveta Svilova, and his brother and cinematographer Mikhail Kaufman. Vertov&#x27;s interest in machinery led to a curiosity about the mechanical basis of cinema.

His statement &quot;We: Variant of a Manifesto&quot; was published in the first issue of Kino-Fot, published by Aleksei Gan in 1922. It commenced with a distinction between &quot;kinoks&quot; and other approaches to the emergent cinematic industry:
:&quot;We call ourselves kinoks – as opposed to &quot;cinematographers&quot;, a herd of junkmen doing rather well peddling their rags. 
:We see no connection between true kinochestvo and the cunning and calculation of the profiteers.
:We consider the psychological Russo-German film-drama – weighed down with apparitions and childhood memories – an absurdity.&quot;

====&quot;Kino-Pravda&quot;====
In 1922, the year that &quot;Nanook of the North&quot; was released, Vertov started the &quot;Kino-Pravda&quot; series. The series took its title from the official government newspaper &quot;Pravda&quot;. &quot;Kino-Pravda&quot; (literally translated, &quot;film truth&quot;) continued Vertov&#x27;s agit-prop bent. &quot;The Kino-Pravda group began its work in a basement in the centre of Moscow&quot;, Vertov explained. He called it damp and dark. There was an earthen floor and holes one stumbled into at every turn. Vertov said, &quot;This dampness prevented our reels of lovingly edited film from sticking together properly, rusted our scissors and our splicers.

Vertov&#x27;s driving vision, expounded in his frequent essays, was to capture &quot;film truth&quot;—that is, fragments of actuality which, when organized together, have a deeper truth that cannot be seen with the naked eye. In the &quot;Kino-Pravda&quot; series, Vertov focused on everyday experiences, eschewing bourgeois concerns and filming marketplaces, bars, and schools instead, sometimes with a hidden camera, without asking permission first. Usually, the episodes of &quot;Kino-Pravda&quot; did not include reenactments or stagings. (One exception is the segment about the trial of the Social Revolutionaries: the scenes of the selling of the newspapers on the streets and the people reading the papers in the trolley were both staged for the camera.) The cinematography is simple, functional, unelaborate—perhaps a result of Vertov&#x27;s disinterest in both &quot;beauty&quot; and the &quot;grandeur of fiction&quot;. Twenty-three issues of the series were produced over a period of three years; each issue lasted about twenty minutes and usually covered three topics. The stories were typically descriptive, not narrative, and included vignettes and exposés, showing for instance the renovation of a trolley system, the organization of farmers into communes, and the trial of Social Revolutionaries; one story shows starvation in the nascent Communist state. Propagandistic tendencies are also present, but with more subtlety, in the episode featuring the construction of an airport: one shot shows the Tsar&#x27;s tanks helping prepare a foundation, with an intertitle reading &quot;Tanks on the labor front&quot;.

Vertov clearly intended an active relationship with his audience in the series—in the final segment he includes contact information—but by the 14th episode the series had become so experimental that some critics dismissed Vertov&#x27;s efforts as &quot;insane&quot;. Vertov responded to their criticisms with the assertion that the critics were hacks nipping &quot;revolutionary effort&quot; in the bud, and concluded an essay with a promise to &quot;explode art&#x27;s tower of Babel&quot;. In Vertov&#x27;s view, &quot;art&#x27;s tower of Babel&quot; was the subservience of cinematic technique to narrative—what film theorist Noël Burch terms the institutional mode of representation—which would come to dominate the classical Hollywood cinema.

By this point in his career, Vertov was clearly and emphatically dissatisfied with narrative tradition, and expresses his hostility towards dramatic fiction of any kind both openly and repeatedly; he regarded drama as another &quot;opiate of the masses&quot;. Vertov freely admitted one criticism leveled at his efforts on the &quot;Kino-Pravda&quot; series—that the series, while influential, had a limited release.

By the end of the &quot;Kino-Pravda&quot; series, Vertov made liberal use of stop motion, freeze frames, and other cinematic &quot;artificialities&quot;, giving rise to criticisms not just of his trenchant dogmatism, but also of his cinematic technique. Vertov explains himself in &quot;On &#x27;Kinopravda&#x27; &quot;: in editing &quot;chance film clippings&quot; together for the Kino-Nedelia series, he &quot;began to doubt the necessity of a literary connection between individual visual elements spliced together... This work served as the point of departure for &#x27;Kinopravda&#x27; &quot;. Towards the end of the same essay, Vertov mentions an upcoming project which seems likely to be &quot;Man with a Movie Camera&quot; (1929), calling it an &quot;experimental film&quot; made without a scenario; just three paragraphs above, Vertov mentions a scene from &quot;Kino Pravda&quot; which should be quite familiar to viewers of &quot;Man with the Movie Camera&quot;: the peasant works, and so does the urban woman, and so too, the woman film editor selecting the negative... &quot;

====&quot;Man with a Movie Camera&quot;====
With Lenin&#x27;s admission of limited private enterprise through the New Economic Policy (NEP) of 1921, Russia began receiving fiction films from afar, an occurrence that Vertov regarded with undeniable suspicion, calling drama a &quot;corrupting influence&quot; on the proletarian sensibility (&quot;On &#x27;Kinopravda&#x27; &quot;, 1924). By this time Vertov had been using his newsreel series as a pedestal to vilify dramatic fiction for several years; he continued his criticisms even after the warm reception of Sergei Eisenstein&#x27;s &quot;Battleship Potemkin&quot; (1925). &quot;Potemkin&quot; was a heavily fictionalized film telling the story of a mutiny on a battleship which came about as a result of the sailors&#x27; mistreatment; the film was an obvious but skillful propaganda piece glorifying the proletariat. Vertov lost his job at Sovkino in January 1927, possibly as a result of criticizing a film which effectively preaches the line of the Communist Party. He was fired for making &quot;A Sixth Part of the World: Advertising and the Soviet Universe&quot; for the State Trade Organization into a propaganda film, selling the Soviet as an advanced society under the NEP, instead of showing how they fit into the world economy.

The Ukraine State Studio hired Vertov to create &quot;Man with a Movie Camera&quot;. Vertov says in his essay &quot;The Man with a Movie Camera&quot; that he was fighting &quot;for a decisive cleaning up of film-language, for its complete separation from the language of theater and literature&quot;. By the later segments of &quot;Kino-Pravda&quot;, Vertov was experimenting heavily, looking to abandon what he considered film clichés (and receiving criticism for it); his experimentation was even more pronounced and dramatic by the time of &quot;Man with a Movie Camera&quot;, which was filmed in Ukraine. Some have criticized the obvious stagings in this film as being at odds with Vertov&#x27;s creed of &quot;life as it is&quot; and &quot;life caught unawares&quot;: the scene of the woman getting out of bed and getting dressed is obviously staged, as is the reversed shot of the chess pieces being pushed off a chess board and the tracking shot that films Mikhail Kaufman riding in a car filming a third car.

However, Vertov&#x27;s two credos, often used interchangeably, are in fact distinct, as Yuri Tsivian comments in the commentary track on the DVD for &quot;Man with the Movie Camera:&quot; for Vertov, &quot;life as it is&quot; means to record life as it would be without the camera present. &quot;Life caught unawares&quot; means to record life when surprised, and perhaps provoked, by the presence of a camera. This explanation contradicts the common assumption that for Vertov &quot;life caught unawares&quot; meant &quot;life caught unaware of the camera&quot;. All of these shots might conform to Vertov&#x27;s credo &quot;caught unawares&quot;. His slow motion, fast motion, and other camera techniques were a way to dissect the image, Mikhail Kaufman stated in an interview. It was to be the honest truth of perception. For example, in &quot;Man with a Movie Camera&quot;, two trains are shown almost melting into each other. Although we are taught to see trains as not riding that close, Vertov tried to portray the actual sight of two passing trains. Mikhail spoke about Eisenstein&#x27;s films as being different from his and his brother&#x27;s in that Eisenstein &quot;came from the theatre, in the theatre one directs dramas, one strings beads&quot;. &quot;We all felt...that through documentary film we could develop a new kind of art. Not only documentary art, or the art of chronicle, but rather an art based on images, the creation of an image-oriented journalism&quot;, Mikhail explained. More than even film truth, &quot;Man with a Movie Camera&quot; was supposed to be a way to make those in the Soviet Union more efficient in their actions. He slowed down his movements, such as the decision whether to jump or not. You can see the decision in his face, a psychological dissection for the audience. He wanted a peace between the actions of man and the actions of a machine, for them to be, in a sense, one.

====&quot;Cine-Eye&quot;====

&quot;Cine-Eye&quot; is a montage method developed by Dziga Vertov and first formulated in his work &quot;WE: Variant of a Manifesto&quot; in 1919.

Dziga Vertov believed his concept of &quot;Kino-Glaz&quot;, or &quot;Cine Eye&quot; in English, would help contemporary &quot;man&quot; evolve from a flawed creature into a higher, more precise form. He compared man unfavorably to machines: &quot;In the face of the machine we are ashamed of man&#x27;s inability to control himself, but what are we to do if we find the unerring ways of electricity more exciting than the disorderly haste of active people [...]&quot; As he put it in a 1923 credo, &quot;I am the Cine-Eye. I am the mechanical eye. I the machine show you the world as only I can see it. I emancipate myself henceforth and forever from human immobility. &quot;I am in constant motion...&quot; My path leads towards the creation of a fresh perception of the world. I can thus decipher a world that you do not know.&quot;

Like other Russian filmmakers, he attempted to connect his ideas and techniques to the advancement of the aims of the Soviet Union. Whereas Sergei Eisenstein viewed his montage of attractions as a creative tool through which the film-viewing masses could be subjected to &quot;emotional and psychological influence&quot; and therefore able to perceive &quot;the ideological aspect&quot; of the films they were watching, Vertov believed the Cine-Eye would influence the actual evolution of man, &quot;from a bumbling citizen through the poetry of the machine to the perfect electric man&quot;.

Vertov surrounded himself with others who were also firm believers in his ideas. These were the Kinoks, other Russian filmmakers who would assist him in his hopes of making &quot;cine-eye&quot; a success.

Vertov believed film was too &quot;romantic&quot; and &quot;theatricalised&quot; due to the influence of literature, theater, and music, and that these psychological film-dramas &quot;prevent man from being as precise as a stopwatch and hamper his desire for kinship with the machine&quot;. He desired to move away from &quot;the pre-Revolutionary &#x27;fictional&#x27; models&quot; of filmmaking to one based on the rhythm of machines, seeking to &quot;bring creative joy to all mechanical labour&quot; and to &quot;bring men closer to machines&quot;.

In May 1927 Vertov moved to Ukraine, and the Cine-Eye movement broke up.

===Late career===

Vertov&#x27;s successful career continued into the 1930s. &quot;Enthusiasm: Symphony of the Donbass&quot; (1931), an examination into Soviet miners, has been called a &#x27;sound film&#x27;, with sound recorded on location, and these mechanical sounds woven together, producing a symphony-like effect. Many Soviet critics did not receive the film positively, but critics abroad lauded its sonic experimentation. 

Three years later, &quot;Three Songs About Lenin&quot; (1934) looked at the revolution through the eyes of the Russian peasantry. For his film, Vertov had been hired by Mezhrabpomfilm. The film, finished in January 1934 for Lenin&#x27;s obit, was only publicly released in the Soviet Union in November of that year. From July 1934 it was shown at private screenings to various high-ranking Soviet officials and also to prominent foreigners including H. G. Wells, William Bullitt, and others, and it was screened at the Venice Film Festival in August 1934. A new version of the film was released in 1938, including a longer sequence to reflect Stalin&#x27;s achievements at the end of the film and leaving out footage of &quot;enemies&quot; of that time. Today there exists a 1970 reconstruction by Yelizaveta Svilova. With the rise and official sanction of socialist realism in 1934, Vertov was forced to cut his personal artistic output significantly, eventually becoming little more than an editor for Soviet newsreels. &quot;Lullaby&quot;, perhaps the last film in which Vertov was able to maintain his artistic vision, was released in 1937.

Dziga Vertov died of cancer in Moscow in 1954.

==Family==
Vertov&#x27;s brother Boris Kaufman was a cinematographer who worked with Jean Vigo on &quot;L&#x27;Atalante&quot; (1934) and much later for directors such as Elia Kazan in the United States who won an Oscar for his work on &quot;On the Waterfront&quot;. His other brother, Mikhail Kaufman, worked with Vertov on his films until he became a documentarian in his own right. Mikhail Kaufman&#x27;s directorial debut was the film &quot;In Spring&quot; (1929).

In 1923, Vertov married his long-time collaborator Elizaveta Svilova.

After the October Revolution, Vertov&#x27;s parents returned to Białystok, which became part of Poland. They were later murdered by the Nazis during the Holocaust.

==Influence and legacy==
Vertov&#x27;s legacy still lives on today. His ideas are echoed in cinéma vérité, the movement of the 1960s named after Vertov&#x27;s &quot;Kino-Pravda&quot;. The 1960s and 1970s saw an international revival of interest in Vertov.

The independent, exploratory style of Vertov influenced and inspired many filmmakers and directors like the Situationist Guy Debord and independent companies such as Vertov Industries in Hawaii. The Dziga Vertov Group borrowed his name. In 1960, Jean Rouch used Vertov&#x27;s filming theory when making &quot;Chronicle of a Summer&quot;. His partner Edgar Morin coined the term &quot;cinéma vérité&quot; when describing the style, using direct translation of Vertov&#x27;s &quot;KinoPravda&quot;.

The Free Cinema movement in the United Kingdom during the 1950s, the Direct Cinema in North America in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and the &quot;Candid Eye&quot; series in Canada in the 1950s all essentially owed a debt to Vertov.

This revival of Vertov&#x27;s legacy included rehabilitation of his reputation in the Soviet Union, with retrospectives of his films, biographical works, and writings. In 1962, the first Soviet monograph on Vertov was published, followed by another collection, &quot;Dziga Vertov: Articles, Diaries, Projects&quot;. In 1984, to recall the 30th anniversary of Vertov&#x27;s death, three New York cultural organizations put on the first American retrospective of Vertov&#x27;s work.

New Media theorist Lev Manovich suggested Vertov as one of the early pioneers of database cinema genre in his essay &quot;Database as a symbolic form&quot;.

Vertov&#x27;s work has inspired notable artist and filmmaker William Kentridge.

=== Lost films ===
Some early Vertov&#x27;s films were lost for many years. Only 12 minutes of his 1918 &quot;Anniversary of the Revolution&quot; were known; in 2018 Russian film historian Nikolai Izvolov found the lost film in the Russian State Documentary Film &amp; Photo Archive and restored it. In 2022 he reconstructed another lost film, 1921 &quot;The History of the Civil War&quot; using archive materials.

<doc id="8933" wikidata="Q5253299" url="?curid=8933" title="Delaware General Corporation Law">
<text>The Delaware General Corporation Law (sometimes abbreviated DGCL), officially the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (Title 8, Chapter 1 of the Delaware Code), is the statute of the Delaware Code that governs corporate law in the U.S. state of Delaware. The statute was adopted in 1899. Since the 1913 anti-corporation reforms in New Jersey under the governorship of Woodrow Wilson, Delaware has become the most prevalent jurisdiction in United States corporate law and has been described as the &quot;de facto&quot; corporate capital of the United States. 

Delaware is considered a corporate haven because of its business-friendly corporate laws compared to most other U.S. states. 66% of the &quot;Fortune&quot; 500, including Walmart and Amazon (two of the world&#x27;s largest companies by revenue) are incorporated (and therefore have their domiciles for service of process purposes) in the state. Over half of all publicly traded corporations listed in the New York Stock Exchange (including its owner, Intercontinental Exchange) are incorporated in Delaware.

The statute has been credited with reducing the tax burdens on Delaware residents as revenues from the statute provide two-fifths of the state&#x27;s budget, but has been controversial for facilitating tax dodging and money laundering by major corporations, as well as providing safe haven to money launderers, kleptocratic foreign rulers, and human traffickers.

==History==

Delaware acquired its status as a corporate haven in the early 20th century. Following the example of New Jersey, which enacted corporate-friendly laws at the end of the 19th century to attract businesses from New York, Delaware adopted on March 10, 1899, a general incorporation act aimed at attracting more businesses. The group that pushed for this legislation intended to establish a corporation that would sell services to other businesses incorporating in Delaware. Before the rise of general incorporation acts, forming a corporation required a special act of the state legislature. General incorporation allowed anyone to form a corporation by simply raising money and filing articles of incorporation with the state&#x27;s Secretary of State.

==Other legal aspects==
Because of the extensive experience of the Delaware courts, Delaware has a more well-developed body of case law than other states, which serves to give corporations and their counsel greater guidance on matters of corporate governance and transaction liability issues. Disputes over the internal affairs of Delaware corporations are usually filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery, which is a separate court of equity, as opposed to a court of law. Because it is a court of equity, there are no juries; its cases are heard by judges, called chancellors. Since 2018, the court has consisted of one chancellor and six vice-chancellors. The court is a trial court, with one chancellor hearing each case. Litigants may appeal final decisions of the Court of Chancery to the Delaware Supreme Court.

Delaware has also attracted major credit card banks because of its relaxed rules regarding interest. Many U.S. states have usury laws limiting the amount of interest a lender can charge. Federal law allows a national bank to &quot;import&quot; these laws from the state in which its principal office is located. Delaware (among others) has relatively relaxed interest laws, so several national banks have decided to locate their principal office in Delaware. National banks are, however, corporations formed under federal law, not Delaware law. A corporation formed under Delaware state law benefits from the relaxed interest rules to the extent it conducts business in Delaware, but is subject to restrictions of other states&#x27; laws if it conducts business in other states.

Pursuant to the &quot;internal affairs doctrine&quot;, corporations which act in more than one state are subject only to the laws of their state of incorporation with regard to the regulation of the internal affairs of the corporation. As a result, Delaware corporations are subject almost exclusively to Delaware law, even when they do business in other states.

While most states require a for-profit corporation to have at least one director and two officers, Delaware laws do not have this restriction. All offices may be held by a single person who also can be the sole shareholder. The person, who does not need to be a U.S. citizen or resident, may also operate anonymously with only the listing agent through whom the company is registered named.

==Tax benefits and burdens==
Delaware charges no income tax on corporations not operating within the state, so taking advantage of Delaware&#x27;s other benefits does not result in taxation. At the same time, Delaware has a particularly aggressive tax on banks that locate in the state. However, in general, the state is viewed as a positive location for corporate tax purposes because favorable laws of incorporation allow companies to minimize corporate expenditures (achieved through legal standardization of corporate legal processes), creating a nucleus in Delaware with operating companies often in other states.

In addition, Delaware has used its position as the state of incorporation to generate revenue from its abandoned and unclaimed property laws. Under U.S. Supreme Court precedent, the state of incorporation gets to keep any abandoned and unclaimed property, such as uncashed checks and unredeemed gift certificates, if the corporation does not have information about the location of the owner of the property. Abandoned property provides Delaware with about half a billion dollars annually.

Delaware charges a franchise tax on the corporations incorporated in it. Franchise taxes in Delaware are higher than in most other states which typically get revenue from corporate income taxes on the portion of the corporation&#x27;s business done in that state. Delaware&#x27;s franchise taxes supply about one-fifth of its state revenue.

In February 2013, &quot;The Economist&quot; published an article on tax-friendly jurisdictions, commenting that Delaware stood for &quot;Dollars and Euros Laundered And Washed At Reasonable Expense&quot;. Jeffrey W. Bullock, Delaware&#x27;s Secretary of State, insists that the state has struck the right balance between curbing criminality and &quot;paying deference to the millions of legitimate businesspeople who benefit&quot; from hassle-free incorporation.

On June 30, 2013, Delaware Governor Jack Markell signed amendments to the Delaware General Corporation Law. The new legislation took effect on August 1, 2013, except for the ratification of the defective corporate acts amendment which took effect in 2014.

== Securities law ==
In 2020, the Delaware Supreme Court upheld a provision allowing companies to require in their certificates of incorporation all Securities Act of 1933 claims to be filed in federal court.

DGCL 203 is particularly known as an antitakeover law.
