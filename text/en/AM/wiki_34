<text>Tottenham Hotspur Football Club, commonly referred to as simply Tottenham(, , , ) or Spurs, is a professional football club based in Tottenham, north London, England. It competes in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. The team have played their home matches in the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium since 2019, replacing their former home of White Hart Lane, which had been demolished to make way for the new stadium on the same site.

Founded in 1882, Tottenham Hotspur&#x27;s emblem is a cockerel standing upon a football, with the Latin motto &quot;Audere est Facere&quot; (&quot;to dare is to do&quot;). The team have traditionally worn white shirts and navy blue shorts as their home kit since the 1898–99 season. Their training ground is on Hotspur Way in Bulls Cross, Enfield. After its inception, Tottenham won the FA Cup for the first time in 1901, the only non-League club to do so since the formation of the Football League in 1888. Tottenham was the first club in the 20th century to achieve the League and FA Cup Double, winning both competitions in the 1960–61 season. After successfully defending the FA Cup in 1962, in 1963 they became the first British club to win a UEFA club competition – the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. They were also the inaugural winners of the UEFA Cup in 1972, becoming the first British club to win two different major European trophies. They collected at least one major trophy in each of the six decades from the 1950s to 2000s, an achievement only matched by Manchester United.

In domestic football, Spurs have won two league titles, eight FA Cups, four League Cups, and seven FA Community Shields. In European football, they have won one European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup and two UEFA Cups. Tottenham were also runners-up in the 2018–19 UEFA Champions League. They have a long-standing rivalry with nearby club Arsenal, with whom they contest the North London derby, as well as a contested rivalry with Chelsea. Tottenham is owned by ENIC Group, which purchased the club in 2001. The club was estimated to be worth £2.6 billion ($3.2 billion) in 2024, and it was the ninth-highest-earning football club in the world, with an annual revenue of £615 million in 2024.

==History==

===Formation and early years (1882–1908)===

Originally named Hotspur Football Club, the club was formed on 5 September 1882 by a group of schoolboys led by Bobby Buckle. They were members of the Hotspur Cricket Club and the football club was formed to play sports during the winter months. A year later the boys sought help with the club from John Ripsher, the Bible class teacher at All Hallows Church, who became the first president of the club and its treasurer. Ripsher helped and supported the boys through the club&#x27;s formative years, reorganised and found premises for the club. In April 1884 the club was renamed &quot;Tottenham Hotspur Football Club&quot; to avoid confusion with another London club named Hotspur, whose post had been mistakenly delivered to North London. Nicknames for the club include &quot;Spurs&quot; and &quot;the Lilywhites&quot;.

Initially, the north London side played games between themselves and friendly matches against other local clubs. The first recorded match took place on 30 September 1882 against a local team named the Radicals, which Hotspur lost 2–0. The team entered their first cup competition in the London Association Cup, and won 5–2 in their first competitive match on 17 October 1885 against a company&#x27;s works team called St Albans. The club&#x27;s fixtures began to attract the interest of the local community and attendances at its home matches increased. In 1892, they played for the first time in a league, the short-lived Southern Alliance.

The club turned professional on 20 December 1895 and, in the summer of 1896, was admitted to Division One of the Southern League (the third tier at the time). On 2 March 1898, the club also became a limited company, the Tottenham Hotspur Football and Athletic Company. Soon after, Frank Brettell became the first ever manager of Spurs, and he signed John Cameron, who took over as player-manager when Brettell left a year later. Cameron would have a significant impact on Spurs, helping the club win its first trophy, the Southern League title in the 1899–1900 season. The following year Spurs won the 1901 FA Cup by beating Sheffield United 3–1 in a replay of the final, after the first game ended in a 2–2 draw. In doing so they became the only non-League club to achieve the feat since the formation of The Football League in 1888.

===Early decades in the Football League (1908–1958)===
In 1908, the club was elected into the Football League Second Division and won promotion to the First Division in their first season, finishing runners-up. In 1912, Peter McWilliam became manager; Tottenham finished bottom of the league at the end of the 1914–15 season when football was suspended due to the First World War. Spurs were relegated to the Second Division on the resumption of league football after the war, but quickly returned to the First Division as Second Division champions of the 1919–20 season.

On 23 April 1921, McWilliam guided Spurs to their second FA Cup win, beating Wolverhampton Wanderers 1–0 in the Cup Final. Spurs finished second to Liverpool in the league in 1922, but would finish mid-table in the next five seasons. Spurs were relegated in the 1927–28 season after McWilliam left. For most of the 1930s and 1940s, Spurs languished in the Second Division, apart from a brief return to the top flight in the 1933–34 and 1934–35 seasons.

Former Spurs player Arthur Rowe became manager in 1949. Rowe developed a style of play, known as &quot;push and run&quot;, that proved to be successful in his early years as manager. He took the team back to the First Division after finishing top of the Second Division in the 1949–50 season. In his second season in charge, Tottenham won their first ever top-tier league championship title when they finished top of the First Division for the 1950–51 season. Rowe resigned in April 1955 due to a stress-induced illness from managing the club. Before he left, he signed one of Spurs&#x27; most celebrated players, Danny Blanchflower, who won the FWA Footballer of the Year twice while at Tottenham.

===Bill Nicholson and the glory years (1958–1974)===

Bill Nicholson took over as manager in October 1958. He became the club&#x27;s most successful manager, guiding the team to major trophy success three seasons in a row in the early 1960s: the Double in 1961, the FA Cup in 1962 and the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1963. Nicholson signed Dave Mackay and John White in 1959, two influential players of the Double-winning team, and Jimmy Greaves in 1961, the most prolific goal-scorer in the history of the top tier of English football.

The 1960–61 season started with a run of 11 wins, followed by a draw and another four wins, at that time the best ever start by any club in the top flight of English football. The title was won on 17 April 1961 when they beat the eventual runner-up Sheffield Wednesday at home 2–1, with three more games still to play. The Double was achieved when Spurs won 2–0 against Leicester City in the final of the 1960–61 FA Cup. It was the first Double of the 20th century, and the first since Aston Villa achieved the feat in 1897. The next year Spurs won their consecutive FA Cup after beating Burnley in the 1962 FA Cup Final.

On 15 May 1963, Tottenham became the first British team to win a European trophy by winning the 1962–63 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup when they beat Atlético Madrid 5–1 in the final. Spurs also became the first British team to win two different European trophies when they won the 1971–72 UEFA Cup with a rebuilt team that included Martin Chivers, Pat Jennings, and Steve Perryman. They had also won the FA Cup in 1967, two League Cups (in 1971 and 1973), as well as a second place league finish (1962–63) and runners-up to the 1973–74 UEFA Cup. In total, Nicholson won eight major trophies in his 16 years at the club as manager.

===Burkinshaw to Venables (1974–1992)===

Spurs went into a period of decline after the successes of the early 1970s, and Nicholson resigned after a poor start to the 1974–75 season. The team was then relegated at the end of the 1976–77 season with Keith Burkinshaw as manager. Burkinshaw quickly returned the club to the top flight, building a team that included Glenn Hoddle as well as two Argentinians, Osvaldo Ardiles and Ricardo Villa, which was unusual as players from outside the British Isles were rare at that time. The team that Burkinshaw rebuilt went on to win the FA Cup in 1981 and 1982 and the UEFA Cup in 1984.

The 1980s was a period of change that began with a new phase of redevelopment at White Hart Lane, as well as a change of directors. Irving Scholar took over the club and moved it in a more commercial direction, the beginning of the transformation of English football clubs into commercial enterprises. Debt at the club would again lead to a change in the boardroom, and Terry Venables teamed up with businessman Alan Sugar in June 1991 to take control of Tottenham Hotspur plc. Venables, who had become manager in 1987, signed players such as Paul Gascoigne and Gary Lineker. Under Venables, Spurs won the 1990–91 FA Cup, making them the first club to win eight FA Cups.

===Premier League football (1992–present)===

Tottenham was one of the five clubs that pushed for the founding of the Premier League, created with the approval of The Football Association, replacing the Football League First Division as the highest division of English football. Despite a succession of managers and players such as Teddy Sheringham, Jürgen Klinsmann and David Ginola, for a long period in the Premier League until the late 2000s, Spurs finished mid-table most seasons with few trophies won. They won the League Cup in 1999 under George Graham, and again in 2008 under Juande Ramos. Performance improved under Harry Redknapp with players such as Gareth Bale and Luka Modrić, and the club finished in the top five in the early 2010s.

In February 2001, Sugar sold his shareholding in Spurs to ENIC Sports plc, run by Joe Lewis and Daniel Levy, and stepped down as chairman. Lewis and Levy would eventually own 85% of the club, with Levy responsible for the running of the club. They appointed Mauricio Pochettino as head coach, who was in the role between 2014 and 2019. Under Pochettino, Spurs finished second in the 2016–17 season, their highest league finish since the 1962–63 season, and advanced to the UEFA Champions League final in 2019, the club&#x27;s first, where they ultimately lost to Liverpool 2–0. Pochettino was subsequently sacked after a poor start to the 2019–20 season, in November 2019, and was replaced by José Mourinho.

Mourinho was sacked in April 2021, while Nuno Espírito Santo lasted just four months as his successor. The next manager, Antonio Conte, guided Spurs to fourth during the 2021–22 season and back to a Champions League place. Following a poor run of form, Conte criticised the players and management of the club in press conferences; after exiting both the Champions League and FA Cup, he departed the club by mutual agreement in March 2023. Ange Postecoglou took over as head coach on 1 July 2023 and the club qualified for the 2024–25 UEFA Europa League after a fifth-place finish in the Premier League.

==Stadiums==
===Early grounds===
Spurs played their early matches on public land at the Park Lane end of Tottenham Marshes, where they had to mark out and prepare their own pitch. Occasionally fights broke out on the marshes in disputes with other teams over the use of the ground. The first Spurs game reported by the local press took place on Tottenham Marshes on 6 October 1883 against Brownlow Rovers, which Spurs won 9–0. It was at this ground that, in 1887, Spurs first played the team that would later become their arch rivals, Arsenal (then known as Royal Arsenal), leading 2–1 until the match was called off due to poor light after the away team arrived late.

As they played on public parkland, the club could not charge admission fees and, while the number of spectators grew to a few thousand, it yielded no gate receipts. In 1888, the club rented a pitch between numbers 69 and 75 Northumberland Park at a cost of £17 per annum, where spectators were charged 3d a game, raised to 6d for cup ties. The first game at the Park was played on 13 October 1888, a reserve match that yielded gate receipts of 17 shillings. The first stand with just over 100 seats and changing rooms underneath was built at the ground for the 1894–95 season at a cost of £60. However, the stand was blown down a few weeks later and had to be repaired. In April 1898, 14,000 fans turned up to watch Spurs play Woolwich Arsenal. Spectators climbed on the roof of the refreshment stand for a better view of the match. The stand collapsed, causing a few injuries. As Northumberland Park could no longer cope with the larger crowds, Spurs looked for a larger ground and moved to the White Hart Lane site in 1899.

===White Hart Lane===
The White Hart Lane ground was built on an unused plant nursery owned by the Charrington Brewery and located behind a public house named the White Hart on Tottenham High Road (the road White Hart Lane actually lies a few hundred yards north of the main entrance). The ground was initially leased from Charringtons, and the stands they used at Northumberland Park were moved here, giving shelter for 2,500 spectators. Notts County were the first visitors to &#x27;the Lane&#x27; in a friendly watched by 5,000 people and yielding £115 in receipts; Spurs won 4–1. Queens Park Rangers became the first competitive visitors to the ground and 11,000 people saw them lose 1–0 to Tottenham. In 1905, Tottenham raised enough money to buy the freehold to the land, as well as land at the northern (Paxton Road) end.
After Spurs were admitted to the Football League, the club started to build a new stadium, with stands designed by Archibald Leitch being constructed over the next two and a half decades. The West Stand was added in 1909, the East Stand was also covered this year and extended further two years later. The profits from the 1921 FA Cup win were used to build a covered terrace at the Paxton Road end and the Park Lane end was built at a cost of over £3,000 some two years later. This increased the stadium&#x27;s capacity to around 58,000, with room for 40,000 under cover. The East Stand (Worcester Avenue) was finished in 1934 and this increased capacity to around 80,000 spectators and cost £60,000.
Starting in the early 1980s, the stadium underwent another major phase of redevelopment. The West Stand was replaced by an expensive new structure in 1982, and the East Stand was renovated in 1988. In 1992, following the Taylor Report&#x27;s recommendation that Premier League clubs eliminate standing areas, the lower terraces of the south and east stand were converted to seating, with the North Stand becoming all-seater the following season. The South Stand redevelopment was completed in March 1995 and included the first giant Sony Jumbotron TV screen for live game coverage and away match screenings. In the 1997–98 season the Paxton Road stand received a new upper tier and a second Jumbotron screen. Minor amendments to the seating configuration were made in 2006, bringing the capacity of the stadium to 36,310.

By the turn of the millennium, the capacity of White Hart Lane had become lower than other major Premier League clubs. Talks began over the future of the ground with a number of schemes considered, such as increasing the stadium capacity through redevelopment of the current site, or using of the 2012 London Olympic Stadium in Stratford. Eventually the club settled on the Northumberland Development Project, whereby a new stadium would be built on a larger piece of land that incorporated the existing site. In 2016, the northeast corner of the stadium was removed to facilitate the construction of the new stadium. As this reduced the stadium capacity below that required for European games, Tottenham Hotspur played every European home game in 2016–17 at Wembley Stadium. Domestic fixtures of the 2016–17 season continued to be played at the Lane, but demolition of the rest of the stadium started the day after the last game of the season, and White Hart Lane was completely demolished by the end of July 2017.

===Tottenham Hotspur Stadium===

In October 2008, the club announced a plan to build a new stadium immediately to the north of the existing White Hart Lane stadium, with the southern half of the new stadium&#x27;s pitch overlapping the northern part of the Lane. This proposal would become the Northumberland Development Project. The club submitted a planning application in October 2009 but, following critical reactions to the plan, it was withdrawn in favour of a substantially revised planning application for the stadium and other associated developments. The new plan was resubmitted and approved by Haringey Council in September 2010, and an agreement for the Northumberland Development Project was signed on 20 September 2011.

After a long delay over the compulsory purchase order of local businesses located on land to the north of the stadium and a legal challenge against the order, resolved in early 2015, planning application for another new design was approved by Haringey Council on 17 December 2015. Construction started in 2016, and the new stadium was scheduled to open during the 2018–19 season. While it was under construction, all Tottenham home games in the 2017–18 season as well as all but five in 2018–19 were played at Wembley Stadium. After two successful test events, Tottenham Hotspur officially moved into the new ground on 3 April 2019 with a Premier League match against Crystal Palace which Spurs won 2–0. The new stadium is called Tottenham Hotspur Stadium while a naming-rights agreement is reached.

==Training grounds==
An early training ground used by Tottenham was located at Brookfield Lane in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire. The club bought the 11-acre ground used by Cheshunt F.C. in 1952 for £35,000. It had three pitches, including a small stadium with a small stand used for matches by the junior team. The ground was later sold for over £4 million, and the club moved the training ground to the Spurs Lodge on Luxborough Lane, Chigwell in Essex, opened in September 1996 by Tony Blair. The training ground and press centre in Chigwell were used until 2014.

In 2007, Tottenham bought a site at Bulls Cross in Enfield, a few miles south of their former ground in Cheshunt. A new training ground was constructed at the site for £45 million, which opened in 2012. The 77-acre site has 15 grass pitches and one-and-a-half artificial pitches, as well as a covered artificial pitch in the main building. The main building on Hotspur Way also has hydrotherapy and swimming pools, gyms, medical facilities, dining and rest areas for players as well as classrooms for academy and schoolboy players. A 45-bedroom players lodge with catering, treatment, rest and rehabilitation facilities was later added at Myddleton Farm next to the training site in 2018. The lodge is mainly used by Tottenham&#x27;s first team and Academy players, but it has also been used by national football teams – the first visitors to use the facilities at the site were the Brazilian team in preparation for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

==Crest==
Since the 1921 FA Cup Final, the Tottenham Hotspur crest has featured a cockerel. Harry Hotspur, after whom the club is named, was said to have been given the nickname Hotspur as he dug in his spurs to make his horse go faster as he charged in battles, and spurs are also associated with fighting cocks. The club used spurs as a symbol in 1900, which then evolved into a fighting cock. A former player named William James Scott made a bronze cast of a cockerel standing on a football at a cost of £35 (), and this figure was then placed on top of the West Stand at the end of the 1909–10 season. Since then the cockerel and ball emblem has become a part of the club&#x27;s identity. The club badge on the shirt used in 1921 featured a cockerel within a shield, but it was changed to a cockerel sitting on a ball in the late 1960s.

Between 1956 and 2006 Spurs used a faux heraldic shield featuring a number of local landmarks and associations. The castle is Bruce Castle, 400 yards from the ground and the trees are the Seven Sisters. The arms featured the Latin motto &quot;Audere Est Facere&quot; (to dare is to do).

In 1983, to overcome unauthorised &quot;pirate&quot; merchandising, the club&#x27;s badge was altered by adding the two red heraldic lions to flank the shield (which came from the arms of the Northumberland family, of which Harry Hotspur was a member), as well as the motto scroll. This device appeared on Spurs&#x27; playing kits for three seasons 1996–99.

In 2006, in order to rebrand and modernise the club&#x27;s image, the club badge and coat of arms were replaced by a professionally designed logo/emblem. This revamp displayed a sleeker and more elegant cockerel standing on an old-time football. The club claimed that they dropped their club name and would be using the rebranded logo only on playing kits. In November 2013, Tottenham forced non-league club Fleet Spurs to change their badge because its new design was &quot;too similar&quot; to the Tottenham crest.

In 2017, Spurs added a shield around the cockerel logo on the shirts similar to the 1950s badge, but with the cockerel of modern design. The shield was however removed the following season.

==Kit==

The first Tottenham kit recorded in 1883 included a navy blue shirt with a letter H on a scarlet shield on the left breast, and white breeches. In 1884 or 1885, the club changed to a &quot;quartered&quot; kit similar to Blackburn Rovers after watching them win in the 1884 FA Cup Final. After they moved to Northumberland Park in 1888, they returned to the navy blue shirts for the 1889–90 season. Their kit changed again to red shirt and blue shorts in 1890, and for a time the team were known as &#x27;the Tottenham Reds&#x27;. Five years later in 1895, the year they became a professional club, they switched to a chocolate and gold striped kit.

In the 1898–99 season, their final year at Northumberland Park, the club switched colours to white shirts and blue shorts, same colour choice as that for Preston North End. White and navy blue have remained as the club&#x27;s basic colours ever since, with the white shirts giving the team the nickname &quot;The Lilywhites&quot;. In 1921, the year they won the FA Cup, the cockerel badge was added to the shirt for the final. A club crest has featured on the shirt since, and Spurs became the first major club to have its club crest on the players shirt on every match apart from the war years. In 1939 numbers first appeared on shirt backs.

In the early days, the team played in kits sold by local outfitters. An early supplier of Spurs&#x27; jerseys recorded was a firm on Seven Sisters Road, HR Brookes. In the 1920s, Bukta produced the jerseys for the club. From the mid-1930s onwards, Umbro was the supplier for forty years. In 1959, the V-neck shirt replaced the collared shirts of the past, and then in 1963, the crew neck shirt appeared (the style has fluctuated since). In 1961, Bill Nicholson sent Spurs players out to play in white instead of navy shorts for their European campaign, starting a tradition which continues to this day in European competitions.

In 1977, a deal was signed with Admiral to supply the team their kits. Although Umbro kits in generic colours had been sold to football fans since 1959, it was with the Admiral deal that the market for replica shirts started to take off. Admiral changed the plain colours of earlier strips to shirts with more elaborate designs, which included manufacturer&#x27;s logos, stripes down the arms and trims on the edges. Admiral was replaced by Le Coq Sportif in the summer of 1980. In 1985, Spurs entered into a business partnership with Hummel, who then supplied the strips. However, the attempt by Tottenham to expand the business side of the club failed, and in 1991, they returned to Umbro. In 1991, the club was the first to wear long-cut shorts, an innovation at a time when football kits all featured shorts cut well above the knee. Umbro was followed by Pony in 1995, Adidas in 1999, Kappa in 2002, and a five-year deal with Puma in 2006. In March 2011, Under Armour announced a five-year deal to supply Spurs with shirts and other apparel from the start of 2012–13, with the home, away and the third kits revealed in July and August 2012. The shirts incorporate technology that can monitor the players&#x27; heart rate and temperature and send the biometric data to the coaching staff. In June 2017, it was announced that Nike would be their new kits supplier, with the 2017–18 kit released on 30 June, featuring the Spurs&#x27; crest encased in a shield, paying homage to Spurs&#x27; 1960–61 season, where they became the first post-war-club to win both the Football League First Division and the FA Cup. In October 2018, Nike agreed a 15-year deal reportedly worth £30 million a year with the club to supply their kits until 2033.

Shirt sponsorship in English football was first adopted by the non-league club Kettering Town F.C. in 1976 despite it being banned by the FA. FA soon lifted the ban, and this practice spread to the major clubs when sponsored shirts were allowed on non-televised games in 1979, and then on televised games as well in 1983. In December 1983, after the club was floated on the London Stock Exchange, Holsten became the first commercial sponsor logo to appear on a Spurs shirt. When Thomson was chosen as kit sponsor in 2002 some Tottenham fans were unhappy as the shirt-front logo was red, the colour of their closest rivals, Arsenal. In 2006, Tottenham secured a £34 million sponsorship deal with internet casino group Mansion.com. In July 2010, Spurs announced a two-year shirt sponsorship contract with software infrastructure company Autonomy said to be worth £20 million. A month later they unveiled a £5 million deal with leading specialist bank and asset management firm Investec as shirt sponsor for the Champions League and domestic cup competitions for the next two years. Since 2014, AIA has been the main shirt sponsor, initially in a deal worth over £16 million annually, increased to a reported £40 to £45 million per year in 2019 in an eight-year deal that lasts until 2027. In 2023, Tottenham provisionally agreed a three-year shirt sponsorship deal with South Africa Tourism (SAT) starting in 2023/24 and ending in the 2026/27 season.

==Ownership==
Tottenham Hotspur F.C. became a limited company, the Tottenham Hotspur Football and Athletic Company Ltd, on 2 March 1898 so as to raise funds for the club and limit the personal liability of its members. 8,000 shares were issued at £1 each, although only 1,558 shares were taken up in the first year. 4,892 shares were sold in total by 1905. A few families held significant shares; they included the Wale family, who had association with the club since the 1930s, as well as the Richardson and the Bearman families. From 1943 to 1984, members of these families were chairmen of Tottenham Hotspur F.C. after Charles Robert who had been chairman since 1898 died.

In the early 1980s, cost overruns in the construction of a new West Stand together with the cost of rebuilding the team in previous years led to accumulating debts. In November 1982, a fan of the club Irving Scholar bought 25% of Tottenham for £600,000, and together with Paul Bobroff gained control of the club. In order to bring in funds, Scholar floated Tottenham Hotspur plc, which wholly owns the football club, on the London Stock Exchange in 1983, the first European sports club to be listed in a stock market, and became the first sports company to go public. Fans and institutions alike can now freely buy and trade shares in the company; a court ruling in 1935 involving the club (&quot;Berry and Stewart v Tottenham Hotspur FC Ltd&quot;) had previously established a precedent in company law that the directors of a company can refuse the transfer of shares from a shareholder to another person. The share issue was successful with 3.8 million shares quickly sold. However, ill-judged business decisions under Scholar led to financial difficulties, and in June 1991 Terry Venables teamed up with businessman Alan Sugar to buy the club, initially as equal partner with each investing £3.25 million. Sugar increased his stake to £8 million by December 1991 and became the dominant partner with effective control of the club. In May 1993, Venables was sacked from the board after a dispute. By 2000, Sugar began to consider selling the club, and in February 2001, he sold the major part of his shareholding to ENIC International Ltd.

The majority shareholder, ENIC International Ltd, is an investment company established by the British billionaire Joe Lewis. Daniel Levy, Lewis&#x27;s partner at ENIC, is Executive Chairman of the club. They first acquired 29.9% share of the club in 1991, of which 27% was bought from Sugar for £22 million. Shareholding by ENIC increased over the decade through the purchase of the remaining 12% holding of Alan Sugar in 2007 for £25m, and the 9.9% stake belonging to Stelios Haji-Ioannou through Hodram Inc. in 2009. On 21 August 2009 the club reported that they had issued a further 30 million shares to fund the initial development costs of the new stadium project, and that 27.8 million of these new shares had been purchased by ENIC. The Annual Report for 2010 indicated that ENIC had acquired 76% of all Ordinary Shares and also held 97% of all convertible redeemable preference shares, equivalent to a holding of 85% of share capital. The remaining shares are held by over 30,000 individuals. Between 2001 and 2011 shares in Tottenham Hotspur F.C. were listed on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM index). Following an announcement at the 2011 AGM, in January 2012 Tottenham Hotspur confirmed that the club had delisted its shares from the stock market, taking it into private ownership.

Lewis&#x27; shares are owned by the Lewis Family Trusts. In October 2022, Lewis ceased to be a person with significant control of the club, following a reorganisation of the Trusts. The club continues to be owned by Levy and the Lewis trusts and, in the summer of 2022, ENIC intended to inject up to £150 million into the club by the issuing of new shares. Only £100 million of shares were subscribed for and this took ENIC&#x27;s shareholding up to 86.58%.

Tottenham has a large fan base in the United Kingdom, drawn largely from North London and the Home counties. The attendance figures for its home matches, however, have fluctuated over the years. Five times between 1950 and 1962, Tottenham had the highest average attendance in England. Tottenham was 9th in average attendances for the 2008–09 Premier League season, and 11th for all Premier League seasons. In the 2017–18 season when Tottenham used Wembley as its home ground, it had the second-highest attendance in the Premier League. It also holds the record for attendance in the Premier League, with 83,222 attending the North London derby on 10 February 2018. Historical supporters of the club have included such figures as philosopher A. J. Ayer. There are many official supporters&#x27; clubs located around the world, while an independent supporters club, the Tottenham Hotspur Supporters&#x27; Trust, is recognised by the club as the representative body for Spurs supporters.

Historically, the club had a significant Jewish following from the Jewish communities in east and north London, with around a third of its supporters estimated to be Jewish in the 1930s. Due to this early support, all three chairmen of the club since 1984 have been Jewish businessmen with prior history of supporting the club. The club no longer has a greater Jewish contingent among its fans than other major London clubs (Jewish supporters are estimated to form at most 5% of its fanbase), though it is nevertheless still identified as a Jewish club by rival fans. Antisemitic chants directed at the club and its supporters by rival fans have been heard since the 1960s, with words such as &quot;Yids&quot; or &quot;Yiddos&quot; used against Tottenham supporters. In response to the abusive chants, Tottenham supporters, Jewish and non-Jewish alike, began to chant back the insults and adopt the &quot;Yids&quot; or &quot;Yid Army&quot; identity starting from around the late 1970s or early 1980s. Some fans view adopting &quot;Yid&quot; as a badge of pride, helping defuse its power as an insult. The use of &quot;Yid&quot; as a self-identification, however, has been controversial; some argued that the word is offensive and its use by Spurs fans &quot;legitimis[es] references to Jews in football&quot;, and that such racist abuse should be stamped out in football. Both the World Jewish Congress and the Board of Deputies of British Jews have denounced the use of the word by fans. Others, such as former Prime Minister David Cameron, argued that its use by the Spurs fans is not motivated by hate as it is not used pejoratively, and therefore cannot be considered hate speech. Attempts to prosecute Tottenham fans who chanted the words have failed, as the Crown Prosecution Service considered that the words as used by Tottenham fans could not be judged legally &quot;threatening, abusive or insulting&quot;.

===Fan culture===
There are a number of songs associated with the club and frequently sung by Spurs fans, such as &quot;Glory Glory Tottenham Hotspur&quot;. The song originated in 1961 after Spurs completed the Double in 1960–61, and the club entered the European Cup for the first time. Their first opponents were Górnik Zabrze, the Polish champions, and after a hard-fought match Spurs suffered a 4–2 reverse. Tottenham&#x27;s tough tackling prompted the Polish press to write that &quot;they were no angels&quot;. These comments incensed a group of three fans and for the return match at White Hart Lane they dressed as angels wearing white sheets fashioned into togas, sandals, false beards and carrying placards bearing biblical-type slogans. The angels were allowed on the perimeter of the pitch and their fervour whipped up the home fans who responded with a rendition of &quot;Glory Glory Hallelujah&quot;, which is still sung on terraces at White Hart Lane and other football grounds. The Lilywhites also responded to the atmosphere to win the tie 8–1. Then manager of Spurs, Bill Nicholson, wrote in his autobiography: 

There had been a number of incidents of hooliganism involving Spurs fans, particularly in the 1970s and 1980s. Significant events include the rioting by Spurs fans in Rotterdam at the 1974 UEFA Cup Final against Feyenoord, and again during the 1983–84 UEFA Cup matches against Feyenoord in Rotterdam and Anderlecht in Brussels. Although fan violence has since abated, the occasional incidence of hooliganism continues to be reported.

===Rivalries===
Tottenham supporters have rivalries with several clubs, mainly within the London area. The fiercest of these is with north London rivals Arsenal. The rivalry began in 1913 when Arsenal moved from the Manor Ground, Plumstead to Arsenal Stadium, Highbury, and this rivalry intensified in 1919 when Arsenal were unexpectedly promoted to the First Division, taking a place that Tottenham believed should have been theirs.

Tottenham also share notable rivalries with fellow London clubs Chelsea and West Ham United. The rivalry with Chelsea is secondary in importance to the one with Arsenal and began when Tottenham beat Chelsea in the 1967 FA Cup Final, the first ever all-London final. West Ham fans view Tottenham as a bitter rival, although the animosity is not reciprocated to the same extent by Tottenham fans.

==Social responsibility==
The club through its Community Programme has, since 2006, been working with Haringey Council and the Metropolitan Housing Trust and the local community on developing sports facilities and social programmes which have also been financially supported by Barclays Spaces for Sport and the Football Foundation. The Tottenham Hotspur Foundation received high-level political support from the prime minister when it was launched at 10 Downing Street in February 2007.

In March 2007 the club announced a partnership with the charity SOS Children&#x27;s Villages UK, whereby player fines would go towards this charity&#x27;s children&#x27;s village in Rustenburg, South Africa to support of a variety of community development projects in and around Rustenburg. In the financial year 2006–07, Tottenham topped a league of Premier League charitable donations when viewed both in overall terms and as a percentage of turnover by giving £4,545,889, including a one-off contribution of £4.5 million over four years, to set up the Tottenham Hotspur Foundation.

In contrast, they have successfully sought the reduction of section 106 planning obligations connected to the redevelopment of the stadium in the Northumberland Development Project. Initially the development would incorporate 50% affordable housing, but this requirement was later waived, and a payment of £16m for community infrastructure was reduced to £0.5m. This is controversial in an area which has suffered high levels of deprivation as Spurs had bought up properties for redevelopment, removing existing jobs and businesses for property development but not creating enough new jobs for the area. The club however argued that the project, when completed, would support 3,500 jobs and inject an estimated £293 million into the local economy annually, and that it would serve as the catalyst for a wider 20-year regeneration programme for the Tottenham area. In other developments in Tottenham, the club has built 256 affordable homes and a 400-pupil primary school.

===London Academy of Excellence===
As part of the development of Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, the club built an elite educational facility to sit alongside its club offices. The London Academy of Excellence Tottenham (LAET) is a state-funded Sixth Form, sponsored by the Club and Highgate School – the principle academic sponsors who deliver expert teaching. LAET was named the Sunday Times Sixth Form College of the Year, 2020 by Parent Power, The Sunday Times School Guide. In 2022, LAET achieved an &quot;Outstanding&quot; Ofsted rating across all areas.

===Environmental sustainability===
Spurs are one of the high-profile participants in the 10:10 project, which they joined in 2009. In a year, the carbon emissions were reduced by 14%, an estimated 400 tonnes of carbon. The club further said it is dedicated to minimising the environmental impact of its activities across all operations, setting targets to reduce its carbon emissions by 50% by 2030 and become net-zero by 2040.

In September 2021, the club partnered with Sky Sports to host the world&#x27;s first net-zero carbon top-level football game. The initiative won in the Sustainability category at the 2022 Football Business Awards. In 2023, the club was ranked top in Premier League&#x27;s &quot;Sustainability Rankings&quot; for fourth year running.

Tottenham&#x27;s record league win is 9–0 against Bristol Rovers in the Second Division on 22 October 1977. The club&#x27;s record cup victory came on 3 February 1960 with a 13–2 win over Crewe Alexandra in the FA Cup. Spurs&#x27; biggest top-flight victory came against Wigan Athletic on 22 November 2009, when they won 9–1 with Jermain Defoe scoring five goals. The club&#x27;s record defeat is an 8–0 loss to 1. FC Köln in the Intertoto Cup on 22 July 1995.

The record home attendance at White Hart Lane was 75,038 on 5 March 1938 in a cup tie against Sunderland. The highest recorded home attendances were at their temporary home, Wembley Stadium, due to its higher capacity – 85,512 spectators were present on 2 November 2016 for the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League game against Bayer Leverkusen, while 83,222 attended the North London derby against Arsenal on 10 February 2018 which is the highest attendance recorded for any Premier League game.

In the UEFA rankings, the club slipped from No. 21 in 2023 to No. 35 as of season 2024–25 with a club coefficient of 56.25 points thanks to its non-participation in any UEFA club competition in season 2023–24.

==Tottenham Hotspur Women==

Tottenham&#x27;s women&#x27;s team was founded in 1985 as Broxbourne Ladies. They started using the Tottenham Hotspur name for the 1991–92 season and played in the London and South East Women&#x27;s Regional Football League (then fourth tier of the game). They won promotion after topping the league in 2007–08. In the 2016–17 season they won the FA Women&#x27;s Premier League Southern Division and a subsequent playoff, gaining promotion to the FA Women&#x27;s Super League 2.

On 1 May 2019, Tottenham Hotspur Ladies won promotion to the FA Women&#x27;s Super League with a 1–1 draw at Aston Villa, which confirmed they would finish second in the Championship. Tottenham Hotspur Ladies changed their name to Tottenham Hotspur Women in the 2019–20 season.

Tottenham Hotspur Women announced the signing of Cho So-hyun on 29 January 2021. With her Korean men&#x27;s counterpart Son Heung-min already at the club it gave Spurs the rare distinction of having both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s Korean National Team captains at one club.

==Formula racing==
Tottenham Hotspur competed in Superleague Formula for three seasons from 2008 to 2010. Duncan Tappy was the main driver in the first season racing 10 times with 3 podium finishes. In 2010 Tottenham won the trophy with driver Craig Dolby.

Through its partnership with F1, the club has also introduced kart racing. The attraction, named F1 Drive, is located underneath the south stands. Three track layouts are available, suiting everyone from beginners to elite karters.

<text>Álava () or Araba (), officially Araba/Álava, is a province of Spain and a historical territory of the Basque Country, heir of the ancient Lordship of Álava, former medieval Catholic bishopric and now Latin titular see.

Its capital city, Vitoria-Gasteiz, is also the seat of the political main institutions of the Basque Autonomous Community. It borders the Basque provinces of Biscay and Gipuzkoa to the north, the community of La Rioja to the south, the province of Burgos (in the community of Castile and León) to the west and the community of Navarre to the east. The Enclave of Treviño, surrounded by Alavese territory, is however part of the province of Burgos, thus belonging to the autonomous community of Castile and León, not Álava.

It is the largest of the three provinces in the Basque Autonomous Community in geographical terms, with 3,037 km2, but also the least populated with 331,700 inhabitants (2019).

== Etymology ==
Built around the Roman mansion Alba located on the road ab Asturica Burdigalam (possibly the current village of Albéniz near Agurain), it has sometimes been argued the name may stem from that landmark. However, according to the Royal Academy of the Basque Language, the origin may be another: The name is first found on Muslim chronicles of the eighth century referring to the Alavese Plains (Spanish &quot;Llanada Alavesa&quot;, Basque &quot;Arabako Lautada&quot;), &quot;laua&quot; in old Basque (currently &quot;lautada&quot;) with the Arab article added (al + laua), developing into Spanish Álava and Basque Araba (a typical development of l to r between vowels).

== Physical and human geography ==

Álava is an inland territory and features a largely transitional climate between the humid, Atlantic neighbouring northern provinces and the dry and warmer lands south of the Ebro River. According to the relief and landscape characteristics, the territory is divided into five main zones: 
*The Gorbea Foothills: Green hilly landscape.
*The Valleys: Low valleys, drier, sparsely populated.
*The Plains: Heartland of Álava comprising Vitoria and Salvatierra-Agurain, with a central urban area and crop landscape prevailing around and bounded south and north by the Basque Mountains.
*The Alavese Mountains: High altitude and forested.
*The Alavese Rioja: Oriented to the south on the left bank of the Ebro River, perfect for vineyards and part of the Rioja denominación de origen.
*Ayala: The area clustering around the Nervión River, with Amurrio and Laudio as its major towns. The region shows close bonds with Bilbao and Biscaye and an industrial landscape.
Unlike Biscay and Gipuzkoa, but for Ayala and Aramaio, the waters of Álava pour into the Ebro and hence to the Mediterranean by means of two main waterways, i.e. the Zadorra (main axis of Álava) and Bayas Rivers. In addition, the Zadorra Reservoir System harvests a big quantity of waters that supply not only the capital city but other major Basque towns and cities too, like Bilbao.

While in 1950 agriculture and farming shaped the landscape of the territory (42.4% of the working force vs 30.5% in industry and construction), the trend shifted gradually during the 60s and 70s on the grounds of a growing industrial activity in the Alavese Plains (&quot;Llanada Alavesa&quot;), with the main focus lying on the industrial estates of Vitoria-Gasteiz (Gamarra, Betoño and Ali Gobeo) and, to a lesser extent, Salvatierra-Agurain and Araia. At the turn of the century, only 2% of the working Alavese people was in agriculture, while 60% was in the tertiary sector and 32% in manufacturing. Industry associated with iron and metal developed earlier in the Atlantic area much in tune with Bilbao&#x27;s economic dynamics, with droves of people flocking to and clustering in Amurrio and Laudio, which have since become the third and second main towns of Álava.

== Demography and rural landscape ==
The province numbers 51 municipalities, a population of 315,525 inhabitants in an area of , with an average of 104.50 inhabitants/km2. The vast majority of the population clusters in the capital city of Álava, Vitoria-Gasteiz, which also serves as the capital of the Autonomous Community, but the remainder of the territory is sparsely inhabited with population nuclei distributed into seven counties (&quot;kuadrillak&quot; or &quot;cuadrillas&quot;): Añana; Ayala/Aiara; Campezo/Kanpezu; Laguardia; Agurain/Salvatierra; Vitoria-Gasteiz; Zuia.

A 2021 sociolinguistic survey found that 22.4% of the adult population spoke Basque, an increase of six percentage points since 2011.

===Ecclesiastical history===

=== Bishopric ===
The Arab invasion of the Ebro valley in the eighth century, many Christians of the Diocese of Calahorra sought refuge in areas further north free of Arab rule. The diocese called Álava or Armentaria was established in 870 on territory split off from the Diocese of Calahorra. From then until the 11th century the names of several bishops of this see are recorded, the best known being the last, Fortún, who in 1072 went to Rome to argue before Pope Alexander II in defence of the Mozarabic Rite, which King Alfonso VI of León and Castile had decreed should be replaced by the Roman Rite.

The see was suppressed in 1088, when it was merged into the Diocese of Najéra, another suffragan of the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Tarragona. 
The territory of the diocese of Álava, which corresponded more or less to that of the present Diocese of Vitoria, was reabsorbed into that of Calahorra when Najéra was suppressed in 1170, when King Alfonso VIII of Castile conquered La Rioja.

;&quot;Suffragan Bishops of Álava&quot; 
(For a list, see Antonio Rivera, ed., &quot;Historia de Álava&quot; (2003), pp. 599–600.)

* Bivere or Aivere (before 871 – after 876)
* Álvaro (c. 881 – c. 888)
* Munio I (937/956 – 971)
* ? Julián (?–984)
* Munio II (984–989)
* García I (996 – c. 1021)
* Munio III (c. 1024 – c. 1030)
* García II (1037 – 1053/1055)
* Fortún [Fortuño] I (1054/1055)
* Vela (1056–1062)
* Munio IV (1062 – c. 1065)
* Fortún II (c. 1067 – 1088)

=== Titular see ===
No longer a residential bishopric, Álava is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see since the diocese was nominally restored in 1969 as Titular bishopric of Álava.

It has had the following incumbents, so far of the fitting episcopal (lowest) rank:
* Stanisław Smolenski (1970/01/14 – death 2006/08/08) as Auxiliary Bishop of Kraków (Poland) (1970.01.14 – 1992.02.01) and on emeritate
* Mario Iceta Gavicagogeascoa (2008.02.05 – 2010.08.24) as Auxiliary Bishop of Bilbao (Basque Spain) (2008.02.05 – 2010.08.24); later succeeded Bishop of Bilbao (2010.08.24 – ...)
* Nelson Francelino Ferreira (2010.11.24 – 2014.02.12) as Auxiliary Bishop of São Sebastião do Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) (2010.11.24 – 2014.02.12); later Bishop of Valença (Brazil) (2014.02.12 – ...)
* Carlos Lema Garcia (2014.04.30 – ...), as Auxiliary Bishop of São Paulo (Brazil)

===Spanish Civil War===
At the start of the Spanish Civil War Álava and Vitoria were easily captured by the rebel Nationalists led by General Angel García Benítez, assisted by Colonel Camilo Alonso Vega. Vitoria was captured on 19 July 1936. In November 1936 an attempt by Republicans to retake Vitoria was thwarted after being spotted by Nationalist reconnaissance aircraft. The 1937 Nationalist campaign in Vizcaya was supported by 80 German aircraft based at Vitoria, where the Condor Legion fighter wing was concentrated.

<text>The Life and Death of King Richard the Second, often shortened to Richard II, is a history play by William Shakespeare believed to have been written around 1595. Based on the life of King Richard II of England (ruled 1377–1399), it chronicles his downfall and the machinations of his nobles. It is the first part of a tetralogy, referred to by some scholars as the Henriad, followed by three plays about Richard&#x27;s successors: &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot;; &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot;; and &quot;Henry V&quot;.

Although the First Folio (1623) includes the play among the histories, the earlier Quarto edition of 1597 calls it &quot;The Tragedie of King Richard the second&quot;.

==Synopsis==
The play spans only the last two years of Richard&#x27;s life, from 1398 to 1400. It begins with King Richard sitting majestically on his throne in full state, having been requested to arbitrate a dispute between the nobles Thomas Mowbray and Richard&#x27;s cousin, Henry Bolingbroke, who has accused Mowbray of high treason for stealing money that had been raised for the English army and of murdering Bolingbroke&#x27;s uncle, the Duke of Gloucester. Bolingbroke&#x27;s father, John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, meanwhile, believes Richard himself was responsible for his brother&#x27;s murder. After several attempts to calm both men, Richard acquiesces and it is determined that the matter be resolved in the established method of trial by battle between Bolingbroke and Mowbray, despite Gaunt&#x27;s objections.The tournament scene is very formal, with a long, ceremonial introduction, but as the combatants are about to fight, Richard interrupts and sentences both men to banishment from England. Bolingbroke is originally sentenced to ten years&#x27; banishment, but Richard reduces this to six years upon seeing John of Gaunt&#x27;s grieving face. Mowbray is banished permanently. The king&#x27;s decision can be seen as the first mistake in a series leading eventually to his overthrow and death, since the error highlights many of his character flaws, including indecisiveness (in terms of whether to allow the duel to go ahead), abruptness (Richard waits until the last possible moment to cancel the duel), and arbitrariness (there is no apparent reason Bolingbroke should be allowed to return and Mowbray not). In addition, the decision fails to dispel the suspicions surrounding Richard&#x27;s involvement in the death of the Duke of Gloucester—in fact, by handling the situation so high-handedly and offering no coherent explanation for his reasoning, Richard only manages to appear more guilty. Mowbray correctly predicts that the king will sooner or later fall at the hands of Bolingbroke.

After an impassioned invective against the visiting king from his sick-bed, John of Gaunt dies and Richard seizes all his land and money. This angers the nobility, who accuse Richard of wasting England&#x27;s money, of illegally depriving John&#x27;s heir Bolingbroke of his rightful inheritance to fund war in Ireland, of imposing unjust taxes on the commoners, and of enriching himself by fining the nobles for crimes their ancestors committed. The conspirators help Bolingbroke return secretly to England, with a plan to overthrow Richard. There remain, however, subjects loyal to the king. Among them are the courtiers Bushy, Bagot, and Green, as well as the Duke of Aumerle (son of the Duke of York), cousin of both Richard and Bolingbroke. When Richard leaves England to attend to the war in Ireland, Bolingbroke seizes the opportunity to assemble an army and invades the north coast of England. Executing both Bushy and Green, Bolingbroke wins over the Duke of York, whom Richard has left in charge of his government in his absence.

Upon Richard&#x27;s return, Bolingbroke reclaims his lands and lays claim to the English throne; Richard&#x27;s Welsh allies desert him and he is taken captive. After a dramatic, public ceremony where Bolingbroke has the captive king publicly renounce his crown, he crowns himself King Henry IV, and has Richard imprisoned in the castle of Pomfret. Aumerle orchestrates an uprising against the new king, only to be thwarted by his father, York. The King executes every conspirator except Aumerle, who is spared after the Duchess of York intervenes on his behalf. After misinterpreting King Henry&#x27;s &quot;living fear&quot; as a reference to the still-living Richard, the ambitious Sir Piers Exton murders him in his cell to gain favour. King Henry is appalled by the murder, dismisses Exton from his court, and vows a pilgrimage to Jerusalem to cleanse himself of his part in Richard&#x27;s death. In his final lines, Henry completes the tragic structure of the play by mourning over Richard&#x27;s coffin and affording the deposed king forgiveness.

==Sources==

Shakespeare&#x27;s primary source for &quot;Richard II&quot;, as for most of his chronicle histories, was Raphael Holinshed&#x27;s &quot;Chronicles of England, Scotlande, and Irelande&quot;; the publication of the second edition in 1587 provides a &quot;terminus post quem&quot; for the play. Edward Hall&#x27;s &quot;The Union of the Two Illustrious Families of Lancaster and York&quot; appears also to have been consulted, and scholars have also supposed Shakespeare familiar with Samuel Daniel&#x27;s poem on the civil wars.

A somewhat more complicated case is presented by the anonymous play sometimes known as &quot;The First Part of Richard II&quot;. This play, which exists in one incomplete manuscript copy (at the British Museum), is subtitled &quot;Thomas of Woodstock&quot;, and scholars since F. S. Boas have usually called it by that name. This play treats the events leading up to the start of Shakespeare&#x27;s play (though the two texts do not have identical characters). This closeness, along with the manuscript&#x27;s anonymity, have led certain scholars to attribute all or part of the play to Shakespeare, though many critics view it as a secondary influence on Shakespeare, not as his work.

==Date and text==

The earliest recorded performance of &quot;Richard II&quot; was a private one, in Canon Row, the house of Edward Hoby, on 9 December 1595. The play was entered into the Register of the Stationers Company on 29 August 1597 by the bookseller Andrew Wise; he published the first quarto later that year, printed by Valentine Simmes. The second and third quartos followed in 1598—the only time a Shakespeare play was printed in three editions in two years. Q4 followed in 1608 and Q5 in 1615. The play was next published in the First Folio in 1623.

&quot;Richard II&quot; exists in a number of variations. The quartos vary to some degree, and the folio presents further differences. The first three quartos (printed in 1597 and 1598, commonly assumed to have been prepared from Shakespeare&#x27;s holograph) lack the deposition scene. The fourth, published in 1608, includes a version of the scene shorter than the one later printed, presumably from a prompt-book, in the First Folio. The scant evidence makes explaining these differences largely conjectural. Traditionally, it has been supposed that the quartos lack the deposition scene because of censorship, by either the playhouse or the Master of the Revels Edmund Tylney, and that the Folio version may better reflect Shakespeare&#x27;s original intentions. But there is no external evidence for this hypothesis, and the title page of the 1608 quarto refers to a &quot;lately acted&quot; deposition scene (although, again, this could be due to earlier censorship that was later relaxed).

== Analysis and criticism ==
===Structure and language===
The play is divided into five acts and its structure is as formal as its language. It has a double complementary plot describing Richard II&#x27;s fall and the rise of Bolingbroke, later known as Henry IV. Critic John R. Elliott Jr. notes that this play can be distinguished from the other history plays because it has an ulterior political purpose. Shakespearean tragedy&#x27;s normal structure is modified to portray a central political theme: the rise of Bolingbroke to the throne and the conflict between Richard and Bolingbroke over the kingship. In Acts IV and V, Shakespeare includes incidents irrelevant to Richard&#x27;s fate that are resolved in the future plays of the &quot;Richard II&quot;–&quot;Henry V&quot; tetralogy.

The literary critic Hugh M. Richmond notes that Richard&#x27;s beliefs about the divine right of kings tend to fall more in line with the medieval view of the throne. Bolingbroke, on the other hand, represents a more modern view of statecraft, arguing that not only bloodline but also intellect and political skill qualify a king. Richard believes that as king he is chosen and guided by God: not subject to human frailty, he is entitled to absolute authority over his subjects. Elliott argues that this conceited notion of his role ultimately leads to Richard&#x27;s failure, adding that Bolingbroke&#x27;s ability to relate and speak with the middle and lower classes allows him to take the throne.

Although it is largely historically accurate, &quot;Richard II&quot; is a tragedy. &quot;Richard II&quot; follows the arc of most of Shakespeare&#x27;s tragedies: a series of catastrophes lead to a death, which resolves in forgiveness. A long line of mistakes, mostly on the part of Richard himself, lead to his incarceration and murder. But when his body is presented to Henry IV, the now-king declares, &quot;although I did wish him dead, I hate the murderer, love the murderèd.&quot; This line affords Richard absolution and cements this play&#x27;s place among Shakespeare&#x27;s tragedies.

Unusually for Shakespeare, &quot;Richard II&quot; is written entirely in verse, one of only four of his plays, the others being &quot;King John&quot; and the first and third parts of &quot;Henry VI&quot;. There are also great differences in the characters&#x27; use of language. Traditionally, Shakespeare distinguishes social classes by having the upper classes speak in poetry while the lower classes speak in prose. In &quot;Richard II&quot;, there is no prose, but Richard uses flowery, metaphorical language in his speeches, whereas Bolingbroke, also of the noble class, uses a more plain and direct language. Besides the usual blank verse (unrhymed pentameters), there are long stretches of heroic couplets (pairs of rhymed pentameters). The play contains a number of memorable metaphors, including the extended comparison of England with a garden in Act III, Scene iv and of its reigning king to a lion or to the sun in Act IV.

The language of &quot;Richard II&quot; is more eloquent than that of the earlier history plays, and serves to set the tone and themes of the play. Shakespeare uses lengthy verses, metaphors, similes and soliloquies to delineate Richard&#x27;s character as analytical rather than active. He always speaks in tropes, using analogies such as the sun as a symbol of his kingly status. Richard is obsessed with symbols: his crown, the symbol of his royal power, is of more concern to him than his actual kingly duties.

===Historical context===
The play was performed and published late in the reign of Elizabeth I of England, at a time when the queen&#x27;s advanced age made succession an important political concern. The historical parallels in the succession of &quot;Richard II&quot; may not have been intended as political comment on the contemporary situation, with the weak Richard II analogous to Queen Elizabeth and an implicit argument in favour of her replacement by a monarch capable of creating a stable dynasty, but lawyers investigating John Hayward&#x27;s historical work &quot;The First Part of the Life and Raigne of King Henrie IV&quot;, a book previously believed to have taken from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard II&quot;, made this connection. Samuel Schoenbaum contests that Hayward had written his work before &quot;Richard II&quot;, joking that &quot;there is nothing like a hypothetical manuscript to resolve an awkwardness of chronology&quot;, as Hayward noted he had written the work several years before its publication. Hayward dedicated his version to Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, and when Essex was arrested for rebellion in February 1601 Hayward had already been imprisoned, to strengthen the case against the earl for &quot;incitement to the deposing of the Queen&quot;. That Hayward had made his dedication was fortunate for Shakespeare; otherwise he too might have lost his liberty over the affair.

Shakespeare&#x27;s play appears to have played a minor role in the events surrounding the final downfall of Essex. On 7 February 1601, just before the uprising, supporters of the Earl of Essex, among them Charles and Joscelyn Percy (younger brothers of the Earl of Northumberland), paid for a performance at the Globe Theatre on the eve of their armed rebellion. By this agreement, reported at the trial of Essex by the Chamberlain&#x27;s Men actor Augustine Phillips, the conspirators paid the company forty shillings &quot;above the ordinary&quot; (i.e., above their usual rate) to stage this play, which the players felt was too old and &quot;out of use&quot; to attract a large audience. Eleven of Essex&#x27;s supporters attended the Saturday performance.

Elizabeth was aware of the political ramifications of the story of Richard II: according to a well-known but dubious anecdote, in August 1601 she was reviewing historical documents relating to the reign of Richard II when she supposedly remarked to her archivist William Lambarde, &quot;I am Richard II, know ye not that?&quot; In the same historical report the Queen is said to have complained that the play was performed forty times in &quot;open streets and houses&quot; but there is no extant evidence to corroborate this tale. At any rate, the Chamberlain&#x27;s Men do not appear to have suffered for their association with the Essex group; but they were commanded to perform it for the Queen on Shrove Tuesday in 1601, the day before Essex&#x27;s execution.

===Themes and motifs===

====&quot;The King&#x27;s Two Bodies&quot;====
In his analysis of medieval political theology, &quot;The King’s Two Bodies&quot;, Ernst Kantorowicz describes medieval kings as containing two bodies: a body natural, and a body politic. The theme of the king&#x27;s two bodies is pertinent throughout &quot;Richard II&quot;, from the exile of Bolingbroke to the deposition of King Richard II. The body natural is a mortal body, subject to all the weaknesses of mortal human beings. On the other hand, the body politic is a spiritual body which cannot be affected by mortal infirmities such as disease and old age. These two bodies form one indivisible unit, with the body politic superior to the body natural.

Many critics agree that in &quot;Richard II&quot;, this central theme of the king&#x27;s two bodies unfolds in three main scenes: the scenes at the Coast of Wales, at Flint Castle, and at Westminster. At the coast of Wales, Richard has just returned from a trip to Ireland and kisses the soil of England, demonstrating his kingly attachment to his kingdom. This image of kingship gradually fades as Bolingbroke&#x27;s rebellion continues. Richard starts to forget his kingly nature as his mind becomes occupied by the rebellion. This change is portrayed in the scene at Flint Castle during which the unity of the two bodies disintegrates and the king starts to use more poetic and symbolic language. Richard&#x27;s body politic has been shaken as his followers have joined Bolingbroke&#x27;s army, diminishing Richard&#x27;s military capacity. He has been forced to give up his jewels, losing his kingly appearance. He loses his temper at Bolingbroke, but then regains his composure as he starts to remember his divine side. At Flint Castle, Richard is determined to hang onto his kingship even though the title no longer fits his appearance. However, at Westminster the image of the divine kingship is supported by the Bishop of Carlisle rather than Richard, who at this point is becoming mentally unstable as his authority slips away. Biblical references are used to liken the humbled king to the humbled Christ. The names of Judas and Pilate are used to further extend this comparison. Before Richard is sent to his death, he &quot;un-kings&quot; himself by giving away his crown, sceptre, and the balm that is used to anoint a king to the throne. The mirror scene is the final end to the dual personality. After examining his plain physical appearance, Richard shatters the mirror on the ground and thus relinquishes his past and present as king. Stripped of his former glory, Richard finally releases his body politic and retires to his body natural and his own inner thoughts and griefs. Critic J. Dover Wilson notes that Richard&#x27;s double nature as man and martyr is the dilemma that runs through the play eventually leading to Richard&#x27;s death. Richard acts the part of a royal martyr, and due to the spilling of his blood, England continually undergoes civil war for the next two generations.

====The rise of a Machiavellian king====
The play ends with the rise of Bolingbroke to the throne, marking the start of a new era in England. According to historical research, an English translation of Machiavelli&#x27;s &quot;The Prince&quot; might have existed as early as 1585, influencing the reigns of the kings of England. Critic Irving Ribner notes that a manifestation of Machiavellian philosophy may be seen in Bolingbroke. Machiavelli wrote &quot;The Prince&quot; during a time of political chaos in Italy, and writes down a formula by which a leader can lead the country out of turmoil and return it to prosperity. Bolingbroke seems to be a leader coming into power at a time England is in turmoil, and follows closely the formula stated by Machiavelli. At the start of &quot;Richard II&quot;, Bolingbroke accuses Mowbray and ulteriorly attacks the government of King Richard. He keeps Northumberland by his side as a tool to control certain constituents. From the minute Bolingbroke comes into power, he destroys the faithful supporters of Richard such as Bushy, Green and the Earl of Wiltshire. Also, Bolingbroke is highly concerned with the maintenance of legality to the kingdom, an important principle of Machiavellian philosophy, and therefore makes Richard surrender his crown and physical accessories to erase any doubt as to the real heir to the throne. Yet, Irving Ribner still notes a few incidents where Bolingbroke does not follow true Machiavellian philosophy, such as his failure to destroy Aumerle, but such incidents are minuscule compared with the bigger events of the play. Even Bolingbroke&#x27;s last statement follows Machiavellian philosophy as he alludes to making a voyage to the Holy Land, since Machiavellian philosophy states rulers must appear pious. Therefore, this particular play can be viewed as a turning point in the history of England as the throne is taken over by a more commanding king in comparison to King Richard II.

==Performance history==
On 9 December 1595, Sir Robert Cecil enjoyed &quot;K. Richard&quot; at Sir Edward Hoby&#x27;s house in Canon Row, and it might have been Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard II&quot;, although some suspected that it was a different play, a painting, or a historical document.

Another commissioned performance of a different type occurred at the Globe Theatre on 7 Feb. 1601. This was the performance paid for by supporters of the Earl of Essex&#x27;s planned revolt (see Historical Context above).

It is said that on 30 September 1607, the crew of Capt. William Keeling acted &quot;Richard II&quot; aboard the British East India Company ship &quot;The Red Dragon&quot;, off Sierra Leone, but the authenticity of this record is doubted.

The play was performed at the Globe on 12 June 1631.

The play retained its political charge in the Restoration: a 1680 adaptation at Drury Lane by Nahum Tate was suppressed for its perceived political implications. Tate attempted to mask his version, called &quot;The Sicilian Usurper&quot;, with a foreign setting; he attempted to blunt his criticism of the Stuart court by highlighting Richard&#x27;s noble qualities and downplaying his weaknesses. Neither expedient prevented the play from being &quot;silenc&#x27;d on the third day,&quot; as Tate wrote in his preface. Lewis Theobald staged a successful and less troubled adaptation in 1719 at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields; Shakespeare&#x27;s original version was revived at Covent Garden in 1738.

The play had limited popularity in the early twentieth century, but John Gielgud exploded onto the world&#x27;s theatrical consciousness, through his performance as Richard at the Old Vic Theatre in 1929, returning to the character in 1937 and 1953 in what ultimately was considered as the definitive performance of the role. Another legendary Richard was Maurice Evans, who first played the role at the Old Vic in 1934 and then created a sensation in his 1937 Broadway performance, revived it in New York in 1940 and then immortalised it on television for the Hallmark Hall of Fame in 1954. In England, Paul Scofield, who played it at the Old Vic in 1952, was considered the definitive Richard of more modern times. In the 1968–1970 seasons of the Prospect Theatre Company, Ian McKellen made a breakthrough performance as Richard, opposite Timothy West as Bolingbroke. The production, directed by Richard Cottrell, toured Britain and Europe, featuring in the Edinburgh Festival in 1969 and on BBC TV in 1970. In 1974, Ian Richardson and Richard Pasco alternated the roles of Richard and Bolingbroke in a production from John Barton at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre: nearly fifty years later this was still a standard by which performances were being judged. One of the most accessible versions was the 1978 television production by the BBC of the play, shown as part of &quot;The Shakespeare Plays&quot; (a several years-long project to put all of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays on tape). This version, still available on DVD, starred Derek Jacobi as Richard, with John Gielgud making an appearance as John of Gaunt. In 1997, Fiona Shaw played the role as a man. More recently, the play was staged by Trevor Nunn in modern costume at the Old Vic in 2005, with Kevin Spacey in the title role, and by Michael Grandage at the Donmar Warehouse in 2011–12 with Eddie Redmayne in the title role.

Additionally the role was played by Mark Rylance at the Globe Theatre in 2003. An often overlooked production, the lead actor handles the character in, as &quot;The Guardian&quot; noted, perhaps the most vulnerable way ever seen. The play returned to the Globe in 2015 with Charles Edwards in the title role.

In summer 2012, BBC Two broadcast a filmed adaptation together with other plays in the Henriad under the series title &quot;The Hollow Crown&quot; with Ben Whishaw as Richard II.

No film version for cinema release has ever been made; however, the 1949 film &quot;Train of Events&quot; includes a sub-plot featuring an amateur dramatics society performing the last scenes of &quot;Richard II&quot;.

The Royal Shakespeare Company produced the play with David Tennant in the lead role in 2013. It has been released as a Cineplex Odeon special worldwide movie event. Tennant reprised the role for his U.S. stage debut, at BAM, in April 2016.

The Almeida Theatre, Islington, London, produced the play with Simon Russell Beale in the lead role in 2019.

<text>Asturias (; ; ) officially the Principality of Asturias, is an autonomous community in northwest Spain.

It is coextensive with the province of Asturias and contains some of the territory that was part of the larger Kingdom of Asturias in the Middle Ages. Divided into eight &quot;comarcas&quot; (counties), the autonomous community of Asturias is bordered by Cantabria to the east, by León (Castile and León) to the south, by Lugo (Galicia) to the west, and by the Cantabrian Sea to the north.

Asturias is situated in a mountainous setting with vast greenery and lush vegetation, making it part of Green Spain. The region has a maritime climate. It receives plenty of annual rainfall and little sunshine by Spanish standards and has very moderate seasons, most often averaging in the lower 20s Celsius. Heat waves are rare due to mountains blocking southerly winds. Winters are very mild for the latitude, especially near sea level.

The most important cities are the communal capital, Oviedo, the seaport and largest city Gijón, and the industrial town of Avilés. Other municipalities in Asturias include Cangas de Onís, Cangas del Narcea, Gozón, Grado, Langreo, Llanera, Laviana, Lena, Llanes, Mieres, Siero, Valdés, Vegadeo and Villaviciosa (&quot;see also List of municipalities and comarcas in Asturias&quot;).

==History==


Asturias was inhabited first by &quot;Homo erectus&quot;, then by Neanderthals. Since the Lower Paleolithic era, and during the Upper Paleolithic, Asturias was characterized by cave paintings in the eastern part of the area. In the Mesolithic period, a native culture developed, that of the &quot;Asturiense&quot;, and later, with the introduction of the Bronze Age, megaliths and tumuli were constructed. In the Iron Age, the territory came under the cultural influence of the Celts; the local Celtic peoples, known as the Astures, were composed of tribes such as the &quot;Luggones&quot;, the &quot;Pesicos&quot;, and others, who populated the entire area with &quot;castros&quot; (fortified hill-towns). Today the Astur Celtic influence persists in place names, such as those of rivers and mountains.

With the conquest of Asturias by the Romans under Augustus (29–19 BC), the region entered into recorded history. The Astures were subdued by the Romans, but were never fully conquered. After several centuries without foreign presence, they enjoyed a brief revival during the Germanic invasions of the late 4th century AD, resisting Suebi and Visigoth raids throughout the 5th century AD, ending with the Moorish invasion of Spain. However, as it had been for the Romans and Visigoths, the Moors did not find mountainous territory easy to conquer, and the lands along Spain&#x27;s northern coast never became part of Islamic Spain. With the beginning of the Moorish conquest in the 8th century, this region became a refuge for Christian nobles, and in 722, a &quot;de facto&quot; independent kingdom was established, the &quot;Regnum Asturorum&quot;, which was to become the cradle of the incipient &quot;Reconquista&quot; (Reconquest).

In the 10th century, the Kingdom of Asturias gave way to the Kingdom of León, and during the Middle Ages the geographic isolation of the territory made historical references scarce. Through the rebellion of Prince Henry (the later Henry II of Castile) in the 14th century, the Principality of Asturias was established. The most famous proponents of independence were Gonzalo Peláez and Queen Urraca, who, while achieving significant victories, were ultimately defeated by Castilian troops. After its integration into the Kingdom of Spain, Asturias provided the Spanish court with high-ranking aristocrats and played an important role in the colonisation of America. Since 1388, the heir to the Castilian (later Spanish) throne has been styled Prince (or Princess) of Asturias. In the 16th century, the population reached 100,000 for the first time, and within another century that number would double due to the arrival of American corn.
In the 18th century, Asturias was one of the centres of the Spanish Enlightenment. The renowned Galician thinker Benito de Feijóo settled in the Benedictine Monastery of San Vicente de Oviedo. Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos, a polymath and prominent reformer and politician of the late 18th century, was born in the seaside town of Gijón.

During the Napoleonic Wars, Asturias was the first Spanish province to rise up against the French following the abdication of King Ferdinand VII on 10 May 1808. Riots began in Oviedo and on 25 May the local government formally declared war on Napoleon with 18,000 men called to arms to resist invasion.

The Industrial Revolution came to Asturias after 1830 with the discovery and systematic exploitation of coal mines and iron factories at the mining basins of Nalón and Caudal. At the same time, there was significant migration to the Americas (especially Argentina, Uruguay, Puerto Rico, Cuba and Mexico); those who succeeded overseas often returned to their native land much wealthier. These entrepreneurs were known collectively as &quot;Indianos&quot;, for having visited and made their fortunes in the West Indies and beyond. The heritage of these wealthy families can still be seen in Asturias today: the region is dotted with many large &quot;modernista&quot; villas, as well as cultural institutions such as free schools and public libraries.
Asturias played an important part in the events that led up to the Spanish Civil War. In October 1934, Asturian miners and other workers staged an armed uprising (see Revolution of Asturias) to oppose the coming to power of the right-wing CEDA party, which had obtained three ministerial posts in the centralist government of the Second Spanish Republic. For a month, a Popular Front Committee exercised control in southern Asturias, while local workers committees sprang up elsewhere in the region. A defense committee led by anarcho-syndicalist supporters took power in Oviedo. Troops under the command of a then unknown general named Francisco Franco Bahamonde were brought from Spanish Morocco to suppress the revolt. Franco applied tactics normally reserved for overseas colonies, using troops of the Spanish Legion and Moroccan troops; ferocious oppression followed.

As a result, Asturias remained loyal to the republican government during the Spanish Civil War, and was the scene of an extraordinary defence in extreme terrain, the Battle of El Mazuco. With Franco eventually gaining control of all Spain, Asturias — traditionally linked to the Spanish Crown — was known merely as the &quot;Province of Oviedo&quot; from 1939 until Franco&#x27;s death in 1975. The province&#x27;s name was restored fully after the return of democracy to Spain, in 1977. In the 50s and 60s the industrial progress of Asturias continued with the constitution of national enterprises like Ensidesa and Hunosa, but the 80s was the decade of a dramatic industrial restructuring.

On 30 December 1981, Asturias became an autonomous community within the decentralised territorial structure established by the Constitution of 1978. Rafael Luis Fernández Álvarez, who had previously served as the President of the Regional Council since 1978, became the first President of the Principality of Asturias, upon the adoption of autonomy. The Asturian regional government holds comprehensive competencies in important areas such as health, education and protection of the environment. The current president, elected in 2019, is Adrián Barbón (PSOE).

==Administrative and territorial division==
Asturias is organised territorially into 78 municipalities, further subdivided into parishes.

Asturias is also divided into eight &quot;comarcas&quot;, which are not administrative divisions. They are only used as a system to homogenize the statistical data made by the Principality.

===Municipalities of Asturias===

===Parishes===
The or parish is the subdivision of the Asturian municipalities. Currently, there are 857 parishes integrating the 78 municipalities in the region, and they usually coincide with the ecclesiastic divisions.

==Geography and climate==


The Cantabrian Mountains (&quot;Cordillera Cantábrica&quot;) form Asturias&#x27;s natural border with the province of León to the south. In the eastern range, the Picos de Europa National Park contains the highest and arguably most spectacular mountains, rising to at the Torrecerredo peak. Other notable features of this predominantly limestone range are the Parque Natural de Redes in the central east, the central Ubiñas south of Oviedo, and the Parque Natural de Somiedo in the west. The Cantabrian mountains offer opportunities for activities such as climbing, walking, skiing and caving, and extend some in total, as far as Galicia province to the west of Asturias and Cantabria province to the east. Similar opportunities are available for the interested traveler of Asturias in Caldoveiro Peak.

The Asturian coastline is extensive, with hundreds of beaches, coves and natural sea caves. Notable examples include the Playa del Silencio (&quot;Beach of Silence&quot;) near the fishing village of Cudillero (west of Gijón), as well as the many beaches surrounding the summer resort of Llanes, such as the Barro, Ballota and Torimbia (the latter a predominantly nudist beach). Most of Asturias&#x27;s beaches are sandy, clean, and bordered by steep cliffs, on top of which it is not unusual to see grazing livestock.

The key features of Asturian geography are its rugged coastal cliffs and the mountainous interior.
The climate of Asturias is heavily marked by the Gulf Stream. Falling within the Cantabrian belt known as Green Spain it has high precipitations all year round. Summers are mild and, on the coast, winters also have relatively benign temperatures, rarely including frost. The cold is especially felt in the mountains, where snow is present from October till May. Both rain and snow are regular weather features of Asturian winters. In coastal or near-coastal areas, daytime high temperatures generally average around – during winter and – in summer.
==Pollution and conservation==
This part of Spain is one of the best conserved in the entire country, and full of vegetation and wild spaces. It holds two of the most important natural parks in Spain, and is very renowned for the Picos de Europa and Somiedo areas.

The Gijón area was marked and singled out as one of the pollution hotspots in Western Europe in a 2015 report from the International Institute for Applied Science Systems, where predictions for 2030 conditions were made. Gijón was marked much higher than any other Spanish metro area, in spite of the much larger populations in cities such as Madrid and Barcelona. This was attributed to heavy industrial activities. Since outdoor air pollution is a major cause of premature death in Europe, the excessive pollution is a major concern for Asturias. The majority of Asturias population live within a range from the port of Gijón, so pollution would be likely to heavily affect the population.

A Spanish government study conducted in 2010 regarding life expectancy in relative communities, Asturias was ranked lowest (tied with Andalucia) for male life expectancy with 76.7 years from 2007 readings. However, female life expectancy was 84 years and normal among autonomous communities. However, even the male life expectancy is only just below Western European standards, and exaggerated by the high Spanish life expectancy. Considering that many Asturians live in relatively close proximity to Gijón&#x27;s heavily industrial areas, these figures (especially for female relative health) still contribute to a position that Gijón is a safe location to live. The numbers for &quot;disability-free&quot; life expectancy has risen significantly both for males and females in the area since 1986, according to the report.

The coal fired electric generating plant, Aboño, completed a Spanish government/EU demand to install equipment to drastically reduce its emissions. Also, the other two major polluters - Arcelor Gijón and Arcelor Avilés - have announced an investment of 100 million euros to do the same. These factories have been a major cause of the area&#x27;s high airborne pollution.

==Demographics==
According to the 2020 census, the region has a population of 1,018,784 which constitutes 2.1% of the population of Spain, with the population density numbering 96 people per square kilometre.

Asturian population has the highest mortality rate in Spain and the lowest total fertility rate (1.03), the lowest in the European Union.

Immigration is not as high as in other Spanish regions as immigrants only represent, according to the 2017 census, 3.65% of population.

===Languages===

The only official language in Asturias is Spanish. The Asturian language, also known as Bable, is also spoken, and is protected by law (&quot;Ley 1/1998, de 23 de marzo, de uso y promoción del bable/asturiano&quot; — &quot;Law 1/1998, of 23 March, of Use and Promotion of Bable/Asturian&quot;). It is sometimes used by the Asturian civil service. In the western part of Asturias, Eonavian is also spoken, and its promotion also falls under the responsibility of Law 1/1998. Eonavian is intermediate between Asturian and Galician, though it is often regarded as just a variety of Galician; its use in the Asturian Administration is minor compared to the use of the Asturian language. Within Asturias, there is an ongoing process to establish place names in Asturian and Eonavian dialects.

===Religion===
In 2019, the Centre for Sociological Research carried a study showing the population of Asturias was 65.2% Catholic (25.1% practicing), 13.5% agnostic, and 12.8% atheist.
==Politics==
The organisation and political structure of Asturias is governed by the Statute of Autonomy of the Principality of Asturias, in force since 30 January 1982. According to the Statute, the institutional bodies of the Principality of Asturias are three: the Council of Government, the General Junta and President. The form of government of the Principality is Parliament: The General Junta is the legislature to choose, on behalf of the Asturian people, the President of the Principality of Asturias. The president of the Principality is also the president of the Council of Government, the head of executive power, and politically answerable to the General Junta.

The functions of the General Junta are the approval of budgets, and the direction and control of the action of the Council of Government. It is composed of 45 deputies, elected for four years through the universal suffrage within a system proportional representation that the allocation of deputies is based on D&#x27;Hondt method.

==Economy==


For centuries, the backbone of the Asturian economy was agriculture and fishing. Milk production and its derivatives was also traditional, but its big development was a byproduct of the economic expansion of the late 1960s. Nowadays, products from the dairy cooperative Central Lechera Asturiana are being commercialised all over Spain.

The main regional industry in modern times, however, was coal mining and steel production: in the times of Francisco Franco&#x27;s dictatorship, it was the centre of Spain&#x27;s steel industry. The then state-owned ENSIDESA steel company is now part of the privatised Aceralia, now part of the ArcelorMittal Group. The industry created many jobs, which resulted in significant migration from other regions in Spain, mainly Extremadura, Andalusia and Castile and León.

The steel industry is now in decline when measured in terms of number of jobs provided, as is the mining. The reasons for the latter are mainly the high costs of production to extract the coal compared to other regions. Regional economic growth is below the broader Spanish rate, though in recent years growth in service industries has helped reduce Asturias&#x27;s high rate of unemployment. Large out-of-town retail parks have opened near the region&#x27;s largest cities (Gijón and Oviedo), whilst the ever-present Spanish construction industry appears to continue to thrive.

Asturias has benefited extensively since 1986 from European Union investment in roads and other essential infrastructure, though there has also been some controversy regarding how these funds are spent, for example, on miners&#x27; pensions.

The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the autonomous community was 23.3 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 1.9% of Spanish economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 24,400 euros or 81% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 98% of the EU average. This makes the region the 10th richest in Spain, a big decrease from the 1970s/1980s - the heyday of the Spanish mining industry, when Asturias was commonly regarded as one of the most prosperous regions in Southern Europe. Asturias has been growing below the Spanish national average since the decline of the mining industry, and grew just 0.82% in 2008, the lowest of all regions in Spain. On the plus side, unemployment in Asturias is below the average of Spain; it stood at 13.7% in 2017.
==Transportation==
===Air===
Asturias is served by Asturias International Airport (OVD), from Oviedo, near the northwest coast and the industrial town of Avilés.

* Several national carriers link Asturias to Madrid and Barcelona, Alicante, Paris and others.
** Binter
** Iberia
** Volotea
** Vueling

Eastern Asturias is also easily accessible from Santander Airport. Recent improvements introduced in the road network permit flying into Santander and later driving into Asturias, which can be entered in less than an hour&#x27;s drive. The Irish airline Ryanair operates flights to Santander Airport from Frankfurt Hahn, Liverpool, Dublin, Edinburgh, London Stansted and Rome Ciampino.

===Sea===
El Musel (the Port of Gijón) is able to receive cruise ships of any size. Companies such as P&amp;O, Swan Hellenic or Hapag Lloyd choose the Port of Gijón every year for their calls in the Atlantic European Coast. The following areas are available for cruise vessels:
* Moliner quay: 313 m berthing with 14 m draught.
* 7ª Alignment: 326 m with 12 m draught.
* Espigón II. South alignment. 360 m berth with 9 m draught.

These locations allow a high degree of access control, with security guaranteed for both vessels and passengers alike. The city centre is only away and the Port Authority provides dedicated coach connection allowing passengers to take advantage of the cultural, gastronomic and commercial opportunities that Gijón has to offer.

Between 2010 and 2014, the city of Gijón was connected by ferry with the French city of Nantes. This connection was also known as the &quot;sea highway&quot; and it had a frequency of two ferries per day in both directions. The route was cancelled in September 2014.

===Train===
Spain&#x27;s national Renfe rail network also serves Asturias well; trains regularly depart to and from the Spanish interior. Major stops are the regional capital, Oviedo, and the main coastal city, Gijón. Meanwhile, the Renfe Feve rail company links the centre of the region with Eastern and Western Asturias. Under the Cantabrian Mountains, the Pajares Base Tunnel opened for commercial services end of November 2023, introducing AVE high speed trains.

===Bus===
There is also a comprehensive bus service run by the ALSA company. It links Avilés, Gijón, Oviedo and Mieres with Madrid and other major towns, several times a day. These include services to Barcelona, Salamanca, León, Valladolid, A Coruña, Bilbao, Seville, San Sebastián, Paris, Brussels and Nice, to name just a few.

==Main sights==

===Key attractions===
Oviedo is the capital city of Asturias and contains Santa María del Naranco and San Miguel de Lillo, a pre-Romanesque church and a palace respectively, which were built by the first Asturian kings on Mount Naranco, to the north of the city (World Heritage Site). In modern architecture, the &quot;Palacio de Congresos de Oviedo&quot; (or &quot;Modoo&quot;) was designed by Santiago Calatrava.

Gijón, the biggest city of Asturias, is a coastal city known for cultural and sports events, and a beach tourism centre in northern Spain. It also is known for the traditional Asturian gastronomy and for being an Asturian cider production spot. Museums in the city include the Universidad Laboral de Gijón, including a modern art museum and theatre.

Avilés is the third largest city in Asturias, where &quot;La villa del adelantado&quot; (as locals call it, in reference of Pedro Menéndez de Avilés) is a meeting point. &quot;Saint Nicholas of Bari&quot; or &quot;Capilla de los Alas&quot; in Romanesque and Romanesque-Gothic style, respectively; Palacio de Balsera, in Modernist style or St. Thomas of Canterbury church (dating from the 13th century) are examples which show the historical patrimony to be found in the city. The Centro Niemeyer, designed by the Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer, is an example of contemporary architecture in Asturias.

The Picos de Europa National Park, and other parts of the Asturian mountain range: The Picu Urriellu mountain (2519 m or 8262 ft), also known as &quot;El Naranjo de Bulnes&quot;, is a molar-shaped peak which, reputedly, glows orange in the evening sun, hence its name. Weather permitting, it can be viewed from Camarmeña village, near Poncebos, south of Arenas de Cabrales.

The shrine to the Virgin of Covadonga and the mountain lakes (&quot;Los Lagos&quot;), near Cangas de Onís: Legend has it that in the 8th century, the Virgin blessed Asturian Christian forces with a well-timed signal to attack Spain&#x27;s Moorish conquerors, thereby taking the invaders by surprise in the Battle of Covadonga. The &quot;Reconquista&quot; and eventual unification of all Spain is therefore said to have started in this very location.

The paleolithic art in the caves of Asturias is a declared World Heritage Site with the Paleolithic Art of Northern Spain.

Asturias also has examples of industrial heritage as a consequence of its industrial activities in the 19th and 20th centuries. It had metallurgical and chemical factories, mines, bridges and railways, including in the towns of Langreo, Mieres and Avilés.

The Asturian coast: especially the beaches in and around the summer resort of Llanes, the Playa del Silencio near Cudillero fishing village, or the &quot;white&quot; village of Luarca (Severo Ochoa hometown).

===Other places of interest===

* Ceceda village: east of Oviedo along the N634 road. Of particular interest in this exemplary settlement are the traditional &quot;horreos&quot; (grain silos), raised on stilts so as to keep field mice from getting at the grain.
* The Dobra River: south of Cangas de Onís, known for its unusual colour.
* The &quot;senda costera&quot; (coastal way) between Pendueles and Llanes: This partly paved nature route takes in some of Asturias&#x27; most spectacular coastal scenery, such as the noisy &quot;bufones&quot; (blowholes) and the Playa de Ballota.
* Caldoveiro Peak, a scenic mountain hiking area
* The unusual rock formation on the beach at Buelna village: east of Llanes. Best viewed at low tide.

==Culture==

===Architecture===

Asturias has a rich artistic legacy that emphasizes Romanesque (&quot;Asturias Arts&quot;) indigenous architecture with monuments like Santa María del Naranco, Santa Cristina de Lena and San Miguel de Lillo. These monuments have a Ramirense Romanesque style (due to Ramiro I) or San Julián de los Prados, known as Santullano (Oviedo) of the Alfonsino pre-Romanesque style (due to Alfonso II), which are all in Oviedo. Other examples of architecture are Villaviciosa&#x27;s church, San Salvador de Valdediós (commonly known by the Asturians as &quot;Conventín&quot;), and the church of San Salvador de Priesca. Another example is Cabranes&#x27; San Julian de Viñón.

The Romanesque style is very present, since all Asturias is crossed by one of the Camino de Santiago routes, which highlights the Monastery of San Pedro de Villanueva (near Cangas de Onis), the churches of San Esteban de Aramil (Siero), San Juan de Amandi (Villaviciosa) and Santa María de Junco (Ribadesella).

The Gothic style is not as abundant, but there are good examples of this style, such as the Cathedral of San Salvador in Oviedo.

The Baroque style is more present by means of palace architecture, with such notable examples as the Palace of Camposagrado and Velarde - the latter seat of Museum of Fine Arts of Asturias. The Baroque style stands out in public civil engineering and bridge tolls (Olloniego); the milestones, the chairs or seats present along the road to Madrid and the resort of Caldas de Priorio (Oviedo) building.
In 1985, the UNESCO declared the pre-Romanesque monuments and the Cathedral of Oviedo as World Heritage Sites.

In popular architecture, the traditional granaries in Asturias, called &quot;hórreos&quot;, are known for their demographic extension and their functional evolution, its basic characteristic being its mobility: it can be easily dismounted and transported to another location. The Panera is the evolution of the hórreo, with examples exceeding of area covered. The purpose of the horreo is to store objects and crops. With the arrival of maize and the beans, they were endowed with exterior corridors and railings for drying the harvests.

Asturias is home to the only architectural work in Spain (as well as the largest in Europe) of the Brazilian architect and disciple of Le Corbusier; Oscar Niemeyer: the Oscar Niemeyer International Cultural Centre. The architectural project was donated to the Principality by the architect, who was awarded the Prince of Asturias Award for the Arts, in the XXV edition of these awards. Niemeyer&#x27;s project combined several different elements, and projected an open space, a place for education, culture and peace.

In the capital of the Principality stands one of the most representative buildings of modern architecture, the Palace of Congresses of Oviedo, by the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, who also awarded the Prince of Asturias of Award for the Arts in 1999.

Special importance has been placed in recent years on the recovery of industrial heritage through various routes and industrial museums, especially in the central area of the region.

===Festivals and holidays===
Some of the most famous festivals in Asturias take place in the small town of Llanes. These festivals celebrate the important saints and the Virgin Mary adored by the town. The associations that prepare the festivals have a rivalry between them and each year they try to outdo each other with more impressive shows. The three most important are the festival of San Roque (St. Roque) held on the 16th of August, the festival of Nuestra Señora Virgen de La Guia (Our Lady, Virgin Mary, the Guide) held on the 8th of September, and the festival of Santa Maria Magdalena (St. Mary Magdalene) held on the 22nd of July. The Magdalena is well known for its march of logs where boys as young as 3 and men carry logs through the town until they reach the end point and start a large bonfire.

===Food and drink===
While Asturias is especially known for its seafood, the most famous regional dish is &quot;fabada asturiana&quot;, a rich stew typically made with large white beans (&quot;fabes&quot;), shoulder of pork (&quot;lacón&quot;), black pudding (&quot;morcilla&quot;), and spicy sausage (&quot;chorizo&quot;).

Apple groves foster the production of the region&#x27;s traditional alcoholic drink, a natural cider (&quot;sidra&quot;). Since it is natural and bottled without gas, it produces a weak carbonation, and when Asturian cider is served, it is poured in a particular way, &quot;el escanciado&quot;: the bottle is held above the head allowing for a long vertical pour, causing the cider to be aerated as it splashes into the glass below. After drinking most of the content, it is customary to splash a little out onto the ground, as a way to clean the glass of any lees for the next serving. Traditionally, the same glass is refilled and passed around, with everyone drinking from it in turn.

Asturian cheeses, especially Cabrales, are also eaten throughout Spain and beyond; Asturias is often called &quot;the land of cheeses&quot; (&quot;el país de los quesos&quot;).

===Sport===

Asturias has two main football teams: Sporting de Gijón and Real Oviedo, which have played over 35 seasons in La Liga. Other current notable sports teams are Oviedo CB (basketball) and AB Gijón Jovellanos (handball).

Racing driver Fernando Alonso is a two-time Formula One world champion, two-time Le Mans winner and FIA World Endurance winner. He races with Asturias&#x27; flag colours and the Asturian cross on his helmet. Cyclist Samuel Sánchez won a gold at the Olympic games. Football players from Asturias include World Cup winner David Villa as well as Quini, Luis Enrique, Juan Manuel Mata, and Santiago Cazorla, among others.

===Literature===

These are some notable people of Asturian Literature:
* Antón de Marirreguera (17th century)
* Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos (1744–1811)
* Ramón de Campoamor (1817–1901)
* Leopoldo Alas, &quot;Clarín&quot; (1851–1901)
* Armando Palacio Valdés (1853–1938)
* Ramón Pérez de Ayala (1880–1962)
* Alfonso Camín (1890–1982)
* Alejandro Casona (1903–1965)
* Carlos Bousoño (1923-2015)
* Ángel González (1925–2008)
* Corín Tellado (1927–2009)
* Gonzalo Suárez (1934)
* Rafael Reig (1963)
* Aurelio González Ovies (1964)
* Xuan Bello (1965)
* Jorge Moreno (1973)

==Music==

The music of Asturias is varied. The most characteristic instrument in traditional music is the Asturian bagpipe, or &quot;Gaita asturiana&quot;, which has a single drone. The bagpipe is often accompanied by the hand drum, whistles and accordion.

In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in traditional folk music, and several music ensembles have gained regional and international recognition for their ethnomusicological study and presentation of indigenous Asturian music. Notable examples include traditional pipers such as Xuacu Amieva and Tejedor and fusionist José Ángel Hevia (whose music video provides views of both the gaita and the Asturian landscape), and the groups Llan de Cubel, Xera, Nuberu and Felpeyu. Additionally, numerous rock, ska and heavy metal groups have also found relative success within Asturias, many of which incorporate elements of traditional Asturian music into their sound.

The Asturian anthem Asturias, patria querida (Asturias, beloved fatherland), which was a popular song adopted as the region&#x27;s anthem and formalised by &quot;Ley 1/1984, de 27 de Abríl&quot;.

===Orquesta Sinfónica del Principado de Asturias===
The Orquesta Sinfónica del Principado de Asturias is the premier orchestra in the Principality of Asturias. It is based in the Auditorio Príncipe Felipe in Oviedo, but also performs in the main concert venues in Gijón and Avilés. Rossen Milanov is the Music Director.

===Other===
&quot;Asturias&quot; is also the name of the fifth movement of the &quot;Suite Española, Op. 47&quot; by Spanish composer Isaac Albéniz. Nevertheless, the music has little in common with the region&#x27;s own folklore. Another famous piece of classical music more authentically inspired by the Asturian musical heritage is Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s &quot;Capriccio Espagnol&quot;, which prominently features a theme from an &quot;alborada&quot;, a dance tune traditionally played to celebrate the rising of the sun.

<doc id="68203" wikidata="Q989616" url="?curid=68203" title="Hove">
<text>Hove ( ) is a seaside resort in East Sussex, England. Alongside Brighton, it is one of the two main parts of the city of Brighton and Hove.

Originally a fishing village surrounded by open farmland, it grew rapidly in the 19th century in response to the development of its eastern neighbour Brighton; by the Victorian era it was a fully developed town with borough status. Neighbouring parishes such as Aldrington and Hangleton were annexed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The neighbouring urban district of Portslade was merged with Hove in 1974. In 1997, as part of local government reform, the borough merged with Brighton to form the Borough of Brighton and Hove; this unitary authority was granted city status in 2000.

==Name and etymology==
Old spellings of Hove include Hou (Domesday Book, 1086), la Houue (1288), Huua (13th century), Houve (13th and 14th centuries), Huve (14th and 15th centuries), Hova (16th century) and Hoova (1675). The etymology was disputed at length during the 20th century as academics offered several competing theories. Suggestions included an Old Norse word meaning &quot;hall&quot;, &quot;sanctuary&quot; or &quot;barrow&quot;, in reference to the Bronze Age barrow near the present Palmeira Square; an Old English phrase &quot;æt þæm hofe&quot; meaning &quot;at the hall&quot;; the Old English &quot;hufe&quot; meaning &quot;shelter&quot; or &quot;covering&quot;; and the Middle English &quot;hofe&quot; meaning &quot;anchorage&quot;. No other places in Britain are called Hove, and single-syllable names as a whole are rare in Sussex. The modern name was originally pronounced &quot;Hoove&quot; (). The present pronunciation () &quot;is comparatively recent&quot;.

==Geography and topography==
Northern parts of Hove are built on chalk beds, part of the White Chalk Subgroup found across southeast England. There are also extensive areas of clay and sandy soil: areas of Woolwich Formation and Reading Formation clay, pockets of clay embedded with flint, and a large deposit of brickearth in the Aldrington area. Hove&#x27;s beaches have the characteristics of a storm beach, and at high tide are entirely shingle, although low tide exposes sand between the sea-defence groynes, varying in extent from beach to beach. The water is then very shallow and suitable for paddling. On spring tides a greater expanse of sand is exposed beyond the end of the sea defences. The mean height above sea level of land in the old parish of Hove varied between . After Hove became a borough and expanded to incorporate land from neighbouring parishes, the highest point was approximately above sea level. There are no rivers in Hove, but Westbourne Gardens at the western boundary of the old parish is named after the &quot;West Bourne&quot;, which was still visible in the 19th century but which now runs underground, and a map of 1588 shows another stream called East Brook.

Until the 19th century the parish was mostly agricultural. Three farms—Wick, Goldstone and Long Barn—dominated the area and owned most of the land, which was of good quality: agricultural writer Arthur Young described it as &quot;uncommonly rich&quot;. Crops including oats, barley, corn and various vegetables were grown. Only in the 1870s were the last of the market gardens near Hove Street built over, and barley was grown near Eaton Road until the county cricket ground was built. Water was provided by wells west of Hove Street and between the coast road and the sea (the latter was destroyed in the Great Storm of 1703). The chalybeate spring on the Wick Farm estate was also used, especially by shepherds who drove their sheep between Hove, the South Downs and nearby villages along ancient drove roads. Some local shepherds supplemented their income by catching larks and northern wheatears and selling them for their meat; the latter were popular among fashionable visitors to Brighton. The birds were common on the hills and valleys around Hove, such as Goldstone Bottom. The practice died out when wheatears became a protected species in the late 18th century. The urban growth of Hove has shifted sheep-farming to more isolated parts of the South Downs, but several drove roads survive today as roads or footpaths. Hove Street and its northward continuation Sackville Road were originally known as &quot;Hove Drove&quot; and led on to the Downs. A long west–east route which crossed West Blatchington, Hove and Preston parishes on its way to Lewes now bears the names The Droveway, The Drove and Preston Drove. The section called The Droveway, on which the Goldstone Waterworks was built in the 1860s, had to be maintained as a right of way when Hove Park was built. A long diagonal footpath once known as Dyer&#x27;s Drove runs for several miles from Portslade-by-Sea on to the Downs, and Drove Road in Portslade village may have been used since Roman times.

A large Sarsen stone called the Goldstone stood on farmland northwest of the village, now part of Hove Park. Links with druids were claimed; and some 19th-century sources stated it was part of a ring of stones similar to Stonehenge, and that the others were buried in a pond at Goldstone Bottom, one of the coombes (small dry valleys) between the Downs and the sea. The Goldstone was dug up and buried by a farmer, but was unearthed and re-erected in a new position in the park in 1906.

Hove has little ancient woodland. Only two small areas survive: one in St Ann&#x27;s Well Gardens, and The Three Cornered Copse in the Tongdean area. The latter covers and belonged to the Marquess of Abergavenny until Hove Borough Council bought it in January 1935. Trees in the copse include ash, beech, elm and sycamore, although more than 120 mature beech trees were blown down in the Great storm of 1987.

Much of Hove is urbanised, but in 1994 there were of downland—about 37.5% of the total acreage of the then borough. In common with other parts of the South Downs, much of land has been used as sheep pasture, but crop farming also takes place and large areas of land were claimed for military training during World War II. Toads Hole Valley, a triangular site south of the Brighton Bypass, is &quot;the last piece of unspoiled downland in Hove&quot;. It has been privately owned since 1937 and has been proposed for urban development for many years: in 2002 it was stated that &quot;controversy rages over the future use of this land&quot;.

===Climate===
Climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round. The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is &quot;Cfb&quot; (Marine West Coast Climate/Oceanic climate).
== History and development ==

=== Pre-Roman evidence ===
Fossilised remains from the Pleistocene era have been found in three locations in Hove: an molar from &quot;Elephas antiquus&quot;, excavated from the garden of a house in Poplar Avenue; teeth from a juvenile elephant deep in the soil at Ventnor Villas; and a prehistoric horse&#x27;s tooth in the soil near Hove Street.

During building work near Palmeira Square in 1856–57, workmen uncovered a substantial burial mound. A prominent feature of the landscape since 1200 BC, the -high tumulus yielded, among other treasures, the Hove amber cup. Made of translucent red Baltic amber and approximately the same size as a regular china tea cup, the artefact can be seen in the Hove Museum and Art Gallery. Only one other has been found in Britain. Also buried in the coffin in which the amber cup was found were a stone battle-axe, a whetstone and a bronze dagger whose appearance is characteristic of the Wessex culture.

=== Domesday Book ===
There are entries for Brighton and Portslade (Bristelmestune and Porteslage) and small downland settlements like Hangleton (Hangetone), but nothing for the location of Hove itself.

=== Middle Ages and Renaissance ===
The first known settlement in Hove was around the 12th century when St Andrew&#x27;s Church was established. Hove remained insignificant for centuries, consisting of just a single street running north–south some 250 m from the church, which by the 16th century was recorded as being in ruins.
Hangleton Manor is a well-preserved 16th-century flint manor building. It is believed to have been built for Richard Bel(l)ingham, twice High Sheriff of Sussex, whose initials are carved into a fireplace, and whose coat of arms adorns a period plaster ceiling. The Manor is currently serving as a pub-restaurant and whilst it was once on open downland, it is now surrounded by the 20th-century Hangleton housing estate.

===18th century===
In 1723 a traveller, the antiquary John Warburton, wrote, &#x27;I passed through a ruinous village called Hove which the sea is daily eating up and is in a fair way of being quite deserted; but the church being quite large and a good distance from the shore may perhaps escape&#x27;. Nevertheless, in around 1702 The Ship Inn had been built at the seaward end of the main street, and was therefore vulnerable to erosion of the coast.

In 1724, Daniel Defoe wrote in reference to the south coast, &#x27;I do not find they have any foreign commerce, except it be what we call smuggling and roguing; which I may say, is the reigning commerce of all this part of the English coast, from the mouth of the Thames to the Land&#x27;s End in Cornwall.&quot;

The fertile coastal plain west of the Brighton boundary had significant deposits of brickearth and by c.1770 a brickfield had been established on the site of what would become Brunswick Square. Later, other brickfields were established further west, remaining until displaced by housing development.

=== Regency and Victorian developments ===
The census of 1801 recorded only 101 residents to Brighton&#x27;s 7,339. By 1821, the year the Prince Regent was crowned George IV, the population had risen to 312, Brighton&#x27;s too had trebled to 24,429 with the dwellings still clustered on Hove Street, surrounded by an otherwise empty landscape of open farmland. This relative isolated location of Hove, compared to Brighton, was ideal for smuggling and there was considerable illicit activity. Hove smugglers became notorious, with contraband often being stored in the now partially repaired St. Andrew&#x27;s Church. Tradition has it that The Ship Inn was a favourite rendezvous for the smugglers, and in 1794 soldiers were billeted there. In 1818 there was a pitched battle on Hove beach between revenue men and smugglers, from which the latter emerged as the victors. As part of the concerted drive by Parliament to combat smuggling, a coastguard station was opened at the southern end of Hove Street in 1831, next to The Ship Inn.

Bull-baiting took place on Saint Andrew&#x27;s Day and on the Tuesday after Easter Sunday, but the practice ceased after 1810 when a bull broke free and ran through the crowd. The bullring was between the coast road and the beach, southwest of Hove Street, and the fights were promoted by the Ship Inn—which also organised cockfighting matches, even after this activity was made illegal.

In the years following the Coronation of 1821 the Brunswick estate of large Regency houses with a theatre, riding schools and their own police was developed on the seafront near the boundary with Brighton. Although within Hove parish the residents of these elegant houses avoided the name of the impoverished village a mile to the west as an address. Straggling development along the coast loosely connected the estate to fashionable Brighton, so that name was used instead.

Dating from 1822, the Brighton to Shoreham turnpike crossed the north of Hove parish along the route of the present Old Shoreham Road.

The Brighton and Hove Gas Company was established in 1825 and built a gasworks next to St Andrew&#x27;s Church in 1832. Houses in Brunswick Terrace were the first to be lit by gas. Production moved to a new gasworks at Portslade in 1871 and the Hove works became a storage facility. The site at Portslade was close to Shoreham Harbour, so coal could be transported to it directly. Increasing demand for gas meant a new gasholder, one of the largest in Sussex, was built on the Hove site in 1877. Of novel construction for the time, it was used until September 1994.

By 1831 the development of the eastern end of the parish had increased the population to 1,360 but this brought few economic benefits to Hove village itself, with the historian Thomas Horsfield describing it in 1835 as &#x27;a mean and insignificant assemblage of huts&#x27;.

St Andrew&#x27;s Church was reconstructed and enlarged to its present form in 1836, to the design of the architect George Basevi (1794–1845), and features prominently in the background of paintings of the period. About this time, a very substantial and tall wall was built between the churchyard and adjoining gasworks, remaining in place to this day.

The flat coastal plain was useful for sport as from 1848 to 1871 England&#x27;s oldest county club, Sussex County Cricket Club, used the Royal Brunswick Ground in Hove, situated roughly on the site of present-day Third and Fourth Avenues. In 1872 the club moved to the present County Cricket Ground, Hove.

Two further large estates were developed between Hove village and Brunswick, and both avoided using the name Hove: Cliftonville was designed, laid out and initially developed under Frederick Banister from the late 1840s; and West Brighton Estate in the 1870s.

West of Brunswick, the seafront of West Brighton Estate forms the end of a series of avenues, in numerical order beginning with First Avenue, mostly composed of fine Victorian villas built as another well-integrated housing scheme featuring mews for artisans and service buildings. Grand Avenue, The Drive, and the numbered avenues were developed through the 1870s and 1880s, with many of the buildings constructed by William Willett.

Hove&#x27;s wide boulevards contrast with the bustle of Brighton, although many of the grand Regency and Victorian mansions have been converted into flats. Marlborough Court was once the residence of the Duchess of Marlborough, aunt of Winston Churchill. The Irish nationalist leader and Home Rule MP Charles Stewart Parnell used to visit his lover, the already married Kitty O&#x27;Shea at the house she rented in 1883 in Medina Villas, Hove. In the subsequent divorce action the cook alleged that Captain O’Shea returned home unexpectedly and Parnell beat a hasty retreat by climbing over the balcony and down a rope ladder. Parnell died at Hove in 1891 after marrying Kitty following her divorce.

The Hove Club, a private members&#x27; club located at 28 Fourth Avenue, was founded in 1882.

=== Twentieth century ===
In the 1910s eleven cottages were built on the beach on the Western Esplanade between Hove Lagoon and Portslade. Named Seaside Villas, these houses have attracted a number of famous residents. War poets David Jones and Robert Graves spent time there, as did the playwright Joe Orton. More recently it has been home to celebrities such as Adele, David Walliams, Zoe Ball and Heather McCartney. Another resident, DJ Fat Boy Slim, owns the nearby Big Beach Cafe.

In 1966 Hove Town Hall designed by eminent architect Alfred Waterhouse burned down. It was replaced by a Brutalist building designed by local architect John Wells-Thorpe.

===First World War===
Over 600 men from Hove were killed in the First World War. After the armistice, the town established a war memorial committee to decide on commemoration of the dead. The committee commissioned Sir Edwin Lutyens, the architect responsible for the Cenotaph on London&#x27;s Whitehall which became the focus of national remembrance services. Lutyens proposed a similar cenotaph for Hove and went as far as constructing a wooden mock-up which was displayed on Hove Lawns but the committee rejected the design. The eventual result was a statue of Saint George atop a column, situated in the centre of Grand Avenue. The memorial does not contain the names of the fallen, which are instead recorded on a bronze plaque in Hove Library.

===Second World War===
At the outbreak of war, the recently completed Hove Marina leisure centre was immediately requisitioned as a training base for new officers of the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve (RNVR) and was given the title . The establishment opened on 11 September 1939 and later expanded into Lancing College. By the end of the war, the base had trained 22,508 British, Commonwealth and allied officers for active sea service.

On 22 September 1939, the second Anglo-French Supreme War Council was held at Hove Town Hall to discuss the progress of the war and define future strategy. The British delegation included the Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain and the Foreign Secretary, Lord Halifax, while the French party was led by the Minister of Defence and Prime Minister of France, Édouard Daladier and Commander-in-Chief of the Armies, Maurice Gamelin. Also present was Sir Alexander Cadogan who related that the town hall staff had only been told to expect some government officials, with the result that the prime minister was greeted with the exclamation; &quot;Chamberlain! !&quot;.

The Brighton and Hove area was subjected to heavy bombing by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; between 1940 and 1944, known collectively as the &quot;Brighton Blitz&quot;, which resulted in the deaths of 198 civilians.

==Governance and politics==

===Former Hove borough===

The ancient parish of Hove originally consisted of only and in 1801 had a population of just 101. In 1829, local landowners petitioned parliament for powers to improve the Brunswick Town area of Hove with paving, lighting and drainage, resulting in the appointment of a body known as the Brunswick Commissioners in the following year. Subsequently, further commissioners were appointed for West Hove and to administer the Hove Police, all three bodies being united by the Hove Commissioners Act of 1873. In 1893 the civil parish of Aldrington was joined to Hove and in 1894, the Hove Commissioners were replaced by an Urban District Council. Finally in 1898 the Municipal Borough of Hove received its royal charter. This was enlarged in 1927 by the addition of the parishes of Preston Rural and Hangleton along with parts of West Blatchington and Patcham. The corporation consisted of a mayor, ten aldermen, and thirty councillors, elected from ten wards. The first town hall was built in 1882. On 1 April 1997 Brighton Borough Council and Hove Borough Council were merged to form Brighton and Hove City Council.

===Coat of arms===
While it was still a separate entity, Hove had its own coat of arms. The escutcheon&#x27;s official heraldic description is &quot;Tierced in pairle: 1. Or a saltire azure voided argent; 2. Gules two pairs of leg-irons interlaced argent; 3. Checky or and azure three martlets or, all in a border ermine charged with six martlets or&quot;. The design incorporates several features relevant to Hove&#x27;s history. The ships of the French raiders who repeatedly attacked the coast in the Brighton and Hove area in the 16th century are represented by the crest. The saltire of Saint Andrew and the leg-shackles of Leonard of Noblac refer to the ancient parish churches of Hove and Aldrington, St Andrew&#x27;s and St Leonard&#x27;s respectively. William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey held land in the Rape of Lewes at the time of the Norman Conquest including the territory covered by Hove; his colours were blue and gold, represented by the chequerboard pattern in the background of the shield.

== Commercial ==
The town centre received substantial renovation in the late 1990s when the popular George Street was pedestrianised. Some concern about the pedestrianisation and its impact (supposedly killing trade) was expressed by residents, the local newspaper &quot;The Argus&quot;, and small locally owned shops. However, these fears proved unfounded. In 2003 these small shops were joined by the centre&#x27;s first large supermarket (a Tesco), built on the site of a former gasometer.
== Landmarks and attractions ==
===Places of worship===

Ecclesiastically, Hove was part of a joint parish with Preston between 1531 and 1879. The newly separate parish of Hove was then split several times in the late 19th and 20th centuries as the population grew and more Anglican churches were built. St Andrew&#x27;s Church near the top end of Hove Street was the ancient parish church but was in ruins by the 1830s, when it was rebuilt in a Neo-Gothic style. St Helen&#x27;s Church at Hangleton, lightly restored in the 1870s, retains the style of a simple Sussex downland church. St Peter&#x27;s Church was abandoned and fell to ruins in the 17th century when West Blatchington became depopulated, but it was rebuilt in the 1890s. St Leonard&#x27;s, the parish church of Aldrington, was also ruinous until 1878 when local population growth necessitated its restoration.

A second church dedicated to St Andrew opened on the Brunswick estate in 1828. St John the Baptist&#x27;s was built on Palmeira Square in 1852, followed by St Patrick&#x27;s nearby in 1858 and Holy Trinity in central Hove in 1864. St Barnabas served the poorer areas around Sackville Road from 1883; All Saints on Eaton Road dates from 1889 to 1891; St Philip&#x27;s was built in 1895 as a second church for Aldrington, and opened a mission hall (now Holy Cross Church) in the Poets&#x27; Corner area in 1903; St Thomas the Apostle opened on Davigdor Road in 1909; St Agnes was built north of Hove station in 1913; Bishop Hannington Memorial Church opened in West Blatchington in 1939; and The Knoll estate has been served by St Richard&#x27;s Church since 1961, replacing a 1930s church hall. Four of these churches have closed: St Agnes in 1977, St Andrew&#x27;s in Brunswick Town in 1990, St Thomas in 1993 and Holy Trinity in 2007. All Saints Church, a Grade I-listed building by John Loughborough Pearson, became the parish church of Hove in 1892.

The Church of the Sacred Heart was Hove&#x27;s first Roman Catholic church. It was founded in 1876 by St Mary Magdalen&#x27;s Church in Brighton, whose first priest left money in his will for a church in Hove. Work was delayed by disputes over the site, but after land on Norton Road was secured construction started in 1880 and the west end was finished in 1887. The Sacred Heart in turn founded a mission church in 1902 to serve the Aldrington and Portland Road areas of Hove. St Peter&#x27;s Hall was used until the &quot;startling&quot; basilica-style red-brick St Peter&#x27;s Church was opened in 1915. Mass was said in Hangleton from the 1940s in a hall and at the Grenadier pub, but in the 1950s land on Court Farm Road was bought for a church and St George&#x27;s Church opened in 1968. It serves West Blatchington and Hangleton, and is now part of a joint parish with Southwick and Portslade.

Hove was included in the Lewes and Brighton Methodist Circuit from 1808, although at times during the 19th century no Methodists (Wesleyan, Primitive or Bible Christian) lived in the area. A secondhand tin tabernacle was erected on Portland Road for Wesleyans in 1883, and the present Hove Methodist Church was built on the site in 1896. A Bible Christian chapel was built in 1905 on Old Shoreham Road but never thrived; it closed in 1947 and was sold to a charity. Primitive Methodists worshipped at a large chapel on Goldstone Villas from 1878 until 1933. It was converted into offices in 1968.

Hove&#x27;s General Baptist congregation developed in the 1870s and met in a gymnasium and a tin tabernacle until Holland Road Baptist Church opened in 1887. A deacon from the church started holding Baptist meetings in a new church building on the Hangleton estate in 1957. It now has the name Oasis Church. A former Congregational mission hall in Aldrington, built in 1900, is home to the Baptist-aligned New Life Christian Church. Stoneham Road Baptist Church was founded in 1904 by the Holland Road church to serve the Poets&#x27; Corner area. It closed and was demolished in 2008. Baptists also met in Connaught Terrace from 1879, and Strict Baptists worshipped at Providence Chapel on Haddington Street from 1880 until 1908.
A Congregational chapel was built on Ventnor Villas in 1870, and 41 years later St Cuthbert&#x27;s Presbyterian Church opened on Holland Road. After the two denominations merged in 1972 to form the United Reformed Church, the congregations came together in 1980 at the Ventnor Villas premises. These were renamed Central United Reformed Church and continue to serve as the main centre for that denomination in Hove. St Cuthbert&#x27;s was demolished in 1984. In 1938 trustees of the Congregational chapel founded another on the Hangleton estate. Hounsom Memorial Church is also now part of the United Reformed Church.

The Salvation Army have worshipped in Hove since 1882 and occupy a citadel built in 1890 on Sackville Road. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses meet in Aldrington at a Kingdom Hall which was built in 1999 to replace a hall of 1950. A non-denominational gospel hall stands on Edward Avenue in the Goldstone Valley area. The Christian Arabic Evangelical Church meets in a converted bungalow on Old Shoreham Road in Aldrington. A former Anglican church of 1909 on Davigdor Road has served Coptic Orthodox Christians from a wide area since 1994, when it was rededicated as St Mary and St Abraam Church by Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria. Buddhists have a cultural centre and place of worship at a former convent near Furze Hill. Other former churches in Hove include an Elim Pentecostal chapel (in use 1929–1994) on Portland Road, the Seventh-day Adventist chapel on Hove Place, whose congregation now meet at Hove Methodist Church, and a former mission hall in the Poets&#x27; Corner area which was used until 1981 as a chapel for the local Society of Dependants sect.

=== Hove Museum of Creativity ===
Hove Museum of Creativity is a municipally-owned museum which houses a permanent collection of toys, contemporary crafts, fine art and local history artefacts, as well as holding temporary exhibitions of contemporary crafts.

== Education ==

== Sport and leisure ==
The home of Sussex County Cricket Club is at County Cricket Ground, Hove. It is used for county, national and international matches, music concerts, fireworks displays, and has found resurgent popularity with the introduction of Twenty20.

Until 1997 Hove was home to the Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.&#x27;s Goldstone Ground. The football club is known as The Seagulls and a seagull crest has been used since 1977. In September 2007, planning permission was confirmed for the club&#x27;s new ground, at Falmer, still within the city limits but on the Brighton side. The new stadium started development in late 2008, with the first game being played in August 2011.

Hove is home to a detachment of the Sussex Army Cadet Force, a volunteer youth organisation, sponsored by the Ministry of Defence, which accepts cadets aged between 12 and 18 years of age.

Brighton &amp; Hove Hockey Club is a field hockey club and its home ground is based in Hove.
There are a number of parks in Hove including Hove Park and St. Anne&#x27;s Well Gardens which has many native and exotic trees and a scented garden. The King Alfred Centre which is currently a leisure centre with swimming pool and a couple of gyms on the seafront. In March 2007 Brighton and Hove City Council gave planning permission for a £290 million development designed by Frank Gehry. This project was scrapped in January 2009 when the developer pulled out. 

Hove Promenade parkrun, situated by Hove Lawns started in July 2015 and is one of five such free, timed 5 km runs across the city. Hove Lawns is a stretch of lawns along the seafront divided into two parts – Brunswick Lawns and King’s Lawns.

The Monarch&#x27;s Way long-distance footpath threads south-eastwards across the town from the Downs, before heading west along the seafront towards its terminus at Shoreham-by-Sea.

==&quot;Hove, actually&quot;==

A well-known reply by residents of Hove, usually humorous, when asked if they live in Brighton is &quot;Hove, actually&quot; thus maintaining a distinction with their neighbour. One source has identified the locally resident actor Laurence Olivier (who lived in Brighton) as the origin of the phrase. In the 1990s the Hove borough council used the slogan &quot;Hove, actually&quot; to promote the town for tourism.

== Transport ==

Hove has several A-roads. The A259 runs along Kingsway, forming the main seafront road in Hove. The A270 Old Shoreham Road, another major west–east route further north, was originally part of the A27 trunk road before the Brighton bypass was built. The A2023 runs north from the A259 through central Hove and West Blatchington, meeting the A2038 on the edge of Hangleton and continuing to a junction with the A23 London–Brighton road. Other main routes, all with B-road status, include Grand Avenue and The Drive (B2185), Cromwell Road and Davigdor Road (B2120) and New Church Road, Church Road and Western Road (B2066).

There were of roads in Hove borough in 1906, rising to in 1948. Even in the latter year some were still paved with wood.

===Buses===

Many bus routes serve central Hove, and Church Road/New Church Road and Blatchington Road/Portland Road are important bus corridors. Most services are operated by Brighton &amp; Hove, a bus company which has been owned by the Go-Ahead Group since November 1993. Routes include the 1 and 1X to Whitehawk and Mile Oak, the 2 to Shoreham-by-Sea, Steyning and Rottingdean, the 5, 5A and 5B to the Hangleton estate and the Hollingbury and Patcham estates in Brighton, the 6 to Brighton railway station, the 7 to Brighton Marina, the 21 to the Goldstone Valley estate and Brighton Marina, the 25 to the Universities of Sussex and Brighton, the 46 to Southwick and Hollingbury and the 49 to Moulsecoomb. The Big Lemon operates a circular route serving Portslade, the Knoll Estate and Hangleton and another serving Knoll Estate and Hangleton and continuing to Brighton railway station, central Brighton, Brighton Marina, Rottingdean and Saltdean. Stagecoach South operates the Coastliner 700 route through Hove, serving Brighton to the east and Shoreham-by-Sea, Worthing and Littlehampton to the west, with connections to Bognor Regis, Chichester and Portsmouth. Several National Express coaches on route 025 (Worthing–London) serve Hove each morning, calling at a stop on the A259 near the King Alfred Leisure Centre.

Hove&#x27;s first bus service ran from the Ship Inn on Hove Street to Black Rock near Rottingdean and started on 11 May 1853. Seven return journeys ran daily. Local businessman A.C. Elliott became a licensed bus operator in 1879 with ten vehicles, 12 conductors and 13 drivers, running services between Hove and central Brighton. Other operators soon started running buses in competition, and the Hove Commissioners &quot;[kept] a tight rein on things&quot; by issuing and renewing licences once a year. From 1901, horse-drawn buses began to be replaced with petrol-driven vehicles and, from 1908, by experimental electric buses as well. Thomas Tilling became a major operator in Hove after gaining licences for Portslade–Brighton routes in 1912. He operated from premises on Holland Road until new garages and offices were built on Conway Street in 1916. The company was renamed the Brighton, Hove and District Omnibus Company in 1935, and the Conway Street premises were rebuilt in 1939–40 to the design of H.R. Starkey. By 1927 Southdown Motor Services was another major local operator: Hove Council licensed 100 of its vehicles for local and longer-distance work, and the company&#x27;s main works was at Portslade. It became part of the National Bus Company in 1968 along with the Brighton, Hove and District Omnibus Company. As a result, the latter&#x27;s works at Conway Street closed in 1969. The companies separated again in 1986 and the former Tilling operations became the Brighton &amp; Hove Bus and Coach Company, now the city&#x27;s main operator. The Conway Street premises were retained as a bus garage.

===Railways===

The first railway station named Hove opened at the top of Holland Road on 12 May 1840 on the Brighton to Shoreham-by-Sea line (now the West Coastway line). It closed on 1 March 1880, but a new station named Holland Road Halt opened on approximately the same site on 3 September 1905. Its two timber platforms were still in place when it closed permanently on 7 May 1956.

The present Hove railway station, west of Brighton station, opened at the top of Goldstone Villas on 1 October 1865 with the name Cliftonville; it was renamed West Brighton in 1879, Hove and West Brighton in 1894, and received its present name in 1895. Further west, from Brighton, Aldrington railway station opened with the name Dyke Junction Halt on 3 September 1905, taking the name Aldrington Halt from 17 June 1932 when the platforms were resited and rebuilt. Portslade railway station, serving Aldrington and West Hove as well as Portslade village and Portslade-by-Sea, opened with the line on 12 May 1840 but was closed between 1847 and 1857. Its original station buildings survive, but goods facilities were withdrawn in 1968. It is west of Brighton. There is a level crossing at the west end. All three stations are managed and served by Southern.

Immediately west of Aldrington station, the Brighton and Dyke Railway branched off and headed north through West Blatchington and Hangleton to a terminus at Devil&#x27;s Dyke on the South Downs. Golf Club Halt opened in 1891 to serve Brighton and Hove Golf Course, and Rowan Halt opened in 1933 on Rowan Avenue to serve the Hangleton and West Blatchington areas. The branch line opened on 1 September 1887; it closed permanently on 31 December 1938, having already been closed for three years from 1917.

The Cliftonville Curve opened in 1879 to connect the West Coastway line with the Brighton main line, allowing trains to travel between the lines without reversing at Brighton station. It passes through a tunnel. There is also a tunnel between Brighton and Hove stations.

===Taxis===
The first Hackney carriage licences were issued by the Hove Police Commissioners in 1859. Within 30 years passengers could choose between a wide range of vehicles, including first- and second-class cabs, hand-pulled invalid carts, goat-drawn chaises, landaus and broughams. The first motor cab was licensed in 1908, but horse-drawn carriages persisted until after 1925. Hackney carriages are now licensed by the city council are coloured white and aqua. Fares are also regulated by the council. There are 17 taxi ranks in Hove, including two which operate at night only.

<text>Extremadura ( ; ; ; ; Fala: &quot;Extremaúra&quot;) is a landlocked autonomous community of Spain. Its capital city is Mérida, and its largest city is Badajoz. Located in the central-western part of the Iberian Peninsula, it is crossed from east to west by the Tagus and Guadiana rivers. The autonomous community is formed by the two largest provinces of Spain: Cáceres and Badajoz. Extremadura is bordered by Portugal to the west and by the autonomous communities of Castile and León (north), Castilla–La Mancha (east), and Andalusia (south).

It is an important area for wildlife, particularly with the major reserve at Monfragüe, which was designated a National Park in 2007, and the International Tagus River Natural Park (&quot;Parque Natural Tajo Internacional&quot;). The regional government is led by the president of the Regional Government of Extremadura, a post currently held by María Guardiola of the People&#x27;s Party.

The Day of Extremadura is celebrated on 8 September. It coincides with the Catholic festivity of Our Lady of Guadalupe. The region, featuring an enormous energy surplus and hosting lithium deposits, is at the forefront of Spain&#x27;s plans for energy transition and decarbonisation.

==Geography==
=== Physical environment ===
Extremadura is contained between and latitude, and and longitude.

The area of Extremadura is , making it the fifth largest of the Spanish autonomous communities. It is located in the Southern Plateau (a subdivision of the Spanish Central Plateau).

The region is crossed from West to East by two large rivers, the Tagus and the Guadiana, lining up three basic areas from North to South by combining mountain ranges and rivers: the territory spanning from the Sistema Central to the Tagus, the so-called &quot;Mesopotamia extremeña&quot; in between the Tagus and the Guadiana and the territory from the Guadiana to Sierra Morena. Besides the catchment basins of the Tagus and the Guadiana covering most of the territory by far, fringe areas of the region are drained by the Douro (north) and the Guadalquivir (south). Notable Tagus tributaries include the Tiétar and the Alagón (rightbank) and the Almonte, Ibor, Salor and the Sever (leftbank). Regarding the Guadiana, important leftbank tributaries include Guadarranque and Ruecas and rightbank tributaries include the Zújar River and the Matachel.

The highest point in Extremadura, the high Calvitero (or El Torreón), is located in the Sistema Central, in the northeastern end of the region, bordering with Castile and León. The main subranges of the Sistema Central in Extremadura are the Sierra de Gata and Sierra de Béjar.

The modest heights of Sierra de las Villuercas (topping at on the Pico de las Villuercas) rise in the &quot;Mesopotamia extremeña&quot;. Other notable ranges include the Sierra de Montánchez and the Sierra de San Pedro, part of the larger Montes de Toledo system.

The Sierra Morena—the limit between Extremadura and Andalusia—and the Sierra de Tentudía (topping at on the Pico Tentudía) rise in the south.

There are four different hydrographic basins:
* The basin of the Tagus (), with two principal tributaries: on the right, the Tiétar and the Alagón; and on the left, the Almonte, Ibor, Salor and the Sever. The tributaries on the right edge carry a large quantity of water, which feed the gorges of the Sistema Central where the rainfall is abundant and the winter brings a great quantity of snow.
* The basin of the Guadiana, which has principal tributaries: 
* The basin of the Guadalquivir with only in Extremadura (2.45% of total).
* The basin of the Douro () with only in Extremadura (0.04% of its basin).

===Climate===
The climate of Extremadura is predominantly hot-summer Mediterranean (&quot;Csa&quot; in the Köppen climate classification), with some regions being cold semi-arid (&quot;BSk&quot; in the Köppen climate classification). Extremadura generally presents average annual temperatures somewhat warmer than most of the hinterland of the Iberian Peninsula, featuring nonetheless a north–south gradient. Annual thermal amplitude generally ranges from 16 to 19 °C. Average annual precipitation stands at around 600 mm. Parts of the Sistema Central presents more than 1,500 mm while it barely rains 400 mm in parts of the province of Badajoz. Summers are very hot and dry, with the rain concentrated in the cold months instead, leading to a high degree of water stress during the summer months.

==History==
During the time of the Roman Empire, the area that is known today as Autonomous Community of Extremadura was part of Lusitania, a Roman province that included most of current day Portugal (except for the northern area today known as Norte Region) and the central western portion of the current day Spain. Mérida (now capital of Extremadura) became the capital of the Roman province of Lusitania, and one of the most important cities in the Roman Empire.

Like the bulk of the Iberian Peninsula, the territory was conquered by the Umayyads in the early 8th century. As part of the Emirate and later Caliphate of Córdoba, it largely constituted a territorial subdivision (&quot;kūra&quot;) of the former polities centered on Mérida. Following the collapse of the Caliphate in the early 11th century during the so-called Fitna of al-Andalus and its ensuing fragmentation into ephemeral statelets (taifas), the bulk of the territory of current day Extremadura became part of the (First) Taifa of Badajoz (&quot;Baṭalyaws&quot;), centered around the namesake city and founded by Sapur, a saqaliba previously freed by Al-Hakam II.

Conversely, the kingdoms of León, Castile and Portugal (most notably the first one) made advances in the 11th and 12th centuries across the territory (with for example the successive Leonese conquests of Coria in 1079 and 1142, the Portuguese attempts at expanding across the Guadiana basin in the second half of the 12th century, or the Castilian founding of Plasencia in 1186) not free from setbacks either caused by the Almoravid and Almohad impetus, which also entailed the demise of the first and second taifa of Badajoz in 1094 and 1150, respectively. In the Almohad case, their 1174 offensive removed Leonese control from every fortress south of the Tagus (including Cáceres). After the Almohad disaster at the 1212 Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa, the remaining part of current-day Extremadura under Muslim control fell to the troops led by Alfonso IX of León—Alcántara (1214), Cáceres (1227–1229), Mérida (1230), Badajoz (1230)—and later to the military orders of Santiago and Alcántara—Trujillo (1232), Medellín (1234)—on behalf of Ferdinand III of Castile. The last fortresses in the Lower Extremadura were conquered by Christians by 1248.

By the late Middle Ages, the territory of the current-day region consisted of mayorazgos of the military orders of Santiago and Alcántara (about half the territory), nobiliary lordships (about a quarter of the territory) and royal demesne towns (the other quarter of the territory).

In between the 15th and 16th centuries, the concept of the Leonese and Castilian &quot;extremaduras&quot; diluted and the name eventually came to refer to the territory of the current-day region. The territory lacked nonetheless shared government and administration institutions.

In between 1570 and 1572, the Crown forcibly relocated about 11,000 &quot;moriscos&quot; into the territory as part of the deportation of Granadans that followed the defeat of the Alpujarras revolt. The distribution was somewhat chaotic although some places with an already &quot;threatening&quot; population of old moriscos (such as Hornachos, Magacela and Benquerencia) were avoided as resettlement locations for the Granadan moriscos.

Two generations later, the expulsion of the moriscos from the region began in 1609, starting with the moriscos of Hornachos, the first expulsion in the Crown of Castile. By September 1610 about two thirds of the moriscos of Extremadura had been already expelled and by 1611 the number amounted to 12,776. Those who avoided the early orders of expulsion abided to reports of being &#x27;good Christians&#x27; or claimed a status as &#x27;old moriscos&#x27;. At the height of 1612, there were reports of remaining moriscos in Trujillo, Mérida and Plasencia.
Located in the most able path from the Meseta Central to Portugal, the territory suffered greatly due to warfare from the 1640–1668 Portuguese Restoration War, characterised not by the movement of large armies but for pillage, skirmishes, raids, and destruction of economic resources and settlements across both sides of the &quot;Raya&quot;. The growing role of the fortified place of Badajoz (halfway between Lisbon and Madrid), in the wake of the installment of the Captaincy General of Extremadura consolidated the clout of the military in the region.

By the late 18th century, the Extremaduran countryside languished, experiencing a deep crisis. There was a diminishing share of land dedicated to crops. The growing cattle sector induced the creation of yet more pastures, adding up to the structural problem stemmed from the extraordinary degree of concentration of land ownership. By the end of the Ancien Régime, the clergy, municipal councils and the royal army mattered more than the lesser role of the entitled nobility.

Railways were developed in the second half of the 19th century. In September 1863, a passenger train arrived to Badajoz from Elvas, Portugal. It was the first train in the region and the first international service in the Iberian Peninsula. In 1866, the was completed, enabling the link with Madrid. The Madrid–Valencia de Alcántara line, a new connection passing through the province of Cáceres, was fully completed in 1881.

During the 1936–1939 Spanish Civil War, the Nationalist faction Columna Madrid advanced quickly across the province of Badajoz in August 1936 and left merciless repression and mass casualties behind. Badajoz was the Spanish province where the Francoist repression comparatively took the highest relative toll of victims during the war and the immediate Post-War period; there were around 12,000 executions in the province (out of the 14,000 in the whole region), compared to around 1,600 victims of the Republican repression.

In the mid 20th century, the Francoist dictatorship pursued a policy of colonization and agrarian reform in the region to foster the economy, transforming thousands of hectares of dryland crops into irrigated lands, also favouring the erection of 63 new settlements by the Instituto Nacional de Colonización (INC). The second half of the 20th century saw a massive rural flight out of the region, both to the industrialised areas of Spain (already started in 1955) as well as to richer European countries (such as Germany, France and Switzerland), both of which notably intensified after 1961, in the wake of the 1959 Stabilization Plan (and in the second case also after bilateral agreements reached with destination countries). The region henceforth was handed a demographic blow in the ensuing years, with the effective expulsion of nearly a 40% of the population, particularly young people.

A pre-autonomous government entity in Extremadura (the &quot;Junta Regional de Extremadura&quot;) with jurisdiction over the provinces of Badajoz and Cáceres was created by means of a 1978 law. The draft of the regional Statute of Autonomy began in 1980, the first step toward Extremadura becoming one of the Spanish autonomous communities. The text passed its final hurdle as it was enshrined as Organic Law in 1982. The first election to the Assembly of Extremadura took place in May 1983.

== Government and administration ==
=== Autonomous ===
The Statute of Autonomy of Extremadura (enacted in 1983) is the fundamental organic law regulating the autonomous government, and it establishes the institutions through which the autonomous community exerts its powers:

* Assembly of Extremadura. The following are some of the functions conferred to the legislature: exerting legislative power in the autonomous community, the promotion and control of the Junta of Extremadura, the passing of the regional budget, the designation of senators correspondent to the autonomous community or the control of the media dependent on the regional government. Its members (currently 65) are directly elected through the means of proportional representation and close party lists with an electoral threshold of 5% (the most benign between the total voting percentage and the voting percentage in a particular electoral district) in two electoral districts: Badajoz and Cáceres, corresponding to the two provinces of the region.
* Junta of Extremadura. It is the collegiate body comprised by the regional president, the vice-president and the ministers (&quot;consejeros&quot;) exerting the executive and administrative functions of the regional government.
* President of the Junta of Extremadura. The officeholder is charged with directing and coordinating the action of the Junta of Extremadura, being the highest representative of Extremadura while also holding the ordinary representation of the State in the region. The regional president is elected by the legislature from among its members, needing to command an absolute majority of votes in the first round of investiture or a simple majority of positive votes in successive rounds. The president personally selects the ministers of the Junta.

=== Provincial ===
The government body for each of the provinces is the deputation (&quot;diputación&quot;): the Provincial Deputation of Badajoz and the Provincial Deputation of Cáceres. The members of the plenary of the deputation are indirectly elected from among the municipal councillors based on the results of the municipal elections. In turn, the plenary elects the president of the deputation from among its members.

== Economy ==
The gross domestic product (GDP) of Extremadura was 20 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 1.7% of Spanish economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 20,100 euros or 67% of the EU27 average in the same year. Extremadura was the community with the second lowest GDP per capita in Spain before Melilla.

Export goods (mostly consisting of food and semimanufactures) are primarily sent to the European market, but there has been a growing share of non-EU export destinations throughout the 2010s. Balance of trade is generally positive.

The unemployment rate stood at 17.3% in 2022, significantly lower than in the previous decade.

===Agriculture===
Wild Black Iberian pigs roam in the area and consume acorns from oak groves. These pigs are caught and used for the cured ham dish &quot;jamón ibérico&quot;. The higher the percentage of acorns eaten by the pigs, the more valuable the ham. For example, &quot;jamón ibérico&quot; from pigs whose diet consists of 90% acorns or more can be sold for more than twice as much as ham whose pigs ate on average less than 70% acorns. In the US, &quot;jamón ibérico&quot; directly from Extremadura, with bone, was illegal until around 2005. At that time, enough US restaurants were in demand for the delicacy that Spain decided to export it as boneless, which the US Department of Agriculture&#x27;s health codes would approve (and continue to do).

85 Extremaduran municipalities constitute the jurisdiction of the &quot;Dehesa de Extremadura&quot; Protected Designation of Origin (PDO), which protects &quot;jamones&quot; and &quot;paletas&quot; (hind and front pig legs) originated from Iberian pigs and mixed Iberian/Duroc-Jersey pigs.

As of 2021, Extremadura produces about 98% of the tobacco produced in Spain, also being the leading European producing region. Tobacco production concentrates in La Vera and Campo Arañuelo.

Tomato production (2,122,000 tonnes in 2017) primarily concentrates in the riverbanks of the Guadiana and the Alagón-Árrago.

A large part of the region falls within the scope of the Ribera del Guadiana PDO, which is further divided in the Ribera Alta, Tierra de Barros, Matanegra, Ribera Baja, Montánchez, and Cañamero wine subregions. The PDO protects the wines made of several varieties of black and white grapes.

As of 2021, Extremadura is the second largest rice producing region in Spain, after Andalusia. Due to drought and high water demands from rice fields, non-irrigated rice fields have been favoured since the late 2010s. Together with Murcia, Extremadura is a major producer of paprika, primarily destined to the Spanish market. Peppers are grown in the , consisting of the &quot;comarcas&quot; of La Vera, Campo Arañuelo, Valle del Ambroz and Valle del Alagón. The PDO produced 3,860 tonnes in 2020.

=== Energy ===
About half the value of the regional industrial production belongs to the energy sector. Extremadura presents a huge energy surplus, producing about four times the energy it consumes. This situation has led to the characterization of Extremadura as a potential &quot;colony&quot; of the private electricity companies, which are not taxed in the region and employ a relatively low share of the industrial workforce. The Tagus is dammed in the reservoirs of Alcántara, Torrejón and Valdecañas whereas the Guadiana is dammed in the reservoirs of Cíjara, Puerto Peña, Orellana and Zújar. Due to the orographic conditions, the Tagus is better suited for hydroelectric use than the Guadiana. As of 2021, the region has around 2,193.84 MW of installed hydroelectric power, primarily controlled by Endesa and Iberdrola, with a lesser role of Grupo Pitarch.

The two reactors of the Almaraz Nuclear Power Plant (which were put in operation in 1981 and 1983, respectively) are jointly operated by Endesa, Iberdrola and Naturgy. They generate a power of 1,048.43 MW and 1,044.45 MW.

The region is at the forefront of Spain&#x27;s plans for energy transition and a decarbonisation, thanks to the installation of large solar power plants and the granting of lithium mining licenses. Such prospects sparked criticism and concern regarding how to avoid a &quot;third energy colonisation&quot; after those of the construction of reservoirs for hydroelectric use and the building of nuclear power plants. Two of the largest photovoltaic power plants in Europe are located in the region: Francisco Pizarro (590 MW) in Torrecillas de la Tiesa and Núñez de Balboa (500 MW) in Usagre; both are operated by Iberdrola, which is developing another 6 photovoltaic plants collectively amounting to 1,300 MW. The first solar thermal power plant in the region, Alvarado I, (50 MW) opened in 2009.

A project to build a lithium-ion battery factory participated by Envision in Navalmoral de la Mata was announced in June 2022.

==Population==
As of January 1, 2012, the population of Extremadura is 1,109,367 inhabitants, representing 2.36% of the Spanish population (46,745,807).

The population density is very low——compared to Spain as a whole.

The urban network is dominated by three municipalities between 50,000 and 200,000 inhabitants (Badajoz, Cáceres and Mérida), followed by Plasencia, the Don Benito-Villanueva de la Serena conurbation and Almendralejo. Other municipalities with a population above 10,000 inhabitants include Zafra, Montijo, Villafranca de los Barros, Navalmoral de la Mata and Coria.

The most populous province is that of Badajoz, with a population of 691,715 and a population density of . With an area of , it is the largest province in Spain. 413,766 people live in the province of Cáceres at a density of , having an area of , making it the largest province in Spain after Badajoz.
=== Foreign ===

As of 2020, the largest foreign community is that of Romanian nationals with 8,173 people, followed by Moroccans with 7,400. Portuguese account for 3,188, Chinese for 1,655 and Colombians make up 1,555. The region had a foreign population of 34,667.

===Historical===

The Extremaduran population, according to the 1591 census of the provinces of the Kingdom of Castile, was around 540,000 people, making up 8% of the total population of Spain. No other census was performed until 1717, when 326,358 people were counted as living in Extremadura.

From this period, the population grew steadily until the 1960s (1,379,072 people in 1960). After 1960, emigration to more prosperous regions of Spain and Europe drained the population.

==Administrative divisions==
Extremadura is divided into 383 municipalities. 164 are part of the Province of Badajoz and the other 219 are part of the Province of Cáceres.

* List of municipalities in Cáceres

There are also traditional comarcas in Extremadura, like Las Villuercas and Las Hurdes, but these do not have much official recognition.

==Languages==
The only official language is Spanish (whose local dialects are collectively called Castúo), but other languages and dialects are also spoken. The Fala, a Galician-Portuguese language, is a specially protected language and is spoken in the valley of Jálama. The Extremaduran language, the collective name for a group of vernacular dialects related to Leonese is endangered. Local variants of Portuguese are native to Cedillo and Herrera de Alcántara. Portuguese has also been accounted to be spoken as well by some people (mainly those born before the 1940s) in Olivenza.

Reported phonological distinctive features of the Spanish dialectal variants spoken in the region include instances of (in some areas of the province of Badajoz), loss of intervocalic /d/, j and word-initial h aspiration, r → l substitution, and .

<doc id="68206" wikidata="Q47072" url="?curid=68206" title="Central dogma of molecular biology">
<text>The central dogma of molecular biology deals with the flow of genetic information within a biological system. It is often stated as &quot;DNA makes RNA, and RNA makes protein&quot;, although this is not its original meaning. It was first stated by Francis Crick in 1957, then published in 1958:

He re-stated it in a &quot;Nature&quot; paper published in 1970: &quot;The central dogma of molecular biology deals with the detailed residue-by-residue transfer of sequential information. It states that such information cannot be transferred back from protein to either protein or nucleic acid.&quot;

A second version of the central dogma is popular but incorrect. This is the simplistic DNA → RNA → protein pathway published by James Watson in the first edition of &quot;The Molecular Biology of the Gene&quot; (1965). Watson&#x27;s version differs from Crick&#x27;s because Watson describes a two-step (DNA → RNA and RNA → protein) process as the central dogma. While the dogma as originally stated by Crick remains valid today, Watson&#x27;s version does not.

== Biological sequence information ==
The biopolymers that comprise DNA, RNA and (poly)peptides are linear heteropolymers (i.e.: each monomer is connected to at most two other monomers). The sequence of their monomers effectively encodes information. The transfers of information from one molecule to another are faithful, deterministic transfers, wherein one biopolymer&#x27;s sequence is used as a template for the construction of another biopolymer with a sequence that is entirely dependent on the original biopolymer&#x27;s sequence. When DNA is transcribed to RNA, its complement is paired to it. DNA codes are transferred to RNA codes in a complementary fashion. The encoding of proteins is done in groups of three, known as codons. The standard codon table applies for humans and mammals, but some other lifeforms (including human mitochondria) use different translations.

== General transfers of biological sequential information ==
=== DNA replications ===
In the sense that DNA replication must occur if genetic material is to be provided for the progeny of any cell, whether somatic or reproductive, the copying from DNA to DNA arguably is the fundamental step in information transfer. A complex group of proteins called the replisome performs the replication of the information from the parent strand to the complementary daughter strand.

=== Transcription ===

Transcription is the process by which the information contained in a section of DNA is replicated in the form of a newly assembled piece of messenger RNA (mRNA). Enzymes facilitating the process include RNA polymerase and transcription factors. In eukaryotic cells the primary transcript is pre-mRNA. Pre-mRNA must be processed for translation to proceed. Processing includes the addition of a 5&#x27; cap and a poly-A tail to the pre-mRNA chain, followed by splicing. Alternative splicing occurs when appropriate, increasing the diversity of the proteins that any single mRNA can produce. The product of the entire transcription process (that began with the production of the pre-mRNA chain) is a mature mRNA chain.

=== Translation ===
The mature mRNA finds its way to a ribosome, where it gets translated. In prokaryotic cells, which have no nuclear compartment, the processes of transcription and translation may be linked together without clear separation. In eukaryotic cells, the site of transcription (the cell nucleus) is usually separated from the site of translation (the cytoplasm), so the mRNA must be transported out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where it can be bound by ribosomes. The ribosome reads the mRNA triplet codons, usually beginning with an AUG (adenine−uracil−guanine), or initiator methionine codon downstream of the ribosome binding site. Complexes of initiation factors and elongation factors bring aminoacylated transfer RNAs (tRNAs) into the ribosome-mRNA complex, matching the codon in the mRNA to the anti-codon on the tRNA. Each tRNA bears the appropriate amino acid residue to add to the polypeptide chain being synthesised. As the amino acids get linked into the growing peptide chain, the chain begins folding into the correct conformation. Translation ends with a stop codon which may be a UAA, UGA, or UAG triplet.

The mRNA does not contain all the information for specifying the nature of the mature protein. The nascent polypeptide chain released from the ribosome commonly requires additional processing before the final product emerges. For one thing, the correct folding process is complex and vitally important. For most proteins it requires other chaperone proteins to control the form of the product. Some proteins then excise internal segments from their own peptide chains, splicing the free ends that border the gap; in such processes the inside &quot;discarded&quot; sections are called inteins. Other proteins must be split into multiple sections without splicing. Some polypeptide chains need to be cross-linked, and others must be attached to cofactors such as haem (heme) before they become functional.

== Additional transfers of biological sequential information ==

=== Reverse transcription ===

Reverse transcription is the transfer of information from RNA to DNA (the reverse of normal transcription). This is known to occur in the case of retroviruses, such as HIV, as well as in eukaryotes, in the case of retrotransposons and telomere synthesis.
It is the process by which genetic information from RNA gets transcribed into new DNA. The family of enzymes involved in this process is called Reverse Transcriptase.

=== RNA replication ===
RNA replication is the copying of one RNA to another. Many viruses replicate this way. The enzymes that copy RNA to new RNA, called RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, are also found in many eukaryotes where they are involved in RNA silencing.

RNA editing, in which an RNA sequence is altered by a complex of proteins and a &quot;guide RNA&quot;, could also be seen as an RNA-to-RNA transfer.

== Activities unrelated to the central dogma ==

The central dogma of molecular biology states that once sequential information has passed from nucleic acid to protein it cannot flow back from protein to nucleic acid. Some people believe that the following activities conflict with the central dogma.

=== Post-translational modification ===
After protein amino acid sequences have been translated from nucleic acid chains, they can be edited by appropriate enzymes. This is a form of protein affecting protein sequence not protein transferring information to nucleic acid. 

=== Nonribosomal peptide synthesis ===
Some proteins are synthesized by nonribosomal peptide synthetases, which can be big protein complexes, each specializing in synthesizing only one type of peptide. Nonribosomal peptides often have cyclic and/or branched structures and can contain non-proteinogenic amino acids - both of these factors differentiate them from ribosome synthesized proteins. An example of nonribosomal peptides are some of the antibiotics.

=== Inteins ===
An intein is a &quot;parasitic&quot; segment of a protein that is able to excise itself from the chain of amino acids as they emerge from the ribosome and rejoin the remaining portions with a peptide bond in such a manner that the main protein &quot;backbone&quot; does not fall apart. This is a case of a protein changing its own primary sequence from the sequence originally encoded by the DNA of a gene. Additionally, most inteins contain a homing endonuclease or HEG domain which is capable of finding a copy of the parent gene that does not include the intein nucleotide sequence. On contact with the intein-free copy, the HEG domain initiates the DNA double-stranded break repair mechanism. This process causes the intein sequence to be copied from the original source gene to the intein-free gene. This is an example of protein directly editing DNA sequence, as well as increasing the sequence&#x27;s heritable propagation.

=== Prions ===
Prions are proteins of particular amino acid sequences in particular conformations. They propagate themselves in host cells by making conformational changes in other molecules of protein with the same amino acid sequence, but with a different conformation that is functionally important or detrimental to the organism. Once the protein has been transconformed to the prion folding it changes function. In turn it can convey information into new cells and reconfigure more functional molecules of that sequence into the alternate prion form. In some types of prion in fungi this change is continuous and direct; the information flow is Protein → Protein.

Some scientists such as Alain E. Bussard and Eugene Koonin have argued that prion-mediated inheritance violates the central dogma of molecular biology. However, Rosalind Ridley in &quot;Molecular Pathology of the Prions&quot; (2001) has written that &quot;The prion hypothesis is not heretical to the central dogma of molecular biology—that the information necessary to manufacture proteins is encoded in the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acid—because it does not claim that proteins replicate. Rather, it claims that there is a source of information within protein molecules that contributes to their biological function, and that this information can be passed on to other molecules.&quot;

== Use of the term &quot;dogma&quot; ==

In his autobiography, &quot;What Mad Pursuit&quot;, Crick wrote about his choice of the word &quot;dogma&quot; and some of the problems it caused him:
&quot;I called this idea the central dogma, for two reasons, I suspect. I had already used the obvious word hypothesis in the sequence hypothesis, and in addition I wanted to suggest that this new assumption was more central and more powerful. ... As it turned out, the use of the word dogma caused almost more trouble than it was worth. Many years later Jacques Monod pointed out to me that I did not appear to understand the correct use of the word dogma, which is a belief &quot;that cannot be doubted&quot;. I did apprehend this in a vague sort of way but since I thought that &quot;all&quot; religious beliefs were without foundation, I used the word the way I myself thought about it, not as most of the world does, and simply applied it to a grand hypothesis that, however plausible, had little direct experimental support.&quot;
Similarly, Horace Freeland Judson records in &quot;The Eighth Day of Creation&quot;:

&quot;My mind was, that a dogma was an idea for which there was &quot;no reasonable evidence&quot;. You see?!&quot; And Crick gave a roar of delight. &quot;I just didn&#x27;t &quot;know&quot; what dogma &quot;meant&quot;. And I could just as well have called it the &#x27;Central Hypothesis,&#x27; or — you know. Which is what I meant to say. Dogma was just a catch phrase.&quot;

== Comparison with the Weismann barrier ==

The Weismann barrier, proposed by August Weismann in 1892, distinguishes between the &quot;immortal&quot; germ cell lineages (the germ plasm) which produce gametes and the &quot;disposable&quot; somatic cells. Hereditary information moves only from germline cells to somatic cells (that is, somatic mutations are not inherited). This, before the discovery of the role or structure of DNA, does not predict the central dogma, but does anticipate its gene-centric view of life, albeit in non-molecular terms.

<text>Ayrshire (, ) is a historic county and registration county, in south-west Scotland, located on the shores of the Firth of Clyde. The lieutenancy area of Ayrshire and Arran covers the entirety of the historic county as well as the island of Arran, formerly part of the historic county of Buteshire. Its principal towns include Ayr, Kilmarnock and Irvine and it borders the counties of Renfrewshire and Lanarkshire to the north-east, Dumfriesshire to the south-east, and Kirkcudbrightshire and Wigtownshire to the south. Like many other counties of Scotland, it currently has no administrative function, instead being sub-divided into the council areas of East Ayrshire, North Ayrshire and South Ayrshire. It has a population of approximately 366,800.

The electoral and valuation area named Ayrshire covers the three council areas of East Ayrshire, North Ayrshire and South Ayrshire, therefore covering the whole historic county of Ayrshire but also including the Isle of Arran, Great Cumbrae and Little Cumbrae from the historic county of Buteshire. The three council areas together also form the &quot;Ayrshire and Arran&quot; lieutenancy area.

The largest settlement in Ayrshire by population is Kilmarnock, closely followed by Ayr, the county town.

==Geography==
Ayrshire is roughly crescent-shaped and is a predominantly flat county with areas of low hills; it forms part of the Southern Uplands geographic region of Scotland. The north of the county contains the main towns and bulk of the population. East of Largs can be found the Renfrewshire Heights, which continue south to the hill-country around Blae Loch.

Southern Ayrshire shares with the Galloway counties some rugged hill country known as the Galloway Hills. These hills lie to the west of the A713 (Ayr to Castle Douglas road) and they run south from the Loch Doon area almost to the Solway Firth. To the east of this route through the hills lie the Carsphairn and Scaur Hills which lie to the south east of Dalmellington and south of New Cumnock. Glen Afton runs deep into these hills.

Ayrshire is one of the most agriculturally fertile regions of Scotland. Potatoes are grown in fields near the coast, using seaweed-based fertiliser, and in addition the region produces pork products, other root vegetables, and cattle (see below); and summer berries such as strawberries are grown abundantly.

A number of small islands in the Firth of Clyde are part of Ayrshire, the chief of these being Horse Isle, Lady Isle and Ailsa Craig.

===Rivers===
The main rivers flowing to the Clyde coast are, from north to south, the following:

*River Garnock
*River Irvine
*River Ayr
*River Doon
*River Girvan
*River Stinchar


==History==
The area that today forms Ayrshire was part of the area south of the Antonine Wall which was briefly occupied by the Romans during the reign of Emperor Antoninus Pius (see: Roman Britain#Occupation and retreat from southern Scotland). It was inhabited by the Damnonii, who are presumed to have been Britons. Later, it formed part of the British Kingdom of Strathclyde, which was incorporated into the Kingdom of Scotland during the 11th century. In 1263, the Scots successfully drove off the Norwegian &quot;leidang&quot;-army in a skirmish known as the Battle of Largs.
A notable historic building in Ayrshire is Turnberry Castle, which dates from the 13th century or earlier, and which may have been the birthplace of Robert the Bruce.

The historic shire or sheriffdom of Ayr was divided into three districts or &quot;bailieries&quot; which later made up the county of Ayrshire. The three districts were:
*Carrick in the south. It was situated between the Doon and the wild district of Galloway in the adjoining Stewartries, an area that was little else than a vast tract of hills and mosses.
*Kyle in the centre, which included the royal burgh of Ayr, occupied the central district between the River Irvine in the north, and the River Doon in the south and south-west, an area that is quite hilly inland. It was subdivided into &quot;Kyle Stewart&quot;, (sometimes called &quot;Stewart Kyle&quot; or &quot;Walter&#x27;s Kyle&quot;) and &quot;King&#x27;s Kyle,&quot; the former embracing the country between the Irvine and the River Ayr; and the latter, the triangular portion between the Ayr and the Doon, which is honoured as the birthplace and youthful home of Robert Burns.
*Cunninghame in the north which included the royal burgh of Irvine was that part of the county which lay north of the Irvine water, and was in an area that is generally level and fertile.

The area used to be heavily industrialised, with steel making, coal mining and in Kilmarnock numerous examples of production-line manufacturing, most famously Johnnie Walker whisky. In more recent history, Digital Equipment had a large manufacturing plant near Ayr from about 1976 until the company was taken over by Compaq in 1998. Some supplier companies grew up to service this site and the more distant IBM plant at Greenock in Renfrewshire. Scotland&#x27;s aviation industry has long been based in and around Prestwick and its international airport, and although aircraft manufacture ceased at the former British Aerospace plant in 1998, a significant number of aviation companies are still based on the Prestwick site. However, unemployment in the region (excluding the more rural South Ayrshire) is above the national average.

Throughout the 17th century, huge numbers of people from Ayrshire moved to Ulster, the northern province in Ireland, as part of the Plantation of Ulster, many of them with surnames such as Burns, Hamilton, Morrow, Stewart, Flanagan, Kennedy and Cunningham. Today, the Ulster Scots dialect is largely an offshoot of the version of Lowland Scots spoken in Ayrshire. The Ulster Scots dialect is still widely spoken throughout County Antrim and in parts of County Down and County Londonderry, as well as still being widely spoken in West Tír Eoghain and parts of County Donegal (chiefly East Donegal and Inishowen).

==Local government==

Commissioners of Supply were created in 1667 for each shire, and formed the main administrative body for the area until county councils were created in 1890 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889. The 1889 act also led to a review of boundaries of many of Scotland&#x27;s counties; in the case of Ayrshire the two parishes of Beith and Dunlop, which had both straddled Ayrshire and Renfrewshire, were brought entirely within Ayrshire. The burghs of Ayr and Kilmarnock were both excluded from the area controlled by the county council when it was created in 1890, being deemed capable of running their own services.

In 1930 the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1929 was implemented. This brought Ayr and Kilmarnock under the control of the county council, and re-designated all burghs as either large burghs or small burghs. Ayr and Kilmarnock were both classed as large burghs, allowing them to retain control of many functions, whilst the county&#x27;s other burghs were all classed as small burghs, ceding many functions to the county council. The 1929 act also abolished the parish councils. In Ayrshire in excess of 30 parishes were consolidated into ten district councils. The District Councils were Ayr, Cumnock, Dalmellington, Girvan, Irvine, Kilbirnie, Kilmarnock, Maybole, Troon and Saltcoats. Ayrshire County Council was based at County Buildings in Wellington Square in Ayr.

In May 1975 the county council was abolished and its functions were transferred to Strathclyde Regional Council. The county area was divided between four new districts within the two-tier Strathclyde region: Cumnock and Doon Valley, Cunninghame, Kilmarnock and Loudoun and Kyle and Carrick. The Cunninghame district included the Isle of Arran, Great Cumbrae and Little Cumbrae, which had until then been administered as part of the County of Bute. For lieutenancy purposes, the last lord-lieutenant of the county of Ayrshire was made lord-lieutenant for the combined area of the four districts when the reforms came into effect in 1975, with the lieutenancy area being renamed Ayrshire and Arran in 1996.

In 1996 the two-tier system of regions and districts was abolished and Ayrshire was divided between the unitary council areas of East Ayrshire (covering the area of the former Kilmarnock &amp; Loudoun District and Cumnock &amp; Doon Valley District), North Ayrshire (covering the area of the former Cunninghame District Council) and South Ayrshire (covering the area of the former Kyle and Carrick District).

The boundaries of the historic county of Ayrshire are still used for some limited official purposes connected with land registration, being a registration county.

== Parliamentary constituencies ==
There was an Ayrshire constituency of the House of Commons of the Parliament of Great Britain from 1708 to 1801 and of the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1801 until 1868, when the constituency was divided into Ayrshire North and Ayrshire South.

During the whole of the 1708 to 1868 period, and until 1950, the burghs of Ayr and Irvine were parliamentary burghs, represented as components of Ayr Burghs. In 1832 Kilmarnock became a parliamentary burgh, to be represented as a component of Kilmarnock Burghs until 1918. Ayr Burghs and Kilmarnock Burghs were districts of burghs, and quite different in character from later Ayr and Kilmarnock constituencies.

From 1918 to 1983 Ayrshire and Buteshire were treated as if a single area for purposes of parliamentary representation, with their combined area being divided into different constituencies at different times. Scottish local government counties were abolished in 1975, in favour of regions and districts, but the next reform of constituency boundaries was not until 1983.

Constituencies covering Ayrshire may be listed by periods as below, but the story is somewhat more complicated than the lists may imply: until 1918, Ayr Burghs and Kilmarnock Burghs included burghs lying outside both Ayrshire and Buteshire; a particular constituency name may represent different boundaries in different periods; in 1974, there were boundary changes without the creation of any new constituency names.

==Transport==
A number of railway lines connect the towns of northern Ayrshire to each other and also to Glasgow, as well as south to Stranraer and south-east to Dumfries.

Ferries link Ayrshire to the islands of Arran and Great Cumbrae in Buteshire.

Glasgow Prestwick International Airport, serving Glasgow and the west of Scotland more generally, is located away from Glasgow in Ayrshire; it provides various passenger flights to Spain, Portugal, Italy and Poland. The name &quot;Glasgow&quot; was added in front of Prestwick as per American military airport naming conventions, as the airport was in the past oft-used as a stopover by US military personnel on their way to and from military bases in Germany. Moreover, it is known in rock history as the only place in Britain visited by Elvis Presley, on his way home from army service in Germany in 1960.

<text>Slash&#x27;EM (Super Lotsa Added Stuff Hack – Extended Magic) is a variant of the roguelike game &quot;NetHack&quot; that offers extra features, monsters, and items. Several of its novel features, such as the Monk class, &quot;conducts&quot; (voluntary challenges), and the Sokoban levels, have been reincorporated into &quot;NetHack&quot;.

The main dungeon in &quot;Slash&#x27;EM&quot; is much larger than in &quot;NetHack&quot;, introducing special levels such as the Sunless Sea, where a magic lamp lies, and the Guild of Disgruntled Adventurers, populated by &quot;player monsters&quot; (archaeologists, barbarians, and other playable Slash&#x27;EM classes).

Compared to &quot;NetHack&quot;, Gehennom comprises fewer levels, though it contains a special level for each demon lord and prince, including those who only appear when summoned in &quot;NetHack&quot;. These alterations serve to reduce player tedium that results from trekking through repetitive maze levels.

==Development==
Warren Cheung began &quot;Slash&#x27;EM&quot; development in 1997, basing it on a &quot;NetHack&quot; variant, &quot;Slash&quot;.

==Compatible graphical interfaces==
Enhanced graphical options also exist, such as the isometric perspective of &quot;Vulture&quot;, or the three-dimensional rendering that &quot;noegnud&quot; offers. &quot;Vulture&quot; (previously &quot;Vulture&#x27;s Claw&quot;) is a fork of the now-defunct &quot;Falcon&#x27;s Eye&quot; project. &quot;Vulture&quot; adds additional graphics, sounds, bugfixes and performance enhancements and is under active development.

<text>Julius O&#x27;Riordan (born 26 October 1966), better known by his stage name Judge Jules, is a British dance music DJ, record producer and entertainment lawyer. He is known for his DJ activities, music production and long-running radio show which achieved global success. He was voted best DJ in the world by &quot;DJ Mag&quot; in 1995.

==Education==
O&#x27;Riordan was educated at Highgate Wood Secondary School, a state school in Highgate Wood in North London and at University College School, an independent school for boys in Hampstead (also in North London), followed by the London School of Economics (LSE), where he earned a degree in law. During his time at university, O&#x27;Riordan started hosting small parties where he was the DJ and earned the nickname &quot;Judge Jules&quot; due to his field of study.

==DJ career and radio shows==
O&#x27;Riordan became a professional DJ in 1987. As a young DJ he became known for his interpretation of beat at the Club Valentino venue in Colchester, Essex, drawing capacity attendance. He was quickly hired by the then-pirate radio station Kiss.

He began his show with Radio 1 in October 1997. When he first arrived, the show went out between 17:00 and 19:00 on Saturday evenings, ahead of Danny Rampling&#x27;s show. From 31 July 2004, after the departure of Seb Fontaine from the station, his show was moved to 19:00 – 21:00 on Saturday nights, ahead of Tim Westwood. The show was advertised as &quot;The UK&#x27;s Saturday Warmup&quot;, or &quot;The Weekend Warm-Up&quot;. The show kept this slot until September 2007.

During those years, his music policy ranged from playing commercial to underground tracks, and much in between. The first segment of the show was taken by the Cut-Up Boys, who did a five or ten-minute mix featuring several dance tracks and a cappella tracks playing simultaneously. The rest of the first hour was generally taken up by house music and the second hour featured trance music, although if they were broadcasting the show outside the studio, the music might vary.

In September 2007, the show was moved to 01:00 – 03:00 on Saturday mornings. Because of his DJ commitments on Friday evenings, it was now pre-recorded instead of being broadcast live. From September 2008, the show was moved forward to 23:00 – 01:00 on Friday evening. The reason for the move was the departure of Dave Pearce, whose Dance Anthems show was moved to BBC Radio 6 Music. His show attracted a wide audience from around the world due to Radio 1&#x27;s online presence and the Sirius Satellite Radio network in the United States and Canada. Through the radio show, he was responsible for launching many popular trance tunes and acts in the UK, and was a pioneer for commercial contemporary dance music. Many people send their unreleased tracks to him: according to his own website, during the time when his show was being produced, he received between 250 and 300 promos per week. His Radio 1 show was produced by independent production company Somethin&#x27; Else.

O&#x27;Riordan was also a substitute presenter for the long-running Radio 1 weekend show &quot;The Essential Mix&quot;, which included hosting the Benga mix in 2008. He presented his last show on Radio 1 on 30 March 2012.

He also has an internationally syndicated radio show called &quot;The Global Warm Up&quot; (also produced by Somethin&#x27; Else) which can be heard across the US, Russia, Europe (including RTÉ 2fm) and the Middle East or via podcast. As of May 2019, there have been 792 episodes of the Global Warm Up.

Alongside his full-time job as an entertainment lawyer, in 2019, O&#x27;Riordan still tours frequently as a DJ and continues to play at notable venues such as Zero Gravity Dubai and Ministry of Sound, and at events such as Luminosity Beach Festival, Creamfields and Dreamstate USA.

== Judge Jules: Live ==
In March 2019, O&#x27;Riordan announced his &#x27;Judge Jules: Live&#x27; project which features O&#x27;Riordan playing dance classics alongside a 10-piece jazz band and two vocalists. The show debuted at The Plug in Sheffield on Saturday 22 March, with four further dates announced in London, Manchester, Birmingham and Bristol. The live project differs heavily from other comparable shows because the tracks are all re-written for the band to play from the ground up in a different style, specifically for this show.

==Journalism==
O&#x27;Riordan was a contributor to the UK-based black music magazine &quot;Soul Underground&quot; between 1988 and 1990. He contributed both as &#x27;Judge Jules&#x27; and as &#x27;The Dark Knight&#x27;, using the anonymity of this identity to provide inside information on the music scene.

==Legal work==
O&#x27;Riordan was an Associate in the Music Group at the law firm Sheridans from 2012 to 2018. In March 2018, he joined Sound Advice LLP as an entertainment lawyer. Jules&#x27; legal expertise centres around the entertainment areas in which he has over 30 years experience.

In 2015, O&#x27;Riordan wrote a series of six articles for the &#x27;Industry Insider&#x27; section of &quot;Mixmag&quot; which outlined basic legal advice for a number of music industry topics, including management, publishing and recording contracts.

==Judgement Ibiza==

O&#x27;Riordan had a regular club night in Ibiza that started out as Judgement Sundays at Eden night club; in 2013 this became Judgement Fridays. In 2014, Eden nightclub was rebranded &quot;Gatecrasher&quot; and Judgement Fridays moved over the road to Es Paradis and combined with the Fiesta del Agua (water party). In 2015, the &quot;Gatecrasher&quot; brand had disappeared from Eden and the nightclub was re-launched with a new logo; this also saw the return of O&#x27;Riordan&#x27;s night, now branded &quot;Judgement&quot;. Previously advertised as &quot;San Antonio&#x27;s busiest night&quot; it was later advertised as &quot;San Antonio&#x27;s most legendary night&quot;. The night ran for most of the summer season, generally starting in June and running through mid September, and as well as DJing at this night he also promoted it.

In 2016, Judgement returned to Eden for its 16th season, taking place every Friday from June to September. In 2017, Judgement took a break from Ibiza, but O&#x27;Riordan still played at various events including Acid 88/89 at Sankeys Ibiza. Judgement returned to Ibiza in September 2018 for a one-off reunion show at Eden featuring Marco V alongside O&#x27;Riordan. In 2019 O&#x27;Riordan returned once again to Judgement for a one-off workers&#x27; reunion in October also at Eden, alongside Dermot C, Dirty Rotten DJs and Tristan Ingram and Vicky Devine.

==Recorded works==
O&#x27;Riordan&#x27;s wife provided vocals for the group Angelic, consisting of O&#x27;Riordan and Darren Tate, which had two hits, &quot;It&#x27;s My Turn&quot; in 2000 and &quot;Can&#x27;t Keep Me Silent&quot; in 2001. In 2005, she appeared on the track &quot;Without Love&quot;, which was by O&#x27;Riordan himself. This track was eventually released, with remixes, on the Maelstrom Records label in 2007. O&#x27;Riordan has also released two albums via this label, &quot;Proven Worldwide&quot; in 2006 and &quot;Bring The Noise&quot; in 2009. In 2012, O&#x27;Riordan signed with Paul Van Dyk&#x27;s label VANDIT Records, releasing &quot;The Attack&quot; and &quot;Give Me A Reason&quot;. Elsewhere, he has collaborated several times with Paul Masterson under the Hi-Gate name.

In 2016, O&#x27;Riordan launched his record label, Judgement Recordings. The label serves as an outlet for his own original productions, as well as a platform for O&#x27;Riordan to push new and upcoming talent. The first release was &#x27;Burn in the Sun&#x27; with Richard Bedford in June 2016. In December 2016, the label released a remixed edition of Hi-Gate&#x27;s &#x27;Caned &amp; Unable&#x27; and &#x27;I Can Hear Voices&#x27;.

In August 2017, O&#x27;Riordan released an original Loopmasters sample pack called &quot;Judge Jules – Essential Big Room House&quot;.

==Involvement in &#x27;Classical Dance&#x27; events==
O&#x27;Riordan has been heavily involved in at least ten of the popular &quot;classical&quot; dance events, involving orchestras playing dance music. In March 2017, he helped curate the Club Class Classical show. In June 2017, he played at the Cream Classical show. He played at the Colours Classical events in September 2017 and March 2018. He played the Gatecrasher Classical events in October 2017, June 2018, August 2018 and February 2019. In January 2019, he played at and helped curate the Ministry of Sound Classical event.

==TV appearances==

O&#x27;Riordan appeared on the &quot;Richard &amp; Judy&quot; chat show in 2003 with his counterpart Paul Masterson and singer/DJ Boy George, promoting their Hi-Gate album, on which Boy George made a cameo singing contribution.

O&#x27;Riordan appeared on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; show (2000) with Masterson, to perform the single &quot;Pitchin&#x27;&quot;, from their album &quot;Hi-Gate&quot;. O&#x27;Riordan also appeared in a UK series called &quot;Superstar DJs&quot;, and a series called &quot;Ibiza Uncovered&quot;. He had his own short series &quot;Spin Cities&quot; on Play UK.

O&#x27;Riordan appeared on Channel Five&#x27;s &quot;Fifth Gear&quot; in 2005 and 2009. In 2005 he was filmed while at the Global Gathering dance music festival where he was interviewed in a Bentley, and again by the same presenter in 2009 whilst being chauffeured in an Aston Martin to a gig in Bournemouth. He also appeared on Channel Five&#x27;s &quot;The Gadget Show&quot;, reviewing DJ equipment including a remote handheld DJing device known as a &quot;pacemaker&quot;.

In 2019 he appeared in Series 4 of the BBC&#x27;s Celebrity MasterChef competition. He exited at the fourth round of the show.

==Charity work==
In 2009 O&#x27;Riordan started supporting the UK charity Breakthrough Breast Cancer, joining the Breakthrough Running Club as the club DJ. In 2022, O&#x27;Riordan played a show at The Pioneer Club in St Albans in aid of Herts Young Homeless.

==Clothing range==
In 2008 O&#x27;Riordan worked with designers to produce his own clothing range &#x27;Heroes and Villains&#x27;.

<text>Ximian, Inc. (previously called Helix Code and originally named International Gnome Support) was an American company that developed, sold and supported application software for Linux and Unix based on the GNOME platform. It was founded by Miguel de Icaza and Nat Friedman in 1999 and was bought by Novell in 2003. Novell continued to develop Ximian&#x27;s original products, while adding support for its own GroupWise and ZENworks software.

==History==
Miguel de Icaza had a job interview at Microsoft in 1997 shortly before he started the GNOME project. At Microsoft he met Nat Friedman, who worked there as an intern. Afterwards they became good friends. In April 1999 Friedman came up with the idea to create a company to work on GNOME. The company was founded on 19 October 1999 as International GNOME Support, but its name was changed to Helix Code later. Because that name could not be trademarked the name was changed to Ximian on 10 January 2001.

Nat Friedman was the CEO of Ximian from its founding to 2001 when Ximian brought in David Patrick as CEO and President. Friedman became Vice President of Product Management. The company&#x27;s business model was based on providing a mix of free and proprietary software, solutions and services. Ximian was a founding member of the GNOME Foundation and the Desktop Linux Consortium.

Ximian was acquired by Novell on 4 August 2003 to improve its offerings of Linux for the enterprise. Novell was in turn acquired by The Attachmate Group on 27 April 2011. In May 2011 The Attachmate Group laid off all its US staff working on Mono, which included De Icaza. He and Friedman then founded Xamarin on 16 May 2011, a new company to continue the development of Mono. On 24 February 2016, Microsoft announced that they had signed an agreement to acquire Xamarin.

==Products==
Ximian both developed new products and &quot;polished&quot; existing free software projects to provide more consistent operation. These projects were packaged into its Ximian Desktop product — a range of integrated applications intended to provide all the tools a typical business user might require. So-called &quot;Ximianized&quot; versions of GNOME, OpenOffice.org, and Gaim were released, along with the following completely new products:

* Ximian Evolution
* Ximian Connector
* Red Carpet
* Bonobo
* Mono

<text>OpenOffice.org (OOo), commonly known as OpenOffice, is a discontinued open-source office suite. Active successor projects include LibreOffice (the most actively developed) and Collabora Online, with Apache OpenOffice being considered mostly dormant since at least 2015.

OpenOffice was an open-sourced version of the earlier StarOffice, which Sun Microsystems acquired in 1999 for internal use. Sun open-sourced the OpenOffice suite in July 2000 as a competitor to Microsoft Office, releasing version 1.0 on 1 May 2002.

OpenOffice included a word processor (Writer), a spreadsheet (Calc), a presentation application (Impress), a drawing application (Draw), a formula editor (Math), and a database management application (Base). Its default file format was the OpenDocument Format (ODF), an ISO/IEC standard, which originated with OpenOffice.org. It could also read a wide variety of other file formats, with particular attention to those from Microsoft Office. OpenOffice.org was primarily developed for Linux, Microsoft Windows and Solaris, and later for OS X, with ports to other operating systems. It was distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 3 (LGPL); early versions were also available under the Sun Industry Standards Source License (SISSL).

In 2011, Oracle Corporation, the then-owner of Sun, announced that it would no longer offer a commercial version of the suite and donated the project to the Apache Foundation. Apache renamed the software Apache OpenOffice.

== History ==

OpenOffice.org originated as StarOffice, a proprietary office suite developed by German company Star Division from 1985 on. In August 1999, Star Division was acquired by Sun Microsystems for US$59.5 million, as it was supposedly cheaper than licensing Microsoft Office for 42,000 staff.

On 19 July 2000 at OSCON, Sun Microsystems announced it would make the source code of StarOffice available for download with the intention of building an open-source development community around the software and of providing a free and open alternative to Microsoft Office. The new project was known as OpenOffice.org, and the code was released as open source on 13 October 2000. The first public preview release was Milestone Build 638c, released in October 2001 (which quickly achieved 1 million downloads); the final release of OpenOffice.org 1.0 was on 1 May 2002.

OpenOffice.org became the standard office suite on many Linux distros and spawned many derivative versions. It quickly became noteworthy competition to Microsoft Office, achieving 14% penetration in the large enterprise market by 2004.

The OpenOffice.org XML file format – XML in a ZIP archive, easily machine-processable – was intended by Sun to become a standard interchange format for office documents, to replace the different binary formats for each application that had been usual until then. Sun submitted the format to the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS) in 2002 and it was adapted to form the OpenDocument standard in 2005, which was ratified as ISO 26300 in 2006. It was made OpenOffice.org&#x27;s native format from version 2 on. Many governments and other organisations adopted OpenDocument, particularly given there was a free implementation of it readily available.

Development of OpenOffice.org was sponsored primarily by Sun Microsystems, which used the code as the basis for subsequent versions of StarOffice. Developers who wished to contribute code were required to sign a Contributor Agreement granting joint ownership of any contributions to Sun (and then Oracle), in support of the StarOffice business model. This was controversial for many years. An alternative Public Documentation Licence (PDL) was also offered for documentation not intended for inclusion or integration into the project code base.

After acquiring Sun in January 2010, Oracle Corporation continued developing OpenOffice.org and StarOffice, which it renamed Oracle Open Office, though with a reduction in assigned developers. Oracle&#x27;s lack of activity on or visible commitment to OpenOffice.org had also been noted by industry observers. In September 2010, the majority of outside OpenOffice.org developers left the project, due to concerns over Sun and then Oracle&#x27;s management of the project and Oracle&#x27;s handling of its open source portfolio in general, to form The Document Foundation (TDF). TDF released the fork LibreOffice in January 2011, which most Linux distributions soon moved to. In April 2011, Oracle stopped development of OpenOffice.org and fired the remaining Star Division development team. Its reasons for doing so were not disclosed; some speculate that it was due to the loss of mindshare with much of the community moving to LibreOffice while others suggest it was a commercial decision.

In June 2011, Oracle contributed the trademarks to the Apache Software Foundation. It also contributed Oracle-owned code to Apache for relicensing under the Apache License, at the suggestion of IBM (to whom Oracle had contractual obligations concerning the code), as IBM did not want the code put under a copyleft license. This code drop formed the basis for the Apache OpenOffice project.

=== Governance ===
During Sun&#x27;s sponsorship, the OpenOffice.org project was governed by the &quot;Community Council&quot;, comprising OpenOffice.org community members. The Community Council suggested project goals and coordinated with producers of derivatives on long-term development planning issues.

Both Sun and Oracle are claimed to have made decisions without consulting the Council or in contravention to the council&#x27;s recommendations, leading to the majority of outside developers leaving for LibreOffice. Oracle demanded in October 2010 that all Council members involved with the Document Foundation step down, leaving the Community Council composed only of Oracle employees.

=== Naming ===
The project and software were informally referred to as &quot;OpenOffice&quot; since the Sun release, but since this term is a trademark held by Open Office Automatisering in Benelux since 1999, &quot;OpenOffice.org&quot; was its formal name.

Due to a similar trademark issue (a Rio de Janeiro company that owned that trademark in Brazil), the Brazilian Portuguese version of the suite was distributed under the name BrOffice.org from 2004, with BrOffice.Org being the name of the associated local nonprofit from 2006. (BrOffice.org moved to LibreOffice in December 2010.)

== Features ==
OpenOffice.org 1.0 was launched under the following mission statement:
=== Components ===
The suite contained no personal information manager, email client or calendar application analogous to Microsoft Outlook, despite one having been present in StarOffice 5.2. Such functionality was frequently requested. The OpenOffice.org Groupware project, intended to replace Outlook and Microsoft Exchange Server, spun off in 2003 as OpenGroupware.org, which is now SOGo. The project considered bundling Mozilla Thunderbird and Mozilla Lightning for OpenOffice.org 3.0.

=== Supported operating systems ===
The last version, 3.4 Beta 1, was available for IA-32 versions of Windows 2000 Service Pack 2 or later, Linux (IA-32 and x64), Solaris and OS X 10.4 or later, and the SPARC version of Solaris.

The latest versions of OpenOffice.org on other operating systems were:
* IRIX (MIPS IV): v1.0.3
* Linux 2.2: v2.x
* Linux 2.4: v3.3.x
* Mac OS X v10.2: v1.1.2
* Mac OS X v10.3: v2.1
* Mac OS X v10.4-Mac OS X v10.6: v4.0
* Windows 95: v1.1.5
* Windows NT 4.0 SP6: v1.1.x
* Windows 98 and Windows ME: v2.4.3
* Windows 2000 Service Pack 2 or later: v3.3.x
* Solaris 7: 1.0.x
* Solaris 8, Solaris 9: v2.x
* Solaris 10: v3.4 Beta 1

=== Fonts ===
OpenOffice.org included OpenSymbol, DejaVu, the Liberation fonts (from 2.4) and the Gentium fonts (from 3.2). Versions up to 2.3 included the Bitstream Vera fonts. OpenOffice.org also used the default fonts of the running operating system.

&quot;Fontwork&quot; is a feature that allows users to create stylized text with special effects differing from ordinary text with the added features of gradient colour fills, shaping, letter height, and character spacing. It is similar to WordArt used by Microsoft Word. When OpenOffice.org saved documents in Microsoft Office file format, all Fontwork was converted into WordArt.

=== Extensions ===
From version 2.0.4, OpenOffice.org supported third-party extensions. As of April 2011, the OpenOffice Extension Repository listed more than 650 extensions. Another list was maintained by the Free Software Foundation.

=== OpenOffice Basic ===
OpenOffice.org included OpenOffice Basic, a programming language similar to Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). OpenOffice Basic was available in Writer, Calc and Base. OpenOffice.org also had some Microsoft VBA macro support.

=== Connectivity ===
OpenOffice.org could interact with databases (local or remote) using ODBC (Open Database Connectivity), JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) or SDBC (StarOffice Database Connectivity).

== File formats ==
From Version 2.0 onward, OpenOffice.org used ISO/IEC 26300:2006 OpenDocument as its native format. Versions 2.0–2.3.0 default to the ODF 1.0 file format; versions 2.3.1–2.4.3 default to ODF 1.1; versions 3.0 onward default to ODF 1.2.

OpenOffice.org 1 used OpenOffice.org XML as its native format. This was contributed to OASIS and OpenDocument was developed from it.

OpenOffice.org also claimed support for the following formats:

== Development ==
OpenOffice.org converted all external formats to and from an internal XML representation.

The OpenOffice.org API was based on a component technology known as Universal Network Objects (UNO). It consisted of a wide range of interfaces defined in a CORBA-like interface description language.

=== Native desktop integration ===
OpenOffice.org 1.0 was criticized for not having the look and feel of applications developed natively for the platforms on which it runs. Starting with version 2.0, OpenOffice.org used native widget toolkit, icons, and font-rendering libraries on GNOME, KDE and Windows.

The issue had been particularly pronounced on Mac OS X. Early versions of OpenOffice.org required the installation of X11.app or XDarwin (though the NeoOffice port supplied a native interface). Versions since 3.0 ran natively using Apple&#x27;s Aqua GUI.

=== Use of Java ===
Although originally written in C++, OpenOffice.org became increasingly reliant on the Java Runtime Environment, even including a bundled JVM. OpenOffice.org was criticized by the Free Software Foundation for its increasing dependency on Java, which was not free software.

The issue came to the fore in May 2005, when Richard Stallman appeared to call for a fork of the application in a posting on the Free Software Foundation website. OpenOffice.org adopted a development guideline that future versions of OpenOffice.org would run on free implementations of Java and fixed the issues which previously prevented OpenOffice.org 2.0 from using free-software Java implementations.

On 13 November 2006, Sun committed to releasing Java under the GNU General Public License and had released a free software Java, OpenJDK, by May 2007.

=== Security ===
In 2006, Lt. Col. Eric Filiol of the Laboratoire de Virologie et de Cryptologie de l&#x27;ESAT demonstrated security weaknesses, in particular within macros. In 2006, Kaspersky Lab demonstrated a proof of concept virus, &quot;Stardust&quot;, for OpenOffice.org. This showed OpenOffice.org viruses are possible, but there is no known virus &quot;in the wild&quot;.

As of October 2011, Secunia reported no known unpatched security flaws for the software. A vulnerability in the inherited OpenOffice.org codebase was found and fixed in LibreOffice in October 2011 and Apache OpenOffice in May 2012.

=== Version history ===
==== OpenOffice.org 1 ====

The preview, Milestone 638c, was released October 2001. OpenOffice.org 1.0 was released under both the LGPL and the SISSL for Windows, Linux and Solaris on 1 May 2002. The version for Mac OS X (with X11 interface) was released on 23 June 2003.

OpenOffice.org 1.1 introduced One-click Export to PDF, Export presentations to Flash (.SWF) and macro recording. It also allowed third-party addons.

OpenOffice.org was used in 2005 by &quot;The Guardian&quot; to illustrate what it saw as the limitations of open-source software.

==== OpenOffice.org 2 ====
Work on version 2.0 began in early 2003 with the following goals (the &quot;Q Product Concept&quot;): better interoperability with Microsoft Office; improved speed and lower memory usage; greater scripting capabilities; better integration, particularly with GNOME; a more usable database; digital signatures; and improved usability. It would also be the first version to default to OpenDocument. Sun released the first beta version on 4 March 2005.

On 2 September 2005, Sun announced that it was retiring SISSL to reduce license proliferation, though some press analysts felt it was so that IBM could not reuse OpenOffice.org code without contributing back. Versions after 2.0 beta 2 would use only the LGPL.

On 20 October 2005, OpenOffice.org 2.0 was released. 2.0.1 was released eight weeks later, fixing minor bugs and introducing new features. As of the 2.0.3 release, OpenOffice.org changed its release cycle from 18 months to releasing updates every three months.

The OpenOffice.org 2 series attracted considerable press attention. A &quot;PC Pro&quot; review awarded it 6 stars out of 6 and stated: &quot;Our pick of the low-cost office suites has had a much-needed overhaul, and now battles Microsoft in terms of features, not just price.&quot; &quot;Federal Computer Week&quot; listed OpenOffice.org as one of the &quot;5 stars of open-source products&quot;, noting in particular the importance of OpenDocument. &quot;Computerworld&quot; reported that for large government departments, migration to OpenOffice.org 2.0 cost one tenth of the price of upgrading to Microsoft Office 2007.

==== OpenOffice.org 3 ====

On 13 October 2008, version 3.0 was released, featuring the ability to import (though not export) Office Open XML documents, support for ODF 1.2, improved VBA macros, and a native interface port for OS X. It also introduced the new Start Center and upgraded to LGPL version 3 as its license.

Version 3.2 included support for PostScript-based OpenType fonts. It warned users when ODF 1.2 Extended features had been used. An improvement to the document integrity check determined if an ODF document conformed to the ODF specification and offered a repair if necessary. Calc and Writer both reduced &quot;cold start&quot; time by 46% compared to version 3.0. 3.2.1 was the first Oracle release.

Version 3.3, the last Oracle version, was released in January 2011. New features include an updated print form, a FindBar and interface improvements for Impress. The commercial version, Oracle Open Office 3.3 (StarOffice renamed), based on the beta, was released on 15 December 2010, as was the single release of Oracle Cloud Office (a proprietary product from an unrelated codebase).

==== OpenOffice.org 3.4 Beta 1 ====
A beta version of OpenOffice.org 3.4 was released on 12 April 2011, including new SVG import, improved ODF 1.2 support, and spreadsheet functionality.

Before the final version of OpenOffice.org 3.4 could be released, Oracle cancelled its sponsorship of development and fired the remaining Star Division development team.

== Market share ==
Problems arise in estimating the market share of OpenOffice.org because it could be freely distributed via download sites (including mirror sites), peer-to-peer networks, CDs, Linux distributions and so forth. The project tried to capture key adoption data in a market-share analysis, listing known distribution totals, known deployments and conversions and analyst statements and surveys.

According to Valve, as of July 2010, 14.63% of Steam users had OpenOffice.org installed on their machines.

A market-share analysis conducted by a web analytics service in 2010, based on over 200,000 Internet users, showed a wide range of adoption in different countries: 0.2% in China, 9% in the US and the UK and over 20% in Poland, the Czech Republic, and Germany.

Although Microsoft Office retained 95% of the general market — as measured by revenue — as of August 2007, OpenOffice.org and StarOffice had secured 15–20% of the business market as of 2004 and a 2010 University of Colorado at Boulder study reported that OpenOffice.org had reached a point where it had an &quot;irreversible&quot; installed user base and that it would continue to grow.

The project claimed more than 98 million downloads as of September 2007 and 300 million total to the release of version 3.2 in February 2010. The project claimed over one hundred million downloads for the OpenOffice.org 3 series within a year of release.

=== Notable users ===
Large-scale users of OpenOffice.org included Singapore&#x27;s Ministry of Defence, and Banco do Brasil. OpenOffice.org was the official office suite for the French Gendarmerie.

In India, several government organizations such as Employees&#x27; State Insurance, IIT Bombay, National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development, the Supreme Court of India, ICICI Bank, and the Allahabad High Court, which use Linux, completely relied on OpenOffice.org for their administration.

In Japan, conversions from Microsoft Office to OpenOffice.org included many municipal offices: Sumoto, Hyōgo in 2004, Ninomiya, Tochigi in 2006, Aizuwakamatsu, Fukushima in 2008 (and to LibreOffice as of 2012), Shikokuchūō, Ehime in 2009, Minoh, Osaka in 2009 Toyokawa, Aichi, Fukagawa, Hokkaido and Katano, Osaka in 2010 and Ryūgasaki, Ibaraki in 2011. Corporate conversions included Assist in 2007 (and to LibreOffice on Ubuntu in 2011), Sumitomo Electric Industries in 2008 (and to LibreOffice in 2012), Toho Co., Ltd. in 2009 and Shinsei Financial Co., Ltd. in 2010. Assist also provided support services for OpenOffice.org.

=== Retail ===
In July 2007, Everex, a division of First International Computer and the 9th-largest PC supplier in the U.S., began shipping systems preloaded with OpenOffice.org 2.2 into Wal-Mart, K-mart and Sam&#x27;s Club outlets in North America.

== Forks and derivative software ==
A number of open source and proprietary products derive at least some code from OpenOffice.org, including AndrOpen Office, Apache OpenOffice, ChinaOffice, Co-Create Office, EuroOffice 2005, Go-oo, KaiOffice, IBM Lotus Symphony, IBM Workplace, Jambo OpenOffice (the first office suite in Swahili), LibreOffice, MagyarOffice, MultiMedia Office, MYOffice 2007, NeoOffice, NextOffice, OfficeOne, OfficeTLE, OOo4Kids, OpenOfficePL, OpenOffice.org Portable, OpenOfficeT7, OpenOffice.ux.pl, OxOffice, OxygenOffice Professional, Pladao Office, PlusOffice Mac, RedOffice, RomanianOffice, StarOffice/Oracle Open Office, SunShine Office, ThizOffice, UP Office, White Label Office, WPS Office Storm (the 2004 edition of Kingsoft Office) and 602Office.

The OpenOffice.org website also listed a large variety of complementary products, including groupware systems.

Major derivatives include:

=== Active ===

==== Apache OpenOffice ====
In June 2011, Oracle contributed the OpenOffice.org code and trademarks to the Apache Software Foundation. The developer pool for the Apache project was proposed to be seeded by IBM employees, Linux distribution companies and public sector agencies. IBM employees did the majority of the development, including hiring ex-Star Division developers. The Apache project removed or replaced as much code as possible from OpenOffice.org 3.4 beta 1, including fonts, under licenses unacceptable to Apache and released 3.4.0 in May 2012.

The codebase for IBM&#x27;s Lotus Symphony was donated to the Apache Software Foundation in 2012 and merged for Apache OpenOffice 4.0, and Symphony was deprecated in favour of Apache OpenOffice.

While the project considers itself the unbroken continuation of OpenOffice.org, others regard it as a fork, or at the least a separate project.

In October 2014, Bruce Byfield, writing for Linux Magazine, said the project had &quot;all but stalled [possibly] due to IBM&#x27;s withdrawal from the project.&quot; , the project has no release manager, and itself reports a lack of volunteer involvement and code contributions. After ongoing problems with unfixed security vulnerabilities from 2015 onward, in September 2016 the project started discussions on possibly retiring AOO.

==== Collabora Online ====

Collabora Online is a version of LibreOffice with a web interface and real-time collaborative editing. It is developed by Collabora Productivity.

==== LibreOffice ====

Sun had stated in the original OpenOffice.org announcement in 2000 that the project would be run by a neutral foundation, and put forward a more detailed proposal in 2001. There were many calls to put this into effect over the ensuing years. On 28 September 2010, in frustration at years of perceived neglect of the codebase and community by Sun and then Oracle, members of the OpenOffice.org community announced a non-profit called The Document Foundation and a fork of OpenOffice.org named LibreOffice. Go-oo improvements were merged, and that project was retired in favour of LibreOffice. The goal was to produce a vendor-independent office suite with ODF support and without any copyright assignment requirements.

Oracle was invited to become a member of the Document Foundation and was asked to donate the OpenOffice.org brand. Oracle instead demanded that all members of the OpenOffice.org Community Council involved with the Document Foundation step down, leaving the Council composed only of Oracle employees.

Most Linux distributions promptly replaced OpenOffice.org with LibreOffice; Oracle Linux 6 also features LibreOffice rather than OpenOffice.org or Apache OpenOffice. The project rapidly accumulated developers, development effort and added features, the majority of outside OpenOffice.org developers having moved to LibreOffice. In March 2015, an LWN.net development comparison of LibreOffice with Apache OpenOffice concluded that &quot;LibreOffice has won the battle for developer participation&quot;.

=== Discontinued ===

==== NeoOffice ====

NeoOffice, an independent commercial port for Macintosh that tracked the main line of development, offered a native OS X Aqua user interface before OpenOffice.org did. Later versions are derived from Go-oo, rather than directly from OpenOffice.org. All versions from NeoOffice 3.1.1 to NeoOffice 2015 were based on OpenOffice.org 3.1.1, though latter versions included stability fixes from LibreOffice and Apache OpenOffice. NeoOffice 2017 and later versions are fully based on LibreOffice.

==== Go-oo ====
The ooo-build patch set was started at Ximian in 2002, because Sun was slow to accept outside work on OpenOffice.org, even from corporate partners, and to make the build process easier on Linux. It tracked the main line of development and was not intended to constitute a fork. Most Linux distributions used, and worked together on, ooo-build.

Sun&#x27;s contributions to OpenOffice.org had been declining for a number of years and some developers were unwilling to assign copyright in their work to Sun, particularly given the deal between Sun and IBM to license the code outside the LGPL. On 2 October 2007, Novell announced that ooo-build would be available as a software package called Go-oo, not merely a patch set. (The go-oo.org domain name had been in use by ooo-build as early as 2005.) Sun reacted negatively, with Simon Phipps of Sun terming it &quot;a hostile and competitive fork&quot;. Many free software advocates worried that Go-oo was a Novell effort to incorporate Microsoft technologies, such as Office Open XML, that might be vulnerable to patent claims. However, the office suite branded &quot;OpenOffice.org&quot; in most Linux distributions, having previously been ooo-build, soon in fact became Go-oo.

Go-oo also encouraged outside contributions, with rules similar to those later adopted for LibreOffice. When LibreOffice forked, Go-oo was deprecated in favour of that project.

OpenOffice Novell edition was a supported version of Go-oo.

==== IBM Lotus Symphony ====

The Workplace Managed Client in IBM Workplace 2.6 (23 January 2006) incorporated code from OpenOffice.org 1.1.4, the last version under the SISSL. This code was broken out into a separate application as Lotus Symphony (30 May 2008), with a new interface based on Eclipse. Symphony 3.0 (21 October 2010) was rebased on OpenOffice.org 3.0, with the code licensed privately from Sun. IBM&#x27;s changes were donated to the Apache Software Foundation in 2012, Symphony was deprecated in favour of Apache OpenOffice and its code was merged into Apache OpenOffice 4.0.

==== StarOffice ====

Sun used OpenOffice.org as a base for its commercial proprietary StarOffice application software, which was OpenOffice.org with some added proprietary components. Oracle bought Sun in January 2010 and quickly renamed StarOffice to Oracle Open Office. Oracle discontinued development in April 2011.

<text>Gottfried Benn (2 May 1886 – 7 July 1956) was a German poet, essayist, and physician. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature five times. He was awarded the Georg Büchner Prize in 1951.

==Biography and work==

===Family and beginnings===

Gottfried Benn was born in a Lutheran country parsonage, a few hours from Berlin, the son and grandson of pastors in Mansfeld, now part of Putlitz in the district of Prignitz, Brandenburg. He was educated in Sellin in the Neumark and Frankfurt an der Oder. To please his father, he studied theology at the University of Marburg and military medicine at the Kaiser Wilhelm Academy in Berlin. After being laid off as a military doctor in 1912, Benn turned to pathology, where he dissected over 200 bodies between October 1912 and November 1913 in Berlin. Many of his literary works reflect on his time as a pathologist.

In the summer of 1912, Benn started a romantic relationship with the Jewish poet Else Lasker-Schüler.

Gottfried Benn began his literary career as a poet when he published a booklet titled &quot;Morgue and Other Poems&quot; in 1912, containing expressionist poems dealing with physical decay of flesh, with blood, cancer, and death — for example No III — &quot;Cycle&quot;:



Poems like this &quot;were received by critics and public with shock, dismay, even revulsion.&quot; In 1913 a second volume of poems came out, titled &quot;Sons. New Poems&quot;.

Benn&#x27;s poetry projects an introverted nihilism, that is, an existentialist outlook that views artistic expression as the only purposeful action. In his early poems Benn used his medical experience, often using medical terminology, to portray humanity morbidly as just another species of disease-ridden animal.

===World War I and Weimar Republic===

After the outbreak of World War I he enlisted in 1914, and spent a brief period on the Belgian front, then served as a military doctor in Brussels. Benn attended the court-martial and execution of Nurse and British spy Edith Cavell. He also worked as a physician in a hospital for prostitutes. After the war, he returned to Berlin and practiced as a dermatologist and venereal disease specialist.

During the 1920s, he continued having a close relationship with Jewish poet Else Lasker-Schüler who addressed love poems to him. This bond to her is the subject of the film &quot;Mein Herz-niemandem&quot; (1997) by Helma Sanders-Brahms.

===During the Third Reich===

Hostile to the Weimar Republic, and rejecting Marxism and Americanism, Benn was upset with ongoing economic and political instability, and sympathized for a short period with the Nazis, whom he incorrectly saw as a Conservative Revolutionary force. He hoped that National Socialism would exalt his aesthetics and that expressionism would become the official art of Germany, as Futurism had become in Italy. Benn was elected to the poetry section of the Prussian Academy in 1932 and appointed head of that section in February 1933. In May, he defended the new regime in a radio broadcast, saying &quot;the German workers are better off than ever before.&quot; He later signed the &quot;Gelöbnis treuester Gefolgschaft&quot;, that is, the &quot;vow of most faithful allegiance&quot; to Adolf Hitler.

The cultural policy of the new State didn&#x27;t turn out the way he hoped, and in June Hans Friederich Blunck replaced Benn as head of the academy&#x27;s poetry section. Appalled by the Night of the Long Knives, Benn turned away from the Nazis. He lived quietly, refraining from public criticism of the Nazi Party, but wrote that the bad conditions of the system &quot;gave me the latter punch&quot; and stated in a letter that the developments presented a &quot;dreadful tragedy&quot;. He decided to perform &quot;the aristocratic form of emigration&quot; and joined the Wehrmacht in 1935, where he found many officers sympathetic to his disapproval of the régime. In May 1936 the SS magazine &quot;Das Schwarze Korps&quot; attacked his expressionist and experimental poetry as degenerate, Jewish, and homosexual. In the summer of 1937, Wolfgang Willrich, a member of the SS, lampooned Benn in his book &quot;Säuberung des Kunsttempels&quot;; Heinrich Himmler, however, stepped in to reprimand Willrich and defended Benn on the grounds of his good record since 1933 (his earlier artistic output being irrelevant). In 1938 the Reichsschrifttumskammer (the National Socialist authors&#x27; association) banned Benn from further writing.

===After the war===

During World War II, Benn was posted to garrisons in eastern Germany where he wrote poems and essays. After the war, his work was banned by the Allies because of his initial support for Hitler. In 1951 he was awarded the Georg Büchner Prize. In 1953 he released the poem &quot;Nur zwei Dinge&quot;, which appeared in the Benn&#x27;s collection of poems &quot;Destillationen.&quot; He died of cancer in West Berlin in 1956, and was buried in Waldfriedhof Dahlem, Berlin.
==Reception==
Benn had a great influence on German poetry immediately before World War I (as an expressionist), as well as after World War II (as the &#x27;Static&#x27; poet).

<text>StarOffice is a discontinued proprietary office suite. Its source code continues today in derived open-source office suites Collabora Online and LibreOffice. StarOffice supported the OpenOffice.org XML file format, as well as the OpenDocument standard, and could generate PDF and Flash formats. It included templates, a macro recorder, and a software development kit (SDK).

The software originated in 1985 as StarWriter by Star Division, which marketed the suite with some success, primarily in Europe. StarOffice was acquired by Sun Microsystems in 1999, which released the source code the following year as a free and open source office suite called OpenOffice.org, which subsequent versions of StarOffice were based on, with additional proprietary components. Sun Microsystems was acquired by Oracle Corporation in 2010, and the product was known briefly as Oracle Open Office before being discontinued in 2011, with Oracle turning OpenOffice.org into a &quot;purely community-based project&quot;.

== History ==
StarWriter 1.0 was written by Marco Börries in 1985 for the Zilog Z80. Börries formed Star Division in Lüneburg the following year. It was later ported to the Amstrad CPC (marketed by Schneider in Germany) under CP/M and later ported to the 8086-based Amstrad PC-1512, running under MS-DOS 3.2. Later, the integration of the other individual programs followed as the development progressed to an office suite for DOS, IBM&#x27;s OS/2 Warp, and for the Microsoft Windows operating system. From this time onwards Star Division marketed its suite under the name &quot;StarOffice.&quot;

Until version 4.2, Star Division based StarOffice on the cross-platform C++ class library StarView. In 1998 Star Division began offering StarOffice for free.

Sun Microsystems acquired the company, copyright and trademark of StarOffice in 1999 for , as it was supposedly cheaper than 42,000 licenses of Microsoft Office.

In March 2009, a study showed that StarOffice only had a 3% market share in the corporate market.

== Naming ==
StarSuite was the version of StarOffice with Asian language localization. It included Japanese, Korean, Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese interfaces. It also included additional fonts for the East Asian market, resulting in slightly larger installation footprint. Otherwise the features were identical to StarOffice.

The two brands existed because a StarOffice brand was owned by another company in certain Asian countries. Currently NEC produces StarOffice collaborative software (unrelated to the one discussed here) in Japan. After Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems (in January 2010) it renamed both StarOffice and StarSuite as &quot;Oracle Open Office&quot;.

=== Other differences ===
There are also differences in the documentation, training and support options, and some minor differences in the look and icons between Oracle Open Office and OpenOffice.org.

Other differences are that StarOffice only supports 12 languages, compared to over 110 for OpenOffice.org.

==Version history==
=== StarOffice 2.0 ===
StarWriter was the first StarOffice, with the successor being StarOffice 2.0 which included StarWriter compact, StarBase 1.0, StarDraw 1.0.

Supported platforms included DOS.

=== StarOffice 3 ===
StarOffice 3.0 included StarWriter 3.0, StarCalc 3.0, StarDraw 3.0, StarImage, StarChart.

Supported platforms included DOS, Windows 3.1, OS/2, Solaris on SPARC. Power Mac beta support was introduced in 1996.

==== 3.1 ====
Supported platforms included Windows 3.1/95, OS/2 (16-bit), Linux i386, Solaris Sparc/x86, Mac OS 7.5 – 8.0.

Caldera, Inc. supported the Linux-port of StarOffice 3.1 with approximately 800,000 DM in order to offer the product with their forthcoming OpenLinux distribution in 1997.

=== StarOffice 4.0 ===
Supported platforms included Windows 3.1/95, OS/2, Linux i386, Solaris Sparc/x86, Mac OS (beta).

=== StarOffice 5 ===
5.0 was released late November 1998. Supported platforms included Windows 95/NT 3.51, OS/2, Linux i386, Solaris Sparc/x86.

==== 5.2 ====
5.2 was released 20 June 2000. Sun offered StarOffice 5.2 as a free download for personal use, and soon went through an exercise similar to Netscape&#x27;s relicensing of Mozilla, by releasing most of the StarOffice source code under a free/open source license. The resultant free/open source software codebase fork continued development as older discontinued components, with contributions from both Sun and the wider OpenOffice.org community. Sun then took &quot;snapshots&quot; of the OpenOffice.org code base, integrated proprietary and third-party code modules, and marketed the package commercially.

StarOffice 5.2 was the last version to contain the programs listed under older discontinued components. It was also the last version to support multiple virtual desktops, previously available from within the Suite.

== Pricing and licensing ==
Traditionally, StarOffice licenses sold for around , but in 2004, Sun planned to offer subscription-based licenses to Japanese customers for about () per year (Becker, 2004). P. Ulander, a desktop products manager for Sun, acknowledged that Sun planned to expand subscription-based licenses to other countries as well. In January 2009, Sun&#x27;s website offered StarOffice for .

Sun used a per-person license for StarOffice, compared to the per-device licenses used for most other proprietary software. An individual purchaser gains the right to install the software on up to five computers. For example, a small-business owner can have the software on laptop, office and home computers, or a user with a computer running Microsoft Windows, and another running Linux, can install StarOffice on both computers.

In 2010, StarOffice 9 Software was no longer offered free of charge to education customers, but StarOffice 8 could still be used without charge. The free OpenOffice.org 3.0, with the same functionality as StarOffice 9, could also be used. Sun also offered free web-based training and an online tutorial for students and teachers, free support services for teachers (including educational templates for StarOffice) and significantly discounted technical support for schools.

From August 2007 to November 2008, Google offered StarOffice 8 as part of its free downloadable Google Pack application.

== Derivatives ==
OpenOffice.org was open source, and gave rise to many derivative versions and successor projects to StarOffice. , Collabora Online and LibreOffice are still actively developed. Apache OpenOffice is mostly dormant and has not seen a new major release for over 10 years. NeoOffice was also a derivative, but announced that it was no longer active in early 2024.

<doc id="68230" wikidata="Q283777" url="?curid=68230" title="Mayday">
<text>Mayday is an emergency procedure word used internationally as a distress signal in voice-procedure radio communications.

It is used to signal a life-threatening emergency primarily by aviators and mariners, but in some countries local organizations such as firefighters, police forces, and transportation organizations also use the term. Convention requires the word be repeated three times in a row during the initial emergency declaration (&quot;Mayday mayday mayday&quot;).

==History==
The &quot;mayday&quot; procedure word was conceived as a distress call in the early 1920s by Frederick Stanley Mockford, officer-in-charge of radio at Croydon Airport, England. He had been asked to think of a word that would indicate distress and would easily be understood by all pilots and ground staff in an emergency. Since much of the air traffic at the time was between Croydon and Le Bourget Airport in Paris, he proposed the term &quot;mayday&quot;, the phonetic equivalent of the French (&quot;help me&quot;) or (a short form of , &quot;come [and] help me&quot;). (&quot;M&#x27;aidez&quot; is non-standard French; the phrase &quot;Aidez moi&quot; is standard.) The term is unrelated to the holiday May Day.

Following tests, the new procedure word was introduced for cross-Channel flights in February 1923. The previous distress call had been the Morse code signal SOS, but this was not considered suitable for voice communication, &quot;[o]wing to the difficulty of distinguishing the letter &#x27;S&#x27; by telephone&quot;. In 1927, the International Radiotelegraph Convention of Washington, D.C. adopted the voice call &quot;mayday&quot; as the radiotelephone distress call in addition to the SOS radiotelegraph (Morse code) signal.

==Mayday calls==

If a mayday call cannot be sent because a radio is not available, a variety of other distress signals and calls for help can be used. Additionally, a mayday call can be sent on behalf of one vessel by another; this is known as a mayday relay.

Civilian aircraft making a mayday call in United States airspace are encouraged by the Federal Aviation Administration to use the following format, omitting any portions as necessary for expediency or where they are irrelevant (capitalization as in the original source):

Making a false distress call is a criminal offense in many countries, punishable by a fine, restitution, and possible imprisonment.

==Other urgent calls==

===Pan-pan===

&quot;Pan-pan&quot; (from the French: &quot;&quot;, &#x27;a breakdown&#x27;) indicates an urgent situation, such as a mechanical failure or a medical problem, of a lower order than a &quot;grave and imminent threat requiring immediate assistance&quot;. The suffix &quot;medico&quot; originally was to be added by vessels in British waters to indicate a medical problem (&quot;pan-pan medico&quot;, repeated three times), or by aircraft declaring a non-life-threatening medical emergency of a passenger in flight, or those operating as protected medical transport in accordance with the Geneva Conventions. &quot;Pan-pan medico&quot; is no longer in official use.

===Declaring emergency===
Sometimes the phrase &quot;declaring emergency&quot; is used in aviation, as an alternative to calling &quot;mayday&quot;. For example, in 1998 Swissair Flight 111 radioed &quot;Swissair one-eleven heavy is declaring emergency&quot; after their situation had worsened, upgrading from the &quot;pan-pan&quot; which was declared earlier.

However, the International Civil Aviation Organization recommends the use of the standard &quot;pan-pan&quot; and &quot;mayday&quot; calls instead of &quot;declaring an emergency&quot;. Cases of pilots using phrases other than &quot;pan-pan&quot; and &quot;mayday&quot; have caused confusion and errors in aircraft handling.

===Silencing other communications traffic===

&quot;Seelonce mayday&quot; (using an approximation of the French pronunciation of &quot;&quot;) is a demand that the channel only be used by the vessel/s and authorities involved with the distress. The channel may not be used for normal working traffic until &quot;seelonce feenee&quot; is broadcast. &quot;Seelonce mayday&quot; and &quot;seelonce feenee&quot; may only be sent by the controlling station in charge of the distress. The expression &quot;stop transmitting – mayday&quot; is an aeronautical equivalent of &quot;seelonce mayday&quot;. &quot;Seelonce distress&quot; and &quot;prudonce&quot; are no longer in use since ITU WRC-07.

The format for a &quot;seelonce mayday&quot; is MAYDAY, All Stations x3 or [Interfering station] x3, this is [controlling station], SEELONCE MAYDAY.

&quot;Seelonce feenee&quot; (from French &quot;&quot;, &#x27;silence finished&#x27;) means that the emergency situation has been concluded and the channel may now be used normally. &quot;Distress traffic ended&quot; is the aeronautical equivalent of &quot;seelonce feenee&quot;.

The format for the &quot;seelonce feenee&quot; is MAYDAY, All stations x3, this is [controlling station] x3, date and time in UTC, distressed vessels MMSI number, distressed vessels name, distressed vessels call sign, SEELONCE FEENEE.

<doc id="68232" wikidata="Q2640148" url="?curid=68232" title="Baldur's Gate">
<text>Baldur&#x27;s Gate is a series of role-playing video games set in the Forgotten Realms &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; campaign setting. The series has been divided into two sub-series, known as the &quot;Bhaalspawn Saga&quot; and the &quot;Dark Alliance&quot;, both taking place mostly within the Western Heartlands, but the Bhaalspawn Saga extends to Amn and Tethyr. The &quot;Dark Alliance&quot; series was released for consoles and was critically and commercially successful. The &quot;Bhaalspawn Saga&quot; was critically acclaimed for using pausable realtime gameplay, which is credited with revitalizing the computer role-playing game (CRPG) genre.

The &quot;Bhaalspawn Saga&quot; was originally developed by BioWare for personal computers. Beamdog and its division Overhaul Games developed remakes of the original games in HD. The &quot;Dark Alliance&quot; series was originally set to be developed by Snowblind Studios, but ports were handled by Black Isle Studios, High Voltage Software, and Magic Pockets, with the second game developed by Black Isle.

Black Isle Studios had planned a third series to be set in the Dalelands and be a PC-exclusive hack and slash game with pausable real-time gameplay. The game would not have been connected to the Bhaalspawn Saga series. The game was cancelled when Interplay forfeited the D&amp;D PC license to Atari.

The series was revived in 2012 with &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Enhanced Edition&quot;, an update of the original &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; using an enhanced Infinity Engine. The release of the Enhanced Edition marked the first release in the series in eight years, and was followed by an enhanced edition of the second &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; called &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate II: Enhanced Edition&quot;. Beamdog was granted permission to develop new games with the license, such as &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Siege of Dragonspear&quot;, an expansion for &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Enhanced Edition&quot;. The license was later given to Larian Studios, who developed and published &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&quot;, released in 2023.

==Games==
The &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; series brought technical advancements over role-playing video games of the past. BioWare&#x27;s Infinity Engine offers a pre-rendered isometric worldview, with sprite-based characters. &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; was the third computer game to make use of the Lua scripting language. The engine was used for &quot;&quot; and the &quot;Icewind Dale&quot; series.

The earliest released in the series are based on a real-time modification of the second edition &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; (&quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;) ruleset. The player&#x27;s party can have up to six members, either created by the player according to the &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; rules or non-player characters (NPCs) recruited by the protagonist from the game world. 

&quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&quot; is based on &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 5th Edition, and the party is limited to 4 characters.

Numerous side quests and plot twists are associated with particular NPCs and can be activated if they are found in the player&#x27;s party. Through extensive, context-dependent dialogue, many characters inside and outside the player&#x27;s party are fleshed out and given an added level of complexity.

===Original series===
The first game in the series was &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; and introduces the player character as a powerless orphan raised in the monastery of Candlekeep, south of Baldur&#x27;s Gate and north of the kingdom of Amn. The main character searches for the killer of their foster father Gorion, and becomes involved with the region&#x27;s iron crisis which causes metal to crumble, while battling to stay alive. An expansion pack for Baldur&#x27;s Gate called &quot;Tales of the Sword Coast&quot; did not add to the primary storyline, but presented the protagonist with more areas to explore along the Sword Coast, more powerful enemies, more spells, and better equipment. It also allows the player character to reach higher levels of experience, made some general changes to gameplay, and altered the original game&#x27;s final battle.

The sequel to &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; was &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate II: Shadows of Amn&quot;. The main character is captured by Jon Irenicus and must escape into the city of Athkatla, the capital of Amn. Here the protagonist faces several different ways to figure out the reason behind the capture, as they journey through the region of Amn and the Underdark. The game presents a number of innovations over the first &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; game, including further specialization of character classes, better graphics, and higher power levels. It also allowed more interaction with the game&#x27;s joinable NPCs, including friendships, romances, and your own party members&#x27; interactions with one another. &quot;Throne of Bhaal&quot; is an expansion pack for &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate II: Shadows of Amn&quot;, and includes both an expansion of the original game, such as new areas to explore, and a conclusion to the Bhaalspawn story arc started in the first Baldur&#x27;s Gate game.

The third main title, &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&quot;, was developed by Larian Studios in partnership with Wizards of the Coast, which holds the license for the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; IP. It was released in 2023 for Windows PC, Mac OS, PS5, Xbox Series X/S.

The action role-playing game &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Dark Alliance&quot; was developed by Snowblind Studios and others, and released in 2001 for the PlayStation 2 console, and later Xbox and GameCube video game consoles. The game takes place in the city of &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; and surrounding area and is set in the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; setting, with a ruleset derived from the 3rd edition of Dungeon &amp; Dragons; the plot is unrelated to previous PC games. The console version used an overhead third person view, and hack-and-slash dungeon crawl style gameplay. A Game Boy Advance version was released in 2004, with reduced graphics quality using an 2.5D isometric type perspective. While all ports were very well received, the original for the PlayStation 2 was the only one that gained universal acclaim.

A sequel, &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Dark Alliance II&quot; was developed by Black Isle Studios and released in 2004 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox; the game used the same gameplay style as the original, and was also positively reviewed. The gameplay style was expanded to make the game more like a role-playing game, the ability to craft weapons, armor and amulets was added, &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; became a hub city with the addition of a world map and being able to travel back to areas, making the game open world and many more side-quests were added as well as the ability to level up one&#x27;s class.

Interplay Entertainment placed its entire catalogue of video game intellectual properties (IP) and assets up for sale, including that of &quot;Dark Alliance&quot; in 2016.

&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance&quot; was developed by Tuque Games in partnership with Wizards of the Coast. Tuque Games studio head Jeff Hattem described the game as a &quot;spiritual successor&quot; to the previous &quot;Dark Alliance&quot; games, rather than a direct sequel. &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance&quot; has third-person perspectives rather than the traditional 2.5D isometric perspective of the previous &quot;Dark Alliance&quot; games. The game, which features a storyline based on characters from R. A. Salvatore&#x27;s novel series &quot;The Legend of Drizzt&quot;, was released in 2021 to mixed reviews.

===Enhanced editions===

The original game was remade in 2012 by Overhaul Games and Beamdog, 14 years after the release of the original game. It was re-released on multiple platforms as &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Enhanced Edition&quot;, a collection of the original game and its expansion &quot;Tales of the Sword Coast&quot;. A brand new expansion named &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Siege of Dragonspear&quot; was released in 2016.

&quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate II: Enhanced Edition&quot;, a remake of the second game, was released in 2013. It was developed by Overhaul Games for PC, Mac OS X, iOS, Linux and Android, featuring a modified version of the Infinity Engine. The game features a new content and widescreen compatibility, and utilized 2nd Edition D&amp;D rules. Beamdog also made enhanced versions of other Infinity Engine games, including &quot;Icewind Dale&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot;.

The enhanced versions were released for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in 2019.

=== &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate III: The Black Hound&quot; ===
&quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate III: The Black Hound&quot; (code named &quot;Jefferson&quot; and &quot;FR6&quot;) was mentioned in early 2001 as a new game in the &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; series to be made by Black Isle Studios using a new 3D engine. The game was originally announced in 2002 and was said to have used the 3rd Edition &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; ruleset. Many new gameplay features were also going to be added to fit the 3rd Edition Ruleset better, and elements from the &quot;Dark Alliance&quot; series would have also been borrowed. The game used the Jefferson Engine which featured 3D effects such as casting dynamic shadows.

&quot;The Black Hound&quot; was originally going to be a departure from the high-powered epic of the Bhaalspawn saga to a low-key, role-playing plot. With protagonists progressing to around level four at the end of Black Isle Studios&#x27; typically large campaign and a hard cap at level eight, gameplay was refocussed to adventure, with emphasizing quests over combat. The game was only titled &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; due to Interplay having lost the general &quot;D&amp;D&quot; license to Atari, but still retaining the right to make &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; and &quot;Icewind Dale&quot; branded &quot;D&amp;D&quot; games (the same reason as for &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Dark Alliance&quot;″s title). The game was not going to be connected to the previous &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; series in any way and would start a new series, the &quot;Black Hound&quot; series. It was to be a sequel in terms of gameplay and not story, although it would have continued some aspects of the &quot;Icewind Dale II&quot; story.

Development on &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate III: The Black Hound&quot; was cancelled in 2003 and the third game in the &quot;Dark Alliance&quot; series was also cancelled in 2004 when Black Isle Studios was closed in the same year by parent company Interplay Entertainment Corp. The engine for &quot;The Black Hound&quot; was re-purposed for the development of the similarly ill-fated &quot;Van Buren&quot; project, the working title for the eventual &quot;Fallout 3&quot;. The game was 75% finished before it was canceled. Its cancellation happened due to Interplay losing the right to publish &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; games on the PC yet retaining the &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; name for consoles; the result of this was &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Dark Alliance II&quot;.

In an interview with Winterwind Productions, &quot;Black Hound&quot; developer Damien Foletto revealed the story and setting of the game, which would have been in the Dalelands. The player character would have been resting at their campsite when a woman chasing a Black Hound crashes in; she kills the hound, which dies on the player character &#x27;s lap. Accusing the player character of being in league with the dog, she is about to kill the player character as well, but the Riders of Archendale arrive and scare her off before questioning the player character. After a brief inquisition, the local magistrates tell the player character not to wander far because they may have more questions. The player&#x27;s quest would involve finding out who the mad cleric was, what this has to do with them, why a black spirit hound follows them around, and why people can not leave the player character alone and do things for themselves instead.

Atari stated in December 2008 in a press conference that the &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; series (among others) would be revisited after 2009. As a personal side project, Sawyer continued work on &quot;The Black Hound&quot; as a module for &quot;Neverwinter Nights 2&quot; for a time.

=== &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&quot; by Overhaul Games ===
After finishing the Enhanced Editions of &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; and &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate II&quot;, Overhaul Games announced to develop &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&quot; with funding from Kickstarter. The studio later clarified their &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; game to be a separate game from &quot;The Black Hound&quot;. Game developer Trent Oster suggested Thay and Waterdeep as possible settings for the game. Beamdog began calling the game &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate Next&quot; as a way to differentiate it from the Bhaalspawn Saga.

Overhaul Games and Beamdog eventually lost the rights to develop further &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; games and the license was later acquired by Larian Studios, the Belgian developer behind the &quot;&quot; series. Their project, &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&quot;, was unveiled in 2019 and released four years later.

==Characters==
The &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; series features a wide array of characters. Some characters can be recruited by the player as party members and accompany the player character in their adventures. Other major characters influence the plot of the game but are not playable characters, serving as either antagonists or supporting characters in their interactions with the player character. The player character for the main series is fully customizable, whereas the &quot;Dark Alliance&quot; sub-series feature a choice of defined characters for the player to choose from.

* Aerie is an avariel, an elven subspecies that possess wings, but she lost hers as a child when she was imprisoned in a circus by slavers. She was eventually rescued and restored to health by Quayle, a gnome and potential companion in &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot;. Aerie is relatively young and inexperienced during the events of &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate II&quot;, and embodies the damsel in distress archetype. She is a recruitable companion, and potential love interest for a male player character in &quot;Shadows of Amn&quot;; if the romance continues into the &quot;Throne of Bhaal&quot;, she will eventually bear the player character&#x27;s child.
* Allessia Faithhammer is one of the player characters of &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Dark Alliance II&quot;. She is a Cleric of Helm, the god of guardians, protection and protectors. She travels to Baldur&#x27;s Gate during the events of &quot;Dark Alliance II&quot; after hearing of the troubles in the city. &quot;PC Gamer&quot; likened her to a medieval version of RoboCop, a &quot;do-gooder bound to protect the innocent and serving the public&quot;, and who &quot;has a neat range of magical attacks at her disposal&quot;.
* Anomen Delryn is a warrior priest of Helm, and an acolyte of the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart. Deeply insecure due to his father&#x27;s treatment of him, Anomen presents himself as a vain and arrogant character, frequently bragging about battles he most likely never fought. He is a potential companion, as well as love interest in &quot;Shadows of Amn&quot; if the player character is female. Depending on the player&#x27;s actions, he may succeed or fail at his knighthood quest to ascend as a full member of his Order, the outcome of which changes his personality and in-game alignment. David Gaider noted that Anomen&#x27;s romance subplot was his first attempt as a writer employed by Bioware.
* Edwin Odesseiron is a haughty member of the Red Wizards of Thay who seeks the player character&#x27;s cooperation to kill a potential companion, the witch Dynaheir, and will join the party if the player character agrees to help him. He may also be recruited in &quot;Shadows of Amn&quot;, where he may be encountered as an agent employed by the Shadow Thieves of Amn. Progressing Edwin&#x27;s personal side quest to pursue the Nether Scrolls will result in him changing sex after he attempts to invoke the scroll&#x27;s power; while the story arc itself is treated as purely comic relief with no connection whatsoever to a real-world issue, Esther MacCallum-Stewart noted the subplot as an early example of an LGBT theme being included in a Bioware-made RPG.
* Imoen is the player character&#x27;s childhood friend and fellow ward of their foster father Gorion, living in Candlekeep where they were raised. She is a loyal companion throughout the original &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; series, and her skills as an expert thief may be put to use throughout the series. Childlike and naive by nature, she is forced to endure a series of traumatic experiences during &quot;Shadows of Amn&quot;; she is tortured along with the rest of her companions, and is later arrested and incarcerated by an organisation of magic-users known as the Cowled Wizards for unlicensed magic use. Imoen&#x27;s popularity with the &quot;Baldur Gate&quot; series fandom was not anticipated by Bioware; the original purpose of her inclusion in &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; was to &quot;fill a non-psychotic-thief gap in the early levels&quot; late in the development cycle. 
* Jaheira is a half-elf warrior druid and member of the Harpers, a semi-secret organization dedicated to promoting good and maintaining a balance between civilization and nature. Gorion leaves instructions for the player character to meet her and her husband Khalid after he is killed, although it is optional to recruit the couple into the party. Jaheira is available as a companion in the beginning of &quot;Shadows of Amn&quot;, and is revealed to be widowed soon afterwards. She is a potential love interest for a male player character if certain conditions are met; Gaider noted the romantic subplot itself was lengthy in terms of content, but riddled with bugs. Jaheira is one of the most popular and well-regarded characters in the &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; series.
* Jan Jansen is a gnome, a race with an average lifespan of over 350 years, and the eccentric inventor of multiple gadgets which only he knows how to use, and tends to ramble on with lengthy stories that never get to the point. He is a recruitable companion in &quot;Shadows of Amn&quot;; he is encountered peddling his wares in the city of Amn, which in actuality are dangerous weapons in their own right.
* Jon Irenicus is the chief antagonist of &quot;Shadows of Amn&quot;. He is a cold and calculating mage who was first encountered torturing the player character with powerful magic, as part of his experiments in order to divulge the mysteries of their divine ancestry. Originally an elf known as &quot;Joneleth&quot;, he was exiled from his home city of Suldanessellar by its ruler Queen Ellesime as a result of his hubris to attain godhood.
* Khalid is an effete half-elf fighter, member of the Harpers and husband of Jaheira. He is a nervous, peace-loving warrior with a pronounced stutter. Khalid, like certain other companions, comes with Jaheira as an inseparable pair; if one leaves or is removed the party, the other will follow suit. Khalid is murdered by Irenicus in &quot;Shadows of Amn&quot;, widowing Jaheira and leaving her with survivor&#x27;s guilt. 
* Korgan Bloodaxe is an evil-aligned dwarven berserker, who could be found at the Copper Coronet Inn. He is highly rated as a worthy companion, not only for his combat skills which would prove invaluable for an evil-aligned party, but also for the quality of the banter between him and any good-aligned characters in the party.
* Minsc is a berserker ranger from the human nation of Rashemen, with a strong though somewhat unhinged desire to uphold good and be heroic. His animal companion is a hamster named Boo, who he believes is a &quot;miniature giant space hamster&quot; and consults for advice. Minsc is originally tasked with serving as a bodyguard to the Rashemi witch Dynaheir as part of his rite of passage, and is inseparable from her once she is rescued. He is a potentially recruitable companion throughout the original &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; series, outliving Dynaheir, who is murdered by Irenicus prior to the events of &quot;Shadows of Amn&quot;.
* Sarevok Anchev is the chief antagonist of &quot;Baldur’s Gate&quot;, and as a mortal spawn of the dead God of Murder Bhaal, the half-brother of the player character. As a child he was the would-be victim of a sacrificial ritual which was stopped by Gorion and the Harpers, and was later adopted by a member of a mercantile organization known as the Iron Throne, Rieltar Anchev. Sarevok&#x27;s foster father is a central figure in fomenting the iron crisis in &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; to gain power for the Iron Throne, as well as the doppelganger infiltration of merchant rivals. His goal is to take advantage of the ensuring chaos orchestrated by the Iron Throne to kill his fellow Bhaalspawn and ascend into divinity himself. Sarevok reappears in &quot;Throne of Bhaal&quot; where the player character may restore him to life and recruit him as a party member.
* Vahn is one of the player characters of &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Dark Alliance&quot;. He is an Arcane Archer, known for their ability to shoot arrows with unerring accuracy, often with additional magical effects. Being in the wrong place at the wrong time, Vahn quickly finds himself mired in the political and social upheaval of the city of Baldur&#x27;s Gate, and up against the Dark Alliance led by Eldrith the Betrayer, the main antagonist of &quot;Dark Alliance&quot;.
* Viconia DeVir is a drow outcast and Cleric of Shar, the goddess of darkness, night, and loss. She is a recruitable companion throughout the original &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; series, and a potential love interest for a male player character in &quot;Shadows of Amn&quot;, embodying the femme fatale archetype; if her relationship with the player character continues into &quot;Throne of Bhaal&quot;, a possible ending in the game&#x27;s epilogue would reveal that Viconia is murdered by agents of the drow goddess Lolth.
* Yoshimo is a bounty hunter rogue from Kara-Tur who is encountered in Irenicus&#x27; complex early in &quot;Shadows of Amn&quot;, and offers to join the party in order to increase their odds of escape and survival. If taken to Spellhold, where Irenicus and Imoen are incarcerated by the Cowled Wizards, Yoshimo reveals the terrible secret he had been hiding: he was under the thrall of Irenicus all along, and his purpose is to betray the player character as part of the mage&#x27;s contingency plan. He dies in battle with the party regardless of the player character&#x27;s choices. Yoshimo is the only &quot;Shadows of Amn&quot; companion who is not available for the player character to recruit in &quot;Throne of Bhaal&quot;.

In addition, a number of major &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; characters make guest appearances throughout the &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; series, such as Drizzt Do&#x27;Urden, Elminster, and Volothamp Geddarm. Drizzt in particular appears alongside his fellow Companions of the Hall, Bruenor Battlehammer, Catti-brie and Wulfgar as the protagonists of the 2021 video game &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance&quot;, a spiritual successor to &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Dark Alliance&quot; games.

==Adaptations==
Philip Athans, editor of the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; novel line, wrote the first two novels in the &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; trilogy of novels: &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; and &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate II: Shadows of Amn&quot;, both are novelizations of the video game series&#x27; storylines. The novels follow the basic outline of the original stories, but eschew several of the games&#x27; numerous subplots and include only a few of the NPCs. The Bhaalspawn main character is named Abdel Adrian in the novels. The third novel, &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate II: Throne of Bhaal&quot;, was authored by Drew Karpyshyn.
* 

A comic titled &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Legends of Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; was released in October 2014. The comic is set generations after &quot;Throne of Bhaal&quot;, and features Minsc as the main character. It is written by Jim Zub and pencilled by Max Dunbar, part of the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 40th anniversary celebrations.

==Reception and legacy==
In 1999, &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; won the Origins Award for &quot;Best Role Playing Game Computer Game of 1998&quot;, and in 2000, &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Tales of the Sword Coast&quot; won &quot;Best Role Game Playing Game Computer Game of 1999&quot;. The Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences awarded the original &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; the Interactive Achievement Award for PC Role-Playing Game of the Year. &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate II: Throne of Bhaal&quot; and &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Dark Alliance&quot; also would later win Interactive Achievement Awards for Role-Playing Game of the Year for its respective PC and Console categories for the release year of 2001. &quot;Dark Alliance II&quot; won the 2004 RPG of the Year Award by &quot;GameFan&quot;, and was later inducted into the &quot;GameFan&quot; Hall of Fame. By June 2001, the series sold more than 3.5 million units worldwide.

&quot;PC Gamer&quot;″s Paul Dean noted that the series &quot;has always been as much about who these characters were as what they could do&quot;. He considered &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot;″s characters as the cornerstone of the series, and that some of them were the best RPG companions ever written.

&quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&quot; received universal acclaim, and won several Game of the Year awards including from the Golden Joystick Awards, the Game Awards, the D.I.C.E. Awards, the Game Developers Choice Awards, and the British Academy Games Awards.

<text>Justin Frankel (born 1978) is an American computer programmer best known for his work on the Winamp media player application and for inventing the Gnutella peer-to-peer network. Frankel is also the founder of Cockos Incorporated, which creates music production and development software such as the REAPER digital audio workstation, the NINJAM collaborative music tool and the Jesusonic expandable effects processor. 

In 2002, he was named in the TR100 as one of the top 100 innovators in the world under the age of 35.

== Early life ==

Justin Frankel was born in 1978 and grew up in Sedona, Arizona. Frankel had an aptitude for computers at an early age. His skill eventually led him to running the student computer network of Verde Valley School, which he attended, as well as writing an email application for the students.

== Winamp ==

After graduating high school with a 3.9 GPA, he attended the University of Utah in 1996, where he majored in computer science, but dropped out after two quarters. A few months later, he released the first version of WinAMP under his newly formed company&#x27;s name Nullsoft. By 1998, more than fifteen million people had downloaded the program. Since many people had sent in the $10 donation suggested in return for using the program, Frankel earned tens of thousands of dollars a month.

Frankel, along with Tom Pepper (who played a big part of the Winamp development and distribution), later completed SHOUTcast, which allowed ordinary users with an Internet connection to broadcast, or &quot;stream&quot;, audio over the Internet. He also created the Advanced Visualization Studio, a plugin for Winamp which enabled users to create their own music visualizations in real-time, without any programming knowledge required.

== Sale of Nullsoft to AOL ==

In June 1999 AOL simultaneously acquired Nullsoft and Spinner.com in a combined purchase worth approximately $400 million. In a July 21, 1999 SEC filing by AOL, the transaction was recorded as a payment of 2,863,053 shares of AOL common stock to the 54 stockholders in the two companies being acquired. On July 20, 1999, the last reported sale price for AOL common stock was $113.1875 per share. Frankel&#x27;s stake of 522,661 shares in the acquisition was worth approximately $59 million.

== AOL ==

On March 14, 2000, Frankel and Nullsoft colleague Tom Pepper released &quot;Gnutella&quot;, a public peer-to-peer file-sharing application, using Nullsoft&#x27;s corporate web servers, without AOL&#x27;s knowledge. Gnutella was a new peer-to-peer file-sharing system like the original Napster system, which was used by users to share their MP3 collections with everyone who ran a Napster client. Unlike Napster, however, Gnutella allowed users to share any type of file, not just MP3s. It also did not have the single point of failure that Napster had: centralized servers that indexed where all the shared content was stored. Whereas Napster was shut off just by turning off the centralized index servers owned by Napster, gnutella did not rely on any centralized servers to find out what users had what content, so once a Gnutella network was created, it could not be shut off.

Since AOL was at the time merging with Time Warner, Gnutella seemed like a conflict of interest to Nullsoft&#x27;s parent company, which knew that Time Warner was one of the parties taking legal action against Napster at the time. AOL ordered Gnutella to be taken off the Nullsoft corporate servers. However, thousands of people had already downloaded the software before it was removed from Nullsoft&#x27;s web site. The source code was released later, supposedly under the GPL. Gnutella continued to be developed without Frankel&#x27;s assistance, and became one of the most popular peer-to-peer file sharing networks of its time; compatible clients that were developed included BearShare, Morpheus, Gnucleus and LimeWire.

AOL watched Frankel very closely after that, taking down other projects that he tried to release to the public, such as an MP3 search engine and a patch for AOL Instant Messenger to block advertisements in the application. Frankel threatened to resign on June 2, 2003, after AOL removed his program &quot;WASTE&quot;, a private peer-to-peer file-sharing program, from the Nullsoft website. He stayed with AOL after that in order to complete Winamp version 5.0, a hybrid of the Winamp v2.x series and Winamp v3.

On December 9, 2003 AOL shut down Nullsoft&#x27;s San Francisco offices and laid off 450 employees.

Frankel announced his resignation from AOL on January 22, 2004 on his blog, stating &quot;Won&#x27;t repeat it here (in two words: I&#x27;ve resigned). So begins chapter 3... or something cliché/poetic there. Or wait, does I&#x27;ve count as a single word? ha ha.&quot;

== Post-AOL ==

Some of Frankel&#x27;s current projects in development are a programmable effects processor called Jesusonic and a piece of software named NINJAM which allows several musicians to make music together via the Internet.

Under his new company, Cockos, he has been developing REAPER, a digital audio workstation for Microsoft Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

<text>Paul Éluard (), born Eugène Émile Paul Grindel (; 14 December 1895 – 18 November 1952), was a French poet and one of the founders of the Surrealist movement.

In 1916, he chose the name Paul Éluard, a matronymic borrowed from his maternal grandmother. He adhered to Dadaism and became one of the pillars of Surrealism by opening the way to artistic action politically committed to the Communist Party.

During World War II, he was the author of several poems against Nazism that circulated clandestinely. He became known worldwide as The Poet of &quot;Freedom&quot; and is considered the most gifted of French surrealist poets.

===Early life===
Éluard was born on 14 December 1895 in Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis, the son of Eugène Clément Grindel and wife Jeanne-Marie née Cousin. His father was an accountant when Paul was born but soon opened a real-estate agency. His mother was a seamstress. Around 1908, the family moved to Paris, rue Louis Blanc. Éluard attended the local school in Aulnay-sous-Bois, before obtaining a scholarship to attend the École Supérieure de Colbert. At the age of 16, he contracted tuberculosis, interrupted his studies, and remained hospitalized until April 1914 in the Clavadel sanatorium near Davos.

There he met a young Russian girl of his age, Helena Diakonova, whom he nicknamed Gala. He confided to her his dream of becoming a poet, of his admiration for &quot;poets dead of hunger, sizzling dreams&quot; and of his parents&#x27; disapproval. She wrote to him that &quot;you will become a great poet&quot;. They became inseparable. She believed in him and gave him confidence and encouragement and provided him with the sense of security he needed to write. She listened and was involved in the creation of his verses. She became his muse and the critic, always honest, and told him which images she preferred, which verses she disliked. He was then particularly inspired by Walt Whitman. In Clavadel, Éluard also met the Brazilian youngster Manuel Bandeira, who would become one of the foremost poets of the Portuguese language. They became friends during their hospitalization in the sanatorium, and kept in touch by mail after returning to their respective countries.

===First World War===
In April 1914, Éluard and Gala were both declared healthy again and sent home, to Paris and Moscow respectively. The separation was brutal; soon Europe was on the brink of war and Éluard was mobilised. He passed his physical and was assigned to the auxiliary services because of his poor health. He suffered from migraine, bronchitis, cerebral anaemia, and chronic appendicitis and spent most of 1915 under treatment in a military hospital not far from home. Éluard&#x27;s mother came to visit him and he talked for hours about his beloved, opening his heart to her and slowly rallying her to his cause. Her initial hostility towards Gala slowly faded away, and she started calling her &quot;the little Russian&quot;. However, Éluard&#x27;s father, who had also been mobilized, remained adamant that she could not come to Paris.

In Moscow, Gala listened to no one. Her love for Éluard gave her an unshakable faith that they would be reunited again. She wrote to his mother to befriend her and finally convinced her stepfather to let her go to Paris to study French at the Sorbonne. She took a boat to Helsinki, then reached Stockholm before embarking for England. Once in London, she took a train to Southampton before taking a boat to Dieppe, and finally took a train to Paris.

In June 1916, Éluard was sent to Hargicourt to work in one of the military evacuation hospitals, 10 kilometers from the front line. The &#x27;poet&#x27; was given a chair, a desk, and a pen to painfully write to the families of the dead and the wounded. He wrote more than 150 letters a day. At night, he dug graves to bury the dead. For the first time since Clavadel, shaken by the horrors of the war, he started writing verses again. Gala wrote to him: &quot;I promise you our life will be glorious and magnificent.&quot;

On 14 December 1916, Éluard turned 21 and wrote to his mother: &quot;I can assure you, that your approval will be infinitely precious to me. However, for all our sake, nothing will change my mind.&quot; He married Gala on 20 February 1917. However, he announced to his parents and newlywed wife that when he returned to the front line, he would voluntarily join the &quot;real soldiers&quot; in the trenches. Gala protested and threatened to return to Russia to become a nurse on the Russian front. But nothing would do, and for the first time, Éluard resisted her. &quot;Let me live a tougher life,&quot; he wrote her, &quot;less like a servant, less like a domestic.&quot; Two days after getting married, Éluard left for the front line.

There, living conditions were severe. Éluard wrote to his parents, &quot;Even the strongest are falling. We advanced 50 kilometres, three days without bread or wine.&quot; His health suffered. On 20 March 1917, he was sent to a military hospital with incipient pleurisy.

On 11 May 1918, Gala gave birth to a baby girl who was eventually named Cécile (died 10 August 2016).

===Interwar period===
In 1919, Éluard wrote to Gala: &quot;War is coming to an end. We will now fight for happiness after having fought for Life&quot;. Waiting to be sent home, he published &quot;Duty and Anxiety&quot; and &quot;Little Poems for Peace&quot;. Following the advice of his publisher, he sent the poems to various personalities of the literary world who took a stand against the war. Gala helped him to prepare and send the letters.
In 1919, Jean Paulhan, an eminent academic and writer, responded to his letter expressing his admiration. He referred him to three young writers who had started a new journal called &quot;Literature&quot;. He encouraged Éluard to go and meet them.

The three young poets Paulhan recommended to Éluard were André Breton, Philippe Soupault, and Louis Aragon.

The meeting with Éluard took place in March 1919. Éluard was intimidated. He was shy and blushing. He was still a soldier and wearing his war uniform. It was the best omen for the three poets, who all showed great courage during the war. Éluard brought with him his poems and read them to the &quot;jury&quot;. They were seduced by the young man and liked his work. They decided to publish one of his texts in the next edition of &quot;Littérature&quot;.

Wounded and scarred by the war, the four poets found solace in their friendship and poetry. Against a society that wanted to channel them into being good and useful citizens, they chose a life of bohemia. They refused the bourgeois middle-class aspirations of money, respectability, and comfort and rejected its moral codes. They hated politicians and the military or anyone with ambitions of power. They rejected all constraints. Their ideal was freedom and they felt they had already paid the price for it. Revolted and passionate, they were looking for a new ideal, something as far detached as possible from the current political and philosophical programmes. They found solace in the Dadaist movement, which originated in Switzerland.

In November 1921, Éluard and Gala visited Max Ernst at his home in Cologne. Éluard had an immediate and an absolute sympathy for Max. Underneath the charm, Ernst, like Éluard, was a man deeply revolted, in total rupture with society. Unlike Éluard, however, Ernst remained indifferent to propagating this revolt which he considered to be an intimate &quot;elegance&quot;.

Éluard and Gala moved to a house just outside Paris and were joined by Max Ernst, who entered France illegally, using Éluard&#x27;s passport. Jean Paulhan once more helped Éluard by providing Ernst with fake identity papers. Éluard, Ernst, and Gala entered into a ménage à trois in 1922. Éluard was torn between his love for Gala and his friendship for Ernst. He refused to challenge Gala, and spent his nights in clubs: the Zelli, the Cyrano, the Parrot, and Mitchell. Gala&#x27;s well-being was still what mattered to him above all and he tried to forget his anxiety by drinking.

Éluard, depressed, wrote &quot;Dying of Not Dying&quot;. On 24 March 1924, he disappeared. No one knew where he was. The night before, he had had a worrisome meeting with Louis Aragon, during which Éluard confessed that he wanted to put an end to a present that tortured him. For his friends, he was gone forever. But Éluard wrote to Gala and four months later, she bought a ticket to go and find him and bring him back, locating him in Saigon.

Éluard supported the Moroccan Revolution, as early as 1925, and in January 1927, he joined the French Communist Party together with Aragon, Breton, Benjamin Péret, and Pierre Unik. All explained their decision in a collective document entitled &quot;Au grand jour&quot;. It was during these years that Éluard published two of his main works: &quot;Capitale de la douleur&quot; (1926) and &quot;L&#x27;Amour la Poésie&quot; (1929). Éluard&#x27;s poetry collection &quot;L&#x27;Évidence Poétique Habitude de la Poésie&quot; was translated into Arabic and published in the Egyptian magazine &quot;Al Tatawwur&quot; in 1940.

In 1928, he had another bout of tuberculosis and returned to the Clavadel sanatorium with Gala. It was their last winter together. Gala met Salvador Dalí soon after and remained with him for the rest of her life.

===1930s===
In 1934, Éluard married Nusch (Maria Benz), a music hall artist, whom he had met through his friends Man Ray and Pablo Picasso.

The period from 1931 to 1935 were among Éluard&#x27;s happiest years. He was excluded from the French Communist Party. He travelled through Europe as an ambassador of the Surrealist movement. In 1936, in Spain, he learned of the Franquist counterrevolution, against which he protested violently. The following year, the bombing of Guernica inspired him to write the poem &quot;The Victory of Guernica&quot;. During these two terrible years for Spain, Éluard and Picasso were inseparable. The poet told the painter: &quot;You hold the flame between your fingers and paint like a fire.&quot;

===Second World War===
Mobilized in September 1939, he moved to Paris with Nusch after the Armistice of 22 June 1940. In January 1942, he sent her to the home of some of his friends, Christian and Yvonne Zervos, near Vézelay—near the maquis. Éluard asked to rejoin the French Communist Party, which was illegal in Occupied France. Thousands of copies of the twenty-one stanzas of his poem &quot;Liberté&quot;, first published in the &quot;Choix revue&quot;, were parachuted from British aircraft over Occupied France. During the war, he also wrote &quot;Les sept poèmes d&#x27;amour en guerre&quot; (1944) and &quot;En Avril 1944: Paris Respirait Encore!&quot; (1945, illustrated by Jean Hugo).

In 1943, together with Pierre Seghers, François Lachenal, and Jean Lescure, he assembled the texts of several poets of the Resistance in a controversial book called &quot;L&#x27;Honneur des poètes&quot; (&quot;The Honour of Poets&quot;). Faced with oppression, the poets eulogised in it hope and freedom. In November 1943, Éluard found refuge in the mental asylum of Saint-Alban, headed by doctor Lucien Bonnafé, in which many resistants and Jews were hiding. At Libération, Éluard and Aragon were hailed as the great poets of the Resistance.

===Post-war===
On 28 November 1946, during a stay in Switzerland, Éluard learned of Nusch&#x27;s sudden death from a stroke. Distraught, he became extremely depressed. Two friends, Alain and Jacqueline Trutat (for whom Éluard wrote &quot;Corps mémorable&quot;), gave him back the will to live.

His grief at the premature death of his wife Nusch in 1946 inspired the work &quot;Le temps déborde&quot; in 1947, as well as &quot;De l&#x27;horizon à l&#x27;horizon de tous&quot;, which traced the path that led Éluard from suffering to hope.

The principles of peace, self-government, and liberty became his new passion. He was a member of the Congress of Intellectuals for Peace in Wrocław in April 1948, which persuaded Pablo Picasso to also join. The following year, in April, he was a delegate to the Council for World Peace, at the conference held at the Salle Pleyel in Paris. In June 1949, he spent a few days with Greek partisans entrenched on the Gramos hills to fight against Greek government soldiers. He then went to Budapest to attend the commemorative celebrations of the centenary of the death of the poet Sándor Petőfi. There he met Pablo Neruda. In September, he was in Mexico for a new peace conference. There he met Dominique Lemort, with whom he returned to France. They married in 1951. The same year, Éluard published &quot;Le Phénix&quot; (&quot;The Phoenix&quot;), a collection of poems dedicated to his reborn happiness. Among his best known quotations is: &quot;There are other worlds, but they are all inside this one&quot;.
He later eulogised Joseph Stalin in his political writings. He even wrote a poem — &quot;Ode à Staline&quot; — for him. Milan Kundera recalled that he was shocked to hear of Éluard&#x27;s public approval of the hanging of Éluard&#x27;s friend, the Prague writer Záviš Kalandra in 1950.

===Death===
Paul Éluard died from a heart attack on 18 November 1952 at his home, 52 avenue de Gravelle, in Charenton-le-Pont. His funeral was held at the Père Lachaise Cemetery, and organized by the French Communist Party; the French government having refused to organise a national funeral for political reasons. A crowd of thousands spontaneously gathered in the streets of Paris to accompany his casket to the cemetery. That day, Robert Sabatier wrote: &quot;the whole world was mourning&quot;.

<text>Bonnie Elizabeth Parker (October 1, 1910May 23, 1934) and Clyde Chestnut &quot;Champion&quot; Barrow (March 24, 1909May 23, 1934) were American outlaws who traveled the Central United States with their gang during the Great Depression, committing a series of criminal acts such as bank robberies, kidnappings, and murders between 1932 and 1934. The couple were known for their bank robberies and multiple murders, although they preferred to rob small stores or rural gas stations. Their exploits captured the attention of the American press and its readership during what is occasionally referred to as the &quot;public enemy era&quot; between 1931 and 1934. They were ambushed by police and shot dead in Bienville Parish, Louisiana. They are believed to have murdered at least nine police officers and four civilians.

The 1967 film &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot;, directed by Arthur Penn and starring Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway in the title roles, was a critical and commercial success which revived interest in the criminals and glamorized them with a romantic aura. The 2019 Netflix film &quot;The Highwaymen&quot; depicted their manhunt from the point of view of the pursuing lawmen.

==Bonnie Parker==

Bonnie Elizabeth Parker was born in 1910 in Rowena, Texas, the second of three children. Her father, Charles Robert Parker (1884–1914), was a bricklayer who died when Bonnie was four years old. Her widowed mother, Emma (Krause) Parker (1885–1944), moved her family back to her parents&#x27; home in Cement City, an industrial suburb in West Dallas where she worked as a seamstress. As an adult, Bonnie wrote poems such as &quot;The Story of Suicide Sal&quot; and &quot;The Trail&#x27;s End&quot;, the latter more commonly known as &quot;The Story of Bonnie and Clyde&quot;.

Parker was a bright child who thrived on attention. She enjoyed performing on stage and dreamt of becoming an actress. In her second year in high school, Parker met Roy Thornton (1908–1937). The couple dropped out of school and married on September 25, 1926, six days before her 16th birthday. Their marriage was marred by his frequent absences and brushes with the law and proved to be short-lived. They never divorced, but their paths never crossed again after January 1929. Parker was still wearing the wedding ring Thornton had given her when she died. Thornton was in prison when he heard of her death, commenting, &quot;I&#x27;m glad they jumped out like they did. It&#x27;s much better than being caught.&quot; Sentenced to five years for robbery in 1933 and after attempting several prison breaks from other facilities, Thornton was killed while trying to escape from the Huntsville State Prison on October 3, 1937.

After she left Thornton, Parker moved back in with her mother and worked as a waitress in Dallas. One of her regular customers was postal worker Ted Hinton. In 1932, he joined the Dallas County Sheriff&#x27;s Department and eventually served as a member of the that killed Bonnie and Clyde. Parker briefly kept a diary early in 1929 when she was aged 18, writing of her loneliness, her impatience with life in Dallas, and her love of photography.

== Clyde Barrow ==

Clyde Chestnut Barrow was born in 1909 into a poor farming family in the town of Telico in Ellis County, Texas. He was the fifth of seven children of Henry Basil Barrow (1874–1957) and Cumie Talitha Walker (1874–1942). The family moved to Dallas in the early 1920s as part of a wider migration pattern from rural areas to the city, where many settled in the urban slum of West Dallas. The Barrows spent their first months in West Dallas living under their wagon until they got enough money to buy a tent.

Barrow was first arrested in late 1926, at age 17, after running when police confronted him over a rental car that he had failed to return on time. His second arrest was with his brother Buck Barrow soon after, for possession of stolen turkeys. Barrow had some legitimate jobs from 1927 through 1929, but he also cracked safes, robbed stores, and stole cars. He met 19-year-old Parker through a mutual friend in January 1930, and they spent much time together during the following weeks. Their romance was interrupted when Barrow was arrested by Dallas County Sheriff&#x27;s Deputy Bert Whisnand and convicted of auto theft. He escaped from the McLennan County Jail in Waco, TX, on March 11, 1930, using a gun Parker smuggled into the jail.

Recaptured on March 18, Barrow was sent to Huntsville State Prison in April 1930 and in September he was assigned to the Eastham Prison Farm at the age of 21. He was sexually assaulted while in prison, and he retaliated by attacking and killing his tormentor with a pipe, crushing his skull. This was his first murder. Another inmate who was already serving a life sentence claimed responsibility.

To avoid hard labor in the fields, Barrow purposely had two of his toes amputated in late January 1932, either by another inmate or by himself. Because of this, he walked with a limp for the rest of his life. However, without his knowledge, Barrow&#x27;s mother had already successfully petitioned for his release and he was set free six days after his intentional injury. He was paroled from Eastham on February 2, 1932, now a hardened and bitter criminal. His sister Marie said, &quot;Something awful sure must have happened to him in prison because he wasn&#x27;t the same person when he got out.&quot; Fellow inmate Ralph Fults said that he watched Clyde &quot;change from a school boy to a rattlesnake&quot;.

In his post-Eastham career, Barrow robbed grocery stores and gas stations at a rate far outpacing the ten or so bank robberies attributed to him and the Barrow Gang. His favorite weapon was the M1918 Browning automatic rifle (BAR). According to John Neal Phillips, Barrow&#x27;s goal in life was not to gain fame or fortune from robbing banks but to seek revenge against the Texas prison system for the abuses that he had sustained while serving time. The injury slowed him down physically, making it harder to outrun law enforcement and limiting his mobility during his many robberies.

== First meeting ==
There are several different accounts of Parker and Barrow&#x27;s first meeting. One of the more credible versions is that they met on January 5, 1930, at the home of Barrow&#x27;s friend, Clarence Clay, at 105 Herbert Street in West Dallas. Barrow was 20 years old, and Parker was 19. Parker was out of work and staying with a female friend to assist her during her recovery from a broken arm. Barrow dropped by the girl&#x27;s house while Parker was in the kitchen making hot chocolate. 

== Armed robbery and murder ==
=== 1932: Early robberies and murders ===

After Barrow&#x27;s release from prison in February 1932, he and Ralph Fults began a series of robberies, primarily of stores and gas stations. Their goal was to collect enough money and firepower to launch a raid against Eastham prison. On April 19, Parker and Fults were captured in a failed hardware store burglary in Kaufman in which they had intended to steal firearms. Parker was released from jail after a few months, when the grand jury failed to indict her. Fults was tried, convicted, and served time. He never rejoined the gang. Parker wrote poetry to pass the time in Kaufman County jail, and reunited with Barrow within a few weeks of her release.

On April 30, Barrow was the getaway driver in a robbery in Hillsboro, during which store owner J.N. Bucher was shot and killed. Bucher&#x27;s wife identified Barrow from police photographs as one of the shooters, although he had stayed inside the car.

On August 5, Barrow, Raymond Hamilton, and Ross Dyer were drinking moonshine at a country dance in Stringtown, Oklahoma, when Sheriff C.G. Maxwell and Deputy Eugene C. Moore approached them in the parking lot. Barrow and Hamilton opened fire, killing Moore and gravely wounding Maxwell. Moore was the first law officer whom Barrow and his gang killed. They eventually murdered nine. On October 11, they allegedly killed Howard Hall at his store during a robbery in Sherman, Texas, though some historians consider this unlikely.

W. D. Jones had been a friend of Barrow&#x27;s family since childhood. He joined Parker and Barrow on Christmas Eve 1932 at the age of 16, and the three left Dallas that night. The next day, Christmas Day 1932, Jones and Barrow murdered Doyle Johnson, a young family man, while stealing his car in Temple. Barrow killed Tarrant County Deputy Malcolm Davis on January 6, 1933, when he, Parker, and Jones wandered into a police trap set for another criminal. The gang had murdered five people since April.

=== 1933: Buck and Blanche Barrow join the gang ===

On March 22, 1933, Clyde&#x27;s brother Buck was granted a full pardon and released from prison, and he and his wife Blanche set up housekeeping with Bonnie, Clyde and Jones in a temporary hideout at 3347 1/2 Oakridge Drive in Joplin, Missouri. According to family sources, Buck and Blanche were there to visit; they attempted to persuade Clyde to surrender to law enforcement. The group ran loud, alcohol-fueled card games late into the night in the quiet neighborhood; Blanche recalled that they &quot;bought a case of beer a day&quot;. The men came and went noisily at all hours, and Clyde accidentally fired a Browning automatic rifle (BAR) in the apartment while cleaning it. No neighbors went to the house, but one reported suspicions to the Joplin Police Department.

The police assembled a five-man force in two cars on April 13 to confront what they suspected were bootleggers living at the Oakridge Drive address. The Barrow brothers and Jones opened fire, killing Detective Harry L. McGinnis outright and fatally wounding Constable J. W. Harryman. Parker opened fire with a BAR as the others fled, forcing Highway Patrol Sergeant G.B. Kahler to duck behind a large oak tree. The .30 caliber bullets from the BAR struck the tree and forced wood splinters into the sergeant&#x27;s face. Parker got into the car with the others, and they pulled in Blanche from the street where she was pursuing her dog Snow Ball. The surviving officers later testified that they had fired only fourteen rounds in the conflict; one hit Jones on the side, one struck Clyde but was deflected by his suit-coat button, and one grazed Buck after ricocheting off a wall.


The group escaped the police at Joplin, but left behind most of their possessions at the apartment, including Buck&#x27;s parole papers (three weeks old), a large arsenal of weapons, a handwritten poem by Bonnie, and a camera with several rolls of undeveloped film. Police developed the film at &quot;The Joplin Globe&quot; and found many photos of Barrow, Parker, and Jones posing and pointing weapons at one another. The &quot;Globe&quot; sent the poem and the photos over the newswire, including a photo of Parker clenching a cigar in her teeth and a pistol in her hand. The Barrow Gang subsequently became front-page news throughout America.

The photo of Parker posing with a cigar and a gun became popular. In his book &quot;Go Down Together: The True, Untold Story of Bonnie and Clyde&quot;, writer Jeff Guinn noted:

The group ranged from Texas as far north as Minnesota for the next three months. In May, they tried to rob the bank in Lucerne, Indiana, and robbed the bank in Okabena, Minnesota. They kidnapped Dillard Darby and Sophia Stone at Ruston, Louisiana, in the course of stealing Darby&#x27;s car; this was one of several events between 1932 and 1934 in which they kidnapped police officers or robbery victims. They usually released their hostages far from home, sometimes with money to help them return.

Stories of such encounters made headlines, as did the more violent episodes. The Barrow Gang did not hesitate to shoot anyone who got in their way, whether it was a police officer or an innocent civilian. Other members of the gang who committed murder included Hamilton, Jones, Buck, and Henry Methvin. Eventually, the cold-bloodedness of their murders opened the public&#x27;s eyes to the reality of their crimes, and led to their ends.

The photos entertained the public for a time, but the gang was desperate and discontented, as described by Blanche in her account written while imprisoned in the late 1930s. With their new notoriety, their daily lives became more difficult as they tried to evade discovery. Restaurants and motels became less secure; they resorted to campfire cooking and bathing in cold streams. The unrelieved, round-the-clock proximity of five people in one car gave rise to vicious bickering. Jones was the driver when he and Barrow stole a car belonging to Darby in late April, and he used that car to leave the others. He stayed away until June 8.

Barrow failed to see warning signs at a bridge under construction on June 10, while driving with Jones and Parker near Wellington, Texas, and the car flipped into a ravine. Sources disagree on whether there was a gasoline fire or if Parker was doused with acid from the car&#x27;s battery under the floorboards, but she sustained third-degree burns to her right leg, so severe that the muscles contracted and caused the leg to &quot;draw up&quot;. Jones observed: &quot;She&#x27;d been burned so bad none of us thought she was gonna live. The hide on her right leg was gone, from her hip down to her ankle. I could see the bone at places.&quot;

Parker could hardly walk; she either hopped on her good leg or was carried by Barrow. They got help from a nearby farm family, then kidnapped Collinsworth County Sheriff George Corry and City Marshal Paul Hardy, leaving the two of them handcuffed and barbed-wired to a tree outside Erick, Oklahoma. The three rendezvoused with Buck and Blanche, and hid in a tourist court near Fort Smith, Arkansas, nursing Parker&#x27;s burns. Buck and Jones bungled a robbery and murdered Town Marshal Henry D. Humphrey in Alma, Arkansas. The criminals had to flee, despite Parker&#x27;s grave condition.

=== Platte City ===

In July 1933, the gang checked in to the Red Crown Tourist Court south of Platte City, Missouri. It consisted of two brick cabins joined by garages, and the gang rented both. To the south stood the Red Crown Tavern, a popular restaurant among Missouri Highway Patrolmen, and the gang seemed to go out of their way to draw attention. Blanche registered the party as three guests, but owner Neal Houser could see five people getting out of the car. He noted that the driver backed into the garage &quot;gangster style&quot; for a quick getaway.
Blanche paid for their cabins with coins rather than bills, and did the same later when buying five dinners and five beers. The next day, Houser noticed that his guests had taped newspapers over the windows of their cabin; Blanche again paid for five meals with coins. Her outfit of jodhpur riding breeches also attracted attention; they were not typical attire for women in the area, and eyewitnesses still remembered them 40 years later. Houser told Captain William Baxter of the Highway Patrol, a patron of his restaurant, about the group.

Barrow and Jones went into town to purchase bandages, crackers, cheese, and atropine sulfate to treat Parker&#x27;s leg. The druggist contacted Sheriff Holt Coffey, who put the cabins under surveillance. Coffey had been alerted by Oklahoma, Texas, and Arkansas law enforcement to watch for strangers seeking such supplies. The sheriff contacted Captain Baxter, who called for reinforcements from Kansas City, including an armored car. Sheriff Coffey led a group of officers toward the cabins at 11 p.m. on July 20, 1933, armed with Thompson submachine guns.
In the gunfight that ensued, the officers&#x27; .45 caliber Thompsons proved no match for Barrow&#x27;s .30 caliber BAR, stolen on July 7 from the National Guard armory at Enid, Oklahoma. The gang escaped when a bullet short-circuited the horn on the armored car and the police officers mistook it for a cease-fire signal. They did not pursue the retreating Barrow vehicle.

The gang had evaded the law once again, but Buck had been wounded by a bullet that blasted a large hole in the bone of his forehead and exposed his injured brain. Blanche was also nearly blinded by glass fragments.

=== Dexfield Park ===
The Barrow Gang camped at Dexfield Park, an abandoned amusement park near Dexter, Iowa, on July 24, 1933. Buck was sometimes semiconscious, and he even talked and ate, but his massive head wound and loss of blood were so severe that Barrow and Jones dug a grave for him. Residents noticed their bloody bandages, and officers determined that the campers were the Barrow Gang. Local police officers and approximately 100 spectators surrounded the group, and the Barrows soon came under fire. Barrow, Parker, and Jones escaped on foot. Buck was shot in the back, and he and his wife were captured by the officers. Buck died of his head wound and pneumonia after surgery five days later at Kings Daughters Hospital in Perry, Iowa.

For the next six weeks, the remaining perpetrators ranged far afield from their usual area of operations, west to Colorado, north to Minnesota, southeast to Mississippi; yet they continued to commit armed robberies. They restocked their arsenal when Barrow and Jones robbed an armory on August 20 at Plattville, Illinois, acquiring three BARs, handguns, and a large quantity of ammunition.

By early September, the gang risked a run to Dallas to see their families for the first time in four months. Jones parted company with them, continuing to Houston where his mother had moved. He was arrested there without incident on November 16, and returned to Dallas. Through the autumn, Barrow committed several robberies with small-time local accomplices, while his family and Parker&#x27;s attended to her considerable medical needs.

On November 22, they narrowly evaded arrest while trying to meet with family members near Sowers, Texas. Dallas Sheriff Smoot Schmid, Deputy Bob Alcorn, and Deputy Ted Hinton lay in wait nearby. As Barrow drove up, he sensed a trap and drove past his family&#x27;s car, at which point Schmid and his deputies stood up and opened fire with machine guns and a BAR. The family members in the crossfire were not hit, but a BAR bullet passed through the car, striking the legs of both Barrow and Parker. They escaped later that night.

On November 28, a Dallas grand jury delivered a murder indictment against Parker and Barrow for the killing – in January of that year, nearly ten months earlier – of Tarrant County Deputy Malcolm Davis; it was Parker&#x27;s first warrant for murder.

=== 1934: Final run ===

On January 16, 1934, Barrow orchestrated the escape of Hamilton, Methvin, and several others in the &quot;Eastham Breakout.&quot; The brazen raid generated negative publicity for Texas, and Barrow seemed to have achieved what historian Phillips suggests was his overriding goal: revenge on the Texas Department of Corrections.

Barrow Gang member Joe Palmer shot Major Joe Crowson during his escape, and Crowson died a few days later in the hospital. This attack attracted the full power of the Texas and federal government to the manhunt for Barrow and Parker. As Crowson struggled for life, prison chief Lee Simmons reportedly promised him that all persons involved in the breakout would be hunted down and killed. All of them eventually were, except for Methvin, who preserved his life by turning on the gang and setting up the ambush of Barrow and Parker.

The Texas Department of Corrections contacted former Texas Ranger Captain Frank Hamer and persuaded him to hunt down the Barrow Gang. He was retired, but his commission had not expired. He accepted the assignment as a Texas Highway Patrol officer, secondarily assigned to the prison system as a special investigator, and was given the specific task of taking down the Barrow Gang.

Hamer was tall, burly, and taciturn, unimpressed by authority and driven by an &quot;inflexible adherence to right, or what he thinks is right.&quot; For twenty years, he had been feared and admired throughout Texas as &quot;the walking embodiment of the &#x27;One Riot, One Ranger&#x27; ethos&quot;. He &quot;had acquired a formidable reputation as a result of several spectacular captures and the shooting of a number of Texas criminals&quot;. He was officially credited with 53 kills, and suffered seventeen wounds.

Prison boss Simmons always said publicly that Hamer had been his first choice, although there is evidence that he first approached two other Rangers, both of whom declined because they were reluctant to shoot a woman. Starting on February 10, Hamer became the constant shadow of Barrow and Parker, living out of his car, just a town or two behind them. Three of Hamer&#x27;s four brothers were also Texas Rangers. Brother Harrison was the best shot of the four, but Frank was considered the most tenacious.

On Easter Sunday, April 1, 1934, at the intersection of Route 114 and Dove Road, near Grapevine, Texas, now Southlake, highway patrolmen H.D. Murphy and Edward Bryant Wheeler stopped their motorcycles thinking a motorist needed assistance. Barrow and Methvin or Parker opened fire with a shotgun and handgun, killing both officers. An eyewitness account said that Parker fired the fatal shots and this story received widespread coverage. Methvin later claimed that he fired the first shot after mistakenly assuming that Barrow wanted the officers killed. Barrow joined in, firing at Patrolman Murphy.
During the spring season, the Grapevine killings were recounted in exaggerated detail, affecting public perception. All four Dallas daily papers seized on the story told by the eyewitness, a farmer who claimed to have seen Parker laugh at the way that Murphy&#x27;s head &quot;bounced like a rubber ball&quot; on the ground as she shot him. The stories claimed that police found a cigar butt &quot;with tiny teeth marks&quot;, supposedly those of Parker. Several days later, Murphy&#x27;s fiancée wore her intended wedding dress to his funeral, attracting photos and newspaper coverage.

The eyewitness&#x27;s ever-changing story was soon discredited, but the massive negative publicity increased the public clamor for the extermination of the Barrow Gang. The outcry galvanized the authorities into action, and Highway Patrol boss L.G. Phares offered a reward of $1,000 (equivalent to $ in ) for &quot;the dead bodies of the Grapevine slayers&quot;—not their capture, just the bodies. Texas Governor Ma Ferguson added another reward of $500 for each of the two killers, which meant that, for the first time, &quot;there was a specific price on Bonnie&#x27;s head, since she was so widely believed to have shot H.D. Murphy&quot;.

Public hostility increased five days later, when Barrow and Methvin murdered 60-year-old Constable William &quot;Cal&quot; Campbell, a widower and father, near Commerce, Oklahoma. They kidnapped Commerce police chief Percy Boyd, crossed the state line into Kansas, then let him go, giving him a clean shirt, a few dollars, and a request from Parker to tell the world that she did not smoke cigars. Boyd identified both Barrow and Parker to authorities, but he never learned Methvin&#x27;s name. The resultant arrest warrant for the Campbell murder specified &quot;Clyde Barrow, Bonnie Parker and John Doe&quot;. Historian Knight writes: &quot;For the first time, Bonnie was seen as a killer, actually pulling the trigger—just like Clyde. Whatever chance she had for clemency had just been reduced.&quot; &quot;The Dallas Journal&quot; ran a cartoon on its editorial page, showing an empty electric chair with a sign on it saying &quot;Reserved&quot;, adding the words &quot;Clyde and Bonnie&quot;.

== Ambush and deaths ==
By May 1934, Barrow had 16 warrants outstanding against him for multiple counts of robbery, auto theft, theft, escape, assault, and murder in four states. Hamer, who had begun tracking the gang on February 12, led the posse. He had studied the gang&#x27;s movements and found that they swung in a circle skirting the edges of five mid-western states, exploiting the &quot;state line&quot; rule that prevented officers from pursuing a fugitive into another jurisdiction. Barrow was consistent in his movements, so Hamer charted his path and predicted where he would go. The gang&#x27;s itinerary centered on family visits, and they were due to see Methvin&#x27;s family in Louisiana. Unbeknownst to Hamer, Barrow had designated Methvin&#x27;s parents&#x27; residence as a rendezvous in case they were separated. Methvin had become separated from the rest of the gang in Shreveport. Hamer&#x27;s posse was composed of six men: Texas officers Hamer, Hinton, Alcorn, and B.M. &quot;Maney&quot; Gault, and Louisiana officers Henderson Jordan and Prentiss Morel Oakley.

On May 21, the four posse members from Texas were in Shreveport when they learned that Barrow and Parker were planning to visit Ivy Methvin in Bienville Parish that evening. The full posse set up an ambush along Louisiana State Highway 154 south of Gibsland toward Sailes. Hinton recounted that the lawmen were in place by 9 pm, and waited through the whole of the next day (May 22) with no sign of the perpetrators. Other accounts said that the officers set up on the evening of May 22.

At approximately 9:15 am on May 23, the posse was still concealed in the bushes and almost ready to give up when they heard a vehicle approaching at high speed. In their official report, they stated they had persuaded Methvin to position his truck on the shoulder of the road that morning. They hoped Barrow would stop to speak with him, putting his vehicle close to the posse&#x27;s position in the bushes. The vehicle proved to be the Ford V8 with Barrow at the wheel and he slowed down as hoped. The six lawmen opened fire while the vehicle was still moving. Oakley fired first, probably before any order to do so. Barrow was shot in the head and died instantly from Oakley&#x27;s first shot and Hinton reported hearing Parker scream. The officers fired about 130 rounds, emptying each of their weapons into the car. The two had survived several bullet wounds over the years in their confrontations with the law. On this day, any of Bonnie Parker&#x27;s and Clyde Barrow&#x27;s wounds would have proven to be fatal.

According to statements made by Hinton and Alcorn:

Film footage taken by one of the deputies immediately after the ambush shows 112 bullet holes in the vehicle, of which around one quarter struck the couple. The official report by parish coroner J. L. Wade listed 17 entrance wounds on Barrow&#x27;s body and 26 on that of Parker, including several headshots to each and one that had severed Barrow&#x27;s spinal column. Undertaker C. F. &quot;Boots&quot; Bailey had difficulty embalming the bodies because of all the bullet holes.

The deafened officers inspected the vehicle and discovered an arsenal, including stolen automatic rifles, sawed-off semi-automatic shotguns, assorted handguns, and several thousand rounds of ammunition, along with fifteen sets of license plates from various states. Hamer stated: &quot;I hate to bust the cap on a woman, especially when she was sitting down, however if it wouldn&#x27;t have been her, it would have been us.&quot; Word of the deaths quickly got around when Hamer, Jordan, Oakley, and Hinton drove into town to telephone their bosses. A crowd soon gathered at the spot. Gault and Alcorn were left to guard the bodies, but they lost control of the jostling, curious throng; one woman cut off bloody locks of Parker&#x27;s hair and pieces from her dress, which were subsequently sold as souvenirs. Hinton returned to find a man trying to cut off Barrow&#x27;s trigger finger, and was sickened by what was occurring. Arriving at the scene, the coroner reported:

Hinton enlisted Hamer&#x27;s help in controlling the &quot;circus-like atmosphere&quot; and they got people away from the car.

The posse towed the Ford, with the dead bodies still inside, to the Conger Furniture Store &amp; Funeral Parlor in downtown Arcadia, Louisiana. Preliminary embalming was done by Bailey in a small preparation room in the back of the furniture store, as it was common for furniture stores and undertakers to share the same space. The population of the northwest Louisiana town reportedly swelled from 2,000 to 12,000 within hours. Curious throngs arrived by train, horseback, carriage, and plane. Beer normally sold for 15 cents a bottle but it jumped to 25 cents, and sandwiches quickly sold out. Henry Barrow identified his son&#x27;s body, then sat weeping in a rocking chair in the furniture section.

H.D. Darby was an undertaker at the McClure Funeral Parlor and Sophia Stone was a home demonstration agent, both from nearby Ruston. Both of them came to Arcadia to identify the bodies because the Barrow gang had kidnapped them in 1933. Parker reportedly had laughed when she discovered that Darby was an undertaker. She remarked that maybe someday he would be working on her; Darby did assist Bailey in the embalming.

=== Funeral and burial ===
Bonnie and Clyde wished to be buried side by side, but the Parker family would not allow it. Her mother wanted to grant her final wish to be brought home, but the mobs surrounding the Parker house made that impossible. More than 20,000 attended Parker&#x27;s funeral, and her family had difficulty reaching her gravesite. Parker&#x27;s services were held on May 26. Allen Campbell recalled that flowers came from everywhere, including some with cards allegedly from Pretty Boy Floyd and John Dillinger. The largest floral tribute was sent by a group of Dallas city newsboys; the sudden end of Bonnie and Clyde sold 500,000 newspapers in Dallas alone. Parker was buried in the Fishtrap Cemetery, although her body was moved in 1945 to the new Crown Hill Cemetery in Dallas.

Thousands of people gathered outside both Dallas funeral homes, hoping for a chance to view the bodies. Barrow&#x27;s private funeral was held at sunset on May 25. He was buried in Western Heights Cemetery in Dallas, next to his brother Marvin. The Barrow brothers share a single granite marker with their names on it and an epitaph selected by Clyde: &quot;Gone but not forgotten.&quot;

The American National Insurance Company of Galveston, Texas, paid the life insurance policies in full on Barrow and Parker. Since then, the policy of payouts has changed to exclude payouts in cases of deaths caused by any criminal act by the insured.

The six men of the posse were each to receive a one-sixth share of the reward money. Dallas Sheriff Schmid had promised Hinton that this would total some $26,000, but most of the organizations that had pledged reward funds reneged on their pledges. In the end, each lawman earned $200.23 for his efforts and collected memorabilia.

By the summer of 1934, new federal statutes made bank robbery and kidnapping federal offenses. The growing coordination of local authorities by the FBI, plus two-way radios in police cars, combined to make it more difficult to carry out series of robberies and murders than it had been just months before. Two months after Bonnie and Clyde were killed in Gibsland, Dillinger was killed on the street in Chicago. Three months after that, Pretty Boy Floyd was killed in Ohio. One month after that, Baby Face Nelson was killed in Illinois.

As of 2018, Parker&#x27;s niece and last known surviving relative has campaigned to have her aunt buried next to Barrow.

== Differing accounts ==
The members of the posse came from three organizations: Hamer and Gault were both former Texas Rangers then working for the Texas Department of Corrections (DOC), Hinton and Alcorn were employees of the Dallas Sheriff&#x27;s office, and Jordan and Oakley were Sheriff and Deputy of Bienville Parish, Louisiana. The three duos distrusted one another and kept to themselves, and each had its own agenda in the operation and offered differing narratives of it. Simmons, the head of the Texas DOC, brought another perspective, having effectively commissioned the posse.

Schmid had tried to arrest Barrow in Sowers, Texas in November 1933. Schmid called &quot;Halt!&quot; and gunfire erupted from the outlaw car, which made a quick U-turn and sped away. Schmid&#x27;s Thompson submachine gun jammed on the first round, and he could not get off one shot. Pursuit of Barrow was impossible because the posse had parked their cars at a distance to prevent them from being seen.

The posse discussed calling &quot;halt&quot;, but the four Texans Hamer, Gault, Hinton, and Alcorn &quot;vetoed the idea&quot;, telling them that the killers&#x27; history had always been to shoot their way out, as had occurred in Platte City, Dexfield Park, and Sowers. When the ambush occurred, Oakley stood up and opened fire, and the other officers opened fire immediately after. Jordan was reported to have called out to Barrow; Alcorn said that Hamer called out; and Hinton claimed that Alcorn did. In another report, each said that they both did. These conflicting claims might have been collegial attempts to divert the focus from Oakley, who later admitted firing too early, but that is merely speculation.

In 1979, Hinton&#x27;s account of the saga was published posthumously as &quot;Ambush: The Real Story of Bonnie and Clyde&quot;. His version of the Methvin family&#x27;s involvement in the planning and execution of the ambush was that the posse had tied Methvin&#x27;s father Ivy to a tree the previous night to keep him from warning off the couple. Hinton claimed that Hamer made a deal with Ivy: if he kept quiet about being tied up, his son would escape prosecution for the two Grapevine murders. Hinton alleged that Hamer made every member of the posse swear that they would never divulge this secret. Other accounts place Ivy at the center of the action, not tied up but on the road, waving for Barrow to stop.

Hinton&#x27;s memoir suggests that Parker&#x27;s cigar in the famous &quot;cigar photo&quot; had been a ruse, and that it was retouched as a cigar by darkroom staff at the &quot;Joplin Globe&quot; while they prepared the photo for publication. Guinn says that some people who knew Hinton suspect that &quot;he became delusional late in life&quot;.

== Victims ==

== Aftermath ==

=== Personal effects===
The posse never received the promised bounty on the perpetrators, so they were told to take whatever they wanted from the confiscated items in their car. Hamer appropriated the arsenal of stolen guns and ammunition, plus a box of fishing tackle, under the terms of his compensation package with the Texas DOC. In July, Clyde&#x27;s mother Cumie wrote to Hamer asking for the return of the guns: &quot;You don&#x27;t ever want to forget my boy was never tried in no court for murder, and no one is guilty until proven guilty by some court so I hope you will answer this letter and also return the guns I am asking for.&quot; There is no record of any response.

Alcorn claimed Barrow&#x27;s saxophone from the car, but he later returned it to the Barrow family. Posse members took other personal items, such as Parker&#x27;s clothing. The Parker family asked for them back but were refused, and the items were later sold as souvenirs. The Barrow family claimed that Sheriff Jordan kept an alleged suitcase of cash, and writer Jeff Guinn claims that Jordan bought a &quot;barn and land in Arcadia&quot; soon after the event, thereby hinting that the accusation had merit, despite the complete absence of any evidence to the existence of such a suitcase.

===Death car===
Jordan attempted to keep the death car, but Ruth Warren of Topeka, Kansas, the vehicle&#x27;s legal owner, sued him. Jordan relented and allowed her to claim it in August 1934, still covered with blood and human tissue. The engine still ran, despite the damage the vehicle took during the ambush. Warren picked up the car in Arcadia and drove it to Shreveport, still in its gruesome state. From there, she had it trucked to Topeka.

The bullet-riddled Ford became a popular traveling attraction. The car was displayed at fairs, amusement parks, and flea markets for three decades, and once became a fixture at a Nevada race track. There was a charge of one dollar to sit in it.

In 1988, a casino near Las Vegas purchased the vehicle for about $250,000 (equivalent to $ in ). , the car and the shirt Barrow was wearing when killed are displayed behind a glass panel at Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Resort &amp; Casino in Primm, Nevada alongside Interstate 15.

Barrow&#x27;s enthusiasm for cars was evident in a letter he wrote from Tulsa, Oklahoma on April 10, 1934, to Henry Ford: &quot;While I still have got breath in my lungs I will tell you what a dandy car you make. I have drove Fords exclusively when I could get away with one. For sustained speed and freedom from trouble the Ford has got every other car skinned and even if my business hasn&#x27;t been strictly legal it don&#x27;t hurt anything to tell you what a fine car you got in the V-8.&quot; There are some doubts as to the authenticity of the letter.

=== Gang and family members===


In February 1935, Dallas and federal authorities arrested and tried twenty family members and friends for aiding and abetting Barrow and Parker. This became known as the &quot;harboring trial&quot; and all twenty either pleaded guilty or were found guilty. The two mothers were jailed for thirty days. Other sentences ranged from two years&#x27; imprisonment for Floyd Hamilton, brother of Raymond, to one hour in custody for Barrow&#x27;s teenage sister Marie. Other defendants included Blanche, Jones, Methvin, and Parker&#x27;s sister Billie.

Blanche was permanently blinded in her left eye during the 1933 shootout at Dexfield Park. She was taken into custody on the charge of &quot;assault with intent to kill&quot;. She was convicted and sentenced to ten years in prison, but was paroled in 1939 for good behavior. She returned to Dallas, leaving her life of crime in the past, and lived with her invalid father as his caregiver. In 1940, she married Eddie Frasure. She worked as a taxi cab dispatcher and a beautician, and completed the terms of her parole one year later. She lived in peace with her husband until he died of cancer in 1969.

Warren Beatty approached her to purchase the rights to her name for use in the 1967 film &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot;, and she agreed to the original script. She objected to her characterization by Estelle Parsons in the final film, describing the actress&#x27;s Academy Award-winning portrayal of her as &quot;a screaming horse&#x27;s ass&quot;. Despite this, she maintained a firm friendship with Beatty. She died from cancer at age 77 on December 24, 1988, and was buried in Dallas&#x27;s Grove Hill Memorial Park under the name &quot;Blanche B. Frasure&quot;.

Barrow cohorts Hamilton and Palmer, who escaped Eastham in January 1934, were recaptured. Both were convicted of murder and executed in the electric chair at Huntsville, Texas on May 10, 1935. 
Jones had left Barrow and Parker six weeks after the three of them evaded officers at Dexfield Park in July 1933. He reached Houston and got a job picking cotton, where he was soon discovered and captured. He was returned to Dallas, where he dictated a &quot;confession&quot; in which he claimed to have been kept a prisoner by Barrow and Parker. Some of the more lurid lies that he told concerned the gang&#x27;s sex lives, and this testimony gave rise to many stories about Barrow&#x27;s ambiguous sexuality. Jones was convicted of the murder of Doyle Johnson and served a lenient sentence of fifteen years.

He gave an interview to &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine during the excitement surrounding the 1967 movie: &quot;That Bonnie and Clyde movie made it all look sort of glamorous, but like I told them teenaged boys sitting near me at the drive-in showing: &#x27;Take it from an old man who was there. It was hell. Besides, there&#x27;s more lawmen nowadays with better ways of catching you. You couldn&#x27;t get away, anyway. The only way I come through it was because the Good Lord musta been watching over me. But you can&#x27;t depend on that, neither, because He&#x27;s got more folks to watch over now than He did then.&#x27;&quot;

W.D. Jones was killed on August 20, 1974, in a misunderstanding by a jealous boyfriend of a woman whom he was trying to help.

Methvin was convicted in Oklahoma of the 1934 murder of Constable Campbell at Commerce. He was paroled in 1942 and killed by a train in 1948. He fell asleep drunk on the train tracks, although some have speculated that he was pushed by someone seeking revenge. His father Ivy was killed in 1946 by a hit-and-run driver. Parker&#x27;s husband Roy Thornton was sentenced to five years in prison for burglary in March 1933. He was killed by guards on October 3, 1937, during an escape attempt from Eastham prison.


=== Law enforcement===
Hamer returned to a quiet life as a freelance security consultant for oil companies. According to Guinn, &quot;his reputation suffered somewhat after Gibsland&quot; because many people felt that he had not given Barrow and Parker a fair chance to surrender. He made headlines again in 1948 when he and Governor Coke Stevenson unsuccessfully challenged the vote total achieved by Lyndon Johnson during the election for the U.S. Senate. He died in 1955 at the age of 71, after several years of poor health. Bob Alcorn died on May 23, 1964, 30 years to the day after the Gibsland ambush.

Prentiss Oakley admitted to friends that he had fired prematurely. He succeeded Henderson Jordan as sheriff of Bienville Parish in 1940.

On April 1, 2011, officials of the Texas Rangers, Texas Highway Patrol, and Texas Department of Public Safety honored the memory of patrolman Edward Bryan Wheeler, who was murdered along with officer H. D. Murphy by the Barrow gang on Easter Sunday, April 1, 1934. They presented the Yellow Rose of Texas commendation to his last surviving sibling, 95-year-old Ella Wheeler-McLeod of San Antonio, giving her a plaque and framed portrait of her brother.

== In popular culture ==
=== Films ===
Hollywood has treated the story of Bonnie and Clyde several times, including the movies &quot;The Bonnie Parker Story&quot; (1958), &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; (1967), and &quot;The Highwaymen&quot; (2019).

=== Music ===

The iconic partnership of Bonnie and Clyde has popularized the term &quot;ride-or-die&quot; to describe unwavering loyalty between a duo. Some songs dive deeply into the story of Bonnie and Clyde, narrating their infamous romance and criminal exploits, while others merely reference their names as symbols of rebellion or loyalty, without the lyrics directly relating to their lives. Notable examples include:
* Serge Gainsbourg and Brigitte Bardot&#x27;s 1967 single &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot;.
* Georgie Fame&#x27;s 1967 single &quot;The Ballad of Bonnie and Clyde&quot;.
* Mel Tormé&#x27;s 1968 song &quot;A Day in the Life of Bonnie and Clyde&quot; and album of the same name.
* Merle Haggard&#x27;s 1968 single &quot;The Legend of Bonnie and Clyde&quot;. The same year the song was covered by Tammy Wynette on her album &quot;D-I-V-O-R-C-E&quot;.
* Flatt and Scruggs&#x27; 1968 album &quot;The Story of Bonnie &amp; Clyde&quot;.
* Die Toten Hosen&#x27;s 1996 song &quot;Bonnie &amp; Clyde&quot;.

=== Television ===
* The Looney Tunes cartoon &quot;Bunny and Claude (We Rob Carrot Patches)&quot; (1968) is a parody, portraying them as rabbits stealing carrots.
* A television film was broadcast in 1992 and titled &quot;Bonnie &amp; Clyde: The True Story&quot;.
* In March 2009, Bonnie and Clyde were the subject of a program in the BBC series &quot;Timewatch&quot;, based in part on gang members&#x27; private papers and previously unavailable police documents.
* Bruce Beresford directed the television miniseries &quot;Bonnie &amp; Clyde&quot;, which aired in 2013.
* In the 2016 episode of &quot;Timeless&quot; (season 1, episode 9, &quot;Last Ride of Bonnie &amp; Clyde&quot;), Sam Strike portrays Clyde Barrow and Jacqueline Byers portrays Bonnie Parker.
* The story of Bonnie and Clyde is parodied in &quot;Love, Springfieldian Style&quot;, an episode from the 19th season of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, with Marge and Homer in the titular roles.
* In 2020, Bonnie and Clyde were some of the &quot;featured villains/criminals&quot; of the 9th episode of season 5 of DC&#x27;s Legends of Tomorrow, &quot;The Great British Fake Off&quot;, alongside fellow criminal Jack the Ripper.

=== Theatre ===
* &quot;Bonnie &amp; Clyde: A Folktale&quot; ran as part of the 2008 New York Musical Theater Festival, featuring book and lyrics by Hunter Foster and music by Rick Crom.
* Another musical, &quot;Bonnie &amp; Clyde&quot;, only loosely inspired by Parker &amp; Barrow, premiered in 2009 with music by Frank Wildhorn, lyrics by Don Black, and book by Ivan Menchell.

=== Videogames ===
* The 2010 videogame &quot;&quot; features the death car of fictional outlaws Vikki and Vance, who are based on the real-life outlaw couple.
=== Books ===
:&quot;Books that are regarded as non-fictional are listed in the bibliography section.&quot;
*&quot;Side By Side: A Novel of Bonnie and Clyde&quot; by Jenni L. Walsh is the fictionalized account of Bonnie and Clyde&#x27;s crime spree, told through the perspective of Bonnie Parker. Published in 2018 by Forge Books (Macmillan Publishers).

===Slang===
* The idiomatic phrase &quot;modern-day Bonnie and Clyde&quot; generally refers to a man and a woman who operate together as present-day criminals.
* The colloquial expression &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; is often used to describe a couple that is extremely loyal and willing to do anything for each other, even in the face of danger. In this instance, it is synonymous with the slang phrases &quot;ride-or-die&quot; and &quot;ride-or-die chick&quot;; for example, the song &quot;03 Bonnie and Clyde&quot; by Jay Z and Beyoncé Knowles.
* &quot;Bonnie and Clyde Syndrome&quot; is the pop culture phrase for hybristophilia—the phenomenon of becoming attracted to, sexually aroused by, or achieving orgasm based on knowledge of, or watching, an outrage or crime take place. For instance, high-profile criminals (e.g. serial killers) such as Ted Bundy, Charles Manson, and Richard Ramirez reportedly received volumes of sexual fan mail and love letters.

<text>Bonnie and Clyde is a 1967 American biographical crime film directed by Arthur Penn and starring Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway as the title characters Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker, outlaws and romantic partners in the Great Depression-era American South. The cast also features Michael J. Pollard, Gene Hackman, and Estelle Parsons. The screenplay is written by David Newman and Robert Benton (with uncredited contributions by Beatty and Robert Towne); Beatty also produced the film.

The film was released in the United States by Warner Bros.-Seven Arts in August 13, 1967. Initial critical reception was mixed, but later swung positive, and the film became a significant commercial success, becoming one of the highest-grossing films of 1967. It was nominated for 10 Academy Awards including for Best Picture, winning Best Supporting Actress (for Estelle Parsons) and Best Cinematography (Burnett Guffey).

&quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; is considered one of the first films of the New Hollywood era and a landmark picture. It broke many cinematic taboos and for some members of the counterculture, the film was considered a &quot;rallying cry&quot;. Its success prompted other filmmakers to be more open in presenting sex and violence in their films. The film&#x27;s ending became famous as &quot;one of the bloodiest death scenes in cinematic history&quot;. In 1992, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. It was ranked 27th on the American Film Institute&#x27;s 1998 list of the 100 greatest American films of all time and 42nd on its 2007 list.

==Plot==
During the Great Depression, Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker of Texas meet when Clyde tries to steal Bonnie&#x27;s mother&#x27;s car. Bonnie, who is bored by her job as a waitress, is intrigued by Clyde and decides to take up with him and become his partner in crime. They pull off some holdups, but their amateur efforts, while exciting, are not very lucrative. Bonnie and Clyde turn from small-time heists to bank robbing.

The duo&#x27;s crime spree shifts into high gear once they hook up with a dim-witted gas station attendant, C.W. Moss. Their exploits also become more violent. After C.W. botches parking during a bank robbery and delays their escape, Clyde shoots the bank manager in the face when he jumps onto the slow-moving car&#x27;s running board. Clyde&#x27;s older brother Buck and his wife, Blanche, a preacher&#x27;s daughter, also join them. The two women dislike each other at first sight, and their antipathy escalates. Blanche has nothing but disdain for Bonnie, Clyde, and C.W., while Bonnie sees Blanche&#x27;s flightiness as a constant danger to the gang&#x27;s survival.

In Joplin, Missouri, local police show up at the gang&#x27;s rented house after being alerted by a grocery delivery boy; two policemen are killed in a shootout. The gang is pursued by law enforcement, including Texas Ranger Frank Hamer, whom they capture and humiliate before setting him free. The five outlaws then pull a heist, during which a police chase disables their vehicle. They steal Eugene Grizzard&#x27;s car and take him and his girlfriend captive before quickly abandoning them when they learn he is an undertaker.

Bonnie wants to visit her family in Texas and give them part of the heist funds, to which Clyde reluctantly acquiesces despite the risk. The gang is caught off guard by an ambush by law enforcement overnight, resulting in many casualties. Buck is mortally wounded by a shot to his head, and Blanche is injured in one eye, losing sight in it. Bonnie, Clyde, and C.W. barely escape alive, while Blanche falls into police custody. Hamer then tricks her into revealing C.W.&#x27;s name (until then he was only an &quot;unidentified suspect&quot;).

C.W. takes the wounded Bonnie and Clyde to hide out at the house of his father Ivan, who thinks the couple have corrupted his son (as evidenced by an ornate tattoo Bonnie convinced C.W. to get). The elder Moss makes a deal with Hamer: in exchange for leniency for C.W., he sets a trap for the outlaws. When Bonnie and Clyde stop on the side of the road to help Mr. Moss fix a flat tire, as a nearby flock of birds flies away, the posse in the bushes gun the couple down. Hamer and his men come out of hiding and gather around the couple&#x27;s bodies.

==Cast==

===Cast notes===
Gene Wilder in his film debut as Eugene Grizzard, one of Bonnie and Clyde&#x27;s hostages. His girlfriend Velma Davis was played by Evans Evans.

The family gathering scene was filmed in Red Oak, Texas. Several residents gathered to watch. When the filmmakers noticed Mabel Cavitt, a local schoolteacher, among the people gathered, she was cast as Bonnie Parker&#x27;s mother.

==Production and style==

The film was intended as a romantic and comic version of the violent gangster films of the 1930s, updated with modern filmmaking techniques. Arthur Penn portrayed some of the violent scenes with a comic tone, sometimes reminiscent of Keystone Cops-style slapstick films, then shifted disconcertingly into horrific and graphic violence. The film has the French New Wave directors&#x27; influence, both in its rapid shifts of tone, and in its choppy editing, which is particularly noticeable in its closing sequence.

The first handling of the script was in the early 1960s. Influenced by the French New Wave writers and not yet completed, Newman and Benton sent Penn an early draft. He already was engaged in production decisions for &quot;The Chase&quot; (1966) and could not get involved in the script for &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot;. The writers sent their script to François Truffaut, who made contributions but passed on the project, next directing &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;. At Truffaut&#x27;s suggestion, the writers, much excited (the film&#x27;s producers were less so), approached filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard.

Some sources claim Godard did not trust Hollywood and refused. Benton claimed that Godard wanted to shoot the film in New Jersey in January during the winter. He purportedly took offense when would-be producer Norah Wright objected that his desire was unreasonable, as the story took place in Texas, which has a warm climate year-round. Her partner Elinor Jones claimed the two did not believe Godard was right for the project in the first place. Godard&#x27;s retort: «Je vous parle de cinéma, vous me parlez de météo. Au revoir.» (&quot;I&#x27;m talking cinema and you&#x27;re talking weather. Goodbye.&quot;) After the 1968 Academy Awards, Godard sent Benton and Newman a cable that read, &quot;Now, let&#x27;s make it all over again!&quot;

Soon after the failed negotiations for production, Beatty was visiting Paris and learned through Truffaut of the project and its path. On returning to Hollywood, Beatty requested to see the script and bought the rights. A meeting with Godard was not productive. Beatty changed his approach and convinced the writers that while the script at first reading was very much of the French New Wave style, an American director was necessary for the subject.

Beatty offered the directing position to George Stevens, William Wyler, Karel Reisz, John Schlesinger, Brian G. Hutton, and Sydney Pollack, all of whom turned it down. Penn turned it down several times before Beatty finally persuaded him to direct the film. Beatty was entitled to 40% of the profits of the film and gave Penn 10%.

When Beatty was on board as producer only, his sister and actress Shirley MacLaine was a strong possibility to play Bonnie. When Beatty decided to play Clyde, they needed a different actress. Considered for the role were Jane Fonda, Tuesday Weld, Ann-Margret, Sharon Tate, Leslie Caron, Carol Lynley and Sue Lyon. Cher auditioned for the part, and Beatty begged Natalie Wood to play the role. Wood declined, to concentrate on her therapy, and acknowledged that working with Beatty before had been &quot;difficult&quot;. Faye Dunaway later said that she won the part &quot;by the skin of her teeth!&quot;

The film is forthright in its handling of sexuality, but that theme was toned down from its conception. Originally, Benton and Newman wrote Clyde as bisexual. He and Bonnie were to have a three-way sexual relationship with their male getaway driver. Penn persuaded the writers that since the couple&#x27;s relationship was underwritten in terms of emotional complexity, it dissipated the passion of the title characters. This would threaten the audience&#x27;s sympathy for the characters, and might result in their being written off as sexual deviants because they were criminals. Others said that Beatty was unwilling to have his character display that kind of sexuality and that the Production Code would never have allowed such content in the first place. Clyde is portrayed as heterosexual and impotent.

&quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; was one of the first films to feature extensive use of squibs—small explosive charges, often mounted with bags of stage blood, that detonate inside an actor&#x27;s clothes to simulate bullet hits. Released in an era when film shootings were generally depicted as bloodless and painless, the Bonnie and Clyde death scene was one of the first in mainstream American cinema to be depicted with graphic realism.

Beatty originally wanted the film to be shot in black and white, but Warner Bros. rejected the idea. Much of the studio&#x27;s senior management was hostile to the film, especially Jack L. Warner, who considered the subject matter an unwanted throwback to Warner Bros.&#x27; early period when gangster films were a common product. Moreover, Warner was already annoyed at Beatty for refusing to star in &quot;PT 109&quot; and defying Warner&#x27;s favorite gesture of authority of showing the studio water tower with the &quot;WB&quot; logo on it. Beatty said, &quot;Well, it&#x27;s got your name, but it&#x27;s got my initials.&quot; Warner complained about the costs of the film&#x27;s extensive location shooting in Texas, which exceeded its production schedule and budget, and ordered the crew back to the studio backlot. It already had planned to return for final process shots.

===Music===
&quot;Foggy Mountain Breakdown&quot; by Flatt and Scruggs, the instrumental banjo piece, was introduced to a worldwide audience as a result of its frequent use in the movie. Its use is anachronistic because bluegrass dates from the mid-1940s rather than the 1930s. But the functionally similar old-time music genre was long established and widely recorded in the period of the film&#x27;s events. Long out of print in vinyl and cassette formats, the film soundtrack was released on CD in 2009.

==Historical accuracy==

The film considerably simplifies the lives of Bonnie and Clyde and their gang. They were allied with other gang members, were repeatedly jailed, and committed other murders. In the part of the movie where Bonnie and Clyde escape the ambush that killed Buck Barrow and captured Blanche, Bonnie is shown being wounded by a deputy sheriff, whom Clyde then kills. Although they escaped the ambush, no lawmen were killed. Between June 1933 and April 1934, however, the Barrow gang did kill three law officers in Texas and Oklahoma.

On the run, they suffered a horrific auto accident in which Parker was severely burned and disabled. In the scene depicting their death, Bonnie and Clyde are portrayed as having stopped their automobile, with Clyde exiting the car and then looking back at Bonnie as they realize they&#x27;ve been trapped, but reports say the car was still moving when lawmen opened fire.

The sequence with Wilder and Evans is based on the Barrow gang&#x27;s kidnappings of undertaker H.D. Darby and his acquaintance Sophia Stone, near Ruston, Louisiana, on April 27, 1933. The real Darby and Stone were not romantically involved. The gang also stole Darby&#x27;s car.

The film is considered to stray far from fact in its portrayal of Frank Hamer as a vengeful bungler who was captured, humiliated, and released by Bonnie and Clyde. Hamer was a decorated Texas Ranger when he was coaxed out of semi-retirement to hunt the couple down. He had never met them before he and his posse ambushed and killed them near Gibsland, Louisiana, on May 23, 1934. In 1968, Hamer&#x27;s widow and son sued the movie producers for defamation of character over his portrayal. They obtained an out-of-court settlement in 1971.
In 1933, police found undeveloped film in Bonnie and Clyde&#x27;s hastily abandoned hideout in Joplin, Missouri. When they printed the negatives, one showed Bonnie holding a gun in her hand and a cigar between her teeth. Its publication nationwide typed her as a dramatic gun moll. The film portrays the taking of this playful photo. It implies the gang sent photos—and poetry—to the press, but this is untrue. The police found most of the gang&#x27;s items in the Joplin cache. Bonnie&#x27;s final poem, read aloud by her in the movie, was not published until after her death, when her mother released it.

The only two surviving members of the Barrow Gang when the film was released in 1967 were Blanche Barrow and W.D. Jones. While Barrow had approved the depiction of her in the original script, she objected to the later rewrites. At the film&#x27;s release, she complained about Estelle Parsons&#x27;s portrayal of her, saying, &quot;That film made me look like a screaming horse&#x27;s ass!&quot;

==Release==
The film premiered as the opening film of the Montreal International Film Festival on August 4, 1967.

At first, Warner Bros. did not promote &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; for general release, but mounted only limited regional releases that seemed to confirm its misgivings about the film&#x27;s lack of commercial appeal. The film quickly did excellent sustained business in select urban theatres. While Jack Warner was selling the studio to Seven Arts Productions, he would have dumped the film but for the fact that Israel, of which Warner was a major supporter, had recently triumphed in the Six-Day War. Warner was feeling too defiant to sell any of his studio&#x27;s films.

Meanwhile, Beatty complained to Warner Bros. that if the company was willing to go to so much trouble for &quot;Reflections in a Golden Eye&quot; (it had changed the coloration scheme at considerable expense), their neglect of his film, which was getting excellent press, suggested a conflict of interest; he threatened to sue the company. Warner Bros. gave Beatty&#x27;s film a general release. Much to the surprise of Warner Bros.&#x27; management, the film became a major box-office success.

==Reception and legacy==
The film was controversial at the time of release because of its apparent glorification of murderers, and for its level of graphic violence, which was unprecedented at the time. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;It is a cheap piece of bald-faced slapstick comedy that treats the hideous depredations of that sleazy, moronic pair as though they were as full of fun and frolic as the jazz-age cutups in &quot;Thoroughly Modern Millie&quot;.&quot; He was so appalled that he began to campaign against the increasing brutality of American films.

Dave Kaufman of &quot;Variety&quot; criticized the film for uneven direction and for portraying Bonnie and Clyde as bumbling moronic types. Joe Morgenstern in &quot;Newsweek&quot; initially panned the film as a &quot;squalid shoot-&#x27;em-up for the moron trade&quot;, but after seeing it a second time and noting the enthusiastic audience, he wrote a second article saying he had misjudged the film and praised it. Warner Bros. took advantage of this, marketing the film as having made a major critic change his mind about its virtues.

Roger Ebert gave &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; a positive review, giving it four stars out of four. He called the film &quot;a milestone in the history of American movies, a work of truth and brilliance&quot;, adding, &quot;It is also pitilessly cruel, filled with sympathy, nauseating, funny, heartbreaking, and astonishingly beautiful. If it does not seem that those words should be strung together, perhaps that is because movies do not very often reflect the full range of human life.&quot; More than 30 years later, Ebert added the film to his list in &quot;The Great Movies&quot;, writing: &quot;The movie opened like a slap in the face. American filmgoers had never seen anything like it.&quot; Film critics Dave Kehr and James Berardinelli have praised the film. Stephen Hunter, writing in &quot;Commentary&quot; in 2009, criticized the film&#x27;s failure to adhere to the historical truth about Barrow, Parker, and Hamer.

The fierce debate about the film is discussed at length in the documentary &quot;For the Love of Movies: The Story of American Film Criticism&quot; (2009). This film chronicles what occurred as a result: &quot;The New York Times&quot; fired Crowther because his negative review seemed so out of touch with public opinion. Pauline Kael, who wrote a lengthy freelance essay in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in praise of the film, was hired as the magazine&#x27;s new staff critic.

The film was not expected to perform well at the box office but was a sleeper hit and by year&#x27;s end had earned $2.5million in theatrical rentals in the US and Canada. It continued to perform well in 1968 and by March 1968 had been in the top 12 films at the US box office for 22 weeks. By the end of 1968 it had become the studio&#x27;s second highest-grossing film of all time, behind &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, with rentals of $19 million. By July 1968, the film had earned rentals of $10 million outside of the US and Canada. Listal lists it as one of the top five grossing films of 1967, with $50.7 million in US sales, and $70 million worldwide. Beatty&#x27;s profit participation (which he shared with Penn) earned him over $6 million and Penn over $2 million.

Although many believe the film&#x27;s groundbreaking portrayal of violence adds to the film&#x27;s artistic merit, &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; is still sometimes criticized for opening the floodgates to heightened graphic violence in cinema and TV. It holds a 90% rating on Rotten Tomatoes from 67 reviews, with an average rating of . The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;A paradigm-shifting classic of American cinema, &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; packs a punch whose power continues to reverberate through thrillers decades later.&quot;

The Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa cited this movie as one of his 100 favorite films.

<text>William Harrison &quot;Bones&quot; Dillard (July 8, 1923 – November 15, 2019) was an American track and field athlete, who is the only male in the history of the Olympic Games to win gold in both the 100 meter (sprints) and the 110 meter hurdles, making him the “World’s Fastest Man” in 1948 and the “World’s Fastest Hurdler” in 1952.

==Early life and career==
Dillard was born in Cleveland, Ohio, on July 8, 1923, and attended East Technical High School. He entered Baldwin-Wallace College in 1941 and joined Pi Lambda Phi International Fraternity, and two years later was drafted into the U.S. Army, serving in the all-black 92nd Infantry Division known as the Buffalo Soldiers.

According to a 1962 article written by Trinidadian Olympic sprinter Mike Agostini for Australia&#x27;s &quot;The Age&quot; newspaper, Dillard was first inspired as a youngster by Charley Paddock, who Agostini says visited Dillard at his high school and encouraged him to follow his dream of becoming an Olympic champion like himself.

Dillard returned to college in 1946, and resumed athletics, inspired by Jesse Owens, who, like him, was from Cleveland and had attended East Technical High School. He won the NCAA and AAU 120-yard and 220-yard hurdles in both 1946 and 1947, tying world records in both events with a 22.3 in the 220 in 1946 and a 13.6 in the 120. Between June 1947 and June 1948, he remained unbeaten in 82 consecutive finals, a record until broken by Ed Moses.

==Olympic Games==

At the trials for the 1948 Summer Olympics, Dillard failed to qualify for the 110 m hurdles event, but qualified for the 100 m after finishing third.

At the Games, Dillard reached the final, which seemed to end in a dead heat between Dillard and another American, Barney Ewell. The finish photo showed Dillard had won, equalling the World record as well. This was the first use of a photo finish at an Olympic Games. As a member of the 4 × 100 m relay team, he won another gold medal at the London Games.

Four years later, still a strong hurdler, Dillard did qualify for the 110 m hurdles event, and won the event in Helsinki. Another 4 × 100 m relay victory yielded Dillard&#x27;s fourth Olympic title. Dillard attempted to qualify for a third Olympics in 1956, but failed (finishing seventh in the trials final). Earlier he took part in and won the gold medal in the 110m hurdles at the 1953 Maccabiah Games.

==Later years==
Dillard worked for the Cleveland Indians baseball franchise in scouting and public relations capacities, and hosted a radio talk show on Cleveland&#x27;s WERE. He also worked for the Cleveland City School District for many years as its business manager. Dillard died on November 15, 2019, at the age of 96, of stomach cancer. At the time of his death he was the United States&#x27; oldest living Olympic gold medallist.

==Competition record==
==Awards and honors==
* Four-time Olympic Gold Medalist
* U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame inductee

== World Rankings ==

Dillard was ranked among the best in the world in both the 100 m/100 y sprint and 110 m/120 y sprint hurdle events from 1947 to 1953, according to the votes of the experts of &quot;Track and Field News&quot;.


== World Records ==

Dillard in his career posted the following world record and world best times.

Dillard achieved the following world records during his track career:

* 120 y (110 m) hurdles of 13.6 s in Lawrence at the Kansas Relays on 17 April 1948;
* 220 y hurdles (straight course) of 22.5s in Delaware on 8 June 1946;
* 220 y hurdles (straight course) of 22.3 s in Salt Lake City on 21 June 1947.

He also ran the following world best times that were never ratified by the sport&#x27;s governing body, the IAAF:
* 220 y hurdles (turn) of 23.0 in Minneapolis on 22 June 1946;
* 220 y hurdles (straight course) of 22.5 s in Berea, Ohio on 20 May 1947.

<text>The following is a list providing an overview of sovereign states around the world with information on their status and recognition of their sovereignty.

The 205 listed states can be divided into three categories based on membership within the United Nations System: 193 UN member states, two UN General Assembly non-member observer states, and ten other states. The &quot;sovereignty dispute&quot; column indicates states having undisputed sovereignty (188 states, of which there are 187 UN member states and one UN General Assembly non-member observer state), states having disputed sovereignty (15 states, of which there are six UN member states, one UN General Assembly non-member observer state, and eight de facto states), and states having a special political status (two states, both in free association with New Zealand).

Compiling a list such as this can be complicated and controversial, as there is no definition that is binding on all the members of the community of nations concerning the criteria for statehood. For more information on the criteria used to determine the contents of this list, please see the &quot;criteria for inclusion&quot; section below. The list is intended to include entities that have been recognised as having &quot;de facto&quot; status as sovereign states, and inclusion should not be seen as an endorsement of any specific claim to statehood in legal terms.

==Criteria for inclusion==

The dominant customary international law standard of statehood is the declarative theory of statehood, which was codified by the Montevideo Convention of 1933. The Convention defines the state as a person of international law if it &quot;possess[es] the following qualifications: (a) a permanent population; (b) a defined territory; (c) government; and (d) a capacity to enter into relations with the other states&quot; so long as it was not &quot;obtained by force whether this consists in the employment of arms, in threatening diplomatic representations, or in any other effective coercive measure&quot;.

Debate exists on the degree to which recognition should be included as a criterion of statehood. The declarative theory of statehood argues that statehood is purely objective and recognition of a state by other states is irrelevant. On the other end of the spectrum, the constitutive theory of statehood defines a state as a person under international law only if it is recognised as sovereign by other states. For the purposes of this list, included are all polities that consider themselves sovereign states (through a declaration of independence or some other means) and either:
* are often regarded as satisfying the declarative theory of statehood, &quot;or&quot;
* are recognised as a sovereign state by at least one UN member state

In some cases, there is a divergence of opinion over the interpretation of the first point, and whether an entity satisfies it is disputed. Unique political entities which fail to meet the classification of a sovereign state are considered proto-states.

On the basis of the above criteria, this list includes the following 205 entities:
* 203 states recognised by at least one UN member state
* One state that satisfies the declarative theory of statehood and is recognised only by non-UN member states
* One state that satisfies the declarative theory of statehood and is not recognised by any other state

The table includes bullets in the right-hand column representing entities that are either not sovereign states or have a close association to another sovereign state. It also includes subnational areas where the sovereignty of the titular state is limited by an international agreement. Taken together, these include:
* Entities that are in a free association relationship with another state
* Two entities controlled by Pakistan which are neither sovereign states, dependent territories, nor part of another state: Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan
* Dependent territories of another state, as well as areas that exhibit many characteristics of dependent territories according to the dependent territory page
* Subnational entities created by international agreements

* Australia: 
* Chile: 
* France: (part of the )
* New Zealand: 
* Norway: and 
* United Kingdom: 
* &quot;Terra nullius&quot;: Marie Byrd Land (unclaimed territory)

Russia and the United States have reserved the right to claim territory on Antarctica.

=== Subantarctic islands ===
Unlike Antarctica itself, other nearby Subantarctic island territories most commonly associated with the Antarctic continent, but lying north of 60°S, have had full sovereignty established over them by a governing state.

The following dependent territories are situated within the wider Antarctic region, but are not directly part of the Antarctic Treaty System:

In addition to the dependent territories listed above, the following islands are governed as a direct part of a controlling state. Thus they are fully and legally integrated within the governance structure of the respective state. They are similarly also not part of the Antarctic Treaty System.

AuCl, AuBr, and AuI are all crystalline solids with a structure containing alternating linear chains: ..-X-Au-X-Au-X-Au-X-... The X-Au-X angle is less than 180°.

The monomeric AuF molecule has been detected in the gas phase.

== Trihalides ==
Gold triiodide does not exist or is unstable.

Gold(III) fluoride, AuF3, has a unique polymeric helical structure, containing corner-sharing {AuF4} squares.

== Pentahalides ==
Gold(V) fluoride, AuF5, is the only known example of gold in the +5 oxidation state. It most commonly occurs as the dimer Au2F10.

<text>Communications in Argentina gives an overview of the postal, telephone, Internet, radio, television, and newspaper services available in Argentina.

==Postal==

The national postal service, Correo Argentino, was established in 1854, privatized in 1997, and partly re-nationalized in 2003. There are no standard abbreviations for provinces&#x27; names; but the province name is optional and usually not needed if the postal code is correct. The format of the postal code was expanded in 1998 to include more specific information on location within cities; it now uses a letter that identifies the province, a four-digit number, and then three more letters (and slightly different numbers are used for different parts of a city, which was formerly done only in the case of Buenos Aires). See Argentine postal code for details.

==Telephone==
The network was initially developed primarily by ITT, and grew following the system&#x27;s nationalization in 1948 and the creation of the ENTel State enterprise. Its limitations notwithstanding, ENTel gave Argentines the widest access to phone service in Latin America. Following ENTel&#x27;s privatization in 1990, a new numbering plan was enacted, and the number of lines grew to cover the majority of households. A sizable minority of households, do not have land line telephone service, however. The growth of the mobile telephone market since the beginning of the economic recovery in 2003 has been impressive, with new customers now preferring a comparatively cheap cellular phone to land line household service.

As of January 2010, there are 9.2 million land lines, 50 million cellular phones and 143,000 public phones in the country. The domestic telephone trunk network is served by microwave radio relay and a domestic satellite system with 40 earth stations. It carries a monthly traffic of about 1.3 billion local calls, 400 million inter-city calls and around 24 million outgoing international calls.

International communications employ satellite earth stations - 3 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean); two international gateways near Buenos Aires; Atlantis II submarine cable (1999).
This system is largely replaced with a domestic fiber optic ring connecting the main cities (actually the main central offices). This link runs at 2.5 Gbit/s. From these head central offices, local calls are routed through 10 Gbit/s fiber optic links, or 3 × 155 Mbit/s microwave links. These links are spaced at about 30 km. Some of these links (the ones serving smaller towns) are spaced at 60 km and this makes communications unreliable in certain weather conditions.

According to a report released in January 2006 by INDEC, mobile phone lines increased by 68.8% during 2005. Eleven million mobile phones were sold that year and, by then, these serviced three-quarters of the population over 14. A growing minority of users are children under 14, something that has raised concern and debate in Argentine society. A private study conducted by &quot;Investigaciones Económicas Sectoriales&quot; (IES), covering January–October 2006, found a 51.2% growth compared to the same period of 2005; by December 2007, the number of these units (40 million) exceeded Argentina&#x27;s total population. Most of the phones (almost 90%) are imported from Brazil or Mexico. The monthly volume of calls made with these units (over 4.6 billion) more than doubles the number made on land lines; a further 6 billion text messages are sent, monthly.

===Companies===
In the 1990s the Argentine telephone system (which was formerly property of a state-owned company, ENTEL) was sold to two private corporations looking to invest in the local market: Telefónica, a telco from Spain, and Telecom Argentina, owned by Telecom Italia and the Argentine Werthein family. The country was divided in two zones, within which one of the companies was the exclusive provider of the service (a state-sanctioned monopoly).

The service was then deregulated in several steps, first allowing the participation of other companies to provide international phone call services, then mobile services and finally the domestic service.

Telecom has a subsidiary Internet service provider, Arnet. Other ISPs, such as Flash (property of the Clarín group), hire the facilities of Telecom and Telefónica.

Several newcomer companies in the telephone market (2005) offer high-speed broadband access, Voice over IP and other services to a restricted market group (businesses and high-level residential users).

==Internet==

The number of Internet users in the country as of 2011 has been estimated at 27 million (two thirds of the population), the number of registered domain names was approx. 1.7 million in August 2008 and the number of internet hosts in 2009, 6,025,000.

Besides monthly-paid Internet connections (either flat rate or with a number of free minutes), in Argentina there are also a number of Internet service providers that have commercial agreements with the telephone companies for charging a slightly higher communication rate to the user for that communication, though without any monthly fixed fee. There were around 12 million PCs registered in Argentina in 2011. The number of residential and business internet networks totaled around 5.7 million in 2011, of which around 5.5 million were broadband connections, mainly ADSL.

The number of dial-up users has decreased drastically since 2005 in favor of broadband internet access. This latter service grew from under 800,000 networks in late 2005 (compared to over 500,000 dial-up connections), to nearly 2.6 million by December 2007, and to over 5 million by late 2010 (82% of which were residential and 81% of which connected at a speed of least 512 kbit/s).Wireless and satellite networks expanded markedly during 2008–09, and totaled over 1.5 million in March 2011. Among residential users, 38.3% were located in Buenos Aires Province (including Greater Buenos Aires), 26.0% in the city of Buenos Aires, 8.2% in Córdoba and 7.4% in Santa Fe Province.

Among companies and organizations, 788,000 connection contracts were valid as of March 2011, 98% of which were broadband. Among the total (in late 2010), 44.7% correspond to the city of Buenos Aires, 21.1% to the Buenos Aires Province, 7.6% to Santa Fe Province, 6.0% to Córdoba Province and 4.5% to Patagonia.

The number of e-mail accounts in March 2011 was estimated at around 4.56 million, with a monthly traffic of 3 billion messages.

Argentina&#x27;s Internet top-level domain is .ar.

===Broadband Internet access===
ADSL first appeared in Argentina in 1998, through Speedy by Telefónica de España, a Spanish company. Fibertel, a cable provider, now offers Cablemodem service in a limited range of cities, and ADSL is monopolized by the 2 major phone companies: Telecom in the north with Arnet ADSL, and Telefónica in the south with Speedy ADSL.

In 2004, Arnet announced new plans. Controversy ensued, as in small print it mentioned that it was capped to 4 GB monthly. This plans were never put in practice until late 2005, though they were modified from the original announcements. There are no longer any capped plans. As of June 2010, they currently offer from 1 Mbit/256 kbit/s download/upload at around 20 USD/mo to 20 Mbit/s / 512 kbit/s for home users at about 77 USD/mo. Arnet has been slowly recovering its reputation, which was tarnished amongst connoisseurs due to their 2004 announcement.

===Censorship===
Argentina is not individually classified by the OpenNet Initiative, but is included in the ONI regional overview for Latin America.

The regulation of Internet content addresses largely the same concerns and strategies seen in North America and Europe, focusing on combating the spread of child pornography and restricting child access to age-inappropriate material. As Internet usage in Argentina increases, so do defamation, hate speech, copyright, and privacy issues.

Argentina has strengthened intellectual property rights protections by drafting and updating laws and ratifying international agreements such as the WIPO Copyright Treaty.

Since the 1997 presidential declaration regarding &quot;Free Speech on the Internet&quot; that guarantees Internet content the same constitutional protections for freedom of expression, Argentina has become a haven for neo-Nazi and race-hate groups around the region. In 2000 an Argentine appellate court affirmed a lower court&#x27;s dismissal of a claim that a Yahoo! site selling Nazi memorabilia violated Argentina&#x27;s anti-discrimination law (no. 23.592), holding that the equivalent restrictions of non-Internet speech would be unacceptable. Under Argentina&#x27;s anti-discrimination law a crime is aggravated if racism is involved.

The defendant in the 2006 case Jujuy.com v. Omar Lozano was found liable for publishing slanderous content on his Web site after imputing adulterous conduct to a couple and failing to remove the content promptly. An injunction was imposed and damages were set at $40,000 (USD).

Prosecutors and police pursue cases of Internet child pornography. In June 2008 the Congress passed a law criminalizing child pornography; however, the law does not penalize possession by individuals for personal use.

In 2010 an appeals court overturned a lower-court ruling that found Google and Yahoo liable for defamation for including sex-related Web sites in their search results for an Argentine entertainer. The appeals court ruling said the firms could be held liable for defamation only if they were made aware of clearly illegal content and were negligent in removing it.

In August 2011 a judge ordered all ISPs to block the site LeakyMails, a Web site that obtains and publishes documents exposing corruption in Argentina. In response some internet service providers blocked the website IP address 216.239.32.2 which is linked to more than one million blogs hosted on Google&#x27;s Blogger service disrupting the access to all of them.

In November 2012 the CNC () ordered the blocking of websites that contained information about bootloader unlocking of netbooks supplied by the Argentine Government. The legality of these actions in Argentina remains controversial.

In July 2014 the CNC () ordered local ISPs to block The Pirate Bay due an injunction of CAPIF () against the popular Torrent index.
CAPIF is an Argentine music industry group and a member of International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI). The CNC is an agency of the Argentine Government created to certify wireless devices; to regulate communications by radio, television, wire, satellite, cable and postal services.
In retaliation for the blocking, the online site of CAPIF was hacked and turned into a Pirate Bay Proxy server.

==Radio==

Radio broadcasting in Argentina is predated only by radio in the United States, and began on August 27, 1920, when Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Parsifal&quot; was broadcast by a team of medical students (the &quot;madmen on the roof&quot;) led Enrique Susini in Buenos Aires&#x27; Teatro Coliseo. Only about twenty homes in the city had a receiver to tune in. The world&#x27;s first radio station was the only one in the country until 1922, when &quot;Radio Cultura&quot; went on the air; by 1925, there were twelve stations in Buenos Aires and ten in other cities. The 1930s were the &quot;golden age&quot; of radio in Argentina, with live variety, news, soap opera and sport shows.

The medium, which was nationalized by President Juan Perón between 1947 and 1953, has historically been broadcast by a combination of state and private-sector operators, and most of the highest-rated stations are presently owned by a number of media conglomerates. Internet radio was first broadcast in Argentina in 2001 and by 2009, 61 stations did so, nationwide.

There are currently 260 AM broadcasting and 1150 FM broadcasting radio stations in Argentina. Radio remains an important medium in Argentina. Music and youth variety programs dominate FM formats; news, debate, and sports are AM radio&#x27;s primary broadcasts. Amateur radio is widespread in the country.

===Censorship===
The Federal Broadcasting Committee (COMFER) has continued to apply certain broadcasting regulations that were instituted during military rule. One such article &quot;banning creation of permanent privately owned networks&quot; was used to revoke the FM radio license of Radio Continental in 2008. Critics pointed out that the relevant law had been selectively applied and accused COMFER of attempting to suppress criticism of the government.

A 2018 court case punished Radio 10 host Baby Etchecopar for comments made in his show &quot;El Angel&quot;. Prosecutors collected eight pages of allegedly sexist remarks by Etchecopar and devised a programming schedule which they say &quot;promotes tolerance&quot;. To avoid a harsher sentence, Etchecopar agreed to invite twenty gender specialists onto his program to speak uninterrupted for ten minutes at a time with no criticism following the appearance.

==Television==

The Argentine television industry is large and diverse, widely viewed in Latin America, and its productions seen around the world. Many local programs are broadcast by networks in other countries, and others have their rights purchased by foreign producers for adaptations in their own markets. Argentina has five major networks. All provincial capitals and other large cities have at least one local station. Argentines enjoy the highest availability of cable and satellite television in Latin America, similar to percentages in North America. Many cable networks operate from Argentina and serve the Spanish-speaking world, including Utilísima Satelital, TyC Sports, Fox Sports en Español (with the United States and México), MTV Argentina, Cosmopolitan TV, and the news network Todo Noticias.

Argentine television broadcasting began in 1951 with the inaugural of state-owned Channel 7 (since privatized). A technology jealously guarded by U.S. broadcasters at the time, this was largely the achievement of Jewish-Argentine engineer and radio pioneer Jaime Yankelevich. Color television broadcasting, however, was not widely available until after 1978, when the government launched Argentina Televisora Color (ATC), now Channel 7 (Argentina&#x27;s principal public television station). The prevalence of cable television, increasing steadily since the first CATV transmitter opened in the city of Junín in 1965, is now the third-widest in the world, reaching at least 78% of households.

Radio and television broadcasting, whose ownership structure had become increasingly concentrated since the 1980 Media Law, is regulated by a new law advanced by President Cristina Kirchner, and signed on November 11, 2009. This new policy would restrict the number of media licences per proprietor and allocate a greater share of these to the state and NGOs, thereby limiting the influence of the &quot;Clarín Group&quot; (the largest media conglomerate in Argentina) and other media companies, such as the conservative &quot;La Nación&quot;.

There are currently 42 television broadcast stations and 12.5 million television sets in Argentina.

==Newspapers==

The print media industry is highly developed and independent of the government, with more than two hundred newspapers. The major national newspapers are from Buenos Aires, including the centrist &quot;Clarín&quot;, the best-selling daily in Latin America and the second most widely circulated in the Spanish-speaking world. Other nationally circulated papers are &quot;La Nación&quot; (center-right, published since 1870), &quot;Página/12&quot; (left-wing), &quot;Ámbito Financiero&quot; (business conservative), &quot;Olé&quot; (sports) and &quot;Crónica&quot; (populist).

Two foreign language newspapers enjoy a relatively high circulation: the &quot;Argentinisches Tageblatt&quot; in German and the &quot;Buenos Aires Herald&quot;, published since 1876. Major regional papers include &quot;La Voz del Interior&quot; (Córdoba), &quot;Río Negro&quot; (General Roca), &quot;Los Andes&quot; (Mendoza), &quot;La Capital&quot; (Rosario), &quot;El Tribuno&quot; (Salta) and &quot;La Gaceta&quot; (Tucuman). The most circulated newsmagazine is &quot;Noticias&quot;. The Argentine publishing industry, which includes Atlántida, Eudeba, and Emecé, among numerous others, ranks with Spain&#x27;s and Mexico&#x27;s as the most important in the Spanish-speaking world, and includes the largest bookstore chain in Latin America, El Ateneo.

<doc id="68260" wikidata="Q16951436" url="?curid=68260" title="Stock market downturn of 2002">
<text>In 2001, stock prices took a sharp downturn (some say &quot;stock market crash&quot; or &quot;the Internet bubble bursting&quot;) in stock markets across the United States, Canada, Asia, and Europe. After recovering from lows reached following the September 11 attacks, indices slid steadily starting in March 2002, with dramatic declines in July and September leading to lows last reached in 1997 and 1998. The U.S. dollar increased in value relative to the euro, reaching a 1-to-1 valuation not seen since the euro&#x27;s introduction.

==Background==
This downturn can be viewed as part of a larger bear market or correction that began in 2000 after a decade-long bull market had led to unusually high stock valuations, according to a report by the Cleveland Federal Reserve. The collapse of Enron is a prime example. Many internet companies (Webvan, Exodus Communications, and Pets.com) went bankrupt. Others (Amazon.com, eBay, and Yahoo!) went down dramatically in value, but remain in business to this day and have generally good long-term growth prospects. An outbreak of accounting scandals, (Arthur Andersen, Adelphia, Enron, and WorldCom) was also a factor in the speed of the fall, as numerous large corporations were forced to restate earnings (or lack thereof) and investor confidence suffered. The September 11 attacks also contributed heavily to the stock market downturn, as investors became unsure about the prospect of terrorism affecting the United States economy.

The International Monetary Fund had expressed concern about instability in United States stock markets in the months leading up to the sharp downturn. The technology-heavy NASDAQ stock market peaked on March 10, 2000, hitting an intra-day high of 5,132.52 and closing at 5,048.62. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, a price-weighted average (adjusted for splits and dividends) of 30 large companies on the New York Stock Exchange, peaked on January 14, 2000, with an intra-day high of 11,750.28 and a closing price of 11,722.98. In 2001, the DJIA was largely unchanged overall but had reached a secondary peak of 11,337.92 (11,350.05 intra-day) on May 21.

The downturn may be viewed as a reversion to average stock market performance in a longer-term context. From 1987 to 1995, the Dow rose each year by about 10%, but from 1995 to 2000, the Dow rose 15% a year. While the bear market began in 2000, by July and August 2002, the index had only dropped to the same level it would have achieved if the 10% annual growth rate followed during 1987–1995 had continued up to 2002.

==Seeking a bottom==
After falling for 11 of 12 consecutive days closing below Dow 8000 on July 23, 2002, the market rallied. The Dow rose 13% over the next four trading days, but then fell sharply again in early August. On August 5, the NASDAQ fell below its July 23 low. However, the markets rose sharply over the rest of the week, and eventually surpassed Dow 9000 during several trading sessions in late August. After that, the Dow dropped to a four-year low on September 24, 2002, while the NASDAQ reached a 6-year low. The markets continued their declines, breaking the September low to five-year lows on October 7 and reaching a bottom (below Dow 7200 and just above 1100 on the NASDAQ) on October 9. Stocks recovered slightly from their October lows to year-end, with the Dow remaining in the mid-8000s from November 2002 to mid-January 2003. The markets reached a final low below Dow 7500 in mid-March 2003.

==Scale==
As of September 24, 2002, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 27% of the value it held on January 1, 2001: a total loss of 5 trillion dollars. The Dow Jones had already lost 9% of its peak value at the start of 2001, while the Nasdaq had lost 44%. At the March 2000 top, the sum in valuation of all NYSE-listed companies stood at $12.9 trillion, and the valuation sum of all NASDAQ-listed companies stood at $5.4 trillion, for a total market value of $18.3 trillion. The NASDAQ subsequently lost nearly 80% and the S&amp;P 500 lost 50% to reach the October 2002 lows. The total market value of NYSE (7.2) and NASDAQ (1.8) companies at that time was only $9 trillion, for an overall market loss of $9.3 trillion.

==Index levels==

To put the downturn of 2002 in perspective, here is a look at annual U.S. stock market declines in 2000, 2001, and 2002:
* Nasdaq
** In 2000, the Nasdaq lost 39.28% of its value (4,069.31 to 2,470.52).
** In 2001, the Nasdaq lost 21.05% of its value (2,470.52 to 1,950.40).
** In 2002, the Nasdaq lost 31.53% of its value (1,950.40 to 1,335.51).
* Dow Jones Industrial Average
** In 2000, the Dow lost 6.17% of its value (11,497.10 to 10,788.00)
** In 2001, the Dow lost 5.35% of its value (10,788.00 to 10,021.60)
** In 2002, the Dow lost 16.76% of its value (10,021.60 to 8,341.63)

<doc id="68264" wikidata="Q2640852" url="?curid=68264" title="Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures">
<text>Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures are subcultures and communities composed of people who have shared experiences, backgrounds, or interests due to common sexual or gender identities. Among the first to argue that members of sexual minorities can also constitute cultural minorities were Adolf Brand, Magnus Hirschfeld, and Leontine Sagan in Germany. These pioneers were later followed by the Mattachine Society and the Daughters of Bilitis in the United States.

Not all persons of various gender and sexual orientations self-identify or are affiliated with a particular subculture. Reasons include geographic distance, unawareness of the subculture&#x27;s existence, fear of social stigma, or personal preference to remain unidentified with sexuality- or gender-based subcultures or communities. Some have suggested that the identities defined by the Western heterosexualized cultures are based on sexuality. They also have serious flaws and often leave no space for the public to discuss these flaws of gender and sexuality. Because there are no safe spaces to discuss these things, many people reject who they are and ignore their own sexual needs. This rejection can lead to these people being classified under sexual identities that they feel do not represent them as a person. These cultures are currently changing. For example, Greece recently legalized gay marriage, taking a huge step for an Orthodox country.

==LGBTQ+ culture==

LGBTQ+ culture is the common culture shared by lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer communities. It is sometimes simply referred to as &quot;queer culture&quot; or &quot;gay culture&quot;, but the latter term can also be specific to gay men&#x27;s culture.

LGBT culture varies widely by geography and the identity of the participants.
Elements often identified as being common to the culture of gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and transgender people include:
*The work of famous gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people. This may include:
**Present-day LGBTQ+ artists and political figures;
**Historical figures who have been identified as LGBTQ+. It has often been questioned whether it is appropriate to identify historical figures using modern terms for sexual identity (see History of sexuality). However, many LGBTQ+ people feel a kinship towards these people and their work, especially to the extent that it deals with same-sex attraction or gender identity.
*An understanding of the history of LGBTQ+ political movements.
*An ironic appreciation of things linked by stereotype to LGBTQ+ people.
*Figures and identities that are present in the LGBTQ+ community and LGBTQ+ culture, this could include the gay village, drag kings and queens, LGBTQ+ pride, and the rainbow flag.

In some cities, especially in North America, gay men and lesbians tend to live in certain neighbourhoods that celebrate or support their community.

LGBTQ+ communities organize a number of events to celebrate their culture, such as Pride parades, the Gay Games and Southern Decadence.

==Polyamory==
Polyamory is the practice and associated culture of being romantically connected or involved with more than one person simultaneously and consensually, which is distinct yet entwined with polysexuality, the practice of having more than one sexual partner. Polyamory can occur in a social group, culture, or group of people specific to a certain gender-identity or sexual orientation. In some cultures the practice of forming multiple simultaneous romantic relationships is controversial.

Polygamy (a practice that overlaps heavily with polyamory) is the practice of legally marrying more than one person. It is against the law to marry more than one person in the United States; however, there are some countries around the world where polygamy and/or polyamorous relationships are not unusual. For example, it is not uncommon in many middle eastern cultures for men to have multiple wives. This type of polyamorous relationship is known as polygyny, whereas the opposite, in which women have multiple husbands, is called polyandry.

The illegal status of multiple marriages in many parts of the world has not stopped the formation of communities and sub-cultures that practice polyamory and informal polygamy. There are several accounts of attempted private polygamist communities in Western Europe and North America. However, these communities, for the most part, have eventually disbanded. In Western culture there are few or no examples of widespread acceptance of polyamory. This does not mean that polyamorous relationships in Western culture (and subcultures) do not exist. In the United States it is estimated that polyamory is practiced by 4-5% of the population. Polyamory exists mainly as isolated instances in which those in relationships have made agreements with their significant other(s).

==Sexual fetish-based cultures==

The fetish subculture is a subculture that comprises people with a broad range of sexual fetishes and other paraphilias. Alternative terms for the fetish subculture include fetish scene and fetish community.

This subculture is often seen highlighting a strong nightclub scene, in the form of fetish clubs.

Some of the most common paraphilias seen in the fetish subculture include BDSM, leather fetishism and rubber fetishism. The subculture itself allows for people to come together and share their common interests in regards to sexual fetishes, permitting for a safe and supportive environment. However, there is typically a negative stigma associated with this subculture as it encourages the uncommon discussion and indulging of sexual desires in society. This often results in people rejecting such subcultures or associating it with other cultures that explore such topics, thus including the LGBTQ+ culture.

==Influence on mainstream culture==
Sexual minority cultures frequently and consistently influence each other. Yale sociology professor Joshua Gamson argues that the tabloid talk show genre, popularized by Oprah Winfrey in the 1980s provided a much needed, high impact media visibility for sexual minorities and did more to make gay culture mainstream than any other development of the 20th century. Slang frequently originates in subcultures, including sexual minority subcultures, which becomes part of the larger vernacular including words associated with descriptions specific to sexual minorities or not.

Madonna is one of many artists who have borrowed from sexual minority cultures, including her appropriation of vogueing. Recently, the television series &quot;Queer Eye for the Straight Guy&quot; depicts straight men being given fashion make-overs or decorating tips from gay men.

== Non-Western cultures ==

In 2006, Thai film &quot;Rainbow Boys&quot; produced by Vitaya Saeng-aroon, depicting a contemporary gay relationship, had a limited-release screening. Vitaya also produced the comedy-drama &quot;Club M2&quot;, set in a gay sauna.
The significance of the film is found in its novelty in a society very similar, if not more traditional, than the West as regards assigned gender roles and attractions.
Another 2007 film, &quot;Bangkok Love Story&quot;, directed by Poj Arnon, was critically hailed as a departure from the stereotyped view of homosexuals as transvestites and transsexuals. Gay Thai independent film producer Vitaya Saeng-aroon praised the film, saying, &quot;Director Poj Arnon was brave enough to shake society up.&quot;
These people made breakthroughs with their films as other scholars and public authors also began to bring the issue of gender and stereotypes to the forefront as a more &quot;over&quot; the rug topic in contemporary culture.
In many countries, homosexuality and bisexuality are widely accepted and often legal, although often still face discrimination and criticism. In this context, &quot;queer youth are often cast as victims of homophobic violence or heterosexist exclusion in ways that inscribe them within tropes of victimization and risk.&quot;

Unlike European cultures which are primarily based in Christian religion and held up many anti-LGBT laws until recently, the Chinese culture was much more open about non-exclusively-heterosexual relationships. &quot;For a period of the modern history of both the Republic of China and People&#x27;s Republic of China in the 20th century, LGBT people received more stringent legal regulations regarding their orientations, with restrictions being gradually eased by the beginning of the 21st century.&quot; Though there were still restrictions in the ancient Chinese culture, homosexual relations have been documented since early historical periods. There were recordings of subcultures of prostitute/actors also in existence; however, even in modern-day Chinese culture, there are those who are opposed to outside heterosexual relationships and lifestyles. In the People&#x27;s Republic of China, &quot;Reportedly, Mao Zedong believed in the sexual castration of &quot;sexual deviants&quot;, but little is known about the Communist Chinese governments official policy with regards to homosexuality prior to the 1980s.&quot;

Many Japanese have adopted wide ranges of sexual identity, and space has always existed for non-exclusively hegemonic gender roles in Japanese society. The modern era, however, has made more room for those openly varied gender roles. Before Western contact, Japan did not have a system of identification in which one&#x27;s identity was determined by one&#x27;s biological sexual preference (see Sexual minorities in Japan). Yet, hegemonic notions of how men and women &quot;should&quot; behave are still strong in the country, as in the Western cultures. Earlier studies on sex roles and gender identities in Asia focused heavily on particular constraints felt by women, for &quot;&#x27;[Japanese] models of citizenship implicitly privilege the male, white-collar &#x27;citizen in a suit.&#x27;&quot;
Constraints are also felt, however, on the males in Asian societies who are held at a higher standard due to the &quot;dominant paradigm&quot; referred to as &quot;hegemonic masculinity&quot;. Arguments present ideas that &quot;masculinity&quot; has a history and is actually not only expressed differently in different societies but also differently &quot;within&quot; societies throughout eras. Masculinity, even in traditional Asian cultures is, so called, plural.
Still, certain forms of masculinity (and femininity for that matter) become particularly privileged, the hegemonic masculinity.

== Activism and Advocacy ==
=== Early movements ===

LGBTQ+ activism in the United States can be traced back to William Dorsey Swann, the first known person to openly identify as a &quot;queen of drag.&quot; In the late 1800s, Swann organized one of the earliest documented LGBTQ+ gatherings, where attendees, primarily men, dressed in women&#x27;s clothing, marking an early form of organized resistance against discrimination. In 1924, Henry Gerber, a German immigrant and early gay rights advocate, founded the Society for Human Rights in Chicago, one of the first organizations in the U.S. dedicated to advancing homosexual rights. Gerber wrote about homosexual oppression in an attempt to build solidarity and advocate for the community.

In 1950, activist Harry Hay founded the Mattachine Society, one of the earliest enduring LGBTQ+ rights organizations in the U.S. The society worked to raise awareness, educate members, and connect the pursuit of social justice with LGBTQ+ rights. In 1955, Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon established the Daughters of Bilitis, the first organization in the U.S. devoted specifically to lesbian advocacy, providing support, and promoting visibility for lesbian women.

=== LGBTQ+ organizations ===

Numerous organizations emerged in the 20th and 21st centuries to advance LGBTQ+ rights globally. The Human Rights Campaign (HRC) and Lambda Legal are U.S. organizations focused on advancing legal protections and promoting social acceptance for LGBTQ+ individuals, particularly those who are transgender, people of color, or living with HIV, to ensure they are recognized as full and equal citizens. International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans, and Intersex Association (ILGA) campaigns for freedom and equality for all, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity, across continents. OutRight Action International supports LGBTQ+ individuals in restrictive regions, engaging in advocacy, providing legal aid for asylum seekers, and leading crisis interventions for LGBTQ+ communities.

<doc id="68265" wikidata="Q26791" url="?curid=68265" title="Fag hag">
<text>A fag hag is, in gay slang, a woman who associates either mostly or exclusively with gay and bisexual men. The phrase originated in gay male culture in the United States and was historically an insult. Some women who associate with gay men object to being called &quot;fag hags&quot; while others embrace the term. The male counterpart, for heterosexual men who have similar interpersonal relationships with gay and bisexual men, is &quot;fag stag&quot;.

==Usage==
Fag hags are frequently stereotyped as outgoing women who are seeking a substitute for heterosexual relationships, or who are secretly (or openly) sexually attracted to gay men. In fact, many women who identify as fag hags are already in romantic relationships, either with straight men or with women, but seek out the alternative experience of socializing with gay men.

==Related terms==
American &quot;fag hag&quot; synonyms include &quot;fruit fly&quot;, &quot;queen bee&quot;, &quot;homo honey&quot;, &quot;fruit loop&quot;, &quot;Goldilocks&quot;, &quot;flame dame&quot;, &quot;fairy princess&quot;, &quot;gabe&quot; (a portmanteau of &quot;gay&quot; and &quot;babe&quot;), &quot;Tori&quot; (in honor of Tori Spelling and Tori Amos) and &quot;fairy godmother&quot;. Recently, &quot;cherry fairy&quot; has started to catch on as well in some select social groups in San Francisco and the East Coast.

In the case of friendships between lesbians and gay men, the term &quot;dyke diva&quot; describes the gay man in the relationship. A straight man of platonic affinity with gay men is a &quot;fag stag&quot;; again, the usage is rare in mainstream sexual culture.

For men who have many lesbian friends the slang terms &quot;dutch boy&quot;, &quot;lesbro&quot; or &quot;dyke tyke&quot; apply.

Heterosexuals who associate with lesbian, gay, and bisexual people may be called &quot;fruit flies&quot; regardless of their sex.

Fag hags, fag stags, etc. are regarded as belonging to the phenomenon of &quot;hagism&quot;, the attachment of a person to a group defined by sexuality, even though they do not personally share that identity.

In the Philippines, heterosexual women who develop deep friendships or almost exclusively associate with the native &quot;bakla&quot; LGBT subculture are known as &quot;babaeng bakla&quot; (literally &quot;a woman who is a &quot;bakla&quot; [gay man]&quot;). They stereotypically acquire the mannerisms, campy sense of humor, lingo (swardspeak), and fashion sense of the &quot;bakla&quot;. They are also usually more extroverted and socially dominant. It is commonly perceived as a positive self-identification, and various prominent local celebrities (like Maricel Soriano and Rufa Mae Quinto) openly identify as &quot;babaeng bakla&quot;.

&quot;Girlfag&quot; is a term similar to &quot;fag hag&quot;, but designate specifically attraction, either sexually or romantically, to gay men, sometimes to the point of identifying as queer or genderqueer. Men who are attracted to lesbians/sapphics also have their slangs, such as &quot;lesboy&quot;, &quot;guydyke&quot;, and &quot;boydyke&quot;.

==In popular culture==
The term has often been used in entertainment. It was used in the lyrics of hip hop group Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five&#x27;s 1982 hit &quot;The Message&quot;. Comedian Margaret Cho has written and regularly talks in her stand-up routines about being a fag hag. In an episode of the British TV sitcom &quot;Gimme Gimme Gimme&quot;, Tom refers to Linda as a fag hag. The term was used in multiple episodes of the sitcom &quot;Will and Grace&quot; when referring to characters Grace Adler and Karen Walker as their best friends are both gay men. The term was also used in one of the episodes of &quot;Sex and the City&quot;, in which Samantha overheard two women discussing her relationship with the actor Smith Jerrod, calling her a fag hag. English singer Lily Allen released a song called &quot;Fag Hag&quot; in 2008 as the B-side to &quot;The Fear&quot;.

The first annual Miss Fag Hag Pageant took place in New York City on May 17, 2009 at Comix with judges Caroline Rhea, Michael Musto, Hedda Lettuce and Katina Corrao. Heather Shields took the first prize.

<text>Frombork (; ) is a town in northern Poland, situated on the Vistula Lagoon in Braniewo County, within Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship. As of December 2021, it has a population of 2,260.

The town was first mentioned in a 13th-century document. In the early 16th century it was the residence of the astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus, who used it as a site for several of his observations.

The town and its 14th century cathedral were badly damaged in World War II. After the war the cathedral was meticulously reconstructed and is again a popular tourist destination, listed as a Historic Monument of Poland.

Frombork is known as “The Jewel of Warmia” because of its many historical sites. The Museum of Copernicus in Frombork holds exhibitions related to the astronomer, as well as to astronomy in general, and includes a planetarium. One of the biggest attractions is also the annual International Festival of Organ Music, held every summer.

==History==
===Early history===
The town was founded as a defensive stronghold on an Old Prussian site. In 1224 at Catania, Emperor Frederick II declared Prussia directly subordinate to the church and Holy Roman Empire. Later in the same year the pope assigned Bishop William of Modena as the papal legate to Prussia. With the imperial Golden Bull of Rimini, the Teutonic Knights were granted control of the region, which they subsequently conquered. According to a local legend, the Old Prussian inhabitants were baptised by Anselm of Meissen, a priest of the Teutonic Knights and the first Bishop of the Bishopric of Warmia which was created in 1242 by William of Modena.

Supposedly when the stronghold&#x27;s lord died, his widow Gertruda offered the settlement to the bishop, and in her honor it was named &quot;Frauenburg&quot; (German for &quot;Our Lady&#x27;s fortress&quot;, &quot;Castrum Dominae Nostrae&quot; in Latin). This name is not unique in German, as it usually originates in the construction of a fortified chapel, church, or monastery dedicated to the Virgin Mary or inhabited by nuns. Several places were thus named Frauenburg or Marienburg, like the nearby Marienburg castle and city (now Malbork).

The village was first mentioned in a 1278 document signed by Bishop Heinrich Fleming. On 8 July 1310, Bishop Eberhard of Neisse granted the town Lübeck city rights, as used by many member cities of the Hanseatic League. It was described, still rather unspecifically, as &quot;Civitas Warmiensis&quot; (&quot;Warmian city&quot;).

In 1329–1388, the magnificent Brick Gothic cathedral (now the Archcathedral Basilica of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary and Saint Andrew) was built, and was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, or &quot;Our Lady&quot;.

Over the centuries, the cathedral has been expanded and rebuilt repeatedly. There are also several other historic churches, dedicated to St. Nicholas, St. George, and St. Anne, all built in the 13th century.

===Copernican era===
In 1414, the town was plundered and burned during the Hunger War between the Teutonic Knights and Poland. In 1440, the town joined the anti-Teutonic Prussian Confederation, at the request of which Polish King Casimir IV Jagiellon signed the act of incorporation of the region into the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland in 1454. In 1454, the Warmian Chapter paid homage to King Casimir IV Jagiellon, recognizing him as rightful ruler. In retaliation the Teutonic Knights invaded the town in the same year. In 1455, Czech mercenaries in the service of Poland, commanded by Jan Skalski, took back the city. Frombork was recognized as part of the Polish Kingdom by the Second Peace of Thorn (1466). It became an important town of the Prince-Bishopric of Warmia and part of the province of Royal Prussia within the larger Greater Poland Province. The town was also devastated after a raid by Albert, Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights in 1520 during the Polish–Teutonic War of 1519–1521.
In the Middle Ages, the inhabitants were mainly merchants, farmers and fishermen. The most famous resident was the astronomer and mathematician Nicolaus Copernicus, who lived and worked here as a canon (1512–16 and 1522–43). Copernicus is said to have jokingly called it &quot;Weiberstadt&quot; (&quot;Wives&#x27; Town&quot;) or &quot;Gynepolis&quot; (in Medieval Greek). In 1519 Copernicus wrote to the King of Poland, asking for help against the Teutonic Knights who were threatening the city. The letter however was intercepted, and the Teutonic Knights took and burned the city (Copernicus and other canons had left the city shortly before).
The astronomer wrote his epochal work, &quot;De revolutionibus orbium cœlestium&quot; in Frombork. In his book, written in Latin, Copernicus used the Latin name of the town and region - &quot;Frueburgo Prussiae&quot;. Shortly after its 1543 publication, Copernicus died there and was buried in the town&#x27;s cathedral where there is a monument to him bearing the inscription &quot;&quot; (Most renowned astronomer, whose name and glory filled both worlds). His grave was thought to have been found by archaeologists in 2005, when the body was exhumed and subsequently confirmed in November 2008 by the publication of the results of DNA tests on fragments of bone and hair found on the skeleton. The body was reinterred on Sunday May 23, 2010 in the Catholic church of Frombork. Hair that matched two strands of hair which belonged to Copernicus are currently located in Uppsala University.

In the northwest corner of the cathedral grounds is Copernicus&#x27; tower, and in the southwest corner an octagonal building with a square bell tower and a small planetarium and a Foucault&#x27;s pendulum. From atop the tower one can survey the town, the tiny harbor, the panorama of the Baltic Sea, and much of Warmia&#x27;s countryside.

===Modern history===
Frombork suffered destruction and heavy population losses during the Polish–Swedish wars. Between 1626 and 1635 it was occupied by Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden who looted the cathedral and shipped many cultural artifacts, including Copernicus&#x27; manuscripts to Sweden. Further destruction followed during the Deluge (Swedish invasion of Poland of 1655–1660), the Great Northern War and the War of the Fourth Coalition.
After the First Partition of Poland (1772) the town was taken over by the Kingdom of Prussia and in 1773 it became part of the newly established province of East Prussia. Following the unsuccessful Polish November Uprising, hundreds of Polish insurgents, including professors and students of the Wilno University, were interned in the town in 1832. With the unification of Germany in 1871, Frauenburg became part of the German Empire. The &quot;Preußische Ostbahn&quot; railway line was opened in 1899 connecting Elbing (present-day Elbląg) and Braunsberg (present-day Braniewo) via Frauenburg, leading further to the Russian border at Eydtkuhnen (present-day Chernyshevskoye). Passenger services on the railway line ceased in early 2006.

After German surrender in World War II, sovereignty over the town was ceremoniously transferred to Polish authorities on August 5, 1945. The unilateral Soviet transfer of power to Poland was accepted according to the Potsdam Agreement, however, under preliminary terms. Towards and after the end of World War II the German inhabitants had either been evacuated or expelled in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. The town was resettled by Poles, many of whom were expelleés from Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union.

In 1959, Frombork regained its city rights. Having been heavily (70%) damaged in World War II, it was rebuilt by Polish Boy Scouts and others in 1966–1973, in time for the 500th anniversary of Copernicus&#x27; birth. Between 1975 and 1998 Frombork was part of the Elbląg Voivodeship.

Today, Frombork is regaining its importance as a tourist destination, aided by its key location just south of the frontier with the Russian Kaliningrad Oblast. Although the railway through Frombork closed in 2006, the port has seasonal ferry connections with Elbląg, Krynica Morska and Kaliningrad.

*Renaissance water tower, the oldest in Poland
*several historic canonries.

==Monuments==
Several monuments are on display in Frombork (see external links):
* monument to Nicolaus Copernicus, was replaced in the mid-1950s as the monument erected by Imperial Germany&#x27;s Wilhelm II was destroyed in World War II
* monument honoring Red Army soldiers, inscribed: &quot;Glory to the Red Army heroes fallen in liberating Frombork&quot;
* monument to Germans of the former province of East Prussia who drowned in the Vistula Lagoon when fleeing their homeland in 1944–1945, made from a glacial erratic rock found in the water
* memorial honoring the Boy Scouts and others who took part in &quot;Operation 1001&quot; 1966–73, the rebuilding of the town from its devastation in World War II
* Copernicus&#x27; astronomical observatory, work room, instruments and planetarium are on display at Frombork&#x27;s Copernicus Museum

==Transport==
Frombork is located at the intersection of Voivodeship roads 504 and 505.

From Frombork, it is possible to sail from the pier in Krynica Morska by water tram via Tolkmicko or by ship.

Although inactive since 2013, Frombork&#x27;s railway station rests on line No. 254 (formerly &quot;Nadzalewowa Railway&quot;).

In the year 1897, the construction of the Nadzalewowa Railway (&quot;German: Haffuferbahn, HUB&quot;) began - a railway line that was intended by German designers to connect Elbląg with Königsberg (&quot;Polish: Królewiec&quot;). In May 1899, the section from Elbląg to Frombork was completed, and in September, the segment connecting Frombork to Braniewo was put into service.

Regular passenger train service on the route was suspended on April 1, 2006. Since then, only special and freight trains operated here. In the years 2010 and 2011, thanks to the efforts of the Pomorskie Society of Railway Enthusiasts, special services were resumed during the summer, on Saturdays and Sundays, running from Grudziądz and Elbląg to Braniewo, with stops at this station. The last passenger train stopped here on July 7, 2013.

==Sports==
The local football club is Zalew Frombork. It competes in the lower leagues.

==International relations==
===Twin towns - sister cities===
Frombork is twinned with:
* Sucha Beskidzka, Poland
* Kazlų Rūda, Lithuania
* Szypliszki, Poland

===Former twin towns===
* Svetly, Russia
* Myadzyel, Belarus

On 24 March 2022, Frombork terminated its partnership with Russian and Belarusian cities as a response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

<doc id="68272" wikidata="Q75859" url="?curid=68272" title="Trill (music)">
<text>The trill (or shake, as it was known from the 16th until the early 20th century) is a musical ornament consisting of a rapid alternation between two adjacent notes, usually a semitone or tone apart, which can be identified with the context of the trill (compare mordent and tremolo). It is sometimes referred to by the German Triller, the Italian trillo, the French trille or the Spanish trino. A cadential trill is a trill associated with each cadence. A groppo or gruppo is a specific type of cadential trill which alternates with the auxiliary note directly above it and ends with a musical turn as additional ornamentation. 

A trill provides rhythmic interest, melodic interest, and—through dissonance—harmonic interest. Sometimes it is expected that the trill will end with a turn (by sounding the note below rather than the note above the principal note, immediately before the last sounding of the principal note), or some other variation. Such variations are often marked with a few appoggiaturas following the note bearing the trill indication.

== Notation ==
In most modern musical notation, a trill is generally indicated with the letters (or sometimes simply ) above the trilled note. This has sometimes been followed by a wavy line, and sometimes, in the baroque and early classical periods, the wavy line was used on its own. In those times the symbol was known as a chevron. The following two notations are equivalent:

:&lt;score lang=&quot;lilypond&quot;&gt; {
 \relative c&quot; {
 \time 2/4
 g2\trill
 g\startTrillSpan \stopTrillSpan
}
&lt;/score&gt;

Both the &quot;&quot; and the wavy line are necessary for clarity when the trill is expected to be applied to more than one note (or to tied notes). Also, when attached to a single notehead in one part that corresponds to smaller note values in another part, it leaves no room for doubt if both the letter and line are used.

The usual way of executing a trill, known as a diatonic trill, is to rapidly alternate between the written note and the one directly above it in the given scale (unless the trill symbol is modified by an accidental, understood to apply to the added note above; this is a chromatic trill).

:&lt;score vorbis=&quot;1&quot;&gt; {
 \relative c&quot; {
 \time 2/4
 g32[ a g \set stemRightBeamCount = #1 a \set stemLeftBeamCount = #1 g a g a]
 g32[ a g \set stemRightBeamCount = #1 a \set stemLeftBeamCount = #1 g a g a]
}
&lt;/score&gt;

Listen to an example of a short passage ending on a trill. The first time, the passage ends in a trill, and the second, it does not.

This is an alternative trill:

:&lt;score vorbis=&quot;1&quot;&gt; {
 \relative c&quot; {
 \time 2/4
 a32[ g a \set stemRightBeamCount = #1 g \set stemLeftBeamCount = #1 a g a g]
 a32[ g a \set stemRightBeamCount = #1 g \set stemLeftBeamCount = #1 a g a g]
}
&lt;/score&gt;

These examples are approximations of how trills may be executed. In many cases, the rate of the trill does not remain constant as indicated here, but starts slower and increases. Whether it is played this way or not is largely a matter of taste.

The number of alternations between the notes played in a trill can vary according to the length of the notated note. At slower tempos, a written note lasts longer, meaning more notes can be played in the trill applied to it; but at fast tempi and with a short note, a trill may be reduced to nothing more than the indicated note, the note above it, and the indicated note again, in which case it resembles an upper mordent. 

Trills may also be started on the note above the notated note (the &quot;auxiliary note&quot;). Additionally, a trill is often ended by playing the note &quot;below&quot; the notated one, followed by the note itself.

== In specific styles ==
=== In baroque music ===

Hugo Riemann described the trill as &quot;the chief and most frequent&quot; of all musical embellishments. In the baroque period, a number of signs indicating specific patterns with which a trill should be begun or ended were used. In the &quot;Klavierbüchlein für Wilhelm Friedemann Bach&quot;, Johann Sebastian Bach lists a number of these signs together with the correct way to interpret them. Unless one of these specific signs is indicated, the details of how to play the trill are up to the performer. In general, however, trills in this era are executed beginning on the auxiliary note, before the written note, often producing the effect of a harmonic suspension which resolves to the principal note. But, if the note preceding the ornamented note is itself one scale degree above the principal note, then the dissonant note has already been stated, and the trill typically starts on the principal note.

Several trill symbols and techniques common in the Baroque and early Classical era have fallen entirely out of use, including for instance the brief &quot;Pralltriller&quot;, represented by a very brief wavy line, referred to by Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach in his &quot;Essay on the True Art of Playing Keyboard Instruments&quot; (&quot;Versuch&quot;) (1753–1762).

Beyond the baroque era, specific signs for ornamentation are very rare. Continuing through the time of Mozart, the default expectations for the interpretation of trills continued to be similar to those of the baroque. In music after the time of Mozart, the trill usually begins on the principal note.

All of these are only rules of thumb, and, together with the overall rate of the trill and whether that rate is constant or variable, can only be determined by considering the context in which the trill appears, and is usually to a large degree a matter of opinion with no single &quot;right&quot; way of executing the ornament.

== On specific instruments ==
The trill is frequently found in classical music for all instruments, although it is more easily executed on some than others. For example, while it is relatively easy to produce a trill on the flute, the proper execution on brass instruments requires higher skill and is produced by quickly alternating partials. While playing a trill on the piano the pianist may find that it becomes increasingly difficult to execute a trill including the weak fingers of the hand (3, 4 and 5), with a trill consisting of 4 and 5 being the hardest. On the guitar, a trill can be either a series of hammer-ons and pull-offs (generally executed using just the fingers of the fretting hand, but players can use both hands), or a rapidly plucked pair of notes on adjacent strings, known as a cross-string trill. Trill keys are used to rapidly alternate between a note and an adjacent note often in another register on woodwind instruments. On the bowed instruments, the violin and the viola in particular, the trill is relatively easy to execute, with a straightforward bowing and the trill involving the oscillation of just one finger against the main note which is stopped by the finger behind, or more rarely, the open string.

=== On brass instruments ===
Trills may be performed on valveless brass instruments by rapidly slurring between two adjacent notes by means of the embouchure – this is colloquially known as a &quot;lip trill.&quot; This was a common practice on the natural trumpets and natural horns of the Baroque/Classical era. However the lip trill is often still used in the modern French horn in places where the harmonics are only a tone apart (though this can be difficult for inexperienced players). Such trills are also a stylistic feature of jazz music, particularly in trumpet parts.

=== Vocal trills ===
Vocal music of the classical tradition has included a variety of ornaments known as trills since the time of Giulio Caccini. In the preface to his Le nuove musiche, he describes both the &quot;shake&quot; (what is commonly known today as the trill) and the &quot;trill&quot; (now often called a Baroque or Monteverdi trill). However, by the time of the Italian bel canto composers such as Rossini, Donizetti and Bellini, the rapid alternation between two notes that Caccini describes as a shake was known as a trill and was preferred.

Coloratura singers, particularly the high-voiced sopranos and tenors, are frequently required to trill not only in the works of these composers but in much of their repertoire. Soprano Dame Joan Sutherland was particularly famed for the evenness and rapidity of her trill, and stated in an interview that she &quot;never really had to learn how to trill&quot;. The trill is usually a feature of an ornamented solo line, but choral or chorus trills do appear.

Despite the trill being written in many works for voice, a singer with an even, rapid trill is a rarity. Opinion is divided as to if and how well a trill can be taught or learnt, though mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne frequently stated that she gained her trill by a commonly taught exercise, alternating between two notes, starting slowly and increasing velocity over time. The director of the Rossini Opera Festival, Alberto Zedda has opined in interview that the &quot;widespread technical deficiency&quot;, the inability to trill, is a source of &quot;frustration and anguish&quot;. In fact, whole performances and recordings, especially of bel canto works, have been judged based on performance—or lack thereof—of trills, especially trills written &quot;in the score&quot; as opposed to trills in a cadenza or variation.

==Trillo==

The word &quot;trillo&quot; is sometimes used to mean the same as trill. However, in early music some refer to a related ornament specifically called &quot;trillo&quot;:

Montserrat Caballé was a known exponent of the &quot;trillo&quot;, as can be heard from her famous 1974 &quot;Norma&quot;.

<text>The Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam (PRG, ), was formed on 8 June 1969, by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam) as an armed underground government opposing the government of the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam) under President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu. Delegates of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam (Viet Cong), as well as several smaller groups, participated in its creation.

The PRG was recognized as the government of South Vietnam by most socialist states and Malta. It signed the 1973 Paris Peace Treaty as an independent entity, separate from both South Vietnam and North Vietnam. After the Fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975, the PRG formally replaced the Republic of Vietnam to become the nominal and representative government of South Vietnam under the official name Republic of South Vietnam (), inheriting all properties, rights, obligations and sovereignty representation of the Republic of Vietnam. On 2 July 1976, the Republic of South Vietnam and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam constitutionally merged to form the current Socialist Republic of Vietnam.

==History==
The Provisional Revolutionary Government was preceded by the &quot;Vietnam Alliance of National, Democratic, and Peaceful Forces&quot; (VANDPF) made up of anti-government forces and headed by Trinh Dinh Thao. The Alliance was a collection of individuals who wanted a new South Vietnamese government but disagreed with the ever-present Northern Communist presence.

Discussions about forming an alliance had begun as early as 1966, but plans were disrupted when South Vietnamese intelligence agents apprehended a prominent anti-government figure, Ba Tra. Ba Tra gave the South Vietnamese government extensive information on anti-government forces working in the city. This setback was compounded by his identification of one of the key cadre in the financial division.

Under torture, Ba Tra identified more figures in the underground, who were then arrested. By 1967, the entire Saigon organization had been sent further underground.

In early 1969, the then-new American president, Richard Nixon, started a process of Vietnamization to allow the American Armed Forces to withdraw from South Vietnam.

=== 1969–1975 ===
On 8 June 1969 delegates from the Vietcong, the VANDPF, the People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party (the South Vietnamese communist party) and &quot;the usual assortment of mass organizations, ethnic groups, and geopolitical regions.&quot; met off Route 22 in Cambodia&#x27;s Fishhook region and formed the Provisional Revolutionary Government (PRG). Banners displayed prominently at the convention proclaimed that &quot;South Vietnam is independent, democratic, peaceful, and neutral&quot;.

Following the military and political results of the 1968 Tet Offensive and related military offensives in the South by Saigon and America, in which the Vietcong suffered serious military losses, the PRG was envisioned as a political counter-force that could influence international public opinion in support of reunification and in opposition to the United States and South Vietnam.

The declared purpose of the PRG was to provide a formal governmental structure to the NLF and enhance its claim of representing &quot;the Southern people&quot;. Included in this strategy was the pursuit of a negotiated settlement to the war leading to reunification, organized during the initial phase of Vietnamization. According to Justice Minister Trương Như Tảng, the new group&#x27;s main purpose was to help the NLF &quot;acquire a new international stature.&quot;

During the period 1969–70, most of the PRG&#x27;s cabinet ministries operated near the Cambodian border. Starting on 29 March to late April 1970, the US and South Vietnamese offensives forced the PRG to flee deeper into Cambodia. The stressful escape caused many of the PRG officials (such as Trương Như Tạng) to need extensive medical furloughs. After Trương Như Tạng returned, he noticed that new cadres from the north were causing problems for the non-communist members of the PRG. One member in particular, Ba Cap, harshly denounced most of the PRG as bourgeois. Tạng complained to the higher members of the DRV government, but was rebuffed. Tạng later saw this as the point when the PRG turned from being an independent South Vietnam-based alternative government to being a mouthpiece for the communist movement.

The central bodies of the PRG functioned as a provisional government. The PRG maintained diplomatic relations with many countries of the Non-Aligned Movement, such as Algeria and SFR Yugoslavia as well as with the Soviet Union and the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

=== 1975–1976 ===
After the Fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975, the PRG assumed power in South Vietnam and subsequently participated in the reunification of Vietnam.

According to professor Ngô Vĩnh Long (University of Maine), mid-July 1975, the delegates of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (Nguyễn Văn Lưu) and the Republic of South Vietnam (Đinh Bá Thi) applied to join the United Nations (UN) as two independent member states. However, both countries failed in joining the United Nations due to American vetoes on 11 August and 30 September 1975 as the USSR and China refused to allow South Korea to join the organization on 6 August. However, North Vietnam and North Vietnam-controlled South Vietnam became two UN observers in 1975. Kuwait was the last country to recognize and establish diplomatic relations with the Republic of South Vietnam on 22 and 24 January 1976, before North and South Vietnam were eventually reunited on 2 July 1976.

The national anthem of the Government was &quot;Liberate the South&quot; (Vietnamese: ). The song was written in 1961 by Lưu Hữu Phước (1921–1989) and adopted at that time as the anthem of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam (Viet Cong).

In 1966, Lưu Hữu Phước wrote a military song &quot;&quot; () as an encouragement the soldiers going to attack Saigon in the Tet Offensive. The song was spread again during the fall of Saigon.

<doc id="68274" wikidata="Q161853" url="?curid=68274" title="Hero of Alexandria">
<text>Hero of Alexandria (; , , also known as Heron of Alexandria ; probably 1st or 2nd century AD) was a Greek mathematician and engineer who was active in Alexandria in Egypt during the Roman era. He has been described as the greatest experimentalist of antiquity and a representative of the Hellenistic scientific tradition.

Hero published a well-recognized description of a steam-powered device called an &quot;aeolipile&quot;, also known as &quot;Hero&#x27;s engine&quot;. Among his most famous inventions was a windwheel, constituting the earliest instance of wind harnessing on land. In his work &quot;Mechanics&quot;, he described pantographs. Some of his ideas were derived from the works of Ctesibius.

In mathematics, he wrote a commentary on Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; and a work on applied geometry known as the &quot;Metrica&quot;. He is mostly remembered for Heron&#x27;s formula; a way to calculate the area of a triangle using only the lengths of its sides.

Much of Hero&#x27;s original writings and designs have been lost, but some of his works were preserved in manuscripts from the Byzantine Empire and, to a lesser extent, in Latin or Arabic translations.

== Life and career ==
Almost nothing is known about Hero&#x27;s life, including his birthplace and background. The first extant mention of him is references to his works found in Book VIII of Pappus&#x27;s &quot;Collection&quot; (4th century AD), and scholarly estimates for Hero&#x27;s dates range from 150 BC to 250 AD. Otto Neugebauer (1938) noted a lunar eclipse observed in Alexandria and Rome used as a hypothetical example in Hero&#x27;s &quot;Dioptra&quot;, and found that it best matched the details of an eclipse in 62 AD; A. G. Drachmann subsequently surmised that Hero personally observed the eclipse from Alexandria. However, Hero does not explicitly say this, his brief mention of the eclipse is vague, and he might instead have used some earlier observer&#x27;s data or even made up the example.

Alexandria was founded by Alexander the Great in the 4th century BC, and by Hero&#x27;s time was a cosmopolitan city, part of the Roman Empire. The intellectual community, centered around the Mouseion (which included the Library of Alexandria), spoke and wrote in Greek; however, there was considerable intermarriage between the city&#x27;s Greek and Egyptian populations. It has been inferred that Hero taught at the Mouseion because some of his writings appear to be lecture notes or textbooks in mathematics, mechanics, physics and pneumatics. Although the field was not formalized until the twentieth century, it is thought that works of Hero, in particular those on his automated devices, represented some of the first formal research into cybernetics.

=== Inventions ===

A number of devices and inventions have been ascribed to Hero, including the following:

* The &quot;aeolipile&quot; (a version of which is known as &quot;Hero&#x27;s engine&quot;), which was a rocket-like reaction engine and the first-recorded steam engine (although Vitruvius mentioned the aeolipile in &quot;De Architectura&quot;, presumably earlier than Hero). Another engine used air from a closed chamber heated by an altar fire to displace water from a sealed vessel; the water was collected and its weight, pulling on a rope, opened temple doors. Some historians have conflated the two inventions to assert that the aeolipile was capable of useful work.
* A vending machine that dispensed a set amount of water for ablutions when a coin was introduced via a slot on the top of the machine. This was included in his list of inventions in his book &quot;Mechanics&quot;. When the coin was deposited, it fell upon a pan attached to a lever. The lever opened up a valve which let some water flow out. The pan continued to tilt with the weight of the coin until it fell off, at which point a counter-weight would snap the lever back up and turn off the valve.
* A wind-wheel operating an organ, marking the first documented instance of wind powering a machine.
* Many mechanisms for the Greek theatre, including an entirely mechanical play almost ten minutes in length, powered by a system of ropes, knots, and simple machines operated by a rotating cylindrical cogwheel. The sound of thunder was produced by the mechanically-timed dropping of metal balls onto a hidden drum.
* A force pump that was widely used in the Roman world, and one application was in a fire engine.
* A syringe-like device was described by Hero to control the delivery of air or liquids.
* A stand-alone fountain that operates under self-contained hydro-static energy; now called Heron&#x27;s fountain.
* A cart that was powered by a falling weight and strings wrapped around the drive axle.
* A kind of thermometer has been credited to Hero. Although the thermometer was not a single invention but a development, Hero knew of the principle that certain substances, notably air, expand and contract and described a demonstration in which a closed tube partially filled with air had its end in a container of water. The expansion and contraction of the air caused the position of the water/air interface to move along the tube.
* A self-filling wine bowl, using a float valve.

=== Mathematics ===
Hero described an iterative algorithm for computing square roots, now called Heron&#x27;s method, in his work &quot;Metrica&quot;, alongside other algorithms and approximations. Today, however, his name is most closely associated with Heron&#x27;s formula for the area of a triangle in terms of its side lengths. Hero also reported on a method for calculating cube roots. In solid geometry, the Heronian mean may be used in finding the volume of a frustum of a pyramid or cone. 

Hero also described a shortest path algorithm, that is, given two points A and B on one side of a line, find a point C on the straight line that minimizes AC + BC. This led him to formulate the principle of the shortest path of light: If a ray of light propagates from point A to point B within the same medium, the path-length followed is the shortest possible. In the Middle Ages, Ibn al-Haytham expanded the principle to both reflection and refraction, and the principle was later stated in this form by Pierre de Fermat in 1662; the most modern form is that the optical path is stationary.

==Bibliography==
The most comprehensive edition of Hero&#x27;s works was published in five volumes in Leipzig by the publishing house Teubner in 1903.

Works known to have been written by Hero include:
*&quot;Pneumatica&quot; (Πνευματικά), a description of machines working on air, steam or water pressure, including the &quot;hydraulis&quot; or water organ
*&quot;Automata&quot;, a description of machines which enable wonders in banquets and possibly also theatrical contexts by mechanical or pneumatical means (e.g. automatic opening or closing of temple doors, statues that pour wine and milk, etc.)
*&quot;Belopoeica&quot;, a description of war machines
*&quot;Dioptra&quot;, a collection of methods to measure lengths, where the odometer and the dioptra (an apparatus resembling the theodolite) are described
*&quot;Metrica&quot;, a work describing how to calculate surface areas and volumes of diverse geometrical objects

Works that have been preserved only in Arabic translations:
*&quot;Mechanica&quot;, written for architects, containing means to lift heavy objects
*&quot;Catoptrica&quot;, about the progression of light, reflection and the use of mirrors

Works that sometimes have been attributed to Hero, but are now thought most likely to have been written by someone else:
*&quot;Geometrica&quot;, a collection of problems similar to the first chapter of &quot;Metrica&quot;
*&quot;Stereometrica&quot;, examples of three-dimensional calculations similar to the second chapter of &quot;Metrica&quot;
*&quot;Mensurae&quot;, tools which can be used to conduct measurements for problems based on &quot;Stereometrica&quot; and &quot;Metrica&quot;
*&quot;Cheiroballistra&quot;, about catapults
*&quot;Definitiones&quot;, containing definitions of terms for geometry

Works that are preserved only in fragments:
*&quot;Geodesia&quot;
*&quot;Geoponica&quot;
*A commentary to Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;, attested by Arabic authors but no longer extant

<text>Microtonality is the use in music of microtones — intervals smaller than a semitone, also called &quot;microintervals&quot;. It may also be extended to include any music using intervals not found in the customary Western tuning of twelve equal intervals per octave. In other words, a microtone may be thought of as a note that falls &quot;between the keys&quot; of a piano tuned in equal temperament.

==Terminology==

=== Microtone ===
&quot;Microtonal music&quot; can refer to any music containing microtones. The words &quot;microtone&quot; and &quot;microtonal&quot; were coined before 1912 by Maud MacCarthy Mann in order to avoid the misnomer &quot;quarter tone&quot; when speaking of the srutis of Indian music. Prior to this time the term &quot;quarter tone&quot; was used, confusingly, not only for an interval actually half the size of a semitone, but also for all intervals (considerably) smaller than a semitone. It may have been even slightly earlier, perhaps as early as 1895, that the Mexican composer Julián Carrillo, writing in Spanish or French, coined the terms &quot;microtono&quot;/&quot;micro-ton&quot; and &quot;microtonalismo&quot;/&quot;micro-tonalité&quot;.

In French, the usual term is the somewhat more self-explanatory &quot;micro-intervalle&quot;, and French sources give the equivalent German and English terms as &quot;Mikrointervall&quot; (or &quot;Kleinintervall&quot;) and &quot;micro interval&quot; (or &quot;microtone&quot;), respectively. &quot;Microinterval&quot; is a frequent alternative in English, especially in translations of writings by French authors and in discussion of music by French composers. In English, the two terms &quot;microtone&quot; and &quot;microinterval&quot; are synonymous. The English analogue of the related French term, &quot;micro-intervalité&quot;, however, is rare or nonexistent, normally being translated as &quot;microtonality&quot;; in French, the terms &quot;micro-ton&quot;, &quot;microtonal&quot; (or &quot;micro-tonal&quot;), and &quot;microtonalité&quot; are also sometimes used, occasionally mixed in the same passage with &quot;micro-intervale&quot; and &quot;micro-intervalité&quot;.

Ezra Sims, in the article &quot;Microtone&quot; in the second edition of the &quot;Harvard Dictionary of Music&quot; defines &quot;microtone&quot; as &quot;an interval smaller than a semitone&quot;, which corresponds with Aristoxenus&#x27;s use of the term &quot;diesis&quot;. However, the unsigned article &quot;Comma, Schisma&quot; in the same reference source calls comma, schisma, and diaschisma &quot;microintervals&quot; but not &quot;microtones&quot;, and in the fourth edition of the same reference (which retains Sims&#x27;s article on &quot;Microtone&quot;) a new &quot;Comma, Schisma&quot; article by André Barbera calls them simply &quot;intervals&quot;. In the second edition of &quot;The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;, Paul Griffiths, Mark Lindley, and Ioannis Zannos define &quot;microtone&quot; as a musical rather than an acoustical entity: &quot;any musical interval or difference of pitch distinctly smaller than a semitone&quot;, including &quot;the tiny enharmonic melodic intervals of ancient Greece, the several divisions of the octave into more than 12 parts, and various discrepancies among the intervals of just intonation or between a sharp and its enharmonically paired flat in various forms of mean-tone temperament&quot;, as well as the Indian sruti, and small intervals used in Byzantine chant, Arabic music theory from the 10th century onward, and similarly for Persian traditional music and Turkish music and various other Near Eastern musical traditions, but do not actually name the &quot;mathematical&quot; terms schisma, comma, and diaschisma.

&quot;Microtone&quot; is also sometimes used to refer to individual notes, &quot;microtonal pitches&quot; added to and distinct from the familiar twelve notes of the chromatic scale, as &quot;enharmonic microtones&quot;, for example.

In English the word &quot;microtonality&quot; is mentioned in 1946 by Rudi Blesh who related it to microtonal inflexions of the so-called &quot;blues scales&quot;. In Court B. Cutting&#x27;s 2019 &quot;Microtonal Analysis of “Blues Notes” and the Blues Scale&quot;, he states that academic studies of the early blues concur that its pitch scale has within it three microtonal “blue notes” not found in 12 tone equal temperament intonation. It was used still earlier by W. McNaught with reference to developments in &quot;modernism&quot; in a 1939 record review of the &quot;Columbia History of Music, Vol. 5&quot;. In German the term &quot;Mikrotonalität&quot; came into use at least by 1958, though &quot;Mikrointervall&quot; is still common today in contexts where very small intervals of early European tradition (diesis, comma, etc.) are described, as e.g. in the new &quot;Geschichte der Musiktheorie&quot; while &quot;Mikroton&quot; seems to prevail in discussions of the avant-garde music and music of Eastern traditions. The term &quot;microinterval&quot; is used alongside &quot;microtone&quot; by American musicologist Margo Schulter in her articles on medieval music.

=== Microtonal ===
The term &quot;microtonal music&quot; usually refers to music containing very small intervals but can include any tuning that differs from Western twelve-tone equal temperament. Traditional Indian systems of 22 śruti; Indonesian gamelan music; Thai, Burmese, and African music, and music using just intonation, meantone temperament or other alternative tunings may be considered microtonal. Microtonal variation of intervals is standard practice in the African-American musical forms of spirituals, blues, and jazz.

Many microtonal equal divisions of the octave have been proposed, usually (but not always) in order to achieve approximation to the intervals of just intonation.

Terminology other than &quot;microtonal&quot; has been used or proposed by some theorists and composers. In 1914, A. H. Fox Strangways objected that &quot;&#x27;heterotone&#x27; would be a better name for śruti than the usual translation &#x27;microtone&#x27;&quot;. Modern Indian researchers yet write: &quot;microtonal intervals called shrutis&quot;. In Germany, Austria, and Czechoslovakia in the 1910s and 1920s the usual term continued to be &quot;Viertelton-Musik&quot; (quarter tone music), and the type of intervallic structure found in such music was called the &quot;Vierteltonsystem&quot;, which was (in the mentioned region) regarded as the main term for referring to music with microintervals, though as early as 1908 Georg Capellan had qualified his use of &quot;quarter tone&quot; with the alternative term &quot;Bruchtonstufen (Viertel- und Dritteltöne)&quot; (fractional degrees (quarter and third tones)). Despite the inclusion of other fractions of a whole tone, this music continued to be described under the heading &quot;Vierteltonmusik&quot; until at least the 1990s, for example in the twelfth edition of the &quot;Riemann Musiklexikon&quot;, and in the second edition of the popular &quot;Brockhaus Riemann Musiklexikon&quot;.

Ivan Wyschnegradsky used the term &quot;ultra-chromatic&quot; for intervals smaller than the semitone and &quot;infra-chromatic&quot; for intervals larger than the semitone; this same term has been used since 1934 by ethnomusicologist Victor Belaiev (Belyaev) in his studies of Azerbaijan and Turkish traditional music. A similar term, &quot;subchromatic&quot;, has been used by theorist Marek Žabka. Ivor Darreg proposed the term &quot;xenharmonic&quot; in March 1966; see xenharmonic music. The Austrian composer and the music theorist Rolf Maedel, Herf&#x27;s colleague at the Salzburg Mozarteum, preferred using the Greek word &quot;ekmelic&quot; when referring to &quot;all the pitches lying outside the traditional twelve-tone system&quot;. Some authors in Russia and some musicology dissertations disseminate the term &quot;микрохроматика&quot; (microchromatics), coined in the 1970s by Yuri Kholopov, to describe a kind of &#x27;intervallic genus&#x27; (интервальный род) for all possible microtonal structures, both ancient (as enharmonic genus—γένος ἐναρμόνιον—of Greeks) and modern (as quarter tone scales of Alois Haba); this generalization term allowed also to avoid derivatives such as &quot;микротональность&quot; (microtonality, which could be understood in Russian as a sub-tonality, which is subordinate to the dominating tonality, especially in the context of European music of the 19th century) and &quot;микротоника&quot; (microtonic, &quot;a barely perceptible tonic&quot;; see a clarification in Kholopov [2000]). Other Russian authors use the more international adjective &#x27;microtonal&#x27; and have rendered it in Russian as &#x27;микротоновый&#x27;, but not &#x27;microtonality&#x27; (&#x27;микротональность&#x27;). However, the terms &#x27;микротональность&#x27; and &#x27;микротоника&#x27; are also used. Some authors writing in French have adopted the term &quot;micro-intervallique&quot; to describe such music. Italian musicologist Luca Conti dedicated two of his monographs to &quot;microtonalismo&quot;, which is the usual term in Italian, and also in Spanish (e.g., as found in the title of Rué [2000]). The analogous English form, &quot;microtonalism&quot;, is also found occasionally instead of &quot;microtonality&quot;, e.g., &quot;At the time when serialism and neoclassicism were still incipient a third movement emerged: microtonalism&quot;.

The term &quot;macrotonal&quot; has been used for intervals wider than twelve-tone equal temperament, or where there are &quot;fewer than twelve notes per octave&quot;, though &quot;this term is not very satisfactory and is used only because there seems to be no other&quot;. The term &quot;macrotonal&quot; has also been used for musical form.

Examples of this can be found in various places, ranging from Claude Debussy&#x27;s impressionistic harmonies to Aaron Copland&#x27;s chords of stacked fifths, to John Luther Adams&#x27; &quot;Clouds of Forgetting&quot;, &quot;Clouds of Unknowing&quot; (1995), which gradually expands stacked-interval chords ranging from minor 2nds to major 7thsm. Louis Andriessen&#x27;s &quot;De Staat&quot; (1972–1976) contains a number of &quot;augmented&quot; modes that are based on Greek scales but are asymmetrical to the octave.

==History==
The Hellenic civilizations of ancient Greece left fragmentary records of their music, such as the Delphic Hymns. The ancient Greeks approached the creation of different musical intervals and modes by dividing and combining tetrachords, recognizing three genera of tetrachords: the enharmonic, the chromatic, and the diatonic. Ancient Greek intervals were of many different sizes, including microtones. The enharmonic genus in particular featured intervals of a distinctly &quot;microtonal&quot; nature, which were sometimes smaller than 50 cents, less than half of the contemporary Western semitone of 100 cents. In the ancient Greek enharmonic genus, the tetrachord contained a semitone of varying sizes (approximately 100 cents) divided into two equal intervals called dieses (single &quot;diesis&quot;, ); in conjunction with a larger interval of roughly 400 cents, these intervals comprised the perfect fourth (approximately 498 cents, or the frequency ratio of in just intonation). Theoretics usually described several diatonic and chromatic genera (some as chroai, &quot;coloration&quot; of one specific intervallic type), but the enarmonic genus was always the only one (argumented as one with the smallest intervals possible).
Guillaume Costeley&#x27;s &quot;Chromatic Chanson&quot;, &quot;Seigneur Dieu ta pitié&quot; of 1558 used meantone (which almost exactly equals 19 equal temperament) and explored the full compass of 19 pitches in the octave.

The Italian Renaissance composer and theorist Nicola Vicentino (1511–1576) worked with microtonal intervals and built a keyboard with 36 keys to the octave known as the archicembalo. While theoretically an interpretation of ancient Greek tetrachordal theory, in effect Vicentino presented a circulating system of quarter-comma meantone, maintaining major thirds tuned in just intonation in all keys.

In 1760 the French flautist published a treatise, &quot;L&#x27;Art de la flute traversiere&quot;, all surviving copies of which conclude with a composition (possibly added a year or two after the actual publication of the volume) incorporating several quarter tones, titled &quot;Air à la grecque&quot;, accompanied by explanatory notes tying it to the realization of the Greek enharmonic genus and a chart of quarter tone fingerings for the entire range of the one-keyed flute. Shortly afterward, in a letter published in the &quot;Mercure de France&quot; in September 1764, the celebrated flautist Pierre-Gabriel Buffardin mentioned this piece and expressed an interest in quarter tones for the flute.

Jacques Fromental Halévy composed a cantata &quot;Prométhée enchaîné&quot; for a solo voice, choir and orchestra (premiered in 1849), where in one movement (&quot;Choeur des Océanides&quot;) he used quarter tones, to imitate the enharmonic genus of Greeks.

In the 1910s and 1920s, quarter tones received attention from such composers as Charles Ives, Julián Carrillo, Alois Hába, Ivan Wyschnegradsky, and Mildred Couper.

Alexander John Ellis, who in the 1880s produced a translation of Hermann Helmholtz&#x27;s &quot;On the Sensations of Tone&quot;, proposed an elaborate set of exotic just intonation tunings and non-harmonic tunings. Ellis also studied the tunings of non-Western cultures and, in a report to the Royal Society, stated that they used neither equal divisions of the octave nor just intonation intervals. Ellis inspired Harry Partch immensely.

During the Exposition Universelle of 1889, Claude Debussy heard a Balinese gamelan performance and was exposed to non-Western tunings and rhythms. Some scholars have ascribed Debussy&#x27;s subsequent innovative use of the whole-tone (six equal pitches per octave) tuning in such compositions as the &quot;Fantaisie for piano and orchestra&quot; and the Toccata from the suite &quot;Pour le piano&quot; to his exposure to the Balinese gamelan at the Paris exposition, and have asserted his rebellion at this time &quot;against the rule of equal temperament&quot; and that the gamelan gave him &quot;the confidence to embark (after the 1900 world exhibition) on his fully characteristic mature piano works, with their many bell- and gong-like sonorities and brilliant exploitation of the piano&#x27;s natural resonance&quot;. Still others have argued that Debussy&#x27;s works like &quot;L&#x27;isle joyeuse&quot;, &quot;La cathédrale engloutie&quot;, &quot;Prélude à l&#x27;après-midi d&#x27;un faune&quot;, &quot;La mer&quot;, &quot;Pagodes&quot;, &quot;Danseuses de Delphes&quot;, and &quot;Cloches à travers les feuilles&quot; are marked by a more basic interest in the microtonal intervals found between the higher members of the overtone series, under the influence of Helmholtz&#x27;s writings. Emil Berliner&#x27;s introduction of the phonograph in the 1890s allowed much non-Western music to be recorded and heard by Western composers, further spurring the use of non- tunings.

Major microtonal composers of the 1920s and 1930s include Alois Hába (quarter tones, or 24 equal pitches per octave, and sixth tones), Julián Carrillo (, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 96 equal pitches to the octave embodied in a series of specially custom-built pianos), Ivan Wyschnegradsky (third tones, quarter tones, sixth tones and twelfth tones, non octaving scales) and the early works of Harry Partch (just intonation using frequencies at ratios of prime integers 3, 5, 7, and 11, their powers, and products of those numbers, from a central frequency of G-196).

Prominent microtonal composers or researchers of the 1940s and 1950s include Adriaan Daniel Fokker (), Partch (continuing to build his handcrafted orchestra of microtonal just intonation instruments), and Eivind Groven.

Digital synthesizers from the Yamaha TX81Z (1987) on and inexpensive software synthesizers have contributed to the ease and popularity of exploring microtonal music.

==Microtonality in electronic music==
Electronic music facilitates the use of any kind of microtonal tuning, and sidesteps the need to develop new notational systems. In 1954, Karlheinz Stockhausen built his electronic &quot;Studie II&quot; on an 81-step scale starting from 100 Hz with the interval of 51/25 between steps, and in &quot;Gesang der Jünglinge&quot; (1955–56) he used various scales, ranging from seven up to sixty equal divisions of the octave. In 1955, Ernst Krenek used 13 equal-tempered intervals per octave in his Whitsun oratorio, &quot;Spiritus intelligentiae, sanctus&quot;.

In 1979–80 Easley Blackwood composed a set of &quot;Twelve Microtonal Etudes for Electronic Music Media,&quot; a cycle that explores all of the equal temperaments from 13 notes to the octave through 24 notes to the octave, including 15-ET and 19-ET. &quot;The project,&quot; he wrote, &quot;was to explore the tonal and modal behavior of all [of these] equal tunings..., devise a notation for each tuning, and write a composition in each tuning to illustrate good chord progressions and the practical application of the notation&quot;.

In 1986, Wendy Carlos experimented with many microtonal systems including just intonation, using alternate tuning scales she invented for the album &quot;Beauty In the Beast&quot;. &quot;This whole formal discovery came a few weeks after I had completed the album, &quot;Beauty in the Beast&quot;, which is wholly in new tunings and timbres&quot;.

In 2016, electronic music composed with arbitrary microtonal scales was explored on the album &quot;Radionics Radio: An Album of Musical Radionic Thought Frequencies&quot; by British composer Daniel Wilson, who derived his compositions&#x27; tunings from frequency-runs submitted by users of a custom-built web application replicating radionics-based electronic soundmaking equipment used by Oxford&#x27;s De La Warr Laboratories in the late 1940s, thereby supposedly embodying thoughts and concepts within the tunings.

Finnish artist Aleksi Perälä works exclusively in a microtonal system known as the Colundi sequence.

===Limitations of some synthesizers===
The MIDI 1.0 specification does not directly support microtonal music, because each note-on and note-off message only represents one chromatic tone. However, microtonal scales can be emulated using pitch bending, such as in LilyPond&#x27;s implementation.

Although some synthesizers allow the creation of customized microtonal scales, this solution does not allow compositions to be transposed. For example, if each B note is raised one quarter tone, then the &quot;raised 7th&quot; would only affect a C major scale.

==Microtonality in rock music==
Early microtonal guitars focused on issues with the 12-tone equal temperament system. In 1829, Thomas Perronet Thompson designed the Enharmonic Guitar that featured small holes where frets could be inserted. Later developments from Luthier René Lacôte and Paul Kochendorfer include an adjustable ebony-mounted frets and levers to simultaneously adjust multiple frets. A form of microtone known as the blue note is an integral part of rock music and one of its predecessors, the blues. The blue notes, located on the third, fifth, and seventh notes of a diatonic major scale, are flattened by a variable microtone. Joe Monzo has made a microtonal analysis of the song &quot;Drunken Hearted Man&quot;, written and recorded by the delta blues musician Robert Johnson.

Musicians such as Jon Catler have incorporated microtonal guitars like 31-tone equal tempered guitar and a 62-tone just intonation guitar in blues and jazz rock music.

English rock band Radiohead has used microtonal string arrangements in their music, such as on &quot;How to Disappear Completely&quot; from the album &quot;Kid A&quot;.

American band Secret Chiefs 3 has been making its own custom &quot;microtonal&quot; instruments since the mid 1990s. The proprietary tuning system they use in their &quot;Ishraqiyun&quot; aspect is ratio-based, not equal temperament. The band&#x27;s leader Trey Spruance, also of Mr. Bungle challenges the terminology of &quot;microtonality&quot; as a development that instead of liberating tonal sensibility to a universe of diverse possibilities, both new and historical, instead mainly serves to reinforce the idea that the universal standard for &quot;tone&quot; is the (western) semitone.

Australian band King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard utilises microtonal instruments, including custom microtonal guitars modified to play in 24-TET tuning. Tracks with these instruments appear on their 2017 albums &quot;Flying Microtonal Banana&quot; and &quot;Gumboot Soup&quot;, their 2020 album &quot;K.G&quot;, and their 2021 album &quot;L.W.&quot;

American band Horse Lords uses just intonation, playing hand-modified guitars with repositioned frets.

American band The Mercury Tree began incorporating microtonality in their 2014 album &quot;Countenance&quot;, using quarter tones on the song &quot;Vestigial&quot;. In their 2016 album &quot;Permutations&quot;, they continued exploring quarter tones, and the track &quot;Ether / Ore&quot; was composed using the Carlos Alpha tuning. Their 2018 collaborative EP with Cryptic Ruse, titled &quot;Cryptic Tree&quot;, utilized both 23-TET and 17-TET. The 2019 album &quot;Spidermilk&quot; and the 2023 album &quot;Self Similar&quot; both feature 17 notes per octave, with the latter also including tracks in 34-TET and 68-TET. 

Ventifacts, a prog-rock and folk songwriting duo between Ben Spees (of The Mercury Tree) and Damon Waitkus (of Jack O&#x27; the Clock) have made music which is exclusively microtonal. The tuning systems they use are free pitch, 24-TET, 17-TET, 22-TET, 10-TET and 20-TET.

American band Dollshot used quarter tones and other microtonal intervals in their album &quot;Lalande&quot;.

American instrumental trio Consider the Source employs microtonal instruments in their music.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}}

Australian alternative musician Jack Tickner uses a just intonation guitar in releases like his 2018 EP &quot;Reassuring Weight&quot;.
