<text>Brighton &amp; Hove Albion Football Club ( ), commonly referred to as simply Brighton, is a professional football club based in Brighton and Hove, East Sussex, England. The club competes in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. The club&#x27;s home ground is the Falmer Stadium.

Founded in 1901 and nicknamed the &quot;Seagulls&quot; or &quot;Albion&quot;, Brighton played their early professional football in the Southern League, when they won their first and still to this date their only major domestic trophy, the FA Charity Shield (later known as FA Community Shield) in 1910 which they won 1–0 over Aston Villa in the final. They were later elected to the Football League in 1920. Between 1979 and 1983, they played in the First Division, and reached the 1983 FA Cup final, losing to Manchester United after a replay. They were relegated from the First Division in the same season.

By the late 1990s, Brighton were in the fourth tier of English football and having financial problems. After narrowly avoiding relegation from the Football League to the Conference in 1997, a boardroom takeover saved the club from liquidation. Successive promotions in 2001 and 2002 brought Brighton back to the second tier, and in 2011, the club moved into the Falmer Stadium after 14 years without a permanent home ground. In the 2016–17 season, Brighton finished second in the EFL Championship and were thus promoted to the Premier League, ending a 34-year absence from the top flight. In the 2022–23 season, Brighton finished sixth in the Premier League, their highest top flight finish ever, and qualified for the UEFA Europa League; their first participation in European club football.

==History==
===Formation and early years (1901–1972)===
Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C. were founded in 1901 and 19 years later, in 1920, they were elected to the Football League&#x27;s new Third Division – having previously been members of the Southern League. In the Southern League they won their only national honour to date, the FA Charity Shield, which at that time was contested by the champions of the Southern League, and the Football League, by defeating Football League Champions Aston Villa in 1910. Following their switch to the regionalised division three south in 1921, they remained in this division until the 1957–1958 season, when they won the title and secured promotion to the Second Division at the same time as the regionalised north and south divisions de-regionalised into a third and fourth division for the 1958–1959 season. Albion retained their second tier status until relegation in 1962, suffering a successive relegation in 1963 and slipping into the fourth division for the first time. They won the fourth division title in 1964–1965 and remained in the third division until 1972 when as runners up they secured promotion back to the second division.

===Mike Bamber years (1972–1987)===
Mike Bamber was the chairman of Brighton from October 1972 until 1983. He famously brought Brian Clough to the club in 1973 and later appointed former England player Alan Mullery as manager. Brighton&#x27;s life as a Football League club had brought little in the way of success and headlines until 1979, when, under Mullery&#x27;s management, they were promoted to the First Division as Second Division runners-up. The 1982/83 season saw a wildly inconsistent start for the club, with victories over Arsenal and Manchester United mixed in with heavy defeats. Manager Mike Bailey eventually lost his job at the start of December 1982. Jimmy Melia took over as manager, but was unable to turn the situation around and Brighton, after four seasons in the top flight, were relegated in 1983, finishing in last place.

Despite their relegation, that season Brighton reached their first (and only to date) FA Cup final and drew 2–2 with Manchester United in the first match. Brighton&#x27;s goals were scored by Gordon Smith and Gary Stevens. The final featured an infamous &quot;miss&quot; by Gordon Smith with virtually the last kick of the game in extra time, prompting the BBC commentator Peter Jones to utter the well-known phrase &quot;...and Smith must score&quot;. However, Smith&#x27;s kick was saved by the Manchester United goalkeeper, Gary Bailey. In the replay, Manchester United won 4–0.

===Relegation, last years, and saved by Knight (1987–1997)===

After four seasons, relegation to Division Three came in 1987, but the Albion were promoted back the next season. In 1991 they lost the play-off final at Wembley to Notts County 3–1, only to be relegated the next season to the newly named Division Two. In 1996 further relegation came to Division Three. The club&#x27;s financial situation was becoming increasingly precarious, and the club&#x27;s directors decided that the Goldstone Ground would have to be sold to pay off some of the club&#x27;s large debts. Manager Jimmy Case was sacked, after a very poor start to the 1996–97 season left Brighton at the bottom of the league by a considerable margin. The club&#x27;s directors appointed Steve Gritt, the former joint manager of Charlton Athletic, as manager—Gritt was relatively unknown. Brighton&#x27;s league performance steadily improved under Gritt, although their improving chances of survival were put under further threat by a two-point deduction by the Football Association, imposed as punishment for a pitch invasion by fans who were protesting against the sale of the Goldstone ground. A lifelong fan named Dick Knight took control of the club in 1997 having led the fan pressure to oust the previous board following their sale of the club&#x27;s Goldstone Ground to property developers.

By the last day of the season, after being 13 points adrift at one stage, they had risen from the bottom of the division table and had to play the team directly below them, Hereford United, to retain their position in the league. If Brighton won or drew, they would be safe. Brighton defender Kerry Mayo scored an own goal in the first half, and it appeared that Brighton&#x27;s 77-year league career was over. But a late goal from Robbie Reinelt ensured that Brighton retained their league status, based on number of goals scored (despite Hereford having a better goal difference as, in the Football League at the time, goals scored took precedence), and Hereford&#x27;s 25-year league run was instead over.

===Withdean era and Bloom takeover (1997–2011)===
The sale of the Goldstone Ground went through in 1997, leading to Brighton having to play some 70 miles away at Gillingham&#x27;s Priestfield stadium for two seasons. Micky Adams was appointed Brighton&#x27;s manager in 1999. For the start of the 1999–2000 season the Seagulls secured a lease to play home games at Withdean Stadium, a converted athletics track in Brighton owned by the local council. 2000–01 was Brighton&#x27;s first successful season for 13 years. They were crowned champions of Division Three and promoted to Division Two. Adams left in October 2001 to work as Dave Bassett&#x27;s assistant at Leicester, being replaced by former Leicester manager Peter Taylor. The transition proved to be a plus point for Brighton, who maintained their good form and ended the season as Division Two champions – winning a second successive promotion. Just five years after almost succumbing to the double threat of losing their Football League status and going out of business completely, Brighton were one division away from the Premier League.

In May 2009, Knight was replaced as chairman at Brighton by Tony Bloom, who successfully secured £93 million funding for the new Falmer Stadium and 75% shareholding at the club.

Brighton&#x27;s final season at Withdean was 2010–11, in which they won League One under the management of Gus Poyet. The following season, Brighton changed their crest to a design similar to the crest used from the 1970s to the 1990s. This was to reflect on the club returning home after not having a stadium since 1997.

===Move to new stadium and promotion under Hughton (2011–2017)===
The Falmer Stadium hosted its first league match on the opening day of the 2011–12 season against Doncaster Rovers, who were the last opposition to play at the Goldstone in 1997. The game finished 2–1 to Brighton. The 2012–13 season saw Brighton finish 4th and lose in the play-off semi-finals to Crystal Palace. Poyet was suspended as manager following controversial comments made in his post-match interview, and was later sacked as manager and replaced by Óscar García.

On the final day of the 2013–14 season, Brighton beat Nottingham Forest 2–1 with a last minute winner from Leonardo Ulloa to secure a 6th-place finish. After losing to Derby County in the play-offs semi-finals, García resigned. Sami Hyypiä was appointed manager for the 2014–15 season but resigned after just four months due to a poor run of results, replaced by Chris Hughton. In the following campaign Brighton challenged for promotion again, buoyed by a 21-game unbeaten run from the opening day to 19 December. On the final day of the season Brighton travelled to Middlesbrough and needed to win to secure promotion to the Premier League, but a 1–1 draw meant 3rd and a play-off place, where defeat to Sheffield Wednesday was Brighton&#x27;s third playoff semi-final defeat in four seasons.

Brighton started 2016–17 with an 18-match unbeaten run, taking them to the top of the league for much of December and January. They remained in the automatic promotion positions for most of the rest of the season, and clinched promotion to the Premier League after a 2–1 win against Wigan Athletic at home on 17 April 2017.

===Back in the top division (2017–present)===
Brighton&#x27;s first season in the Premier League was largely successful, with the club rising into the top half several times in the season. After being one point above the relegation zone in January, victories over Arsenal and Manchester United in the final months of the campaign helped secure a finish of 15th.

The club endured a difficult second season in the top division, narrowly avoiding relegation with a 17th-place finish. In the FA Cup, Brighton reached the semi-finals for the first time since 1983, losing 1–0 to Manchester City. Hughton was sacked following the end of the season due to the poor run of results.

Following Hughton&#x27;s sacking, Swansea City manager Graham Potter was appointed as the new head coach on a four-year contract. Potter extended his contract by two more years in November 2019. From March to June 2020, the season was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Brighton finished 15th and 16th in Potter&#x27;s first two seasons, securing a historic fifth season in the Premier League in May 2021 that ensured their current spell in the top flight exceeded their previous run from 1979 to 1983.

The club&#x27;s 2021–22 season saw a ninth-place finish in the Premier League, the highest Brighton had ever finished in English top flight football, with a record tally of 51 points. In September 2022, Potter left the club to become head coach of Chelsea, following the dismissal of Thomas Tuchel.

On 18 September 2022, Brighton announced Roberto De Zerbi as the club&#x27;s new head coach. The league season was paused for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, in which Brighton midfielder Alexis Mac Allister started and assisted in the final for winning side Argentina. Brighton reached their second FA Cup semi-final in four seasons, losing on penalties to Manchester United following a 0–0 draw. On 21 May 2023, Brighton qualified for European football for the first time in their history with a 3–1 victory over Southampton. Three days later, after a 1–1 draw with Manchester City, Brighton secured qualification for the group stage of the 2023–24 UEFA Europa League. Brighton finished the season with a record tally of 62 points and a new record of sixth-place.

On 14 December 2023, Brighton topped their UEFA Europa League group subsequently qualifying them for the round of 16 by defeating Marseille 1–0. Brighton would be eliminated in the round of 16 by Roma in a 4–1 aggregate loss on 14 March 2024. On 18 May, Brighton and De Zerbi mutually agreed to end his contract at the end of the 2023–24 season as Brighton fell to 11th on the final day of the season with 48 points, leapfrogged by their arch rivals Crystal Palace on goal difference after being ahead all season.

Fabian Hürzeler was appointed as head coach of Brighton &amp; Hove Albion in June 2024, making him the youngest permanent manager in Premier League history at 31 years old. Hürzeler replaced Roberto De Zerbi following a successful tenure as manager of FC St. Pauli, where he led the team to promotion back to the top tier of German football after a 13-year absence. His first official match in charge of Brighton was on August 17, 2024, against Everton. Brighton won the match 3-0.

==Stadium==

===Goldstone Ground===

For 95 years Brighton and Hove Albion were based at the Goldstone Ground in Hove, until the board of directors decided to sell the stadium. The sale, implemented by majority shareholder Bill Archer and his chief executive David Bellotti, proved controversial, and the move provoked widespread protests against the board. The club received little if any money from this sale.

In their last season at the Goldstone, 1996–97, the Seagulls were in danger of relegation from the Football League. They won their final game at the Goldstone against Doncaster Rovers, setting up a winner-takes-all relegation game at Hereford United, who were level on points with the Seagulls. Brighton drew 1–1, and Hereford were relegated to the Football Conference on goals scored.

===Withdean Stadium===

For two years, from 1997 to 1999, the club shared Priestfield Stadium, the ground of Gillingham, before returning to Brighton to play at Withdean Stadium. This is not predominantly a football ground, having been used for athletics throughout most of its history, and previously as a zoo.

Because of the cost of the public enquiry into planning permission for a new stadium, rent on Withdean Stadium, fees paid to use Gillingham&#x27;s Priestfield Stadium, and a general running deficit due to the low ticket sales inherent with a small ground, the club had an accumulated deficit of £9.5 million in 2004. The board of directors paid £7 million of this; the other £2.5 million had to be raised from the operations of the club. In an effort to achieve this, a fund-raising appeal known as the &quot;Alive and Kicking Fund&quot; was started, with everything from nude Christmas Cards featuring the players to a CD single being released to raise cash. On 9 January 2005 this fund-raising single &#x27;Tom Hark&#x27; went straight in at number 17 in the UK chart, gaining it national airplay on BBC Radio 1.

===Falmer Stadium===
The club&#x27;s home ground is Falmer Stadium, currently known for sponsorship reasons as the American Express Stadium or simply, the Amex, located in Village Way, Brighton.

On 28 October 2005, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister announced that the application for Falmer had been successful. Lewes District Council contested John Prescott&#x27;s decision to approve planning permission for Falmer, forcing a judicial review. This was based on a minor error in Prescott&#x27;s original approval which neglected to state that some car parking for the stadium is in the Lewes district as opposed to the Brighton &amp; Hove unitary authority. This caused further delay. Once the judicial review ruled in favour of the stadium, Lewes District Council said that it would not launch any further appeals.

Building of Falmer Stadium started in December 2008. On 31 May 2011 the club officially completed the handover and was given the keys to the stadium with an initial capacity of 22,374 seats, signifying the end of 14 years without a designated home. During January 2012, the club submitted an application to Brighton and Hove City council to increase the stadium capacity by a further 8,000 seats as well as to add additional corporate boxes, new television facilities and a luxury suite. This was granted unanimously by Brighton &amp; Hove City Council&#x27;s planning committee on 25 April 2012. The stadium was then expanded to 27,250 for the start of the 2012–13 season and then further to 27,750 during December 2012 before reaching 30,750 during May 2013.

In 2020, the club submitted plans to expand the stadium from 30,750 seats to 32,500 including additional hospitality. In 2021, the stadium was expanded to 31,800 with additional works yet to be done.

==Colours and kits==
For most of Brighton&#x27;s history they have played in blue and white shirts, usually striped, with different combinations of white and blue shorts and socks, though this changed to all white briefly in the 1970s and again to plain royal blue in the early 1980s.

===Kit manufacturers and sponsors===
Since 2014, the club&#x27;s kit has been manufactured by Nike. Previous manufacturers include Bukta (1971–74, 1977–80), Admiral (1974–75, 1994–97), Umbro (1975–77), Adidas (1980–87), Spall (1987–89), Sports Express (1989–91), Ribero (1991–94), Superleague (1997–99), and Erreà (1999–2014).
Their current shirt sponsors are American Express. Previous sponsors have included British Caledonian Airways (1980–83), Phoenix Brewery (1983–86), NOBO (1986–91), TSB Bank (1991–93), Sandtex (1993–98), Donatello (1998–99), Skint Records (1999–2008), IT First (2008–11), and BrightonandHoveJobs.com (2011–13). Their current sleeve sponsors are Experience Kissimmee. Previous sleeve sponsors include JD Sports, and Snickers UK.

==Rivalries==
Even though the two clubs are almost apart, Crystal Palace are Brighton&#x27;s main rival, dating back to the 1970s and hostility between managers Alan Mullery and Terry Venables, who took charge of Brighton and Palace respectively in 1976 ahead of a close season in the Third Division which saw the two teams vying with Mansfield Town. The season finished with both Palace and Brighton beaten to the title by Mansfield; however both sides were promoted and the hostility between the two managers had forged an intense rivalry between both teams. This continued into the following season in the Second Division as Brighton, who had finished their season at the top, fell into second after Palace won a previously postponed game against Burnley the following weekend to beat Brighton to the title by one point. In addition, the A23 road runs directly between Brighton and Croydon, where Palace&#x27;s Selhurst Park stadium is based. This has led to the media labelling the rivalry as both the A23 and M23 derby, although fans of both clubs do not use this term.

Situated in East Sussex, Brighton find themselves isolated from most other teams, leaving them without an established local derby. Matches against fellow south coast outfits Southampton and Portsmouth are occasionally labelled as local derbies by the media, but most fans of either team do not consider the other to be their rivals due to the over distance between the clubs, and the already well-established rivalry between Southampton and Portsmouth.

<text>The Pacific Coast League (PCL) is a Minor League Baseball league that operates in the Western United States. Along with the International League, it is one of two leagues playing at the Triple-A level, which is one grade below Major League Baseball (MLB). 

The PCL was one of the premier regional baseball leagues in the first half of the 20th century. Although it was never recognized as a true major league, to which it aspired, its quality of play was considered very high. A number of top stars of the era, including Joe DiMaggio and Ted Williams, were products of the league. In 1958, with the arrival of major league teams on the west coast and the availability of televised major league games, the PCL&#x27;s modern era began with each team signing Player Development Contracts to become farm teams of major league clubs. Following MLB&#x27;s reorganization of the minor leagues in 2021, it operated as the Triple-A West for one season before switching back to its previous moniker in 2022.

A league champion is determined at the end of each season. The San Francisco Seals won 14 Pacific Coast League titles, the most in the league&#x27;s history, followed by the Los Angeles Angels (12) and the Albuquerque Dukes and Portland Beavers (8).

==History==

===Formation and early history===
The Pacific Coast League was formed on December 29, 1902, when officials from the California State League (1899–1902) met in San Francisco for the purpose of expanding the league beyond California. Six franchises were granted. These were the Los Angeles Angels, Oakland Oaks, Portland Beavers, Sacramento Senators, San Francisco Seals, and Seattle Indians. A dispute over territories owned by the Pacific Northwest League, in which the PCL had placed franchises, and the PCL&#x27;s allowing blacklisted players to compete led to the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues (NAPBL) labeling the PCL as an outlaw league.

The mild climate of the West Coast, especially California, allowed the league to play longer seasons, sometimes starting in late February and ending as late as the beginning of December. During the 1905 season the San Francisco Seals set the all-time PCL record by playing 230 games. Teams regularly played between 170 and 200 games in a season until the late 1950s. This allowed players, who were often career minor leaguers, to hone their skills, earn an extra month or two of pay, and reduce the need to find off-season work. These longer seasons gave owners the opportunity to generate more revenue. Another outcome was that a number of the all-time minor league records for season statistical totals are held by players from the PCL.

The inaugural 1903 season, which consisted of over 200 scheduled games for each team, began on March 26. The Los Angeles Angels finished the season in first place with a 133–78 (.630) record, making them the first league champions.

In 1904, NAPBL president Patrick T. Powers brokered terms with the PCL, clearing it of its outlaw status and designating it as a Class A league. In 1909, the league classification was raised to Double-A. In 1919, with the earlier addition of the Salt Lake City Bees and Vernon Tigers, league membership reached eight teams for the first time. While the league had experienced little commercial success up to this point, the 1920s were a turning point which saw increased attendance and teams fielding star players.

The Great Depression of the 1930s resulted in a lower quality of play due to the league&#x27;s salary reduction. Still, a number of top stars, including Joe DiMaggio, Ted Williams, Bobby Doerr, and Ox Eckhardt, competed on PCL teams that decade. Also helping attendance was the introduction of night games. At Sacramento&#x27;s Moreing Field, the Sacramento Solons and the Oakland Oaks played the first night baseball game, five years before any major league night game, on June 10, 1930. The Hollywood Stars and San Diego Padres were added to the league in the 1930s as well.

===A near-major league===
During the first half of the 20th century, the Pacific Coast League developed into one of the premier regional baseball leagues. The cities enfranchised by the other two high-minor leagues, the International League and the American Association, were generally coordinated geographically with the major leagues, but such was not the case with the PCL. With no major league baseball team existing west of St. Louis, the PCL was unrivaled for American west coast baseball. Although it was never recognized as a true major league, its quality of play was considered very high. Drawing from a strong pool of talent in the area, the PCL produced many outstanding players, including such future major-league Hall of Famers as Joe DiMaggio, Ted Williams, Tony Lazzeri, Paul Waner, Earl Averill, Bobby Doerr, Joe Gordon, and Ernie Lombardi. Amid success experienced after World War II, league President Pants Rowland began to envision the PCL as a third major league. During 1945 the league voted to become a major league. However, the American League and National League were uninterested in allowing it to join their ranks.

While many PCL players went on to play in the major leagues, teams in the league were often successful enough that they could offer competitive salaries to avoid being outbid for their players&#x27; services. Some players made a career out of the minor leagues. One of the better known was Frank Shellenback, whose major league pitching career was brief, but who compiled a record PCL total of 295 wins against 178 losses. (It should be mentioned, however, that Shellenback&#x27;s long career in the PCL was largely due to his use of the spitball, banned in the major leagues in 1920, not the competitive salaries offered by PCL clubs.) Many former major league players came to the PCL to finish their careers after their time in the majors had ended.

In 1952, the PCL became the only minor league in history to be given the &quot;Open&quot; classification, a grade above the Triple-A level. This limited the rights of major league clubs to draft players from the PCL, and was considered an act toward the circuit becoming a third major league.

===Sudden decline===
The shift to the Open classification came just as minor league teams from coast to coast suffered a sharp drop in attendance, primarily due to the availability of major league games on television. The hammer blow to the PCL&#x27;s major league dreams came in 1958 with the arrival of the first MLB teams on the west coast (the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Francisco Giants). As a result, three of the PCL&#x27;s flagship teams (the Los Angeles Angels, Hollywood Stars, and San Francisco Seals) were immediately forced to relocate to smaller markets. The Oakland Oaks had moved to Canada two years before the Giants arrived. The San Diego Padres and Seattle Rainiers suffered the same fate when they were displaced by major league teams, the new Padres and the Pilots, respectively, in 1969. Additionally, the PCL lost customers to the major league teams which then occupied the same territory. The league never recovered from these blows. The Pacific Coast League reverted to Triple-A classification in 1958, where it remained, and soon diminished in the public eye to nothing more than another minor league.

===Moving beyond the coast===
The PCL began to spread out across the nation, and internationally, in the 1950s. Previously, Salt Lake City had been the easternmost city in the league. In 1956, the Oakland Oaks relocated to Canada where they became the Vancouver Mounties, the circuit&#x27;s first international team. Two years later, the Los Angeles Angels moved to become the Spokane Indians and the San Francisco Seals became the Phoenix Giants.

The league continued to expand throughout the country in the 1960s. Clubs representing new cities during the decade included the Dallas Rangers, Denver Bears, Eugene Emeralds, Hawaii Islanders, Indianapolis Indians, Oklahoma City 89ers, Tacoma/Phoenix Giants, and Tucson Toros. From 1964 to 1968 the PCL swelled to twelve teams. The Albuquerque Dukes and Vancouver Canadians were a few of several teams to begin play in the 1970s. Several new teams arrived in the 1980s, such as the Calgary Cannons, Colorado Springs Sky Sox, Edmonton Trappers, and Las Vegas Stars, but the league began to stabilize as franchise relocations became less frequent.

===Further expansion===
In 1998, the Pacific Coast League took on five teams from the disbanding American Association, which had operated in the Midwest, and a sixth franchise was added to the league as an expansion team, thus providing the scheduling convenience of an even number of teams. The addition of the Iowa Cubs, Nashville Sounds, Oklahoma RedHawks, Omaha Royals, New Orleans Zephyrs, and the expansion Memphis Redbirds grew the league to an all-time-high 16 clubs. Despite its name, the league now extended well beyond the Pacific coast, stretching from Western Washington to Middle Tennessee; half of its teams were located east of the Rocky Mountains.

The league&#x27;s presence in Canada diminished and ended in the early 2000s, as the Vancouver Canadians moved to Sacramento to become the RiverCats in 2000 (however, a short-season A club replaced that one there), the Calgary Cannons moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico, to become the Albuquerque Isotopes in 2003, and the Edmonton Trappers, the circuit&#x27;s final Canadian team moved to Round Rock in 2005. Of the cities represented in the PCL in its heyday, only Salt Lake City and Sacramento remain, and even these were represented by franchises different from those that originally called these cities home. In 2005, the Pacific Coast League became the first minor league ever to achieve a season attendance of over 7 million. In 2007, league attendance reached an all-time high of 7,420,095.

In 2019, the team previously known as the Colorado Springs Sky Sox relocated to San Antonio, Texas and continued play in the PCL as the San Antonio Missions, assuming the identity of a team which had previously competed in the Double-A Texas League. This move was accompanied by realignment in the American Conference. Nashville and Memphis moved to the Northern Division, and Oklahoma City and San Antonio moved to the Southern Division. In a further move, the New Orleans Baby Cakes relocated to Wichita, Kansas where they became known as the Double-A Wichita Wind Surge.

===Takeover by Major League Baseball===
The start of the 2020 season was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic before ultimately being cancelled on June 30. As part of Major League Baseball&#x27;s 2021 reorganization of the minor leagues, the Pacific Coast League was reduced to 10 teams and temporarily renamed the &quot;Triple-A West&quot; for the 2021 season. Following MLB&#x27;s acquisition of the rights to the names of the historical minor leagues, the Triple-A West was renamed the Pacific Coast League effective with the 2022 season.

==Structure and season==
The league is divided into two divisions, East and West, of five teams each. As of the 2022 season, all teams play a 150-game schedule, beginning in late March and concluding in late September.

=== Players ===
The Pacific Coast League uses a salary cap. As of the 2025 season, clubs are required to spend a maximum of US$1,610,000 on player compensation, with a minimum salary of $35,800 per player. For players aged 23 and younger on standard contracts, only 50% of their salary counts towards the cap (up to $250,000 total). There is also a separate salary cap for coaches and technical staff.

Rosters are limited to a size of 28 players on Opening Day weekend, although up to 9 players can be signed on the roster before the transactions date limit.

===Championship and interleague play===
Beginning with the 2023 season, the regular season is split into two halves. After the completion of the season, the winners of each half meet in a best-of-three series to determine a league champion. The PCL champion then meets the International League&#x27;s champion in the Triple-A National Championship Game, a single game to determine an overall champion of Triple-A baseball, which has been held annually since 2006, excluding 2020 and 2021. Previously, the PCL champion also competed in the Triple-A World Series (1983, 1998–2000), Junior World Series (1919), and other sporadic postseason competitions throughout the league&#x27;s history.

Other interleague play occurred during the Triple-A All-Star Game. Traditionally, the game took place on the day after the mid-summer Major League Baseball All-Star Game. The game was meant to mark a symbolic halfway-point in the season (though not the mathematical halfway-point which, for most seasons, is usually one month prior). During the All-Star break, no regular-season games were scheduled for two days before the All-Star Game itself.

==Teams==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;


==Rules==
The Pacific Coast League plays by the same rules listed in the &quot;Official Baseball Rules&quot; published by Major League Baseball. One exception was the use of the designated hitter (DH). Whereas the application of the DH rule in Major League Baseball is determined by the identity of the home team, with the rules of the home team&#x27;s league applying to both teams, PCL pitchers hit when both clubs were National League affiliates and they agreed to have their pitchers hit. Two National League affiliated clubs may agree to use the DH instead. The reason for this is that as players move up and get closer to reaching the majors, teams prefer to have the rules follow (as closely as possible) those of the major leagues. The DH is always used when one or both teams are American League affiliates. Since MLB&#x27;s adoption of the universal DH in 2022, this no longer is an issue.

Other differences lay in the use of professional baseball&#x27;s pace-of-play initiatives which began to be implemented in 2015. A 15-second pitch clock is used when no runners were on base; 20 seconds are allowed with runners present. Teams are limited to five mound visits during a nine-inning game. Pitchers are required to face a minimum of three consecutive batters until the side is retired or the pitcher is injured and unable to continue playing.

==Past champions==
League champions have been determined by different means since the Pacific Coast League&#x27;s formation in 1903. With few exceptions, most PCL champions through 1927 were simply the regular season pennant winners. However, a few seasons during this time did feature a postseason championship series to crown a champion. It was not until the mid-1930s that the league instituted regular postseason play that was only sporadically cancelled due to financial problems or other factors. Beginning with 2023, the regular-season is split into two halves, and the winners of each half meet in a best-of-three series for the league championship.

The San Francisco Seals won 14 PCL championships, the most among all teams in the league, followed by the Los Angeles Angels (12) and the Albuquerque Dukes and Portland Beavers (8).

==Awards==

The PCL recognizes outstanding players and team personnel annually near the end of each season.

===MVP Award===

The Most Valuable Player Award, first awarded in 1927, is given to honor the best player in the league. The award is voted on by team managers, general managers, broadcasters, and media representatives from around the league, as are all PCL year-end awards.

===Pitcher of the Year Award===

The Pitcher of the Year Award, awarded sporadically from 1957 to 1974 and continuously since 2001, serves to recognize the league&#x27;s best pitcher. Pitchers were also eligible to win the MVP Award from 1927 to 2000.

===Top MLB Prospect Award===

The Top MLB Prospect Award, created in 1952 as the Rookie of the Year Award and issued from 1952 to 1972 and since 1998, is given to the best player with no prior PCL experience.

===Manager of the Year Award===

The Manager of the Year Award, started in 1967, is given to the league&#x27;s top manager.

===Executive of the Year Award===
The Executive of the Year Award, first awarded in 1974, honored team executives who have achieved success in the area of attendance figures, promotions, and community involvement.

==Hall of Fame==

The Pacific Coast League Hall of Fame was established in 1942 to honor league players, managers, and executives who have made significant contributions to the league&#x27;s ideals. The Hall of Fame inducted its first class of 12 men in 1943. The Hall became dormant after 1957, but was revived in 2003, the PCL&#x27;s centennial season. Today, the Hall of Fame Committee seeks to recognize worthy players throughout the league&#x27;s history who have made contributions to the league. New members are elected before the start of each season.

<text>Terrassa () is a city in central-eastern Catalonia and in the province of Barcelona (Spain). It is one of the two capitals of Vallès Occidental county, being the larger in both area and population.

The name &quot;Terrassa&quot; derives from Latin &quot;Terracia&quot;, either from earlier &quot;Terracium castellum&quot; (“earthen castle”), or meaning &quot;terrace&quot;, &quot;area of flat land&quot;. Historically, the name of the city has been spelled &quot;Terraça, Terraza, Terraca&quot; and &quot;Tarrassa&quot; in the native Catalan language whilst it&#x27;s been traditionally spelled &quot;Tarrasa&quot; in Spanish. The Spanish spelling is now largely out of use given its ties with the Francoist Regime and the sole official spelling being the Catalan &quot;Terrassa&quot; since 1978.

Terrassa is known for its industrial past and present, its lively cultural scene, its industrial modernist architecture, its status as a &quot;City of Film&quot; and as the seat of several universities such as UPC, ESCAC, Institut del Teatre and EUIT. It was also awarded in 2024 the Council of Europe&#x27;s &quot;The Europe Prize&quot; for cities with an outstanding commitment to European values.

It is the site of Roman , a former Visigothic bishopric, which became a Latin Catholic titular see. Since 2004, it is again the see of a bishopric.

The city is located in the Catalan Prelitoral depression (Depressió Prelitoral), at the feet of the Prelitoral mountain range () and the average altitude of the city is 277 meters above sea level. It is 20 and 18 kilometres from Barcelona and Montserrat respectively. Terrassa&#x27;s location as the most-inland city in the Barcelona Metropolitan Region makes it sometimes be referred to as the &quot;entrance to Central Catalonia&quot;.

As of 2024, Terrassa is the third largest city in Catalonia, after Barcelona and l&#x27;Hospitalet de Llobregat. Terrassa is also the largest municipality in what&#x27;s considered the second most important urban, economic and cultural center of Catalonia, the Vallès region.

== History ==
The remains that have been found indicate that the area where Terrassa stands has been inhabited since prehistory. In 2005, during the construction of a tunnel for one of the city&#x27;s railway lines, a prehistoric site was found in Vallparadís Park, with stone tools and fossils of hunted animals dating back 800,000 to 1,000,000 years, making this one of the oldest prehistoric sites in Europe.

Terrassa originated as the Roman town of &quot;Egara&quot; (&quot;Municipium Flavium Egara&quot;), which was founded during the time of the emperor Vespasian (69–79 CE), alongside the torrent of Vallparadís (nowadays an urban park) close to the Iberian town of &quot;Egosa&quot;, on the site of which some ceramics and coins have been found.

In the 17th century it was the sight of the Terrasa witchtrials, where 6 women were arrested, tortured and convicted of witchcraft. Five of them were hanged on 27 October 1619 near a present-day railway bridge.

Other important remains from the Middle Ages are the former cathedral, the castle of Vallparadís (from 1344 to 1413 a Carthusian monastery and today a municipal museum) and the tower of the castle-palace of the count-king.

In the 19th century the city played an important role in the industrial revolution, specializing in woollen fabrics, and today there is a major &quot;Modernista&quot; legacy as a result of the city&#x27;s importance at that time. Particularly notable &quot;Modernista&quot; buildings include the Masia Freixa (1907), the Vapor Aymerich, Amat i Jover textile mill (1907) (now the Museum of Science and Industry of Catalonia), the Principal theater (1920), the city hall (1902), the Alegre de Sagrera house/museum (1911), the Industrial School (1904), the Gran Casino (1920), the Parc de Desinfecció (1920), and the Independència market (1908).

Terrassa is a partner city of the Art nouveau network, a European network of co-operation created in 1999 for the study, preservation and development of Art Nouveau.

Terrassa is a famous movie production center in Europe and was named a City of Film by UNESCO. The city is home to the largest film studios in Catalonia and the Iberian Peninsula, the Parc Audiovisual de Catalunya, where numerous movies and TV Shows such as REC, A Monster Calls and Operación Triunfo have been filmed.

=== Catastrophes ===

On 25 September 1962, after a long dry summer, between 212 and 252 litres of rain per square metre fell in three hours. It caused the rivers Llobregat and Besòs and their tributaries to overflow, creating a water avenue that caused 700 victims and heavy material losses.

The Vallès Occidental &quot;comarca&quot; was the most damaged. In particularly Terrassa, with 327 victims. The reason of these numbers was that building was permitted around two dry streams used to bring rain water to the Llobregat river. They met in a wedge shape and were not properly channelized. When the streams overflowed it created what was called &quot;the dead triangle&quot;, with more than a hundred victims in the Ègara neighbourhood alone.

== Ecclesiastical history ==

The episcopal see of Ègara already existed by about 450 CE, when it was established on territory split off from the Roman Catholic Diocese of Barcelona, under the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Tarragona. Pope Hilarius confirmed its autonomy by denying a request around 469 to unite it with the Barcelona under its own first bishop, Ireneus.

It comprised parts of these Comarques of Catalonia (Catalan districts) : Alt Penedès, Anoia, Baix Llobregat, Vallès Occidental and Vallès Oriental. A Provincial Council of Tarragona was held there in 615.

It effectively succumbed to the Arab (Muslim) conquest in the 8th century and was probably suppressed, its territory being (rather nominally) returned to the Diocese of Barcelona. The Marian cathedral continued to exist until 718, when it was taken over during the Umayyad conquest of Hispania, but was rebuilt in the 12th century, and remains part of a monumental complex of ancient Visigothic-Romanesque churches of Sant Pere de Terrassa and Sant Miquel on the site.

After the Catholic Reconquista of the region in the tenth century, the see was not restored, its territory being incorporated in the (mother) diocese of Barcelona. Why a request to restore the bishopric by its Metropolitan of Tarragona, Cesareo, wasn&#x27;t honored by Pope John XII (955–964) is unclear.

In 2004, Pope John Paul II created the new Diocese of Terrassa on territory taken from the Archdiocese of Barcelona. Its seat is the Cathedral of Holy Sprit.

These three churches were built close to the site of old Ègara to be the seat of the Ègara Diocese, which was founded around 450 CE and remained in existence until the 8th century. This episcopal complex follows the Byzantine model of antiquity, with two churches (Sant Pere and Santa Maria) and a mausoleum (Sant Miquel). After a long period of construction, the churches were finished in the then-current manner about the 11th and 12th centuries and in Romanesque style, on the site of the pre-Romanesque buildings of the Visigothic period.
The church of Santa Maria contains outstanding works of art, and there are murals dating from the Romanesque period to the Gothic. There is also an altar stone dating from the 10th century and medieval and Romanesque tombstones (one of which documents the name of the Roman town of Egara). In the transept there are three Gothic altarpieces.

The railway reached Terrassa in 1856, and nowadays two lines serve the city. The first, operated by Renfe, connects with Barcelona and Lleida, and the second, operated by FGC, with Barcelona. Recently FGC extended its line to the north of the city, building three new stations; one of them acts as a rail hub with the Renfe line. This extension is known as the Terrassa Metro.

Several interurban bus lines connect Terrassa with the closest cities and towns such as Sabadell, Castellar del Vallès, Martorell, Rubí, Sant Cugat del Vallès and Vacarisses.

Transport inside the city is provided by 14 bus lines operated by a municipal company (Transports Municipals d&#x27;Ègara). In the future, when the three new FGC stations and the two planned for the Renfe line are in use, the railway will also serve as urban transport.

== Culture ==

=== Music and theater ===

A lot of musicians and actors are based in Terrassa because of the large number of music schools, a long amateur theater tradition and the local seat of the Institut del Teatre. Since 1982, the Terrassa Jazz Festival has been especially outstanding, with guests like Stan Getz, Chet Baker, Dexter Gordon, Tete Montoliu, Dizzy Gillespie. Local bands and musicians such as Doctor Prats, Lildami or Miki Núñez have also developed a national and international following.

=== Traditional Catalan Culture ===
The city is also home to a lively catalan culture scene. Compared to other cities its size, like Sabadell or l&#x27;Hospitalet de Llobregat it houses a significant number of &quot;colles&quot; (groups) of different catalan cultural traditions. Most notably the Minyons de Terrassa, one of the three &quot;colles castelleres&quot; (human tower groups) of the city, is considered among the best in the world and were the first to complete a 10-story human tower in 1998. Alongside the Minyons, the city also houses two other &quot;colles castelleres&quot;: the Castellers de Terrassa and the University&#x27;s &quot;colla&quot;, the Bergants del Campus Terrassa. 

The city is also home to a multitude of &quot;diables&quot; and &quot;bestiari de foc&quot; (fire-centric groups) such as the Diables de Terrassa, Pàjara de Terrassa, Drac de Terrassa, Drac Baluk Asharot i Diables de Ca n&#x27;Aurell, Bitxo del Torrent Mitger, among many others. The &quot;bestiari&quot; (traditional catalan processional figures representing animals) extends also to non-fire figures such as the water-spewing Hipodragona, Cuca Japonesa or the Papallona de Sant Pere or the purely processional figures like the Àliga de Terrassa or the Mulassa de Terrassa. 

In the realm of Gegants, the city has a very prominent &quot;colla&quot; which manages over 3 pairs of processional giants, as well as a &quot;colla gegantera&quot; (processional giant group) from the Les Fonts district and the Gegants Bojos de Terrassa group.

Several Sardana-dancing groups as well as Esbart dancers, two Bastoners groups, Ball de Gitanes dancers and Trabucaires also call the city home.

=== Mass media ===
Terrasa has a local newspaper, the &quot;&quot;, that is published daily from Tuesday to Saturday, as well as several radio stations: Ràdio Terrassa/Cadena SER Vallès on 828 AM and 89.4 FM, with more than 75 years of history behind it, being one of the pioneering radio stations in Catalonia and Spain; the municipal radio (Noucincpuntdos, 95.2 FM); and Radio Star de Terrassa, the city&#x27;s cultural station, on 100.5 FM, which was founded in 1984 and is one of the historic local radios of Catalonia.

In addition, there is the free newspaper &quot;Terrassa Societat&quot;, published monthly with a circulation of 50,000, and &quot;Terrassa Month&quot;, published of Monday through Friday and also covering local events. Since 2005 the municipal digital newspaper e-newsterrassa.com, in Catalan, has been on line &quot;(as for 2013, this digital newspaper has been taken down)&quot;. The municipal Web site www.terrassa.cat receives no fewer than 150,000 monthly visitors.

== Sports ==
Terrassa was a pioneer in the introduction of field hockey and korfball in Catalonia and played an important role in the introduction of basketball. The most important sport in the city is field hockey. During the Barcelona Olympic Games in 1992, Terrassa was the city where the field hockey competition was played. The great number of hockey players from Terrassa who have participated in the Olympic Games over the years has led to Terrassa&#x27;s being referred to as the &quot;most Olympic city in the world&quot;. Between 1928 and 2004, Terrassa sent 124 athletes to the Olympic Games, the majority of whom were hockey players. Three local field hockey clubs, Atlètic Terrassa, Club Egara and Club Deportiu Terrassa have all won the División de Honor de Hockey Hierba and the Copa del Rey de Hockey Hierba. Atlètic Terrassa and Club Egara have also won the EuroHockey Club Champions Cup.

<text>Vice admiral is a senior naval flag officer rank, usually equivalent to lieutenant general and air marshal. A vice admiral is typically senior to a rear admiral and junior to an admiral.

==Australia==

In the Royal Australian Navy, the rank of vice admiral is held by the Chief of Navy and, when the positions are held by navy officers, by the Vice Chief of the Defence Force, the Chief of Joint Operations, and/or the Chief of Capability Development Group.

Vice admiral is the equivalent of air marshal in the Royal Australian Air Force and lieutenant general in the Australian Army.

==Canada==
In the Royal Canadian Navy, the rank of vice-admiral (VAdm) (&quot;vice-amiral&quot; or &quot;Vam&quot; in French) is equivalent to lieutenant-general of the Canadian Army and Royal Canadian Air Force. A vice-admiral is a flag officer, the naval equivalent of a general officer. A vice-admiral is senior to a rear-admiral and major general, and junior to an admiral and general.

The rank insignia of a Canadian vice-admiral is as follows: 
* On the navy blue mess dress jacket and the navy blue service dress tunic: the cuff insignia is one wide gold braid below two standard size gold braids, the superior one includes the executive curl.
* On tropical white mess dress and tropical white service dress tunic: three silver maple leaves, beneath silver crossed sword and baton, all surmounted by a St. Edward&#x27;s Crown located on gold shoulder boards.

Two rows of gold oak leaves are located on the black visor of the white service cap. From 1968 to June 2010, the navy blue service dress tunic featured only a wide gold braid around the cuff with three gold maple leaves, beneath crossed sword and baton, all surmounted by a St. Edward&#x27;s Crown located on cloth shoulder straps.

Vice-admirals are addressed by rank and name; thereafter by subordinates as &quot;Sir&quot; or &quot;Ma&#x27;am&quot;. Vice-admirals are normally entitled to a staff car; the car will normally bear a flag, dark blue with three gold maple leaves arranged one over two.

A vice-admiral generally holds only the most senior command or administrative appointments, barring only Chief of Defence Staff, which is held by a full admiral or general. Appointments held by vice-admirals may include:
* Vice Chief of the Defence Staff (VCDS);
* Deputy Chief of Defence Staff (DCDS);
* Commander of an operational command (such as Canadian Joint Operations Command);
* Commander of the Royal Canadian Navy;
* Assistant Deputy Minister (ADM) of Defence in various capacities;
* Commander of, or representative to, a multinational force, alliance, or treaty organization.

Charles III holds the honorary rank of vice admiral in the Royal Canadian Navy.

== France ==

In France, &quot;vice-amiral&quot; is the most senior of the ranks in the French Navy; higher ranks, &quot;vice-amiral d&#x27;escadre&quot; and &quot;amiral&quot;, are permanent functions, styles and positions (in French &quot;rangs et appellations&quot;) given to a &quot;vice-amiral&quot;-ranking officer. The &quot;vice-amiral&quot; rank used to be an OF-8 rank in NATO charts, but nowadays, it is more an OF-7 rank.

The rank of &quot;vice-amiral d&#x27;escadre&quot; (literally, &quot;squadron vice-admiral&quot;, with more precision, &quot;fleet vice-admiral&quot;) equals a NATO OF-8 rank.

In the &quot;ancien régime&quot; Navy, between 1669 and 1791. The office of &quot;Vice-Admiral of France&quot; (&quot;Vice-amiral de France&quot;) was the highest rank, the supreme office of &quot;Admiral of France&quot; being purely ceremonial.

Distinct offices were :
* 1669–1791 Vice-admiral of the West (Atlantic Ocean).
* 1669–1791 Vice-admiral of the East (Mediterranean Sea).
* 1778–1791 Vice-admiral of the Asian and American Seas (American shores).
* 1784–1788 Vice-admiral of the Indian Seas (Indian Ocean).

=== Vice-amiral commandant === 
Vice-amiral commandant (literally, &quot;commander of the vice admiral) was unofficial rank inthe World War Ⅰ. At the time France had the two-rank system of flag officers; as a temporary measure, to bring its system into alignment with the rank system of flag officers of other countries, it is distingunished by wearing a 3mm silver line on the 3-star cap. Such vice admirals enjoyed the status and treatment of full admirals.

==Philippines==
In the Philippines, the rank vice admiral is the highest-ranking official of the Philippine Navy. He is recognized as the flag officer in-command of the navy, an equivalent post to the Chief of Naval Operations in the U.S. Navy.

==Poland==
Before World War II, the vice admiral was the highest rank in the Polish Navy. Józef Unrug was one of the only two officers to achieve the rank. The other was Jerzy Świrski. Poland had only one sovereign sea port, Port of Gdynia, and was slowly building a small modern navy that was to be ready by 1950. The navy was not a priority for obvious reasons. At present, it is a &quot;two-star&quot; rank. The stars are not used; however, the stars were used in between 1952 and 1956 and are still used in the vice admiral&#x27;s pennant.

==United Kingdom==
In the Royal Navy the rank of vice-admiral should be distinguished from the office of &quot;Vice-Admiral of the United Kingdom&quot;, which is an Admiralty position usually held by a retired &quot;full&quot; admiral, and that of &quot;Vice-Admiral of the Coast&quot;, a now obsolete office dealing with naval administration in each of the maritime counties.

==National ranks==
* Vizeadmiral
* Vice admiral (India)
* Vice admiral (Sri Lanka)
* Vice admiral (Sweden)
* Vice admiral (United States)

==NATO code==
While the rank of vice admiral is used in most of NATO countries, it is ranked differently depending on the country.

<doc id="69476" wikidata="Q156945" url="?curid=69476" title="Rear admiral">
<text>Rear admiral is a flag officer rank used by English-speaking navies. In most European navies, the equivalent rank is called counter admiral.

Rear admiral is usually immediately senior to commodore and immediately below vice admiral. It is usually equivalent to the rank of major general in armies. In the U.S. Navy and some other navies, there are two rear admiral ranks.

The term originated in the days of naval sailing squadrons and can trace its origins to the Royal Navy. Each naval squadron was assigned an admiral as its head, who commanded from the centre vessel and directed the squadron&#x27;s activities. The admiral would in turn be assisted by a vice admiral, who commanded the lead ships that bore the brunt of a battle. In the rear of the squadron, a third admiral commanded the remaining ships and, as this section was considered to be in the least danger, the admiral in command of it was typically the most junior. This has continued into the modern age, with rear admiral the most junior admiralty of many navies.

==Australia==
The Royal Australian Navy maintains a rank of rear admiral; refer to Australian Defence Force ranks and insignia. The abbreviation is RADM.

Since the mid-1990s, the insignia of a Royal Australian Navy rear admiral is the Crown of St. Edward above a crossed sword and baton, above two silver stars, above the word &quot;Australia&quot;. Like the Royal Navy version, the sword is a traditional naval cutlass. The stars have eight points, unlike the four pointed Order of the Bath stars used by the army (which are often referred to as &quot;pips&quot;). Prior to 1995, the RAN shoulder board was identical to the Royal Navy shoulder board. The Royal Navy shoulder board changed again in 2001 and the Australian and UK shoulder boards are now identical except for the word &quot;Australia&quot;.

Rear Admiral Robyn Walker became the first female admiral in the Royal Australian Navy when she was appointed Surgeon-General of the Australian Defence Force on 16 December 2011.

==Canada==

In the Royal Canadian Navy, the rank of rear-admiral (RAdm) (&quot;contre-amiral&quot; or &quot;CAm&quot; in French) is the Navy rank equivalent to major-general of the Army and Air Force. A rear-admiral is a flag officer, the naval equivalent of a general officer. A rear-admiral is senior to a commodore and brigadier-general, and junior to a vice-admiral and lieutenant-general.

The rank insignia for a rear-admiral is two silver maple leaves beneath a silver crossed sword and baton, all surmounted by St Edward&#x27;s Crown, worn on gold shoulder boards on the white short-sleeved shirt or the tropical white tunic. The service dress features a wide strip of gold braid around the cuff and, since June 2010, above it a narrower strip of gold braid embellished with the executive curl. On the visor of the service cap are two rows of gold oak leaves.

==India==
==Pakistan==

A rear admiral in the Pakistani Navy is a senior and two-star rank naval officer, appointed in higher naval commands. Like most Commonwealth navies, the rear admiral rank is superior to commodore and captain. However, the rank is junior to the three-star rank vice-admiral and four-star rank admiral, who is generally a Chief of Naval Staff of the Navy.

==New Zealand==
The highest ordinary rank currently filled in the Royal New Zealand Navy is rear admiral and this is the rank held by the Chief of Navy unless that person is also Chief of Defence Force.

==Singapore==

The Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) has two ranks with the title of rear admiral: rear-admiral (one-star), a one-star rank; and rear-admiral (two-star), a two-star rank.

==Sri Lanka==

Rear admiral is a two-star rank in the Sri Lanka Navy.

==Sweden==

In Sweden, rear admiral is a two-star admiral rank of the Swedish Navy.

==United Kingdom==

The Royal Navy maintains a rank of rear admiral. Note that the rank of rear admiral is quite different from the honorary office Rear-Admiral of the United Kingdom.

==United States==

In the United States, there have been two ranks with the title of rear admiral since 1985: rear admiral (lower half) (RDML), a one-star rank; and rear admiral (RADM), a two-star rank. Prior to that, a combination of ranks was used. Both the rear admiral (lower half) and rear admiral ranks exist in four of the uniformed services of the United States: the United States Navy, United States Coast Guard, United States Public Health Service (USPHS) Commissioned Corps, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Officer Corps (NOAA Corps).

<doc id="69477" wikidata="Q1088283" url="?curid=69477" title="Timeline of historic inventions">
<text>The timeline of historic inventions is a chronological list of particularly significant technological inventions and their inventors, where known. The dates in this article make frequent use of the units mya and kya, which refer to millions and thousands of years ago, respectively.
==Paleolithic==

The dates listed in this section refer to the earliest evidence of an invention found and dated by archaeologists (or in a few cases, suggested by indirect evidence). Dates are often approximate and change as more research is done, reported and seen. Older examples of any given technology are often found. The locations listed are for the site where the earliest solid evidence has been found, but especially for the earlier inventions, there is little certainty how close that may be to where the invention took place.

===Lower Paleolithic===
The Lower Paleolithic period lasted over 3 million years, during which there many human-like species evolved including toward the end of this period, &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;. The original divergence between humans and chimpanzees occurred 13 (Mya), however interbreeding continued until as recently as 4 Ma, with the first species clearly belonging to the human (and not chimpanzee) lineage being &quot;Australopithecus anamensis&quot;. Some species are controversial among paleoanthropologists, who disagree whether they are species on their own or not. Here Homo ergaster is included under Homo erectus, while Homo rhodesiensis is included under Homo heidelbergensis.

During this period the Quaternary glaciation began (about 2.58 million years ago), and continues to today. It has been an ice age, with cycles of 40–100,000 years alternating between long, cold, more glaciated periods, and shorter warmer periods – interglacial episodes.

* 3.3 Mya – 2.6 Mya: Stone tools - found in modern-day Kenya are older and only found on the archetype road. Ancient stone tools from Ethiopia (Oldowan) were hand-crafted by Australopithecus or related people.
* 2.3 Mya: Earliest likely control of fire and cooking, by &quot;Homo habilis&quot;
* 1.76 Mya: Advanced (Acheulean) stone tools in Kenya by &quot;Homo erectus&quot;
* 1.75 Mya – 150 kya: Varying estimates for the origin of language
* 1.5 Mya: Bone tools in Africa by &quot;Homo erectus&quot;
* 900 kya – 40 kya: Boats
* 500 kya: Hafting in South Africa by &quot;Homo heidelbergensis&quot;
* 500 kya – 450 kya: Woodworking construction in Zambia by &quot;Homo heidelbergensis&quot; (The oldest known surviving buildings are made from stone and date back no more than 9,500 years.)
* 420 – 200 kya: Food storage in the form of uncracked bones saved for their marrow in Qesem cave, Israel.
* 400 kya: Pigments in Zambia by &quot;Homo heidelbergensis&quot;
* 400 kya – 300 kya: Spears in Germany likely by &quot;Homo heidelbergensis&quot;

===Middle Paleolithic===
The dawn of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; around 300 kya coincides with the start of the Middle Paleolithic period. Towards the middle of this 250,000-year period, archaic humans such as Neanderthals and Denisovans began to spread out of Africa, joined later by &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;. Also late in the period, we have increased evidence of long-distance trade, religious rites, and other behavior associated with Behavioral modernity.
* 320 kya: The trade and long-distance transportation of resources (e.g. obsidian), use of pigments, and possible making of projectile points in Kenya
* 279 kya: Hafting and early stone-tipped projectile weapons in Ethiopia
* 200 kya: Simple glue (adhesive) made of one kind of material, birch tar, in Central Italy by Neanderthals.
* 200 kya: Beds in South Africa.
* 170 kya – 90 kya: Clothing, among anatomically modern humans in Africa. Genetic evidence from body lice suggests a range of dates centering over 100 thousand years ago. The first bone scrapers appropriate for scraping hides to make supple leather were found in Morocco dating to 90–120,000 years ago.
* 164 kya – 47 kya: Heat treating of stone blades in South Africa.
* 135 kya – 100 kya: Beads in Israel and Algeria
* 100 kya: Compound paints made in South Africa&lt;ref name=&quot;Washington Post-2011/10/12/gIQApyHrhL&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* 100 kya: Funerals (in the form of burial) in Israel
* 90 kya: Harpoons in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
* 70 kya – 60 kya in Sibudu Cave in South Africa by &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;:
** Compound adhesives
** Arrows and other evidence of bow-and-arrow technology
** Sewing needle
* 61 kya – 62 kya: Cave painting in Spain by Neanderthal
* 55.8–51.2 kya: Representational and Narrative art in Indonesia by &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;

===Upper Paleolithic to Early Mesolithic===
50 kya was long regarded as the beginning of behavioral modernity, which defined the Upper Paleolithic period. The upper Paleolithic lasted nearly 40,000 years, while research continues to push the beginnings of behavioral modernity earlier into the Middle Paleolithic. Behavioral modernity is characterized by the widespread observation of religious rites, artistic expression and the appearance of tools made for purely intellectual or artistic pursuits.

==Agricultural and proto-agricultural eras==
The end of the Last Glacial Period (&quot;ice age&quot;) and the beginning of the Holocene around 11.7 ka coincide with the Agricultural Revolution, marking the beginning of the agricultural era, which persisted there until the industrial revolution.

===Neolithic and Late Mesolithic===

During the Neolithic period, lasting 8400 years, stone began to be used for construction, and remained a predominant hard material for toolmaking. Copper and arsenic bronze were developed towards the end of this period, and of course the use of many softer materials such as wood, bone, and fibers continued. Domestication spread both in the sense of how many species were domesticated, and how widespread the practice became.

<doc id="69480" wikidata="Q152466" url="?curid=69480" title="Very high frequency">
<text>Very high frequency (VHF) is the ITU designation for the range of radio frequency electromagnetic waves (radio waves) from 30 to 300 megahertz (MHz), with corresponding wavelengths of ten meters to one meter. 
Frequencies immediately below VHF are denoted high frequency (HF), and the next higher frequencies are known as ultra high frequency (UHF).

VHF radio waves propagate mainly by line-of-sight, so they are blocked by hills and mountains, although due to refraction they can travel somewhat beyond the visual horizon out to about 160 km (100 miles). Common uses for radio waves in the VHF band are Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) and FM radio broadcasting, television broadcasting, two-way land mobile radio systems (emergency, business, private use and military), long range data communication up to several tens of kilometers with radio modems, amateur radio, and marine communications. Air traffic control communications and air navigation systems (e.g. VOR and ILS) work at distances of or more to aircraft at cruising altitude.

In the Americas and many other parts of the world, VHF Band I was used for the transmission of analog television. As part of the worldwide transition to digital terrestrial television most countries require broadcasters to air television in the VHF range using digital, rather than analog encoding.

==Propagation characteristics==
Radio waves in the VHF band propagate mainly by line-of-sight and ground-bounce paths; unlike in the HF band there is only some reflection at lower frequencies from the ionosphere (skywave propagation). They do not follow the contour of the Earth as ground waves and so are blocked by hills and mountains, although because they are weakly refracted (bent) by the atmosphere they can travel somewhat beyond the visual horizon out to about 160 km (100 miles). They can penetrate building walls and be received indoors, although in urban areas reflections from buildings cause multipath propagation, which can interfere with television reception. Atmospheric radio noise and interference (RFI) from electrical equipment is less of a problem in this and higher frequency bands than at lower frequencies. The VHF band is the first band at which efficient transmitting antennas are small enough that they can be mounted on vehicles and portable devices, so the band is used for two-way land mobile radio systems, such as walkie-talkies, and two way radio communication with aircraft (Airband) and ships (marine radio). Occasionally, when conditions are right, VHF waves can travel long distances by tropospheric ducting due to refraction by temperature gradients in the atmosphere.

==Line-of-sight calculation==
VHF transmission range is a function of transmitter power, receiver sensitivity, and distance to the horizon, since VHF signals propagate under normal conditions as a near line-of-sight phenomenon. The distance to the radio horizon is slightly extended over the geometric line of sight to the horizon, as radio waves are weakly bent back toward the Earth by the atmosphere.

An approximation to calculate the line-of-sight horizon distance (on Earth) is:
*distance in nautical miles = formula_1 where formula_2 is the height of the antenna in feet
*distance in kilometers = formula_3 where formula_4 is the height of the antenna in meters.

These approximations are only valid for antennas at heights that are small compared to the radius of the Earth. They may not necessarily be accurate in mountainous areas, since the landscape may not be transparent enough for radio waves.

In engineered communications systems, more complex calculations are required to assess the probable coverage area of a proposed transmitter station.

==Antennas==

VHF is the first band at which wavelengths are small enough that efficient transmitting antennas are short enough to mount on vehicles and handheld devices, a quarter wave whip antenna at VHF frequencies is 25 cm to 2.5 meter (10 inches to 8 feet) long. So the VHF and UHF wavelengths are used for two-way radios in vehicles, aircraft, and handheld transceivers and walkie-talkies. Portable radios usually use whips or rubber ducky antennas, while base stations usually use larger fiberglass whips or collinear arrays of vertical dipoles.

For directional antennas, the Yagi antenna is the most widely used as a high gain or &quot;beam&quot; antenna. For television reception, the Yagi is used, as well as the log-periodic antenna due to its wider bandwidth. Helical and turnstile antennas are used for satellite communication since they employ circular polarization. For even higher gain, multiple Yagis or helicals can be mounted together to make array antennas. Vertical collinear arrays of dipoles can be used to make high gain omnidirectional antennas, in which more of the antenna&#x27;s power is radiated in horizontal directions. Television and FM broadcasting stations use collinear arrays of specialized dipole antennas such as batwing antennas.

==Universal use==
Certain subparts of the VHF band have the same use around the world. Some national uses are detailed below.
*50–54 MHz: amateur radio 6-meter band.
*108–118 MHz: Air navigation beacons VOR and Instrument Landing System localizer.
*118–137 MHz: Airband for air traffic control, AM, 121.5 MHz is emergency frequency
*144–146 MHz: amateur radio 2-meter band (Extends up to 148 MHz in some Regions).
*156–174 MHz: VHF maritime mobile band for maritime two-way radio on ships.

==By country==
===Australia===

The VHF TV band in Australia was originally allocated channels 1 to 10-with channels 2, 7 and 9 assigned for the initial services in Sydney and Melbourne, and later the same channels were assigned in Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth. Other capital cities and regional areas used a combination of these and other frequencies as available. The initial commercial services in Hobart and Darwin were respectively allocated channels 6 and 8 rather than 7 or 9.

By the early 1960s it became apparent that the 10 VHF channels were insufficient to support the growth of television services. This was rectified by the addition of three additional frequencies-channels 0, 5A and 11. Older television sets using rotary dial tuners required adjustment to receive these new channels. Most TVs of that era were not equipped to receive these broadcasts, and so were modified at the owners&#x27; expense to be able to tune into these bands; otherwise the owner had to buy a new TV.

Several TV stations were allocated to VHF channels 3, 4 and 5, which were within the FM radio bands although not yet used for that purpose. A couple of notable examples were NBN-3 Newcastle, WIN-4 Wollongong and ABC Newcastle on channel 5. While some Channel 5 stations were moved to 5A in the 1970s and 80s, beginning in the 1990s, the Australian Broadcasting Authority began a process to move these stations to UHF bands to free up valuable VHF spectrum for its original purpose of FM radio. In addition, by 1985 the federal government decided new TV stations are to be broadcast on the UHF band.

Two new VHF channels, 9A and 12, have since been made available and are being used primarily for digital services (e.g. ABC in capital cities) but also for some new analogue services in regional areas. Because channel 9A is not used for television services in or near Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide or Perth, digital radio in those cities are broadcast on DAB frequencies blocks 9A, 9B and 9C.

VHF radio is also used for marine Radio as per its long-distance reachability comparing UHF frequencies.

Example allocation of VHF–UHF frequencies: 
* Radionavigation 60: 84–86 MHz
* Fixed Maritime Mobile: 130–135.7 MHz
* Fixed Aeronautical radio navigation: 160–190 MHz
* Broadcasting Aeronautical Radionavigation: 255–283.5 MHz
* Aeronautical Radionavigation AUS 49 / Maritime Radionavigation (radiobeacons) 73: 315–325 MHz

===New Zealand===
*44–51, 54–68 MHz: Band I Television (channels 1–3)
*87.5–108 MHz: Band II Radio
*118–137 MHz: Airband for air traffic control, AM
**108–117.975 MHz: Air navigation beacons VOR and ILS
**121.5 MHz is an emergency frequency
*144–148 MHz: Amateur radio 2-meter band
*156–162.2 MHz: Marine radio 
*174–230 MHz: Band III Television (channels 4–11)

Until 2013, the four main free-to-air TV stations in New Zealand used the VHF television bands (Band I and Band III) to transmit to New Zealand households. Other stations, including a variety of pay and regional free-to-air stations, were forced to broadcast in the UHF band, since the VHF band had been very overloaded with four stations sharing a very small frequency band, which was so overcrowded that one or more channels would not be available in some smaller towns.

However, at the end of 2013, all television channels stopped broadcasting on the VHF bands, as New Zealand moved to digital television broadcasting, requiring all stations to either broadcast on UHF or satellite (where UHF was unavailable) utilising the Freeview service.

Refer to Australasian television frequencies for more information.

===United Kingdom===
British television originally used VHF band I and band III. Television on VHF was in black and white with 405-line format (although there were experiments with all three colour systems-NTSC, PAL, and SECAM-adapted for the 405-line system in the late 1950s and early 1960s).

British colour television was broadcast on UHF (channels 21–69), beginning in the late 1960s. From then on, TV was broadcast on both VHF and UHF (VHF being a monochromatic downconversion from the 625-line colour signal), with the exception of BBC2 (which had always broadcast solely on UHF). The last British VHF TV transmitters closed down on January 3, 1985. VHF band III is now used in the UK for digital audio broadcasting, and VHF band II is used for FM radio, as it is in most of the world.

Unusually, the UK has an amateur radio allocation at 4 metres, 70–70.5 MHz.

===United States and Canada===
Frequency assignments between US and Canadian users are closely coordinated since much of the Canadian population is within VHF radio range of the US border. Certain discrete frequencies are reserved for radio astronomy.
The general services in the VHF band are:

*30–49.6 MHz: Licensed 2-way land mobile communication, with various sub-bands.
*30–88 MHz: Military VHF FM, including SINCGARS
*43–50 MHz: Cordless telephones, 49 MHz FM walkie-talkies and radio controlled toys, and mixed 2-way mobile communication. The FM broadcast band originally operated here (42–50 MHz) before it was moved to 88–108 MHz.
*50–54 MHz: Amateur radio 6-meter band
**50.8–51 MHz: Radio-controlled aircraft (on ten fixed frequencies at 20 kHz spacing) with an FCC amateur radio Service license, flown under FCC Part 97, rule 97.215. 
*54–88 MHz, known as &quot;Band I&quot; internationally; some DTV stations will appear here. See Pan-American television frequencies.
**54–72 MHz TV channels 2–4 (VHF-Lo)
**72–76 MHz: Radio controlled models, industrial remote control, and other devices. Model aircraft operate on 72 MHz while surface models operate on 75 MHz in the US and Canada, air navigation beacons 74.8–75.2 MHz.
**76–88 MHz TV channels 5–6 (VHF-Lo)
*87.5–108 MHz: FM radio broadcasting (87.9–91.9 non-commercial, 92–108 commercial in the United States) (known as &quot;Band II&quot; internationally)
*108–118 MHz: Air navigation beacons VOR
*118–137 MHz: Airband for air traffic control, AM
**121.5 MHz is an emergency frequency
*137–138 MHz Space research, space operations, meteorological satellite
*138–144 MHz: Land mobile, auxiliary civil services, satellite, space research, and other miscellaneous services
*144–148 MHz: Amateur radio 2-meter band
*148–150 MHz: Land mobile, fixed, satellite
*150–156 MHz: &quot;VHF business band&quot;, public safety, the unlicensed Multi-Use Radio Service (MURS), and other 2-way land mobile, FM
*156–158 MHz VHF Marine Radio
**156.8 MHz (Channel 16) is the maritime emergency and contact frequency.
* 159.81-161.565 MHz railways 
**159.81–160.2 are railroads in Canada only and are used by trucking companies in the U.S.
*160.6–162 Wireless microphones and TV/FM broadcast remote pickup
*162.4–162.55: NOAA Weather Stations, narrowband FM, Weatheradio Canada Stations
*174–240 MHz, known as &quot;Band III&quot; internationally. A number of DTV channels have begun broadcasting here, especially many of the stations which were assigned to these channels for previous analog operation.
**174–216 MHz television channels 7–13 (VHF-Hi)
**174–216 MHz: professional wireless microphones (low power, certain exact frequencies only)
**216–222 MHz: land mobile, fixed, maritime mobile,
**222–225 MHz: 1.25 meters (US) (Canada 219–220, 222–225 MHz) amateur radio
*225 MHz and above (UHF): Military aircraft radio, 243 MHz is an emergency frequency (225–400 MHz) AM, including HAVE QUICK, dGPS RTCM-104

Cable television, though not transmitted aerially, uses a spectrum of frequencies overlapping VHF.

====VHF television====
The U.S. FCC allocated television broadcasting to a channelized roster as early as 1938 with 19 channels. That changed three more times: in 1940 when Channel 19 was deleted and several channels changed frequencies, then in 1946 with television going from 18 channels to 13 channels, again with different frequencies, and finally in 1948 with the removal of Channel 1 (analog channels 2–13 remain as they were, even on cable television). Channels 14–19 later appeared on the UHF band, while channel 1 remains unused.

====87.5–87.9 MHz====
87.5–87.9 MHz is a radio band which, in most of the world, is used for FM broadcasting. In North America, however, this bandwidth is allocated to VHF television channel 6 (82–88 MHz). The analog audio for TV channel 6 is broadcast at 87.75 MHz (adjustable down to 87.74). Several stations, known as Frankenstations, most notably those joining the Pulse 87 franchise, have operated on this frequency as radio stations, though they use television licenses. As a result, FM radio receivers such as those found in automobiles which are designed to tune into this frequency range could receive the audio for analog-mode programming on the local TV channel 6 while in North America. The practice largely ended with the DTV transition in 2009, although some still exist.

The FM broadcast channel at 87.9 MHz is normally off-limits for FM audio broadcasting; it is reserved for displaced class D stations which have no other frequencies in the normal 88.1–107.9 MHz subband to move to. So far, only two stations have qualified to operate on 87.9 MHz: 10–watt KSFH in Mountain View, California and 34–watt translator K200AA in Sun Valley, Nevada.

==Unlicensed operation==
In some countries, particularly the United States and Canada, limited low-power license-free operation is available in the FM broadcast band for purposes such as micro-broadcasting and sending output from CD or digital media players to radios without auxiliary-in jacks, though this is illegal in some other countries. This practice was legalised in the United Kingdom on 8 December 2006.

<text>Choke is a 2001 novel by American author Chuck Palahniuk. The story focuses on Victor, a sex addict and con man who also works at a colonial reenactment museum. The novel was later adapted for film by Clark Gregg.

==Plot summary==
&quot;Choke&quot; follows Victor Mancini and his friend Denny through a few months of their lives with frequent flashbacks to the days when Victor was a child. Victor had grown up moving from one foster home to another as his mother was found to be unfit to raise him. During his childhood, his mother would kidnap him from his various foster parents, though every time they would eventually be caught and he would again be remanded over to the child welfare agency.

In the present-day setting of the book, Victor has left medical school to support his feeble mother, who is now in a nursing home. In order to pay for elder care for his mother, he resorts to being a con artist. Victor goes to various restaurants and purposely causes himself to choke midway through his meal, luring a &quot;good Samaritan&quot; into saving his life. He keeps a detailed list of everyone who saves him and sends them frequent letters about fictional bills he is unable to pay, causing them to send him money out of sympathy. 

Victor works at a re-enactment museum set in colonial times, where most of the employees are drug addicts or, in Denny&#x27;s case, a fellow recovering sex addict. He spends most of his time on the job guarding Denny (who is constantly being caught with &quot;contraband&quot; items that do not correspond with the time period of the museum) in the stocks. The two met at a sex addiction support group and later applied together for the same job. Denny is later fired from the museum, and begins collecting stones from around the city to build his &quot;dream home&quot;.

While growing up, Victor&#x27;s mother taught him numerous conspiracy theories and obscure medical facts, which both confused and frightened him. This and his constant moves from one home to another have left Victor unable to form lasting and stable relationships with women. As a result, Victor finds himself getting sexual gratification from women on a solely superficial level. Later on, he starts talking to his mother again for the first time in years.

==Film adaptation==

A film adaptation directed by Clark Gregg, starring Sam Rockwell and Anjelica Huston, was released commercially on September 26, 2008. Palahniuk makes a cameo appearance in the film.

==Editions==
* (hardcover; New York: Doubleday, 2001)
* (e-book, 2001)
* (paperback; New York: Anchor, 2002)

==Trivia==

*Much of Palahniuk&#x27;s research on &quot;Choke&quot; was conducted with total strangers at the gym and sexual addiction groups.
*A song by Scottish band Biffy Clyro is titled &quot;Joy.Discovery.Invention&quot; after a line in the novel.

<text>The National Inventors Hall of Fame (NIHF) is an American not-for-profit organization, founded in 1973, which recognizes individual engineers and inventors who hold a U.S. patent of significant technology. Besides the Hall of Fame, it also operates a museum in Alexandria, Virginia, sponsors educational programs, and a collegiate competition.

As of 2020, 603 inventors have been inducted, mostly constituting historic persons from the past three centuries, but including about 100 living inductees. Nominees must hold a U.S. patent of significant contribution to the U.S. welfare, and which advances science and useful arts. The 2020 class included 22 inventors.

== History ==
The National Inventors Hall of Fame was founded in 1973 on the initiative of H. Hume Mathews, then the chairman of the National Council of Patent Law Associations (now the National Council of Intellectual Property Law Associations). It was launched by Ed Sobey, who was also the first director. In 1974, it gained a major sponsor in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office from Washington, D.C.

At first, the Hall was housed in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in Washington, D.C., near the Washington National Airport but it soon needed more room at a more prominent location. A committee was formed in 1986 to find a new home for it. For a time, the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was the frontrunner. But in 1987, a patent attorney from Akron, Edwin &quot;Ned&quot; Oldham, the representative from the National Council of Patent Law Associations, led the drive to move the Hall to Akron. According to Maurice H. Klitzman, one of the founding members of the Board of Directors, because of the guaranteed financial support by the city of Akron that greatly exceeded any other community&#x27;s proposal, the Board selected Akron as the new home. The construction of the new building was finished in 1995 and the Hall opened to the public with the name of the Inventure Place.

From the beginning, the Inventure Place was intended to be more than a science and technology museum and library. It was designed to double as an inventor&#x27;s workshop and a national resource center for creativity. Designed by an architect from New York City, James Stewart Polshek, it was a stainless-steel building, shaped like a curving row of white sails, with five tiers of exhibits. One of the exhibits allowed the visitors to use computer programs for making animations and mechanisms for running laser-light shows.

But attendance did not meet the expectations and the museum never made a profit, although its related ventures and programs, such as Invent Now and Camp Invention, proved to be more successful. In 2002, its name was changed to the National Inventors Hall of Fame Museum. Six years later the Hall moved to Alexandria. Its former facility was converted to a specialty school for students in grades between 5th and 8th. It is now the National Inventors Hall of Fame STEM Middle School, a middle school for the Akron Public Schools.

== Activities ==

In Alexandria, the National Inventors Hall of Fame operates a museum in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office building at 600 Dulany Street, with a gallery of digital portraits of the honorees, interactive kiosks and a theater. Admission is free.

In addition to the exhibits of the artifacts and documents from the collections of the Patent and Trademark Office, it also sponsors Camp Invention, Club Invention, and the Collegiate Inventors Competition.

Camp Invention, founded in 1990, is a daytime summer camp for children, with program sites in 49 states. Camp Invention is the only nationally recognized summer program focused on creativity, innovation, real-world problem solving and the spirit of the invention.

The Collegiate Inventors Competition was created in 1990 to encourage college and university students to be creative and innovative with science, engineering, and technology for dealing with the problems of the world. Since then, with the help from the sponsors, it has awarded more than $1 million to the winning students in two categories, undergraduate and graduate. In 2012, the first places were won with a delivery therapy for treating cancer and a way to facilitate suturing in abdominal surgery. Other finalists included the use of CT scanning and 3-D printing technology to replicate an amputee&#x27;s lost hand, a low-profile shoulder brace that can be applied by the athletes themselves, and an electric motorcycle that runs on spheres instead of wheels.

<text>Philip II the Bold (; ; 17 January 1342 – 27 April 1404) was Duke of Burgundy and &quot;jure uxoris&quot; Count of Flanders, Artois and Burgundy. He was the fourth and youngest son of King John II of France and Bonne of Luxembourg.

Philip was the founder of the Burgundian branch of the House of Valois. His vast collection of territories made him the undisputed premier peer of the Kingdom of France and made his successors formidable subjects, and later rivals, of the kings of France.

Philip played an important role in the development of gunpowder artillery in European warfare, making extensive and successful use of it in his military campaigns.
By political marriage, from 1384 Philip gained control over Flanders, one of the most wealthy provinces of Europe in that time. He and his successors ruled it until 1482. This period is referred to as the Burgundian Netherlands. 

==Early life==
Philip was born in Pontoise in 1342 to John and Bonne of Luxembourg. His father, John, was the eldest son of Philip, Duke of Normandy, and Joan of Burgundy. His father became king of France in 1350. Philip became known as &quot;the Bold&quot; at the age of 14, when he fought beside his father at the Battle of Poitiers in 1356. They were captured during the battle by the English. He remained in custody with his father until the terms of their ransom were agreed to in the Treaty of Brétigny of 1360. He was created duke of Touraine in 1360, but in 1363, he returned this duchy to the crown to receive instead the Duchy of Burgundy in apanage from his father as a reward for his courage at the Battle of Poitiers.

==Duke of Burgundy==
On 19 June 1369, Philip married the 19-year-old Margaret, daughter of Count Louis II of Flanders, who in 1382 inherited the County of Flanders, the Duchy of Brabant, the County of Artois, and the Free County of Burgundy.

From 1379 to 1382, Philip helped his father-in-law Louis II put down revolts in Flanders, particularly in Ghent, by organising an army against Philip van Artevelde. The revolts were finally ended in 1385, following the death of Louis II, with the Peace of Tournai. As &quot;jure uxoris&quot; Count of Flanders, he would keep in mind the economic interests of the Flemish cities, which mainly made their money from weaving and spinning. He was aided in this by the expansion of the Three Members – a parliament consisting of representatives from the towns of Bruges, Ghent and Ypres – to the Four Members through the addition of the rural area Franc of Bruges.

In 1390, Philip also became the Count of Charolais, a title used by Philip the Good and Charles the Bold as the heirs of Burgundy.
Philip was very active at the court of France, particularly after the death in 1380 of his brother King Charles V, whose successor Charles VI became king at the age of 11. During Charles&#x27; minority, a council of Regents was set up to govern France that was made up of four of his uncles: Louis, Duke of Anjou, John, Duke of Berry, and Philip himself from his father&#x27;s side, and from his mother&#x27;s side, Louis II, Duke of Bourbon. Among Philip&#x27;s acts while regent was the suppression of a tax revolt in 1382 known as the Harelle. The regency lasted until 1388, always with Philip assuming the dominant role: Louis of Anjou spent much effort fighting for his claim to the Kingdom of Naples after 1382 and died in 1384, John of Berry was interested mainly in the Languedoc and not particularly interested in politics, and Louis of Bourbon was largely an unimportant figure due to his personality (he showed signs of mental instability) and his status (since he was not the son of a king). However, Philip, along with John of Berry and Louis of Bourbon, lost most of their power at court in 1388, when Charles VI chose to favour the advice of the Marmousets, his personal advisors, over that of his uncles when he attained his majority.

In 1392, events conspired to allow Philip to seize power once more in France. Charles VI&#x27;s friend and advisor Olivier de Clisson had recently been the target of an assassination attempt by agents of John V, Duke of Brittany. The would-be assassin, Pierre de Craon, had taken refuge in Brittany. Charles, outraged at these events, determined to punish Craon, and on 1 July 1392 led an expedition against Brittany. While travelling to Brittany, the king, already overwrought by the slow progress, was shocked by a madman who spent half-an-hour following the procession to warn the king that he had been betrayed. When a page dropped a lance, the king reacted by killing several of his knights and had to be wrestled to the ground. Philip, who was present, immediately assumed command and appointed himself regent, dismissing Charles&#x27; advisors. He was the principal ruler of France until 1402.

His seizure of power, however, had disastrous consequences for the unity of the House of Valois and of France itself. The king&#x27;s brother Louis, Duke of Orléans, resented his uncle taking over as regent instead of himself; the result was a feud between Philip and Louis that continued after their deaths by their families. In particular, both quarreled over royal funds, which each desired to appropriate for his own ends: Louis to fund his extravagant lifestyle, Philip to further his expansionist ambitions in Burgundy and the Low Countries. This struggle only served to enhance the reputation of Philip, since he appeared to be a sober and honest reformer in comparison to the profligate and irresponsible Louis. Although Charles VI confirmed his brother as regent in 1402 in a rare moment of sanity, Louis&#x27;s misrule allowed Philip to regain control of France as regent in 1404, shortly before his death.

In 1395, Philip the Bold outlawed cultivation of the Gamay grape in favour of Pinot Noir in an early example of agricultural regulation related to wine quality.

Philip died in Halle, County of Hainaut (modern Belgium), on 27 April 1404. His territories were bequeathed to his eldest son John the Fearless, who also inherited Philip&#x27;s political position in France and the leadership of the Burgundian branch of the Valois family against the Orléans branch.

==Tomb==
In 1378, Philip the Bold acquired the domain of Champmol, just outside Dijon, to build the Chartreuse de Champmol (1383–1388), a Carthusian monastery (&quot;Charterhouse&quot;), which he intended to house the tombs of his dynasty. His tomb, with pleurants and his recumbent effigy, is an outstanding work of Burgundian sculpture. They were created by Jean de Marville (1381–1389), Claus Sluter (1389–1406) and Claus de Werve (1406–1410). Jean Malouel, official painter to the duke, was responsible for the polychrome and gilt decoration. After his death, the body of Philip the Bold was eviscerated and embalmed, then placed in a lead coffin. It was then deposited in the choir of Chartreuse de Champmol on 16 June 1404. His internal organs were sent to the church of Saint Martin at Halle. In 1792, his body was transferred to Dijon Cathedral, and in the following year, his tomb was damaged by revolutionaries and looters. It was restored in the first half of the 19th century and today it is in housed the former palace of the dukes, now part of the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Dijon.

==Marriage and issue==
Philip the Bold married the future Countess Margaret III of Flanders on 19 June 1369, a marriage that would eventually reunite not only the Duchy of Burgundy with the Free County of Burgundy and the County of Artois, but also unite it to the rich County of Flanders. Philip and Margaret had the following children:

*John the Fearless (1371–1419, murdered at Montereau), his eldest son and successor as Duke of Burgundy
*Charles (1372–1373)
*Marguerite (October 1374 – 8 March 1441, Le Quesnoy), Countess of Mortain married William VI, Count of Holland and Duke of Bavaria-Straubing
*Louis (1377–1378)
*Catherine (April 1378, Montbard – 24 January 1425, Gray, Haute-Saône), married Leopold IV, Duke of Austria
*Bonne (1379–1399, Arras) betrothed to John I, Duke of Bourbon
*Antoine, Duke of Brabant (August 1384 – 25 October 1415, at Agincourt)
*Mary (September 1386, Dijon – 2 October 1422, Thonon-les-Bains), married Amadeus VIII, Duke of Savoy
*Philip II, Count of Nevers and Rethel (1389–1415, at Agincourt)

In arranging the marriages of his children, Philip followed an intelligent diplomatic and strategic design that would be followed by his successors in Burgundy as far as Emperor Maximilian I. For example, the double marriage in 1385 at Cambrai of his son, John the Fearless, and his daughter, Margaret, to Margaret of Bavaria and William of Bavaria, son and daughter of Albert, Count of Hainault and Holland, prepared the later union of Hainault and Holland with Burgundy and Flanders, as carried out by Philip&#x27;s grandson, Philip the Good. The marriages also inserted the new Valois Burgundy dynasty into the Wittelsbach network of alliances: the other daughters of Count Albert married William I, Duke of Guelders and Wenceslaus, King of Bohemia; their cousin, Isabeau of Bavaria married Charles VI of France, and became Queen of France.

In addition to his alliance with the Netherlandish Bavarians, Philip also made links with the Dukes of Austria and of Savoy by marrying his daughter Catherine to Leopold IV of Austria and his daughter Mary to Amadeus VIII of Savoy.

==Residences==

Few of Philip the Bold&#x27;s residences are still extant. Apart from several elements of the ducal palace in Dijon (Tour de Bar), the Château de Germolles is largely preserved. This residence was offered to his wife, Margaret III, Countess of Flanders in 1381. The princess transformed the old fortress into a luxurious home with the help of artists from the Burgundian School Claus Sluter and Jean de Beaumetz.

<text>Amadeus IX (1 February 1435 – 30 March 1472), nicknamed the Happy, was the Duke of Savoy from 1465 to 1472. The Catholic Church venerates him with a liturgical feast on March 30.

==Life==
Amadeus was born at Thonon-les-Bains, the son of Louis, Duke of Savoy, and Anne de Lusignan, daughter of Janus of Cyprus, King of Cyprus. In 1452, his mother arranged a political marriage to Yolande of Valois (1434–1478), sister of Louis XI of France and daughter of Charles VII of France. Because of his epilepsy and retirement, she was left in control of the state.

France and the Holy Roman Empire competed to gain control of Savoy&#x27;s strategically important Alpine mountain passes and trade routes. His sister, Charlotte of Savoy, became the second wife of Louis XI of France. French influence increased in Savoy and involved the country in the wars between France and the emperors. The Castle of Moncalleri in Piedmont, Italy had been built around 1100 as a hill fortress, to command the main southern access from Turin. In the mid-15th century Yolande turned it into a Renaissance Royal Palace.

Amadeus was a particular protector of Franciscan friars. He also endowed other religious houses as well as homes for the care of the poor and suffering. He made a pilgrimage to Saint-Claude in 1471. He died the following year.

Amadeus was an avid collector of manuscripts, adding over sixty items to the ducal library started by his great-grandfather Amadeus VII, Count of Savoy.

==Family==
Amadeus IX had ten children with Yolande of Valois:
# Louis (1453)
# Anne (1455–1480), married Frederick IV of Naples (1452–1504), prince of Altamura
# Charles (1456–1471), Prince of Piedmont
# Maria (1460–1511) married Philip of Hachberg-Sausenberg (1454–1503)
# Louise (1461–1503), married Hugh, Prince of Chalon and, later, became a Poor Clare nun 
# Philibert (1465–1482)
# Bernard (1467)
# Charles (1468–1490)
# James Louis (1470–1485), Count of Genevois, France
# Gian Claudio Galeazzo (1472)

His daughter Louise became a nun of the Franciscan Second Order after being widowed at a young age. She was also beatified.
==Beatification==
A miraculous reputation developed around a 1474 painting of Amadeus, housed in the Dominican church in Turin.

Michel Merle suggests that the cult of Amadeus was part of a decades long effort on the part of the House of Savoy to enhance its political status. 1612 saw the publication in Turin of a brief text extolling Amadeus, by Girolamo Cordieri, canon of the cathedral chapter of Mondovi. Cordieri was later to be appointed theologian to Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy. Also in 1612, a canon from Vercelli published a compendium of miracles attributed to Amadeus&#x27; intercession. 

In 1613, an &quot;Historia del Beato Amedeo terzo duca di Savoia&quot; was composed by Fr. Pietro-Francisco Malletta. Six years later, the Duke of Savoy issued nine-florin coins depicting Amadeus IX on one side. These appear to have been used as religious medals, particularly in the Chablais, where they were distributed by Francis de Sales.

Presented as a holy prince known for his charity and concern for the poor, Amadeus IX was beatified on 3 March 1677 by Pope Innocent XI.

<doc id="69495" wikidata="Q35667" url="?curid=69495" title="Geʽez">
<text>Geez ( or ; , and sometimes referred to in scholarly literature as Classical Ethiopic) is an ancient South Semitic language. The language originates from what is now Ethiopia and Eritrea.

Today, Geez is used as the main liturgical language of the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, Ethiopian Catholic Church, Eritrean Catholic Church, and the Beta Israel Jewish community.

Hawulti Obelisk is an ancient pre-Aksumite Obelisk located in Matara, Eritrea. The monument dates to the early Aksumite period and bears an example of the ancient Geez script.

In one study, Tigre was found to have a 71% lexical similarity to Geʽez, while Tigrinya had a 68% lexical similarity to Geʽez, followed by Amharic at 62%. Most linguists believe that Geez does not constitute a common ancestor of modern Ethio-Semitic languages but became a separate language early on from another hypothetical unattested common language.

== Phonology ==

=== Vowels ===


Historically, has a basic correspondence with Proto-Semitic short and , with short , the vowels with Proto-Semitic long respectively, and with the Proto-Semitic diphthongs and . In Geʽez there still exist many alternations between and , less so between and , e.g. &quot;taloku&quot; ~ &quot;talawku&quot; (&quot;I followed&quot;).

In the transcription employed by the Encyclopaedia Aethiopica, which is widely employed in academia, the contrast here represented as a/ā is represented as ä/a.

=== Consonants ===

==== Transliteration ====

Geez is transliterated according to the following system (see the phoneme table below for IPA values):




Because Geez is no longer spoken in daily life by large communities, the early pronunciation of some consonants is not completely certain. Gragg writes that &quot;[t]he consonants corresponding to the graphemes (Geez ) and (Geez ) have merged with ሰ and ጸ respectively in the phonological system represented by the traditional pronunciation—and indeed in all modern Ethiopian Semitic. ... There is, however, no evidence either in the tradition or in Ethiopian Semitic [for] what value these consonants may have had in Geez.&quot;

A similar problem is found for the consonant transliterated . Gragg notes that it corresponds in etymology to velar or uvular fricatives in other Semitic languages, but it is pronounced exactly the same as in the traditional pronunciation. Though the use of a different letter shows that it must originally have had some other pronunciation, what that pronunciation was is not certain.

The chart below lists and as possible values for () and () respectively. It also lists as a possible value for (). These values are tentative, but based on the reconstructed Proto-Semitic consonants that they are descended from.

==== Phonemes of Geʽez ====

The following table presents the consonants of the Geez language. The reconstructed phonetic value of a phoneme is given in IPA transcription, followed by its representation in the Geez script and scholarly transliteration.


==== Geez consonants in relation to Proto-Semitic ====

Geez consonants have a triple opposition between voiceless, voiced, and ejective (or emphatic) obstruents. The Proto-Semitic &quot;emphasis&quot; in Geez has been generalized to include emphatic . Geʽez has phonologized labiovelars, descending from Proto-Semitic biphonemes. Geez ś Sawt (in Amharic, also called &quot;śe-nigūś&quot;, i.e. the &quot;se&quot; letter used for spelling the word &quot;nigūś&quot; &quot;king&quot;) is reconstructed as descended from a Proto-Semitic voiceless lateral fricative . Like Arabic, Geez merged Proto-Semitic š and s in (also called &quot;se-isat&quot;: the &quot;se&quot; letter used for spelling the word &quot;isāt&quot; &quot;fire&quot;). Apart from this, Geez phonology is comparably conservative; the only other Proto-Semitic phonological contrasts lost may be the interdental fricatives and ghayn.

=== Stress ===

There is no evidence within the script of stress rules in the ancient period, but stress patterns exist within the liturgical tradition(s). Accounts of these patterns are, however, contradictory. One early 20th-century account may be broadly summarized as follows:
* primary stress only falls on the ultima (the last syllable) or the penult (the second-to-last syllable)
* in finite verbs (including the imperative), stress falls on the penult: &quot;qatálat&quot; (&quot;she killed&quot;), &quot;nə́gər&quot; (&quot;speak!&quot;, masculine singular), with the important exception of the 2nd-person feminine plural suffix &quot;-kə́n&quot;
* in nouns and adjectives (in citation form), and most adverbs, stress falls on the ultima: &quot;nəgúś&quot; (&quot;king&quot;), &quot;hagár&quot; (&quot;city&quot;), &quot;Gə́ʽz&quot; (&quot;Geʽez&quot;), &quot;ṭabíb&quot; (&quot;wise&quot;), &quot;həyyá&quot; (&quot;there&quot;); an exception among adverbs is &quot;zə́ya&quot; (&quot;here&quot;)
* the suffix &quot;-a&quot;, marking the construct state or the accusative case (or both), is not stressed: &quot;nəgúśa&quot;, &quot;hagára&quot;, &quot;Gə́ʽza&quot;, &quot;ṭabíba&quot;
* cardinal numbers are stressed on the ultima, even in the accusative, e.g. &quot;śalastú&quot; accusative &quot;śalastá&quot; (&quot;three&quot;)
* pronouns have rather unpredictable stress, so stress is learned for each form
* enclitic particles (such as &quot;-(ə)ssá&quot;) are stressed
* various grammatical words (short prepositions, conjunctions) and short nouns in the construct state are unstressed
As one example of a discrepancy, a different late 19th-century account says the masculine singular imperative is stressed on the ultima (e.g. &quot;nəgə́r&quot;, &quot;speak!&quot;), and that, in some patterns, words can be stressed on the third-, fourth- or even fifth-to-last syllable (e.g. &quot;bárakata&quot;).

Due to the high predictability of stress location in most words, textbooks, dictionaries and grammars generally do not mark it. Minimal pairs do exist, however, such as &quot;yənaggərā́&quot; (&quot;he speaks to her&quot;, with the pronoun suffix &quot;-(h)ā́&quot; &quot;her&quot;) vs. &quot;yənaggə́rā&quot; (&quot;they speak&quot;, feminine plural), both written .

== Morphology ==

=== Nouns ===

Geʽez distinguishes two genders, masculine and feminine, the latter of which is sometimes marked with the suffix , e.g. (&quot;sister&quot;). These are less strongly distinguished than in other Semitic languages, as many nouns not denoting humans can be used in either gender: in translated Christian texts there is even a tendency for nouns to follow the gender of the noun with a corresponding meaning in Greek.

There are two numbers, singular and plural. The plural can be constructed either by suffixing to a word (regardless of gender, but often if it is a male human noun), or by using an internal plural.

* Plural using suffix: (&quot;year&quot;) plural , (&quot;wilderness, uninhabited area&quot;) plural , (&quot;elder, chief&quot;) plural , (&quot;(arch)bishop&quot;) plural .
* Internal plural: (&quot;house&quot;) plural , (&quot;eyelid&quot;) plural .

Nouns also have two cases: the nominative, which is not marked, and the accusative, which is marked with final . As in other Semitic languages, there are at least two &quot;states&quot;, absolute (unmarked) and construct (marked with as well).

As in Classical/Standard Arabic, singular and plural nouns often take the same final inflectional affixes for case and state, as number morphology is achieved via attaching a suffix to the stem and/or an internal change in the stem.

There is some morphological interaction between consonant-final nouns and a pronoun suffix (see the table of suffix pronouns below). For example, when followed by (&quot;my&quot;), in both nominative and accusative the resulting form is (i.e. the accusative is &quot;not&quot; ), but with (&quot;your&quot;, masculine singular) there&#x27;s a distinction between nominative and accusative , and similarly with (&quot;his&quot;) between nominative (&lt; ) and accusative (&lt; ).

==== Internal plural ====

Internal plurals follow certain patterns. Triconsonantal nouns follow one of the following patterns.

Quadriconsonantal and some triconsonantal nouns follow the following pattern. Triconsonantal nouns that take this pattern must have at least one &quot;long&quot; vowel (namely ).

=== Pronominal morphology ===

In the independent pronouns, gender is not distinguished in the 1st person, and case is only distinguished in the 3rd person singular.

Suffix pronouns attach at the end of a noun, preposition or verb. The accusative/construct is lost when a plural noun with a consonant-final stem has a pronoun suffix attached (generally replaced by the added , as in , &quot;his&quot;), thereby losing the case/state distinction, but the distinction may be retained in the case of consonant-final singular nouns. Furthermore, suffix pronouns may or may not attract stress to themselves. In the following table, pronouns without a stress mark (an acute) are not stressed, and vowel-initial suffixes have also been given the base in the script.


=== Verb conjugation ===

== Syntax ==

=== Noun phrases ===

Noun phrases have the following overall order:
:(demonstratives) noun (adjective)-(relative clause)

Adjectives and determiners agree with the noun in gender and number:

Relative clauses are introduced by a pronoun which agrees in gender and number with the preceding noun:

As in many Semitic languages, possession by a noun phrase is shown through the construct state. In Geʽez, this is formed by suffixing the construct suffix to the possessed noun, which is followed by the possessor, as in the following examples:

Another common way of indicating possession by a noun phrase combines the pronominal suffix on a noun with the possessor preceded by the preposition /la=/ &#x27;to, for&#x27;:

Lambdin notes that in comparison to the construct state, this kind of possession is only possible when the possessor is definite and specific. Lambdin also notes that the construct state is the unmarked form of possession in Geʽez.

=== Prepositional phrases ===

Geʽez is a prepositional language, as in the following example:

There are three special prepositions, /ba=/ &#x27;in, with&#x27;, /la=/ &#x27;to, for&#x27;, /ʼəm=/ &#x27;from&#x27;, which always appear as clitics, as in the following examples:



These proclitic prepositions in Geʽez are similar to the Hebrew inseparable prepositions.

=== Sentences ===

The normal word order for declarative sentences is VSO. Objects of verbs show accusative case marked with the suffix /-a/:

Questions with a wh-word (&#x27;who&#x27;, &#x27;what&#x27;, etc.) show the question word at the beginning of the sentence:

=== Negation ===

The common way of negation is the prefix &quot;ʾi-&quot; which descends from &quot;ʾəy-&quot; (which is attested in Axum inscriptions), from earlier *&quot;ʾay&quot;, from Proto-Semitic &quot;*ʾal&quot; by palatalization. It is prefixed to verbs as follows:

==Writing system==

Geʽez is written with Ethiopic or the Geʽez abugida, a script that was originally developed specifically for this language. In languages that use it, such as Amharic and Tigrinya, the script is called &quot;&quot;, which means script or alphabet.

Geʽez is read from left to right.

The Geʽez script has been adapted to write other languages, usually ones that are also Semitic. The most widespread use is for Amharic in Ethiopia and Tigrinya in Eritrea and Ethiopia. It is also used for Sebatbeit, Meʼen, Agew, and most other languages of Ethiopia. In Eritrea it is used for Tigre, and it is often used for Bilen, a Cushitic language. Some other languages in the Horn of Africa, such as Oromo, used to be written using Geʽez but have switched to Latin-based alphabets.
It also uses four series of consonant signs for labialized velar consonants, which are variants of the non-labialized velar consonants:

== History and literature ==
In addition to the Bible including the Deuterocanonical books there are many medieval and early modern original texts. Most important works are also the literature of the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church and Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, which include Christian liturgy (service books, prayers, hymns), hagiographies, and Patristic literature. For example, around 200 texts were written about indigenous Ethiopian saints from the fourteenth through the nineteenth century. Traditional education was the responsibility of priests and monks. &quot;The Church thus constituted the custodian of the nation&#x27;s culture&quot;, says Richard Pankhurst, who describes the traditional education as follows:

However, works of history and chronography, ecclesiastical and civil law, philology, medicine, and letters were also written in Geʽez.

Significant collections of Ethiopian manuscripts are found outside of Ethiopia in France, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The collection in the British Library comprises some 800 manuscripts dating from the 15th to the 20th centuries, notably including magical and divinatory scrolls, and illuminated manuscripts of the 16th to 17th centuries. It was initiated by a donation of 74 codices by the Church of England Missionary Society in the 1830s and 1840s, and substantially expanded by 349 codices, looted by the British from the Emperor Tewodros II&#x27;s capital at Magdala in the 1868 Expedition to Abyssinia. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City has at least two illuminated manuscripts in Geʽez.

=== Origins ===
The Geʽez language is classified as a South Semitic language, though an alternative hypothesis posits that the Semitic languages of Eritrea and Ethiopia may best be considered an independent branch of Semitic, with Geʽez and the closely related Tigrinya and Tigre languages forming a northern branch while Amharic, Argobba, Harari and the Gurage languages form the southern branch.

Inscriptions dating to the mid-1st millennium BCE, written in the Sabaean language in the epigraphic South Arabian script, have been found in the kingdom of Dʿmt, serving at least as a witness to a presence of speakers of Semitic languages in the region. There is some evidence of Semitic languages being spoken in Eritrea since approximately 2000 BC. Unlike previously assumed, the Geʽez language is now not regarded as an offshoot of Sabaean or any other forms of Old South Arabian.

Early inscriptions in Geʽez from the Kingdom of Aksum (appearing varyingly in the epigraphic South Arabian script, and unvocalized or vocalized Ethiopic/Geʽez script) have been dated to as early as the 4th century CE. The surviving Geʽez literature properly begins in the same century with the Christianization of the Aksum, during the reign of Ezana of Aksum. The oldest known example of the Geʽez script, unvocalized and containing religiously pagan references, is found on the Hawulti obelisk in Matara, Eritrea. There exist about a dozen long inscriptions dating to the 4th and 5th centuries, and over 200 short ones.

=== 5th to 7th centuries ===

The oldest surviving Geʽez manuscript is thought to be the second of the Garima Gospels, dating to the 5th or 6th century. Almost all transmitted texts from this early &quot;Aksumite&quot; period are religious (Christian) in nature, and translated from Greek. Indeed, the range and scope of the translation enterprise undertaken in the first century of the new Axumite church has few parallels in the early centuries of Christian history. The outcome was an Ethiopic Bible containing 81 Books: 46 of the Old Testament and 35 of the New. A number of these Books are called &quot;deuterocanonical&quot; (or &quot;apocryphal&quot; according to certain Western theologians), such as the Ascension of Isaiah, Jubilees, Enoch, the Paralipomena of Baruch, Noah, Ezra, Nehemiah, Maccabees, and Tobit. The Book of Enoch in particular is notable since its complete text has survived in no other language; and, for the other works listed, the Ethiopic version is highly regarded as a witness to the original text.

Also to this early period dates Qerlos, a collection of Christological writings beginning with the treatise of Saint Cyril (known as &quot;Hamanot Reteʼet&quot; or &quot;De Recta Fide&quot;). These works are the theological foundation of the Ethiopic Church. In the later 5th century, the Aksumite Collection—an extensive selection of liturgical, theological, synodical and historical materials—was translated into Geʽez from Greek, providing a fundamental set of instructions and laws for the developing Axumite Church. Included in this collection is a translation of the Apostolic Tradition (attributed to Hippolytus of Rome, and lost in the original Greek) for which the Ethiopic version provides much the best surviving witness. Another important religious document is &quot;Serʼata Paknemis&quot;, a translation of the monastic Rules of Pachomius. Non-religious works translated in this period include &quot;Physiologus&quot;, a work of natural history also very popular in Europe.

=== 13th to 14th centuries ===

After the decline of the Aksumites, a lengthy gap follows; Some writers consider the period beginning from the 14th century an actual &quot;Golden Age&quot; of Geʽez literature—although by this time Geʽez was no longer a living language; in particular in the major enterprise of translating an extensive library of Coptic Arabic religious works into Geʽez.

While there is ample evidence that it had been replaced by Amharic in the south and by Tigrinya and Tigre in the north, Geʽez remained in use as the official written language until the 19th century, its status comparable to that of Medieval Latin in Europe.

At this time a lot of works of the Beta Israel had been turned into Hebraized (i.e. written in the Hebrew alphabet) Geʽez, which made the gradual process of Geʽez being the liturgical language of the Beta Israel.

Important hagiographies from this period include:

* the &quot;Gadle Samaʼetat&quot; &quot;Acts of the Martyrs&quot;
* the &quot;Gadle Hawaryat&quot; &quot;Acts of the Apostles&quot;
* the &quot;Senkessar&quot; or &quot;Synaxarium&quot;, translated as &quot;The Book of the Saints of the Ethiopian Church&quot;
* Other Lives of Saint Anthony, Saint George, Saint Tekle Haymanot, Saint Gabra Manfas Qeddus

Also at this time the &quot;Apostolic Constitutions&quot; was retranslated into Geʽez from Arabic. Another translation from this period is Zena ʼAyhud, a translation (probably from an Arabic translation) of Joseph ben Gurion&#x27;s &quot;History of the Jews&quot; (&quot;Sefer Josippon&quot;) written in Hebrew in the 10th century, which covers the period from the Captivity to the capture of Jerusalem by Titus.
Apart from theological works, the earliest contemporary Royal Chronicles of Ethiopia are date to the reign of Amda Seyon I (1314–44). With the appearance of the &quot;Victory Songs&quot; of Amda Seyon, this period also marks the beginning of Amharic literature.
The 14th century &quot;Kebra Nagast&quot; or &quot;Glory of the Kings&quot; by the Neburaʼed Yeshaq of Aksum is among the most significant works of Ethiopian literature, combining history, allegory and symbolism in a retelling of the story of the Queen of Sheba (i.e., Saba), King Solomon, and their son Menelik I of Ethiopia. Another work that began to take shape in this period is the &quot;Mashafa Aksum&quot; or &quot;Book of Axum&quot;.

=== 15th to 16th centuries ===

The early 15th century &quot;Fekkare Iyasus&quot; &quot;The Explication of Jesus&quot; contains a prophecy of a king called &quot;Tewodros&quot;, which rose to importance in 19th century Ethiopia as Tewodros II chose this throne name.

Literature flourished especially during the reign of Emperor Zara Yaqob. Written by the Emperor himself were &quot;Matsʼhafe Berhan&quot; (&quot;The Book of Light&quot;) and &quot;Matshafe Milad&quot; (&quot;The Book of Nativity&quot;). Numerous homilies were written in this period, notably &quot;Retuʼa Haimanot&quot; (&quot;True Orthodoxy&quot;) ascribed to John Chrysostom. Also of monumental importance was the appearance of the Geʽez translation of the Fetha Negest (&quot;Laws of the Kings&quot;), thought to have been around 1450, and ascribed to one Petros Abda Sayd — that was later to function as the supreme Law for Ethiopia, until it was replaced by a modern Constitution in 1931.

By the beginning of the 16th century, the Islamic invasions put an end to the flourishing of Ethiopian literature.
A letter of Abba ʼEnbaqom (or &quot;Habakkuk&quot;) to Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi, entitled &quot;Anqasa Amin&quot; (&quot;Gate of the Faith&quot;), giving his reasons for abandoning Islam, although probably first written in Arabic and later rewritten in an expanded Geʽez version around 1532, is considered one of the classics of later Geʽez literature. During this period, Ethiopian writers begin to address differences between the Ethiopian and the Roman Catholic Church in such works as the &quot;Confession&quot; of Emperor Gelawdewos, &quot;Sawana Nafs&quot; (&quot;Refuge of the Soul&quot;), &quot;Fekkare Malakot&quot; (&quot;Exposition of the Godhead&quot;) and &quot;Haymanote Abaw&quot; (&quot;Faith of the Fathers&quot;). Around the year 1600, a number of works were translated from Arabic into Geʽez for the first time, including the &quot;Chronicle&quot; of John of Nikiu and the &quot;Universal History&quot; of George Elmacin.

=== Current usage in Eritrea, Ethiopia and Israel ===

Geʽez is the liturgical language of Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo, Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo, Ethiopian Catholic and Eritrean Catholic Christians and the Beta Israel, and is used in prayer and in scheduled public celebrations.

The liturgical rite used by the Christian churches is referred to as the Ethiopic Rite or the Geʽez Rite.

<text>Philibert I (17 August 1465, Chambéry – 22 September 1482), surnamed the Hunter, was the son of Amadeus IX, Duke of Savoy and Yolande of Valois. Philibert was Duke of Savoy from 1472 to 1482.

After his father&#x27;s death in 1472, his mother became regent. Philibert was betrothed to Bianca Maria Sforza, daughter of Galeazzo Maria Sforza of Milan, by his second wife, Bona of Savoy, in 1474. They had no children.

Initially kidnapped by Savoyard noblemen and held at Turin, the intervention of Louis XI of France led to Philibert&#x27;s release. He died from tuberculosis, in Lyons, at the age of 17 and the duchy was inherited by his younger brother Charles.

<text>Charles I (28 March 1468 – 13 March 1490), called the Warrior, was the Duke of Savoy from 1482 to 1490 and titular king of Cyprus, Jerusalem, and Armenia from 1485 to 1490.

==Life==
Charles was son of Amadeus IX, Duke of Savoy, and Yolande of Valois, daughter of king Charles VII of France.

Charles was 17 when Charlotte of Cyprus, titular Queen of Armenia and Jerusalem, surrendered her rights to Cyprus, Armenia, and Jerusalem to him. He was the next legitimate heir in line from King Janus of Cyprus and Armenia. The kingdom itself was held by the Republic of Venice, but the Savoy dynasty continued to claim it.

==Family==
Charles married his second cousin Blanche Palaiologina (Bianca di Monferrato) (1472–1519), daughter of William VIII, Marquess of Montferrat, and Elisabetta Sforza. 

After Charles died from tuberculosis, Blanche was regent of the Duchy of Savoy from 1490 to 1496. They had:

#Yolande Louise of Savoy (1487–1499), married Philibert II of Savoy
#Charles John Amadeus of Savoy (1489–1496)

<text>Acinonyx is a genus within the Felidae family. The only living species of the genus, the cheetah (&quot;A. jubatus&quot;), lives in open grasslands of Africa and Asia.

Several fossil remains of cheetah-like cats were excavated that date to the late Pliocene and Middle Pleistocene. These cats occurred in Africa, parts of Europe and Asia about 10,000 years ago. Several similar species classified in the genus &quot;Miracinonyx&quot; lived in North America at the same time; these may have been more closely related to the genus &quot;Puma&quot;.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Acinonyx&quot; was proposed by Joshua Brookes in 1828.

Between the late 18th century and the early 20th century, the following &quot;Acinonyx&quot; species and subspecies were described:
* &quot;Felis jubatus&quot; by Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber in 1777 was based on earlier descriptions by Comte de Buffon and Thomas Pennant.
** &quot;Felis venatica&quot; by Griffith in 1821 was based on a sketch of a cheetah from India.
** &quot;Cynailurus soemmeringi&quot; by Fitzinger in 1855 was a live male cheetah brought by Theodor von Heuglin to Tiergarten Schönbrunn from Kordofan in southern Sudan.
** &quot;Acinonyx hecki&quot; by Hilzheimer in 1913 was a captive cheetah from Senegal in the Berlin Zoological Garden, named in honour of the zoo&#x27;s director.
In 1993, &quot;Acinonyx&quot; was placed in the monophyletic subfamily Acinonychinae. Molecular phylogenetic analysis has shown that it is the sister group of the genus &quot;Puma&quot;, and it is now placed within the subfamily Felinae.

In addition, the following fossil &quot;Acinonyx&quot; species were described:
* &quot;Acinonyx pardinensis&quot; by Croizet et Jobert in 1828
* &quot;Acinonyx arvernensis&quot; by Croizet et Jobert in 1828
* &quot;Acinonyx intermedius&quot; by Thenius in 1954
* &quot;Acinonyx aicha&quot; by Geraads in 1997
* &quot;Acinonyx pleistocaenicus&quot; by Zdansky in 1925

The &quot;Linxia Cheetah&quot; (&quot;&quot;A. kurteni&quot;) was initially described by Christiansen and Mazák in 2009 on the basis of a skull from Pliocene strata in China, and touted as the most primitive member of the genus. In 2012, &quot;A. kurteni&quot;&quot; was invalidated as a species when the holotype was determined to be a forgery composed of Miocene-aged fragments.

<text>The Vigenère cipher () is a method of encrypting alphabetic text where each letter of the plaintext is encoded with a different Caesar cipher, whose increment is determined by the corresponding letter of another text, the key.

For example, if the plaintext is codice_1 and the key is codice_2, then

*the first letter of the plaintext, codice_3, is shifted by 14 positions in the alphabet (because the first letter of the key, codice_4, is the 14th letter of the alphabet, counting from zero), yielding codice_4; 

*the second letter, codice_6, is shifted by 2 (because the second letter of the key, codice_7, is the 2nd letter of the alphabet, counting from zero) yielding codice_8;

*the third letter, codice_6, is shifted by 20 (codice_10), yielding codice_11, with wrap-around;
and so on; yielding the message codice_12. If the recipient of the message knows the key, they can recover the plaintext by reversing this process.

The Vigenère cipher is therefore a special case of a polyalphabetic substitution.

First described by Giovan Battista Bellaso in 1553, the cipher is easy to understand and implement, but it resisted all attempts to break it until 1863, three centuries later. This earned it the description le chiffrage indéchiffrable (French for &#x27;the indecipherable cipher&#x27;). Many people have tried to implement encryption schemes that are essentially Vigenère ciphers. In 1863, Friedrich Kasiski was the first to publish a general method of deciphering Vigenère ciphers.

In the 19th century, the scheme was misattributed to Blaise de Vigenère (1523–1596) and so acquired its present name.

==History==
The very first well-documented description of a polyalphabetic cipher was by Leon Battista Alberti around 1467 and used a metal cipher disk to switch between cipher alphabets. Alberti&#x27;s system only switched alphabets after several words, and switches were indicated by writing the letter of the corresponding alphabet in the ciphertext. Later, Johannes Trithemius, in his work &quot;Polygraphia&quot; (which was completed in manuscript form in 1508 but first published in 1518), invented the tabula recta, a critical component of the Vigenère cipher. The Trithemius cipher, however, provided a progressive, rather rigid and predictable system for switching between cipher alphabets.

In 1586 Blaise de Vigenère published a type of polyalphabetic cipher called an autokey cipher – because its key is based on the original plaintext – before the court of Henry III of France. The cipher now known as the Vigenère cipher, however, is based on that originally described by Giovan Battista Bellaso in his 1553 book &quot;La cifra del Sig. Giovan Battista Bellaso&quot;. He built upon the tabula recta of Trithemius but added a repeating &quot;countersign&quot; (a key) to switch cipher alphabets every letter.

Whereas Alberti and Trithemius used a fixed pattern of substitutions, Bellaso&#x27;s scheme meant the pattern of substitutions could be easily changed, simply by selecting a new key. Keys were typically single words or short phrases, known to both parties in advance, or transmitted &quot;out of band&quot; along with the message, Bellaso&#x27;s method thus required strong security for only the key. As it is relatively easy to secure a short key phrase, such as by a previous private conversation, Bellaso&#x27;s system was considerably more secure.

Note, however, as opposed to the modern Vigenère cipher, Bellaso&#x27;s cipher didn&#x27;t have 26 different &quot;shifts&quot; (different Caesar&#x27;s ciphers) for every letter, instead having 13 shifts for pairs of letters. In the 19th century, the invention of this cipher, essentially designed by Bellaso, was misattributed to Vigenère. David Kahn, in his book, &quot;The Codebreakers&quot; lamented this misattribution, saying that history had &quot;ignored this important contribution and instead named a regressive and elementary cipher for him [Vigenère] though he had nothing to do with it&quot;.

The Vigenère cipher gained a reputation for being exceptionally strong. Noted author and mathematician Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (Lewis Carroll) called the Vigenère cipher unbreakable in his 1868 piece &quot;The Alphabet Cipher&quot; in a children&#x27;s magazine. In 1917, &quot;Scientific American&quot; described the Vigenère cipher as &quot;impossible of translation&quot;. That reputation was not deserved. Charles Babbage is known to have broken a variant of the cipher as early as 1854 but did not publish his work. Kasiski entirely broke the cipher and published the technique in the 19th century, but even in the 16th century, some skilled cryptanalysts could occasionally break the cipher.
The Vigenère cipher is simple enough to be a field cipher if it is used in conjunction with cipher disks. The Confederate States of America, for example, used a brass cipher disk to implement the Vigenère cipher during the American Civil War. The Confederacy&#x27;s messages were far from secret, and the Union regularly cracked its messages. Throughout the war, the Confederate leadership primarily relied upon three key phrases: &quot;Manchester Bluff&quot;, &quot;Complete Victory&quot; and, as the war came to a close, &quot;Come Retribution&quot;.

A Vigenère cipher with a completely random (and non-reusable) key which is as long as the message becomes a one-time pad, a theoretically unbreakable cipher. Gilbert Vernam tried to repair the broken cipher (creating the Vernam–Vigenère cipher in 1918), but the technology he used was so cumbersome as to be impracticable.

==Description==
In a Caesar cipher, each letter of the alphabet is shifted along some number of places. For example, in a Caesar cipher of shift 3, codice_3 would become codice_14, codice_15 would become codice_16, codice_17 would become codice_18 and so on. The Vigenère cipher has several Caesar ciphers in sequence with different shift values.

To encrypt, a table of alphabets can be used, termed a &quot;tabula recta&quot;, &quot;Vigenère square&quot; or &quot;Vigenère table&quot;. It has the alphabet written out 26 times in different rows, each alphabet shifted cyclically to the left compared to the previous alphabet, corresponding to the 26 possible Caesar ciphers. At different points in the encryption process, the cipher uses a different alphabet from one of the rows. The alphabet used at each point depends on a repeating keyword.

For example, suppose that the plaintext to be encrypted is
:codice_19.

The person sending the message chooses a keyword and repeats it until it matches the length of the plaintext, for example, the keyword &quot;LEMON&quot;:
:codice_20

Each row starts with a key letter. The rest of the row holds the letters A to Z (in shifted order). Although there are 26 key rows shown, a code will use only as many keys (different alphabets) as there are unique letters in the key string, here just 5 keys: {L, E, M, O, N}. For successive letters of the message, successive letters of the key string will be taken and each message letter enciphered by using its corresponding key row. When a new character of the message is selected, the next letter of the key is chosen, and the row corresponding to that char is gone along to find the column heading that matches the message character. The letter at the intersection of [key-row, msg-col] is the enciphered letter.

For example, the first letter of the plaintext, codice_3, is paired with codice_22, the first letter of the key. Therefore, row codice_22 and column codice_24 of the Vigenère square are used, namely codice_22. Similarly, for the second letter of the plaintext, the second letter of the key is used. The letter at row codice_16 and column codice_27 is codice_28. The rest of the plaintext is enciphered in a similar fashion:
Decryption is performed by going to the row in the table corresponding to the key, finding the position of the ciphertext letter in that row and then using the column&#x27;s label as the plaintext. For example, in row codice_22 (from codice_30), the ciphertext codice_22 appears in column codice_24, so codice_3 is the first plaintext letter. Next, in row codice_16 (from codice_35), the ciphertext codice_28 is located in column codice_27. Thus codice_6 is the second plaintext letter.

== Algebraic description ==
Vigenère can also be described algebraically. If the letters codice_24–codice_40 are taken to be the numbers 0–25 (formula_1, formula_2, etc.), and addition is performed modulo 26, Vigenère encryption formula_3 using the key formula_4 can be written as

:formula_5

and decryption formula_6 using the key formula_4 as

:formula_8

in which formula_9 is the message, formula_10 is the ciphertext and formula_11 is the key obtained by repeating the keyword formula_12 times in which formula_13 is the keyword length.

Thus, by using the previous example, to encrypt formula_1 with key letter formula_15 the calculation would result in formula_16.
:formula_17

Therefore, to decrypt formula_18 with key letter formula_19, the calculation would result in formula_20.
:formula_21

In general, if formula_22 is the alphabet of length formula_23, and formula_13 is the length of key, Vigenère encryption and decryption can be written:

:formula_25

:formula_26

formula_27 denotes the offset of the &quot;i&quot;-th character of the plaintext formula_28 in the alphabet formula_22. For example, by taking the 26 English characters as the alphabet formula_30, the offset of A is 0, the offset of B is 1 etc. formula_31 and formula_32 are similar.

==Cryptanalysis==
The idea behind the Vigenère cipher, like all other polyalphabetic ciphers, is to disguise the plaintext letter frequency to interfere with a straightforward application of frequency analysis. For instance, if codice_41 is the most frequent letter in a ciphertext whose plaintext is in English, one might suspect that codice_41 corresponds to codice_43 since codice_43 is the most frequently used letter in English. However, by using the Vigenère cipher, codice_43 can be enciphered as different ciphertext letters at different points in the message, which defeats simple frequency analysis.

The primary weakness of the Vigenère cipher is the repeating nature of its key. If a cryptanalyst correctly guesses the key&#x27;s length &quot;n&quot;, the cipher text can be treated as &quot;n&quot; interleaved Caesar ciphers, which can easily be broken individually. The key length may be discovered by brute force testing each possible value of &quot;n&quot;, or Kasiski examination and the Friedman test can help to determine the key length (see below: and ).

=== Kasiski examination ===
In 1863, Friedrich Kasiski was the first to publish a successful general attack on the Vigenère cipher. Earlier attacks relied on knowledge of the plaintext or the use of a recognizable word as a key. Kasiski&#x27;s method had no such dependencies. Although Kasiski was the first to publish an account of the attack, it is clear that others had been aware of it. In 1854, Charles Babbage was goaded into breaking the Vigenère cipher when John Hall Brock Thwaites submitted a &quot;new&quot; cipher to the &quot;Journal of the Society of the Arts&quot;. When Babbage showed that Thwaites&#x27; cipher was essentially just another recreation of the Vigenère cipher, Thwaites presented a challenge to Babbage: given an original text (from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;: Act 1, Scene 2) and its enciphered version, he was to find the key words that Thwaites had used to encipher the original text. Babbage soon found the key words: &quot;two&quot; and &quot;combined&quot;. Babbage then enciphered the same passage from Shakespeare using different key words and challenged Thwaites to find Babbage&#x27;s key words. Babbage never explained the method that he used. Studies of Babbage&#x27;s notes reveal that he had used the method later published by Kasiski and suggest that he had been using the method as early as 1846.

The Kasiski examination, also called the Kasiski test, takes advantage of the fact that repeated words are, by chance, sometimes encrypted using the same key letters, leading to repeated groups in the ciphertext. For example, consider the following encryption using the keyword codice_46:

 Key: ABCDABCDABCDABCDABCDABCDABCD
 Plaintext: cryptoisshortforcryptography
 Ciphertext: CSASTPKVSIQUTGQUCSASTPIUAQJB

There is an easily noticed repetition in the ciphertext, and so the Kasiski test will be effective.

The distance between the repetitions of codice_47 is 16. If it is assumed that the repeated segments represent the same plaintext segments, that implies that the key is 16, 8, 4, 2, or 1 characters long. (All factors of the distance are possible key lengths; a key of length one is just a simple Caesar cipher, and its cryptanalysis is much easier.) Since key lengths 2 and 1 are unrealistically short, one needs to try only lengths 16, 8, and 4. Longer messages make the test more accurate because they usually contain more repeated ciphertext segments. The following ciphertext has two segments that are repeated:
 Ciphertext: SPMRVBVBBBURQGIBDUGRNICJRVUAXSSR
The distance between the repetitions of codice_48 is 18. If it is assumed that the repeated segments represent the same plaintext segments, that implies that the key is 18, 9, 6, 3, 2, or 1 characters long. The distance between the repetitions of codice_49 is 30 characters. That means that the key length could be 30, 15, 10, 6, 5, 3, 2, or 1 characters long. By taking the intersection of those sets, one could safely conclude that the most likely key length is 6 since 3, 2, and 1 are unrealistically short.

===Friedman test===
The Friedman test (sometimes known as the kappa test) was invented during the 1920s by William F. Friedman, who used the index of coincidence, which measures the unevenness of the cipher letter frequencies to break the cipher. By knowing the probability formula_33 that any two randomly chosen source language letters are the same (around 0.067 for case-insensitive English) and the probability of a coincidence for a uniform random selection from the alphabet formula_34 ( = 0.0385 for English), the key length can be estimated as the following:

: formula_35

from the observed coincidence rate

: formula_36

in which &quot;c&quot; is the size of the alphabet (26 for English), &quot;N&quot; is the length of the text and &quot;n&quot;1 to &quot;n&quot;&quot;c&quot; are the observed ciphertext letter frequencies, as integers.

That is, however, only an approximation; its accuracy increases with the length of the text. It would, in practice, be necessary to try various key lengths that are close to the estimate. A better approach for repeating-key ciphers is to copy the ciphertext into rows of a matrix with as many columns as an assumed key length and then to compute the average index of coincidence with each column considered separately. When that is done for each possible key length, the highest average index of coincidence then corresponds to the most-likely key length. Such tests may be supplemented by information from the Kasiski examination.

===Frequency analysis===

Once the length of the key is known, the ciphertext can be rewritten into that many columns, with each column corresponding to a single letter of the key. Each column consists of plaintext that has been encrypted by a single Caesar cipher. The Caesar key (shift) is just the letter of the Vigenère key that was used for that column. Using methods similar to those used to break the Caesar cipher, the letters in the ciphertext can be discovered.

An improvement to the Kasiski examination, known as Kerckhoffs&#x27; method, matches each column&#x27;s letter frequencies to shifted plaintext frequencies to discover the key letter (Caesar shift) for that column. Once every letter in the key is known, all the cryptanalyst has to do is to decrypt the ciphertext and reveal the plaintext. Kerckhoffs&#x27; method is not applicable if the Vigenère table has been scrambled, rather than using normal alphabetic sequences, but Kasiski examination and coincidence tests can still be used to determine key length.

===Key elimination===
The Vigenère cipher, with normal alphabets, essentially uses modulo arithmetic, which is commutative. Therefore, if the key length is known (or guessed), subtracting the cipher text from itself, offset by the key length, will produce the plain text subtracted from itself, also offset by the key length. If any &quot;probable word&quot; in the plain text is known or can be guessed, its self-subtraction can be recognized, which allows recovery of the key by subtracting the known plaintext from the cipher text. Key elimination is especially useful against short messages. For example, using codice_50 as the key below:

Then subtract the ciphertext from itself with a shift of the key length 4 for codice_50.

Which is nearly equivalent to subtracting the plaintext from itself by the same shift.

Which is algebraically represented for formula_37 as:

:formula_38

In this example, the words codice_52 are known.

This result codice_53 corresponds with the 9th through 12th letters in the result of the larger examples above. The known section and its location is verified.

Subtract codice_54 from that range of the ciphertext.

This produces the final result, the reveal of the key codice_50.

==Variants==

===Running key===
The running key variant of the Vigenère cipher was also considered unbreakable at one time. For the key, this version uses a block of text as long as the plaintext. Since the key is as long as the message, the Friedman and Kasiski tests no longer work, as the key is not repeated.

If multiple keys are used, the effective key length is the least common multiple of the lengths of the individual keys. For example, using the two keys codice_56 and codice_57, whose lengths are 2 and 3, one obtains an effective key length of 6 (the least common multiple of 2 and 3). This can be understood as the point where both keys line up.

Encrypting twice, first with the key codice_56 and then with the key codice_57 is the same as encrypting once with a key produced by encrypting one key with the other.

This is demonstrated by encrypting codice_19 with codice_61, to produce the same ciphertext as in the original example.

If key lengths are relatively prime, the effective key length grows exponentially as the individual key lengths are increased. For example, while the effective length of keys 10, 12, and 15 characters is only 60, that of keys of 8, 11, and 15 characters is 1320. If this effective key length is longer than the ciphertext, it achieves the same immunity to the Friedman and Kasiski tests as the running key variant.

If one uses a key that is truly random, is at least as long as the encrypted message, and is used only once, the Vigenère cipher is theoretically unbreakable. However, in that case, the key, not the cipher, provides cryptographic strength, and such systems are properly referred to collectively as one-time pad systems, irrespective of the ciphers employed.

===Variant Beaufort===

A simple variant is to encrypt by using the Vigenère decryption method and to decrypt by using Vigenère encryption. That method is sometimes referred to as &quot;Variant Beaufort&quot;. It is different from the Beaufort cipher, created by Francis Beaufort, which is similar to Vigenère but uses a slightly modified enciphering mechanism and tableau. The Beaufort cipher is a reciprocal cipher.

===Gronsfeld cipher===

Despite the Vigenère cipher&#x27;s apparent strength, it never became widely used throughout Europe. The Gronsfeld cipher is a variant attributed by Gaspar Schott to Count Gronsfeld (Josse Maximilaan van Gronsveld né van Bronckhorst) but was actually used much earlier by an ambassador of Duke of Mantua in 1560s-1570s. It is identical to the Vigenère cipher except that it uses just 10 different cipher alphabets, corresponding to the digits 0 to 9: a Gronsfeld key of 0123 is the same as a Vigenere key of ABCD. The Gronsfeld cipher is strengthened because its key is not a word, but it is weakened because it has just 10 cipher alphabets. It is Gronsfeld&#x27;s cipher that became widely used throughout Germany and Europe, despite its weaknesses.

===Vigenèreʼs autokey cipher===

Vigenère actually invented a stronger cipher, an autokey cipher. The name &quot;Vigenère cipher&quot; became associated with a simpler polyalphabetic cipher instead. In fact, the two ciphers were often confused, and both were sometimes called &quot;le chiffre indéchiffrable&quot;. Babbage actually broke the much-stronger autokey cipher, but Kasiski is generally credited with the first published solution to the fixed-key polyalphabetic ciphers.

<text>Philip II (5 February 1438 – 7 November 1497), surnamed the Landless, was the Duke of Savoy for a brief reign from 1496 to 1497.

==Biography==

Philip was the granduncle of the previous duke Charles II, and the youngest surviving son of Duke Louis of Savoy and Anne of Cyprus. However, he was not the heir general of the previous duke, there being several females before him in the line of succession. To ensure male inheritance to the Savoy line, his eldest son Philibert was married to his cousin, the only sister of the deceased young Duke. However, the plan did not succeed: the girl died at age twelve. (Philip had already died in the meantime.) The children of the daughters of Philip&#x27;s eldest brother Duke Amedeo IX of Savoy were next in line, and were entitled to the inheritance of the line of heirs-general, including Cyprus and Jerusalem. Despite the fact that Cyprus and Jerusalem did not bar succession in female line, Philip took those claims and used those titles as well. His male successors in Savoy also continued to do so, thus giving their ducal title a higher, royal titulary.

He spent most of his life as a junior member of the ducal family. His original apanage was the district of Bresse, close to the French and Burgundian border, but it was lost and therefore Philip received his sobriquet &quot;the Landless&quot;, or &quot;Lackland&quot;.

==Family==
===First marriage===
He married Margaret of Bourbon (5 February 1438 – 1483) and had:
# Louise (1476–1531), married Charles d&#x27;Orléans, Count of Angoulême, had children including:
##Francis I of France whose daughter Margaret of Valois married to Emanuele Filiberto of Savoy.
##Marguerite of Navarre (1492–1549); Queen consort of King Henry II of Navarre
# Girolamo (1478)
# Philibert II (1480–1504)
===Second marriage===
He married Claudine de Brosse of Brittany (1450–1513), daughter of Jean II de Brosse and Nicole de Châtillon, and they had:
# Charles III (1486–1553) who succeeded his half-brother as Duke of Savoy
# Louis (1488–1502)
# Philip (1490–1533), duke of Nemours
# Assolone (1494)
# Giovanni Amedeo (1495)
# Philiberta (1498–1524), married Julian II di Medici (1479–1516), duke of Nemours

===Illegitimate issue===
He also had eight illegitimate children by two mistresses.

<text>Philibert II (10 April 1480 – 10 September 1504), nicknamed the Handsome or the Good, was the Duke of Savoy from 1497 until his death.

==Biography==
Born in Pont-d&#x27;Ain, Philibert was the son of Philip (Filippo) the Landless and his first wife Marguerite of Bourbon. In 1496, Philibert&#x27;s father surprisingly succeeded as Duke, when his underaged grandnephew Duke Charles II of Savoy died, being the male heir of the line of Savoy.

The same year, the 16-year-old Philibert married the 9-year-old Yolande Louise of Savoy, his cousin and the only sister of the deceased young duke. She was daughter of Duke Charles I of Savoy, the Warrior, and Blanche of Montferrat, as well as granddaughter of Philibert&#x27;s late uncle, Duke Amadeus IX of Savoy. She was the heir-general of her brother, father, grandfather, and her grandmother Yolande of France, the eldest surviving daughter of king Charles VII of France. Her birthright, after the death of her brother, was the succession of the kingdoms of Cyprus, Jerusalem, and Armenia although Philibert&#x27;s father took those titles.
After a brief reign, Philip II died in 1497 and Philibert succeeded as Duke of Savoy. The young couple then at last advanced their claims, and took the titles Queen and King of Cyprus, Jerusalem and Armenia.

In 1499, the 12-year-old first wife of Philibert died, childless. Her heir was her first cousin, Princess Charlotte of Naples, later Countess of Laval. Philibert continued to use the titles of Cyprus etc., despite the death of his first wife.

His next marriage tied him into the web of alliances around the Habsburgs, who ruled the Netherlands, Alsace, Franche-Comté, Tyrol, Austria, etc. In 1501, he married Margaret of Austria, the only daughter of Maximilian I and his first wife Mary of Burgundy, the duchess of Burgundy. She had previously been married to John, Prince of Asturias, heir to the thrones of Aragon and Castile.

Early in Philibert&#x27;s reign, his first cousin Charles VIII of France died in 1498. The next king, Louis XII, would invade Italy the following year and conquer most of Naples. Louis would also conquer Milan, which neighboured Savoy to the east, thus putting the Savoyards between French possessions.

Philibert died in 1504 at the age of 24. Because he had no children, he was succeeded by his young half-brother Charles III.

==Family==

Philibert married:
# Yolande Louise of Savoy (1487–1499), daughter of his first cousin, Charles I of Savoy.
# Margaret of Austria, Duchess of Savoy who was Governor of the Seventeen Provinces of the Netherlands (1507–1515, 1519–1530) and the daughter of Maximilian I and Mary of Burgundy. There were no children from this marriage.

<text>The Boston Bruins are a professional ice hockey team based in Boston. The Bruins compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Atlantic Division in the Eastern Conference. The team has been in existence since 1924, making them the third-oldest active team in the NHL, and the oldest in the United States.

The Bruins are one of the &quot;Original Six&quot; NHL teams, along with the Detroit Red Wings, Chicago Blackhawks, Montreal Canadiens, New York Rangers, and Toronto Maple Leafs. They have won six Stanley Cup championships, tied for fourth-most of any team with the Blackhawks (trailing the Canadiens, Maple Leafs, and Red Wings, with 24, 13, and 11, respectively), and tied for second-most for an NHL team based in the United States. The Bruins have also won the Presidents&#x27; Trophy four times, with their most recent win in 2022–23 having amassed 135 points—the most in one season in NHL history.

The first facility to host the Bruins was the Boston Arena (now known as Matthews Arena), the world&#x27;s oldest (built 1909–10) indoor ice hockey facility still in use for the sport at any level of competition. Following the Bruins&#x27; departure from the Boston Arena, the team played its home games at the Boston Garden for 67 seasons, beginning in 1928 and concluding in 1995, when they moved to TD Garden.

==History==

===Early years (1924–1942)===
In 1924, the NHL made the decision to expand to the United States. The previous year in 1923, sports promoter Thomas Duggan received options on three NHL franchises for the United States, and sold one to Boston grocery magnate Charles Adams. The team was one of the NHL&#x27;s first expansion teams, and the first NHL team to be based in the United States. Adams&#x27; first act as owner was to hire Art Ross, a former star player and innovator, as general manager.

Ross came up with &quot;Bruins&quot; for a team nickname, a name for brown bears used in classic folk tales. The team&#x27;s nickname also went along with the team&#x27;s original uniform colors of brown and yellow, which came from Adams&#x27; grocery chain, First National Stores.
On December 1, 1924, the Bruins won the first ever NHL game played in the United States, hosting the Montreal Maroons at Boston Arena, with Smokey Harris scoring the first-ever Bruins goal, spurring the Bruins to a 2–1 win. This would be one of the few high points of the season, as the Bruins lost their next 11 games and only managed a 6–24–0 record, finishing in last place in its first season. The Bruins played three more seasons at the Arena, after which they became the main tenant of Boston Garden. 

The Bruins improved in their second season to a winning 17–15–4 record, which originally held the record for the biggest single-season improvement in NHL history, and is now third. However, they missed out on the third and final playoff berth by one point to the expansion Pittsburgh Pirates.

In their third season, Ross took advantage of the collapse of the Western Hockey League (WHL) to purchase several western stars, including the team&#x27;s first great star, defenseman Eddie Shore. With the Bruins, he would go on to become one of the greatest players in NHL history. Boston qualified for the then-expanded playoffs by a comfortable margin. In their first-ever playoff run, the Bruins reached the Stanley Cup Finals where they lost to the Ottawa Senators in the first Stanley Cup Finals between exclusively NHL teams. The Stanley Cup-winning game for the Senators would see Bruins&#x27; Billy Coutu attack the referee, earning him a ban from the NHL for life, the only in league history.
The 1928–29 season was the first played at Boston Garden. In 1929, the Bruins defeated the New York Rangers to win their first Stanley Cup in two games. Standout players on the first championship team included Shore, Harry Oliver, Dit Clapper, Dutch Gainor and goaltender Tiny Thompson.

The season after that, 1929–30, the Bruins posted the best-ever regular season winning percentage in the NHL (.875, a record which still stands) because of a 38–5–1 record, and shattered numerous scoring records, but lost to the Montreal Canadiens in the Stanley Cup Finals.

The 1930s Bruins teams included Shore, Thompson, Clapper, Babe Siebert and Cooney Weiland. The team led the league five times in the decade. In 1939, the team captured its second Stanley Cup. That year, Thompson was traded for rookie goaltender Frank Brimsek. Brimsek had an award-winning season, capturing the Vezina and Calder Trophies, becoming the first rookie named to the NHL first All-Star team, and earning the nickname &quot;Mr. Zero&quot;. The team skating in front of Brimsek included Bill Cowley, Shore, Clapper and &quot;Sudden Death&quot; Mel Hill (who scored three overtime goals in one playoff series), together with the &quot;Kraut line&quot; of center Milt Schmidt, right winger Bobby Bauer and left winger Woody Dumart.

In the 1939–40 season, Shore was traded to the struggling New York Americans for his final NHL season. In 1941, the Bruins won their third Stanley Cup after losing only eight games and finishing first in the regular season. It was their last Stanley Cup for 29 years. World War II affected the Bruins more than most teams; Brimsek and the &quot;Krauts&quot; all enlisted in the Royal Canadian Air Force following the 1941 Cup win, and lost the most productive years of their careers at war. Cowley, assisted by veteran player Clapper and Busher Jackson, became the team&#x27;s remaining star.

===Original Six era (1942–1967)===
The NHL had by 1942 been reduced, for the next 25 years, to the six teams that would come to be called the &quot;Original Six&quot;.

In 1944, Bruins&#x27; Herb Cain set the then-NHL record for points in a season with 82. However, the Bruins did not make the playoffs that season.

The stars returned from World War II for the 1945–46 season, and Clapper led the team back to the Stanley Cup Finals as player-coach. He retired as a player after the next season, becoming the first player to play twenty NHL seasons. Brimsek proved to be not as good as he was before the war, and after 1946 the Bruins lost in the first playoff round three consecutive years. After Brimsek was traded to the Blackhawks, the only remaining quality young player was forward Johnny Peirson.

During the 1948–49 season, the original form of the &quot;spoked-B&quot; logo, with a small number &quot;24&quot; to the left of the capital B signifying the calendar year in the 20th century in which the Bruins team first played, and a similarly small &quot;49&quot; to the right of the &quot;B&quot;, appeared on their home uniforms. The following season, the logo was modified into the basic &quot;spoked-B&quot; form that was to be used thereafter.
The 1950s began with Charles Adams&#x27; son Weston facing financial trouble. He was forced to accept a buyout offer from Walter A. Brown, the owner of the Boston Celtics and the Garden, in 1951. Although there were some instances of success (such as making the Stanley Cup Finals in 1953, 1957, and 1958, only to lose to the Montreal Canadiens each time), the Bruins mustered only four winning seasons between 1947 and 1967. They missed the playoffs eight consecutive years (1960 to 1967).

On January 18, 1958, the first-ever black NHL player, Willie O&#x27;Ree, stepped onto the ice for the Bruins. He played in 45 games for the Bruins over the 1957–58 and 1960–61 seasons. The &quot;Uke Line&quot;—named for the Ukrainian heritage of Johnny Bucyk, Vic Stasiuk, and Bronco Horvath – came to Boston in 1957 and enjoyed four productive offensive seasons, heralding, along with scoring stalwarts Don McKenney and Fleming Mackell, the successful era of the late 1950s. There followed a long and difficult reconstruction period in the early to mid-1960s.

===Expansion and the Big Bad Bruins (1967–1979)===
Weston Adams repurchased the Bruins in 1964 after Brown&#x27;s death. Adams signed future superstar defenseman Bobby Orr, who entered the league in 1966. Orr was that season&#x27;s winner of the Calder Memorial Trophy for Rookie of the Year and named to the second NHL All-Star Team. Despite Orr&#x27;s stellar rookie season, the Bruins would miss the playoffs. 

The next season, Boston made the playoffs for the first of 29 consecutive seasons, an all-time record. The Bruins then obtained forwards Phil Esposito, Ken Hodge and Fred Stanfield from Chicago in a deal celebrated as one of the most one-sided in hockey history. Hodge and Stanfield became key elements of the Bruins&#x27; success, and Esposito, who centered a line with Hodge and Wayne Cashman, became the league&#x27;s top goal scorer and the first NHL player to break the 100-point mark, setting many goal- and point-scoring records. With other stars like forwards Bucyk, John McKenzie, Derek Sanderson, and Hodge, defenders like Dallas Smith and goaltender Gerry Cheevers, the &quot;Big Bad Bruins&quot; became one of the league&#x27;s top teams from the late 1960s into the 1980s.

In 1970, a 29-year Stanley Cup drought came to an end in Boston, as the Bruins defeated the St. Louis Blues in four games in the 1970 Stanley Cup Finals. Orr scored the game-winning goal in overtime to clinch the Stanley Cup. The same season was Orr&#x27;s most awarded—the third of eight consecutive years he won the James Norris Memorial Trophy as the top defenseman in the NHL—and he won the Art Ross Trophy, the Conn Smythe Trophy and the Hart Memorial Trophy, the only player to ever win four major awards in the same season.

While Sinden temporarily retired from ice hockey before the 1970–71 season to enter business (he was replaced by ex-Bruins and Canadiens defenseman Tom Johnson), the Bruins set dozens of offensive scoring records: they had seven of the league&#x27;s top ten scorers—a feat not achieved before or since—set the record for wins in a season, and in a league that had never seen a 100-point scorer before the 1968–69 season, the Bruins had four that year. All four (Orr, Esposito, Bucyk and Hodge) were named First Team All-Stars. Boston were favored to repeat as Cup champions but lost to the Canadiens (and rookie goaltender Ken Dryden) in seven games.

While the Bruins were not quite as dominant the next season, Esposito and Orr were once again one-two in the scoring standings and Boston regained the Stanley Cup by defeating the New York Rangers in six games in the 1972 Stanley Cup Finals. 

The 1972–73 season saw upheaval for the Bruins. Former head coach Sinden became the general manager. Bruins players Gerry Cheevers, Derek Sanderson, Johnny McKenzie and Ted Green left to join the World Hockey Association (WHA). Coach Tom Johnson was fired 52 games into the season, replaced by Bep Guidolin. The Adams family, which had owned the team since its founding in the 1920s, sold it to Storer Broadcasting. The Bruins&#x27; season came to a premature end in a first-round loss to the Rangers in the 1973 playoffs. In 1974, the Bruins regained their first-place standing in the regular season, with three 100-point scorers on the team (Esposito, Orr, and Hodge). However, they lost the 1974 Stanley Cup Finals in an upset to the Philadelphia Flyers.
Don Cherry stepped behind the bench as the new coach in 1974–75. The Bruins stocked themselves with enforcers and grinders, and remained competitive under Cherry&#x27;s reign, the so-called &quot;Lunch Pail A.C&quot;., behind players such as Gregg Sheppard, Terry O&#x27;Reilly, Stan Jonathan and Peter McNab. This would also turn out to be Orr&#x27;s final full season in the league, before his knee injuries worsened, as well as the last time Orr and Esposito would finish 1–2 in regular season scoring. The Bruins placed second in the Adams Division, and lost to the Chicago Black Hawks in the first round of the 1975 playoffs, losing a best-of-three series, two games to one.

Continuing with Sinden&#x27;s rebuilding of the team, the Bruins traded Esposito and Carol Vadnais for Brad Park, Jean Ratelle and Joe Zanussi to the Rangers. The Bruins made the semifinals again, losing to the Flyers, before losing Orr as a free agent to Chicago in the off-season.

Cheevers returned in 1977, and the Bruins got past the Flyers in the semifinals, but were swept by the Canadiens in the Stanley Cup Finals. The story repeated itself in 1978—with a balanced attack that saw Boston have 11 players with 20+ goal seasons, still the NHL record—as the Bruins made the Cup Finals once more, but lost in six games to Montreal. After that series, John Bucyk retired, holding virtually every Bruins&#x27; career longevity and scoring mark to that time.

The 1979 semifinals series against the Canadiens proved to be Cherry&#x27;s undoing. In the deciding seventh game, the Bruins, up by a goal, were called for having too many men on the ice in the late stages of the third period. Montreal tied the game on the ensuing power play and won in overtime. Cherry was dismissed as head coach thereafter.

===Ray Bourque era (1979–2000)===
The 1979–80 season saw a new head coach Fred Creighton, and also included a trade of goaltender Ron Grahame to the Los Angeles Kings for a first-round pick which was used to select Ray Bourque, one of the greatest defensemen of all-time and the face of the Bruins for over two decades. The Bruins made the playoffs every year through the 1980s behind stars such as Park, Bourque and Rick Middleton, and had the league&#x27;s best record in 1982–83 behind a Vezina Trophy-winning season from ex-Flyers goaltender Pete Peeters, with 110 points, but fell short of making the Stanley Cup Finals.
Bourque, Cam Neely and Keith Crowder led the Bruins to another Stanley Cup Finals appearance in 1988 against the Edmonton Oilers. The Bruins lost in a four-game sweep. Boston returned to the Stanley Cup Finals in 1990 (with Neely, Bourque, Craig Janney, Bobby Carpenter, and rookie Don Sweeney, and former Oilers goaltender Andy Moog and Reggie Lemelin splitting goaltending duties), but again lost to the Oilers, this time in five games.

In the 1987–88 NHL season, the Bruins defeated their Original Six nemesis Montreal Canadiens in the playoffs. In 1991 and 1992, the Bruins suffered two consecutive conference finals losses to the eventual Cup champion, the Pittsburgh Penguins. Starting from the 1992–93 NHL season onwards, the Bruins had not gotten past the second round of the playoffs until winning the Stanley Cup after the 2011 season.

The 1992–93 season ended disappointingly. Despite finishing with the second-best regular season record after Pittsburgh, Boston was swept in the first round by the Buffalo Sabres. Bourque made the NHL All-Star First Team.

The 1995 season was the Bruins&#x27; last at the Boston Garden. The final official match played in the Garden was a 3–0 loss to the New Jersey Devils in the 1995 playoffs; the Bruins went on to play the final game at the old arena on September 28, 1995, in an exhibition matchup against the Canadiens. They subsequently moved into the FleetCenter, now known as the TD Garden. In the 1996 playoffs, the Bruins lost their first-round series to the Florida Panthers in five games.

In 1997, Boston missed the playoffs for the first time in 30 years (and for the first time in the expansion era), having set the North American major professional record for most consecutive seasons in the playoffs. The Bruins lost in the first round of the 1998 playoffs to the Washington Capitals in six games. In 1999, the Bruins defeated the Carolina Hurricanes in six games during the first round of the playoffs. Nevertheless, they would lose to the Sabres in six games in the second round of the playoffs.

===The new millennium (2000–2015)===
In the 1999–2000 season, the Bruins finished in last place in the Northeast Division and failed to qualify for the playoffs. During a game between the Bruins and the Vancouver Canucks on February 21, 2000, Marty McSorley was ejected for using his stick to hit Canucks forward Donald Brashear in the head, and subsequently suspended for what resulted in the rest of his career.

After a mediocre start, the Bruins fired coach Pat Burns in favor of Mike Keenan. Despite a 15-point improvement, the Bruins missed the playoffs in 2000–01, and Keenan was let go. Center Jason Allison led the Bruins in scoring. The following season, 2001–02, the Bruins won their first Northeast Division title since 1993 with a core built around Joe Thornton, Sergei Samsonov, Brian Rolston, Bill Guerin, Mike Knuble and Glen Murray. They lost in six games to the Montreal Canadiens in the first round of the playoffs.

The 2002–03 season found the Bruins finishing seventh in the East, but lost to the eventual Stanley Cup champion New Jersey Devils in five games. In 2003–04, the Bruins won another division title and appeared to get past the first round for the first time in five years with a 3–1 series lead on the rival Canadiens. However, the Canadiens rallied back to win three consecutive games, upsetting the Bruins.
The 2004–05 NHL season was wiped out by a lockout, and Bruins management eschewed younger free agents in favor of older veterans. The Bruins fired general manager Mike O&#x27;Connell in March and the Bruins missed the playoffs for the first time in five years.

Peter Chiarelli was hired as the new general manager of the team. Head coach Mike Sullivan was fired and Dave Lewis, former coach of the Detroit Red Wings, was hired to replace him. The Bruins signed star defenseman Zdeno Chara, and center Marc Savard. The 2006–07 season ended in the team finishing in last place in the division. 

After the disappointing 2006–07 season, Lewis was fired as coach, replaced by Claude Julien. 

The 2007–08 campaign saw the Bruins finish 41–29–12 and making the playoffs. Although Bruins center Patrice Bergeron was injured with a concussion most of the season, youngsters Milan Lucic, David Krejci and Vladimir Sobotka showed promise in the playoffs.

After a slow start to the 2008–09 season, the Bruins went on to have the best record in the Eastern Conference and qualified for the playoffs for the fifth time in nine years, facing the Canadiens in the playoffs for the fourth time during that span, defeating them in four games before losing in seven games to the Carolina Hurricanes in the conference semifinals.

On January 1, 2010, the Bruins won the 2010 Winter Classic over the Philadelphia Flyers in a 2–1 overtime decision at Fenway Park, thus becoming the first home team to win an outdoor classic game. They finished in sixth place in the Eastern Conference, and a 2010 NHL playoff opening round appearance against the Buffalo Sabres, which they won 4–2. Boston became only the third team in NHL history to lose a playoff series after leading 3–0 when they lost in game 7 to the Philadelphia Flyers.
In the 2011 Stanley Cup playoffs, the Bruins eliminated the Montreal Canadiens in seven games. On May 6, the Bruins swept the Philadelphia Flyers in four games to advance to the conference finals for the first time since 1992. Boston then defeated the Tampa Bay Lightning in seven games and advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time since 1990 to face the Vancouver Canucks, defeating them in seven games for the team&#x27;s first Stanley Cup since 1972. The 2010–11 Bruins were the first team in NHL history to win a game 7 three times in the same playoff run.

Following their Stanley Cup win, the Bruins lost Mark Recchi to retirement and Michael Ryder and Tomas Kaberle to free agency. The Bruins went on to finish second in the Eastern Conference with 102 points, winning the Northeast Division title, but losing to the Washington Capitals in the first round of the 2012 Stanley Cup playoffs in seven games.

During the off-season preceding the lockout, Tim Thomas made his decision to sit out the 2012–13 season; his rights were traded to the New York Islanders. The Bruins battled the Montreal Canadiens for leadership in the Northeast Division all season, before a loss to the Ottawa Senators in a make-up game following the Boston Marathon bombing on April 28 gave the Canadiens the division title. 
In the opening round of the 2013 playoffs, the Bruins took on the Toronto Maple Leafs, defeating them in seven games. They went on to beat the New York Rangers in five games and the Pittsburgh Penguins in a four-game sweep to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals and the Chicago Blackhawks, falling in six games, with three going into overtime.

In the 2013–14 season, the Bruins won the Presidents&#x27; Trophy after finishing first in the newly formed Atlantic Division with a record of 54–19–9 for 117 points. Their regular season success, however, would not translate into another conference finals appearance. Despite winning their first-round series against the Detroit Red Wings, the team fell to the Canadiens in seven games in the Eastern Conference semifinals during the 2014 playoffs.

In the 2014–15 season, the Bruins finished with a record of 41–27–14 for 96 points, missing out on the playoffs by just two points after the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Ottawa Senators clinched the final two playoff spots in the East. The Bruins therefore became only the third team to miss the playoffs after winning the Presidents&#x27; Trophy in the previous season. The 96 points they earned that season broke the record for the most points earned by a team that did not make the playoffs.

===Don Sweeney era (2015–present)===
On April 15, 2015, Peter Chiarelli was fired by the Boston Bruins. On May 20, the Bruins named former player Don Sweeney as the team&#x27;s new general manager for the 2015–16 season. One recent all-time franchise achievement the Bruins attained in the 2015–16 season is shared by only their greatest rival, the Canadiens – a total of 3,000 wins in the team&#x27;s existence, achieved by the Bruins on January 8, 2016, in a 4–1 road victory against the New Jersey Devils. The team was seen as a playoff contender throughout the regular season. However, a sub-.500 record on home ice and frequent road losses in the final two months of the regular season resulted in a three-way battle for the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. The Bruins had a chance to clinch the final playoff berth with a win over the Ottawa Senators on the second-to-last day of the season, but they lost the game and that combined with a Flyers&#x27; win over the Penguins, knocked them out of playoff contention in favor of the Flyers. For the first time since the two seasons following the 2004–05 lockout, the Bruins did not qualify for the playoffs in two consecutive seasons.
During the last two months of the 2016–17 regular season, the Bruins fired head coach Claude Julien and promoted Bruce Cassidy to interim coach. Cassidy&#x27;s very slight changes in coaching to emphasize the players&#x27; speed and hockey skills, as opposed to Julien&#x27;s, resulted in the Bruins achieving an 18–8–1 record through their remaining regular season games, finishing third in the Atlantic Division and qualifying for the playoffs for the first time since the 2013–14 season. In the first round of the playoffs, the Bruins lost to the Ottawa Senators in six games.

Cassidy returned as head coach for the 2017–18 season, leading the Bruins to the playoffs a consecutive season. They had a record of 50–20–12, including an 18-game point streak, which lasted from December 14, 2017, to January 25, 2018. They finished one point behind the Tampa Bay Lightning for the top spot in the Atlantic Division. They defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs in the first round, 4–3, but ultimately lost to the Lightning in round two, 4–1. The season saw young players perform well, including Jake DeBrusk, Danton Heinen, Ryan Donato, and Charlie McAvoy. The Bruins also acquired veterans Rick Nash, Nick Holden, Brian Gionta, and Tommy Wingels through trades or through free-agent signings.

During the 2018–19 season the Bruins finished the regular season in second place in the division with a 49–24–9 overall record. During the trade deadline, the team acquired Charlie Coyle and Marcus Johansson. In the first round of the 2019 Stanley Cup playoffs, as in the previous season, they faced the Maple Leafs, defeating them in seven games. In a six-game series, the Bruins defeated the Columbus Blue Jackets in the second round and advanced to the conference finals for the first time since 2013. The Bruins won the conference finals by sweeping out the Carolina Hurricanes in four games, thus winning the Prince of Wales Trophy and advancing to the 2019 Stanley Cup Finals for the third time in 10 years. They faced the St. Louis Blues in a rematch of the 1970 Stanley Cup Finals. This time, however, the Blues would emerge victorious, winning in seven games.

During the 2019–20 season, the Bruins consistently had the best record in the Atlantic Division and were near the top of the league. During the trade deadline, they acquired Ondrej Kase and Nick Ritchie, both from the Anaheim Ducks, in two separate trades. On March 12, 2020, the NHL season was paused due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time of the pause, the Bruins were first overall in the league, with 100 points. On May 26, Commissioner Gary Bettman announced that the 2019–20 regular season was completed and that the league would resume with the playoffs. The Bruins were awarded the Presidents&#x27; Trophy for the second time in a decade, while David Pastrnak&#x27;s 48 goals made him the first Bruin to win the Maurice &quot;Rocket&quot; Richard Trophy, which he shared with Alexander Ovechkin. During the 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs, the Bruins won the first round against the Carolina Hurricanes in five games, but lost to the Tampa Bay Lightning in the second round, also in five games. In the 2020–21 season, the Bruins made the 2021 playoffs, where they defeated the Washington Capitals in five games but lost to the New York Islanders in six games. In the next season, the Bruins clinched the 2022 playoffs as the first wild card team but were defeated by the Hurricanes in seven games. Following the season, head coach Cassidy was fired. They then hired Jim Montgomery, previously the head coach of the Dallas Stars, as their next head coach on July 3, 2022.

During the 2022–23 season, the Bruins broke NHL records and led the Atlantic Division for the entire season. First, they set an NHL record for longest home winning streak from the start of a season (14) from October 15 to December 3. Then on March 2, 2023, the Bruins recorded their 100th standings point of the season in their 61st game, becoming the fastest team to 100 points in NHL history, and surpassing the record previously held by the 1976–77 Montreal Canadiens. Nine days later, they set an all-time NHL record as the fastest team to achieve 50 wins, hitting the mark in 64 games compared to a previous record of 66 games held jointly by the 1995–96 Detroit Red Wings and 2018–19 Tampa Bay Lightning. In that same game, the Bruins became the third-fastest team in history to clinch a playoff spot during the era of 82-game seasons, trailing only the 1995–96 Detroit Red Wings (59 games) and the 1998–99 Dallas Stars (63 games). On April 9, 2023, the Bruins set the new all-time record for most games won in a season (63), when they defeated the Philadelphia Flyers. Two days later, the Bruins set the new all-time single-season points record (133), when they defeated the Washington Capitals, and they finished the season with 65 wins and 135 points. The Bruins lost to the Florida Panthers in seven games in the opening round of the 2023 Stanley Cup playoffs after giving up a 3–1 series lead.

In the 2023–24 season, the Bruins finished in second place in the Atlantic Division with 109 points. In the first round of the 2024 playoffs, the Bruins eliminated the Toronto Maple Leafs in seven games, and in the second round, they were eliminated by the eventual Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers again, this time in six games.

==Team information==

===Logo and uniforms===
Since 1948, the Bruins&#x27; logo is an eight-spoked, black and gold wheel with the letter &quot;B&quot; in the center, a nod to Boston&#x27;s nickname of &quot;The Hub&quot;. The logo has been tweaked numerous times over the course of its history, reaching its current form in 2007. The general design, in use since 1949, features the circle and &quot;B&quot; in black with gold spokes; black borders and a gold outer circle were added in 1995 and serifs on the &quot;B&quot; were added in 2007. The block &quot;B&quot; logo itself preceded the &quot;Spoked B&quot; and is currently the logo used in their third jersey.

The Bruins have also used an alternate logo featuring a walking bear surrounded by the full team name. The logo was first used from 1924 to 1932, and a modernized version was adopted as the team&#x27;s secondary logo in 2007.

The Bruins&#x27; colors were originally brown and gold. They wore brown uniforms in their maiden season, but switched to a white uniform with alternating brown and gold stripes the next season. The uniforms were paired with beige pants and either gold or white socks. After the 1932 season the walking bear logo was replaced with a simple block &quot;B&quot; logo.

Starting with the 1935–36 season, the Bruins replaced brown with black, while also sporting gold socks full-time. The &quot;B&quot; logo moved to the sleeves while the uniform number occupied the front. Black pants also replaced the beige pants.

For a majority of the 1940s, the Bruins sported gold numbers on the white uniform. From 1940 to 1944 they also wore a gold uniform with a script &quot;Bruins&quot; wordmark in front. To commemorate their 25th anniversary, the Bruins released a new white uniform featuring the first iteration of the &quot;Spoked B&quot; logo. The gold &quot;B&quot; on the logo was crudely drawn inside a black-spoked wheel, with &quot;24&quot; and &quot;49&quot; added to represent the foundation year and the franchise&#x27;s 25th year respectively. They also debuted a black uniform with the block &quot;B&quot; logo in front.

Beginning in 1949, the &quot;B&quot; on the &quot;Spoked B&quot; logo was changed to block lettering. They also brought back the black numbers. With a few cosmetic changes in the stripes and yoke along with the addition of the primitive bear head logo in 1977, the Bruins kept this overall design until 1995.

In 1955, the Bruins brought the &quot;Spoked B&quot; logo over to the black uniform; they also released a gold jersey with the &quot;Spoked B&quot; in front. The black uniform crest would feature an inverse version of the &quot;Spoked B&quot;, with the gold and black elements reversed, while the gold uniform featured the same logo but in a black circle. During this period, the gold jersey was used as the primary dark uniform while relegating the black uniform (updated with white numbers) into alternate status for several seasons. Also, for a few games between 1958 and 1965, the Bruins wore gold pants.

In 1967, the Bruins retired the gold uniforms and reinstated the black uniforms with gold numbers. As with the white uniforms, they endured several cosmetic changes until 1995. The gold socks, which had numerous striping modifications since 1934, was briefly retired in favor of wearing white socks full-time. It was brought back for the 1969–70 season and would be paired with the regular black uniforms for the next 47 seasons.

Starting with the 1995–96 season, the Bruins released a new uniform set, featuring the updated &quot;Spoked B&quot; logo. The primary uniforms featured a thick contrasting stripe that extended from sleeve to sleeve. In addition, a gold third jersey was released, featuring the infamous &quot;Pooh Bear&quot; logo (an homage to Winnie the Pooh). The gold thirds were used until 2006, after which the Bruins wore throwback black uniforms based on the 1970s design.

Moving to the Reebok Edge template in 2007, the Bruins unveiled new uniforms with the current &quot;Spoked B&quot; logo. The overall design borrowed a few elements from the 1970s uniforms, and also unveiled a new rendition of the original walking bear logo on the shoulders. The following season, they released new black third jerseys with the aforementioned bear logo in front and the &quot;Spoked B&quot; logo on the shoulders.
For the 2010 Winter Classic, the Bruins wore a brown and gold variation of the 1948–49 design. Then for the 2016 Winter Classic, the Bruins wore a black and gold variation of the original brown uniforms, a design they carried over the following season as an alternate.

The Bruins kept much of the same design upon moving to Adidas&#x27; AdiZero template in 2017. However, the black uniforms were now paired with black socks, a feature previously reserved on the alternate black uniforms.

For the 2019 Winter Classic, the Bruins wore white uniforms with brown and gold stripes and the &quot;B&quot; logo in front, paying homage to the mid-1930s uniforms. The simple &quot;B&quot; logo also adorned their new black alternate uniform, which was unveiled in the 2019–20 season and paid homage to the team&#x27;s 1950s uniforms.

Prior to the 2020–21 season, Adidas released its &quot;Reverse Retro&quot; series of alternate uniforms, which were alternate color renditions of throwback uniform designs. The Bruins&#x27; version was taken from the team&#x27;s 1977 to 1995 design, but with a gold base and black accents. A second &quot;Reverse Retro&quot; uniform was released in the 2022–23 season, this time featuring a white version of the 1995–2006 &quot;Pooh Bear&quot; alternates.

Boston&#x27;s 2023 Winter Classic uniform mixed various styles from the team&#x27;s uniform history. The black-based uniform featured gold stripes and vintage white letters. The &quot;BOSTON&quot; wordmark was inspired by the 1949 &quot;Spoked B&quot; logo, and the original bear head logo from 1977 to 1995 was positioned below.

For the 2023–24 centennial season, the Bruins unveiled a new set of uniforms, along with a commemorative logo featuring the modern &quot;Spoked B&quot; logo minus the gold outer circle and black borders on the spokes and &quot;B&quot;, closely resembling the original design worn from 1949 to 1995. The white uniform would feature the aforementioned logo, while the black uniform would feature an inverted version, with the &quot;B&quot; and circle in gold with black spokes. The gold used on the primary uniforms is a paler shade called &quot;Centennial gold&quot; rather than the traditional yellow gold; the yellow gold version remained in use for promotional purposes. In addition, the three gold stripes on each sleeve represented the six Stanley Cups the team has won, which are accented with thin black and thick white stripes. White numbers returned to the black uniform for the first time since the early 1960s and names featured no additional trim. An alternate beige uniform was also released. This design featured a modern take on the first &quot;Spoked B&quot; logo worn during the 1948–49 25th anniversary season, modified to include the foundation year &quot;1924&quot; along the horizontal spoke. The uniform heavily borrowed elements from the 1967–1974 uniforms which featured a gold yoke, but with brown and white trim. The brown-accented alternates were worn in all home games against Original Six teams, and a road game each at the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Montreal Canadiens.

In a December 1, 2024, game against the Montreal Canadiens, the Bruins wore a commemorative uniform to honor the 100th anniversary of the franchise&#x27;s first-ever game. The design featured the modernized version of the 1949–1995 &quot;spoked B&quot; logo worn during the centennial 2023–24 season but in the current yellow gold shade, and an inverted color version of the centennial &quot;walking bear&quot; patch along the right chest. The uniform was heavily based on the 1981–1995 uniforms, albeit with black tips on the gold socks. The collar featured the score of the team&#x27;s first-ever game against the Montreal Maroons.

===Ownership===
The team founder Charles Adams owned the team until 1936, at which point he transferred his stock to son Weston Adams, general manager and minority owner Art Ross and minority owner Ralph Burkard. Weston Adams remained majority owner until 1951, when the Boston Garden-Arena Corporation purchased controlling interest in the team. Under the Garden-Arena Corporation&#x27;s management, Boston Celtics founder Walter A. Brown ran the team from 1951 until his death in 1964. After Brown&#x27;s death, Weston Adams returned to the role of team president. In 1969, he was succeeded by his son, Weston Adams, Jr.
On December 7, 1973, Storer Broadcasting, owner of WSBK-TV, and the Garden-Arena Corporation agreed to a merger which resulted in Storer acquiring a 100% interest in the Bruins. Adams remained as team president. In August 1975, Storer Broadcasting then sold the team to an ownership group headed by Jeremy Jacobs. Jacobs had to promise to keep Bobby Orr as a condition of the purchase. The Bruins and Orr reached a verbal agreement with Jacobs during the summer of 1975, including a controversial agreement for Orr to take an 18.5% share of the Bruins after his playing days were over. The agreement was to be checked out as to whether it would be legal for tax reasons and whether or not the league would approve it. However, Orr&#x27;s agent, the later-notorious Alan Eagleson, rejected the deal.

Jacobs represents the club on the NHL&#x27;s board of governors, and serves on its executive committee, and he has chaired the finance committee. At the NHL board of governors meeting in June 2007, Jacobs was elected chairman of the board, replacing the Calgary Flames&#x27; Harley Hotchkiss, who stepped down after 12 years in the position. Jacobs has frequently been listed by the &quot;Sports Business Journal&quot; as one of the most influential people in sports in its annual poll and by &quot;The Hockey News&quot;. His company owns TD Garden and he is partners with John Henry, owner of Major League Baseball&#x27;s Boston Red Sox, in the New England Sports Network (NESN).

After taking over as owner in 1975, the Bruins have been competitive (making the playoffs for 29 consecutive seasons from 1967–68 to 1995–96, 20 of which were with Jacobs as owner) but have won the Stanley Cup only once, in 2011 and only in his 36th year as owner. Under previous ownerships, the Bruins had won the Stanley Cup five times. Under Jacobs, the Bruins have reached the Stanley Cup Finals seven times (twice against the Bruins&#x27; arch-rival Montreal Canadiens in 1977 and 1978, twice against the Edmonton Oilers in 1988 and 1990, finally winning in 2011 against the Vancouver Canucks, and losing in 2013 and 2019 to the Chicago Blackhawks and St. Louis Blues). Jacobs&#x27; management of the team in the past earned him spots on ESPN.com&#x27;s &quot;Page 2&quot; polls of &quot;The Worst Owners in Sports&quot;, and number 7 on their 2005 &quot;Greediest Owners in sports&quot; list. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; has suggested longtime star defenseman Ray Bourque, who &quot;often drawn the ire of the NHLPA for his willingness to re-sign with Boston with minimal negotiations over the years&quot; instead of setting the &quot;watermark for defenseman salaries&quot;, requested and received a trade in 2000 since the team&#x27;s &quot;hardline and spendthrift ways&quot; meant he would have to make the move to get his elusive Stanley Cup (Bourque holds the record for most games played before winning the Cup). Prior to the NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement signed in 2005, fans felt team management was not willing to spend to win the Stanley Cup.

Since 2005, Jacobs&#x27; public image has improved as he invested in the team and rebuilding the front office to make the team more competitive. The Bruins were the second highest-ranked team in the NHL in the 2008–09 season and were the top-seeded team in the East. With a complete change in management, including now-former general manager Peter Chiarelli – who lost his position with the Bruins on April 15, 2015, with the May 20 hiring of Don Sweeney – long-time assistant general manager with the team. Sweeney and team president Cam Neely had continued working with the longest-term Bruins head coach ever, Claude Julien until his firing on February 7, 2017, with Bruce Cassidy being hired as interim head coach with Julien&#x27;s firing – Cassidy would become the permanent head coach of the Bruins as of April 26, 2017. Neely has continued as team president since the Bruins&#x27; most recent Stanley Cup victory in 2011.

The current administrators in the Bruins front office are:

* Jeremy Jacobs – wner
* Charlie Jacobs – principal
* Don Sweeney – general ganager
* Cam Neely – president
* Harry Sinden – senior advisor to the owner
===Training facilities===
The Bruins previously trained and practiced at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center in Allston, Massachusetts (built in 1956), then moved to the Ristuccia Ice Arena in Wilmington, Massachusetts, itself completed in 1986, before the September 2016 completion of Warrior Ice Arena in the Brighton neighborhood of Boston, where they are currently training.

===Bruins&#x27; mascots===

Blades the Bruin is an anthropomorphic bear serves as the Bruins&#x27; team mascot. In January and February, Blades travels around the greater Boston area to raise money for the Bruins Foundation. For a sizable amount of the team&#x27;s more recent TV and online ads, a different anthropomorphic ursine character simply known as &quot;The Bear&quot; appears in official Bruins video advertising.

===Team songs===
When Boston television station WSBK-TV began broadcasting Bruins games in 1967, The Ventures&#x27; instrumental rock version of the Nutcracker&#x27;s overture, known as &quot;Nutty&quot;, was selected as the opening piece of music for Bruins telecasts. The song &quot;Nutty&quot; has been identified with the Bruins ever since.

On ice, &quot;Paree&quot;, a 1920s hit tune written by Leo Robin and Jose Padilla, has been played as an organ instrumental for decades, typically as the players entered the arena just before the start of each period and, for many years, after each Bruins&#x27; goal. It was introduced by John Kiley, the organist for the Bruins from the 1950s through the 1980s. In 1998, the John Kiley rendition of &quot;Paree&quot; was dropped as a goal song; &quot;Kernkraft 400 (Sport Chant Stadium Remix)&quot; by Zombie Nation is the current one.

There is evidence from contemporary newspaper accounts and photographs that Bruins manager Art Ross appointed captains on an annual basis in the 1930s and 1940s, and generally for a single season only. These include Marty Barry in 1933–34, Nels Stewart in 1934–35, Eddie Shore in 1935–36, Red Beattie in 1936–37, Bill Cowley in 1944–45 and Bobby Bauer in 1946–47. These captaincies had not been acknowledged by the Bruins&#x27; organization for many years, which had declined comment on the question. On September 20, 2023, the team confirmed these captaincies, stating there have been 27 captains in franchise history.

<doc id="69524" wikidata="Q318091" url="?curid=69524" title="Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy">
<text>Charles Emmanuel I (; 12 January 1562 – 26 July 1630), known as the Great, was the Duke of Savoy and ruler of the Savoyard states from 30 August 1580 until his death almost 50 years later in 1630, he was the longest-reigning Savoyard monarch at the time, only for his record to be surpassed by his great-grandson Victor Amadeus II. He was nicknamed (, in context &quot;the Hot-Headed&quot;) for his rashness and military aggression.

Being ambitious and confident, Charles pursued a policy of expansion for his duchy, seeking to expand it into a kingdom.

==Biography==

Charles was born in the Castle of Rivoli in Piedmont, the only child of Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy and Margaret of France, Duchess of Berry. He succeeded his father as duke on 30 August 1580. 

His father was a devout Catholic and advised Charles to follow in his footsteps:
My son, I urge you above all to be a true friend and devout servant of God and His holy Catholic religion, as were your ancestors. Never begin anything without first asking His favor and help, for while we men know little, that Majesty sees all and is eternal wisdom. So long as you rely on Him, you will be safe.
=== Alliance with Spain ===
Well-educated and intelligent, Charles spoke Italian, French, Spanish, as well as Latin. He proved an able warrior although short and hunchbacked. In the autumn of 1588, taking advantage of the civil war weakening France, he occupied the Marquisate of Saluzzo, which was under French protection. 

The new king, Henry IV, demanded the restitution of that land, but Charles Emmanuel refused, and war ensued. In 1590 he sent an expedition to Provence in the interests of the Catholic League, and followed it himself later, but the peace of 1593, by which Henry of Navarre was recognized as king of France, put an end to his ambitions.

On 1 August 1591, the Duke of Savoy appointed Tomás Fernández de Medrano as his Secretary of State and War, Medrano&#x27;s expertise in diplomacy and military strategy would have greatly benefited the duchy&#x27;s political and military endeavours. The broader conflict involving France and Spain ended with the Peace of Vervins (2 May 1598), which left the current but separate question of Saluzzo unsolved. After the Duke started talks with Spain, Henry threatened to return to war until, with the Treaty of Lyon (17 January 1601), Saluzzo went to Savoy in exchange for Bresse, Bugey, and Gex.

=== Oration of the Duke ===

The Duke&#x27;s Secretary of State and War, Tomás Fernández de Medrano, wrote an important political treatise titled &quot;Republica Mista&quot;, published in Madrid in 1602, which contains a rare and accurate record of the Duke of Savoy&#x27;s oration during the French War of Religion. An excerpt reads:

If the lord has the authority to command his vassals, and the vassals are obliged to obey the lord in matters not against God, how much more so in matters that serve Him, glorify Him, and are for your own well-being? For over six hundred years, your ancestors have lived under mine, in Christian faith and obedience to the Catholic, Apostolic, and Roman Church, building temples and observing sacraments for our salvation. How can you abandon your noble and ancient lineage, the honor of your Catholic heritage, and the religion embraced by your ancestors? By aligning with heretics—those who, abandoning God’s Church, have chosen false associations—you now become adversaries of Christ and allies of Satan. There is but one true faith, one Church, and one shepherd: the Roman Pontiff. Do you not see that false religions have sown discord, creating factions and undermining both spiritual and temporal authority? A prince must protect the Catholic faith, for without a strong religion, no empire can remain powerful. Religion and arms united ensure the survival of a monarchy for ages. Let us remember: &quot;&#x27;What is best must be honored by the best, and what rules must be served by the ruler&quot;.&#x27; Turn back to the true faith of your forebears and embrace the unity of Christ&#x27;s Church, lest you lose the peace and salvation promised to those who remain faithful.
=== Siege of Geneva ===

In 1602 Charles Emmanuel attacked the city of Geneva. On 11 December that year, he led his troops to the city during the night and they surrounded the city walls by two in the morning. The Savoyard cuirassiers were ordered to dismount and climb the city walls in full armour as a shock tactic. However, the alarm was raised by a night watchman and Geneva&#x27;s militia rose to meet the invaders.

The attempted raid was a disastrous failure, and 54 Savoyards were killed, with many more captured. Charles Emmanuel&#x27;s army retreated in a panic and the Savoyard prisoners were executed. The heavy helmets worn by Charles Emmanuel&#x27;s troops, with visors made in a stylized imitation of a human face, were known as &quot;Savoyard&quot; helmets after this notorious incident. A number of these suits of armour were captured by the Swiss and kept as trophies. The Geneva militia&#x27;s successful defence of the city&#x27;s walls is still celebrated as an act of heroism during the annual festival of &quot;L&#x27;Escalade&quot;.

=== Candidate for the Serbian crown ===
Charles Emmanuel was one of the most wanted candidates for the crown of a restored Serbian kingdom, hypothetically presumed after a Christian crusade against the Ottoman Empire during planning for the Great Conspiracy of the late 16th and early 17th centuries under the auspices of Serbian Patriarch Jovan, diplomat Damjan, Herzegovinian Duke Grdan and other chiefs of the Serb clans. At the 1608 Council of Morača, during a gathering of representatives of the Serb clans and the Serbian Church, Charles was elected &quot;King of Serbia&quot; and invited to convert to Eastern Orthodoxy (as a precondition for being crowned by Patriarch John) and to vow to protect Orthodox Christianity. The conspirators, bearing closely in mind the failures of the 1590 decade, did not want to expose themselves in any action before direct support from the West was forthcoming. Thus no broad uprising of the Balkan Christian peoples against the rule of the Ottoman Turks was sparked, as Charles Emmanuel lacked the financial resources to take the crown and restore the Serbian statehood extinguished in the 15th century.

In 1609, Charles Emmanuel came in contact with Albanian mercenaries like Giovanni Renesi, his brother Demetrio Renesi and a relative Don Joanne Renesi, who intended to revolt against the Ottomans at the Convention of Kuçi in 1614.

===Alliance with France ===

With the Treaty of Bruzolo (25 April 1610), Charles Emmanuel allied with France against Spain, but the assassination of Henry IV changed the situation, as the treaty was not recognized by Marie de&#x27; Medici, who immediately assumed the regency for Henry&#x27;s son Louis XIII, a minor. Continuing his intrigues, on the death in 1612 of Duke Francesco IV Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua who was lord of the Duchy of Montferrat, Charles Emmanuel caused the war of the Montferrat Succession by assaulting that district. This arrayed the Venetians, Tuscany, the Empire and Spain against him, and he was obliged to relinquish his conquest. Charles Emmanuel obtained the help of French troops to free Alba from the Spaniards, in January 1617, as the new king resumed his father&#x27;s alliance with Savoy. Ultimately, the conflict was solved by the treaty of Asti.

His sister Christine Marie was married to Charles Emmanuel&#x27;s son, Victor Amadeus in 1619.

In the First Genoese-Savoyard War of 1625, Charles Emmanuel tried with the help of France to obtain access to the Mediterranean Sea at the expense of Genoa. After Spanish intervention, the status-quo was restored in the Treaty of Monçon.

===War of the Mantuan Succession===

When the French occupied Casale Monferrato during the War of the Mantuan Succession in 1628, Charles Emmanuel allied again with Spain. However, when Richelieu invaded Piedmont and conquered Susa, the duke changed sides again and returned to an alliance with France. Then, after Philip IV of Spain sent two invasion forces from Genoa and Como under Ambrogio Spinola, Charles Emmanuel declared himself neutral, and in 1630 Richelieu ordered a French army to march into Savoy to force the duke to comply with the pacts. The French troops, soon backed by another army, occupied Pinerolo and Avigliana. The Savoy army under his son Victor Amadeus was defeated in Lower Valsusa.

In 1628 Giovanni Antonio Ansaldo, an agent of Charles Emmanuel, recruited and furnished with ample funds a group of Genoese conspirators led by Giulio Cesare Vachero who were to overthrow the Republic of Genoa and place the city under the protection of the Duchy of Savoy. The plot failed and Vachero and his accomplices were sentenced to death.

The duke died suddenly of a stroke, while campaigning during the second Monferrato war, at Savigliano in late July 1630. He was succeeded by his son Victor Amadeus.

== Legacy ==
Charles Emmanuel&#x27;s military campaigns ignited Italian nationalism and patriotism.

Alessandro Tassoni took up the defence of Charles Emmanuel. In quick succession he published anonymously two &quot;Filippiche&quot; addressed to the Italian nobility. He exhorted the nobles to discard their lethargy, unite and instead of fighting each other, join Savoy in ridding Italy of Spanish hegemony.

At about the same time that Tassoni was inspired to write the &quot;Filippiche&quot;, Fulvio Testi, a young poet at the court of the duke of Este, published a collection of poems dedicated to Charles Emmanuel. Not all the poems were of a patriotic nature, but those that were, clearly revealed the feelings Charles Emmanuel had stirred in freedom-loving Italians.

More than fifty years later Vittorio Siri still reminisced that “all Italy broke forth with pen and tongue in praises and panegyrics at the name of Carlo Emanuele, and in demonstrations of joy and applause that he had revived . . . the ancient Latin valor, wishing that he . . . [might] one day become the redeemer of Italy&#x27;s freedom and the restorer of its greatness.”

<text>Victor Amadeus I (; 8 May 1587 – 7 October 1637) was the Duke of Savoy and ruler of the Savoyard states from 26 July 1630 until his death in 1637. He was also known as the &quot;Lion of Susa&quot;. 

He was succeeded by two of his sons; Francis Hyacinth and Charles Emmanuel II. His male-only line became extinct in 1831 with the death of Charles Felix. Therefore, the Kings of Italy are descended from his younger brother, Thomas Francis.

==Biography==

Victor Amadeus was born in Turin, Piedmont, as the second son and child of Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy and Catherine Micaela of Spain, daughter of King Philip II of Spain. He spent much of his childhood in Madrid at the court of his grandfather Philip II. He stayed there until the king&#x27;s death in 1598, when Victor Amadeus was eleven. As the second son of the Duke, he was not expected to become Duke of Savoy. That changed when his brother, Filippo Emanuele, died in 1605, thus he became heir-apparent to the Duchy of Savoy and received the homage of the court at Racconigi on 21 January 1607.

Victor Amadeus became Duke of Savoy after his father&#x27;s death in 1630. Charles Emmanuel&#x27;s policies had brought great instability in the relationships with both France and Spain, and troops were needed to defend the Duchy. As money was lacking to recruit mercenaries or train indigenous soldiers, Victor Amadeus signed a peace treaty with Spain.

With the Treaty of Cherasco, Savoy was forced to give Pinerolo to France. This gave France a strategic route into the heart of Savoy territory and on into the rest of Italy. The rulers of Savoy from that point resented this loss and worked for decades with the goal of regaining that loss. Subsequently, under the direction of Cardinal Richelieu, Victor Amadeus attempted to create an anti-Spanish league in Italy. He achieved two victories against the Spanish: In 1636 in the Battle of Tornavento and on 8 September 1637 in the Battle of Mombaldone.

==Death==
On 25 September 1637, Victor Amadeus fell ill after a dinner offered by the Duke of Créqui. A prominent Savoyard noble (Count Augusto Manfredo Scaglia di Verrua) who attended the dinner also died in the same week, arousing suspicions of poisoning and generating uncertainty in Savoyard-French relations. The duke was carried to Vercelli, where he died on 7 October, aged 50. He was first succeeded by his elder son, Francis Hyacinth. However, Francis died the following year, and his younger son, Charles Emmanuel, became Charles Emmanuel II of Savoy.

==Marriage and issue==

In 1619, he married Christine Marie of France (1606–1663), a daughter of Henry IV of France and Marie de&#x27; Medici. Following his death, she served as regent of the Duchy from 1637 to 1663. They had children including: 
*Stillborn son (1621)
*Prince Louis Amadeus of Savoy (Turin, 24 February 1622 – Turin, 29 January 1628)
*Prince Francis Hyacinth of Savoy (Turin, 14 September 1632 – Castello del Valentino, 4 October 1638), Duke of Savoy
*Princess Luisa Cristina of Savoy (Turin, 27 July 1629 – Turin, 14 May 1692), married her uncle Prince Maurice of Savoy
*Prince Charles Emmanuel of Savoy (20 June 1634 – Palace of Venaria, 12 June 1675), Duke of Savoy; married first his first cousin Françoise Madeleine d&#x27;Orléans and had no issue; secondly married another first cousin Marie Jeanne of Savoy and had issue;
*Princess Margaret Yolande of Savoy (Turin, 15 November 1635 – Parma, 29 April 1663), married Ranuccio II Farnese, Duke of Parma; had two stillborn children; died giving birth to her last child;
*Princess Henrietta Adelaide Marie of Savoy (Turin, 6 November 1636 – Munich, 18 March 1676), married Ferdinand Maria of Wittelsbach, Elector of Bavaria and had issue
*Princess Catherine Beatrice of Savoy (Turin, 6 November 1636 – Turin, 26 August 1637) twin of the above

<text>Francis Hyacinth (; 14 September 1632 – 4 October 1638) was Duke of Savoy and ruler of the Savoyard states under the regency of his mother Christine Marie.

==Biography==

Born at the Castle of Valentino in Turin he was the eldest surviving son of Victor Amadeus I, Duke of Savoy and his wife Christine Marie of France. As the heir to the Savoyard throne, he was styled as the Prince of Piedmont. His parents had another son who had died in 1628 before the birth of Francis Hyacinth.

<text>Charles Emmanuel II (); 20 June 1634 – 12 June 1675) was Duke of Savoy and ruler of the Savoyard states from 4 October 1638 until his death in 1675 and under regency of his mother Christine of France until 1648. He was also Marquis of Saluzzo, Count of Aosta, Geneva, Moriana and Nice, as well as claimant king of Cyprus, Jerusalem and Armenia. At his death in 1675, his second wife Marie Jeanne Baptiste of Savoy-Nemours acted as regent for their 9-year-old son.

==Biography==
He was born in Turin to Victor Amadeus I, Duke of Savoy, and Christine of France. His maternal grandparents were Henry IV of France and his second wife Marie de&#x27; Medici. In 1638 at the death of his older brother Francis Hyacinth, Duke of Savoy, Charles Emmanuel succeeded to the duchy of Savoy at the age of 4. His mother governed in his place, and even after reaching adulthood in 1648, he invited her to continue to rule. Charles Emmanuel continued a life of pleasure, far away from the affairs of state.

He became notorious for his persecution of the Vaudois (Waldensians) culminating in the massacre of 1655, known as Piedmontese Easter. The massacre was so brutal that it prompted the English poet John Milton to write the sonnet &quot;On the Late Massacre in Piedmont&quot;. Oliver Cromwell, Lord Protector, called for a general fast in England and proposed to send the British Navy if the massacre was not stopped while gathering funds for helping the Waldensians. Sir Samuel Morland was commissioned with that task. He later wrote &quot;The History of the Evangelical Churches of the Valleys of Piemont&quot; (1658). The 1655 massacre was only the beginning of a series of conflicts, the Savoyard–Waldensian wars (1655–1690), that saw Waldensian rebels use guerrilla warfare tactics against ducal military campaigns to enforce Roman Catholicism upon the entire population.

Only after the death of his mother in 1663, did he really assume power. He was not successful in gaining a passage to the sea at the expense of Genoa (Second Genoese–Savoyard War, 1672–1673), and had difficulties in retaining the influence of his powerful neighbour France.

But he greatly improved commerce and wealth in the Duchy, developing the port of Nice and building a road through the Alps towards France. He also reformed the army, which until then was mostly composed of mercenaries: he formed instead five Piedmontese regiments and recreated cavalry, as well as introducing uniforms. He also restored fortifications. He constructed many beautiful buildings in Turin, for instance, the Palazzo Reale.

He died on 12 June 1675, leaving his second wife as regent for his son. He is buried at Turin Cathedral.

==Marriages and issue==

Charles Emmanuel first met Marie Jeanne of Savoy in 1659 and fell in love with her. However, his mother disagreed with the pairing, and encouraged him to marry Françoise Madeleine d&#x27;Orléans, daughter of his maternal uncle Gaston, Duke of Orléans, the younger brother of his mother Christine Marie. They were married on 3 April 1663. The couple had no issue. His mother died at the end of 1663, and his first wife died at the start of 1664. This left him free to get married on 20 May 1665 to Marie Jeanne of Savoy. They had one son:

* Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia (1666–1732), future King of Sicily and later Sardinia; married Anne Marie d&#x27;Orléans and had issue; had illegitimate issue also; married Anna Canalis di Cumiana in a morganatic marriage

From his relationship with Jeanne Marie Benso ( de Trécesson), Marchioness of Cavour (the wife of Maurizio Pompilio Benso, Marquess of Cavour), he had a daughter, Cristina Ippolita of Savoy (1655–1730), who married Carlo Besso Ferrero Fieschi, 4th Prince of Masserano.

<doc id="69541" wikidata="Q209579" url="?curid=69541" title="Victor Amadeus II">
<text>Victor Amadeus II (Vittorio Amedeo Francesco; 14 May 166631 October 1732) was the head of the House of Savoy and ruler of the Savoyard states from 12 June 1675 until his abdication in 1730. He was the first of his house to acquire a royal crown, ruling first as King of Sicily (1713–1720) and then as King of Sardinia (1720–1730). Among his other titles were Duke of Savoy, Duke of Montferrat, Prince of Piedmont, Marquis of Saluzzo and Count of Aosta, Maurienne and Nice.

Louis XIV arranged his marriage in order to maintain French influence in Savoy, but Victor Amadeus soon broke away from the influence of France. At his father&#x27;s death in 1675, his mother, Marie Jeanne Baptiste of Nemours, was regent in the name of her nine-year-old son and would remain in &quot;de facto&quot; power until 1684 when Victor Amadeus banished her further involvement in the state. Having fought in the War of the Spanish Succession, he was rewarded with the Kingdom of Sicily in 1713, but he was forced to exchange this title for the poorer Kingdom of Sardinia in 1720.

Reigning for over 55 years, he is the longest-reigning monarch in Savoyard history, surpassing Charles Emmanuel I. Victor Amadeus left a considerable cultural influence in Turin, remodeling the Royal Palace of Turin, Palace of Venaria, Palazzina di caccia of Stupinigi, as well as building the Basilica of Superga where he rests.

==Infancy and regency==
 Victor Amadeus was born in Turin to Charles Emmanuel II, Duke of Savoy and his second wife Marie Jeanne Baptiste of Nemours. Named after his paternal grandfather Victor Amadeus I he was their only child. As an infant he was styled as the &quot;Prince of Piedmont&quot;, traditional title of the heir apparent to the duchy of Savoy. A weak child, his health was greatly monitored. As an infant he had a passion for soldiers and was noted as being very intelligent.

His father died in June 1675 in Turin at the age of forty after a series of convulsive fevers. His mother was declared Regent of Savoy and, known as &quot;Madame Royale&quot; at court, took power. In 1677, during her regency, she tried to arrange a marriage between Victor Amadeus and his first cousin Infanta Isabel Luísa of Portugal, the presumptive heiress of her father, Peter II and Victor Amadeus&#x27; aunt. His mother urged him to agree to the marriage, as this would have left Marie Jeanne permanently in control of the Duchy of Savoy as Regent because her son would have had to live in Portugal with his new wife. The duchy would then revert to the Kingdom of Portugal at her death. Victor Amadeus refused, and a party was even formed which refused to recognise his leaving Savoy. Despite a marriage contract being signed between Portugal and Savoy on 15 May 1679, the marriage between Victor Amadeus and the Infanta came to nothing and was thus cancelled.

Other candidates included Maria Antonia of Austria, Countess Palatine of Neuburg and Anna Maria Luisa de&#x27; Medici. Victor Amadeus was keen on the match with Tuscany and negotiations were kept secret from France even though the match never happened. Under the influence of Louis XIV and Marie Jeanne, Victor Amadeus was forced to marry a French princess Anne Marie d&#x27;Orléans. His mother was keen on the match and had always promoted French interests having been born in Paris a member of a cadet branch of the House of Savoy. He asked for Anne Marie&#x27;s hand in March 1684, Victor Amadeus, who had been using political allies to gain support to end his mother&#x27;s grip on power, succeeded in 1684 when she was banished from further influence in the state.

===Salt wars===
A significant event of his mother&#x27;s regency was the &quot;Salt Wars&quot; of 1680. These rebellions were caused by the unpopular taxes on salt in all cities in Savoy. The system had been put in place by Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy to raise money for the crown. The annual payment of a tax which had been in place for over 100 years caused great discontent and rebellion finally broke out in Mondovì, where the people refused to pay taxes to the emissary of Savoy, Andrea Cantatore di Breo. The unrest caused an army to be sent to stop the unrest in the town, which was pacified quickly. However, in the town of Montaldo, the unrest began again and was more serious than before. 200 soldiers were killed in warfare which lasted for several days.

The news of these rebellions soon reached a wider scope and it became clear that soon the whole of Piedmont was on the verge of revolt. Power at this point still being with Victor Amadeus&#x27; mother, she ordered representatives of the town of Mondovì to go to Turin to conclude treaties and were cordially welcomed by the young Victor Amadeus, who agreed to the treaties. The event had allowed Victor Amadeus a chance to exert some power.

==Duke of Savoy==

Having succeeded in ending his mother&#x27;s power in Savoy, Victor Amadeus looked to his oncoming marriage with the youngest child of Philippe I, Duke of Orléans (brother of Louis XIV) and Henrietta of England. The contract of marriage between Anne Marie and the Duke of Savoy was signed at Versailles on 9 April; On 10 April 1684, Anne Marie was married at Versailles, by proxy, to Victor Amadeus. The couple were married in person on 6 May 1684.

===The Vaudois===

At the urging of Louis, Victor Amadeus II began a large-scale persecution of the Vaudois (Piedmontese and Savoyard Protestants) in 1685. The state had been bankrupted due to various conflicts and a famine in 1679 which had used all last resources. Due to his alliances with England and the Dutch Republic during the Nine Years&#x27; War, he was forced to cease this practice from 1688, and in 1694 granted an Edict of Toleration. However, in 1698 Louis XIV forced him to expel all Protestant immigrants from Savoy in accordance with a treaty of 1696.

During this period he became anxious to free himself of domination by Louis, and his first sign of independence was his independent visit to Venice in 1687, where he conferred with Prince Eugene of Savoy and others. Louis discovered this and demanded that Victor Amadeus launch another expedition against the Vaudois; he grudgingly complied, but as described below soon chose the allies countering France.

===Internal reforms===

Victor Amadeus II undertook sweeping administrative reforms within Savoy. In 1696 he established a system of intendants, based on the French model, responsible for collecting taxes and law enforcement. In 1697 he began a land survey which was largely completed by 1711, the Perequazione, to examine the land holdings and privileges of the Church and nobility. In 1717 he reformed the secretariat system in Turin establishing individual secretaries for war, internal affairs and foreign affairs. From the 1670s he also had a new administrative zone built in Turin, around the ducal palace. This zone included a military academy, the ministry of war, a mint, and a customs house. This work was still ongoing upon his death.

Victor Amadeus also undertook a number of military reforms. Often when one of his key fortresses was under attack, he would replace its commanding officer with one of his most reliable and trusted leaders. In 1690 he established a select militia within his territories, and he later overhauled the militia system in 1714 and strictly codified it. This included an obligation for each region under his rule to provide some men for the militia based on population. From 1713 he also began to establish his own navy based on the limited Sicilian naval forces he had been granted.

Victor Amadeus was able to use the experienced armies he developed in foreign wars to establish more firm control within his territories. Faced with rebellion by Mondovì at the end of the century, he brought a force of veterans from the Nine Years War there and re-established his authority. He employed a similar strategy against an anti-tax riot in Cigliano in 1724.

==Foreign affairs==
Under his mother&#x27;s regency Savoy, despite being a state of the Holy Roman Empire, was closely linked to and heavily dependent upon France, essentially becoming a French satellite. Victor Amadeus II broke this link by joining alliances against France in both the Nine Years&#x27; War and the War of the Spanish Succession. Savoy was considered a valuable ally in both wars due to its geographical position, enabling a second front to be opened against France in the south. Savoy relied heavily on foreign subsidies, particularly from England and the Dutch Republic, in both wars to maintain its armies.

===Nine Year&#x27; War===

At the start of the Nine Years&#x27; War, Savoy had three regiments in the service of France in Flanders. Victor Amadeus struggled throughout the early part of the war to bring those troops back to his own use. Part of the agreement he reached with the Grand Alliance against France was that they would enable him to recover Pinerolo, which his predecessor and namesake had lost decades before. In 1692, he was the only member of the Grand Alliance to bring the war to French lands, invading the Dauphiné. In 1695 and 1696, he secretly negotiated a separate treaty with Louis XIV of France which included the return of Pinerolo to Savoy. Throughout the war, he greatly increased the size of the army of Savoy from about 8,500 to more than 24,000.

===War of the Spanish Succession===
During the War of the Spanish Succession, foreign subsidies amounted to almost half of the revenue raised by Savoy to fight the war. The end of the Nine Years&#x27; War had helped to design a new balance on the continent: at the death of the childless Charles II of Spain he left his throne to Philip, grandson of Louis XIV. The will stated that should Philip not accept it would go to his brother Charles. Victor Amadeus was himself in line to succeed, as a great-grandson of Infanta Catherine Michaela of Spain. As a result, Victor Amadeus expected compensation in the form of a territory which had been owned by the vast Spanish empire. Victor Amadeus had his eye on the Duchy of Milan which, having signed a treaty with Louis XIV, had support in conquering the duchy. With the Treaty of Vigevano in October 1696, however, Louis XIV&#x27;s support waned. Victor Amadeus subsequently allied himself with Emperor Leopold I.

England and Austria ignored his claim, the latter of which had a candidate in the person of Archduke Charles, who immediately proclaimed himself King of Spain. The Grand Duke of Tuscany also ignored his claims. In the meantime, he pursued the expansion of Savoy and bought various fiefdoms of the Holy Roman Empire.

Victor Amadeus was in a position where on most sides of Savoy was a Bourbon ruler, the enemy of Philip V, and he was forced to let French troops enter his lands in order to get Milan which Victor Amadeus had wanted so greatly. Forced to ally himself again this time with Louis XIV and his grandson in Spain, his daughter Maria Luisa was used as a pawn to seal this alliance. His daughter subsequently married Philip V in 1701. In 1701, he fought bravely at the Battle of Chiari, fought in the name of Bourbon control of Milan. By 1702, Victor Amadeus was considering changing allegiance to the emperor again having entered secret correspondence with the emperor who promised him the Duchy of Montferrat. In order to appease him, the emperor increased his bribe, adding various territories in Lombardy, Victor Amadeus having ignored him.

In 1703, Victor Amadeus switched sides, joining the Grand Alliance as he had in the Nine Years&#x27; War. Savoy fared particularly badly against the larger French forces resulting in a siege of Turin in 1706. Anne Marie&#x27;s uncle, Louis XIV (along with Spanish forces from Anne Marie&#x27;s second cousin Philip V of Spain), besieged Turin during the &quot;Battle of Turin&quot;. French troops were under the control of Anne Marie&#x27;s half-brother, the Duke of Orléans. She and her sons were forced to flee Turin with the grandmother for the safety of Genoa. Turin was saved by the combined forces of Victor Amadeus and Prince Eugene of Savoy in September 1706.

==King of Sicily==

As a result of his aid in the War of the Spanish Succession, Victor Amadeus II gained the Kingdom of Sicily in 1713 under the Treaty of Utrecht which ended the war. Being crowned King of Sicily in Palermo on 24 December 1713, he returned to Turin in September 1714. 

As ruler of an independent kingdom and a key player in the recent war, Victor Amadeus significantly expanded his foreign relations. As a duke, he had envoys and embassies in France, the Empire, and Rome. In 1717, he established his own foreign office.

==King of Sardinia==
Victor Amadeus in 1720 was forced to exchange Sicily for the less important kingdom of Sardinia after objections from an alliance of four nations, including several of his former allies. The duke was a marquis, prince and perpetual vicar in the Holy Roman Empire.

===Abdication and later years===

Having done much to improve the state of his inheritance in 1684, Victor Amadeus decided abdicate in September 1730. The lonely king had lost most of his family, including his favourite and eldest son the Prince of Piedmont, and sought the security of a previous mistress Anna Canalis di Cumiana. The couple were married in a private ceremony on 12 August 1730 in the Royal Chapel in Turin having obtained permission from Pope Clement XII. Still attractive in her forties, Victor Amadeus had long been in love with her and as a wedding gift, created her the Marchioness of Spigno. The couple made their marriage public on 3 September 1730 much to the dismay of the court. A month later, Victor Amadeus announced his wish to abdicate the throne and did so in a ceremony at the Castle of Rivoli on the day of his marriage. His son succeeded him as Charles Emmanuel III.

Taking the style of &quot;King Victor Amadeus&quot;, he and Anna moved into the château de Chambéry outside the capital. The couple took a small retinue of servants and Victor Amadeus was kept informed of matters of state. He insisted on having a Louis XIV-style wig with him at all times as his only luxury.

Under the influence of Anna, in 1731 having suffered a stroke, Victor Amadeus decided he wanted to resume his tenure on the throne and informed his son of his decision. Arrested by his son, he was transported to the Castle of Moncalieri and Anna was taken to a house for reformed prostitutes at the Castle of Ceva but was later allowed to return to the Castle of Rivoli where her husband was moved. She was returned to him on 12 April. The stroke seemed to have affected Victor Amadeus in a way which caused him to later turn violent towards his wife, blaming her for his misfortunes.

King Victor Amadeus died on 31 October 1732 and was buried in the Convent of San Giuseppe di Carignano. His son decided not to bury him in the Basilica of Superga which Victor Amadeus had built and where he asked to be buried, as his son did not want to remind the public of the scandal which his abdication had caused. Anna was moved to the Convent of the Visitation in Pinerolo where she died aged 88.

==Cultural legacy==
Despite his political reforms and his passion for trying to increase the importance of Savoy in Europe, Victor Amadeus left a considerable cultural legacy in the city of his birth. In 1697 Victor Amadeus commissioned Le Notre to lay out large gardens at the Palace of Turin where he had previously commissioned the Viennese Daniel Seiter to paint a famous gallery which exists to this day. Victor Amadeus subsequently had Seiter knighted. He also encouraged musical patronage in Savoy and the court became a centre for various musicians of the period.

Being crowned King of Sicily in Palermo on 24 December 1713, he returned to Turin in September 1714. From Palermo he brought back Filippo Juvarra, an Italian architect who had spent many years in Rome. Juvarra was patronised by Victor Amadeus and was the mind behind the remodelling of the Royal Palace of Turin, Palace of Venaria, Palazzina di caccia of Stupinigi as well as building the Basilica of Superga. The architect was also responsible for various roads and piazzas in Turin. Victor Amadeus&#x27; mother also used Juvarra for the famous staircase within the Palazzo Madama where she lived after being banished.

In 1997 the UNESCO added a group of buildings which were connected to Victor Amadeus and his family to be added to have World Heritage status. These buildings including the Royal Palace, the Palazzo Madama, the Palazzina di caccia of Stupinigi and his wife&#x27;s Villa della Regina were grouped as the Residences of the Royal House of Savoy.

==Family and issue==
His distant relationship with his mother was always strained and has been blamed on her ambition to keep power to herself. Marie Jeanne spent most of her time relegated to state business which she enjoyed and had little time for her only child whom she kept under close supervision in order to make sure he would not try to assume power. Anne Marie gave her husband six children but also had two stillbirths of each gender, one in 1691 and again in 1697. Three of these children would go on to have further progeny, including the eldest Maria Adelaide, who was the mother of Louis XV of France. His second daughter Maria Luisa, known in the family as &quot;Louison&quot;, would marry Philip V of Spain in 1701 and was also regent of Spain for various periods. These two marriages were tactics used by Louis XIV to keep Victor Amadeus close to France prior to the War of the Spanish Succession.

Anne Marie would remain a devoted wife. She quietly accepted his extramarital affairs; the longest one being with the famed beauty Jeanne Baptiste d&#x27;Albert de Luynes by whom he had two children. Jeanne Baptiste was his mistress for eleven years and eventually fled Savoy due to Victor Amadeus&#x27; obsession with her. Victor Amadeus subsequently had his daughter with Jeanne Baptiste, Maria Vittoria, marry the Prince of Carignano from which the present Vittorio Emanuele, Prince of Naples is a direct descendant. His favourite child was Victor Amadeus born in 1699 and given the title Prince of Piedmont as heir apparent. The Prince of Piedmont later died in 1715 from smallpox. Anne Marie died in 1728 after a series of heart attacks.

His relationship with his younger son and eventual successor Charles Emmanuel was a cold one and the two were never close. Victor Amadeus organised the first two marriages of Charles Emmanuel, the first one being to Anne Christine of Sulzbach, daughter of the Count Palatine of Sulzbach, which produced a son who died in infancy. The second marriage was to Polyxena of Hesse-Rotenburg, a first cousin of Anne Christine and mother of six children, including the future Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia.

<text>Charles Emmanuel III (27 April 1701 – 20 February 1773) was Duke of Savoy, King of Sardinia and ruler of the Savoyard states from his father&#x27;s adbication on 3 September 1730 until his death in 1773. He was the paternal grandfather of the last three mainline kings of Sardinia.

==Biography==
=== Early life ===
Charles Emmanuel was born in Turin to Victor Amadeus II of Savoy and his first wife the French Anne Marie d&#x27;Orléans. His maternal grandparents were Prince Philippe of France and his first wife Princess Henrietta, the youngest daughter of Charles I of England and Henrietta Maria of France. Charles Emmanuel was the oldest surviving brother of Princess Maria Adelaide of Savoy – the mother of Louis XV of France; he was also the brother of Maria Luisa of Savoy, Queen of Spain as wife Philip V of Spain.

At the time of his birth, when he was known as Duke of Aosta, Charles Emmanuel was not the heir to Savoy; his older brother Victor Amadeus, Prince of Piedmont, was the heir apparent. Charles Emmanuel was the second of three sons that would be born to his parents. His older brother died in 1715 and Charles Emmanuel then became heir apparent.

As a result of his aid in the War of the Spanish Succession, Victor Amadeus II was made king of Sicily in 1713 under the Treaty of Utrecht which ended the war. Victor Amadeus was forced to exchange Sicily for the less important Kingdom of Sardinia in 1720 after objections from an alliance of four nations, including some of his former allies.

On 3 September 1730, Victor Amadeus who, in his later years had exhibited reticence and melancholy, abdicated the throne and retired from the royal court. His son became King Charles Emanuel III. He had not been a favorite of his father&#x27;s, who had neglected his education except on the military field, where the son had sometimes accompanied the father.

After some time spent at his residence in Chambéry, however, the former king started to intervene in his son&#x27;s government. Victor Amadeus reclaimed the throne, accusing his son of incompetence. He established himself in Moncalieri, but Charles Emmanuel managed to have the former king arrested by the Crown Council, in order to prevent him from attacking Milan and probably causing an invasion of Piedmont. Victor Amadeus was then confined to the Castle of Rivoli, where he later died without further interference with his son&#x27;s regime.

===The War of Polish Succession===
In the War of the Polish Succession Charles Emmanuel sided with the French-backed king Stanislaw I. After the treaty of alliance signed in Turin, on 28 October 1733, he marched on Milan and occupied Lombardy without significant losses. However, when France tried to convince Philip V of Spain to join the coalition, he asked to receive Milan and Mantua in exchange. This was not acceptable for Charles Emmanuel, as it would recreate a Spanish domination in Italy as it had been in the previous centuries. While negotiations continued about the matter, the Savoy-French-Spanish troops attacked Mantua under the supreme command of Charles Emmanuel himself.

Sure that in the end Mantua would be assigned to Spain, he voluntarily thwarted the expedition. The Franco-Piedmontese army was victorious in two battles at Crocetta and Guastalla. In the end, when Austria and France signed a peace, Charles was forced to leave Lombardy. In exchange, he was given some territories, including Langhe, Tortona and Novara.

===War of the Austrian Succession===

Charles Emmanuel sided with Maria Theresa of Austria in the War of the Austrian Succession, receiving financial and naval support from Great Britain and the Dutch Republic. After noteworthy but inconclusive initial successes, he had to face the French-Spanish invasion of Savoy and, after a failed allied attempt to conquer the Kingdom of Naples, the County of Nice. When the enemy army invaded Piedmont, in 1744 he defended Cuneo against the Spanish-French besiegers. The following year, with some 20,000 men, he was faced with an invasion of two armies with a total of some 60,000 troops. The important strongholds of Alessandria, Asti and Casale fell. In 1746, after receiving reinforcements from Austria, he was able to recapture Alessandria and Asti. In 1747, he obtained a crushing victory over the French at the Battle of Assietta, and his territories were saved when the main battleground moved northwards to the Netherlands.

The outcome was the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, which revealed his qualities as a negotiator, in as much as he both regained the lost provinces of Nice and Savoy, and obtained Vigevano as well as other lands in the Pianura Padana. Ties with Spain were re-established with the marriage of his son Prince Victor Amadeus to the Infanta Maria Antonia Ferdinanda of Spain in 1750.

He declined to participate in the Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–63), preferring to concentrate on administrative reforms, maintaining a well-disciplined army and strengthening his fortresses. In an attempt to improve the poor condition of the newly acquired Sardinia, he also restored the Universities of Sassari and Cagliari.

Charles Emmanuel died in Turin in 1773. He was buried in the Basilica of Superga.

==Art collector==
Charles Emmanuel&#x27;s ancestors were avid art collectors. He added many new paintings to the collection he inherited from his ancestors. He also received paintings from the collection of Prince Eugene of Savoy who had remained childless. The collection contained many works of Flemish and Dutch painters. As a result, the Sabauda Gallery in Turin was the largest collection in Italy of 16th and 17th-century Flemish and Dutch paintings. In 1731 he established a tapestry workshop in Turin. The Flemish battle painter Jan Peeter Verdussen was his court painter and painted many of his military victories.

==Marriages and issue==
Charles Emmanuel married three times, but all of his three wives died young. There were plans for him to marry his cousin Charlotte Aglaé d&#x27;Orléans, but his mother declined the offer. Amalia d&#x27;Este, daughter of Rinaldo, Duke of Modena, and Infanta Francisca Josefa of Portugal, daughter of Pedro II of Portugal, were also candidates.

<text>Kalgoorlie is a city in the Goldfields–Esperance region of Western Australia, located east-northeast of Perth at the end of the Great Eastern Highway. It is sometimes referred to as Kalgoorlie–Boulder, as the surrounding urban area includes the historic townsite of Boulder and the local government area is the City of Kalgoorlie–Boulder.

Kalgoorlie–Boulder lies on the traditional lands of the Wangkatja group of peoples. The name &quot;Kalgoorlie&quot; is derived from the Wangai word &quot;Karlkurla&quot; or &quot;Kulgooluh&quot;, meaning &quot;place of the silky pears&quot;. The city was established in 1893 during the Western Australian gold rushes. It soon replaced Coolgardie as the largest settlement on the Eastern Goldfields. Kalgoorlie is the ultimate destination of the Goldfields Water Supply Scheme and the Golden Pipeline Heritage Trail. The nearby Super Pit gold mine was Australia&#x27;s largest open-cut gold mine for many years.

During August 2021, Kalgoorlie–Boulder had an estimated urban population of 29,072, a slight decline from the recent peak of 32,966 in 2013.

==History==
Kalgoorlie–Boulder lies on the traditional lands of the Wangkatja people. Languages including Wangkatja, part of the Wati language family, continue to be spoken there today.

In the winter of 1893, prospectors Patrick (Paddy) Hannan, Tom Flanagan, and Dan Shea were travelling to Mount Youle, when one of their horses cast a shoe. During the halt in their journey, the men noticed signs of gold in the area around the foot of what is now the Mount Charlotte gold mine, located on a small hill north of the current city, and decided to stay and investigate. On 17 June 1893, Hannan filed a Reward Claim, leading to hundreds of men swarming to the area in search of gold, and Kalgoorlie, originally called Hannan&#x27;s Find, was born.

During the ensuing gold rush, significant deposits of calaverite were discovered, but ignored as it was believed at the time that this was a mineral akin to fool&#x27;s gold. The calaverite was subsequently used for construction in the town, including for buildings and paving. When it was realised in 1896 that calaverite is a compound of tellurium with actual gold, there was a rush to demolish any such structures in order to extract the gold therein. Nearly every structure created in the previous three years was scrapped in the process.

The population of the town was 2,018 (1,516 males and 502 females) in 1898.

The mining of gold, along with other metals such as nickel, has been a major industry in Kalgoorlie ever since, and today employs about one-quarter of Kalgoorlie&#x27;s workforce and generates a significant proportion of its income. The concentrated area of large gold mines surrounding the original Hannan&#x27;s find is often referred to as the Golden Mile, and was sometimes referred to as the world&#x27;s richest square mile of earth.In 1901, the population of Kalgoorlie was 4,793 (3,087 males and 1,706 females) which increased to 6,790 (3,904 males and 2,886 females) by 1903.

The narrow-gauge Government Eastern Goldfields Railway line reached Kalgoorlie station in 1896, and the main named railway service from Perth was the overnight sleeper train &quot;The Westland&quot;, which ran until the 1970s. In 1917, a railway line was completed, connecting Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta, South Australia, across of desert, and consequently the rest of the eastern states. The standardisation of the railway connecting Perth (which changed route from the narrow-gauge route) in 1968 completed the Sydney–Perth railway, making rail travel from Perth to Sydney possible; the &quot;Indian Pacific&quot; rail service commenced soon after. During the 1890s, the Goldfields area boomed as a whole, with an area population exceeding 200,000, composed mainly of prospectors. The area gained a reputation for being a &quot;wild west&quot;, notorious for its bandits and prostitutes. This rapid increase in population and claims of neglect by the state government in Perth led to the proposition of the new state of Auralia, but with the sudden diaspora after the Gold Rush, these plans fell through.

Places, famous or infamous, for which Kalgoorlie is noted include its water pipeline, designed by C. Y. O&#x27;Connor and bringing in fresh water from Mundaring Weir near Perth, its Hay Street brothels, its two-up school, the goldfields railway loopline, the Kalgoorlie Town Hall, the Paddy Hannan statue/drinking fountain, the Super Pit, and Mount Charlotte lookout. Its main street is Hannan Street, named after the town&#x27;s founder. One of the infamous brothels also serves as a museum and is a major national attraction.

Kalgoorlie and the surrounding district were served by an extensive collection of suburban railways and tramways, providing for both passenger and freight traffic.

In 1989, the Town of Kalgoorlie and Shire of Boulder formally amalgamated to create the City of Kalgoorlie–Boulder, adjoining the two towns into what is now the fifth most populous city in Western Australia.

On 20 April 2010, Kalgoorlie was shaken by an earthquake that reached 5.0 on the Richter scale. The epicentre was 30 km north east of the town. The quake caused damage to a number of commercial hotels and historic buildings along Burt Street in Boulder. The entire Burt St. precinct was evacuated until 23 April. Work in the Superpit and many other mines around Kalgoorlie was stopped. Two people suffered minor injuries as a result of the quake.

== Population ==
According to the 2021 census, there were 29,072 people in the Kalgoorlie–Boulder Significant Urban Area:
* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 7.7% of the population. 
* 66.6% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were New Zealand (7.0%), Philippines (2.6%), England (2.2%), South Africa (1.8%) and India (1.3%). 
* 76.2% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Afrikaans (1.1%), Tagalog (1.1%), Filipino (1.0%), Mandarin (0.7%) and Shona (0.6%). 
* The most common responses for religion were No Religion (44.3%) and Catholic (18.1%).

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===
Kalgoorlie has a hot semi-arid climate (&quot;BSh&quot;) bordering both a hot desert climate (&quot;BWh&quot;) and a cool semi-arid climate (&quot;BSk&quot;) with hot summers and mild winters. The average annual rainfall is on an average of 68 days and, while the average rainfall is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year, there is considerable variation from year to year.

January is the hottest month, with an average maximum temperature of , but temperatures above occur nearly once a week when hot, dry, north to northeasterly winds arrive. Such high temperatures are usually followed by a cool change from the south, and occasionally with a thunderstorm.

By contrast, winters are cool, with July average maximum and minimum temperatures being and , respectively. Cold, wet days with a maximum below occur about once every winter. The lowest maximum temperature recorded is , on 19 July 1961. Overnight temperatures fall below freezing about four times in a typical winter. Such events occur on clear nights following a day of cold southerly winds.

==Industry and commerce==

Kalgoorlie–Boulder is a regional centre and has a Chamber of Commerce and a Chamber of Minerals and Energy.

===Mining===
Since 1992, Kalgoorlie has been home to the Diggers &amp; Dealers conference, held annually in August. It is Australia&#x27;s premier international mining conference.

The Fimiston Open Pit (Super Pit) is an open-cut gold mine about long, wide, and over deep. Originally consisting of a large number of underground mines, including the Paringa, Oroya, Brown Hill, Chaffers, and Hainault mines, they were consolidated into a single open pit mine in 1989. A visitor centre overlooks the mine, which operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The mine blasts at 1:00 pm every day, unless winds would carry dust over the town. Each of the massive trucks carries 225 tonnes of rock and the round trip takes about 35 minutes, most of that time being the slow uphill haul. Employees must live in Kalgoorlie; there&#x27;s no fly-in, fly-out operation. The current life of mine plan covers operation until 2035, with investigations for mine extension ongoing.

===Sex work===
Kalgoorlie once had a thriving sex industry, with parts of Hay Street once being considered Kalgoorlie&#x27;s red-light district. Originally, brothels were only allowed to operate in Hay Street. While there were once a number of brothels in Kalgoorlie, this has since decreased.

Prostitutes from all over the world moved to Kalgoorlie for employment in the town&#x27;s sex work industry.

Today, only one brothel remains in Kalgoorlie: Questa Casa (Italian for &quot;This House&quot;; locally known as the &quot;Pink House&quot;). Questa Casa claims to be Australia&#x27;s oldest operating brothel, having begun operations in 1904. Questa Casa now only employs two sex workers, but also serves as an adult tourist attraction.

The demise of the red light district has largely been attributed to the rescinding of the &quot;Containment Policy&quot; in 1994. The &quot;Containment Policy&quot; was an informal policy that restricted all sex work in Kalgoorlie to one street: Hay Street. Nevertheless, &quot;skimpy barmaids&quot; (female bartenders who wear sexually provocative clothing, usually flying into Kalgoorlie from elsewhere) are known to occasionally sell sex.

==Culture==

Kalgoorlie–Boulder has a dynamic and diverse cultural scene.

===Arts===
Kalgoorlie–Boulder has many arts organisations and practising artists.

===Sports===
Kalgoorlie–Boulder&#x27;s location, being roughly 600 km from Perth, enjoys high levels of participation in Australian rules football (the Goldfields Football League), netball, basketball, rugby league, soccer, field hockey, and cricket. Other popular sports in Kalgoorlie include tennis, lawn bowls, roller derby, rugby union, and swimming.

Kalgoorlie also has an international squash tournament held every year at the YMCA.

In a statewide sense, the semiprofessional Goldfields Giants basketball team competes in the State Basketball League, and were league champions in 2007 and 2008.

The Goldfields Titans play in the Western Australia Rugby League Harvey Norman Premiership state rugby league competition. Home games are at the Oasis playing fields on Saturday afternoons.

Horse racing is also very popular in the city, and Kalgoorlie–Boulder is home to the internationally recognised annual &quot;Race Round&quot;.

Every year the annual Kalgoorlie Desert Race is held. It is a gruelling off-road race.

===Attractions===

Given the wealth of its yesteryear, Kalgoorlie features many elaborate heritage buildings that have been retained. Kalgoorlie–Boulder – the largest settlement for many hundreds of kilometres, with many employees at the Super Pit – is the centre of the area&#x27;s social life. Of particular interest is the Kalgoorlie–Boulder Racecourse, a horse racing venue. Two grass sports ovals and a cinema showing recent international releases are in the area.

Well known in the area are the Kalgoorlie,&lt;ref name=&quot;griffithreview/kalgoorlie&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Geraldton,&lt;ref name=&quot;geraldtonguardian/skimpy&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Perth,&lt;ref name=&quot;independent/skimpy-cover&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and Albany&lt;ref name=&quot;albanyadvertiser/skimpies&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; skimpy barmaids,&lt;ref name=&quot;thewest/kalgoorlie-too-skimpy&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; mostly flown in,&lt;ref name=&quot;smh/skimpy-debate&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; employed by pubs like Exchange Hotel,&lt;ref name=&quot;watoday/overpriced-kalgoorlie&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; who walk around &quot;scantily clad&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nzherald/skimpies-return&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; in bikini, lingerie&lt;ref name=&quot;theguardian/skimpies-nights&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; or burlesque outfits to attract punters and who expect a fee&lt;ref name=&quot;time/Treasure&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; in return.

==Suburbs==
The Kalgoorlie–Boulder metropolitan area consists of the following suburbs:

* Boulder

Known as the home of the Super Pit, it is one of Kalgoorlie–Boulder&#x27;s historical suburbs featuring many buildings and landmarks dating as far back as 1882. It was once the central business district for the Town of Boulder, but since amalgamation with Kalgoorlie, it is now more of a historical local centre. Boulder has its own post office, town hall and many hotels along its main thoroughfare, Burt Street. A significant refurbishment has been commenced as part of the &#x27;Royalties for Regions&#x27; initiative.
* Broadwood (aka – Hampton Heights)
A new housing suburb located next to the Kalgoorlie–Boulder Airport, which was recently expanded.
* Fairways
This area derives its name from the golf course that once occupied the area. It was released to provide affordable property to a growing population in Kalgoorlie–Boulder. Fairways features a private primary school, church, caravan park and small business.
* Golden Grove (formerly Adeline)
Adeline was originally constructed around 1970 by the State Housing Commission. The suburb was built on the &quot;Radburn concept&quot;, with houses facing away from the street and common pathways linking homes. The area has been plagued by antisocial problems. In 2003, a significant urban renewal project was commenced, including the renaming of the suburb to &quot;Golden Grove&quot; and re-aligning of homes. The project has seen some success but has yet to fully eliminate antisocial problems within the area.
* Hampton Heights
See Broadwood.
* Hannans

Located in Kalgoorlie&#x27;s far north. Hannans was the first suburb to have its own independent shopping centre (&quot;Hannans Boulevard&quot;) which includes a IGA SuperMarket (formally Coles supermarket). The area also has a primary school and an 18-hole golf course. The original course was not formally grassed but was recently refurbished. Several surrounding golf clubs joined together to form one club known as &#x27;The Goldfields Golf Club&#x27;. A dam has been constructed to service what is now a luxury desert golf course and club. Alongside the golf course project has been the development and release of Greenview estate. It lies on the western border of Hannans. This ongoing project has been designed as an environmentally friendly estate, and will eventually consist of over 2000 homes, apartments and facilities such as parks and schools. As one of Kalgoorlie&#x27;s highest growth areas there has been a proposal for a new alternative route, out of the suburb onto the Kalgoorlie Bypass, to avoid traffic problems on the already heavily used Graeme Street which is a direct route to the city centre. Other developments include &#x27;Karkurla Rise&#x27; and &#x27;Karkurla View&#x27; which have added an additional 400 homes to the area.
* Kalgoorlie

The central business district. Hannan Street, named after Paddy Hannan, is Kalgoorlie&#x27;s main street and stretches the length of the suburb. The western side of the suburb consists of housing and some light industry. The eastern side contains retail chains, banks, the police station, court house, restaurants, hotels, tourist attractions, schools, university, and a TAFE.
* Lamington
One of Kalgoorlie&#x27;s oldest suburbs. Much like other older suburbs, almost every street is parallel with Hannan Street in Central Kalgoorlie. Streets are noticeably wide. It houses North Kalgoorlie Primary School, small businesses, a medical practice, a hotel, tavern and a non-maintained 18-hole golf course.
* Mullingar
Much smaller today than it originally was before the Super Pit expansion, Mullingar is located at the far east end of Lamington, between the northern Goldfields railway and Goldfields Highway.
* O&#x27;Connor
Officially O&#x27;Connor is the south-east section of the suburb of Somerville. Much of the area is increasingly now known as O&#x27;Connor. It is home to a primary school (O&#x27;Connor Primary School), a private high school (Goldfields Baptist College), and shopping facilities. It also houses the city&#x27;s only recreation centre.
* Piccadilly
A narrow suburb following Piccadilly street between Central Kalgoorlie and Lamington. It features the city&#x27;s regional hospital, small businesses, a hotel, sporting arena and two grassed ovals.
* Somerville
Somerville marks the end of Great Eastern Highway that stretches between Kalgoorlie–Boulder and Perth. Much of the area is now referred to locally as O&#x27;Connor. Somerville contains a residential area, schools, retail shops, light industry and some horse stables. In the past it also contained market gardens.
* South Kalgoorlie
Stretching from Boundary Street, Kalgoorlie to Holmes Street, Golden Grove and bordering with Central Kalgoorlie, O&#x27;Connor and Golden Grove, South Kalgoorlie is mostly residential but also contains the Kalgoorlie–Boulder Racecourse, schools, some light industrial and small businesses. The suburb was expanded in the mid-1990s to include a sub-division named &quot;Sport of Kings&quot; on Maxwell Street, using a surplus of land from the racecourse.
* Victory Heights
A residential-only subdivision within Fairways estate along Burt Street.
* West Kalgoorlie
Kalgoorlie&#x27;s main industrial area, it is the first suburb as you approach Kalgoorlie on the Great Eastern Highway. It features the city&#x27;s airport, as well as small, medium, and heavy industrial areas. Currently under expansion further west (ANZAC Drive Industrial Estate).
* West Lamington
The western tip of Lamington was built in the 1980s. It includes one shop, sporting facilities and an arboretum nature reserve.
* Williamstown
This small existing area features mostly housing with one small primary school. It is also home to the Mount Charlotte gold mine (past production of about 5,000,000 ounces of gold), the Cassidy Shaft and Nanny Goat Hill (Mt Gleddon). Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold Mines, owner of the Super Pit to the south on the Golden Mile, from 2015 mined the &quot;Hidden Secret&quot; orebody, between and below the surface of Williamstown, using Mount Charlotte&#x27;s Cassidy Shaft as access.

<doc id="69559" wikidata="Q312681" url="?curid=69559" title="Victor Amadeus III">
<text>Victor Amadeus III (Vittorio Amedeo Maria; 26 June 1726 – 16 October 1796) was King of Sardinia and ruler of the Savoyard states from 20 February 1773 to his death in 1796. Although he was politically conservative, he carried out numerous administrative reforms until he declared war on Revolutionary France in 1792. He was the father of the last three mainline Kings of Sardinia.

==Early life and personality==

Born at the Royal Palace of Turin, he was a son of Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia and his second wife, Polyxena of Hesse-Rotenburg. He was styled the &quot;Duke of Savoy&quot; from birth until he succeeded to his father&#x27;s throne. He was the eldest son of his parents and was the heir apparent from birth which was greeted with much celebration. His father had had a son with his first wife, Countess Palatine Anne Christine of Sulzbach, who was also named Victor Amadeus, Duke of Aosta, but died in 1725. His education was entrusted to Gerdil Giacinto Sigismondo, with a particular emphasis on military training. Throughout his life, he had a great interest in the state military, on which he lavished attention.

As a young prince, he surrounded himself with intellectuals and ministers, many of whom would come to prominence in his reign. He was privately conservative and a very religious person, and, as a young boy, stayed far from public life. His father felt him to be unsuitable to hold power.

Good-natured but naive, Savoy was loved by his subjects for his generosity.

==Marriage==

He married Infanta Maria Antonia of Spain (1729–1785), youngest daughter of Philip V of Spain and Elisabeth Farnese. They were married on 31 May 1750 at Oulx and later had twelve children. He had a loving relationship with his wife, who exerted little influence over her husband. The marriage had been arranged by Maria Antonietta&#x27;s half-brother, the ruling Ferdinand VI of Spain. The Spanish Infanta had been previously rejected by Louis, Dauphin of France. The union was used to strengthen relations between Madrid and Turin having fought on opposing sides in the War of the Austrian Succession. The Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle ended the war.

==King of Sardinia==

When Victor Amadeus came to the throne in 1773 he started working on bureaucratic and military aspects of the reign. He was suspicious of anything innovative. However, he did implement several public works as well as paying a great deal of attention to his administration and armed forces. He approved and set up two new important cultural state institutions on the advice of the bourgeoisie and aristocracy alike. He started works of improvements in the port of Nice, and had dams in the Arce and the road of the Côte built.At the outbreak of the French Revolution, Victor Amadeus III allowed his two sons-in-law, the Counts of Artois and Provence and the Princesses Marie Adélaïde and Victoire to stay in his kingdom under his protection. After four years of fighting, the French under Bonaparte had finally beaten the Piedmontese army in the Battle of Montenotte (12 April 1796), the Battle of Millesimo (13–14 April 1796) and the Battle of Mondovi (21 April 1796). On 26 April the French proclaimed the Republic of Alba in the occupied territories. Two days later, with the Armistice of Cherasco, the republic was ceded back to Victor Amadeus. 

He was forced to sign the Treaty of Paris on 15 May, abandoning the First Coalition against the French Republic. The terms of the treaty required him to cede the fortresses of Cuneo, Ceva, Alessandria and Tortona to France, and allow free passage of the latter&#x27;s armies towards Italy. He was also compelled to cede Nice and Savoy. 

He died on 16 October 1796 at the Castle of Moncalieri having suffered an attack of apoplexy. Victor Amadeus died leaving an economically damaged kingdom and two key provinces – Savoy and Nice – devastated, having suffered at the hands of French revolutionary forces. He was buried at the Basilica of Superga in Turin.
==Legacy==
In 1786 Victor Amadeus III moved the remains of many of his ancestors and kinsmen to the Basilica of Superga, where he himself rests today. He established the Gold Medal of Military Valour on 21 May 1793. Like his parents, he carried out improvements to the Palazzina di caccia of Stupinigi outside Turin. Victor Amadeus III also encouraged the extension of the Orto Botanico dell&#x27;Università di Torino as well as the Società Agraria di Torino, which he created in 1785. His first cousin the Landgrave of Hesse-Rotenburg was named after him.

<doc id="69562" wikidata="Q690838" url="?curid=69562" title="Vasectomy">
<text>Vasectomy is an elective surgical procedure that results in male sterilization, often as a means of permanent contraception. During the procedure, the male vasa deferentia are cut and tied or sealed so as to prevent sperm from entering into the urethra and thereby prevent fertilization of a female through sexual intercourse. Vasectomies are usually performed in a physician&#x27;s office, medical clinic, or, when performed on a non-human animal, in a veterinary clinic. Hospitalization is not normally required as the procedure is not complicated, the incisions are small, and the necessary equipment routine.

There are several methods by which a surgeon might complete a vasectomy procedure, all of which occlude (i.e., &quot;seal&quot;) at least one side of each vas deferens. To help reduce anxiety and increase patient comfort, those who have an aversion to needles may consider a &quot;no-needle&quot; application of anesthesia while the &#x27;no-scalpel&#x27; or &#x27;open-ended&#x27; techniques help to accelerate recovery times and increase the chance of healthy recovery.

Due to the simplicity of the surgery, a vasectomy usually takes less than 30 minutes to complete. After a short recovery at the doctor&#x27;s office (usually less than an hour), the patient is sent home to rest. Because the procedure is minimally invasive, many vasectomy patients find that they can resume their typical sexual behavior within a week, and do so with little or no discomfort.

Because the procedure is considered a permanent method of contraception and is not easily reversed, patients are frequently counseled and advised to consider how the long-term outcome of a vasectomy might affect them both emotionally and physically.
A vasectomy without the patient&#x27;s consent or knowledge is considered forced sterilization.

==Medical uses==

A vasectomy is done to prevent fertility in males. It ensures that in most cases the person will be sterile after confirmation of success following surgery. The procedure is regarded as permanent because vasectomy reversal is costly and often does not restore the male&#x27;s sperm count or sperm motility to prevasectomy levels. Those with vasectomies have a very small (nearly zero) chance of successfully impregnating someone, but a vasectomy does not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs).

After vasectomy, the testes remain in the scrotum where Leydig cells continue to produce testosterone and other male hormones that continue to be secreted into the bloodstream.

When the vasectomy is complete, sperm cannot exit the body through the penis. Sperm is still produced by the testicles but is broken down and absorbed by the body. Much fluid content is absorbed by membranes in the epididymis, and much solid content is broken down by the responding macrophages and reabsorbed via the bloodstream. After vasectomy, the membranes must increase in size to absorb and store more fluid; this triggering of the immune system causes more macrophages to be recruited to break down and reabsorb more solid content. Within one year after vasectomy, sixty to seventy percent of those vasectomized develop antisperm antibodies. In some cases, vasitis nodosa, a benign proliferation of the ductular epithelium, can also result. The accumulation of sperm increases pressure in the vas deferens and epididymis. The entry of the sperm into the scrotum can cause sperm granulomas to be formed by the body to contain and absorb the sperm which the body will treat as a foreign biological substance (much like a virus or bacterium).

===Efficacy===
Vasectomy is the most effective permanent form of contraception available to males. (Removing the entire vas deferens would very likely be more effective, but it is not something that is regularly done.) In nearly every way that vasectomy can be compared to tubal ligation it has a more positive outlook. Vasectomy is more cost effective, less invasive, has techniques that are emerging that may facilitate easier reversal, and has a much lower risk of postoperative complications.

Early failure rates, i.e. pregnancy within a few months after vasectomy, typically result from unprotected sexual intercourse too soon after the procedure while some sperm continue to pass through the vasa deferentia. Most physicians and surgeons who perform vasectomies recommend one (sometimes two) postprocedural semen specimens to verify a successful vasectomy; however, many people fail to return for verification tests citing inconvenience, embarrassment, forgetfulness, or certainty of sterility. In January 2008, the FDA cleared a home test called SpermCheck Vasectomy that allows patients to perform postvasectomy confirmation tests themselves; however, compliance for postvasectomy semen analysis in general remains low.

Late failure, i.e. pregnancy following spontaneous recanalization of the vasa deferentia, has also been documented. This occurs because the epithelium of the vas deferens (similar to the epithelium of some other human body parts) is capable of regenerating and creating a new tube if the vas deferens is damaged and/or severed. Even when as much as five centimeters (or two inches) of the vas deferens is removed, the vas deferens can still grow back together and become reattached—thus allowing sperm to once again pass and flow through the vas deferens, restoring one&#x27;s fertility.

The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists states there is a generally agreed-upon rate of late failure of about one in 2000 vasectomies—better than tubal ligations for which the failure rate is one in every 200 to 300 cases. A 2005 review including both early and late failures described a total of 183 recanalizations from 43,642 vasectomies (0.4%), and 60 pregnancies after 92,184 vasectomies (0.07%).

==Complications and concerns==

Short-term possible complications include infection, bruising and bleeding into the scrotum resulting in a collection of blood known as a hematoma. A 2012 study demonstrated an infection rate of 2.5% postvasectomy. The stitches on the small incisions required are prone to irritation, though this can be minimized by covering them with gauze or small adhesive bandages. The primary long-term complications are chronic pain conditions or syndromes that can affect any of the scrotal, pelvic or lower-abdominal regions, collectively known as post-vasectomy pain syndrome. 

Complications not withstanding, many men express concerns regarding potential adverse effects of vasectomy. The risk of testicular cancer is not affected by vasectomy. In 2014, the American Urological Association reaffirmed that vasectomy is not a risk factor for prostate cancer and that it is not necessary for physicians to routinely discuss prostate cancer in their preoperative counseling of men undergoing vasectomy. A 2017 meta-analysis found no statistically significant increase in risk of prostate cancer. A 2019 study of 2.1 million Danish males found that vasectomy increased their incidence of prostate cancer by 15%. A 2020 meta-analysis found that vasectomy increased the incidence by 9%. Other studies agree on the 15% increase in risk of developing prostate cancer, but found that people who get a vasectomy are not more likely to die from prostate cancer than those without a vasectomy. 

===Postvasectomy pain===
Post-vasectomy pain syndrome is a chronic and sometimes debilitating condition that may develop immediately or several years after vasectomy. The most robust study of post-vasectomy pain, according to the American Urology Association&#x27;s Vasectomy Guidelines of 2012 (amended 2015) surveyed people just before their vasectomy and again seven months later. Of those that responded and who said they did not have any scrotal pain prior to vasectomy, 7% had scrotal pain seven months later which they described as &quot;Mild, a bit of a nuisance&quot;, 1.6% had pain that was &quot;Moderate, require painkillers&quot; and 0.9% had pain that was &quot;quite severe and noticeably affecting their quality of life&quot;. Post-vasectomy pain can be constant orchialgia or epididymal pain (epididymitis), or it can be pain that occurs only at particular times such as with sexual intercourse, ejaculation, or physical exertion.

===Psychological effects===
A 1990 study indicated that some 90% of men are generally reported in reviews as being satisfied with having had a vasectomy, while 7–10% of people regret their decision.

Younger people who receive a vasectomy are significantly more likely to regret and seek a reversal of their vasectomy, with one study showing people in their twenties being 12.5 times more likely to undergo a vasectomy reversal later in life (and including some who chose sterilization at a young age). Pre-vasectomy counseling is often emphasised for younger patients.

==Procedure==

The traditional incision approach of vasectomy involves numbing of the scrotum with local anesthetic (although some people&#x27;s physiology may make access to the vas deferens more difficult in which case general anesthesia may be recommended) after which a scalpel is used to make two small incisions, one on each side of the scrotum at a location that allows the surgeon to bring each vas deferens to the surface for excision. The vasa deferentia are cut (sometimes a section may be removed altogether), separated, and then at least one side is sealed by ligating (suturing), cauterizing (electrocauterization), or clamping. There are several variations to this method that may improve healing, effectiveness, and which help mitigate long-term pain such as post-vasectomy pain syndrome or epididymitis, however the data supporting one over another are limited.
* Fascial interposition: Recanalization of the vas deferens is a known cause of vasectomy failure(s). Fascial interposition (&quot;FI&quot;), in which a tissue barrier is placed between the cut ends of the vas by suturing, may help to prevent this type of failure, increasing the overall success rate of vasectomy while leaving the testicular end within the confines of the fascia. The fascia is a fibrous protective sheath that surrounds the vas deferens as well as all other body muscle tissue. This method, when combined with intraluminal cautery (where one or both sides of the vas deferens are electrically &quot;burned&quot; closed to prevent recanalization), has been shown to increase the success rate of vasectomy procedures.
* No-needle anesthesia: Fear of needles for injection of local anesthesia is well known. In 2005, a method of local anesthesia was introduced for vasectomy which allows the surgeon to apply it painlessly with a special jet-injection tool, as opposed to traditional needle application. The numbing agent is forced/pushed onto and deep enough into the scrotal tissue to allow for a virtually pain-free surgery. Lidocaine applied in this manner typically achieves anesthesia within 10 to 20 seconds. Initial surveys show a very high satisfaction rate amongst vasectomy patients. Once the effects of no-needle anesthesia set in, the vasectomy procedure is performed in the routine manner. However, unlike in conventional local anesthesia where needles and syringes are used on one patient only, the applicator is not single use and can only be properly disinfected by autoclaving.
* No-scalpel vasectomy (NSV): Also known as a &quot;key-hole&quot; vasectomy, is a vasectomy in which a sharp hemostat (as opposed to a scalpel) is used to puncture the scrotum. This method has come into widespread use as the resulting smaller &quot;incision&quot; or puncture wound typically limits bleeding and hematomas. Also the smaller wound has less chance of infection, resulting in faster healing times compared to the larger/longer incisions made with a scalpel. The surgical wound created by the no-scalpel method usually does not require stitches. NSV is the most commonly performed type of minimally invasive vasectomy, and both describe the method of vasectomy that leads to access of the vas deferens.

* Open-ended vasectomy: In this procedure the testicular end of the vas deferens is not sealed, which allows continued streaming of sperm into the scrotum. This method may avoid testicular pain resulting from increased back-pressure in the epididymis. Studies suggest that this method may reduce long-term complications such as post-vasectomy pain syndrome.
* Vas irrigation: Injections of sterile water or euflavine (which kills sperm) are put into the distal portion of the vas at the time of surgery which then brings about a near-immediate sterile (&quot;azoospermatic&quot;) condition. The use of euflavine does however, tend to decrease time (or, number of ejaculations) to azoospermia vs. the water irrigation by itself. This additional step in the vasectomy procedure, (and similarly, fascial interposition), has shown positive results but is not as prominently in use, and few surgeons offer it as part of their vasectomy procedure.

===Other techniques===
The following vasectomy methods have purportedly had a better chance of later reversal but have seen less use by virtue of known higher failure rates (i.e., recanalization). An earlier clip device, the VasClip, is no longer on the market, due to unacceptably high failure rates.

The VasClip method, though considered reversible, has had a higher cost and resulted in lower success rates. Also, because the vasa deferentia are not cut or tied with this method, it could technically be classified as other than a vasectomy. Vasectomy reversal (and the success thereof) was conjectured to be higher as it only required removing the Vas-Clip device. This method achieved limited use, and scant reversal data are available.

====Vas occlusion techniques====

* Injected plugs: There are two types of injected plugs which can be used to block the vasa deferentia. Medical-grade polyurethane (MPU) or medical-grade silicone rubber (MSR) starts as a liquid polymer that is injected into the vas deferens after which the liquid is clamped in place until is solidifies (usually in a few minutes).
* Intra-vas device: The vasa deferentia can also be occluded by an intra-vas device (IVD). A small cut is made in the lower abdomen after which a soft silicone or urethane plug is inserted into each vas tube thereby blocking (occluding) sperm. This method allows for the vas to remain intact. IVD technique is done in an out-patient setting with local anesthetic, similar to a traditional vasectomy. IVD reversal can be performed under the same conditions making it much less costly than vasovasostomy which can require general anesthesia and longer surgery time.

Both vas occlusion techniques require the same basic patient setup: local anesthesia, puncturing of the scrotal sac for access of the vas, and then plug or injected plug occlusion. The success of the aforementioned vas occlusion techniques is not clear and data are still limited. Studies have shown, however, that the time to achieve sterility is longer than the more prominent techniques mentioned in the beginning of this article. The satisfaction rate of patients undergoing IVD techniques has a high rate of satisfaction with regard to the surgery experience itself.

===Recovery===

Sexual intercourse can usually be resumed in about a week (depending on recovery); however, pregnancy is still possible as long as the sperm count is above zero. Another method of contraception must be relied upon until a sperm count is performed either two months after the vasectomy or after 10–20 ejaculations have occurred.

After a vasectomy, contraceptive precautions must be continued until azoospermia is confirmed. Usually two semen analyses at three and four months are necessary to confirm azoospermia. The British Andrological Society has recommended that a single semen analysis confirming azoospermia after sixteen weeks is sufficient.

Post-vasectomy, testicles will continue to produce sperm cells. As before vasectomy, unused sperm are reabsorbed by the body.

== Conceiving after vasectomy ==

In order to allow the possibility of reproduction via artificial insemination after vasectomy, some opt for cryopreservation of sperm before sterilization. Dr Allan Pacey, senior lecturer in andrology at Sheffield University and secretary of the British Fertility Society, notes that those he sees for a vasectomy reversal which has not worked express wishing they had known they could have stored sperm. Pacey notes, &quot;The problem is you&#x27;re asking a man to foresee a future where he might not necessarily be with his current partner—and that may be quite hard to do when she&#x27;s sitting next to you.&quot;

The cost of cryo-preservation (sperm banking) may also be substantially less than alternative vaso-vasectomy procedures, compared to the costs of in-vitro fertilization (IVF) which usually run from $12,000 to $25,000.

Sperm can be aspirated from the testicles or the epididymides, and while there is not enough for successful artificial insemination, there is enough to fertilize an ovum by intracytoplasmic sperm injection. This avoids the problem of antisperm antibodies and may result in a faster pregnancy. IVF may be less costly per cycle than reversal in some health-care systems, but a single IVF cycle is often insufficient for conception. Disadvantages include the need for procedures on the woman, and the standard potential side-effects of IVF for both the mother and the child.

===Vasectomy reversal===
Vasectomies are not always reversible. There is a surgical procedure to reverse vasectomies using vasovasostomy (a form of microsurgery first performed by Earl Owen in 1971). Vasovasostomy is effective at achieving pregnancy in a variable percentage of cases, and total out-of-pocket costs in the United States are often upwards of $10,000. The typical success rate of pregnancy following a vasectomy reversal is around 55% if performed within 10 years, and drops to around 25% if performed after 10 years. After reversal, sperm counts and motility are usually much lower than pre-vasectomy levels.

Approximately 2% of men who have undergone vasectomy will undergo a reversal within 10 years of the procedure. A small number of vasectomy reversals are also performed in attempts to relieve post-vasectomy pain syndrome.

==Prevalence==

Internationally, vasectomy rates are vastly different. While female sterilisation is the most widely used method worldwide, with 223 million women relying on it, only 28 million women rely on their partner&#x27;s vasectomy. In the world&#x27;s 69 least developed countries less than 0.1% of males use vasectomies on average. Of 54 African countries, only ten report measurable vasectomy use and only Eswatini, Botswana, and South Africa exceed 0.1% prevalence.

In North America and Europe vasectomy usage is on the order of 10% with some countries reaching 20%. Despite its high efficacy, in the United States, vasectomy is utilized less than half the rate of the alternative female tubal ligation. According to the research, vasectomy in the US is least utilized among black and Latino populations, the groups that have the highest rates of female sterilization.

New Zealand, in contrast, has higher levels of vasectomy than tubal ligation; 18% of all males, and 25% of all married males, have had a vasectomy. The age cohort with the highest level of vasectomy was 40–49, where 57% of males had taken it up. Canada, the UK, Bhutan and the Netherlands all have similar levels of uptake.

==History==
The first human vasectomies were performed in the late 19th century. The procedure was initially used mainly as a treatment for prostate enlargement and as a eugenic method for sterilizing &quot;degenerates&quot;. Vasectomy as a method of voluntary birth control began during the Second World War. 

The first recorded vasectomy was performed on a dog in 1823. The first human vasectomies were performed to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia, or enlargement of the prostate. Castration had sometimes been used as a treatment for this condition in the 1880s, but, given the serious side effects, doctors sought alternative treatments. The first to suggest vasectomy as an alternative to castration may have been James Ewing Mears (in 1890), or Jean Casimir Félix Guyon.
The first human vasectomy is thought to have been performed by Reginald Harrison. By 1900, Harrison reported that he had performed more than 100 vasectomies with no adverse outcomes.

In the late 1890s, vasectomy also came to be proposed as a eugenic measure for the sterilization of men considered unfit to reproduce. The first case report of vasectomy in the United States was in 1897, by A. J. Ochsner, a surgeon in Chicago, in a paper titled, &quot;Surgical treatment of habitual criminals&quot;. He believed vasectomy to be a simple, effective means for stemming the tide of racial degeneration widely believed to be occurring. In 1902, Harry C. Sharp, the surgeon at the Indiana Reformatory, reported that he had sterilized 42 inmates in an effort to both reduce criminal behavior in those individuals and prevent the birth of future criminals.

Eugen Steinach (1861–1944), an Austrian physician, believed that a unilateral vasectomy (severing only one of the two vasa deferentia) in older individuals could restore general vigor and sexual potency, shrink enlarged prostates, and cure various ailments by somehow boosting the hormonal output of the vasectomized testicle. This surgery, which became very popular in the 1920s, was undertaken by many wealthy individuals, including Sigmund Freud and W. B. Yeats. Since these operations lacked rigorous controlled trials, any rejuvenating effect was likely due to the placebo effect, and with the later development of synthetic injectable hormones, this operation fell out of vogue.

Vasectomy began to be regarded as a method of consensual birth control during the Second World War. The first vasectomy program on a national scale was launched in 1954 in India. In the 1970s, India enacted a coercive sterilization campaign which resulted in millions of vasectomies. Today, India&#x27;s sterilization program focuses on coercing poor women. 

The procedure is seldom performed on dogs, with castration remaining the preferred reproductive control option for canines. It is regularly performed on bulls.

==Society and culture==
===Availability and legality===

Vasectomy costs are (or may be) covered in different countries, as a method of both contraception or population control, with some offering it as a part of a national health insurance. The procedure was generally considered illegal in France until 2001, due to provisions in the Napoleonic Code forbidding &quot;self-mutilation&quot;. No French law specifically mentioned vasectomy until a 2001 law on contraception and infanticide permitted the procedure.

The U.S. Affordable Care Act (signed into law in 2010) does not cover vasectomies, although eight states require state-health insurance plans to cover the cost. These include: Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington.

In 2014, the Iranian parliament voted for a bill that would ban the procedure.

=== Impact of legal changes (US) ===
An analysis of medical records of 217 million people in the U.S. compared tubal sterilization and vasectomy rates in the last six months of 2021 with rates in the last six months of 2022—just after the Dobbs ruling (i.e. the overturning of Roe vs Wade) in June 2022. Although the effect of Dobbs was different in various social groups, it had a strong impact on those under age 30 with their vasectomy rates increasing by 59%, and tubal sterilization rates increasing by 29%.

===Tourism===
Medical tourism, where a patient travels to a less-developed location where a procedure is cheaper to save money and combine convalescence with a vacation, is infrequently used for vasectomy due to its low cost, but is more likely to be used for vasectomy reversal. Many hospitals list vasectomy as being available. Medical tourism has been scrutinized by some governments for quality of care and postoperative care issues.

===Shooting of Andrew Rynne===
In 1990, Andrew Rynne, chairperson of the Irish Family Planning Association, and the Republic of Ireland&#x27;s first vasectomy specialist, was shot by a former client, but he survived. The incident is the subject of a short film, &quot;The Vasectomy Doctor&quot;, by Paul Webster.

<text>Charles Emmanuel IV (Carlo Emanuele Ferdinando Maria; 24 May 1751 – 6 October 1819) was King of Sardinia and ruler of the Savoyard states from 16 October 1796 until 1802, when he abdicated in favour of his brother Victor Emmanuel I.

==Early life==
Carlo Emanuele Ferdinando Maria di Savoia was born in Turin, the eldest son of Victor Amadeus III, King of Sardinia, and of his wife Infanta Maria Antonia Ferdinanda of Spain. From his birth to his succession to the throne of Sardinia in 1796, Charles Emmanuel was styled &quot;Prince of Piedmont&quot;.

In 1775, Charles Emmanuel married Clotilde of France, the sister of King Louis XVI of France. Although the union was arranged for political reasons, Charles Emmanuel and his wife became devoted to each other. Their attempts to have children, however, were unsuccessful.

==Reign==
At the death of his father (14 October 1796), Charles Emmanuel succeeded as King of Sardinia. The kingdom included not only the island of Sardinia but also significant territories in northwest Italy including all of Piedmont.

At his succession to the throne in 1796, Sardinia had been forced to conclude the disadvantageous Treaty of Paris (1796) with the French Republic, giving the French army free passage through Piedmont. On 6 December 1798 the French, under Joubert, occupied Turin and forced Charles Emanuel to abdicate all his territories on the Italian mainland and to withdraw to the island of Sardinia, which stayed out of the reach of the French army. The following year he tried unsuccessfully to regain Piedmont. He and his wife lived in Rome and in Naples as guests of the wealthy Colonna family.

==Post-abdication==
On 7 March 1802, Charles Emmanuel&#x27;s wife Marie Clothilde died. He was so moved by her death that he decided to abdicate, on 4 June 1802, in favour of his brother Victor Emmanuel I. Charles Emmanuel retained the personal title of king. He lived in Rome and in the nearby town of Frascati.

In Frascati he was a frequent guest of his cousin Henry Benedict Stuart, Cardinal Duke of York, last member of the royal House of Stuart. Charles was descended from Henrietta Anne Stuart, the youngest daughter of King Charles I of England, whereas Henry Benedict Stuart was descended from Henrietta Anne&#x27;s brother James II. When Henry died in 1807, Charles Emmanuel became the heir-general of Charles I, and thus inherited the Jacobite claim to the British thrones. Unlike his three predecessors, however, neither he nor his successors ever made any attempt to claim the throne.

In 1815, at the age of sixty-four, Charles Emmanuel took simple vows in the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits). He was never ordained to the priesthood but lived the rest of his life at the Jesuit novitiate in Rome.

Charles Emmanuel died at the Palazzo Colonna in Rome on 6 October 1819. He is buried in the Church of Sant&#x27;Andrea al Quirinale.

<text>In number theory, Euler&#x27;s theorem (also known as the Fermat–Euler theorem or Euler&#x27;s totient theorem) states that, if and are coprime positive integers, then formula_1 is congruent to formula_2 modulo , where formula_3 denotes Euler&#x27;s totient function; that is
:formula_4

In 1736, Leonhard Euler published a proof of Fermat&#x27;s little theorem (stated by Fermat without proof), which is the restriction of Euler&#x27;s theorem to the case where is a prime number. Subsequently, Euler presented other proofs of the theorem, culminating with his paper of 1763, in which he proved a generalization to the case where is not prime.

The converse of Euler&#x27;s theorem is also true: if the above congruence is true, then formula_5 and formula_6 must be coprime.

The theorem is further generalized by some of Carmichael&#x27;s theorems.

The theorem may be used to easily reduce large powers modulo formula_6. For example, consider finding the ones place decimal digit of formula_8, i.e. formula_9. The integers 7 and 10 are coprime, and formula_10. So Euler&#x27;s theorem yields formula_11, and we get formula_12.

In general, when reducing a power of formula_5 modulo formula_6 (where formula_5 and formula_6 are coprime), one needs to work modulo formula_17 in the exponent of formula_5:
:if formula_19, then formula_20.

Euler&#x27;s theorem underlies the RSA cryptosystem, which is widely used in Internet communications. In this cryptosystem, Euler&#x27;s theorem is used with being a product of two large prime numbers, and the security of the system is based on the difficulty of factoring such an integer.

== Proofs ==
1. Euler&#x27;s theorem can be proven using concepts from the theory of groups: 
The residue classes modulo that are coprime to form a group under multiplication (see the article Multiplicative group of integers modulo &quot;n&quot; for details). The order of that group is . Lagrange&#x27;s theorem states that the order of any subgroup of a finite group divides the order of the entire group, in this case . If is any number coprime to then is in one of these residue classes, and its powers modulo form a subgroup of the group of residue classes, with . Lagrange&#x27;s theorem says must divide , i.e. there is an integer such that . This then implies,
:formula_21

2. There is also a direct proof: Let be a reduced residue system () and let be any integer coprime to . The proof hinges on the fundamental fact that multiplication by permutes the : in other words if then . (This law of cancellation is proved in the article Multiplicative group of integers modulo &quot;n&quot;.) That is, the sets and , considered as sets of congruence classes (), are identical (as sets—they may be listed in different orders), so the product of all the numbers in is congruent () to the product of all the numbers in :
:formula_22 and using the cancellation law to cancel each gives Euler&#x27;s theorem:

:formula_23

<doc id="69567" wikidata="Q1148687" url="?curid=69567" title="Potiphar">
<text>Potiphar ( ; ; ) is a figure in the Hebrew Bible and the Quran. His name possibly indicates the same figure as Potiphera ().

Potiphar is the captain of the Egyptian king&#x27;s guard who is said to have purchased Joseph as a slave and, impressed by his intelligence, makes him the master of his household. Potiphar&#x27;s wife, who was known for her infidelities, took a liking to Joseph and attempted to seduce him. When Joseph refused her advances and ran off, leaving his outer vestment in her hands, she retaliated by falsely accusing him of trying to rape her, and Potiphar had Joseph imprisoned.

What happened to Potiphar after that is unclear; some sources identify him as Potipherah, an Egyptian priest whose daughter, Asenath, marries Joseph. The false accusation by Potiphar&#x27;s wife plays an important role in Joseph&#x27;s narrative because had he not been imprisoned, he would not have met the fellow prisoner who introduced him to Pharaoh. Likewise, the fate of Potiphar&#x27;s wife is unclear but some sources say she was stricken with illness.

Rachel Adelman suggests that both Potiphar and his wife were sexually attracted to Joseph and tried to use him for their own purposes. But Potiphar&#x27;s attempts were thwarted via castration, according to Talmudic legend. She believes the story is a criticism of Jewish assimilation since foreigners like Potiphar and his wife would seduce Jews to sin.

The medieval Sefer HaYashar, a commentary on the Torah, gives Potiphar&#x27;s wife&#x27;s name as &quot;Zuleikha&quot;, as do many Islamic traditions - thus the Persian poem called Yusuf and Zulaikha from Jami&#x27;s &quot;Haft Awrang&quot; &quot;Seven thrones&quot;.

The story became prevalent in Western art during the Renaissance and Baroque periods, usually depicting the moment when Joseph tears himself away from the bed containing a more or less naked figure of Potiphar&#x27;s wife. Persian miniatures often illustrate Yusuf and Zulaikha in Jami&#x27;s &quot;Haft Awrang&quot; (&quot;Seven thrones&quot;).

==Religious references==
Tying Potiphar or Joseph accurately to a particular pharaoh or period is difficult. According to the Jewish calendar, Joseph was purchased in the year 2216, which is 1544 BC, at the end of the Second Intermediate Period or the very beginning of the New Kingdom. The Torah in which the story appears (see also the Bible and the Quran) was the earliest written of the three: c. 600 BC during the Babylonian Exile. According to the documentary hypothesis, the story of Potiphar and his wife is credited to the Yahwist source and stands in the same place that the stories of the butler and the baker and Pharaoh&#x27;s dreams stand in the Elohist text.

A similar story is found in the Tale of Two Brothers, where the wife of Anpu tries to seduce his brother Bata.

==Islam==
The story is first related in Quran 12:21–35: An Egyptian purchases Joseph and proposes to adopt him. The Egyptian&#x27;s wife endeavors to seduce Joseph, but he is preserved from her enticements. She accuses Joseph of an attempt to dishonor her. The rent in his garment testifies to Joseph&#x27;s innocence. Azeez believes Joseph and condemns his wife. The sin of Azeez&#x27;s wife becomes known in the city (Q12:30). Seeing Joseph&#x27;s beauty, the wives of other noblemen call him an angel. Azeez&#x27;s wife declares her purpose to imprison Joseph unless he yields to her solicitations. Joseph seeks protection from God, who hears his prayer and turns aside their snares, but Joseph is imprisoned notwithstanding his innocence.

<doc id="69569" wikidata="Q184826" url="?curid=69569" title="Vanir">
<text>In Norse mythology, the Vanir (; Old Norse:, singular Vanr) are a group of gods associated with fertility, wisdom, and the ability to see the future. The Vanir are one of two groups of gods (the other being the Æsir) and are the namesake of the location Vanaheimr (Old Norse &quot;Home of the Vanir&quot;). After the Æsir–Vanir War, the Vanir became a subgroup of the Æsir. Subsequently, members of the Vanir are sometimes also referred to as members of the Æsir.

The Vanir are attested in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources; the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; and &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, both written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson; and in the poetry of skalds. The Vanir are only attested in these Old Norse sources.

All sources describe the god Njörðr, and his children Freyr and Freyja as members of the Vanir. A euhemerized prose account in &quot;Heimskringla&quot; adds that Njörðr&#x27;s sister—whose name is not provided—and Kvasir were Vanir. In addition, &quot;Heimskringla&quot; reports a tale involving king Sveigðir&#x27;s visit to Vanaheimr, where he meets a woman by the name of Vana and the two produce a child named Vanlandi (whose name means &quot;Man from the Land of the Vanir&quot;).

While not attested as Vanir, the gods Heimdall and Ullr have been theorized as potential members of the group. In the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, a name listed for boars is &quot;Van-child&quot;. Scholars have theorized that the Vanir may be connected to small pieces of gold foil found in Scandinavia at some building sites from the Migration Period to the Viking Age and occasionally in graves. They have speculated whether the Vanir originally represented pre-Indo-European deities or Indo-European fertility gods, and have theorized a form of the gods as venerated by the pagan Anglo-Saxons.

==Etymology==
Numerous theories have been proposed for the etymology of &quot;Vanir&quot;. Scholar R. I. Page says that, while there is no shortage of etymologies for the word, it is tempting to link the word with Old Norse &quot;vinr&quot; (&#x27;friend&#x27;) and Latin &quot;Venus&quot; (&#x27;goddess of physical love&#x27;). &quot;Vanir&quot; is sometimes anglicized to &quot;Wanes&quot; (singular &quot;Wane&quot;).

==Attestations==

===&quot;Poetic Edda&quot;===

In the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, the Vanir, as a group, are specifically referenced in the poems &quot;Völuspá&quot;, &quot;Vafþrúðnismál&quot;, &quot;Skírnismál&quot;, &quot;Þrymskviða&quot;, &quot;Alvíssmál&quot;, and &quot;Sigrdrífumál&quot;. In &quot;Völuspá&quot;, a stanza describes the events of the Æsir–Vanir War, noting that during the war the Vanir broke the walls of the stronghold of the Æsir, and that the Vanir were &quot;indomitable, trampling the plain&quot;.

In &quot;Vafþrúðnismál&quot;, Gagnráðr (the god Odin in disguise) engages in a game of wits with the jötunn Vafþrúðnir. Gagnráðr asks Vafþrúðnir where the Van god Njörðr came from, for though he rules over many hofs and hörgrs, Njörðr was not raised among the Æsir. Vafþrúðnir responds that Njörðr was created in Vanaheimr (&quot;home of the Vanir&quot;) by &quot;wise powers&quot; and details that during the Æsir–Vanir War, Njörðr was exchanged as a hostage. In addition, when the world ends (Ragnarök), Njörðr &quot;will return to the wise Vanir&quot;.

&quot;Alvíssmál&quot; consists of question and answer exchanges between the dwarf Alvíss and the god Thor. In the poem, Alvíss supplies terms that various groups, including the Vanir, use to refer to various subjects. Alvíss attributes nine terms to the Vanir; one for Earth (&quot;The Ways&quot;), Heaven (&quot;The Weaver of Winds&quot;), clouds (&quot;Kites of the Wind&quot;), calm (&quot;The Hush of the Winds&quot;), the sea (&quot;The Wave&quot;), fire (&quot;Wildfire&quot;), wood (&quot;The Wand&quot;), seed (&quot;growth&quot;), and ale (&quot;The Foaming&quot;).

The poem &quot;Þrymskviða&quot; states that the god Heimdallr possesses foreknowledge, &quot;as the Vanir also can&quot;. &quot;Sigrdrífumál&quot; records that the Vanir are in possession of a &quot;sacred mead&quot;. In the poem, the valkyrie Sigrdrífa provides mystical lore about runes to the hero Sigurd. Sigrdrífa notes that runes were once carved on to various creatures, deities, and other figures, and then shaved off and mixed with a &quot;sacred mead&quot;. This mead is possessed by the Æsir, the elves, mankind, and the Vanir.

In &quot;Skírnismál&quot;, the beautiful jötunn Gerðr first encounters the god Freyr&#x27;s messenger Skírnir, and asks him if he is of the elves, of the Æsir, or of the &quot;wise Vanir&quot;. Skírnir responds that he is not of any of the three groups. Later in the poem, Skírnir is successful in his threats against Gerðr (to have Gerðr accept Freyr&#x27;s affections), and Gerðr offers Skírnir a crystal cup full of mead, noting that she never thought that she would love one of the Vanir.

===&quot;Prose Edda&quot;===

The Vanir are mentioned in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; books &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; and &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;. In chapter 23 of &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, the enthroned figure of High relates that Njörðr was raised in Vanaheimr. High says that during the Æsir–Vanir War, the Vanir sent Njörðr as a hostage to the Æsir, and the Æsir sent to the Vanir the god Hœnir. The sending of Njörðr as a hostage resulted in a peace agreement between the Æsir and the Vanir.

Chapter 35 provides information regarding the goddess Freyja, including that one of her names is &quot;Dis of the Vanir&quot;. In the same chapter, High tells that the goddess Gná rides the horse Hófvarpnir, and that this horse has the ability to ride through the air and atop the sea. High continues that &quot;once some Vanir saw her path as she rode through the air&quot; and that an unnamed one of these Vanir says, in verse (for which no source is provided):

:&quot;What flies there?
:What fares there?
:or moves through the air?&quot;

Gná responds:

:&quot;I fly not
:though I fare
:and move through the air
:on Hofvarpnir
:the one whom Hamskerpir got
:with Gardrofa.&quot;
In chapter 57 of &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, the god Bragi explains the origin of poetry. Bragi says the origin of poetry lies in the Æsir-Vanir War. During the peace conference held to end the war both the Æsir and the Vanir formed a truce by spitting into a vat. When they left, the gods decided that it shouldn&#x27;t be poured out, but rather kept as a symbol of their peace, and so from the contents they made a man; Kvasir. Kvasir is later murdered by dwarves, and from his blood the Mead of Poetry is made.

In chapter 6, poetic names for Njörðr are provided, including &quot;descendant of Vanir or a Van&quot;. As reference, a poem by the 11th century skald Þórðr Sjáreksson is provided where Njörðr is described as a Vanr. In chapter 7, poetic names for Freyr are listed, including names that reference his association with the Vanir; &quot;Vanir god&quot;, &quot;descendant of Vanir&quot;, and &quot;a Van&quot;. Freyja is also repeatedly cited as a Vanr. In chapter 20, some of Freyja&#x27;s names are listed and include &quot;Van-deity&quot; and &quot;Van-lady&quot;, and chapter 37 provides skaldic verse referring to Freyja as &quot;Van-bride&quot;. In chapter 75, names for pigs are provided, including &quot;Van-child&quot;, a name shared with Freyr.

===&quot;Heimskringla&quot;===

The &quot;Heimskringla&quot; book &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; (chapter 4) provides an euhemerized account of the Æsir–Vanir War. As a peace agreement, the two sides agreed to trade hostages. The Vanir sent Njörðr and Freyr to the Æsir, and in turn the Æsir sent Hœnir and Mímir to the Vanir.

Upon receiving Mímir, the Vanir sent the &quot;cleverest amongst them&quot;, Kvasir. In Vanaheimr, the Vanir made Hœnir a chieftain. However, whenever Hœnir appeared at assemblies or meetings where the Vanir asked him his opinion on difficult issues, his response was &quot;let others decide&quot;. The Vanir suspected that they had been cheated by the Æsir in the hostage exchange, and so grabbed hold of Mímir, cut off Mímir&#x27;s head, and sent it to the Æsir.

The same chapter describes that while Njörðr lived among the Vanir, his wife (unnamed) was his sister, and the couple had two children: Freyr and Freyja. However, &quot;among the Æsir it was forbidden to marry so near a kin&quot;. By Odin&#x27;s appointment, Njörðr and his son Freyr became priests over offerings of sacrifice, and they were recognized as gods among the Æsir. Freyja was priestess at the sacrifices, and &quot;it was she who first taught the Æsir magic as was practiced among the Vanir&quot;.

In chapter 15, the king Sveigðir is recorded as having married a woman named Vana in &quot;Vanaland&quot;, located in Sweden. The two produced a child, who they named Vanlandi (Old Norse &quot;Man from the Land of the Vanir&quot;.

==Archaeological record==

Small pieces of gold foil decorated with pictures of figures dating from the Migration Period into the early Viking Age (known as &quot;gullgubber&quot;) have been discovered in various locations in Scandinavia, in one case almost 2,500. The foil pieces have been found largely at sites of buildings, only rarely in graves.

The figures are sometimes single, occasionally an animal, sometimes a man and a woman with a leafy bough between them, facing or embracing one another. The human figures are almost always clothed and are sometimes depicted with their knees bent. Scholar Hilda Ellis Davidson says that it has been suggested that the figures are partaking in a dance, and that they may have been connected with weddings and linked to the Vanir, representing the notion of a divine marriage, such as in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; poem &quot;Skírnismál&quot;; the coming together of the Vanir god Freyr and his love, Gerðr.

==Scholarly reception==
===Historicists and structuralists===
Much of the discussion among scholars on the topic of the Vanir has historically been on the question of whether the Vanir are the reflection of a purported historic meeting between different peoples in the ancient past (&quot;historicists&quot;) or an extension of Proto-Indo-European mythology where such a narrative may have existed for complex social reasons (&quot;structuralists&quot;) among the early Indo-European peoples, and thereafter spread to their descendants. Notable proponents of the historicist position include Karl Helm, Ernst Alfred Philippson, Lotte Motz, and Lotte Headegger, whereas notable proponents of the structuralist view include Georges Dumézil, Jan de Vries, and Gabriel Turville-Petre. The structuralist view has generally gained the most support among academics, although with caveats, including among Jens Peter Schjødt, Margaret Clunies Ross, and Thomas DuBois.

Like the Vanr goddess Freyja, the Vanir as a group are not attested outside Scandinavia. Traditionally, following &quot;Völuspá&quot; and the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, scholarship on the Vanir has focused on the Æsir–Vanir War, its possible basis in a war between peoples, and whether the Vanir originated as the deities of a distinct people. Some scholars have doubted that they were known outside Scandinavia; however, there is evidence that the god Freyr is the same god as the Germanic deity Ing (reconstructed as Proto-Germanic &quot;*Ingwaz&quot;), and that, if so, he is attested as having been known among the Goths.

===Membership, elves, ship symbolism, &quot;field of the dead&quot;, and &quot;vanitates&quot;===
Hilda Ellis Davidson theorizes that all of the wives of the gods may have originally been members of the Vanir, noting that many of them appear to have originally been children of jötnar. Davidson additionally notes that &quot;it is the Vanir and Odin who seem to receive the most hostile treatment in Christian stories about mythological personages&quot;.

Joseph S. Hopkins and Haukur Þorgeirsson, building on suggestions by archaeologist Ole Crumlin-Pedersen and others, link the Vanir to ship burial customs among the North Germanic peoples, proposing an early Germanic model of a ship in a &quot;field of the dead&quot; that may be represented both by Freyja&#x27;s afterlife field Fólkvangr and by the Old English Neorxnawang (the mysterious first element of which may be linked to the name of Freyja&#x27;s father, Njörðr).

Richard North theorizes that glossing Latin &quot;vanitates&quot; (&quot;vanities&quot;, &quot;idols&quot;) for &quot;gods&quot; in Old English sources implies the existence of &quot;*uuani&quot; (a reconstructed cognate to Old Norse &quot;Vanir&quot;) in Deiran dialect and hence that the gods that Edwin of Northumbria and the northern Angles worshiped in pre-Christian Anglo-Saxon England were likely to have been the *&quot;uuani&quot;. He comments that they likely &quot;shared not only the name but also the orgiastic character of the [Old Icelandic] &quot;Vanir&quot;&quot;.

Alaric Hall has equated the Vanir with the elves.

===Rudolf Simek&#x27;s &quot;Vanir Obituary&quot;===
In a 2010 piece building on an earlier proposal by Lotte Motz, Rudolf Simek argues that &quot;vanir&quot; was originally nothing more than a general term for deities like &quot;æsir&quot;, and that its employment as a name for a distinct group of deities was an invention of Snorri, whom he identifies as the author of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;. According to Simek, the Vanir are therefore &quot;a figment of imagination from the 13th to 20th centuries&quot;. Simek states that he &quot;believe[s] that these are not mistakes that we are dealing with here, but a deliberate invention on the part of Snorri&quot;.

Simek&#x27;s argument receive some level of support from Frog and Jonathan Roper (2011), who analyze the small corpus of poetic usages of &quot;Vanir&quot;. The authors suggest that this implies that &quot;vanir&quot; was a &quot;suspended archaism&quot; used as a metrical alternative to &quot;Æsir&quot; but with the caveat that &quot;These observations should not, however, be considered to present a solution to the riddle of &quot;vanir&quot;&quot;. In a collection of papers in honor of Simek, Frog (2021) states support for Simek&#x27;s proposal.

However, Simek&#x27;s proposal has been rejected by several scholars, including Clive Tolley, Leszek P. Słupecki, Jens Peter Schjødt, and Terry Gunnell. Tolley argues that the term must have originated in historical usage, and that &quot;it is something of a misrepresentation of the evidence to suggest that Snorri is the main source for the &quot;vanir&quot;&quot;. Tolley continues:

: &quot;the evidence affords opportunity to interpret the &quot;vanir&quot; as a class of beings with a cohesive functionality, as I have attempted to show. In turn, since this functionality can be shown to mirror concerns with a widespread occurrence within comparative religious studies, there is good reason for maintaining the importance of the &quot;vanir&quot; as a discrete group of divine beings. I would even venture to suggest that—far from being minor characters in the Norse pantheon, as Simek and others believe—the &quot;vanir&quot; are likely to have been involved in the most intimate and central aspects of human existence, as my analysis of their functions shows.
: It may well be for this very reason that Christian missionaries such as St. Óláfr were intent upon their eradication, leaving us so little information. If, as &quot;Vǫluspá&quot; intimates, the &quot;vanir&quot; were particularly the &quot;sweet scent&quot;, the darlings, of women, there may have been even greater incentive for the new muscular and masculine Christianity to ensure their demise, as a cult fostered by the guardians of the home would be a serious threat to the spread of the new religion.&quot;

Słupecki argues that the Vanir remained distinct from the Æsir – except for Freyja and Freyr, whom he follows the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; in seeing as having been born after Njörðr became a hostage among the Æsir, and thus regards as Æsir – and therefore that Ragnarök &quot;[has] no importance for their world&quot;.

According to Jens Peter Schjødt,
:&quot;even if the term Vanir were not in existence in pagan times, it does not change substantially the fact that in pre-Christian Scandinavian mythology we deal with two groups of gods who sometimes overlap, whereas at other times they are clearly distinguished, just as to be expected in an anthropomorphic mythology. It would be wrong to look for coherence in any mythology. As I have considered in more detail elsewhere, what we can realistically hope to reconstruct is not a coherent mythological or theological system, as this seems to be more of an ideal dream among scholars who are strongly influenced by an older sort of theology, but rather a set of variants that may be part of a deep structure, although with internal contradictions among the various myth-complexes and various &#x27;loose ends&#x27;. In the real world, among real people, such coherence is, as a general rule, absent.&quot;

Schjødt, in response to Simek&#x27;s piece, says:
:&quot;the conclusion, in relation to Simek&#x27;s article would be, then, that even if he should be right about the Vanir, we would still be better off if we had a designation for the gods we have traditionally seen as belonging to the Vanir group. And perhaps &quot;Vanir&quot;, then, in spite of all the uncertainties that accrue to it, would still be the most convenient term.&quot;

Terry Gunnell proposes that the Vanir&#x27;s
:&quot;recurring patterns in the narratives nonetheless imply that in the oral traditions of Norway and Iceland, people seem to have viewed the religious activities connected with the &#x27;Vanir&#x27; (with their center in Sweden) as having been different in nature to those encountered elsewhere. They also seem to have been envisioned closer connections between the Vanir and the landscape than existed between the Æsir and the natural environment.&quot;

Gunnell concludes that
:&quot;this evidence lends weight to the argument that, in spite of recent arguments to the contrary, the religion associated with the Vanir and Æsir gods had a different nature and origin.&quot;

==Modern influence==
The Vanir are featured in the poem &quot;Om vanerne&quot; by Oehlenschläger (1819). Some Germanic Neopagans refer to their beliefs as &quot;Vanatrú&quot; (meaning &quot;those who honor the Vanir&quot;).

<text>Ferdinand I (Ferdinand Maximilian Karl Leopold Maria; 26 February 1861 – 10 September 1948) was Prince of Bulgaria from 1887 to 1908 and Tsar of Bulgaria from 1908 until his abdication in 1918. Under his rule, Bulgaria entered the First World War on the side of the Central Powers in 1915.

==Family background==

Ferdinand was born on 26 February 1861 in Vienna, a German prince of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha-Koháry. He was the son of Prince August of Saxe-Coburg and his wife Clémentine of Orléans, daughter of King Louis Philippe I of the French. Princess Maria Antonia Koháry was a Hungarian Noble and heiress who married Ferdinand&#x27;s grandfather, Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Ferdinand was raised in his parents’ Catholic faith and baptised in St. Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral, Vienna on 27 February, having as godparents Archduke Maximilian of Austria and his wife Princess Charlotte of Belgium. He grew up in the cosmopolitan environment of Austro-Hungarian high nobility and also in their ancestral lands in Hungary and in Germany. The House of Koháry descended from an immensely wealthy Upper Hungarian noble family, who held the princely lands of Čabraď and Sitno in present-day Slovakia, among others. The family&#x27;s property was augmented by Clémentine of Orléans&#x27; remarkable dowry.

Ferdinand was a grandnephew of Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and of Leopold I, first king of the Belgians. His father August was a brother of King Ferdinand II of Portugal, and also a first cousin to Queen Victoria, her husband Albert, Empress Carlota of Mexico and her brother Leopold II of Belgium. These last two, Leopold and Carlota, were also first cousins of Ferdinand I&#x27;s through his mother, a princess of Orléans. This made the Belgian siblings his first cousins, as well as his first cousins once removed. Indeed, the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha had contrived to occupy, either by marriage or by direct election, several European thrones in the course of the 19th century. Following the family trend, Ferdinand was himself to found the royal dynasty of Bulgaria.

==Prince of Bulgaria==
The previous ruling prince of Bulgaria, Alexander of Battenberg, had abdicated in 1886 after a pro-Russian coup, only seven years after he had been elected. Ferdinand, who was an officer in the Austro-Hungarian army, was elected Prince of autonomous Bulgaria by its Grand National Assembly on 7 July 1887 in the Gregorian calendar (the &quot;New Style&quot; used hereinafter). The throne had been previously offered, before Ferdinand&#x27;s acceptance, to princes from Denmark to the Caucasus and even to the King of Romania. The Russian tsar himself had nominated his aide, Nichols Dadian of Mingrelia, but his candidacy was rejected by the Bulgarians. Ferdinand&#x27;s accession was greeted with disbelief in many of the royal houses of Europe; Queen Victoria, his father&#x27;s first cousin, stated to her prime minister, &quot;He is totally unfit ... delicate, eccentric and effeminate ... Should be stopped at once.&quot; To the amazement of his initial detractors, Ferdinand generally gave a good account of himself during the first two decades of his reign.

Bulgaria&#x27;s domestic political life was dominated during the early years of Ferdinand&#x27;s reign by liberal party leader Stefan Stambolov, whose foreign policy saw a marked cooling in relations with Russia, formerly seen as Bulgaria&#x27;s protector.

Stambolov&#x27;s fall (May 1894) and subsequent assassination (July 1895) - probably not engineered by Ferdinand - paved the way for a reconciliation of Bulgaria with Russia, effected in February 1896 with Ferdinand&#x27;s decision to convert his infant son, Prince Boris, from Roman Catholicism to Eastern Orthodoxy. However, this earned him the animosity of his Catholic Austrian relatives, and he was excommunicated by Pope Leo XIII.

==Tsar of Bulgaria==

On 5 October 1908 (celebrated on 22 September), Ferdinand proclaimed Bulgaria&#x27;s &quot;de jure&quot; independence from the Ottoman Empire (though the country had been &quot;de facto&quot; independent since 1878). He also proclaimed Bulgaria a kingdom, and assumed the title of &quot;tsar&quot;—a deliberate nod to the rulers of the earlier Bulgarian states. However, while the title &quot;tsar&quot; was translated as &quot;emperor&quot; in the First and Second Bulgarian empires, it was translated as &quot;king&quot; under Ferdinand and his successors. The Bulgarian Declaration of Independence was proclaimed by him at the Holy Forty Martyrs Church in Tarnovo, and was recognized by the Ottoman Empire and the other European powers. The Tarnovo Constitution was retained, with the word &quot;prince&quot; replaced by the word &quot;&quot;tsar&quot;.&quot;

On a visit to German Emperor Wilhelm II, his second cousin once removed, in 1909, Ferdinand was leaning out of a window of the New Palace in Potsdam when the Emperor came up behind him and slapped him on the bottom. Ferdinand was affronted by the gesture, but the Kaiser refused to apologize. Ferdinand however exacted his revenge by awarding a valuable arms contract he had intended to give to the Krupp&#x27;s factory in Essen to French arms manufacturer Schneider-Creusot. Another incident occurred on his journey to the funeral of his second cousin King Edward VII of the United Kingdom in 1910. A tussle broke out over where his private railway carriage would be positioned in relation to the heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Archduke Franz Ferdinand. The Archduke won out, having his carriage positioned directly behind the engine. Ferdinand&#x27;s was placed directly behind his. Realising the dining car of the train was behind his own carriage, Ferdinand obtained his revenge on the Archduke by refusing him passage through his own carriage to the dining car. On 15 July the same year during a visit to Belgium, Ferdinand also became the first head of state to fly in an airplane. He awarded the pilot of the plane with a medal when they landed.

== Balkan Wars (1912–1913) ==

Like many other rulers before him, Ferdinand desired the creation of a &quot;new Byzantium&quot;, a desire that has to be interpreted as wanting to create a significant, essentially Christian, Balkan power, given that Bulgaria and Bulgarians had neither cultural, ethnic, historical nor linguistic affinity with the old Byzantine Empire, which was quintessentially Roman and, evolving through the centuries, Greek. In 1912, Ferdinand joined the other Balkan states in an assault on the Ottoman Empire to free occupied territories. He saw this war as a new crusade declaring it, &quot;a just, great and sacred struggle of the Cross against the Crescent.&quot; Bulgaria contributed the most and also lost the greatest number of soldiers. The Great Powers insisted on the creation of an independent Albania. Though the Balkan League allies had fought together against the common enemy in the First Balkan War, that was not enough to overcome their mutual rivalries. In the original documents for the Balkan League, Serbia had been pressured by Bulgaria to hand over most of Vardar Macedonia after it had conquered it from the Ottoman Empire. However Serbia, in response to the new Albanian state receiving territory in the north that it had expected to gain for itself, said that it would keep possession of the areas that its forces had occupied. Soon after, Bulgaria began the Second Balkan War when it invaded its recent allies Serbia and Greece to seize disputed areas, before being attacked itself by Romania and the Ottoman Empire. Although Bulgaria was defeated, the 1913 Treaty of Bucharest granted the Kingdom some territorial gains. The region of Western Thrace, giving access to the Aegean Sea was secured.

== First World War and abdication (1915–1918) ==
On 11 October 1915, the Bulgarian army attacked Serbia after signing a treaty with Austria-Hungary and Germany stating that Bulgaria would gain the territory it sought at the expense of Serbia. While he was not an admirer of German Emperor Wilhelm II or Austrian Emperor Franz Josef I—whom he described as &quot;that idiot, that old dotard of a Francis Joseph&quot;.—Ferdinand wanted additional territorial gains after the humiliation of the Balkan Wars. This also entailed forming an alliance with his former enemy, the Ottoman Empire. This ranging of his country with the Central Powers made him a de facto supporter of Germany&#x27;s war aims and was not well received by the Allies. Edmund Gosse wrote:

“In this war, where the ranks of the enemy present to us so many formidable, sinister, and shocking figures, there is one, and perhaps but one, which is purely ridiculous. If we had the heart to relieve our strained feelings by laughter, it would be at the gross Coburg traitor, with his bodyguard of assassins and his hidden coat-of-mail, his shaking hands and his painted face. The world has never seen a meaner scoundrel, and we may almost bring ourselves to pity the Kaiser, whom circumstances have forced to accept on equal terms a potentate so verminous.”

During the initial phase of World War I, the Tsardom of Bulgaria achieved several decisive victories over its enemies and laid claim to the disputed territories of Macedonia after Serbia&#x27;s defeat. For the next two years, the Bulgarian army shifted its focus towards repelling Allied advances from nearby Greece. They were also partially involved in the 1916 conquest of neighboring Romania, now ruled by another Ferdinand I, who was also Ferdinand&#x27;s first cousin once removed.

To save the Bulgarian monarchy after multiple military setbacks in 1918, Tsar Ferdinand abdicated in favour of his eldest son, who became Tsar Boris III on 3 October 1918. Under new leadership, Bulgaria surrendered to the Entente and, as a consequence, lost not only the additional territory it had fought for in the major conflict, but also the territory it had won after the Balkan Wars giving access to the Aegean Sea.

==Personal life==

Ferdinand married Princess Marie Louise of Bourbon-Parma, daughter of Robert I, Duke of Parma and Princess Maria Pia of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, on 20 April 1893 at the Villa Pianore in Lucca. Steven Constant describes this as a &quot;marriage of convenience&quot;. The marriage produced four children:
* Boris III (1894–1943)
* Kyril (1895–1945)
* Eudoxia (1898–1985)
* Nadezhda (1899–1958).

Marie Louise died on 31 January 1899 after giving birth to her youngest daughter. Ferdinand did not think about remarriage until his mother, Princess Clémentine, died in 1907. To satisfy dynastic obligations and to provide his children with a mother figure, Ferdinand married Princess Eleonore Reuss of Köstritz, on 28 February 1908. Neither romantic love or physical attraction played any role, and Ferdinand treated her as no more than a member of the household, and showed scant regard.

In his private relations, Ferdinand was a somewhat hedonistic individual. He enjoyed affairs with a number of women of humble position, siring a number of illegitimate children whom he then supported financially. In his later life, rumours abounded of Ferdinand&#x27;s trysts with lieutenants and valets. His regular holidays on Capri, then a popular holiday destination with wealthy epicenes, were common knowledge in royal courts throughout Europe.

He was remembered in his cousin&#x27;s memoir: &quot;Prince Ferdinand, who was a Coburg, was a cousin of my father’s, and I remember the latter saying, when we got back to the hotel, that being the youngest of his family he was naturally looked upon as a fool, “ But,” said my father, “ for the fool of the family he has not done so badly for himself and I should not be surprised if he did not prove them all to be wrong.” He was always mocked at by his relations for covering himself with orders and decorations created by himself, and he was rudely nicknamed “ the Christmas-tree,”&quot;

== Exile and death (1918–1948) ==
After his abdication, Ferdinand returned to live in Coburg, Germany. He had managed to salvage much of his fortune and was able to live in some style. He saw his being in exile simply as one of the hazards of kingship. He commented, &quot;Kings in exile are more philosophic under reverses than ordinary individuals; but our philosophy is primarily the result of tradition and breeding, and do not forget that pride is an important item in the making of a monarch. We are disciplined from the day of our birth and taught the avoidance of all outward signs of emotion. The skeleton sits forever with us at the feast. It may mean murder, it may mean abdication, but it serves always to remind us of the unexpected. Therefore we are prepared and nothing comes in the nature of a catastrophe. The main thing in life is to support any condition of bodily or spiritual exile with dignity. If one sups with sorrow, one need not invite the world to see you eat.&quot; He was pleased that the throne could pass to his son. Ferdinand was not displeased with exile and spent much of his time devoted to artistic endeavors, gardening, travel and natural history. In 1922 the Bulgarian government gave former King Ferdinand I, who had been living in exile since 1918, permission to return to Sofia. The Kingdom of Yugoslavia immediately sent an ultimatum objecting to the move.

However, he would live to see the collapse of everything he had held to be precious in life. His eldest son and successor, Boris III, died under mysterious circumstances after returning from a visit to Hitler in Germany in 1943. Boris&#x27; son, Simeon II, succeeded him only to be deposed in 1946, ending the Bulgarian monarchy. The Kingdom of Bulgaria was succeeded by the People&#x27;s Republic of Bulgaria, under which Ferdinand&#x27;s other son, Kyril, was executed. On hearing of Kyril&#x27;s death he said, &quot;Everything is collapsing around me.&quot;

In 1947, Ferdinand (then 86 years old) secretly married his 26-year-old assistant Alžbeta Brezáková in Bamberg, Germany, much to the displeasure of the members of his family. After his death, she returned to her homeland Czechoslovakia, where she remarried and had a daughter. Being afraid of what the communist regime might do to her, she only told her daughter about her marriage to Ferdinand two years before her death. She survived her husband by 67 years and died in Bratislava, Slovakia in 2015.

Ferdinand died in Bürglass-Schlösschen on 10 September 1948 in Coburg, Germany, cradle of the Saxe-Coburg-Gotha dynasty. He was the last surviving grandchild of Louis-Philippe of France. His final wish was to be buried in Bulgaria. However, the Communist authorities in Bulgaria would not allow it, so he was buried in the family crypt in St. Augustin, Coburg.

On 29 May 2024, the remains of Ferdinand I of Bulgaria were transported from Coburg to Sofia by a military plane, which landed at Sofia Airport. They were transported from Germany to Bulgaria by a military aircraft in accordance with the decision adopted by the Council of Ministers. The coffin was taken down and carried by national guards and solemnly placed in a hearse which left for the royal Vrana Palace on the outskirts of Sofia, where Ferdinand I was buried.

<text>Victor Emmanuel I (; 24 July 1759 – 10 January 1824) was the Duke of Savoy, King of Sardinia and ruler of the Savoyard states from 4 June 1802 until his reign ended in 1821 upon abdication due to a liberal revolution. Shortly thereafter, his brother Charles Felix ascended the throne as the new King of Sardinia. Victor Emmanuel was the son of King Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia and his wife, Maria Antonia Ferdinanda of Spain. In 1789, he married Maria Theresa of Austria-Este, with whom he had seven children, including the future Empress of Austria. He was the King of Sardinia during the Napoleonic Wars, where he regained Piedmont after Napoleon&#x27;s defeat in 1814.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Victor Emmanuel was born on 24 July 1754 at the Royal Palace of Turin in Turin, Italy. He was the second son of King Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia, son of King Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia and Polyxena of Hesse-Rotenburg, and his wife, Maria Antonia Ferdinanda of Spain, daughter of King Philip V of Spain and Elisabeth Farnese.

Victor Emmanuel was known from birth as the Duke of Aosta. From 1792 to 1796, Victor Emmanuel’s father had taken an active part in the struggle of the old powers against the revolutionary forces in France but was defeated and forced to make peace, signing the Treaty of Paris. The old king died shortly thereafter, and in December 1798, his eldest son and successor, Charles Emmanuel IV, was faced with a French occupation and eventually annexation, of his mainland territories.
=== Flight to Sardinia and accession ===
Charles Emmanuel and his family were forced to withdraw to Sardinia, which was the only part of his domains not conquered by the French. Charles Emmanuel himself took little interest in the rule of Sardinia, living with his wife on the mainland in Naples and Rome until his wife&#x27;s death in 1802, which led the childless Charles Emmanuel to abdicate the throne in favour of his younger brother.

Victor Emmanuel took the throne on 4 June 1802 as Victor Emmanuel I. He ruled Sardinia from Cagliari for the next twelve years, during which time he constituted the Carabinieri, a Gendarmerie corps, still existing as one of the main branches of the Italy&#x27;s Armed Forces.

In 1814, Napoleon was defeated, and Victor Emmanuel was able to return to Turin. His realm was reconstituted by the Congress of Vienna, with the addition of the territories of the former Republic of Genoa, and well he also wanted to annex Monaco, but it only became a protectorate of his Kingdom. The latter became the seat of the Sardinian Navy. Victor Emmanuel abolished all the freedoms granted by the Napoleonic Codices and restored a fiercely oppressive rule: he restored the &quot;Regie Costituzioni&quot; of Victor Amadeus II and the &quot;Jus commune&quot;, strengthened customs barriers, refused to grant a liberal constitution, entrusted education to the Church and reintroduced laws concerning labour and the justice system which discriminated against Jews and Waldensians.

He nurtured expansionist ambitions in Lombardy, where nationalist anti-Austrian sentiments had developed, promoted largely by the bourgeoisie. This led to conflict with Austria. In March 1821, a liberal revolution exploded in Italy, largely the work of the Carbonari and it seemed that the anti-Austrian attitude of the revolutionaries matched that of Victor Emmanuel.

=== Abdication and later life ===
On Sunday 11 March 1821, the King called a meeting with the council of the crown, of which the members also included one of his distant cousins, Charles Albert. However, Victor Emmanuel was not willing to grant a liberal constitution as desired by the revolutionaries, so he abdicated the next day in favour of his brother, Charles Felix, on 13 March 1821. Because Charles Felix was in Modena at the time, Victor Emmanuel temporarily entrusted the regency to Charles Albert, who was second in line to the throne.

Since his abdication, Victor Emmanuel lived in several cities until 1824, when he returned to the Castle of Moncalieri, where he died. He is buried in the Basilica of Superga.

==Family and children==

On 21 April 1789, he married Archduchess Maria Teresa of Austria-Este, daughter of Ferdinand, Duke of Modena (who was the son of Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor).

They had six daughters and one son who died very young:

# &quot;Maria Beatrice&quot; Victoria Josepha of Savoy (6 December 1792 – 15 September 1840); married her uncle Francis IV, Archduke of Austria and Duke of Modena.
# &quot;Maria Adelaide&quot; Clothilde Xaveria Borbonia of Savoy (1 October 1794 – 2 August 1795); died in infancy.
# Charles Emanuel (3 September 1796 – 9 August 1799); died of smallpox, died in early childhood.
# A daughter (13 November 1800 – 10 January 1801)
# &quot;Maria Teresa&quot; Fernanda Felicitas Gaetana Pia of Savoy (19 September 1803 – 16 July 1879); married Charles II, Duke of Parma (1799–1883).
# &quot;Maria Anna&quot; Ricciarda Carlotta Margherita Pia of Savoy (19 September 1803 – 4 May 1884); married Ferdinand I of Austria.
# &quot;Maria Cristina&quot; Carlotta Giuseppina Gaetana Elise of Savoy (14 November 1812 – 21 January 1836); married Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies.

As a descendant of Henrietta of England, he carried the Jacobite claim to the thrones of England and Scotland.

<text>Charles Felix (; 6 April 1765 – 27 April 1831) was the King of Sardinia and ruler of the Savoyard states from 12 March 1821 until his death in 1831. He was the last male-line member of the House of Savoy that started with Victor Amadeus I, and caused the line of Victor Amadeus I&#x27;s younger brother Thomas Francis to seize the throne after Felix&#x27;s death.

==Early life==

Charles Felix was born in Turin as the eleventh child and fifth son born to Victor Amadeus III of Savoy and Maria Antonia Ferdinanda of Spain. His paternal grandparents were Charles Emmanuel III of Savoy and his German wife Polyxena of Hesse-Rotenburg. His maternal grandparents were French-born King Philip V of Spain and his Italian wife, Elisabeth Farnese.

He was a younger brother of two other rulers of Savoy Charles Emmanuel IV and Victor Emmanuel I. He spent his childhood with his sister Maria Carolina and his younger brother, Giuseppe Benedetto Placido, Count of Moriana, at the Castle of Moncalieri.

From his youth, Carlo Felice was reported as having a very complex character: on the one hand consistent and inflexible, private, distrustful, and impulsive, if not touchy and vindictive; on the other hand honest, sincere, and capable of emotion and fondness. He had a clever mind, at times even ironic. He possessed a sacral conception of the monarchy and the right to reign.

During the years of the French Revolution and the Italian campaign, Charles Felix formed part of a &quot;parallel court&quot; opposed to Charles Emmanuel IV&#x27;s circle, along with his brother Victor Emmanuel, the latter&#x27;s wife Maria Theresa, Maurizio Giuseppe Duke of Monferrat, and Giuseppe Placido, count of Moriana.

In this period, Charles Felix began to keep a personal diary, which is an important source for events and his conflicts with the court in Savoy.

== Italian campaign (1792–1798) ==
When war broke out with France, Charles Felix did not distinguish himself as a soldier, despite having received a military education. In 1792, after the French occupation of the Duchy of Savoy and the county of Nice, he followed the troops to Saluzzo and in 1793, he accompanied his father, Victor Amadeus III, who had directed the operations for the reconquest of Nice and Savoy along with the Austrians under general J. de Vins, into the Susa Valley, to Pinerolo, Cuneo, and Tende.

Charles Felix remained very far from the front lines in any case. In spring 1794, after the arrival in Aosta of his brother the Duke of Monferrat, Charles Felix and Giuseppe Placido went to Morgex in order to retake some positions of relative strategic importance, but they did not achieve anything.

On 28 April 1796, Victor Amadeus III was forced to sign the Armistice of Cherasco with the French, which was followed by the Treaty of Paris on 15 May, which accepted French control of Nice, Savoy, Genevoise, and some fortresses. Charles Felix, who had been titled Duke of Genoa, obtained the title of Marquis of Susa in compensation for his nominal loss.

Victor Amadeus III died in October of the same year and was succeeded as Prince of Piedmont by Charles Emmanuel IV. The relationship between the new king and Charles Felix had never been good but now deteriorated as the king strove to keep his brothers in the dark about affairs of the state.

Two years into his reign, Charles Emmanuel IV was forced to surrender all royal control on the mainland. Along with the king and the rest of the royal family, Charles Felix left Turin on the evening of 9 December 1798 for Cagliari, where they arrived on 3 March 1799.

== Viceroy of Sardinia (1799–1814) ==

Charles Emmanuel IV was childless and, after the death of his wife, he abdicated in favour of his brother Victor Emmanuel I on 4 June 1802. The latter did not take possession of the domains in Sardinia himself, preferring to entrust them to Charles Felix as viceroy.

Charles Felix&#x27;s government of Sardinia was rather rigid and authoritarian. Since the in 1794, the island had experienced a period of disorder, exacerbated by widespread poverty, which had led to an increase in crime, which the viceroy suppressed with notable harshness, writing to his brother the king, &quot;slaughter, slaughter, for the good of the human race.&quot;

Charles Felix established a military regime, such that his Sardinian subjects referred to him as &quot;Carlo Feroce&quot; (Charles the Ferocious). The tool of this regime was the special court of the Viceregal delegation for the investigation of political proceedings, which took action immediately against the &quot;capopolo&quot; (popular leader), Vincenzo Sulis, who was guilty of nothing other than having been more successful than the viceroy in defeating the revolutionary movements. When Sulis was condemned to twenty years in gaol, the viceroy considered it a lenient sentence. Furthermore, in the persecution of &quot;state criminals,&quot; Charles Felix legitimated the adoption of military procedures and granted every power to the police, from spying to censoring letters and placing bounties on suspects.

In his reorganisation work, however, he displayed notable energy to control the autonomy of the judiciary and the local bureaucracy and managed to correct some abuses of the feudal regime.

In fact, when the Stamenti, the parliament of the kingdom, voted to pay a tax of 400,000 lire, Charles Felix exerted significant pressure to have the poorest classes exempted from the tax and he judged disputes in feudal jurisdiction in favour of vassals rather than feudal lords. When an anti-feudal revolt took place against the Duke of Asinara, who had refused to conform to the regulations of the viceroy, Charles Felix decided to punish both the duke, who was stripped of his property, as well as the revolutionaries.

Despite the precarious political and social situation, Charles Felix was able to bring some improvements to the agriculture and economy of the island. Under his rule, an agrarian society and an office for the administration of Crown mines and forests were established. Additionally, the farming of olives was encouraged and commercial contracts were granted to encourage local production. Finally, he began a project to systematise the road network.

== Marriage and return to Turin (1814–1821) ==

On 7 March 1807, in the Cappella Palatina of the Palazzo dei Normanni in Palermo, Charles Felix married by proxy Maria Cristina of Naples and Sicily (17 January 1779 - 11 March 1849), daughter of Ferdinand IV King of Naples and Sicily and Maria Carolina of Austria.

The marriage, which had originally been opposed by Charles Felix, had been arranged for dynastic reasons. Neither Charles Emmanuel nor Victor Emmanuel had male children (the son of the latter had become sick and died in Sardinia), while the Duke of Montferrat and the Count of Morian were deceased, so Charles Felix had become the heir presumptive and therefore had to produce a male heir.

Although the marriage to Maria Cristina proved harmonious, she was unable to have children, forcing Victor Emmanuel to consider the succession of Charles Albert, Prince of Carignano, from a collateral line of the House of Savoy.

After the fall of Napoleon and the return of Victor Emmanuel to Turin on 20 May 1814, Charles Felix joined him for a brief period before returning to Sardinia the following year with his wife. He formally retained the role of Viceroy until 1821, although he returned to the court in Turin after a short period.

== Revolution of 1821 ==
=== Origin ===
Following revolts in Cadiz in 1820, King Ferdinand VII of Spain was forced to restore the Spanish Constitution of 1812 and the hope of obtaining similar concessions from their own sovereigns arose in many European states. Insurrections broke out in Naples and Palermo.

The initial indications of the crisis were confirmed on 11 January 1821 when four students were stopped by the police at a theatre performance in Turin because they were wearing red caps with black bows, a symbol of the carboneria. The young men offered resistance and were arrested, provoking a large brawl.

The next day, all the students and many of their teachers protested, calling for the release of the youths and, when this was refused, they blockaded themselves in the university and the government was forced to call in the army. Although nobody was killed, the wounded were very numerous and the situation escalated.

A connection was made between the protestors and the secret society of the &quot;Federati&quot;, whose leaders Santorre di Rossi, Giacinto Collegno, Carlo Emanuele Asinari, and Guglielmo Moffa di Lisio Gribaldi (all soldiers, officials, or sons of ministers) and Roberto d&#x27;Azeglio met with Charles Albert on 6 March. They were ready to act, having identified the prince as a new man for the House of Savoy, who might be willing to break with the absolutist past.

The goal of the conspirators was not to abolish the House of Savoy, but to induce it to enact political and social reforms and then undertake a war against Austria, which seemed possible in light of the deeply anti-Austrian sentiments of the Victor Emmanuel I.

In this, the conspirators took advantage of the absence of Charles Felix, who they thought would have been able to induce Victor Emmanuel to oppose their plans. They planned to raise the army, surround the royal residence at Moncalieri castle and force him to grant a constitution and declare war on Austria. The role of Charles Albert would have been to mediate between the conspirators and the king, but the following morning, he changed his mind and attempted to escape from the conspirators, although he did not disavow them.

=== Beginning of the revolt ===
The conspirators grew suspicious and prepared to cancel the insurrection which they had planned for the 10th. The same day, Charles Albert, completely penitent, raced to Moncalieri in order to confess everything to Victor Emmanuel and beg for pardon. In the night the garrison of Alessandria, commanded by one of the conspirators, Guglielmo Ansaldi, rebelled and occupied the city. Although they had been abandoned by the Prince, the rest of the revolutionaries decided to act at this point.

=== Abdication of Victor Emmanuel and regency of Charles Albert ===

On Sunday 11 March 1821, King Victor Emmanuel I met with the Crown Council, of which Charles Albert was a member. As a result of the king&#x27;s indecision, no action was taken.

On 12 March, the Citadel of Turin fell into the hands of the rebels. Victor Emmanuel encouraged Charles Albert and Cesare Balbo to negotiate with the Carbonari, who refused to listen to their messages. Thus, in the evening, in the face of the spreading military uprising, the king abdicated in favour of his brother Charles Felix. Since the latter was in Modena at the time, Charles Albert was appointed regent.

The abdication of the king, which followed the dismissal of the ministers of state, led to chaos because it created a dynastic crisis which foreign powers would not ignore and because it split the army and bureaucracy, preventing every possibility of maintaining order.

The regent tried to take control by naming a new government (the lawyer, Ferdinando del Pozzo (1768-1843) as Minister of the Interior, general Emanuele Pes di Villamarina as minister of war, and Lodovico Sauli d&#x27;Igliano as minister of foreign affairs) and attempted to negotiate with the rebels, but he achieved nothing.

Given the impossibility of taking any decisions without the agreement of the new king, Charles Albert sent Charles Felix an account of the events, seeking instructions, but the letter took a very long time to reach its destination.

Fearful of becoming the object of popular anger, on the evening of 13 March 1821, Charles Albert signed a decree granting a constitution along the lines of the Spanish constitution of 1812, which would not become law until approved by the king.

The next day, the regent decided to form a junta, which was to protect the parliament. Two days after that, he swore to observe the Spanish Constitution, in a Savoyard version which had been slightly altered according to the requests of Victor Emmanuel&#x27;s consort, Maria Therese.

===Intervention of Charles Felix ===
At this point, Charles Felix, who had now received the letter from Charles Albert notifying him of his brother&#x27;s abdication, decided to act. He told the messenger not to address him as &quot;majesty&quot;, then asserted that since the abdication had been extracted through violence, it could not be considered valid. Finally, he said, &quot;tell the Prince that, if there is still a drop of our royal blood in his veins, he should set out for Novara immediately and wait there for my orders.&quot;

As for the Spanish constitution, he declared any sovereign acts taken after the abdication of his brother to be null and void, and then he issued the following proclamation, &quot;Far from consenting to any change in the pre-existing form of government with the nominal abdication of the king, our beloved brother, we consider all the royal subjects who have aided or abetted the traitors or who have presumed to proclaim a constitution, to be rebels.&quot;

Charles Albert, deeply discouraged, did as Charles Felix commanded, went to Novara, and issued a proclamation renouncing the regency and calling on everyone to submit to Charles Felix. On the 29th, he received a letter from Charles Felix ordering him to depart with his family for Florence.

With Charles Albert out of the way, Charles Felix dispatched several letters to Francis I of Austria, asking him to send troops in order to suppress the revolt.

On 3 April, he issued a second proclamation which granted a pardon to the soldiers while applying strict sanctions to rebel officials, which ultimately, prevented any form of compromise. Chancellor Metternich himself said to Francis IV of Modena that this proclamation had been imprudent and was written &quot;with animosity, passion, and hatred.&quot;

The rebels, realising that no other option remained for them, marched on Novara, where the forces loyal to Charles Felix were gathered under the command of Vittorio Sallier de La Tour. This, inevitably, convinced Metternich to intervene.

On 8 April there was a battle (Noara-Borgo Vercelli) with the troops of de La Tour and then with those of the Austrian general Ferdinand von Bubna, who occupied Vercelli and Alessandria on 11 April, while de La Tour, who had received full powers from Charles Felix, occupied Turin on the 10th.

On 19 April, despite pressure from the emperors of Russia and Austria, Metternich, Charles Albert, Francis IV, and Charles Felix himself (who hated the idea of receiving the crown &quot;thanks&quot; to rebels), Victor Emmanuel reaffirmed his abdication. Thus, on 25 April, Charles Felix acceded to the throne.

===Suppression===
Once control of Turin was re-established, Charles Felix, who was still in Modena, entered into personal communication with the Emperor of Austria in order to obtain recognition from the Congress of Laibach, which was then in session, that he would be able to assume full control of his possessions, as an absolute monarch, and that Austria would not be allowed to interfere in any way in his territories.

At the subsequent Congress of Verona, Charles Felix feared pressure for constitutional changes and reiterated in his instructions to his ambassadors that the repression of the &quot;revolutionary spirit&quot; inspired by the Congress of Laibach belonged exclusively to him and that he was firmly convinced of the necessity of this obligation.

Having decided to remain at Modena, he appointed Ignazio Thaon di Revel as Lieutenant General of the Kingdom, and placed G. Piccono della Valle and G.C. Brignole in charge of foreign affairs and financial affairs respectively.

Finally, he began the suppression of opposition. The following extract from the work of Guido Astuti describes his actions:
Finally, the king instituted three different jurisdictions: a mixed civil and military tribunal called the Royal Delegation with penal powers, a military commission for investigating the conduct of officers and non-commissioned officers, and a scrutiny commission for investigating the conduct of every employee of the kingdom.

The Royal Delegation sat from 7 May to early October, in which time it issued 71 death sentences, 5 sentences of life imprisonment, and 20 sentences of imprisonment for 5 to 20 years. After the delegation&#x27;s dissolution, the senate issued a further 24 death sentences, 5 sentences of life imprisonment, and another 12 sentences of imprisonment for 15–20 years. By the end of October the military commission had dismissed 627 officers.

The scrutiny commission, divided into a superior tribunal and seven divisional boards of scrutiny, issued numerous dismissals and suspensions of civil servants and professors of every kind of school, whom it found particularly culpable.

On the instructions of the minister of the interior, Roget de Cholex, the University of Turin was closed and many professors received severe admonitions because, as the king wrote in a letter to his brother (9 May 1822): &quot;everyone who has studied at the university is entirely corrupt: the professors are detestable, but there is no way to replace them... Thus the bad are all taught and the good are all ignorant.&quot;.

In any case, although an oppressive climate was established, accompanied by the habituation to accusations and the diversity of political ideas, offering a pretext for pursuing private vendettas, the royal authority, especially the governor of Genoa, Giorgio Des Geneys, did not prevent people from fleeing. Of all the people who were condemned, only two were executed.

Further, it is reported by a letter of the Count d&#x27;Agliè that Charles Felix never prevented anyone from secretly passing subsidies to condemned men who had gone into exile and Angelo Brofferio reports that when the king discovered that one of these subsidies was going to the family of one of the two individuals who had been executed in 1821, the king doubled the sum.

The suppression of opposition was terminated on 30 September 1821, when Charles Felix issued a pardon of all individuals who had been implicated in the revolt, excluding the leaders, the financiers and those who had been found guilty of homicide or extortion. A few days later, Charles Felix entered Turin.

== Reign (1821–1831) ==
Even before he reached Turin, Charles Felix repudiated the Regent&#x27;s promise and, to help restore order, he called in the Austrians, who stayed in Piedmont till 1823. In that same year, Charles Albert went to Spain to extinguish by force of arms the last sparks of revolt, making himself an object of hatred as the betrayer of Italian liberalism, but regaining the confidence of the King, who might have chosen another successor.

Charles Felix was a true reactionary, convinced that the world would soon be swept clean of all those - in his view - wicked and sacrilegious innovations introduced by the French Revolution and diffused throughout Europe by Napoleon Bonaparte &quot;the rascal&quot; as he called him.

=== Internal policy ===

Charles Felix was rarely present in Turin as king and did not participate in the social life of the capital, since he had never sought the throne and had no particular affection for the Turinese, whom he considered to have proven themselves traitors to the dynasty through their support for Napoleon and the constitutional protests.

In practice, he resided in Turin only during the theatre season and he spent the rest of the time travelling around Savoy, Nice, Genoa (one of his favourite residences) and the castles of Govone and Agliè, which he had inherited from his sister Maria Anna.

As a result, the king tended to delegate large amounts of power to his ministers, especially Count Roget de Cholex, Minister of the Interior, reserving a supervisory role for himself. His government was characterised by Massimo d&#x27;Azeglio as follows:

Nevertheless, the king was not entirely unaware of the need for reform and certainly exerted himself in the defense of the Piedmontese realm from Pontifical and foreign intervention. He limited the privileges and exemptions of the church, which seemed harmful to the state, almost completely abolished the right of sanctuary in holy places, granted secular courts the right to hear cases against priests, and imposed civic oversight of catechisms, sermons, and religious books.

Regarding the issue of church property which had been secularised in 1792 (with Papal consent) and Franciscan property which had been secularised unilaterally, the king appointed an extraordinary board composed of officials and supporters of the clergy. The proposals, delivered to Pope Leo XII by ambassador-extraordinary Filiberto Avogadro di Collobiano in December 1827, were examined by a council of cardinals, who rejected some financial details and the right of the state to dispose of the property freely. However, on 1 April 1828, the king summoned a new council, to which he professed flexibility on the financial issues and rigidity on the issue of disposal. The resulting agreement was approved on 14 May 1828 by the Holy See.

There were also important legislative reforms, which were effected by the Edict of 16 July 1822, which reformed mortgages; the Edict of 27 August 1822, which unified the military penal law; and the Edict of 27 September 1822, which reformed the judicial system. These changes were capped by the &quot;Civil and Criminal Laws of the Kingdom of Sardinia&quot;, signed on 16 January 1827, which replaced the dated Carta de Logu.

In fact, while Victor Emmanuel had implemented a rigid counter-revolution, which uncritically revoked every arrangement made by the French after the abdication of Charles Emmanuel IV, the state could not continue to ignore the will of the majority of its subjects who called for laws in accordance with the ideas and needs of their contemporary world. Some reforms to fill the gaps were necessary.

Thus, on 27 September 1822, after Charles Felix had re-established the publication of mortgages and codified the military penal law, he promulgated an Edict on the reform of the civil judicial system - excluding Sardinia.

The edict abolished a majority of the special jurisdictions (e.g. for gambling offences, or management of ports), instituted 40 collegial prefecture tribunals (which managed 416 &quot;district courts&quot;), with original jurisdiction, which were divided into four classes, according to the importance of the area, and he entrusted instruction of the procedures to special members of these tribunals. Civil and penal jurisdiction remained with the Senate in Turin and fiscal jurisdiction with the Court of Audit.

In addition, a single appellate jurisdiction was introduced, eliminating the multiplicity of appeals that had previously existed and the ministerial position of fiscal advocate was introduced.

Finally, he made the act of taking a case to court free, however inadequately, replacing the old system of the &quot;sportula&quot;, which was a very heavy judicial fee, calculated on the basis of the seriousness of the case, which provided the judges&#x27; pay, with a regular system of salaries paid by the state.

Another important change was the code of civil and criminal law of the Kingdom of Sardinia promulgated on 16 January 1827, mainly as a result of the work of the Count of Cholex. The code was prepared in Turin by the Supreme Council of Sardinia. It was then examined by an appropriate Sardinian committee and the Reale Udienza of Sardinia. The result was a confection of Sardinian and mainland sources, creating a law which was both traditional and novel.

The most novel changes relate to penal law: the abolition of the &quot;giudatico&quot; (impunity for criminals who had arrested other criminals) and the &quot;esemplarità&quot; (cruel extensions of the death penalty, like quartering the corpse and scattering the ashes); restrictions on the imposition of the death penalty; affirmation of the principle that the punishment should fit the crime; and the distinction between attempted crimes and crimes actually committed.

Finally, the slave trade was abolished and it was declared that any person who was found in captivity on a ship flying the Sardinian flag would instantly be freed.

=== Economic initiatives ===

Charles Felix&#x27;s reign was characterised by financial and economic difficulties and rigid protectionism, but there were some initiatives relating to services and public works.

The road network was improved by the construction of the road between Cagliari and Sassari (now Strada statale 131 Charles Felix) and between Genoa and Nice, as well as bridges over the Bormida and the Ticino (the latter completed in 1828). A large number of public buildings were constructed in the cities: the port of Nice was largely restored, Genoa received a theatre (the Teatro Carlo Felice, named after the king), and Turin benefited from a programme of urban improvement which included the bridge over the Dora, the Piazza Carlo Felice, underground drainage channels, the porticos of the Piazza Castello and various new suburbs.

Charles Felix paid attention to the steelworking sector, which had already occupied him as Viceroy, as well as the banking and insurance sectors, which were improved significantly by the creation of the Cassa di Risparmio di Torino in 1827 and the establishment of the Royal Mutual Society of Insurers in June 1829. He also encouraged the agricultural and manufacturing sector by granting many exemptions and fiscal benefits and through the creation of trade fairs like that of 1829, in which 500 exhibitors participated.

=== Foreign policy ===
Theoretically, Charles Felix was committed to the territorial expansion of his realm, but he did not maintain any expansionist illusions and preferred to concentrate on the economic and commercial interests of his realm. Thus in 1821, with the help of the Austrians and English, he signed an advantageous trade agreement with the Sublime Porte.

In September 1825, in order to force the Bey of Tripoli to observe the treaty established with him in 1816 under English auspices, and to respect Sardinian ships sailing along the coast of North Africa, he launched a demonstration of force. Towards the end of the month, two frigates (&quot;Commercio&quot; and &quot;Cristina&quot;), a corvette (&quot;Tritone&quot;) and a brig (&quot;Nereide&quot;) under the command of captain Francesco Sivori, appeared off the coast of Tripoli. After a final attempt to pressure the Bey diplomatically, ten Sardinian longboats sailed into the harbour on the night of 27 September and set fire to a Tripolitanian brig and two schooners, routing or killing the Tripolitanian troops. This forced the Bey to take a more conciliatory approach.

In 1828, he ended the construction of a bridge over the River Ticino at Boffalora, which had been begun by his brother Victor Emmanuel I some years earlier as a result of a treaty with the Emperor of Austria, who controlled the other side of the river as part of the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia.

=== Patronage ===

Charles Felix was an avid patron of art and culture. In 1824, he acquired Hautecombe Abbey, where many of his ancestors were buried and entrusted a restoration programme to the architect Ernesto Melano.

In the same year, he was responsible for the acquisition of a good part of the collection which now constitutes the Museo Egizio in Turin. The pieces were acquired from Bernardino Drovetti, a native of Barbania, who was then the French consul in Egypt. The collection was placed in the Palazzo dell&#x27;Accademia delle Scienze, which is still the site of the museum.

In 1827, Charles Felix instituted the Chamber of Commerce and the School of Palaeography and Diplomacy, affiliated with the Academy of Painting and Sculpture.

==Death and succession==
Charles Felix died without issue on 27 April 1831, in Turin at the Palazzo Chablais which had been given to him by his sister Princess Maria Anna, Duchess of Chablais, after a reign of ten years. He was buried at Hautecombe Abbey in Savoy, where his wife was also buried in 1849. With his death, the main line of the House of Savoy became extinct. He was succeeded by the senior male member of the House of Savoy-Carignano, the regent Charles Albert (1798-1849). The selection of Charles Albert as successor had not been made willingly, since Charles Albert had shown himself to be inclined to liberalism and friendly to the carbonari.

==Legacy==
The Teatro Carlo Felice in Genoa is named for him. The principal road of the island of Sardinia, the Strada statale 131 Carlo Felice, which connects the towns of Cagliari and Sassari-Porto Torres, constructed in the 19th century, is named for him. At the Cagliari end of that road there is a statue of him, pointing to the city. It is the typical prop for the celebrations of Cagliari Calcio fans, being decked with cloaks and flags in the team&#x27;s colours of red and blue whenever the team is promoted or escapes relegation.
