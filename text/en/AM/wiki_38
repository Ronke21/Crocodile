<text>Physisorption, also called physical adsorption, is a process in which the electronic structure of the atom or molecule is barely upon adsorption.

==Overview==

The fundamental interacting force of physisorption is Van der Waals force. Even though the interaction energy is very weak (~10–100 meV), physisorption plays an important role in nature. For instance, the van der Waals attraction between surfaces and foot-hairs of geckos (see Synthetic setae) provides the remarkable ability to climb up vertical walls. Van der Waals forces originate from the interactions between induced, permanent or transient electric dipoles.

In comparison with chemisorption, in which the electronic structure of bonding atoms or molecules is changed and covalent or ionic bonds form, physisorption does not result in changes to the chemical bonding structure. In practice, the categorisation of a particular adsorption as physisorption or chemisorption depends principally on the binding energy of the adsorbate to the substrate, with physisorption being far weaker on a per-atom basis than any type of connection involving a chemical bond.

==Modeling by image charge==
To give a simple illustration of physisorption, we can first consider an adsorbed hydrogen atom in front of a perfect conductor, as shown in Fig. 1. A nucleus with positive charge is located at R = (0, 0, &quot;Z&quot;), and the position coordinate of its electron, r = (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;) is given with respect to the nucleus. The adsorption process can be viewed as the interaction between this hydrogen atom and its image charges of both the nucleus and electron in the conductor. As a result, the total electrostatic energy is the sum of attraction and repulsion terms:

:formula_1

The first term is the attractive interaction of the nucleus and its image charge, and the second term is due to the interaction of the electron and its image charge. The repulsive interaction is shown in the third and fourth terms arising from the interaction between the nucleus and the image electron, and, the interaction between the electron and the image nucleus, respectively.

By Taylor expansion in powers of |r| / |R|, this interaction energy can be further expressed as:

:formula_2

One can find from the first non-vanishing term that the physisorption potential depends on the distance &quot;Z&quot; between adsorbed atom and surface as &quot;Z&quot;−3, in contrast with the &quot;r&quot;−6 dependence of the molecular van der Waals potential, where &quot;r&quot; is the distance between two dipoles.

==Modeling by quantum-mechanical oscillator==

The van der Waals binding energy can be analyzed by another simple physical picture: modeling the motion of an electron around its nucleus by a three-dimensional simple harmonic oscillator with a potential energy &quot;Va&quot;:

:formula_3

where &quot;me&quot; and &quot;ω&quot; are the mass and vibrational frequency of the electron, respectively.

As this atom approaches the surface of a metal and forms adsorption, this potential energy &quot;Va&quot; will be modified due to the image charges by additional potential terms which are quadratic in the displacements:

:formula_4 (from the Taylor expansion above.)

Assuming

:formula_5

the potential is well approximated as

:formula_6,

where

:formula_7

If one assumes that the electron is in the ground state, then the van der Waals binding energy is essentially the change of the zero-point energy:

:formula_8

This expression also shows the nature of the &quot;Z&quot;−3 dependence of the van der Waals interaction.

Furthermore, by introducing the atomic polarizability,

:formula_9

the van der Waals potential can be further simplified:

:formula_10

where

:formula_11

is the van der Waals constant which is related to the atomic polarizability.

Also, by expressing the fourth-order correction in the Taylor expansion above as (&quot;aCvZ&quot;0) / (Z4), where &quot;a&quot; is some constant, we can define &quot;Z&quot;0 as the position of the &quot;dynamical image plane&quot; and obtain

:formula_12

The origin of &quot;Z&quot;0 comes from the spilling of the electron wavefunction out of the surface. As a result, the position of the image plane representing the reference for the space coordinate is different from the substrate surface itself and modified by &quot;Z&quot;0.

Table 1 shows the jellium model calculation for van der Waals constant &quot;Cv&quot; and dynamical image plane &quot;Z&quot;0 of rare gas atoms on various metal surfaces. The increasing of &quot;Cv&quot; from He to Xe for all metal substrates is caused by the larger atomic polarizability of the heavier rare gas atoms. For the position of the dynamical image plane, it decreases with increasing dielectric function and is typically on the order of 0.2 Å.

==Physisorption potential==
Even though the van der Waals interaction is attractive, as the adsorbed atom moves closer to the surface the wavefunction of electron starts to overlap with that of the surface atoms. Further the energy of the system will increase due to the orthogonality of wavefunctions of the approaching atom and surface atoms.

This Pauli exclusion and repulsion are particularly strong for atoms with closed valence shells that dominate the surface interaction. As a result, the minimum energy of physisorption must be found by the balance between the long-range van der Waals attraction and short-range Pauli repulsion. For instance, by separating the total interaction of physisorption into two contributions—a short-range term depicted by Hartree–Fock theory and a long-range van der Waals attraction—the equilibrium position of physisorption for rare gases adsorbed on jellium substrate can be determined. Fig. 2 shows the physisorption potential energy of He adsorbed on Ag, Cu, and Au substrates which are described by the jellium model with different densities of smear-out background positive charges. It can be found that the weak van der Waals interaction leads to shallow attractive energy wells (&lt;10 meV). One of the experimental methods for exploring physisorption potential energy is the scattering process, for instance, inert gas atoms scattered from metal surfaces. Certain specific features of the interaction potential between scattered atoms and surface can be extracted by analyzing the experimentally determined angular distribution and cross sections of the scattered particles.

== Quantum mechanical – thermodynamic modelling for surface area and porosity ==
Since 1980 two theories were worked on to explain adsorption and obtain equations that work. These two are referred to as the chi hypothesis, the quantum mechanical derivation, and excess surface work, ESW. Both these theories yield the same equation for flat surfaces:

formula_13

Where &quot;U&quot; is the unit step function. The definitions of the other symbols is as follows:

formula_14

where &quot;ads&quot; stands for &quot;adsorbed&quot;, &quot;m&quot; stands for &quot;monolayer equivalence&quot; and &quot;vap&quot; is reference to the vapor pressure (&quot;ads&quot; and &quot;vap&quot; are the latest IUPAC convention but &quot;m&quot; has no IUAPC equivalent notation) of the liquid adsorptive at the same temperature as the solid sample. The unit function creates the definition of the molar energy of adsorption for the first adsorbed molecule by:

formula_15

The plot of formula_16 adsorbed versus formula_17 is referred to as the chi plot. For flat surfaces, the slope of the chi plot yields the surface area. Empirically, this plot was notice as being a very good fit to the isotherm by Polanyi and also by deBoer and Zwikker but not pursued. This was due to criticism in the former case by Einstein and in the latter case by Brunauer. This flat surface equation may be used as a &quot;standard curve&quot; in the normal tradition of comparison curves, with the exception that the porous sample&#x27;s early portion of the plot of formula_16 versus formula_17 acts as a self-standard. Ultramicroporous, microporous and mesoporous conditions may be analyzed using this technique. Typical standard deviations for full isotherm fits including porous samples are typically less than 2%.

A typical fit to good data on a homogeneous non-porous surface is shown in figure 3. The data is by Payne, Sing and Turk and was used to create the formula_20-s standard curve. Unlike the BET, which can only be at best fit over the range of 0.05 to 0.35 of &quot;P&quot;/&quot;P&quot;, the range of the fit is the full isotherm.

==Comparison with chemisorption==

* Physisorption is a general phenomenon and occurs in any solid/fluid or solid/gas system. Chemisorption is characterized by chemical specificity.
* In physisorption, perturbation of the electronic states of adsorbent and adsorbate is minimal. The adsorption forces include London Forces, dipole-dipole attractions, dipole-induced attraction and &quot;hydrogen bonding.&quot; For chemisorption, changes in the electronic states may be detectable by suitable physical means, in other words, chemical bonding.
* Typical binding energy of physisorption is about 10–300 meV and non-localized. Chemisorption usually forms bonding with energy of 1–10 eV and localized.
* The elementary step in physisorption from a gas phase does not involve activation energy. Chemisorption often involves an activation energy.
* For physisorption gas phase molecules, adsorbates, form multilayer adsorption unless physical barriers, such as porosity, interfere. In chemisorption, molecules are adsorbed on the surface by valence bonds and only form monolayer adsorption.
* A direct transition from physisorption to chemisorption has been observed by attaching a CO molecule to the tip of an atomic force microscope and measuring its interaction with a single iron atom. This effect was observed in the late 1960s for benzene from field emission as reported by Condon and ESR measurements as reported by Moyes and Wells.
* Another way of looking at this is that chemisorption alters the topology of the electrons in the adsorbate molecule (by the process of chemical reaction) but physisorption does not.

<text>Aenon (, &quot;Ainṓn&quot;), distinguished as Aenon near Salim, is the site mentioned by the Gospel of John ) as one of the places where John was baptising people, after baptizing Jesus in Bethany-beyond-the-Jordan.

Aenon is the Hellenized form of the term for &#x27;spring&#x27; or &#x27;natural fountain&#x27; in many Semitic languages, including Hebrew &quot;ayn&quot; () and Arabic &quot;ain&quot; or &quot;ein&quot; (). In the water-poor Middle East, places owning a spring tend to be named after that water source, so that toponyms consisting of or containing the construct element are common. The particular site mentioned in the Gospel of John is therefore distinguished as &quot;Aenon near Salim&quot;.

The name Aenon is commonly used amongst Baptist organizations and churches.

==Identification attempts==
===Information from the Gospel===
Neither &quot;Aenon&quot; nor &quot;Salim&quot; is a unique name, and the Gospel text offers only two additional hints about where Aenon might be located: the most direct information is that &quot;there was plenty of water there&quot; (), and the second is that it was west of the River Jordan because at Aenon John&#x27;s disciples talk of the site where John first encountered Jesus as being &quot;on the other side of the Jordan&quot; () which is taken to mean east of the river. We also know from that that first encounter happened at &quot;Bethany-beyond-the-Jordan&quot;, named relative to the entrance of the Hebrews from the desert during the Exodus.

===&#x27;Ainun in Wadi Far″a===
One possible location is near the upper source of the Wadi Far&#x27;a, an open valley extending from Mount Ebal to the Jordan River, which is full of springs. There is a place called &#x27;Ainun four miles north of the springs.

===Eusebius: Saloumias south of Scythopolis===
Another possible location, which is by Eusebius&#x27; description in his &quot;Onomasticon&quot; (written before AD 324), is at &quot;a village in the (Jordan) valley, at the eighth milestone from Scythopolis (Beit She&#x27;an), ... called Salumias.&quot; This view was already supported by the 19th-century Smith&#x27;s Bible Dictionary and the 1915 International Standard Bible Encyclopedia and is still favoured by some.

===Madaba Map: east of the Jordan near Jericho===
In addition to Aenon near Salem, the 6th-century Madaba Map shows a second Aenon right across the Jordan from Bethabara, near Jericho. In the Gospel of John, &quot;Bethany-beyond-the-Jordan&quot; is indicated as the place where Jesus was baptized by John; in some translations of the Bible, the name &quot;Bethany&quot; is instead transcribed as &quot;Bethabara&quot; (). On the Madaba Map, Bethabara is on the right bank of the Jordan, while this Aenon is on the left.

<text>Abarim () is the Hebrew name used in the Bible for a mountain range &quot;across the Jordan&quot;, understood as east of the Jordan Rift Valley, i.e. in Transjordan, to the east and south-east of the Dead Sea, extending from Mount Nebo — its highest point — in the north, perhaps to the Arabian desert in the south. 

==Etymology and description==
According to Cheyne and Black, its Hebrew meaning is &quot;&#x27;Those-on-the-other-side&#x27;—i.e., of the Jordan.&quot; The Vulgate (Deuteronomy 32:49) gives its etymological meaning as &quot;passages&quot;. Its northern part was called Pisgah, and the highest peak of Pisgah was Mount Nebo (Numbers 23:14; 27:12; 21:20; 32:47; Deuteronomy 3:27; 34:1; 32:49).

These mountains are mentioned several times in the Bible:
* Balaam blessed Israel the second time from the top of Mount Pisgah (Numbers 23:14)
* From &quot;the top of Pisgah&quot; i.e. Mount Nebo, an area which belonged to Moab, Moses surveyed the Promised Land (Numbers 27:12 and Deuteronomy 3:27; 32:49), and there he died (34:1,5)
* The Israelites had one of their encampments in the mountains of Abarim (Numbers 33:47,48) after crossing the Arnon
* The prophet Jeremiah linked it with Bashan and Lebanon as locations from which the people cried in vain to God for rescue (Jeremiah 22:20)
* Jeremiah hid the Ark of the Covenant there (II Maccabees 2:4-5). (The book of 2 Maccabees is included in Bibles used by Roman Catholics, but generally not in Protestant or Jewish Bibles.)

<doc id="68529" wikidata="Q2911724" url="?curid=68529" title="Abel-beth-maachah">
<text>Tel Abel Beth Maacah (; ) is a large archaeological tell with a small upper northern section and a large lower southern one, connected by a saddle. It is located on the northern border of present-day Israel, about 2 km south of the town of Metula and about 6.5 km west of Tel Dan.

The survey and excavations conducted in recent years have shown that the site had been inhabited during the Bronze and Iron Ages, as well as the Persian, Hellenistic, Byzantine, Early Islamic, Crusader, Mamluk and Ottoman periods. Since at least the early 13th century CE the mound was the location of the Arab village of Abil al-Qamh, depopulated in 1948. However, the lower mound was not occupied after the Iron Age I (late 11th/early 10th centuries BCE), when occupation seems to have concentrated on the upper mound.

The site was fortified by walls and a rampart in the Middle Bronze Age II. These fortifications were reused in the Late Bronze Age in the south of the mound, but went out of commission in the Iron Age I. A silver hoard in a jug, dating to the end of the Late Bronze Age, is one of the earliest such hoards found in the country. The Iron Age I sequence is one of the densest in this region and includes strata of cultic, domestic and public nature. Traces of metal-working were found in the latter. The Iron Age II is represented by a very large stone wall in the upper mound that might be part of a citadel. A well-built structure dating to the Persian-early Hellenistic period was built above this wall and other Iron Age remains.

In the later periods, the Palestinian village of Abil al-Qamh was located here until it became depopulated during the Nakba in 1948.

==The site==
The site is approximately 100 dunams (10 hectares) in size and sits astride the narrow defile of Nahal Ayun, one of the four headwaters of the Jordan River. The Tanur Waterfall, fed by the Iyyon, is located just north of the site. From its strategic vantage point overlooking the narrow northern end of the fertile Hula Valley, the site commands roads leading north to the Lebanese Beqaa Valley, northeast to inland Syria (Damascus) and Mesopotamia, and west to the Lebanese/Phoenician coast.

The tell is identified with Abel Beth-Maacah mentioned in the Hebrew Bible and consists of an upper mound in the north and a larger lower mound in the south, with a moderately high saddle between them.
The location of the town in such a strategic spot points to it having played a major role in the interaction between the various national groups and political powers in the Bronze Age (Canaanites, Hurrians/Mitannians, Egyptians, and Hittites) and the Iron Age (Israelites, Arameans and Phoenicians). Abel Beth Maacah was a border town, and as such, was exposed to these influences at the same time that it fulfilled the role of buffering, or bearing the brunt of, foreign invasions. Its proximity to numerous water sources and a rich agricultural hinterland was yet another factor in making Abel Beth Maacah a large and prominent site in antiquity.

==Etymology==
Abel Beth Maacah means &quot;the meadow of the house of Maacah&quot;.
The biblical name is spelled variously as Abel-beth-maacah, Abel Beth Maacah, Abel Beth-Maacah, Avel Bet Ma&#x27;akha etc. The city is also called Abel Maim (&quot;meadow of water&quot;) in 2 Chronicles 16:4.

==Identification==
The tell was described by a number of prominent 19th-century and early 20th-century explorers, including Victor Guérin, Félix-Marie Abel and Edward Robinson, who was the first to identify the mound with biblical Abel Beth Maacah (Avel Bet Macakha). The proposal has won scholarly acceptance, based largely on historical-geographical considerations.

The identification is based mainly on the appearance of the town in two geographic lists in the Bible. In 1 Kings 15:20, the Aramean king Ben-Hadad I was solicited in the 9th century BCE by King Asa of Judah to attack the northern kingdom. He did successfully, although apparently soon after this, control over this region returned to Israelite hands during the reign of Ahab. &quot;Ben-hadad listened to King Asa, and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel. He conquered Ijon, Tel Dan, Abel-beth-maacah, and all Chinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali&quot;. A similar geographic list is noted in the story of the Assyrian conquest of the region in the late 8th century BCE in 2 Kings 15:29: &quot;In the days of King Pekah of Israel, King Tiglath-pileser of Assyria came and captured Ijon, Abel-beth-maacah, Janoah, Kedesh, Hazor, Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali; and carried the people captive to Assyria&quot;.

==Second millennium BCE and biblical references==
A Hebrew inscription on the lid of a wine storage jar uncovered in the summer of 2019 reads “leBenayau,” meaning that the storage jar and its contents “belong to Benayau” is dated to the 10th-9th century BCE. It was found together with other jars in what appears to have been the wine cellar of a man named Benayau. It is the first inscription found at the dig, and the lettering dates it to earlier than 2,900 years ago. The inscription is one of several artifacts that appear to support the idea first proposed by Avraham Biran that Abel-beth-maachah was an Israelite town during the reigns of David and Solomon.

Bronze Age references to the site include the early group of the Execration Texts (Middle Bronze IIA) and possibly Thutmose III&#x27;s list of destroyed towns (Late Bronze I), as well as the Amarna letters (Late Bronze IIA; Dever 1984: 211–213). After the Assyrian conquest, the site is not mentioned in any later sources.

Aside from the two geographic lists quoted above in relation to the conquest of the town by the Arameans and the Assyrians, the site is mentioned one other time in the Bible: 2 Samuel 20:14–22, which relates a call for revolt against David by a Benjaminite named Sheba ben Bichri. Sheba fled to Abel Beth Maacah, pursued by Joab and his army. Setting up a siege at the town, Joab threatened to destroy it, when the local &quot;wise woman&quot; (possibly an oracle) informed him that the city was loyal to David, calling it &quot;a city and a mother in Israel&quot; (2 Samuel 20:19) and arranged to have the rebel who took refuge there beheaded, and thus saving her town. This is the only time the phrase &quot;a city and a mother in Israel&quot; is mentioned in the Bible and might allude to its particular political and/or religious status. This narrative also emphasizes the town as the northernmost point of the Israelite state entity, although it is not clear to which time period this relates, since this narrative most likely reflects a time later in Iron Age II than the reign of David.

Though speculative, some scholars have suggested that the conquest of Abel Beth Maacah by Ben-hadad I may be alluded to in the second line of the &#x27;House of David&#x27; inscription found at nearby Tel Dan, where the letters aleph and bet have survived and might be the beginning of the name of the town &quot;Abel&quot; (Schneidewind 1996:77; Naaman 2012:95, note 10).

==Exploration history==
=== Past explorations ===
Despite its obvious historical importance and geographic prominence, Abel Beth Maacah was not excavated before 2012. Previous study of the site involved periodic visits by representatives of the British Mandatory Department of Antiquities and limited surveys carried out by the Israel Department of Antiquities in the 1950s, by Yehudah Dayan in the 1960s, and by Prof. William G. Dever of the University of Arizona in 1972, who summarily published the results, along with a detailed historical-geographical analysis (Dever 1986). Subsequently, a small salvage excavation conducted by the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) at the base of the southeastern slope revealed several Byzantine tombs, as well as a group of Middle Bronze IIB vessels that seemed typical of a tomb assemblage, although no tomb from this period was found (Stepansky 2005).

===Current project===
The excavation of Tel Abel Beth Maacah has been initiated and funded by Azusa Pacific University of Los Angeles, and is conducted as a joint project with the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, co-directed by Dr. Robert Mullins of the former institution and Dr. Naama Yahalom-Mack and Dr. Nava Panitz-Cohen of the latter. The surveyor and stratigraphic advisor is Ruhama Bonfil of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

The project began in 2012 with a survey followed by four excavation seasons to date (2013–2016).

====2012 survey; habitation periods====

In May 2012, a four-day survey was conducted, combining an extensive walking survey with limited shallow (up to 10 cm) excavation in six areas spread around the site. 
The survey showed that there was occupation in the Early Bronze [EB] II-III, Middle Bronze [MB] II, Late Bronze [LB]I-II, Iron Age I-II, Persian, Hellenistic, Byzantine, Early Islamic, Crusader, Mamluk and Ottoman periods. The survey also revealed that the lower part of the tell in the south has an outcropping of bedrock running through much of its center, indicating that the ancient remains in this part of the site should be sought around its perimeter.

An intact ring flask, apparently of Late Bronze Age date, was found in the survey in the vicinity of Area A.

==Excavation and findings==
===Excavation areas===
Five areas had been excavated as of Winter 2021. Area A on the eastern slope of the middle saddle (remains of Middle Bronze IIB, Late Bronze IIB, Iron Age I, Iron Age II and Early Islamic), Area B on the eastern slope of the upper mound (remains of Middle Bronze IIB, Iron Age I, Iron Age II, Persian-early Hellenistic, Roman-Byzantine, Mamluk), Area F on the southern end of the lower mound (remains of MBIIB, LB I-II, Iron I), Area O on the western edge of the lower mound (remains of MBIIB, Iron I-II), and Area K on the eastern slope of a topographical depression between the lower and upper mounds (remains of Iron I-II). In wake of the survey and excavations to date, it was found that the lower mound was probably not occupied after the Iron Age I (late 11th/early 10th century BCE) and occupation was limited to the upper mound and the interim saddle.

Excavation areas are marked on this 1945 aerial photo of the tell (Aerial Photographic Archive, Geography Department, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, taken by the Royal Air Force, Section 23, 1945); the houses visible on the photo belong to the Arab village of Abil al-Qamh.

===Middle Bronze II===
Remains of the Middle Bronze II have been revealed to date in three areas: F, O and B.

====Area F====
A large structure was revealed just under topsoil. Its southern end continues down the slope and its western end was cut by later activity. This feature is composed of an outer &#x27;lining&#x27; of very large, roughly worked stones in its northeastern corner and northern wall, which enclosed layers of small-medium roughly rounded stones.

Adjoining the eastern face of the stones is a rampart, partly capped by stones and composed of layers of chalky white material and dark brown soil, of which only the top has so far been excavated. The stone structure and rampart are part of a fortification placed on the southern end of the site, overlooking the Huleh Valley and the main north–south road that passed alongside it on the west.

The exact date of the tower and rampart cannot yet be determined, as no floors associated with them have been revealed to date. Against the northern face of the fortification are elements dating to the Late Bronze Age I-II, so that it the fortification should most likely be dated to the Middle Bronze II, though a more precise chronology cannot be fixed yet.

====Area O====
One, and possibly two strata, dated to the Middle Bronze IIB, were exposed underneath an eroded Late Bronze Age phase below topsoil.

The Middle Bronze Age remains consist a building with four consecutive rooms revealed to date, with entrances in two of them, showing that the rooms were part of one building that continues to the north. Traces of a violent end to this occupation were identified. The pottery can be dated to Middle Bronze IIB and included storage jars (some with baby burials) and pithoi. In the northeastern corner of the area, the skeleton of a large male was found lying on its stomach and partly covered by a pithos.

The lowest phase exposed consists of the top of a layer of stones on the western edge of the mound that might be part of an Early Bronze wall, judging by the pottery collected nearby.

====Area B====
Underneath remains dating to Iron Age I and IIA, a large rampart composed mainly of diagonal gravelly layers was revealed. An MBIIC grave that contained a Hyksos scarab was cut into this rampart and thus, it is tentatively dated to MBIIB. This rampart shows that the upper mound in the north was occupied and fortified during the Middle Bronze Age IIB, although the nature and direction of the rampart here is different from that found in the lower mound in the south (Areas F and possibly, K).

===Late Bronze Age===
Remains of the Late Bronze Age were revealed in Areas F, O and A.

====Area F====
Three architectural strata, debris layers, and floors from the Late Bronze Age were revealed, abutting the northern face of the MBII fortification. The incorporation of the fortification as part of the LB buildings indicates that it was still in use during this period. The earliest LB stratum, built on top of what seems to be the foundation of the tower, includes two nicely built north–south walls; an earthen layer (floor?) with a well-built oven was found to the west of these walls; the pottery points to an LB I date. The third and latest LB stratum contained several walls (cut by Iron Age I silos and pits). On its earthen floor was a concentration of pottery and a small jug (a local imitation of a Cypriot bilbil) that contained a silver hoard. The 12 pieces found inside included earrings, an ingot, and hacksilver.

The latest LB layer in Area F can be dated to LBIIB (13th century BCE) and the remains exposed so far indicate that it did not end in a destruction, but was peacefully abandoned. These remains were later built over by an Iron I building and cut by Iron I silos and pits. 
====Area O====
Remains uncovered just below topsoil in Area O are attributed to the Late Bronze Age, since they rested on top of a building attributed to MBIIB and on the basis of the small amount of pottery found associated with them.

====Area A====
The lowest level reached in Area A included several large walls, built of stone and brick, with associated Late Bronze pottery. The Iron I walls were built directly over them, with no trace of destruction of the LB elements.

===Iron Age I===
Remains of Iron Age I have been revealed mainly in Area A on the eastern edge of the saddle between the lower and upper mounds, where five strata belonging to this period have been excavated, as well as in Area F. In both areas, the pottery included many collared-rim jars, wavy band pithoi, small hemispherical bowls, a variety of vertical cooking pot rims, pyxides, painted carinated kraters, and pear-shaped jugs.
====Area F====
Remains of the Iron Age I were found just above the latest Late Bronze Age layer (dated to the 13th century BCE, LBIIB). These remains included a building with several rooms, as well numerous pits and silos. Some of these were cut into the LB walls, as well as into the top of the MBII fortification, indicating that the latter went out of use in this period. The pits contained pottery, a spindle whorl and an iron blade. One of these pits, cut deep against the wall of the MBII tower, contained a concentration of discarded cultic vessels. These remains were exposed just below topsoil. Aside from a large pit dug in the Persian period here, no later occupation was identified following the Iron Age I here. 
====Area A====
Four strata are attributed to Iron Age I in Area A. This is one of the densest stratigraphic sequences attributed to this period in this region. Above the uppermost Iron I stratum were several flimsy modern agricultural terrace walls, but no ancient remains later than the end of Iron I (late 11th/early 10th centuries BCE).

The earliest stratum revealed to date appears in a few probes and contains several well-built stone walls and related debris layers with stone collapse and much pottery. The stratum above this has a structure apparently of a cultic nature, with various installations, such as a pit with animal bones, massebot (standing stones), a small bamah (altar). This occupation was violently destroyed, leaving large amounts of pottery, including collar-rim jars, pyxides, carinated jugs and kraters. On the floor of one of the rooms were several jewelry items, including an amethyst scarab set in a gold ring that belongs to the time of the Egyptian Middle Kingdom. Replacing the destroyed cultic(?) area was a layer of domestic nature, with many ovens and earthen floors. Directly above this, a very finely constructed complex was built, comprising a courtyard-like building on the east, a building complex on the west with a large open space on the south and room(s) on the north. A wide passageway runs between them. The external walls of the buildings facing the passageway are lined with stone buttresses.

In the western hall/courtyard, a complete pot bellows was revealed in secondary use, with traces of bronze and iron working inside; an almost complete tuyere was found nearby. It seems that there was some metallurgical activity in this area, similar to that at nearby Tel Dan in Strata VI and V (and possibly IV).
====Iron Age I, II and Persian–Early Hellenistic period in Area B====
A large well-built stone building with three phases and dating to the Persian-early Hellenistic period was exposed in Area B. Below this building are architectural remains and numerous pits attributed to Iron Age I, including a floor with vessels and traces of destruction. Cutting this activity is a massive east–west stone wall that was partly covered by the Persian-early Hellenistic building and thus, it is presently attributed to Iron Age IIB. No floors associated with it have yet been excavated and it seems that it might be part of a citadel at this high point of the mound. Two large stone-lined silos were also attributed to Iron IIB; they contained much Iron II pottery, including red-slipped and hand burnished sherds, as well as the head of a Phoenician-style figurine.

The Iron I and II architecture and pits cut into and are built on the sloping layers of the Middle Bronze II rampart described above.

====Area K fortifications====
Located on the eastern slope of the northern end of the lower mound, in a spot whose moderate topography suggests the possibility of a gate here, a north–south stone wall was revealed, ca. 4 m wide and abutted partially on its south side by a white chalky layer. This might represent a fortification system, although no date is possible at this point.

===Significant discoveries===
In 2018, archaeologists led by Robert Mullins from the Azusa Pacific University announced the discovery of a 2,800-year-old carved head sculpture of a man. The well-crafted figurine was described with long, black hair, a beard and a painted headband. He also had almond-shaped eyes and a serious expression on his face. According to archeologists, the measurements of carved in a glazed ceramic called faience were approximately 2.2 × 2 inches, and the head was once part of a small figurine, now lost that was 8 to 10 inches. The sculpture is on display at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.

<text>Abel-meholah (, &quot;Avel Mehola&quot;) was an ancient city frequently mentioned in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament of Christianity). It is best known for being the birthplace and residence of the prophet Elisha. It is traditionally located near the Jordan River, south of Beit-She&#x27;an.

==Mentions in the Bible==
When Gideon defeated the Midianites, some of them fled &quot;as far as the border of Abel-meholah&quot; (). The text indicates that Abel-meholah was seen as a region with a defined border, west of the Jordan River and south of Beit-She&#x27;an.

Abel-meholah is mentioned the Book of Kings under the description of King Solomon&#x27;s administration. Among Solomon&#x27;s twelve governors, there is one Baana who is put in charge of several districts including the area &quot;from Beth-She&#x27;an to Abel-meholah&quot; ().

Later in the Book of Kings, Elijah, who had fled fearing Queen Jezebel&#x27;s wrath, is ordered by God at Mount Horeb to go back along the Jordan valley and &quot;anoint Elisha son of Shaphat from Abel-meholah&quot; to succeed him as prophet ().

Adriel the Meholathite, the son-in-law of King Saul, was probably named after Abel-meholah (, ).

==Location==
The site of Abel-meholah has not yet been identified with certainty. Jerome and Eusebius refer to it as both a town and an area in the Jordan Valley, about ten Roman miles south of Bethshean. Epiphanius of Salamis, mentioning the village, writes that in his day it was called Beth-meholah.

In the late 19th century, explorers were trying to identify the exact mound. Conder stated with some confidence that the site &quot;is now called &#x27;Ain Helweh&quot;. Noth and Ottosson identified Abel-meholah with Tell Abu el-Kharaz, east of the Jordan River.

Modern scholars generally agree that it has to be found in that area and west of the Jordan River, probably at the spot where Wadi al-Malih, a stream which might preserve the ancient name Meholah, merges into the Jordan. Two tells in that general area, Tell Abu Sifri and Tell Abu Sus, are suitable candidates with the latter being more likely. Tell Abu Sifri is situated at the confluence of Wadi al-Helweh and Wadi al-Malih, while Tell Abu Sus is closer to the Jordan. Neither of the two have yet been excavated.

Two Israeli settlements in the area, Mehola and nearby Shadmot Mehola, are named after the biblical city.

<text>Ebez ( meaning &quot;tin&quot;, or &quot;white&quot;) also rendered Abez, was a town in the allotment of the tribe of Issachar, at the north of the Jezreel Valley, or plain of Esdraelon. F. R. and C. R. Conder (1879), believed that it was probably the ruins of el-Beida, but William Robertson Smith (1899) expressed doubt about this identification. According to the 1915 &quot;International Standard Bible Encyclopedia&quot; (1915), the location is not known. It is mentioned only in , where various manuscripts of the Septuagint render it as &quot;Rebes&quot; (), &quot;Aeme&quot;, or &quot;Aemis&quot;. It is mentioned on the façade of the Mortuary Temple of Ramesses III at Medinet Habu as Apijaa.

<text>Aviv () means &quot;spring (season)&quot; in Hebrew. Aviv is the first month of the year in the Pentateuch, and is later called Nisan in the book of Esther and in subsequent post-exilic history up to the present day. These names are sometimes used interchangeably, although Aviv refers to the three-month season, and Nisan is called the &quot;first month of Aviv.&quot; Aviv is also used as a given name, surname, and place name, as in Tel Aviv. 

==Meanings==
* The basic meaning of the word &quot;aviv&quot; is the stage in the growth of grain when the seeds have reached full size and are filled with starch, but have not dried yet. During the plague of hail (Exodus ), the barley was said to be [in the] &quot;aviv&quot; [stage] and the flax [in the] &quot;giv`ol&quot;. This resulted in their destruction.
* The month in the Hebrew calendar when the barley has reached or passed this stage is called &quot;Aviv&quot;, or the &quot;month of the &quot;aviv&quot;&quot;. This month is considered the first month of the ecclesiastical civil year (see Hebrew calendar#Months). It begins about the time of the March equinox (March 21). Since the Babylonian captivity, this month has mainly been called Nisan. On the “day after the Shabbat” (the 16th of the month of Nissan according to the rabbis, and the first Sunday of Passover according to the Karaites), the harvest was begun by gathering a sheaf of barley for the Omer offering,

* Abib or Aviv may also be the same star as Spica, the ear of grain in the constellation Virgo/Virgin/Woman.
* &quot;Aviv&quot; in modern Hebrew accordingly also means spring, one of the four seasons. Thus the major modern Israeli city of Tel Aviv means &quot;Spring Hill&quot;.
* Since Passover is always celebrated on 15–21 (or 22 outside Israel) Nisan, near the beginning of spring, &quot;Holiday of &quot;Aviv&quot;&quot;. Pesach or Passover is always on the 14th of Nisan. The first day of Chag ha Matzot or the Feast of Unleavened Bread is always the day after that, the 15th of Nisan. is an additional name for Passover.

==As a name==
Aviv is a Hebrew male and female name. The feminine version of the name is Aviva. Aviv is also an old and uncommon Russian Christian male given name &quot;&quot; (&quot;Aviv&quot;), that possibly borrowed from Biblical Hebrew, where it derived from the word &quot;abīb&quot;, meaning &quot;an ear&quot; or &quot;a time of year where grains come into ear&quot;, also known as &quot;Aviv&quot; (or Nisan—the first month of the Hebrew calendar). The diminutives of &quot;Aviv&quot; in Russian are Aviva () and Viva (). The patronymics derived from &quot;Aviv&quot; are &quot;&quot; (&quot;Avivovich&quot;; masculine) and &quot;&quot; (&quot;Avivovna&quot;; feminine).

<doc id="68543" wikidata="Q3869818" url="?curid=68543" title="Nadab and Abihu">
<text>In the biblical books Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers, Nadab () and Abihu () were the two oldest sons of Aaron. According to Leviticus 10, they offered a sacrifice with &quot;foreign fire&quot; before the , disobeying his instructions, and were immediately consumed by God&#x27;s fire.

Moses instructed Aaron and his family not to mourn, although the people at large were permitted.

==Background==
Nadab and Abihu were the first two sons of Aaron the Levite by his marriage to Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab from the tribe of Judah. They had four sons in total, the younger two sons being named Eleazar and Ithamar. During the Exodus journey, after the Israelites&#x27; affirmation of their covenant with God, Abihu and Nadab accompanied Moses, Aaron, and 70 elders up Mount Sinai. There they saw God with great clarity, walking on a pavement of sapphire stone, and shared a meal in God&#x27;s presence, without being harmed as a result.

Aaron and his four sons were the first priests appointed as the priestly system was established by God. The Levites as a tribe were later ordained for the priestly service after answering a call to take the &#x27;s side after the idolatry centered on the golden calf. After the death of Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar took their places as priests, because neither Nadab nor Abihu had any sons.

==Violation of God&#x27;s law and punishment==
In Exodus 30 and Leviticus, God outlines a proper sacrifice to him. Aaron, the chief priest, was to present all offerings representing himself and the people. God would send his own fire to consume the sacrifice as a sign of his presence.

When the fire from the Lord came and consumed the sacrifice, it was perceived as a token of God’s glory and favor. And this sacred fire, which the Lord Himself had kindled was to be used to burn the incense. But Nadab and Abihu, when they took their censers to burn fragrant incense, they used a different fire, a strange fire, not the fire which the Lord kindled and commanded to be used for this purpose. This was a sin and for this sin a fire came from heaven and devoured them in front of the congregation.

When Nadab and Abihu lit the offering in the censers themselves, their fire was profane and thus God was not in it. They prepared an incense offering upon kindling of their own and not of the holy incense from the sacred bronze altar. This was seen as foreign or unholy fire ( &quot;’êš zārāh&quot;). Aaron’s sons spurned the command to wait for holy fire and offered incense with profane fire. Anyone who altered the sacrificial system assumed a prerogative belonging to God alone.

==Burial and mourning==

===Burial===
After the death of Nadab and Abihu, Moses dictated what was to be done with their bodies. He told Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel, Aaron&#x27;s, his own and their sister Miriam&#x27;s uncle, to carry the bodies away from the sanctuary to a place outside of the camp. He specified for Mishael and Elzaphan to be careful to only touch Nadab and Abihu&#x27;s tunics, and not their bodies. The first concerns in burial were to prevent what is holy from being defiled and the service of God from being disrupted. The corpses had to be removed immediately, because to allow the uncleanliness of the bodies to remain in the sanctuary could invoke God&#x27;s wrath again. The bodies were lifted up &quot;by their tunics&quot; to avoid direct physical contact. This did not prevent the carriers from becoming ritually unclean, but lessened the time and procedures needed to restore them to ritual purity.

===Mourning===
Aaron and the other surviving priests were commanded not to mourn, participate in mourning rituals, or have contact with the dead. This was applicable not only in this case; but it was modified in an ongoing command. While priests could mourn, they could not have contact with the dead—even a dead spouse, parent or child—and they could not participate in public mourning rituals. As the representatives of the people, priests were to avoid anything that might disqualify them for God&#x27;s service. They were to remain ready and able to act in God&#x27;s service whenever the community needed them.

The command not to mourn also applied because the crime of Nadab and Abihu was so provoking to God and fully merited the punishment which God had inflicted. To mourn in this case could be seen by the people as accusing God of undue severity. Both the people and the priests needed to show submission to a righteous judgement. If the anointed priests were to sin in this manner, the blame would fall not only upon them but also upon the people. In addition, all Jews are prohibited from mourning on the Sabbath and during festivals of the Lord. These are days for celebration, no sorrow is permitted to impinge upon the joy of the days.

However, the people in the community as a whole were allowed to mourn and display grief. The death of Nadab and Abihu was tragic yet deserved, and the people were to first recognize that it was deserved and then mourn their death.

==In Judaism==
The sin of Nadab and Abihu was a serious violation of the duties reserved for their father, the high priest. However, their offense was not limited to just overstepping boundaries; it involved multiple transgressions. First, without authorization, they took it upon themselves to perform the incense service, the most sacred and important priestly responsibilities. Second, they collaborated in a task that only the high priest was allowed to carry out. Lastly, they assumed the responsibility of lighting the fire offering themselves. In doing so, they &quot;offered foreign fire before the Lord,&quot; demonstrating a presumptuous and unauthorized intrusion into a sacred role not rightfully theirs. In these actions, they showed carelessness, irreverence, and a want of faith—especially grievous for those in the priestly service. A precedent of such evil tendency was dangerous, and it was imperatively necessary for the priests and the sacred items that God should give a punishment.

==In Christianity==
===Roman Catholicism===
Whether Nadab and Abihu neglected to follow God&#x27;s outlined sacrificial system out of presumptuousness, or out of thoughtlessness and inattention, their fault was severely punished so that all might learn to comply exactly with God&#x27;s commands, and not try to change them or explain them away. The mixing of falsehood with the word of God was a serious sin. Those in power, like priests, should be especially careful in their behavior, because they are examples to those they serve.

===Reformation and Post-Reformation views===
Nadab and Abihu were in a great position to become honorable and respected priests. If Nadab and Abihu&#x27;s deed had been done through ignorance, they would have been told to bring a sin-offering. But instead they did it presumptuously (deliberately and arrogantly), and in contempt of God&#x27;s majesty and justice. They were therefore cut off, for the wages of sin is death. The sin and punishment of these priests showed the imperfection of that priesthood from the very beginning, and that it could not shelter any from the fire of God&#x27;s wrath.

===Seventh-day Adventists views===
Nadab and Abihu were not trained in their formative years, to develop habits of self-control as well as respect and obedience to authority. They saw their father, Aaron, yielding to the pressure of the multitudes and making for them a golden calf against the will of the Lord. This is a call to parents, especially Godly parents to set a good example of strict and exemplary obedience to God’s laws.

Nadab and Abihu are also believed to have been intoxicated at the time of their sin. Therefore, their minds were not as clear as they should have been in preparation to the service of the Lord. This is the reason that following their transgression, the Lord instructed Aaron and his remaining children to never drink wine or strong drink. The same obligation rests upon God’s children today, to ensure that they avoid anything that may alter their state of mind and diminish their service to the Lord.

<text>There are two biblical characters named Abihud.
* One of the sons of Bela, the son of Benjamin; called also Ahihud (1 Chronicles 8:3,7).
* A son or grandson of Zerubbabel, and member of the Davidic line. Abihud was the father of Eliakim (Matthew 1:13, &quot;Abiud&quot;), and possibly the same as Obadiah (1 Chronicles 3:21).

The name may also occasionally be romanized as Abioud (Greek) or &#x27;Abiyhuwd (Hebrew).

==Meaning==
The name &quot;Abihud&quot; means &quot;the (divine) father is glory&quot;, according to Cheyne and Black (1899). The name &quot;Ehud&quot; is probably a shorter form of &quot;Abihud.&quot;

==Descendants==
In the genealogy of Jesus, Abihud&#x27;s male-line descendants are depicted:
*Generation 1: Eliakim
*Generation 2: Azor
*Generation 3: Zadok
*Generation 4: Achim
*Generation 5: Eliud
*Generation 6: Eleazar
*Generation 7: Matthan
*Generation 8: Jacob
*Generation 9: Joseph

<text>Abijam (; ; ) was, according to the Hebrew Bible, the fourth king of the House of David and the second of the Kingdom of Judah. He was the son of Rehoboam and the grandson of Solomon. The Books of Chronicles refer to him as Abijah.

==In the Talmud==
===Family===
Abijam is reported in the books of Kings and Chronicles as being the son of Maacah or Micaiah and father of King Asa of Judah. Some scholars believe the biblical accounts of Abijam&#x27;s family to be contradictory; however, a study of Hebrew linguistics may remove any seeming contradictions. One of the alleged contradictions is that Maacah is sometimes described as the daughter of Absalom, and elsewhere the daughter of Uriel. Absalom is described as only having one daughter, Tamar. Apologists have countered by arguing that in Hebrew, &quot;daughter&quot; and &quot;granddaughter&quot; are the same word. Similarly, Maacah is initially described as Abijah&#x27;s mother, but subsequently described as the mother of his son Asa. Apologists argue similarly for the ambiguity of the term &quot;mother&quot;. Abijah married fourteen wives, and had 22 sons and 16 daughters. No attempted harmonization has found acceptance with scholars.

===Reign===
Following the death of Rehoboam, his son Abijah succeeded the throne as King of Judah. He began his three-year reign (2 Chr. 12:16; 13:1, 2) with a strenuous but unsuccessful effort to bring back the ten tribes of the northern Kingdom of Israel to their allegiance, a path which in his father had chosen not to follow.

Following Abijah&#x27;s ascension to the throne in the 18th year of King Jeroboam I of Israel, he marched north to win Israel back to the Davidic kingdom. Jeroboam surrounded Abijah&#x27;s army, engaging in the Battle of Mount Zemaraim. Abijah rallied his troops there and went on to capture the Israelite cities of Jeshanah, Ephron (now Taybeh, Ramallah), and Bethel.

==Commentaries==
Non-conformist minister Alexander Maclaren considers Abijah &quot;a wiser and better man than his father&quot;.

According to the Deuteronomist, &quot;Yet, for the sake of David, YHWH his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem, by raising up his descendant after him and by preserving Jerusalem.&quot; (1 Kings 15:4). The wording in the Septuagint is &quot;the Lord gave him a remnant&quot;. Thus the unconditional covenant blessing of God guaranteed his promise to King David to stabilize the kingdom despite its ruler. The Chronicler also emphasizes YHWH&#x27;s promise as seen by Abijah&#x27;s success against every effort by Jeroboam to defeat him according to 2 Chronicles 13:18 

God had given the Kingdom to David and his descendants according to 1 Chronicles 17:14 by a covenant of salt, meaning &quot;of permanence&quot; (cf. Leviticus 2:13).

==Rabbinic literature==
Although Abijah took up God&#x27;s cause against Jeroboam, the idolatrous king of Israel, he was not permitted to enjoy the fruits of his victory over the latter for any considerable time, dying as he did shortly after his campaign (Josephus, &quot;Ant.&quot; viii. 11, § 3). The rabbis recount many transgressions committed by Abijah against his fellow men, drawing God&#x27;s vengeance upon him more speedily than upon Jeroboam&#x27;s idolatries. It is stated that he mutilated the corpses of Jeroboam&#x27;s soldiers and would not permit them to be interred until they had arrived at a state of putrefaction. Nor did Abijah show himself zealous in God&#x27;s cause, for when, by the conquest of Bethel (II Chron. xiii. 19), the golden calves came into his possession, he did not destroy them as the law (Deut. vii. 25) enjoined. The rabbis also point out that it was improper for Abijah to accuse the whole of Israel of idolatry and to proclaim the appointment of Jeroboam as king to have been the work of &quot;vain men, the children of Belial&quot; (II Chron. xiii. 7) since it was the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite who prophesied that Jeroboam would be king (I Kings, xi. 37). For these reasons Abijah&#x27;s reign was a short one.

== Chronological discrepancies==
According to , Abijah became king of Judah in the 18th year of the reign of Jeroboam, and reigned for three years.

William F. Albright has dated his reign to 915–913 BCE.

E. R. Thiele offers the dates 914/913 – 911/910 BCE. As explained in the Rehoboam article, Thiele&#x27;s chronology for the first kings of Judah contained an internal inconsistency which later scholars corrected by dating these kings one year earlier, so that Abijah&#x27;s dates are taken as 915/914 to 912/911 BCE in the present article.

<text>Abilene () or simply Abila () was a plain, a district in Coele-Syria, of which the chief town was Abila Lysaniou (Ἄβιλα Λυσανίου). The limits of this region are nowhere exactly defined, but it seems to have included the eastern slopes of the Anti-Lebanon range, and to have extended south and southeast of Damascus as far as the borders of Galilaea, Batanaea, and Trachonitis. According to Flavius Josephus, Abilene was a separate Iturean kingdom until 37 AD.

==History==
Abilene, when first mentioned in history, was governed by a certain Ptolemaeus, son of Mennaeus, who was succeeded, about 40 BC, by a son named Lysanias. Lysanias was put to death in 33 BC, at the instigation of Cleopatra, and the principality passed, by a sort of purchase apparently, into the hands of one Zenodorus, from whom it was transferred (31 BC) to Herod the Great. At the death of the latter (4 BC) one portion of it was annexed to the tetrarchy of his son Philip, and the remainder bestowed upon that Lysanias who is named by Luke (Luke 3).

Immediately after the death of Tiberius (37 AD), Caligula made over to Herod Agrippa, at that time a prisoner in Rome, the tetrarchy of Philip and the tetrarchy of Lysanias, while Claudius, upon his accession (41), not only confirmed the liberality of his predecessor towards Herod Agrippa, but added all that portion of Judaea and Samaria which had belonged to the kingdom of his grandfather Herod the Great, together (says Josephus) with Abila, which had appertained to Lysanias, and the adjoining region of Libanus. Lastly, in 53, Claudius granted to Herod Agrippa II the tetrarchy of Philip with Batanaea and Trachonitis and Abila (Joseph. &quot;Ant.&quot; xiv. 4. § 4, 7. § 4, xviii. 7. § 10, xix. 5. § 1, xx. 6. § 1, &quot;B. J.&quot; i. 13. § 1, xx. 4.)

Josephus, at first sight, seems to contradict himself, in so far that in one passage (&quot;Ant.&quot; xviii. 7. § 10) he represents Caligula as bestowing upon Herod Agrippa the tetrarchy of Lysanias, while in another (&quot;Ant.&quot; xix. 5. § 1) he states that Abila Lysaniou was added by Claudius to the former dominions of Agrippa, but, in reality, these expressions must be explained as referring to the division of Abilene which took place on the death of Herod the Great. Abila is mentioned among the places captured by Placidus, one of Vespasian&#x27;s generals, in 69 or 70 (Joseph. &quot;B. J.&quot; iv. 7. § 5), and from that time forward, it was permanently annexed to the province of Syria.

==Biblical reference==
In chapter 3 of the Gospel of Luke, the timeframe when John the Baptist began to preach his baptism of repentance in the wilderness is indicated by noting which rulers were ruling in certain areas:
:1 Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Cæsar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judæa, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituræa and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene,
:2 Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.

<text>Abiram, also spelled Abiron ( &quot;my father is exalted&quot;), is the name of two people in the Old Testament.
* One was a member of the Tribe of Reuben, the son of Eliab, who, along with his brother Dathan, joined Korah in the conspiracy against Moses and Aaron. He and all the conspirators, with their families and possessions, were swallowed up by the ground.
* The second was the eldest son of Hiel (also spelled Chiel) the Bethelite, who perished prematurely in consequence of his father&#x27;s undertaking to rebuild Jericho.

The name &quot;Abram&quot; is thought to be the same name, etymologically; the name is attested in a 24th-century Babylonian form.

<text>In the Hebrew Bible, Abishag (; Avishag) was a beautiful young woman of Shunem chosen to be a helper and servant to King David in his old age. Among Abishag&#x27;s duties was to lie next to David and pass along her body heat and vigor because &quot;they put covers on him, but he could not get warm&quot;. 

==Biblical narrative==
1 Kings 1:4 notes that David did not engage in sexual intercourse with her. When brought to David, she was a &quot;na&#x27;arah&quot;, which indicates youth or virginity but not necessarily both. Nonetheless, there are elements of Jewish exegetical tradition which maintain that David engaged in anal intercourse with Abishag and he was not totally impotent. It is speculated that King David engaged in a multicoital act of intercourse with his wife Bathsheba in his old age precisely to prove his continued virility.

After David&#x27;s death, Adonijah (David&#x27;s fourth and eldest surviving son) persuaded Bathsheba, King Solomon&#x27;s mother, to entreat the king to permit him to marry Abishag. Solomon suspected in this request an aspiration to the throne, since Abishag was considered David&#x27;s concubine, and so ordered Adonijah&#x27;s assassination (1 Kings 2:17–25). In the earlier story of Absalom&#x27;s rebellion, it is noted that having sexual relations with the former king&#x27;s concubine is a way of proclaiming oneself to be the new king. Adonijah may have asked to marry her at the suggestion of his mother.

Some scholars point to the possibility that Abishag is the female protagonist in the Song of Songs.

Later Jewish midrashic and Christian traditions paid little attention to Abishag&#x27;s role. Rashi refers to her as a &quot;meḥomemet&quot;, or &quot;warmer&quot;. Modern commentaries and translators have variously described her as a &quot;housekeeper&quot;, &quot;hot-water bottle&quot;, &quot;heating pad,&quot; &quot;attendant&quot; or &quot;bedfellow&quot;, though she is twice referred to as a &quot;sokenet&quot; in the text of Kings. This term, when applied to a male (&quot;soken&quot;), is often translated &quot;administrator&quot; or &quot;palace steward&quot; in Isaiah 22:15, leading some to believe she may have had a broader role and responsibilities. Other commentaries describe her role as being a nurse to the frail King David.

Abishag&#x27;s experiences have provided inspiration for contemporary writers including Rainer Maria Rilke, Itzik Manger, Louise Gluck and Shirley Kaufman. The story is referred to allegorically at the end of the first part of the final volume (The Cross or in the original Norwegian, Korset) of Kristin Lavransdatter by Sigrid Undset. Abishag&#x27;s name, although not her story, is invoked to begin Robert Frost&#x27;s poem &quot;Provide, Provide.&quot;

<text>Abishua ( &quot;ʾĂḇīšūaʿ&quot;, &quot;my father is rescue&quot;) was an early High priest of Israel.
Abishua is mentioned in the books 1 Chronicles (6:3-5) and Ezra (7:5) as the son of the High Priest Phinehas, son of Eleazar. As such, he is the great-grandson of Aaron, the brother of Moses and first High Priest. It is likely that Abishua was a contemporary of the Israelite judge Ehud and the Moabite king Eglon.

According to Josephus and other extrabiblical sources, he succeeded his father as High Priest (Antiquities 5.11.5; 8.1.3).

==Name and namesakes==
*The meaning of the name &quot;Abishua&quot; is uncertain, but may be &quot;the (divine) father is opulence.&quot;
*The name also appears in reference to a grandson of Benjamin in 1 Chronicles 8:4.

<text>In Christianity, ablution is a prescribed washing of part or all of the body or possessions, such as clothing or ceremonial objects, with the intent of purification or dedication. In Christianity, both baptism and footwashing are forms of ablution. Prior to praying the canonical hours at seven fixed prayer times, Oriental Orthodox Christians wash their hands and face (cf. &quot;Agpeya&quot;, &quot;Shehimo&quot;). In liturgical churches, ablution can refer to purifying fingers or vessels related to the Eucharist. In the New Testament, washing also occurs in reference to rites of Judaism part of the action of a healing by Jesus, the preparation of a body for burial, the washing of nets by fishermen, a person&#x27;s personal washing of the face to appear in public, the cleansing of an injured person&#x27;s wounds, Pontius Pilate&#x27;s washing of his hands as a symbolic claim of innocence and foot washing, which is a rite within the Christian Churches. According to the Gospel of Matthew, Pontius Pilate declared himself innocent of the blood of Jesus by washing his hands. This act of Pilate may not, however, have been borrowed from the custom of the Jews. The same practice was common among the Greeks and Romans.

According to Christian tradition, the Pharisees carried the practice of ablution to great excess. The Gospel of Mark refers to their ceremonial ablutions: &quot;For the Pharisees…wash their hands &#x27;oft&#x27;&quot; or, more accurately, &quot;with the fist&quot; (R.V., &quot;diligently&quot;); or, as Theophylact of Bulgaria explains it, &quot;up to the elbow,&quot; referring to the actual word used in the Greek New Testament, πυγμή &quot;pygmē&quot;, which refers to the arm from the elbow to the tips of the fingers. In the Book of Acts, Paul and other men performed ablution before entering the Temple in Jerusalem: &quot;Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification, until that an offering should be offered for every one of them.&quot;

In the Old Testament, ablution was considered a prerequisite to approaching God, whether by means of sacrifice, prayer, or entering a holy place. Around the time of Tertullian, an early Church Father, it was customary for Christians to wash their hands (&quot;manulavium&quot;), head (&quot;capitilavium&quot;) and feet (&quot;pedilavium&quot;) before prayer, as well as before receiving Holy Communion. The rite of footwashing employed a basin of water and linen towels, done in the imitation of Christ (as recorded by the early Christian apologist Tertullian). Churches from the time of Constantine the Great were thus built with an exonarthex that included a cantharus where Christians would wash their hands, face and feet before entering the worship space. The practice of ablutions before prayer and worship in Christianity symbolizes &quot;separation from sins of the spirit and surrender to the Lord.&quot;

The Bible has many rituals of purification relating to menstruation, childbirth, sexual relations, nocturnal emission, unusual bodily fluids, skin disease, death, and animal sacrifices. The Biblical rituals of purification ranging in areas from the mundane private rituals of personal hygiene and toilet etiquette to the complex public rituals of social etiquette. John Chrysostom, a prominent Church Father of Christianity revered in the Orthodox, Nestorian, Catholic, Lutheran and Anglican traditions, taught that people should wash their hands before picking up a copy of the Bible (he enjoined women to wear a headcovering if they were not already veiled at home prior to touching the Bible). This is to show respect for the Bible and in the Middle East and in the Indian subcontinent, Christians place their copies of Scripture in a rehal to have it rest in an elevated position. The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church prescribes several kinds of hand washing for example after leaving the latrine, lavatory or bathhouse, or before prayer, or after eating a meal. The women in the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church are prohibited from entering the church temple during menses; and the men do not enter a church the day after they have had intercourse with their wives. 
Christianity has always placed a strong emphasis on hygiene. The early Church denounced the mixed bathing prevalent in Roman pools, as well as the pagan custom of women naked bathing in front of men; as such the Didascalia Apostolorum, an early Christian manual, enjoined believing men and women to use baths that were separated by gender, which contributed to hygiene and good health according to the Church Father Clement of Alexandria. The Church also built public bathing facilities that were separate for both sexes near monasteries and pilgrimage sites; also, the popes situated baths within church basilicas and monasteries since the early Middle Ages. Pope Gregory the Great urged his followers on value of bathing as a bodily need. Contrary to popular belief bathing and sanitation were not lost in Europe with the collapse of the Roman Empire. Soapmaking first became an established trade during the so-called &quot;Dark Ages&quot;. The Romans used scented oils (mostly from Egypt), among other alternatives. By the mid-19th century, the English urbanised middle classes had formed an ideology of cleanliness that ranked alongside typical Victorian concepts, such as Christianity, respectability and social progress. The Salvation Army has adopted movement of the deployment of the personal hygiene, and by providing personal hygiene products.

== Ablution in the Bible ==

The Bible has many rituals of purification relating to menstruation, childbirth, sexual relations, nocturnal emission, unusual bodily fluids, skin disease, death, and animal sacrifices. In the Old Testament, ablution was considered a prerequisite to approaching God, whether by means of sacrifice, prayer, or entering a holy place.

The Bible includes various regulations about bathing:
:And whoever he that hath issue (a &quot;zav&quot;, ejaculant with an unusual discharge) touches without having rinsed his hands in water, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening.()
A subsequent seven clean days are then required, culminating in a ritual and temple offering before the &quot;zav&quot; is clean of his malady:
:Now in case the one having a running discharge would become clean from his running discharge, he must then count for himself seven days for his purification, and he must wash his garments and bathe his flesh in running water; and he must be clean. And on the eighth day he should take for himself two turtledoves or two young pigeons, and he must come to the entrance of the tent of meeting and give them to the priest.()

And also references to hand-washing:
:I will wash my hands in innocence; so will I compass Thine altar, O LORD ()

The Mikveh in the Bible is a bath used for the purpose of ritual immersion. The word is employed in its broader sense but generally means a collection of water. Several biblical regulations specify that full immersion in water is required to regain ritual purity after ritually impure incidents have occurred. A person was required to be ritually pure in order to enter the Temple. In this context, &quot;purity&quot; and &quot;impurity&quot; are imperfect translations of the Hebrew &quot;tahara&quot; and &quot;tumah&quot;, respectively, in that the negative connotation of the word impurity is not intended; rather being &quot;impure&quot; is indicative of being in a state in which certain things are prohibited until one has become &quot;pure&quot; again by immersion in a mikveh.

After the destruction of the Temple, the mikveh&#x27;s main uses remained as follows:
* by women to achieve ritual purity after menstruation or childbirth before she and her husband may resume marital relations;
* by men to achieve ritual purity;
* to immerse newly acquired utensils used in serving and eating food.

== Ablution in the Christian traditions ==

Traditionally, Christianity adhered to the biblical regulation requiring the purification of women after childbirth; this practice, was adapted into a special ritual known as the churching of women, for which there exists liturgy in the Church of England&#x27;s Book of Common Prayer, but its use is now rare in Western Christianity. The churching of women is still performed in a number of Eastern Christian churches (Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox and Eastern Catholic churches).

Oriental Orthodox Churches such as the Coptic Orthodox, Ethiopian Orthodox, Eritrean Orthodox, places a heavier emphasis on Old Testament teachings, and its followers adhere to certain practices such as observing days of ritual purification. Before praying, they wash their hands and face in order to be clean before and present their best to God. The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church prescribes several kinds of hand washing for example after leaving the latrine, lavatory or bathhouse, or before prayer, or after eating a meal. The women in the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church are prohibited from entering the church temple during menses; and the men do not enter a church the day after they have had intercourse with their wives.

Roman Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, Lutherans and High church Anglicans are also traditionally required to regularly attend confession, as a form of ritual purification from sin, especially as preparation before receiving the Eucharist. For Catholics, this is required at least once a year and required for those who are guilty of unconfessed mortal sins.

In Reformed tradition, ritual purity is achieved through the Confession of Sins, and Assurance of Forgiveness, and Sanctification. Through the power of the Holy Spirit, believers offer their whole being and labor as a &#x27;living sacrifice&#x27;; and cleanliness becomes a way of life (See Romans 12:1, and John 13:5–10 (the Washing of the Feet).

In Anabaptist Christianity (inclusive of Mennonites, Amish, Hutterites, Bruderhof, Schwarzenau Brethren, River Brethren and Apostolic Christians), footwashing is regularly practiced as an ordinance, in obedience to Jesus&#x27; command in .

=== Washing before Christian prayer and worship ===

The early Church practiced footwashing, in addition to the Holy Kiss, prior to reception of the Eucharist. The early Christian apologist Tertullian referenced a basin &quot;of water for the saints&#x27; feet&quot;, and a &quot;linen towel&quot;, used during their &quot;imitation of the feetwashing performed by Christ.&quot; The early Church Father Clement of Alexandria linked the new sandals given by to Prodigal Son with feetwashing, describing &quot;non-perishable shoes that are only fit to be worn by those who have had their feet washed by Jesus, the Teacher and Lord.&quot; The early Church thus saw footwashing to be connected to repentance, involving a spiritual cleansing by Jesus.

A cantharus is a fountain used by Christians for ablution before entering a church. These ablutions involve the washing of the hands, head, and feet. The cantharus is traditionally located in the exonarthex of the church. The water emitted by a cantharus is to be running water. The practice of ablutions before prayer and worship in Christianity symbolizes &quot;separation from sins of the spirit and surrender to the Lord.&quot; Eusebius recorded this practice of canthari located in the courtyards of churches, for the faithful to wash themselves (especially the hands and feet) before entering a Christian house of worship. The practice has its origins Jewish practice of performing ablutions before entering into the presence of God (cf. ). Though canthari are not as prevalent anymore in Western Christianity, they are found in Eastern Christian and Oriental Christian churches.

== History ==
Christianity has always placed a strong emphasis on hygiene, and water plays a role in the Christian rituals. The early Christian Church denounced the practice of mixed bathing in Roman pools, as well as the pagan custom of women naked bathing in front of men; as such the Didascalia Apostolorum, an early Christian manual, enjoined believing men and women to go to bathing facilities separated by gender, which contributed to hygiene and good health according to the Church Fathers, including Clement of Alexandria and Tertullian. The Church also built public bathing facilities that were separate for both sexes near monasteries and pilgrimage sites; also, the popes situated baths within church basilicas and monasteries since the early Middle Ages. Pope Gregory the Great urged his followers on value of bathing as a bodily need.

Great bathhouses were built in Byzantine centers such as Constantinople and Antioch, and the popes allocated to the Romans bathing through &quot;diaconia&quot;, or private Lateran baths, or even a myriad of monastic bath houses functioning in eighth and ninth centuries. Popes maintained their baths in their residences which described by scholar Paolo Squatriti as &quot; luxurious baths&quot;, and bath houses including hot baths incorporated into Christian Church buildings or those of monasteries, which known as &quot;charity baths&quot; because they served both the clerics and needy poor people. Public bathing were common in medivail Christendom larger towns and cities such as Paris, Regensburg and Naples. Catholic religious orders of the Augustinians&#x27; and Benedictines&#x27; rules contained ritual purification, and inspired by Benedict of Nursia encouragement for the practice of therapeutic bathing; Benedictine monks played a role in the development and promotion of spas. Protestant Christianity also played a prominent role in the development of the British spas.

In circa 1454 pope Nicholas V commissioned building a bath palace in Viterbo, and the construction at the &quot;Bagno del Papa&quot; was continued on through the reigns of several popes after Nicholas V. The Vatican accounts mention of payments &quot;for building done at the bath palace of Viterbo&quot; during the reigns of Calixtus III, Paul II, and Sixtus IV. There also is evidence Pope Pius II was responsible for the addition of a western wing to the building.

Contrary to popular belief bathing and sanitation were not lost in Europe with the collapse of the Roman Empire, as the spread of the Black Death made &quot;Medieval people look for a link between health and hygiene&quot;. Soapmaking first became an established trade during the so-called &quot;Dark Ages&quot;. The Romans used scented oils (mostly from Egypt), among other alternatives. By the 15th century, the manufacture of soap in the Christendom had become virtually industrialized, with sources in Antwerp, Castile, Marseille, Naples and Venice. 

By the mid-19th century, the English urbanised middle classes had formed an ideology of cleanliness that ranked alongside typical Victorian concepts, such as Christianity, respectability and social progress. The Salvation Army has adopted movement of the deployment of the personal hygiene, and by providing personal hygiene products, such as a toothbrush, toothpaste, and soap. A major contribution of the Christian missionaries in Africa, China, Guatemala, India, Indonesia, Korea, and other places was better health care of the people through hygiene and introducing and distributing the soaps, and &quot;cleanliness and hygiene became an important marker of being identified as a Christian&quot;.

Believing that on Epiphany day water becomes holy and is imbued with special powers, Eastern Orthodox cut holes in the ice of lakes and rivers, often in the shape of the cross, to bathe in the freezing water. Christianity strongly affected the development of holy wells in Europe and the Middle East, and its water are known for its healing properties.

The use of water in many Christian countries is due in part to the Biblical toilet etiquette which encourages washing after all instances of defecation. The bidet is common in predominantly Catholic countries where water is considered essential for anal cleansing, and in some traditionally Orthodox and Lutheran countries such as Greece and Finland respectively, where bidet showers are common.

==Eucharistic ablutions==
===Western Christian===
In the Roman Rite, the celebrant washes his hands before vesting for Mass, but with another prayer (&quot;Da, Domine, virtutem&quot;). This is said privately in the vestry. He will then wash his hands again after the offertory—this is the ceremony that is known as the &quot;lavabo&quot; proper. This washing appears in both the Tridentine Mass, the 1962 edition of which is still an authorized extraordinary form of the Roman Rite, and in the post-Vatican II Mass. The reason for this &quot;second&quot; washing of hands probably developed from the long ceremony of receiving the loaves and vessels of wine from the people at the offertory that was used in Rome. In the Gallican Rite the offerings were prepared before Mass began, as in the Eastern Liturgy of Preparation, so there was no long version of the offertory nor place for a lavabo before the Eucharistic Prayer. In the Middle Ages, the Roman Rite actually had two washing of hands, one before and one after the offertory. This first one has since disappeared, and the one which remains is the second.

In the Tridentine Mass, as well as in Lutheran Masses of Evangelical Catholic churchmanship and in Anglican Masses of Anglo-Catholic churchmanship, the term &quot;ablutions&quot; refers to when the priest rinses his hands first in wine and then in water following the Communion. It is to be distinguished from the lavabo, when the celebrant washes his hands with water only, reciting the words of (KJV—in the Septuagint it is Psalm 25) at the offertory.

In the common Mass of Paul VI, the Lutheran Divine Service and the Anglican Eucharist the priest does not normally use wine to wash his hands at the ablution, although this is permitted, but only water.

===Eastern and Oriental Christian===

Prior to praying the canonical hours at seven fixed prayer times, Oriental Orthodox Christians wash their hands, face and feet (cf. &quot;Agpeya&quot;, &quot;Shehimo&quot;).

In the Eastern Orthodox and Greek-Catholic Churches, the term &quot;ablution&quot; refers to consuming the remainder of the Gifts (the Body and Blood of Christ) at the end of the Divine Liturgy. Holy Communion is always received in both Species (the Body and the Blood of Christ) not only by the clergy but also by the faithful. This is accomplished by placing the particles of the consecrated Lamb (bread) into the chalice, and distributing Communion to the faithful with a spoon. The portion which remains in the chalice afterwards must be consumed.

The ablutions will normally be performed by the deacon, but if no deacon is serving the priest will do them. After the Litany of Thanksgiving that follows Communion, the deacon will come into the sanctuary and kneel, placing his forehead on the Holy Table (Altar) and the priest will bless him to consume the Gifts, which is done at the Prothesis (Table of Oblation). First, using the liturgical spoon he will consume all of the Body and Blood of Christ which remain in the chalice. Then he will pour hot water on the diskos (paten), which is then poured into the chalice and consumed (this is to consume any particles that may remain on the diskos). Next the liturgical spear, spoon and chalice will be rinsed first with wine and then with hot water, which are then consumed. All of the sacred vessels are then wiped dry with a towel, wrapped in their cloth coverings and put away.

Because the ablutions necessarily require consuming the Holy Mysteries (the Body and Blood of Christ), a priest or deacon may only perform them after having fully prepared himself through fasting and the lengthy Preparation for Holy Communion.

When a priest must take Holy Communion to the sick or homebound, if he has not prepared himself to receive the Holy Mysteries, he may ablute the chalice by pouring water into it and asking the one to whom he brought the Sacrament (or a Baptized child who because of their youth is not obliged to prepare for Communion) to consume the ablution.

If the Reserved Mysteries should become moldy, they must still be consumed in the same manner as the ablutions after Liturgy (normally, a fair amount of wine would be poured over them before consuming them, in order to soften and disinfect them). They should not be burned or buried. To prevent this, when the Mysteries are to be reserved for the sick, they should be thoroughly dried before being placed in the Tabernacle.

==Baptismal ablutions==
In Orthodox Christianity, there is also an ablution performed on the eighth day after Baptism. Immediately after being Baptized, every person, including an infant, is confirmed using the Mystery (Sacrament) of Chrismation. In the early church, the places where the person was anointed with Chrism were carefully bandaged, and were kept covered for eight days. During this period, the newly illumined (newly baptized person) would also wear his baptismal robe every day. At the end of the eight days, the priest would remove the bandages and baptismal garment and perform ablutions over him. While the bandaging no longer takes place, the ritual ablutions are still performed.

The newly illumined (newly baptized person) is brought back to the church by his Godparents for the ablutions. The priest stands him in the center of the church, in front of the Holy Doors, facing east. He loosens the belt of the baptismal robe and prays for him, that God may preserve the newly illumined in purity and illumine him by grace. He then dips a sponge in water and sprinkles him in the sign of the cross saying: &quot;Thou art justified. Thou art illumined. Thou art sanctified. Thou art washed: in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.&quot; Then, as he says the next prayer, he washes each of the places where he had been anointed with Chrism. Next he performs the Tonsure, symbolic of the life of self-sacrifice a Christian must lead. In modern practice, these ablutions are performed at the end of the baptism service, after the first reception of Holy Communion.

==Washing of feet==
Many Christian churches practice a ceremony of the Washing of Feet, following the example of Jesus in the Gospel. Some interpret this as an ordinance which the church is obliged to practice, as with Anabaptist Christianity (inclusive of Mennonites, Amish, Hutterites, Bruderhof, Schwarzenau Brethren, River Brethren and Apostolic Christians).

St. Benedict of Nursia lays out in his Rule that the feet of visitors to the monastery should be washed, and also that those who are assigned to serve in the kitchen that week should wash the feet of all the brethren. At one time, most of the European monarchs also performed the Washing of Feet in their royal courts on Maundy Thursday, a practice continued by the Austro-Hungarian Emperor and the King of Spain up to the beginning of the 20th century (see Royal Maundy).

Foot washing is also observed by numerous traditions, including Anabaptists, Seventh-day Adventist, Pentecostal, and Radical Pietistic groups, and several types of Southern Baptists. 
Foot washing rites are also practiced by many Roman Catholic, Lutheran, Anglican and Methodist churches, whereby foot washing is most often experienced in connection with Maundy Thursday services and, sometimes, at ordination services where the Bishop may wash the feet of those who are to be ordained. Often in these services, the bishop will wash the feet of the clergy, and in monasteries the Abbot will wash the feet of the brethren. Though history shows that foot washing has at times been practiced in connection with baptism, and at times as a separate occasion, by far its most common practice has been in connection with the Lord&#x27;s supper service. The Moravian Church practiced Foot Washing until 1818. There has been some revival of the practice as other liturgical churches have also rediscovered the practice.

==Ablutions for the dead==
When an Orthodox Christian dies, their body is washed and dressed before burial. Although this custom is not considered to impose any sort of ritual purity, it is an important aspect of charitable care for the departed. Ideally, this should not be deferred to an undertaker, but should be performed by family members or friends of the deceased.

When an Orthodox priest or bishop dies, these ablutions and vesting are performed by the clergy, saying the same prayers for each vestment that are said when the departed bishop or priest vested for the Divine Liturgy. After the body of a Bishop is washed and vested, he is seated in a chair and the Dikirion and Trikirion are placed in his hands for the final time.

When an Orthodox monk dies, his body is washed and clothed in his monastic habit by brethren of his monastery. Two significant differences are that when his mantle is placed on him, its hem is torn to form bands, with which his body is bound (like Lazarus in the tomb), and his klobuk is placed on his head backwards, so that the monastic veil covers his face (to show that he had already died to the world, even before his physical death). When an Orthodox nun dies, the sisterhood of her convent performs the same ministrations for her as are done for monks.

In the Roman Catholic Church, the Absoute (or &quot;absolution of the dead&quot;) is a symbolic ablution of the deceased&#x27;s body following the Requiem Mass. While specific prayers are said, the coffin is incensed and sprinkled with holy water. The absolution of the dead is only performed in context of the Tridentine Mass. Following the Second Vatican Council, the absolution of the dead was removed from the funeral liturgy of the Mass of Paul VI.

== Washing and anointing ==
Washing and anointing (also called the &quot;initiatory&quot;) is a temple ordinance practiced by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and Mormon fundamentalists as part of the faith&#x27;s endowment ceremony. It is a purification ritual for adults, usually performed at least a year after baptism. The ordinance is performed by the authority of the Melchizedek priesthood by an officiator of the same sex as the participant.

In the ritual, a person is sprinkled with water to symbolically wash away the &quot;blood and sins of this generation.&quot; After the washing, the person is then anointed to become a &quot;king and priest&quot; or a &quot;queen and priestess&quot; in the afterlife.

Once washed and anointed, the participant is dressed in the temple garment, a religious undergarment which the participant is instructed to wear throughout his or her life. (Since 2005, participants in the LDS Church version of the ritual already come clothed in this garment prior to the washing and anointing.) Finally, the participant is given a &quot;new name&quot; which he or she is instructed never to reveal except under certain conditions in the temple.

Mormons link the ritual to biblical washings and anointings. The temple garment symbolizes the skins of clothing given to Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, and the &quot;new name&quot; is linked to Revelation 2:17, which states that God will give those who overcome &quot;a white stone with a new name written on it, known only to him who receives it.&quot;

<doc id="68555" wikidata="Q179294" url="?curid=68555" title="Eunuch">
<text>A eunuch ( ) is a male who has been castrated. Throughout history, castration often served a specific social function. The earliest records for intentional castration to produce eunuchs are from the Sumerian city of Lagash in the 2nd millennium BCE. Over the millennia since, they have performed a wide variety of functions in many different cultures: courtiers or equivalent domestics, for espionage or clandestine operations, &quot;castrato&quot; singers, concubines or sexual partners, religious specialists, soldiers, royal guards, government officials, and guardians of women or harem servants.

Eunuchs would usually be servants or slaves who had been castrated to make them less threatening servants of a royal court where physical access to the ruler could wield great influence. Seemingly lowly domestic functions—such as making the ruler&#x27;s bed, bathing him, cutting his hair, carrying him in his litter, or even relaying messages—could, in theory, give a eunuch &quot;the ruler&#x27;s ear&quot; and impart &quot;de facto&quot; power to the formally humble but trusted servant. Similar instances are reflected in the humble origins and etymology of many high offices.

Eunuchs supposedly did not generally have loyalties to the military, the aristocracy, or a family of their own (having neither offspring nor in-laws, at the very least). They were thus seen as more trustworthy and less interested in establishing a private dynasty. Because their condition usually lowered their social status, they could also be easily replaced or killed without repercussion. In cultures that had both harems and eunuchs, eunuchs were sometimes used as harem servants.

Eunuchs have been documented in several ancient and medieval societies, including the Byzantine Empire, Imperial China, the Ottoman Empire, and various Middle Eastern cultures. They often held significant power and influence in these societies, particularly in royal courts and harems.
==Etymology==
&quot;Eunuch&quot; comes from the Ancient Greek word (), first attested in a fragment of Hipponax, the 6th century BCE comic poet and prolific inventor of compound words. The acerbic poet describes a particular lover of fine food having &quot;consumed his estate dining lavishly and at leisure every day on tuna and garlic-honey cheese paté like a Lampsacene &quot;

The earliest surviving etymology of the word is from late antiquity. The 5th century (CE) &quot;Etymologicon&quot; by Orion of Thebes offers two alternative origins for the word eunuch: first, , &quot;guarding the bed&quot;, a derivation inferred from eunuchs&#x27; established role at the time as &quot;bedchamber attendants&quot; in the imperial palace, and second, , &quot;being good with respect to the mind&quot;, which Orion explains based on their &quot;being deprived of intercourse (), the things that the ancients used to call irrational (, literally: &#x27;mindless&#x27;)&quot;. Orion&#x27;s second option reflects well-established idioms in Ancient Greek, as shown by entries for , and in Liddell and Scott&#x27;s Greek-English Lexicon, while the first option is not listed as an idiom under in that standard reference work. However, the first option was cited by the late 9th century Byzantine emperor Leo VI in his New Constitution 98 banning the marriage of eunuchs, in which he noted eunuchs&#x27; reputation as trustworthy guardians of the marriage bed () and claimed that the very word eunuch attested to this kind of employment. The emperor also goes further than Orion by attributing eunuchs&#x27; lack of male–female intercourse specifically to castration, which he said was performed with the intention &quot;that they will no longer do the things that males do, or at least to extinguish whatever has to do with desire for the female sex&quot;. The 11th century Byzantine monk Nikon of the Black Mountain, opting instead for Orion&#x27;s second alternative, stated that the word came from ( &quot;good&quot; + &quot;mind&quot;), thus meaning &quot;to be well-minded, well-inclined, well-disposed or favorable&quot;, but unlike Orion he argued that this was due to the trust that certain jealous and suspicious foreign rulers placed in the loyalty of their eunuchized servants. Theophylact of Ohrid in a dialogue &quot;In Defence of Eunuchs&quot; also stated that the origin of the word was from &quot;eupnoeic&quot; and &quot;ekhein&quot;, &quot;to have, hold&quot;, since they were always &quot;well-disposed&quot; toward the master who &quot;held&quot; or owned them. The 12th century &quot;Etymologicum Magnum&quot; (s.v. &quot;eunoukhos&quot;) essentially repeats the entry from Orion, but stands by the first option, while attributing the second option to what &quot;some say&quot;. In the late 12th century, Eustathius of Thessalonica (&quot;Commentaries on Homer&quot; 1256.30, 1643.16) offered an original derivation of the word from &quot;eunis&quot; + &quot;okheuein&quot;, &quot;deprived of mating&quot;.

In translations of the Bible into modern European languages, such as the Luther Bible or the King James Bible, the word &quot;eunuchs&quot; as found in the Latin Vulgate is usually rendered as an officer, official or chamberlain, consistent with the idea that the original meaning of eunuch was bed-keeper (Orion&#x27;s first option). Modern religious scholars have been disinclined to assume that the courts of Israel and Judah included castrated men, even though the original translation of the Bible into Greek used the word &quot;eunoukhos&quot;.

The early 17th-century scholar and theologian Gerardus Vossius therefore explains that the word originally designated an office, and he affirms the view that it was derived from &quot;eunē&quot; and &quot;ekhein&quot; (i.e. &quot;bed-keeper&quot;). He says the word came to be applied to castrated men in general because such men were the usual holders of that office. Still, Vossius notes the alternative etymologies offered by Eustathius (&quot;deprived of mating&quot;) and others (&quot;having the mind in a good state&quot;), calling these analyses &quot;quite subtle&quot;. Then, after having previously declared that eunuch designated an office (i.e., not a personal characteristic), Vossius ultimately sums up his argument in a different way, saying that the word &quot;originally signified continent men&quot; to whom the care of women was entrusted, and later came to refer to castration because &quot;among foreigners&quot; that role was performed &quot;by those with mutilated bodies&quot;.

Modern etymologists have followed Orion&#x27;s first option. In an influential 1925 essay on the word eunuch and related terms, Ernst Maass suggested that Eustathius&#x27;s derivation &quot;can or must be laid to rest&quot;, and he affirmed the derivation from &quot;eunē&quot; and &quot;ekhein&quot; (&quot;guardian of the bed&quot;), without mentioning the other derivation from &quot;eunoos&quot; and &quot;ekhein&quot; (&quot;having a well-disposed state of mind&quot;).

In Latin, the words &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot; (Greek: &quot;spadon&quot;), and &quot;&quot; were used to denote eunuchs.

==Non-castrated eunuchs==
The term &quot;eunuch&quot; has sometimes figuratively been used for a wide range of men who were seen to be physically unable to procreate. Hippocrates describes the Scythians as being afflicted with high rates of erectile dysfunction and thus &quot;the most eunuchoid of all nations&quot; (Airs Waters Places 22). In the &quot;Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, A Latin Dictionary&quot;, the term literally used for impotent males is &quot;spado&quot; but may also be used for eunuchs.

Some men have falsified the status of their castration to gain entrance into the palace. Chinese eunuch Lao Ai, for instance, became the lover of the mother of Qin Shi Huang, who bore him two sons, before Lao Ai and his sons were executed after participating in a rebellion against Qin Shi Huang.

==Asia and Africa==
In Siam (modern Thailand) Indian Muslims from the Coromandel Coast served as eunuchs in the Thai palace and court. The Thai at times asked eunuchs from China to visit the court in Thailand and advise them on court ritual since they held them in high regard.

In Imperial China, eunuchs managed the imperial household and were involved in state affairs, often wielding significant political power.

Sir Henry Yule saw many Muslims serving as eunuchs during the Konbaung dynasty period of Burma (modern Myanmar) while on a diplomatic mission.

===China===

In China, castration included removal of the penis as well as the testicles (see emasculation). Both organs were cut off with a knife at the same time.

Eunuchs existed in China from about 4,000 years ago, were imperial servants by 3,000 years ago, and were common as civil servants by the time of the Qin dynasty. From those ancient times until the Sui dynasty, castration was both a traditional punishment (one of the Five Punishments) and a means of gaining employment in the imperial service. Certain eunuchs, such as the Ming dynasty official Zheng He, gained immense power that occasionally superseded that of even the Grand Secretaries. Self-castration was a common practice, although it was not always performed completely, which led to it being made illegal.

It is said that the justification for the employment of eunuchs as high-ranking civil servants was that, since they were incapable of having children, they would not be tempted to seize power and start a dynasty. In many cases, eunuchs were considered more reliable than the scholar-officials. As a symbolic assignment of heavenly authority to the palace system, a constellation of stars was designated as the Emperor&#x27;s, and, to the west of it, four stars were identified as his &quot;eunuchs.&quot;

The tension between eunuchs in the service of the emperor and virtuous Confucian officials is a familiar theme in Chinese history. In his &quot;History of Government&quot;, Samuel Finer points out that reality was not always that clear-cut. There were instances of very capable eunuchs who were valuable advisers to their emperor, and the resistance of the &quot;virtuous&quot; officials often stemmed from jealousy on their part. Ray Huang argues that in reality, eunuchs represented the personal will of the Emperor, while the officials represented the alternative political will of the bureaucracy. The clash between them would thus have been a clash of ideologies or political agenda.

The number of eunuchs in imperial employ fell to 470 by 1912, when the practice of using them ceased. The last imperial eunuch, Sun Yaoting, died in December 1996.

===Indian subcontinent===
====Eunuchs in Indian sultanates (before the Mughals)====
Eunuchs were frequently employed in imperial palaces by some Muslim rulers as servants for female royalty, as guards of the royal harem, and as sexual mates for the nobles. Some of them attained high-status positions in society. An early example of such a high-ranking eunuch was Malik Kafur. Eunuchs in imperial palaces were organized in a hierarchy, often with a senior or Chief Eunuch (Urdu: &quot;Khwaja Saras&quot;), directing junior eunuchs below him. Eunuchs were highly valued for their strength and trustworthiness, allowing them to live amongst women with fewer worries. This enabled eunuchs to serve as messengers, watchmen, attendants and guards for palaces. Often, eunuchs also doubled as part of the King&#x27;s court of advisers.

====The hijra of South Asia====

Hijra, a Hindi term traditionally translated into English as &quot;eunuch&quot;, actually refers to what modern Westerners would call transvestites or transgender women (although some of them reportedly identify as belonging to a third gender). The history of this third sex is mentioned in the ancient &quot;Kama Sutra&quot;, which refers to people of a &quot;third sex&quot; (&quot;tritiya-prakriti&quot;). Some of them undergo ritual castration, but the vast majority do not.

They usually dress in saris or shalwar kameez (traditional garbs worn by women in South Asia) and wear heavy make-up. They typically live on the margins of society and face discrimination. Hijra tend to have few options for earning a wage, with many turning to sex work and others performing ritualistic songs and dances. They are integral to several Hindu ceremonies, such as dance programs at marriage ceremonies. They may also earn a living by going uninvited to large ceremonies such as weddings, births, new shop openings and other major family events, and singing until they are paid or given gifts to go away. The ceremony is supposed to bring good luck and fertility, while the curse of an unappeased hijra is feared by many. Hijra often engage in prostitution and begging to earn money, with begging typically accompanied by singing and dancing. Some Indian provincial officials have used the assistance of hijras to collect taxes in the same fashion—they knock on the doors of shopkeepers, while dancing and singing, embarrassing them into paying. Recently, hijras have started to found organizations to improve their social condition and fight discrimination, such as the Shemale Foundation Pakistan.

===Korea===
The eunuchs of Korea, called , were officials to the king and other royalty in traditional Korean society. The first recorded appearance of a Korean eunuch was in Goryeosa (&quot;History of Goryeo&quot;), a compilation about the Goryeo dynasty period. In 1392, with the founding of the Joseon dynasty, the &quot;naesi&quot; system was revised, and the department was renamed the &quot;Department of &quot;Naesi&quot;&quot;.

The &quot;naesi&quot; system included two ranks, those of , who held the official title of senior second rank, and , both of which held rank as officers. A total of 140 &quot;naesi&quot; served the palace in the Joseon dynasty period. They also took the exam on Confucianism every month. The &quot;naesi&quot; system was repealed in 1894 following Gabo reform.

During the Yuan dynasty of China, eunuchs became a desirable commodity for tributes.

Eunuchs were the only males outside the royal family allowed to stay inside the palace overnight. Court records going back to 1392 indicate that the average lifespan of eunuchs was 70.0 ± 1.76 years, which was 14.4–19.1 years longer than the lifespan of non-castrated men of similar socioeconomic status.

===Vietnam===

The Vietnamese adopted the eunuch system and castration techniques from China. Records show that the Vietnamese performed castration in a painful procedure by removing the entire genitalia with both penis and testicles being cut off with a sharp knife or metal blade. The procedure was agonizing since the entire penis was cut off. The young man&#x27;s thighs and abdomen would be tied and others would pin him down on a table. The genitals would be washed with pepper water and then cut off. A tube would be then inserted into the urethra to allow urination during healing. Many Vietnamese eunuchs were products of self castration to gain access to the palaces and power. In other cases they might be paid to become eunuchs. They served in many capacities, from supervising public works, to investigating crimes, to reading public proclamations.

===West Asia and North Africa===
====Ancient====
The four-thousand-year-old Egyptian Execration Texts threaten enemies in Nubia and Asia, specifically referencing &quot;all males, all eunuchs, all women.&quot;

Castration was sometimes punitive; under Assyrian law, homosexual acts were punishable by castration.
Eunuchs were familiar figures in the Neo-Assyrian Empire ( &quot;the one who stands by the head of the king&quot;, often abbreviated as ; until 622 BCE) and in the court of the Egyptian pharaohs (down to the Lagid dynasty known as Ptolemies, ending with Cleopatra VII, 30 BCE). Eunuchs sometimes were used as regents for underage heirs to the throne, as it seems to be the case for the Syro-Hittite state of Carchemish.

Political eunuchism became a fully established institution among the Achaemenid Empire. Eunuchs (called , an Assyrian loanword) held powerful positions in the Achaemenid court. The eunuch Bagoas (not to be confused with Alexander&#x27;s Bagoas) was the vizier of Artaxerxes III and Artaxerxes IV, and was the primary power behind the throne during their reigns until he was killed by Darius III.

Marmon (1995) writes &quot;Mamluk biographies of the eunuchs often praise their appearance with adjectives such as &quot;jamil&quot; (beautiful), &quot;wasim&quot; (handsome), and &quot;ahsan&quot; (the best, most beautiful) or &quot;akmal&quot; (the most perfect).&quot;

====Arabian Peninsula====

The custom of using eunuchs as servants for women inside the Islamic harems had a preceding example in the life of Muhammad himself, who used the eunuch Mabur as a servant in the house of his own slave concubine Maria al-Qibtiyya; both of them slaves from Egypt.
Eunuchs were for a long time used in relatively small numbers, exclusively inside harems, but the use of eunuchs expanded significantly when eunuchs started being used also for other offices within service and administration outside of the harem, a use which expanded gradually during the Umayyad Caliphate and had its breakthrough during the Abbasid Caliphate. During the Abbasid period, eunuchs became a permanent institution inside the Islamic harems after the model of the Abbasid harem, such as in the Fatimid harem, Safavid harem and the Qajar harem.

For several centuries, Muslim Eunuchs were tasked with honored roles in Medina and Mecca. They are thought to have been instituted in their role there by Saladin, but perhaps earlier. Their tasks included caring for the Prophet&#x27;s Tomb, maintaining borders between males and females where needed, and keeping order in the sacred spaces. They were highly respected in their time and remained there throughout the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s control of the area and afterward. In the present day, it is reported that only a few remain.

Eunuchs were an active component in the slave market of the Islamic world until the early 20th-century for service in harem as well as in the corps of mostly African eunuchs, known as the Aghawat, who guarded the Prophet Muhammad&#x27;s tomb in Medina and the Kaʿba in Mecca.
Most slaves trafficked to Hijaz came there via the Red Sea slave trade. Small African boys were castrated before they were trafficked to the Hijaz, where they were bought at the slave market by the Chief Agha to become eunuch novices.
It was noted that boys from Africa were still openly bought to become eunuch novices to serve at Medina in 1895.
In Medina there was a part of town named Harat al-Aghawat (Neighborhood of the Aghas).
The Red Sea slave trade became gradually more suppressed during the 20th-century, and Slavery in Saudi Arabia was abolished in 1962. In 1979, the last Agha was appointed. In 1990 seventeen eunuchs remained.

====Fatimid Caliphate====

In the Isma&#x27;ili Fatimid Caliphate (909–1171 CE), eunuchs played major roles in the politics of the caliphate&#x27;s court within the institution of slavery in the Fatimid Caliphate. These eunuchs were normally purchased from slave auctions and typically came from a variety of Arab and non-Arab minority ethnic groups. In some cases, they were purchased from various noble families in the empire, which would then connect those families to the caliph. Generally, though, foreign slaves were preferred, described as the &quot;ideal servants&quot;.

Once enslaved, eunuchs were often placed into positions of significant power in one of four areas: the service of the male members of the court; the service of the Fatimid harem, or female members of the court; administrative and clerical positions; and military service. For example, during the Fatimid occupation of Cairo, Egyptian eunuchs controlled military garrisons (&quot;shurta&quot;) and marketplaces (&quot;hisba&quot;), two positions beneath only the city magistrate in power. However, the most influential Fatimid eunuchs were the ones in direct service to the caliph and the royal household as chamberlains, treasurers, governors, and attendants. Their direct proximity to the caliph and his household afforded them a great amount of political sway. One eunuch, Jawdhar, became &quot;hujja&quot; to Imam-Caliph al-Qa&#x27;im, a sacred role in Shia Islam entrusted with the imam&#x27;s choice of successor upon his death.

There were several other eunuchs of high regard in Fatimid history, mainly being Abu&#x27;l-Fadi Rifq al-Khadim and Abu&#x27;l-Futuh Barjawan al-Ustadh. Rifq was an African eunuch general who served as governor of the Damascus until he led an army of 30,000 men in a campaign to expand Fatimid control northeast to the city of Aleppo, Syria. He was noted for being able to unite a diverse group of Africans, Arabs, Bedouins, Berbers, and Turks into one coherent fighting force which was able to successfully combat the Mirdasids, Bedouins, and Byzantines.

Barjawan was a European eunuch during late Fatimid rule who gained power through his military and political savvy which brought peace between them and the Byzantine empire. Moreover, he squashed revolts in the Libya and the Levant. Given his reputation and power in the court and military he took the reins of the caliphate from his then student al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah; then ruled as the de facto Regent 997 CE. His usurpation of power from the caliph resulted in his assassination in 1000 CE on the orders of al-Hakim.

Since imams during this period ruled over a majority non-Shi&#x27;a population, the court eunuchs served an important informal role as ambassadors of the caliph, promoting loyalty and devotion to the Shi&#x27;a sect and the imam-caliph himself. The multicultural, multilingual eunuchs were able to connect to the commoners through shared cultural ground.

====Ottoman Empire====

During the period of slavery in the Ottoman Empire, eunuchs were typically slaves imported from outside their domains. A fair proportion of male slaves were imported as eunuchs.

The Ottoman court harem—within the Topkapı Palace (1465–1853) and later the Dolmabahçe Palace (1853–1909) in Istanbul—was under the administration of the eunuchs. These were of two categories: black eunuchs and white eunuchs. Black eunuchs were slaves from sub-Saharan Africa via the Trans-Saharan slave trade, the Red Sea slave trade or the Indian Ocean slave trade, who served the concubines and officials in the Harem together with chamber maidens of low rank.

The white eunuchs were slaves from the Balkans or the Caucasus, either purchased in the slave markets or taken as boys from Christian families in the Balkans who were unable to pay the &quot;jizya&quot; tax. They served the recruits at the Palace School and were from 1582 prohibited from entering the Harem. An important figure in the Ottoman court was the Chief Black Eunuch (&quot;Kızlar Ağası&quot; or &quot;Darüssaade Ağası&quot;). In control of both the harem and a net of spies among the black eunuchs, the Chief Eunuch was involved in almost every palace intrigue and thereby could gain power over either the sultan or one of his viziers, ministers, or other court officials.

One of the most powerful Chief Eunuchs was Beshir Agha in the 1730s, who played a crucial role in establishing the Ottoman version of Hanafi Islam throughout the Empire by founding libraries and schools.

=====Algiers=====
In the 16th century, an Englishman, Samson Rowlie, was captured and castrated to serve the Ottoman governor in Algiers.

=====Coptic involvement=====
In the 14th century, the Muslim Egyptian religious scholar Taj-al-Din Abu Nasr &#x27;Abdal-Wahhab al-Subki discussed eunuchs in his book &quot;Kitab Mu&#x27;id al-Ni&#x27;am wa Mubid al-Niqam&quot; (), a title that has been translated as &quot;Book of the Guide to [Divine] Benefits and Averting of [Divine] Vengeance&quot; and also as &quot;Book of Tutor of Graces and Annihilator of Misfortunes&quot;. In a chapter dedicated to eunuchs, Al-Subki made &quot;the clear implication that &#x27;eunuchness&#x27; is itself an office,&quot; Shaun Marmon explained, adding that al-Subki had specified occupational subgroups for the &quot;tawashiya&quot; [eunuchs]: the &quot;zimam&quot; watched over women, and the &quot;muqaddam al-mamalik&quot; over adolescent boys.

Edmund Andrews of Northwestern University, in an 1898 article called &quot;Oriental Eunuchs&quot; in &quot;The American Journal of Medicine&quot;, refers to Coptic priests in &quot;Abou Gerhè in Upper Egypt&quot; castrating slave boys.
Coptic castration of slaves was discussed by Peter Charles Remondino, in his book &quot;History of Circumcision from the Earliest Times to the Present&quot;, published in 1900. He refers to the &quot;Abou-Gerghè&quot; monastery in a place he calls &quot;Mount Ghebel-Eter&quot;. He adds details not mentioned by Andrews such as the insertion of bamboo into the victim. Bamboo was used with Chinese eunuchs. Andrews states his information is derived from an earlier work, &quot;Les Femmes, les eunuques, et les guerriers du Soudan&quot;, published by a French explorer, Count Raoul du Bisson, in 1868, though this detail does not appear in Du Bisson&#x27;s book.

Remondino&#x27;s claims were repeated in similar form by Henry G. Spooner in 1919, in the &quot;American Journal of Urology and Sexology&quot;. Spooner, an associate of William J. Robinson, referred to the monastery as &quot;Abou Gerbe in Upper Egypt&quot;.

According to Remondino, Spooner, and several later sources, the Coptic priests sliced the penis and testicles off Nubian or Abyssinian slave boys around the age of eight. The boys were captured from Abyssinia and other areas in Sudan like Darfur and Kordofan, then brought into Sudan and Egypt. During the operation, the Coptic clergyman chained the boys to tables, then, after slicing off their sexual organs, stuck a piece of bamboo into the urethra and submerged them in neck-high sand under the sun. The mortality rate was said to be high. Slave traders made especially large profits off eunuchs from this region.

==Ancient Greece, Rome, and Byzantium==

The practice was also well established in other Mediterranean areas among the Greeks and Romans, although a role as court functionary does not arise until Byzantine times. The Galli or Priests of Cybele were eunuchs.

In the late period of the Roman Empire, after the adoption of the oriental royal court model by the Emperors Diocletian (r. 284–305) and Constantine (r. 306–337), emperors were surrounded by eunuchs for such functions as bathing, haircutting, dressing, and bureaucratic functions, in effect acting as a shield between the emperor and his administrators from physical contact, thus enjoying great influence in the imperial court (see Eusebius and Eutropius). Julian (r. 361–363) released the eunuchs from their service because he felt they were overpaid, and he subsequently realized how much they had contributed to palace operations.

The Roman poet Martial rails against a woman who had sex with partially castrated eunuchs (those whose testicles were removed or rendered inactive only) in the bitter epigram (VI, 67): &quot;Do you ask, Panychus, why your Caelia only consorts with eunuchs? Caelia wants the flowers of marriage – not the fruits.&quot; It is up for debate whether this passage is representative of any sort of widely practiced behavior, however.

At the Byzantine imperial court, there were a great number of eunuchs employed in domestic and administrative functions, actually organized as a separate hierarchy, following a parallel career of their own. Archieunuchs—each in charge of a group of eunuchs—were among the principal officers in Constantinople, under the emperors. Under Justinian in the 6th century, the eunuch Narses functioned as a successful general in a number of campaigns.

Advantages of eunuchs were that they prevented offices from becoming hereditary, allowing appointments to be made on merit; they were more dedicated to their jobs, not being distracted by family obligations; and they were ineligible for the throne, and for that reason thought by emperors to be safe. Those who had been deprived not only of their testicles but also their penises were known in Greek as &quot;carzimasia&quot;, and were highly prized.

==Religious castration==
Castration as part of religious practice, and eunuchs occupying religious roles, have been established prior to classical antiquity. Archaeological finds at Çatalhöyük in Anatolia indicate worship of a &#x27;Magna Mater&#x27; figure, a forerunner of the goddess Cybele found in later Anatolia and other parts of the near East. Later Roman followers of Cybele were called Galli, who practiced ritual self-castration, known as &quot;sanguinaria&quot;. Eunuch priests also figured prominently in the Atargatis cult in Syria during the first centuries AD.

The practice of religious castration continued into the Christian era, with members of the early church practicing celibacy (including castration) for religious purposes, although the extent and even the existence of this practice among Christians is subject to debate. The early theologian Origen found evidence of the practice in : &quot;His disciples said to him, &#x27;If such is the case of a man with his wife, it is better not to marry.&#x27; But he said to them, &#x27;Not everyone can accept this teaching, but only those to whom it is given. For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let anyone accept this who can. &quot;(NRSV)&quot;

Tertullian, a 2nd-century Church Father, described Jesus himself and Paul of Tarsus as &quot;spadones&quot;, which is translated as &quot;eunuchs&quot; in some contexts. Quoting from the cited book: &quot;Tertullian takes &#x27;spado&#x27; to mean virgin&quot;. The meaning of &quot;spado&quot; in late antiquity can be interpreted as a metaphor for celibacy. Tertullian even goes so far with the metaphor as to say St. Paul had been &quot;castrated&quot;. Tertullian also ridiculed his theological opponent Marcion of Sinope as a eunuch who advocated for sexual abstinence.

Eunuch priests have served various goddesses from India for many centuries. Similar phenomena are exemplified by some modern Indian communities of the hijra, which are associated with a deity and with certain rituals and festivals – notably the devotees of Yellammadevi, or &quot;jogappas&quot;, who are not castrated, and the Ali of southern India, of whom at least some are.

The 18th-century Russian Skoptzy (&quot;скопцы&quot;) sect was an example of a castration cult, where its members regarded castration as a way of renouncing the sins of the flesh. Several members of the 20th-century Heaven&#x27;s Gate cult were found to have been castrated, apparently voluntarily and for the same reasons.

===In the Christian Bible===
The reference to &quot;eunuchs&quot; in Matthew 19:12 has yielded various interpretations.

One of the earliest converts to Christianity was an Ethiopian eunuch who was a high court official of Candace, the Queen of Ethiopia, but was already a eunuch at the time of conversion (Acts 8:27–39).

In the deuterocanonical Wisdom of Solomon, the eunuch who has done no lawless deed is praised and special favor is claimed to be shown to him.

===In Judaism===

Eunuchs are mentioned many times in the Bible, such as in the Book of Isaiah (56:4) using the word סריס (&quot;saris&quot;). Although the Ancient Hebrews did not practice castration, eunuchs were common in other cultures featured in the Bible, such as ancient Egypt, Assyria and Babylonia, the Achaemenid Empire, and ancient Rome. In the Book of Esther, servants of the Persian harem of Ahasuerus, such as Hegai and Shashgaz, as well as other servants such as Hatach, Harbonah, Bigthan, and Teresh, are referred to as &quot;sarisim&quot;. Being exposed to the consorts of the king, they would likely have been castrated.

The Hebrew word &quot;saris&quot; () derives from &quot;ša-rēši&quot;, the Akkadian word for eunuch, and thus has been generally understood by scholars as referring to eunuchs. However, its technical meaning is a male who has not shown signs of typical sexual maturity by the age of 20. Per the Talmud, only one known as a &quot;saris adam&quot; – a castrated male; one made sterile intentionally or via accidental injury – might be considered a eunuch (a &quot;saris ḥama&quot; is one who is congenitally sterile, and is not considered a eunuch).

== Environmental and social factors ==
The role of eunuchs in society was often dictated by social and cultural norms, as well as political necessities. For instance, eunuchs were seen as reliable because they could not produce heirs and thus were considered less likely to establish rival power bases. The practice of castration was often a means of ensuring loyalty and controlling certain populations.

==Castrato singers==

Eunuchs castrated before puberty were also valued and trained in several cultures for their exceptional voices, which retained a childlike and other-worldly flexibility and treble pitch (a high-pitched voice). Such eunuchs were known as castrati.

As women were sometimes forbidden to sing in Church, their place was taken by castrati. Castrati became very popular in 18th century opera seria. The practice, known as &quot;castratism&quot;, remained popular until the 18th century and was known into the 19th century. The last famous Italian castrato, Giovanni Battista Velluti, died in 1861. The sole existing sound recording of a castrato singer documents the voice of Alessandro Moreschi, the last eunuch in the Sistine Chapel Choir, who died in 1922.

This Italian practice of castrating young males to maintain their soprano voices was ended by Pope Leo XIII (1878).

<text>Akeldama (Aramaic: חקל דמא or 𐡇𐡒𐡋 𐡃𐡌𐡀 &quot;Ḥaqel D&#x27;ma&quot;, &quot;field of blood&quot;; Hebrew: חקל דמא; Arabic: حقل الدم, &quot;Ḥaqel Ad-dam&quot;) is the Aramaic name for a place in Jerusalem associated with Judas Iscariot, one of the original twelve apostles of Jesus.

==Variant transliterations==
Most English-language versions of the Bible transliterate the term as &quot;Akeldama&quot; (e.g. American Standard Version (ASV), English Standard Version (ESV), Good News Translation (GNT), Modern English Version (MEV), and New International Version (NIV)) or as &quot;Akel Dama&quot; (New King James Version (NKJV) and 1599 Geneva Bible). &quot;Aceldama&quot; is used by the King James Version (KJV), Darby Bible and Wycliffe Bible. &quot;Hakeldama&quot; is used by the Common English Bible (CEB), New Revised Standard Version (NRSV) and Orthodox Jewish Bible (OJB), whilst the Complete Jewish Bible (CJB) uses &quot;Hakel-D&#x27;ma&quot;. The Jerusalem Bible has &quot;Hakeldama&quot; but uses the English translation &quot;Bloody Acre&quot; in place of &quot;Field of Blood&quot;, which is otherwise consistently used as the English translation. In Greek, it is called Ἁκελδαμάχ (&quot;Hakeldamach&quot;). 
New Zealand Māori prophet Te Whiti o Rongomai used the spelling &quot;akarama&quot; (in keeping with Māori orthography), referring to his prophecy of a betrayal of the Parihaka settlement.

==New Testament connection==

Christian tradition connects the place with Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus for 30 pieces of silver. There are two accounts of his death.

The Gospel of Matthew describes how Judas returned the money to the Temple authorities before hanging himself. Deeming it as blood money, and therefore illegal to put into their treasury, they used it instead to buy a field as a burial ground for foreigners: thus the place gained the name &quot;the Field of Blood&quot; (, and possibly with allusions to and and ).

According to the Acts of the Apostles () Judas &quot;acquired a field with the reward of his unjust deed, and falling headfirst he burst open in the middle and all his intestines gushed out. This became known to all who lived in Jerusalem, so that in their own language they called that field Hakeldama, that is, &#x27;Field of Blood.&quot;

The implication in Matthew is that the location name refers to the blood of Jesus, whereas in Acts the name refers to the blood of Judas. 
Barnabas Lindars holds the Acts narrative to be prior, and that although the incident is not created out of the Old Testament passages the text of Zechariah 11:12ff is &quot;freely used to fill up the gaps in the story ... to the early Christian exegetes a perfectly legitimate procedure&quot;.

According to Ian Howard Marshall, Acts may be recording the (inaccurate) story as told within Jerusalem.

===Identification===
In his &quot;Onomasticon&quot; (ed. Klostermann, p. 102, 16), Eusebius says the &quot;field of Haceldama&quot; lies nearer to &quot;Thafeth of the Valley of Ennom&quot;. But under the word &quot;Haceldama&quot; (p. 38, 20) he says that this field was pointed out as being &quot;north of Mount Sion&quot;. St. Jerome changed this to &quot;south of Mount Sion&quot; (p. 39, 27).

==History==
It continued to be used as a burial place for non-Jews up to the early 19th century.

===Crusader period===
During the era of the Crusades, it was used to bury the fifty or more patients who died each day in the hospital run by the Knights Hospitaller in Jerusalem.

In the 12th century, the crusaders erected beyond the field, on the south side of the valley of Hinnom, a large building now in a ruined condition, measuring seventy-eight feet in length from east to west, fifty-eight feet in width and thirty in height on the north. It is roofed and covers towards the southern end several natural grottoes, which were once used as sepulchres of the Jewish type, and a ditch is hollowed out at the northern end which is sixty-eight feet long, twenty-one feet wide and thirty feet deep. It is estimated that the bones and rubbish accumulated there form a bed from ten to fifteen feet thick.

===Ottoman period===
Akeldama has been the property of the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem since the 16th century.

In 1892 the Greek Orthodox Church built a monastery at the site, named after Saint Onuphrius. Many burial caves have been identified in and around the monastery.

==The Akeldama tombs==
One of Jerusalem&#x27;s main cemeteries during the Second Temple period is a burial complex carved into dense limestone bedrock of a steep slope descending into the meeting point of the Hinnom and Kidron Valleys, 90 meters east of the monastery wall. They were first systematically studied in 1901. In 1989 a construction project was halted when bulldozers revealed the presence of burial caves cut into the rocks; construction was halted, and the Israel Antiquities Authority allowed archaeologists to investigate.

The &quot;Tomb of the Shroud&quot; in Akeldama is &quot;one of very few examples of a preserved shrouded human burial&quot; dating to the first-century, with the bone samples yielding evidence of the pathogens &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; and &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot;, the latter being &quot;the earliest case of leprosy with a confirmed date in which &quot;M. leprae&quot; DNA was detected&quot;.

<text>Achbor ( &quot;ʿAḵbōr&quot;) is a name that means &quot;gnawing&quot; and is, by extension, used as the word for &quot;mouse&quot;. There are at least two persons by this name in the Hebrew Bible.

==Achbor of Edom==

In the King Lists in the books of Genesis and 1 Chronicles Achbor is the father of Baal-hanan, a king of Edom, but is not actually listed as being king himself although some commentaries assume that he was. See Genesis 36:38; 1 Chronicles 1:49.

==Achbor of Judah==

In the Books of Kings Achbor, son of Michaiah, is one of Josiah&#x27;s officers, and one of the five men sent to the prophetess Huldah to inquire regarding the book of the law newly discovered in the Temple in Jerusalem (2 Kings 22:12, 14). This Achbor is also called Abdon (2 Chronicles 34:20).

This may be the same Achbor who is mentioned as the father of Elnathan in the Book of Jeremiah 26:20–23, and who lived in the reign of King Jehoiakim of Judah.

<text>Achish ( &quot;ʾāḵīš&quot;, Philistine: 𐤀𐤊𐤉𐤔 *&quot;ʾākayūš&quot;, Akkadian: 𒄿𒅗𒌑𒋢 &quot;i-ka-ú-su&quot;) is a name used in the Hebrew Bible for two Philistine rulers of Gath. It is perhaps only a general title of royalty, applicable to the Philistine kings. The two kings of Gath, which most scholars identify as Tell es-Safi, are:

* The monarch, described as &quot;Achish the king of Gath&quot;, with whom David sought refuge when he fled from Saul. He is called Abimelech, meaning &quot;father of the king&quot;, in the superscription of Psalm 34. It was probably this same king, or his son with the same name, described as &quot;Achish, the son of Maoch&quot;, to whom David reappeared a second time at the head of a band of 600 warriors. The king assigned David to Ziklag, whence he carried on war against the surrounding tribes while lying to Achish that he was waging war against Israel to garner his support. Achish had great confidence in the valour and fidelity of David, but, at the objection of the other Philistine rulers, did not permit him to go to battle along with the Philistine hosts. David remained with Achish a year and four months. According to the Bible, in , David was greatly afraid of Achish because the servants of Achish recognized him. This led him to feign insanity to avoid harm from the King of Gath.
* Another king of Gath, described as &quot;Achish, son of Maacah,&quot; probably a grandson of the foregoing king, is referred to during Solomon&#x27;s reign. I Kings 2:39–46 mentions two servants of Shimei fleeing to this king in Gath, and Shimei going to Gath to bring them back in breach of Solomon&#x27;s orders. The consequence was that Solomon put Shimei to death.

The Latin transliteration &quot;Achish&quot; represents the begadkefat (aspiration over a medial stop) in Aramaic and in post-Biblical Hebrew. Before the strong influence of Aramaic over Hebrew, which occurred after the Babylonian captivity, would have been pronounced: &quot;Akish.&quot;

In the seventh-century BCE Ekron Royal Dedicatory Inscription, the name Akish appears as &quot;son of Padi, son of , son of Ada, son of Ya&#x27;ir&quot;; Akish by then held enough authority in Ekron to dedicate a temple. A similar name, &quot;Ikausu&quot;, appears as king of Ekron in seventh-century BCE Assyrian inscriptions, as does Padi. Scholars agree that these two are the same men, although a royal status cannot yet be confirmed for their ancestors Ysd, Ada, and Ya&#x27;ir.

This appears to indicate that either the name &quot;Akish&quot; was a common name for Philistine kings, used both at Gath and Ekron, or, as Naveh has suggested, that the editor of the biblical text used a known name of a Philistine king from the end of the Iron Age (Achish of Ekron) as the name of a king(s) of Gath in narratives relating to earlier periods.

== In literature ==

Achish of Gath is a supporting role in the 17th-century opera &quot;David et Jonathas&quot;, sung by a bass.

Achish king of Gath appears in the 1985 film &quot;King David&quot;, starring Richard Gere.

<text>Achor ( &quot;muddy, turbid: gloomy, dejected&quot;) is the name of a valley in the vicinity of Jericho.

== History ==
The Book of Joshua, chapter seven, relates the story from which the valley&#x27;s name comes. After the problems the Israelites had as a result of Achan&#x27;s immoral theft of items commanded to be destroyed, the Israelite community stoned Achan and his household. The narrative about Achan is etiological, presenting a folk etymology.

Due to the nature of this narrative, the phrase &quot;valley of trouble&quot; became eminently proverbial and occurs elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible. The Book of Isaiah and Book of Hosea use the term – &quot;the valley of trouble, a place for herds to lie down in&quot;, &quot;the valley of trouble for a door of hope&quot;, as a way of describing the redemption promised by God.

==Identification==
Eusebius (in &quot;Onomasticon&quot;) and Jerome (in &quot;Book of Sites and Names of Hebrew Places&quot;) implied that they thought it was a valley north of Jericho. In the nineteenth century some writers identified the valley with the wadi al-Qelt, a deep ravine located to Jericho&#x27;s south. In the twentieth century the Hyrcania valley (El-Buqei&#x27;a in Arabic) west and south of Qumran, and Wadi en-Nu&#x27;eima have also been suggested. One difficulty is that the narrative of Joshua appears to place the valley of Achor to the north of Jericho, between Jericho and Ai; but Joshua makes the valley part of the boundary between the tribe of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin, to the south of Jericho, but not as far south as El-Buqei&#x27;a.

<text>Achsah (; Hebrew: עַכְסָה, also Acsah), was Caleb ben Yefune&#x27;s only daughter. Her name comes from the word for &quot;anklet&quot;, עכס (&quot;ekes&quot;).

She was offered in marriage to the man who would lead an attack on the city of Debir, also called Kirjath-sepher/Kirjath-sannah. This was done by Othniel, Caleb&#x27;s brother&#x27;s son, who accordingly obtained her as his wife.

Achsah later requested, and was given, upper and lower springs of water (presumably in the Negev) from her father.

Various Septuagint manuscripts, in various passages, give her name as &quot;Ascha,&quot; &quot;Achsa,&quot; &quot;Aza,&quot; and &quot;Oxa.&quot;

<text>Achshaph (; ) was a royal city of the Canaanites, in the north of Canaan (Josh. 11:1; 12:20; 19:25). The name means &quot;sorcery&quot;. 
==Location==
Achshaph was in the eastern boundary of the tribe of Asher. There are several opinions as to its exact location, including Tell Keisan, Tell Regev, Tell Harbaj and Tell an-Nakhl. In the Greek Septuagint, in various manuscripts, depending on the passage, its name is given in the forms &quot;Azeiph,&quot; &quot;Achsaph,&quot; &quot;Achas,&quot; &quot;Keaph,&quot; &quot;Achiph,&quot; &quot;Acheib,&quot; and &quot;Chasaph.&quot;

==History==

The 1350 BC Amarna letters has Endaruta as the &#x27;mayor&#x27; of Akšapa (Achshaph). In this time period, the Habiru are attacking city-states, and Abdi-Heba of Jerusalem, Surata of Acco, Šuwardata of Qiltu (?), and Endaruta are aiding each other.

Only one extremely short letter–EA 223 (EA-el Amarna) is written from Endaruta of Akšapa, and it is a one sentence topic: [following a short 3-sentence formal-formulaic introduction] ... &quot; &quot;Whatever the king (i.e. pharaoh), my lord, orders, I shall prepare.&quot; &quot;

But one perfectly preserved letter from Pharaoh, to Endaruta of Akšapa is known, EA 367. Its topic is &quot;to guard&quot; (and defend) Akšapa and to prepare for &quot;troop arrivals&quot;-(the archer-forces).

The third and only other reference in the Amarna letters corpus is from letter EA 366 (from Šuwardata of Qiltu (?)), and the letter states:
:&quot; &quot;...only &#x27;Abdi-Heba and I have been at war with that &#x27;Apiru. Surata, the ruler of Akka, and Endaruta, the ruler of Akšapa, these two also came to my aid, ...&quot; &quot;

<text>Achziv ( &quot;ʾAḵzīḇ&quot;) or Az-Zeeb () is an ancient site on the Mediterranean coast of northern Israel, between the border with Lebanon and the city of Acre. It is located north of Acre on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea, within the municipal area of Nahariya. Today it is an Israeli national park.

Excavations have unearthed a fortified Canaanite city of the second millennium BCE. The Phoenician town of the first millennium BCE is known both from the Hebrew Bible and Assyrian sources. Phoenician Achzib went through ups and downs during the Persian and Hellenistic periods. In early Roman times the town, known as &quot;Acdippa&quot;, was a road station. The Bordeaux Pilgrim mentions it in 333-334 CE still as a road station; Jewish sources of the Byzantine period call it &quot;Kheziv&quot; and &quot;Gesiv&quot;. There is no information about settlement at the site for the early Muslim period. The Crusaders built a new village with a castle there. During the Mamluk and Ottoman periods a modest village occupied the old tell (archaeological mound).

In modern times the site was known as the Palestinian town of Az-Zeeb, with a population of almost 2,000. It was depopulated during the Haganah&#x27;s Operation Ben-Ami, on May 14, 1948, the last day of the British Mandate for Palestine.

The sole permanent resident of Achziv since declaration of the State was Eli Avivi (1930-2018), an Israeli photographer and micronationalist who hosted visitors to the legally disputed micronation of &quot;Akhzivland&quot;, a small stretch of beach where he lived since 1975 until his death.

==Etymology==
Mentioned in the Bible by its ancient name &quot;Achzib&quot;, evidence of human settlement at the site dates back to the 18th century BCE. During the Roman period (and in classical literature) the imperial authorities called it &quot;Ecdippa&quot;, &quot;Ecdeppa&quot;, or &quot;Ecdippon&quot;. By the early Middle Ages, the Arab name for the village &quot;Az-Zeeb&quot;, or &quot;al-Zib&quot; ( meaning &#x27;trickster&#x27;) was locally in common usage. Az-Zeeb is a shortened form of the site&#x27;s original ancient Canaanite/Phoenician name, &quot;Achzib&quot;.

==History==

Human settlement at the site dates to as early as the 18th century BCE; and by the 10th century BCE it was a walled town. A tell excavated between 1941–44 and 1959-1964 found evidence of settlement from the Middle Bronze Age II, through the Roman Empire and the Early Middle Ages. Achziv was the first fortified settlement found at the site by archaeologists.

===Middle Bronze Age===
====Middle Bronze Age IIA====
In the Middle Bronze IIA (MBIIA), remains are found at Phase N5 with features including child burials in storage jars below floors.

====Middle Bronze Age IIA-B====
At the transition from MBIIA to MBIIB, the settlement was subject to a violent destruction.

====Middle Bronze Age IIB====
In the Middle Bronze IIB (MBIIB), Phase N4 was part of a large Canaanite port city. The massive ramparts, some 4.5 m (15 ft) high, protected the city proper and a large area of port facilities. To the north and south the city extended to the two nearby rivers, which the Canaanite engineers connected by a fosse, thus transforming Achzib into an island. A substantial destruction level from the beginning of the Late Bronze Age proves that even these fortifications were eventually not sufficient. A fierce conflagration ended Phase N4 and led to the transition to the MBIIC/LBI in Phase N3.

===Iron Age===
====Iron II====
By the 1000 BCE, Achziv was a prosperous and fortified Phoenician town. Conquered by the Assyrian empire in the 8th century BCE, however, it was subsequently ruled by the Persians during the rule of the Roman Empire.
Positioned on a passage between the plain of Acre and the city of Tyre, Achzib was an important road station. Between the 10th and 6th centuries BCE, it was a prosperous town, with public buildings and tombs with Phoenician inscriptions, attesting to the identity of its inhabitants at the time. Conquered by the Assyrians in 701 BCE and listed in &quot;Sennacherib&#x27;s Annals&quot; as &quot;Ak-zi-bi&quot;, the continuation of Phoenician settlement through this period and during the decline endured during the Persian period, is evidenced in 5th and 4th century BCE Phoenician inscriptions that were found at the site.

Prior to the Assyrian invasion of Achziv under Sennacherib, in the late 8th-century BCE, Achziv and Akko belonged to the king of Sidon, and were considered Hittite territory.

====Biblical tradition====
Achzib is mentioned in the Book of Joshua (19:29) and Book of Judges (1:31) as a town assigned to the tribe of Asher in the Hebrew Bible, but the Asherites did not manage to conquer it from the Phoenicians:
::And the fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of Asher ... and the outgoings thereof are at the sea from the coast to Achzib. ()
::Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Acco, ... or of Achzib ... ()
According to Biblical history, King David added the city into his Kingdom, but King Solomon returned it to Hiram I as part of the famous pact; archaeological evidence indicates that it remained Phoenician.

===Classic era===
====Hellenistic period====
During the reign of the Seleucids the border was established at Rosh HaNikra, just north to Achziv, making it a border city which they called &quot;Ekdippa&quot; (Έκδιππα in Ancient Greek) and put it under the control of Acre. Mentioned in the writings of Pseudo-Scylax, the site likely regained some importance in Hellenistic times.

====Roman and Byzantine periods====
A maritime city named Cziv, nine miles (14 km) north of Acre, is mentioned by Josephus Flavius and later by Eusebius. Achziv (Cheziv) is mentioned in Jewish rabbinic writings, for example Midrash Vayikra Rabba 37:4. Additionally, Achziv is mentioned in the Babylonian Talmud, and by the relating Middle Age commentators, concerning the location of Achziv in regards to historical borders of Israel. At the end of the Roman era, a pottery workshop was located there.

===Middle Ages===
By the Early Middle Ages, Arab geographers were referring to the area as &quot;az-Zeeb&quot;.

====Crusader period====
With the arrival of the Crusaders and after the fall of Acre in 1104, &quot;Casal Imbertia&quot; or &quot;Lambertie&quot; was established there. During the Crusader era, it expanded and became the main centre of a large estate with the same name, Casal Imbert. Lefiegre, Le Quiebre and La Gabassie were all part of this estate. The site was commonly known as &quot;&quot;Casale Umberti&quot;,&quot; or Casal Humberti (after Hubert of Pacy who held the casale), and it is documented in 1108.

Az-Zeeb (meaning &quot;trickster&quot;), is first mentioned in Crusader sources in 1123 as a village belonging to Hubert of Pacy. In 1146, the Crusaders established a settlement there protected by a castle and named &quot;Casale Huberti&quot; and sometimes still as &quot;Casal Humberti&quot;. Under Baldwin III, European farmers settled there sometime before 1153.

Arab geographer Ibn Jubayr toured Palestine in 1182 and mentioned az-Zeeb as a large fortress with a village and adjoining lands between Acre and Tyre. In 1198, King Aimery gave a large part of the income from Az-Zeeb to the Teutonic Order. In 1226, Arab geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi described az-Zeeb as a large village on the coast whose name was also pronounced &quot;az-Zaib&quot;.

In 1232 it was the site of the Battle of Casal Imbert between German and French Crusaders as part of the War of the Lombards. In 1253 King Henry gave the whole estate of Casal Imbert to John of Ibelin. Shortly after, in 1256, John of Ibelin leased Az-Zeeb and all its dependant villages to the Teutonic Order for 10 years. In 1261, the whole estate was sold to the Teutonic Order, in return for an annual sum for as long as Acre was in Christian hands. In 1283 the village was mentioned as part of the domain of the Crusaders, according to the &quot;hudna&quot; (truce) between the Crusaders in Acre and the Mamluk sultan Qalawun.

====Mamluk period====
The Arab village of Az-Zeeb was established during the later Mamluk period with the houses erected using the stones of the destroyed Crusader castle; and thrived throughout the Ottoman rule. There are descriptions of the castle and village by Arab chroniclers in the 12th and 13th centuries, just prior to and during the rule of the Mamluks in the region.

===Ottoman era===
In the early 16th century, az-Zeeb was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire and its inhabitants cultivated various crops and raised livestock on which they paid taxes to the Ottoman authorities. According to the 1596 tax records, it was a village in the &quot;nahiya&quot; (subdistrict) of Akka, part of Sanjak Safad with a population of 132 households and 27 bachelors and an estimated total of 875 persons. All were Muslim. The villagers paid a fixed tax rate of 25% on several agricultural items including, wheat, barley, &quot;summer crops&quot;, fruits, cotton, beehives, goats, and water buffalo; a total of 23,669 akçe. All of the revenue went to a waqf.

A map by Pierre Jacotin from Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of 1799 showed the village, named as &quot;Zib&quot;. British traveler James Silk Buckingham describes az-Zeeb in 1816 as a small town built on a hill near the sea with few palm trees rising above its houses. During the period of Egyptian rule in Palestine, the sheikh (chief) of az-Zeeb, Said al-Sabi, joined the 1834 peasants&#x27; rebellion against governor Ibrahim Pasha. He was arrested and exiled to Egypt by the authorities in the summer of that year because of his participation.
In 1875, when Victor Guérin visited, Az-Zeeb had 500 Muslim inhabitants. Guérin noted that the hill on which it was built had formerly been surrounded by a wall, traces of which were still to be seen on the east side. By the late 19th century, most of the village houses were built of stone, a mosque and a clinic had been established, and the residents cultivated olives, figs, mulberries, and pomegranates. The population consisted of about 400 Muslims. In 1882, the Ottomans established an elementary school in az-Zeeb. A population list from about 1887 showed that Kh. ez Zib had about 730 inhabitants, all Muslim.

===British Mandate period===
Az-Zeeb became a part of the British Mandate of Palestine in 1922. In the 1922 census of Palestine, &quot;Al Zib&quot; had a population of 804; 803 Muslims and 1 Christian, where the one Christian was a Roman Catholic. The population had increased in the 1931 census to 1059, all Muslims, in a total of 251 houses.

The main economic sectors in the village were in fishing and agriculture, particularly fruit cultivation, which included bananas, citrus, olives, and figs. The town held four olive presses: two mechanized and two animal-drawn. Between 1927 and 1945, the village&#x27;s annual fish catch was 16 metric tons. In the 1945 statistics, the population of Az Zeeb was 1,910, all Muslims, with a total land area of 12,607 dunams. Of this, 2,973 dunams were used for citrus and bananas; 1,989 dunums were irrigated or used for orchards; 4,425 were for cereals; while 62 dunams were built-up (urban) areas.

The population of the village in 1945 was 1,910.

====Political unrest====
In 1946, The Jewish Resistance Movement attempted to blow up the railroad bridge over the creek at Achziv in an operation known as Night of the Bridges. A monument to the 14 soldiers killed there was erected on the site.

===1948 War===
Just before the official end to Mandate rule on May 14, 1948 and the start of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, az-Zeeb was captured by the Haganah&#x27;s Carmeli Brigade, being one of the main places targeted in Operation Ben-Ami. According to Haganah accounts, the residents immediately &quot;fled upon the appearance of Jewish forces, and the Haganah command decided to hold on to [it].&quot; However, Israeli historian Benny Morris states that the Haganah had a &quot;long account&quot; with az-Zeeb because it was a center of Arab attacks on Jews and that most of the inhabitants fled after the village was hit with a mortar barrage by the Haganah. Morris writes that two Haganah companies reported in mid-May 1948 that they were &quot;attacking al Zib with the aim of blowing up the village&quot;. Eyewitness accounts from among the villagers indicate that they mistook the incoming Israeli forces for Arab reinforcements because they had donned red and white &quot;keffiyehs&quot;, and that these forces quickly overwhelmed the local militia of 35-40 men. Many of the inhabitants fled to Lebanon or nearby villages, but many also remained in az-Zeeb until they were relocated by the Israeli authorities to the Arab coastal town of Mazra&#x27;a. Some villagers later claimed that the Haganah had &quot;molested or violated&quot; a number of women.

The Israeli localities of Sa&#x27;ar and Gesher HaZiv were established on the village lands in 1948 and 1949. A domed mosque from the village has since been restored and serves as a tourist site, and the house of the last mukhtar (village headman) is now a museum.

==Israel==
Achziv is an Israeli national park. Today Achziv shores are part of the Achziv-Rosh haNikra marine protected area, which is located between the city of Naharia to the south and the Israeli-Lebanon border to the north. The marine protected area has 7 kilometers of shore line and continue into the sea for another 15 kilometers west. This marine nature reserve protects the fauna and flora of the stony reefs and the sandy beach environments. It is the only marine protected area in Israel in which the maximum depth is deeper than 850 meters. Near the national park is Akhzivland, founded by Eli Avivi in 1971 and currently used as a vacation village and camping site.

==Archaeology==
Remnants of ancient Achziv, now known as Tel Achziv, are located on a sandstone mound between two streams, Kziv on the north and Shaal on the south, close to the border with Lebanon. An ancient port was located on the coast, and another secondary port is located 700 m to the south. Archeological excavations have revealed that a walled city existed at the location from the Middle Bronze period.

<text>Adar (Hebrew: , ; from Akkadian &quot;adaru&quot;) is the sixth month of the civil year and the twelfth month of the religious year on the Hebrew calendar, roughly corresponding to the month of March in the Gregorian calendar. It is a month of 29 days.

==Names and leap years==
The month&#x27;s name, like all the others from the Hebrew calendar, was adopted during the Babylonian captivity. In the Babylonian calendar the name was Araḫ Addaru or Adār (&#x27;Month of Adar&#x27;).

In leap years, it is preceded by a 30-day intercalary month named Adar Aleph (, &quot;aleph&quot; being the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet), also known as &quot;Adar Rishon&quot; (&quot;First Adar&quot;) or &quot;Adar I&quot;, and it is then itself called Adar Bet (, &quot;bet&quot; being the second letter of the Hebrew alphabet), also known as &quot;Adar Sheni&quot; (&quot;Second Adar&quot;) or &quot;Adar II&quot;. Occasionally instead of Adar I and Adar II, &quot;Adar&quot; and &quot;Ve&#x27;Adar&quot; are used (Ve means &#x27;and&#x27; thus: And-Adar). Adar I and II occur during February–March on the Gregorian calendar.

Sources disagree as to which of the two Adar months is the &quot;real&quot; Adar, and which is the added leap month.

==Customs==
During the Second Temple period, there was a Jewish custom to make a public proclamation on the first day of the lunar month Adar, reminding the people that they are to prepare their annual monetary offering to the Temple treasury, known as the half-Shekel.

Based on a line in the Mishnah declaring that Purim must be celebrated in Adar II in a leap year (Megillah 1:4), Adar I is considered the &quot;extra&quot; month. As a result, someone born in Adar during a non leap year would celebrate their birthday in Adar II during a leap year. However, someone born during either Adar in a leap year will celebrate their birthday during Adar in a non-leap year, except that someone born on 30 Adar I will celebrate their birthday on 1 Nisan in a non-leap year because Adar in a non-leap year has only 29 days.

==Holidays==
* 7 Adar (II in leap years) – 7th of Adar – some fast on this day in memory of the death of Moses
* 13 Adar (II in leap years) – Fast of Esther – on 11 Adar when the 13th falls on Shabbat – &quot;(Fast Day)&quot;
* 14 Adar (II in leap years) – Purim
* 14 Adar I (does not exist in non-leap years; Karaites celebrate in Adar II) – Purim Katan
* 15 Adar (II in leap years) – Shushan Purim – celebration of Purim in walled cities existing during the time of Joshua
* 17 Adar (II in leap years) – Yom Adar celebration feast

The town is mentioned figuratively in the Bible, in Deuteronomy and Book of Hosea.
There has also been some conjecture that Admah is mentioned in the Ebla tablets as the Eblaite word &quot;ad-ma&quot; or &quot;ad-mu-utki&quot; = (Town of) Admah.

<text>Adoni-Bezek, ( &quot;’Aḏōnī-Ḇezeq&quot;, &quot;lord of Bezek&quot;), also written Adonibezek or Adoni Bezek, was a Canaanite king referred to in the Book of Judges ( ). Previous to the occupation of Canaan by the Israelites, he had subdued seventy of the kings of cities around him. The tribes of Judah and Simeon attacked the Canaanites and the Perizzites at Bezek and defeated him.

The historical reality of events described in the book of Judges is the subject of ongoing dispute among scholars, who vary in their opinions about how much of the book is historical.

==Bezek==
Some scholars propose that Bezek was near Gezer. Others suggest that the place is to be identified with Khirbet Ibzik or the nearby Khirbet Salhab, while others think that &quot;Bezek&quot; is a corruption of &quot;Zedek,&quot; in reference to the story of Adonizedek. Bezek appears again in as the site where Saul assembled the Israelite armies to fight against Nahash the Ammonite.

==Mutilation==
Adoni-Bezek, according to Judges, had removed the large toes and thumbs of kings he subjugated to render them harmless as warriors, presumably so they could no longer wield weapons or run. After Joshua had died, the tribes of Judah and Simeon continued the Israelite conquest of Canaan by leading an army against this Canaanite king. Employing the biblical law of &quot;eye for an eye&quot; they did the same to Adoni-Bezek before sending him to Jerusalem as a slave. Adoni-Bezek is recorded as saying &quot;Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off used to pick up scraps under my table. As I have done, so God has repaid me.&quot; According to Elicott&#x27;s Commentary for English readers, &quot;The cutting off of his thumbs would prevent him from ever again drawing a bow or wielding a sword. Romans who desired to escape conscription cut off their thumbs&quot;.

==Later life==
According to the Book of Judges, he confessed that God had requited him for his cruelty to the seventy kings whom he had subdued. Otherwise, nothing is known of his life after his mutilation.

==Comparison with Adonizedek==
According to Coggins, he is probably the same person as Adonizedek mentioned in Joshua 10 who flourished c. 1200 BC. While some scholars think that the story of Adoni-bezek is a variation on the story of Adonizedek, James Martin argues that the stories are &quot;so dissimilar&quot; that the Adoni-Bezek narrative is most likely not &quot;simply a variant&quot; of the Adonizedek narrative. According to Joshua 10, Adonizedek was captured after taking refuge with four other rulers in a cave and put to death in the course of Joshua&#x27;s campaign in Canaan. Adonibezek, on the other hand, was captured, in a campaign following Joshua&#x27;s death, in his city (Judges 1).

His name is missing from the list of thirty-one city kings in Joshua 12:9-24, although he had subjugated seventy other kings in the Judge&#x27;s account. It has been argued that the latter figure may not be literally true: &quot;The Temple Dictionary of the Bible&quot; (1910) stated: &#x27;&quot;This [70] is a round number, meaning &#x27;many&#x27;&quot;.

<text>According to 2 Samuel, Adonijah (, &quot;’Ǎḏōnīyyā&quot;; &quot;my lord is Yah&quot;) was the fourth son of King David. His mother was Haggith as recorded in the book of . Adonijah was born at Hebron during the long conflict between David and the House of Saul. In 1 Kings, he briefly proclaimed himself king of Israel during the terminal illness of his father David, before peacefully ceding the throne to his brother Solomon.

==Life==
After the death of his elder brothers Amnon and Absalom, Adonijah considered himself the heir-apparent to the throne. He acquired chariots and a large entourage. The king was unaware of this, being as he was &quot;stricken in years&quot; with his health failing him, and was in a different city. (KJV) Adonijah consulted and obtained the support of both the commander of the army Joab and the influential priest Abiathar. However, the priest Zadok, Benaiah (head of the king&#x27;s bodyguard), Nathan (the court prophet), and others did not side with Adonijah.

In anticipation of his father&#x27;s imminent death, Adonijah invited his brother princes and the court officials to a solemn sacrifice in order to announce his claim to the throne. Notably, he did not invite Solomon nor any of his supporters. According to the &quot;Jewish Study Bible&quot;, by excluding Solomon, Adonijah demonstrates his awareness that he is in effect usurping the throne.

Assuming that Adonijah will soon move to eliminate any rivals or opposition, Nathan warns Bathsheba, Solomon&#x27;s mother, and counsels her to remind the king of a previous promise to make Solomon his successor. Lillian R. Klein finds in Nathan&#x27;s promise to confirm Bathsheba&#x27;s statement a suggestion that her words may have required verification, and that there was no earlier definite promise in Solomon&#x27;s favor. However KJV confirms in 1 Chronicles 29 and 2 Samuel 15 that David had indeed promised that Solomon would be anointed King.

However, Adonijah was supplanted by Solomon through the influence of Bathsheba, and through the diplomacy of the prophet Nathan. They induced David to give orders that Solomon should immediately be proclaimed and admitted to the throne, which David agreed.

After receiving word that Solomon had been crowned king, Adonijah&#x27;s supporters quickly fled, while Adonijah took refuge at the altar. He later received a pardon for his conduct from Solomon on the condition that he showed himself a worthy man (). Afterwards, Adonijah asked to marry Abishag from Shunem, who served his father David on his deathbed. Solomon, however, interpreting the request as a second attempt to gain the throne, denied authorization for such an engagement even though Bathsheba now pleaded on Adonijah&#x27;s behalf, and Adonijah was subsequently put to death ().

<text>Adria is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Rovigo in the Veneto region of northern Italy, situated between the mouths of the rivers Adige and Po. The remains of the Etruscan city of Atria or Hatria are to be found below the modern city, three to four metres below the current level. Adria and Spina were the Etruscan ports and depots for Felsina (now Bologna). Adria may have given its name during an early period to the Adriatic Sea, to which it was connected by channels.

==History==

===Ancient era===
The first settlements built in the area are of Venetic origin, during the twelfth to ninth centuries BC, consisting of stilt houses in the wetlands, that were then still close to the sea. At that time the main stream of the Po, the Adria channel, flowed into the sea in this area. The Villanovan culture, named for an archaeological site at the village of Villanova, near Bologna (Etruscan &quot;Felsina&quot;), flourished in this area from the tenth until as late as the sixth century BC. The foundations of classical Atria are dated from 530 to 520 BC.

The Etruscans built the port and settlement of Adria after the channel gradually started to run dry. During the later period of the sixth century BC the port continued to flourish. The Etruscan-controlled area of the Po Valley was generally known as Padanian Etruria, as opposed to their main concentration along the Tyrrhenian coast south of the Arno.

Greeks from Aegina and later from Syracuse by Dionysius I colonised the city making it into an emporion. Greeks had been trading with the Veneti from the sixth century BC at least, especially the amber, originally coming from the Baltic sea.

Mass Celtic incursions into the Po valley resulted in friction between the Gauls and Etruscans and intermarriage, attested by epigraphic inscriptions on which Etruscan and Celtic names appear together. The city was populated by Etruscans, Veneti, Greeks and Celts.

Pliny the Elder, a Roman author and fleet commander, wrote about a system of channels in Atria that was, &quot;first made by the Tuscans [i.e. Etruscans], thus discharging the flow of the river across the marshes of the Atriani called the Seven Seas, with the famous harbor of the Tuscan town of Atria which formerly gave the name of Atriatic to the sea now called the Adriatic&quot;. Those &quot;Seven Seas&quot; were interlinked coastal lagoons, separated from the open sea by sand spits and barrier islands. The Etruscans extended this natural inland waterway with new canals to extend the navigation possibilities of the tidal reaches of the Po all the way north to Atria. As late as the time of the emperor Vespasian, shallow draft galleys could still be rowed from Ravenna into the heart of Etruria. Under Roman occupation the town ceded importance to Ravenna as the continued siltation of the Po delta carried the seafront further to the east. The sea is now about from Adria.

The first exploration of ancient Atria was carried out by Carlo Bocchi and published as &quot;Importanza di Adria la Veneta&quot;. The collections of the Bocchi family were given to the public at the beginning of the 20th century and comprise a major part of the city museum collection of antiquities.

There are several ideas concerning the etymology of the ancient toponym &quot;Adria/Atria&quot;. One theory is that it derives from the Illyrian (Venetic language) word &quot;adur&quot; &quot;water, sea&quot;.

===Medieval and modern age===
At the time of the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the port of Adria had lost most of its importance. It finally declined after the total change of the local hydrography in 589, following the catastrophic flood documented by Paul the Deacon, and Adria became a fief of the archdiocese of Ravenna.

After a period as an independent commune, it was a possession of the Este of Ferrara and, in the 16th century, of the Republic of Venice. At that time Adria was a small village surrounded by malaria-plagued marshes. It recovered its importance when Polesine was reclaimed in the same century.

During the Napoleonic Wars it was first under France, then under Austria, to which it was assigned in 1815 after the Congress of Vienna, as part of Lombardy-Venetia.

<text>Adriel (Hebrew: עדריאל) (Aramaic: ܥܕܪܝܐܝܠ) (literally עדר (flock) י (of) אל (El)) was a person mentioned in the Bible. Adriel was a nobleman in the ancient kingdom of Israel.

The name Adriel is translated from the Hebrew word עַדְרִיאֵל (ad-ree-ale&#x27;), which means &quot;flock of God&quot;. עַדְרִיאֵל comes from two Hebrew words: עֵ֫דֶר (ay&#x27;-der) and אֵל (ale). עֵ֫דֶר (ay&#x27;-der) means &quot;flock&quot; and comes from another Hebrew word - עָדַר (aw-dar&#x27;) - that means &quot;to dig&quot; or &quot;to arrange&quot;. אֵל (ale) means &quot;God&quot;. Adriel was the son of Barzillai the Meholathite. According to 1 Samuel 18:19, Saul married his daughter Merab to Adriel.

However, 2 Samuel 21:8, in the Masoretic Text, records that Michal, another daughter of Saul &quot;brought up&quot; [R.V. &quot;bare&quot;] five sons with Adriel. This is in apparent conflict with 2 Samuel 6:23, which records that Michal was barren, and 2 Samuel 3, which indicates that Michal was married to David, not Adriel. This could also simply be a case of multiple people having the same name.

The claim that Michal &quot;brought up&quot; these five sons has been taken to mean either that she treated them as if she had been their own mother, or that for &quot;Michal&quot; we should read &quot;Merab&quot; in 2 Samuel 21:8, as in 1 Sam. 18:19.

Due to that later discrepancy that states Michal as the wife of Adriel, instead of Merab as first said in 1st Samuel, many scholars believe this to be an ancient copyist&#x27;s error that should have read Merab in 2 Samuel 21:8.

<text>Adullam (, ) is an ancient ruin once numbered among the thirty-six cities of Canaan whose kings &quot;Joshua and the children of Israel smote&quot; . After that, it fell as an inheritance to the tribe of Judah and was included in the northern division of the Shephelah &quot;lowland&quot; cities of the land of Judah .

The connection between Judah and Adullam and its surroundings was actually already established in the patriarchal period, when Judah &quot;went down from his brothers and turned aside to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah&quot; . At the beginning of the royal period, in the days of King Saul, the area was close to the land of the Philistines, and thus David, fleeing from Saul, sought refuge in the cave of Adullam and made it a place of reconnoitering and organization, both, for him and his men . Here, too, the episode took place when three of David&#x27;s heroes brought him water from the well of Bethlehem and he did not dare to drink it, but &quot;poured it out unto the Lord&quot; . It is also learnt from the battle of David and Goliath, which took place in the Valley of Elah directly adjoining the north-side of the ruin, as well as from the raid of the Philistines into Keilah to the immediate south of Adullam, that Adullam was a frontier city during that period.

The current site was formerly known by the Arabic appellation Khurbet esh-Sheikh Madhkur, 9 mi. (15 km.) northeast of Bayt Jibrin, and was built upon a hilltop overlooking the Elah valley, straddling the Green Line between Israel and the West Bank, and with its suburban ruin, , lying directly below it. By the late 19th century, the settlement, which had been a town, was in ruins. The hilltop ruin is named after Madkour, one of the sons of the Sultan Beder, for whom is built a shrine (&quot;wely&quot;) and formerly called by its inhabitants &quot;Wely Madkour&quot;. The hilltop is mostly flat, with cisterns carved into the rock. The remains of stone structures which once stood there can still be seen. Sedimentary layers of ruins from the old Canaanite and Israelite eras, mostly potsherds, are noticeable everywhere, although olive groves now grow atop of this hill, enclosed within stonewall enclosures. The villages of Aderet, Aviezer and Khirbet al-Deir are located nearby. The ruin lies about south of moshav Neve Michael.

==Main archaeological sites; identification==
Kh. esh-Sheikh Madkur (Palestine grid: 1503/1175) sits at an elevation of above sea-level and is thought by modern historical geographers to be the &quot;upper Adullam&quot;, based on its proximity to Kh. &#x27;Id el-Minya. The name of this latter site is believed by historical geographers to be a corruption of the word &quot;Adullam.&quot; The identification of the upper site with the biblical Adullam is still inconclusive, as archaeological evidence attesting to its Old Canaanite name has yet to be found. In the late 19th century, the hilltop ruin and its adjacent ruins were explored by French explorer, Victor Guérin, who wrote:

[Upon leaving the hilltop ruin, &quot;Khirbet el-Sheikh Madkour&quot;], at 11:20 [AM], we descend to the east in the valley. At 11:25 [AM], I examine other ruins, called &quot;Khirbet A&#x27;id el-Miah&quot;. Sixty toppled houses in the &quot;wadi&quot; formed a village that still existed in the Muslim period, as [proven by] the remains of a mosque there observed. In antiquity, the ruins that cover the plateau of the hill of &quot;Sheikh Madkour&quot; and which extend in the valley were probably one and the same city, divided into two parts, the upper part and the lower part.

While Guérin does not specifically say that the site in question was the ancient Adullam, he holds that and are to be recognised as the same city; the upper and the lower. The site is maintained by the Jewish National Fund in Israel, and archaeological surveys and partial excavations have been conducted. The site features ancient caverns, cisterns carved into the rock, and a Muslim shrine known as .

, also known as (Palestine grid: 1504/1181), is the site recognised as Adullam proper, being now a tell at the southern end of , an extension of the Elah valley. The site was first recognised as the biblical Adullam by French archaeologist Clermont-Ganneau in 1871, based on its location, a close approximation of the name and the ceramic finds it yielded. The ruin sits at an elevation of above sea-level. The ruin is overgrown with vegetation and trees on the northern flanks of the mountain whereon lies . Razed stone structures, a stone water trough, and the shaft of a stone column can still be seen there. Palestine Exploration Fund surveyor, C.R. Conder, mentions having seen in an ancient well having stone water-troughs round it.

Earlier attempts at identification have led some to call other cave systems by the name of &quot;Cave of Adullam.&quot; Early drawings depicting the so-called &quot;Adullam cave&quot; have tentatively been identified with the cavern of &quot;Umm el-Tuweimin&quot;, and the cave at &quot;Khureitun&quot; (named after Chariton the Ascetic), although modern day archaeologists and historical geographers have rejected these early hypotheses as being the Cave of Adullam, and have accepted that is the Adullam of old.

It has been pointed out that , if indeed it is the biblical Adullam, lies only southwest of Timnah, a site mentioned in Genesis, ch. 38, as being visited by Judah when he went up from Adullam to shear his sheep.

==History==
===Late Bronze Age, Iron Age and Hebrew Bible===

The &quot;Adullam&quot; mentioned in the Hebrew Bible is thought to be identical with &quot;Tell Sheikh Madkhur&quot;. The so-called &quot;Biblical period&quot;, for time reference-sake, has been referred to by historians and archaeologists as the Late Bronze Age and the Iron Age, meaning, the Late Canaanite and Israelite periods, respectively. A.F. Rainey recognized Adullam (&quot;Kh. esh-Sheikh Madhkûr&quot;) as a Late Bronze Age site.

By the Iron Age, Adullam is referred to in the Hebrew Bible as being one of the royal cities of the Canaanites, and is listed along with the cities Jarmuth and Socho as occupying a place in the region geographically known as the &quot;Shefelah&quot;, or what is a place of transition between the mountainous region and the coastal plains.

It was here that Judah, the son of Jacob (Israel), came when he left his father and brothers in Migdal Eder. Judah befriended a certain Hirah, an Adullamite. In Adullam, Judah met his first wife (unnamed in the Book of Genesis), the daughter of Shuah. 

During the period of the Israelite conquest of the land of Canaan, Adullam was one of many city-states with independent and sovereign kings. According to the same biblical source, the king of Adullam was slain by Joshua and the Israelites during their conquest of the land. The immediate lands were, by what was thought to be a &quot;divine act&quot; of casting lots, given as a tribal inheritance to the progeny of Judah. 

More than 400 years later, the scene of David&#x27;s victory over Goliath in the Elah valley was within a short distance from Adullam, at that time a frontier village. Although David was elevated and allowed to sit in King Saul&#x27;s presence, he soon fell into disrepute with the king and was forced to flee. 

David sought refuge in Adullam after being expelled from the city of Gath by King Achish. The Book of Samuel refers to the Cave of Adullam where he found protection while living as a refugee from King Saul. Certain caves, grottos and sepulchres are still to be seen on the hilltop, as well as on its northern and eastern slopes. It was there that &quot;every one that was in distress gathered together, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented.&quot; There, David thirsted for the well-waters of his native Beth-lehem, then occupied by a Philistine garrison. A party of David&#x27;s mighty-men of valor went and fetched him water from that place, but, when they returned, David refused to drink it.

In the 10th-century BCE, Adullam was thought to have strategic importance, prompting King David&#x27;s grandson, Rehoboam (c. 931–913 BCE), to fortify the town, among others, against Ancient Egypt. According to Israeli historian N.Naʾaman, this was not a fortress in the real sense, but only a town inhabited by a civilian population, although it functioned as an administrative military center in which a garrison was stationed and food and armor stored.

===Assyrian and Chaldean conquests===
In the late 8th-century BCE, the Book of Micah recalled the cities of the lowlands of Judah during a time of Assyrian encroachment in the country: &quot;I will yet bring unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah, him that shall possess thee; he shall come even unto Adullam, O glory of Israel.&quot;

Sennacherib, during his third military campaign, despoiled many of the cities belonging to Judah. The Assyrian period was followed by the rise of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, a time marked by general unrest and the eventual deportation of the inhabitants of Judah by the Neo-Babylonian army in the sixth century BCE. Adullam, as with other towns of the region, would not have gone unaffected.

===Persian period===
The only record of Adullam for this time-period (c. 539–331 BCE) is taken from the Hebrew canonical books, specifically the account of Nehemiah who returned with the Jewish exiles from the Babylonian captivity, during the reign of Artaxerxes I. According to Ezra, the acclaimed author of the book, some of these returnees had settled in Adullam. According to Nehemiah, the postexilic community that resettled in Adullam traced their lineage to the tribe of Judah.

The political entity that was established in Judea at the time was that of a vassal state, as Judea became a province of the Persian Empire, governed by a satrap.

===Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine periods===
Few records abound for the site during the classical period. In 163 BCE, it was in Adullam that Judas Maccabaeus, the principal leader of the Maccabean Revolt during a time of foreign dominion in the country, retired with his fighting men, after returning from war against the Idumaeans and the Seleucid general, Gorgias. Adullam stood near the highway which later became the Roman road in the Valley of Elah, which road led from Jerusalem to Beit Gubrin.

As late as the early 4th century CE, Adullam was described by Eusebius as being &quot;a very large village about ten [Roman] miles east of Eleutheropolis.&quot;
===Ottoman period===
Adullam was an inhabited village in the late 16th century. An Ottoman tax ledger of 1596 lists () in the &quot;nahiya&quot; &quot;Ḫalīl&quot; (Hebron subdistrict), and where it is noted that it had thirty-six Muslim heads of households. The copyist of the same tax ledger had erroneously mistaken the Arabic &quot;dal&quot; in the document for a &quot;nun&quot;, and which name has since been corrected by historical geographers Yoel Elitzur and Toledano to read (), based on the entry&#x27;s number of fiscal unit in the &quot;daftar&quot; and its corresponding place on Hütteroth&#x27;s map. Local inhabitants grew wheat and barley, as well as cultivated olives. Total revenues accruing from the village for that year amounted to 5160 &quot;akçe&quot;.

According to Conder, an ancient road, leading from Beit Sur to Isdud once passed through &quot;ʿAīd el Mâ&quot; (Adullam) and was still partially visible.

French orientalist and archaeologist, Charles Clermont-Ganneau, visited the site in 1874 and wrote: &quot;The place is absolutely uninhabited, except during the rainy season, when the herdsmen take shelter there for the night.&quot; 

The Arabs of Bayt Nattif in the 19th century, when asked about the meaning of the name of the nearby ruin, , related their own legend about the origin of the name. According to their version, the name = lit. &quot;Holiday of the Hundred,&quot; revolves around an event that occurred there, years ago. According to their story, a large fight broke out on a holiday, in which a hundred people were killed and the settlement destroyed. In memory of the event, the ruins of the settlement were named , which means &quot;Holiday of the Hundred.&quot; Scholars explain this as a case of &#x27;popular etymology&#x27;, where, in Palestinian toponyms, the original denotation of a town&#x27;s name is often &quot;re-interpreted&quot; by its local population.

== Modern period ==
In 1957, the establishment of the &quot;Adullam region&quot; () began, a settlement area comprising over 100,000 dunams (25,000 acres), and bearing the name of the biblical city. Near the mound, north of it, Moshav Aderet was established in 1958.

Surveys were conducted on the site in the years 1992 and 1999. As late as 2003, the archaeological site of Adullam, both, Upper and Lower, had not been excavated, but by September of 2015, an excavation to a depth of 0.2 m in six squares of equal size was conducted in the surface of the Upper ruin, in hopes of determining the extent of the settlement at the site during the various periods from the relative distribution of the pottery. The gathered pottery sherds found &quot;in situ&quot; dated from the Early Bronze Age to the Ottoman period.

<text>Adummim () is a place-name mentioned in the biblical Book of Joshua in connection with the ascent of Adummim.

==Location==
Adummim was apparently on the road between Jerusalem and Jericho in the Judaean desert, today in the West Bank. It is mentioned in the Book of Joshua (, ) as being &quot;on the south side of the stream&quot;, which Matthew Easton (1897) identified with Wadi Kelt, and across from Gilgal or/and Geliloth. Easton claimed that it was nearly halfway between Jerusalem and Jericho, and now bears the name of Tal&#x27;at ed-Dumm. More recently, Pekka Pitkänen (2010) has stated that &quot;The location of Adummim is unclear.&quot;

The &quot;ascent of Adummim&quot; is a very important historical road that leads up from Jericho towards Jerusalem, following the top of a ridge that forms the southern bank of Wadi Qelt and separates it from Wadi Tal&#x27;at ad-Damm.

==Name==
The name Adummim is related to , the Hebrew word for &quot;red&quot;, and can be translated as &quot;red places&quot;, which may refer to the reddish streaks found in the stone of the area. The red-brown hills of the area on the road descending from Jerusalem to Jericho are made of iron-oxide-tinged limestone. The Ascent of Adummim was known as the &quot;Ascent of Blood&quot; by the Crusaders.

==Sources outside the Bible==
The name is attested in the Annals of Thutmose III at Temple of Karnak as Atamem, which Mariette, Rougé, Maspero, Müller, Borchardt and Budge identify with the biblical Adummim.

==In Christianity==
It is supposed to have been the place referred to in the parable of the Good Samaritan. The so-called Inn of the Good Samaritan has been named based on this assumption.

==Archaeological sites==
===St George&#x27;s Monastery (Wadi Qelt)===

A lavra established in the 420s in Wadi Qelt and reorganised as a monastery around the year 500 became known as St George&#x27;s Monastery. Rebuilt since the 19th century, it hangs spectacularly from the cliffs on the south side of the wadi, across from the ridge rising from the Plain of Jericho towards Jerusalem and known as the &quot;ascent of Adummim&quot;.

===Inn of the Good Samaritan (Khan al-Hatruri)===

Another khan built along the Ascent of Adummim, the Good Samaritan Inn, known in Arabic both as Khan al-Hatruri, and sometimes, quite confusingly (see the other khan mentioned above), as Khan al-Ahmar, stands east of the Highway 1-Route 417 junction. Eusebius mentions the Late Roman fort of Maledomni, whose traces have disappeared under the Templar castle of Maldoim (see below). Under the protection of the fortified place, a caravanserai was established. In its present shape it was built in 1903.

In the Early Byzantine period, there seems to have been a fortress at the site (4th-5th century), replaced in the 6th century by a square-shaped hostel, erected around a central courtyard, providing Christian pilgrims with rooms, water from a central cistern, and a large church for worship.

The recently restored complex holds a museum of mosaics excavated by Israeli archaeologists in the Palestinian areas, and a wing dedicated to the history and customs of the Samaritans.

====Templar castle of Maldoim====
Across the modern highway from the Inn of the Good Samaritan/Khan al-Hatruri, are the archaeological remains of a medieval castle known to the Crusaders as Maldoim, Adumim, or Rouge Cisterne / Cisterna Rubea (Red Cistern), among other names. In Arabic it is known as Qal&#x27;at ad-Damm, &quot;Blood Castle&quot;. It was built by the Templars before 1169/72, probably at the site of a Late Roman fort, to protect the road between Jerusalem and Jericho. It stands at the top of the &quot;Ascent of Blood&quot;, as the Ascent of Adummim was known to the Crusaders.

===Monastery of St Euthymius (Khan al-Ahmar)===

The Byzantine Monastery of St. Euthymius, founded at first as a lavra-type monastic community by Saint Euthymius the Great in 420 along the Ascent of Adummim, played a major role in the development of desert monasticism in Palestine, and in the spread of Chalcedonian orthodoxy in the country after the 451 Church Council. Fallen into ruin, it was rebuilt in the Crusader period, only to be abandoned again after its destruction at the beginning of the Mamluk period in the 13th century by Sultan Baybars. The structure was repurposed as a caravanserai or &quot;hhan&quot; for Muslim pilgrims travelling from Jerusalem to Mecca via the nearby shrine of Nabi Musa, and became known as Khan al-Ahmar, the &quot;Red Khan&quot;.

===Monastery of Martyrius===

The Monastery of Martyrius (5th–7th century), excavated in the centre of Ma&#x27;ale Adummim at a site known in Arabic as Khirbet el-Murassas, was an important Byzantine centre of monastic life in the Judaean desert.

==Other places in the area==
The area is accessible via Israel Highway 1.
*Khan al-Ahmar, Palestinian village named after the khan. A number of Bedouin encampments centered around a larger one are collectively known as Khan al-Ahmar.
*Ma&#x27;ale Adummim, the largest Israeli settlement in the West Bank, and its industrial park, Mishor Adummim, were named after biblical Adummim

<text>An advocate is a professional in the field of law. Different countries and legal systems use the term with somewhat differing meanings. The broad equivalent in many English law–based jurisdictions could be a barrister or a solicitor. However, in Scottish, Manx, South African, Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Scandinavian, Polish, Israeli, South Asian and South American jurisdictions, &quot;advocate&quot; indicates a lawyer of superior classification.

&quot;Advocate&quot; is in some languages an honorific for lawyers, such as &quot;Adv. Sir Alberico Gentili&quot;. &quot;Advocate&quot; also has the everyday meaning of speaking out to help someone else, such as patient advocacy or the support expected from an elected politician; this article does not cover those senses.

==Europe==

===United Kingdom and Crown dependencies===

====England and Wales====
In England and Wales, Advocates and proctors practiced civil law in the Admiralty Courts and also, but in England only, in the ecclesiastical courts of the Church of England, in a similar way to barristers, attorneys and solicitors in the common law and equity courts.

Advocates, who formed the senior branch of the legal profession in their field, were Doctors of Law of the University of Oxford, Cambridge, or Dublin and Fellows of the Society of Doctors&#x27; Commons.

Advocates lost their exclusive rights of audience in probate and divorce cases when the Crown took these matters over from the church in 1857, and in Admiralty cases in 1859. The Society of Advocates was never formally wound up, but its building was sold off in 1865 and the last advocate died in 1912.

Barristers were admitted to the Court of Arches of the Church of England in 1867. More recently, Solicitor Advocates have also been allowed to play this role.

====Scotland====

=====Faculty of Advocates=====

Advocates are regulated by the Faculty of Advocates in Edinburgh. The Faculty of Advocates has about 750 members, of whom about 460 are in private practice. About 75 are King&#x27;s Counsel. The Faculty is headed by the Dean of the Faculty who, along with the Vice-Dean, Treasurer, and Clerk are elected annually by secret ballot.
The Faculty has a service company, Faculty Services Ltd, to which almost all Advocates belong, which organized the stables (sets of Advocates or barristers&#x27; chambers) and fee collection. This gives a guarantee to all newly called Advocates of a place. Until the end of 2007, there was an agreement with the Law Society of Scotland, which is the professional body for Scottish solicitors, as to the payment of fees, but this has now been replaced by the Law Society. It remains the case that Advocates are not permitted to sue for their fees, as they have no contractual relationship with their instructing solicitor or with the client. Their fees are honoraria.

Advocates wear wigs, white bow-ties (or falls in the case of senior counsel), straps and gowns as a dress in court.

=====Becoming an advocate=====
The process of becoming an advocate is referred to as devilling. All will be Scottish solicitors, i.e. hold a Bachelor of Laws degree and the Diploma in Legal Practice, and must have completed the traineeships of two years (which in some cases may be reduced to eighteen months) required to qualify as a solicitor; or else will be members of the bar in another common law jurisdiction.

======Admission to the Faculty of Advocates======

At the end of the devilling period, a devil&#x27;s admission to the Faculty is dependent on certification by the principal devil master that the devil is a fit and proper person to be an advocate and that the devil has been involved in a wide range of work in the course of devilling. A devil&#x27;s competence in a number of aspects of written and oral advocacy is assessed during devilling, and a devil will not be admitted to the Faculty if assessed as not competent. Further details of this process can be found in the assessment section.

======Recent developments======

In recent years, increasing numbers of Advocates have come to the Scottish Bar after some time as solicitors, but it is possible to qualify with a law degree, after twenty-one months traineeship in a solicitor&#x27;s office and almost a year as a &#x27;devil&#x27;, or apprentice advocate. There are exceptions for lawyers who are qualified in other European jurisdictions, but all must take the training course as &#x27;devils&#x27;.

Until 2007, a number of young European lawyers were given a placement with Advocates under the European Young Lawyers Scheme organized by the British Council. They are known as &#x27;Eurodevils&#x27;, in distinction to the Scottish &#x27;devils&#x27;. This scheme was withdrawn by the British Council. In January 2009, a replacement scheme began.

Lawyers qualified in other European Union states (but not in England and Wales) may have limited rights of audience in the Scottish supreme courts if they appear with an advocate, and a few solicitors known as &#x27;solicitor-Advocates&#x27; have rights of audience, but for practical purposes, Advocates have almost exclusive rights of audience in the supreme courts – the High Court of Justiciary (criminal), and the Court of Session (civil). Advocates share the right of audience with solicitors in the sheriff courts and justice of the peace courts.

It used to be the case that Advocates were completely immune from suit etc. while conducting court cases and pre-trial work, as they had to act &#x27;fearlessly and independently&#x27;; the rehearing of actions was considered contrary to public interest; and Advocates are &quot;required&quot; to accept clients, they cannot pick and choose. However, the seven-judge English ruling of &quot;Arthur J.S. Hall &amp; Co. (a firm) v. Simons&quot; 2000 (House of Lords) declared that none of these reasons justified the immunity strongly enough to sustain it. This has been followed in Scotland in &quot;Wright v Paton Farrell&quot; (2006) &quot;obiter&quot; insofar as civil cases are concerned.

====Isle of Man====
Advocates are the only lawyers with rights of audience in the courts of the Isle of Man. An advocate&#x27;s role is to advise on all matters of law: it may involve representing a client in the civil and criminal courts or advising a client on matters such as matrimonial and family law, trusts and estates, regulatory matters, property transactions, and commercial and business law. In court, Advocates wear a horsehair wig, stiff collar, bands, and a gown in the same way as barristers do elsewhere.

To become an advocate, it is normally necessary to hold either a qualifying law degree with no less than lower second class (2:2) honors, or else a degree in another subject with no less than lower second class (2:2) honors complemented by the Common Professional Examination. It is then necessary to obtain a legal professional qualification such as the Bar Professional Training Course or the Legal Practice Course. It is not, however, necessary actually to be admitted as an English barrister or solicitor to train as an advocate.

Trainee Advocates (as articled clerks are now more usually known) normally undertake a period of two years’ training articled to a senior advocate; in the case of English barristers or solicitors who have been practicing or admitted for three years this training, the period is reduced to one year. Foreign lawyers who have been registered as legal practitioners in the Isle of Man for a certain time may also undertake a shorter period of training and supervision. During their training, all trainee Advocates are required to pass the Isle of Man bar examinations, which include papers on civil and criminal practice, constitutional and land law, and company law and taxation, as well as accounts. The examinations are rigorous and candidates are limited to three attempts to pass each paper.

Senior English barristers are occasionally licensed to appear as Advocates in cases expected to be unusually long or complex, without having to pass the bar examination or undertake further training: they are permitted only to act in relation to the matter for which they have been licensed. Similarly, barristers and solicitors employed as public prosecutors may be licensed to appear as Advocates without having to pass the bar examination or undertake further training: they are permitted only to act as such only for the duration of that employment.

The professional conduct of Advocates is regulated by the Isle of Man Law Society, which also maintains a library for its members in Douglas. While Advocates in the Isle of Man have not traditionally prefixed their names with &#x27;Advocate&#x27; in the Channel Islands manner, some Advocates have now started to adopt this practice.

====Jersey and the Bailiwick of Guernsey====
Jersey and the Bailiwick of Guernsey are two separate legal jurisdictions, have largely two different sets of laws and have two separate, but similar, legal professions. In both jurisdictions, Advocates—properly called Advocates of the Royal Court—are the only lawyers with general rights of audience in their courts.

To be eligible to practice as an advocate in Jersey, it is necessary first to have a law degree from a British university or a Graduate Diploma in Law and to have qualified as a recognized legal professional in England and Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland. Thereafter, a candidate must undertake two years of practical experience in a law office dealing with Jersey law, enrol on the Jersey Law Course provided by the Institute of Law, Jersey and pass examinations in six subjects. Alternatively, a person may apply to become a Jersey advocate two years after qualifying as a Jersey solicitor.

To become an advocate in Guernsey, one has to possess a valid law degree or diploma, plus a qualification as an English barrister or solicitor, or a French avocat. They must then study for the Guernsey Bar. Three months of study of Norman law at the Université de Caen (University of Caen) is required; this is no longer required for entry into the legal profession in Jersey.

Guernsey Advocates dress in the same way as barristers, but substitute a black biretta-like toque for a wig, while those in Jersey go bare-headed. Advocates are entitled to prefix their names with &#x27;Advocate&#x27;; e.g. Mr. Tostevin is called to the Guernsey Bar and is henceforth known as Advocate Tostevin.

The head of the profession of advocate in each bailiwick is called the Bâtonnier.

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands, the professional conduct and the professional education of the advocates is regulated by the Dutch bar association (Nederlandse orde van advocaten) pursuant to the Advocates Act (&quot;Advocatenwet&quot;).

Dutch advocates are admitted to the bar conditionally, and have full rights of audience with the district courts and court of appeal. In order to obtain unconditional qualification, the advocate has to complete the Dutch bar education (&quot;Beroepsopleiding Advocaten&quot;) and fulfil certain requirements (which may vary among the various judicial regions within the Netherlands) under the supervision of a senior advocate (the &quot;patroon&quot;) for a period of at least three years, called the &quot;stage&quot;. During this time, the advocate is referred to as an &quot;advocaat-stagiair(e)&quot;.

In court, advocates must wear a long black robe (a &quot;toga&quot;) and a white pleated band (a &quot;bef&quot;).

===Nordic countries===
The Nordic countries have a united legal profession, which means that they do not draw a distinction between lawyers who plead in court and those who do not. To get an official recognition with an Advocates title, the candidate must have a legal degree, that is, completed ca. 5–6 years of legal studies from an accredited university in his or own country, and in addition have worked for some time (around 2 – 5 years) under the auspices of a qualified advocate and have some experience from court. When qualified, the candidate may obtain a license as an &quot;advocate&quot;, the equivalent of being called to the bar. In all the Scandinavian languages the title is &quot;advokat&quot;; in Finland &quot;advokat&quot; is the Swedish title for such a qualified lawyer, with the equivalent title in Finnish being &quot;asianajaja&quot;.

However, one does not necessarily have to be an advocate to represent a party in the Nordic countries legally. In Norway, a person with an appropriate law degree, for example, can practice law as a registered legal advisor (&quot;rettshjelper&quot;) instead, which gives many of the same rights as an advocate&#x27;s title. Both in Sweden and Norway any adult, in theory, can represent a party in court without any prior approval, training, license or advocate title. In practice it&#x27;s unusual, and in Norway, it&#x27;s subject to the approval of the court, which is unlikely to give it except in very simple cases.

In English, the Scandinavian title of &quot;advokat&quot; is interchangeably also translated as barrister, lawyer or attorney-at-law.

===Russia===
In Russia, anyone with a legal education (lawyer) can practice law, but only a member of the &quot;&quot; () may practice before a criminal court (other person can be a defence counsel in criminal proceeding along with a member of &quot;Advokatura&quot; but not in lieu him) and Constitutional Court (leaving aside persons having academic degree of candidate or doctor in juridical sciences who also can represent parties in constitutional proceeding). Specialist degree in law is the most commonly awarded academic degree in Russian jurisprudence but after Russia&#x27;s accession to the Bologna process only bachelor of laws and master of laws academic degrees are available in Russian institutions of higher education. An &quot;advocate&quot; is a lawyer who has demonstrated qualification and belongs to an organizational structure of Advocates specified by law, known as being &quot;called to the bar&quot; in Commonwealth countries.

An examination is administered by the qualifications commission of regional advocate&#x27;s chamber for admission to its &quot;&quot;. To sit for the exam, one must have a higher legal education and also two years of experience in legal work after graduation or a training program in a law firm after graduation. The exam is both written and oral, but the main test is oral. The written exam takes place in the form of computer testing and includes issues of the professional conduct of advocate and advocate&#x27;s professional responsibility. After successfully passing of the written exam the candidates are allowed to take the oral exam. As part of the oral exam, the candidate must demonstrate his knowledge in various bodies of law and solve some mimic a real-life legal tasks. The candidate who does not pass the qualification exam can try to pass it again after 1 year only. The qualifications commission is composed of seven Advocates, two judges, two representatives of the regional legislature, and two representatives of the Ministry of Justice.

After successful passing the qualification exam a candidate should take the oath of advocate. From the moment of taking the oath, he becomes an advocate and a member of the advocate&#x27;s chamber of the relevant federal subject of Russia. Advocate&#x27;s chamber sends relevant information to the territorial subdivision of the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation, which includes the new advocate in the register of Advocates of the relevant federal subject of Russia and issues to him an advocate&#x27;s certificate, which is the only official document confirming the status of an advocate, on the basis of this information. The status of an advocate is granted for an indefinite period and is not limited by any age. There is only 1 advocate&#x27;s chamber in each federal subject of Russia. Each advocate can be the member of only 1 advocate&#x27;s chamber and can be listed in the register of Advocates of the relevant federal subject of Russia only. In case of relocation to another region, the advocate ceases to be a member of the advocate&#x27;s chamber and should be excluded from register of Advocates at the old place of residence (advocate&#x27;s certificate should be returned to the subdivision of the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation, which issued it), and after that he becomes a member of the advocate&#x27;s chamber and is included in the register of Advocates at the new place of residence (where he receive new advocate&#x27;s certificate) without any exams. Each advocate can carry out his professional activity throughout Russia, regardless of membership in particular regional advocate&#x27;s chamber and regardless of particular regional register where he is listed in. Advocates carry out their professional activity individually (advocate&#x27;s cabinet) or as the member of advocate&#x27;s juridical person (collegium of Advocates, advocate&#x27;s bureau). Advocate can open own cabinet after at least 3 years legal practice in collegium or bureau. An advocate, who has opened own cabinet, can not be the member of any advocate&#x27;s juridical person, and an advocate, who is the member of one advocate&#x27;s juridical person, can not be the member of any other advocate&#x27;s juridical person. Advocate is obliged to report to advocate&#x27;s chamber any changes in his membership in a collegium or a bureau and, equally, opening and closing a cabinet.

An advocate can not be an individual entrepreneur, government official, municipal official, notary, judge, elected official. An advocate can not work under an employment (labour) contract, with the exception of scientific and teaching activities. An advocate may combine his status with the status of a patent attorney, a trustee in bankruptcy. An advocate may be a shareholder/owner of business juridical persons and a member of voluntary associations and political parties. Russian advocate may have a status of advocate (attorney, barrister, solicitor) in foreign jurisdiction, subject to above conditions.

Russian law provides for voluntary and involuntary suspension of advocate&#x27;s status. Voluntary suspension for a term of 1 to 10 years occurs when an Advocate files relevant application to the advocate&#x27;s chamber. Involuntary suspension is applicable in cases of serious illness, election to an elected position in federal, regional or local authorities, military conscription, declaration of absence made by the court decision. An Advocate can not carry out advocate&#x27;s activity during suspension, otherwise he may be deprived of the right to be an Advocate. After the end of the suspension, advocate&#x27;s status should be resumed without any additional conditions. Also Russian law provides for voluntary and involuntary termination of advocate&#x27;s status. Voluntary termination of the status occurs when an Advocate files relevant application to the advocate&#x27;s chamber. Involuntary termination of the status is applicable in cases of death, declaration of no having legal capacity or having limited legal capacity made by the court decision, conviction for intentional crime made by the court decision, violations of the federal law regulating advocate&#x27;s activity or advocate&#x27;s code of conduct found by advocate&#x27;s chamber. The latter two cases incur lifetime prohibition on being an Advocate. In other cases, ex-Advocate can go back to being an Advocate on general grounds through a passing the qualification exam, on condition that the reasons for termination of advocate&#x27;s status have ceased to exist.

Advocate&#x27;s chambers are professional associations of Advocates, which are based on mandatory membership of Advocates. All regional advocate&#x27;s chambers are mandatory members of Federal Chamber of Advocates of Russian Federation (), which is professional association at the federal level.

As of 2018, there were 49,4 Advocates per people in Russia.

In Russia, foreign Advocates can advise on the legislation of their countries; they should register in the special register maintained by the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation to obtain the right to carry out this activity. Foreign advocate can in addition become Russian advocate. There are two possible paths for that. The first possibility is to become Russian advocate on the same basis as Russian citizens (i.e. through higher legal education in one of Russian universities, two years of experience in legal work in Russia after graduation or a training program in Russian law firm after graduation, successful passing the qualification exam). Since Russia&#x27;s WTO Accession the second possibility is available: foreign advocate can just pass special qualification exam to become Russian advocate.

==Asia==

===Bangladesh===
In Bangladesh, after passing the Higher Secondary School Certificate, one can apply for admission for studying law in Universities. There are several public and private universities which provide Bachelor of Laws and Master of Laws degree in Bangladesh. Generally, the LL.B. course is equivalent to a four-year bachelor&#x27;s degree. Graduate lawyers have to seat for and pass the Bar Council Exam to become Advocates.

====Advocate of Supreme Court====
By passing the Bangladesh Bar Council Exam, Advocates are eligible to practice in the Supreme Court of Bangladesh and other courts. A license is obtained after successful completion of two year&#x27;s practice in the lower courts by applicant, which is reviewed by a body of the relevant provincial Bar Council. Most applications after successful completion of the requirement, are accepted.

===India===
In India, the law relating to the Advocates is the Advocates Act, 1961 introduced and thought up by Ashoke Kumar Sen, the then law minister of India, which is a law passed by the Parliament and is administered and enforced by the Bar Council of India. Under the Act, the Bar Council of India is the supreme regulatory body to regulate the legal profession in India and also to ensure the compliance of the laws and maintenance of professional standards by the legal profession in the country.

Each State has a Bar Council of its own whose function is to enroll the Advocates willing to practice predominantly within the territorial confines of that State and to perform the functions of the Bar Council of India within the territory assigned to them. Therefore, each law degree holder must be enrolled with a (single) State Bar Council to practice in India. However, enrollment with any State Bar Council does not restrict the Advocate from appearing before any court in India, even though it is beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the State Bar Council which he is enrolled in.

The advantage of having the State Bar Councils is that the workload of the Bar Council of India can be divided into these various State Bar Councils and also that matters can be dealt with locally and in an expedited manner. However, for all practical and legal purposes, the Bar Council of India retains with it, the final power to take decisions in any and all matters related to the legal profession on the whole or with respect to any Advocate individually, as so provided under the Advocates Act, 1961.

The process of being entitled to practice in India is twofold. First, the applicant must be a holder of a law degree from a recognised institution in India (or from one of the four recognised Universities in the United Kingdom) and second, must pass the enrollment qualifications of the Bar Council of the state where he/she seeks to be enrolled. For this purpose, the Bar Council of India has an internal Committee whose function is to supervise and examine the various institutions conferring law degrees and to grant recognition to these institutions once they meet the required standards. In this manner, the Bar Council of India also ensures the standard of education required for practicing in India is met with. As regards the qualification for enrollment with the State Bar Council, while the actual formalities may vary from one State to another, yet predominately they ensure that the application has not been a bankrupt /criminal and is generally fit to practice before courts of India.

Enrollment with a Bar Council also means that the law degree holder is recognised as an Advocate and is required to maintain a standard of conduct and professional demeanor at all times, both on and off the profession. The Bar Council of India also prescribes &quot;Rules of Conduct&quot; to be observed by the Advocates in the courts, while interacting with clients and even otherwise.

All Advocates in India are at the same level and are recognised as such. Any distinction, if any, is made only on the basis of seniority, which implies the length of practice at the Bar. As a recognition of law practice and specialisation in an area of law, there is a concept of conferral of Senior Advocate status. An Advocate may be recognised by the Judges of the High Court (in case of an Advocate practicing before that High Court) or by the Supreme Court (in case of the Advocate practicing before the Supreme Court). While the conferral of Senior Advocate status not only implies distinction and fame of the Advocate, it also requires the Senior Advocate to follow higher standards of conduct and some distinct rules. Also, a Senior Advocate is not allowed to interact directly with the clients. He can only take briefs from other Advocates and argue on the basis of the details given by them. From the year 2010 onward a mandatory rule is made for lawyers passing out from the year 2009–10 to sit for an evaluation test named AIBE (All India Bar Exam) for one to qualify as an advocate and practice in the courts. However, to practice law before the Supreme Court of India, Advocates must first appear for and qualify in the Supreme Court Advocate on Record Examination conducted by the Supreme Court.

Further, under the Constitutional structure, there is a provision for the elevation of Advocates as judges of High Courts and Supreme Court. The only requirement is the Advocate must have ten years standing before the High Court(/s) or before the Supreme Court to be eligible for such. (Article 217 and 124 of the Constitution of India for High Courts and Supreme Court respectively)

===Pakistan===
There are four levels of Advocates exist in Pakistan, 1.Advocate 2.Advocate High Court 3.Advocate Supreme Court 4.Senior Advocate Supreme Court:

====Advocate====
The first level is that of an Advocate, who is eligible to practice in the district courts or lower courts in their respective province. An Advocate is considered an officer of the court. To become an Advocate, one can qualify by completing a five-year law degree (LL.B (Hons)), or by obtaining a foreign LL.B degree of a shorter duration, recognized by the relevant authorities. Additionally, they must complete six months of pupillage under a senior Advocate in their chambers. Afterward, they are required to pass a GAT test recognized by the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan (HEC) and the Pakistan Bar Council, achieving a minimum passing score of 50%. Subsequently, they must successfully clear the Bar admission test and undergo an examination conducted by the Bar Council of their respective province to determine their suitability for becoming an Advocate and confirm that they have no criminal convictions. Upon passing a multiple-choice question examination and an interview conducted by members of the provincial Bar Council, the Bar Council will issue them a license to practice before the Subordinate Courts up to the High Court.

====Advocate High Court====
After completing two years of practice as an Advocate, with a minimum of ten successfully litigated cases, the Advocate will be required to submit a list of these cases for examination by a committee appointed by the High Court. The committee, chaired by a High Court Judge, will review the cases and, if satisfied, grant their approval for the Advocate&#x27;s elevation to practice as an Advocate of the High Court. Upon approval, the committee will send the recommendation directly to the Bar Council, and the Advocate will be issued a license to practice as an Advocate of the High Court. As an Advocate of the High Court, they will have the right to practice in any court throughout the country, except for the Supreme Court of Pakistan.

====Advocate Supreme Court====
Advocate Supreme Court is the third level. After successful completion of ten years of practice in the High Courts by the applicant, the panel of members of Pakistan Bar Council and one judge of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, review the application. (Before 1985 the requirement was successful completion of five years practice in the High Courts of Pakistan.) Over fifty per cent of applications are accepted, after successful completion of the requirement. An unsuccessful application in one year does not bar the candidate from re-applying in the next judicial year.

The highest level is the Senior Advocate Supreme Court. It is Pakistan&#x27;s title equivalent to Queen&#x27;s Counsel in the United Kingdom. 
After at least fifteen years of practice, by invitation or by an application to a panel of Supreme Court Judges headed by the Chief Justice of Pakistan, one can become Senior Advocate of Supreme Court of Pakistan. Very few applications are accepted and even fewer invitations are made. Attorneys General are usually invited by the Supreme Court on the appointment, to the office. So are some notable High Court judges who upon retirement choose to practice before the Supreme Court, where they are still eligible to do so.

===Sri Lanka===
In Sri Lanka (formally Ceylon) till 1973 Advocate was a practitioner in a court of law who is legally qualified to prosecute and defend actions in such court on the retainer of clients. Advocates had to pass the HSC exam and enter the Ceylon Law College and follow the Advocates course and sit for the relevant exams. Thereafter, they would have to practice under a senior advocate before being called to the bar for admission as an Advocate of the Supreme Court of Ceylon. Members of the English, Scottish and Irish Bars are permitted to be admitted to a Barrister without examination on payment of a fee. Ceylonese Advocates with three years standing were allowed to be called to the English Bar without examination on completing three terms. The &quot;Justice Law No. 44 of 1973&quot; of the National State Assembly created a single group of practitioners known as Attorneys-at-law. The current equivalent to an advocate is a counsel who is a trial lawyer distinguished from an instructing attorney.

==Africa==

===South Africa===
In South Africa, there are two main branches of legal practitioner: attorneys, who do legal work of all kinds, and Advocates, who are specialist litigators; see Attorneys in South Africa. 
In general, Advocates (also called &#x27;counsel&#x27;) are &#x27;briefed&#x27; by attorneys when a specialist skill in court-based litigation, or in research into the law (an opinion) is required. 
Referral Advocates thus have no direct contact with clients and are said to be in a &#x27;referral&#x27; profession. However, Advocates who have a Trust Account and hold a valid Fidelity Fund Certificate are authorized to take briefs directly from the public and attorneys respectively.

The key formal distinction, however, is the different rights with regard to the courts in which they may appear. Advocates have the right to appear in any court, while attorneys have the right to appear only in the lower courts. (And, under certain conditions, can acquire the right of appearance in the superior courts, by applying to the registrar of the provincial division of the relevant High Court.) A further distinction is that while attorneys practice in partnership, Advocates are individual practitioners and never form partnerships; practice in &quot;Chambers&quot; and / or &quot;Groups&quot; is standard.

The requirements to enter private practice as Advocates (Junior Counsel) are to hold the LL.B. degree, and to become a member of a Bar Association by undergoing a period of training (pupilage) for one year with a practicing Advocate, and to sit an admission examination. See Legal education in South Africa.

On the recommendation of the Bar Councils, an advocate &quot;of proven experience and skill&quot; with at least ten years experience, may be appointed by the President of South Africa as a Senior Counsel (SC; also referred to as a &quot;silk&quot;). Junior advocates are commonly rewarded with a traditional gift of a red brief bag by a Senior Counsel as recognition for excellence.

&quot;State Advocates&quot; act as a public prosecutor in High Court matters, typically in cases requiring preparation and research. They are appointed by the National Prosecuting Authority and are attached to the Office of the National Director of Public Prosecutions.

==Americas==

===Brazil===
In Brazil, the bar examination occurs nationally in March, August, and December. These examinations are unified and organized by the Order of Attorneys of Brazil. After 5 years in law school, Brazilian law students are required to take the bar exam, which consists of 2 phases: the multiple choice test and written test, without any further requirements.

The Constitution of Brazil applies restrictions on professional practice of law in the fulfillment of the requirements, which may include in addition to graduation, formal submission of the applicant in the proficiency tests. The Order exam is tied to Law No. 8609 of 4/7/1994:

&quot;Article 8: For registration as an attorney is needed: IV - &quot;To pass the Examination of the Order;&quot;

Within its powers expressly granted by the Constitution, the ordinary legislative demands that whoever wishes to pursue the legal profession possess the degree of Bachelor of Law and approval of Examination of Order, whose preparation and implementation is done by their own class. The Constitution itself provides for the restriction, and the Statute of Law requires the examination.

The bar exam in Brazil approves very few students and is considered a hard one. For instance, in February 2014, the Bar association made a release stating that only 19.64% of students had been approved in the last exam and were able to register as a lawyer.

<text>Agabus (; ; ) was an early follower of Christianity from Syria mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles as a prophet. He is traditionally remembered as one of the Seventy Disciples described in Luke .

== Name ==
The name Agabus derived from the Aramaic &quot;Ḥagab&quot;, meaning &quot;Grasshopper&quot;, which may have been a nickname or pseudonym.

== Biblical and traditional accounts ==
According to extrabiblical tradition, Agabus appears to have been a resident of Jerusalem. He is said to have been one of the seventy disciples, mentioned in the Gospel of Luke, commissioned to preach the gospel. It is said that Agabus was with the twelve apostles in the upper room on the day of Pentecost.

According to Acts , he was one of a group of prophets who travelled from Jerusalem to Antioch. The author reports that Agabus had received the gift of prophecy and predicted a severe famine, which occurred during the reign of the emperor Claudius.

Also, according to Acts , &#x27;a certain prophet&#x27;, () named Agabus met Paul the Apostle at Caesarea Maritima in AD 58. He was, according to the Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary, &#x27;no doubt the same&#x27; Agabus as had been mentioned in , and Heinrich Meyer states that &#x27;there is no reason against the assumed identity of this person with the one mentioned in Acts 11:28. Agabus warned Paul of his coming capture; he bound his own hands and feet with Paul&#x27;s belt to demonstrate what would happen if he continued his journey to Jerusalem, stating the message of the Holy Spirit:
So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man who owns this belt, and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.
Paul, however, would not be persuaded to stay away.

Agabus&#x27; symbolic action has been compared with the Jewish prophet Jeremiah:

Thus the LORD said to me, &quot;Go and buy yourself a linen waistband and put it around your waist, but do not put it in water.&quot; So I bought the waistband in accordance with the word of the LORD and put it around my waist ... For as a belt is bound around the waist, so I bound all the people of Israel and all the people of Judah to me,&#x27; declares the LORD, &#x27;to be my people for my renown and praise and honor.

Tradition says that Agabas went to many countries, teaching and converting many. This moved the Jews of Jerusalem to arrest him, and they tortured him by beating him severely, and putting a rope around his neck. He was dragged outside the city and stoned to death. Jesuit theologian Anthony Maas says he was martyred at Antioch.

==Veneration==
The Roman Catholic Church celebrates his feast day on February 13, while Eastern Christians celebrate it on March 8.

<text>Agag (; &quot;ʾĂgāg&quot;) is a Northwest Semitic name or title applied to a biblical king. It has been suggested that &quot;Agag&quot; was a dynastic name of the kings of Amalek, just as Pharaoh was used as a dynastic name for the ancient Egyptians. The etymology is uncertain, according to John L. McKenzie (1995), while Cox (1884) suggested &quot;High.&quot;

In the Torah, the expression &quot;Its king higher than Agag, and its kingdom exalted&quot; was uttered by Balaam in Numbers 24:7, in his third prophetic utterance, to describe a king of Israel who would be higher than the king of Amalek. This is understood to mean that Israel&#x27;s king would take a higher position than even Amalek himself, and would exercise a wider authority. The writer uses an allusion to the literal significance of the word &quot;Agag&quot;, meaning &quot;high&quot;, to convey that the king of Israel would be &quot;higher than High&quot;. A characteristic trait of biblical poetry is to use puns.

Agag also refers to the Amalekite king who survived King Saul&#x27;s extermination campaign, as punishment for Amalekite crimes, in the Book of Samuel. Saul failed to execute Agag and allowed the people to keep some of the spoils, and this resulted in Samuel&#x27;s pronouncement of God&#x27;s rejection of Saul as king. Agag was then executed by Samuel, to punish him for his offense of &quot;bereaving women of children with the sword&quot;.

==Views in Judaism==
The rabbis taught that the Jews took vengeance on Agag for the cruelties they had undergone at the hands of the Amalekites, who, to mock at the Israelites, their God, and the rite of circumcision, mutilated every Jew that fell into their power. Samuel, they say, treated Agag in the same way. According to some authorities, the death of Agag, described in the Bible by the unusual word &quot;va-yeshassef&quot; (&quot;hewed in pieces,&quot; I Samuel 15:33), was brought about in a much more cruel way than the word denotes. Others think that the only unusual thing in the execution of Agag consisted in the fact that it was not carried out strictly in accordance with the provisions of the Jewish law, requiring witnesses to prove the crime; nor had he been specifically &quot;warned&quot; as the law required. But, Agag being a heathen, Samuel convicted him according to the heathen law, which demanded only evidence of the crime for condemnation (Pesiq. iii. 25b, Pesiq. R. xii. xiii. and the parallel passages quoted by Buber in Pesiq.). The execution of Agag, however, occurred in one respect too late, for had he been killed one day sooner—that is, immediately upon his capture by Saul—the great peril which the Jews had to undergo at the hands of Haman would have been averted, for Agag thereby became a progenitor of Haman (Megillah 13a, Targ. Sheni to Esth. iv. 13).

According to another Midrash, Doeg the Edomite tried to extend the life of Agag, the king of the Amalekites-Edomites, by interpreting Lev. 22:28 into a prohibition against the destruction of both the old and the young in war (Midr. Teh. lii. 4). Doeg is among those who have forfeited their portion in the future world by their wickedness (Sanh. x. 1; compare ib. 109b). Doeg is an instance of the evil consequences of calumny, because by calumniating the priests of Nob he lost his own life, and caused the death of Saul, Abimelech, and Abner (Yer. Peah i. 16a; Midr. Teh. cxx. 9 [ed. Buber, p. 504]).E. C. L. G.

When he received the command to smite Amalek (I Sam. 15:3), Saul said: &quot;For one found slain the Torah requires a sin offering [Deut. 21:1-9]; and here so many shall be slain. If the old have sinned, why should the young suffer; and if men have been guilty, why should the cattle be destroyed?&quot; It was this mildness that cost him his crown (Yoma 22b; Num. R. i. 10)—the fact that he was merciful even to his enemies, being indulgent to rebels themselves, and frequently waiving the homage due to him. If his mercy toward a foe was a sin, it was his misfortune that it was reckoned against him. David, although he had committed much iniquity, was so favored that it was not remembered to his injury (Yoma 22b; M. Ḳ 16b, and Rashi ad loc.).

Harsh as it seems the command to blot out Amalek&#x27;s memory, its justification was seen in the leniency shown by King Saul, the son of Kish, to Agag, the king of the Amalekites (I Samuel 15:9), which made it possible for Haman the Agagite to appear (Esther 3:1); his cruel plot against the Jews could only be counteracted by another descendant of Kish, Mordecai (Pesiḳ. R. xiii.). Every year, therefore, the chapter, &quot;Remember what Amalek did unto thee&quot; (Deut. 25:17-19), is read in the synagogue on the Sabbath preceding Purim, and the story of Saul and Agag in chapter 15 of I Samuel is read as the Haftarah.

<doc id="68601" wikidata="Q298636" url="?curid=68601" title="Herod Agrippa">
<text>Herod Agrippa (Roman name Marcus Julius Agrippa; ), also known as Agrippa I () or Agrippa the Great, was the last king of Judea. He was a grandson of Herod the Great and the father of Herod Agrippa II, the last known king from the Herodian dynasty. He was an acquaintance or friend of Roman emperors and played crucial roles in internal Roman politics.

He spent his childhood and youth at the imperial court in Rome where he befriended the imperial princes Claudius and Drusus. He suffered a period of disgrace following the death of Drusus which forced him to return to live in Judea. Back in Rome around 35, Tiberius made him the guardian of his grandson Tiberius Gemellus, and Agrippa approached the other designated heir, Caligula. The advent of Caligula to the throne allowed Agrippa to become king of Batanea, Trachonitis, Gaulanitis, Auranitis, Paneas and Iturea in 37 by obtaining the old tetrarchies of Philip and Lysanias, then Galilee and Perea in 40 following the disgrace of his uncle, Herod Antipas.

After the assassination of Caligula, he played a leading role in Rome in the accession of Claudius to the head of the empire in 41, and he was endowed with the former territories of Herod Archelaus (Idumea, Judea and Samaria) thus ruling over a territory as vast as the kingdom of Herod the Great.

Carrying a dual Jewish and Roman identity, he played the role of intercessor on behalf of the Jews with the Roman authorities and, on the domestic level, gave hope to some of his Jewish subjects of the restoration of an independent kingdom. Pursuing the Herodian policy of euergetism through major works in several Greek cities of the Near East, he nevertheless alienated some of his Greek and Syrian subjects while his regional ambitions earned him the opposition of Marsus, the legate of Roman Syria.

Agrippa died suddenly—possibly poisoned—in 44. He is the king named Herod whose death is recounted in Acts 12 ().

==Biography==
===Origins===
====Family====
Herod Agrippa was born in Caesarea Maritima around 11 BC. He was the son of Aristobulus IV, one of the children that Herod the Great had with Mariamne the Hasmonean. His mother was Berenice, daughter of Salome, daughter of Antipater and sister of Herod the Great. Herod the Great was therefore both the paternal grandfather and the maternal great-uncle of Agrippa. His parents marked the Roman status of this Jewish prince by giving him the name of a close collaborator of Emperor Augustus, Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa.

Herod the Great, a ruler perceived as a ruthless usurper by his subjects, was a devoted supporter of the Roman Empire and promoted its cause throughout his kingdom. His reign was characterized by violence and numerous family intrigues as he had 10 wives. In 29 BC, Herod executed his wife Mariamne, Agrippa&#x27;s grandmother, out of jealousy. The following year, he executed Agrippa&#x27;s mother Berenice. In 7 BC, when Agrippa was just three or four years old, Herod had Agrippa&#x27;s father Aristobulus IV and uncle Alexander executed following more palace intrigues. These events also led to the executions of Antipater, a son Herod had with Doris, and Costobarus, Agrippa&#x27;s maternal grandfather, three years later. Herod was responsible for the deaths of numerous members of the Hasmonean dynasty and its supporters, almost wiping them out entirely. However, he spared the children of Aristobulus, including Agrippa, Herod, and Aristobulus Minor as well as the daughters Herodias and Mariamne. Agrippa thus descends from both the Hasmonean and Herodian dynasties, but his father&#x27;s death sentence for treason seems to set him aside from a logic of succession.

====Imperial court====

In 5 BC, two years after the condemnation of his father, the young Agrippa was sent by Herod the Great to the imperial court of Rome in the company of Berenice as well as his brothers and sisters. He was supported there by his mother&#x27;s friend Antonia Minor (sister-in-law of Tiberius – who would become emperor in 14 – and mother of the future emperor Claudius) as well as by Empress Livia, who was the friend of his grandmother. Agrippa grew up in Rome with the children of the imperial family, including Drusus, the young son of Tiberius, to whom he was particularly attached, and Tiberius&#x27; nephew Claudius, who was the same age as Agrippa. He thus lived all his youth in the capital of the empire and personally knew almost all the members of the imperial family. At that time, Agrippa&#x27;s future appeared to be secured by his privileged relationship with Claudius (the heir apparent of Tiberius) and Drusus.

As young men, Agrippa and his friends Claudius and Drusus had a reputation for immorality and excess. Agrippa went into debt as a result of this sumptuous life and received significant financial assistance from his uncle Herod Antipas. But Agrippa&#x27;s future darkened with the death of Drusus in 23, isolating him and leaving him helpless in the face of his creditors, especially since Berenice probably died at the same time. After the death of his son, the distraught Tiberius reacted by removing Agrippa and Claudius from his court.

=== Return to Judea ===
Agrippa squandered the rest of his fortune trying to win the favor of the freedmen of Tiberius, and he hastily left Rome for the province of Judea. In Judea he experienced various adventures and scandals linked to the need to ensure his lifestyle without enjoying the corresponding income.

Around 26, Agrippa married his cousin Cypros (daughter of Phasael, son of the tetrarch Phasael) who gave him a son named Herod Agrippa II. Agrippa and Cypros lived in a fortress in Malatha of Idumea where they led a modest existence, far from the splendor of the imperial court.

Cypros got along well with Herodias, the wife of Herod Antipas, who encouraged Antipas to continue to help Agrippa. Antipas provided him with money, offered to settle Agrippa and his family in Tiberias, and appointed him as the &quot;agoranomos&quot; (organizer of the &quot;agora&quot;) of the city, which provided him with a regular income. However, this situation was short-lived. Agrippa accepted at first, but he soon gave the impression of not being satisfied with what was given to him. He quickly found this burden boring in a small provincial town devoid of the amenities of the Roman civilization which he had become accustomed. He quarreled with Antipas during a banquet in Tyre and then went to Syria, of which his friend Lucius Pomponius Flaccus was the legate. Shortly after, he was disgraced following an intervention by his brother Aristobulus Minor, who denounced him to Flaccus for having received a bribe to defend the interests of Damascus against Sidon in a border dispute brought before his legate friend. Agrippa then decided to attempt a return to Rome where Tiberius might agree to receive his son&#x27;s old friends again.

===Back to Rome===

Agrippa borrowed the sum of 20,000 drachmas to embark at Anthedon for Alexandria, after having been reminded by the Roman governor of Yavne, Herennius Capiton, for the debts contracted vis-à-vis the treasury of the empire. Herennius sent him the troop, but taking advantage of the night, Agrippa embarked and managed to reach Alexandria where he obtained new funding from the alabarch Alexander Lysimachus, brother of Philo and head of the Jewish community of Alexandria. This senior official, belonging to a Jewish family of Roman citizens, was a large landowner and, like Agrippa, a friend of Claudius. Lysimachus refused to lend the money directly to Agrippa, whose reputation for profligacy was well established. It was with his capital of 200,000 drachmas that Agrippa embarked for Italy in the spring of 36.

Tiberius, retired to Capri, received Agrippa and gave his son&#x27;s former companion a warm welcome, which was soon tempered by a letter from the governor of Yavne about his debts. But Antonia Minor helped Agrippa to get out of this new embarrassment by advancing him the totality of the sum due—300,000 drachmas—and Agrippa regained imperial favour. All these details are found in the second work of Josephus, the &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot;, published around 93/94, during the reign of Domitian, but in book II of &quot;The Jewish War&quot;, his first account, published between 75–79, Josephus was more direct. It was &quot;to accuse the tetrarch&quot; Herod Antipas, that Agrippa decided to go &quot;to Tiberius&quot;, in order to try to take his domain, and it was because Agrippa had been ousted from his pretensions to obtain the tetrarchy of Antipas that he would have started plotting against the emperor. Like other information about Agrippa, these are not found in the Judaic texts, whereas Josephus expands much on the subject.

The emperor asked Agrippa to take charge of Drusus&#x27; son, his grandson Tiberius Gemellus, then a teenager and one of the two designated heirs of Tiberius with his grand-nephew Caius Caligula, grandson of the protector of Agrippa, Antonia. Antonia undertook to win the favors and friendship of Caius, imitated in this by another prince without a kingdom, Antiochos of Commagene, and managed to contract a loan of one million drachmas from a Samaritan freedman of the emperor to carry out his project with the rising star of Rome. Although the conditions are unknown under which the friendship between the two men was forged, it must have been worth such an investment.

A flattery from Agrippa to Caligula however caused him trouble: wishing in a conversation that the death of Tiberius would not be delayed any longer so that the young prince could succeed him, this remark was reported to Tiberius who ordered the arrest of Agrippa. Agrippa enjoyed a comfortable captivity and was released by Caligula shortly after the death of Tiberius on 16 March 37, when Pontius Pilate arrived in Rome.

The accession to the throne of his friend began Agrippa&#x27;s fortune. Caligula offered Agrippa a gold chain &quot;of the same weight as the chain of his captivity&quot;. He granted him, in addition to the title of king and the diadem which was its sign, the territories of Philip, who had died shortly before, tetrarch of Iturea, Trachonitis, Batanea, Gaulanitis, Auranitis and Paneas, located northeast of the lake of Tiberias. Caligula also conferred on him the praetorian ornaments, a dignity which allows certain non-senators to sit among them during public celebrations. &quot;This completely exceptional reversal of the situation seems to have greatly impressed Agrippa&#x27;s contemporaries.&quot;

According to Josephus, after he placed the royal diadem on the head of Agrippa I, Caligula sent Marullus as &quot;hipparch (ἱππάρχης) of Judea&quot; to replace Pontius Pilate, who had been dismissed by Lucius Vitellius and had just arrived in Rome. Agrippa showed no eagerness to take charge of the affairs of his kingdom, and it was only in the summer of 38 that he went to Batanea for a short stay.

===Troubles in Judea===
During his stay in Rome, several events took place in Judea which created a very tense situation. Since 35, the Romans and the legate of Syria Lucius Vitellius were engaged in a decisive confrontation against the Parthians and their king Artabanus III about the control of the Kingdom of Armenia. In 36, the armies of two kings who were clients of the Romans, Aretas IV and Herod Antipas, clashed around the territory of Gamla, causing a crushing defeat for Antipas. According to Movses Khorenatsi, as well as several sources in Syriac and Armenian, King Abgar V of Edessa provided auxiliary forces to Aretas. However, the historicity of this mention is disputed by Jean-Pierre Mahé. It is possible that Aretas took advantage of Antipas&#x27; participation in the great conference on the Euphrates, to conceal peace and the Roman victory over Artabanus (autumn 36), to launch his offensive. The territorial claim of the Nabataeans was revived by Antipas&#x27; will to repudiate Phasaélis, the daughter Aretas, to marry Herodias, the sister of Agrippa. Antipas&#x27; goal was dynastic. It is a question of consolidating his position to be named by the emperor at the head of the tetrarchy of Philip who has just died or to be named king. At some point in this conflict, probably between 29 and 35, Antipas attempts to silence his opposition by executing John the Baptist. This execution seems to have had important repercussions on the political situation in the region for several years. Thus the defeat of Antipas is considered within the Jewish population as a divine revenge against Antipas to punish him for having put John to death and of which Aretas would have been only the instrument.

According to Simon Claude Mimouni, the governorship of Pontius Pilate was one of the five high points of the troubles that Judea experienced between the death of Herod the Great and the outbreak of the Great Jewish Revolt, punctuated by no less than six major incidents, to which must be added the crucifixion of Jesus of Nazareth and possibly the sedition of Jesus Bar Abbas, whose popularity is reported in the Synoptic Gospels. However, for some historians, the two Jesuses are one, the evangelists using a literary device to describe two faces of Jesus, while exempting the Romans from their responsibility in this execution, so that the Gospels cannot be suspected of containing the slightest criticism of the authorities in power.

In 36, Pontius Pilate quickly suppressed a gathering of Samaritans on Mount Gerizim. The gathering had a messianic connotation whose leader—whom Josephus avoids naming—sought to appear as the eschatological prophet similar to Moses, one of the three messianic figures found in the Dead Sea Scrolls. A figure that has also been attributed to John the Baptist and Jesus the Nazorean. Certain Church Fathers, as well as the Mandaean tradition and in particular one of their writings, the &quot;Haran-Gawaita&quot;, provide indications according to which it could be Dositheos of Samaria who succeeded to the head of the movement of John the Baptist after his execution, for he was one of his disciples. Pilate crucified their leaders and the most prominent personalities that he managed to capture. At the end of 36, Vitellius used the complaints of the Council of Samaritans about this incident as a pretext to dismiss Pilate at the end of a ten-year term so that he explains to the emperor what the Jews are accusing him of. On the following Passover, he came in person to Jerusalem to dismiss the high priest Caiaphas, who was too closely linked to Pilate, and restored to the priests of the temple the supervision of the ceremonies of the Jewish worship festivals. When the death of Tiberius was announced at Pentecost in 37, Vitellius, reluctant to support Antipas with his troops, interrupted the march of his two legions against Aretas, considering that he could no longer wage war without orders from the new emperor. He made the people swear loyalty to Caligula and once again dismissed the high priest whom he had appointed 50 days earlier.

===Establishment of the kingdom===

Agrippa returned to his territories in the summer of 38. Josephus does not recount the conditions under which the Nabataean troops withdrew from the former tetrarchy of Philip, which constituted the bulk of the territories attributed to Agrippa. In an agreement between Aretas and Caligula, Damascus was transferred to Nabathean control.

On the way to his new kingdom, Agrippa passed through Alexandria around July 38 where he probably lodged with the alabarch Alexander Lysimachus, the brother of Philo of Alexandria and the father of Tiberius Alexander. whose daughter Berenice would marry the son Marcus Alexander a few years later. There was then an anti-Jewish atmosphere in the city that had lasted for some time. During festivities, Agrippa was the target of a popular anti-Jewish masquerade featuring an idiot nicknamed Karabas, foreshadowing the Jewish-Alexandrian conflict that agitated the city from 38 to 41. These troubles led the two parties—Jews and Alexandrian Greeks—to each send three delegates to the emperor to settle the deeper conflict between the two communities. Philo was one of the Jewish delegation.

The return of Agrippa excited the jealousy of his sister Herodias who urged her husband Antipas to claim for himself the title of king in Rome. In 39, Antipas resolved to meet Caligula to try to obtain this imperial favor, which precipitated his loss. Informed of this trip, Agrippa dispatched his most faithful freedman to Rome, bearing a letter for the emperor, followed soon after by Agrippa himself. In the letter he accuses Antipas of fomenting a plot with the Parthians and of having accumulated, without informing the emperor, stocks of arms in his arsenals in Tiberias, probably with the intention of preparing his revenge against Aretas who had defeated him a few years earlier. While the second accusation is probably true, the first is doubtful. As a result of the letter, Caligula exiled Antipas to the south of Gaul and Herodias followed. As for Agrippa, he received the territories of Antipas—Galilee and Peraea—as well as all the property confiscated from the Antipas and Herodias.

===Statue of Caligula===

Following the clashes between Jews and Greeks in Alexandria, for confused reasons the delegation led by Philo of Alexandria to Caligula learned &quot;with horror&quot; of the emperor&#x27;s project to erect his own statue in the Temple of Jerusalem in gold under the guise of Zeus. According to Josephus, it is possible that the emperor was sensitive to the arguments of the delegation of Greeks from Alexandria led by Apion who, in the conflict between the two parties, complained of the &quot;privileges&quot; granted to the Jews. For the Jewish historian Goodman, Caligula intended to develop the imperial cult and to place himself above the politics of mortals in his lifetime and had the idea of imposing his divine status on the empire, whatever the political consequences.

Caligula&#x27;s initiative horrified the Jewish subjects of the empire and caused unrest in the diaspora in Rome as well as in Alexandria, Thessaloniki, Antioch and in Judea, particularly in Galilee. Caligula enjoined the proconsul of Syria, Publius Petronius, to place the statue willingly or by force in the &quot;Holy of Holies&quot; of the Temple of Jerusalem, violating Judaic aniconism in the holiest place of this religion. Petronius disposes necessary armed troops—two Roman legions and auxiliaries—which he barracks at Ptolemais in Phoenicia in the event of an uprising, and his mission was to accompany the procession of the statue—being made in Sidon—through Judea. The population rushed in numbers to Ptolemais, supported by the Jewish religious authorities, then to Tiberias where the troubles continued for about 40 days. Petronius met with Aristobulus brother of Agrippa (Agrippa was in Rome at the time) in the presence and under the pressure of the crowd. Convinced of the imminence of a major revolt, Petronius tempered with the emperor by an exchange of letters exposing—at the risk of his life—the difficulties of the situation: the inhabitants of Galilee were close to a revolt, and the Judeans were at risk of setting fire to the crops just before harvesting, while preparing for war. The emperor&#x27;s first response was fairly moderate, but some sources report a “furious” response from Caligula to Petronius, not considering any compromise.
While Agrippa was in Rome it is possible he learned of the affair from Caligula, which plunged him into a conflict between his two identities, Jewish and Roman. After a few days of reflection, he took the side of his Jewish compatriots in the defense of the Temple threatened with desecration: for Josephus, it was a discussion during a banquet; for Philo, it was a request addressed to the emperor, the content of which he reports, although in terms that reveal a certain exaggeration of the role of Agrippa. Agrippa pleaded &quot;that the ancestral institutions are not disturbed. For what of my reputation among my countrymen and other men? Either I must be considered a traitor to myself or I must cease to be counted among your friends; there is no other choice…”.

At first, Caligula seemed to give in to his friend&#x27;s pleas and instructed Petronius to suspend his action towards Jerusalem, while warning the Jewish populations not to take any action against the shrines, statues and altars erected in his honor, as a reproduction of Caligula&#x27;s letter by Josephus seems to attest. But the emperor seemed to reconsider his decision and it was the murder of Caligula that seemed to put a definitive end to the enterprise and put an end to the desire for a popular uprising. Josephus recounts how the emperor, suspecting Petronius of having been bribed to break his orders, ordered him to commit suicide, but this letter arrived after the announcement of Caligula&#x27;s death, in which Josephus saw an effect of Providence. This temporary success of Agrippa testifies to the close relations which bound him with the most important personalities of the Roman world, which was confirmed during the succession of the assassinated emperor.

===Death of Caligula and installation of Claudius===

On January 24, 41, Caligula was assassinated by a large-scale conspiracy, notably involving the praetorian commander Cassius Chaerea as well as several senators. The conspirators intended to return to a republic. Yet it was Claudius, Caligula&#x27;s uncle, who was pushed to imperial power by the anti-republicans under curious conditions at the center of which Agrippa gravitated. Claudius was certainly erudite but nevertheless excessively shy, afflicted with a physical handicap and without particular ambition. The support of his childhood friend, as well as his maneuvers, seem to have been decisive in his ascent to power.

Josephus and Roman historian Cassius Dio both state that Agrippa indeed played a significant role in the choice of the new emperor. It was he who led a squad of the Praetorian Guard to the palace in search of Claudius, who had hidden there for fear of being assassinated. It was also at his instigation that the praetorians proclaimed Claudius emperor because without a sovereign, the guard lost its &quot;raison d&#x27;être&quot;. He then went to the Capitol where the senators met in conclave and acted as intermediaries between them and Claudius. He inspired Claudius with a response to the senators, &quot;in conformity with the dignity of his power,&quot; and he persuaded them to wisely abandon their idea of a republic, arguing that a new emperor has been proclaimed by the praetorians—of whom he pointed out that &#x27;they surround the meeting&quot;—and expected nothing but their enthusiastic support. The senators proclaimed Claudius emperor, and Agrippa recommended that Claudius be lenient vis-à-vis the conspirators, except for the regicides Cassius Chaerea and Lupus.

If these stories are to be believed, this episode made Claudius obligated by his childhood friend, and this devotion earned him a sizeable reward: Agrippa saw his possessions increased by most of the ancient kingdom of Herod Archelaus—Judea, Idumea and Samaria—but also the city of Abila in Anti-Lebanon so that he reigned over a territory as vast as that of his grandfather Herod the Great. According to Cassius Dio, Claudius also granted his friend consular rank and authorized him &quot;to appear in the senate and express his gratitude in Greek&quot;. To mark the considerable status of Agrippa, a treaty was ratified with the Senate and the people of Rome on the Forum, which took up the old treaties of friendship and Judeo-Roman alliance. Agrippa was declared there &quot;rex amicus et socius Populi Romani&quot;—as his grandfather had been in 40 BC.—and the text is preserved on bronze tablets in the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus.

Soon after his inauguration, Agrippa embarked for Judea. It was the same year that Berenice, daughter of Agrippa, united under the patronage of the emperor to Marcus, the son of the alabarch of Alexandria, Alexander Lysimachus whom Claudius had freed from the captivity to which the reduced Caligula. Claudius&#x27; accession to the throne also marked the restoration of several other kingdoms in Asia Minor. Agrippa&#x27;s brother Herod of Chalcis received a royal title, was granted the principality of Chalcis (previously attached to the kingdom of Iturea) and was honored in Rome with the title of praetor. He would marry his niece, Bérénice, after the premature death of her young husband.

===Reign===
====Judaism in the empire====
An edict by Claudius recalls the privileges granted to Alexandrian Jews who lived according to their laws, and a second edict extended the Alexandrian privileges to the Jews of the diaspora throughout the whole empire. Agrippa and his brother Herod of Chalcis played the role of intercessor in favor of the Jews with the emperor. These favors also extended to all the Jewish communities of the empire. They also had the status of censors of Jewish morals: they ensured respect for the Torah by the communities of the diaspora.

A few months after the murder of Caligula, inhabitants of the Phoenician city of Dôra (south of Mount Carmel) introduced a statue of Claudius into the main synagogue of the city. For all those who stood up against Caligula&#x27;s plan to erect his statue in the Temple of Jerusalem, it was a real provocation. Agrippa intervened immediately and asked for the application of the decree of Claudius. He acted here as an ethnarch of the Jews, since Dora was not located on his territory. Petronius, the proconsul of Syria immediately ordered the magistrates of Dora to remove the statue, referring to the edict of Claudius. However, this openness must be put into perspective, which is also reflected in the measures to limit worship against the Jews of Rome, as Cassius Dio reports (History, 60, 6, 6–7), perhaps in reaction to the agitation resulting from the rapid development of the movement of the followers of Jesus and which would be evoked by the Letter of Claudius to the Alexandrians. For François Blanchetière, the writing of Philo Legation to Caïus &quot;constitutes an apology for Augustus, to be read a contrario as a criticism of the Judeophobic policy of Claudius (Legation to Caius 155–158)&quot;.

====Administration of the kingdom====
Claudius probably saw in the appointment of Agrippa—heir to the Herodians and the Hasmoneans but also attached to the Julio-Claudians by personal relations—a factor of stability which could rid the imperial administration of the management of a province with endemic troubles.

Agrippa clearly inherited his grandfather&#x27;s splendor and his desire for recognition beyond his borders. Internally, he tried to satisfy both his Jewish and pagan subjects and was divided between his religious capital, Jerusalem, and his &quot;little Rome&quot;, Caesarea. He also undertook the major project of raising the ramparts of his historic capital and extending it to the northern district thanks to funding from the Temple treasury, which gave some of his Jewish subjects hope for the restoration of an independent kingdom. or at least a rediscovered form of sovereignty. He continued the policy of euergetism external to Judea of Herod the Great by financing the construction of prestigious works (theatre, amphitheater and baths) in liberalities which mainly benefited the Roman colony of Berytus, without forgetting however the cities of Phoenicia and Syria. He also offered shows and games, notably with gladiators, even if this contravened Jewish prescriptions, which he got accepted by using condemned criminals.

On a religious level, as soon as he arrived, Agrippa forged the reputation of a pious man whom he knew how to maintain, as attested by the Mishnah, which recounts an orchestrated ceremony where the king was acclaimed and obtained the legitimacy of the priests in the Temple of Jerusalem while his grandfather Herod had never been admitted to the third court of the Temple. However, through his grandmother, Mariamne the Hasmonean, Agrippa belonged to a priestly family, which Herod did not. He was thus the first Herodo-Hasmonean to participate in a Temple office since the dismissal of the Antigonus II Mattathias, although he did not offer sacrifices.

The Mishnah explains how the Jews of the Second Temple era interpreted the requirement of that the king should read the Torah to the people. At the conclusion of the first day of Sukkot immediately after the conclusion of the seventh year in the cycle, they erected a wooden dais in the Temple court, upon which the king sat. The synagogue attendant took a Torah scroll and handed it to the synagogue president, who handed it to the High Priest&#x27;s deputy, who handed it to the High Priest, who handed it to the king. The king stood and received it, and was to read while seated. King Agrippa stood and received it and read standing, and the sages praised him for doing so. When Agrippa reached the commandment of that &quot;you may not put a foreigner over you&quot; as king, his eyes ran with tears, but they said to him, &quot;Don&#x27;t fear, Agrippa, you are our brother, you are our brother!&quot; The king read from up through the shema (), and then the portion regarding tithes (), the portion of the king (), and the blessings and curses (). The king would recite the same blessings as the High Priest, except that the king would substitute a blessing for the festivals instead of one for the forgiveness of sin. (Mishnah Sotah 7:8; Babylonian Talmud Sotah 41a.)

Agrippa used his prerogative to appoint the high priests of the Temple three times during his short reign, choosing alternately from the priestly dynasties of the Anan and the Boethos. His short administration was thus placed under the domination of Rome, of which he was an instrument of control, and the marks of honor given as sovereign by the Jews to the Temple testify to the &quot;generalized clientelism in which personal friendships administrative relations throughout the empire.

===Regional ambitions and unexpected death===

Gaius Vibius Marsus, the governor of Syria who succeeded Petronius, was much less favorable to Agrippa. He sent a series of letters to Claudius to express his fears of Agrippa&#x27;s rising power, reflecting the jealousy of the prince&#x27;s Roman compatriots in the region. For his part, Agrippa repeatedly asked the emperor to dismiss Marsus.

Marsus interrupted, on the orders of Claudius, the fortification of Jerusalem and tempered the regional diplomatic ambitions of Agrippa. Indeed, Agrippa invited to Tiberias Herod of Chalcis as well as three princes who had been his companions in Rome, Antiochos of Commagene, Cotys of Lesser Armenia and Polemon, king of Pontus. Marsus argued the possibility of a conspiracy. Although it is unlikely that Agrippa considered breaking with his close Roman protectors and familiars, the kings were enjoined to return to their respective kingdoms without delay.
Agrippa died unexpectedly in 44, after only three years of reign over Judea, during the games of Caesarea in honor of the emperor. Patronizing the games, he appeared there in dazzling silver finery in front of the crowd who acclaimed him and compared him to a god, a blasphemous remark for a Jew against which the king did not then protest. Some of his contemporaries read as a divine punishment for this blasphemy the cause of his death which occurred shortly after: according to the Acts of the Apostles which appears in the New Testament, an angel, come at the time of the declarations of the people who compared him to a god, struck him, and he was devoured by worms (Acts 12:20–23). Two days later, he was seized with violent abdominal pains and died after five days of agony, at age 53. According to Josephus, before he died he scolded his friends for flattering him, and he accepted his imminent death in a state of teshuva. The precise causes of his death are unknown, but from that time on rumors of poisoning circulated. Several researchers believe that the poisoning by the Romans worried about his excessive political ambitions is likely, even that it was a personal initiative of Marsus to attenuate the hostility of the neighboring Syrian populations.

The reign of Agrippa I thus did not last long enough to be able to significantly outline its political orientation. Nevertheless, the hopes of regained sovereignty aroused among the Jews of Judea by his accession did not disappear with his death and were probably part of the causes that led to the Jewish revolt which broke out some 20 years later.

==Succession==

The death of Agrippa was celebrated by the pagan populations of the kingdom, in particular in Caesarea and Sebaste, which the sovereign had nevertheless largely favored. The hostility of the Syrian population was also evident in attacks by Syrian auxiliaries on statues of the king&#x27;s daughters adorning the palace of Caesarea.

Rather than entrusting Agrippa&#x27;s kingdom to his son Agrippa II—an inexperienced young man who grew up at the imperial court, protected by the emperor—Claudius made it a Roman province with Cuspius Fadus as procurator. This decision, along with the unruly conduct of the Syrian auxiliaries, generated renewed unrest in Caesarea and elsewhere. The appointment of the priests and the control of the Temple of Jerusalem passed to Herod of Chalcis, who also became the foremost intermediary between the Jews and the Romans until his death in 48. For the Jews, these events marked the end of hopes for even a symbolic Jewish independence, and it was then that intransigent factious movements with messianic and anti-Roman connotations appeared.

From his union with Cypros, Agrippa had four children reaching adulthood: a son Agrippa and three daughters, Berenice, Mariamne and Drusilla. Another son, Drusus, died in infancy.

==Posterity==

Half a century after Agrippa&#x27;s sudden death, Josephus evokes the sovereign in these terms: &quot;Agrippa&#x27;s character was gentle and his benevolence was equal for all. He was full of humanity for people of foreign races and also showed them his liberality, but he was also helpful for his compatriots and showed them even more sympathy&quot;. Josephus gives Agrippa a positive legacy and relates that he was known in his time as &quot;Agrippa the Great&quot;. In the rabbinical sources, Agrippa is presented as a pious man, and his reign is described positively. Conversely, the pagan inhabitants of Caesarea and Sebaste organized rejoicings at his death.

A significant number of critics follow the Christian tradition to identify Agrippa with &quot;Herod the king&quot; who, in the Acts of the Apostles, persecutes the community of Jesus&#x27; disciples in Jerusalem, then who has James the Great killed &quot;with the sword&quot; while the apostle Peter, later arrested, owes his salvation only to the help of &quot;an angel&quot; who comes by night to help him escape from his prison. However, the Acts of the Apostles, composed in the 80s and 90s from several sources, &quot;have been the subject of devastating criticism for several decades, to the point of being denied by some, in whole or in part, any historical value&quot; due to the &quot;editorial activity&quot; of its three successive authors. Thus, the entire Petrine document (hypothetical document) to which these episodes would have belonged seems to have been placed at the beginning of Acts by its first writer, following this account by the &quot;Gesture of Paul&quot; and it is the next writer—perhaps Luke the Evangelist—which would have been inserted between the two &quot;Gestures&quot; of Peter and Paul, the account of the death of Agrippa which gives the impression that all that precedes is dated before 44 and all that follows is later, adding a coming of Paul to Jerusalem which does not appear anywhere in Paul&#x27;s accounts in his epistles. It is therefore possible that &quot;Herod the king&quot; does not designate Agrippa I, but his son Agrippa II. Indeed, in addition to these editorial elements, the chronological inconsistencies of the Acts have been well known for more than a century, in particular the speech of Gamaliel, delivered seven chapters before the account of the death of Agrippa to defend the apostles during a previous arrest, speaks of the death of Theudas intervened under the procurator Cuspius Fadus (44–46) and in the Gesture of Peter, the murder of James the Great, then the arrest and escape of Peter are later of five chapters to this speech and precedes the account of the death of Agrippa. This account of the death of Agrippa, probably inserted by the second redactor of the Acts of the Apostles diverges from that of Josephus but otherwise agrees with him on the divine origin of his mortal illness, occasioned by his impious refusal to reject the deification of which he is the object by the people, perhaps testifying to the use of a common Jewish source.

==Family tree==




==Portrayals==
Herod Agrippa is the protagonist of the Italian opera &quot;L’Agrippa tetrarca di Gerusalemme&quot; with music by Giuseppe Maria Buini and libretto by Claudio Nicola Stampa, first performed August 28, 1724 at the Teatro Ducale of Milan. Agrippa is a major figure in the Robert Graves novel &quot;Claudius the God&quot;, as well as the BBC television adaptation &quot;I, Claudius&quot;, portrayed by James Faulkner as an adult and Michael Clements as a child. As Graves depicts Herod, he is a lifelong friend of Claudius, his most lasting and trustworthy advisor. Herod ultimately betrays their trust, raising a rebellion against Rome as the prophesied Messiah, much to the dismay of Claudius. Herod is struck down by unexplained illness, sending a final letter to Claudius seeking forgiveness.

<text>Herod Agrippa II (; AD 27/28 – or 100), officially named Marcus Julius Agrippa and sometimes shortened to Agrippa, was the last ruler from the Herodian dynasty, reigning over territories outside of Judea as a Roman client. Agrippa II fled Jerusalem in 66, fearing the Jewish uprising, and he supported the Roman side in the First Jewish–Roman War.

==Early life==
Herod Agrippa II was the son of the first and better-known Herod Agrippa and the brother of Berenice, Mariamne, and Drusilla (second wife of the Roman procurator Antonius Felix). He was educated at the court of the emperor Claudius, and at the time of his father&#x27;s death he was 17 years old. Claudius therefore kept him at Rome and sent Cuspius Fadus as procurator of the Roman province of Judaea. While at Rome, he voiced his support for the Jews to Claudius and against the Samaritans and the procurator of Iudaea Province, Ventidius Cumanus, who was thought to have been the cause of some disturbances there.

==Rise in power==
On the death of king Herod of Chalcis in 48, his small Syrian realm of Chalcis was given to Agrippa, with the right of superintending the Temple in Jerusalem and appointing its high priest, but only as a tetrarch.

In 53, Agrippa was forced to give up the tetrarchy of Chalcis, but in exchange Claudius made him ruler with the title of king over the territories previously governed by Philip—Iturea, Trachonitis, Batanea, Gaulanitis, Auranitis and Paneas—as well as the kingdom of Lysanias in Abila. The tetrarchy of Chalcis was subsequently in 57 given to his cousin Aristobulus (). Agrippa celebrated by marrying off his two sisters Mariamne and Drusilla. Josephus, the Jewish historian, repeats the gossip that Agrippa lived in an incestuous relationship with his sister Berenice.

In 55, the Emperor Nero added to Agrippa&#x27;s realm the cities of Tiberias and Taricheae in Galilee, and Livias (Iulias), with 14 villages near it, in Peraea. It was before Agrippa and Berenice that, according to the New Testament, Paul the Apostle pleaded his case at Caesarea Maritima, probably in 59 or 60 ().

Agrippa expended large sums in beautifying Jerusalem and other cities, especially Berytus (ancient Beirut), a Hellenised city in Phoenicia. His partiality for the latter rendered him unpopular amongst his own subjects, and the capricious manner in which he appointed and deposed the high priests made him disliked by the Jews.
==Jewish–Roman War==
In the 17th year of Agrippa&#x27;s reign (corresponding with the 12th year of Nero&#x27;s reign, or 65/66 AD), Agrippa tried desperately to avert a war with Rome, when he saw his countrymen generally disposed to fight against Rome because of insults and abuses they had been facing under the Roman procurator, Gessius Florus. At this time, they had broken off the cloisters leading from Antonia Fortress to the Temple Mount where Roman soldiers went to keep guard during the Jewish holidays, and they refused to pay the due tribute to Rome. Agrippa convened the people and urged them to tolerate the temporary injustices done to them and submit themselves to Roman hegemony. At length, Agrippa failed to prevent his subjects from rebelling, whereas, during a certain holiday when the Roman governor of Syria, Cestius Gallus, had passed through Judea to quell the rebellion, he was routed by Jewish forces. By 66 the citizenry of Jerusalem expelled Agrippa and Berenice from Jerusalem. 

During the First Jewish–Roman War of 66–73, he sent 2,000 men, archers and cavalry, to support Roman general Vespasian, showing that, although a Jew, he was entirely devoted to the Roman Empire. He accompanied Vespasian&#x27;s son Titus on part of his campaigns against the rebels and was wounded at the siege of Gamla. After the capture of Jerusalem, he went with Berenice to Rome, where he was invested with the dignity of praetor and rewarded with additional territory.

===Relations with Josephus===
Agrippa had a great intimacy with the historian Josephus, having supplied him with information for his history, &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot;. Josephus preserved two of the letters he received from him.

==Death==
According to the patriarch Photius I of Constantinople, Agrippa died childless at age 70, in the third year of the reign of Trajan, that is, 100, but statements of Josephus, in addition to the contemporary epigraphy from his kingdom, cast this date into serious doubt. The modern scholarly consensus holds that he died before 93/94. He was the last ruler from the House of Herod.

<doc id="68604" wikidata="Q1370497" url="?curid=68604" title="Ahasuerus">
<text>Ahasuerus ( ; , &quot;Achashverosh&quot;; , in the Septuagint; in the Vulgate) is a name applied in the Hebrew Bible to three rulers of Ancient Persia and to a Babylonian official (or Median king) first appearing in the Tanakh in the Book of Esther and later in the Book of Tobit. It is a transliteration of either Xerxes I or Artaxerxes I; both are names of multiple Achaemenid dynasty Persian kings.

==Etymology==
The Hebrew form is believed to have derived from the Old Persian name of Xerxes I, &quot;Xšayāršā&quot; (&lt; &quot;xšaya&quot; &#x27;king&#x27; + &quot;aršan&quot; &#x27;male&#x27; &gt; &#x27;king of all male; Hero among Kings&#x27;). That became Babylonian &quot;Aḫšiyâršu&quot; (, &quot;aḫ-ši-ia-ar-šu&quot;) and then &quot;Akšîwâršu&quot; (, &quot;ak-ši-i-wa6-ar-šu&quot;) and was borrowed as and thence into Latin as &quot;Ahasuerus&quot;, the form traditionally used in English Bibles. The Persian name was independently rendered in Ancient Greek as &quot;Xérxēs&quot;. Many newer English translations and paraphrases of the Bible have used the name Xerxes.

==Book of Esther==
&quot;Ahasuerus&quot; is given as the name of a king, the husband of Esther, in the &quot;Book of Esther&quot;. He is said to have &quot;ruled over a hundred and twenty-seven provinces from India to Nubia&quot; – that is, over the Achaemenid Empire. Some consider the narrative of &quot;Esther&quot; was to provide an aetiology for Purim, and that the name Ahasuerus is usually understood to refer to Xerxes I, who ruled the Achaemenid Empire between 486 and 465 BC. Outside of the book of Esther, history records that Xerxes was married to Amestris, not Vashti or Esther. Moreover, it is understood that Persian kings did not marry outside a restricted number of Persian noble families. In the Septuagint, the &quot;Book of Esther&quot; refers to the king as &#x27;Artaxerxes&#x27;, who was the younger son of Xerxes ().

===Identification of &quot;Ahasuerus&quot; as Xerxes I===

Numerous scholars have proposed theories as to who Ahasuerus represents. Most scholars today identify him with Xerxes I, as did 19th-century Bible commentaries. Three factors, among others, contribute to this identification:

# It is believed the Hebrew &#x27;Ahasuerus&#x27; descended from the Persian names for Xerxes I.
# Historian Herodotus describes Xerxes I as being susceptible to women and in the habit of making extravagant offers to them, just as he did to Esther (&quot;up to half my kingdom&quot;). Herodotus mentions that the Persian empire stretched from India to Ethiopia and also refers to the magnificent royal palace in Shushan (Susa), corroboration of what is stated in the Book of Esther. In addition Herodotus mentions an assembly of Persian nobles called by Xerxes to advise him on the proposed war against Greece. Although Herodotus does not give the location of this assembly, the date – &quot;after Egypt was subdued&quot; – corresponds to Xerxes&#x27; third year when Esther records an assembly of Persian nobility at a feast. (&quot;Histories&quot; VII.8) Herodotus also mentions that following his defeat at Salamis Xerxes I became involved in harem intrigues involving his wife Amestris and his daughter-in-law, with whom he became enamoured. (Histories IX.108) Herodotus relates this occurred in the tenth month of his seventh year as king – the same time Ahasuerus was choosing beautiful women for his harem (Esther 2:16).
# Annals from the reign of Xerxes I mention an otherwise unattested official by the name of &quot;Marduka&quot;, which some have proposed refers to Mordecai, as both are mentioned serving in the king&#x27;s court.

===Identification of &quot;Ahasuerus&quot; as Artaxerxes I===
While today the king of Esther is usually identified as Xerxes I, the ancient traditions identify him with his son, Artaxerxes I. The Septuagint, the Vulgate, the Midrash of &quot;Esther Rabbah&quot;, I, 3, and the &quot;Josippon&quot; identify him as Artaxerxes. Many historians and exegetes from ancient times and the middle ages also identified Ahasuerus with Artaxerxes I, including, most notably, Josephus, who relates that &quot;Artaxerxes&quot; was the name by which he was known to the Greeks. The Ethiopic text calls him &quot;Arťeksis&quot;, usually the Ethiopic equivalent of &quot;Artaxerxes&quot;.

===Identification of &quot;Ahasuerus&quot; as Artaxerxes II===
Some have speculated that the king was Artaxerxes II. In his &quot;Chronography&quot;, the 13th century Syriac historian Bar Hebraeus also identifies Ahasuerus as Artaxerxes II citing the sixth century AD historian John of Ephesus. Plutarch in his &quot;Lives&quot; (AD 75) records alternative names &quot;Oarses&quot; and &quot;Arsicas&quot; for Artaxerxes II Mnemon given by Deinon (c. 360–340 BC) and Ctesias (Artexerxes II&#x27;s physician) respectively. These derive from the Persian name &quot;Khshayarsha&quot; as do &quot;Ahasuerus&quot; (&quot;(Arta)Xerxes&quot;) and the hypocorism &quot;Arshu&quot; for Artaxerxes II found on a contemporary inscription (&quot;LBAT&quot; 162). These sources thus arguably identify Ahasuerus as Artaxerxes II in light of the names used in the Hebrew and Greek sources and accords with the contextual information from Pseudo-Hecataeus and Berossus as well as agreeing with Al-Tabari and Masudi&#x27;s placement of events.

==Book of Ezra==

Ahasuerus is also given as the name of a King of Persia in the Book of Ezra. Modern commentators associate him with Xerxes I who reigned from 486 to 465 BC. Other identifications have been made for Cambyses II or with Bardiya (Greek &quot;Smerdis&quot;) who reigned (perhaps as an imposter) for seven months between Cambyses II and Darius I.

==Book of Daniel==

Ahasuerus is given as the name of the father of Darius the Mede in the &quot;Book of Daniel&quot;. Josephus names Astyages as the father of Darius the Mede, and the description of the latter as uncle and father-in-law of Cyrus by mediaeval Jewish commentators matches that of Cyaxares II, who is said to be the son of Astyages by Xenophon. Thus this Ahasuerus is commonly identified with Astyages. He is alternatively identified, together with the Ahasuerus of the Book of Tobit, as Cyaxares I, said to be the father of Astyages. Views differ on how to reconcile the sources in this case. One view is that the description of Ahasuerus as the &quot;father&quot; of Darius the Mede should be understood in the broader sense of &quot;forebear&quot; or &quot;ancestor&quot;. Another view notes that on the Behistun Inscription, &quot;Cyaxares&quot; is a family name, and thus considers the description as literal, viewing Astyages as an intermediate ruler wrongly placed in the family line in the Greek sources.

Most scholars view Darius the Mede as a literary fiction, or possibly a conflation of Darius the Great with prophecies about the Medes.

==Book of Tobit==
In some versions of the deuterocanonical &quot;Book of Tobit&quot;, Ahasuerus is given as the name of an associate of Nebuchadnezzar, who, together with him, destroyed Nineveh just before Tobit&#x27;s death. A traditional Catholic view is that he is identical to the Ahasuerus of Daniel 9:1 In the Codex Sinaiticus Greek (LXX) edition, the two names in this verse appear instead as one name, Ahikar (also the name of another character in the story of Tobit). Other Septuagint texts have the name &quot;Achiachar&quot;. Western scholars have proposed that &quot;Achiachar&quot; is a variant form of the name &quot;Cyaxares I of Media&quot;, who historically did destroy Nineveh, in 612 BC.

==In legends==
In some versions of the legend of the Wandering Jew, his true name is held to be Ahasuerus – even though the biblical king is not described as a Jew and nothing in the Biblical account of him is similar to that myth. This is the name by which Immanuel Kant refers to the Wandering Jew in &quot;The Only Possible Argument in Support of a Demonstration of the Existence of God&quot;.

<text>Ahaz (; &quot;Akhaz&quot;; ) an abbreviation of Jehoahaz II (of Judah), &quot;Yahweh has held&quot; (; &quot;Ya&#x27;úḫazi&quot; [&quot;ia-ú-ḫa-zi&quot;]) was the twelfth king of Judah, and the son and successor of Jotham. Ahaz was 20 when he became king of Judah and reigned for 16 years.

Ahaz is portrayed as an evil king in the Second Book of Kings (2 Kings 16:2).

In Edwin R. Thiele&#x27;s opinion, Ahaz was co-regent with Jotham from 736/735 BC, and his sole reign began in 732/731 and ended in 716/715 BC. However, William F. Albright has dated his reign to 744–728 BC.

The Gospel of Matthew lists Ahaz of Judah in the genealogy of Jesus. He is also mentioned in Isaiah 7 and .

==Reign==
Ahaz&#x27;s reign commenced at the age of 20, in the 17th year of the reign of Pekah of Israel. It is described in ; ; and .

===Destruction of Northern Kingdom===
Immediately upon his accession, Ahaz had to meet a coalition formed by northern Israel, under Pekah, and Damascus (Syria), under Rezin. These kings wished to compel him to join them in opposing the Assyrians, who were arming a force against the Northern Kingdom under Tiglath-Pileser III (Pul). Isaiah counsels Ahaz to trust in God rather than foreign allies, and tells him to ask for a sign to confirm that this is a true prophecy (verse 7:11). Ahaz refuses, saying he will not test God (7:12). Isaiah replies that Ahaz will have a sign whether he asks for it or not, and the sign will be the birth of a child, and the child&#x27;s mother will call it Immanuel, meaning &quot;God-with-us&quot; (7:13–14).

To protect himself Ahaz called in the aid of the Assyrians. Tiglath-Pileser sacked Damascus and annexed Aram. According to , the population of Aram was deported and Rezin executed. Tiglath-Pileser then attacked Israel and &quot;took Ijon, Abel Beth Maacah, Janoah, Kedesh and Hazor. He took Gilead and Galilee, including all the land of Naphtali, and deported the people to Assyria.&quot; Tiglath-Pileser also records this act in one of his inscriptions.

Through Assyria&#x27;s intervention, and as a result of its invasion and subjection of the kingdom of Damascus and the Kingdom of Israel, Ahaz was relieved of his troublesome neighbors; but his protector henceforth claimed and held suzerainty over his kingdom. This war of invasion lasted two years (734–732 BC), and ended in the capture and annexation of Damascus to Assyria and of the territory of Israel north of the border of Jezreel. Ahaz in the meanwhile furnished auxiliaries to Tiglath-Pileser. This appeal to Assyria met with stern opposition from the prophet Isaiah, who counseled Ahaz to rely upon the Lord and not upon outside aid. Ahaz, during his whole reign, was free from troubles with which the neighboring rulers were harassed, who from time to time revolted against Assyria. Thus it was that, in 722, Samaria was taken and northern Israel wholly incorporated into the Assyrian empire.

===Religious observance===
Ahaz yielded readily to the glamour and prestige of the Assyrians in religion as well as in politics. In 732, he went to Damascus to swear homage to Tiglath-Pileser and his gods; and, taking a fancy to an altar which he saw there, he had one like it made in Jerusalem, which, with a corresponding change in ritual, he made a permanent feature of the Temple worship. Changes were also made in the arrangements and furniture of the Temple, &quot;because of the king of Assyria&quot; (). Furthermore, Ahaz fitted up an astrological observatory with accompanying sacrifices, after the fashion of the ruling people. In other ways Ahaz lowered the character of the national worship.

 records that Ahaz offered his son by fire to Moloch (or &quot;made his son pass through fire&quot;), a practice condemned by . The words may refer to a ceremony of purification or a sacrificial offering. The account in refers to &quot;sons&quot; (plural).

His government is considered by the Deuteronomistic historian as having been disastrous for the religious state of the country, and a large part of the reforming work of his son Hezekiah was aimed at undoing the evil that Ahaz had done.

==Succession==
He died at the age of 36 and was succeeded by his son, Hezekiah. Because of his wickedness he was &quot;not brought into the sepulchre of the kings&quot; (). An insight into Ahaz&#x27;s neglect of the worship of the Lord is found in the statement that on the first day of the month of Nisan that followed Ahaz&#x27;s death, his son Hezekiah commissioned the priests and Levites to open and repair the doors of the Temple and to remove the defilements of the sanctuary, a task which took 16 days.

==Rabbinic literature==
According to the Talmudic rabbis, who refer to II Chron. xxviii. 19–25, Ahaz was the king who persisted in his wickedness even in the face of all the trials to which he was subjected, and would not repent (Sanh. 103a, Meg. 11a). Worse than this, he threatened Israel&#x27;s religion to its very foundation, in order to destroy all hope of regeneration. He closed the schools and houses of worship so that no instruction should be possible, and the Shekinah (or Glory of God) should abandon the land. It was for this reason that Isaiah had to teach in secret (Yer. Sanh. x. 28b; Gen. R. xlii.), though Ahaz always humbly submitted to the prophet&#x27;s rebukes—his only redeeming feature (Sanh. 104a). Abi saved the life of her son Hezekiah, whom her godless husband, Ahaz, had designed as an offering to Moloch. By anointing him with the blood of the salamander, she enabled him to pass through the fire of Moloch unscathed (Sanh. 63b).

==Chronological notes==
There has been considerable academic debate about the actual dates of reigns of the Israelite kings. Scholars have endeavored to synchronize the chronology of events referred to in the Bible with those derived from other external sources.

The calendars for reckoning the years of kings in Judah and Israel were offset by six months, that of Judah starting in Tishri (in the fall) and that of Israel in Nisan (in the spring). Cross-synchronizations between the two kingdoms therefore often allow narrowing of the beginning and/or ending dates of a king to within a six-month range. For Ahaz, the Scriptural data allow dating the beginning of his coregency with Jotham to some time in the six-month interval beginning of Nisan 1 of 735 BC. By the Judean calendar that started the regnal year in Tishri (a fall month), this could be written as 736/735, or more simply 736 BC. His father was removed from responsibility by the pro-Assyrian faction at some time in the year that started in Tishri of 732 BC. He died some time between Tishri 1 of 716 BC and Nisan 1 of 715 BC, i.e. in 716/715, or more simply 716 BC.

Rodger Young offers a possible explanation of why four extra years are assigned to Jotham in and why Ahaz&#x27;s 16-year reign () is measured from the time of Jotham&#x27;s death in 732/731, instead of when Jotham was deposed in 736/735. Taking into account the factionalism of the time, Young writes:

[A]ny record such as that recognized these last four years for Jotham must have come from the annals of the anti-Assyrian and anti-Ahaz court that prevailed after the death of Ahaz. Ahaz is given sixteen years in these annals, measuring from the start of his sole reign, instead of the twenty or twenty-one years that he would be credited with if the counting started from 736t [i.e. 736/735 BC], when he deposed Jotham.




==Surviving artifacts==

In the mid-1990s a bulla appeared on the antiquities market. This bulla measures wide. The back of the bulla bears the imprint of the papyrus it once sealed, as well as the double string which held it together. It contains a fingerprint on the left edge. Like many bullae, it was preserved due to being baked by fire, presumably incidentally (house or city was burned), as in a kiln. The inscription reads: &quot;Belonging to Ahaz (son of) Yehotam, King of Judah.&quot; Given the process that created and preserved bullae, they are virtually impossible to forge, so most scholars believe this bulla to be authentic. It bears the seal of King Ahaz of Judah, who ruled from 732 to 716 BC.

An orange carnelian scaraboid seal dating to the 8th century BC also mentions Ahaz. Its inscription reads, &quot;Belonging to Ushna servant of Ahaz.&quot; While Ushna is unknown, the seal refers to Ahaz, king of Judah, who is mentioned in 2 Kings 16. This artifact is currently part of the Yale University&#x27;s collection of ancient seals.

Another important source regarding the historicity of Ahaz comes from the Tiglath-Pileser III annals, mentioning tributes and payments he received from Ahaz, king of Judah and Menahem, king of Israel. Furthermore, in 2015, Eilat Mazar discovered a royal bulla of the Judean king Hezekiah, biblical son of Ahaz, that reads &quot;Belonging to Hezekiah [son of] Ahaz king of Judah&quot;, and dates to between 727 and 698 BC.

# Son of Ahitub (1 Sam. 14:3, 18), Ichabod&#x27;s brother; the same probably as Ahimelech, who was High Priest at Nob in the reign of Saul (1 Sam. 22:11) and at Shiloh, where the Tabernacle was set up. Some, however, suppose that Ahimelech was the brother of Ahijah, and that they both officiated as high priests, Ahijah at Gibeah or Kirjath-jearim, and Ahimelech at Nob.
# Father of King Baasha of Israel

A man named Ahijah also appears in the Babylonian Talmud in the 2nd century AD as one of the first Babylonian Exilarchs.

<text>Ahikam (Hebrew: אחיקם, &quot;My brother has risen&quot;) was one of the five whom, according to the Hebrew Bible, Josiah sent to consult the prophetess Huldah in connection with the discovery of the book of the law.

==Biblical accounts==
He was the son of Shaphan, the royal secretary, and the father of Gedaliah, governor of Judea after the destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonians. 

On one occasion, in a move described by Jonathan Magonet as taking the prophet into &#x27;protective custody&#x27;, he protected Jeremiah against the fury of Jehoiakim (Jeremiah 26:24) It was in the chamber of another son (Gemariah) of Shaphan that Baruch read Jeremiah&#x27;s scroll in the hearing of all the people.

<text>Ahimaaz ( &quot;ʾĂḥīmaʿaṣ&quot;, &quot;My Brother Is Counselor&quot;) was son of the high priest Zadok.

He first appears in the reign of King David (reigned c. 1000-962 BCE). During Absalom&#x27;s revolt he remained faithful to David, and, along with Jonathan, son of Abiathar, assisted him by giving him news about the proceedings of Absalom in Jerusalem (2 Samuel 15:24–37; 17:15–21). He was a swift runner, and was the first to bring David news of the defeat of Absalom, although he refrained from mentioning his death (2 Samuel 18:19–33).

Under King Solomon (c. 970–930 BCE), Ahimaaz&#x27;s father Zadok became high priest. When Zadok died, Ahimaaz succeeded him in that position (1 Chronicles 6:8, 53).

He may have been the same Ahimaaz who took as wife Basemath, one of Solomon&#x27;s daughters (1 Kings 4:15). Subsequent kings of Israel, Ahaz, also married daughters of the high priest.

<text>Ahimelech ( &quot;ʾĂḥīmeleḵ&quot;, &quot;my brother is king&quot;/&quot;brother of a king&quot;) was an Israelite priest and served as the grand priest of the town of Nob. In the Book of Samuel, he was described as the son of Ahitub and father of Abiathar (), but described as the son of Abiathar in and in four places in 1 Chronicles. He descended from Aaron&#x27;s son Ithamar and the High Priest of Israel Eli. In his name is Abimelech according to the Masoretic Text, and is probably the same as Ahiah ().

==Relation to David== 
He was the twelfth High Priest, and officiated at Nob, where he was visited by David (he gave David and his companions five loaves of the showbread) when David fled from Saul (). He was summoned into Saul&#x27;s presence, and accused of disloyalty for assisting David, on the information of Doeg the Edomite. Then the king commanded that he, with the other priests who stood beside him, 86 in all, should be slain with his family. This sentence was carried into execution by Doeg in a cruel manner (). Possibly Abiathar had a son also called Ahimelech, or the two names, as some think, may have been accidentally transposed in ; , marg.; 24:3, 6, 31.

==Interpretation==
Ahimelech&#x27;s death was seen as a partial fulfilment of the curse on the House of Eli – that none of Eli&#x27;s male descendants would live to old age; the other part of the curse on the House of Eli – that the priesthood would pass out of his descendants (1 Samuel 2:)– was fulfilled when Abiathar was deposed from the office of High Priest. Rabbinical literature linked the extermination of the male descendants of David with the extermination of the priests of Nob by Saul - deeming it divine retribution because David&#x27;s action had provoked Saul&#x27;s outburst - and also linked the survival of David&#x27;s descendant Joash with that of Ahimelech&#x27;s son Abiathar.

<text>Ahinoam ( &quot;ʾăḥīnōʿam&quot;) is a Hebrew name literally meaning &quot;brother of pleasantness&quot;, or &quot;my brother is pleasant&quot;, thus meaning &quot;pleasant&quot;.

There are two references in the Bible to people; who bear that name;
*A daughter of Ahimaaz; who became a wife of Saul and the mother of his five sons and two daughters, one of whom is Michal, David&#x27;s first wife.
*A woman from Jezreel, who became David&#x27;s second wife, after he fled from Saul, leaving Michal, his first wife, behind, and the mother of Amnon, David&#x27;s first-born.

== Context ==
Some scholars suggest that the two may be, in fact, one person. In 2 Samuel 12:8, God tells David through the prophet Nathan, &quot;I gave your master&#x27;s house to you, and your master&#x27;s wives into your arms.&quot; Jon Levenson suggests that this implies David took Ahinoam from Saul. However, Diana V. Edelman disagrees, &quot;Such a presumption would require David to have run off with the queen mother while Saul was still on the throne, which seems unlikely. In view of the possession of the royal harem as a claim to royal legitimacy, Nathan&#x27;s comment can be related to David&#x27;s eventual possession of Saul&#x27;s wives after he ascended the throne in the wake of Eshbaal&#x27;s death...&quot;

Levenson goes on to note that Ahinoam is always mentioned before Abigail and that she bears David a son before Abigail does, and concludes from this that &quot;she was already married to David when the conflict with Nabal erupted.&quot; When David had fled from Saul and dwelt with Achish, king of Gath, he had his two wives Ahinoam and Abigail with him as per 1 Samuel 27:3.

Adherents of source criticism suggest that references to a woman called &quot;Ahinoam&quot; being Saul&#x27;s wife belong to the account of the &quot;republican source&quot; of the Books of Samuel, while in the passages ascribed to the &quot;monarchial source&quot;, the only mention of a woman called &quot;Ahinoam&quot; is the description of her as a wife of David.

Since Ahinoam&#x27;s name usually precedes that of Abigail, it has been suggested that David married Ahinoam before he married Abigail. However, if her son Amnon was David&#x27;s firstborn son, then the order of their names might indicate Ahinoam&#x27;s status as the crown prince&#x27;s mother. Ahinoam is with David during his stay with King Achish of Gath, and is taken captive when Amalekites raid Ziklag, David&#x27;s Philistine base, but was recovered by David. She is among those who go with David to Hebron when he becomes king over Judah (2 Sam 2:2).

Additionally, Leviticus 20:14 forbids men from marrying their mothers-in-law, and Ahinoam, wife of Saul, was the mother of David&#x27;s first wife Michal, whom David considered to legally be his wife even after fleeing, and David was never indicted by any prophets for his marriage to Ahinoam.

<text>Ahitophel, Achitofel, or Ahithophel () was a counselor of King David and a man greatly renowned for his wisdom. During Absalom&#x27;s attempt to usurp the throne, he deserted David and supported Absalom, whom he then turned to as an advisor. To counteract Ahitophel&#x27;s counsel, the fleeing David sent his friend Hushai back to Absalom. Seeing that his advice against David had not been followed due to Hushai&#x27;s influence, Ahithophel surmised that the revolt would fail, returned to his hometown of Giloh, and hanged himself. He was buried in &quot;the sepulcher of his fathers&quot;.

A man named Ahitophel is also mentioned in 2 Samuel 23:34, and he is said to be the father of Eliam. Since 2 Samuel 11:3 notes that Eliam is the father of Bathsheba, some scholars suggest that the Ahitophel of 2 Samuel 15 may be Bathsheba&#x27;s grandfather. Levenson and Baruch Halpern, for example, note that &quot;the narrator is sufficiently subtle (or guileless) to have Bathsheba&#x27;s grandfather ... instigate the exaction of YHWH&#x27;s pound of flesh,&quot; as Nathan&#x27;s curse in 2 Samuel 12:11 comes to fruition.

==In Rabbinical literature==

The Talmud speaks of this counsellor of David as &quot;a man, like Balaam, whose great wisdom was not received in humility as a gift from heaven, and so became a stumbling block to him.&quot; He was &quot;one of those who, while casting longing eyes upon things not belonging to them, also lose the things they possess.&quot; Accordingly, Ahithophel was granted access by Almighty God into the Divine powers of God. And being thus familiar with Divine wisdom and knowledge as imparted through the Holy Spirit, he was consulted as an oracle like the Urim and Thummim. &quot;..and great as was his wisdom, it was equalled by his scholarship. Therefore, David did not hesitate to submit himself to his instruction, even though Ahithophel was a very young
man at his death, not more than thirty-three years old. The one thing lacking in him was sincere piety, which proved his undoing in the end, for it induced him to participate in Absalom&#x27;s rebellion against David. Thus, he forfeited even his share in the world to come. 
To this dire course of action, he was misled by astrology and other signs, which he interpreted as prophecies of his kingship when in reality, they pointed to the royal destiny of his granddaughter Bath-sheba. Possessed by his erroneous belief, he cunningly urged Absalom to commit an unheard-of crime. Thus, Absalom would profit nothing by his rebellion, for, though he accomplished his father&#x27;s ruin, he would yet be held to account and condemned to death for his violation of family purity, and the way to the throne would be clear for Ahithophel, the great sage in Israel.&quot; But he withheld his mystic knowledge from King David in the hour of peril and was therefore doomed to die from strangulation. &quot;Ahitophel of the house of Israel and Balaam of the heathen nations were the two great sages of the world who, failing to show gratitude to God for their wisdom, perished in dishonour. To them, the prophetic word finds application: &#x27;Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom&#x27; (Jeremiah 9:23).&quot;

It is also said that David, during his reign, had many disagreeable encounters with Ahithophel. Shortly after his accession, the king seems to have overlooked Ahithophel in his appointments with judges and other officials. Consequently, when David was in despair concerning the visitation upon Uzzah during the attempted transport of the ark (2 Samuel 6:6; see Uzzah) and sought counsel of Ahithophel, the latter mockingly suggested to him that he had better apply to his wise men. Only upon David&#x27;s malediction, that whoever knew a remedy and concealed it should surely end by committing suicide, did Ahithophel offer him some rather vague advice, concealing the true solution, which was that the ark must be carried on the shoulders of men instead of upon a wagon.

===Curse upon Ahithophel===
Ahithophel rendered a service to David upon another occasion, but not until he was again threatened with the curse. It appears that David excavated too deeply for the foundations of the Temple, resulting in the earth&#x27;s deepest floods breaking forth and nearly inundating the earth. None could help but Ahithophel, who withheld his counsel from seeing David borne away upon the flood. When David again warned him of the malediction, Ahithophel counselled the king to throw a tile, with the Tetragrammaton written upon it, into the cavity; the waters began to sink. Ahithophel is said to have defended his use of the name of God in this emergency by referencing the practice enjoined by Scripture (Numbers 5:23) to restore marital harmony; surely a matter of small importance, he argued, compared with the threatened destruction of the world. David&#x27;s repeated malediction that Ahithophel would be hanged was finally realized when the latter hanged himself.

Ahithophel&#x27;s death was a great loss to David, for his wisdom was so great that Scripture itself (2 Samuel 16:23) avoids calling him a man, likening him to an angel; in the passage quoted the Hebrew word for man is omitted in the text, being supplied only by the Masorah. (The preceding statement is incorrect because the word for &quot;man&quot; in 2 Samuel 16:23 refers to one who asks at the word of God and not to Ahithophel. Thus, its absence does not imply anything about Ahithophel.) Indeed, his wisdom bordered on that of the angels. His learning in the Law was also extensive so that David did not scruple to call him &quot;master&quot;; the two things which David is there said to have learned from Ahithophel are more closely described in Masechet Kallah. Ahithophel&#x27;s disposition, however, was a jealous one; and he always sought to wound David by mocking remarks. His devotion to the study of the Law was not founded on worthy motives. Ahithophel was thirty-three years old when he died. In his will, he left three warnings to his children to 1. Refrain from doing aught against a favourite of fortune. 2. Take heed not to rise up against the royal house of David and to take no part in their dissensions 3. If Shavuot falls on a sunny day, then sow wheat. Posterity has been favored with the knowledge of but a small part of Ahithophel&#x27;s wisdom, and that little through two widely different sources, through Socrates, who was his disciple, and through a fortune-book written by him.

Ahithophel is counted among those that have no share in the world to come.

==In Christian interpretation==
Christian interpreters often see Judas Iscariot as an antitype to Ahithophel. Alexander Kirkpatrick, in the Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges, calls his suicide &quot;the first deliberate suicide on record&quot;.

Ahithophel&#x27;s betrayal of David and subsequent suicide are seen as anticipating Judas&#x27; betrayal of Jesus, and the gospels&#x27; account of Judas hanging himself (Matthew 27:5). Psalm 41:9, which seems to refer to Ahithophel, is quoted in John 13:18 as being fulfilled in Judas.

<text>Ahitub ( &quot;’&quot; or &quot;’&quot; &#x27;my brother is goodness&#x27;) may refer to the following people in the Bible:

* Ahitub (High Priest), High Priests of Israel, son of Phinehas, grandson of Eli
* Ahitub, father of Zadok, grandson of Meraioth
* Ahitub, grandson of Azariah, a priestly descendant through the priestly line of the first Zadok, mentioned in 1 Chronicles 6:11-12. this Ahitub also had a son (or probably grandson) by the name of Zadok. This Ahitub may have been high priest in the later time of the kings, but he also may not have been a high priest. He did become the ancestor of later high priests, which served during the fall of Jerusalem and post-exile.
* Ahitub, an ancestor of a person mentioned in Nehemiah 11:11. This person might be one of the three aforementioned persons, but probably is not.

<text>Aholibamah (Hebrew: &quot;ʾĀhŏlīḇāmā&quot;; &quot;My tabernacle of/is height/exaltation&quot; or &quot;Tent of the High Place&quot;), is an eight-time referenced matriarch in the biblical record.

Aholibamah was the daughter of Anah and granddaughter of Zibeon the Hivite, son of Seir the Horite. She was one of two Canaanite women who married Esau, the son of Isaac, when he was in his forties. Isaac and his wife Rebecca, however, were greatly opposed to this union. So, according to some Biblical scholars, Esau changed her name to the Hebrew name &quot;Judith&quot;, as to pacify his parents. See Wives of Esau.

Biblical scholars have thus conciliated the two different name accounts given in Genesis for the three wives of Esau:

* Basemath (Genesis 26:34–35) = Adah (Genesis 36:2,3), the daughter of Elon the Hittite;
* Judith (Genesis 26:34–35) = Aholibamah (Genesis 36:2,3), also a Canaanite;
* Mahalath (Genesis 28:9) = Bashemath (Genesis 36:2,3), Esau&#x27;s cousin and third wife, daughter of Ishmael.

The name Aholibamah appears again later among the listed clans of Edom, suggesting that a descendant of Esau had the same (female) name and became a chief.

<text>The Ayalon Valley ( or , &quot;ʾAyyālōn&quot;), also written Aijalon and Ajalon, is a valley in the lowland of the Shephelah in Israel.

The Ayalon Valley has been an important route connecting the coastal plain and Jerusalem for generations. Due to its location, several battles were fought in its vicinity. The Hebrew Bible gives the valley its name from Ayalon, a city that the Tribe of Dan possessed before their migration to the north. In the modern period, ancient Ayalon was identified with the former village of Yalo at the base of the Bethoron pass, which preserved the ancient, biblical name.

Today, the Ayalon Valley is home to several &quot;kibbutzim&quot; and &quot;moshavim&quot;, including Sha&#x27;alvim, Mishmar Ayalon, Nahshon, and Kfar Bin Nun. The valley is also home to Canada Park, a national park, the Yad La-Shiryon (Armored Corps Museum), Mini Israel, the Latrun Monastery and Emmaus Nicopolis, an archeological site commonly identified with Emmaus of the New Testament.

==History==
In the Tell el-Amarna letters, written during the last twelve years of Pharaoh Akhenaten and the first regnal year of Tutankhamun (14th century BCE), Abdi-Heba speaks of the destruction of the &quot;city of Ajalon&quot; by the invaders, and describes himself as &quot;afflicted, greatly afflicted&quot; by the calamities that had come on the land, urging the king of Egypt to hasten to his help. This event may have been connected to an attack of the Amorites, before the arrival of the Israelites under Joshua. But since the valley stretches as far to the west as to a point halfway between Sha&#x27;alvim and Latrun, the city referenced in these letters may have been any settlement in the valley.

Ajalon is mentioned in the accounts of an invasion of Canaan by the Egyptian king Sheshonk I of Egypt in the 10th century BCE.

===Joshua&#x27;s battle===
The Valley of Ayalon was first mentioned in the &quot;Book of Joshua&quot; as where Joshua defeated five Amorite kings. Following his midnight march to rescue the city of Gibeon from the coalition led by the King of Jebus (Jerusalem), Joshua pursued the coalition eastward, down through the descent of Beth-horon, and then southward across the Valley of Ajalon. To allow the Israelites to complete the rout before nightfall, Joshua asked the Lord to lengthen the day by uttering the command: &quot;Sun, stand thou still on Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Aijalon&quot;. records that God cooperated with Joshua&#x27;s request.

===Tribe of Dan===
Following the conquest, the city of Ajalon was apportioned to the Tribe of Dan () and was designated as one of the Levitical cities given to the Kohathites ( and ). In spite of Joshua&#x27;s initial victory in the Valley of Ajalon, the Amorites continued to live in the city of Ajalon (). Constant Philistine pressure to control the valleys of the Shephelah forced the tribe of Dan to retreat westward, reducing the extent of their territory. Eventually, the Danites abandoned their initial inheritance in the Aijalon area and moved to the extreme northern part of Israel, settling in the city of Laish, which they renamed Dan ().

The location was also the site of a great victory over the Philistines by King Saul and his son Jonathan. After a daring attack by Jonathan on the Philistine garrison at Michmash, they pursued the Philistines to Aijalon, a distance of fifteen miles (). In later years, Aijalon was inhabited by Ephraimites and Benjamites ( and ).

After the kingdom divided, Ajalon became the boundary between the kingdoms of Judah and Israel. Rehoboam, the first king of Judah, fortified the city of Aijalon, supplying officers, weapons and food provisions ().

===Identification===
Ajalon&#x27;s identification with Yalo was made by Edward Robinson during his travels in Palestine in 1838. Using the works of Jerome and Eusebius of Caesarea, who describe Aijalon as being two Roman miles from Nicopolis, while also drawing upon descriptions of Aijalon in the Old Testament and noting the philological similarities between the Arabic name and its Hebrew root, Robinson concluded that the Yalo was indeed Aijalon.

==Sites==
Canada Park, Yad La-Shiryon, the International Center for the Study of Bird Migration and the Latrun Monastery are located in the Ayalon Valley.

<text>Akrabbim or Acrabbim (, meaning &quot;scorpions&quot;) is probably the general name given to the ridge containing the pass between the south of the Dead Sea and Zin, es-Sufah, by which there is an ascent to the level of the Negev desert. Scorpions are said to abound in this whole district, and hence the name (). It is called &quot;Maaleh-acrabbim&quot; in , and &quot;the ascent of Akrabbim&quot; in .

==&quot;Maaleh-acrabbim&quot; in the Book of Judges== 
There is another &quot;Maaleh-acrabbim&quot; mentioned in Judges 1:36, &quot;The Amorite border ran from Maaleh-acrabbim to Sela, and above.&quot; This was the border between the Amorites (Philistines) on the coastal plain and the tribe of Dan in the hills southwest of Ephraim.

==Josephus&#x27; &quot;Acrabbene&quot;==
Flavius Josephus, in The Wars of the Jews (ed. William Whiston, A.M.) book 3, section 48, places a toparchy called Acrabbene at the border between Samaria and Judea, as the southernmost part of Samaria: &quot;Now as to the country of Samaria, it lies between Judea and Galilee; it begins at a village that is in the great plain called Ginea, and ends at the Acrabbene toparchy, and is entirely of the same nature with Judea; for both countries are made up of hills and valleys, and are moist enough for agriculture, and are very fruitful.&quot;

<text>An alarm device is a mechanism that gives an audible, visual, combination, or other kind of alarm signal to alert someone to a problem or condition that requires urgent attention.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;alarm&quot; comes from the Old French &quot;a l&#x27;arme&quot; meaning &quot;to the arms&quot;, or &quot;to the weapons&quot;, telling armed men to pick up their weapons and get ready for action because an enemy may have suddenly appeared.

The word &quot;alarum&quot; is an archaic form of &quot;alarm&quot;. It was sometimes used as a call to arms in the stage directions of Elizabethan dramas. The term comes from the Italian &quot;all&#x27;armi&quot; and appears 89 times in Shakespeare&#x27;s First Folio. Often explained as the off-stage sounds of conflict or disturbance, recent research suggests a bell or drum may have been used to rouse soldiers from sleep.

==History and development==
Early alarm devices were often bells, drums, other musical instruments, or any items which made unusual loud noises that attracted the attention of the surrounding population.

Whistles were used by police in the 19th century. Steam whistles have been used on locomotives, ships, and in factories as alarm devices.

With the advent of electricity, a variety of other alerting devices have been invented, such as buzzers, klaxons, sirens, horns, flashing and coloured lights, and other all-purpose alarms.

Alarm devices can be fitted to buildings as well as vehicles. Many buildings are fitted with fire alarms, ranging from a self-contained domestic smoke detector to a sophisticated alarm system that can operate building fire fighting systems automatically to extinguish fires with water or inert gases.

Many industries have developed standards for alarm devices, and the colours red, blue and amber are generally recognized as alarm device-related colours, with flashing lights often indicating urgent conditions.

== Responses to an alarm ==

Human reactions to an alarm will often depend on upbringing, psychological training, or the behavior of others in the environment. Consequently, the ability to test an alarm and hold regular drills to practice an appropriate response may be provided as part of an alarm system.

Alarm devices that are intended to cause the evacuation of an occupied building, such as fire alarms, may be deliberately designed to make remaining in the space difficult or even painful in order to encourage occupants to leave.

Some alarms may startle and cause a fight-or-flight response in humans; a person under this mindset will panic and either flee the perceived danger or attempt to eliminate it, often ignoring rational thought in either case. A person in such a state can be characterized as &quot;alarmed&quot;.

== False alarms ==
With any kind of alarm, you must balance between the danger of false alarms (called &quot;false positives&quot;) — the signal going off in the absence of a problem — or an alarm failing to signal an actual problem (called a &quot;false negative&quot;). False alarms can waste resources expensively and can even be dangerous. For example, false alarms of a fire can waste firefighter manpower, making them unavailable for a real fire, and risk injury to firefighters and others as the fire engines race to the alleged fire&#x27;s location. In addition, false alarms may acclimatise people to ignore alarm signals, and thus possibly to ignore an actual emergency: Aesop&#x27;s fable of &quot;The Boy Who Cried Wolf&quot; exemplifies this problem.
A false alarm is one of the most significant issues with conventional alarm systems. They can be triggered for several reasons, such as the movement of pets, typing in the wrong security codes, or loud sounds from windows or doors. In the case of fire alarms, aerosol sprays, smoking, or burning food can all lead to a false alarm.

Many avoid the risk of false alarms by ensuring their alarms are secured in an appropriate location, such as placing a smoke detector or fire alarm away from the kitchen where smoke from burned food or large quantities of steam which may trigger a false alarm are common occurrences. In the case of a security alarm, an additional monitoring station which assesses whether there is a legitimate need for help can reduce false alarms.

== Devices ==

There are many kinds of alarm devices. The most common types include: 
* an alarm clock that sounds an alarm at a pre-set time, often used to wake a person up or remind them of an event.
* a fire alarm which is used to give occupants of a building early warning of a potential fire and give them time to evacuate.
* warning devices on a vehicle that sound when it is moving in an unexpected direction, such as reversing,
* a siren, often accompanied by flashing coloured lights, on emergency vehicles responding to an emergency
Alarm devices, by category, include:
* burglar alarms, designed to warn of burglaries. This is often a silent alarm; law enforcement or guards are warned without alerting the burglar, which increases the chances of stopping the theft while in progress.
* alarm clocks can beep, buzz or ring at a set time to wake a person up or for other reminders
* distributed control systems (DCS), found in nuclear power plants, refineries and chemical facilities, also generate alarms to direct the operator&#x27;s attention to an important event that they need to address.
* alarms in an operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) monitoring system, which alerts an operator to a malfunction of a particular part of the system under monitoring.
** first-out alarm
* safety alarms, which go off if a dangerous condition occurs. Common public safety alarms include: 
**civil defense siren, also known as &quot;tornado sirens&quot; or &quot;air raid sirens&quot;
** fire alarm systems
*** fire alarm notification appliance
*** &quot;Multiple-alarm fire&quot;, a locally specific measure of the severity of a fire and the fire-department reaction required.
*** smoke detector
** car alarms
** autodialer alarm, also known as &quot;community alarm&quot;
** personal alarm
** Video alarm verification systems provides instant notifications upon the detection of a possible threat verified through a video feed.

<text>Alms (, ) are money, food, or other material goods donated to people living in poverty. Providing alms is often considered an act of charity. The act of providing alms is called almsgiving.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;alms&quot; comes from the Old English &#x27;, &#x27;, which comes from Late Latin &#x27;, from Greek &#x27; (&quot;pity, alms&quot;), from , &#x27; (&quot;merciful&quot;), from , &#x27;, meaning &quot;pity or mercy&quot;.

== Buddhism ==
=== &quot;Dāna&quot; in Buddhism===

In Buddhism, both &quot;almsgiving&quot; and &quot;giving&quot; are called &quot;dāna&quot; (Pāli). Such giving is one of the three elements of the path of practice as formulated by the Buddha for laypeople. This path of practice for laypeople is dāna, sīla, and bhāvanā.

Generosity towards other sentient beings is also emphasized in Mahayana as one of the perfections (paramita). As shown in Lama Tsong Khapa&#x27;s &#x27;The Abbreviated Points of the Graded Path&#x27; ():

The giving of alms is the beginning of one&#x27;s journey to Nirvana (). In practice, one can give anything with or without thought for Nibbana. This would lead to faith (), one key power () that one should generate within oneself for the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha.

According to the Pali canon:
=== Intentions for giving ===
The intentions behind giving play an important role in developing spiritual qualities. The suttas record various motives for exercising generosity. For example, the Anguttara Nikaya (A.iv, 236) enumerates the following eight motives:

# One gives with annoyance, or as a way of offending the recipient, or with the idea of insulting him.
# Fear also can motivate a person to make an offering.
# One gives in return for a favor done to oneself in the past.
# One also may give with the hope of getting a similar favor for oneself in the future.
# One gives because giving is considered good.
# &quot;I cook, they do not cook. It is not proper for me who cooks not to give to those who do not cook.&quot; (i.e. Some give because they are able to do what others cannot.)
# Some give alms to gain a good reputation.
# Still others give alms to adorn and beautify the mind.

=== In support of Buddhist monks ===
In Buddhism, alms or almsgiving is the respect given by a lay Buddhist to a Buddhist monk, nun, spiritually-developed person or other sentient being. It is not charity as presumed by Western interpreters. It is closer to a symbolic connection to the spiritual realm and to show humbleness and respect in the presence of the secular society. The act of almsgiving connects the human to the monk or nun and what he/she represents. As the Buddha has stated:
In Theravada Buddhism, nuns (Pāli: &quot;bhikkhunis&quot;) and monks (Pāli: &quot;bhikkhus&quot;) practice &quot;Takuhatsu&quot; (&#x27;) where they collect food (&#x27;). This is often perceived as allowing the laypeople to make merit (Pāli: &quot;puñña&quot;). Money cannot be accepted by a Theravadan Buddhist monk or nun in place of or in addition to food, as the Patimokkha training rules make it an offense worth forfeiture and confession.

In countries that follow Mahayana Buddhism, the practice of &quot;Takuhatsu&quot; has mostly died out. In China, Korea, and Japan, local cultures resisted the idea of giving food to &#x27;begging&#x27; clerics, and there was no tradition of gaining &#x27;merit&#x27; by donating to practitioners. After periods of persecution, monasteries were situated in remote mountain areas; the distance between the monastery and the nearest towns made this practice impossible. In Japan, the practice of a weekly or monthly Takuhatsu replaced the daily round. In the Himalayan countries, the large number of &quot;bhikkhus&quot; would have made an alms round a heavy burden on families. Competition with other religions for support also made daily practice difficult and even dangerous; the first Buddhist monks in the Silla dynasty of Korea were said to be beaten due to their minority at the time.

== Christianity ==

In Christianity, the giving of alms is viewed as an act of charity. In the Apostolic age, Christians were taught that giving alms was an expression of love. Such care for the poor was to be understood as love for God, who, in the person of Jesus Christ, sacrificed himself for the salvation of believers.

In nearly all Christian denominations, money is donated to support the church&#x27;s financial needs and its ministry to the less fortunate. In some churches, the alms are placed near to the altar to symbolize that the offering belongs to God and to represent the unity of the congregation.

=== In Western Christianity ===

The offertory is the traditional moment in the Roman Catholic Mass, Lutheran Divine Service, and Anglican Eucharist, when alms are collected. Baptists and Methodists, among other denominations, collect tithes and offerings (alms) during the offertory in church services. A tithe, the first tenth of one&#x27;s income, is seen as what is owed to God, while an offering (alms) includes anything contributed beyond that. Some fellowships practice regular giving for special purposes called &quot;love offerings&quot; for the poor, destitute or victims of catastrophic loss such as home fires or medical expenses. Traditionally, deacons and deaconesses are responsible for distributing these gifts among widows, orphans, and others in need. Many Christians support a plethora of charitable organizations, not all of which claim a Christian religious affiliation. Many American educational and medical institutions were founded by Christian fellowships giving alms.

=== In Eastern Christianity ===
In the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Eastern Catholic Churches, the collection of alms and tithes has not been formally united to the offertory in any liturgical action. However, either having a collection plate in the narthex or passing it unobtrusively during the service is not uncommon. In Eastern Orthodox theology, almsgiving is an important part of the spiritual life, and fasting should always be accompanied by increased prayer and almsgiving. Almsgiving in the name of the deceased also frequently accompanies prayer for the dead. Those whose financial circumstances do not permit the giving of monetary alms may give alms in other ways, such as intercessory prayer and acts of mercy such as visiting people in prison, clothing the poor or volunteering in soup kitchens.

=== In the New Testament ===
In addition, private acts of charity are a duty and considered virtuous only if not done for others to admire:
Jesus places the primary focus on the motives behind the outward and inward giving of alms, which should be love:

Jesus contrasts the giving of the rich and the poor:
Giving should be out of love and not out of duty:

Sharing possessions was practised in the church:


== Hinduism ==
=== &quot;Dāna&quot; in Hinduism ===

In Hinduism, &#x27; () is an ancient concept of almsgiving dating to the Vedic period of Hinduism. &#x27; has been defined in traditional texts as any action of relinquishing the ownership of what one considered or identified as one&#x27;s own, and investing the same in a recipient without expecting anything in return. While &quot;&quot; is typically given to one person or family, Hinduism also discusses charity or giving aimed at public benefit, which is sometimes called &quot;utsarga&quot;. This aims at larger projects such as building a rest house, school, investing in drinking water or an irrigation well, planting trees, and building care facilities, among others. The practice of begging for alms is called &quot;bhiksha&quot; ().

The 11th century Persian historian Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī, who visited and lived in India for 16 years beginning in about 1017 CE, mentions the practice of charity and almsgiving among Hindus as he observed during his stay. He wrote, &quot;It is obligatory with them (Hindus) every day to give alms as much as possible.&quot;

Almsgiving in Hinduism is considered a noble deed to be done without expectation of any return from those who receive the charity. Some texts reason, referring to the nature of social life, that charity is a form of good karma that affects one&#x27;s future circumstances and environment, and that good charitable deeds leads to good future life because of the reciprocity principle. Other Hindu texts, such as &quot;Vyasa Samhita&quot;, state that reciprocity may be innate in human nature and social functions but dāna is a virtue in itself, as doing good lifts the nature of one who gives. The texts do not recommend charity to unworthy recipients or where charity may harm or encourage injury to or by the recipient. &#x27; is thus a dharmic act, requires an idealistic-normative approach, and has spiritual and philosophical context. Some medieval era authors state that &#x27; is best done with &quot;śraddhā&quot; (faith), which is defined as being in good will, cheerful, welcoming the recipient of the charity and giving without &quot;anasuya&quot; (finding faults in the recipient). Kohler states that these scholars of Hinduism suggest that charity is most effective when it is done with delight, a sense of &quot;unquestioning hospitality&quot;, where the &quot;dāna&quot; ignores the short term weaknesses as well as the circumstances of the recipient and takes a long-term view.

==== Institutional &quot;dāna&quot; ====
&quot;Satrams&quot;, also called &quot;Dharamsala&quot; or &quot;Chathrams&quot; in parts of India, have been one means of almsgiving in Hinduism. &quot;Satrams&quot; are shelters (rest houses) for travelers and the poor, with many serving water and free food. These were usually established along the roads connecting major Hindu temple sites in south Asia, as well as near major temples. Hindu temples have also served as institutions for almsgiving. The &quot;dāna&quot; the temples received from Hindus were used to feed people in distress as well as fund public projects such as irrigation and land reclamation.

==== Forms of &quot;dāna&quot; ====
Forms of almsgiving in Hinduism include:
# &quot;go dāna&quot;, the donation of a cow
# &quot;bhu dāna&quot; (), the donation of land
# &quot;vidya dāna&quot; or &quot;jñāna dāna&quot; (, ), the giving of knowledge and skills
# &quot;aushadhā dāna&quot;, the giving of care for the sick and diseased
# &quot;abhay dāna&quot;, the giving of freedom from fear (such as asylum or protection for someone facing imminent injury)
# &quot;anna dāna&quot; (), the giving of food to the poor, needy, and all visitors

Between giving food and giving knowledge, Hindu texts suggest the gift of knowledge is superior.

==== In the Vedas ====
The Rigveda has the earliest discussion of &quot;&quot; in the Vedas and offers reasons for the virtue of almsgiving.

==== In the Upanishads ====
The early Upanishads, those composed before 500 BCE, discuss the virtue of almsgiving. For example, Brihadaranyaka Upanishad states in verse 5.2.3 that three characteristics of a good, developed person are self-restraint (&quot;dama&quot;), compassion or love for all sentient life (&quot;daya&quot;), and charity (&quot;&quot;). Chandogya Upanishad, similarly, states in Book III that a virtuous life requires &quot;tapas&quot; (meditation, asceticism), &quot;dāna&quot; (charity), &quot;arjava&quot; (straightforwardness, non-hypocrisy), &quot;ahimsa&quot; (non-violence, non-injury to all sentient beings) and &quot;satyavacana&quot; (truthfulness).

==== In Mahabharata and Puranas ====
Bhagavad Gita describes the right and wrong forms of in verses 17.20 through 17.22. The &quot;Adi Parva&quot; of the Hindu Epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot; states in Chapter 91 that a person must first acquire wealth by honest means, then embark on charity; be hospitable to those who come to him; never inflict pain on any living being; and share a portion with others whatever he consumes. In the &quot;Vana Parva&quot;, Chapter 194, the Mahabharata recommends that one must &quot;conquer the mean by charity, the untruthful by truth, the wicked by forgiveness, and dishonesty by honesty&quot;.

The &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; discusses when is proper and when it is improper. In Book 8, Chapter 19, verse 36, it states that charity is inappropriate if it endangers and cripples modest livelihood of one&#x27;s biological dependents or of one&#x27;s own. Charity from surplus income above that required for modest living is recommended in the Puranas.

== Islam ==
In Islam, the concept of Muhsi or Muhsin alms-giver or charitable giving is generally divided into voluntary giving, &quot;ṣadaqah&quot; (), and an obligatory practice, the &quot;zakāh&quot; (). &quot;Zakāh&quot; is governed by a specific set of rules within Islamic jurisprudence and is intended to fulfill a well-defined set of theological and social requirements. &quot;Ṣadaqah&quot; is possibly a better translation of Christian influenced formulations of the notion of &quot;alms&quot; for that reason, though &quot;zakāh&quot; plays a much larger role within Islamic charity.

=== &quot;Zakat&quot; ===

&quot;Zakāh&quot; is the third of the five pillars of Islam. The literal meaning of the word &quot;zakāh&quot; is &quot;to purify&quot;, &quot;to develop&quot; and &quot;cause to grow&quot;. &quot;Zakāh&quot; is the amount of money that every Muslim, male or female, who is an adult, mentally stable, free, and financially able, has to pay to support specific categories of people. According to &quot;shariah&quot;, it is an act of worship. Possessions are purified by setting aside a proportion for those in need. This cutting back, like the pruning of plants, balances and encourages new growth. Various rules are attached but, in general terms, it is obligatory to give 2.5% of one&#x27;s savings and business revenue and 5–10% of one&#x27;s harvest to the poor. Possible recipients include the destitute, the working poor, those who are unable to pay off their own debts, stranded travelers and others who need assistance, with the general principle of &quot;zakat&quot; always being that the rich should pay it to the poor. One of the most important principles of Islam is that all things belong to God and wealth is therefore held by human beings in trust.

This category of people is defined in At-Tawbah:
The obligatory nature of &quot;zakat&quot; is firmly established in the Qur&#x27;an, the &quot;sunnah&quot; (or &quot;hadith&quot;), and the consensus of the companions and the Muslim scholars. Allah states in At-Tawbah:
Muslims of each era have agreed upon the obligatory nature of paying &quot;zakat&quot; from their gold and silver, and from other kinds of currency.

==== &quot;Nisab&quot; ====

&quot;Zakat&quot; is obligatory when a certain amount of money, called the &quot;nisab&quot; (or minimum amount), is reached or exceeded. Zakat is not obligatory if the amount owned is less than this &quot;nisab&quot;. The &quot;nisab&quot; of gold and golden currency is 20 &quot;mithqal&quot;, or approximately 85 grams of pure gold. One &quot;mithqal&quot; is approximately 4.25 grams. The &quot;nisab&quot; of silver and silver currency is 200 dirhams, which is approximately 595 grams of pure silver. The &quot;nisab&quot; of other kinds of money and currency is to be scaled to that of gold; the &quot;nisab&quot; of money is equivalent to the price of 85 grams of 999-type (pure) gold on the day in which &quot;zakat&quot; is paid.

&quot;Zakat&quot; is obligatory after the money has been in the control of its owner for the span of one lunar year; a lunar year is approximately 355 days. The owner then needs to pay 2.5% (or 1/40) of the money as &quot;zakat&quot;. The owner should deduct any amount of money he or she borrowed from others, check if the rest reaches the necessary &quot;nisab&quot;, then pay &quot;zakat&quot; for it.

If the owner had enough money to satisfy the &quot;nisab&quot; at the beginning of the year, but his wealth in any form increased, the owner needs to add the increase to the &quot;nisab&quot; amount owned at the beginning of the year and then pay &quot;zakat&quot;, 2.5%, of the total at the end of the lunar year. There are minor differences between &quot;fiqh&quot; schools on how this is to be calculated. Each Muslim calculates his or her own &quot;zakat&quot; individually. For most purposes, this involves the payment each year of two and a half percent of one&#x27;s capital.

=== &quot;Sadaqah&quot; ===

A pious person may also give alms as much as he or she pleases as &quot;ṣadaqah&quot;, and does so preferably in secret. Although this word can be translated as &#x27;voluntary charity&#x27;, it has a wider meaning, as illustrated in the hadiths:

== Judaism ==

=== &quot;Tzedakah&quot; ===

In Judaism, &quot;tzedakah&quot;, a Hebrew term literally meaning righteousness but commonly used to signify &quot;charity&quot;, refers to the religious obligation to do what is right and just. In the Greek Septuagint &quot;tzedakah&quot; was sometimes translated as , &quot;almsgiving&quot;.

In Judaism, &quot;tzedakah&quot; is seen as one of the greatest deeds that a person can do. &quot;Tzedakah&quot;, along with prayer and repentance, is regarded as ameliorating the consequences of bad acts. Contemporary &quot;tzedakah&quot; is regarded as a continuation of the Biblical &quot;Maaser Ani&quot;, or poor-tithe, as well as Biblical practices including permitting the poor to glean the corners of a field, harvest during the &quot;Shmita&quot; (sabbatical year), and other practices. Jewish farmers are commanded to leave the corners of their fields for the starving to harvest for food and are forbidden to pick up any grain that has been dropped during harvesting, as such food shall be left for the starving as well.

In the Mishneh Torah, Chapter 10:7–14, Maimonides lists eight &quot;laws about giving to poor people&quot; (&quot;&quot;), listed in order from most to least righteous, with the most righteous form being allowing an individual to become self-sustaining and capable of giving others charity:
# Enabling the recipient to become self-reliant.
# Giving when neither party knows the other&#x27;s identity.
# Giving when you know the recipient&#x27;s identity, but the recipient doesn&#x27;t know your identity.
# Giving when you do not know the recipient&#x27;s identity, but the recipient knows your identity.
# Giving before being asked.
# Giving after being asked.
# Giving less than you should, but giving it cheerfully.
# Giving begrudgingly.

==Mandaeism==

===&quot;Zidqa&quot;===

In Mandaeism, &quot;zidqa&quot; refers to alms or almsgiving. Mandaean priests receive regular financial contributions from laypeople.

The Mandaic term &quot;zidqa brika&quot; (literally &quot;blessed oblation&quot;) refers to a ritual meal blessed by priests. An early self-appellation for Mandaeans is &quot;bhiri zidqa&quot;, meaning &quot;elect of righteousness&quot;.

<text>An altar is a table or platform for the presentation of religious offerings, for sacrifices, or for other ritualistic purposes. Altars are found at shrines, temples, churches, and other places of worship. They are used particularly in Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, and modern paganism. Many historical-medieval faiths also made use of them, including the Roman, Greek, and Norse religions.

==Etymology==
The modern English word &quot;&quot; was derived from Middle English &quot;&quot;, from Old English &quot;&quot;, taken from Latin &quot;&quot; (&quot;altar&quot;), probably related to &quot;&quot; (&quot;burn&quot;); thus &quot;burning place&quot;, influenced by &quot;&quot; (&quot;high&quot;). It displaced the native Old English word &quot;&quot;.

==Altars in antiquity==

In antiquity, altars were used for making sacrifices to deities; this could include both libations and animal sacrifice. 

In Ancient Roman religion, altars were often inscribed with the donor&#x27;s name and the deity to whom the altar was dedicated. One of the most important surviving Roman altars is the Ara Pacis, dedicated by Augustus Caesar at the beginning of the Pax Romana to the goddess of peace, Pax.

==Judaism==
Altars in the Hebrew Bible were typically made of earth or unwrought stone. Altars were generally erected in conspicuous places. The first altar recorded in the Hebrew Bible is that erected by Noah. Altars were erected by Abraham, by Isaac, by Jacob, and by Moses.

After the theophany on Mount Sinai, in the Tabernacle—and afterwards in the Temple—only two altars were used: The Altar of Burnt Offering, and the Altar of Incense, both near where the Ark of the Covenant was located.

The remains of three rock-hewn altars were discovered in the Land of Israel: one below Tel Zorah, another at the foot of Sebastia (ancient Samaria), and a third near Shiloh.

==Christianity==

The word &quot;altar&quot;, in Greek (&quot;see&quot;:), appears twenty-four times in the New Testament. In Catholic and Orthodox Christian theology, the Eucharist is a re-presentation, in the literal sense of the one sacrifice of Christ on the cross being made &quot;present again&quot;. Hence, the table upon which the Eucharist is consecrated is called an altar.

The altar plays a central role in the celebration of the Eucharist, which takes place at the altar on which the bread and the wine for consecration are placed. Altars occupy a prominent place in most Christian churches, both Eastern and Western branches. Commonly among these churches, altars are placed for permanent use within designated places of communal worship (often called &quot;sanctuaries&quot;). Less often, though nonetheless notable, altars are set in spaces occupied less regularly, such as outdoors in nature, in cemeteries, in mausoleums/crypts, and family dwellings. Personal altars are those placed in a private bedroom, closet, or other space usually occupied by one person. They are used for practices of piety intended for one person (often referred to as a &quot;private devotion&quot;). They are also found in a minority of Protestant worship places; in Reformed and Anabaptist churches, a table, often called a &quot;Communion table&quot;, serves an analogous function.

The area around the altar is seen as endowed with greater holiness, and is usually physically distinguished from the rest of the church, whether by a permanent structure such as an iconostasis, a rood screen, altar rails, a curtain that can be closed at more solemn moments of the liturgy (as in the Armenian Apostolic Church and Armenian Catholic Church), or simply by the general architectural layout. The altar is often on a higher elevation than the rest of the church.

Churches generally have a single altar, although in the Western branches of Christianity, as a result of the former abandonment of concelebration of Mass, so that priests always celebrated Mass individually, larger churches have had one or more side chapels, each with its own altar. The main altar was also referred to as the &quot;&quot;. Since the revival of concelebration in the West, the Roman Missal recommends that in new churches there should be only one altar, &quot;which in the gathering of the faithful will signify the one Christ and the one Eucharist of the Church.&quot; This does not exclude altars in distinct side chapels, however, but only separate altars in the main body of the church. But most Western churches of an earlier period, whether Roman Catholic or Anglican, may have a high altar in the main body of the church, with one or more adjoining chapels, each with its own altar, at which the Eucharist may be celebrated on weekdays.

Architecturally, there are two types of altars: Those that are attached to the eastern wall of the chancel, and those that are free-standing and can be walked around, for instance when incensing the altar.
In the earliest days of the Church, the Eucharist appears to have been celebrated on portable altars set up for the purpose. Some historians hold that, during the persecutions, the Eucharist was celebrated among the tombs in the Catacombs of Rome, using the sarcophagi of martyrs as altars on which to celebrate. Other historians dispute this, but it is thought to be the origin of the tradition of placing relics beneath the altar.

When Christianity was legalized under Constantine the Great and Licinius, formal church buildings were built in great numbers, normally with free-standing altars in the middle of the sanctuary, which in all the earliest churches built in Rome was at the west end of the church. &quot;When Christians in fourth-century Rome could first freely begin to build churches, they customarily located the sanctuary towards the west end of the building in imitation of the sanctuary of the Jerusalem Temple. Although in the days of the Jerusalem Temple the High Priest indeed faced east when sacrificing on Yom Kippur, the sanctuary within which he stood was located at the western end of the Temple. The Christian replication of the layout and the orientation of the Jerusalem Temple helped to dramatize the eschatological meaning attached to the sacrificial death of Jesus the High Priest in the Epistle to the Hebrews.&quot; The ministers (bishop, priests, deacons, subdeacons, acolytes), celebrated the Eucharist facing east, towards the entrance. Some hold that for the central part of the celebration the congregation faced the same way. After the sixth century the contrary orientation prevailed, with the entrance to the west and the altar at the east end. Then the ministers and congregation all faced east during the whole celebration; and in Western Europe altars began, in the Middle Ages, to be permanently placed against the east wall of the chancel.

===In Western Christian churches===

Most rubrics, even in books of the seventeenth century and later, such as the Pontificale Romanum, continued to envisage the altar as free-standing. The rite of the Dedication of the Church continued to presume that the officiating bishop could circle the altar during the consecration of the church and its altar. Despite this, with the increase in the size and importance of the reredos, most altars were built against the wall or barely separated from it.

In almost all cases, the eastward orientation for prayer was maintained, whether the altar was at the west end of the church, as in all the earliest churches in Rome, in which case the priest celebrating Mass faced the congregation and the church entrance, or whether it was at the east end of the church, in which case the priest faced the eastern apse and had his back to the congregation. This diversity was recognized in the rubrics of the Roman Missal from the 1604 typical edition of Pope Clement VIII to the 1962 edition of Pope John XXIII: &quot;&quot;

When placed close to a wall or touching it, altars were often surmounted by a reredos or altarpiece. If free-standing, they could be placed, as also in Eastern Christianity, within a ciborium (sometimes called a baldachin).

The rules regarding the present-day form of the Roman Rite liturgy declare a free-standing main altar to be &quot;desirable wherever possible&quot;. Similarly, in the Anglican Communion, the rubrics of the Book of Common Prayer assumed an altar fixed against the wall, until Prayer Book revision in the twentieth century removed language which assumed any particular form of altar.

As well as altars in the structural sense, it became customary in the West to have what in Latin were referred to as (portable altars), more commonly referred to in English as altar stones. When travelling, a priest could take one with him and place it on an ordinary table for saying Mass. They were also inserted into the centre of structural altars especially those made of wood. In that case, it was the altar stone that was considered liturgically to be the altar. The Pontificale Romanum contained a rite for blessing at the same time several of these altar stones. In the East the antimension served and continues to serve the same purpose.

The term &quot;movable altar&quot; or &quot;portable altar&quot; is now used of a full-scale structural altar, with or without an inserted altar stone, that can be moved.

Movable altars include the free-standing wooden tables without altar stone, placed in the choir away from the east wall, favoured by churches in the Reformed tradition. Altars that not only can be moved but are repeatedly moved are found in low church traditions that do not focus worship on the Eucharist, celebrating it rarely. Both Catholics and Protestants celebrate the Eucharist at such altars outside of churches and chapels, as outdoors or in an auditorium.

====Catholic Church====

The Eastern Catholic Churches each follow their own traditions, which in general correspond to those of similar Eastern Orthodox or Oriental Orthodox Churches. All Christian Churches see the altar on which the Eucharist is offered as the &quot;table of the Lord&quot; () mentioned by Saint Paul. The rules indicated here are those of the Latin Church.

The Latin Church distinguishes between fixed altars (those attached to the floor) and movable altars (those that can be displaced), and states: &quot;It is desirable that in every church there be a fixed altar, since this more clearly and permanently signifies Christ Jesus, the Living Stone. In other places set aside for sacred celebrations, the altar may be movable.&quot;

A fixed altar should in general be topped by a slab of natural stone, thus conforming to tradition and to the significance attributed to the altar, but in many places dignified, well-crafted solid wood is permitted; the supports or base of a fixed altar may be of any dignified solid material. A movable altar may be of any noble solid material suitable for liturgical use.

The liturgical norms state:
:It is fitting that the tradition of the Roman liturgy should be preserved of placing relics of martyrs or other saints beneath the altar. However, the following should be noted:
:(a) Relics intended for deposition should be large enough that they can be recognized as parts of human bodies. Hence excessively small relics of one or more saints must not be deposited.
:(b) The greatest care must be taken to determine whether relics intended for deposition are authentic. It is better for an altar to be dedicated without relics than to have relics of doubtful credibility placed beneath it.
:(c) A reliquary must not be placed on the altar, or in the table of the altar; it must be beneath the table of the altar, as the design of the altar may allow.
This last norm explicitly excludes the practice customary in recent centuries of inserting relics into a specially created cavity within the table of an altar or altar stone. Placing of relics even in the base of a movable altar is also excluded.

&quot;In building new churches, it is preferable for a single altar to be erected, one that in the gathering of the faithful will signify the one Christ and the one Eucharist of the Church. In already existing churches, however, when the old altar is so positioned that it makes the people&#x27;s participation difficult but cannot be moved without damage to artistic value, another fixed altar, skillfully made and properly dedicated, should be erected and the sacred rites celebrated on it alone. In order that the attention of the faithful not be distracted from the new altar the old altar should not be decorated in any special way.&quot;
The altar, fixed or movable, should as a rule be separate from the wall so as to make it easy to walk around it and to celebrate Mass at it facing the people. It should be positioned so as to be the natural centre of attention of the whole congregation.

The altar should be covered by at least one white cloth, and nothing else should be placed upon the altar table other than what is required for the liturgical celebration. Candlesticks and a crucifix, when required, can be either on the altar or near it, and it is desirable that the crucifix remain even outside of liturgical celebrations.

====Protestant churches====

A wide variety of altars exist in various Protestant denominations. Some Churches, such as the Lutheran, have altars very similar to Anglican or Catholic ones keeping with their more sacramental understanding of the Lord&#x27;s Supper. Calvinist churches from Reformed, Baptist, Congregational, and Non-denominational backgrounds instead have a Communion Table adorned with a linen cloth, as well as an open Bible and a pair of candlesticks; it is not referred to as an altar because they do not see Holy Communion as sacrificial in any way. Such a table may be temporary: Moved into place only when there is a Communion Service. Some nondenominational churches have no altar or communion table, even if they retain the practice of the &quot;altar call&quot; that originated in the Methodist Church.

Some Methodist and other evangelical churches practice what is referred to as an &quot;altar call&quot;, whereby those who wish to make a new spiritual commitment to Jesus Christ are invited to come forward publicly.
It is so named because the supplicants, at the end of the sermon, kneel at the altar rails, which are located around the altar within chancel.
Those that come forward will often recite a sinner&#x27;s prayer, which, in evangelical understanding, if truly heart-felt indicates that they are now &quot;saved&quot;. They may also be offered religious literature, counselling or other assistance. Many times it is said that those who come forth are going to &quot;be saved&quot;. This is a ritual in which the supplicant makes a prayer of penitence (asking for his sins to be forgiven) and faith (called in evangelical Christianity &quot;accepting Jesus Christ as their personal Lord and Saviour&quot;).

=====Lutheran churches=====

Altars in Lutheran churches are often similar to those in Roman Catholic and Anglican churches. Lutherans believe that the altar represents Christ and should only be used to consecrate and distribute the Eucharist. Lutheran altars are commonly made out of granite, but other materials are also used. A crucifix is to be put above the altar. Sometimes relics are also placed around the altar.

=====Anglican churches=====
Altars in the Anglican Communion vary widely. In the Book of Common Prayer, the basis of doctrine and practice for the Church of England, there is no use of the specific word &quot;altar&quot;; the item in question is called the &quot;Lord&#x27;s Table&quot; or &quot;Holy Table&quot;. This remains the official terminology, though common usage may call the communion table an altar.

At the time of the Reformation, altars were fixed against the east end of the church, and the priests would celebrate the Mass standing at the front of the altar. Beginning with the rubrics of the Second Prayer Book of Edward VI published in 1552, and through the 1662 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; (which prevailed for almost 300 years and is still in occasional use), the priest is directed to stand &quot;at the north syde of the Table&quot;. This was variously interpreted over the years to mean the north side of the front of a fixed communion table, the north end of a fixed table (i.e., facing south), the north side of a free-standing table (presumably facing those intending to receive the Elements who would be sitting in the quire stalls opposite), or at the north end of a free-standing table lengthwise in the chancel, facing a congregation seated in the nave.

Often, where a celebrant chose to situate himself was meant to convey his churchmanship (that is, more Reformed or more Catholic). The use of candles or tabernacles was banned by canon law, with the only appointed adornment being a white linen cloth.

Beginning with the Oxford Movement in the 19th century, the appearance of Anglican altars took a dramatic turn in many churches. Candles and, in some cases, tabernacles were re‑introduced. In some churches two candles, on each end of the altar, were used; in other cases six—three on either side of a tabernacle, typically surmounted by a crucifix or some other image of Christ. When a stone altar was placed in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, Cambridge after rebuilding works in 1841, a case was brought in the Court of Arches which resulted in an order to remove it and replace it with a wooden communion table.
In Anglican practice, conformity to a given standard depends on the ecclesiastical province and/or the liturgical sensibilities of a given parish. In the &quot;Parson&#x27;s Handbook&quot;, an influential manual for priests popular in the early-to-mid-twentieth century, Percy Dearmer recommends that &quot;All altars should be 3 ft. 3 in. high, and &quot;at least&quot; deep enough to take a corporal [the square of linen placed underneath the Communion vessels] 20 in. square, with an inch or two to spare.&quot; He also recommends that the altar stand upon three steps for each of the three sacred ministers, and that it be decorated with a silk frontal in the seasonal colour. In some cases, other manuals suggest that a stone be set in the top of wooden altars, in the belief that the custom be maintained of consecrating the bread and wine on a stone surface. In many other Anglican parishes, the custom is considerably less rigorous, especially in those parishes which use free-standing altars. Typically, these altars are made of wood, and may or may not have a solid front, which may or may not be ornamented. In many Anglican parishes, the use of frontals has persisted.

When altars are placed away from the wall of the chancel allowing a westward orientation, only two candles are placed on either end of it, since six would obscure the liturgical action, undermining the intent of a westward orientation (i.e., that it be visible to the congregation). In such an arrangement, a tabernacle may stand to one side of or behind the altar, or an aumbry may be used.

Sensibilities concerning the sanctity of the altar are widespread in Anglicanism. In some parishes, the notion that the surface of the altar should only be touched by those in holy orders is maintained. In others, there is considerably less strictness about the communion table. Nonetheless, the continued popularity of communion rails in Anglican church construction suggests that a sense of the sanctity of the altar and its surrounding area persists. In most cases, moreover, the practice of allowing only those items that have been blessed to be placed on the altar is maintained (that is, the linen cloth, candles, missal, and the Eucharistic vessels).

===Eastern Christian Rites===
====Byzantine Rite====
In Greek, the word () can mean an altar of any religion or, in a broader sense, the area surrounding it; that is to say, the entire sanctuary. In an Eastern Orthodox or a Byzantine Rite Eastern Catholic church this sanctuary includes both the area behind the iconostasis, and the soleas (the elevated projection in front of the iconostasis), and the ambo. It is also called the &quot;βῆμα&quot; (bema). When one enters the sanctuary, one is said to be going into the or . The altar itself in such a church may be referred to as either the “Holy Table” (Greek: ) or the “Throne” (Church Slavonic: ).

For both Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Eastern Catholics, the Holy Table (altar) is normally free-standing, although in very small sanctuaries it might be flush against the back wall for reasons of space. They are typically about one meter high, and may be made of stone or more often, wood. The exact dimensions may vary, but it is generally square in plan and of reasonable proportion with respect to the size of the sanctuary. It has five legs: one at each corner plus a central pillar for holding the relics placed within it at its consecration.A plain linen covering (Greek: , Slavonic: ) is bound to the Holy Table with cords; this is never removed once the altar is consecrated, and is considered to be its “baptismal garment”. The linen covering symbolizes the winding sheet which wrapped the body of Christ he was laid in the tomb. Since the altar is therefore never seen uncovered after this, it tends to be constructed more with sturdiness than aesthetics in mind. Above this first linen cover is a second, ornamented altar cloth (), often of a brocade in the liturgical color reflecting the feast or changing ecclesiastical season. This outer covering usually reaches the floor and represents the glory of God’s Throne. Many churches place a dust cover on the Holy Table between use, and it is often a simple red cloth or richer material. Sometimes, the cloth covers only the Gospel Book or the front half of the Holy Table, but it may be large enough to cover the entire Holy Table and items on it, including liturgical candlesticks and the seven-branched candelabra.

Atop the altar is the tabernacle (), a miniature shrine sometimes built in the form of a church, inside of which is a small ark containing the reserved sacrament for use in communing the sick. Also kept on the altar is the Gospel Book, under which is the &quot;antimension,&quot; a silken cloth imprinted with an icon of Christ being prepared for burial, with a relic sewn into it and the signature of the bishop. The Divine Liturgy must be served on an antimension, even if the altar is consecrated and contains relics. A simpler cloth called the is wrapped around the antimension to protect it, and symbolizes the “napkin” tied around the face of Jesus when he was laid in the tomb (thus a companion to the ). When not in use, the antimension is left in the center of the Holy Table, and is never removed unless necessary.

The Holy Table may only be touched by ordained members of the higher clergy and nothing unconsecrated nor the object of veneration should be placed on it. Objects may also be placed on the altar as part of setting them aside for sacred use. For example, icons are usually blessed by laying them on the Holy Table for a period of time or for a certain number of Divine Liturgies before sprinkling them with holy water, and enshrining them wherever they will be venerated. The &quot;Epitaphios&quot; on Good Friday, and the Cross on the Feasts of the Cross, are also placed on the Holy Table before they are taken to the center of the church to be venerated by the faithful.

In place of a fabric outer covering, some altars have a permanent, solid cover which may be highly ornamented, richly carved, or even plated in precious metals. A smaller brocade cover is placed on this if the colour of the altar decoration is meant to reflect the liturgical season.

The Holy Table is the place for offering the Eucharist, where bread and wine are offered to God the Father and the Holy Spirit is invoked to make his Son Jesus Christ present in the Gifts. It is also where presiding clergy stand at any service, even when no Eucharist is being celebrated and no offering is made other than prayer. When the priest reads the Gospel during Matins (or an All-Night Vigil) on Sunday, he reads it standing in front of the Holy Table, because it represents the Tomb of Christ, and the Gospel lessons for Sunday Matins are always one of the Resurrection appearances of Jesus.

On the northern side of the sanctuary stands another, smaller altar, known as the Table of Oblation ( or ) at which the Liturgy of Preparation takes place. On it are prepared the bread and wine before the Divine Liturgy. The Prothesis symbolizes the cave at Bethlehem and also the Anointing Stone at which the Body of Christ was prepared after the Deposition from the Cross. A new Table of Oblation is also blessed, sprinkled with holy water, and vested at the consecration of a church, but no relics placed within. Nothing other than sacred vessels, veils, etc. used in the Liturgy of Preparation may be placed on the Table of Oblation. The Epitaphios and Cross are also placed on the Table of Oblation before the priest and deacon solemnly transfer these to the Holy Table. In addition to higher clergy, subdeacons are permitted to touch the Table of Oblation, but no one of lesser rank may do so. This is where a deacon will consume any remaining Gifts (Body and Blood of Christ) after the Divine Liturgy and perform the ablutions.

====Syro-Maronite Church====
The Syriac Maronite Church and other Syriac Churches have freestanding altars in most cases, so priests and deacons can circumambulate these with processions and incensations. Traditionally, the Maronite liturgy was offered with the priest and people facing East, but because of modern Liturgical Latinisation, it is common for Maronite liturgies to be offered with the priest on the other side of the altar and facing the people, in imitation of modern practices in the Latin Church.

===Oriental Rites===

==== Armenian Rite ====
In the Armenian Rite the altar is placed against the eastern wall of the church, often in an apse. The shape of the altar is usually rectangular, similar to Latin altars, but is unusual in that it will normally have several steps on top of the table, on which are placed the tabernacle, candles, ceremonial fans, a cross, and the Gospel Book. The altar is often located upon a kind of stage above a row of icons.

==== Alexandrian Rite ====
Altars in the Alexandrian (Coptic Orthodox Church) tradition must have a square face upon which to offer the sacrifice. As the standard Coptic liturgy requires the priest to encircle the altar, it is never attached to any wall. Most Coptic altars are located under a baldachin.

==== Ethiopic Rite ====
In Ethiopian Orthodox Church tradition an icon is placed upon but towards the rear of the altar. It is away from the wall as in the Coptic tradition.

==== West Syriac Rite ====
In the West Syriac Tradition, churches have altars in the eastern part of the sanctuary.

==== East Syriac ====
Altars of East Syriac Rite are similar in appearance to Armenian altars only they are not placed on a stage.

==== Indian Orthodox ====
Altars are often heavily decorated in the Indian tradition. In Malayalam Altar is called Madbah 

===War altar===

A war altar was a mobile altar on which Mass was celebrated before a battle. The ultimate example is the carroccio of the medieval Italian city states, which was a four-wheeled mobile shrine pulled by oxen and sporting a flagpole and a bell. The carroccio also served as the army standard.

Altar stones were used by army chaplains of the Latin Church in the period leading up to the 20th century.

==Hinduism==
In Hinduism, altars generally contain pictures or statues of deities. Large, ornate altars are found in Hindu temples, while smaller altars are found in homes and sometimes also in Hindu-run shops and restaurants. The word for temple is (), the altar as hypostatised temple.
In South Indian temples, often each deity will have a separate shrine, each contained in a miniature house (specifically, a &quot;mandir&quot;). These shrines are often scattered around the temple compound, with the three main ones being in the main area. The statue of the deity (murti) is placed on a stone pedestal in the shrine, and one or more lamps are hung in the shrine. There is usually a space to put the puja tray (tray with worship offerings). Directly outside the main shrine, there will be a statue of the deity&#x27;s vahana or vehicle. The shrines have curtains hung over the entrances, and wooden doors which are shut when the deities are sleeping. Some South Indian temples have one main altar, with several statues placed upon it.
North Indian temples generally have one main altar at the front of the temple room. In some temples, the front of the room is separated with walls and several altars are placed in the alcoves. The statues on the altars are usually in pairs, each deity with their consort (Radha-Krishna, Sita-Rama, Shiva-Parvati). However, some deities, such as Ganesha and Hanuman, are placed alone. Ritual items such as flowers or lamps may be placed on the altar.

Home shrines can be as simple or as elaborate as the householder can afford. Large, ornate shrines can be purchased in India and countries with large Hindu minorities, like Malaysia and Singapore. They are usually made of wood and have tiled floors for statues to be placed upon. Pictures may be hung on the walls of the shrine. The top of the shrine may have a series of levels, like a gopuram tower on a temple. Each Hindu altar will have at least one oil lamp and may contain a tray with puja equipment as well. Hindus with large houses will set aside one room as their puja room, with the altar at one end of it. Some South Indians also place a shrine with pictures of their departed relatives on the right side of the room, and make offerings to them before making offerings to the gods.

==Taoism==

Taoist altars are erected to honor traditional deities and the spirits of ancestors. Taoist altars may be erected in temples or in private homes. Strict traditions and different sects describe the items offered and the ritual involved in the temples, but folk custom in the homes is much freer.

Imperial dynasties built huge altars called () to perform various offering ceremonies called (). The Temple of Heaven in Beijing is one of those.

Nearly all forms of Chinese traditional religion involve ()--bowing towards an altar, with a stick of incense in one&#x27;s hand. (Some schools prescribe the use of three sticks of incense in the hand at one time.) This may be done at home, or in a temple, or outdoors; by an ordinary person, or a professional (such as a Taoist priest); and the altar may feature any number of deities or ancestral tablets. is usually done in accordance with certain dates of the lunar/solar calendar (see Chinese calendar).

At certain dates, food may be set out as a sacrifice to the gods or spirits of the departed. (See, for example, Qingming Festival and Ghost Festival.) This may include rice, slaughtered pigs and ducks, or fruit. Another form of sacrifice involves the burning of Hell Bank Notes, on the assumption that images thus consumed by the fire will reappear—not as a mere image, but as the actual item—in the spirit world, and be available for the departed spirit to use. In Taoist folk religion, sometimes chickens, pigs&#x27; feet, and pig heads are given as offerings. But in orthodox Daoist practice, offerings should essentially be incense, candles and vegetarian offerings.

==Buddhism==


In Buddhist-following cultures, structures such as , butsudan, or spirit houses are found in temples or homes. In Japan, the butsudan is a wooden cabinet with doors that enclose and protect a religious image of the Buddha or the Bodhisattvas (typically in the form of a statue) or a mandala scroll, installed in the highest place of honor and centered. The doors are opened to display the image during religious observances. A butsudan usually contains subsidiary religious items—called &quot;butsugu&quot;—such as candlesticks, incense burners, bells, and platforms for placing offerings such as fruit. Some sects place &quot;ihai&quot;, memorial tablets for deceased relatives, within or near the butsudan. Butsudans are often decorated with flowers.

The shrine is placed in the temple or home as a place of worship to the Buddha, the Law of the Universe, etc. Scrolls (&quot;honzon&quot;) or statues are placed in the butsudan and prayed to morning and evening. Zen Buddhists also meditate before the butsudan.

The original design for the butsudan began in India, where people built altars as an offering-place to the Buddha. When Buddhism came to China and Korea statues of the Buddha were placed on pedestals or platforms. The Chinese and Koreans built walls and doors around the statues to shield them from the weather and also adapted elements of their respective indigenous religions. They could then safely offer their prayers, incense, etc. to the statue or scroll without it falling and breaking.

==Shinto==

In Shinto, altars are found in shrines. Originating in ancient times, are temporarily erected sacred spaces or &quot;altars&quot; used as a locus of worship. A physical area is demarcated with branches of green bamboo or at the four corners, between which are strung sacred border ropes (). In the center of the area a large branch of festooned with sacred emblems () is erected as a &quot;yorishiro&quot;, a physical representation of the presence of the kami and toward which rites of worship are performed.

In more elaborate cases, a may be constructed by placing a rough straw mat upon the ground, then erecting a ceremonial eight-legged stand () upon the mat, and decorating the stand with a frame festooned with sacred border ropes and sacred border emblems. Finally the branch is erected in the center of this stand as the focus of worship.

==Norse paganism==
A basic altar, called a , was used for sacrifice in Norse paganism. The was constructed of piled stones, possibly in a wood (harrow), and would be used in sacrifices and perhaps other ceremonies as well.

A possible use of the during a sacrifice would be to place upon it a bowl of the blood of an animal sacrificed to a Norse deity (e.g. a goat for Thor, a sow for Freyja, a boar for Freyr), then dipping a bundle of fir twigs into it and sprinkling the participants with the blood. This would consecrate the attendees to the ceremony, such as a wedding.

===Asatru===
In Nordic Modern Pagan practice, altars may be set up in the home or in wooded areas in imitation of the hörgr of ancient times. They may be dedicated to Thor, Odin, or other Nordic deities.

==Neopaganism==
In neopaganism there is a wide variety of ritual practice, running the gamut from a very eclectic syncretism to strict polytheistic reconstructionism. Many of these groups make use of altars. Some are constructed merely of rough-hewn or stacked stone, and some are made of fine wood or other finished material.

===Wicca===
===Neo-Druidism===
Modern Neo-Druidism may also make use of altars, often erected in groves. Though little is known of the specific religious beliefs and practices presided over by the ancient Druids, modern people who identify themselves as Druids are free to incorporate their imagination in developing ceremonies and the use of ritual objects in keeping with their belief system. The &quot;Order of Common Worship&quot; of the Reformed Druids of North America&#x27; &quot;Liturgy of the Druids&quot; calls for a fire to be started &quot;in or near the altar&quot; and makes use of various objects such as a chalice, staves, and a plant offering. If no altar is used, the objects may be placed on the ground.

==High places==

High places are elevated areas on which altars have been erected for worship in the belief that, as they were nearer heaven than the plains and valleys, they are more favourable places for prayer. High places were prevalent in almost all ancient cultures as centers of cultic worship.

High places in Israelite (Hebrew: &quot;Bamah&quot;, or &quot;Bama&quot;) or Canaanite culture were open-air shrines, usually erected on an elevated site. Prior to the conquest of Canaan by the Israelites in the the high places served as shrines of the Canaanite fertility deities, the Baals (Lords) and the Asherot (Semitic goddesses). In addition to an altar, &quot;matzevot&quot; (stone pillars representing the presence of the divine) were erected.

The practice of worship on these spots became frequent among the Hebrews, though after the temple was built it was forbidden. Such worship was with difficulty abolished, though denounced time after time by the prophets as an affront to God. A closely related example is a &quot;backyard&quot; altar, so to speak. Before there was a set temple and an established altar people built their own altars. After the temple was built use of these altars was forbidden. Unlike the case of high places, &quot;backyard&quot; altar worship was quickly eradicated. In following years, the practice drastically decreased in popularity.

<text>Amalek (; ) is described in the Hebrew Bible as the enemy nation of the Israelites. The name &quot;Amalek&quot; can refer to the descendants of Amalek, the grandson of Esau, or anyone who lived in their territories in Canaan, or North African descendants of Ham, the son of Noah.

==Etymology==
Most scholars regard the origin of the term, &quot;Amalek&quot; to be unknown but in some rabbinical interpretations, it is etymologized as , &#x27;a people who lick (blood)&#x27;.

Richard C. Steiner has suggested that the name is derived from the Egyptian term &quot;*ꜥꜣm rqj&quot; &quot;hostile Asiatic&quot;, possibly referring to Shasu tribesmen from around Edom.

==In the Hebrew Bible==

According to the Hebrew Bible, Amalek was the son of Eliphaz (himself the son of Esau, ancestor of the Edomites and the brother of Israel) and Eliphaz&#x27;s concubine Timna. Timna was a Horite and sister of Lotan. According to a midrash, Timna was a princess who tried to convert to Judaism. However, she was rejected by Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. She replied she would rather be a handmaiden to the dregs of Israel than be a mistress of another gentile nation. To punish the Patriarchs for their attitudes, God caused Timna to give birth to Amalek, whose descendants would cause Israel much distress. Amalek was also the product of an incestuous union since Eliphaz was Timna&#x27;s stepfather, according to 1 Chronicles 1:36, after he committed adultery with the wife of Seir the Horite, who was Timna&#x27;s biological father. First-century Roman-Jewish scholar and historian Flavius Josephus refers to Amalek as a &quot;bastard&quot; () in a derogatory sense.
===Amalekites===
Amalek is described in Genesis 36:16 as the &quot;chief of Amalek&quot; among the &quot;chiefs of the sons of Esau&quot;, from which it is surmised that he ruled a clan or territory named after him. In the oracle of Balaam, Amalek was called the &quot;first of the nations&quot;. One modern scholar believes this attests to Amalek&#x27;s high antiquity, while traditional commentator Rashi states: &quot;He came before all of them to make war with Israel&quot;. The Amalekites () were claimed to be Amalek&#x27;s descendants through the genealogy of Esau.

According to the Hebrew Bible, the Amalekites inhabited the Negev and Sinai. They appear to have lived a nomadic or seminomadic lifestyle along the fringes of southern Canaan&#x27;s agricultural zone. This is probably based on the association of this tribal group with the steppe region of ancient Israel and the area of Kadesh (Genesis 14:7).

As a people, the Amalekites are identified throughout the Hebrew Bible as a recurrent enemy of the Israelites:

* In Exodus 17:8–16, during the Exodus from Egypt, the Amalekites ambush the Israelites encamped at Rephidim, but are defeated. Moses orders Joshua to lead the Israelites into battle, while Moses, Aaron and Hur watch from a nearby hill. When Moses&#x27; hands holding his staff are raised, the Israelites prevail, but when his hands are lowered, the Israelites falter. He sits with his hands held up by Aaron and Hur until sunset, securing the Israelite victory.
* In Deuteronomy 25:17–19, The Israelites are specifically commanded to &quot;blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven&quot; once they have taken possession of the Promised Land in retribution for &quot;what Amalek did to [them] on the way as [they] were coming out of Egypt&quot;, a reference to the Amalekite ambush on the Israelites at Rephidim. Earlier, in Deuteronomy 7:1–16 and Deuteronomy 25:16–18, they are commanded to utterly destroy all the inhabitants of the idolatrous cities in the promised land and their livestock; scripture purports that King Saul ultimately loses favor with Yahweh for failing to kill King Agag and the best livestock of the Amalekites in 1 Samuel 15 in defiance of these commandments.
* In Numbers 14:45, the Amalekites and Canaanites kill a group of Israelites that tried to enter the hill country of the Amorites without Moses&#x27;s permission.
* In Judges 3:13, Amalek, and their Moabite and Ammonite allies, defeat Israel so that the Moabites could oppress them. Judges 10:11–13 confirms Amalek as being one of the many oppressors of Israel. 
* In Judges 6:1–6, Amalek, and their Midianite allies, destroy Israelite farms &quot;as far as Gaza&quot;, inducing a famine. They also help the Midianites wage wars against Israel, according to Judges 6:32–34 and Judges 7:11–13.
* In 1 Samuel 15:1–9, Samuel identifies Amalek as the enemy of Israelites, saying &quot;Thus says the Lord of hosts: I will punish Amalek for what he did to Israel, how he ambushed him on the way when he came up from Egypt,&quot; a reference to Exodus. God then commands Saul to destroy the Amalekites, by killing man, woman, infant and suckling. This massacre is believed to be a retelling of the raids in 1 Samuel 14:48, although it additionally specifies that it occurred in the &quot;city of Amalek&quot;, which was believed to be the &quot;principal place of arms&quot; or the &quot;metropolis&quot; of Amalek. In 1 Samuel 15:33, Samuel identifies King Agag of Amalek as an enemy and killer, saying &quot;As your sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women.&quot;
* In 1 Samuel 27:8–9, David and his men conduct raids against the Amalekites and their Geshurite and Gezirite allies. He kills every man and woman but takes sheep, cattle, donkey, camels, and clothing. These Amalekites were theorized to be refugees who fled from Saul or a separate Amalekite faction that dwelt to the south of Israel. Gili Kluger believes these narratives were anti-Saul propaganda, designed to make him appear weak compared to David, since no losses were attributed to David.
* According to 1 Samuel 30:1–2, the Amalekites invaded the Negev and Ziklag in the Judean/Philistine border area towards the end of the reign of King Saul, burning Ziklag and taking its citizens away into captivity. David led a successful mission against the Amalekites to recover &quot;all that the Amalekites had carried away&quot;. 
* In 2 Samuel 1:5–10, an Amalekite tells David that he found Saul leaning on his spear after the battle of Gilboa. The Amalekite claims he euthanized Saul, at Saul&#x27;s request, and removed his crown. David gives orders to his men to kill the Amalekite for killing the anointed king, believing him to be guilty by admission.
* In 1 Chronicles 4:43, the Simeonites kill the remaining survivors of Amalek and live in their settlements. 
* In Psalm 83:7, Amalek joins Israel&#x27;s other historic enemies in annihilating Israel. Their attempts are thwarted by God. Although most scholars believe the passage refers to a real historical event, they are unsure which event it should be identified with. One likely answer is that it occurred during the rise of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, the 9th to 7th centuries BC.

==Interpretation==
===Judaism===
In the &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot;, Rambam derives three commandments, two positive and one negative, related to references to Amalek in the Torah:
Many rabbinic authorities such as Maimonides ruled that the commandment only applies to a Jewish king or an organized community, and cannot be performed by an individual. According to Rashi, the Amalekites were sorcerers who could transform themselves to resemble animals, in order to avoid capture. Thus, in , it was considered necessary to destroy the livestock when destroying Amalek. According to Haggahot Maimuniyyot, the commandment only applies to the future messianic era and not in present times; this limitation is widely supported by medieval authorities. According to the Midrash, every nation on Earth has a guardian angel overseeing its destiny, except for two: Israel rejected archangel Michael as its guardian, in favor of God himself. The other is Amalek, since its guardian angel is the foremost angel of evil, Satan. The final war therefore will be fought between the children of God and the children of Satan, between good and evil. This is possibly why the 188th commandment exists, to wipe out Amalek completely, male and female, young and old, sparing none, since evil has no future. There is however, one obscure prophecy that states that all nations will eventually worship God alone, which raises the question of how can there possibly be a third temple when Amalek is wiped out. The Midrash states there is no quandry, given the last Amalekite is a convert to Judaism.

Maimonides elaborates that when the Jewish people wage war against Amalek, they must request the Amalekites to accept the Seven Laws of Noah and pay a tax to the Jewish kingdom. If they refuse, they are to be executed.

Other Talmudic commentators argued that the calls to spare no Amalekite or &quot;blot out their memory&quot; were metaphorical and did not require the actual killing of Amalekites. Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch said that the command was to destroy &quot;the remembrance of Amalek&quot; rather than actual Amalekites. The Sfat Emet interpreted the command as fully hating Amalek, without performing any physical action. The Chofetz Chaim said that God would perform the elimination of Amalek and that Jews only need to remember what Amalek did to them.

Isaac S.D. Sassoon believes that the &quot;cherem&quot; commands existed to prevent the Jewish community from being endangered but believes people should think twice before literally following them. Nathan Lopes Cardazo argues that the Torah&#x27;s ethically questionable laws were intentional since they were a result of God working with an underdeveloped world. He believes that God appointed the Sages to help humanity evolve in their understanding of the Torah.

=== Christianity ===
Theologian Charles Ellicott explains that the Amalekites were subject to &quot;cherem&quot; in the Book of Samuel for the purposes of incapacitation, due to their &#x27;accursed&#x27; nature and the threat they posed to the commonwealth of surrounding nations. Matthew Henry considers the &quot;cherem&quot; to be defensive warfare since the Amalekites were invaders. John Gill describes the cherem as the law of retaliation being carried out.

According to Christian Hofreiter, almost all Christian authorities and theologians have historically interpreted the &quot;cherem&quot; passages literally. He states that &quot;there is practically no historical evidence that anyone in the Great Church&quot; viewed them as being purely an allegory. In particular, Augustine, Thomas Aquinas and John Calvin have defended a literal reading of these passages at length. Origen of Alexandria is sometimes cited as having viewed the &quot;cherem&quot; passages allegorically; Hofreiter argues that although Origen prioritized a spiritual interpretation of the Bible, he did not deny that the &quot;herem&quot; passages described historical events.

Paul Copan argues that the &quot;cherem&quot; commands were hyperbolic since the passages contain merisms such as &quot;man and woman&quot; and Near Easterners valued &quot;bravado and exaggeration&quot; when reporting warfare. Kluger believes this is an earnest attempt to absolve the Israelites, and their God, of moral responsibility. Nonetheless, she argues Copan&#x27;s interpretation still &quot;normalizes mass violence&quot; and &quot;hostility towards targeted groups&quot;.

=== Islam ===
Ibn Khaldūn believed that God ordered Saul, the king of Israel, to depose the Amalekites, which caused Haman&#x27;s hostility to the Jews in the Book of Esther.

===Modern academia===
Some commentators have discussed the ethics of the commandment to exterminate all the Amalekites, including children, and the presumption of collective punishment. It has also been described as genocidal, according to genocide scholars like Norman Naimark.

Kluger believes that the extermination verses can be explained by the Israelites seeing the Amalekites as their &quot;unwelcome brother&quot; and the &quot;rejected son&quot;, possessing all the negative qualities that the Israelites inherently saw within themselves, which Kluger sees as a form of self-hatred. However, she notes that the Hebrew Bible is surprisingly neutral when describing the Amalekites and that the texts do not provide an adequate explanation on why they were singled out for complete annihilation, compared to the Egyptians and Canaanites for example.

Ada Taggar-Cohen observes that &quot;cherem&quot; commands were not uncommon in the ancient Near East. Their purpose was to show that the deity was on the aggressor&#x27;s side and that the enemy deserved said deity&#x27;s wrath for their &quot;sins&quot;. It also allowed kings to pursue militarist policies without taking moral responsibility.

C. L. Crouch considers the &quot;cherem&quot; commands to be an exceptional component to Israelite and Judahite warfare since they were erratically applied, even in the early stages of national and ethnic identity formation. They were an extreme means to eradicate the threat of chaos. Similar attitudes were held by Assyrian rulers such as Esarhaddon and Assurbanipal.

No reference to Amalek or the Amalekites has been found in surviving Egyptian and Assyrian monumental inscriptions and records, even though both groups recorded various tribes and peoples of the Levant in the relevant time period(s). Therefore, Hugo Winckler concluded that there were no Amalekites and that the Biblical stories concerning them were entirely ahistorical and mythological. Although archaeological research has improved knowledge about nomadic Arabs, no specific artifact or site has been linked to Amalek with certainty.

It is possible that some of the fortified settlements in the Negev highlands and Tel Masos, which is near Beer-sheba and possibly equivalent to Hormah, have Amalekite connections. If this hypothesis is correct, it is likely that Saul&#x27;s anti-Amalekite campaigns were motivated by a strategic desire to wrest control of copper production at Tel Masos. Copper was valuable to the early Israelites and their theology and ritual.

Archaeological evidence from the Tell el-Qudeirat fortress and Horvat Haluqim in the Negev, dated to the late 11th to early 10th century BC, could corroborate with the Biblical Israelite-Amalekite confrontations, during the reigns of Saul and David. Bruins discovered that their inhabitants were semi-nomadic agro-pastoralists. They lived in tents, rode camels, participated in the copper trade and worshipped gods at masseboth shrines. Oval fortresses were built during the relevant timeframe. However, other scholars argue that these settlements were inhabited by Edomites or Simeonites.

===Alternative theories of origin ===

In , the &quot;field of the Amalekites&quot; is mentioned, but the person who is named Amalek was not born yet.

Some commentators claim that this passage is a reference to the territory which was later inhabited by the Amalekites. C. Knight elaborates this concept by making a comparison: one might say &quot;Caesar went into France&quot;, though Gaul only later became known as France.

John Gill believes the Amalekites of were equivalent to the Hamite-Arabian Amalekites described by Muslim scholars. He argues the Amalekites were always allied with the Canaanites who descended from Ham, were conquered by the Shemite Chedorlaomer, existed before the Edomite Amalekites thus affirming , and that the Edomites never rescued these Amalekites from Saul&#x27;s campaigns due to inter-tribal feuds.

By the 19th century, many Western theologians believed that the nation of Amalek could have flourished before the time of Abraham. Matthew George Easton theorized that the Amalekites were not the descendants of Amalek by taking a literal approach to . However, the modern biblical scholar Gerald L. Mattingly uses textual analysis to glean that the use of &quot;Amalekite&quot; in is actually an anachronism, and in the early 19th century, Richard Watson enumerated several speculative reasons for the existence of a &quot;more ancient Amalek&quot; than Abraham.

In his exegesis of , concerning Balaam&#x27;s utterance: &quot;Amalek was the first one of the nations, but his end afterward will be even his perishing&quot;, Richard Watson attempts to associate this passage to the &quot;first one of the nations&quot; that developed post-Flood. According to Samuel Cox, the Amalekites were the &quot;first&quot; in their hostility toward the Israelites.

==Abrahamic traditions==

=== Jewish traditions ===
Amalek is the archetypal enemy of the Jews and the symbol of evil in Jewish religion and folklore. Nur Masalha, Elliot Horowitz, and Josef Stern suggest that the Amalekites represent an &quot;eternally irreconciliable enemy&quot; that wants to murder Jews. In post-biblical times, Jews associated contemporary enemies with Amalek or Haman and, occasionally, believed pre-emptive violence is acceptable against such enemies. Groups identified with Amalek include the Romans, Nazis, Stalinists, ISIS, and bellicose Iranian leaders such as Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. More metaphorically, to some Hasidic rabbis (particularly the Baal Shem Tov), Amalek represents atheism or the cynical rejection of God, which leads to unethical hedonism. This is sometimes known as the &quot;Amalekite doctrine&quot;. In contemporary times, religious Jews associate Amalek with violent antisemites, nihilism and Jewish doubt in God.

During the Purim festival, the Book of Esther is read in commemoration of the salvation of Jewish people from Haman, who plotted to kill all Jews in Persian Empire. It is customary for the audience to make noise and shout whenever &quot;Haman&quot; is mentioned, in order to desecrate his name, based on . It is also customary to recite on the Shabbat before Purim. This was because Haman was considered to be an Amalekite although this label is more likely to be symbolic rather than literal. Some Iranophilic Jews interpreted Haman&#x27;s Amalekite background as being anathema to both Jews and &#x27;pure-blooded Iranians&#x27;.

=== Christian traditions ===
Early Church fathers such as Justin Martyr, Irenaeus and Cyprian consider the defeat of Amalek in to be reminiscent of Jesus defeating the powers of the devil at the cross. Origen sees the battle as an allegory of the Law mysteriously invoking Christ, who recruits strong people (i.e. Christians) to defeat the demonic Strong Man, as described in .

John Gill believes that Amalek is a type of antichrist that &#x27;raises his hand against the throne of God, his tabernacle and his saints&#x27;. He believes the phrase &quot;from generation to generation&quot; in specifically refers to the Messianic Age, where Amalek and other antichristian states are exterminated by the Lamb. Likewise, Charles Ellicott notes that the Amalekites were collectively called &#x27;the sinners&#x27; in , which was only used elsewhere for the Sodomites in .

Carl Friedrich Keil and Franz Delitzsch state that the Amalekites were extinct by the second half of Hezekiah&#x27;s reign.

Professor Philip Jenkins notes that Christian extremists have historically labelled enemies such as Native Americans, Protestants, Catholics and Tutsis as Amalekites to justify their genocides. Jews and victims of the Crusades were also called Amalekites. Because of this, modern Christian scholars have re-examined the Biblical narratives that inspired these atrocities using philology, literary analysis, archaeology and historical evidence.

=== Islamic traditions ===
Islamic commentators believe the Amalekites were an ancient Arabian tribe. The monotheistic Ishmaelites evangelized to them in Mecca and later, supplanted their population. However, the paganism of the Amalekites and other Arabian tribes negatively influenced the Ishmaelites, including their approach to the Kaaba.

Adam J. Silverstein observes that most of the medieval Muslim world ignored the Book of Esther or modified its details, despite their familiarity with the Persian Jewish community. This was caused by their attempt to reconcile the Biblical Esther with the Quranic Haman, who was the antagonist of the Exodus narrative, and Persian mythological historical traditions. Notable exceptions include Ibn Khaldūn, who affirmed the Amalekite origins of Haman and his antisemitic vendetta.

==Modern usage==
Rabbis generally agree that Amalekites no longer exist, based on the argument that Sennacherib deported and mixed the nations, so it is no longer possible to determine who is an Amalekite.

Since the Holocaust, the phrase as it appears in is used as a call to witness. Yad Vashem, Israel&#x27;s memorial to the Holocaust, features the phrase on a banner, and in letters between European Jews during the Holocaust, they plead with each other to &quot;bear witness&quot;.

=== In modern Israel ===

In the Israel–Palestine conflict, some Israeli politicians and extremists have compared Palestinians to Amalek, stated that the Palestinians are the Amalekites or accuse Arabs of exhibiting &quot;behavior&quot; that is &quot;typical&quot; of Amalekites. Yasser Arafat was called &quot;the Amalek and Hitler of our generation&quot; by 200 rabbis. Many in the Gush Emunim movement see Arabs as the &quot;Amalek of today&quot;. One reason includes the belief that Amalek is any nation that prevents Jews from settling in the Land of Israel, which includes the Palestinians. During the 2014 Gaza war, a leading &quot;yeshiva&quot; identified Palestinians as the descendants of the ancient Amalekites and Philistines. Genealogically, Arabs are not related to Amalekites and prior to the Arab–Israeli conflict, some Jews associated Amalek with the Roman Empire and medieval Christians. 

During the 2023–24 Israel–Hamas war (beginning in October 2023), Benjamin Netanyahu said that the Israeli government was &quot;committed to completely eliminating this evil from the world&quot;, and he also stated: &quot;You must remember what Amalek has done to you, says our Holy Bible. And we do remember&quot;. At an argument to the International Court of Justice about allegations of genocide in the 2023 Israeli attack on Gaza, South Africa presented the comments as inciting genocide against the Palestinian people. Netanyahu denied that was his intention, stating the South African accusation reflected a &quot;deep historical ignorance&quot; since he was referring to Hamas, not Palestinians as a whole.

<doc id="68647" wikidata="Q2689456" url="?curid=68647" title="Amasa">
<text>Amasa (עמשא) or Amessai 
is a person mentioned in the Hebrew Bible. His mother was Abigail (), a sister of King David (). Hence, Amasa was a nephew of David, and cousin of Joab, David&#x27;s military commander, as well as a cousin of Absalom, David&#x27;s son. David calls him &quot;my bone and my flesh&quot; (). Amasa&#x27;s father was Jether (, ) who was also called Ithra (). Jether had dual-nationality, being an Ishmaelite and Israelite, although it might be a case of an assimilated Ishmaelite living in Israel. 

When Absalom rebelled against David and won over the tribes of Israel (), Absalom appointed Amasa as commander over the army (), in effect replacing Joab, who had served as commander for David.

After the revolt was crushed and Absalom died (), David was invited back to Jerusalem and restored as king. David re-appointed Amasa as his military commander in Joab&#x27;s stead &quot;from now on&quot; as his military commander (). Other versions translate this status differently: it is given as &quot;permanently&quot; in the Jewish Publication Society 1985 translation and &quot;for life&quot; in the New International Version.

David&#x27;s appointment of Amasa has been interpreted as &quot;a bold stroke of policy, to promise the post of commander-in chief to the general of the rebel army&quot;.

While being fiercely loyal to David, Joab was also suspicious of any potential rivals for Joab&#x27;s power or threats to David&#x27;s kingdom, and had no qualms about taking the lives of any who might stand in his way (e.g., Abner: , and Absalom: ). So it was not difficult for Joab to also decide to murder Amasa (, ). Joab&#x27;s own justification for killing Amasa may have been because he believed Amasa to be conspiring with Sheba son of Bichri the Benjamite, due to Amasa&#x27;s slowness to mobilize the army against Sheba&#x27;s rebels ().

<text>There were four biblical characters called Amasai ( &quot;burdensome&quot;, ).

The name is rarely used in modern Hebrew. Its only known contemporary appearance is in the first name of the poet and translator Amasai Levin. It is used less rarely as a Hebrew family name.
* Amasai the Levite, son of Elkanah, of the ancestry of Samuel (1 Chr. 6:25, 35).
* The leader of a body of men who joined David in the &quot;stronghold,&quot; probably of Adullam (1 Chr. 12:18).
* Amasai the priest who was appointed to precede the ark with blowing of trumpets on its removal from the house of Obed-edom (1 Chr. 15:24).
* Amasai, the father of a Levite, one of the two Kohathites who took a prominent part at the instance of Hezekiah in the cleansing of the temple (2 Chr. 29:12).</text><links>

<text>An ambassador is an official envoy, especially a high-ranking diplomat who represents a state and is usually accredited to another sovereign state or to an international organization as the resident representative of their own government or sovereign or appointed for a special and often temporary diplomatic assignment. The word is also used informally for people who are known, without national appointment, to represent certain professions, activities, and fields of endeavor, such as sales.

An ambassador is the ranking government representative stationed in a foreign capital or country. The host country typically allows the ambassador control of specific territory called an embassy (which may include an official residence and an office, chancery, located together or separately, generally in the host nation&#x27;s capital), whose territory, staff, and vehicles are generally afforded diplomatic immunity in the host country. Under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, an ambassador has the highest diplomatic rank. Countries may choose to maintain diplomatic relations at a lower level by appointing a chargé d&#x27;affaires in place of an ambassador.

The equivalent to an ambassador exchanged among members of the Commonwealth of Nations are known as High Commissioners. The ambassadors of the Holy See are known as Apostolic Nuncios.

==Etymology==
The term is derived from Middle English &quot;ambassadour&quot;, Anglo-French &quot;ambassateur&quot;; akin to Old High German &quot;ambaht&quot;, &quot;service&quot;. The first known usage of the term was recorded around the 14th century.

== Purposes ==
The foreign government to which an ambassador is assigned must first approve the person. In some cases, the foreign government might reverse its approval by declaring the diplomat a &quot;persona non grata&quot;, i.e. an unacceptable person. This kind of declaration usually results in recalling the ambassador to their home nation. In accordance with the Congress of Vienna of 1815 and the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, the ambassador and embassy staff are granted diplomatic immunity and personal safety while living abroad.

=== Protect citizens ===
Due to the advent of modern technologies, today&#x27;s world is a much smaller place in relative terms. With this in mind, it is considered important that the nations of the world have at least a small staff living in foreign capitals in order to aid travelers and visitors from their home nation. As an officer of the foreign service, an ambassador is expected to protect the citizens of their home country in the host country.

=== Support prosperity ===
Another result of the increase in foreign travel is the growth of trade between nations. For most countries, the national economy is now part of the global economy. This means increased opportunities to sell and trade with other nations. When two nations are conducting a trade, it is usually advantageous to both parties to have an ambassador and perhaps a small staff living in the other land, where they act as an intermediary between cooperative businesses.

=== Work for peace ===
One of the cornerstones of foreign diplomatic missions is to work for peace. This task can grow into a fight against international terrorism, the drug trade, international bribery, and human trafficking. Ambassadors help stop these acts, helping people across the globe. These activities are important and sensitive and are usually carried out in coordination with the Defense Ministry of the state and the head of the nation.

== Rise of modern diplomacy==

Also before the rise of modern diplomatic relations, sovereign states - which traded with each other, went to war and made peace – had the need for diplomatic relations, which took various forms. For example, the city states of Classical Greece used the system of Proxeny, whereby a Proxenos – who was a citizen of the host city rather than of the city whose interests he promoted - fulfilled some of the functions given to modern Ambassadors and Consuls.


The rise of the modern diplomatic system was a product of the Italian Renaissance (from around AD 1300). The use of ambassadors became a political strategy in Italy during the 15th century. The political changes in Italy altered the role of ambassadors in diplomatic affairs. Because many of the states in Italy were small, they were particularly vulnerable to larger states. The ambassador system was used to disperse information and to protect the more vulnerable states.

This practice then spread to Europe during the Italian Wars. The use and creation of ambassadors during the 15th century in Italy has had long-term effects on Europe and, in turn, the world&#x27;s diplomatic and political progression. Europe still uses the same terms of ambassador rights as they had established in the 16th century, concerning the rights of the ambassadors in host countries as well as the proper diplomatic procedures. An ambassador was used as a representative of the state in which they are from to negotiate and disseminate information in order to keep peace and establish relationships with other states. This attempt was employed in the effort to maintain peaceful relations with nations and make alliances during difficult times.

The use of ambassadors today is widespread. States and non-state actors use diplomatic representatives to deal with any problems that occur within the international system. Ambassadors now normally live overseas or within the country to which it is assigned for long periods of time so that they are acquainted with the culture and local people. This way they are more politically effective and trusted, enabling them to accomplish goals that their host country desires.

== Ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary ==
The Congress of Vienna of 1815 formalized the system of diplomatic rank under international law, distinguishing between three hierarchical descending categories of diplomatic representatives: full ambassadors (including legates or &quot;nuntii&quot;), accredited to heads of state; envoys or ministers, who were also accredited to heads of state; and finally chargés d’affaires, who were accredited to minister of foreign affairs.

The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961, which took effect in 1964 and is still in force, modified the system. According to it, ambassadors are diplomats of the highest rank, formally representing their head of state, with plenipotentiary powers (i.e. full authority to represent the government). In modern usage, most ambassadors on foreign postings as head of mission carry the full title of Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary. The distinction between extraordinary and ordinary ambassadors was common when not all ambassadors resided in the country to which they are assigned, often serving only for a specific purpose or mission.

The &quot;ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary&quot; being historically regarded as the personal representative of the sovereign, the custom of dispatching ambassadors to the head of state rather than the government has persisted. For example, ambassadors to and from the United Kingdom are accredited to or from the Royal Court of St James&#x27;s. Ambassadors hold the highest diplomatic rank and have precedence over &quot;chargés d&#x27;affaires&quot;, who are accredited by the foreign minister. Ambassadors also outranked envoys until the 1960s, when the last legations were upgraded to embassies.

Because members of the Commonwealth of Nations have or had a common head of state, they do not exchange ambassadors, but instead have High Commissioners, who represent the government, rather than the head of state. The diplomat representing the Holy See is titled a nuncio. In diplomatic usage, both the high commissioner and nuncio are considered equivalent in rank and role to an ambassador; high commissioners, like ambassadors, carry the full title of &quot;High Commissioner Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary&quot;, but nuncios do not. Resident Coordinators within the United Nations system are accredited to the Head of State and have the same rank as ambassador.

Ambassadors carry formal letters of credence from their head of state, addressed to the host country&#x27;s head of state. Because many Commonwealth countries have the same head of state, the accreditation of a High Commissioner is in the form of a simple and often informal letter of introduction from one head of government (Prime Minister) to that of another. The difference in accreditation is also reflected in the formal titles of envoys to foreign and Commonwealth states: e.g., British High Commissioners are formally titled &quot;The High Commissioner for His Majesty&#x27;s Government in the United Kingdom&quot;, whereas British Ambassadors to foreign countries are known as &quot;His Britannic Majesty&#x27;s Ambassador&quot;. 

== Ambassador-at-large ==

An ambassador-at-large is a diplomat of the highest rank or a minister who is accredited to represent their country. But unlike the ambassador-in-residence, who is usually limited to a country or embassy, the ambassador-at-large can be appointed to operate in several usually neighbouring countries, a region or sometimes a seat of international organizations such as the United Nations or European Union. In some cases, an ambassador-at-large may even be specifically assigned a role to advise and assist the state or government in particular issues.

Historically, presidents or prime ministers have commissioned special diplomatic envoys for specific assignments, primarily overseas but sometimes also within the country as ambassadors-at-large.

==Title==
While the title generally reflects the ambassador&#x27;s second head position as head of a diplomatic mission, in some countries the term may also represent a rank held by career diplomats, as a matter of internal promotion, regardless of the posting, and in many national careers it is quite common for them to be appointed to other functions, especially within the ministry/ministries in charge of foreign affairs, in some countries in systematic alternation with actual postings.

The formal form of address for an ambassador is generally the form that would be used to address a head of state: &quot;(Your/His/Her) Excellency&quot; followed by name or the country represented. In many countries, less formal variations are frequently used, such as &quot;Ambassador&quot; followed by name, or the name followed by &quot;Ambassador of...&quot;. In the United States, &quot;Mister/Madam Ambassador&quot; may be used.

In some countries, a former ambassador may continue to be styled and addressed as ambassador throughout their life (in the United States, &quot;Mr. Ambassador&quot; or &quot;Madam Ambassador&quot; may be heard). In other countries, ambassador is a title that accrues to its holder only with respect to a specific position, and may not be used after leaving or beyond the position. Some countries do not use the term while an ambassador is in the home country, as the officeholder is not an ambassador there; for example, a Canadian ambassador while in Canada is not generally addressed as ambassador, although they may be referred to as &quot;Canadian ambassador to ...&quot;; that is, with reference to a specific job function; the person is addressed or styled as ambassador only while holding such office.

==Non-diplomatic ambassadorships==
In a less formal sense, the phrase is used for high-profile non-diplomatic representatives of various entities (rarely states), mainly cultural and charitable organizations, often as willing figureheads to attract media attention; for example, film and pop stars make appeals to the public at large for United Nations activities, sometimes during press-swarmed visits in the foreign country. Public figures are sometimes nominated or invited to endorse events designated as ambassadors, brand ambassadors, and goodwill ambassadors. 

Many times, international agencies like United Nations also appoint ambassadors to achieve the objectives of a particular mission, like the appointment of goodwill ambassador Bollywood film actress Priyanka Chopra for UNICEF. Japan adopted the cartoon character Hello Kitty as their official goodwill and tourism ambassador to China and Hong Kong in 2008. According to Brain, the job of a brand ambassador was undertaken typically by a celebrity or someone of a well-known presence, who was often voluntary or paid considerably for their time and effort. In French-speaking regions such as metropolitan France, Guadeloupe, Réunion, Quebec, or Wallonia, the title of &quot;ambassadeur personne&quot; is used.

Further, in the United States of America, senior career officers of the U.S. Foreign Service may be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to the rank of Career Ambassador as professional achievement. Holders of this rank may not necessarily possess diplomatic authority or accreditation to any state, though nearly all have previously served as an Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary during their careers. By custom, they hold the rank for life (including retirement), are addressed with the title &quot;Ambassador&quot; and may use U.S. Diplomatic Passports for all travel. Prominent career ambassadors include Lawrence Eagleburger, William Joseph Burns and Ryan Crocker.

<text>Ammonoids are extinct, (typically) coiled-shelled cephalopods comprising the subclass Ammonoidea. They are more closely related to living octopuses, squid, and cuttlefish (which comprise the clade Coleoidea) than they are to nautiluses (family Nautilidae). The earliest ammonoids appeared during the Emsian stage of the Early Devonian, with the last species vanishing during or soon after the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. They are often called ammonites, which is most frequently used for members of the order Ammonitida, the only remaining group of ammonoids from the Jurassic up until their extinction.

Ammonoids exhibited considerable diversity over their evolutionary history, with over 10,000 species having been described. Ammonoids are excellent index fossils, and they have been frequently used to link rock layers in which a particular species or genus is found to specific geologic time periods. Their fossil shells usually take the form of planispirals, although some helically spiraled and nonspiraled forms (known as heteromorphs) have been found, primarily during the Cretaceous period.

The name &quot;ammonite&quot;, from which the scientific term is derived, was inspired by the spiral shape of their fossilized shells, which somewhat resemble tightly coiled rams&#x27; horns. Pliny the Elder ( 79 AD near Pompeii) called fossils of these animals (&quot;horns of Ammon&quot;) because the Egyptian god Ammon (Amun) was typically depicted wearing rams&#x27; horns. Often, the name of an ammonite genus ends in -&quot;ceras&quot;, which is from ancient Greek () meaning &quot;horn&quot;.

==Classification==

=== Orders and suborders ===

The Ammonoidea can be divided into six orders, listed here starting with the most primitive and going to the more derived:
* Agoniatitida, Lower Devonian – Middle Devonian
* Clymeniida, Upper Devonian
* Goniatitida, Middle Devonian – Upper Permian
* Prolecanitida, Upper Devonian – Upper Triassic
* Ceratitida, Upper Permian – Upper Triassic
* Ammonitida, Lower Jurassic – Lower Paleocene

In some classifications, these are left as suborders, included in only three orders: Goniatitida, Ceratitida and Ammonitida. The classification of ammonoids is based in part on the ornamentation and structure of the septa comprising their shells&#x27; gas chambers.

=== Taxonomy of the &quot;Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology&quot; ===
The &quot;Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology&quot; (Part L, 1957) divides the Ammonoidea, regarded simply as an order, into eight suborders, the Anarcestina, Clymeniina, Goniatitina and Prolecanitina from the Paleozoic; the Ceratitina from the Triassic; and the Ammonitina, Lytoceratina and Phylloceratina from the Jurassic and Cretaceous. In subsequent taxonomies, these are sometimes regarded as orders within the subclass Ammonoidea.

==Shell anatomy and diversity==

=== Basic shell anatomy ===


The chambered part of the ammonite shell is called a phragmocone. It contains a series of progressively larger chambers, called camerae (sing. camera) that are divided by thin walls called septa (sing. septum). Only the last and largest chamber, the body chamber, was occupied by the living animal at any given moment. As it grew, it added newer and larger chambers to the open end of the coil. Where the outer whorl of an ammonite shell largely covers the preceding whorls, the specimen is said to be &quot;&quot; (e.g., &quot;Anahoplites&quot;). Where it does not cover those preceding, the specimen is said to be &quot;&quot; (e.g., &quot;Dactylioceras&quot;).

A thin living tube called a siphuncle passed through the septa, extending from the ammonite&#x27;s body into the empty shell chambers. Through a hyperosmotic active transport process, the ammonite emptied water out of these shell chambers. This enabled it to control the buoyancy of the shell and thereby rise or descend in the water column.

A primary difference between ammonites and nautiloids is the siphuncle of ammonites (excepting Clymeniina) runs along the ventral periphery of the septa and camerae (i.e., the inner surface of the outer axis of the shell), while the siphuncle of nautiloids runs more or less through the center of the septa and camerae.

=== Septa and suture patterns ===
Ammonites (subclass Ammonoidea) can be distinguished by their septa, the dividing walls that separate the chambers in the phragmocone, by the nature of their sutures where the septa join the outer shell wall, and in general by their siphuncles.

Ammonoid septa characteristically have bulges and indentations and are to varying degrees convex when seen from the front, distinguishing them from nautiloid septa, which are typically simple concave, dish-shaped structures. The topology of the septa, especially around the rim, results in the various suture patterns found. The septal curvature in nautiloids and ammonoids also differ in that the septa curves towards the opening in nautiloids, and away from the opening in ammоnoids.
While nearly all nautiloids show gently curving sutures, the ammonoid suture line (the intersection of the septum with the outer shell) is variably folded, forming saddles (&quot;peaks&quot; that point towards the aperture) and lobes (&quot;valleys&quot; which point away from the aperture). The suture line has four main regions.

The external or ventral region refers to sutures along the lower (outer) edge of the shell, where the left and right suture lines meet. The external (or ventral) saddle, when present, lies directly on the lower midline of the shell. As a result, it is often called the median saddle. On suture diagrams the median saddle is supplied with an arrow which points towards the aperture. The median saddle is edged by fairly small external (or ventral) lobes. The earliest ammonoids lacked a median saddle and instead had a single midline ventral lobe, which in later forms is split into two or more components.

The lateral region involves the first saddle and lobe pair past the external region as the suture line extends up the side of the shell. The lateral saddle and lobe are usually larger than the ventral saddle and lobe. Additional lobes developing towards the inner edge of a whorl are labelled umbilical lobes, which increase in number through ammonoid evolution as well as an individual ammonoid&#x27;s development. In many cases the distinction between the lateral and umbilical regions are unclear; new umbilical features can develop from subdivisions of other umbilical features, or from subdivisions of lateral features. Lobes and saddles which are so far towards the center of the whorl that they are covered up by succeeding whorls are labelled internal (or dorsal) lobes and saddles.

Three major types of suture patterns are found in the Ammonoidea:
* Goniatitic – numerous undivided lobes and saddles. This pattern is characteristic of the Paleozoic ammonoids (orders Agoniatitida, Clymeniida, Goniatitida, and Prolecanitida).
*Ceratitic – lobes have subdivided tips, giving them a saw-toothed appearance. The saddles are rounded and undivided. This suture pattern is characteristic of Triassic ammonoids in the order Ceratitida. It appears again in the Cretaceous &quot;pseudoceratites&quot;.
*Ammonitic – lobes and saddles are much subdivided (fluted); subdivisions are usually rounded instead of saw-toothed. Ammonoids of this type are the most important species from a biostratigraphical point of view. This suture type is characteristic of Jurassic and Cretaceous ammonoids, but extends back all the way to the Permian.


=== Siphuncle ===
The siphuncle in most ammonoids is a narrow tubular structure that runs along the shell&#x27;s outer rim, known as the venter, connecting the chambers of the phragmocone to the body or living chamber. This distinguishes them from living nautiloides (&quot;Nautilus&quot; and &quot;Allonautilus&quot;) and typical Nautilida, in which the siphuncle runs through the center of each chamber. However the very earliest nautiloids from the Late Cambrian and Ordovician typically had ventral siphuncles like ammonites, although often proportionally larger and more internally structured. The word &quot;siphuncle&quot; comes from the Neo-Latin &quot;siphunculus&quot;, meaning &quot;little siphon&quot;.

=== Sexual dimorphism ===
One feature found in shells of the modern &quot;Nautilus&quot; is the variation in the shape and size of the shell according to the sex of the animal, the shell of the male being slightly smaller and wider than that of the female. This sexual dimorphism is thought to be an explanation for the variation in size of certain ammonite shells of the same species, the larger shell (the &quot;macroconch&quot;) being female, and the smaller shell (the &quot;microconch&quot;) being male. This is thought to be because the female required a larger body size for egg production. A good example of this sexual variation is found in &quot;Bifericeras&quot; from the early part of the Jurassic period of Europe.

Only recently has sexual variation in the shells of ammonites been recognized. The macroconch and microconch of one species were often previously mistaken for two closely related but different species occurring in the same rocks. However, because the dimorphic sizes are so consistently found together, they are more likely an example of sexual dimorphism within the same species.

Whorl width in the body chamber of many groups of ammonites, as expressed by the width:diameter ratio, is another sign of dimorphism. This character has been used to separate &quot;male&quot; (Largiventer conch &quot;L&quot;) from &quot;female&quot; (Leviventer conch &quot;l&quot;).

=== Variations in shape ===
The majority of ammonite species feature planispiral shells, tightly coiled in a flat plane. The most fundamental difference in spiral form is how strongly successive whorls expand and overlap their predecessors. This can be inferred by the size of the umbilicus, the sunken-in inner part of the coil, exposing older and smaller whorls. &quot;Evolute&quot; shells have very little overlap, a large umbilicus, and many exposed whorls. &quot;Involute&quot; shells have strong overlap, a small umbilicus, and only the largest and most recent whorls are exposed. Shell structure can be broken down further by the width of the shell, with implications for hydrodynamic efficiency.

Major shell forms include:

* Oxycone – Strongly involute and very narrow, with sharp ventral keels and a streamlined, lenticular (lens-shaped) cross-section. These ammonoids are estimated to be nektonic (well-adapted to rapid active swimming), as their shell form incurs very little drag and allows for efficient, stable coasting even in turbulent flow regimes.
* Serpenticone – Strongly evolute and fairly narrow (discoidal) in width. Historically assumed to be primarily planktonic (free-floating drifters), a nektonic lifestyle is also plausible for many species. Thanks to their flattened shape, these ammonoids accelerate effectively, though their large umbilicus introduces more drag in successive thrusts. Relative to oxycones, serpenticones take less effort to rotate around the transverse axis (pitch). Serpenticone ammonites resemble coiled snakes and are abundant in the Jurassic rocks of Europe. Carved serpenticones fulfill the role of the &quot;snakestones&quot; in medieval folklore.
* Spherocone – Moderately involute and quite broad, globular (nearly spherical) in overall shape. Their semi-spherical shape is the most efficient for moving in laminar water (with a low Reynolds number) or migrating vertically through the water column. Though less hydrodynamically stable than other forms, this may be advantageous in certain situations, as spherocones can easily rotate around both the transverse axis and the vertical axis (yaw).
* Platycone – Intermediate between serpenticones and oxycones: narrow and moderately involute.
* Discocone – Intermediate between oxycones and spherocones: involute and moderately broad. The modern &quot;Nautilus&quot; is an example of a discocone cephalopod.
* Planorbicone – Intermediate between serpenticones and spherocones: Moderately broad, evolute to involute. Wider and more involute ammonoids on the serpenticone-spherocone spectrum are termed &quot;Cadicones&quot;.

Ammonites vary greatly in the ornamentation (surface relief) of their shells. Some may be smooth and relatively featureless, except for growth lines, resembling that of the modern &quot;Nautilus&quot;. In others, various patterns of spiral ridges, ribs, nodes, or spines are presented. This type of complex ornamentation of the shell is especially evident in the later ammonites of the Cretaceous.
==== Heteromorphs ====

Ammonoids with a shell shape diverging from the typical planispiral form are known as heteromorphs, instead forming a conch with detached whorls (open coiling) or non-planispiral coiling. These types of shells evolved four times in ammonoids, with the first forms appearing already in the Devonian period. In late Norian age in Triassic the first heteromorph ammonoid fossils belongs to the genus Rhabdoceras. The three other heteromorphic genera were Hannaoceras, Cochloceras and Choristoceras. All of them went extinct at the end of Triassic. In the Jurassic an uncoiled shell was found in the Spiroceratoidea, but by the end of Cretaceous the only heteromorph ammonites remaining belonged to the suborder Ancyloceratina. One example is &quot;Baculites&quot;, which has a nearly straight shell convergent with the older orthocone nautiloids. Still other species&#x27; shells are coiled helically (in two dimensions), similar in appearance to some gastropods (e.g., &quot;Turrilites&quot; and &quot;Bostrychoceras&quot;). Some species&#x27; shells are even initially uncoiled, then partially coiled, and finally straight at maturity (as in &quot;Australiceras&quot;).

Perhaps the most extreme and bizarre-looking example of a heteromorph is &quot;Nipponites&quot;, which appears to be a tangle of irregular whorls lacking any obvious symmetric coiling. Upon closer inspection, though, the shell proves to be a three-dimensional network of connected &quot;U&quot; shapes. &quot; occurs in rocks of the upper part of the Cretaceous in Japan and the United States.

=== Aptychus ===


Some ammonites have been found in association with a single horny plate or a pair of calcitic plates. In the past, these plates were assumed to serve in closing the opening of the shell in much the same way as an operculum, but more recently they are postulated to have been a jaw apparatus.

The plates are collectively termed the aptychus or aptychi in the case of a pair of plates, and anaptychus in the case of a single plate. The paired aptychi were symmetric to one another and equal in size and appearance.

Anaptychi are relatively rare as fossils. They are found representing ammonites from the Devonian period through those of the Cretaceous period.

Calcified aptychi only occur in ammonites from the Mesozoic era. They are almost always found detached from the shell, and are only very rarely preserved in place. Still, sufficient numbers have been found closing the apertures of fossil ammonite shells as to leave no doubt as to their identity as part of the anatomy of an ammonite.

Large numbers of detached aptychi occur in certain beds of rock (such as those from the Mesozoic in the Alps). These rocks are usually accumulated at great depths. The modern &quot;Nautilus&quot; lacks any calcitic plate for closing its shell, and only one extinct nautiloid genus is known to have borne anything similar. &quot;Nautilus&quot; does, however, have a leathery head shield (the hood) which it uses to cover the opening when it retreats inside.

There are many forms of aptychus, varying in shape and the sculpture of the inner and outer surfaces, but because they are so rarely found in position within the shell of the ammonite it is often unclear to which species of ammonite one kind of aptychus belongs. A number of aptychi have been given their own genus and even species names independent of their unknown owners&#x27; genus and species, pending future discovery of verified occurrences within ammonite shells.

==Soft tissues, life appearance and ecology==

Because ammonites and their close relatives are extinct, little is known about their way of life. Their soft body parts are very rarely preserved in any detail. Nonetheless, much has been worked out by examining ammonoid shells and by using models of these shells in water tanks.

Although ammonites do occur in exceptional lagerstatten such as the Solnhofen Limestone, their soft-part record is surprisingly sparse. Beyond a tentative ink sac and possible digestive organs, no soft parts were known until 2021. In this year an isolated specimen showing some of the internal soft anatomy including organs was described. When neutron imaging was used on a fossil found in 1998, part of the musculature became visible and showed they were able to retract themselves into the shell for protection, and that the retractor muscles and hyponome that work together to enable jet propulsion in nautilus worked independently in ammonites. The soft body of the creature occupied the largest segments of the shell at the end of the coil. The smaller earlier segments were walled off and the animal could maintain its buoyancy by filling them with gas. Thus, the smaller sections of the coil would have floated above the larger sections. The reproductive organs show possible traces of spermatophores, which would support the hypothesis that the microconchs were males. They likely bore a radula and beak, and marginal siphuncle. They operated by direct development with sexual reproduction, were carnivorous, and had a crop for food storage. They are unlikely to have dwelt in fresh or brackish water. Many ammonites were likely filter feeders, so adaptations associated with this lifestyle like sieves probably occurred.A 2021 study reported specimens of the scaphitid ammonite genera &quot;Rhaeboceras&quot; and &quot;Hoploscaphites&quot; with mineralised hooks, which were likely present on the ends of a pair of enlarged tentacles. However, these mineralised hooks appear to be present only in scaphitids and were not typical of ammonites as a whole. The number of arms has been subject considerable speculation, with different artists either opting for a nautilus-like restoration with many arms, or a more squid-like restoration with much fewer arms, with a 1996 study suggesting that they probably had 10 arms like modern squid, cuttlefish and octopuses, but that nothing could be said for certain. Paleontologist Mark Witton has stated that &quot;The basic details of ammonite life appearance are far from clear . . . While we can be certain that a squid-like organism lived in the last chamber of their shells . . . little else can be said with certainty about their appearance. ... Despite being creatures which occur so commonly as fossils that it seems like we should know everything about them, ammonites are creatures fraught with uncertainty for artists and palaeontologists alike. Until new data comes to light, all life reconstructions of ammonites should be taken as extremely tentative, almost speculative renditions of their actual appearance.&quot;

Many ammonoids probably lived in the open water of ancient seas, rather than at the sea bottom, because their fossils are often found in rocks laid down under conditions where no bottom-dwelling life is found. In general, they appear to have inhabited the upper of the water column. Many of them (such as &quot;Oxynoticeras&quot;) are thought to have been good swimmers, with flattened, discus-shaped, streamlined shells, although some ammonoids were less effective swimmers and were likely to have been slow-swimming bottom-dwellers. Synchrotron analysis of an aptychophoran ammonite revealed remains of isopod and mollusc larvae in its buccal cavity, indicating at least this kind of ammonite fed on plankton. They may have avoided predation by squirting ink, much like modern cephalopods; ink is occasionally preserved in fossil specimens.

Many ammonite shells have been found with round holes once interpreted as a result of limpets attaching themselves to the shells. However, the triangular formation of the holes, their size and shape, and their presence on both sides of the shells, corresponding to the upper and lower jaws, is more likely evidence of the bite of a medium-sized mosasaur preying upon ammonites.

Some ammonites appear to have lived in cold seeps and even reproduced there.

==Size==
The smallest ammonoid was &quot;Maximites&quot; from the Upper Carboniferous. Adult specimens reached only in shell diameter. Few of the ammonites occurring in the lower and middle part of the Jurassic period reached a size exceeding in diameter. Much larger forms are found in the later rocks of the upper part of the Jurassic and the lower part of the Cretaceous, such as &quot;Titanites&quot; from the Portland Stone of Jurassic of southern England, which is often in diameter, and &quot;Parapuzosia seppenradensis&quot; of the Cretaceous period of Germany, which is one of the largest-known ammonites, sometimes reaching in diameter. The largest-documented North American ammonite is &quot;Parapuzosia bradyi&quot; from the Cretaceous, with specimens measuring in diameter.

==Evolutionary history==
Ammonoids are widely thought to have originated from straight-shelled (orthocone) &quot;nautiloids&quot; belong to Bactritida during the early Devonian (Emsian), with transitional fossils showing the transition from a straight shell, to a curved (cyrtoconic) shell to a relaxed (gyroconic) spiral and finally to a tight spiral. The Kellwasser Event at the end of the Frasnian let to a dramatic decline in ammonoid diversity, with only a handful of lineages belong to Tornoceratina (a subgroup of Goniatites) surviving, becoming ancestral to all later ammonoids. Ammonoids rediversified during the following Famennian, which also saw the radical shift of the siphuncle from a lower (ventral) to upper (dorsal) position. Ammonites were nearly completely exterminated by the Hangenberg Event at the end of the Devonian, with only a handful of lineages surviving, with one of the surviving goniatite lineages becoming ancestral to all post-early Carboniferous and later ammonoids. Ammonoids again rediversified during the Early Carboniferous. During the Carboniferous ammonoids underwent alternating periods of diversification and decline, and during the late Carboniferous ammonioid diversity became concentrated in a few geographical regions.

During the Permian, the Capitanian mass extinction event severely reduced the diversity of Goniatitida and Prolecanitida, while the Ceratitida, which originated during the Middle Permian, likely from the Daraelitidae, was largely unaffected and radiated in the Late Permian, becoming the dominant group of ammonoids in this period represented by two groups, the araxoceratids and xenodiscids. The end-Permian mass extinction again reduced ammonoids to the verge of extinction, though both main ceratitd lineages lineages survived, though the xenodiscids were more successful and ancestral to all later ammonoids.

Ammonites were devastated by the end-Triassic extinction, with only a handful of genera belonging to the family Psiloceratidae of the suborder Phylloceratina surviving and becoming ancestral to all later Jurassic and Cretaceous ammonites. Ammonites explosively diversified during the Early Jurassic, with the orders Psiloceratina, Ammonitina, Lytoceratina, Haploceratina, Perisphinctina and Ancyloceratina all appearing during the Jurassic. Heteromorph ammonites (ammonites with open or non-spiral coiling) of the order Ancyloceratina became common during the Cretaceous period.

At least 57 species of ammonites, which were widespread and belonged to six superfamilies, were extant during the last 500,000 years of the Cretaceous, indicating that ammonites remained highly diverse until the very end of their existence. All ammonites were wiped out during or shortly after the K-Pg extinction event, caused by the Chicxulub impact. It has been suggested that ocean acidification generated by the impact played a key role in their extinction, as the larvae of ammonites were likely small and planktonic, and would have been heavily affected. Nautiloids, exemplified by modern nautiluses, are conversely thought to have had a reproductive strategy in which eggs were laid in smaller batches many times during the lifespan, and on the sea floor well away from any direct effects of such a bolide strike, and thus survived. Many ammonite species were filter feeders, so they might have been particularly susceptible to marine faunal turnovers and climatic change. Some reports suggest that a few ammonite species may have persisted into the very early Danian stage of the Paleocene, before going extinct.

==Cultural significance==

In medieval Europe, fossilised ammonites were thought to be petrified coiled snakes, and were called &quot;snakestones&quot; or, more commonly in medieval England, &quot;serpentstones&quot;. They were considered to be evidence for the actions of saints, such as Hilda of Whitby, a myth referenced in Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s &quot;Marmion&quot;, and Saint Patrick, and were held to have healing or oracular powers. Traders would occasionally carve the head of a snake onto the empty, wide end of the ammonite fossil, and then sell them as petrified snakes. In other cases, the snake&#x27;s head would be simply painted on.

Others believed ammonites, which they referred to as &quot;salagrana&quot; were composed of fossilized worm dung, and could be used to ward off witches.

Ammonites from the Gandaki River in Nepal are known as Shaligrams, and are believed by Hindus to be a concrete manifestation of Vishnu.

<text>Amoz (), also known as Amotz, was the father of the prophet Isaiah, mentioned in Isaiah 1:1; 2:1 and 13:1, and in II Kings 19:2, 20; 20:1. The word &quot;amoz&quot; means strong 

== Rabbinical tradition ==
There is a Talmudic tradition that when the name of a prophet&#x27;s father is given, the father was also a prophet, so that Amoz would have been a prophet like his son. Though it is mentioned frequently as the patronymic title of Isaiah, the name Amoz appears nowhere else in the Bible. The rabbis of the Talmud declared, based upon a rabbinic tradition, that Amoz was the brother of Amaziah (), the king of Judah at that time (and, as a result, that Isaiah himself was a member of the royal family). According to some traditions, Amoz is the &quot;man of God&quot; in 2 Chronicles 25:7–9 (Seder Olam Rabbah 20), who cautioned Amaziah to release the Israelite mercenaries that he had hired.

<doc id="68662" wikidata="Q2844493" url="?curid=68662" title="Amraphel">
<text>In the Hebrew Bible, Amraphel (; ; ) was a king of Shinar (Hebrew for Sumer) in Book of Genesis Chapter 14, who invaded Canaan along with other kings under the leadership of Chedorlaomer, king of Elam. Chedorlaomer&#x27;s coalition defeated Sodom and the other cities in the Battle of the Vale of Siddim.

== Modern identifications ==
Beginning with E. Schrader in 1888, Amraphel was usually associated with Ḫammurabi, who ruled Babylonia from 1792 BC until his death in 1750 BC. This view has been largely abandoned in recent decades.

David Rohl has argued for an identification with Amar-Sin, the third ruler of the Ur III dynasty. Some suggest that Amraphel is a Semitic name that is composed of two elements, &quot;Amar&quot;, which was also used by Sumerian King, Amar-Sin, and &quot;a-p-l&quot;. John Van Seters, in &quot;Abraham in History and Tradition&quot;, rejected the historical existence of Amraphel. According to Stephanie Dalley, Amraphel was &quot;[e]ither Hammurabi with an unexplained suffix &quot;-el&quot;, or Amud-piʾel, king of Qatna, with the common misreading of the letter &quot;r&quot; for &quot;d&quot;; possibly a confusion of the two names.&quot;

== In Rabbinic tradition ==
Rabbinic sources such as Midrash Tanhuma &quot;Lekh Lekhah&quot; 6, Targum Yonatan to Exodus 14:1, and Eruvin 53a identify Amraphel with Nimrod. This is also asserted in the 11th chapter of the Sefer haYashar, attested from the early 17th century:

Genesis Rabbah 42 says Amraphel was called by three names: Cush, after his father&#x27;s name (Gen. 10:8), Nimrod, because he established rebellion (&quot;mrd&quot;) in the world, and Amraphel, as he declared (&quot;amar&quot;) &quot;I will cast down&quot; (&quot;apilah&quot;).

<text>Anab (, &quot;Anav&quot;) is a city mentioned in the Hebrew Bible. It is mentioned in the Book of Joshua as one of the cities in the Judaean Mountains from which Joshua expelled the Anakim.

==In the Hebrew Bible==
Anav is mentioned in Joshua 11:21:

Later, Joshua 15:50 lists Anav as one of several sites incorporated into the hilly parts of the territory of the Tribe of Judah.

== In later sources ==
Anab was mentioned in a Jewish document, written in Hebrew, self-dated to the &quot;4th year after the destruction of the house of Israel&quot;, which scholars put at 140 CE, four years after the Roman suppression of the Bar Kokhba revolt.

== Archeology ==
Anav is identified with today&#x27;s Khirbet Anab. It lies among the Hebron Hills, 
south-south-west of Hebron, in the West Bank.

&#x27;Anab al-Kabir used to be a sizeable village with 60 tax-payers, as noted by Hütteroth and Abdulfattah. The cause of its destruction remains unknown. Currently, it is occupied by Bedouins from the Ramad&#x27;in tribe, who likely settled there during the Jordanian control of the West Bank (1948–1967).

A basilical-shaped church with Greek and Christian Palestinian Aramaic inscriptions was found at the site. The entire complex is 38 x 20 meters. Mosaic floors were discovered throughout the site; they suffered iconoclastic destruction during the early Islamic period (c. 8th century CE). The rooms of the complex were used for habitation during the Mamluk period in the 13th and 14th centuries.

<text>Anakim ( &quot;ʿĂnāqīm&quot;) are mentioned in the Bible as descendants of Anak.

According to the Old Testament, the Anakim lived in the southern part of the land of Canaan, near Hebron (Gen. 23:2; Josh. 15:13). states that they inhabited the region later known as Edom and Moab in the days of Abraham. The name may come from a Hebrew root meaning &quot;necklace&quot; or &quot;neck-chain&quot;. They were also a Rephaite tribe according to . 

Their formidable appearance, as described by ten of the twelve spies sent to search the land, filled the Israelites with terror. The Israelites seem to have identified them with the Nephilim of the antediluvian age (, ). However, the two faithful spies Caleb and Joshua do not verify this report, leading some scholars to believe that the fearful reports from the other ten are hyperbolic and should not be taken literally. 

Joshua finally expelled the Anakim from the land, except for some who found a refuge in the Philistine cities of Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod (). Thus, some scholars conclude that the Philistine giants such as Goliath whom David encountered (2 Samuel 21:15-22) were descendants of the Anakim.

The Septuagint translation of Jeremiah 47:5 refers to the descendants of the Anakim mourning after the destruction of Gaza.

The Egyptian Execration texts of the Middle Kingdom (2055-1650 BC) mention a list of political enemies in Canaan, and among this list are a group called the &quot;ly Anaq&quot; or people of Anaq. The three rulers of ly Anaq were Erum, Abiyamimu, and Akirum.

<text>Ananiah, in the Bible, is a town in the tribe of Benjamin between Nob and Hazor (modern Tell el-Qedah) (). It is one of the localities inhabited by the tribe of Benjamin after the return from the Babylonian Exile. Ananiah, whose name means &quot;protected by God,&quot; was identified by the 19th century French traveler V. Guérin, author of &quot;Description de La Jude&#x27;e&quot;, with the present-day Beit Hanina, located 3 miles north of Jerusalem. Edward Robinson concurred, but W.F. Albright maintained that Ananiah is the village of al-Eizariya east of Jerusalem. Some modern scholars also identify Ananiah with al-Eizariya.

<text>The word anathema has two main meanings. One is to describe that something or someone is being hated or avoided. The other refers to a formal excommunication by a church. These meanings come from the New Testament, where an anathema was a person or thing cursed or condemned by God. In the Old Testament, an anathema was something or someone cursed and separated from God because of sin. These represent two types of settings, one for devotion, the other for destruction.

== Etymology ==

Anathema derives from Ancient Greek: , , meaning &quot;an offering&quot; or &quot;anything dedicated&quot;, itself derived from the verb , , meaning &quot;to offer up&quot;. In the Old Testament, חֵרֶם (&quot;chērem&quot;) referred to both objects consecrated to divine use and those dedicated to destruction in the Lord&#x27;s name, such as enemies and their weapons during religious wars. Since weapons of the enemy were considered unholy, the meaning became &quot;anything dedicated to evil&quot; or &quot;a curse&quot;.

In New Testament usage a different meaning developed. St. Paul used the word anathema to signify a curse and the forced expulsion of one from the community of Christians. By the 6th century, the liturgical meaning evolved again to mean a formal ecclesiastical curse of excommunication and the condemnation of heretical doctrines, the severest form of separation from the Christian church issued against a heretic or group of heretics by a Pope or other church official. The phrase (&quot;let him be anathema&quot;), echoing Galatians 1:8–9, was thus used in decrees of councils defining Christian faith.

Examples include:
*&quot;It&#x27;s no wonder then, that Paul calls down God&#x27;s curse, God&#x27;s anathema, His ban on those behind their potential defection from Christ.&quot;
*&quot;He shrank from the venerable saint as if to avoid an anathema.&quot;
*&quot;In 1054, an anathema was issued by Rome against the Eastern Patriarch who then issued another one against the cardinal who delivered it.&quot;
In 1526, the word &quot;anathema&quot; appeared in modern English for the first time and was used in the sense of &quot;something accursed&quot;. The &quot;consecrated object&quot; meaning was also adopted a short time later, but is no longer widely used. Its most common modern usage is in secular contexts where it is used to mean something or someone that is detested or shunned.

Examples include:
*&quot;Racial hatred was anathema to her.&quot;
*&quot;The idea that one would voluntarily inject poison into one&#x27;s body was anathema to me.&quot;
*&quot;This notion was anathema to most of his countrymen.&quot;

== Religious usage ==
The Old Testament applied the word to anything set aside for sacrifice, and thus banned from profane use and dedicated to destruction—as, in the case of religious wars, the enemy and their cities and possessions. The New Testament uses the word to mean a curse and forced expulsion of someone from the Christian community.

=== Judaism ===
The Septuagint uses the Greek word (&quot;anathema&quot;), meaning something offered to a divinity, to render the Hebrew word (&quot;herem&quot;). The word appears in verses such as Leviticus 27:28 to refer to things that are offered to God and so banned for common (non-religious) use. The Hebrew word was also used for what was devoted, by virtue of a simple vow, not to the Lord, but to the priest. According to the &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; (1901–1906), with the rise of the synagogue as the organizing principle of Jewish life circa the Maccabean period, the sense of the word &quot;herem&quot; changed from &quot;an instrument of communal purification&quot; to &quot;an instrument for the promotion of personal conduct as well as the enforcement of public morality [...] an instrument of ecclesiastical discipline&quot;; see Herem (censure).

===New Testament===

The noun ἀνάθεμα (&quot;anathema&quot;) occurs in the Greek New Testament six times, and frequently in the Septuagint (Greek Old Testament). Its meaning in the New Testament is &quot;disfavour of God&quot;, and is used both of the sentence of disfavour, as in Acts 23:14, and to the object of God&#x27;s disfavour, as in the other cited places.

===Early Church===

Since the time of the apostles, the term &#x27;anathema&#x27; has come to mean a form of extreme religious sanction, known as excommunication. The earliest recorded instance of the form is in the Council of Elvira (), and thereafter it became the common method of cutting off heretics; for example, the Synod of Gangra (c. 340) pronounced that Manicheanism was anathema. Cyril of Alexandria issued twelve anathemas against Nestorius in 431. In the fifth century, a formal distinction between anathema and &quot;minor&quot; excommunication evolved, where &quot;minor&quot; excommunication entailed cutting off a person or group from the rite of Eucharist and attendance at worship, while anathema meant a complete separation of the subject from the Church.

===Catholicism===

In the dogmatic canons of all the ecumenical councils recognized by the Catholic Church that use the word anathema, the word &quot;anathema&quot; signifies exclusion from the society of the faithful because of heresy. Documents of the 9th and 12th centuries distinguish anathema from excommunication, a distinction later clarified by using the term &quot;major excommunication&quot; for exclusion from the society of the faithful, and &quot;minor excommunication&quot; for ordinary excommunication or exclusion from reception of the sacraments.

Although in the canons of ecumenical councils the word &quot;anathema&quot; continued to be used to mean exclusion for heresy from the society of the faithful, the word was also used to signify a major excommunication inflicted with particular solemnity. Anathema, in this sense, was a major excommunication pronounced with the ceremonies described in the article bell, book, and candle, which were reserved for the gravest crimes.

The 1917 Roman Code of Canon Law abandoned the distinction between major and minor excommunication (which continues in use among the Eastern Catholic Churches) and abolished all penalties of whatever kind envisaged in previous canonical legislation but not included in the Code. It defined excommunication as exclusion from the communion of the faithful and said that excommunication &quot;is also called anathema, especially if inflicted with the solemnities described in the &quot;Pontificale Romanum&quot;.&quot;

The 1983 Code of Canon Law, which is now in force, does not contain the word &quot;anathema&quot;, and the &quot;Pontificale Romanum&quot;, as revised after the Second Vatican Council, no longer mentions any particular solemnities associated with the infliction of excommunication.

===Eastern Orthodoxy===

The Eastern Orthodox Church distinguishes between &quot;epitemia&quot; (penances) laid on a person, one form of which is &quot;separation from the communion of the Church&quot; (excommunication), and anathema. While undergoing epitemia, the person remains an Orthodox Christian, even though their participation in the mystical life of the church is restricted; but those given over to anathema are considered completely torn from the Church until they repent. Epitemia, or excommunication, is normally limited to a specified period of time—though it always depends on evidence of repentance by the one serving the penance. The lifting of anathema, however, depends solely on the repentance of the one condemned. The two causes for which a person may be anathematized are heresy and schism. Anathematization is only a last resort, and must always be preceded by pastoral attempts to reason with the offender and bring about their restoration.

For the Orthodox, anathema is not final damnation. God alone is the judge of the living and the dead, and up until the moment of death repentance is always possible. The purpose of public anathema is twofold: to warn the one condemned and bring about his repentance, and to warn others away from his error. Everything is done for the purpose of the salvation of souls.

On the First Sunday of Great Lent—the &quot;Sunday of Orthodoxy&quot;—the church celebrates the Rite of Orthodoxy, at which anathemas are pronounced against numerous heresies. This rite commemorates the end of Byzantine Iconoclasm—the last great heresy to trouble the church (all subsequent heresies—so far—merely being restatements in one form or another of previous errors)—at the Council of Constantinople in 843. The &quot;Synodicon&quot;, or decree, of the council was publicly proclaimed on this day, including an anathema against not only Iconoclasm but also of previous heresies. The &quot;Synodicon&quot; continues to be proclaimed annually, together with additional prayers and petitions in cathedrals and major monasteries throughout the Eastern Orthodox Churches. During the rite (which is also known as the &quot;Triumph of Orthodoxy&quot;), lections are read from Romans 16:17–20, which directs the church to &quot;mark them which cause divisions and offenses contrary to the doctrine you have learned, and avoid them. For they ... by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple,&quot; and Matthew 18:10–18, which recounts the parable of the Good Shepherd, and provides the procedure to follow in dealing with those who err:
&quot;... if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother. But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established. And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he shall neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as a heathen man and a publican. Verily I say unto you, whatever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.&quot;
After an ektenia (litany), during which petitions are offered that God will have mercy on those who err and bring them back to the truth, and that he will &quot;make hatred, enmity, strife, vengeance, falsehood and all other abominations to cease, and cause true love to reign in our hearts&quot;, the bishop (or abbot) says a prayer during which he beseeches God to: &quot;look down now upon Thy Church, and behold how that, though we have joyously received the Gospel of salvation, we are but stony ground. For the thorns of vanity and the tares of the passions make it to bear but little fruit in certain places and none in others, and with the increase in iniquity, some, opposing the truth of Thy Gospel by heresy, and others by schism, do fall away from Thy dignity, and rejecting Thy grace, they subject themselves to the judgment of Thy most holy word. O most merciful and almighty Lord ... be merciful unto us; strengthen us in the right Faith by Thy power, and with Thy divine light illumine the eyes of those in error, that they may come to know Thy truth. Soften the hardness of their hearts and open their ears, that they may hear Thy voice and turn to Thee, our Saviour. O Lord, set aside their division and correct their life, which doth not accord with Christian piety. ... Endue the pastors of Thy Church with holy zeal, and so direct their care for the salvation and conversion of those in error with the spirit of the Gospel that, guided by Thee, we may all attain to that place where is the perfect faith, fulfillment of hope, and true love ...&quot; The protodeacon then proclaims the Synodicon, anathematizing various heresies and lauding those who have remained constant in the dogma and Holy Tradition of the Church.

<doc id="68668" wikidata="Q2662138" url="?curid=68668" title="Anathoth">
<text>Anathoth is the name of one of the Levitical cities given to &quot;the children of Aaron&quot; in the tribe of Benjamin (; ). Residents were called Antothites or Anetothites.

==Name==
The name of this town may be derived from a Canaanite goddess, `Anat. It is also mentioned as the name of an Israelite person in 1 Chronicles (), and in Nehemiah ().

==History according to the Hebrew Bible==

Anathoth is mentioned as the native place of Abiezer the Anetothite, one of David&#x27;s &quot;thirty&quot; (), and of Jehu, another of his mighty men (). King Solomon banishes Abiathar the Priest to Anathoth, &quot;unto thine own fields&quot;. It is perhaps best known as the home town of the prophet Jeremiah (; ; ). He delivers a prophecy of tribulation by the sword against the residents of Anathoth, who were plotting against him ().

Anathoth suffered greatly from the army of Nebuchadnezzar, and only 128 men returned to it from the Babylonian exile (; ). It lay about 3 miles north of Jerusalem.

==Modern identification==
The Arab village of &#x27;Anata was identified as the site of Anathoth by Edward Robinson. Robinson&#x27;s identification echoes that of Epiphanius. The modern Israeli settlement of Anatot (also known as Almon) was named after it.

Abu Ghosh has also been associated with Anathoth by Conder and Kitchener in their 1883 Survey of Western Palestine.

==In Christianity==
Some Christians believe that Jeremiah prophesied that the field there would be bought from money by the chief priests, that Judas Iscariot had returned after he had betrayed Jesus before he hanged himself, an interpretation possibly favored by the Gospel of Matthew. (; Matthew 27:3-10) Other readers suggest that Jeremiah 32 simply shows Jeremiah purchasing the field as one of his many prophetic actions, indicating that the Babylonian captivity would come to an end and people would be returned to the land of Judah.

<text>Ancient of Days is a name for God in the Book of Daniel. The title &quot;Ancient of Days&quot; has been used as a source of inspiration in art and music, denoting the creator&#x27;s aspects of eternity combined with perfection. William Blake&#x27;s watercolour and relief etching entitled &quot;The Ancient of Days&quot; is one such example.

==Judaism==
This term appears three times in the Book of Daniel (7:9, 13, 22), and is used in the sense of God being eternal.

===Kabbalah===
In the Zohar, the seminal document of Kabbalah that emerged in 13th-century Spain, there is mention of the Ancient of Ancients, and the Holy Ancient One – Atika Kadisha, variably interpreted as synonymous with the Ein Sof, the unmanifested Godhead. The Ancient of Days is the manifestation of the Ancient of Ancients within Creation. It refers to the most primary (&quot;ancient&quot;) source of creation in the divine will Keter (&quot;Crown&quot;).

In 16th-century Lurianic Kabbalah, is systemised as the uppermost (Divine &quot;Countenance/Configuration&quot;) in the rectification of the World of Atzilut (&quot;Emanation&quot;) after the &quot;Shattering of the sephirot Vessels&quot;. Keter of Atzilut acts as the guiding Divine motivation in creation, developing into two , (Ancient of Days) and (&quot;Long Visage/Infinitely Patient One&quot;). is the inner of Keter, synonymous with Divine Delight, that enclothes within and motivates , the outer of Keter, synonymous with Divine Will. is said to extend down all levels of Creation in ever more concealed mode as the divine substratum of everything. The Zohar goes into great detail describing the White Head of God and ultimately the emanation of its anthropomorphic personality or attributes. In the descending realms explained by Luria, the (&quot;Skull&quot;-Keter Will) within enclothes the Chesed (Kindness) of , becoming the origin of the lights of the world of ; the (&quot;Concealed Brain&quot;—Chokmah Wisdom) within enclothes the (Severity) of , becoming the origin of the vessels of the world of . The (&quot;Beard&quot;) of constricts the infinite light originating from in 13 channels of rectification to lower, relatively finite reality. The Merkabah text Re&#x27; uyot Yehezkel identifies the Ancient of Days as Metatron.

== Christianity ==
===Eastern Christianity===
In Eastern Orthodox Christian hymns and icons, the Ancient of Days is sometimes identified with God the Father or occasionally the Holy Spirit; but most properly, in accordance with Orthodox theology he is identified with God the Son, Jesus Christ.

Most of the eastern church fathers who comment on the passage in Daniel (7:9–10, 13–14) interpreted the elderly figure as a prophetic revelation of the Son before his physical incarnation.

Eastern Christian art will sometimes portray Jesus Christ as an old man, the Ancient of Days, to show symbolically that he existed from all eternity, and sometimes as a young man, or wise baby, to portray him as he was incarnate. This iconography emerged in the 6th century, mostly in the Eastern Empire with elderly images, although usually not properly or specifically identified as &quot;the Ancient of Days.&quot; The first images of the Ancient of Days, so named with an inscription, were developed by iconographers in different manuscripts, the earliest of which are dated to the 11th century. The images in these manuscripts included the inscription &quot;Jesus Christ, Ancient of Days,&quot; confirming that this was a way to identify Christ as pre-eternal with the God the Father. Indeed, later, it was declared by the Russian Orthodox Church at the Great Synod of Moscow in 1667 that the Ancient of Days was the Son and not the Father.

===Western Christianity===
In the Western Church similar figures usually represent only God the Father. Thomas Aquinas, for example, identifies the Ancient of Days with God the Father, quoting Hilary of Poitiers&#x27; comment that &quot;eternity is in the Father&quot;.

The Book of Daniel also contains a reference to &quot;someone like a son of man&quot;, who is brought up close before the Ancient of Days, and to whom are given &quot;rulership and dignity and kingdom, that the peoples, national groups and languages should all serve even him&quot; (Daniel 7:13–14). Some Christian commentators have understood this to describe God the Father bestowing rulership over an everlasting kingdom upon Jesus (who is often called &quot;the Son of man&quot;), which would suggest that the Ancient of Days is not identical with Jesus. It has been noted that &quot;Daniel&#x27;s vision of the two figures is the only one in which the two divine persons are seen face to face&quot;.

Among ancient Jewish pseudepigrapha, the Book of Enoch states that he who is called &quot;Son of man,&quot; who existed before the worlds were, is seen by Enoch in company with the &quot;Ancient of Days&quot;.

In the hymn &quot;Immortal, Invisible, God only Wise&quot; (lyrics Walter C. Smith, 1867), the last two lines of the first verse read:

In the hymn &quot;O Worship the King&quot; (lyrics Robert Grant, 1833), the last two lines of the first verse read: 

===Latter-day Saints===
In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the title &quot;Ancient of Days&quot; belongs to Adam, the oldest and earliest man, who is also identified with the archangel Michael.

<text>Anem or Anim was a Levitical city in Israel allocated to the Gershonites, according to the Hebrew Bible, from the land of the tribe of Issachar () (6:58 in some Bibles). In the parallel location in the Book of Joshua, the name &quot;En-gannim&quot; or &quot;Engannim&quot; appears, and the two names may refer to the same town.

The location of Anem is unknown.

William F. Albright suggested that Anem was the same location as En-gannim, the two spellings being variants of a single original site &quot;ʕen-ʕonam&quot;. But Hagen Martino (in 1907), claimed that Anem is &#x27;probably a distinct site&#x27;, near En-gannim.

<doc id="68672" wikidata="Q79871" url="?curid=68672" title="Anger">
<text>Anger, also known as wrath ( ) or [[rage (emotion)|rage]], is an intense emotional state involving a strong, uncomfortable and non-cooperative response to a perceived provocation, hurt, or threat.

A person experiencing anger will often experience physical effects, such as increased heart rate, elevated blood pressure, and increased levels of adrenaline and noradrenaline. Some view anger as an emotion that triggers part of the fight or flight response. Anger becomes the predominant feeling behaviorally, cognitively, and physiologically when a person makes the conscious choice to take action to immediately stop the threatening behavior of another outside force.

Anger can have many physical and mental consequences. The external expression of anger can be found in facial expressions, body language, physiological responses, and at times public acts of aggression. Facial expressions can range from inward angling of the eyebrows to a full . While most of those who experience anger explain its arousal as a result of &quot;what has happened to them&quot;, psychologists point out that an angry person can very well be mistaken because anger causes a loss in self-monitoring capacity and objective observability.

Modern psychologists view anger as a normal, natural, and mature emotion experienced by virtually all humans at times, and as something that has functional value for survival. Uncontrolled anger can negatively affect personal or social well-being and negatively impact those around them. While many philosophers and writers have warned against the spontaneous and uncontrolled fits of anger, there has been disagreement over the intrinsic value of anger. The issue of dealing with anger has been written about since the times of the earliest philosophers, but modern psychologists, in contrast to earlier writers, have also pointed out the possible harmful effects of suppressing anger.

==Psychology and sociology==

Three types of anger are recognized by psychologists:
#&quot;Hasty and sudden anger&quot; is connected to the impulse for self-preservation. It is shared by humans and other animals, and it occurs when the animal feels tormented or trapped. This form of anger is episodic.
#&quot;Settled and deliberate anger&quot; is a reaction to perceived &quot;deliberate&quot; harm or unfair treatment by others. This form of anger is episodic.
#&quot;Dispositional anger&quot; is related more to character traits than to instincts or cognitions. Irritability, sullenness, and churlishness are examples of the last form of anger.

Anger can potentially mobilize psychological resources and boost determination toward correction of wrong behaviors, promotion of social justice, communication of negative sentiment, and redress of grievances. It can also facilitate patience. In contrast, anger can be destructive when it does not find its appropriate outlet in expression. Anger, in its strong form, impairs one&#x27;s ability to process information and to exert cognitive control over one&#x27;s behavior. An angry person may lose their objectivity, empathy, prudence or thoughtfulness and may cause harm to themselves or others. There is a sharp distinction between anger and aggression (verbal or physical, direct or indirect) even though they mutually influence each other. While anger can activate aggression or increase its probability or intensity, it is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for aggression.

===Neuropsychological perspective===
Extension of the stimuli of the fighting reactions: At the beginning of life, the human infant struggles indiscriminately against any restraining force, whether it be another human being or a blanket which confines their movements. There is no inherited susceptibility to social stimuli as distinct from other stimulation, in anger. At a later date the child learns that certain actions, such as striking, scolding, and screaming, are effective toward persons, but not toward things. In adults, though the infantile response is still sometimes seen, the fighting reaction becomes fairly well limited to stimuli whose hurting or restraining influence can be thrown off by physical violence.

Brain regions which are activated when recognizing threat or provocation, and facilitate autonomic arousal and interoception and activate the stress response, are the salience network (dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and anterior insula cortex) and subcortical area (the thalamus, the amygdala, and the brain stem).

==Differences between related concepts==
Raymond Novaco of University of California Irvine, who since 1975 has published a plethora of literature on the subject, stratified anger into three modalities: cognitive (appraisals), somatic-affective (tension and agitations), and behavioral (withdrawal and antagonism).

The words annoyance and rage are often imagined to be at opposite ends of an emotional continuum: mild irritation and annoyance at the low end and fury at the high end. Rage problems are conceptualized as &quot;the inability to process emotions or life&#x27;s experiences&quot; either because the capacity to regulate emotion (Schore, 1994) has never been sufficiently developed or because it has been temporarily lost due to more recent trauma. Rage is understood as raw, undifferentiated emotions, that spill out when another life event that cannot be processed, no matter how trivial, puts more stress on the organism than it can bear.

Anger, when viewed as a protective response or instinct to a perceived threat, is considered as positive. The negative expression of this state is known as aggression commits antisocial personality disorder and Intermittent explosive disorder. Acting on this misplaced state is rage due to possible potential errors in perception and judgment.

Examples

==Characteristics==

William DeFoore, an anger management writer, described anger as a pressure cooker, stating that &quot;we can only suppress or apply pressure against our happy for so long before it erupts&quot;.

One simple trichotomy of anger expression is &quot;passive anger&quot; versus &quot;aggressive anger&quot; versus &quot;assertive anger&quot;. These three types of anger have some characteristic symptoms:

===Passive anger===
Passive anger can be expressed in the following ways:
* &quot;Dispassion&quot;, such as giving someone the cold shoulder or a fake smile, looking unconcerned or &quot;sitting on the fence&quot; while others sort things out, dampening feelings with substance abuse, overreacting, oversleeping, not responding to another&#x27;s anger, frigidity, indulging in sexual practices that depress spontaneity and make objects of participants, giving inordinate amounts of time to machines, objects or intellectual pursuits, talking of frustrations but showing no feeling.
* &quot;Evasiveness&quot;, such as turning one&#x27;s back in a crisis, avoiding conflict, not arguing back, becoming phobic.
* &quot;Defeatism&quot;, such as setting people up for failure, choosing unreliable people to depend on, being accident prone, underachieving, sexual impotence, expressing frustration at insignificant things but ignoring serious ones.
* &quot;Obsessive behavior&quot;, such as needing to be inordinately clean and tidy, making a habit of constantly checking things, over-dieting or overeating, demanding that all jobs be done perfectly.
* &quot;Psychological manipulation&quot;, such as provoking people to aggression and then patronizing them, provoking aggression but staying on the sidelines, emotional blackmail, false tearfulness, feigning illness, sabotaging relationships, using sexual provocation, using a third party to convey negative feelings, withholding money or resources.
* &quot;Secretive behavior&quot;, such as stockpiling resentments that are expressed behind people&#x27;s backs, giving the silent treatment or under-the-breath mutterings, avoiding eye contact, putting people down, gossiping, anonymous complaints, poison pen letters, stealing, and conning.
* &quot;Self-blame&quot;, such as apologizing too often, being overly critical, inviting criticism.

===Aggressive anger===
The symptoms of aggressive anger are:
* &quot;Bullying&quot;, such as threatening people directly, persecuting, insulting, pushing or shoving, using power to oppress, shouting, driving someone off the road, playing on people&#x27;s weaknesses.
* &quot;Destruction&quot;, such as destroying objects as in vandalism, harming animals, child abuse, destroying a relationship, reckless driving, substance abuse.
* &quot;Grandiosity&quot;, such as showing off, expressing mistrust, not delegating, being a sore loser, wanting center stage all the time, not listening, talking over people&#x27;s heads, expecting kiss and make-up sessions to solve problems.
* &quot;Hurtfulness&quot;, such as violence, including sexual abuse, rape, racism, verbal abuse, biased or vulgar jokes, breaking confidence, using foul language, ignoring people&#x27;s feelings, willfully discriminating, blaming, punishing people for unwarranted deeds, labeling others.
* &quot;Risk-taking behavior&quot;, such as speaking too fast, walking too fast, driving too fast, reckless spending.
* &quot;Selfishness&quot;, such as ignoring others&#x27; needs, not responding to requests for help, queue jumping.
* &quot;Threats&quot;, such as frightening people by saying how one could harm them, their property or their prospects, finger pointing, fist shaking, wearing clothes or symbols associated with violent behavior, tailgating, excessively blowing a car horn, slamming doors.
* &quot;Unjust blaming&quot;, such as accusing other people for one&#x27;s own mistakes, blaming people for person&#x27;s own feelings, making general accusations.
* &quot;Unpredictability&quot;, such as explosive rages over minor frustrations, attacking indiscriminately, dispensing unjust punishment, inflicting harm on others for the sake of it, illogical arguments.
* &quot;Vengeance&quot;, such as being over-punitive. This differs from retributive justice, as vengeance is personal, and possibly unlimited in scale.

===Assertive anger===
* &quot;Blame&quot;, such as after a particular individual commits an action that&#x27;s possibly frowned upon, the particular person will resort to scolding. This is in fact, common in discipline terms.
* &quot;Punishment&quot;, the angry person will give a temporary punishment to an individual like further limiting a child&#x27;s will to do anything they want like playing video games, watching television, etc., after they did something to cause trouble. Or disciplining a pet.
* &quot;Sternness&quot;, such as calling out a person on their behaviour, with their voices raised with utter disapproval/disappointment.

===Six dimensions of anger expression===
Anger expression can take on many more styles than passive or aggressive. Ephrem Fernandez has identified six dimensions of anger expression. They relate to the direction of anger, its locus, reaction, modality, impulsivity, and objective. Coordinates on each of these dimensions can be connected to generate a profile of a person&#x27;s anger expression style. Among the many profiles that are theoretically possible in this system, are the familiar profile of the person with explosive anger, profile of the person with repressive anger, profile of the passive aggressive person, and the profile of constructive anger expression.

===Ethnicity and culture===
Much research has explored whether the emotion of anger is experienced and expressed differently depending on the culture. Matsumoto (2007) conducted a study in which White-American and Asian participants needed to express the emotions from a program called JACFEE (Japanese and Caucasian Facial Expression of Emotion) in order to determine whether Caucasian observers noticed any differences in expression of participants of a different nationality. He found that participants were unable to assign a nationality to people demonstrating expression of anger, i.e. they could not distinguish ethnic-specific expressions of anger. Hatfield, Rapson, and Le (2009) conducted a study that measured ethnic differences in emotional expression using participants from the Philippines, Hawaii, China, and Europe. They concluded that there was a difference between how someone expresses an emotion, especially the emotion of anger in people with different ethnicities, based on frequency, with Europeans showing the lowest frequency of expression of negative emotions.

Other research investigates anger within different ethnic groups who live in the same country. Researchers explored whether Black Americans experience and express greater anger than Whites (Mabry &amp; Kiecolt, 2005). They found that, after controlling for sex and age, Black participants did not feel or express more anger than Whites. Deffenbacher and Swaim (1999) compared the expression of anger in Mexican American people and White non-Hispanic American people. They concluded that White non-Hispanic Americans expressed more verbal aggression than Mexican Americans, although when it came to physical aggression expressions there was no significant difference between both cultures when it came to anger.

==Causes==
Some animals make loud sounds, attempt to look physically larger, bare their teeth, and stare. The behaviors associated with anger are designed to warn aggressors to stop their threatening behavior. Rarely does a physical altercation occur without the prior expression of anger by at least one of the participants. Displays of anger can be used as a manipulation strategy for social influence.

People feel really angry when they sense that they or someone they care about has been offended, when they are certain about the nature and cause of the angering event, when they are convinced someone else is responsible, and when they feel they can still influence the situation or cope with it. For instance, if a person&#x27;s car is damaged, they will feel angry if someone else did it (e.g. another driver rear-ended it), but will feel sadness instead if it was caused by situational forces (e.g. a hailstorm) or guilt and shame if they were personally responsible (e.g. they crashed into a wall out of momentary carelessness). Psychotherapist Michael C. Graham defines anger in terms of our expectations and assumptions about the world. Graham states anger almost always results when we are caught up &quot;...expecting the world to be different than it is&quot;.

Usually, those who experience anger explain its arousal as a result of &quot;what has happened to them&quot; and in most cases the described provocations occur immediately before the anger experience. Such explanations confirm the illusion that anger has a discrete external cause. The angry person usually finds the cause of their anger in an intentional, personal, and controllable aspect of another person&#x27;s behavior. This explanation is based on the intuitions of the angry person who experiences a loss in self-monitoring capacity and objective observability as a result of their emotion. Anger can be of multicausal origin, some of which may be remote events, but people rarely find more than &quot;one&quot; cause for their anger. According to Novaco, &quot;Anger experiences are embedded or nested within an environmental-temporal context. Disturbances that may not have involved anger at the outset leave residues that are not readily recognized but that operate as a lingering backdrop for focal provocations (of anger).&quot; According to Encyclopædia Britannica, an internal infection can cause pain which in turn can activate anger. According to cognitive consistency theory, anger is caused by an inconsistency between a desired, or expected, situation and the actually perceived situation, and triggers responses, such as aggressive behavior, with the expected consequence of reducing the inconsistency. Sleep deprivation also seems to be a cause of anger.

==Cognitive effects==
Anger causes a reduction in cognitive ability and the accurate processing of external stimuli. Dangers seem smaller, actions seem less risky, ventures seem more likely to succeed, and unfortunate events seem less likely. Angry people are more likely to make risky decisions, and make less realistic risk assessments. In one study, test subjects primed to feel angry felt less likely to have heart disease, and more likely to receive a pay raise, compared to fearful people. This tendency can manifest in retrospective thinking as well: in a 2005 study, angry subjects said they thought the risks of terrorism in the year following 9/11 in retrospect were low, compared to what the fearful and neutral subjects thought.

In inter-group relationships, anger makes people think in more negative and prejudiced terms about outsiders. Anger makes people less trusting, and slower to attribute good qualities to outsiders.

When a group is in conflict with a rival group, it will feel more anger if it is the politically stronger group and less anger when it is the weaker.

Unlike other negative emotions like sadness and fear, angry people are more likely to demonstrate correspondence bias – the tendency to blame a person&#x27;s behavior more on his nature than on his circumstances. They tend to rely more on stereotypes, and pay less attention to details and more attention to the superficial. In this regard, anger is unlike other &quot;negative&quot; emotions such as sadness and fear, which promote analytical thinking.

An angry person tends to anticipate other events that might cause them anger. They will tend to rate anger-causing events (e.g. being sold a faulty car) as more likely than sad events (e.g. a good friend moving away).

A person who is angry tends to place more blame on another person for their misery. This can create a feedback, as this extra blame can make the angry person angrier still, so they in turn place yet more blame on the other person.

When people are in a certain emotional state, they tend to pay more attention to, or remember, things that are charged with the same emotion; so it is with anger. For instance, if a person is trying to persuade someone that a tax increase is necessary, if the person is currently feeling angry, they would do better to use an argument that elicits anger (&quot;more criminals will escape justice&quot;) than, say, an argument that elicits sadness (&quot;there will be fewer welfare benefits for disabled children&quot;). Also, unlike other negative emotions, which focus attention on all negative events, anger only focuses attention on anger-causing events.

Anger can make a person more desiring of an object to which his anger is tied. In a 2010 Dutch study, test subjects were primed to feel anger or fear by being shown an image of an angry or fearful face, and then were shown an image of a random object. When subjects were made to feel angry, they expressed more desire to possess that object than subjects who had been primed to feel fear.

==Expressive strategies==
As with any emotion, the display of anger can be feigned or exaggerated. Studies by Hochschild and Sutton have shown that the show of anger is likely to be an effective manipulation strategy in order to change and design attitudes. Anger is a distinct strategy of social influence and its use (e.g. belligerent behaviors) as a goal achievement mechanism proves to be a successful strategy.

Larissa Tiedens, known for her studies of anger, claimed that expression of feelings would cause a powerful influence not only on the perception of the expresser but also on their power position in the society. She studied the correlation between anger expression and social influence perception. Previous researchers, such as Keating, 1985 have found that people with angry face expression were perceived as powerful and as in a high social position. Similarly, Tiedens et al. have revealed that people who compared scenarios involving an angry and a sad character, attributed a higher social status to the angry character. Tiedens examined in her study whether anger expression promotes status attribution. In other words, whether anger contributes to perceptions or legitimization of others&#x27; behaviors. Her findings clearly indicated that participants who were exposed to either an angry or a sad person were inclined to express support for the angry person rather than for a sad one. In addition, it was found that a reason for that decision originates from the fact that the person expressing anger was perceived as an ability owner, and was attributed a certain social status accordingly.

Showing anger during a negotiation may increase the ability of the anger expresser to succeed in negotiation. A study by Tiedens et al. indicated that the anger expressers were perceived as stubborn, dominant and powerful. In addition, it was found that people were inclined to easily give up to those who were perceived by them as powerful and stubborn, rather than soft and submissive. Based on these findings Sinaceur and Tiedens have found that people conceded more to the angry side rather than for the non-angry one.

A question raised by Van Kleef et al. based on these findings was whether expression of emotion influences others, since it is known that people use emotional information to conclude about others&#x27; limits and match their demands in negotiation accordingly. Van Kleef et al. wanted to explore whether people give up more easily to an angry opponent or to a happy opponent. Findings revealed that participants tended to be more flexible toward an angry opponent compared with a happy opponent. These results strengthen the argument that participants analyze the opponent&#x27;s emotion to conclude about their limits and carry out their decisions accordingly.

==Coping strategies==
===Therapy and behavioral strategies===
According to Leland R. Beaumont, each instance of anger demands making a choice. A person can respond with hostile action, including overt violence, or they can respond with hostile inaction, such as withdrawing or stonewalling. Other options include initiating a dominance contest; harboring resentment; or working to better understand and constructively resolve the issue.

According to Raymond Novaco, there are a multitude of steps that were researched in attempting to deal with this emotion. In order to manage anger the problems involved in the anger should be discussed, Novaco suggests. The situations leading to anger should be explored by the person.

Conventional therapies for anger involve restructuring thoughts and beliefs to bring about a reduction in anger. These therapies often come within the schools of CBT (or cognitive behavioral therapy) like modern systems such as REBT (rational emotive behavior therapy). Research shows that people with excessive anger often harbor and act on dysfunctional attributions, assumptions and evaluations in specific situations. It has been shown that with therapy by a trained professional, individuals can bring their anger to more manageable levels. The therapy is followed by the so-called &quot;stress inoculation&quot; in which the clients are taught &quot;relaxation skills to control their arousal and various cognitive controls to exercise on their attention, thoughts, images, and feelings. &quot;Logic defeats anger, because anger, even when it&#x27;s justified, can quickly become irrational.&quot; (American Psychological Association). In other words, although there may be a rational reason to get angry, the frustrated actions of the subject can become irrational. Taking deep breaths is regarded as the first step to calming down. Once the anger has subsided a little, the patient will accept that they are frustrated and move on. Lingering around the source of frustration may bring the rage back.

The skills-deficit model states that poor social skills is what renders a person incapable of expressing anger in an appropriate manner. Social skills training has been found to be an effective method for reducing exaggerated anger by offering alternative coping skills to the angry individual. Research has found that persons who are prepared for aversive events find them less threatening, and excitatory reactions are significantly reduced. In a 1981 study, that used modeling, behavior rehearsal, and videotaped feedback to increase anger control skills, showed increases in anger control among aggressive youth in the study. Research conducted with youthful offenders using a social skills training program (aggression replacement training), found significant reductions in anger, and increases in anger control. Research has also found that antisocial personalities are more likely to learn avoidance tasks when the consequences involved obtaining or losing tangible rewards. Learning among antisocial personalities also occurred better when they were involved with high intensity stimulation. Social learning theory states that positive stimulation was not compatible with hostile or aggressive reactions. Anger research has also studied the effects of reducing anger among adults with antisocial personality disorder (ASPD), with a social skills program approach that used a low fear and high arousal group setting. This research found that low fear messages were less provocative to the ASPD population, and high positive arousal stimulated their ability to concentrate, and subsequently learn new skills for anger reduction.

A new integrative approach to anger treatment has been formulated by Fernandez (2010). Termed CBAT, for cognitive behavioral affective therapy, this treatment goes beyond conventional relaxation and reappraisal by adding cognitive and behavioral techniques and supplementing them with effective techniques to deal with the feeling of anger. The techniques are sequenced contingently in three phases of treatment: prevention, intervention, and postvention. In this way, people can be trained to deal with the onset of anger, its progression, and the residual features of anger.

===Medication therapy===

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses suggest that certain psychiatric medications may be effective in controlling symptoms of anger, hostility, and irritability. These include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants like sertraline, certain anticonvulsant mood stabilizers, antipsychotics like aripiprazole, risperidone, and olanzapine, and benzodiazepines like midazolam, among others. Another meta-analysis of antidepressants and aggression found no change in aggression in adults and increased aggression in children. Psychostimulants like methylphenidate and amphetamines as well as the atypical antipsychotic risperidone are useful in reducing aggression and oppositionality in children and adolescents with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), antisocial personality disorder, and autism spectrum disorder with moderate to large effect sizes and greater effectiveness than other studied medications. Yet another meta-analysis found that methylphenidate slightly reduced irritability while amphetamines increased the risk of irritability several-fold in children with ADHD. Other research has found no impact of amphetamine or methamphetamine on aggression in humans.

===Suppression===
Modern psychologists point out that suppression of anger may have harmful effects. The suppressed anger may find another outlet, such as a physical symptom, or become more extreme. John W. Fiero cites Los Angeles riots of 1992 as an example of sudden, explosive release of suppressed anger. The anger was then displaced as violence against those who had nothing to do with the matter. There is also the case of Francine Hughes, who suffered 13 years of domestic abuse. Her suppressed anger drove her to kill her abuser husband. It is claimed that a majority of female victims of domestic violence who suppress their aggressive feelings are unable to recognize, experience, and process negative emotion and this has a destabilising influence on their perception of agency in their relationships. Another example of widespread deflection of anger from its actual cause toward scapegoating, Fiero says, was the blaming of Jews for the economic ills of Germany by the Nazis.

Some psychologists criticized the catharsis theory of aggression, which suggests that releasing pent-up anger reduces aggression. On the other hand, there are experts who maintain that suppression does not eliminate anger since it merely forbids the expression of anger and this is also the case for repression, which merely hides anger from awareness. There are also studies that link suppressed anger and medical conditions such as hypertension, coronary artery disease, and cancer. Suppressed or repressed anger is found to cause irritable bowel syndrome, eating disorders, and depression among women. Suppression is also referred to as a form of &quot;self-silencing&quot;, which is described as a cognitive activity wherein an individual monitors the self and eliminate thoughts and feelings that are perceived to be dangerous to relationships. Anger suppression is also associated with higher rates of suicide.

==Dual threshold model==
Anger expression might have negative outcomes for individuals and organizations as well, such as decrease of productivity. and increase of job stress, It could also have positive outcomes, such as increased work motivation, improved relationships and increased mutual understanding (for ex. Tiedens, 2000). A Dual Threshold Model of Anger in organizations by Geddes and Callister, (2007) provides an explanation on the valence of anger expression outcomes. The model suggests that organizational norms establish emotion thresholds that may be crossed when employees feel anger. The first &quot;expression threshold&quot; is crossed when an organizational member conveys felt anger to individuals at work who are associated with or able to address the anger-provoking situation. The second &quot;impropriety threshold&quot; is crossed if or when organizational members go too far while expressing anger such that observers and other company personnel find their actions socially and/or culturally inappropriate.

The higher probability of negative outcomes from workplace anger likely will occur in either of two situations. The first is when organizational members suppress rather than express their anger—that is, they fail to cross the &quot;expression threshold&quot;. In this instance personnel who might be able to address or resolve the anger-provoking condition or event remain unaware of the problem, allowing it to continue, along with the affected individual&#x27;s anger. The second is when organizational members cross both thresholds—&quot;double cross&quot;— displaying anger that is perceived as deviant. In such cases the angry person is seen as the problem—increasing chances of organizational sanctions against him or her while diverting attention away from the initial anger-provoking incident. In contrast, a higher probability of positive outcomes from workplace anger expression likely will occur when one&#x27;s expressed anger stays in the space between the expression and impropriety thresholds. Here, one expresses anger in a way fellow organizational members find acceptable, prompting exchanges and discussions that may help resolve concerns to the satisfaction of all parties involved. This space between the thresholds varies among different organizations and also can be changed in organization itself: when the change is directed to support anger displays; the space between the thresholds will be expanded and when the change is directed to suppressing such displays; the space will be reduced.

== Physiology ==
Neuroscience has shown that emotions are generated by multiple structures in the brain. The rapid, minimal, and evaluative processing of the emotional significance of the sensory data is done when the data passes through the amygdala in its travel from the sensory organs along certain neural pathways towards the limbic forebrain. Emotion caused by discrimination of stimulus features, thoughts, or memories occurs when its information is relayed from the thalamus to the neocortex. Based on some statistical analysis, some scholars have suggested that the tendency for anger may be genetic. Distinguishing between genetic and environmental factors requires further research and actual measurement of specific genes and environments.

In neuroimaging studies of anger, the most consistently activated region of the brain was the lateral orbitofrontal cortex. This region is associated with approach motivation and positive affective processes.

The external expression of anger can be found in physiological responses, facial expressions, body language, and at times in public acts of aggression. The rib cage tenses and breathing through the nose becomes faster, deeper, and irregular. Anger activates the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. The catecholamine activation is more strongly norepinephrine than epinephrine. Heart rate and blood pressure increase. Blood flows to the hands. Perspiration increases (particularly when the anger is intense). The face flushes. The nostrils flare. The jaw tenses. The brow muscles move inward and downward, fixing a hard stare on the target. The arms are raised and a squared-off stance is adopted. The body is mobilized for immediate action, often manifesting as a subjective sense of strength, self-assurance, and potency. This may encourage the impulse to strike out.

== Measuring anger ==

=== The Gallup World Poll ===
Every year, Gallup asks people in over 140 countries, &quot;did you experience anger during a lot of the day yesterday?&quot; In 2021, Gallup found that 23% of adults experienced a lot of anger, which is up from 18% in 2014. The countries that experienced the most anger were Lebanon, Turkey, Armenia, Iraq, and Afghanistan; the countries that experience the least anger were Finland, Mauritius, Estonia, Portugal, and the Netherlands.

=== Self-reports of Psychological Anger ===
The most common way to measure anger has been through the use of self-report measures. It is currently thought there are just under 50 measures of psychological anger.

The Spielberger State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory and the Novaco Anger Scale and Provocation Inventory are widely recognized and frequently used self-report measures for assessing anger, focusing on various aspects of anger expression including outward, inward, and controlled expressions. Additionally, various anger scales draw on different perspectives, such as cognitive processes of anger rumination, anger as behavioral and cognitive responses to avoidance, assertion, and social support, cognitive and emotional aspects of irritability, functional and dysfunctional responses and goal-oriented behavior in response to anger, experiences of anger, and positive beliefs about anger. Some approaches even consider anger as being reciprocally related to frustration and hostility.

In 2023, a study revealed that the relationships between 46 subscales of publicly available self-report measures of anger suggest five primary factors. These factors suggest a model of five key dimensions to anger; anger-arousal, anger-rumination, frustration-discomfort, anger-regulation, and socially constituted anger. The proposed five-factor model is based on various theoretical contexts and provides a useful framework for examining the distinct domains of anger.

* Anger-arousal, which acknowledges the commonly observed existence of anger expressions in everyday life. This domain highlights the tendency for frequent and intense anger experiences and offers a means to examine how anger can represent an individual&#x27;s stable and predictable responses to different situations.
* Anger-rumination, which centers around the cognitive and emotional processes that occur within an individual regarding anger and the cognitive appraisals and action tendencies in response to perceived wrong-doings. This domain offers an opportunity to examine anger within the broader context of rumination and explore how metacognitive beliefs about emotional stress, like anger, can lead to behavioral and emotional dysregulation, such as depression.
* Frustration-discomfort, which reflects measures that are tailored to Rational-Emotive Behavior Theory, which explore absolutistic and demand-related beliefs related to entitlement, achievement, and alleviating discomfort. This domain provides an opportunity to examine how our cognitive beliefs give rise to expressions of anger.
* Anger-regulation, which reflects cognitive strategies or processes that modify the expression and experience of anger. This domain provides a chance to examine coping strategies, such as avoidance, seeking distraction, and downplaying, which are common ways of managing stressful situations related to anger.
* Socially constituted anger, which takes a socially constructed perspective on anger, and views anger as operating within social dominance and conflict dynamics. This approach recognizes that the recognition of anger in others can reveal their possible motivations and highlight potential disagreements between individuals&#x27; values; particularly in terms of within the protection and enhancement of the self, social norms, and the extent to which anger is constructed via joint understandings of the world.

The study suggests a number of existing subscales that can be used to measure these five domains of anger.

==Philosophical perspectives==
===Ancient history===
Ancient Greek philosophers, describing and commenting on the uncontrolled anger, particularly toward slaves, in their society generally showed a hostile attitude towards anger. Galen and Seneca regarded anger as a kind of madness. They all rejected the spontaneous, uncontrolled fits of anger and agreed on both the possibility and value of controlling anger. There were disagreements regarding the value of anger. For Seneca, anger was &quot;worthless even for war&quot;. Seneca believed that the disciplined Roman army was regularly able to beat the Germans, who were known for their fury. He argued that &quot;...in sporting contests, it is a mistake to become angry&quot;.

Aristotle on the other hand, ascribed some value to anger that has arisen from perceived injustice because it is useful for preventing injustice. Furthermore, the opposite of anger is a kind of insensibility, Aristotle stated. The difference in people&#x27;s temperaments was generally viewed as a result of the different mix of qualities or humors people contained. Seneca held that &quot;red-haired and red-faced people are hot-tempered because of excessive hot and dry humors&quot;. Ancient philosophers rarely refer to women&#x27;s anger at all, according to Simon Kemp and K.T. Strongman perhaps because their works were not intended for women. Some of them that discuss it, such as Seneca, considered women to be more prone to anger than men.

====Control methods====

Seneca addresses the question of mastering anger in three parts: 1. how to avoid becoming angry in the first place 2. how to cease being angry and 3. how to deal with anger in others. Seneca suggests, to avoid becoming angry in the first place, that the many faults of anger should be repeatedly remembered. One should avoid being too busy or dealing with anger-provoking people. Unnecessary hunger or thirst should be avoided and soothing music be listened to. To cease being angry, Seneca suggests 

Seneca further advises daily self-inquisition about one&#x27;s bad habit. To deal with anger in others, Seneca suggests that the best reaction is to keep calm. A certain kind of deception, Seneca says, is necessary in dealing with angry people.

Galen repeats Seneca&#x27;s points but adds a new one: finding a guide and teacher can help the person in controlling their passions. Galen also gives some hints for finding a good teacher. Both Seneca and Galen (and later philosophers) agree that the process of controlling anger should start in childhood on grounds of malleability. Seneca warns that this education should not blunt the spirit of the children nor should they be humiliated or treated severely. At the same time, they should not be pampered. Children, Seneca says, should learn not to beat their playmates and not to become angry with them. Seneca also advises that children&#x27;s requests should not be granted when they are angry.

===Post-classical history===

During the period of the Roman Empire and the Middle Ages, philosophers elaborated on the existing conception of anger, many of whom did not make major contributions to the concept. For example, many medieval philosophers such as Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Roger Bacon and Thomas Aquinas agreed with ancient philosophers that animals cannot become angry. On the other hand, al-Ghazali (Algazel), who often disagreed with Aristotle and Ibn Sina on many issues, argued that animals do possess anger as one of the three &quot;powers&quot; in their heart, the other two being appetite and impulse. He also argued that animal will is &quot;conditioned by anger and appetite&quot; in contrast to human will which is &quot;conditioned by the intellect&quot;. A common medieval belief was that those prone to anger had an excess of yellow bile or choler (hence the word &quot;choleric&quot;). This belief was related to Seneca&#x27;s belief that &quot;red-haired and red-faced people are hot-tempered because of excessive hot and dry humors&quot;.

====By gender====
Wrath was sinful because of the social problems it caused, sometimes even homicide. It served to ignore those who are present, contradicts those who are absent, produces insults, and responds harshly to insults that are received. Aristotle felt that anger or wrath was a natural outburst of self-defense in situations where people felt they had been wronged. Aquinas felt that if anger was justified, it was not a sin. For example, &quot;He that is angry without cause, shall be in danger; but he that is angry with cause, shall not be in danger: for without anger, teaching will be useless, judgments unstable, crimes unchecked. Therefore to be angry is not always an evil.&quot;

The concept of wrath contributed to a definition of gender and power. Many medieval authors in 1200 agreed the differences between men and women were based on complexion, shape, and disposition. Complexion involved the balance of the four fundamental qualities of heat, coldness, moistness, and dryness. When various combinations of these qualities are made they define groups of certain people as well as individuals. Hippocrates, Aristotle, and Galen all agreed on that, in terms of biology and sexual differentiation, heat was the most important of the qualities because it determined shape and disposition. Disposition included a balance of the previous four qualities, the four elements and the four humors. For example, the element of fire shared the qualities of heat and dryness: fire dominated in yellow bile or choler, meaning a choleric person was more or hot and dry than others. Hot and dry individuals were active, dominant, and aggressive. The opposite was true with the element of water. Water, is cold and moist, related closely to phlegm: people with more phlegmatic personalities were passive and submissive. While these trait clusters varied from individual to individual most authors in the Middle Ages assumed certain clusters of traits characterized men more than women and vice versa.

=====Women=====
Scholars posted that females were seen by authors in the Middle Ages to be more phlegmatic (cold and wet) than males, meaning females were more sedentary and passive than males. Women&#x27;s passive nature appeared &quot;natural&quot; due to their lack of power when compared to men. Aristotle identified traits he believed women shared: female, feminine, passive, focused on matter, inactive, and inferior. Thus medieval women were supposed to act submissively toward men and relinquish control to their husbands. Hildegard of Bingen believed women were fully capable of anger. While most women were phlegmatic, individual women under certain circumstances could also be choleric.

=====Men=====
Medieval scholars believed most men were choleric, or hot and dry. Thus they were dominant and aggressive. (Barton) Aristotle also identified characteristics of men: male, masculine, active, focused on form, potent, outstanding, and superior. Men were aware of the power they held. Given their choleric &quot;nature&quot;, men exhibited hot temperatures and were quick to anger. Peter of Albano once said, &quot;The male&#x27;s spirit, is lively, given to violent impulse; [it is] slow getting angry and slower being calmed.&quot; Medieval ideas of gender assumed men were more rational than women. Masculinity involved a wide range of possible behaviors, and men were not angry all the time. Every man&#x27;s humoral balance was different, some men were strong, others weak, also some more prone to wrath than others. There are those who view anger as a manly act. For instance, David Brakke maintained:

====Control methods====
Maimonides considered being given to uncontrollable passions as a kind of illness. Like Galen, Maimonides suggested seeking out a philosopher for curing this illness just as one seeks out a physician for curing bodily illnesses. Roger Bacon elaborates Seneca&#x27;s advices. Many medieval writers discuss at length the evils of anger and the virtues of temperance. In a discussion of confession, John Mirk, an English 14th-century Augustinian writer, tells priests how to advise the penitent by considering the spiritual and social consequences of anger:

In &quot;The Canon of Medicine&quot;, Ibn Sina (Avicenna) modified the theory of temperaments and argued that anger heralded the transition of melancholia to mania, and explained that humidity inside the head can contribute to such mood disorders.

On the other hand, Ahmed ibn Sahl al-Balkhi classified anger (along with aggression) as a type of neurosis, while al-Ghazali argued that anger takes form in rage, indignation and revenge, and that &quot;the powers of the soul become balanced if it keeps anger under control&quot;.

===Modern perspectives===
Immanuel Kant rejects revenge as vicious. Regarding the latter, David Hume argues that because &quot;anger and hatred are passions inherent in our very frame and constitution, the lack of them is sometimes evidence of weakness and imbecility&quot;. Martha Nussbaum has also agreed that even &quot;great injustice&quot; is no &quot;excuse for childish and undisciplined behavior&quot;. Two main differences between the modern understanding and ancient understanding of anger can be detected, Kemp and Strongman state: one is that early philosophers were not concerned with possible harmful effects of the suppression of anger; the other is that, recently, studies of anger take the issue of gender differences into account. Soraya Chemaly has in contrast argued that anger is &quot;a critically useful and positive emotion&quot; which &quot;warns us, as humans, that something is wrong and needs to change&quot; when &quot;being threatened with indignity, physical harm, humiliation and unfairness&quot; and therefore &quot;a powerful force for political good&quot;. Furthermore, she argues that women and minorities are not allowed to be angry to the same extent as white men. In a similar vein, Rebecca Traister has argued that holding back anger has been an impediment to the progress of women&#x27;s rights.

The American psychologist Albert Ellis has suggested that anger, rage, and fury partly have roots in the philosophical meanings and assumptions through which human beings interpret . According to Ellis, these emotions are often associated and related to the leaning humans have to absolutistically depreciating and damning other peoples&#x27; humanity when their personal rules and domain are transgressed.

==Religious perspectives==
===Judaism===

In Judaism, anger is a negative trait. In the Book of Genesis, Jacob condemned the anger that had arisen in his sons Simon and Levi: &quot;Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel.&quot;

Restraining oneself from anger is seen as noble and desirable, as Ethics of the Fathers states:

Maimonides rules that one who becomes angry is as though that person had worshipped idols. Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi explains that the parallel between anger and idol worship is that by becoming angry, one shows a disregard of Divine Providence – whatever had caused the anger was ultimately ordained from Above – and that through coming to anger one thereby denies the hand of God in one&#x27;s life.

In its section dealing with ethical traits a person should adopt, the &quot;Kitzur Shulchan Aruch&quot; states: &quot;Anger is also a very evil trait and it should be avoided at all costs. You should train yourself not to become angry even if you have a good reason to be angry.&quot;

In modern writings, Rabbi Harold Kushner finds no grounds for anger toward God because &quot;our misfortunes are none of His doing&quot;. In contrast to Kushner&#x27;s reading of the Bible, David Blumenthal finds an &quot;abusing God&quot; whose &quot;sometimes evil&quot; actions evoke vigorous protest, but without severing the protester&#x27;s relationship with God.

===Christianity===
Both Catholic and Protestant writers have addressed anger in different perspectives.

====Catholic====

Wrath is one of the Seven Deadly Sins in Catholicism; and yet the Catechism of the Catholic Church states (canons 1772 and 1773) that anger is among the passions, and that &quot;in the passions, as movements of the sensitive appetite, there is neither good nor evil&quot;. The neutral act of anger becomes the sin of wrath when it is directed against an innocent person, when it is unduly unbending or long-lasting, or when it desires excessive punishment. &quot;If anger reaches the point of a deliberate desire to kill or seriously wound a neighbor, it is gravely against charity; it is a mortal sin&quot; (CCC 2302). Hatred is the sin of desiring that someone else may suffer misfortune or evil, and is a mortal sin when one desires grave harm (CCC 2302-03).

Medieval Christianity vigorously denounced wrath as one of the seven cardinal, or deadly sins, but some Christian writers at times regarded the anger caused by injustice as having some value. Saint Basil viewed anger as a &quot;reprehensible temporary madness&quot;. Joseph F. Delany in the Catholic Encyclopedia (1914) defines anger as &quot;the desire of vengeance&quot; and states that a reasonable vengeance and passion is ethical and praiseworthy. Vengeance is sinful when it exceeds its limits in which case it becomes opposed to justice and charity. For example, &quot;vengeance upon one who has not deserved it, or to a greater extent than it has been deserved, or in conflict with the dispositions of law, or from an improper motive&quot; are all sinful. An unduly vehement vengeance is considered a venial sin unless it seriously goes counter to the love of God or of one&#x27;s neighbor.

A more positive view of anger is espoused by Roman Catholic pastoral theologian Henri J.M. Nouwen. Father Nouwen points to the spiritual benefits in anger toward God as found in both the Old Testament and New Testament of the Bible. In the Bible, says Father Nouwen, &quot;it is clear that only by expressing our anger and hatred directly to God will we come to know the fullness of both his love and our freedom&quot;.

Georges Bernanos illustrates Nouwen&#x27;s position in his novel &quot;The Diary of a Country Priest&quot;. The countess gave birth to the son she had long wanted, but the child died. She was fiercely angry. When the priest called, the countess vented her anger toward her daughter and husband, then at the priest who responded gently, &quot;open your heart to [God]&quot;. The countess rejoined, &quot;I&#x27;ve ceased to bother about God. When you&#x27;ve forced me to admit that I hate Him, will you be any better off?&quot; The priest continued, &quot;you no longer hate Him. Hate is indifference and contempt. Now at last you&#x27;re face to face with Him... Shake your fist at Him, spit in His face, scourge Him.&quot; The countess did what the priest counseled. By confessing her hate, she was enabled to say, &quot;all&#x27;s well&quot;.

====Protestant====

Everyone experiences anger, Andrew D. Lester observes, and furthermore anger can serve as &quot;a spiritual friend, a spiritual guide, and a spiritual ally&quot;. Denying and suppressing anger is contrary to St. Paul&#x27;s admonition in his Epistle to the Ephesians 4:26. When anger toward God is denied and suppressed, it interferes with an individual&#x27;s relation with God. Expressing one&#x27;s anger toward God can deepen the relationship. C. FitzSimons Allison holds that &quot;we worship God by expressing our honest anger at him&quot;.

Biblical scholar Leonard Pine concludes from his studies in the Book of Habakkuk that &quot;far from being a sin, proper remonstration with God is the activity of a healthy faith relationship with Him&quot;. Other biblical examples of anger toward God include the following:
* Moses was angry with God for mistreating his people: &quot;Lord, why have you mistreated [&quot;lit.&quot; done evil to] this people?&quot; (Book of Exodus 5:22).
* Naomi was angry with God after the death of her husband and two sons: &quot;The Almighty has dealt bitterly with me. The Almighty has brought calamity upon me&quot; (Book of Ruth 1:20–21 &quot;abr&quot;).
* Elijah was angry with God after the son of the widow died: &quot;O Lord my God, have you brought calamity even upon the widow with whom I am staying, by killing her son?&quot; (1 Kings 17:20).
* Job was angry with God: &quot;You have turned cruel to me; with the might of your hand you persecute me&quot; (Book of Job 30:21).
* Jeremiah was angry with God for deceiving his people: &quot;Ah, Lord God, how utterly you have deceived this people and Jerusalem&quot; (Book of Jeremiah 4:10).

===Hinduism===
In Hinduism, anger is equated with sorrow as a form of unrequited desire. The objects of anger are perceived as a hindrance to the gratification of the desires of the angry person. Alternatively if one thinks one is superior, the result is grief. Anger is considered to be packed with more evil power than desire. In the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna regards greed, anger, and lust as signs of ignorance that lead to perpetual bondage. As for the agitations of the bickering mind, they are divided into two divisions. The first is called avirodha-prīti, or unrestricted attachment, and the other is called virodha-yukta-krodha, anger arising from frustration. Adherence to the philosophy of the Māyāvādīs, belief in the fruitive results of the karma-vādīs, and belief in plans based on materialistic desires are called avirodha-prīti.

Jñānīs, karmīs and materialistic planmakers generally attract the attention of conditioned souls, but when the materialists cannot fulfill their plans and when their devices are frustrated, they become angry. Frustration of material desires produces anger.

===Buddhism===
Anger is defined in Buddhism as: &quot;being unable to bear the object, or the intention to cause harm to the object&quot;. Anger is seen as aversion with a stronger exaggeration, and is listed as one of the five hindrances. Buddhist monks, such as Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibetans in exile, sometimes get angry. Most often a spiritual person is aware of the emotion and the way it can be handled. Thus, in response to the question: &quot;Is any anger acceptable in Buddhism?&#x27; the Dalai Lama answered: 
Buddhist scholar and author Geshe Kelsang Gyatso has also explained Buddha&#x27;s teaching on the spiritual imperative to identify anger and overcome it by transforming difficulties:

The Buddha himself on anger:
===Islam===
A verse in the third surah of the Quran instructs people to restrain their anger.

Anger (Arabic: غضب, &quot;ghadab&quot;) in Islam is considered to be instigated by Satan (&quot;Shaitan&quot;). Factors stated to lead to anger include selfishness, arrogance and excessive ambition. Islamic teachings also state that anger hinders the faith (&quot;iman&quot;) of a person. The Quran attributes anger to prophets and believers as well as Muhammad&#x27;s enemies. It mentions the anger of Moses (&quot;Musa&quot;) against his people for worshiping a golden calf and at the moment when Moses strikes an Egyptian for fighting against an Israelite. The anger of Jonah (&quot;Yunus&quot;) is also mentioned in the Quran, which led to his departure from the people of Nineveh and his eventual realization of his error and his repentance. The removal of anger from the hearts of believers by God (Arabic:  &quot;&quot;) after the fighting against Muhammad&#x27;s enemies is over. In general, suppression of anger (Arabic: كَظم, &quot;kazm&quot;) is deemed a praiseworthy quality in the hadis. Ibn Abdil Barr, the Andalusian Maliki jurist explains that controlling anger is the door way for restraining other blameworthy traits ego and envy, since these two are less powerful than anger. The hadis state various ways to diminish, prevent and control anger. One of these methods is to perform a ritual ablution, a different narration states that the angry person should lie down and other narrations instruct the angry person to invoke God and seek refuge from the Devil, by reciting &quot;I take refuge with Allah/God from the accursed Devil.&quot;

Ali, the cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad said &quot;A moment of patience in a moment of anger saves a thousand moments of regret&quot; and &quot;Anger begins with madness, and ends in regret.&quot;

===Divine retribution===

In many religions, anger is frequently attributed to God or gods. Primitive people held that gods were subject to anger and revenge in anthropomorphic fashion. The Hebrew Bible says that opposition to God&#x27;s will results in God&#x27;s anger. Reform rabbi Kaufmann Kohler explains:
 Christians believe in God&#x27;s anger at the sight of evil. This anger is not inconsistent with God&#x27;s love, as demonstrated in the Gospel where the righteous indignation of Christ is shown in the Cleansing of the Temple.

<doc id="68674" wikidata="Q28692" url="?curid=68674" title="Anise">
<text>Anise (; ), also called aniseed or rarely anix, is a flowering plant in the family Apiaceae native to the eastern Mediterranean region and Southwest Asia.

The flavor and aroma of its seeds have similarities with some other spices and herbs, such as star anise, fennel, liquorice, and tarragon. It is widely cultivated and used to flavor food, candy, and alcoholic drinks, especially around the Mediterranean.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;anise&quot; is derived via Old French from the Latin words or from Greek &quot;ánēthon&quot; referring to dill.

An obsolete English word for anise is &quot;anet&quot;, also coming from &quot;anīsum&quot;.

== Botany ==
Anise is an herbaceous annual plant growing to or more. The leaves at the base of the plant are simple, long and shallowly lobed, while leaves higher on the stems are feathery or lacy, pinnate, divided into numerous small leaflets.

Both leaves and flowers are produced in large, loose clusters. The flowers are either white or yellow, approximately in diameter, produced in dense umbels.

The fruit is a dry oblong and curved schizocarp, long, usually called &quot;aniseed&quot;.

== Ecology ==
Anise is a food plant for the larvae of some Lepidoptera species (butterflies and moths), including the lime-speck pug and wormwood pug.

== Cultivation ==
Anise was first cultivated in Egypt and the Middle East, and was brought to Europe for its medicinal value. It has been cultivated in Egypt for approximately 4,000 years.

Anise plants grow best in light, fertile, well-drained soil. The seeds should be planted as soon as the ground warms up in spring. Because the plants have a taproot, they do not transplant well after being established so they should either be started in their final location or be transplanted while the seedlings are still small.

=== Production ===
Western cuisines have long used anise to flavor dishes, drinks, and candies. The word is used for both the species of herb and its licorice-like flavor. The most powerful flavor component of the essential oil of anise, anethole, is found in both anise and an unrelated spice indigenous to South China called star anise (&quot;Illicium verum&quot;) widely used in South Asian, Southeast Asian and East Asian dishes. Star anise is considerably less expensive to produce and has gradually displaced &quot;P. anisum&quot; in Western markets. While formerly produced in larger quantities, by 1999 world production of the essential oil of anise was only 8 tons, compared to 400 tons of star anise.

== Uses ==

=== Composition ===
As with all spices, the composition of anise varies considerably with origin and cultivation method. These are typical values for the main constituents.

:Moisture: 9–13%
:Protein: 18%
:Fatty oil: 8–23%
:Essential oil: 2–7%
:Starch: 5%
:N-free extract: 22–28%
:Crude fibre: 12–25%

In particular, the anise seeds products should also contain more than 0.2 milliliter volatile oil per 100 grams of spice.

=== Culinary ===
Anise is sweet and aromatic, distinguished by its characteristic flavor. The seeds, whole or ground, are used for preparation of teas and tisanes (alone or in combination with other aromatic herbs), as well many regional and ethnic confectioneries, including black jelly beans (often marketed as licorice-flavored), British aniseed balls, aniseed twists and &quot;troach&quot; drops, Australian humbugs, New Zealand aniseed wheels, Italian &quot;pizzelle&quot; and &quot;biscotti&quot;, German &quot;Pfeffernüsse&quot; and &quot;Springerle&quot;, Austrian &quot;Anisbögen&quot;, Dutch &quot;muisjes&quot;, New Mexican &quot;bizcochitos&quot; and Peruvian &quot;picarones.&quot;

The culinary uses of anise are not limited only to sweets and confections, as it is a key ingredient in Mexican &quot;atole de anís&quot; and &quot;champurrado&quot;, which is similar to hot chocolate. In India and Pakistan, it is taken as a digestive after meals, used in brines in the Italian region of Apulia and as a flavoring agent in Italian sausage, pepperoni and other Italian processed meat products. The freshly chopped leaves are added to cheese spreads, dips or salads, while roots and stems impart a mild licorice flavor to soups and stews.

The ancient Romans often served spiced cakes with aniseed called &quot;&quot; at the end of feasts as a digestive. This tradition of serving cake at the end of festivities is the basis for the tradition of serving cake at weddings.

=== Liquor ===

Anise is used to flavor Greek and Bulgarian ; Italian ; French , , and ; Spanish , , , and Herbs de Majorca; Turkish and Armenian ; Lebanese, Egyptian, Syrian, Jordanian, Palestinian and Israeli ; and Algerian . Outside the Mediterranean region, it is found in Colombian and Mexican . These liquors are clear, but on addition of water become cloudy, a phenomenon known as the ouzo effect.

Anise is used together with other herbs and spices in some root beers, such as Virgil&#x27;s in the United States.

=== Traditional medicine ===
The main use of anise in traditional European herbal medicine was for its carminative effect (reducing flatulence), as noted by John Gerard in his &quot;Great Herball&quot;, an early encyclopedia of herbal medicine:
The seed wasteth and consumeth winde, and is good against belchings and upbraidings of the stomach, alaieth gripings of the belly, provoketh urine gently, maketh abundance of milke, and stirreth up bodily lust: it staieth the laske (diarrhea), and also the white flux (leukorrhea) in women.

According to Pliny the Elder, anise was used as a cure for sleeplessness, chewed with alexanders and a little honey in the morning to freshen the breath, and, when mixed with wine, as a remedy for asp bites (N.H. 20.72). In 19th-century medicine, anise was prepared as &#x27; (&quot;Water of Anise&quot;) in doses of an ounce or more and as &#x27; (&quot;Spirit of Anise&quot;) in doses of 5–20 minims. In Turkish folk medicine, its seeds have been used as an appetite stimulant, tranquilizer or diuretic.

===Essential oil===
Anise essential oil can be obtained from the fruits by either steam distillation or extraction using supercritical carbon dioxide. The yield of essential oil is influenced by the growing conditions and extraction process, with supercritical extraction being more efficient. Regardless of the method of isolation the main component of the oil is anethole (80–90%), with minor components including 4-anisaldehyde, estragole and pseudoisoeugenyl-2-methylbutyrates amongst others. (Alternately found by Orav et al. 2008 to be 2–6% extracted oil by weight of raw seed material, 74–94% being &quot;trans&quot;-anethole and the remaining fraction estragole (methylchavicol), anisaldehyde and γ-himachalene.) Anethole is responsible for anise&#x27;s characteristic odor and flavor.

=== Other uses ===
Builders of steam locomotives in Britain incorporated capsules of aniseed oil into white metal plain bearings so the distinctive smell would give warning in case of overheating. Anise can be made into a liquid scent and is used for both drag hunting and fishing. It is put on fishing lures to attract fish.
