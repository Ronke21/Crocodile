<text>A polyomino is a plane geometric figure formed by joining one or more equal squares edge to edge. It is a polyform whose cells are squares. It may be regarded as a finite subset of the regular square tiling.

Polyominoes have been used in popular puzzles since at least 1907, and the enumeration of pentominoes is dated to antiquity. Many results with the pieces of 1 to 6 squares were first published in &quot;Fairy Chess Review&quot; between the years 1937 and 1957, under the name of &quot;dissection problems.&quot; The name &quot;polyomino&quot; was invented by Solomon W. Golomb in 1953, and it was popularized by Martin Gardner in a November 1960 &quot;Mathematical Games&quot; column in &quot;Scientific American&quot;.

Related to polyominoes are polyiamonds, formed from equilateral triangles; polyhexes, formed from regular hexagons; and other plane polyforms. Polyominoes have been generalized to higher dimensions by joining cubes to form polycubes, or hypercubes to form polyhypercubes.

In statistical physics, the study of polyominoes and their higher-dimensional analogs (which are often referred to as lattice animals in this literature) is applied to problems in physics and chemistry. Polyominoes have been used as models of branched polymers and of percolation clusters.

Like many puzzles in recreational mathematics, polyominoes raise many combinatorial problems. The most basic is enumerating polyominoes of a given size. No formula has been found except for special classes of polyominoes. A number of estimates are known, and there are algorithms for calculating them.

Polyominoes with holes are inconvenient for some purposes, such as tiling problems. In some contexts polyominoes with holes are excluded, allowing only simply connected polyominoes.
==Enumeration of polyominoes==
===Free, one-sided, and fixed polyominoes===
There are three common ways of distinguishing polyominoes for enumeration:

*&quot;free&quot; polyominoes are distinct when none is a rigid transformation (translation, rotation, reflection or glide reflection) of another (pieces that can be picked up and flipped over). Translating, rotating, reflecting, or glide reflecting a free polyomino does not change its shape.
*&quot;one-sided polyominoes&quot; are distinct when none is a translation or rotation of another (pieces that cannot be flipped over). Translating or rotating a one-sided polyomino does not change its shape.
*&quot;fixed&quot; polyominoes are distinct when none is a translation of another (pieces that can be neither flipped nor rotated). Translating a fixed polyomino will not change its shape.

The following table shows the numbers of polyominoes of various types with &quot;n&quot; cells.

Fixed polyominoes were enumerated in 2004 up to &quot;n&quot; = 56 by Iwan Jensen, and in 2024 up to &quot;n&quot; = 70 by Gill Barequet and Gil Ben-Shachar. 

Free polyominoes were enumerated in 2007 up to &quot;n&quot; = 28 by Tomás Oliveira e Silva, in 2012 up to &quot;n&quot; = 45 by Toshihiro Shirakawa, and in 2023 up to &quot;n&quot; = 50 by John Mason.

The above OEIS sequences, with the exception of A001419, include the count of 1 for the number of null-polyominoes; a null-polyomino is one that is formed of zero squares.

===Symmetries of polyominoes===
The dihedral group &quot;D&quot;4 is the group of symmetries (symmetry group) of a square. This group contains four rotations and four reflections. It is generated by alternating reflections about the &quot;x&quot;-axis and about a diagonal. One free polyomino corresponds to at most 8 fixed polyominoes, which are its images under the symmetries of &quot;D&quot;4. However, those images are not necessarily distinct: the more symmetry a free polyomino has, the fewer distinct fixed counterparts it has. Therefore, a free polyomino that is invariant under some or all non-trivial symmetries of &quot;D&quot;4 may correspond to only 4, 2 or 1 fixed polyominoes. Mathematically, free polyominoes are equivalence classes of fixed polyominoes under the group &quot;D&quot;4.

Polyominoes have the following possible symmetries; the least number of squares needed in a polyomino with that symmetry is given in each case:
*8 fixed polyominoes for each free polyomino:
**no symmetry (4)
*4 fixed polyominoes for each free polyomino:
**mirror symmetry with respect to one of the grid line directions (4)
**mirror symmetry with respect to a diagonal line (3)
**2-fold rotational symmetry: &quot;C&quot;2 (4)
*2 fixed polyominoes for each free polyomino:
**symmetry with respect to both grid line directions, and hence also 2-fold rotational symmetry: &quot;D&quot;2 (2) (also known as the Klein four-group)
**symmetry with respect to both diagonal directions, and hence also 2-fold rotational symmetry: &quot;D&quot;2 (7)
**4-fold rotational symmetry: &quot;C&quot;4 (8)
*1 fixed polyomino for each free polyomino:
**all symmetry of the square: &quot;D&quot;4 (1).

In the same way, the number of one-sided polyominoes depends on polyomino symmetry as follows:
*2 one-sided polyominoes for each free polyomino:
**no symmetry
**2-fold rotational symmetry: &quot;C&quot;2
**4-fold rotational symmetry: &quot;C&quot;4
*1 one-sided polyomino for each free polyomino:
**all symmetry of the square: &quot;D&quot;4
**mirror symmetry with respect to one of the grid line directions
**mirror symmetry with respect to a diagonal line
**symmetry with respect to both grid line directions, and hence also 2-fold rotational symmetry: &quot;D&quot;2
**symmetry with respect to both diagonal directions, and hence also 2-fold rotational symmetry: &quot;D&quot;2.

The following table shows the numbers of polyominoes with &quot;n&quot; squares, sorted by symmetry groups. 


===Algorithms for enumeration of fixed polyominoes===

====Inductive algorithms====
Each polyomino of size &quot;n&quot;+1 can be obtained by adding a square to a polyomino of size &quot;n&quot;. This leads to algorithms for generating polyominoes inductively.

Most simply, given a list of polyominoes of size &quot;n&quot;, squares may be added next to each polyomino in each possible position, and the resulting polyomino of size &quot;n&quot;+1 added to the list if not a duplicate of one already found; refinements in ordering the enumeration and marking adjacent squares that should not be considered reduce the number of cases that need to be checked for duplicates. This method may be used to enumerate either free or fixed polyominoes.

A more sophisticated method, described by Redelmeier, has been used by many authors as a way of not only counting polyominoes (without requiring that all polyominoes of size &quot;n&quot; be stored in size to enumerate those of size &quot;n&quot;+1), but also proving upper bounds on their number. The basic idea is that we begin with a single square, and from there, recursively add squares. Depending on the details, it may count each &quot;n&quot;-omino &quot;n&quot; times, once from starting from each of its &quot;n&quot; squares, or may be arranged to count each once only.

The simplest implementation involves adding one square at a time. Beginning with an initial square, number the adjacent squares, clockwise from the top, 1, 2, 3, and 4. Now pick a number between 1 and 4, and add a square at that location. Number the unnumbered adjacent squares, starting with 5. Then, pick a number larger than the previously picked number, and add that square. Continue picking a number larger than the number of the current square, adding that square, and then numbering the new adjacent squares. When &quot;n&quot; squares have been created, an &quot;n&quot;-omino has been created.

This method ensures that each fixed polyomino is counted exactly &quot;n&quot; times, once for each starting square. It can be optimized so that it counts each polyomino only once, rather than &quot;n&quot; times. Starting with the initial square, declare it to be the lower-left square of the polyomino. Simply do not number any square that is on a lower row, or left of the square on the same row. This is the version described by Redelmeier.

If one wishes to count free polyominoes instead, then one may check for symmetries after creating each &quot;n&quot;-omino. However, it is faster to generate symmetric polyominoes separately (by a variation of this method) and so determine the number of free polyominoes by Burnside&#x27;s lemma.

====Transfer-matrix method====
Currently, the most effective algorithms belong to the transfer-matrix paradigm. They may be called transfer matrix algorithms (TMAs) for short. Andrew Conway first implemented a TMA in the 90s, and calculated 25 terms of the fixed polyomino sequence ( in the OEIS). Iwan Jensen refined Conway&#x27;s methods and implemented a TMA in parallel for the first time in a pair of papers in the early 2000s. He calculated 56 terms. Because of this work, any TMA is sometimes also called Jensen&#x27;s Algorithm. In 2024, Gill Barequet and his student Gil Ben-Shachar made another improvement by running a TMA on 45° rotation of the square grid, which is an equivalent problem but computationally easier. This approach holds the polyomino-counting record, with 70 terms. 

As a rule, TMAs are much faster than the previous methods, but still run in time that is exponential in &quot;n&quot;. Roughly, this is achieved by fixing a width (in the diagonal case, a diagonal width), and counting polyominoes that fit in rectangles of that width. If this is done, it is only necessary to keep track of a polyomino&#x27;s boundary, and since multiple polyominoes can correspond to a single boundary, this approach is faster than one generating every polyomino. Repeating this for every width gives every polyomino. 

Although it has excellent running time, the tradeoff is that this algorithm uses exponential amounts of memory (many gigabytes of memory are needed for &quot;n&quot; above 50), is much harder to program than the other methods, and cannot currently be used to count free polyominoes.

===Asymptotic growth of the number of polyominoes===

====Fixed polyominoes====
Theoretical arguments and numerical calculations support the estimate for the number of fixed polyominoes of size n
:formula_1

where &quot;λ&quot; = 4.0626 and &quot;c&quot; = 0.3169. However, this result is not proven and the values of &quot;λ&quot; and &quot;c&quot; are only estimates.

The known theoretical results are not nearly as specific as this estimate. It has been proven that
:formula_2

exists. In other words, &quot;An&quot; grows exponentially. The best known lower bound for &quot;λ&quot;, found in 2016, is 4.00253. The best known upper bound is .

To establish a lower bound, a simple but highly effective method is concatenation of polyominoes. Define the upper-right square to be the rightmost square in the uppermost row of the polyomino. Define the bottom-left square similarly. Then, the upper-right square of any polyomino of size &quot;n&quot; can be attached to the bottom-left square of any polyomino of size &quot;m&quot; to produce a unique (&quot;n&quot;+&quot;m&quot;)-omino. This proves . Using this equation, one can show for all &quot;n&quot;. Refinements of this procedure combined with data for &quot;An&quot; produce the lower bound given above.

The upper bound is attained by generalizing the inductive method of enumerating polyominoes. Instead of adding one square at a time, one adds a cluster of squares at a time. This is often described as adding &quot;twigs&quot;. By proving that every &quot;n&quot;-omino is a sequence of twigs, and by proving limits on the combinations of possible twigs, one obtains an upper bound on the number of &quot;n&quot;-ominoes. For example, in the algorithm outlined above, at each step we must choose a larger number, and at most three new numbers are added (since at most three unnumbered squares are adjacent to any numbered square). This can be used to obtain an upper bound of 6.75. Using 2.8 million twigs, Klarner and Rivest obtained an upper bound of 4.65, which was subsequently improved by Barequet and Shalah to 4.5252.

====Free polyominoes====
Approximations for the number of fixed polyominoes and free polyominoes are related in a simple way. A free polyomino with no symmetries (rotation or reflection) corresponds to 8 distinct fixed polyominoes, and for large &quot;n&quot;, most &quot;n&quot;-ominoes have no symmetries. Therefore, the number of fixed &quot;n&quot;-ominoes is approximately 8 times the number of free &quot;n&quot;-ominoes. Moreover, this approximation is exponentially more accurate as &quot;n&quot; increases.

===Special classes of polyominoes===
Exact formulas are known for enumerating polyominoes of special classes, such as the class of &quot;convex&quot; polyominoes and the class of &quot;directed&quot; polyominoes.

The definition of a &quot;convex&quot; polyomino is different from the usual definition of convexity, but is similar to the definition used for the orthogonal convex hull. A polyomino is said to be &quot;vertically&quot; or &quot;column convex&quot; if its intersection with any vertical line is convex (in other words, each column has no holes). Similarly, a polyomino is said to be &quot;horizontally&quot; or &quot;row convex&quot; if its intersection with any horizontal line is convex. A polyomino is said to be &quot;convex&quot; if it is row and column convex.

A polyomino is said to be &quot;directed&quot; if it contains a square, known as the &quot;root&quot;, such that every other square can be reached by movements of up or right one square, without leaving the polyomino.

Directed polyominoes, column (or row) convex polyominoes, and convex polyominoes have been effectively enumerated by area &quot;n&quot;, as well as by some other parameters such as perimeter, using generating functions.

A polyomino is equable if its area equals its perimeter. An equable polyomino must be made from an even number of squares; every even number greater than 15 is possible. For instance, the 16-omino in the form of a 4 × 4 square and the 18-omino in the form of a 3 × 6 rectangle are both equable. For polyominoes with 15 squares or fewer, the perimeter always exceeds the area.

==Tiling with polyominoes==
In recreational mathematics, challenges are often posed for tiling a prescribed region, or the entire plane, with polyominoes, and related problems are investigated in mathematics and computer science.

===Tiling regions with sets of polyominoes===
Puzzles commonly ask for tiling a given region with a given set of polyominoes, such as the 12 pentominoes. Golomb&#x27;s and Gardner&#x27;s books have many examples. A typical puzzle is to tile a 6×10 rectangle with the twelve pentominoes; the 2339 solutions to this were found in 1960. Where multiple copies of the polyominoes in the set are allowed, Golomb defines a hierarchy of different regions that a set may be able to tile, such as rectangles, strips, and the whole plane, and shows that whether polyominoes from a given set can tile the plane is undecidable, by mapping sets of Wang tiles to sets of polyominoes. 

Because the general problem of tiling regions of the plane with sets of polyominoes is NP-complete, tiling with more than a few pieces rapidly becomes intractable and so the aid of a computer is required. The traditional approach to tiling finite regions of the plane uses a technique in computer science called backtracking. 

In Jigsaw Sudokus a square grid is tiled with polyomino-shaped regions .

===Tiling regions with copies of a single polyomino===
Another class of problems asks whether copies of a given polyomino can tile a rectangle, and if so, what rectangles they can tile. These problems have been extensively studied for particular polyominoes, and tables of results for individual polyominoes are available. Klarner and Göbel showed that for any polyomino there is a finite set of &quot;prime&quot; rectangles it tiles, such that all other rectangles it tiles can be tiled by those prime rectangles. Kamenetsky and Cooke showed how various disjoint (called &quot;holey&quot;) polyominoes can tile rectangles.

Beyond rectangles, Golomb gave his hierarchy for single polyominoes: a polyomino may tile a rectangle, a half strip, a bent strip, an enlarged copy of itself, a quadrant, a strip, a half plane, the whole plane, certain combinations, or none of these. There are certain implications among these, both obvious (for example, if a polyomino tiles the half plane then it tiles the whole plane) and less so (for example, if a polyomino tiles an enlarged copy of itself, then it tiles the quadrant). Polyominoes of size up to 6 are characterized in this hierarchy (with the status of one hexomino, later found to tile a rectangle, unresolved at that time).

In 2001 Cristopher Moore and John Michael Robson showed that the problem of tiling one polyomino with copies of another is NP-complete.

===Tiling the plane with copies of a single polyomino===

Tiling the plane with copies of a single polyomino has also been much discussed. It was noted in 1965 that all polyominoes up to hexominoes and all but four heptominoes tile the plane. It was then established by David Bird that all but 26 octominoes tile the plane. Rawsthorne found that all but 235 polyominoes of size 9 tile, and such results have been extended to higher area by Rhoads (to size 14) and others. Polyominoes tiling the plane have been classified by the symmetries of their tilings and by the number of aspects (orientations) in which the tiles appear in them.

The study of which polyominoes can tile the plane has been facilitated using the Conway criterion: except for two nonominoes, all tiling polyominoes up to size 9 form a patch of at least one tile satisfying it, with higher-size exceptions more frequent.

Several polyominoes can tile larger copies of themselves, and repeating this process recursively gives a rep-tile tiling of the plane. For instance, for every positive integer , it is possible to combine copies of the L-tromino, L-tetromino, or P-pentomino into a single larger shape similar to the smaller polyomino from which it was formed.
===Tiling a common figure with various polyominoes===

The &quot;compatibility problem&quot; is to take two or more polyominoes and find a figure that can be tiled with each. Polyomino compatibility has been widely studied since the 1990s. Jorge Luis Mireles and Giovanni Resta have published websites of systematic results, and Livio Zucca shows results for some complicated cases like three different pentominoes. The general problem can be hard. The first compatibility figure for the L and X pentominoes was published in 2005 and had 80 tiles of each kind. Many pairs of polyominoes have been proved incompatible by systematic exhaustion. No algorithm is known for deciding whether two arbitrary polyominoes are compatible.

==Polyominoes in puzzles and games==
In addition to the tiling problems described above, there are recreational mathematics puzzles that require folding a polyomino to create other shapes. Gardner proposed several simple games with a set of free pentominoes and a chessboard. Some variants of the Sudoku puzzle use nonomino-shaped regions on the grid. The video game &quot;Tetris&quot; is based on the seven one-sided tetrominoes (spelled &quot;Tetriminos&quot; in the game), and the board game &quot;Blokus&quot; uses all of the free polyominoes up to pentominoes.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;polyomino&quot; and the names of the various sizes of polyomino are all back-formations from the word &quot;domino&quot;, a common game piece consisting of two squares. The name &quot;domino&quot; for the game piece is believed to come from the spotted masquerade garment &quot;domino&quot;, from Latin &quot;dominus&quot;. Despite this word origin, in naming polyominoes, the first letter &quot;d-&quot; of &quot;domino&quot; is fancifully interpreted as a version of the prefix &quot;di-&quot; meaning &quot;two&quot;, and replaced by other numerical prefixes.

<text>Florence Delorez Griffith Joyner (born Florence Delorez Griffith; December 21, 1959 – September 21, 1998), also known as Flo-Jo, was an American track and field athlete and the fastest woman ever recorded. She was married to Al Joyner, a 1984 Olympic gold medalist in the triple jump. He was also her coach and husband during her success as a four-time Olympic medalist. They were married in 1987 until the time of her death, in 1998. They had one daughter together, Mary Joyner. Griffith Joyner set world records in 1988 for the 100 m and 200 m. During the late 1980s, she became a popular figure due to both her record-setting athleticism and eclectic personal style.

Griffith Joyner was born and raised in California. She was athletic from a young age and began running at track meets as a child. While attending California State University, Northridge (CSUN), and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), she continued to compete in track and field. While still in college, she qualified for the 100 m 1980 Olympics but did not compete due to the U.S. boycott. She made her Olympic debut four years later, winning a silver medal in the 200 meter distance at the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles. At the 1988 U.S. Olympic trials, Griffith set a new world record in the 100-meter sprint. She won three gold medals at the 1988 Olympics.

In February 1989, Griffith Joyner abruptly retired from athletics. She remained a pop culture figure through endorsement deals, acting, and designing. In 1998, at age 38, she died in her sleep during an epileptic seizure caused by a birth defect. Griffith Joyner is buried at the El Toro Memorial Park in Lake Forest.

==Early life==
Griffith was born in Los Angeles, California, the seventh of eleven children born to Robert, an electrician, and Florence Griffith, a seamstress. The family lived in Littlerock, California, before Florence Griffith moved with her children to the Jordan Downs public housing complex located in the Watts section of Los Angeles.

When Griffith was in elementary school, she joined the Sugar Ray Robinson Organization, running in track meets on weekends. She won the Jesse Owens National Youth Games two years in a row, at the ages of 14 and 15. Griffith ran track at Jordan High School in Los Angeles.

Showing an early interest in fashion, Griffith persuaded the members of the track team to wear tights with their uniforms. As a high school senior in 1978, she finished sixth at the CIF California State Meet behind future teammates Alice Brown and Pam Marshall. By the time she graduated from Jordan High School in 1978, she had set high-school records in sprinting and long jump.

==Career==
Griffith attended CSUN, and was on the track team coached by Bob Kersee. This team, which included Brown and Jeanette Bolden, won the national championship during Griffith&#x27;s first year of college. Griffith had to drop out to support her family, taking a job as a bank teller. Kersee found financial aid for her and returned to college in 1980, this time at UCLA where Kersee was working as a coach.

Brown, Bolden, and Griffith qualified for the 100-meter final at the trials for the 1980 Summer Olympics (with Brown winning and Griffith finishing last in the final). Griffith also ran the 200 meters, narrowly finishing fourth, a foot out of a qualifying position. However, the U.S. Government had already decided to boycott those Olympic Games mooting those results. In 1983, Griffith graduated from UCLA with her bachelor&#x27;s degree in psychology.

===Olympic runner===

Griffith finished fourth in the 200-meter sprint at the first World Championship in Athletics in 1983. In the next year, she qualified for the Olympics in the 200-meter distance with the second fastest time at the United States Olympic Trials, held in Los Angeles. Evelyn Ashford, another UCLA alumna and early favorite to medal, dropped out of the 200-meter due to injury. Griffith went on to win a silver medal in the 1984 Summer Olympics, coming in second behind teammate Valerie Brisco-Hooks.

After the 1984 Olympic Games, she spent less time running. Griffith continued to run part-time, winning the 100-meter IAAF Grand Prix Final with the time of 11.00 seconds. She did not compete at the 1985 U.S. National Championship. That same year, she returned to working at a bank and styled hair and nails in her spare time. She married Al Joyner, the Olympic triple jump champion of 1984, in 1987.

She returned to athletics in April 1987. Four months later, at the 1987 World Championships in Rome, Griffith Joyner finished second in the 200-meter sprint. Her success during the 1987 season resulted in being ranked second in Track and Field News&#x27; 1987 world rankings. The 200 meters remained a stronger event for her than the 100 meters, where she was ranked seventh in the United States.

Before the 1988 U.S. Olympic Trials, Griffith Joyner continued to work with her coach and husband&#x27;s brother-in-law, Kersee, two days a week, but with her new husband coaching her three days a week. She ran the 100 meter in 10.96-seconds at the 1987 Cologne Grand Prix Track and Field Meet, a personal best but the mark was not even in the top 40 of all time. She continued to improve, again setting a personal best of 10.89 in the 100 meters in San Diego on June 25, 1988, but remained shy of the American record holder Evelyn Ashford&#x27;s three best times. A week before the trials she ran a tune-up race in 10.99 in Santa Monica.

In the first race of the quarterfinals of the U.S. Olympic Trials, she stunned her colleagues when she sprinted 100 meters in 10.49 seconds, a new world record by a margin of 0.27s over the previous record held by Evelyn Ashford. Over the two-day trials, Griffith Joyner recorded the three fastest times for a woman at 100 meters: 10.49 in the quarter-final, 10.70 in the semifinal, and 10.61 in the final. At the same Olympic trials, she also set an American record at the 200-meter distance with a time of 21.77 seconds.

The 100-meter record was by far the largest improvement in the world record time since the advent of electronic timing, and still stands. This extraordinary result raised the possibility of a technical malfunction with the wind gauge which read at 0.0 m/s - a reading at odds with the windy conditions on the day, with high wind speeds being recorded in all other sprints before and after this race as well as the parallel long jump runway at the time of the Griffith Joyner performance. All scientific studies commissioned by the IAAF and independent organizations have since found there was an illegal tailwind of between 5 m/s – 7 m/s at the time. The IAAF has not annulled the result, but since 1997 the International Athletics Annual of the Association of Track and Field Statisticians has listed it as &quot;probably strongly wind assisted, but recognized as a world record.&quot; The fastest non-wind-assisted performance would then be Griffith Joyner&#x27;s 10.61s in the final the next day. This mark was equaled by Elaine Thompson-Herah in the 2020 Olympic Final before being surpassed by Thompson-Herah at the post-Olympics Eugene Diamond League meeting in August 2021. Thompson-Herah clocked 10.54 seconds, officially the second fastest time in women&#x27;s 100 m history.

Following the Olympic trials, in late July 1988, Griffith Joyner left coach Kersee saying she wanted a coach able to provide more personal attention. Another contributing factor was her unhappiness with the lack of sponsorship and endorsement opportunities. In addition to being her coach, Kersee was Griffith Joyner&#x27;s manager, as he required all the athletes he coached to use his management services too. Griffith Joyner&#x27;s decision to sign with personal manager Gordon Baskin therefore necessitated the coaching change. She left UCLA for UC Irvine with her husband serving as full-time coach.

By then known to the world as &quot;Flo-Jo&quot;, Griffith Joyner was the big favorite for the titles in the sprint events at the 1988 Summer Olympics. In the 100-meter final, she ran a 10.54, beating her nearest rival to the world record, Evelyn Ashford, by 0.30 seconds. In the 200 meter semifinal, she set the world record of 21.56 seconds and then broke this record by 0.22 seconds in winning the final with a time of 21.34 seconds. Like her 100-meter world record, this mark still stands.

At the same Olympics, Griffith Joyner also ran with the 4 × 100 m relay and the 4 × 400 m relay teams. Her team won the 4 × 100 m relay and finished second in the 4 × 400 m relay. This was her first internationally rated 4 × 400 m relay. She left the games having won four Olympic medals, three gold and one silver. At the time, her medal haul was the second most for female track and field athlete in history, behind only Fanny Blankers-Koen who won four gold medals in 1948.

In February 1989, Griffith Joyner announced her retirement from racing. She cited her new business opportunities outside of sprinting. The month after announcing her retirement, she was selected as the winner of the James E. Sullivan Award of 1988 as the top amateur athlete in the United States.

===Comeback attempt and other activities===
Griffith Joyner&#x27;s success at the 1988 Olympics led to new opportunities. In the weeks following the Olympics, she earned millions of dollars from endorsement deals, primarily in Japan. She also signed a deal with toy maker LJN Toys for a Barbie-like doll in her likeness.

In 1989, Griffith Joyner designed the basketball uniforms for the Indiana Pacers NBA team. She made a guest appearance as herself on a season 4 episode of &quot;227&quot;. In 1992, she appeared in the soap opera &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; as &quot;Terry Holloway&quot;, a photographer similar to Annie Leibovitz. She served as co-chair of President&#x27;s Council on Physical Fitness between 1993 and 1998.

In 1996, Griffith Joyner appeared on &quot;Charlie Rose&quot; and announced her comeback to competitive athletics, concentrating on the 400-meter run. Her reason was that she had already set world marks in both the 100 m and 200 m events, with the 400 m world record being her goal. She trained steadily leading up to the U.S. Olympic trials in June. However, tendinitis in her right leg ended her hopes of becoming a triple-world-record holder.

==Style==
Beyond her running prowess, Griffith Joyner was known for her bold fashion choices. She appeared at the World Championships in 1987 in Rome wearing a hooded speed skating body suit. In April 1988, she started wearing a running suit with the right leg of the suit extending to the ankle and the left leg of the suit cut off, a style she called the &quot;one-legger&quot;. The running suits had bold colors such as lime green and purple with white bikini bottoms and were embellished with lightning bolts.

Her nails also garnered attention for their length and designs. Her nails were four inches long with tiger stripes at the 1988 Olympic trials before switching to fuchsia. For the Olympic games themselves, she had six inch nails painted red, white, blue, and gold. Although many sprinters avoided accessories which might slow them down, Griffith Joyner kept her hair long and wore jewelry while competing. She designed many of her outfits herself and preferred looks which were not conventional.

==Allegations of performance-enhancing drug use==
After her record-shattering performances at the 1988 U.S. Olympic Trials, she became an object of suspicion when she arrived at the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul. Athletes, including Joaquim Cruz and Ben Johnson, expressed disbelief over Griffith Joyner&#x27;s dramatic improvement over a short period of time. Before the 1988 track and field season, her best time in the 100-meter sprint was 10.96 seconds (set in 1987). In 1988, she improved that by 0.47 seconds.

Her best before 1988 at 200 meters was 21.96 seconds (also set in 1987). In 1988, she improved that by 0.62 seconds to 21.34 seconds, another time that has not been approached. Griffith Joyner attributed the change in her physique to new health programs. Al Joyner replaced Bob Kersee as her coach, and he changed her training program to include more lower body strength training exercises such as squats and lunges.

In a 1989 story for which he was purportedly paid $25,000, Darrell Robinson, a former teammate of Griffith Joyner, claimed that he sold her 10 mL of growth hormone for $2,000 in 1988. He said Joyner told him: &quot;if you want to make $1 million, you&#x27;ve got to invest some thousands.&quot; Robinson claimed to have received steroids from coach Bob Kersee and said he saw Carl Lewis inject himself with drugs he believed to be testosterone. In 1990, Lewis alleged in his autobiography that Griffith Joyner had used drugs.

Neither Robinson nor Lewis provided evidence for their allegations, and Robinson was shunned by the athletics community, leading to the premature end of his career. After the 1988 Olympics, Griffith Joyner retired from competitive track and field, a year before the introduction of mandatory random drug testing in 1989. She was repeatedly tested during competition and passed every test.

After her death in 1998, Prince Alexandre de Merode, who held the controversial position as chairman of the International Olympic Committee&#x27;s medical commission, claimed that Griffith Joyner was singled out for extra, rigorous drug testing during the 1988 Olympic Games following rumors of steroid use. De Merode told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that Manfred Donike, who was at that time considered to be the foremost expert on drugs and sports, failed to discover any banned substances during that testing. The World Anti-Doping Agency was created in the 1990s, removing control of drug testing from the IOC and De Merode. De Merode later stated: &quot;We performed all possible and imaginable analyses on her. We never found anything. There should not be the slightest suspicion.&quot;

==Personal life and death==
Griffith&#x27;s nickname among her family was &quot;Dee Dee&quot;. She was briefly engaged to hurdler Greg Foster. In 1987, Griffith married 1984 Olympic triple-jump champion Al Joyner, whom Griffith had first met at the 1980 Olympic Trials. Through her marriage to Joyner she was sister-in-law to track and field athlete Jackie Joyner-Kersee. Griffith and Joyner had one daughter together, Mary Ruth Joyner, born November 15, 1990.

===Death===
On September 21, 1998, Griffith Joyner died in her sleep at home in the Canyon Crest neighborhood of Mission Viejo, California, at the age of 38. The unexpected death was investigated by the Orange County Sheriff-Coroner&#x27;s office, which on September 22 declared the cause of death to be suffocation during a severe epileptic seizure.

Griffith Joyner was found to have had a cavernous hemangioma, a congenital vascular brain abnormality that made her subject to seizures. According to a family attorney, she had a tonic-clonic seizure in 1990 and had been treated for seizures in 1993 and 1994. According to the Sheriff-Coroner&#x27;s office, the only drugs in her system when she died were small amounts of two common over-the-counter drugs, acetaminophen and the antihistamine Benadryl.

==Legacy==

USA Track &amp; Field inducted her into its Hall of Fame in 1995. In 2000, the 102nd Street School in Los Angeles was renamed Florence Griffith Joyner Elementary School. Griffith Joyner had attended the school as a child. The city of Mission Viejo dedicated a park at the entrance to her neighborhood in her honor. Griffith Joyner was also an artist and painter. Her work has been on display as part the Art of The Olympians (AOTO). She is one of two posthumous members of AOTO, the other being the founder and Olympian, Al Oerter. In &quot;Time&quot; 2020 list of the most influential women of the past century, she was named Woman of the Year for 1988.

<text>Yolanda Gail Devers ( ; born November 19, 1966) is an American retired track and field sprinter who competed in the 60 metres, 60 m hurdles, 100 m and 100 m hurdles. One of the greatest and most decorated female sprinters of all time, she was the 1993, 1997 and 2004 world indoor champion in the 60 m, while in the 60 m hurdles, she was the 2003 world indoor champion and 2004 silver medalist. In the 100 m, she is the second woman in history to defend an Olympic 100 m title, winning gold at both the 1992 and 1996 Olympics. She was also the 1993 world champion in the event, becoming the first ever female sprinter to simultaneously hold the world and Olympic titles in the 100m. In the 100 m hurdles, she was the 1993, 1995 and 1999 world champion, and the 1991 and 2001 world silver medalist. In 2011, she was inducted into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame.

==Life and career==
Devers was born in Seattle, Washington, and grew up near National City, California, graduating from Sweetwater High School in 1984. Sweetwater&#x27;s football and track stadium would later be named Gail Devers Stadium. A young talent in the 100 m and 100 m hurdles, Devers was in training for the 1988 Summer Olympics, started experiencing health problems, suffering from among others migraine and vision loss. She qualified for the Olympics 100 m hurdles, in which she was eliminated in the semi-finals, but her health continued to deteriorate.

Devers started in 800m in high school and ran a personal best of 2:08.

In 1990, she was diagnosed with Graves&#x27; disease and underwent radioactive iodine treatment followed by thyroid hormone replacement therapy. During her radiation treatment, Devers began to develop blistering and swelling of her feet. Eventually, she could barely walk. Devers recovered after the radiation treatment was discontinued, and she resumed training. At the 1991 World Championships, she won a silver medal in the 100 m hurdles.

At the 1992 Summer Olympics, Devers starred. She qualified for the final of the 100 m, which ended in an exciting finish, with five women finishing close (within 0.06 seconds). The photo finish showed Devers had narrowly beaten Jamaican Juliet Cuthbert. In the final of the 100 m hurdles, Devers&#x27; lead event, she seemed to be running towards a second gold medal, when she hit the final hurdle and stumbled over the finish line in fifth place, leaving Voula Patoulidou from Greece as the upset winner.

In 1993, Devers won the 1993 World Championships in Athletics 100 m title after – again – a photo finish win over Merlene Ottey in an apparent dead heat, and the 100 m hurdles title. She retained her hurdles title in 1995.

The 100 m final at the 1996 Summer Olympics was an almost exact repeat of the World Championships final three years before. Ottey and Devers again finished in the same time and did not know who had won the race. Again, both were awarded the same time of 10.94 seconds, but Devers was judged to have finished first and became the first woman to retain the Olympic 100 m title since Wyomia Tyus. Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce duplicated the feat in 2012, and Elaine Thompson-Herah in 2021. In the final of her favorite event, Devers again failed, as she finished fourth and outside of the medals. With the 4 × 100 m relay team, Devers won her third Olympic gold medal.

After these Olympics, Devers concentrated on the hurdles event, winning the World Championship again in 1999, but she had to forfeit for the semi-finals at the 2000 Summer Olympics.

Devers competed in the 100 m and 100 m hurdles at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, her fifth Olympic Games.

Devers left competition in 2005 to give birth to a child with her husband and returned in 2006.

On February 2, 2007, at the age of 40, Devers edged 2004 Olympic champion Joanna Hayes to win the 60 m hurdles event at the Millrose Games in 7.86 seconds – the best time in the world that season and just 0.12 off the record she set in 2003. Furthermore, the time bettered the listed World Record for a 40-year-old by almost 7 tenths of a second.

During her career, Devers was notable for having exceptionally long, heavily decorated fingernails. One of the fastest starters in the world, Devers even had to alter her starting position to accommodate her long nails. Her long nails came as the result of a contest her father devised to get her to stop biting her nails as a child.

==International competitions==
==Achievements and recognition==
In 2011, she was elected into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame. The following year she was elected into the United States Olympic Hall of Fame. In November 2012, Devers was announced as a 2013 recipient of the NCAA Silver Anniversary Award, presented annually to six distinguished former college student-athletes on the 25th anniversary of the end of their college sports careers.

<doc id="72655" wikidata="Q209396" url="?curid=72655" title="Marion Jones">
<text>Marion Lois Jones (born October 12, 1975), also known as Marion Jones-Thompson, is an American former world champion track-and-field athlete and former professional basketball player. She won three gold medals and two bronze medals at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, but was later stripped of her medals after admitting to lying to federal investigators about her use of performance-enhancing drugs.

Jones was one of the most famous athletes to be linked to the BALCO scandal. The performance-enhancing substance usage scandal covered more than 20 top-level athletes, including Jones&#x27;s ex-husband, shot putter C. J. Hunter, and 100 m sprinter Tim Montgomery.

Jones played college basketball for the North Carolina Tar Heels, where she won the NCAA championship in 1994. She later played two season of professional basketball in the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association, as point guard for the Tulsa Shock.

==Early life and education==
Marion Jones was born to George Jones and his wife, Marion (originally from Belize), in Los Angeles. She holds dual citizenship with the United States and Belize. Her parents split when she was very young, and Jones&#x27;s mother remarried a retired postal worker, Ira Toler, three years later. Toler became a stay-at-home dad to Jones and her older half-brother, Albert Kelly, until his sudden death in 1987. Jones turned to sports as an outlet for her grief: running, pickup basketball games, and whatever else her brother Albert was doing athletically. By the age of 15, she was routinely dominating California high-school athletics on both the track and the basketball court.

Jones is also a 1997 graduate of the University of North Carolina (UNC).

==Personal life==
While at UNC, Jones met and began dating one of the track coaches, shot putter C. J. Hunter. Hunter voluntarily resigned from his position at UNC to comply with the requirements of university rules prohibiting coach-athlete dating. Jones and Hunter were married on October 3, 1998, and trained for the Sydney 2000 Summer Olympics.

In the run-up to the 2000 Olympics, Jones declared that she intended to win gold medals in all five of her competition events at Sydney. Jones&#x27;s husband, C. J. Hunter, had withdrawn from the shotput competition for a knee injury, though he was allowed to keep his coaching credentials and attend the games to support his wife. Just hours after Marion Jones won her first of the planned five golds, though, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced that Hunter had failed four pre-Olympic drug tests, testing positive each time for the banned anabolic steroid nandrolone. Hunter was immediately suspended from taking any role at the Sydney games, and he was ordered to surrender his on-field coaching credentials. At a press conference where Hunter broke down in tears, he denied taking any performance-enhancing drugs, much less the easily detected nandrolone. Jones would later write in her autobiography, &quot;Marion Jones: Life in the Fast Lane&quot;, that Hunter&#x27;s positive drug tests hurt their marriage and her image as a drug-free athlete. The couple divorced in 2002.

On June 28, 2003, Jones gave birth to a son, Tim Montgomery Jr., with then-boyfriend Tim Montgomery, a world-class sprinter himself. Because of her pregnancy, Jones missed the 2003 World Championships, but spent a year preparing for the 2004 Olympics. Montgomery, who did not qualify for the 2004 Olympic track-and-field team for poor performance, was charged by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), as part of the investigation into the BALCO doping scandal, with receiving and using banned performance-enhancing drugs. The USADA sought a four-year suspension for Montgomery. Montgomery fought the ban, but lost the appeal on December 13, 2005, receiving a two-year ban from track-and-field competition; the Court of Arbitration for Sport also stripped Montgomery of all race results, records, and medals, from March 31, 2001, onward. Montgomery later announced his retirement.

On February 24, 2007, Jones married Barbadian sprinter and 2000 Olympic 100 m bronze medalist Obadele Thompson. Jones has two children with Thompson. Thompson and Jones divorced in 2017. Jones now resides in Austin, Texas with her long-time partner.

In 2010, Jones released a book, &quot;On the Right Track: From Olympic Downfall to Finding Forgiveness and the Strength to Overcome and Succeed&quot;, published by Simon &amp; Schuster. Jones is now a full-time public speaker, trainer and coach. In 2024 Jones partnered with Driven Inc to launch Driven performance which focuses on building resilience skills through coaching and physical fitness.

==Sports career==

===Track and field===
In high school, Jones won the CIF California State Meet in the 100 m sprint four years in a row, representing Rio Mesa the first two years and Thousand Oaks high school the last two. In 1992, she was successfully defended by attorney Johnnie Cochran on charges of missing a routine drug test. She was selected the Gatorade Player of the Year for track and field three years in a row, once at Rio Mesa and twice at Thousand Oaks. She was the &quot;Track and Field News&quot; &quot;High School Athlete of the Year&quot; in 1991 and 1992. She was the third female athlete to achieve the title twice, immediately following Angela Burnham at Rio Mesa High School, who was the second to achieve the title twice.

She was invited to participate in the 1992 Olympic trials, and after her showing in the 200 meters finals, would have made the team as an alternate in the 4 × 100 meter relay, but she declined the invitation. After winning further state-wide sprint titles, she accepted a full scholarship to the University of North Carolina in basketball, where she helped the team win the NCAA championship in her freshman year. Jones redshirted her 1996 basketball season to concentrate on track but was injured and never got the opportunity to try out.
She excelled at her first major international competition, winning the 100 m sprint at the 1997 World Championships in Athens, while finishing 10th in the long jump. At the 1999 World Championships, Jones attempted to win four titles, but injured herself in the 200 m after a gold in the 100 m and a long jump bronze.

At the Sydney Olympics, Jones finished with three gold medals (100- and 200-meter sprint, and relay) and two bronze medals (long jump and relay). However, she was later stripped of these medals after admitting her use of performance-enhancing drugs. Jones vehemently denied using performance-enhancing drugs until her confession in 2007.

A dominant force in women&#x27;s sprinting, Jones was upset in the 100 m sprint at the 2001 World Championships, as Ukrainian Zhanna Pintusevich-Block beat her for her first loss in the event in six years; Pintusevich-Block was one of the names revealed by Victor Conte during the BALCO scandals. Jones, however, did claim the gold in both the 200 m and 4x100 m relay.

On her 2004 Olympics experience, Jones said &quot;It&#x27;s extremely disappointing, words can&#x27;t put it into perspective.&quot; She came in fifth in the long jump and competed in the women&#x27;s 4x100 m relay where the team swept past the competition in the preliminaries only to miss a baton pass and finish last in the final race. Jones promised that her latest defeat would not be the end of her Olympic efforts, and reasserted in May 2005 that winning a gold medal at the 2008 Olympics remained her &quot;ultimate goal.&quot;

May 2006 had Jones run 11.06 at altitude, but into a headwind in her season debut and beat Veronica Campbell and Lauryn Williams in subsequent 100 m events. By July 8, 2006, Jones appeared to be in top form; she won the 100 m sprint at Gaz de France with a time of 10.93 seconds. It was her fastest time in almost four years. Three days later, Jones once more improved on her seasonal best time at the Rome IIAF Golden League (10.91 seconds), but lost to Jamaica&#x27;s Sherone Simpson, who clocked 10.87.

===WNBA===

In November 2009, Jones was working out for the San Antonio Silver Stars of the WNBA. She had played basketball while in college at the University of North Carolina, where her team won the national championship in 1994. Her No. 20 jersey, honored by the school, hangs in Carmichael Auditorium. She had been selected in the third round of the 2003 WNBA draft by the Phoenix Mercury. On March 10, 2010, the Tulsa Shock announced that Jones, a rookie, had signed to play with the team. Jones made her debut on May 15, in the Shock&#x27;s inaugural game at the BOK Center against the Minnesota Lynx. On August 22, 2010, she logged her first start and scored a WNBA career high 15 points in a win against the Chicago Sky. In 47 WNBA games, Jones averaged 2.6 points and 1.3 rebounds per game. Jones was waived by the Shock on July 21, 2011.

== &quot;Top Speed&quot; film ==
Jones appears in the 2003 film &quot;Top Speed&quot;, along with other speed specialists such as racing driver Lucas Luhr, mountain biker Marla Streb, and Porsche Cayenne designer Stephen Murkett. Directed by Greg MacGillivray and shot in IMAX format, the film covers details from races to mistakes she made within her performances.

==Use of illicit performance-enhancing drugs==
Throughout most of her athletic career including two Olympiads and several championship meets, Jones had been accused, either directly or by implication, of taking performance-enhancing drugs. These accusations began in high school in the early 1990s, when she missed a random drug test and was consequently banned for four years from track and field competition. Jones, a minor, claimed that she never received the letter notifying her of the required test; and attorney Johnnie Cochran successfully got the four-year ban overturned. Jones tended to train with both coaches and athletes who themselves were dogged by rumors and accusations surrounding performance-enhancing drugs. And until 2007, Jones denied, in almost every way possible and in almost any venue where the question arose, being involved with performance enhancers. She frequently said that she had never tested positive for performance-enhancing substances.

===BALCO investigation===
On December 3, 2004, Victor Conte, the founder of BALCO, appeared in an interview with Martin Bashir on ABC&#x27;s &quot;20/20&quot;. In the interview, Conte told a national audience that he had personally given Jones four different illegal performance-enhancing drugs before, during, and after the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games. In the course of investigative research, San Francisco-based reporters Lance Williams and Mark Fainaru-Wada reported Jones had received banned drugs from BALCO, citing documentary evidence and testimony from Jones&#x27;s ex-husband C.J. Hunter, who claims to have seen Jones inject herself in the stomach with the steroids.

According to Hunter&#x27;s 2004 testimony before a federal grand jury, Jones&#x27;s use of banned drugs began well before Sydney. Hunter told the investigators that Jones first obtained EPO (erythropoietin) from Graham, who Hunter said had a Mexican connection for the drug. Later, Hunter said, Graham met Conte, who began providing the coach with BALCO &quot;nutritional supplements&quot;, which were actually an experimental class of &quot;designer&quot; steroids said to be undetectable by drug screening procedures available at the time. Graham then distributed the performance enhancers to Jones and other Sprint Capitol athletes. Subsequently, Hunter told federal agents Jones began receiving drugs directly from Conte.

Jones had never failed a drug test using the then-existing testing procedures, and insufficient evidence was found to bring charges regarding other untested performance-enhancing drugs.

===2006 EPO tests===
&quot;The Washington Post&quot;, citing unidentified sources with knowledge of drug results from the USA Track and Field Championships in Indianapolis, reported that on June 23, 2006, an &quot;A&quot; sample of Marion Jones&#x27;s urine tested positive for erythropoietin (EPO), a banned performance enhancer. Jones withdrew from the Weltklasse Golden League meet in Switzerland, citing &quot;personal reasons&quot;, and once more denied using performance-enhancing drugs. She retained lawyer Howard Jacobs, who had represented many athletes in doping cases, including Tim Montgomery and cyclist Floyd Landis. On September 6, 2006, Jones&#x27;s lawyers announced that her &quot;B&quot; sample had tested negative, which cleared her from the doping allegations.

===Admission of lying during BALCO investigation===
On October 5, 2007, Jones admitted to lying to federal agents under oath about her steroids use prior to the 2000 Summer Olympics and pleaded guilty at the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (in White Plains). She confessed to Judge Kenneth M. Karas that she had made false statements regarding the BALCO and a check-fraud case. She was released on her own recognizance but was required to surrender both her U.S. and Belizean passports, pending sentencing in January. Although a maximum sentence of five years could be imposed, the prosecution recommended no more than six months as part of Jones&#x27;s plea bargain.

After her admission, Jones held a press conference on the same day, where she publicly admitted to using steroids before the Olympics and acknowledged that she had, in fact, lied when she previously denied steroid use in statements to the press, to various sports agencies, and to two grand juries. One was impaneled to investigate the BALCO &quot;designer steroid&quot; ring, and the other was impaneled to investigate a check fraud ring involving many of the same parties from the BALCO case. As a result of these admissions, Jones accepted a two-year suspension from track and field competition issued by USADA and announced her retirement from track and field. She broke down into tears during the press conference as she apologized for her actions, saying: &quot;And so it is with a great amount of shame, that I stand before you and tell you that I have betrayed your trust... and you have the right to be angry with me. I have let them down. I have let my country down. And I have let myself down.&quot;

USADA stated that their sanction &quot;also requires disqualification of all her competitive results obtained after September 1, 2000, and forfeiture of all medals, results, points and prizes&quot;. On January 11, 2008, Jones was sentenced to six months in jail. She began her sentence on March 7, 2008, and was released on September 5, 2008.

In the BALCO case, she had denied to federal agents her use of the steroid tetrahydrogestrinone, known as &quot;The Clear&quot;, or &quot;THG&quot;, from 1999, but claimed she was given the impression she was taking a flaxseed oil supplement for two years while coach Trevor Graham supplied her with the substance. In a published letter in October 2007, Jones said that she had used the substance that was given to her described as flaxseed oil, which was later confirmed to be &quot;The Clear&quot; until she stopped training with Graham at the end of 2002. She said she lied when federal agents questioned her in 2003 because she panicked when they presented her with a sample of &quot;The Clear&quot;.

===U.S. Olympic Committee demands return of Olympic medals===
Peter Ueberroth, chairman of the U.S. Olympic Committee, reacted to the news of Jones&#x27;s confession and guilty plea on perjury charges by issuing a statement calling on Jones to &quot;immediately step forward and return the Olympic medals she won while competing in violation of the rules&quot;. Ueberroth added that her admission was &quot;long overdue and underscores the shame and dishonor that are inherent with cheating.&quot; IAAF president Lamine Diack said in a statement: &quot;Marion Jones will be remembered as one of the biggest frauds in sporting history.&quot;

On October 8, 2007, a source confirmed that Marion Jones surrendered her five medals from the 2000 Summer Olympics. On the same day, Ueberroth said that all the relay medals should be returned, and on April 10, 2008, the IOC voted to strip Jones&#x27;s relay teammates of their medals as well, although this decision would successfully be appealed by seven of Jones&#x27;s teammates and overturned in 2010.

===Formal IOC disqualification===
On December 12, 2007, the IOC formally stripped Jones of all five Olympic medals dating back to September 2000, and banned her from attending the 2008 Summer Olympics in any capacity. The IOC action also officially disqualified Jones from her fifth-place finish in the long jump at the 2004 Summer Olympics.

On October 28, 2008, Jones was interviewed by Oprah Winfrey and stated that she would have won gold at the Sydney Olympics without the drugs that led to her disgrace.

===Financial troubles===
Seven years after winning a women&#x27;s record five Olympic track and field medals and receiving multimillion-dollar endorsement deals, Jones was broke. According to the Associated Press, Jones was heavily in debt and fighting off court judgments, according to court records reviewed by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. In 2006, a bank foreclosed on her $2.5 million mansion in Apex, North Carolina. In her prime, Jones was one of track&#x27;s first female sports millionaires, typically earning between $70,000 and $80,000 a race, plus at least another $1 million from race bonuses and endorsement deals.

===Involvement in check fraud===
In July 2006, Jones was linked to a check-counterfeiting scheme that led to criminal charges against her coach and former boyfriend Montgomery. Documents showed that a $25,000 check made out to Jones was deposited in her bank account as part of the alleged multimillion-dollar scheme. Prosecutors alleged that funds were sent to Jones&#x27;s track coach, 1976 Olympic gold medalist Steve Riddick, in Virginia, then funneled back to New York through a network of &quot;friends, relatives and associates.&quot; Riddick was arrested in February on money-laundering charges. According to the indictment and subsequent documents filed with the court, the link to Jones was made through one of Riddick&#x27;s business partners, Nathaniel Alexander.

On October 5, 2007, Jones pleaded guilty to making false statements to IRS Special Agent Jeff Novitzky leading the ongoing BALCO investigation in California. Jones claimed she had never taken performance-enhancing drugs. &quot;That was a lie, your honor&quot;, she said from the defense table. The federal government, through grand juries, had been investigating steroid abuse since 2003.

Jones also pleaded guilty to making false statements about her knowledge of a check-cashing scheme to New York U.S. Department of Homeland Security Special Agent Erik Rosenblatt, who has been leading a broad financial investigation that has already convicted Montgomery, sports agent Charles Wells, and her coach, Steve Riddick.

===Criminal sentencing===

Prosecutors told U.S. District Judge Kenneth Karas that any sentence between probation and six months&#x27; imprisonment would be fair (with the maximum penalty being five years in prison); Karas responded by seeking advice as to whether he could go beyond the six-month sentence. Meanwhile, Jones&#x27;s lawyers asked that her penalty be limited to probation and community service, arguing, in part, that she had been punished enough by apologizing publicly, retiring from track and field, and relinquishing her five Olympic medals.

On January 11, 2008, Karas sentenced Jones to six months in jail for her involvement in the check fraud case and her use of performance-enhancing drugs. During the sentencing hearing, the judge admonished her, saying that she knew what she was doing and would be punished accordingly. &quot;The offenses here are serious. They each involve lies made three years apart&quot;, Karas said, adding that Jones&#x27;s actions were &quot;not a one-off mistake...but a repetition in an attempt to break the law.&quot;

Jones was ordered to surrender on March 15, 2008. She reported four days early, on March 11, at the Federal Medical Center, Carswell prison in Fort Worth and was assigned Federal Bureau of Prisons register no. 84868–054. She was released from prison on September 5, 2008.

<doc id="72660" wikidata="Q191934" url="?curid=72660" title="Commensalism">
<text>Commensalism is a long-term biological interaction (symbiosis) in which members of one species gain benefits while those of the other species neither benefit nor are harmed. This is in contrast with mutualism, in which both organisms benefit from each other; amensalism, where one is harmed while the other is unaffected; and parasitism, where one is harmed and the other benefits.

The commensal (the species that benefits from the association) may obtain nutrients, shelter, support, or locomotion from the host species, which is substantially unaffected. The commensal relation is often between a larger host and a smaller commensal; the host organism is unmodified, whereas the commensal species may show great structural adaptation consistent with its habits, as in the remoras that ride attached to sharks and other fishes. Remoras feed on their hosts&#x27; fecal matter, while pilot fish feed on the leftovers of their hosts&#x27; meals. Numerous birds perch on bodies of large mammal herbivores or feed on the insects turned up by grazing mammals.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;commensalism&quot; is derived from the word &quot;commensal&quot;, meaning &quot;eating at the same table&quot; in human social interaction, which in turn comes through French from the Medieval Latin &quot;commensalis&quot;, meaning &quot;sharing a table&quot;, from the prefix &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;together&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;table&quot; or &quot;meal&quot;. Commensality, at the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, refers to professors eating at the same table as students (as they live in the same &quot;college&quot;).

The Belgian zoologist and paleontologist Pierre-Joseph van Beneden introduced the term &quot;commensalism&quot; in 1876.

== Examples of commensal relationships ==

The commensal pathway was traversed by animals that fed on refuse around human habitats or by animals that preyed on other animals drawn to human camps. Those animals established a commensal relationship with humans in which the animals benefited but the humans received little benefit or harm. Those animals that were most capable of taking advantage of the resources associated with human camps would have been the &#x27;tamer&#x27; individuals: less aggressive, with shorter fight-or-flight distances. Later, these animals developed closer social or economic bonds with humans and led to a domestic relationship.

The leap from a synanthropic population to a domestic one could only have taken place after the animals had progressed from anthropophily to habituation to commensalism and partnership, at which point the establishment of a reciprocal relationship between animal and human would have laid the foundation for domestication, including captivity and then human-controlled breeding. From this perspective, animal domestication is a coevolutionary process in which a population responds to selective pressure while adapting to a novel niche that includes another species with evolving behaviors.

===Dogs and humans===
The dog was the first domesticated animal and was domesticated and widely established across Eurasia before the end of the Pleistocene, well before the cultivation of crops or the domestication of other animals. The dog is often hypothesised to be a classic example of a domestic animal that likely traveled a commensal pathway into domestication. Archaeological evidence, such as the Bonn–Oberkassel dog dating to ~14,000 BP, supports the hypothesis that dog domestication preceded the emergence of agriculture and began close to the Last Glacial Maximum when hunter-gatherers preyed on megafauna.

The wolves more likely drawn to human camps were the less aggressive, subdominant pack members with lowered flight response, higher stress thresholds, and less wary around humans, and therefore better candidates for domestication.
Proto-dogs might have taken advantage of carcasses left on site by early hunters, assisted in capturing prey, or provided defense from large competing predators at kills. However, the extent to which proto-domestic wolves could have become dependent on this way of life prior to domestication and without human provisioning is unclear and highly debated. In contrast, cats may have become fully dependent on a commensal lifestyle before being domesticated by preying on other commensal animals, such as rats and mice, without any human provisioning. The debate over the extent to which some wolves were commensal with humans before domestication stems from the debate over the level of human intentionality in domestication, which remains untested.

The earliest sign of domestication in dogs was the neotenization (retaining juvenile features into adulthood) of skull morphology and the shortening of snout length that results in tooth crowding, reduction in tooth size, and a reduction in the number of teeth, which has been attributed to the strong selection for reduced aggression. This process may have begun during the initial commensal stage of dog domestication, even before humans began to be active partners in the process.

A mitochondrial, microsatellite, and Y-chromosome assessment of two wolf populations in North America combined with satellite telemetry data revealed significant genetic and morphological differences between one population that migrated with and preyed upon caribou and another territorial ecotype population that remained in a boreal coniferous forest. Although these two populations spend a period of the year in the same place, and though there was evidence of gene flow between them, the difference in prey-habitat specialization has been sufficient to maintain genetic and even coloration divergence.

A different study has identified the remains of a population of extinct Pleistocene Beringian wolves with unique mitochondrial signatures. The skull shape, tooth wear, and isotopic signatures suggested these remains were derived from a population of specialist megafauna hunters and scavengers that became extinct while less specialized wolf ecotypes survived. Analogous to the modern wolf ecotype that has evolved to track and prey upon caribou, a Pleistocene wolf population could have begun following mobile hunter-gatherers, thus slowly acquiring genetic and phenotypic differences that would have allowed them to adapt to the human habitat more successfully.

===&quot;Aspergillus&quot; and &quot;Staphylococcus&quot;===

Numerous genera of bacteria and fungi live on and in the human body as part of its natural flora. The fungal genus &quot;Aspergillus&quot; is capable of living under considerable environmental stress, and thus is capable of colonising the upper gastrointestinal tract where relatively few examples of the body&#x27;s gut flora can survive due to highly acidic or alkaline conditions produced by gastric acid and digestive juices. While &quot;Aspergillus&quot; normally produces no symptoms, in individuals who are immunocompromised or suffering from existing conditions such as tuberculosis, a condition called aspergillosis can occur, in which populations of &quot;Aspergillus&quot; grow out of control.

&quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, a common bacterial species, is known best for its numerous pathogenic strains that can cause numerous illnesses and conditions. However, many strains of &quot;S. aureus&quot; are metabiotic commensals, and are present on roughly 20 to 30% of the human population as part of the skin flora. &quot;S. aureus&quot; also benefits from the variable ambient conditions created by the body&#x27;s mucous membranes, and as such can be found in the oral and nasal cavities, as well as inside the ear canal. Other &quot;Staphylococcus&quot; species including &quot;S. warneri&quot;, &quot;S. lugdunensis&quot; and &quot;S. epidermidis&quot;, will also engage in commensalism for similar purposes.

=== &quot;Nitrosomonas&quot; spp and &quot;Nitrobacter&quot; spp ===
Commensalistic relationships between microorganisms include situations in which the waste product of one microorganism is a substrate for another species. One good example is nitrification-the oxidation of ammonium ion to nitrate. Nitrification occurs in two steps: first, bacteria such as &quot;Nitrosomonas&quot; spp. and certain crenarchaeotes oxidize ammonium to nitrite; and second, nitrite is oxidized to nitrate by &quot;Nitrobacter&quot; spp. and similar bacteria. &quot;Nitrobacter&quot; spp. benefit from their association with &quot;Nitrosomonas&quot; spp. because they use nitrite to obtain energy for growth.

Commensalistic associations also occur when one microbial group modifies the environment to make it better suited for another organism. The synthesis of acidic waste products during fermentation stimulates the proliferation of more acid-tolerant microorganisms, which may be only a minor part of the microbial community at neutral pH. A good example is the succession of microorganisms during milk spoilage.

Biofilm formation provides another example. The colonization of a newly exposed surface by one type of microorganism (an initial colonizer) makes it possible for other microorganisms to attach to the microbially modified surface.

=== Octocorals and brittle stars ===

In deep-sea, benthic environments there is an associative relationship between octocorals and brittle stars. Due to the currents flowing upward along seamount ridges, atop these ridges there are colonies of suspension feeding corals and sponges, and brittle stars that grip tight to them and get up off the sea floor. A specific documented commensal relationship is between the ophiuran &quot;Ophiocreas oedipus&quot; Lyman and the octocoral primnoid &quot;Metallogorgia melanotrichos&quot;.

Historically, commensalism has been recognized as the usual type of association between brittle stars and octocorals. In this association, the ophiurans benefit directly by being elevated through facilitating their feeding by suspension, while the octocorals do not seem to benefit or be harmed by this relationship.

Recent studies in the Gulf of Mexico have suggested that there are actually some benefits to the octocorals, such as receiving a cleaning action by the brittle star as it slowly moves around the coral. In some cases, a close relationship occurs between cohabiting species, with the interaction beginning from their juvenile stages.

== Arguments ==

Whether the relationship between humans and some types of gut flora is commensal or mutualistic is still unanswered.

Some biologists argue that any close interaction between two organisms is unlikely to be completely neutral for either party, and that relationships identified as commensal are likely mutualistic or parasitic in a subtle way that has not been detected. For example, epiphytes are &quot;nutritional pirates&quot; that may intercept substantial amounts of nutrients that would otherwise go to the host plant. Large numbers of epiphytes can also cause tree limbs to break or shade the host plant and reduce its rate of photosynthesis. Similarly, phoretic mites may hinder their host by making flight more difficult, which may affect its aerial hunting ability or cause it to expend extra energy while carrying these passengers.

== Types ==

Like all ecological interactions, commensalisms vary in strength and duration from intimate, long-lived symbioses to brief, weak interactions through intermediaries.

=== Phoresy ===

Phoresy is one animal attached to another exclusively for transport, mainly arthropods, examples of which are mites on insects (such as beetles, flies or bees), pseudoscorpions on mammals or beetles, and millipedes on birds. Phoresy can be either obligate or facultative (induced by environmental conditions).

=== Inquilinism ===
Inquilinism is the use of a second organism for permanent housing. Examples are epiphytic plants (such as many orchids) that grow on trees, or birds that live in holes in trees.

=== Metabiosis ===

Metabiosis is a more indirect dependency, in which one organism creates or prepares a suitable environment for a second. Examples include maggots, which develop on and infest corpses, and hermit crabs, which use gastropod shells to protect their bodies.

=== Facilitation ===
Facilitation or probiosis describes species interactions that benefit at least one of the participants and cause harm to neither.

=== Necromeny ===
Necromeny is one animal associating with another until the latter dies, then the former feeds on the corpse of the latter. Examples include some nematodes and some mites.

<text>Euphorbia mellifera, the Canary spurge or honey spurge, is a species of flowering plant in the spurge family Euphorbiaceae, native to Madeira and the Canary Islands. It is an evergreen shrub or tree growing to tall and broad, with narrow leaves up to long. In spring it produces brown, honey-scented flowers.

The Latin specific epithet &quot;mellifera&quot; means &quot;producing honey&quot;.

It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit. &quot;Euphorbia&quot; × &quot;pasteurii&quot; is listed as a hybrid between &quot;E. mellifera&quot; and &quot;E. stygiana&quot;. The cultivars &#x27;Phrampton Phatty&#x27;, &#x27;Roundway Titan&#x27; and &#x27;John Phillips&#x27; have received the RHS AGM.

Like all euphorbias, this plant contains a milky-white sap, which oozes out of the stems when cut. This can be a skin irritant and is very harmful to the eyes. Gloves should be worn when pruning,

<text>Fritz Kuhn (born 29 June 1955) is a German politician who served as Mayor of Stuttgart from 2012 until 2021. He was co-chairman of Alliance 90/The Greens, the German Green party, in 2002 and its parliamentary group from 2002 to 2013.

== Early life and education ==
Fritz Kuhn was born in Bad Mergentheim (Baden-Württemberg) and grew up in Memmingen (Bayern), where he attended Bernhard Strigel grammar school. After his A-levels he studied German and philosophy at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and the University of Tübingen, with a master&#x27;s thesis in the field of linguistics.

==Political career==
Kuhn was one of the founding members of the Green Party in the Federal Republic of Germany in 1980.

From 1981 to 1984 he worked as a research assistant at Augsburg university and as a consultant to the parliamentary party of the Greens in the state parliament (&quot;Landtag&quot;) of Baden-Württemberg (South-West Germany).

=== Member of the State Parliament in Baden-Württemberg ===
Kuhn became an MP and the leader of the parliamentary party of the Greens (Alliance 90/The Greens from 1993) in the Landtag of Baden-Württemberg, the state&#x27;s legislature, in 1984, a position he held until 1988, and then later again from 1992 to 2000, having worked as a Professor of Linguistic Communication in the years in between.

Kuhn was one of the two federal chairpersons of Alliance 90/The Greens from 2000 to 2002, first together with Renate Künast, then with Claudia Roth. He resigned from that office in October 2002 after having been elected as a member of the Bundestag, the parliament of the Federal Republic of Germany; at the time, there was a rule in the Green Party that you could not be an MP and hold a party office at the same time.

=== Member of the German Parliament, 2002–2012===
Fritz Kuhn first became a member of the Bundestag in the 2002 federal elections. In the immediate aftermath of the elections, he was part of the Green Party&#x27;s team in the negotiations with the Social Democrats on a coalition agreement for the second government under the leadership of Chancellor Gerhard Schröder.

In the Bundestag, Kuhn specialized in the fields of the economy (fighting for &quot;a green market economy&quot;) and employment, and foreign policy. From 2002 until 2005, he served on the Committee on Foreign Affairs. Between 2005 and 2009, Kuhn was one of the two leaders of the Green parliamentary party (together with Renate Künast), from 2009 he served as deputy leader.

For the 2005 federal elections, Kuhn was the campaign manager of Alliance 90/The Greens. At the 2009 election, he unsuccessfully contested the single member constituency of Heidelberg.

Between 2007 and 2009, Kuhn was one of 32 members of the Second Commission on the modernization of the federal state (&quot;Föderalismuskommission II&quot;), which had been established to reform the division of powers between federal and state authorities in Germany.

=== Mayor of Stuttgart, 2012–present ===
On 21 October 2012 Kuhn was elected Lord Mayor of Stuttgart in Baden-Württemberg with 52.9% of the votes. His 8-year-term as Mayor &quot;(Oberbürgermeister)&quot; began in January 2013. Stuttgart has a population of about 600,000 and is capital city of the Federal State of &quot;Baden-Württemberg&quot;. Kuhn was the first candidate of the German Green party to win in a city of such importance.

Kuhn took over from Wolfgang Schuster, his predecessor, on 7 January 2013. In early 2020, he announced that he would not stand in the next elections but instead resign from active politics by the end of his second term later that year.

<doc id="72664" wikidata="Q21208" url="?curid=72664" title="Hebei">
<text>Hebei is a province in North China. It is China&#x27;s sixth-most populous province, with a population of over 75 million people. Shijiazhuang is the capital city. It borders Shanxi to the west, Henan to the south, Shandong and Liaoning to the east, and Inner Mongolia to the north; in addition, Hebei entirely surrounds the direct-administered municipalities of Beijing and Tianjin on land. Its population is 96% Han Chinese, 3% Manchu, 0.8% Hui, and 0.3% Mongol. Varieties of Chinese spoken include Jilu Mandarin, the Beijing dialect of Mandarin, and Jin Chinese. 

During the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods (771–226 BC), the region was ruled by the states of Yan and Zhao. During the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368), the region was called Zhongshu. It was called North Zhili during the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), and simply Zhili during the Qing dynasty (1644–1912). The modern province of Hebei was created in 1928. Five UNESCO World Heritage Sites can be found in the province: the Great Wall of China, Chengde Mountain Resort, Grand Canal, Eastern Qing tombs, and Western Qing tombs. It is also home to five National Famous Historical and Cultural Cities: Handan, Baoding, Chengde, Zhengding and Shanhaiguan.

Hebei&#x27;s economy is based on agriculture and manufacturing; it is China&#x27;s premier steel producer, which has contributed to serious air pollution.

==Etymology==
&quot;Hebei&quot; means &#x27;north of the river&#x27;, derived from the province&#x27;s location north of the Yellow River in the North China Plain. In the &quot;Yu Gong&quot;, the province is recorded as &quot;Jizhou&quot;, lending to its traditional abbreviation of &quot;Ji&quot; ().

The province&#x27;s nickname is &quot;Yanzhao&quot; (), which is the collective name of the Yan and Zhao states that controlled the region during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods (771–221 BC). In 1421, the Yongle Emperor of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) moved the capital from Nanjing to Beijing, and the province surrounding the new capital was first called North Zhili or Zhili, meaning &#x27;directly ruled&#x27;. When Nanjing became the capital of the Republic of China in 1928, the province of Zhili was abolished and given its present name of Hebei.

==History==
===Pre and early history===
Peking Man, an early pre-historic Homo erectus, lived on the plains of Hebei around 200,000 to 700,000 years ago. Neolithic findings at the prehistoric Beifudi site date to 7000 and 8000 BC.

Many early Chinese myths are set in the province. Fuxi, one of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, is said to have lived in present-day Xingtai. The mythical Battle of Zhuolu, won by the Yellow Emperor, Yan Emperor, and their Yanhuang tribes against the Chiyou-led Jiuli tribes, took place in Zhangjiakou and started the Huaxia civilization.

During the Spring and Autumn period (722–476 BC), Hebei was under the rule of Yan in the north and Jin in the south. Also during this period, a nomadic people known as Dí invaded the plains of northern China and established Zhongshan in central Hebei. In the Warring States period (403–221 BC), Jin was partitioned and much of its territory in Hebei went to Zhao.

===Qin and Han dynasties===
The Qin dynasty unified China in 221 BC. The Han dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD) ruled the area under two provinces, You Prefecture in the north and Ji Province in the south. At the end of the Han dynasty, most of Hebei was under the control of warlords Gongsun Zan in the north and Yuan Shao further south. Yuan Shao emerged as the victor of the two, but he was defeated by Cao Cao in the Battle of Guandu in 200. Hebei came under the rule of the Kingdom of Wei, established by the descendants of Cao Cao.

===Jin through the Three Kingdoms===
After the invasions of northern nomadic peoples at the end of the Western Jin dynasty, chaos ensued in the Sixteen Kingdoms and the Northern and Southern dynasties. Because of its location on the northern frontier, Hebei changed hands many times and was controlled at various times by Later Zhao, Former Yan, Former Qin, and Later Yan. The Northern Wei reunified northern China in 440 but split in 534, with Hebei coming under Eastern Wei; then the Northern Qi, with its capital at Ye near modern Linzhang, Hebei. The Sui dynasty again unified China in 589.
===Tang and Five dynasties===
During the Tang dynasty (618–907), the area was officially called Hebei for the first time. The Great Yan State was established in Hebei from 756 to 763 during the An Lushan Rebellion. After the rebellion, Lulong Jiedushi retained its autonomy from Tang during most of the 9th century. During the late Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, Lulong was fragmented among several regimes including the short-lived Yan. It was eventually annexed in 913 by Li Cunxu, who established the Later Tang (923–936). Emperor Gaozu of the Later Jin dynasty ceded much of northern Hebei to the Khitan Liao dynasty. This territory, called the Sixteen Prefectures of Yanyun, became a weakness in the Chinese defense against the Khitans for the next century because it lay within the Great Wall.

===Song through Yuan dynasties===
During the Northern Song dynasty (960–1127), the sixteen ceded prefectures continued to be an area of contention between Song China and the Liao dynasty. Later, the Southern Song dynasty abandoned all of North China, including Hebei, to the Jurchen Jin dynasty after the 1127 Jingkang Incident of the Jin–Song wars. Hebei was heavily affected by the flooding of the Yellow River; between 1048 and 1128, the river ran directly through the province rather than to its south.

The Mongol Yuan dynasty divided China into provinces but did not establish Hebei as a province. Instead, the area was directly administrated by the Secretariat at the capital Dadu.

===Ming and Qing dynasties===
The Ming dynasty ruled Hebei as Beizhili, meaning Northern Directly Ruled because the area contained and was directly ruled by the imperial capital in Beijing. The &quot;Northern&quot; designation was used because there was a southern counterpart covering present-day Jiangsu and Anhui. When the Manchu Qing dynasty came to power in 1644, they abolished the southern counterpart, and Hebei became known as Zhili or Directly Ruled. During the Qing dynasty, the northern borders of Zhili extended deep into Inner Mongolia and overlapped in jurisdiction with the leagues of Inner Mongolia.

===Republic of China===

The Qing dynasty collapsed in 1912 and was replaced by the Republic of China. In a few years, China descended into a civil war, with regional warlords vying for power. Since Zhili was so close to the capital of Beijing, it was the site of the Zhiwan War, the First Zhifeng War, and the Second Zhifeng War. With the success of the Northern Expedition in 1926 and 1927 by the Kuomintang, the capital was moved from Beijing to Nanjing. As a result, the province&#x27;s name was changed to Hebei, reflecting the relocation of the capital and its standard provincial administration.

During the World War II, Hebei was under the control of the Reorganized National Government of the Republic of China, a puppet state of Imperial Japan.

===People&#x27;s Republic of China===
The founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China saw several changes. The region around Chengde, previously part of Rehe Province (historically part of Manchuria), and the region around Zhangjiakou, previously part of Chahar Province (historically part of Inner Mongolia), were merged into Hebei. This extended its borders northwards beyond the Great Wall. Meanwhile, the city of Puyang was carved away, causing Hebei to lose access to the Yellow River. The city became part of the short-lived Pingyuan Province before eventually being annexed into Henan.

The capital was also moved from Baoding to the new city of Shijiazhuang, and, for a short period, to Tianjin. On July 28, 1976, Tangshan was struck by the Tangshan earthquake, the deadliest earthquake of the 20th century, killing over 240,000 people. There were a series of smaller earthquakes in the following decade.

Today, Hebei, along with Beijing and Tianjin municipalities which it includes, make up the Jing-Jin-Ji megalopolis region. With a population of 130 million, it is about six times the size of the New York metropolitan area and is one of the largest megalopolis clusters in China. Beijing had also unloaded some of its non-capital functions to the province with the establishment of the Xiong&#x27;an New Area, which integrates the three municipalities.

==Geography==
Hebei is the only province in China to contain plateaus, mountains, hills, shorelines, plains, and lakes. Most of central and southern Hebei lies within the North China Plain. Western Hebei rises into the Taihang Mountains (Taihang Shan), while the Yan Mountains (Yan Shan) runs through northern Hebei. Beyond the mountains are the grasslands of Inner Mongolia. The highest peak is Mount Xiaowutai in Yu County in the northwest of the province, with an altitude of .

Hebei borders the Bohai Sea on the east. The Hai River watershed covers most of the province&#x27;s central and southern parts; the Luan River watershed covers the northeast. Excluding manmade reservoirs, the largest lake in Hebei is Baiyangdian, located in Anxin County, Baoding.

Major cities in Hebei include: Shijiazhuang, Baoding, Tangshan, Qinhuangdao, Handan, and Zhangjiakou.

Hebei has a monsoon-influenced humid continental climate. Its winters are cold and dry, while its summers are hot and humid. Temperatures average in January and in July. The annual precipitation ranges from , concentrated heavily in summer.

==Government==

The politics of Hebei is structured in a dual party-government system like all other governing institutions in mainland China. The Governor of Hebei is the highest-ranking official in the People&#x27;s Government of Hebei. However, in the province&#x27;s dual party-government governing system, the governor has less power than the Hebei Chinese Communist Party Provincial Committee Secretary (CCP Party Chief).

===Administrative divisions===

Hebei has eleven prefecture-level divisions. All are prefecture-level cities:

These eleven prefecture-level divisions are subdivided into 168 county-level divisions (47 districts, 21 county-level cities, 94 counties and 6 autonomous counties). Those are, in turn, divided into 2207 township-level divisions (1 district public office, 937 towns, 979 townships, 55 ethnic townships, and 235 subdistricts). At the end of 2017, the total population of Hebei was 75.2 million.

====Urban areas====
====Notes====

==Economy==
In 2014, Hebei&#x27;s gross domestic product (GDP) was 2.942 trillion yuan (US$479 billion). It is ranked sixth in the PRC, with its GDP per capita reaching 40,124 renminbi. As of 2011, the primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors of industry contributed 203.46 billion, 877.74 billion, and 537.66 billion RMB respectively. The registered urban unemployment rate was 3.96%.

Hebei&#x27;s industries include textiles, coal, steel, iron, engineering, chemical production, petroleum, power, ceramics, and food. 40% of Hebei&#x27;s labor force works in the agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry sectors, with the majority of production from these industries going to Beijing and Tianjin. Hebei&#x27;s main agricultural products are cereal crops, including wheat, maize, millet, and sorghum. Cash crops like cotton, peanut, soybeans and sesame are also produced.

Hebei has abundant natural resources. The Kailuan mine in Tangshan, with a history of over 100 years, is one of China&#x27;s first modern coal mines. It remains active, with an annual production of over 20 million metric tonnes. Much of the North China Oilfied is within Hebei. There are major iron mines at Handan and Qian&#x27;an. Iron and steel manufacturing are the largest industries in Hebei.

===Economic and technological development zones===
* Baoding Hi-Tech Industry Development Zone
* Langfang Export Processing Zone
* Qinhuangdao Economic &amp; Technological Development Zone
* Qinhuangdao Export Processing Zone
* Shijiazhuang Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone
* Xiong&#x27;an New Area
==Demographics==
The population in Hebei is mostly Han Chinese. There are 55 ethnic minorities in Hebei, representing 4.27% of the total population. The largest ethnic groups are Manchu (2.1 million people), Hui (600,000 people), and Mongol (180,000 people). Population totals do not include those in active service with the People&#x27;s Liberation Army.
In 2019, the birth rate was 10.83 births per 1,000 people, while the death rate was 6.12 deaths per 1,000 people. The male population is 37,679,003 (50.50%), the female population is 36,931,232 (49.50%). The gender ratio of the total population was 102.02, decreasing by 0.82 from 2010.

===Religion===
The dominant religions in Hebei are Chinese folk religions, Taoist traditions, and Chinese Buddhism. According to surveys conducted in 2007 and 2009, 5.52% of the population believe in and are involved in ancestor veneration, while 3.05% identify as Christian, belonging mostly to the Catholic Church. As of 2010 Muslims constitute 0.82% of the population of Hebei.

Although the surveys did not provide specific data for other religions, 90.61% of the population are either nonreligious or are involved in worship of nature deities, Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, and folk religious sects. Zailiism is a folk religious sect that originated in Hebei. Local worship of deities organized into benevolent churches in reaction to Catholicism in the Qing dynasty.

Hebei has the largest Catholic population in China, with one million members and 1.5 million Catholics according to the Catholic Church. In 1900, apparition of the Virgin Mary was said have appeared in the town of Donglu in Baoding. As a result, Donglu is &quot;one of the strongholds of the unofficial Catholic Church in China&quot;. Many Catholics in Hebei remain loyal to the Pope and reject the authority of the Catholic Patriotic Church. Four of Hebei&#x27;s underground bishops have been imprisoned in recent years: Bishop Francis An Shuxin of Donglu since 1996; Bishop James Su Zhimin since October 1997; Bishop Han Dingxiang of Yongnian who died in prison in 2007, and Bishop Julius Jia Zhiguo of Zhengding since late 1999.

==Culture==

===Language===
People speak dialects of Mandarin across the Hebei, with most classified as part of the Ji Lu Mandarin subdivision of Chinese. Along the western border with Shanxi, dialects are distinct enough for linguists to consider them as part of Jin, another subdivision of Chinese. In general, the dialects of Hebei are similar to the Beijing dialect, which forms the basis for Standard Chinese and the official language of the nation. However, there are also some distinct differences, such as the pronunciation of some words, made by entering tone syllables (syllables ending on a plosive) in Middle Chinese.

===Arts===
Traditional forms of Chinese opera in Hebei include Pingju, Hebei Bangzi (Hebei Clapper Opera), and Cangzhou Kuaiban Dagu. Pingju is especially popular because it tends to use colloquial language which is easier for audiences to understand. Originating from northeastern Hebei, Pingju was influenced by other forms of Chinese opera such as Beijing opera. Traditionally Pingju has a &quot;xiaosheng&quot; (young male lead), a &quot;xiaodan&quot; (young female lead), and a &quot;xiaohualian&quot; (young comic character), though it has diversified to include other roles.

Quyang County, in central Hebei, is noted for Ding ware, a type of Chinese ceramics which includes various vessels such as bowls, plates, vases, and cups, as well as figurines. Ding ware is usually creamy white, though it is also made in other colors.

===Cuisine===
Hebei cuisine is typically based on wheat, mutton, and beans. The donkey burger, originating from the cities of Baoding and Hejian, Cangzhou, is a staple in provincial cuisine and has spread into the two municipalities. Other dishes include local variants of shaobing.

===Entertainment===
Beidaihe, located near Shanhaiguan, is a popular beach resort.

===Architectural and cultural sites===
The Ming Great Wall crosses the northern part of Hebei, and its eastern end is located on the coast at Shanhaiguan (Shanhai Pass), near Qinhuangdao. Informally known as the First Pass of The World, Shanhaiguan Pass was where Ming general Wu Sangui opened the gates to Manchu forces in 1644, beginning nearly 300 years of Manchu rule.

The Chengde Mountain Resort and its outlying temples are a World Heritage Site. Also known as the Rehe Palace, this was the summer resort of the Manchu Qing dynasty emperors. The resort was built between 1703 and 1792. It consists of a palace complex and a large park with lakes, pavilions, causeways, and bridges. There are also several Tibetan Buddhist and Han Chinese temples in the surrounding area.

There are Qing dynasty imperial tombs at Zunhua (Eastern Qing Tombs) and Yixian (West Qing Tombs). The Eastern Qing Tombs are the resting place of 161 Qing emperors, empresses, and other members of the Qing imperial family, while the West Qing Tombs have 76 burials. Both tomb complexes are part of a World Heritage Site.

<text>Claudia Benedikta Roth (; born 15 May 1955) is a German politician (Alliance 90/The Greens). She was one of the two party chairs from 2004 to 2013 and previously served as one of the vice presidents of the &quot;Bundestag&quot;. She is currently serving as &quot;Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media&quot; [de] in the government of Chancellor Olaf Scholz since 2021.

== Biography ==
Roth was born in Ulm, Germany. She began her artistic work, which she always regarded as also being political, in the 1970s as a trained artistic director at a theatre in Memmingen. She then worked at the municipal theatre in Dortmund and the Hoffmanns-Comic-Teater, and subsequently began managing the political rock band &quot;Ton Steine Scherben&quot; until 1985, when the band disbanded due to the band&#x27;s high debt burden.

She came into contact with the Green party on election campaign tours. In 1985, she became press spokesperson for the Green Party&#x27;s parliamentary group in the Bundestag, despite being a newcomer to this line of work.

=== Member of the European Parliament ===
In West Germany&#x27;s 1989 European elections, Roth was elected for the first time as a Member of the European Parliament for the Greens.

Roth served as a member of the new Committee on Civic Liberties and Internal Affairs, the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Sub-Committee on Human Rights. In addition, she was a member of two committees of inquiry in the European Parliament, namely the Committee of Inquiry into Racism and Xenophobia and the Committee of Inquiry into Links between Organized Crime and Drugs, as well as of the EC-Turkey Joint Parliamentary Committee.

From 1989 to 1990, Roth briefly served as deputy chairperson of the Green Group in the European Parliament.

In the 1994 European elections, Roth was again elected to the European Parliament as a lead candidate of Alliance 90/The Greens. She was chairperson of the Green Group in the European Parliament until 1998, first alongside co-chairman Alexander Langer (1994–1995) and later Magda Aelvoet (1995–1998). During this second term as an MEP, she was again a member of the European Parliament Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, the Sub-Committee on Human Rights and the EC-Turkey Joint Parliamentary Committee, of which she was elected deputy chairperson. She also remained involved with the Committee on Foreign Affairs as a substitute member.

=== Member of the German Bundestag ===

Claudia Roth ended her work as an MEP when she became part of the Alliance 90/The Greens parliamentary group in the Bundestag after the 1998 German federal election. She became a member of the Committee on the Affairs of the European Union and a substitute member of the Committee on Internal Affairs of the German Bundestag. Furthermore, she was elected chairperson of the newly established Committee on Human Rights and Humanitarian Aid.

On 9 March 2001, Roth was elected Federal chairperson of Alliance 90/The Greens at the party conference in Stuttgart and resigned as a Member of the Bundestag at the end of March 2001 as a result. At the same time, she was spokesperson of the Alliance 90/The Greens on women&#x27;s affairs.

In the 2002 national elections, Roth was elected to the Bundestag as Bavarian lead candidate for Alliance 90/The Greens. Since then, she has been a member of the Bundestag&#x27;s Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Cultural and Media Affairs. She is also cultural affairs spokesperson for the Alliance 90/The Greens parliamentary group in the Bundestag and chairperson of the German-Turkish Parliamentary Friendship Group.

Between March 2003 and October 2004, in Chancellor Gerhard Schröder&#x27;s second cabinet, Roth served as the Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid at the Federal Foreign Office.

Roth became federal chairperson of Alliance 90/The Greens again in October 2004 and was re-elected as such several times, most recently in November 2010. In 2012, she failed to become the number-one woman in the campaign for the 2013 national elections. After this defeat she was unsure to run again for the position of leader of the party&#x27;s board. Fellow party member Volker Beck started a support campaign in favour of her in social media networks and called it candystorm. The party members subsequently re-elected Roth with 88.5 percent backing.

Roth served as deputy chairwoman of the German-Iranian Parliamentary Friendship Group between 2005 and 2009 and held the same office in the German-Turkish Friendship Group between 2005 and 2013.

===Vice-President of the German Bundestag===
Roth was elected as Vice-President of the German Bundestag on 22 October 2013. In addition, she is a member of the parliament&#x27;s Council of Elders, which – among other duties – determines daily legislative agenda items and assigning committee chairpersons based on party representation. She also serves as a member of the Committee on Economic Cooperation and Development as well as of the Sub-Committee on Cultural Relations and Education Policy. In addition, she is a member of the Art Advisory Board of the German Bundestag.

In the unsuccessful negotiations to form a coalition government with the Christian Democrats – both the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU) – and the Free Democratic Party (FDP) following the 2017 national elections, Roth was part of the 14-member delegation of the Green Party. In the negotiations to form a so-called traffic light coalition of the Social Democrats (SPD), the Green Party and the FDP following the 2021 federal elections, she led her party&#x27;s delegation in the working group on cultural affairs and media; her co-chairs from the other parties are Carsten Brosda and Otto Fricke.

==Political positions==
===On Turkey===
Since her time at the European Parliament, Roth has regularly criticized the European Union&#x27;s &quot;determination to hold Turkey at bay.&quot; In 1995, she expressed doubts about Prime Minister Tansu Çiller&#x27;s ability to bring about human rights reforms as a condition for a European Union–Turkey Customs Union. In June 2013, Roth was at the surroundings of the Taksim Square when the police intervened to evacuate Gezi Park and was among those affected by the tear gas fired by security officers. Following the victory of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in the 2014 presidential election, she criticized the &quot;dramatic erosion of the democratic system in Turkey.&quot;

In May 2017, Roth canceled a visit of a parliamentary delegation to Turkey where participants had planned to talk to opposition lawmakers, governors and rights groups about that year&#x27;s constitutional referendum, saying Ankara had refused to give them a security detail.

===On right-wing extremism===
On Friday 17 March 2006, Roth reported herself to the German police for displaying a crossed-out swastika on multiple demonstrations against Neo-Nazis, and subsequently got the Bundestag to suspend her immunity from prosecution. She intended to show the absurdity of charging anti-fascists with using fascist symbols: &quot;We don&#x27;t need prosecution of non-violent young people engaging against right-wing extremism.&quot;

===On the death penalty===
In 2008, Roth publicly urged incoming U.S. president Barack Obama to &quot;be pushing for the banning of the death penalty, not for upholding it. The death penalty is the biggest blow against human rights and the right to live. He is not in a position to determine whether people live or die, not even in punishing them for the worst crimes!&quot; Speaking in her capacity as leader of the Green Party and underlining the profound divergence in opinion concerning capital punishment in the United States and Western Europe, Roth called the execution of Troy Davis in 2011 &quot;a cynical and inhumane spectacle that occasions mourning and horror.&quot; She has also spoken out against capital punishment on numerous other occasions, including the execution of the LaGrand brothers in 1999 which she attended.

===On patriarchal beauty standards===
In 2015, Roth responded to critics of her appearance, stating that for her to have the wart on her nose removed would be &quot;surrender to the patriarchal standards of beauty pushed by the oppressive right-wing&quot;.

===On the use of military force===
Shortly after the U.S. launched military operations in Afghanistan in October 2001, Roth criticized the use of antipersonnel cluster bombs was &quot;not appropriate&quot;. Her statement came a day after some 10,000 people, some of them carrying banners that said &quot;Against repression and war&quot; and &quot;The American way of life is too expensive for our world,&quot; turned out in Berlin in a peaceful protest against the bombings. When the members of the Green Party later defied their pacifist roots and voted overwhelmingly in favor of sending German soldiers to Afghanistan as part of NATO-led security mission ISAF, Roth maintained that &quot;[the Greens] are and remain an antiwar party. But I think that under certain circumstances it must be possible to engage militarily in order to stop violence.&quot;

As a consequence, Roth has in the past voted in favor of German participation in United Nations peacekeeping missions as well as in United Nations-mandated European Union peacekeeping missions on the African continent, such as in Somalia (2009, 2010), Darfur/Sudan (2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015), South Sudan (2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015), Mali (2014, 2015) and the Central African Republic (2014). In 2013 and 2014, she abstained from the vote on continuing German participation in Operation Atalanta in Somalia, and she voted has against the European Union Training Mission Somalia (2014, 2015 and 2016).

===Arms exports===
In 2010, Roth publicly called for &quot;more stringent control over and sharper criteria governing arms exports.&quot; In 2014, she – alongside fellow Green Party parliamentarians Katja Keul and Hans-Christian Ströbele – lodged a complaint before the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany, arguing that it was unconstitutional for the government to keep the Bundestag in the dark about planned arms deals because it prevented the parliament from fulfilling its role of keeping the government in check. The court ruled that while the government did not have to disclose information about planned defense exports, it did have an obligation to provide the Bundestag with details, on request, once specific arms deals had been approved. In a 2015 interview with &quot;Welt am Sonntag&quot;, Roth singled out exports to Saudi Arabia for criticism, calling the country &quot;the top terror exporter in the Middle East&quot; and raising concerns that the country&#x27;s leaders may turn weapons sold by Germany on their own people.

===Relations with Tibet===
Roth has met the Dalai Lama several times during her time in parliament and has been a supporter of the Tibet movement. In 2015, Roth addressed the official commemoration of the 56th Tibetan National Uprising day alongside Sikyong Lobsang Sangay in Dharamshala. Alongside Robert Badinter and Karel Schwarzenberg, she became one of the first signers of the 2015 Paris Declaration which calls for European governments to develop a coordinated approach in addressing China&#x27;s policies in Tibet.

==Criticism==
Roth has been criticized for her positive relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran. Along with fellow lawmakers Günter Gloser, Monika Grütters, Luc Jochimsen and Peter Gauweiler, she travelled to Iran in 2010 to meet with Ali Larijani, Manouchehr Mottaki and others; the trip was heavily criticized by international human rights organizations. In February 2013, she was reprimanded by German media outlets and Iranian dissidents for warmly greeting the Iranian ambassador to Germany, Alireza Sheikhattar, with a high five; Iranian Kurdish dissidents hold Sheikhattar responsible for the murder of Kurds during his tenure as governor of Iran&#x27;s Kurdistan and West Azerbaijan provinces from 1980 to 1985.

In 2015, Roth again led a German parliamentary delegation for a five-day visit to Tehran, including meetings with Iranian Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani, Deputy Speaker Mohammad-Hassan Aboutorabi Fard, Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi, presidential candidate Mohammad Reza Aref as well as two of President Hassan Rouhani&#x27;s deputies namely Shahindokht Molaverdi, the vice president for women&#x27;s affairs, and Masoumeh Ebtekar, the vice president and chairwoman of the Department of Environment; she was, however, denied a meeting with human-rights activist Narges Mohammadi.

In late February 2024, as the German Minister of Culture, Roth faced criticism from German politicians for permitting what were perceived as &quot;anti-Semitic&quot; remarks by two filmmakers— one of Jewish-Israeli and the other of Muslim Palestinian heritage— during the Berlinale film festival. The filmmakers criticized Israel&#x27;s actions against the Palestinian populations of Gaza and the West Bank, in their various forms, prominently on the festival stage. After widespread criticism, Roth&#x27;s ministry released a press statement claiming that she had only applauded for the Israeli filmmaker and not for the Palestinian one.

==Personal life==
Roth lives in Berlin&#x27;s Charlottenburg district.

<doc id="72668" wikidata="Q363718" url="?curid=72668" title="Ectosymbiosis">
<text>Ectosymbiosis is a form of symbiotic behavior in which an organism lives on the body surface of another organism (the host), including internal surfaces such as the lining of the digestive tube and the ducts of glands. The ectosymbiotic species, or ectosymbiont, is generally an immobile (or sessile) organism existing off of biotic substrate through mutualism, commensalism, or parasitism. Ectosymbiosis is found throughout a diverse array of environments and in many different species.

In some species the symbiotic environment provided by both the parasite and host are mutually beneficial. In recent research it has been found that these micro-flora will evolve and diversify rapidly in response to a change in the external environment, in order to stabilize and maintain a beneficial ectosymbiotic environment.

== Evolutionary history ==
Ectosymbiosis has evolved independently many times to fill a wide variety of ecological niches, both temperate and extreme. Such temperate regions include the seas off the coast of Singapore while the extreme regions reach to the depths of Antarctica and hydrothermal vents. It likely evolved as a niche specialization, which allowed for greater diversity in ectosymbiotic behavior among species. Additionally, in the case of mutualism, the evolution improved the fitness of both species involved, propagating the success of ectosymbiosis. Ectosymbiosis has independently evolved through convergent evolution in all domains of life.

Ectosymbiosis allows niches to form that would otherwise be unable to exist without the support of their host. Inherently, this added niche opens up a new branch off of the evolutionary tree. The evolutionary success of ectosymbiosis is based on the benefits experienced by the ectosymbiont and the host. Due to the dependence of the parasite on the host and the associated benefits and cost to both the parasite and host, the two will continue to coevolve as explained by the Red Queen hypothesis. The Red Queen hypothesis states that a host will continually evolve defenses against a parasitic attack, and the parasite species will also adapt to these changes in the host defense, the result being competitive coevolution between the two species.

Ectosymbiosis adds to the biodiversity of the environment, whether on land, in freshwater, in deserts, or in deep sea vents. Specifically, ectosymbiosis provides a new niche or environment from which many new species can differentiate and flourish.

This niche specialization between species also leads to stabilization of symbiotic relationships between sessile and motile organisms. The ectosymbiont can increase the fitness of their host by assisting with metabolism, nitrogen fixation, or cleaning the host organism. The diversity of advantages has yet to be fully explored, but by virtue of persisting throughout all of recent evolution, they likely confer an adaptive advantage to many of the species that exist solely due to ectosymbiosis.
== Types of host and parasite dynamic ==
Although ectosymbiosis is typically an evolutionary stable behavior, the different host and parasite dynamics independently vary in their stability.

=== Commensalism ===
Commensalism is a form of symbiosis where one species is benefiting from the interactions between species and the other is neither helped nor harmed from the interaction. Ectosymbiotic commensalistic behavior is found frequently in organisms that attach themselves to larger species in order to move long distances or scavenge food easily; this is documented in remoras which attach to sharks to scavenge and travel. An additional ectosymbiotic example of commensalism is the relationship between small sessile organisms and echinoids in the Southern ocean, where the echinoids provide substrate for the small organisms to grow and the echinoids remain unaffected.
=== Mutualism ===
Mutualism is a form of ectosymbiosis where both the host and parasitic species benefit from the interaction. There are many examples of mutualistic ectosymbiosis that occur in nature. One such relationship is between &quot;Branchiobdellida&quot; and crayfish in which the &quot;Branchiobdellida&quot; acts as a bacterial gut cleaner for the crayfish species. Another example is the iron-oxide associated chemoautotrophic bacteria found crusted to the gills of &quot;Rimicaris exoculata&quot; shrimp that provide the shrimp with vital organic material for their survival while simultaneously supporting the bacteria with different organic material that the bacterial cannot produce itself. Groups of organisms – greater than a single pair of a host and parasite – can also form mutualistic ectosymbiotic interactions. Bark beetles can work in a dynamic mutualistic fashion with fungi and mites attached to their exoskeletons, both of which feed off of trees to provide vital energy to the beetles while the beetles provide necessary organic material to the fungi and mites to survive. In this case, the relationship between the fungi and mites is functional because while both do the same job, they are optimally functional at different temperatures.

Mutualistic interactions can be evolutionarily unstable because of the constant battle to maximize one&#x27;s self-benefits. This is due to the limited benefits offered to both the parasite and the host, with the possible outcome for at least one of the species to die out if the other species begins to take advantage of the other. In the case that the mutualistic behavior persists for enough generations, the dynamic can evolve into parasitism, which is a more stable dynamic due to the increased benefit to the parasite that propagates the behavior. In this case the parasite takes advantage of the previously mutualistic host and parasite dynamic, gaining greater benefits for itself.
=== Parasitism ===
Parasitism is a form of symbiosis in which one species benefits from the interactions between species while the other organism is actively harmed. This is the most common form of ectosymbiotic interactions. One of the many examples of ectosymbiotic parasites includes head lice in humans, which feed on blood by attaching to a human&#x27;s scalp. Additionally, mature &quot;Branchiobdellida&quot; bacteria act as a nutrient thief in the gut of crayfish species to exist. In these cases, the head lice and the &quot;Branchiobdellida&quot; are both parasites interacting with host species.

<doc id="72671" wikidata="Q567" url="?curid=72671" title="Angela Merkel">
<text>Angela Dorothea Merkel (; ; born 17 July 1954) is a German retired politician who served as Chancellor of Germany from 2005 to 2021. She is the only woman to have held the office. Merkel previously served as Leader of the Opposition from 2002 to 2005 and as Leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) from 2000 to 2018. During her chancellorship, Merkel was frequently referred to as the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the European Union (EU) and the most powerful woman in the world. Beginning around the 2016 United States presidential election, she was often described as the leader of the free world.

Merkel was born in Hamburg in West Germany. Her family moved to East Germany when she was an infant. Merkel obtained a doctorate in quantum chemistry in 1986 and worked as a research scientist until 1989. She then entered politics in the wake of the Revolutions of 1989, briefly serving as deputy spokeswoman for the first democratically elected government of East Germany led by Lothar de Maizière. Following German reunification in 1990, Merkel was elected to the Bundestag for the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. As the protégée of chancellor Helmut Kohl, Merkel was appointed as Minister for Women and Youth in 1991, later becoming Minister for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety in 1994. After the CDU lost the 1998 federal election, Merkel was elected general secretary of the party. She then became the party&#x27;s first female leader, and the first female leader of the Opposition, two years later.

Following the 2005 federal election, Merkel was elected chancellor, leading a grand coalition consisting of the CDU, the Christian Social Union (CSU), and the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). She was the first woman to be elected chancellor, and the first chancellor of reunified Germany to have been raised in the former East Germany. In the 2009 federal election, the CDU obtained the largest share of the vote, and Merkel subsequently formed a coalition government with the Free Democratic Party (FDP), an alliance more favourable to the CDU than the grand coalition. In the 2013 federal election, the CDU won a landslide victory and formed a second grand coalition with the SPD, after the FDP lost all of its representation in the Bundestag. In the 2017 federal election, Merkel led the CDU to become the largest party for the fourth time, resulting in the formation of a third grand coalition with the SPD.

In foreign policy, Merkel emphasised international cooperation, both in the context of the EU and NATO, and initiating the Russian reset and strengthening of Eurasian and transatlantic economic relations. In the first half of 2007, Merkel served as president of the European Council and played a central role in the negotiation of the Treaty of Lisbon and the Berlin Declaration. Merkel&#x27;s governments managed the global 2007–2008 financial crisis and the European debt crisis. She negotiated the 2008 European Union stimulus plan, which focused on infrastructure spending and public investment to counteract the Great Recession. In domestic policy, Merkel&#x27;s &quot;Energiewende&quot; programme supported the development of renewable energy sources and eventually phased out the use of nuclear power in Germany. Despite the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea, which prompted sanctions around the world, she initiated the construction of the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipelines to Russia and protected their construction from United States sanctions imposed in 2019. Reforms to the , health care reform, the 2010s European migrant crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic were major issues during her chancellorship. Merkel stepped down as leader of the CDU in 2018 and did not seek a fifth term as chancellor in the 2021 federal election. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, her legacy came under increased scrutiny both in Germany and abroad for her relatively good relations with Russia and increasing the German economy&#x27;s dependence on Russia, as well as the downsizing of the military that occurred during her tenure.

==Background and early life==

Merkel was born Angela Dorothea Kasner in 1954, in Hamburg, West Germany, the daughter of Horst Kasner (1926–2011; &quot;né&quot; ), a Lutheran pastor and a native of Berlin, and his wife Herlind (1928–2019; née Jentzsch), born in Danzig (now Gdańsk, Poland), a teacher of English and Latin. She has two younger siblings, Marcus Kasner, a physicist, and Irene Kasner, an occupational therapist. In her childhood and youth, Merkel was known among her peers by the nickname &quot;Kasi&quot;, derived from her last name Kasner.

Merkel is of German and Polish descent. Her paternal grandfather, Ludwik Kasner, was a German policeman of Polish ethnicity. After being captured in France during World War I, he joined the Blue Army and likely fought against Germany. He married Merkel&#x27;s grandmother Margarethe, a German from Berlin, and relocated to her hometown where he again worked in the police. In 1930, they Germanised the Polish name Kaźmierczak to Kasner. Merkel&#x27;s maternal grandparents were the Danzig politician Willi Jentzsch and Gertrud Alma (née Drange), a daughter of the city clerk of Elbing (now Elbląg, Poland) Emil Drange. Since the mid-1990s, Merkel has publicly mentioned her Polish heritage on several occasions and described herself as a quarter Polish, but her Polish roots became better known as a result of a 2013 biography.

Religion played a key role in the Kasner family&#x27;s migration from West Germany to East Germany. Merkel&#x27;s paternal grandfather was originally Catholic but the entire family converted to Lutheranism during the childhood of her father, who later studied Lutheran theology in Heidelberg and Hamburg. In 1954, when Angela was just three months old, her father received a pastorate at the church in (a district of Perleberg in Brandenburg), which was then in East Germany. The family moved to Templin and Merkel grew up in the countryside north of East Berlin.

In 1968, Merkel joined the Free German Youth (FDJ), the official communist youth movement sponsored by the ruling Marxist–Leninist Socialist Unity Party of Germany. Membership was nominally voluntary, but those who did not join found it difficult to gain admission to higher education. She did not participate in the secular coming-of-age ceremony Jugendweihe, however, which was common in East Germany. Instead, she was confirmed. During this time, she participated in several compulsory courses on Marxism–Leninism, with her grades only being regarded as &quot;sufficient&quot;. Merkel later said that &quot;Life in the GDR was sometimes almost comfortable in a certain way, because there were some things one simply couldn&#x27;t influence.&quot; Merkel learned to speak Russian fluently at school, and she was awarded prizes for her proficiency in Russian and mathematics, being at the top of her class in these subjects. She completed her school education with the best possible average Abitur grade of 1.0.

==Academic career==
Merkel continued her education at Karl Marx University, Leipzig, where she studied physics from 1973 to 1978. While a student, she participated in the reconstruction of the ruin of the Moritzbastei, a project students initiated to create their own club and recreation facility on campus. Such an initiative was unprecedented in the GDR of that period, and initially resisted by the university. With backing of the local leadership of the SED party, the project was allowed to proceed.

Near the end of her studies, Merkel sought an assistant professorship at an engineering school. As a condition for getting the job, Merkel was told she would need to agree to report on her colleagues to officers of the Stasi. Merkel declined, using the excuse that she could not keep secrets well enough to be an effective spy.

Merkel worked and studied at the Central Institute for Physical Chemistry of the Academy of Sciences in Berlin-Adlershof from 1978 to 1990. At first, she and her husband squatted in Mitte. At the Academy of Sciences, she became a member of its FDJ secretariat. According to her former colleagues, she openly propagated Marxism as the secretary for &quot;Agitation and Propaganda&quot;. However, Merkel has denied this claim and stated that she was secretary for culture, which involved activities like obtaining theatre tickets and organising talks by visiting Soviet authors. She stated: &quot;I can only rely on my memory, if something turns out to be different, I can live with that.&quot;

After being awarded a doctorate (&quot;Dr. rer. nat.&quot;) for her thesis on quantum chemistry in 1986, she worked as a researcher and published several academic papers. In 1986, she was allowed to travel to West Germany to attend a congress. She also participated in a multi-week language course in Donetsk, in the then-Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.

==Early political career==
===1989–1990: German reunification===

The fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 served as the catalyst for Merkel&#x27;s political career. Although she did not participate in the crowd celebrations the night the wall came down, one month later Merkel became involved in the growing democracy movement, joining the new party Democratic Beginning (, abbreviated to DA). Party Leader Wolfgang Schnur appointed her as press spokeswoman of the party in February 1990. However, Schnur was revealed to have served as an &quot;informal co-worker&quot; for the Stasi just a few weeks ahead of the first (and only) multi-party election in 1990 and was later expelled from the party. As a result, the DA lost most of its electoral support, only managing to obtain four seats in the Volkskammer. However, because the DA was a member party of the Alliance for Germany, which won the election in a landslide, the DA was included in the government coalition. Merkel was appointed deputy spokesperson of this last pre-unification government under Lothar de Maizière.

De Maizière was impressed with the way Merkel handled journalists investigating Schnur&#x27;s role in the Stasi. In April 1990, the DA merged with the East German Christian Democratic Union, which in turn merged with its western counterpart after reunification.

===1990–1994: Minister for Women and Youth===

==== Elections ====
In the German federal election of 1990, the first to be held following reunification, Merkel successfully stood for election to the Bundestag in the parliamentary constituency of Stralsund – Nordvorpommern – Rügen in North Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. She received the crucial backing of influential CDU minister and state party chairman Günther Krause. She was re-elected from this constituency (renamed, with slightly adjusted borders, Vorpommern-Rügen – Vorpommern-Greifswald I in 2003) in every election until the CDU lost its direct mandate from the constituency in the 2021 federal election. Almost immediately following her entry into parliament, Merkel was appointed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl to serve as Minister for Women and Youth in the federal cabinet.

In November 1991, Merkel, with the support of the federal CDU, ran for the state leadership of the CDU in the state of Brandenburg, which neighbours Berlin. She lost to Ulf Fink. In June 1993, Merkel was elected leader of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, succeeding her former mentor Günther Krause.

==== Policy ====
Although Merkel had little interest in the political position as such, it has been described as instrumental in building her early political image. During her tenure, the government codified the right to preschool education, although the law only went into effect in 1996. In June 1992, § 218 of the StGB, which governed abortion rights, was rewritten to allow abortions until the 12th week of pregnancy. Though she was personally opposed to abortion at the time, Merkel abstained during the vote on the bill. The law was later overturned by the Federal Constitutional Court on the basis that there must be a general prohibition of abortion.

===1994–1998: Minister for the Environment===

In 1994, she was promoted to the position of Minister for the Environment and Nuclear Safety, which gave her greater political visibility and a platform on which to build her personal political career. As one of Kohl&#x27;s protégées and his youngest Cabinet Minister, she was frequently referred to by Kohl as &quot;my girl&quot; (). During this period, she was closely mentored by Kohl.

As Minister of the Environment, Merkel was instrumental in setting up the United Nations 1995 Berlin Climate Change Conference. She is often credited as having brought about its most notable result, the first international commitment to a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Around this time, she also first hired Beate Baumann, who would remain a close advisor to Merkel. Merkel&#x27;s performance as Minister of the Environment was criticised as &quot;pitiful&quot; by Gerhard Schröder.

===1998–2000: General Secretary of the CDU===

After the Kohl Government was defeated at the 1998 election, Merkel was appointed Secretary-General of the CDU. The 1998 election had widespread impacts; it was the CDU&#x27;s worst performance in a federal election since 1949, and it resulted in Germany&#x27;s first post-war left-wing government, led by the SPD.

In the wake of this defeat on the federal level, Merkel oversaw a string of CDU election victories in six out of seven state elections in 1999, breaking the long-standing SPD-Green hold on the Bundesrat. Following a party funding scandal that compromised many leading figures of the CDUincluding Kohl himself and his successor as CDU Leader, Wolfgang SchäubleMerkel criticised her former mentor publicly and advocated a fresh start for the party without him.

===Early 2000s===

==== Chairperson of the CDU ====
On 10 April 2000, Merkel was elected to replace Schäuble as Chairperson of the CDU, becoming the first female leader of a German party. Her election surprised many observers, as her personality offered a contrast to the party she had been elected to lead; Merkel is a centrist Protestant originating from predominantly Protestant northern Germany, while the CDU is a male-dominated, socially conservative party with strongholds in western and southern Germany, and its Bavarian sister party, the CSU, has deep Catholic roots.
Following Merkel&#x27;s election as CDU Leader, the CDU did not obtain electoral victories in subsequent state elections. In February 2001, her rival Friedrich Merz voiced his intention to become Gerhard Schröder&#x27;s main challenger for Chancellorship in the 2002 election. Merkel&#x27;s own ambition to become Chancellor was well-known, but she lacked the support of the most influential members within her own party. Rival candidate and leader of the CSU Edmund Stoiber was much more popular within the party at the time. In a private negotiation that came to be known as the Merkel agreed to cede the opportunity to challenge Schröder to Stoiber; in exchange, she was to become leader of the CDU/CSU faction in the Bundestag following the election. Although pre-election polling had indicated that voters strongly favoured Stoiber, he went on to lose the election by a thin margin. The election campaign was dominated by the Iraq War. While Chancellor Schröder had made clear he would not join the war in Iraq, Merkel was in support of the war at the time, although she later claimed that she had opposed it.

==== 2002–2005: Leader of the Opposition ====
After Stoiber&#x27;s defeat in 2002, in addition to her role as CDU Leader, Merkel became Leader of the Opposition in the Bundestag, as had been agreed upon between her and Stoiber. Friedrich Merz, who had held the post prior to the 2002 election, was eased out to make way for Merkel.

Merkel supported a substantial reform agenda for Germany&#x27;s economic and social system and was considered more pro-market than her own party (the CDU). She advocated German labour law changes, specifically removing barriers to laying off employees and increasing the allowed number of work hours in a week. She argued that existing laws made the country less competitive, because companies could not easily control labour costs when business was slow.

Merkel argued that Germany should phase out nuclear power less quickly than the Schröder administration had planned.

Merkel advocated a strong transatlantic partnership and German-American friendship. In the spring of 2003, defying strong public opposition, Merkel came out in favour of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, describing it as &quot;unavoidable&quot;. She also criticised the government&#x27;s support for the accession of Turkey to the European Union, instead arguing in favour of a &quot;privileged partnership&quot;.

==2005–2021: Chancellor of Germany==

=== 2005–2009: First CDU–SPD grand coalition ===
==== Election ====
On 30 May 2005, Merkel won the CDU/CSU nomination to challenge Chancellor Gerhard Schröder of the SPD in the 2005 federal elections. Her party began the campaign with a 21point lead over the SPD in national opinion polls, although her personal popularity lagged behind that of the incumbent. However, the CDU/CSU campaign suffered when Merkel, having made economic competence central to the CDU&#x27;s platform, confused gross and net income twice during a televised debate. She regained some momentum after she announced that she would appoint Paul Kirchhof, a former judge at the German Constitutional Court and leading fiscal policy expert, as Minister of Finance.

Merkel and the CDU lost ground after Kirchhof proposed the introduction of a flat tax in Germany, again undermining the party&#x27;s broad appeal on economic affairs. This was compounded by Merkel&#x27;s proposal to increase VAT to reduce Germany&#x27;s deficit and fill the gap in revenue from a flat tax. The SPD were able to increase their support simply by pledging not to introduce flat taxes or increase VAT. Although Merkel&#x27;s standing recovered after she distanced herself from Kirchhof&#x27;s proposals, she remained considerably less popular than Schröder, who had been perceived as the more generally competent and trustworthy candidate. The CDU&#x27;s lead was down to 9 percentage points on the eve of the election, with Merkel having a significant lead in popularity based on opinion polls. On 18 September 2005, Merkel&#x27;s CDU/CSU and Schröder&#x27;s SPD went head-to-head in the national elections, with the CDU/CSU winning 35.2% (CDU 27.8% / CSU 7.5%) of the second votes to the SPD&#x27;s 34.2%. The result was so close that both Schröder and Merkel initially claimed victory. Neither the SPDGreen coalition nor the CDU/CSU and its preferred coalition partners, the Free Democratic Party, held enough seats to form a majority in the Bundestag. A grand coalition between the CDU/CSU and SPD would face the challenge of both parties demanding the chancellorship. However, after three weeks of negotiations, the two parties reached a deal for a grand coalition whereby Merkel would become Chancellor and the SPD would hold 8 of the 16 seats in the cabinet. The deal was approved by both parties at party conferences on 14 November 2005.

Merkel was elected Chancellor by the majority of delegates (397 to 217) in the newly assembled Bundestag on 22 November 2005, but 51 members of the governing coalition voted against her. Reports at the time indicated that the grand coalition would pursue a mix of policies, some of which differed from Merkel&#x27;s political platform as leader of the opposition and candidate for Chancellor. The coalition&#x27;s intent was to cut public spending whilst increasing VAT (from 16 to 19%), social insurance contributions and the top rate of income tax.

When announcing the coalition agreement, Merkel stated that the main aim of her government would be to reduce unemployment, and that it was this issue on which her government would be judged.

==== Healthcare reform ====
Reform of the German healthcare system was a salient issue during the 2005 election; the previous system had been criticised as inefficient and overly bureaucratic. After a significant period of negotiations, a deal was passed in 2006. While this agreement was described as having &quot;saved the coalition government&quot;, it was also widely criticised as ineffectual. The deal also increased the tax burden on employers and their publicly insured employees. The 2006 round of reforms introduced the &quot;health insurance duty&quot;, which establishes that individuals must be insured either through the public insurance system or through private insurance firms and accordingly cannot be uninsured. The reforms also targeted preventive healthcare as a priority, particularly with regards to eldercare.

==== Eurozone crisis ====
On 4 October 2008, following the Irish Government&#x27;s decision to guarantee all deposits in private savings accounts, a move she had strongly criticised, Merkel said there were no plans for the German Government to do the same. The following day, Merkel stated that the government would guarantee private savings account deposits, after all. However, two days later, on 6 October 2008, it emerged that the pledge was simply a political move that would not be backed by legislation. Most other European governments eventually either raised the limits or promised to guarantee savings in full.

The German government stepped in to assist the mortgage company Hypo Real Estate with a bailout. The deal was agreed upon on 6 October, with German banks contributing €30 billion and the Bundesbank €20 billion to an emergency credit line.

At the time of the Greek government-debt crisis, Germany was the largest creditor of the Greek government, giving it significant negotiating power. Merkel is often credited as having &quot;saved the Euro&quot;, primarily due to her coordinating role in the development of debt relief policy. The austerity measures imposed on debtors such as Greece, which were a significant part of Merkel&#x27;s position in the negotiations, have been criticised as overly harsh by some observers. Critics also highlighted Germany&#x27;s own debt management issues. A Bloomberg opinion piece noted that &quot;irresponsible borrowers can&#x27;t exist without irresponsible lenders&quot;; accordingly, &quot;Germany&#x27;s banks were Greece&#x27;s enablers.&quot;

In the course of the financial crisis, the Merkel cabinet increased the budget of the Kurzarbeit programme significantly and extended the permitted duration of such contracts from 6 months to 18 months. Although similar provisions had existed previously, the Merkel cabinet&#x27;s expansion of the programme was widely praised and is credited with having saved 500,000 jobs during the financial crisis.

===2009–2013: CDU–FDP coalition===
Merkel&#x27;s CDU was re-elected in 2009 with an increased number of seats and could form a governing coalition with the FDP. After brief negotiations, the second Merkel cabinet was sworn in on 28 October 2009. In early 2011, Merkel&#x27;s approval ratings plummeted, resulting in heavy losses in state elections for her party. An August 2011 poll found her coalition had only 36% support compared to a rival potential coalition&#x27;s 51%. Notwithstanding the continuing effects of the 20082009 financial crisis, unemployment sank below the mark of 3 million unemployed people in 2011.

==== Abolition of conscription ====
Following increased debate on the subject in the summer of 2010, the German government announced plans to abolish conscription in Germany, making the a volunteer military, in November 2010. The decision was finalised in December that year, and conscription was suspended on 1 July 2011. Although somewhat popular at the time, the decision has later come under scrutiny, particularly following to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It has also been criticised in conjunction with Germany&#x27;s financial commitments to NATO. In 2023, 61% of Germans said that they were in favour of reestablishing conscription.

==== Healthcare reform ====
Responding to a budget deficit of billion in the public healthcare system in 2009, the Merkel government passed widely unpopular healthcare reforms in 2010. The changes reduced healthcare spending in certain areas and increased employer and employee contributions to 15.5% of gross wages. The reforms also established that future contribution increases would only affect the contributions by employers, which was criticised by opposition parties and trade unions.

===2013–2017: Second CDU–SPD grand coalition===

In the election of September 2013, Merkel won one of the most decisive victories in German history, achieving the best result for the CDU/CSU since reunification and coming within five seats of the first absolute majority in the Bundestag since 1957. However, their preferred coalition partner, the FDP, failed to enter parliament for the first time since 1949, being below the minimum of 5% of second votes required to enter parliament.

The CDU/CSU turned to the SPD to form the third grand coalition in postwar German history and the second under Merkel&#x27;s leadership. The third Cabinet of Angela Merkel was sworn in on 17 December 2013.

Merkel scored well in opinion polls on her handling of the recent euro crisis (69% rated her performance as good rather than poor), and her approval rating reached an all-time high of 77% in February 2012 and again in July 2014.

==== 2015 European migrant crisis ====


Throughout the course of the European migrant crisis, Merkel encouraged cooperation between EU member states, urging that Europe needs to act &quot;as a whole&quot;.

In late August 2015, at the height of the crisis, Merkel&#x27;s government suspended the Dublin Regulation, which stipulated that asylum seekers must seek asylum in the first EU country they arrive. Merkel announced that Germany would also process asylum applications from Syrian refugees if they had come to Germany through other EU countries. That year, nearly 1.1 million asylum seekers entered Germany. Merkel coined the phrase (literally &#x27;We can do this&#x27;) around this time.

Junior coalition partner and Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel said that Germany could take in 500,000 refugees annually for the next several years. German opposition to the government&#x27;s admission of the new wave of migrants was strong and coupled with a rise in anti-immigration protests. Merkel insisted that Germany had the economic strength to cope with the influx of migrants and reiterated that there is no legal maximum limit on the number of migrants Germany can take. In September 2015, enthusiastic crowds across the country welcomed arriving refugees and migrants.

Horst Seehofer, leader of the Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU)the sister party of Merkel&#x27;s Christian Democratic Unionand then-Bavarian Minister President, attacked Merkel&#x27;s policies. Seehofer criticised Merkel&#x27;s decision to allow in migrants, saying that &quot;[they were] in a state of mind without rules, without system and without order because of a German decision.&quot; Seehofer argued that as many as 30% of asylum seekers arriving in Germany claiming to be from Syria are in fact from other countries. He argued for a punitive reduction in EU funding for member countries that rejected mandatory refugee quotas. Meanwhile, Yasmin Fahimi, secretary-general of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), the junior partner of the ruling coalition, praised Merkel&#x27;s policy allowing migrants in Hungary to enter Germany as &quot;a strong signal of humanity to show that Europe&#x27;s values are valid also in difficult times&quot;. Merkel&#x27;s approval rating dropped to 54% in October 2015, the lowest it had been since 2011.

In November 2015, there were talks inside the governing coalition to stop family unification for migrants for two years and to establish &quot;Transit Zones&quot; on the border. Additionally, there were plans to provide housing to migrants with a low likelihood of getting approved for asylum until the processing of their application. This led to increased tensions between the CSU, who were generally in favour of these measures and threatened to leave the coalition without them, and the SPD, who opposed them; Merkel agreed to the measures. The November 2015 Paris attacks prompted a reevaluation of the German government&#x27;s stance on EU migration policy. While she did not directly limit the number of immigrants, Merkel tightened asylum policy in Germany, for example through more thorough vetting of migrants with respect to internal safety and security.

In August 2016, following the Würzburg train attack in Germany and various other Islamist terror attacks in Europe, Merkel&#x27;s approval rating dropped to 47%. Half of Germans did not want her to serve a fourth term in office, with only 42% in favour of another term in office. In a poll from October that year, her approval rating was found to have risen again; 54% of Germans were found to be satisfied with the work of Merkel as Chancellor. According to another poll taken in November 2016, 59% were to found to be in favour of a renewed Chancellorship candidature in 2017. According to a poll carried out shortly after the 2016 Berlin truck attack, 56% of Germans named Merkel as a political leader they trusted to solve their country&#x27;s problems.

In October 2016, Merkel travelled to Mali and Niger. The diplomatic visit took place to discuss how their governments could improve conditions which caused people to flee those countries and how illegal migration through and from these countries could be reduced.

The migrant crisis spurred right-wing electoral preferences across Germany with the Alternative for Germany (AfD) gaining 12% of the vote in the 2017 German federal election. These developments prompted debates over the reasons for increased right-wing populism in Germany. Some researchers have argued that increased right-wing preferences are a result of the European migrant crisis, particularly the increasingly common perception that refugees constitute an ethnic and cultural threat to Germany.

Some observers have described Merkel&#x27;s policymaking with respect to the migrant crisis as a success. In 2022, the United Nations&#x27; High Commissioner for Refugees granted Merkel the Nansen Award for her &quot;courage and compassion&quot; during the crisis. However, Merkel has also faced significant criticism, particularly with regards to her policymaking early in the crisis, which some critics describe as hypocritically unilateral.

===2018–2021: Third CDU–SPD grand coalition===

==== Election ====
In the 2017 federal election, Merkel led her party to victory for the fourth time. However, both the CDU/CSU and the SPD received a significantly lower proportion of the vote than they did in 2013, and the CDU/CSU subsequently attempted to form a coalition with the FDP and Greens. The SPD announced that they would go into the Opposition, both due to their loss of popular support and because the idea of another grand coalition was widely unpopular at the time.

The FDP eventually withdrew from negotiations with the CDU/CSU, leading to a stalemate. The German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier subsequently appealed successfully to the SPD to change their hard stance against coalition with the CDU/CSU, and the SPD agreed to a third grand coalition with the CDU/CSU. The negotiations leading up to this agreement were the longest in German post-war history, lasting almost six months.

A YouGov survey published in late December 2017 found that just 36% of all respondents wanted Merkel to stay at the helm until 2021, while half of those surveyed voters called for a change at the top before the end of the legislature.

The Fourth Merkel cabinet was sworn in on 14 March 2018.

==== 2018 government crisis ====

As part of the newly formed government, the CSU&#x27;s Horst Seehofer took over the role of Interior Minister. Seehofer announced that he had a &quot;master plan for faster asylum procedures, and more consistent deportations.&quot; Under Seehofer&#x27;s plan, Germany would immediately reject prospective immigrants who had already been deported or were subject to an entry ban. Additionally, the police would be instructed to turn away all applicants who had previously registered elsewhere in the EU, no matter if these countries agreed to take them back. Merkel feared that unilaterally sending migrants back to neighbouring countries without seeking a multilateral European agreement could endanger the stability of the European Union.

In June 2018, Seehofer issued an ultimatum to Merkel; as Interior Minister, he could unilaterally implement the policy without her support. Although he eventually agreed to cooperate with Merkel while she negotiated with other EU member countries, he went on to reject the EU agreement that she obtained. On 1 July 2018, during a meeting with party leadership, Seehofer declared his intention to resign from his position in protest. During the night of 2 July 2018, Seehofer and Merkel announced they had settled their differences and agreed to instead accept a compromise of tighter border control. As a result of the agreement, Seehofer agreed to not resign, and to negotiate bilateral agreements with the specific countries himself. Seehofer received some criticism for his stance in the crisis.

==== COVID-19 pandemic ====
In the initial phases of the pandemic, Germany established a crisis team to manage Germany&#x27;s containment policy and pandemic response. In late February 2020, referring to this crisis team, Merkel recommended an approach characterised by moderation and an avoidance of extreme or universal measures ().

On 18 March 2020, Merkel gave a widely publicised speech on the COVID-19 pandemic, comparing its challenges to the Second World War:

The speech was well-received both nationally and internationally, receiving widespread attention and an award for &quot;speech of the year&quot;.

On 6 April 2020, Merkel stated: &quot;In my view ... the European Union is facing the biggest test since its foundation and member states must show greater solidarity so that the bloc can emerge stronger from the economic crisis unleashed by the pandemic&quot;. Merkel has won international plaudits for her handling of the pandemic in Germany.

Later that month, Merkel was praised for her accessible explanation of the basic reproduction number, which had been an important metric in the German government&#x27;s pandemic response. Merkel opposed mandatory vaccinations, instead stressing scientific literacy and education.

During the German presidency of the European Council, Merkel spearheaded negotiations for the Next Generation EU reconstruction package.

=== Succession ===
On 29 October 2018, Merkel announced that she would not seek reelection as leader of CDU at their party conference in December 2018, but intended to remain as chancellor until the 2021 German federal election was held. She stated that she did not plan to seek any political office after this. The resignations followed October setbacks for the CSU in the Bavarian state election and for the CDU in the Hessian state election. In August 2019, Merkel hinted that she might return to academia at the end of her term in 2021.

She decided not to suggest any person as her successor as leader of the CDU. However, political observers had long considered Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer as Merkel&#x27;s protégé groomed for succession. This view was confirmed when Kramp-Karrenbauer – widely seen as the chancellor&#x27;s favourite for the post – was voted to succeed Merkel as leader of the CDU in December 2018. Kramp-Karrenbauer&#x27;s elevation to Defence Minister after Ursula von der Leyen&#x27;s departure to become president of the European Commission also boosted her standing as Merkel&#x27;s most likely candidate for succession. In 2019, media outlets speculated that Kramp-Karrenbauer might take over Merkel&#x27;s position as Chancellor sooner than planned if the current governing coalition proved unsustainable. The possibility was neither confirmed nor denied by the party. In February 2020, Kramp-Karrenbauer announced that she would resign as party leader of the CDU in the summer, after party members in Thuringia defied official party lines and voted with Alternative for Germany to support an FDP candidate for minister-president. Kramp-Karrenbauer was succeeded by Armin Laschet at the 2021 CDU leadership election.

In the 2021 federal election, the SPD won the most votes. This necessitated long negotiations among the various parties to form a government. On 23 November 2021, a new grand coalition was announced, with Olaf Scholz nominated to succeed Merkel. Merkel continued to serve as chancellor until 8 December 2021, when Scholz was sworn in. The constituency she had held since its establishment in the German reunification was won by Anna Kassautzki (SPD).

== 2022–present: Post-chancellorship ==
On 31 January 2022, less than two months after she left office, her long-time rival Friedrich Merz, who she beat in 2002 to become leader of the opposition, took over as leader of the CDU.

On 25 February 2022, only 24 hours after the Russian invasion of Ukraine began, Merkel told the &quot;DPA&quot; that she &quot;condemned in the strongest terms [...] the war of aggression led by Russia, which marks a profound break in the history of post-Cold War Europe.&quot;

In April that year, a spokesperson for Merkel stated that she &quot;stood by her position at the NATO summit in Bucharest in 2008&quot;, when she had opposed Ukraine&#x27;s membership in the North Atlantic Alliance, a decision that had come under increased scrutiny.

On 1 June 2022, Merkel made her first semi-public comments about political affairs since leaving office, at a retirement party for , the president of the German Trade Union Confederation. She criticised the &quot;blatant violation of international law by Russia&quot;, expressed solidarity with Ukraine, and argued that &quot;peace and freedom can never be taken for granted.&quot;

On 7 June 2022, Merkel made her first public comments. In an interview with journalist , she defended her past decisions on Ukraine and called Putin&#x27;s aggression,

She also said that by the end of her chancellorship in September 2021, it had been clear that Putin was moving in the direction of conflict and that he was finished with the Normandy Format talks.

Following her retirement, Merkel wrote a memoir called &quot;Freedom&quot; (), with her longtime assistant and adviser, Beate Baumann. It was released on November 26, 2024 with the title &quot;Freedom: Memories 1954–2021&quot;. The book was published in 30 languages and consists of 736 pages.

In January 2025, Merkel criticised Friedrich Merz for introducing a non-binding resolution supporting restrictions on immigration that passed in the Bundestag with the help of the AfD.

==Political positions==
===Immigration, refugees and migration===
In October 2010, Merkel told a meeting of younger members of her conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party at Potsdam that attempts to build a multicultural society in Germany had &quot;utterly failed&quot;, stating that: &quot;The concept that we are now living side by side and are happy about it&quot; does not work and &quot;we feel attached to the Christian concept of mankind, that is what defines us. Anyone who doesn&#x27;t accept that is in the wrong place here.&quot; She continued to say that immigrants should integrate and adopt Germany&#x27;s culture and values. This added to a growing debate within Germany on the acceptable levels and mechanisms of immigration, its effects on Germany, and the degree to which Muslim immigrants had integrated into German society.

Merkel is in favour of a &quot;mandatory solidarity mechanism&quot; for relocation of asylum-seekers from Italy and Greece to other EU member states as part of the long-term solution to Europe&#x27;s migrant crisis.

===Foreign policy===
Merkel&#x27;s foreign policy has focused on strengthening European cooperation and international trade agreements. She and her governments have been closely associated with the change through trade () policy. For this, she has come under criticism, especially after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Merkel has been widely described as the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the European Union throughout her tenure as Chancellor.

In 2015, with the absence of Stephen Harper, Merkel became the only leader to have attended every G20 meeting since the first in 2008, having been present at a record fifteen summits as of 2021. She hosted the twelfth meeting at the 2017 G20 Hamburg summit.

Merkel favors the Association Agreement between Ukraine and the European Union. In December 2012, she stated that its implementation depends on reforms in Ukraine.

Merkel expressed support for Israel&#x27;s right to self-defence in the context of the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict. She telephoned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on 9 July to condemn &quot;without reservation rocket fire on Israel&quot;.

On 20 June 2018, which was World Refugee Day, Merkel said that there had been &quot;no moral or political justification&quot; for the post-war expulsion of ethnic Germans from Central and Eastern European countries.

===Social expenditure===

At the World Economic Forum in Davos, 2013, Merkel said that Europe had only 7% of the global population and produced only 25% of the global GDP, but that it accounted for almost 50% of global social expenditure. She went on to say that Europe could only maintain its prosperity by being innovative and measuring itself against the best. After this, the comparison became a central element in major speeches. The international financial press has widely commented on her thesis, with &quot;The Economist&quot; saying:

The &quot;Financial Times&quot; commented: &quot;Although Ms Merkel stopped short of suggesting that a ceiling on social spending might be one yardstick for measuring competitiveness, she hinted as much in the light of soaring social spending in the face of an ageing population.

=== Climate policy ===
Merkel has been credited as a key part of 2007 G8 negotiations that led to a significantly more ambitious renewable energy transition commitment than had been anticipated.

In September 2010, the coalition government published a long-term plan for sustainable development of the electrical grid until 2050; efforts to transition to sustainable and otherwise preferable sources of energy have been termed Energy Transition (). Although the initial plan was criticised for lifetime extensions of nuclear power plants, it was amended following the Fukushima nuclear disaster, and the last nuclear power plants in Germany were shut down in April 2023. The plan also aimed at a 40% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2020, a goal that was initially achieved largely due to reductions in demand during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, emissions increased to a level above the target in 2022.

In preparation for the 2015 Paris Climate Change Conference, Merkel announced that Germany would significantly increase its contributions to international climate aid and financing by 2020. In 2016, some observers criticised Merkel&#x27;s lack of action with regards to climate change that year. In 2017, Merkel criticised the Trump administration&#x27;s decision to withdraw from the 2015 Paris Agreement and reaffirmed the commitment of the remaining G20 members to the treaty.

In early 2019, a governmental commission appointed by the coalition government approved a plan to phase out coal power plants by 2038, allocating a budget of billion to the plan.

In September 2019, the Merkel government announced a set of climate change mitigation policies with a total budget of billion. Although described as a &quot;new beginning for Germany&#x27;s climate policy&quot; by then-minister of the environment Svenja Schulze, the package was widely criticised; environmental protection groups have labelled it insufficient, and opposition parties have argued that it is ineffective. Prominent climate scientists have called it &quot;a failure of the political system&quot; and &quot;ridiculous&quot;.

=== Fiscal policy ===
In 2009, Merkel announced plans to take on additional government debt in order to stimulate economic growth, arguing that this should take priority over other fiscal concerns. The Merkel government&#x27;s tax policy at the time was widely criticised, mostly for taking on additional debt instead of increasing tax rates at high levels of income. In 2010, Merkel expressed support for a global financial transaction tax, but was ultimately unsuccessful in international negotiations on the matter.

In 2019, Merkel argued for the importance of a balanced government budget, rejecting calls for additional investment to stimulate growth.

==Criticism==
Merkel has been criticised for being personally present and involved at the M100 Media Award handover to Danish cartoonist Kurt Westergaard, who had triggered the Muhammad cartoons controversy. This happened at a time of fierce debate over a book by the former Deutsche Bundesbank executive and finance senator of Berlin Thilo Sarrazin, which was critical of Muslim immigration. At the same time, she condemned a planned burning of Qurans by a fundamentalist pastor in Florida. The Central Council of Muslims in Germany and the Left Party (Die Linke) as well as the German Green Party criticised the action by the centre-right chancellor. The &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; newspaper wrote: &quot;This will probably be the most explosive moment of her chancellorship so far.&quot;

The term &quot;alternativlos&quot; (German for &quot;without an alternative&quot;), which was frequently used by Angela Merkel to describe her measures addressing the European sovereign-debt crisis, was named the Un-word of the Year 2010 by a jury of linguistic scholars. The wording was criticised as undemocratic, as any discussion on Merkel&#x27;s politics would thus be deemed unnecessary or undesirable. The expression is credited for the name of the political party Alternative for Germany, which was founded in 2013.

During a visit of U.S. President Barack Obama in Berlin, Merkel said on 19 June 2013 in the context of the 2013 mass surveillance disclosures: &quot;The Internet is uncharted territory for us all&quot; (). This statement led to various internet memes and online mockery of Merkel.

During a state visit of the Turkish prime minister Ahmet Davutoğlu in January 2015, Merkel stated that &quot;Islam is part of Germany&quot;, which induced criticism from within her party. Parliamentary group leader Volker Kauder stated that Muslims belong to Germany, but Islam does not, and that Muslims should &quot;ask themselves why so many violent people refer to the Quran.&quot;

At the conclusion of the May 2017 Group of Seven&#x27;s leaders in Sicily, Merkel criticised American efforts to renege on earlier commitments on climate change. According to Merkel, the discussions were difficult and marred by dissent. &quot;Here we have the situation where six members, or even seven if you want to add the EU, stand against one.&quot;

Merkel has faced criticism for failing to take a tough line on the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The &quot;Asia Times&quot; reported that &quot;Unlike certain of her European counterparts, her China diplomacy has focused on non-interference in Beijing&#x27;s internal affairs. As such, Merkel was reportedly furious when her Foreign Minister Heiko Maas received Hong Kong dissident Joshua Wong in Berlin in September [2019], a move that Beijing publicly protested.&quot;

Merkel&#x27;s government decided to phase out both nuclear power and coal plants and supported the European Commission&#x27;s Green Deal plans. Critics blamed the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) and closure of nuclear plants for contributing to the 2021–2022 global energy crisis.

Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Merkel faced renewed criticisms that she had failed to curb Russian president Vladimir Putin&#x27;s ambitions and aggression by insisting on diplomacy and détente policies. Critics argued that under her tenure, Germany and Europe was weakened by a dependency on Russian natural gas, including the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 pipelines, and that the German military was neglected, disorganised, and underfunded. By late 2021, Germany was importing 55% of its gas, 34% of its oil, and 52% of its coal from Russia.

Merkel&#x27;s chancellorship has become tightly associated with the policy of Wandel durch Handel, which advocates pursuing close economic ties with authoritarian governments with the goal of inducing democratization. When the &quot;Wandel durch Handel&quot; policy came under intense domestic and international scrutiny following the Russian invasion, Merkel received much of the blame, leading Politico to write &quot;[n]o German is more responsible for the crisis in Ukraine than Merkel&quot;. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy also blamed Merkel and then-French president Nicolas Sarkozy&#x27;s decision to block Ukraine from joining NATO in 2008 for the war; Merkel released a statement that she stands by her decision, later adding that the war would have broken out earlier at a greater military disadvantage for Ukraine.

== Legacy and public image ==
=== International perceptions ===

Merkel was widely described as the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the European Union throughout her tenure as Chancellor. She was named the world&#x27;s second most powerful person by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine in 2012 and 2015, following Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin respectively, the highest ranking ever achieved by a woman. On 26 March 2014, Merkel became the longest-serving incumbent head of government in the European Union. In December 2015, Merkel was named as &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s Person of the Year, with the magazine&#x27;s cover declaring her to be the &quot;Chancellor of the Free World&quot;. In 2018, Merkel was named the most powerful woman in the world for a record fourteenth time by &quot;Forbes&quot;. Following the election of Donald Trump to the US presidency in 2016, Merkel was described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;the Liberal West&#x27;s Last Defender&quot;, and as the &quot;leader of the free world&quot; by a number of commentators, including Hillary Clinton. In a 2018 survey, Merkel was found to be the most widely respected world leader. &quot;The Atlantic&quot; described her in 2019 as &quot;the world&#x27;s most successful living politician, on the basis of both achievement and longevity&quot;. Harvard University President Larry Bacow described her as &quot;one of the most widely admired and broadly influential statespeople of our time&quot;.

Critics have argued that Merkel&#x27;s policymaking during the 2015 migrant crisis has damaged the integrity of the EU. Some have also commented that Germany&#x27;s failure to meet financial commitments to NATO, Merkel&#x27;s blocking of the accession of Ukraine to NATO in 2008, and the abolishment of conscription have together weakened the positions of Germany and Europe following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

In 2023, Merkel received a doctorate honoris causa from the Paris Institute of Political Sciences in recognition of her political career.

=== Domestic image ===
Merkel has been described as having significantly shaped the political landscape of Germany, particularly the perceptions of those who grew up during her chancellorship; this demographic group has been referred to ().

=== Comparisons ===
As a woman who is a politician from a centre-right party and also a scientist, Merkel has been compared by many in the English-language press to 20th century British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Thatcher also had a science degree from Oxford University in chemistry. Some have referred to her as &quot;Iron Lady&quot;, &quot;Iron Girl&quot;, and even &quot;The Iron Frau&quot;, all alluding to Thatcher, whose nickname was &quot;The Iron Lady&quot;. Political commentators have debated the precise extent to which their agendas are similar. Later in her tenure, Merkel acquired the nickname &quot;Mutti&quot; (a German familiar form of &quot;mother&quot;). She has also been called the &quot;Iron Chancellor&quot;, in reference to Otto von Bismarck.

&quot;Al Jazeera&quot; has criticised the &quot;Iron Lady&quot; nickname for Merkel as &quot;wrong-headed&quot;, noting her pro-European stance, her efforts to combat &quot;profit-seeking speculators&quot; during the euro crisis, and her lacking Thatcher&#x27;s &quot;my-way-or-the-highway&quot; attitude towards politics.

==Personal life==

In 1977, at the age of 23, Merkel, then Angela Kasner, married physics student Ulrich Merkel (born 1953) and took his surname. The couple divorced in 1982. Her second and current husband is quantum chemist and professor Joachim Sauer, who has largely avoided media attention during and after Merkel&#x27;s political career. They first met in 1981 and married in 1998. Merkel has no children, but Sauer has two adult sons from a previous marriage.

Having grown up in East Germany, Merkel learned Russian at school. She was able to speak informally to Vladimir Putin in Russian but conducted diplomatic dialogue through an interpreter. She rarely spoke English in public but delivered a small section of an address to the British Parliament in English in 2014.

Merkel is a fervent football fan and was known to listen to games while in the Bundestag and to attend games of the national team in her official capacity, including Germany&#x27;s 1–0 victory against Argentina in the 2014 World Cup Final.

Merkel has stated that her favorite film is &quot;The Legend of Paul and Paula&quot;, an East German movie released in 1973.

Merkel has a fear of dogs, which developed after she was attacked by one in 1995. Vladimir Putin brought in his Labrador Retriever during a press conference in 2007. Putin claims he did not mean to scare her, though Merkel later observed, &quot;I understand why he has to do this – to prove he&#x27;s a man. ... He&#x27;s afraid of his own weakness.&quot;

Since 2017, Merkel has occasionally been seen shaking visibly on several public occasions, recovering shortly afterwards. After one such occasion, she attributed the shaking to dehydration, saying that she felt better after a drink of water.

In September 2021, after evading the question for most of her career, Merkel said that she considered herself a feminist. The statement came in a conference along with Nigerian writer and feminist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.

Since her retirement, Merkel has commented on the Russian invasion of Ukraine but has otherwise limited her involvement in political matters. She has instead focused on travelling, attending only &quot;feel-good events&quot; () in a private capacity.

Merkel reportedly &quot;detested&quot; U.S. President Donald Trump, according to &quot;Politico&quot;, citing a forthcoming book by Jonathan Karl.

===Religion===

Angela Merkel is a Lutheran member of the Evangelical Church in Berlin, Brandenburg and Silesian Upper Lusatia (), a United Protestant (i.e. both Reformed and Lutheran) church body under the umbrella of the Protestant Church in Germany. The EKBO is a member of the Union of Protestant Churches in the EKD. Before the 2004 merger of the Evangelical Church in Berlin-Brandenburg and the Evangelical Church in Silesian Upper Lusatia, Merkel belonged to the former. In 2012, Merkel said, regarding her faith: &quot;I am a member of the Protestant Church. I believe in God and religion is also my constant companion, and has been for the whole of my life. We as Christians should above all not be afraid of standing up for our beliefs.&quot; She also publicly declared that Germany suffers not from &quot;too much Islam&quot; but &quot;too little Christianity&quot;.

==In the arts and media==
Since 1991, Merkel has sat annually for sitting and standing portraits by, and interview with, Herlinde Koelbl.

Merkel was portrayed by Swiss actress Anna Katarina in the 2012 political satire film &quot;The Dictator&quot;.

Merkel features as a main character in two of the three plays that make up the Europeans Trilogy (&quot;Bruges&quot;, &quot;Antwerp&quot;, and &quot;Tervuren&quot;) by Paris-based UK playwright Nick Awde: &quot;Bruges&quot; (2014) and &quot;Tervuren&quot; (2016). A character named Merkel, accompanied by a sidekick called Schäuble, also appears as the sinister female henchman in Michael Paraskos&#x27;s novel &quot;In Search of Sixpence&quot;.

On the American sketch-comedy series &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, Merkel has been parodied by Kate McKinnon.

On the British sketch-comedy &quot;Tracey Ullman&#x27;s Show&quot;, comedian Tracey Ullman has parodied Merkel to international acclaim.

In 2016, a documentary film &quot;Angela Merkel – The Unexpected&quot; was produced by Broadview TV and MDR in collaboration with Arte and Das Erste.

In 2024, a German TV show called &#x27;Miss Merkel&#x27; reimagined her as a detective. It is based on the bestselling novels by German writer David Safier and is a comedy that was a hit in Germany and then shown on public broadcaster RAI, dubbed into Italian.

<doc id="72672" wikidata="Q754845" url="?curid=72672" title="Exocrine gland">
<text>Exocrine glands are glands that secrete substances onto an epithelial surface by way of a duct. Examples of exocrine glands include sweat, salivary, mammary, ceruminous, lacrimal, sebaceous, prostate and mucous. Exocrine glands are one of two types of glands in the human body, the other being endocrine glands, which secrete their products directly into the bloodstream. The liver and pancreas are both exocrine and endocrine glands; they are exocrine glands because they secrete products—bile and pancreatic juice—into the gastrointestinal tract through a series of ducts, and endocrine because they secrete other substances directly into the bloodstream. Exocrine sweat glands are part of the integumentary system; they have eccrine and apocrine types.

==Classification==

===Structure===
Exocrine glands contain a glandular portion and a duct portion, the structures of which can be used to classify the gland.
* The duct portion may be branched (called compound) or unbranched (called simple).
* The glandular portion may be tubular or acinar, or may be a mix of the two (called tubuloacinar). If the glandular portion branches, then the gland is called a branched gland.

===Method of secretion===
Depending on how their products are secreted, exocrine glands are categorized as merocrine, apocrine, or holocrine.
* Merocrine – the cells of the gland excrete their substances by exocytosis into a duct; for example, pancreatic acinar cells, eccrine sweat glands, salivary glands, goblet cells, intestinal glands, tear glands, etc.
* Apocrine – the apical portion of the cytoplasm in the cell membrane, which contains the excretion, buds off. Examples are sweat glands of arm pits, pubic region, skin around anus, lips and nipples; mammary glands, etc.
* Holocrine – the entire cell disintegrates to excrete its substance; for example, sebaceous glands of the skin and nose, meibomian gland, zeis gland, etc.
===Product secreted===
* Serous cells secrete proteins, often enzymes. Examples include gastric chief cells and Paneth cells
* Mucous cells secrete mucus. Examples include Brunner&#x27;s glands, esophageal glands, and pyloric glands
* Seromucous glands (mixed) secrete both protein and mucus. Examples include the salivary glands: although the parotid gland (saliva secretion 25%) is predominantly serous, the sublingual gland (saliva secretion 5%) mainly mucous gland, and the submandibular gland (saliva secretion 70%) is a mixed, mainly serous gland.
* Sebaceous glands secrete sebum, a lipid product. These glands are also known as oil glands, e.g. Fordyce spots and Meibomian glands.

<doc id="72673" wikidata="Q58284" url="?curid=72673" title="Guido Westerwelle">
<text>Guido Westerwelle (; 27 December 1961 – 18 March 2016) was a German politician who served as foreign minister in the second cabinet of Chancellor Angela Merkel and Vice-Chancellor of Germany from 2009 to 2011, being the first openly gay person to hold any of these positions. He also led the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) from 2001 until he stepped down in 2011. A lawyer by profession, he was a member of the Bundestag from 1996 to 2013.

==Early life and education==
Guido Westerwelle was born in Bad Honnef in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. His parents were lawyers. He graduated from Ernst Moritz Arndt Gymnasium in 1980 after academic struggles resulted in his departure from previous institutions where he was considered an average student at best, but substandard otherwise. He studied law at the University of Bonn from 1980 to 1987. Following the First and Second State Law Examinations in 1987 and 1991 respectively, he began practising as an attorney in Bonn in 1991. In 1994, he earned a doctoral degree in law from the University of Hagen.

==Career in the FDP==

Westerwelle joined the FDP in 1980. He was a founding member of the &quot;Junge Liberale&quot; (Young Liberals), which became the party&#x27;s official youth organization in 1983, and he was its chairman from 1983 to 1988. In a 1988 newspaper interview, he singled out the FDP&#x27;s rejection of an amnesty for tax offenders and its diminished enthusiasm for nuclear power as fruits of the youth wing&#x27;s labors.

He was a member of the executive board of the FDP from 1988, and in 1994, he was appointed secretary general of the party.

In 1996, Westerwelle was first elected a member of the Bundestag, filling in for Heinz Lanfermann, who had resigned from his seat after entering the Ministry of Justice. In the 1998 national elections, he was re-elected to parliament. As his parliamentary group&#x27;s home affairs spokesman, he was instrumental in swinging the FDP behind a 1999 government bill to make German citizenship available to children born in Germany of non-German parents.

In 2001, Westerwelle succeeded Wolfgang Gerhardt as party chairman. Gerhardt, however, remained chairman of the FDP&#x27;s parliamentary group. Westerwelle, the youngest party chairman at the time, emphasized economics and education, and espoused a strategy initiated by his deputy Jürgen Möllemann, who, as chairman of the North Rhine-Westphalia branch of the FDP, had led his party back into the state parliament, gaining 9.8% of the vote. This strategy, transferred to the federal level, was dubbed &quot;Project 18&quot;, referring both to the envisioned percentage and the German age of majority. Leading up to the 2002 elections, he positioned his party equidistantly from the major parties and refused to commit his party to a coalition with either the Christian Democrats or the Social Democrats. He was also named the FDP&#x27;s candidate for the office of chancellor. Since the FDP had never claimed such a candidacy (and hasn&#x27;t done since) and had no chance of attaining it against the two major parties, this move was widely seen as political marketing alongside other ploys, such as driving around in a campaign van dubbed the &quot;Guidomobile&quot;, wearing the figure &quot;18&quot; on the soles of his shoes or appearing in the &quot;Big Brother&quot; TV show. Eventually, the federal elections yielded a slight increase of the FDP&#x27;s vote from 6.2% to 7.4%. Despite this setback, he was reelected as party chairman in 2003.

In the federal elections of 2005, Westerwelle was his party&#x27;s front-runner. When neither Chancellor Gerhard Schröder&#x27;s Social Democrats and Greens nor a coalition of Christian and Free Democrats, favored by Angela Merkel and Westerwelle, managed to gain a majority of seats, Westerwelle rejected overtures by Chancellor Schröder to save his chancellorship by entering his coalition, preferring to become one of the leaders of the disparate opposition of the subsequently formed &quot;Grand Coalition&quot; of Christian and Social Democrats, with Merkel as chancellor. Westerwelle became a vocal critic of the new government. In 2006, according to an internal agreement, Westerwelle succeeded Wolfgang Gerhardt as chairman of the parliamentary group.

Over the following years, in an effort to broaden the party&#x27;s appeal, Westerwelle embraced its left wing under former justice minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger and focused his campaign messages on tax cuts, education and civil rights.

==Foreign Minister and Vice-Chancellor of Germany==
In the federal elections of 2009, Westerwelle committed his party to a coalition with Merkel&#x27;s CDU/CSU, ruling out a coalition with Social Democrats and Greens, and led his party to an unprecedented 14.6% share of the vote. In accordance with earlier announcements, he formed a coalition government with the CDU/CSU.

On 28 October, Westerwelle was sworn in as Foreign Minister and Vice-Chancellor, becoming the head of the Foreign Office. His deputies at the Foreign Office were his close political ally Cornelia Pieper and foreign policy expert Werner Hoyer as Ministers of State. Hoyer had previously held the same office in the fifth Kohl cabinet. In a much-discussed move, Westerwelle travelled to Poland, the Netherlands and Belgium before visiting France.

On 19 November 2009, Westerwelle joined around 800 dignitaries from around the world – including US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner and British Foreign Secretary David Miliband – to witness Afghan president Hamid Karzai’s swearing in for a second term in office.

===WikiLeaks controversy and election defeats===
In late November 2010, leaked U.S. diplomatic cables revealed that American diplomats considered Westerwelle an obstacle to deeper transatlantic relations and were sceptical of his abilities, with one cable comparing him unfavorably to former German foreign minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher. On 3 December 2010, Westerwelle dismissed his personal assistant Helmut Metzner following a WikiLeaks diplomatic cables release which led to Metzner admitting that he regularly spied for the U.S. By May 2011, opinion polls ranked Westerwelle as one of the most unpopular and ineffective foreign ministers since the late 1940s. At the time, his party had collapsed in several states, including Rhineland-Palatinate and Bremen where they failed to secure the 5% threshold necessary for a seat in parliament. Analysts said one of the main reasons Westerwelle had become so unpopular was that he had been unable to fulfill the expectations of his voters, the majority of whom were middle-class professionals or entrepreneurs. Westerwelle subsequently stepped down as party leader. By July the party was only receiving 3% support in opinion polls, a record low, reflecting what political insiders had called his &quot;last stand&quot; in January, comparing Westerwelle and his party to Captain Ahab and the &quot;Pequod&quot;.

===International crisis===
During his tenure as foreign minister, Westerwelle prevailed over lawmakers in his party who opposed bailing out Greece during the European debt crisis.

Amid efforts by the United States and European nations to isolate Iran&#x27;s then-president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Westerwelle traveled to Tehran in February 2011 to bring home two journalists for the weekly newspaper &quot;Bild am Sonntag&quot; who were released after being arrested in October 2010. After weeks of negotiations, the Iranians reached out to discuss the release of the pair, the reporter Marcus Hellwig and the photographer Jens Koch. The two reporters had been arrested while interviewing the son of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, a woman sentenced to death for adultery. A condition of their release was that Westerwelle meet with Ahmadinejad, causing Iranian exile groups in Europe to condemn the visit and to argue that Germany was bowing to the Tehran government at a time when security forces were cracking down on pro-democracy demonstrators.

When Iran briefly refused to allow a plane carrying German Chancellor Angela Merkel to India to cross its air space in May 2013, Westerwelle summoned Iran&#x27;s ambassador to Germany, Alireza Sheikhattar, complaining about &quot;a disrespect for Germany that we will not accept.&quot; He later temporarily recalled Germany&#x27;s ambassador to Iran for consultation after an attack on the British Embassy in Tehran in November 2013.

In November 2010, Westerwelle became the first German minister to visit Gaza since the territory was sealed off by the Israeli army at the end of 2007.

In April 2011, Westerwelle summoned China&#x27;s ambassador to Germany, Wu Hongbo, for a meeting about detained Chinese artist-activist Ai Weiwei, calling for his release and denouncing China&#x27;s growing use of extrajudicial detentions against dissidents.

In September 2012, Westerwelle joined his Jordanian counterpart Nasser Judeh in visiting the Zaatari refugee camp to learn more about the plight of Syrians fleeing the violence in the ongoing Syrian civil war that erupted in 2011.

After the offices of both the Konrad Adenauer Foundation in St Petersburg and the Friedrich Ebert Foundation in Moscow were investigated by prosecutors and tax inspectors in March 2013, Westerwelle summoned the envoy at the Russian embassy in Berlin to relay his &quot;concern over the concerted action&quot;.

On 4 December 2013, Westerwelle walked with opposition leaders through an encampment on Kiev&#x27;s Maidan Nezalezhnosti, the focus of protests over the Yanukovych government&#x27;s U-turn away from the European Union and toward Russia; Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev subsequently called any participation by foreign officials in the political events unfolding in Ukraine &quot;interference in internal affairs.&quot;

===Arab Spring===
When the insurgency against Libya&#x27;s dictator Muammar Gaddafi broke out in early 2011, Westerwelle promptly stated his support for the repressed opposition. Earlier, he had initially been cautious before making any pronouncements about Tunisia and Egypt, but in the case of Libya, he quickly called out Gaddafi as a dictator, and argued in favor of EU-level sanctions against the regime in Tripoli. Strongly motivated by a widespread aversion in Germany to the use of military force, he shared with Chancellor Merkel a deep scepticism about a no-fly zone as it was suggested by France and the United Kingdom. At a UN Security Council meeting in March 2011, Westerwelle abstained in the vote on United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 to establish a no-fly zone, along with veto powers Russia and China as well as Brazil and India. Shortly after, he expelled five Libyan diplomats for intimidating Libyan citizens living in Germany. During a visit to Benghazi in June 2011, Westerwelle announced that Germany would recognize the rebel National Transitional Council as the legitimate representative of Libyans.

Amid the Egyptian Revolution of 2011, Westerwelle visited the country six times between February 2011 and November 2012. In December 2011, he summoned Ramzy Ezzeldin Ramzy, the Egyptian ambassador in Berlin, to protest over what he called an &quot;unacceptable&quot; raid on the Cairo office of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation among those searched during a crackdown on pro-democracy and human rights organizations. In February 2012, he harshly criticized Egypt for trying 44 people, including German citizens, over the alleged illegal funding of aid groups. When the Konrad Adenauer Foundation was ordered to close in Abu Dhabi later that year, Westerwelle personally pressed his UAE counterpart Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan to rethink the decision.

===Crisis in Sudan===
In June 2011, Westerwelle became the first German foreign minister to travel to Darfur, where he visited the United Nations/African Union operation UNAMID toward which Germany had contributed military, police and civilian personnel. He was also the first to visit South Sudan shortly before its independence, where he met the country&#x27;s founding President Salva Kiir Mayardit; as the rotating chair of the UN Security Council at the time, Germany was responsible for accepting the newly independent country into the United Nations. During his trip, however, he made no appointment to meet Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir who is wanted by the International Criminal Court on charges of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide allegedly committed in Darfur.

In September 2012, Westerwelle summoned the Sudanese ambassador in Berlin after violent attacks on Germany&#x27;s embassy in Khartoum, and called on the Sudanese government to guarantee the security of the embassy; thousands of protesters had previously vandalized the embassies of Germany and Britain, outraged by &quot;Innocence of Muslims&quot;, a film which has been described as denigrating to the Islamic prophet, Muhammad.

===Role in the United Nations===
During July 2011, Westerwelle was the President of the United Nations Security Council as he headed the German delegation to the United Nations. In an attempt to continue to play an important role within the United Nations, he led the German government&#x27;s successful campaign for a three-year seat on the United Nations Human Rights Council in late 2012.

In October 2013, Israeli daily &quot;Haaretz&quot; published the text of a letter sent by Westerwelle to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying that failure to appear at a periodical hearing regarding human rights at the United Nations Human Rights Council would cause severe diplomatic damage to Israel, and that its allies around the world would be hard-pressed to help it. Shortly after, Israel renewed its cooperation with the Human Rights Council after a year and a half of boycott.

===Nonproliferation===
During his time in office, Westerwelle campaigned for the removal of B61 nuclear bombs at US air bases in Europe, arguing that a planned missile shield protecting Europe against ballistic rocket attack also meant that the tactical nuclear bombs are not needed. Against resistance from France, Westerwelle and German defense minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg demanded greater NATO commitment to nuclear disarmament at a meeting of the organization&#x27;s foreign and defense ministers in October 2010. After the U.S. midterm elections in 2010, Westerwelle called on newly empowered Republicans in the U.S. Congress to stand by President Barack Obama’s goals of non- proliferation and the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons.

In coordination with his foundation and The ATOM Project, Westerwelle continued to advocate for the elimination of nuclear weapons testing.

===Relations with Belarus===
In the belief that the European Union had to engage Belarus to prevent it from moving closer to Russia, Westerwelle – accompanied by his Polish counterpart Radek Sikorski – visited Minsk in November 2010, the first such visit in 15 years. Shortly after, Westerwelle publicly condemned the judgments against President Alexander Lukashenko&#x27;s main political opponent Andrei Sannikov and other opposition supporters. As a consequence, Poland, France and Germany pressed their EU partners in to impose tougher sanctions against the Belarusian leadership following the crackdown and trials of opposition leaders in the country who held peaceful protests against the fraudulent presidential elections.

In March 2012, Lukashenko criticized EU politicians who threatened him with further sanctions over human rights abuses and in an apparent riposte to Westerwelle branding him &quot;Europe&#x27;s last dictator,&quot; said: &quot;Better to be a dictator than gay.&quot; Westerwelle subsequently responded: &quot;This statement condemns itself. I won&#x27;t budge one millimeter from my commitment to human rights and democracy in Belarus after these comments.&quot;

===Relations with Russia===

While being foreign minister, Westerwelle maintained a fairly low profile when it came to Germany&#x27;s Russia-policy. He supported the policy of &quot;change through trade&quot; with Russia, but was widely criticized for not having a clear foreign policy doctrine. He called for more inclusion of Russia in the international community, but criticized Moscow, for example, for supporting President Assad&#x27;s government in Syria.

===Views on WWII and its aftermath===
Upon taking office, Westerwelle opposed the appointment of Erika Steinbach, a German politician and member of Chancellor Merkel&#x27;s party, to a board overseeing the creation of the Center against Expulsions, a place documenting the expulsion of Germans from Eastern Europe after World War II. In November 2010, together with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov, he opened the Nuremberg Trials Memorial permanent exhibition in the Palace of Justice building in Nuremberg.

Under Westerwelle&#x27;s leadership, the Foreign Office released a report in 2011 called &quot;The Ministry and the Past&quot;, which alleged the ministry&#x27;s collusion with the Nazis. Westerwelle said the report &quot;shamed&quot; the institution. In February 2012, he signed an agreement granting 10 million euros (13 million dollars) to Israel&#x27;s Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial Center over the following 10 years.

Following the controversial 2012 Munich artworks discovery, he called for greater transparency in dealing with the find, which he warned could have lasting damage to Germany&#x27;s international friendships.

==Political positions==
===On economic policy===
Westerwelle was a staunch supporter of the free market and proposed reforms to curtail the German welfare state and deregulate German labor-law. In an interview in February 2003, Westerwelle described labor unions as a &quot;plague on our country&quot; and said union officials were &quot;the pall bearers of the welfare state and of the prosperity in our country&quot;. He called for substantial tax cuts and smaller government, in line with the general direction of his party.

===On sexual equality===
Westerwelle was a staunch campaigner for sexual equality. He long criticized German law&#x27;s not giving complete adoption rights to gay couples. In 2012, he and finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble were at loggerheads after a high-court ruling demanded the government provide equal tax treatment to gay civil servants and armed forces members. In the German daily &quot;Bild&quot;, Westerwelle said that if &quot;registered partnerships have the same responsibilities as married couples then they should have the same rights. It is not weakening marriage but ending discrimination. We do not live in the 1950s.&quot;

===On data-protection===
In 2001, Westerwelle was one of the first politicians to push for a biometric passport.
He opposed Google Street View&#x27;s automated photography of streetscapes, and stated &quot;I will do all I can to prevent it&quot;. In 2013, he announced plans to launch an initiative at the United Nations General Assembly to agree an optional protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights that would give greater data protection to internet users.

==Controversy==
Westerwelle&#x27;s party chairmanship saw considerable controversy. Critics inside and outside the FDP accused him of focusing on public relations, as opposed to developing and promoting sound public policy, especially in the election campaign of 2002. Westerwelle himself, who was made party chairman particularly because his predecessor Wolfgang Gerhardt had been viewed by many as dull and stiff, labelled his approach as &quot;Spaßpolitik&quot; (fun-politics).

In 2006, former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder won a court order against Westerwelle who had criticized Schröder for accepting a lucrative job at Gazprom, the Russian state-owned gas company, soon after losing the parliamentary election to Angela Merkel. Despite losing, Westerwelle said he would stick to his original assessment that Schröder&#x27;s appointment as chairman of the North European Gas Pipeline Company was &quot;problematic&quot;.

On 27 September 2009, at a press conference after the election, Westerwelle refused to answer a question in English from a BBC reporter, stating that &quot;it is normal to speak German in Germany&quot;. Critics have noted that this was in part due to Westerwelle&#x27;s poor command of English. He earned the epithet &quot;Westerwave&quot; (a literal translation of his surname into English) as a consequence of these remarks.

Westerwelle made public statements in 2010 about the &quot;welfare state&quot;, saying that promising the people effortless prosperity may lead to &quot;late Roman decadence&quot;, in reference to a verdict in the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany regarding Hartz IV.

In 2010, Westerwelle announced he would not be taking his civil partner Michael Mronz to anti-gay countries. Other official trips as foreign minister included Mronz, an event manager, and Ralf Marohn, a partner in his brother&#x27;s company, also causing controversy. Westerwelle retorted that it was normal for foreign ministers to take industry representatives on their trips, calling himself a victim of &quot;a left-wing &quot;zeitgeist&quot; that considers making business questionable&quot;.

According to Politico Europe Westerwelle contributed to the decline of the power of the German foreign ministry due to his lack of expertise in the area and was considered ineffective in the role.

==Personal life==

On 20 July 2004, Westerwelle attended Angela Merkel&#x27;s 50th birthday party accompanied by his partner, Michael Mronz. It was the first time he had attended an official event with his partner and this was considered his public coming-out. The couple registered their partnership on 17 September 2010 in a private ceremony in Bonn.

==Death==

On 20 June 2014, it was reported that Westerwelle was suffering from acute myeloid leukemia. He underwent chemotherapy and a bone-marrow transplant. He last appeared in public in November 2015, presenting a book on his battle with blood cancer called &quot;Between Two Lives&quot;. Westerwelle died of the disease in Cologne on 18 March 2016, at the age of 54.

<text>Gabriele &quot;Gabi&quot; Zimmer (born 7 May 1955) is a German politician who served as leader of the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) from 2000 to 2003. After leaving office as leader, she was a member of the European Parliament from 2004 to 2019. Zimmer sat with the European United Left–Nordic Green Left (GUE/NGL) group, which she chaired from 2012 to 2019.

== Personal life ==
Zimmer was born in East Berlin in 1955. After graduating from high school, she studied Russian and French in the Theoretical and Applied Linguistics section of the Karl Marx University in Leipzig from 1973 to 1977, graduating as a qualified linguist. Then she worked as a clerk at VEB vehicle and hunting weapons factory &quot;Ernst Thälmann&quot; in Suhl. From 1981 to 1987 she was the editor of the company&#x27;s newspaper, and from 1987 to 1989 she was a member of the SED party leadership of this company.

Zimmer is non-denominational, married, and has two children.

== Political career ==
She joined the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), the ruling party of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), in 1981. After its transformation into the Party of Democratic Socialism in 1990, she became the party&#x27;s leader in the new state of Thuringia, a position she held until 1998. She was a member of the Landtag of Thuringia from 1990 until 2004.

Zimmer became federal deputy leader of PDS in 1996. She was elected federal leader in 2000 after the resignation of Lothar Bisky. The party suffered a major defeat in the 2002 federal election, failing to pass the 5% electoral threshold and returning only two representatives. Zimmer was re-elected as leader at the first party congress after the election, but after internal party disputes, announced she would step down and not seek re-election at an extraordinary party congress in 2003. She left the leadership in May of that year.

Zimmer remained active in the party, and was elected to the European Parliament in 2004. In 2007, the PDS merged into The Left. Zimmer was re-elected as an MEP representing The Left in 2009 and 2014. In 2012, she became the chairwoman of the GUE/NGL group in the European Parliament. She did not seek re-election in the 2019 European Parliament election.

<text>Daniel Ray Coats (born May 16, 1943) is an American politician, attorney, and diplomat. From 2017 to 2019, he served as the Director of National Intelligence in the Trump administration. A member of the Republican Party, he served as a United States Senator from Indiana from 1989 to 1999 and again from 2011 to 2017. He was the United States Ambassador to Germany from 2001 to 2005, and a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1981 to 1989. Coats served on the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence while in the U.S. Senate.

Born in Jackson, Michigan, Coats graduated from Wheaton College in Illinois and the Indiana University School of Law – Indianapolis. He served in the U.S. Army from 1966 to 1968. Coats represented Indiana&#x27;s 4th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives from 1981 to 1989. He was appointed to fill the Senate seat vacated by Dan Quayle following Quayle&#x27;s election as Vice President of the United States. Coats won the 1990 special election to serve the remainder of Quayle&#x27;s unexpired term, as well as the 1992 election for a full six-year term. He did not seek reelection in 1998 and was succeeded by Democrat Evan Bayh.

After retiring from the Senate, Coats served as U.S. ambassador to Germany from 2001 to 2005 and then worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C. He was reelected to the Senate by a large margin in 2010, succeeding Bayh, who announced his own retirement shortly after Coats declared his candidacy. Coats declined to run for reelection in 2016 and was succeeded by Todd Young. He was nominated as Director of National Intelligence in January 2017, succeeding James R. Clapper. His term in office commenced on March 16, 2017, and ended on August 15, 2019.

==Early life and education==
Coats was born in Jackson, Michigan, the son of Vera (Nora) Elisabeth (née Swanlund) and Edward Raymond Coats. His father was of English and German descent, and his maternal grandparents emigrated from Sweden. Coats attended local public schools, and graduated from Jackson High School in 1961. He then studied at Wheaton College in Wheaton, Illinois, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 1965. At Wheaton, he was an active student athlete on the soccer team. Following his military service, Coats enrolled at the Indiana University School of Law – Indianapolis (now Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law). Serving as associate editor of the &quot;Indiana Law Review&quot;, Coats completed his Juris Doctor in 1972.

== Career ==
Coats served in the United States Army Corps of Engineers from 1966 to 1968. He also served as assistant vice president of a Fort Wayne life insurance company.

===Political staffer in Washington (1976–1980)===
From 1976 to 1980, Coats worked for then-Congressman Dan Quayle, a Republican from Indiana&#x27;s 4th congressional district, as Quayle&#x27;s district representative.

=== U.S. House of Representatives (1981–1988)===

When Quayle decided to challenge three-term Democratic incumbent Birch Bayh in the 1980 U.S. Senate election, Coats ran for and won Quayle&#x27;s seat in the U.S. House. He was reelected four times from this Fort Wayne-based district, usually without serious difficulty.

=== U.S. Senate (1988–1998)===
When Quayle resigned from the Senate after being elected Vice President of the United States in 1988, Coats, who had just been elected to a fifth term in the House, was appointed to Quayle&#x27;s former seat. He subsequently won a special election in 1990 for the balance of Quayle&#x27;s second term, and was elected to a full term in 1992. Coats declined to run for a second full term in 1998. He served in the Senate until January 1999, at which time he was succeeded by Evan Bayh.

=== Counselor (1998–2001) ===
Coats worked as special counsel member in the firm Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson and Hand in 2000 and 2001. In 2001, Coats was reportedly one of George W. Bush&#x27;s top choices to be secretary of defense, a job eventually given to Donald Rumsfeld who had previously held the post under President Gerald Ford.

===US Ambassador to Germany (2001–2005)===

From August 15, 2001, to February 28, 2005, Coats was George W. Bush&#x27;s ambassador to Germany. As ambassador during the lead-up to the Iraq War, he unsuccessfully pressured the Government of Germany led by Chancellor Gerhard Schröder not to oppose the war, threatening worsened U.S. relations with Germany. As Ambassador he also played a critical role in establishing robust relations with then opposition leader Angela Merkel, who approved the Iraq war, and in the construction of a new United States Embassy in the heart of Berlin next to the Brandenburg Gate.

===Again in private life (2005–2010)===
Coats served as co-chairman of the Washington government relations office of King &amp; Spalding.

In 2005, Coats drew attention when he was chosen by President George W. Bush to shepherd Harriet Miers&#x27;s failed nomination to the Supreme Court through the Senate. Echoing Senator Roman Hruska&#x27;s famous 1970 speech in defense of Harrold Carswell, Coats said to CNN regarding the nomination: &quot;If [being a] great intellectual powerhouse is a qualification to be a member of the court and represent the American people and the wishes of the American people and to interpret the Constitution, then I think we have a court so skewed on the intellectual side that we may not be getting representation of America as a whole.&quot;

In 2007, Coats served as co-chairman of a team of lobbyists for Cooper Industries, a Texas corporation that moved its principal place of business to Bermuda, where it would not be liable for U.S. taxes. In that role, he worked to block Senate legislation that would have closed a tax loophole, worth hundreds of millions of dollars to Cooper Industries.

===U.S. Senate (2011–2016)===
Coats announced on February 3, 2010, he would run for his old Senate seat; and on February 16, 2010, Bayh announced his intention to retire. Coats went on to win the seat. In March 2015, he announced that he would not run for reelection in 2016. He served on the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.

On February 10, 2010, Coats confirmed that he would return to Indiana to run for the seat held by incumbent Evan Bayh in the 2010 United States Senate election. Bayh had made no previous announcements and was fully expected to run for another term, but after Coats announced his candidacy, Bayh announced his retirement on February 15, 2010. On May 4, 2010, Coats won the Republican primary over State Senator Marlin Stutzman and former U.S. Representative John Hostettler.

Coats defeated Democratic U.S. Representative Brad Ellsworth by a 15-point margin to return to the Senate.

Coats became the senior senator from Indiana after Richard Lugar lost a challenge in the 2012 Republican primary election and subsequently was not re-elected to the Senate in 2012. Coats served the remainder of his term with Democrat Joe Donnelly.

=== Director of National Intelligence (2017–2019)===

On January 5, 2017, Coats was announced as then-President-elect Donald Trump&#x27;s nominee for the Cabinet-level position of Director of National Intelligence, to succeed the outgoing James R. Clapper. His confirmation hearing was held on February 28, 2017, by the United States Senate Intelligence Committee, which approved his nomination on March 9, 2017, with a 13–2 vote. The Senate confirmed his nomination with an 85–12 vote on March 15, 2017, and he was sworn into office on March 16, 2017.

On July 16, 2018, Coats released a statement affirming the consensus of the United States Intelligence Community (IC) that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, a day after the 2018 Russia–United States summit where President Trump recanted his endorsement of the IC&#x27;s assessment.

On September 6, 2018, Director Coats denied that he had authored the anonymous op-ed piece from a senior Trump Administration official that criticized the President which had been published by &quot;The New York Times&quot; the day prior. The day before, MSNBC host Lawrence O&#x27;Donnell speculated that Coats was the author of the guest essay, which was later revealed to have been written by then-United States Department of Homeland Security Chief of Staff Miles Taylor.
Coats released the DNI&#x27;s &quot;Worldwide Threat Assessment of the US Intelligence Community&quot; on January 29, 2019, listing the major threats to the United States. The reports states that the &quot;international system is coming under increasing strain amid continuing cyber and WMD proliferation threats, competition in space, and regional conflicts. Among the disturbing trends are hostile states and actors&#x27; intensifying online efforts to influence and interfere with elections here and abroad and their use of chemical weapons. Terrorism too will continue to be a top threat to US and partner interests worldwide, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. The development and application of new technologies will introduce both risks and opportunities, and the US economy will be challenged by slower global economic growth and growing threats to U.S. economic competitiveness.&quot; In the report, Coats also highlighted the potential negative impacts to US national security as a result of climate change, with this statement: &quot;The United States will probably have to manage the impact of global human security challenges, such as threats to public health, historic levels of human displacement, assaults on religious freedom, and the
negative effects of environmental degradation and climate change.&quot;
Reporting to Congress in January 2019, the subject advised that Russia acting in concert with their allies will use novel strategies that build on their previous experience in election meddling. In July 2019, Coats appointed an election security &quot;czar,&quot; Shelby Pierson, to oversee efforts across intelligence agencies. She is the first to have that role. Coats also directed other intelligence agencies to appoint executives to coordinate election security.

During his tenure Coats sometimes took public positions that conflicted with Trump&#x27;s statements or actions. Areas of disagreement included Russia, and particularly Russia&#x27;s interference in the 2016 election, as well as North Korea and Iran. On July 28, 2019, following multiple anonymous reports that he was about to be let go, Trump announced on Twitter that Coats would depart on August 15 and that he would nominate U.S. Representative John Ratcliffe (R-Texas) to replace him as Director of National Intelligence.

Later, it was revealed that Trump had spoken by phone to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on July 25, three days before Trump fired Coats. (Trump was impeached for pressuring Ukraine.) When the Ukraine scandal came to light, some speculated that Coats&#x27;s firing had been related to the Ukraine phone call.

== Political positions ==

===Gun laws===
On multiple occasions, Coats has supported gun control measures. In 1991, he voted in favor of the Biden-Thurmond Violent Crime Control Act. This act, which did not become law, would have created a waiting period for handgun purchases and placed a ban on assault weapons. Subsequently, he supported the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act that President Clinton signed into law in 1993. The legislation imposed a waiting period before a handgun could be transferred to an individual by a licensed dealer, importer, or manufacturer. This waiting period ended when the computerized instant check system came online. Coats also supported Feinstein Amendment 1152 to the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1993. The purpose of the Feinstein Amendment was to &quot;restrict the manufacture, transfer, and possession of certain semiautomatic assault weapons and large capacity ammunition feeding devices&quot;.
In April 2013, Coats was one of forty-six senators to vote against passage of a bill which would have expanded background checks for gun buyers. Coats voted with 40 Republicans and five Democrats to stop the passage of the bill.

===Taxes===
In 1995, Coats introduced S. 568: Family, Investment, Retirement, Savings, and Tax Fairness Act which would provide &quot;family tax credits, increase national savings through individual retirement plus accounts, indexing for inflation the income thresholds for taxing social security benefits, etc&quot;. The bill did not become law.

===LGBT issues===
In 1993, Coats emerged as an opponent of President Clinton&#x27;s effort to allow LGBT individuals to serve openly in the armed forces. Coats was one of the authors of the Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell policy and opposed its 2011 repeal. He does not support same-sex marriage but opposes interference with &quot;alternative lifestyles&quot;.

===Russia and Ukraine===
Coats pressed President Barack Obama to punish Russia harshly for its March 2014 annexation of Crimea. For this stance, the Russian government banned Coats and several other U.S. lawmakers from traveling to Russia.

In January 2019, Coats warned against the alliance between Russia and China.

===Iran and Iraq===

Coats supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq on the grounds of uncovering what he believed to be 
Iraq&#x27;s weapons of mass destruction.

Coats opposed the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers – the U.S., U.K., Russia, France, China, and Germany. He described Iran as the foremost &quot;state sponsor of terrorism&quot;.

During testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee in January 2019, Coats said that Iran &quot;continues to sponsor terrorism&quot;. According to Coats, &quot;Iran&#x27;s regional ambitions and improved military capabilities almost certainly will threaten US interests in the coming year.&quot;

===Palestine===
Coats co-sponsored the Taylor Force Act. The legislation proposes to stop American economic aid to the Palestinian Authority unless it stops payments to individuals who commit acts of terrorism and to the families of deceased terrorists.

In September 2016, in advance of a UN Security Council resolution 2334 condemning Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories, Coats signed an AIPAC-sponsored letter urging President Barack Obama to veto &quot;one-sided&quot; resolutions against Israel.

===Other===

Coats co-sponsored, with former senators Edward M. Kennedy, Christopher Dodd, and Jim Jeffords, S.2206: Coats Human Services Reauthorization Act of 1998. This bill, which was enacted into law, &quot;amended the Head Start Act, the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981, and the Community Services Block Grant Act... in order to provide an opportunity for persons with limited means to accumulate assets.&quot;

In 1996, Coats co-sponsored the Line Item Veto Act of 1996, which President Clinton signed into law. The bill allowed the President to &quot;rewrit[e] legislation by vetoing single items of spending or specific tax breaks approved by Congress.&quot; In June 1998, The Supreme Court of the United States declared the law unconstitutional in &quot;Clinton v. City of New York&quot; in a 6–3 decision.

Coats made headlines in August 1998, when he publicly questioned the timing of President Bill Clinton&#x27;s cruise missile attacks on Afghanistan and Sudan, suggesting they might be linked to the Lewinsky scandal: &quot;While there is clearly much more we need to learn about this attack and why it was ordered today, given the president&#x27;s personal difficulties this week, it is legitimate to question the timing of this action.&quot;

==Political campaigns==












==Personal life==
He is married to Marsha Coats, Indiana&#x27;s woman representative to the Republican National Committee.

He received the Big Brothers Big Sisters of America&#x27;s Charles G. Berwind Lifetime Achievement Award in 2012.

In 2015, Coats received the Benjamin Harrison Presidential Site Advancing American Democracy Award.

Coats is described as a &quot;die-hard Chicago Cubs fan&quot;. He and Marsha Coats went to a Cubs game the day after their wedding.

<text>Wolfgang Friedrich Ischinger (born April 6, 1946) is a German diplomat who served as chairman of the Munich Security Conference from 2008 to 2022.

From 2001 to 2006, Ischinger was the German ambassador to the United States, and from 1998 to 2001, he was Staatssekretär (Deputy Foreign Minister) in Berlin. He was Germany&#x27;s ambassador to the Court of St. James&#x27;s (the United Kingdom) from 2006 to May, 2008. He was also Global Head of Government Relations of Allianz SE from March 2008 until December 2014. He serves on the supervisory board of Allianz Deutschland AG, on the European Advisory Board of Investcorp (London/New York) and on the governing board of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. He has been described as &quot;Germany&#x27;s best-connected former diplomat&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Ischinger was born in Beuren, Baden-Württemberg, near Stuttgart, Germany. In 1963–64, he was an American Field Service foreign exchange student in Watseka, Illinois, where he graduated from the local high school in June 1964. After German Abitur, Ischinger studied law at the University of Bonn, Germany and the University of Geneva, Switzerland and obtained his law degree in 1972. He earned a master&#x27;s degree from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy in Medford, Massachusetts, in 1973.

==Career==
From 1973 to 1975, Ischinger served on the staff of the Secretary General of the United Nations in New York. He joined the German Foreign Service in 1975, and has served in Washington, D.C., Paris, and in a number of senior functions in the German Foreign Office. In 1982, he became personal assistant to Hans-Dietrich Genscher, West German foreign minister and leader of the Free Democratic Party.

From 1993 to 1995, Ischinger was director of the Policy Planning Staff under Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel; from 1995 to 1998, as director general for political affairs (political director), Ischinger participated in a number of international negotiating processes, including the Bosnia Peace Talks at Dayton, Ohio, the negotiations concerning the NATO-Russia Founding Act, as well as the negotiations on EU and NATO enlargement and on the Kosovo crisis.

As Staatssekretär (deputy foreign minister) under Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer between 1998 and 2001, Ischinger represented Germany at numerous international and European conferences, including the 1999 G8 and EU summit meetings in Cologne/Germany and the 2000 Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) at the United Nations in New York.

In 2007, Ischinger was the European Union Representative in the Troika negotiations on the future of Kosovo, which ended up leading to the declaration of independence of Kosovo and the recognition of Kosovo by most EU member countries, the United States, and a number of other countries, in February 2008. Reportedly, Ischinger entered the talks &quot;with only one goal and idea: for Kosovo to become independent in the end, with the Serbian authority&#x27;s willing consent&quot;.

From 2019 until 2020, Ischinger co-chaired the Transatlantic Task Force of the German Marshall Fund and the Bundeskanzler-Helmut-Schmidt-Stiftung (BKHS), alongside Karen Donfried.

Ischinger has published widely on foreign policy, security, and arms control policy as well as on European and issues.

<text>The vice-chancellor of Germany, officially the deputy to the Federal Chancellor (), is the second highest ranking German cabinet member. The chancellor is the head of government and, according to the constitution, gives this title of deputy to one of the federal ministers. It is custom that the title is given to a minister of the largest coalition partner, since 1966 typically the foreign minister. Since 2011, the minister for economic affairs has held the title most often.

In everyday politics, being vice-chancellor is considered more of an honorary title. The vice-chancellor may head cabinet meetings when the chancellor is not absent. The function of vice-chancellor is to use the specific constitutional powers of the chancellor in case that the chancellor is unable to perform their duties. This kind of substitution has never been made use of in the history of the Federal Republic. Should a chancellor resign, die or be permanently unable to perform the duties of office, the vice-chancellor does not automatically become the next chancellor. In such a case the Federal President assigns a minister to serve as acting chancellor until the Bundestag (parliament) elects a new chancellor.).

Although is the constitutional term, vice-chancellor () is used more commonly. &quot;Chancellor&quot; () is the traditional term for the German head of government since 1867/71. A general deputy was introduced by law in 1878 (). In the Weimar Republic of 1919–1933, the office of was mentioned in the internal reglement of the government. The current title has existed since the constitution of 1949.

Robert Habeck (Greens) is the current officeholder since 8 December 2021.

== History ==

Such an office was initially established by the 1878 (Deputation Act), which provided for the imperial chancellor appointing a deputy, officially known as (General Deputy to the Imperial Chancellor). In addition to the general deputy, who could sign for all the affairs of the chancellor, the chancellor could appoint deputies with limited responsibilities. The act was revised on 28 October 1918, when the possibility of appointing deputies with limited responsibilities was removed and the vice-chancellor was given the right to appear before parliament.

In the Weimar Republic, the office was considered less important. It was not even mentioned in the constitution. Usually it was held by the minister of justice or the interior. The most known office holder is Franz von Papen, a former chancellor who formed a coalition government of national socialists and conservatives. Adolf Hitler became chancellor, and Papen vice-chancellor. It became soon obvious that the position of vice-chancellor provided no powers and was unsuited to constrain Hitler. Papen was convinced that him being trusted by president Hindenburg made him an important political player; soon, Hindenburg&#x27;s trust went from Papen to Hitler.

In the Federal Republic (since 1949), the chancellors have had no interest in allowing the deputy to use the title for self-promotion. Since 1966 it became customary that the coalition partner of the governing party received the ministry of foreign affairs, who was also appointed deputy. The ministry of foreign affairs was considered to be the most important cabinet post besides the chancellorship. This tradition faded away during the tenure of Angela Merkel, partially because the leaders of her coalition partners chose a different ministry.

== Office and appointment mechanism ==
The German cabinet consists of the chancellor and the federal ministers. According to the Basic Law (Article 69.1), the chancellor appoints one of the ministers as vice-chancellor. In contrast to the appointment of a cabinet minister, there is no need for a formal appointment by the president. The appointment is an exclusive power of the chancellor.

The chancellor is theoretically free to choose a deputy chancellor. In practice, a German government is usually based on a coalition of two or more parties and the chancellor gives the title to a minister of the second largest coalition party upon recommendation of that party&#x27;s leadership.

The German vice-chancellor can be regarded as the equivalent of a deputy prime minister in other parliamentary systems. Unlike the vice president post in presidential systems of governments, the German vice-chancellor is not the automatic successor in the event that a sitting chancellor suddenly leaves office.

A German cabinet exists only as long as the current chancellor is in office. The end of a chancellor&#x27;s term in office (either by death or resignation or the first meeting of a newly elected Bundestag) automatically terminates the office of any minister. If this happens, the president of Germany appoints the former chancellor or, if this is not possible, one of the former cabinet ministers (not necessarily, but most likely the former vice-chancellor) as acting chancellor, until the parliament elects a new chancellor. When in 1974 Chancellor Willy Brandt resigned and refused to remain in office until his successor&#x27;s election, President Gustav Heinemann ensured a corresponding precedent and appointed former vice-chancellor Walter Scheel as acting chancellor.

The Basic Law does not state who shall perform the chancellor&#x27;s powers and duties, if both the chancellor and the vice-chancellor are unable to do so. The German cabinet&#x27;s rules of procedure state that in absence of both office-holders cabinet meetings shall be chaired by a cabinet member designated for this purpose by either the chancellor or the vice-chancellor or, if such a designation has not taken place or if the designee is not able to do so, by the present cabinet member with the longest uninterrupted membership in the federal government (§22.1). It is however unclear, whether this provision extends to other powers of the office of chancellor. In an expertise issued by the Bundestag&#x27;s scientific service in 2014, the legal opinion is that this is the case.

<text>The Rhine Falls ( , a singular noun) is a waterfall located in Switzerland and the most powerful waterfall in Europe. The falls are located on the High Rhine on the border between the cantons of Schaffhausen (SH) and Zürich (ZH), between the municipalities of Neuhausen am Rheinfall (SH) and Laufen-Uhwiesen/Dachsen (ZH), next to the town of Schaffhausen in northern Switzerland.

The falls are wide and high. In the winter months, the average water flow is , while in the summer, the average water flow is . The highest flow ever measured was in 1965, and the lowest, in 1921.

==Geology==
The Rhine Falls were formed in the last ice age, approximately 14,000 to 17,000 years ago, by erosion-resistant rocks narrowing the riverbed. The first glacial advances created today&#x27;s landforms approximately 500,000 years ago. Up to the end of the Wolstonian Stage approximately 132,000 years ago, the Rhine flowed westwards from Schaffhausen past Klettgau. This earlier riverbed later filled up with gravel.

About 132,000 years ago the course of the river changed southwards at Schaffhausen and formed a new channel, which also filled up with gravel. Part of the Rhine today includes this ancient riverbed.

During the Würm glaciation, the Rhine was pushed far to the south to its present course, over a hard Late Jurassic limestone bed. As the river flowed over both the hard limestone and the easily eroded gravel from previous glaciations, formed the waterfall. The Rheinfallfelsen, a large rock, is the remnant of the original limestone cliff flanking the former channel. The rock has eroded very little over the years because relatively little sediment comes down the Rhine from Lake Constance.

The formation of the Rhine Falls is shown in a permanent exhibition at the Museum zu Allerheiligen in Schaffhausen.
==Economics==
The north side of the falls is a millsite. In the 17th century, a blast furnace for smelting iron ore found in the limestone was built. It was in operation until the first half of the 19th century.

In 1887 the ironworks applied for permission to divert between one fifth to one half of the river&#x27;s flow for electricity generation. The Swiss Alpine Club, the Schweizerische Naturforschende Gesellschaft (a nature group) and several scientific societies opposed the plan.

In 1913 an international competition was held for the best plan for a shipping route between Basel and Lake Constance.

In 1919, a company wanting to build power stations in northern Switzerland were told that any such station at the Rhine Falls &quot;must serve the economic interest of the public&quot;.

In 1944, the Swiss Council of States granted permission to build the proposed power station. The permission was to become effective on 1 February 1948, with construction to begin in 1952. But in 1951, the Neue Helvetische Gesellschaft (New Swiss Society), under the leadership of Emil Egli, got 150,000 Swiss citizens to sign a petition protesting the project; among the signatories were 49 famous citizens, including Hermann Hesse and Carl Jacob Burckhardt. The petition not only scuttled the power station project, but effectively prevented all future hydropower and navigation engineering projects on the upper Rhine to the present day.

Today, the falls are still under consideration for hydropower projects. If the full water flow were used, the power generated would average approximately 50 MW. The economic value of the falls as a tourist attraction may be greater.

==Tourism==
The nearest communities are Neuhausen am Rheinfall just north of the Rhine Falls, where tourists can also view the Wörth Castle (Swiss German: &quot;Schlössli Wörth&quot;), and Laufen-Uhwiesen, with the Laufen Castle (German: &quot;Schloss Laufen&quot;) overlooking the waterfall. Access to the other side of the river is possible through boat services or via a sidewalk on the railway bridge (&quot;Rheinfallbrücke&quot;) upstream of the waterfall.

Aside from boat tours to the Rhine Falls&#x27; rock (&quot;Rheinfallfelsen&quot;), there are also viewing platforms with views on the waterfall built on both sides of the Rhine River. These are reached via steep and narrow stairs (access by fee on the &quot;Schloss Laufen&quot; side). Elevators exist in some places. Guided tours of various lengths start from Laufen Castle on the Zürich side of the falls – a youth hostel is also located in &quot;Schloss Laufen&quot;. Various restaurants are located in &quot;Schloss Laufen&quot;, &quot;Schlössli Wörth&quot; and the &quot;Rheinfall&quot; park.

== Transport ==


Public transport in Switzerland is famous for its density and its coordination between services (trains, busses and boats) due to the clock-face schedule. There are several train stations near the Rhine Falls. The closest ones, within walking distance, are on the northern side of the falls and on the southern banks of the river. Both stations are serviced by S-Bahn trains only. The town of Neuhausen has two additional S-Bahn railway stations, and Neuhausen Badischer Bahnhof (Neuhausen Bad Bf), which are further away from the Rhine Falls. , the largest railway station in the area, is even farther away (ca. ), but can be reached by frequent bus services operated by Verkehrsbetriebe Schaffhausen (vbsh) and PostAuto. The closest bus stops in walking distance to the waterfall are &quot;Neuhausen Zentrum&quot; (Neuhausen Central) and &quot;Schloss Laufen, Rheinfall&quot;.

There are no boat lines between the Rhine Falls and Schaffhausen (or any other town along the Rhine River), but from April to October there are regular boat services along the scenic High Rhine (&quot;Hochrhein&quot;) between Schaffhausen (&quot;Schifflände&quot;) and Kreuzlingen (Lake Constance), operated by the Schweizerische Schifffahrtsgesellschaft Untersee und Rhein (URh). Frequent bus services (vbsh lines , , ) operate between &quot;Schifflände&quot; and Schaffhausen railway station.

=== Private transport ===
The Rhine Falls are easily accessible by car, coach, or bicycle. Large pay-parking lots are located on both sides of the Rhine Falls. The nearest exits on the A4 motorway are &quot;Uhwiesen&quot;, &quot;Flurlingen&quot; or &quot;Schaffhausen Süd&quot;.

== History ==
Tourists have been awed by the Rhine Falls for centuries. In the 19th century, the painter J. M. W. Turner made several studies and larger paintings of the falls, and the lyrical poet Eduard Mörike wrote of the falls:
:&quot;Halte dein Herz, o Wanderer, fest in gewaltigen Händen!&quot;
:&quot; Mir entstürzte vor Lust zitternd das meinige fast.&quot;
:&quot;Rastlos donnernde Massen auf donnernde Massen geworfen,&quot;
:&quot; Ohr und Auge, wohin retten sie sich im Tumult?&quot;

:(Hold your heart, oh traveller, tightly in mighty hands!
:Mine nearly collapsed, shivering with pleasure.
:Restlessly thundering masses thrown upon thundering masses,
:Ear and eye, whither can they save themselves in such an uproar?)

In 1840, author Mary Shelley visited the Falls while on a tour of Europe with her son. She described her visit in a travel narrative that she published in 1844, &quot;Rambles in Germany and Italy&quot;. She says: &quot;A portion of the cataract arches over the lowest platform, and the spray fell thickly on us, as standing on it and looking up, we saw wave, and rock, and cloud, and the clear heavens through its glittering ever-moving veil. This was a new sight, exceeding anything I had ever before seen; however, not to be wet through, I was obliged quickly to tear myself away.&quot;

<doc id="72697" wikidata="Q367508" url="?curid=72697" title="Eric Dolphy">
<text>Eric Allan Dolphy Jr. (June 20, 1928 – June 29, 1964) was an American jazz multi-instrumentalist, composer, and bandleader. Primarily an alto saxophonist, bass clarinetist, and flautist, Dolphy was one of several multi-instrumentalists to gain prominence during the same era. His use of the bass clarinet helped to establish the unconventional instrument within jazz. Dolphy extended the vocabulary and boundaries of the alto saxophone, and was among the earliest significant jazz flute soloists.

His improvisational style was characterized by the use of wide intervals, in addition to employing an array of extended techniques to emulate the sounds of human voices and animals. He used melodic lines that were &quot;angular, zigzagging from interval to interval, taking hairpin turns at unexpected junctures, making dramatic leaps from the lower to the upper register.&quot; Although Dolphy&#x27;s work is sometimes classified as free jazz, his compositions and solos were often rooted in conventional (if highly abstracted) tonal bebop harmony.

==Early life, family and education==
Eric Dolphy was born and raised in Los Angeles, California. His parents were Sadie and Eric Dolphy, Sr., who immigrated to the United States from Panama. He began music lessons at the age of six, studying clarinet and saxophone privately. While still in junior high, he began to study the oboe, aspiring to a professional symphonic career, and received a two-year scholarship to study at the music school of the University of Southern California. When aged 13, he received a &quot;Superior&quot; award on clarinet from the California School Band and Orchestra festival. He attended Dorsey High School, where he continued his musical studies and learned additional instruments. By 1946, he was co-director of the Youth Choir at the Westminster Presbyterian Church run by Reverend Hampton B. Hawes, father of the jazz pianist of the same name. He graduated in 1947, then attended Los Angeles City College, during which time he played contemporary classical works such as Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Histoire du soldat&quot; and, along with Jimmy Knepper and Art Farmer, performed with Roy Porter&#x27;s &quot;17 Beboppers&quot;. He went on to make eight recordings with Porter by 1949. On these early sessions, Dolphy occasionally played baritone saxophone, as well as alto saxophone, flute, and soprano clarinet.

Dolphy entered the U.S. Army in 1950 and was stationed at Fort Lewis, Washington. Beginning in 1952, he attended the Navy School of Music. Following his discharge in 1953, he returned to L.A., where he worked with many musicians, including Buddy Collette, Eddie Beal, and Gerald Wilson, to whom he later dedicated the tune &quot;G.W.&quot;, recorded on &quot;Outward Bound&quot;. Dolphy often had friends come by to jam, enabled by the fact that his father had built a studio for him in the family&#x27;s backyard. Recordings made in 1954 with Clifford Brown document this early period.

==Career==
Dolphy had his big break when he was invited to join Chico Hamilton&#x27;s quintet in 1958. With the group he became known to a wider audience and was able to tour extensively through 1958–59, when he left Hamilton&#x27;s group and moved to New York City. Dolphy appears on flute with Hamilton&#x27;s band in the film &quot;Jazz on a Summer&#x27;s Day&quot;, documenting a performance at the 1958 Newport Jazz Festival.

===Partnerships===
====Charles Mingus====
Charles Mingus had known Dolphy from growing up in Los Angeles, and the younger man joined Mingus&#x27; Jazz Workshop in 1960, shortly after arriving in New York. He took part in Mingus&#x27; big band recording &quot;Pre-Bird&quot; (sometimes re-released as &quot;Mingus Revisited&quot;), and is featured on &quot;Bemoanable Lady&quot;. Later he joined Mingus&#x27; working band at the Showplace during 1960 (memorialized in the poem &quot;Mingus at the Showplace&quot; by William Matthews), and appeared on the leader&#x27;s two Candid label albums, &quot;Charles Mingus Presents Charles Mingus&quot; and &quot;Mingus&quot;. Dolphy, Mingus said, &quot;was a complete musician. He could fit anywhere. He was a fine lead alto in a big band. He could make it in a classical group. And, of course, he was entirely his own man when he soloed... He had mastered jazz. And he had mastered all the instruments he played. In fact, he knew more than was supposed to be possible to do on them.&quot; In the same year, Dolphy took part in the Mingus led Jazz Artist Guild project and its Newport Rebels recording session. 

Touring in Europe with Mingus in 1961, Dolphy continued on to perform as a solo artist, and he was recorded in Scandinavia and Berlin. (See &quot;The Berlin Concerts&quot;, &quot;The Complete Uppsala Concert&quot;, &quot;Eric Dolphy in Europe&quot; Volumes 1, 2, and 3 (1 and 3 were also released as &quot;Copenhagen Concert&quot;), and &quot;Stockholm Sessions&quot;.) He was later among the musicians who worked on &quot;Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus&quot; in 1963, and is featured on &quot;Hora Decubitus&quot;.

In early 1964, Dolphy returned to Mingus&#x27; working band, now including Jaki Byard, Johnny Coles, and Clifford Jordan. This sextet worked at the Five Spot before playing at Cornell University and Town Hall in New York (both were recorded: &quot;Cornell 1964&quot; and &quot;Town Hall Concert&quot;) and subsequently touring Europe. The short tour is well-documented on &quot;Revenge!&quot;, &quot;The Great Concert of Charles Mingus&quot;, &quot;Mingus in Europe Volume I&quot;, and &quot;Mingus in Europe Volume II&quot;.

====John Coltrane====
Dolphy and John Coltrane knew each other long before they formally played together, having met when Coltrane was in Los Angeles with Johnny Hodges in 1954. They would often exchange ideas and learn from each other, and eventually, after many nights sitting in with Coltrane&#x27;s band, Dolphy was asked to become a full member in early 1961. Coltrane had gained an audience and critical notice with Miles Davis&#x27;s quintet, but alienated some leading jazz critics when he began to move away from hard bop. Although Coltrane&#x27;s quintets with Dolphy (including the &quot;Village Vanguard&quot; and &quot;Africa/Brass&quot; sessions) are now accepted, they originally provoked &quot;DownBeat&quot; magazine to brand Coltrane and Dolphy&#x27;s music as &#x27;anti-jazz&#x27;. Coltrane later said of this criticism: &quot;they made it appear that we didn&#x27;t even know the first thing about music (...) it hurt me to see [Dolphy] get hurt in this thing.&quot;

The initial release of Coltrane&#x27;s residency at the Vanguard selected three tracks, only one of which featured Dolphy. After being issued haphazardly over the next 30 years, a comprehensive box-set featuring the music recorded at the Vanguard was released on &quot;Impulse!&quot; in 1997, called &quot;The Complete 1961 Village Vanguard Recordings&quot;. The set features Dolphy heavily on both alto saxophone and bass clarinet, with Dolphy the featured soloist on their renditions of &quot;Naima&quot;. A 2001 Pablo box set, drawing on recordings of Coltrane&#x27;s performances from his European tours of the early 1960s, features tunes absent from the 1961 Village Vanguard material, such as &quot;My Favorite Things&quot;, which Dolphy performs on flute.

====Booker Little====
Trumpeter Booker Little and Dolphy had a short-lived musical partnership. Little&#x27;s leader date for Candid, &quot;Out Front&quot;, featured Dolphy mainly on alto sax, though he played bass clarinet and flute on some ensemble passages. In addition, Dolphy&#x27;s album &quot;Far Cry&quot;, recorded for Prestige, features Little on five tunes (one of which, &quot;Serene&quot;, was not included on the original LP release).

Dolphy and Little also co-led a quintet at the Five Spot during 1961. The rhythm section consisted of Richard Davis, Mal Waldron and Ed Blackwell. One night was documented and has been released as &quot;At the Five Spot&quot; (plus a &quot;Memorial Album&quot;) as well as the compilation &quot;Here and There&quot;. In addition, both Dolphy and Little backed Abbey Lincoln on her album &quot;Straight Ahead&quot; and played on Max Roach&#x27;s &quot;Percussion Bitter Sweet&quot;. Little died at the age of 23 in October 1961.

====Others====
Dolphy also performed on key recordings by George Russell (&quot;Ezz-thetics&quot;), Oliver Nelson (&quot;Screamin&#x27; the Blues&quot;, &quot;The Blues and the Abstract Truth&quot;, and &quot;Straight Ahead&quot;), and Ornette Coleman (&quot;Free Jazz: A Collective Improvisation&quot; and the &quot;Free Jazz&quot; outtake on &quot;Twins&quot;). He also worked and recorded with Gunther Schuller (&quot;Jazz Abstractions&quot;), multi-instrumentalist Ken McIntyre (&quot;Looking Ahead&quot;), bassist Ron Carter (&quot;Where?&quot;), and pianist Mal Waldron (&quot;The Quest&quot;).

===As a leader===
Dolphy&#x27;s recording career as a leader began with Prestige. His association with the label spanned 13 albums recorded from April 1960 to September 1961, though he was not the leader for all of the sessions. Fantasy released a 9-CD box set in 1995 containing all of Dolphy&#x27;s recorded output for Prestige.

Dolphy&#x27;s first two albums as leader were &quot;Outward Bound&quot; and &quot;Out There&quot;; both featured cover artwork by Richard &quot;Prophet&quot; Jennings. The first, sounding closer to hard bop than some later releases, was recorded at Rudy Van Gelder&#x27;s studio in New Jersey with trumpeter Freddie Hubbard, who shared rooms with Dolphy for a time when the two men first arrived in New York. The album features three Dolphy compositions: &quot;G.W.&quot;, dedicated to Gerald Wilson, and the blues &quot;Les&quot; and &quot;245&quot;. &quot;Out There&quot; is closer to third stream music, which would also form part of Dolphy&#x27;s work, and features Ron Carter on cello. Charles Mingus&#x27;s &quot;Eclipse&quot; from this album is one of the rare instances where Dolphy solos on soprano clarinet (others being &quot;Warm Canto&quot; from Mal Waldron&#x27;s &quot;The Quest&quot;, &quot;Densities&quot; from the compilation &quot;Vintage Dolphy&quot;, and &quot;Song For The Ram&#x27;s Horn&quot; from an unreleased recording from a 1962 Town Hall concert).

Dolphy occasionally recorded unaccompanied saxophone solos; his only predecessors were the tenor players Coleman Hawkins (&quot;Picasso&quot;, 1948) and Sonny Rollins (for example, &quot;Body and Soul&quot;, 1958), making Dolphy the first to do so on alto. The album &quot;Far Cry&quot; contains his performance of the Gross-Lawrence standard &quot;Tenderly&quot; on alto saxophone, and, on his subsequent tour of Europe, Billie Holiday&#x27;s &quot;God Bless the Child&quot; was featured in his sets. (The earliest known version was recorded at the Five Spot during his residency with Booker Little.) He also recorded two takes of a short solo rendition of &quot;Love Me&quot; in 1963, released on &quot;Conversations&quot; and &quot;Muses&quot;.

Twentieth-century classical music was also part of Dolphy&#x27;s musical career. He was very familiar with the music of composers such as Anton Webern and Alban Berg, had a large record collection that included music by these composers, as well as by Debussy, Ravel, Stravinsky, and Bartók, and owned scores by composers such as Milton Babbitt, Donald Erb, Charles Ives, and Olivier Messiaen. He visited Edgard Varèse at his home, and performed the composer&#x27;s &quot;Density 21.5&quot; for solo flute at the Ojai Music Festival in 1962. Dolphy also participated in Gunther Schuller&#x27;s and John Lewis&#x27;s Third Stream efforts of the 1960s, appearing on the album &quot;Jazz Abstractions&quot;, and admired the Italian flute virtuoso Severino Gazzelloni, after whom he named his composition &quot;Gazzelloni&quot;.

Around 1962–63, one of Dolphy&#x27;s working bands included the pianist Herbie Hancock, who can be heard on &quot;The Illinois Concert&quot;, &quot;Gaslight 1962&quot;, and the unissued Town Hall concert with poet Ree Dragonette.

In July 1963, producer Alan Douglas arranged recording sessions for which Dolphy&#x27;s sidemen were emerging musicians of the day, and the results produced the albums &quot;Iron Man&quot; and &quot;Conversations&quot;, as well as the &quot;Muses&quot; album released in Japan in late 2013. These sessions marked the first time Dolphy played with Bobby Hutcherson, whom he knew from Los Angeles, and whose sister he dated at one point. The sessions are perhaps best known for the three duets Dolphy performs with bassist Richard Davis on &quot;Alone Together&quot;, &quot;Ode To Charlie Parker&quot;, and &quot;Come Sunday&quot;; the aforementioned release &quot;Muses&quot; adds another take of &quot;Alone Together&quot; and an original composition for duet from which the album takes its name.

In 1964, Dolphy signed with Blue Note Records and recorded &quot;Out to Lunch!&quot; with Freddie Hubbard, Bobby Hutcherson, Richard Davis and Tony Williams. This album features Dolphy&#x27;s fully developed avant-garde yet structured compositional style rooted in tradition. It is often considered his &quot;magnum opus&quot;.

=== European career ===
After &quot;Out to Lunch!&quot; and an appearance on pianist/composer Andrew Hill&#x27;s Blue Note album &quot;Point of Departure&quot;, Dolphy left for Europe with Charles Mingus&#x27; sextet in early 1964. Before a concert in Oslo, Norway, he informed Mingus that he planned to stay in Europe after their tour was finished, partly because he had become disillusioned with the United States&#x27; reception of musicians who were trying something new. Mingus then named the blues they had been performing &quot;So Long Eric&quot;. Dolphy intended to settle in Europe with his fiancée Joyce Mordecai, who was working in the ballet scene in Paris, France. After leaving Mingus, he performed and recorded a few sides with various European bands, and American musicians living in Paris, such as Donald Byrd and Nathan Davis. &quot;Last Date&quot;, originally a radio broadcast of a concert in Hilversum in the Netherlands, features Misha Mengelberg and Han Bennink, although it was not Dolphy&#x27;s last public performance. Dolphy was also planning to join Albert Ayler&#x27;s group, and, according to Jeanne Phillips, quoted in A. B. Spellman&#x27;s &quot;Four Jazz Lives&quot;, was preparing himself to play with Cecil Taylor. He also planned to form a band with Woody Shaw, Richard Davis, and Billy Higgins, and was writing a string quartet, &quot;Love Suite&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Dolphy was engaged to marry Joyce Mordecai, a classically trained dancer who lived in Paris. He did not smoke and did not use drugs or alcohol.

Before he left for Europe in 1964, Dolphy left papers and other effects with his friends Hale Smith and Juanita Smith. Eventually much of this material was passed on to the musician James Newton. It was announced in May 2014 that six boxes of music papers had been donated to the Library of Congress.

On June 27, 1964, Dolphy traveled to West Berlin to play with a trio led by Karl Berger at the opening of a jazz club called The Tangent. He was apparently seriously ill when he arrived, and during the first concert was barely able to play. He was hospitalized that night, but his condition worsened. On June 29, Dolphy died after falling into a diabetic coma. While certain details of his death are still disputed, it is largely accepted that he fell into a coma caused by undiagnosed diabetes. The liner notes to the &quot;Complete Prestige Recordings&quot; box set say that Dolphy &quot;collapsed in his hotel room in Berlin and when brought to the hospital he was diagnosed as being in a diabetic coma. After being administered a shot of insulin he lapsed into insulin shock and died&quot;. A later documentary and liner notes dispute this, saying Dolphy collapsed on stage in Berlin and was brought to a hospital. Allegedly, the attending hospital physicians did not know Dolphy was a diabetic and assumed, based on a stereotype of jazz musicians, that he had overdosed on drugs. In this account, he was left in a hospital bed for the drugs to run their course. Ted Curson recalled the following: &quot;That really broke me up. When Eric got sick on that date [in Berlin], and him being black and a jazz musician, they thought he was a junkie. Eric didn&#x27;t use any drugs. He was a diabetic—all they had to do was take a blood test and they would have found that out. So he died for nothing. They gave him some detox stuff and he died, and nobody ever went into that club in Berlin again. That was the end of that club.&quot; Shortly after Dolphy&#x27;s death, Curson recorded and released &quot;Tears for Dolphy&quot;, featuring a title track that served as an elegy for his friend.

Charles Mingus remarked of Dolphy shortly after his death that &quot;Usually, when a man dies, you remember—or you say you remember—only the good things about him. With Eric, that&#x27;s all you could remember. I don&#x27;t remember any drags he did to anybody. The man was absolutely without a need to hurt.&quot;

Dolphy is buried in Angelus-Rosedale Cemetery in Los Angeles. His headstone bears the inscription: &quot;He Lives In His Music.&quot;

==Legacy==
John Coltrane acknowledged Dolphy&#x27;s influence in a 1962 &quot;DownBeat&quot; interview, stating: &quot;After he sat in... We began to play some of the things we had only talked about before. Since he&#x27;s been in the band, he&#x27;s had a broadening effect on us. There are a lot of things we try now that we never tried before. This helped me... We&#x27;re playing things that are freer than before.&quot; Coltrane biographer Eric Nisenson stated: &quot;Dolphy&#x27;s effect on Coltrane ran deep. Coltrane&#x27;s solos became far more adventurous, using musical concepts that without the chemistry of Dolphy&#x27;s advanced style he might have kept away from the ears of his public.&quot; In his book &quot;Free Jazz&quot;, Ekkehard Jost provided specific examples of how Coltrane&#x27;s playing began to change during the time he spent with Dolphy, noting that Coltrane started using wider melodic intervals like sixths and sevenths, and began focusing on integrating sound coloration and multiphonics into his solos. Jost contrasted Coltrane&#x27;s solo on &quot;India&quot;, recorded in November 1961 while Dolphy was with the group, and released on &quot;Impressions&quot;, with his solo on &quot;My Favorite Things&quot;, recorded roughly a year earlier, and released on the Atlantic album, and observed that on &quot;My Favorite Things&quot;, Coltrane &quot;accepted the mode as more or less binding, occasionally aiming away from it... at tones foreign to the scale,&quot; whereas on &quot;India&quot;, Coltrane, like Dolphy, played &quot;&quot;around&quot; the mode more than &quot;in&quot; it.&quot;

Dolphy&#x27;s musical presence was also influential to many young jazz musicians who would later become prominent. Dolphy worked intermittently with Ron Carter and Freddie Hubbard throughout his career, and in later years he hired Herbie Hancock, Bobby Hutcherson and Woody Shaw to work in his live and studio bands. &quot;Out to Lunch!&quot; featured yet another young performer, drummer Tony Williams, and Dolphy&#x27;s participation on Hill&#x27;s &quot;Point of Departure&quot; session brought him into contact with the tenor player Joe Henderson.

There is a celebration held at Le Moyne College based on a Frank Zappa song, &quot;The Eric Dolphy Memorial Barbecue,&quot; inspired by him. 

Carter, Hancock and Williams would go on to become one of the quintessential rhythm sections of the decade, both together on their own albums and as the backbone of Miles Davis&#x27;s second great quintet. This aspect of the second great quintet is an ironic footnote for Davis, who was critical of Dolphy&#x27;s music: in a 1964 &quot;DownBeat&quot; &quot;Blindfold Test&quot;, Miles quipped: &quot;The next time I see [Dolphy] I&#x27;m going to step on his foot.&quot; However, Davis new quintet&#x27;s rhythm section had all worked under Dolphy, thus creating a band whose brand of &quot;out&quot; was strongly influenced by Dolphy.

Dolphy&#x27;s virtuoso instrumental abilities and unique style of jazz, deeply emotional and free but strongly rooted in tradition and structured composition, heavily influenced such musicians as Anthony Braxton, members of the Art Ensemble of Chicago, Oliver Lake, Arthur Blythe, Don Byron, and Evan Parker.

==Awards, honors, and tributes==
Dolphy was posthumously inducted into the &quot;DownBeat&quot; magazine Hall of Fame in 1964. John Coltrane paid tribute to Dolphy in an interview: &quot;Whatever I&#x27;d say would be an understatement. I can only say my life was made much better by knowing him. He was one of the greatest people I&#x27;ve ever known, as a man, a friend, and a musician.&quot; After Dolphy died, his mother gave Coltrane his flute and bass clarinet, and Coltrane, who traveled with Dolphy&#x27;s photograph, hanging it on his hotel room walls, proceeded to play the instruments on several subsequent recordings.

Frank Zappa acknowledged Dolphy as a musical influence in the liner notes to the 1966 album &quot;Freak Out!&quot; and included a Dolphy tribute entitled &quot;The Eric Dolphy Memorial Barbecue&quot; on his 1970 album &quot;Weasels Ripped My Flesh&quot;.

Pianist Geri Allen analyzed Dolphy&#x27;s music for her master&#x27;s thesis at the University of Pittsburgh, and paid tribute to Dolphy in tunes like &quot;Dolphy&#x27;s Dance,&quot; recorded and released on her 1992 album &quot;Maroons&quot;.

In 1989, Po Torch Records released an album titled &quot;The Ericle of Dolphi,&quot; featuring Evan Parker, Paul Rutherford, Dave Holland, and Paul Lovens.

In 1997, the Vienna Art Orchestra released &quot;Powerful Ways: Nine Immortal Non-evergreens for Eric Dolphy&quot; as part of its 20th anniversary box-set.

In 2003, to mark what would have been Dolphy&#x27;s 75th birthday, a performance was made in his honor of an original composition by Phil Ranelin at the William Grant Still Arts Center in Dolphy&#x27;s hometown Los Angeles. Additionally, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors designated June 20 as Eric Dolphy Day.

In 2014, marking 50 years since Dolphy&#x27;s death, Berlin-based pianists Alexander von Schlippenbach and Aki Takase led a project called &quot;So Long, Eric!&quot;, celebrating Dolphy&#x27;s music and featuring musicians such as Han Bennink, Karl Berger, Tobias Delius, Axel Dörner, and Rudi Mahall. That year also saw a Dolphy tribute by a Berlin-based group led by Gebhard Ullmann, who had previously founded a quartet named &quot;Out to Lunch&quot; in 1983. In the United States, the arts group &quot;Seed Artists&quot; presented a two-day festival entitled &quot;Eric Dolphy: Freedom of Sound&quot; in Montclair, New Jersey, that year.

Dolphy&#x27;s compositions are the inspiration for many tribute albums, including Oliver Lake&#x27;s &quot;Prophet&quot; and &quot;Dedicated to Dolphy&quot;, Jerome Harris&#x27; &quot;Hidden In Plain View&quot;, Otomo Yoshihide&#x27;s re-imagining of &quot;Out to Lunch!&quot;, Silke Eberhard&#x27;s &quot;Potsa Lotsa: The Complete Works of Eric Dolphy&quot;, and Aki Takase and Rudi Mahall&#x27;s duo album &quot;Duet For Eric Dolphy&quot;.

The ballad &quot;Poor Eric&quot;, composed by pianist Larry Willis and appearing on Jackie McLean&#x27;s 1966 Right Now! album, is dedicated to Dolphy.

Dolphy was the subject of a 1991 documentary titled &quot;Last Date&quot;, directed by Hans Hylkema, written by Hylkema and Thierry Bruneau, and produced by Akka Volta. The film includes video clips from Dolphy&#x27;s television appearances, along with interviews with the members of the Misha Mengelberg trio, with whom Dolphy recorded in June 1964, as well as commentary from Buddy Collette, Ted Curson, Jaki Byard, Gunther Schuller, and Richard Davis.

<text>Tommaso Buscetta (; 13 July 1928 – 2 April 2000) was a high-ranking Italian mobster and a member of the Sicilian Mafia. He became one of the first of its members to turn informant and explain the inner workings of the organization.

Buscetta participated in criminal activity in Italy, the United States and Brazil before being arrested and extradited from Brazil to Italy. He became disillusioned with the Mafia after the murders of several of his family members, and in 1984, decided to cooperate with the authorities. He provided important testimony at the 1986/87 Maxi Trial, the largest anti-Mafia trial in history. After the murder of the judges Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, Buscetta gave further testimony to the Antimafia Commission linking Italian politicians to the Mafia. Buscetta entered the Witness Protection Program in the United States, where he remained until his death in 2000.

==Early life==
Tommaso Buscetta was born on 13 July 1928, in Palermo, Sicily, the youngest of 17 children; his father was a glazier. Buscetta was raised in Kalsa, a poverty-stricken area of Palermo, which he escaped by getting involved with crime at a young age. He first became involved with the Sicilian Mafia in 1945, and in the following years, he became a full-fledged member of the Porta Nuova mandamento, where he worked mostly in cigarette smuggling.

Buscetta married his first wife Melchiorra Cavallaro in 1944 and had three children. In 1949, he moved to Argentina and then to Brazil, where he opened a glassworks store, but in 1956, he returned to Palermo where he joined Angelo La Barbera and Salvatore &quot;Ciaschiteddu&quot; Greco together with mafiosi Antonino Sorci, Pietro Davì and Gaetano Badalamenti, dealing with the cigarette and drug smuggling. He married his second wife Vera Girotti in 1966 and had one child. Two years later, he married his third wife Cristina De Almeida Guimarães after moving to Brazil, and had four children. In 1958 he was arrested for cigarette smuggling and criminal association during an investigation conducted by the Guardia di Finanza against the Corsican Pascal Molinelli and the Tangerian Salomon Gozal, indicated as major suppliers of cigarettes and drugs for the Sicilian gangs. In January 1959 he was arrested again for the smuggling of two tons of cigarettes to supply Yugoslavia.

==First arrest==
After the Ciaculli Massacre in 1963, part of an internal Mafia conflict known as the First Mafia War, he was wanted by the police. Buscetta fled to Switzerland, Mexico, Canada, and finally, the United States. In 1968, Buscetta was convicted &quot;in absentia&quot; by an Italian court of two murders related to the Ciaculli Massacre.

On 25 August 1970, Buscetta was arrested in Brooklyn, New York, but was released on 4 December 1970. On 21 July 1971, an arrest warrant was issued by Italian police. Buscetta moved to Brazil, having undergone plastic surgery and vocal cord surgery, he set up a drug trafficking network, but on 3 November 1972, was arrested by the Brazilian military government, and subsequently extradited to Italy exactly one month later where he began a ten-year sentence at Palermo&#x27;s Ucciardone prison for drug trafficking, reduced to eight years after appeal. He was later transferred to the Le Nuove prison in Turin.

==Second arrest==
In February 1980, he was granted &quot;half-freedom&quot;, immediately fleeing back to Brazil to escape the brewing Second Mafia War instigated by Salvatore Riina. On 11 September 1982, Buscetta&#x27;s two sons from his first wife, Benedetto and Antonio, disappeared, never to be found again, which prompted his collaboration with Italian authorities. This was followed by the deaths of his brother Vincenzo, son-in-law Giuseppe Genova, brother-in-law Pietro and four of his nephews, Domenico and Benedetto Buscetta, and Orazio and Antonio D&#x27;Amico. The war subsequently led to the deaths of many of Buscetta&#x27;s allies, including Stefano Bontade. Buscetta was arrested again in São Paulo, Brazil on 23 October 1983. He was extradited to Italy on 28 June 1984, where he attempted suicide by ingestion of barbiturates; when that failed, he decided that he was utterly disillusioned with the Mafia. Buscetta asked to talk to the anti-Mafia judge Giovanni Falcone, and began his life as an informant, referred to as a &quot;pentito&quot;.

==&quot;Pentito&quot;==
Buscetta revealed information to Falcone for 45 days, explaining the inner workings and hierarchical structures of Cosa Nostra including the Sicilian Mafia Commission, that, until then, were unclear because of the strict code of silence. This became known as the &quot;Buscetta theorem&quot;. He also revealed Mafia initiation rituals. Buscetta refused to speak with Falcone of the political ties of Cosa Nostra because, in his opinion, the state was not ready for statements of that magnitude, and proved to be quite general on that subject.

In December 1984, he was extradited to the United States where he received a new identity from the government and American citizenship and was placed in the Witness Protection Program in exchange for new revelations against the American Mafia. He testified in the Pizza Connection Trial, which took place in 1985 in New York and saw defendants Gaetano Badalamenti and other Sicilian-American mafiosi accused of drug trafficking. He also testified in 1986 at the largest trial against the Mafia in history, the Maxi Trial in Palermo, arising from the statements made to Falcone. Buscetta helped judges Falcone and Paolo Borsellino achieve significant success in the fight against organized crime, which led to 475 Mafia members indicted and 338 convicted; those sentences were upheld in 1992.

In mid-1992, following the bomb attacks in which Falcone and Borsellino were killed, Buscetta began to speak of the political ties of the Cosa Nostra with magistrates, accusing Salvo Lima, killed a few months earlier, and Giulio Andreotti of being the main political referents of the organization; in particular, he reported that he had known Lima personally since the late 1950s, and had met him last in 1980, and also reported that he had learned that the murder of the journalist Mino Pecorelli in 1979 would have been carried out in Andreotti&#x27;s interest. Buscetta was one of the main witnesses of the trials against Andreotti for mafia association and for the Pecorelli murder. Andreotti was eventually acquitted in 1999 of the charge of having commissioned the assassination of Pecorelli. In court, Buscetta also elaborated in great detail the hidden exchanges that linked politicians and the Mafia. He stated: 
It is not Cosa Nostra that contacts the politician; instead a member of the Cosa Nostra says, that president is mine (è cosa mia), and if you need a favor, you must go through me. In other words, the Cosa Nostra figure maintains a sort of monopoly on that politician. Every family head in the Mafia selects a man whose characteristics already make him look approachable. Forget the idea that some pact is reached first. On the contrary, one goes to that candidate and says, &quot;Onorevole, I can do this and that for you now, and we hope that when you are elected you will remember us&quot;. The candidate wins and he has to pay something back. You tell him, &quot;We need this, will you do it or not?&quot;. The politician understands immediately and acts always.

During a trial in 1993, the Mafia member Salvatore Cancemi confessed to Buscetta that he had strangled two of Buscetta&#x27;s sons to death. After the trial, Buscetta embraced Cancemi and said: &quot;You could not refuse the order. I forgive you because I know what it means to be in Cosa Nostra.&quot;

==Death==
Buscetta died of cancer on 2 April 2000, aged 71, having lived out most of his life in hiding with his third wife and family in Florida, United States, under false names. He was buried under a false name in North Miami, Florida.

==In popular culture==
He was played by F. Murray Abraham in the 1999 film &quot;Excellent Cadavers&quot;. He was played by Vincent Riotta in the 2007 mini-series &quot;Il Capo dei Capi&quot;. He was portrayed by Sergio Vespertino in the 2016 Italian TV series &quot;The Mafia Kills Only in Summer&quot;. He was portrayed by Pierfrancesco Favino in the 2019 film &quot;The Traitor&quot;, directed by Marco Bellocchio and selected to compete for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival. Also released in 2019, &quot;Our Godfather&quot; is a documentary by Mark Franchetti and Andrew Meier which includes onscreen testimony by Buscetta&#x27;s third wife and surviving children &quot;who still live in anonymity because of fear of reprisal&quot;, according to one review.

<doc id="72705" wikidata="Q1069160" url="?curid=72705" title="Out-of-place artifact">
<text>An out-of-place artifact (OOPArt or oopart) is an artifact of historical, archaeological, or paleontological interest to someone that is claimed to have been found in an unusual context, which someone claims to challenge conventional historical chronology by its presence in that context. Some people might think that those artifacts are too advanced for the technology known to have existed at the time, or that human presence existed at a time before humans are known to have existed. Other people might hypothesize about a contact between different cultures that is hard to account for with conventional historical understanding.

This description of archaeological objects is used in fringe science such as cryptozoology, as well as by proponents of ancient astronaut theories, young Earth creationists, and paranormal enthusiasts. It can describe a wide variety of items, from anomalies studied by mainstream science to pseudoarchaeology to objects that have been shown to be hoaxes or to have conventional explanations.

Critics argue that most purported OOPArts which are not hoaxes are the result of mistaken interpretation and wishful thinking, such as a mistaken belief that a particular culture could not have created an artifact or technology due to a lack of knowledge or materials. In some cases, the uncertainty results from inaccurate descriptions. For example, the cuboid Wolfsegg Iron is not a perfect cube, nor are the Klerksdorp spheres perfect spheres. The Iron pillar of Delhi was said to be &quot;rust proof&quot;, but it has some rust near its base; its relative resistance to corrosion is due to slag inclusions left over from the manufacturing conditions and environmental factors.

Supporters regard OOPArts as evidence that mainstream science is overlooking huge areas of knowledge, either willfully or through ignorance. Many writers or researchers who question conventional views of human history have used purported OOPArts in attempts to bolster their arguments. Creation science often relies on allegedly anomalous finds in the archaeological record to challenge scientific chronologies and models of human evolution. Claimed OOPArts have been used to support religious descriptions of prehistory, ancient astronaut theories, and the notion of vanished civilizations that possessed knowledge or technology more advanced than that known in modern times.

== Unusual artifacts ==
* Antikythera mechanism: A form of mechanical computer created between 150 and 100 BCE based on theories of astronomy and mathematics believed to have been developed by the ancient Greeks. Its design and workmanship reflect a previously unknown degree of sophistication and engineering.
* Maine penny: An 11th-century Norwegian coin found in a Native American shell midden at the Goddard Site in Brooklin, Maine, United States, which some authors have argued is evidence of direct contact between Vikings and Native Americans in Maine. The coin need not imply actual exploration of Maine by the Vikings, however; mainstream belief is that it was brought to Maine from Labrador or Newfoundland (where Vikings are known to have established colonies as early as the late 10th century) via an extensive northern trade network operated by indigenous peoples. If Vikings did indeed visit Maine, a much greater number and variety of Viking artifacts might be expected in the archaeological record there. Of the nearly 20,000 objects found over a 15-year period at the Goddard Site, the coin was the sole non-native artifact.

* The Tamil Bell is a broken bronze bell with an inscription of old Tamil. The bell is a mystery due to its discovery in New Zealand by a missionary. Although nobody knows for certain how the bell came to New Zealand, one possible theory suggests that it was left by Portuguese sailors who had acquired it from Tamil traders. Prior to being discovered by the missionary, local Māori had used it as a cooking pot. Given that it was supposedly discovered generations earlier, the artifact&#x27;s exact origins could not be identified. The bell is now located at the National Museum of New Zealand.
* Coins from Marchinbar Island: Five coins from the Kilwa Sultanate on the Swahili coast discovered on Marchinbar Island in the Northern Territory of Australia in 1945 alongside four coins from 18th century Netherlands. The inscriptions on the coins identify a ruling Sultan of Kilwa, but it is unclear whether the ruler was from the 10th century or the 14th century. A similar coin, also thought to be from the Medieval Kilwa sultanate, was found in Australia in 2018 on Elcho Island.
* Traces of cocaine and nicotine found in Egyptian mummies, which have been variously interpreted as evidence of contact between Ancient Egypt and Pre-Columbian America or as the result of contamination.

* The Shroud of Turin contains an image that resembles a sepia photographic negative, established by radiocarbon dating to have been produced between the years 1260 and 1390. The technology of photographic negatives was introduced in 1839 by Henry Fox Talbot and the fact that the image on the shroud is much clearer when it is converted to a positive image wasn&#x27;t discovered until Secondo Pia photographed it in 1898. The actual method that resulted in this image has not yet been conclusively identified; no traces of pigments or dyes have been found, and hypotheses about a medieval proto-photographic process, a rubbing technique, natural chemical processes or some kind of radiation have not convinced many researchers. Mention of the shroud first appeared in historical records in 1357. All hypotheses put forward to challenge the radiocarbon dating have been scientifically refuted, including the medieval repair hypothesis, the bio-contamination hypothesis and the carbon monoxide hypothesis. It has traditionally been believed that the cloth is the burial shroud in which Jesus of Nazareth was wrapped after crucifixion.

== Questionable interpretations ==

* Baghdad Battery: A ceramic vase, a copper tube, and an iron rod made in Parthian or Sassanid Persia, discovered in 1936. Fringe theorists have hypothesized that it may have been used as a galvanic cell for electroplating, though no electroplated artifacts from this era have been found. The &quot;battery&quot; strongly resembles another type of object with a known purpose – storage vessels for sacred scrolls from nearby Seleucia on the Tigris.
* Dorchester Pot: A metal pot claimed to have been blasted out of solid rock in 1852. Mainstream commentators identify it as a Victorian-era candlestick or pipe holder.
* Kingoodie artifact: An object resembling a corroded nail, said to have been encased in solid rock. It was handled a number of times before being reported and there are no photographs of it.
* Lake Winnipesaukee mystery stone: Originally thought to be a record of a treaty between tribes, subsequent analysis has called its authenticity into question.
* &quot;Sivatherium&quot; of Kish: An ornamental war chariot figurine discovered in the Sumerian ruins of Kish, in what is now central Iraq, in 1928. The figurine, dated to the Early Dynastic I period (2800–2750 BCE), depicts a quadrupedal mammal with branched horns, a nose ring, and a rope tied to the ring. Because of the shape of the horns, Edwin Colbert identified it in 1936 as a depiction of a late-surviving, possibly domesticated &quot;Sivatherium&quot;, a vaguely moose-like relative of the giraffe that lived in North Africa and India during the Pleistocene but was believed to have become extinct early in the Holocene extinction event. Henry Field and Berthold Laufer instead argued that it represented a captive Persian fallow deer and that the antlers had broken over the years. The missing antlers were indeed found in the Field Museum&#x27;s storeroom in 1977. After restoration in 1985, it was conclusively identified as a depiction of a Caspian red deer (&quot;Cervus elaphus maral&quot;).
* Tecaxic-Calixtlahuaca head: A terracotta offering head seemingly of Roman appearance found beneath three intact floors of a burial site in Mexico and dated between 1476 and 1510. There are disputed claims that its dating is older. Ancient Roman or Norse provenance has not been excluded.
* The Westford Knight: A pattern, variously interpreted as a carving or a natural feature, or a combination of both, located on a glacial boulder in Westford, Massachusetts in the United States. Pseudohistorical interpretations have labeled it as evidence of pre-Columbian contact with Medieval Europe.

== Alternative interpretations ==

* Abydos helicopter: A pareidolia based on palimpsest carving in an ancient Egyptian temple.
* Dendera Lamps: Supposed to depict light bulbs, but made in Ptolemaic Egypt, debunked by the analysis of the epigraphic text. The motif actually represents a lotus flower.
* Sabu disk: a disk of notable precision apparently from ancient times in Saqqara. Its purpose is unknown.
* Iron Man (&quot;Eiserner Mann&quot;): An old iron pillar, said to be a unique oddity in Germany, but consistent with medieval methods of ironworking.
* Iron pillar of Delhi: A &quot;rust-proof&quot; iron pillar which supposedly demonstrates more advanced metallurgy than was available in India before 1000 CE.
* London Hammer: Also known as the &quot;London Artifact&quot;, a hammer made of iron and wood that was found in London, Texas, in 1936. Part of the hammer is encased in &quot;400-million-year-old&quot; (&quot;Ordovician era&quot;) rock. In 1985, anthropologist John R. Cole hypothesized that the stone surrounding the hammer is a recent carbonate soil concretion.
* Meister Print: A supposed human footprint from the Cambrian period, long before humans existed, which has been debunked as the result of a natural geologic process known as spall formation.
* Pacal&#x27;s sarcophagus lid: Described by Erich von Däniken as a depiction of a spaceship&#x27;s cockpit.
* Piri Reis map: Several authors, such as pseudohistorian Gavin Menzies and pseudoscientist Charles Hapgood, have suggested that this map, compiled by the Turkish admiral Piri Reis, showed Antarctica long before it was discovered (cf. Terra Australis).
* Quimbaya airplanes: Golden objects found in Colombia and made by the Quimbaya civilization, which have been alleged to represent modern airplanes. In the Gold Museum, Bogotá, they are described as figures of birds and insects. Some of the artifacts have also been debunked as forgeries.
* Saqqara Bird: Supposedly depicts a glider, but made in Ancient Egypt.
* Shakōkidogū: Small humanoid and animal figurines made during the late Jōmon period (14,000–400 BCE) of prehistoric Japan, said to resemble extraterrestrial astronauts.
* Stone spheres of Costa Rica: Inaccurately described as being perfectly spherical, and therefore demonstrating greater stone-working skill in pre-Columbian times than has previously been known.
* Fuente Magna, a large stone vessel that was discovered in Bolivia in 1950, with many engravings on its inside that have been compared to Sumerian cuneiform writing. Archeologist and historian of the Near East Alexander H. Joffe has described the patterns as &quot;geometric filler or deliberate gibberish&quot; and thought the face on the interior resembles local Tiwanaku culture. He suggested it could be a fake or a local oddity.

== Natural objects mistaken for artifacts ==

* Aix-en-Provence petrified tools: Likely petrified tree remains.
* Baigong pipes: Their natural origins have been challenged.
* Bosnian pyramid complex: Unproven claim that there is a pyramid complex in the vicinity of town of Visoko in Bosnia, made by ancient Bosnians.
* Eltanin Antenna: Actually a sponge.
* Eoliths: Miocene knapped flint nodules mistaken in the 19th century for extremely primitive stone tools, which helped back the authenticity of Piltdown Man.
* Face on Mars: A pareidolia of a rock formation on Mars caused by the poor resolution of early orbital photography of the planet.
* Klerksdorp spheres: Actually pre-Cambrian concretions.
* Gunung Padang pyramid: megalithic site built on the slopes of an ancient volcano which has been misidentified as a 20,000 year old pyramid.
* Paluxy River tracks: Identified as giant humanoid footprints found alongside dinosaur tracks. Actually tracks of theropod dinosaurs, and 1930s forgeries.
* Yonaguni Monument: An unusual underwater rock formation near the southern Ryukyu Islands. Was considered a man-made monolith because of the even cracks.
* Ararat anomaly: The Ararat anomaly is a structure appearing on photographs of the snowfields near the summit of Mount Ararat, Turkey, initially believed by some Christian believers to be the remains of Noah&#x27;s Ark. Located on the northwest corner of the Western Plateau of Mount Ararat, approximately 15,500 ft high, it was first filmed during a U.S. Air Force aerial reconnaissance mission in 1949. The Defense Intelligence Agency later indicated that the anomaly represents linear facades in the glacial ice, rather than an ancient structure.

== Erroneously dated objects ==
* Aiud object: An aluminum wedge found in 1974 in the Mureș River in central Romania, near the town of Aiud; it has been claimed by Romanian ufologists to be of ancient and/or origin, yet it is more likely a fragment of modern machinery lost during excavation work.
* Coso artifact: Claimed to be prehistoric; actually a 1920s spark plug that had become encased in a concretion.
* Malachite Man: Thought to be from the early Cretaceous; actually a post-Columbian burial.
* Nampa figurine: Was a clay fired doll found in Nampa, Idaho during a well drilling. Early dating attempts believed the artifact to be 2 million years old due to the rock layer it was found in. Later assessments found that the artifact was either only a few thousand years old or a 19th-century Native American doll. Many have criticized the object as a likely hoax.
* Wolfsegg Iron: Thought to be from the Tertiary epoch; actually from an early mining operation. Inaccurately described as a perfect cube.

== Modern-day creations, forgeries and hoaxes ==
* &quot;Babylonokia&quot;: A clay tablet shaped like a mobile phone and created as an artwork in 2012. Fringe scientists and alternative archaeology proponents subsequently misrepresented a photograph of the artwork as showing an 800-year-old archaeological find. The story was popularised in a video on the YouTube channel &quot;Paranormal Crucible&quot; and led to the object being reported by some press sources as a mystery.
* Acámbaro figures: Mid-20th-century figurines of dinosaurs, attributed by Waldemar Julsrud to an ancient society.
* Calaveras Skull: A human skull found by miners in Calaveras County, California, which was purported to prove that humans, mastodons, and elephants had coexisted in prehistoric California. It was later revealed to be a hoax.
* Cardiff Giant: A 19th-century hoax of a ten-foot-tall supposedly petrified man exhibited as a giant from biblical times. Quickly debunked by experts, and by the confession of the forger, it was nonetheless a popular marvel of the day.
* Crystal skulls: Supposedly demonstrate more advanced stone-cutting skill than was previously known from pre-Columbian Mesoamerica. Appear to have been made in the 19th century.
* Gosford Glyphs: A collection of Egyptian hieroglyphs on the Central Coast, Australia, that have been dismissed as a hoax by authorities and academics after their discovery in the 1970s.
* Ica stones: Depict Inca dinosaur-hunters, surgery, and other modern or fanciful topics. Collected by Javier Cabrera Darquea, who claimed them to be prehistoric. Later revealed to be a forgery created by a local farmer. 
* Japanese Paleolithic hoax: Perpetrated by discredited amateur archaeologist Shinichi Fujimura.
* Kensington Runestone: A runestone purportedly unearthed in 1898 in Kensington, Minnesota entangled in the roots of a tree. Runologists have dismissed the inscription&#x27;s authenticity on linguistic evidence, while geologists disagree as to whether the stone shows weathering that would indicate a medieval date.
* Los Lunas Decalogue Stone: Supposedly made by pre-Columbian Israelite visitors to the Americas. Generally believed to be a modern-day hoax.
* Michigan relics: Supposedly ancient artifacts which have been alleged as proof that people of an ancient Near Eastern culture had lived in the U.S. state of Michigan; they are archaeological forgeries.
* Newark Holy Stones: Hoax &quot;artifacts&quot; used as extremely unlikely evidence that Hebrew peoples lived in the Precolumbian Americas.
* Piltdown Man: Supposedly skull parts from a &quot;missing link&quot; hominid, but exposed as an elaborate hoax 41 years after its &quot;discovery&quot;.
* Tucson artifacts: Thirty-one lead objects that Charles E. Manier and his family found in 1924 near Picture Rocks, Arizona, which were initially thought by some to be created by early Mediterranean civilizations that had crossed the Atlantic in the first century, but were later determined to be a hoax.

<doc id="72708" wikidata="Q156617" url="?curid=72708" title="Christian X of Denmark">
<text>Christian X (; 26 September 1870 – 20 April 1947) was King of Denmark from 1912 until his death in 1947, and the only King of Iceland as Kristján X, holding the title as a result of the personal union between Denmark and independent Iceland between 1918 and 1944.

He was a member of the House of Glücksburg, a branch of the House of Oldenburg, and the first monarch since King Frederick VII born into the Danish royal family; both his father and his grandfather were born as princes of a ducal family from Schleswig. Among his siblings was King Haakon VII of Norway. His son became Frederick IX of Denmark. Among his cousins were King George V of the United Kingdom, Emperor Nicholas II of Russia, and King Constantine I of Greece, while Queen Maud of Norway, was both his cousin and sister-in-law.

His character has been described as authoritarian and he strongly stressed the importance of royal dignity and power. His reluctance to fully embrace democracy resulted in the Easter Crisis of 1920, in which he dismissed the democratically elected Social Liberal cabinet with which he disagreed, and installed one of his own choosing. This was in accordance with the letter of the constitution, but the principle of parliamentarianism had been considered a constitutional custom since 1901. Faced with mass demonstrations, a general strike organized by the Social Democrats and the risk of the monarchy being overthrown he was forced to accept that a monarch could not keep a government in office against the will of parliament, as well as his reduced role as a symbolic head of state.

During the German occupation of Denmark, Christian became a popular symbol of resistance, particularly because of the symbolic value of the fact that he rode every day through the streets of Copenhagen unaccompanied by guards. With a reign spanning two world wars, and his role as a rallying symbol for Danish national sentiment during the German occupation, he became one of the most popular Danish monarchs of modern times.

==Early life==
===Birth===

Christian was born on 26 September 1870 at his parents&#x27; country residence, the Charlottenlund Palace, located on the shores of the Øresund Strait 10 kilometers north of Copenhagen on the island of Zealand in Denmark, during the reign of his paternal grandfather, King Christian IX. He was the first child of Crown Prince Frederick of Denmark and his wife Louise of Sweden. His father was the eldest son of King Christian IX of Denmark and Louise of Hesse-Kassel, and his mother was the only daughter of King Charles XV of Sweden and Norway and Louise of the Netherlands. The Danish author Hans Christian Andersen wrote the next day in his diary: &quot;The night before 12 a Prince was born by the Crown Princess, the whole city flagged today in the beautiful weather.&quot; He was baptised with the names &quot;Christian Carl Frederik Albert Alexander Vilhelm&quot; in the chapel of Christiansborg Palace on 31 October 1870 by the Bishop of Zealand, Hans Lassen Martensen. The royal christening gown, which has been used for the baptism of almost all royal children in Denmark ever since, was used for the first time at his christening. This gown is made of Brussels lace, and was bought by Crown Princess Louise in Belgium for her eldest son&#x27;s christening.
Prince Christian was raised with his siblings in the royal household in Copenhagen, and grew up between his parents&#x27; residence in Copenhagen, the Frederick VIII&#x27;s Palace, an 18th century palace which forms part of the Amalienborg Palace complex in central Copenhagen, and their country residence, the Charlottenlund Palace, located by the coastline of the Øresund strait north of the city. As a grandchild of the reigning Danish monarch in the male line and the eldest son of the Crown Prince, he was second in line to the throne, after his father. In contrast to the usual practise of the period, where royal children were brought up by governesses, the children were raised by Crown Princess Louise herself. Under the supervision of their mother, the children of the Crown Princess received a rather strict Christian-dominated upbringing, which was characterized by severity, the fulfillment of duties, care and order. Prince Christian was less than two years older than his brother Prince Carl, and the two princes had a joint confirmation at the chapel of Christiansborg Palace in 1887. The two princes were educated at home by private tutors. In 1889 Prince Christian passed the examen artium (the university entrance examination in Denmark) in 1889 as the first member of the Danish royal family. Afterwards he started a military education as was customary for princes at that time. He subsequently served with the 5th Dragoon Regiment and later studied at the Officers Academy in Randers from 1891 to 1892.

===Marriage===
As a young man, Prince Christian fell in love with the French Princess Marguerite of Orléans, who was the younger sister of his uncle Prince Valdemar&#x27;s wife Princess Marie of Orléans. The feelings, however, were not reciprocated, and after a few years of unhappy infatuation, she married in 1896 Marie Armand Patrice de Mac Mahon, 2nd Duke of Magenta, son of the French Marshal and President Patrice de MacMahon.

During a stay in Cannes in March 1897, Christian met and fell in love with Duchess Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin; she was a daughter of Frederick Francis III, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, and Grand Duchess Anastasia Mikhailovna of Russia. They were engaged in Schwerin on 24 March 1897 and married in Cannes on 26 April 1898. She eventually became his queen consort. They had two sons:

* Prince Frederik (1899–1972), later King Frederick IX of Denmark
* Prince Knud (1900–1976), later Knud, Hereditary Prince of Denmark

The couple were given Christian VIII&#x27;s Palace at Amalienborg Palace in Copenhagen as their residence and Sorgenfri Palace north of Copenhagen as a summer residence. Furthermore, the couple received Marselisborg Palace in Aarhus as a wedding present from the people of Denmark in 1898. In 1914, the King also built the villa Klitgården in Skagen.

===Crown Prince===
On 29 January 1906, King Christian IX died, and Christian&#x27;s father ascended the throne as King Frederick VIII. Christian himself became crown prince.
== Reign ==
===Accession===

On 14 May 1912, King Frederick VIII died at the age of 68 after collapsing from shortness of breath while taking an evening walk in Hamburg, Germany. He had been returning from a recuperation stay in Nice, France, and was staying anonymously in the city before continuing to Copenhagen. Christian was in Copenhagen when he heard about his father&#x27;s demise and succeeded to the throne at the age of 41. He was proclaimed king from the balcony of Christian VII&#x27;s Palace at Amalienborg by the Prime Minister Klaus Berntsen as King Christian X.

===World War I===
At the start of the First World War in 1914, King Christian and the Danish government advocated that Denmark pursue a policy of neutrality. The King supported the policy of neutrality by participating in the so-called meeting of the Three Kings held on 18 December 1914 in Malmö in Sweden. There, the three Scandinavian monarchs King Christian X of Denmark, King Haakon VII of Norway (Christian&#x27;s brother) and King Gustav V of Sweden (Christian&#x27;s mother&#x27;s cousin) met along with their foreign ministers to discuss and emphasize the neutrality of the Nordic countries, and in a joint declaration, confirmed the three states&#x27; strict neutrality during the war. The meeting in 1914 was followed by another three-kings meeting in Kristiania in November 1917.

Denmark in fact managed to maintain its neutrality during the war. However, the Danish government bowed to pressure from Germany, and had naval mines laid in Danish waters with tacit British acceptance, despite the fact that Denmark was obliged under international law to keep its territorial waters open.

In 1915, the Constitution of Denmark was changed to introduce universal suffrage, and women were given the right to vote along with domestic servants. Although the king was reluctant to the constitutional changes, the Danish Women&#x27;s Society organized a procession with approximately 20,000 participants who went to Amalienborg to thank the king. In his address to the procession, the king stated, among other things: In one place, women cannot be dispensed with, and that is in the homes. Here, the influence of women cannot be replaced, because through the child&#x27;s love for the home, the one for our common home, Denmark, is awakened.

===Easter Crisis of 1920===
In April 1920, Christian instigated the Easter Crisis, perhaps the most decisive event in the evolution of the Danish monarchy in the twentieth century. The immediate cause was a conflict between the King and the cabinet over the reunification with Denmark of Schleswig, a former Danish fiefdom, which had been lost to Prussia during the Second War of Schleswig. Danish claims to the region persisted to the end of World War I, at which time the defeat of the Germans made it possible to resolve the dispute. According to the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, the disposition of Schleswig was to be determined by two plebiscites: one in Northern Schleswig (Denmark&#x27;s South Jutland County 1971–2006), the other in Central Schleswig (today part of the German state of Schleswig-Holstein). No plebiscite was planned for Southern Schleswig, as it was dominated by an ethnic German majority and, in accordance with prevailing sentiment of the times, remained part of the post-war German state.

In Northern Schleswig, seventy-five percent voted for reunification with Denmark and twenty-five percent for remaining with Germany. In this vote, the entire region was considered to be an indivisible unit, and the entire region was awarded to Denmark. In Central Schleswig, the situation was reversed with eighty percent voting for Germany and twenty percent for Denmark. In this vote, each municipality decided its own future, and German majorities prevailed everywhere. In light of these results, the government of Prime Minister Carl Theodor Zahle determined that reunification with Northern Schleswig could go forward, while Central Schleswig would remain under German control.

Many Danish nationalists felt that at least the city of Flensburg, in Central Schleswig, should be returned to Denmark regardless of the plebiscite&#x27;s results, due to the sizeable Danish minority there and a general desire to see Germany permanently weakened in the future. Christian X agreed with these sentiments, and ordered Prime Minister Zahle to include Flensburg in the re-unification process. As Denmark had been operating as a parliamentary democracy since the Cabinet of Deuntzer in 1901, Zahle felt he was under no obligation to comply. He refused the order and resigned several days later after a heated exchange with the King.

Subsequently, Christian X dismissed the rest of the cabinet and replaced it with a &quot;de facto&quot; conservative caretaker cabinet. The dismissal caused demonstrations and an almost revolutionary atmosphere in Denmark, and for several days the future of the monarchy seemed very much in doubt. In light of this, negotiations were opened between the King and members of the Social Democrats. Faced with the potential overthrow of the Danish Crown, Christian X stood down and dismissed his own government, installing a compromise cabinet until elections could be held later that year.

To date, this is the last time a reigning Danish monarch has attempted to take political action without the full support of parliament. Following the crisis, Christian X bowed fully to his drastically reduced status, and spent the last quarter-century of his rule as a model constitutional monarch.

===World War II===
On 9 April 1940 at 4 am Nazi Germany invaded Denmark in a surprise attack, overwhelming Denmark&#x27;s Army and Navy and destroying the Danish Army Air Corps. Christian X quickly realized that Denmark was in an impossible position. Its territory and population were far too small to hold out against Germany for any sustained period of time. Its flat land would have resulted in it being easily overrun by German panzers; Jutland, for instance, would have been overrun in short order by a panzer attack from Schleswig-Holstein immediately to the south. Unlike its Nordic neighbours, Denmark had no mountain ranges from which a drawn-out resistance could be mounted against the German army. With no prospect of being able to hold out for any length of time, and faced with the explicit threat of the Luftwaffe bombing the civilian population of Copenhagen, and with only one general in favour of continuing to fight, Christian X and the entire Danish government capitulated at about 6 am, in exchange for retaining political independence in domestic matters, beginning the occupation of Denmark, which lasted until 5 May 1945.

In contrast to his brother, King Haakon VII of Norway, and Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, King George II of the Hellenes, Grand Duchess Charlotte of Luxembourg, King Peter II of Yugoslavia, President Edvard Beneš of Czechoslovakia and President Władysław Raczkiewicz of Poland, all of whom went into exile during the Nazi occupation of their countries, Christian X (like King Leopold III of the Belgians, unlike President Albert Lebrun of France who was deposed) remained in his capital throughout the occupation of Denmark, being to the Danish people a visible symbol of the national cause (Haakon escaped the German advance after refusing to accept a Nazi-friendly puppet regime.)

Until the imposition of martial law by Germany in August 1943, Christian&#x27;s official speeches reflected the government&#x27;s official policy of cooperation with the occupying forces, but this did not prevent his being seen by the Danish people as a man of &quot;mental resistance.&quot; During the first two years of the German occupation, despite his age and the precarious situation, he took a daily ride on his horse, Jubilee, through Copenhagen, unaccompanied by a groom, let alone a guard. A popular way for Danes to display patriotism and silent resistance to the German occupation was wearing a small square button with the Danish flag and the crowned insignia of the king. This symbol was called the &quot;Kongemærket&quot; (&quot;King&#x27;s Emblem pin&quot;). In addition, he helped finance the transport of Danish Jews to unoccupied Sweden, where they would be safe from Nazi persecution.

In 1942, Adolf Hitler sent Christian a long telegram congratulating him on his seventy-second birthday. The king&#x27;s reply telegram was a mere, &quot;Spreche Meinen besten Dank aus. Chr. Rex&quot; (&quot;Giving my best thanks, King Christian&quot;). This perceived slight, known as the Telegram Crisis, greatly outraged Hitler and he immediately recalled his ambassador from Copenhagen and expelled the Danish ambassador from Germany. German pressure then resulted in the dismissal of the government led by Vilhelm Buhl and its replacement with a new cabinet led by non-party member and veteran diplomat Erik Scavenius, whom the Germans expected to be more cooperative. (In any event, whatever independence Denmark had been able to maintain during the first years of the occupation ended abruptly with the German &quot;Putsch&quot; in August 1943.) After a fall with his horse on 19 October 1942, Christian was more or less an invalid for the rest of his reign. The role he played in creating the Easter Crisis of 1920 had greatly reduced his popularity, but his daily rides, the Telegram Crisis, and the admiring stories spread by Danish-American circles once again made him popular to the point of being a beloved national symbol.

===Reign over Iceland===

The accession of a new Danish–Icelandic Act of Union in late 1918 redefined Iceland, a longtime part of the Danish realm, as a sovereign state in a personal union with the Kingdom of Denmark. This made Christian the king of the mostly autonomous Kingdom of Iceland in addition to being King of Denmark. Christian (whose name in Iceland was officially &quot;Kristján X&quot;) was the first and only monarch to ever reign over Iceland as a sovereign kingdom as opposed to ruling it as a province of a larger kingdom. In 1941, after the German occupation of Denmark and the Allied occupation of Iceland, the Icelandic government concluded that Christian was unable to perform his duties as head of state of Iceland, and thus appointed Sveinn Björnsson as regent to act as provisional head of state. Sveinn had previously been Iceland&#x27;s ambassador in Copenhagen.

In 1944, while Denmark was still under German occupation, Icelanders voted in a plebiscite to sever all ties with the King of Denmark and to found a republic. Thus, Christian&#x27;s title as King of Iceland became null and void and Sveinn Björnsson was elected the first President of Iceland by the Icelandic parliament. Christian, who believed that Sveinn had given him assurances that Iceland would not make further moves toward independence while the occupation was ongoing, felt quite badly betrayed. However, at the urging of his relative, the King of Sweden, Christian still accepted the outcome and sent a message of congratulations to Iceland during the celebration of the founding of the Republic on 17 June 1944. The reading of the King&#x27;s letter provoked cheers at Þingvellir during the celebration. Despite this implicit acceptance of Iceland&#x27;s independence, Christian never actually stopped using the title &quot;King of Iceland&quot;, and continued including it in his regnal name until his death in 1947.

===Death===
Christian X died at the Amalienborg Palace in Copenhagen, on 20 April 1947, at the age of 76. Christian X was interred along with other members of the Danish royal family in Roskilde Cathedral near Copenhagen. A cloth armband of the type worn by members of the Danish resistance movement was placed on his coffin under a castrum doloris.

==Legends==
On 22 November 1942, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; published a photograph of Christian X, facetiously calling him a victim of Hitler, and stated that the nation of this monarch did not oppose German occupation with arms. It then became important for Danish Americans to prove the contrary, and a number of stories were invented in the turmoil of the war. The most successful of these was the legend of the King wearing the yellow star to support the Jews.

King Christian used to ride daily through the streets of Copenhagen unaccompanied while the people stood and waved to him. One apocryphal story relates that one day, a German soldier remarked to a young boy that he found it odd that the King would ride with no bodyguard. The boy reportedly replied, &quot;All of Denmark is his bodyguard.&quot; This story was recounted in Nathaniel Benchley&#x27;s bestselling book &quot;Bright Candles&quot; as well as in Lois Lowry&#x27;s book &quot;Number the Stars&quot;. The contemporary patriotic song &quot;Der rider en Konge&quot; (&quot;There Rides a King&quot;) centers on the King&#x27;s rides. In this song, the narrator replies to a foreigner&#x27;s inquiry about the King&#x27;s lack of a guard that &quot;he is our freest man&quot; and that the King is not shielded by physical force but that &quot;hearts guard the king of Denmark.&quot;

Another popular, but apocryphal, legend carried by the American press concerned the supposed flying of the German flag over the Hotel d&#x27;Angleterre (then being used as the German military headquarters in Copenhagen). The King, riding by and seeing the flag, told a German sentry that it was a violation of the armistice agreement and that the flag must be taken down. The sentry replied that this would not be done. The King then said that if the flag was not taken down, he would send a Danish soldier to take it down. The sentry responded, &quot;The soldier will be shot.&quot; The King replied, &quot;the Danish soldier will be me.&quot; According to the story, the flag was taken down.

King Christian X became the hero of a number of myths about his defense of the Danish Jews. He became the subject of a persistent urban legend according to which, during Nazi occupation, Nazis forced the Jews to wear the Star of David and the king donned the Star of David himself as a symbol of solidarity with them. However, in Denmark, unlike other Nazi-controlled territories, Jews were never forced to wear the Star of David. The legend likely stems from a 1942 British report that claimed he threatened to don the star if this was forced upon Danish Jews, and was popularised when it was included in Leon Uris&#x27;s best-selling novel &quot;Exodus&quot;.

It is true, however, that the King intended to wear the star in case the Danish Jews were forced to do so. In his personal diary, he wrote this entry: &quot;When you look at the inhumane treatment of Jews, not only in Germany but occupied countries as well, you start worrying that such a demand might also be put on us, but we must clearly refuse such this due to their protection under the Danish constitution. I stated that I could not meet such a demand towards Danish citizens. If such a demand is made, we would best meet it by all wearing the Star of David.&quot;

The myth may originate from a Swedish newspaper cartoon, in which the King is asked what to do if Nazi-supported prime minister Erik Scavenius makes the Jews wear yellow stars. The King replied that in that case, all Danes would have to wear such stars.

<text>In cognitive linguistics, conceptual metaphor, or cognitive metaphor, refers to the understanding of one idea, or conceptual domain, in terms of another. An example of this is the understanding of quantity in terms of directionality (e.g. &quot;the price of peace is &quot;rising&quot;&quot;) or the understanding of time in terms of money (e.g. &quot;I &quot;spent&quot; time at work today&quot;).

A conceptual domain can be any mental organization of human experience. The regularity with which different languages employ the same metaphors, often perceptually based, has led to the hypothesis that the mapping between conceptual domains corresponds to neural mappings in the brain. This theory gained wide attention in the 1990s and early 2000s, although some researchers question its empirical accuracy.

The conceptual metaphor theory proposed by George Lakoff and his colleagues arose from linguistics, but became of interest to cognitive scientists due to its claims about the mind, the brain and their connections to the body. There is empirical evidence that supports the claim that at least some metaphors are conceptual. However, the empirical evidence for some aspects of the theory has been mixed. It is generally agreed that metaphors form an important part of human verbal conceptualization, but there is disagreement about the more specific claims conceptual metaphor theory makes about metaphor comprehension. For instance, metaphoric expressions of the form &quot;X is a Y&quot; (e.g. &quot;My job is a jail&quot;) may not activate conceptual mappings in the same way that other metaphoric expressions do. Furthermore, evidence suggests that the links between the body and conceptual metaphor, while present, may not be as extreme as some conceptual metaphor theorists have suggested. 

Furthermore, certain claims from early conceptual metaphor theory have not been borne out. For instance, Lakoff asserted that human metaphorical thinking seems to work effortlessly,
but psychological research on comprehension (as opposed, for example, to invention) has found that metaphors are actually more difficult to process than non-metaphoric expressions. Furthermore, when metaphors lose their novelty and become conventionalized, they eventually lose their status as metaphors and become processed like ordinary words (an instance of grammaticalization). Therefore, the role of the conceptual metaphor in processing human thinking is more limited than what was claimed by some linguistic theories.

== Background ==
The idea of conceptual metaphors as being the basis of rational thinking, and a detailed examination of the underlying processes, was first extensively explored by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson in their work &quot;Metaphors We Live By&quot; in 1980. Since then, the field of metaphor studies within the larger discipline of cognitive linguistics has increasingly developed, with several annual academic conferences, scholarly societies, and research labs contributing to the subject area. Some researchers, such as Gerard Steen, have worked to develop empirical investigative tools for metaphor research, including the Metaphor Identification Procedure, or MIP. In Psychology, Raymond W. Gibbs, Jr., has investigated conceptual metaphor and embodiment through a number of psychological experiments. Other cognitive scientists, for example Gilles Fauconnier, study subjects similar to conceptual metaphor under the labels &quot;analogy&quot;, &quot;conceptual blending&quot; and &quot;ideasthesia&quot;.

Conceptual metaphors are useful for understanding complex ideas in simple terms and therefore are frequently used to give insight to abstract theories and models. For example, the conceptual metaphor of viewing communication as a conduit is one large theory explained with a metaphor. So not only is our everyday communication shaped by the language of conceptual metaphors, but so is the very way we understand scholarly theories. These metaphors are prevalent in communication and we do not just use them in language; we actually perceive and act in accordance with the metaphors.

== Criticism and perspectives ==
=== Historical ===
In the Western philosophical tradition, Aristotle is often situated as the first commentator on the nature of metaphor, writing in the &quot;Poetics&quot;, &quot;A &#x27;metaphorical term&#x27; involves the transferred use of a term that properly belongs to something else,&quot; and elsewhere in the &quot;Rhetoric&quot; he says that metaphors make learning pleasant; &quot;To learn easily is naturally pleasant to all people, and words signify something, so whatever words create knowledge in us are the pleasantest.&quot; Aristotle&#x27;s writings on metaphor constitute a &quot;substitution view&quot; of metaphor, wherein a metaphor is simply a decorative word or phrase substituted for a more ordinary one. This has been sometimes called the &quot;Traditional View of Metaphor&quot; and at other times the &quot;Classical Theory of Metaphor&quot;. Later in the first century A.D., the Roman rhetorician Quintilian builds upon Aristotle&#x27;s earlier work of metaphor by focusing more on the comparative function of metaphorical language. In his work &quot;Institutio Oratoria,&quot; Quintilian states,&quot; In totum autem metaphora brevior est similitudo&quot; or &quot;on the whole, metaphor is a shorter form of simile&quot;. Other philosophers throughout history have lent their perspectives to the discussion of metaphor as well. Friedrich Nietzsche for example, claimed that language as a whole did not portray reality but instead made a series of bold metaphors. Nietzsche believed that each step of cognition, the transfer of real world information to nerve stimuli, the culmination of nerve stimuli into mental images, the translation of mental images to words, was metaphorical. Modern interpretations of these early theories have also been intensely debated. Janet Soskice, Professor of Philosophical Theology at the University of Cambridge, writes in summary that &quot;it is certain that we shall taste the freshness of their insights only if we free them from the obligation to answer questions that were never theirs to ask&quot;. George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, although originally taking a hard-line interpretation of these early authors later concede that Aristotle was working within a different philosophical framework from what we engage with today and that critical interpretations should take this in to account.

=== Modern ===
In his 2007 book &quot;The Stuff of Thought&quot;, cognitive scientist Steven Pinker lays out several useful classifications for the study of conceptual metaphor. Pinker first contrasts two perspectives on metaphor, what he calls the killjoy theory and the messianic theory. The killjoy theory categorizes metaphors as &quot;dead&quot;, that is it asserts that modern day speakers are not aware of the comparison made between source and target domains in the everyday metaphors they use. For example, many are not cognizant that the phrase &quot;to come to a head&quot; refers to the accumulation of pus in a pimple. In contrast, the messianic theory correlates more closely with Lakoff and Johnson&#x27;s idea of a conceptual metaphor. This view states that users of metaphors are aware of how the metaphor maps onto the domains and use them to relate shared perceptual experiences to more complex thoughts.

Another important distinction made by Pinker is that between literary, or poetic metaphors, and conceptual, or generative metaphors. Poetic metaphors are used for a variety of reasons but ultimately highlight similarities or incongruencies in an expressive manner. Pinker&#x27;s example of this being the classic Shakespearian line &quot;Juliet is the sun&quot;. These metaphors can often appear convoluted or unclear without deeper context. Conceptual metaphors result from some inherent relation between two domains. These metaphors, so innate they are considered cliche, are interestingly able to generate infinite new metaphors. For example, thinking back on the conceptual metaphor , one can build many new metaphors such as &quot;I shot him down&quot; or &quot;he blew my argument to pieces&quot;.

Pinker himself settles on a moderate view that falls in between the messianic and killjoy theories on metaphor. Perhaps most interestingly, while Pinker concedes that metaphor is a useful way to combat the limited ability of language to express thought, he postulates that a higher level of abstract thought must still be present. Otherwise, Pinker points out, how could we engage in critique of metaphors or employ metaphors for comedic effect?

Major criticisms of work done on conceptual metaphor stem from the way many researchers conduct their research. Many study metaphors in a &quot;top-down&quot; direction, looking first at a few examples to suggest conceptual metaphors, then examining the structure of those metaphors. Researchers would look at their own lexicon, dictionaries, thesauri, and other corpora to study metaphors in language. Critics say this ignored the way language was actually used and focused too much on the hypothetical metaphors, so many irregularities were overlooked in favor of postulating universal conceptual metaphors. In 2007, Pragglejaz Group came up with a methodology for identifying metaphorical expressions as a response to these criticisms.

== Mappings ==
There are two main roles for the conceptual domains posited in conceptual metaphors:
* Source domain: the conceptual domain from which we draw metaphorical expressions (e.g., love is a &quot;journey&quot;).
* Target domain: the conceptual domain that we try to understand (e.g., &quot;love&quot; is a journey).

A mapping is the way in which a source domain tracks onto and describes aspects of the target domain. Mappings describe the mental organization of information in domains, the underlying phenomenon that drives metaphorical usage in language. This conceptualization relates closely to image schemas, mental representations used in reasoning, through the extension of spatial and physical laws to more complex situations.

A primary tenet of this theory is that metaphors are matter of thought and not merely of language: hence, the term &quot;conceptual metaphor&quot;. The metaphor may seem to consist of words or other linguistic expressions that come from the terminology of the more concrete conceptual domain, but conceptual metaphors underlie a system of related metaphorical expressions that appear on the linguistic surface. Similarly, the mappings of a conceptual metaphor are themselves motivated by image schemas which are pre-linguistic schemas concerning space, time, moving, controlling, and other core elements of embodied human experience.

Conceptual metaphors typically employ a more abstract concept as target and a more concrete or physical concept as their source. For instance, metaphors such as &#x27;the days [the more abstract or target concept] ahead&#x27; or &#x27;giving my time&#x27; rely on more concrete concepts, thus expressing time as a path into physical space, or as a substance that can be handled and offered as a gift. Different conceptual metaphors tend to be invoked when the speaker is trying to make a case for a certain point of view or course of action. For instance, one might associate &quot;the days ahead&quot; with leadership, whereas the phrase &quot;giving my time&quot; carries stronger connotations of bargaining. Selection of such metaphors tends to be directed by a subconscious or implicit habit in the mind of the person employing them.

The principle of unidirectionality states that the metaphorical process typically goes from the more concrete to the more abstract, and not the other way around. Accordingly, abstract concepts are understood in terms of prototype concrete processes. The term &quot;concrete,&quot; in this theory, has been further specified by Lakoff and Johnson as more closely related to the developmental, physical neural, and interactive body (see embodied philosophy). One manifestation of this view is found in the cognitive science of mathematics, where it is proposed that mathematics itself, the most widely accepted means of abstraction in the human community, is largely metaphorically constructed, and thereby reflects a cognitive bias unique to humans that uses embodied prototypical processes (e.g. counting, moving along a path) that are understood by all human beings through their experiences.

== Conduit metaphor ==
The conduit metaphor is a dominant class of figurative expressions used when discussing communication itself (metalanguage). It operates whenever people speak or write as if they &quot;insert&quot; their mental contents (feelings, meanings, thoughts, concepts, etc.) into &quot;containers&quot; (words, phrases, sentences, etc.) whose contents are then &quot;extracted&quot; by listeners and readers. Thus, language is viewed as a &quot;conduit&quot; conveying mental content between people.

Defined and described by linguist Michael J. Reddy, PhD, his proposal of this conceptual metaphor refocused debate within and outside the linguistic community on the importance of metaphorical language.

== Language and culture as mappings ==
In their 1980 work, Lakoff and Johnson closely examined a collection of basic conceptual metaphors, including:
* 
* 

The latter half of each of these phrases invokes certain assumptions about concrete experience and requires the reader or listener to apply them to the preceding abstract concepts of love or organizing in order to understand the sentence in which the conceptual metaphor is used.

There are numerous ways in which conceptual metaphors shape human perception and communication, especially in mass media and in public policy. Recent experiments by Thibodeau and Boroditsky substantiate this line of thought, termed &quot;framing&quot;. In the experiments, conceptual metaphors that compared crime to either a beast or a disease had drastic effects on public policy opinions.

Conceptual metaphors are commonplace in language. George Lakoff and Mark Johnson suggest that metaphors may unconsciously shape the way we think and act in their founding work, &quot;Metaphors We Live By&quot; (1980). For example, take the commonly used conceptual metaphor, . This metaphor shapes our language in the way we view argument as a battle to be won. It is not uncommon to hear someone say &quot;He won that argument&quot; or &quot;I attacked every weak point in his argument&quot;. The very way argument is conceptualized is shaped by this metaphor of arguments being a war. Argument can be seen in other ways than a battle, but we use this concept to shape the way we think of argument and the way we go about arguing. The same applies for the other conceptual metaphors.

Similarly, Colin Murray Turbayne suggested in his &quot;The Myth of Metaphor&quot; (1962) that ancient &quot;dead metaphors&quot; have also influenced the evolution over time of modern scientific theories in a subtle manner. As examples of mankind&#x27;s victimization by dead metaphors, Turbayne points to the incorporation of mechanistic metaphors first developed by Isaac Newton and René Descartes into modern theories developed by philosophers including: Immanuel Kant, George Berkeley and David Hume. In his &quot;Metaphors for the Mind: The Creative Mind and Its Origins&quot; (1991), he also points to the manner in which metaphors first found in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Timaeus&quot; have exerted a profound influence upon the development of modern theories of both thought and language in general.

Lakoff and Johnson focus on English, and cognitive scholars writing in English have tended not to investigate the discourse of foreign languages in any great detail to determine the creative ways in which individuals negotiate, resist, and consolidate conceptual metaphors. Andrew Goatly in his book &quot;Washing the Brain&quot; (2007) considers ideological conceptual metaphors as well as Chinese conceptual metaphors.

James W. Underhill, a modern Humboldtian scholar, attempts to reestablish Wilhelm von Humboldt&#x27;s concern for the different ways languages frame reality, and the strategies individuals adopt in creatively resisting and modifying existing patterns of thought. Taking on board the Lakoff-Johnson paradigm of conceptual metaphor, he investigates the way in which Czech communists appropriated the concept of the people, the state and struggle, and the way German Communists harnessed concepts of eternity and purity. He also reminds us that, as Klemperer demonstrates, resisting patterns of thought means engaging in conceptual metaphors and refusing the logic that ideologies impose upon them. In multilingual studies (based on Czech, German, French &amp; English), Underhill considers how different cultures reformulate key concepts such as truth, love, hate and war.

== Family roles and ethics ==
George Lakoff makes similar claims on the overlap of conceptual metaphors, culture, and society in his book &quot;Moral Politics&quot; and his later book on framing, &quot;Don&#x27;t Think of an Elephant!.&quot; Lakoff claims that the public political arena in America reflects a basic conceptual metaphor of &#x27;the family.&#x27; Accordingly, people understand political leaders in terms of &#x27;strict father&#x27; and &#x27;nurturant mother&#x27; roles. Two basic views of political economy arise from this desire to see the nation-state act &#x27;more like a father&#x27; or &#x27;more like a mother.&#x27; He further amplified these views in his latest book, &quot;The Political Mind.&quot;

Urban theorist and ethicist Jane Jacobs made this distinction in less gender-driven terms by differentiating between a &#x27;Guardian Ethic&#x27; and a &#x27;Trader Ethic&#x27;. She states that guarding and trading are two concrete activities that human beings must learn to apply metaphorically to all choices in later life. In a society where guarding children is the primary female duty and trading in a market economy is the primary male duty, Lakoff posits that children assign the &#x27;guardian&#x27; and &#x27;trader&#x27; roles to their mothers and fathers, respectively.

== Linguistics and politics ==
Lakoff, Johnson, and Pinker are among the many cognitive scientists that devote a significant amount of time to current events and political theory, suggesting that respected linguists and theorists of conceptual metaphor may tend to channel their theories into political realms.

Critics of this ethics-driven approach to language tend to accept that idioms reflect underlying conceptual metaphors, but that actual grammar, and the more basic cross-cultural concepts of scientific method and mathematical practice tend to minimize the impact of metaphors. Such critics tend to see Lakoff and Jacobs as &#x27;left-wing figures,&#x27; and would not accept their politics as any kind of crusade against an ontology embedded in language and culture, but rather, as an idiosyncratic pastime, not part of the science of linguistics nor of much use. And others further, such as Deleuze and Guattari, Michel Foucault and, more recently, Manuel de Landa would criticize both of these two positions for mutually constituting the same old ontological ideology that would try to separate two parts of a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.

Lakoff&#x27;s 1987 work, &quot;Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things,&quot; answered some of these criticisms before they were even made: he explores the effects of cognitive metaphors (both culturally specific and human-universal) on the grammar per se of several languages, and the evidence of the limitations of the classical logical-positivist or Anglo-American School philosophical concept of the category usually used to explain or describe the scientific method. Lakoff&#x27;s reliance on empirical scientific evidence, &quot;i.e.&quot; specifically falsifiable predictions, in the 1987 work and in &quot;Philosophy in the Flesh&quot; (1999) suggests that the cognitive-metaphor position has no objections to the scientific method, but instead considers the scientific method a finely developed reasoning system used to discover phenomena which are subsequently understood in terms of new conceptual metaphors (such as the metaphor of fluid motion for conducted electricity, which is described in terms of &quot;current&quot; &quot;flowing&quot; against &quot;impedance,&quot; or the gravitational metaphor for static-electric phenomena, or the &quot;planetary orbit&quot; model of the atomic nucleus and electrons, as used by Niels Bohr).

Further, partly in response to such criticisms, Lakoff and Rafael E. Núñez, in 2000, proposed a cognitive science of mathematics that would explain mathematics as a consequence of, not an alternative to, the human reliance on conceptual metaphor to understand abstraction in terms of basic experiential concretes.

==Literature==
The Linguistic Society of America has argued that &quot;the most recent linguistic approach to literature is that of cognitive metaphor, which claims that metaphor is not a mode of language, but a mode of thought. Metaphors project structures from source domains of schematized bodily or enculturated experience into abstract target domains. We conceive the abstract idea of life in terms of our experiences of a journey, a year, or a day. We do not understand Robert Frost&#x27;s &#x27;Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening&#x27; to be about a horse-and-wagon journey but about life. We understand Emily Dickinson&#x27;s &#x27;Because I could not stop for Death&#x27; as a poem about the end of the human life span, not a trip in a carriage. This work is redefining the critical notion of imagery. Perhaps for this reason, cognitive metaphor has significant promise for some kind of rapprochement between linguistics and literary study.&quot;

==Education==
Teaching thinking by analogy (metaphor) is one of the main themes of The Private Eye Project. The idea of encouraging use of conceptual metaphors can also be seen in other educational programs touting the cultivation of &quot;critical thinking skills&quot;.

The work of political scientist Rūta Kazlauskaitė examines metaphorical models in school-history knowledge of the controversial Polish-Lithuanian past. On the basis of Lakoff and Johnson&#x27;s conceptual metaphor theory, she shows how the implicit metaphorical models of everyday experience, which inform the abstract conceptualization of the past, truth, objectivity, knowledge, and multiperspectivity in the school textbooks, obstruct an understanding of the divergent narratives of past experience.

==Language learning==
There is some evidence that an understanding of underlying conceptual metaphors can aid the retention of vocabulary for people learning a foreign language. To improve learners&#x27; awareness of conceptual metaphor, one monolingual learner&#x27;s dictionary, the Macmillan English Dictionary has introduced 50 or so &#x27;metaphor boxes&#x27; covering the most salient Lakoffian metaphors in English. For example, the dictionary entry for &quot;conversation&quot; includes a box with the heading: &#x27;A conversation is like a journey, with the speakers going from one place to another&#x27;, followed by vocabulary items (words and phrases) which embody this metaphorical schema. Language teaching experts are beginning to explore the relevance of conceptual metaphor to how learners learn and what teachers do in the classroom.

==Mapping in animals==
A current study showed a natural tendency to systematically map an abstract dimension, such as social status, in our closest and non-linguistic relatives, the chimpanzees. In detail, discrimination performances between familiar conspecific faces were systematically modulated by the spatial location and the social status of the presented individuals, leading to discrimination facilitation or deterioration. High-ranked individuals presented at spatially higher position and low-ranked individuals presented at lower position led to discrimination facilitation, while high-ranked individuals at lower positions and low-ranked individuals at higher position led to discrimination deterioration. This suggests that this tendency had already evolved in the common ancestors of humans and chimpanzees and is not uniquely human, but describes a conceptual metaphorical mapping that predates language.

<text>Cognitive linguistics is an interdisciplinary branch of linguistics, combining knowledge and research from cognitive science, cognitive psychology, neuropsychology and linguistics. Models and theoretical accounts of cognitive linguistics are considered as psychologically real, and research in cognitive linguistics aims to help understand cognition in general and is seen as a road into the human mind. 

There has been scientific and terminological controversy around the label &quot;cognitive linguistics&quot;; there is no consensus on what specifically is meant with the term.

== Background ==
The roots of cognitive linguistics are in Noam Chomsky&#x27;s 1959 critical review of B. F. Skinner&#x27;s &quot;Verbal Behavior&quot;. Chomsky&#x27;s rejection of behavioural psychology and his subsequent anti-behaviourist activity helped bring about a shift of focus from empiricism to mentalism in psychology under the new concepts of cognitive psychology and cognitive science.

Chomsky considered linguistics as a subfield of cognitive science in the 1970s but called his model transformational or generative grammar. Having been engaged with Chomsky in the linguistic wars, George Lakoff united in the early 1980s with Ronald Langacker and other advocates of neo-Darwinian linguistics in a so-called &quot;Lakoff–Langacker agreement&quot;. It is suggested that they picked the name &quot;cognitive linguistics&quot; for their new framework to undermine the reputation of generative grammar as a cognitive science.

Consequently, there are three competing approaches that today consider themselves as true representatives of cognitive linguistics. One is the Lakoffian–Langackerian brand with capitalised initials (Cognitive Linguistics). The second is generative grammar, while the third approach is proposed by scholars whose work falls outside the scope of the other two. They argue that cognitive linguistics should not be taken as the name of a specific selective framework, but as a whole field of scientific research that is assessed by its evidential rather than theoretical value.

== Approaches ==

===Generative grammar===

Generative grammar functions as a source of hypotheses about language computation in the mind and brain. It is argued to be the study of &#x27;the cognitive neuroscience of language&#x27;. Generative grammar studies behavioural instincts and the biological nature of cognitive-linguistic algorithms, providing a computational–representational theory of mind.

This in practice means that sentence analysis by linguists is taken as a way to uncover cognitive structures. It is argued that a random genetic mutation in humans has caused syntactic structures to appear in the mind. Therefore, the fact that people have language does not rely on its communicative purposes.

For a famous example, it was argued by linguist Noam Chomsky that sentences of the type &quot;Is the man who is hungry ordering dinner&quot; are so rare that it is unlikely that children will have heard them. Since they can nonetheless produce them, it was further argued that the structure is not learned but &quot;acquired&quot; from an innate cognitive language component. Generative grammarians then took as their task to find out all about innate structures through introspection in order to form a picture of the hypothesised language faculty. 

Generative grammar promotes a modular view of the mind, considering language as an autonomous mind module. Thus, language is separated from mathematical logic to the extent that inference cannot explain language acquisition. The generative conception of human cognition is also influential in cognitive psychology and computer science.

===Cognitive Linguistics (linguistics framework)===

One of the approaches to cognitive linguistics is called Cognitive Linguistics, with capital initials, but it is also often spelled cognitive linguistics with all lowercase letters. This movement saw its beginning in early 1980s when George Lakoff&#x27;s metaphor theory was united with Ronald Langacker&#x27;s cognitive grammar, with subsequent models of construction grammar following from various authors. The union entails two different approaches to linguistic and cultural evolution: that of the conceptual metaphor, and the construction. 

Cognitive Linguistics defines itself in opposition to generative grammar, arguing that language functions in the brain according to general cognitive principles. Lakoff&#x27;s and Langacker&#x27;s ideas are applied across sciences. In addition to linguistics and translation theory, Cognitive Linguistics is influential in literary studies, education, sociology, musicology, computer science and theology.

====Conceptual metaphor theory====

According to American linguist George Lakoff, &quot;metaphors&quot; are not just figures of speech, but modes of thought. Lakoff hypothesises that principles of abstract reasoning may have evolved from visual thinking and mechanisms for representing spatial relations that are present in lower animals. Conceptualisation is regarded as being based on the &quot;embodiment&quot; of knowledge, building on physical experience of vision and motion. For example, the &#x27;metaphor&#x27; of emotion builds on downward motion while the metaphor of reason builds on upward motion, as in saying “The discussion &quot;fell&quot; to the emotional level, but I &quot;raised it back up&quot; to the rational plane.&quot; It is argued that language does not form an independent cognitive function but fully relies on other cognitive skills which include perception, attention, motor skills, and visual and spatial processing. Same is said of various other cognitive phenomena such as the sense of time:

::&quot;In our visual systems, we have detectors for motion and detectors for objects/locations. We do not have detectors for time (whatever that could mean). Thus, it makes good biological sense that time should be understood in terms of things and motion.&quot; —George Lakoff

In Cognitive Linguistics, thinking is argued to be mainly automatic and unconscious. Cognitive linguists study the embodiment of knowledge by seeking expressions which relate to modal schemas. For example, in the expression &quot;It is quarter to eleven&quot;, the preposition &quot;to&quot; represents a modal schema which is manifested in language as a visual or sensorimotoric &#x27;metaphor&#x27;.

====Cognitive and construction grammar====

&quot;Constructions&quot;, as the basic units of grammar, are conventionalised form–meaning pairings which are comparable to memes as units of linguistic evolution. These are considered multi-layered. For example, idioms are higher-level constructions which contain words as middle-level constructions, and these may contain morphemes as lower-level constructions. It is argued that humans do not only share the same body type, allowing a common ground for embodied representations; but constructions provide common ground for uniform expressions within a speech community. Like biological organisms, constructions have life cycles which are studied by linguists.

According to the cognitive and &quot;constructionist&quot; view, there is no grammar in the traditional sense of the word. What is commonly perceived as grammar is an inventory of constructions; a complex adaptive system; or a population of constructions. Constructions are studied in all fields of language research from language acquisition to corpus linguistics.

===Integrative cognitive linguistics===

There is also a third approach to cognitive linguistics, which neither directly supports the modular (Generative Grammar) nor the anti-modular (Cognitive Linguistics) view of the mind. Proponents of the third view argue that, according to brain research, language processing is specialized although not autonomous from other types of information processing. Language is thought of as one of the human cognitive abilities, along with perception, attention, memory, motor skills, and visual and spatial processing, rather than being subordinate to them. Emphasis is laid on a cognitive semantics that studies the contextual–conceptual nature of meaning.

== Computational approaches ==

===Cognitive perspective on natural language processing===
Cognitive linguistics offers a scientific first principle direction for quantifying states-of-mind through natural language processing. As mentioned earlier Cognitive Linguistics, approaches grammar with a nontraditional view. Traditionally grammar has been defined as a set of structural rules governing the composition of clauses, phrases and words in a natural language. From the perspective of Cognitive Linguistics, grammar is seen as the rules of arrangement of language which best serve communication of the experience of the human organism through its cognitive skills which include perception, attention, motor skills, and visual and spatial processing. Such rules are derived from observing the conventionalized pairings of meaning to understand sub-context in the evolution of language patterns. The cognitive approach to identifying sub-context by observing what comes before and after each linguistic construct provides a grounding of meaning in terms of sensorimotoric embodied experience. When taken together, these two perspectives form the basis of defining approaches in computational linguistics with strategies to work through the symbol grounding problem which posits that, for a computer, a word is merely a symbol, which is a symbol for another symbol and so on in an unending chain without grounding in human experience. The broad set of tools and methods of computational linguistics are available as natural language processing or NLP. Cognitive linguistics adds a new set of capabilities to NLP. These cognitive NLP methods enable software to analyze sub-context in terms of internal embodied experience. 

===Methods===
The goal of natural language processing (NLP) is to enable a computer to &quot;understand&quot; the contents of text and documents, including the contextual nuances of the language within them. 
The perspective of traditional Traditional Chomskyan Linguistics offers NLP three approaches or methods to identify and quantify the literal contents, the who, what, where and when in text – in linguistic terms, the semantic meaning or semantics of the text. The perspective of cognitive linguistics offers NLP a direction to identify and quantify the contextual nuances, the why and how in text – in linguistics terms, the implied pragmatic meaning or pragmatics of text.

The three NLP approaches to understanding literal semantics in text based on traditional linguistics are symbolic NLP, statistical NLP, and neural NLP. The first method, symbolic NLP (1950s – early 1990s) is based on first principles and rules of traditional linguistics. The second method, statistical NLP (1990s–2010s), builds upon the first method with a layer of human curated &amp; machine-assisted corpora for multiple contexts. The third approach neural NLP (2010 onwards), builds upon the earlier methods by leveraging advances in deep neural network-style methods to automate tabulation of corpora &amp; parse models for multiple contexts in shorter periods of time. All three methods are used to power NLP techniques like stemming and lemmatisation in order to obtain statistically relevant listing of the who, what, where &amp; when in text through named-entity recognition and Topic model programs. The same methods have been applied with NLP techniques like a bag-of-words model to obtain statistical measures of emotional context through sentiment analysis programs. The accuracy of a sentiment analysis system is, in principle, how well it agrees with human judgments. Because evaluation of sentiment analysis is becoming more and more specialty based, each implementation needs a separate training model and specialized human verification raising Inter-rater reliability issues. However, the accuracy is considered generally acceptable for use in evaluating emotional context at a statistical or group level. 

A developmental trajectory of NLP to understand contextual pragmatics in text involving emulating intelligent behavior and apparent comprehension of natural language is cognitive NLP. This method is a rules based approach which involves assigning meaning to a word, phrase, sentence or piece of text based on the information presented before and after the piece of text being analyzed.

== Controversy ==
The specific meaning of cognitive linguistics, the proper address of the name, and the scientific status of the enterprise have been called into question. Criticism includes an overreliance on introspective data, a lack of experimental testing of hypotheses and little integration of findings from other fields of cognitive science.
Some researchers go as far as to consider calling the field &#x27;cognitive&#x27; at all a misnomer.

There has been criticism regarding the brain-related claims of both Chomsky&#x27;s generative grammar, and Lakoff&#x27;s Cognitive Linguistics. These are said to advocate too extreme views on the axis of modular versus general processing. The empirical evidence points to language being partially specialized and interacting with other systems. However, to counter behaviorism, Chomsky postulated that language acquisition occurs inside an autonomous module, which he calls the language faculty, thus suggesting a very high degree of specialization of language in the brain. To offer an alternative to his view, Lakoff, in turn, postulated the opposite by claiming that language acquisition is not specialized at all because language does not constitute a cognitive capacity of its own but occurs in the sensory domains such as vision and kinesthesis. According to the critical view, these ideas were not motivated by brain research but by a struggle for power in linguistics. Members of such frameworks are also said to have used other researchers&#x27; findings to present them as their own work. While this criticism is accepted for most part, it is claimed that some of the research has nonetheless produced useful insights.

<text>In functional-cognitive linguistics, as well as in semiotics, iconicity is the conceived or analogy between the form of a sign (linguistic or otherwise) and its meaning, as opposed to arbitrariness (which is typically assumed in structuralist, formalist and generative approaches to linguistics). The principle of iconicity is also shared by the approach of linguistic typology.

Iconic principles:
*Quantity principle: conceptual complexity corresponds to formal complexity
*Proximity principle: conceptual distance tends to match with linguistic distance
*Sequential order principle: the sequential order of events described is mirrored in the speech chain

==Quantity principle==
The use of quantity of phonetic material to iconically mark increased quality or quantity can be noted in the lengthening of words to indicate a greater degree, such as &quot;&quot;. It is also common to use reduplication to iconically mark increase, as Edward Sapir is quoted, “The process is generally employed, with self-evident symbolism, to indicate such concepts as distribution, plurality, repetition, customary activity, increase of size, added intensity, continuance” (1921:79). This has been confirmed by the comparative studies of Key (1965) and Moravcsik (1978). This can be seen, for example, in Amharic, where &#x27; means &quot;it was broken&quot; and &#x27; means that &quot;it was shattered&quot;.

Iconic coding principles may be natural tendencies in language and are also part of our cognitive and biological make-up. Whether iconicity is a part of language is an open debate in linguistics. For instance, Haspelmath has argued against iconicity, claiming that most iconic phenomena can be explained by frequency biases: since simpler meanings tend to be more frequent in the language use they tend to lose phonological material.

Onomatopoeia (and mimesis more broadly) may be seen as a kind of iconicity, though even onomatopoeic sounds have a large degree of arbitrariness.

==The evolution of language==
Derek Bickerton has posited that iconic signs, both verbal and gestural, were crucial in the evolution of human language. Animal communication systems, Bickerton has argued, are largely composed of indexical (and, occasionally, iconic) signs, whereas in human language, &quot;most words are symbolic, and ... without symbolic words we couldn’t have language&quot;. The distinction Bickerton draws between these categories is one of displacement, with the indexical signs of animal communication systems having no capacity for displacement, and the symbolic signs of human language requiring it. Iconic signs, however, &quot;may or may not have it depending on how they’re used ... iconicity, therefore, is the most probable road that our ancestors took into language&quot;.

Using a niche-construction view of human evolution, Bickerton has hypothesized that human ancestors used iconic signs as recruitment signals in the scavenging of dead megafauna. This process &quot;would have created new words and deployed old words in new contexts, further weakening the uncoupling of words from situations, from current occurrence—even from fitness&quot;, and thus allowing for the creation of symbolic language.

In &quot;The Symbolic Species&quot;, Terrence Deacon argues that the emanation of symbolic capacities unique to language was a critical factor in the evolution of the human brain, and that these symbolic capacities are vital to differentiating animal from human forms of communication, processes of learning, and brain anatomy. &quot;The doorway into this virtual world was opened to us alone by the evolution of language, because language is not merely a mode of communication, it is also the outward expression of an unusual mode of thought—symbolic representation.&quot;

==Endophoric and exophoric==
Winfried Nöth distinguishes between endophoric and exophoric iconicity, exophoric where the signifier is iconic with the world beyond language signs, and endophoric where the signifier is iconic to another signifier within language. By endophoric he does not mean &quot;trivial&quot; recurrences like the letter &#x27;e&#x27; in one sentence being iconic with the letter &#x27;e&#x27; in another sentence, which are not iconic signs of one another according to Nöth.

Textual endophoric iconicity can be divided between intratextual and intertextual. An example of intratextual endophoric iconicity is &quot;the various recurrences of the word icon and its derivatives iconic or iconicity...Insofar as the morpheme icon refers back to earlier of its recurrences in the text and the traces of them in our memory, it is an iconic sign. Insofar as these morphemes constitute a coherent pattern of relations which create a line of mentation, they form a diagrammatic icon&quot;. Intertextual iconicity would include things like allusions, quotations etc.

Specific utterances which adhere to the rules of a language are iconic with one another. Phonemes can also be iconic with one another in that they could both be consonants or plosives. Another example is “the relationship
between great, greater, greatest….since the morphological pattern of adjective grading is the same as in loud, louder, loudest”.

==Calls and gestures==
Iconic calls and gestures mimic the forms of the things they stand for (such as outlining shapes or moving your hands back and forth multiple times to show repetition). Iconic calls and gestures are not formally considered language or language-like communication in that they do not contrast or possess arbitrary characteristics. Noises that imitate sounds of the surrounding environment (ideophones) are also iconic. Though humans possess a repertoire of iconic calls and gestures, other mammals produce few iconic signals. Despite this, a few captive chimpanzees have shown the beginning stages of iconicity. Burling &quot;et al.&quot; states: &quot;Chimpanzees in the wild do not point, and rarely do so in captivity, however there is a documented case of one named Kanzi, described by Savage-Rumbaugh et al., who could indicate direction of travel by &quot;extending his hand&quot;. Another chimpanzee, Viki (Hayes and Nissen 1971:107) made motions of kneading or ironing when she wanted to knead dough or iron napkins. Bee dances are another example of iconicity in animal communication systems.

==Sign languages==
Iconicity is often argued to play a large role in the production and perception of gesture. Proposed ways in which iconicity is achieved is through Hands that Act, Embody, Model, and Draw. In sign languages iconicity was often argued to be largely confined to sign formation (comparable to onomatopoeia). Some proponents believe that iconicity does not play an actual role in perception and production of signs once they have undergone phonological reduction and become part of the conventionalized vocabulary. More recently, the possible role of iconicity is being evaluated again. Current research on sign language phonology acknowledges that certain aspects are semantically motivated. Further, the ability to modify sign meaning through phonological changes to signs is gaining attention. The ability to work creatively with sign language in this way has been associated with accomplished, or native signers.

Iconicity is expressed in the grammatical structure of sign languages called classifiers. These are used to give descriptive information about a subject or verb. In American Sign language (ASL) a grammatical marker denoting “intensity” is characterized by a movement pattern with two parts: an initial pause, followed by a quick completion. When this pattern is added to the adjective GOOD, the resulting meaning is VERY-GOOD. The ASL marker for &quot;intensity&quot; is iconic in that the intended meaning (building of pressure, a sudden release) is matched by the articulatory form (a pause, a quick completion).

Like in vocal languages, developmental trends in ASL shy away from iconicity in favor of arbitrariness. These changes &quot;contribute toward symmetry, fluidity, locational displacement and assimilation&quot;. For example, the sign WE used to contain the sign for each individual being described by the WE. So the signer would sign ME + YOU + YOU + YOU + ME. Now the sign has turned into a smooth symbolic sign where the signer makes two touches on the chest, one on each side, with a sweep of the wrist in between.

On the whole, some researchers stress that iconicity plays an important role in sign languages, while others downplay its role. The reason for this also lies in the fact that it was, for a long time, assumed that it is a major property of natural languages that there is no relation between the surface form of a word and its potential referents (thus, there is no relationship between how the word &quot;computer&quot; is pronounced and what a computer, for example, looks like, see also arbitrariness). The idea that iconicity should not play a role in natural languages was, for example, stressed by Charles Hockett. Thus, many linguists concerned with sign languages tried to downplay the role of iconicity in sign languages. It was, however, later acknowledged that iconicity also plays a role in many spoken languages (see, for example Japanese sound symbolism). Today it is often recognized that sign languages exhibit a greater degree of iconicity compared to spoken languages due to the visual natural of sign languages. However, the structure of sign languages also puts limits to the degree of iconicity: From a truly iconic language one would expect that a concept like SMILING would be expressed by mimicking a smile (i.e., by performing a smiling face). All known sign languages, however, do not express the concept of SMILING by a smiling face, but by a manual sign.

==Poetry==
Iconicity often occurs within poetry through the use of onomatopoeia, which may be called auditory iconicity. Sometimes the form of the poem resembles or enacts the poem&#x27;s content, and in this case, a visual iconicity is present. One poet well known for his visual poems, and therefore visual iconicity, is E. E. Cummings. Another poet known for &quot;shape poems&quot; is George Herbert. In his poem &quot;A Wreath&quot; (1633) each line overlaps the next while the rhyme scheme makes a circle, thus mimicking the form of a wreath.
A subset of visual iconicity involves a spatial iconicity. For instance, in Cummings&#x27;s grasshopper poem (&quot;r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r&quot;) the word &quot;arriving&quot; begins on the far right of the poem with the &quot;a&quot;, the &quot;r&quot; is near the middle of the poem, and the rest of the word is on the left of the poem. The reader must travel a great distance across the poem, therefore, in order to &quot;arrive&quot;. The spatial dimension, then, can relate to a temporal dimension. In the poems &quot;The Fish&quot; and &quot;The Moose&quot; by Elizabeth Bishop, temporal iconicity is at work. The amount of time it takes to read &quot;The Fish&quot; coincides with the length of time a fish could live outside of water; likewise, the duration of the long bus ride in &quot;The Moose&quot; coincides with the poem&#x27;s long first sentence as well as the twenty-some stanzas it takes before the passengers on the bus (and the reader) actually encounters the moose.

==Folk etymology==
Iconicity occurs in rejective phono-semantic matching. &quot;Consider Lithuanian Ashkenazic Hebrew רע דם &quot;ra dom&quot; (cf. Yiddish &quot;ra dam&quot;), lit. &#x27;of bad blood&#x27; (from Hebrew רע דם &quot;ra` dam&quot; &#x27;of bad blood&#x27;). This is a toponymic rejective phono-semantic matching of Polish &quot;Radom&quot;, the name of a town in Poland (approximately south of Warsaw), or of its Yiddish adaptation &quot;ródem&quot; (see Uriel Weinreich 1955: 609, Paul Wexler 1991: 42). Thus, if a pogrom had occurred in Radom, it would surely have been rationalized by &quot;ra dam&quot; ‘of bad blood’. Obviously, providing such an etymythological explanation for the pogrom was regarded by some Jews as a mere play on words. However, others might have conceived of &quot;ra dam&quot; as having deep intrinsic truth, which might have been religiously and homiletically based. One should not forget that at that time it was a common belief that all languages were God-created and that Hebrew was the divine &quot;Ursprache&quot;.&quot;

==Language acquisition==
It has been suggested that iconicity can be used in the teaching of languages. There are two ways this has been suggested. The first being “Horizontal-Iconicity” and the second being vowel magnitude relationships. Horizontal-Iconicity is the phenomenon of opposition of meaning and spelling. For example, in Egyptian , which means right hand, and , which means left hand. Because people are more likely to remember things they have more mnemonic tags for, it is suggested that it may be helpful to point these things out in the teaching of language.

==Vowel magnitude==
Vowel magnitude relationships suggest that, the larger the object, the more likely its name has open vowels such as , , and ; the smaller the object, the more likely its name has closed vowel sounds such as , , and . Open vowel sounds are also more likely to be associated with round shapes and dark or gloomy moods, where closed vowel sounds are more likely to be associated with pointed shapes and happy moods.

A test run by Sapir asked subjects to differentiate between two different sized tables using invented word pairs such as &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;mil&quot;. He discovered a word containing was at four times more likely to be judged as larger if paired with a word containing . Nuckolls states: &quot;Newman discovered that ... as the tongue recedes in articulating vowels from the front to the back of the mouth, and as acoustic frequencies become lower, the vowels are judged to be larger and darker&quot;. Bentley and Varron (1933) ran tests asking subjects to differentiate between vowel sounds without providing them, beforehand, contrasting attributes (such as bright and dark.) They found only moderate success rates that decreased when vowel sounds were closer in tone. However, they still found that sounds were judged larger or lower than sounds.

In morphology, examples from degree adjectives, such as long, longer, longest, show that the most extreme degree of length is iconically represented by the word with the greatest number of phonemes. Jakobson cites examples of word order mimicking the natural order of ideas. In fact, iconicity is now widely acknowledged to be a significant factor at many levels of linguistic structure.

<text>Metonymy () is a figure of speech in which a concept is referred to by the name of something closely associated with that thing or concept.

==Etymology==
The words &quot;metonymy&quot; and &quot;metonym&quot; come ; , a suffix that names figures of speech, .

==Background==
Metonymy and related figures of speech are common in everyday speech and writing. Synecdoche and metalepsis are considered specific types of metonymy. Polysemy, the capacity for a word or phrase to have multiple meanings, sometimes results from relations of metonymy. Both metonymy and metaphor involve the substitution of one term for another. In metaphor, this substitution is based on some specific analogy between two things, whereas in metonymy the substitution is based on some understood association or contiguity.

American literary theorist Kenneth Burke considers metonymy as one of four &quot;master tropes&quot;: metaphor, metonymy, synecdoche, and irony. He discusses them in particular ways in his book &quot;A Grammar of Motives&quot;. Whereas Roman Jakobson argued that the fundamental dichotomy in trope was between metaphor and metonymy, Burke argues that the fundamental dichotomy is between irony and synecdoche, which he also describes as the dichotomy between dialectic and representation, or again between reduction and perspective.

In addition to its use in everyday speech, metonymy is a figure of speech in some poetry and in much rhetoric. Greek and Latin scholars of rhetoric made significant contributions to the study of metonymy.

==Meaning relationships==

Metonymy takes many different forms.

Synecdoche uses a part to refer to the whole, or the whole to refer to the part.

Metalepsis uses a familiar word or a phrase in a new context. For example, &quot;lead foot&quot; may describe a fast driver; lead is proverbially heavy, and a foot exerting more pressure on the accelerator causes a vehicle to go faster (in this context unduly so). The figure of speech is a &quot;metonymy of a metonymy&quot;.

Many cases of polysemy originate as metonyms: for example, &quot;chicken&quot; means the meat as well as the animal; &quot;crown&quot; for the object, as well as the institution.

===Versus metaphor===

Metonymy works by the contiguity (association) between two concepts, whereas the term &quot;metaphor&quot; is based upon their analogous similarity. When people use metonymy, they do not typically wish to transfer qualities from one referent to another as they do with metaphor. There is nothing press-like about reporters or crown-like about a monarch, but &quot;the press&quot; and &quot;the crown&quot; are both common metonyms.

Some uses of figurative language may be understood as both metonymy and metaphor; for example, the relationship between &quot;a crown&quot; and a &quot;king&quot; could be interpreted metaphorically (i.e., the king, like his gold crown, could be seemingly stiff yet ultimately malleable, over-ornate, and consistently immobile). In the phrase &quot;lands belonging to the crown&quot;, the word &quot;crown&quot; is a metonymy. The reason is that monarchs by and large indeed wear a crown, physically. In other words, there is a pre-existent link between &quot;crown&quot; and &quot;monarchy&quot;. On the other hand, when Ghil&#x27;ad Zuckermann argues that the Israeli language is a &quot;phoenicuckoo cross with some magpie characteristics&quot;, he is using metaphors. There is no physical link between a language and a bird. The reason the metaphors &quot;phoenix&quot; and &quot;cuckoo&quot; are used is that on the one hand hybridic &quot;Israeli&quot; is based on Hebrew, which, like a phoenix, rises from the ashes; and on the other hand, hybridic &quot;Israeli&quot; is based on Yiddish, which like a cuckoo, lays its egg in the nest of another bird, tricking it to believe that it is its own egg. Furthermore, the metaphor &quot;magpie&quot; is employed because, according to Zuckermann, hybridic &quot;Israeli&quot; displays the characteristics of a magpie, &quot;stealing&quot; from languages such as Arabic and English.

Two examples using the term &quot;fishing&quot; help clarify the distinction. The phrase &quot;to fish pearls&quot; uses metonymy, drawing from &quot;fishing&quot; the idea of taking things from the ocean. What is carried across from &quot;fishing fish&quot; to &quot;fishing pearls&quot; is the domain of metonymy. In contrast, the metaphorical phrase &quot;fishing for information&quot; transfers the concept of fishing into a new domain. If someone is &quot;fishing&quot; for information, we do not imagine that the person is anywhere near the ocean; rather, we transpose elements of the action of fishing (waiting, hoping to catch something that cannot be seen, probing, and most importantly, trying) into a new domain (a conversation). Thus, metaphors work by presenting a target set of meanings and using them to suggest a similarity between items, actions, or events in two domains, whereas metonymy calls up or references a specific domain (here, removing items from the sea).

Sometimes, metaphor and metonymy may both be at work in the same figure of speech, or one could interpret a phrase metaphorically or metonymically. For example, the phrase &quot;lend me your ear&quot; could be analyzed in a number of ways. One could imagine the following interpretations:

*Analyze &quot;ear&quot; metonymically first – &quot;ear&quot; means &quot;attention&quot; (because people use ears to pay attention to each other&#x27;s speech). Now, when we hear the phrase &quot;Talk to him; you have his ear&quot;, it symbolizes he will listen to you or that he will pay attention to you. Another phrase &quot;lending an ear (attention)&quot;, we stretch the base meaning of &quot;lend&quot; (to let someone borrow an object) to include the &quot;lending&quot; of non-material things (attention), but, beyond this slight extension of the verb, no metaphor is at work.
*Imagine the whole phrase literally – imagine that the speaker literally borrows the listener&#x27;s ear as a physical object (and the person&#x27;s head with it). Then the speaker has temporary possession of the listener&#x27;s ear, so the listener has granted the speaker temporary control over what the listener hears. The phrase &quot;lend me your ear&quot; is interpreted to metaphorically mean that the speaker wants the listener to grant the speaker temporary control over what the listener hears.
*First, analyze the verb phrase &quot;lend me your ear&quot; metaphorically to mean &quot;turn your ear in my direction&quot;, since it is known that, literally lending a body part is nonsensical. Then, analyze the motion of ears metonymically – we associate &quot;turning ears&quot; with &quot;paying attention&quot;, which is what the speaker wants the listeners to do.

It is difficult to say which analysis above most closely represents the way a listener interprets the expression, and it is possible that different listeners analyse the phrase in different ways, or even in different ways at different times. Regardless, all three analyses yield the same interpretation. Thus, metaphor and metonymy, though different in their mechanism, work together seamlessly.

===Examples===

Here are some broad kinds of relationships where metonymy is frequently used:
*Containment: When one thing contains another, it can frequently be used metonymically, as when &quot;dish&quot; is used to refer not to a plate but to the food it contains, or as when the name of a building is used to refer to the entity it contains, as when &quot;the White House&quot; or &quot;the Pentagon&quot; are used to refer to the Administration of the United States, or the U.S. Department of Defense, respectively.
*A physical item, place, or body part used to refer to a related concept, such as &quot;the bench&quot; for the judicial profession, &quot;stomach&quot; or &quot;belly&quot; for appetite or hunger, &quot;mouth&quot; for speech, being &quot;in diapers&quot; for infancy, &quot;palate&quot; for taste, &quot;the altar&quot; or &quot;the aisle&quot; for marriage, &quot;hand&quot; for someone&#x27;s responsibility for something (&quot;he had a hand in it&quot;), &quot;head&quot; or &quot;brain&quot; for mind or intelligence, or &quot;nose&quot; for concern about someone else&#x27;s affairs, (as in &quot;keep your nose out of my business&quot;). A reference to Timbuktu, as in &quot;from here to Timbuktu,&quot; usually means a place or idea is too far away or mysterious.
*Tools/instruments: Often a tool is used to signify the job it does or the person who does the job, as in the phrase &quot;his Rolodex is long and valuable&quot; (referring to the Rolodex instrument, which keeps contact business cards, meaning he has a lot of contacts and knows many people). Also &quot;the press&quot; (referring to the printing press), or as in the proverb, &quot;The pen is mightier than the sword.&quot;
*Product for process: This is a type of metonymy where the product of the activity stands for the activity itself. For example, in &quot;The book is moving right along,&quot; &quot;the book&quot; refers to the process of writing or publishing.
*Punctuation marks often stand metonymically for a meaning expressed by the punctuation mark. For example, &quot;He&#x27;s a big &quot;question mark&quot; to me&quot; indicates that something is unknown. In the same way, &#x27;period&#x27; can be used to emphasise that a point is concluded or not to be challenged.
*Synecdoche: A part of something is often used for the whole, as when people refer to &quot;head&quot; of cattle or assistants are referred to as &quot;hands.&quot; An example of this is the Canadian dollar, referred to as the loonie for the image of a bird on the one-dollar coin. United States one hundred-dollar bills are often referred to as &quot;Bens&quot;, &quot;Benjamins&quot; or &quot;Franklins&quot; because they bear a portrait of Benjamin Franklin. Also, the whole of something is used for a part, as when people refer to a municipal employee as &quot;the city&quot; or police officers as &quot;the law&quot;.
*Toponyms: A country&#x27;s capital city or some location within the city is frequently used as a metonym for the country&#x27;s government, such as Washington, D.C., in the United States; Ottawa in Canada; Rome in Italy; Paris in France; Tokyo in Japan; New Delhi in India; London in the United Kingdom; Moscow in Russia, etc. Perhaps the oldest such example is &quot;Pharaoh&quot; which originally referred to the residence of the King of Egypt but by the New Kingdom had come to refer to the king himself. Similarly, other important places, such as Wall Street, K Street, Madison Avenue, Silicon Valley, Hollywood, Vegas, and Detroit are commonly used to refer to the industries that are located there (finance, lobbying, advertising, high technology, entertainment, gambling, and motor vehicles, respectively). Such usage may persist even when the industries in question have moved elsewhere, for example, &quot;Fleet Street&quot; continues to be used as a metonymy for the British national press, though many national publications are no longer headquartered on the street of that name.

====Places and institutions====
A place is often used as a metonym for a government or other official institutions, for example, Brussels for the institutions of the European Union, The Hague for the International Court of Justice or International Criminal Court, Nairobi for the government of Kenya, the Kremlin for the Russian presidency, Chausseestraße and Pullach for the German Federal Intelligence Service, Number 10, Downing Street or Whitehall for the prime minister of the United Kingdom and the UK civil service, the White House and Capitol Hill for the executive and legislative branches, respectively, of the United States federal government, Foggy Bottom for the U.S. State Department, Langley for the Central Intelligence Agency, Quantico for either the Federal Bureau of Investigation academy and forensic laboratory or the Marine Corps base of the same name, Zhongnanhai for the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Malacañang for the President of the Philippines, their advisers and Office of the President, &quot;La Moncloa&quot; for the Prime Minister of Spain, and Vatican for the pope, Holy See and Roman Curia. Other names of addresses or locations can become convenient shorthand names in international diplomacy, allowing commentators and insiders to refer impersonally and succinctly to foreign ministries with impressive and imposing names as (for example) the Quai d&#x27;Orsay, the Wilhelmstrasse, the Kremlin, and the Porte.

A place (or places) can represent an entire industry. For instance: Wall Street, used metonymically, can stand for the entire U.S. financial and corporate banking sector; K Street for Washington, D.C.&#x27;s lobbying industry or lobbying in the United States in general; Hollywood for the U.S. film industry, and the people associated with it; Broadway for the American commercial theatrical industry; Madison Avenue for the American advertising industry; and Silicon Valley for the American technology industry. The High Street (of which there are over 5,000 in Britain) is a term commonly used to refer to the entire British retail sector. Common nouns and phrases can also be metonyms: &quot;red tape&quot; can stand for bureaucracy, whether or not that bureaucracy uses actual red tape to bind documents. In Commonwealth realms, The Crown is a metonym for the state in all its aspects.

In recent Israeli usage, the term &quot;Balfour&quot; came to refer to the Israeli Prime Minister&#x27;s residence, located on Balfour Street in Jerusalem, to all the streets around it where demonstrations frequently take place, and also to the Prime Minister and his family who live in the residence.

==Rhetoric in ancient history==

Western culture studied poetic language and deemed it to be rhetoric. A. Al-Sharafi supports this concept in his book &quot;Textual Metonymy&quot;, &quot;Greek rhetorical scholarship at one time became entirely poetic scholarship.&quot; Philosophers and rhetoricians thought that metaphors were the primary figurative language used in rhetoric. Metaphors served as a better means to attract the audience&#x27;s attention because the audience had to read between the lines in order to get an understanding of what the speaker was trying to say. Others did not think of metonymy as a good rhetorical method because metonymy did not involve symbolism. Al-Sharafi explains, &quot;This is why they undermined practical and purely referential discourse because it was seen as banal and not containing anything new, strange or shocking.&quot;

Greek scholars contributed to the definition of metonymy. For example, Isocrates worked to define the difference between poetic language and non-poetic language by saying that, &quot;Prose writers are handicapped in this regard because their discourse has to conform to the forms and terms used by the citizens and to those arguments which are precise and relevant to the subject-matter.&quot; In other words, Isocrates proposes here that metaphor is a distinctive feature of poetic language because it conveys the experience of the world afresh and provides a kind of defamiliarisation in the way the citizens perceive the world. Democritus described metonymy by saying, &quot;Metonymy, that is the fact that words and meaning change.&quot; Aristotle discussed different definitions of metaphor, regarding one type as what we know to be metonymy today.

Latin scholars also had an influence on metonymy. The treatise &quot;Rhetorica ad Herennium&quot; states metonymy as, &quot;the figure which draws from an object closely akin or associated an expression suggesting the object meant, but not called by its own name.&quot; The author describes the process of metonymy to us saying that we first figure out what a word means. We then figure out that word&#x27;s relationship with other words. We understand and then call the word by a name that it is associated with. &quot;Perceived as such then metonymy will be a figure of speech in which there is a process of abstracting a relation of proximity between two words to the extent that one will be used in place of another.&quot; Cicero viewed metonymy as more of a stylish rhetorical method and described it as being based on words, but motivated by style.

==Jakobson, structuralism and realism==
Metonymy became important in French structuralism through the work of Roman Jakobson. In his 1956 essay &quot;The Metaphoric and Metonymic Poles&quot;, Jakobson relates metonymy to the linguistic practice of [syntagmatic] combination and to the literary practice of realism. He explains:
The primacy of the metaphoric process in the literary schools of Romanticism and symbolism has been repeatedly acknowledged, but it is still insufficiently realized that it is the predominance of metonymy which underlies and actually predetermines the so-called &#x27;realistic&#x27; trend, which belongs to an intermediary stage between the decline of Romanticism and the rise of symbolism and is opposed to both. Following the path of contiguous relationships, the realistic author metonymically digresses from the plot to the atmosphere and from the characters to the setting in space and time. He is fond of synecdochic details. In the scene of Anna Karenina&#x27;s suicide Tolstoy&#x27;s artistic attention is focused on the heroine&#x27;s handbag; and in &quot;War and Peace&quot; the synecdoches &quot;hair on the upper lip&quot; or &quot;bare shoulders&quot; are used by the same writer to stand for the female characters to whom these features belong.

Jakobson&#x27;s theories were important for Claude Lévi-Strauss, Roland Barthes, Jacques Lacan, and others.

Dreams can use metonyms.

==Art==

Metonyms can also be wordless. For example, Roman Jakobson argued that cubist art relied heavily on nonlinguistic metonyms, while surrealist art relied more on metaphors.

Lakoff and Turner argued that all words are metonyms: &quot;Words stand for the concepts they express.&quot; Some artists have used actual words as metonyms in their paintings. For example, Miró&#x27;s 1925 painting &quot;Photo: This is the Color of My Dreams&quot; has the word &quot;photo&quot; to represent the image of his dreams. This painting comes from a series of paintings called peintures-poésies (paintings-poems) which reflect Miró&#x27;s interest in dreams and the subconscious and the relationship of words, images, and thoughts. Picasso, in his 1911 painting &quot;Pipe Rack and Still Life on Table&quot; inserts the word &quot;Ocean&quot; rather than painting an ocean: These paintings by Miró and Picasso are, in a sense, the reverse of a rebus: the word stands for the picture, instead of the picture standing for the word.

<text>The Hari River ( or ; ) or Herat River or Tejen River or Harirud is a river flowing from the mountains of central Afghanistan to Turkmenistan, where it forms the Tejen oasis and disappears in the Karakum Desert. In its lower course, the river forms a northern part of the border between Afghanistan and Iran, and a southeastern part of the border between Turkmenistan and Iran.

The name of the river derives from the Old Persian word Harawaiah &#x27;river rich in water&#x27;.

In Turkmenistan, the Hari is known as the Tejen or Tedzhen river and passes close to the city of Tejen. To the ancient Greeks, it was known as the Arius. In Latin, it was known as the Tarius.

== History ==

One theory suggests that the Rigvedic Sarayu and the Hari are the same river. 

A Buddhist monastery hand-carved in the bluff of the river Harirud existed in the first centuries during the prevalence of Buddhism. The artificial caves revealed testimony of daily life of the Buddhist monks.

==Course==

The river originates in the eastern part of Ghor Province in the Baba mountain range, part of the extensions of Hindu Kush system, and follows a relatively straight course to the west.

Some upstream from Herat, the river meets the Jam River at the site of the Minaret of Jam, the second tallest ancient minaret in the world at .

In western Afghanistan, the Hari Rud flows to the south of Herat. The valley around Herat with the Paropamisus Mountains (&quot;Selseleh-ye Safēd Kōh&quot;) on the right river bank was historically famous for its fertility and dense cultivation. After Herat, the river turns northwest, then north, forming the northern part of the border between Afghanistan and Iran. Farther north it forms the south-eastern part of the border between Iran and Turkmenistan. The Iran–Turkmenistan Friendship Dam is on the river.

Salma Dam, a hydroelectric and irrigation dam project, is located on the Hari Rud in Chishti Sharif District of Herat Province in western Afghanistan.

The average annual discharge of the Hari Rud is about 55 m3/s, but during a spring flood in 1939 the discharge went up to 1090 m3/s.

In 2000, the river dried up completely during a 10-month drought.

== Bridges ==

=== Pulkhatyn Bridge ===
An unused stone-bridge of five arches, this falls in the Ahal Region of Turkmenistan. It is about north of Iran–Turkmenistan Friendship Dam.

Pulkhatyn translates to &quot;wealthy woman.&quot; In Turkmen lore, the custodian of the bridge was a woman who made a fortune by taxing all travelers; Alexander the Great had apparently refused to pay this fee and crossed further downstream.

<text>Categorization is a type of cognition involving conceptual differentiation between characteristics of conscious experience, such as objects, events, or ideas. It involves the abstraction and differentiation of aspects of experience by sorting and distinguishing between groupings, through classification or typification on the basis of traits, features, similarities or other criteria that are universal to the group. Categorization is considered one of the most fundamental cognitive abilities, and it is studied particularly by psychology and cognitive linguistics.

Categorization is sometimes considered synonymous with classification (cf., Classification synonyms). Categorization and classification allow humans to organize things, objects, and ideas that exist around them and simplify their understanding of the world. Categorization is something that humans and other organisms &quot;do&quot;: &quot;doing the right thing with the right kind of thing.&quot; The activity of categorizing things can be nonverbal or verbal. For humans, both concrete objects and abstract ideas are recognized, differentiated, and understood through categorization. Objects are usually categorized for some adaptive or pragmatic purposes.

Categorization is grounded in the features that distinguish the category&#x27;s members from nonmembers. Categorization is important in learning, prediction, inference, decision making, language, and many forms of organisms&#x27; interaction with their environments.

== Overview ==

Categories are distinct collections of concrete or abstract instances (category members) that are considered equivalent by the cognitive system. Using category knowledge requires one to access mental representations that define the core features of category members (cognitive psychologists refer to these category-specific mental representations as concepts). 

To categorization theorists, the categorization of objects is often considered using taxonomies with three hierarchical levels of abstraction. For example, a plant could be identified at a high level of abstraction by simply labeling it a flower, a medium level of abstraction by specifying that the flower is a rose, or a low level of abstraction by further specifying this particular rose as a dog rose. Categories in a taxonomy are related to one another via class inclusion, with the highest level of abstraction being the most inclusive and the lowest level of abstraction being the least inclusive. The three levels of abstraction are as follows:
* Superordinate level, Genus (e.g., Flower) - The highest and most inclusive level of abstraction. Exhibits the highest degree of generality and the lowest degree of within-category similarity.
* Basic Level, Species (e.g., Rose) - The middle level of abstraction. Rosch and colleagues (1976) suggest the basic level to be the most cognitively efficient. Basic level categories exhibit high within-category &quot;similarities&quot; and high between-category &quot;dissimilarities&quot;. Furthermore, the basic level is the most inclusive level at which category exemplars share a generalized identifiable shape. Adults most-often use basic level object names, and children learn basic object names first.
* Subordinate level (e.g., Dog Rose) - The lowest level of abstraction. Exhibits the highest degree of specificity and within-category similarity.

== Beginning of categorization ==

The essential issue in studying categorization is how conceptual differentiation between characteristics of conscious experience begins in young, inexperienced organisms. Growing experimental data show evidence of differentiation between characteristics of objects and events in newborns and even in foetuses during the prenatal period. This development succeeds in organisms that only demonstrate simple reflexes (see articles on the binding problem, cognition, cognitive development, infant cognitive development, multisensory integration, and perception). For their nervous systems, the environment is a cacophony of sensory stimuli: electromagnetic waves, chemical interactions, and pressure fluctuations.

Categorization thought involves the abstraction and differentiation of aspects of experience that rely upon such power of mind as intentionality and perception. The problem is that these young organisms should already grasp the abilities of intentionality and perception to categorize the environment. Intentionality and perception already require their ability to recognise objects (or events), i.e., to identify objects by the sensory system. This is a vicious circle: categorization needs intentionality and perception, which only appear in the categorized environment. So, the young, inexperienced organism does not have abstract thinking and cannot independently accomplish conceptual differentiation between characteristics of conscious experience if it solves the categorization problem alone.

Studying the origins of social cognition in child development, developmental psychologist Michael Tomasello developed the notion of Shared intentionality to account for unaware processes during social learning after birth to explain processes in shaping intentionality. Further, Latvian professor Igor Val Danilov expanded this concept to the intrauterine period by introducing a Mother-Fetus Neurocognitive model: a hypothesis of neurophysiological processes occurring during Shared intentionality. The hypothesis attempts to explain the beginning of cognitive development in organisms at different levels of bio-system complexity, from interpersonal dynamics to neuronal interactions. Evidence in neuroscience supports the hypothesis. Hyperscanning research studies observed inter-brain activity under conditions without communication in pairs while subjects were solving the shared cognitive problem, and they registered an increased inter-brain activity in contrast to the condition when subjects solved a similar problem alone. These data show that collaborative interaction without sensory cues can emerge in mother-child dyads, providing Shared intentionality. It shows the mode to cognize at the stage without communication and abstract thinking. 
The significance of this knowledge is that it can reveal the new direction to study consciousness since the latter refers to awareness of internal and external existence relying on intentionality, perception and categorization of the environment.

== Theories ==

=== Classical view ===

The classical theory of categorization, is a term used in cognitive linguistics to denote the approach to categorization that appears in Plato and Aristotle and that has been highly influential and dominant in Western culture, particularly in philosophy, linguistics and psychology. Aristotle&#x27;s categorical method of analysis was transmitted to the scholastic medieval university through Porphyry&#x27;s Isagoge. The classical view of categories can be summarized into three assumptions: a category can be described as a list of necessary and sufficient features that its membership must have, categories are discrete in that they have clearly defined boundaries (either an element belongs to one or not, with no possibilities in between), and all the members of a category have the same status. (There are no members of the category which belong more than others). In the classical view, categories need to be clearly defined, mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive; this way, any entity in the given classification universe belongs unequivocally to one, and only one, of the proposed categories.

The classical view of categories first appeared in the context of Western Philosophy in the work of Plato, who, in his Statesman dialogue, introduces the approach of grouping objects based on their similar properties. This approach was further explored and systematized by Aristotle in his Categories treatise, where he analyzes the differences between classes and objects. Aristotle also applied intensively the classical categorization scheme in his approach to the classification of living beings (which uses the technique of applying successive narrowing questions such as &quot;Is it an animal or vegetable?&quot;, &quot;How many feet does it have?&quot;, &quot;Does it have fur or feathers?&quot;, &quot;Can it fly?&quot;...), establishing this way the basis for natural taxonomy.

Examples of the use of the classical view of categories can be found in the western philosophical works of Descartes, Blaise Pascal, Spinoza and John Locke, and in the 20th century in Bertrand Russell, G.E. Moore, the logical positivists. It has been a cornerstone of analytic philosophy and its conceptual analysis, with more recent formulations proposed in the 1990s by Frank Cameron Jackson and Christopher Peacocke. At the beginning of the 20th century, the question of categories was introduced into the empirical social sciences by Durkheim and Mauss, whose pioneering work has been revisited in contemporary scholarship.

The classical model of categorization has been used at least since the 1960s from linguists of the structural semantics paradigm, by Jerrold Katz and Jerry Fodor in 1963, which in turn have influenced its adoption also by psychologists like Allan M. Collins and M. Ross Quillian.

Modern versions of classical categorization theory study how the brain learns and represents categories by detecting the features that distinguish members from nonmembers.

===Prototype theory===

The pioneering research by psychologist Eleanor Rosch and colleagues since 1973, introduced the prototype theory, according to which categorization can also be viewed as the process of grouping things based on prototypes. This approach has been highly influential, particularly for cognitive linguistics. It was in part based on previous insights, in particular the formulation of a category model based on family resemblance by Wittgenstein (1953), and by Roger Brown&#x27;s &quot;How shall a thing be called?&quot; (1958).

Prototype theory has been then adopted by cognitive linguists like George Lakoff. The prototype theory is an example of a similarity-based approach to categorization, in which a stored category representation is used to assess the similarity of candidate category members. Under the prototype theory, this stored representation consists of a summary representation of the category&#x27;s members. This prototype stimulus can take various forms. It might be a central tendency that represents the category&#x27;s average member, a modal stimulus representing either the most frequent instance or a stimulus composed of the most common category features, or, lastly, the &quot;ideal&quot; category member, or a caricature that emphasizes the distinct features of the category. An important consideration of this prototype representation is that it does not necessarily reflect the existence of an actual instance of the category in the world. Furthermore, prototypes are highly sensitive to context. For example, while one&#x27;s prototype for the category of beverages may be soda or seltzer, the context of brunch might lead them to select mimosa as a prototypical beverage.

The prototype theory claims that members of a given category share a family resemblance, and categories are defined by sets of typical features (as opposed to all members possessing necessary and sufficient features).

===Exemplar theory===

Another instance of the similarity-based approach to categorization, the exemplar theory likewise compares the similarity of candidate category members to stored memory representations. Under the exemplar theory, all known instances of a category are stored in memory as exemplars. When evaluating an unfamiliar entity&#x27;s category membership, exemplars from potentially relevant categories are retrieved from memory, and the entity&#x27;s similarity to those exemplars is summed to formulate a categorization decision. Medin and Schaffer&#x27;s (1978) Context model employs a nearest neighbor approach which, rather than summing an entity&#x27;s similarities to relevant exemplars, multiplies them to provide weighted similarities that reflect the entity&#x27;s proximity to relevant exemplars. This effectively biases categorization decisions towards exemplars most similar to the entity to be categorized.

===Conceptual clustering===

Conceptual clustering is a machine learning paradigm for unsupervised classification that was defined by Ryszard S. Michalski in 1980. It is a modern variation of the classical approach of categorization, and derives from attempts to explain how knowledge is represented. In this approach, classes (clusters or entities) are generated by first formulating their conceptual descriptions and then classifying the entities according to the descriptions.

Conceptual clustering developed mainly during the 1980s, as a machine paradigm for unsupervised learning. It is distinguished from ordinary data clustering by generating a concept description for each generated category.

Conceptual clustering is closely related to fuzzy set theory, in which objects may belong to one or more groups, in varying degrees of fitness. A cognitive approach accepts that natural categories are graded (they tend to be fuzzy at their boundaries) and inconsistent in the status of their constituent members. The idea of necessary and sufficient conditions is almost never met in categories of naturally occurring things.

== Category learning ==
&quot;While an exhaustive discussion of category learning is beyond the scope of this article, a brief overview of category learning and its associated theories is useful in understanding formal models of categorization.&quot;

If categorization research investigates how categories are maintained and used, the field of category learning seeks to understand how categories are acquired in the first place. To accomplish this, researchers often employ novel categories of arbitrary objects (e.g., dot matrices) to ensure that participants are entirely unfamiliar with the stimuli. Category learning researchers have generally focused on two distinct forms of category learning. Classification learning tasks participants with predicting category labels for a stimulus based on its provided features. Classification learning is centered around learning between-category information and the diagnostic features of categories. In contrast, inference learning tasks participants with inferring the presence/value of a category feature based on a provided category label and/or the presence of other category features. Inference learning is centered on learning within-category information and the category&#x27;s prototypical features.

Category learning tasks can generally be divided into two categories, supervised and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning tasks provide learners with category labels. Learners then use information extracted from labeled example categories to classify stimuli into the appropriate category, which may involve the abstraction of a rule or concept relating observed object features to category labels. Unsupervised learning tasks do not provide learners with category labels. Learners must therefore recognize inherent structures in a data set and group stimuli together by similarity into classes. Unsupervised learning is thus a process of generating a classification structure. Tasks used to study category learning take various forms:
* Rule-based tasks present categories that participants can learn through explicit reasoning processes. In these kinds of tasks, classification of stimuli is accomplished via the use of an acquired rule (i.e., if stimulus is large on dimension x, respond A).
* Information-integration tasks require learners to synthesize perceptual information from multiple stimulus dimensions prior to making categorization decisions. Unlike rule-based tasks, information-integration tasks do not afford rules that are easily articulable. Reading an X-ray and trying to determine if a tumor is present can be thought of as a real-world instantiation of an information-integration task.
* Prototype distortion tasks require learners to generate a prototype for a category. Candidate exemplars for the category are then produced by randomly manipulating the features of the prototype, which learners must classify as either belonging to the category or not.

===Category learning theories===

Category learning researchers have proposed various theories for how humans learn categories. Prevailing theories of category learning include the prototype theory, the exemplar theory, and the decision bound theory.

The prototype theory suggests that to learn a category, one must learn the category&#x27;s prototype. Subsequent categorization of novel stimuli is then accomplished by selecting the category with the most similar prototype.

The exemplar theory suggests that to learn a category, one must learn about the exemplars that belong to that category. Subsequent categorization of a novel stimulus is then accomplished by computing its similarity to the known exemplars of potentially relevant categories and selecting the category that contains the most similar exemplars.

Decision bound theory suggests that to learn a category, one must either learn the regions of a stimulus space associated with particular responses or the boundaries (the decision bounds) that divide these response regions. Categorization of a novel stimulus is then accomplished by determining which response region it is contained within.

== Formal models ==

Computational models of categorization have been developed to test theories about how humans represent and use category information. To accomplish this, categorization models can be fit to experimental data to see how well the predictions afforded by the model line up with human performance. Based on the model&#x27;s success at explaining the data, theorists are able to draw conclusions about the accuracy of their theories and their theory&#x27;s relevance to human category representations.

To effectively capture how humans represent and use category information, categorization models generally operate under variations of the same three basic assumptions. First, the model must make some kind of assumption about the internal representation of the stimulus (e.g., representing the perception of a stimulus as a point in a multi-dimensional space). Second, the model must make an assumption about the specific information that needs to be accessed in order to formulate a response (e.g., exemplar models require the collection of all available exemplars for each category). Third, the model must make an assumption about how a response is selected given the available information.

Though all categorization models make these three assumptions, they distinguish themselves by the ways in which they represent and transform an input into a response representation. The internal knowledge structures of various categorization models reflect the specific representation(s) they use to perform these transformations. Typical representations employed by models include exemplars, prototypes, and rules.
* Exemplar models store all distinct instances of stimuli with their corresponding category labels in memory. Categorization of subsequent stimuli is determined by the stimulus&#x27; collective similarity to all known exemplars.
* Prototype models store a summary representation of all instances in a category. Categorization of subsequent stimuli is determined by selecting the category whose prototype is most similar to the stimulus.
* Rule-based models define categories by storing summary lists of the necessary and sufficient features required for category membership. Boundary models can be considered as atypical rule models, as they do not define categories based on their content. Rather, boundary models define the edges (boundaries) between categories, which subsequently serve as determinants for how a stimulus gets categorized.

== Examples ==

===Prototype models===

Weighted Features Prototype Model An early instantiation of the prototype model was produced by Reed in the early 1970s. Reed (1972) conducted a series of experiments to compare the performance of 18 models on explaining data from a categorization task that required participants to sort faces into one of two categories. Results suggested that the prevailing model was the weighted features prototype model, which belonged to the family of average distance models. Unlike traditional average distance models, however, this model differentially weighted the most distinguishing features of the two categories. Given this model&#x27;s performance, Reed (1972) concluded that the strategy participants used during the face categorization task was to construct prototype representations for each of the two categories of faces and categorize test patterns into the category associated with the most similar prototype. Furthermore, results suggested that similarity was determined by each categories most discriminating features.

===Exemplar models===

Generalized Context Model Medin and Schaffer&#x27;s (1978) context model was expanded upon by Nosofsky (1986) in the mid-1980s, resulting in the production of the Generalized Context Model (GCM). The GCM is an exemplar model that stores exemplars of stimuli as exhaustive combinations of the features associated with each exemplar. By storing these combinations, the model establishes contexts for the features of each exemplar, which are defined by all other features with which that feature co-occurs. The GCM computes the similarity of an exemplar and a stimulus in two steps. First, the GCM computes the psychological distance between the exemplar and the stimulus. This is accomplished by summing the absolute values of the dimensional difference between the exemplar and the stimulus. For example, suppose an exemplar has a value of 18 on dimension X and the stimulus has a value of 42 on dimension X; the resulting dimensional difference would be 24. Once psychological distance has been evaluated, an exponential decay function determines the similarity of the exemplar and the stimulus, where a distance of 0 results in a similarity of 1 (which begins to decrease exponentially as distance increases). Categorical responses are then generated by evaluating the similarity of the stimulus to each category&#x27;s exemplars, where each exemplar provides a &quot;vote&quot; to their respective categories that varies in strength based on the exemplar&#x27;s similarity to the stimulus and the strength of the exemplar&#x27;s association with the category. This effectively assigns each category a selection probability that is determined by the proportion of votes it receives, which can then be fit to data.

===Rule-based models===

RULEX (Rule-Plus-Exception) Model While simple logical rules are ineffective at learning poorly defined category structures, some proponents of the rule-based theory of categorization suggest that an imperfect rule can be used to learn such category structures if exceptions to that rule are also stored and considered. To formalize this proposal, Nosofsky and colleagues (1994) designed the RULEX model. The RULEX model attempts to form a decision tree composed of sequential tests of an object&#x27;s attribute values. Categorization of the object is then determined by the outcome of these sequential tests. The RULEX model searches for rules in the following ways:
* Exact Search for a rule that uses a single attribute to discriminate between classes without error.
* Imperfect Search for a rule that uses a single attribute to discriminate between classes with few errors
* Conjunctive Search for a rule that uses multiple attributes to discriminate between classes with few errors.
* Exception Search for exceptions to the rule.

The method that RULEX uses to perform these searches is as follows: First, RULEX attempts an exact search. If successful, then RULEX will continuously apply that rule until misclassification occurs. If the exact search fails to identify a rule, either an imperfect or conjunctive search will begin. A sufficient, though imperfect, rule acquired during one of these search phases will become permanently implemented and the RULEX model will then begin to search for exceptions. If no rule is acquired, then the model will attempt the search it did not perform in the previous phase. If successful, RULEX will permanently implement the rule and then begin an exception search. If none of the previous search methods are successful RULEX will default to only searching for exceptions, despite lacking an associated rule, which equates to acquiring a random rule.

===Hybrid models===

SUSTAIN (Supervised and Unsupervised Stratified Adaptive Incremental Network) It is often the case that learned category representations vary depending on the learner&#x27;s goals, as well as how categories are used during learning. Thus, some categorization researchers suggest that a proper model of categorization needs to be able to account for the variability present in the learner&#x27;s goals, tasks, and strategies. This proposal was realized by Love and colleagues (2004) through the creation of SUSTAIN, a flexible clustering model capable of accommodating both simple and complex categorization problems through incremental adaptation to the specifics of problems.

In practice, the SUSTAIN model first converts a stimulus&#x27; perceptual information into features that are organized along a set of dimensions. The representational space that encompasses these dimensions is then distorted (e.g., stretched or shrunk) to reflect the importance of each feature based on inputs from an attentional mechanism. A set of clusters (specific instances grouped by similarity) associated with distinct categories then compete to respond to the stimulus, with the stimulus being subsequently assigned to the cluster whose representational space is closest to the stimulus&#x27;. The unknown stimulus dimension value (e.g., category label) is then predicted by the winning cluster, which, in turn, informs the categorization decision.

The flexibility of the SUSTAIN model is realized through its ability to employ both supervised and unsupervised learning at the cluster level. If SUSTAIN incorrectly predicts a stimulus as belonging to a particular cluster, corrective feedback (i.e., supervised learning) would signal sustain to recruit an additional cluster that represents the misclassified stimulus. Therefore, subsequent exposures to the stimulus (or a similar alternative) would be assigned to the correct cluster. SUSTAIN will also employ unsupervised learning to recruit an additional cluster if the similarity between the stimulus and the closest cluster does not exceed a threshold, as the model recognizes the weak predictive utility that would result from such a cluster assignment. SUSTAIN also exhibits flexibility in how it solves both simple and complex categorization problems. Outright, the internal representation of SUSTAIN contains only a single cluster, thus biasing the model towards simple solutions. As problems become increasingly complex (e.g., requiring solutions consisting of multiple stimulus dimensions), additional clusters are incrementally recruited so SUSTAIN can handle the rise in complexity.

== Social categorization ==
Social categorization consists of putting human beings into groups in order to identify them based on different criteria. Categorization is a process studied by scholars in cognitive science but can also be studied as a social activity. Social categorization is different from the categorization of other things because it implies that people create categories for themselves and others as human beings. Groups can be created based on ethnicity, country of origin, religion, sexual identity, social privileges, economic privileges, etc. Various ways to sort people exist according to one&#x27;s schemas. People belong to various social groups because of their ethnicity, religion, or age.

Social categories based on age, race, and gender are used by people when they encounter a new person. Because some of these categories refer to physical traits, they are often used automatically when people do not know each other. These categories are not objective and depend on how people see the world around them. They allow people to identify themselves with similar people, and to identify people who are different. They are useful in one&#x27;s identity formation with the people around them. One can build their own identity by identifying themselves in a group or by rejecting another group.

Social categorization is similar to other types of categorization since it aims at simplifying the understanding of people. However, creating social categories implies that people will position themselves in relation to other groups. A hierarchy in group relations can appear as a result of social categorization.

Scholars argue that the categorization process starts at a young age when children start to learn about the world and the people around them. Children learn how to know people according to categories based on similarities and differences. Social categories made by adults also impact their understanding of the world. They learn about social groups by hearing generalities about these groups from their parents. They can then develop prejudices about people as a result of these generalities.

Another aspect of social categorization is mentioned by Stephen Reicher and Nick Hopkins and is related to political domination. They argue that political leaders use social categories to influence political debates.

=== Negative aspects ===
The activity of sorting people according to subjective or objective criteria can be seen as a negative process because of its tendency to lead to violence from a group to another. Indeed, similarities gather people who share common traits but differences between groups can lead to tensions and then the use of violence between those groups. The creation of social groups by people is responsible of a hierarchization of relations between groups. These hierarchical relations participate in the promotion of stereotypes about people and groups, sometimes based on subjective criteria. Social categories can encourage people to associate stereotypes to groups of people. Associating stereotypes to a group, and to people who belong to this group, can lead to forms of discrimination towards people of this group. The perception of a group and the stereotypes associated with it have an impact on social relations and activities.

Some social categories have more weight than others in society. For instance, in history and still today, the category of &quot;race&quot; is one of the first categories used to sort people. However, only a few categories of race are commonly used such as &quot;Black&quot;, &quot;White&quot;, &quot;Asian&quot; etc. It participates in the reduction of the multitude of ethnicities to a few categories based mostly on people&#x27;s skin color.

The process of sorting people creates a vision of the other as &#x27;different&#x27;, leading to the dehumanization of people. Scholars talk about intergroup relations with the concept of social identity theory developed by H. Tajfel. Indeed, in history, many examples of social categorization have led to forms of domination or violence from a dominant group to a dominated group. Periods of colonisation are examples of times when people from a group chose to dominate and control other people belonging to other groups because they considered them as inferior. Racism, discrimination and violence are consequences of social categorization and can occur because of it. When people see others as different, they tend to develop hierarchical relation with other groups.

== Miscategorization ==

There cannot be categorization without the possibility of miscategorization. To do &quot;the right thing with the right &quot;kind&quot; of thing.&quot;, there has to be both a right and a wrong thing to do. Not only does a category of which &quot;everything&quot; is a member lead logically to the Russell paradox (&quot;is it or is it not a member of itself?&quot;), but without the possibility of error, there is no way to detect or define what distinguishes category members from nonmembers.

An example of the absence of nonmembers is the problem of the poverty of the stimulus in language learning by the child: children learning the language do not hear or make errors in the rules of Universal Grammar (UG). Hence they never get corrected for errors in UG. Yet children&#x27;s speech obeys the rules of UG, and speakers can immediately detect that something is wrong if a linguist generates (deliberately) an utterance that violates UG. Hence speakers can categorize what is UG-compliant and UG-noncompliant. Linguists have concluded from this that the rules of UG must be somehow encoded innately in the human brain.

Ordinary categories, however, such as &quot;dogs,&quot; have abundant examples of nonmembers (cats, for example). So it is possible to learn, by trial and error, with error-correction, to detect and define what distinguishes dogs from non-dogs, and hence to correctly categorize them. This kind of learning, called reinforcement learning in the behavioral literature and supervised learning in the computational literature, is fundamentally dependent on the possibility of error, and error-correction. Miscategorization—examples of nonmembers of the category—must always exist, not only to make the category learnable, but for the category to exist and be definable at all.

<text>A prototype is an early sample, model, or release of a product built to test a concept or process. It is a term used in a variety of contexts, including semantics, design, electronics, and software programming. A prototype is generally used to evaluate a new design to enhance precision by system analysts and users. Prototyping serves to provide specifications for a real, working system rather than a theoretical one. Physical prototyping has a long history, and paper prototyping and virtual prototyping now extensively complement it. In some design workflow models, creating a prototype (a process sometimes called materialization) is the step between the formalization and the evaluation of an idea.

A prototype can also mean a typical example of something such as in the use of the derivation &#x27;prototypical&#x27;. This is a useful term in identifying objects, behaviours and concepts which are considered the accepted norm and is analogous with terms such as stereotypes and archetypes.

The word &quot;&quot; derives from the Greek , &quot;primitive form&quot;, neutral of , &quot;original, primitive&quot;, from πρῶτος &quot;protos&quot;, &quot;first&quot; and τύπος &quot;typos&quot;, &quot;impression&quot; (originally in the sense of a mark left by a blow, then by a stamp struck by a die (note &quot;typewriter&quot;); by implication a scar or mark; by analogy a shape i.e. a statue, (figuratively) style, or resemblance; a model for imitation or illustrative example—note &quot;typical&quot;).

== Types ==
Prototypes explore different aspects of an intended design: 
* A proof-of-principle prototype serves to verify some key functional aspects of the intended design, but usually does not have all the functionality of the final product.
* A working prototype represents all or nearly all of the functionality of the final product.
* A visual prototype represents the size and appearance, but not the functionality, of the intended design. A form study prototype is a preliminary type of visual prototype in which the geometric features of a design are emphasized, with less concern for color, texture, or other aspects of the final appearance.
* A user experience prototype represents enough of the appearance and function of the product that it can be used for user research.
* A functional prototype captures both function and appearance of the intended design, though it may be created with different techniques and even different scale from final design.
* A paper prototype is a printed or hand-drawn representation of the user interface of a software product. Such prototypes are commonly used for early testing of a software design, and can be part of a software walkthrough to confirm design decisions before more costly levels of design effort are expended.

== Differences in creating a prototype vs. a final product ==

In general, the creation of prototypes will differ from creation of the final product in some fundamental ways:
* Material: The materials that will be used in a final product may be expensive or difficult to fabricate, so prototypes may be made from different materials than the final product. In some cases, the final production materials may still be undergoing development themselves and not yet available for use in a prototype. 
* Process: Mass-production processes are often unsuitable for making a small number of parts, so prototypes may be made using different fabrication processes than the final product. For example, a final product that will be made by plastic injection molding will require expensive custom tooling, so a prototype for this product may be fabricated by machining or stereolithography instead. Differences in fabrication process may lead to differences in the appearance of the prototype as compared to the final product. 
* Verification: The final product may be subject to a number of quality assurance tests to verify conformance with drawings or specifications. These tests may involve custom inspection fixtures, statistical sampling methods, and other techniques appropriate for ongoing production of a large quantity of the final product. Prototypes are generally made with much closer individual inspection and the assumption that some adjustment or rework will be part of the fabrication process. Prototypes may also be exempted from some requirements that will apply to the final product.

Engineers and prototype specialists attempt to minimize the impact of these differences on the intended role for the prototype. For example, if a visual prototype is not able to use the same materials as the final product, they will attempt to substitute materials with properties that closely simulate the intended final materials.

== Characteristics and limitations of prototypes ==

Engineers and prototyping specialists seek to understand the limitations of prototypes to exactly simulate the characteristics of their intended design.

Prototypes represent some compromise from the final production design. This is due to the skill and choices of the designer(s), and the inevitable inherent limitations of a prototype. Due to differences in materials, processes and design fidelity, it is possible that a prototype may fail to perform acceptably although the production design may have been sound. Conversely, prototypes may perform acceptably but the production design and outcome may prove unsuccessful.

In general, it can be expected that individual prototype costs will be substantially greater than the final production costs due to inefficiencies in materials and processes. Prototypes are also used to revise the design for the purposes of reducing costs through optimization and refinement.

It is possible to use prototype testing to reduce the risk that a design may not perform as intended, however prototypes generally cannot eliminate all risk. 

Building the full design is often expensive and can be time-consuming, especially when repeated several times—building the full design, figuring out what the problems are and how to solve them, then building another full design. As an alternative, rapid prototyping or rapid application development techniques are used for the initial prototypes, which implement part, but not all, of the complete design. This allows designers and manufacturers to rapidly and inexpensively test the parts of the design that are most likely to have problems, solve those problems, and then build the full design.

== Engineering sciences ==
In technology research, a technology demonstrator is a prototype serving as proof-of-concept and demonstration model for a new technology or future product, proving its viability and illustrating conceivable applications.

In large development projects, a testbed is a platform and prototype development environment for rigorous experimentation and testing of new technologies, components, scientific theories and computational tools.

With recent advances in computer modeling it is becoming practical to eliminate the creation of a physical prototype (except possibly at greatly reduced scales for promotional purposes), instead modeling all aspects of the final product as a computer model. An example of such a development can be seen in Boeing 787 Dreamliner, in which the first full sized physical realization is made on the series production line. Computer modeling is now being extensively used in automotive design, both for form (in the styling and aerodynamics of the vehicle) and in function—especially for improving vehicle crashworthiness and in weight reduction to improve mileage.

=== Mechanical and electrical engineering ===

The most common use of the word prototype is a functional, although experimental, version of a non-military machine (e.g., automobiles, domestic appliances, consumer electronics) whose designers would like to have built by mass production means, as opposed to a mockup, which is an inert representation of a machine&#x27;s appearance, often made of some non-durable substance.

An electronics designer often builds the first prototype from breadboard or stripboard or perfboard, typically using &quot;DIP&quot; packages.

However, more and more often the first functional prototype is built on a &quot;prototype PCB&quot; almost identical to the production PCB, as PCB manufacturing prices fall and as many components are not available in DIP packages, but only available in SMT packages optimized for placing on a PCB.

Builders of military machines and aviation prefer the terms &quot;experimental&quot; and &quot;service test&quot;.

=== Electronics ===
== Computer programming and computer science ==
Prototype software is often referred to as alpha grade, meaning it is the first version to run. Often only a few functions are implemented, the primary focus of the alpha is to have a functional base code on to which features may be added. Once alpha grade software has most of the required features integrated into it, it becomes beta software for testing of the entire software and to adjust the program to respond correctly during situations unforeseen during development.

Often the end users may not be able to provide a complete set of application objectives, detailed input, processing, or output requirements in the initial stage. After the user evaluation, another prototype will be built based on feedback from users, and again the cycle returns to customer evaluation. The cycle starts by listening to the user, followed by building or revising a mock-up, and letting the user test the mock-up, then back. There is now a new generation of tools called Application Simulation Software which help quickly simulate application before their development.

Extreme programming uses iterative design to gradually add one feature at a time to the initial prototype.

=== Other programming/computing concepts ===
In many programming languages, a &quot;function prototype&quot; is the declaration of a subroutine or function (and should not be confused with software prototyping). This term is rather C/C++-specific; other terms for this notion are &quot;signature&quot;, &quot;type&quot; and &quot;interface&quot;. In prototype-based programming (a form of object-oriented programming), new objects are produced by cloning existing objects, which are called prototypes.

The term may also refer to the Prototype Javascript Framework.

Additionally, the term may refer to the prototype design pattern.

Continuous learning approaches within organizations or businesses may also use the concept of business or process prototypes through software models.

The concept of prototypicality is used to describe how much a website deviates from the expected norm, and leads to a lowering of user preference for that site&#x27;s design.

=== Data prototyping ===
A &quot;data prototype&quot; is a form of &quot;functional &quot;or &quot;working&quot; prototype. The justification for its creation is usually a data migration, data integration or application implementation project and the raw materials used as input are an instance of all the relevant data which exists at the start of the project.

The objectives of &quot;data prototyping&quot; are to produce: 
* A set of data cleansing and transformation rules which have been &quot;seen&quot; to produce data which is all fit for purpose.
* A dataset which is the result of those rules being applied to an instance of the relevant raw (source) data.
To achieve this, a data architect uses a graphical interface to interactively develop and execute transformation and cleansing rules using raw data. The resultant data is then evaluated and the rules refined. Beyond the obvious visual checking of the data &quot;on-screen&quot; by the data architect, the usual evaluation and validation approaches are to use Data profiling software and then to insert the resultant data into a test version of the target application and trial its use.

=== Prototyping for Human-Computer Interaction ===
When developing software or digital tools that humans interact with, a prototype is an artifact that is used to ask and answer a design question. Prototypes provide the means for examining design problems and evaluating solutions.

HCI practitioners can employ several different types of prototypes:
* &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; prototype: named after the Wizard of Oz in the film &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. This is a prototyping method with which the computer-side of the interaction is faked by an offsite or hidden human. This prototyping technique is particularly useful for demonstrating functionality that is difficult or lengthy to engineer, such as applications like voice user interface. 
* role prototype: this prototype may not be engineered or look and feel like a finished product, but the purpose of this type of prototype is to investigate and evaluation a user need, or what the prototype could do for the user. They can present features and functionality that the user might benefit from, to demonstrate what role an artifact like the prototype might fulfill for the user. A famous example of this kind of prototype would be the block of wood carried by Jeff Hawkins, when developing the Palm Pilot.
* paper prototype: this prototype may use cut paper, cardboard, or other inexpensive materials to demonstrate an interface. The purpose of this prototype is to test with users, without having to use a digital tool or develop a program to test functionality. Recently, paper prototyping has fallen out of favor within certain design circles, particularly because the low-fidelity nature of this method and the lack of effectiveness when testing with users.

== Scale modeling ==
In the field of scale modeling (which includes model railroading, vehicle modeling, airplane modeling, military modeling, etc.), a prototype is the real-world basis or source for a scale model—such as the real EMD GP38-2 locomotive—which is the prototype of Athearn&#x27;s (among other manufacturers) locomotive model. Technically, any non-living object can serve as a prototype for a model, including structures, equipment, and appliances, and so on, but generally prototypes have come to mean full-size real-world vehicles including automobiles (the prototype 1957 Chevy has spawned many models), military equipment (such as M4 Shermans, a favorite among US Military modelers), railroad equipment, motor trucks, motorcycles, and space-ships (real-world such as Apollo/Saturn Vs, or the ISS).
As of 2014, basic rapid prototype machines (such as 3D printers) cost about $2,000, but larger and more precise machines can cost as much as $500,000.

== Architecture ==
In architecture, prototyping refers to either architectural model making (as form of scale modelling) or as part of aesthetic or material experimentation, such as the &quot;Forty Wall House&quot; open source material prototyping centre in Australia.

Architects prototype to test ideas structurally, aesthetically and technically. Whether the prototype works or not is not the primary focus: architectural prototyping is the revelatory process through which the architect gains insight.

== Metrology ==

In the science and practice of metrology, a prototype is a human-made object that is used as the standard of measurement of some physical quantity to base all measurement of that physical quantity against. Sometimes this standard object is called an artifact. In the International System of Units (SI), there remains no prototype standard since May 20, 2019. Before that date, the last prototype used was the international prototype of the kilogram, a solid platinum-iridium cylinder kept at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (International Bureau of Weights and Measures) in Sèvres France (a suburb of Paris) that by definition was the mass of exactly one kilogram. Copies of this prototype are fashioned and issued to many nations to represent the national standard of the kilogram and are periodically compared to the Paris prototype. Now the kilogram is redefined in such a way that the Planck constant is prescribed a value of exactly 

Until 1960, the meter was defined by a platinum-iridium prototype bar with two marks on it (that were, by definition, spaced apart by one meter), the international prototype of the metre, and in 1983 the meter was redefined to be the distance in free space covered by light in 1/299,792,458 of a second (thus &quot;defining&quot; the speed of light to be 299,792,458 meters per second).

== Natural sciences ==
In many sciences, from pathology to taxonomy, &quot;prototype&quot; refers to a disease, species, etc. which sets a good example for the whole category. In biology, &quot;prototype&quot; is the ancestral or primitive form of a species or other group; an archetype. For example, the Senegal bichir is regarded as the prototypes of its genus, &quot;Polypterus&quot;.
