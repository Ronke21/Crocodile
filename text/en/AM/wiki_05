<text>The Temple Mount (), also known as the Noble Sanctuary (Arabic: الحرم الشريف, &#x27;Haram al-Sharif&#x27;), and sometimes as Jerusalem&#x27;s holy esplanade, is a hill in the Old City of Jerusalem that has been venerated as a holy site for thousands of years, including in Judaism, Christianity and Islam.

The present site is a flat plaza surrounded by retaining walls (including the Western Wall), which were originally built by King Herod in the first century BCE for an expansion of the Second Jewish Temple. The plaza is dominated by two monumental structures originally built during the Rashidun and early Umayyad caliphates after the city&#x27;s capture in 637 CE: the main praying hall of al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock, near the center of the hill, which was completed in 692 CE, making it one of the oldest extant Islamic structures in the world. The Herodian walls and gates, with additions from the late Byzantine, early Muslim, Mamluk, and Ottoman periods, flank the site, which can be reached through eleven gates, ten reserved for Muslims and one for non-Muslims, with guard posts of the Israel Police in the vicinity of each. The courtyard is surrounded on the north and west by two Mamluk-era porticos (&quot;riwaq&quot;) and four minarets.

The Temple Mount is the holiest site in Judaism, and where two Jewish temples once stood. According to Jewish tradition and scripture, the First Temple was built by King Solomon, the son of King David, in 957 BCE, and was destroyed by the Neo-Babylonian Empire, together with Jerusalem, in 587 BCE. No archaeological evidence has been found to verify the existence of the First Temple, and scientific excavations have been limited due to religious sensitivities. The Second Temple, constructed under Zerubbabel in 516 BCE, was later renovated by King Herod and was ultimately destroyed by the Roman Empire in 70 CE. Orthodox Jewish tradition maintains it is here that the third and final Temple will be built when the Messiah comes. The Temple Mount is the place Jews turn towards during prayer. Jewish attitudes towards entering the site vary. Due to its extreme sanctity, many Jews will not walk on the Mount itself, to avoid unintentionally entering the area where the Holy of Holies stood, since, according to rabbinical law, there is still some aspect of the divine presence at the site.

The Al-Aqsa mosque compound, atop the site, is the second oldest mosque in Islam, and one of the three Sacred Mosques, the holiest sites in Islam; it is revered as &quot;the Noble Sanctuary&quot;. Its courtyard (&quot;sahn&quot;) can host more than 400,000 worshippers, making it one of the largest mosques in the world. For Sunni and Shia Muslims alike, it ranks as the third holiest site in Islam. The plaza includes the location regarded as where the Islamic prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven, and served as the first &quot;qibla&quot;, the direction Muslims turn towards when praying. As in Judaism, Muslims also associate the site with Solomon and other prophets who are also venerated in Islam. The site, and the term &quot;al-Aqsa&quot;, in relation to the whole plaza, is also a central identity symbol for Palestinians, including Palestinian Christians.

Since the Crusades, the Muslim community of Jerusalem has managed the site through the Jerusalem Islamic Waqf. The site, along with the whole of East Jerusalem (which includes the Old City), was controlled by Jordan from 1948 until 1967 and has been occupied by Israel since the Six-Day War of 1967. Shortly after capturing the site, Israel handed its administration back to the Waqf under the Jordanian Hashemite custodianship, while maintaining Israeli security control. The Israeli government enforces a ban on prayer by non-Muslims as part of an arrangement usually referred to as the &quot;status quo&quot;. The site remains a major focal point of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.

==Terminology==
The name of the site is disputed, primarily between Muslims and Jews, in the context of the ongoing Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Some Arab-Muslim commentators and scholars attempt to deny Jewish connection with the Temple Mount, while some Jewish commentators and scholars attempt to belittle the importance of the site in Islam. During a 2016 dispute over the name of the site, UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova stated: &quot;Different peoples worship the same places, sometimes under different names. The recognition, use of and respect for these names is paramount.&quot;

===Temple Mount===
The term &quot;Har haBayīt&quot; – commonly translated as &quot;Temple Mount&quot; in English – was first used in the books of Micah (4:1) and Jeremiah (26:18), literally as &quot;Mount of the House&quot;, a literary variation of the longer phrase &quot;Mountain of the House of the Lord&quot;. The abbreviation was not used again in the later books of the Hebrew Bible or in the New Testament. The term remained in use throughout the Second Temple period, although the term “Mount Zion”, which today refers to the eastern hill of ancient Jerusalem, was used more frequently. Both terms are in use in the Book of Maccabees. The term &quot;Har haBayīt&quot; is used throughout the Mishnah and later Talmudic texts.

The exact moment when the concept of the Mount as a topographical feature separate from the Temple or the city itself first came into existence is a matter of debate among scholars. According to Eliav, it was during the first century CE, after the destruction of the Second Temple. Shahar and Shatzman reached different conclusions. In the Books of Chronicles, edited at the end of the Persian period, the mountain is already referred to as a distinct entity. In 2 Chronicles, Solomon&#x27;s Temple was constructed on Mount Moriah (3:1), and Manasseh&#x27;s atonement for his sins is associated with the Mountain of the House of the Lord (33:15). The conception of the Temple as being located on a holy mountain possessing special qualities is found repeatedly in Psalms, with the surrounding area being considered an integral part of the Temple itself.

The governmental organization which administers the site, the Jerusalem Islamic Waqf (part of the Jordanian government), have stated that the name &quot;The Temple Mount&quot; is a &quot;strange and alien name&quot; and a &quot;newly-created Judaization term&quot;. In 2014, the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) issued a press release urging journalists not to use the term &quot;Temple Mount&quot; when referring to the site. In 2017, it was reported that Waqf officials harassed archeologists such as Gabriel Barkay and tour guides who used the term at the site. According to Jan Turek and John Carman, in modern usage, the term Temple Mount can potentially imply support for Israeli control of the site.

=== Other Hebrew terms ===
2 Chronicles 3:1 refers to the Temple Mount in the time before the construction of the temple as Mount Moriah (, ).

Several passages in the Hebrew Bible indicate that during the time when they were written, the Temple Mount was identified as Mount Zion. The Mount Zion mentioned in the later parts of the Book of Isaiah (Isaiah 60:14), in the Book of Psalms, and the First Book of Maccabees () seems to refer to the top of the hill, generally known as the Temple Mount. According to the Book of Samuel, Mount Zion was the site of the Jebusite fortress called the &quot;stronghold of Zion&quot;, but once the First Temple was erected, according to the Bible, at the top of the Eastern Hill (&quot;Temple Mount&quot;), the name &quot;Mount Zion&quot; migrated there too. The name later migrated for a last time, this time to Jerusalem&#x27;s Western Hill.

===Al-Aqsa Mosque===

The English term &quot;al-Aqsa Mosque&quot; is a translation of either &quot;al-Masjid al-&#x27;Aqṣā&quot; () or &quot;al-Jâmi&#x27; al-Aqṣā&quot; (). &quot;Al-Masjid al-&#x27;Aqṣā&quot; – &quot;the farthest mosque&quot; – is derived from the Quran&#x27;s &quot;Surah 17&quot; (&quot;The Night Journey&quot;) which writes that Muhammad travelled from Mecca to the mosque, from where he subsequently ascended to Heaven. Arabic and Persian writers such as 10th-century geographer Al-Maqdisi, 11th-century scholar Nasir Khusraw, 12th-century geographer Muhammad al-Idrisi and 15th-century Islamic scholar Mujir al-Din, as well as 19th century American and British Orientalists Edward Robinson, Guy Le Strange and Edward Henry Palmer explained that the term Masjid al-Aqsa refers to the entire esplanade plaza which is the subject of this article – the entire area including the Dome of the Rock, the fountains, the gates, and the four minarets – because none of these buildings existed at the time the Quran was written.

&quot;Al-Jâmi&#x27; al-Aqṣá&quot; refers to the specific site of the silver-domed congregational mosque building, also referred to as Qibli Mosque or Qibli Chapel (&quot;al-Jami&#x27; al-Aqsa&quot; or &quot;al-Qibli&quot;, or &quot;Masjid al-Jumah&quot; or &quot;al-Mughata&quot;), in reference to its location on the southern end of the compound as a result of the Islamic qibla being moved from Jerusalem to Mecca. The two different Arabic terms, translated as &quot;mosque&quot; in English, parallel the two different Greek terms translated as &quot;temple&quot; in the New Testament: (equivalent to Masjid) and (equivalent to Jami&#x27;a), and use of the term &quot;mosque&quot; for the whole compound follows the usage of the same term for other early Islamic sites with large courtyards such as the Mosque of Ibn Tulun in Cairo, the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus and the Great Mosque of Kairouan. Other sources and maps have used the term &quot;al-Masjid al-&#x27;Aqṣā&quot; to refer to the congregational mosque itself.

The term &quot;al-Aqsa&quot; as a symbol and brand-name has become popular and prevalent in the region. For example, the Al-Aqsa Intifada (the uprising of September 2000), the al-Aqsa Martyrs&#x27; Brigades (a coalition of Palestinian nationalist militias in the West Bank), al-Aqsa TV (the official Hamas-run television channel), al-Aqsa University (Palestinian university established in 1991 in the Gaza Strip), Jund al-Aqsa (a Salafist jihadist organization that was active during the Syrian Civil War), the Jordanian military periodical published since the early 1970s, and the associations of both the southern and northern branches of the Islamic Movement in Israel are all named Al-Aqsa after this site.

===Haram al-Sharif===
During the period of Mamluk (1260–1517) and Ottoman rule (1517–1917), the wider compound of the Temple Mount began to also be popularly known as the Haram al-Sharif, or &quot;al-Ḥaram ash-Sharīf&quot; (), which translates as the &quot;Noble Sanctuary&quot;. It mirrors the terminology of the Masjid al-Haram in Mecca; This term elevated the compound to the status of Haram, which had previously been reserved for the Masjid al-Haram in Mecca and the Al-Masjid an-Nabawi in Medina. Other Islamic figures disputed the haram status of the site. Usage of the name Haram al-Sharif by local Palestinians has waned in recent decades, in favor of the traditional name of Al-Aqsa Mosque.

===Jerusalem&#x27;s sacred esplanade===
Some scholars have used the terms Sacred Esplanade or Holy Esplanade as a &quot;strictly neutral term&quot; for the site. A notable example of this usage is the 2009 work &quot;Where Heaven and Earth Meet: Jerusalem&#x27;s Sacred Esplanade&quot;, written as a joint undertaking by 21 Jewish, Muslim and Christian scholars.

===Jerusalem&#x27;s Holy Esplanade===
In recent years, the term &quot;Holy Esplanade&quot; has been used by the United Nations, by its Secretary-General and by the UN&#x27;s subsidiary organs.

== Location and dimensions ==

The Temple Mount forms the northern portion of a narrow spur of hill that slopes sharply downward from north to south. Rising above the Kidron Valley to the east and Tyropoeon Valley to the west, its peak reaches a height of above sea level. In around 19 BCE, Herod the Great extended the Mount&#x27;s natural plateau by enclosing the area with four massive retaining walls and filling the voids. This artificial expansion resulted in a large flat expanse which today forms the eastern section of the Old City of Jerusalem. The trapezium shaped platform measures along the west, along the east, along the north and along the south, giving a total area of approximately . The northern wall of the Mount, together with the northern section of the western wall, is hidden behind residential buildings. The southern section of the western flank is revealed and contains what is known as the Western Wall. The retaining walls on these two sides descend many meters below ground level. A northern portion of the western wall may be seen from within the Western Wall Tunnel, which was excavated through buildings adjacent to the platform. On the southern and eastern sides, the walls are visible almost to their full height. The platform itself is separated from the rest of the Old City by the Tyropoeon Valley, though this once deep valley is now largely hidden beneath later deposits and is imperceptible in places. The platform can be reached via Gate of the Chain Street – a street in the Muslim Quarter at the level of the platform, actually sitting on a monumental bridge; the bridge is no longer externally visible due to the change in ground level, but it can be seen from beneath via the Western Wall Tunnel.

== Heritage site ==
In 1980, Jordan proposed that the Old City be listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and it was added to the List in 1981. In 1982, it was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger.

On 26 October 2016, UNESCO passed the Occupied Palestine Resolution that condemned what it described as &quot;escalating Israeli aggressions&quot; and illegal measures against the waqf, called for the restoration of Muslim access and demanded that Israel respect the historical status quo and also criticized Israel for its continuous &quot;refusal to let the body&#x27;s experts access Jerusalem&#x27;s holy sites to determine their conservation status&quot;. While the text acknowledged the &quot;importance of the Old City of Jerusalem and its walls for the three monotheistic religions&quot;, it referred to the sacred hilltop compound in Jerusalem&#x27;s Old City only by its Muslim name Al-Haram al-Sharif.

In response, Israel denounced the UNESCO resolution for its omission of the words &quot;Temple Mount&quot; or &quot;Har HaBayit&quot;, stating that it denied Jewish ties to the site. Israel froze all ties with UNESCO. In October 2017, Israel and the United States announced they would withdraw from UNESCO, citing anti-Israel bias.

On 6 April 2022, UNESCO unanimously adopted a resolution reiterating all 21 previous resolutions concerned with Jerusalem.

==Religious significance==

The Temple Mount has historical and religious significance for all three of the major Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam. It has particular religious significance for Judaism and Islam.

===Judaism===
The Temple Mount is considered the holiest site in Judaism. According to Jewish tradition, both Temples stood at the Temple Mount. Jewish tradition further places the Temple Mount as the location for a number of important events which occurred in the Bible, including the Binding of Isaac, Jacob&#x27;s dream, and the prayer of Isaac and Rebekah. According to the Talmud, the Foundation Stone is the place from where the world was created and expanded into its current form. Orthodox Jewish tradition maintains it is here that the third and final Temple will be built when the Messiah comes.

The Temple Mount is the place Jews turn towards during prayer. Jewish attitudes towards entering the site vary. Due to its extreme sanctity, many Jews will not walk on the Mount itself, to avoid unintentionally entering the area where the Holy of Holies stood, since, according to rabbinical law, there is still some aspect of the divine presence at the site.

==== The Temple ====
According to the Hebrew Bible, the Temple Mount was originally a threshing-floor owned by Araunah, a Jebusite. The Bible narrates how David united the twelve Israelite tribes, conquered Jerusalem and brought the Israelites&#x27; central artifact, the Ark of the Covenant, into the city. When a great plague struck Israel, a destroying angel appeared on Araunah&#x27;s threshing floor. The prophet Gad then suggested the area to David as a fitting place for the erection of an altar to Yawheh. David bought the property from Araunah, for fifty pieces of silver, and erected the altar. God answered his prayers and stopped the plague. David subsequently chose the site for a future temple to replace the Tabernacle and house the Ark of the Covenant; God forbade him from building it, however, because he had &quot;shed much blood&quot;.

The First Temple was instead constructed under David&#x27;s son Solomon, who became an ambitious builder of public works in ancient Israel:

Solomon placed the Ark in the Holy of Holies – the windowless innermost sanctuary and most sacred area of the temple in which God&#x27;s presence rested; entry into the Holy of Holies was heavily restricted, and only the High Priest of Israel entered the sanctuary once per year on Yom Kippur, carrying the blood of a sacrificial lamb and burning incense. According to the Bible, the site functioned as the center of all national life – a governmental, judicial and religious center.

The Genesis Rabba, which was probably written between 300 and 500 CE, states that this site is one of three about which the nations of the world cannot taunt Israel and say, &quot;you have stolen them,&quot; since it was purchased &quot;for its full price&quot; by David.

The First Temple was destroyed in 587/586 BCE by the Neo-Babylonian Empire under the second Babylonian king, Nebuchadnezzar II, who subsequently exiled the Judeans to Babylon following the fall of the Kingdom of Judah and its annexation as a Babylonian province. The Jews who had been deported in the aftermath of the Babylonian conquest of Judah were eventually allowed to return following a proclamation by the Persian king Cyrus the Great that was issued after the fall of Babylon to the Achaemenid Empire. In 516 BCE, the returned Jewish population in Judah, under Persian provincial governance, rebuilt the Temple in Jerusalem under the auspices of Zerubbabel, producing what is known as the Second Temple.

During the Second Temple Period, Jerusalem was the center of religious and national life for Jews, including those in the Diaspora. The Second Temple is believed to have attracted tens and maybe hundreds of thousands during the Three Pilgrimage Festivals. The holiday of Hanukkah commemorates the rededication of the Temple at the beginning of the Maccabean revolt in the 2nd century BCE. During the first century BCE, the Temple was renovated by Herod. It was destroyed by the Roman Empire at the height of the First Jewish-Roman War in 70 CE. Tisha B&#x27;Av, an annual fast day in Judaism, marks the destruction of the First and Second Temples, which according to Jewish tradition, occurred on the same day on the Hebrew calendar.

==== In prophecy ====
The Book of Isaiah foretells the international importance of the Temple Mount:
==== Binding of Isaac ====
In Jewish tradition, the Temple Mount is also believed to be the location of Abraham&#x27;s binding of Isaac. 2 Chronicles 3:1 refers to the Temple Mount in the time before the construction of the temple as Mount Moriah (, ). The &quot;land of Moriah&quot; (, ) is the name given by Genesis to the location of the binding of Isaac. Since at least the first century CE, the two sites have been identified with one another in Judaism, this identification being subsequently perpetuated by Jewish and Christian tradition. Modern scholarship tends to regard them as distinct (see Moriah).

==== Creation of the world ====

According to the rabbinic sages whose debates produced the Talmud, the Foundation Stone, which sits below the Dome of the Rock, was the spot from where the world was created and expanded into its current form, and where God gathered the dust used to create the first human, Adam.

==== Third Temple ====
Jewish texts predict that the Mount will be the site of a Third and final Temple, which will be rebuilt with the coming of the Messiah. The rebuilding of the Temple remained a recurring theme among generations, particularly in thrice daily Amidah (Standing prayer), central prayer of the Jewish liturgy, which contains a plea for the building of a Third Temple and the restoration of sacrificial services. A number of vocal Jewish groups now advocate building the Third Temple without delay in order to bring to pass God&#x27;s &quot;end-time prophetic plans for Israel and the entire world.&quot;

===Christianity===

The Temple was of central importance in Jewish worship in the Tanakh (Old Testament). In the New Testament, Herod&#x27;s Temple was the site of several events in the life of Jesus, and Christian loyalty to the site as a focal point remained long after his death. After the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE, which came to be regarded by early Christians, as it was by Josephus and the sages of the Jerusalem Talmud, to be a divine act of punishment for the sins of the Jewish people, the Temple Mount lost its significance for Christian worship with the Christians considering it a fulfillment of Christ&#x27;s prophecy at, for example, Matthew 23:38 and Matthew 24:2. It was to this end, proof of a biblical prophecy fulfilled and of Christianity&#x27;s victory over Judaism with the New Covenant, that early Christian pilgrims also visited the site. Byzantine Christians, despite some signs of constructive work on the esplanade, generally neglected the Temple Mount, especially when a Jewish attempt to rebuild the Temple was destroyed by the earthquake of 363. It became a desolate local rubbish dump, perhaps outside the city limits, as Christian worship in Jerusalem shifted to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and Jerusalem&#x27;s centrality was replaced by Rome.

During the Byzantine era, Jerusalem was primarily Christian and pilgrims came by the tens of thousands to experience the places where Jesus walked. After the Persian invasion in 614 many churches were razed, and the site was turned into a dump. The Arabs conquered the city from the Byzantine Empire which had retaken it in 629. The Byzantine ban on the Jews was lifted and they were allowed to live inside the city and visit the places of worship. Christian pilgrims were able to come and experience the Temple Mount area. The war between Seljuqs and Byzantine Empire and increasing Muslim violence against Christian pilgrims to Jerusalem instigated the Crusades. The Crusaders captured Jerusalem in 1099 and the Dome of the Rock was given to the Augustinians, who turned it into a church, and al-Aqsa Mosque became the royal palace of Baldwin I of Jerusalem in 1104. The Knights Templar, who believed the Dome of the Rock was the site of Solomon&#x27;s Temple, gave it the name &quot;Templum Domini&quot; and set up their headquarters in al-Aqsa Mosque adjacent to the Dome for much of the 12th century.

In Christian art, the circumcision of Jesus was conventionally depicted as taking place at the Temple, even though European artists until recently had no way of knowing what the Temple looked like and the Gospels do not state that the event took place at the Temple.

Though some Christians believe that the Temple will be reconstructed before, or concurrent with, the Second Coming of Jesus (also see dispensationalism), pilgrimage to the Temple Mount is not viewed as important in the beliefs and worship of most Christians. The New Testament recounts a story of a Samaritan woman asking Jesus about the appropriate place to worship, Jerusalem (as it was for the Jews) or Mount Gerizim (as it was for the Samaritans), to which Jesus replies:

This has been construed to mean that Jesus dispensed with physical location for worship, which was a matter rather of spirit and truth.

===Islam===
 

Among both Sunni and Shia Muslims, the entire plaza, known as the al-Aqsa Mosque, also known as Haram al-Sharif or &quot;the Noble Sanctuary&quot;, is considered the third holiest site in Islam. According to Islamic tradition, the plaza is the location of Muhammad&#x27;s ascension to heaven from Jerusalem, and served as the first &quot;qibla&quot;, the direction Muslims turn towards when praying. As in Judaism, Muslims also associate the site with Abraham, and other prophets who are also venerated in Islam. Muslims view the site as being one of the earliest and most noteworthy places of worship of God. They preferred to use the esplanade as the heart for the Muslim quarter, since it had been abandoned by Christians, to avoid disturbing the Christian quarters of Jerusalem. Umayyad Caliphs commissioned the construction of al-Aqsa Mosque on the site, including the shrine known as the &quot;Dome of the Rock&quot;. The Dome was completed in 692 CE, making it one of the oldest extant Islamic structures in the world. The Al-Aqsa Mosque, sometimes known as the Qibli Mosque, rest on the far southern side of the Mount, facing Mecca.

==== In early Islam ====
Early Islam regarded the Foundation Stone as the location of Solomon&#x27;s Temple, and the first architectural initiatives on the Temple Mount sought to glorify Jerusalem by presenting Islam as a continuation of Judaism and Christianity. Almost immediately after the Muslim conquest of Jerusalem in 638 CE, Caliph &#x27;Omar ibn al Khatab, reportedly disgusted by the filth covering the site, had it thoroughly cleaned, and granted Jews access to the site. According to early Quranic interpreters and what is generally accepted as Islamic tradition, in 638 CE Umar, upon entering a conquered Jerusalem, consulted with Ka&#x27;ab al-Ahbar – a Jewish convert to Islam who came with him from Medina – as to where the best spot would be to build a mosque. Al-Ahbar suggested to him that it should be behind the Rock &quot;... so that all of Jerusalem would be before you.&quot; Umar replied, &quot;You correspond to Judaism!&quot; Immediately after this conversation, Umar began to clean up the site – which was filled with trash and debris – with his cloak, and other Muslim followers imitated him until the site was clean. Umar then prayed at the spot where it was believed that Muhammad had prayed before his night journey, reciting the Quranic &quot;sura&quot; &quot;Sad&quot;. Thus, according to this tradition, Umar thereby reconsecrated the site as a mosque.

Muslim interpretations of the Quran agree that the Mount is the site of the Temple originally built by Solomon, considered a prophet in Islam, that was later destroyed. After the construction, Muslims believe, the temple was used for the worship of the one God by many prophets of Islam, including Jesus. Other Muslim scholars have used the Torah (called in Arabic) to expand on the details of the temple. The term &quot;Bayt al-Maqdis&quot; (or &quot;Bayt al-Muqaddas&quot;), which frequently appears as a name of Jerusalem in early Islamic sources, is a cognate of the Hebrew term &quot;bēt ha-miqdāsh&quot; (בית המקדש), the Temple in Jerusalem. Mujir al-Din, a 15th-century Jerusalemite chronicler, mentions an earlier tradition related by al-Wasti, according which &quot;after David built many cities and the situation of the children of Israel was improved, he wanted to construct Bayt al-Maqdis and build a dome over the rock in the place that Allah sanctified in Aelia.&quot;

==== Isra and Mi&#x27;raj ====
According to the Qur&#x27;an, Muhammad was transported to a site named Al-Aqsa Mosque – &quot;the furthest place of prayer&quot; (&quot;al-Masjid al-&#x27;Aqṣā&quot;) during his Night Journey (&quot;Isra and Mi&#x27;raj&quot;). The Qur&#x27;an describes how Muhammad was taken by the miraculous steed Buraq from the Great Mosque of Mecca to al-Aqsa Mosque where he prayed. After Muhammad finished his prayers, the angel Jibril (Gabriel) traveled with him to heaven, where he met several other prophets and led them in prayer:

The Qur&#x27;an does not mention the exact location of &quot;the furthest place of prayer&quot;, and the city of Jerusalem is not mentioned by any of its names in the Qur&#x27;an. According to the Encyclopaedia of Islam, the phrase was originally understood as a reference to a site in the heavens. A group of Islamic scholars understood the story of Muhammad&#x27;s ascension from al-Aqsa Mosque as relating to the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem. Another group disagreed with this identification and preferred the meaning of the term as referring to heaven. Al-Bukhari and Al-Tabari, for example, are believed to have rejected the identification with Jerusalem. Eventually, a consensus emerged around the identification of the &quot;furthest place of prayer&quot; with Jerusalem, and by implication the Temple Mount. Later &quot;hadiths&quot; referred to Jerusalem as the site of the Al-Aqsa Mosque:
Some scholars point to the political motives of the Umayyad dynasty which led to the sanctification of Jerusalem in Islam. According to the Encyclopaedia of Islam, the Night Journey was associated with Jerusalem by the Umayyads as a political means to advance the glory of Jerusalem to compete with the glory of the sanctuary in Mecca then controlled by Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr. The construction of the Dome of the Rock was interpreted by Ya&#x27;qubi, a 9th-century Abbasid historian, as an Umayyad attempt to redirect the Hajj from Mecca to Jerusalem by creating a rival to the Ka&#x27;aba.

Other academics attribute the holiness of Jerusalem to the rise and expansion of a certain type of literary genre, known as &quot;al-Fadhail&quot; or history of cities. The Fadhail of Jerusalem inspired Muslims, especially during the Umayyad period, to embellish the sanctity of the city beyond its status in the holy texts. Based on the writings of the eighth century historians Al-Waqidi and al-Azraqi, some scholars have suggested that al-Aqsa Mosque mentioned in the Qur&#x27;an is not in Jerusalem but in the village of al-Ju&#x27;ranah, 18 miles northeast of Mecca.

Later medieval scripts, as well as modern-day political tracts, tend to classify al-Aqsa Mosque as the third holiest site in Islam.

====First qibla====

The historical significance of al-Aqsa Mosque in Islam is further emphasized by the fact that Muslims turned towards al-Aqsa when they prayed for a period of 16 or 17 months after migration to Medina in 624; it thus became the &quot;qibla&quot; (&quot;direction&quot;) that Muslims faced for prayer. Muhammad later prayed towards the Kaaba in Mecca after receiving a revelation during a prayer session in the Masjid al-Qiblatayn. The &quot;qibla&quot; was relocated to the Kaaba where Muslims have been directed to pray ever since.

==== Religious status ====
The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation refers to al-Aqsa Mosque as the third holiest site in Islam (and calls for Arab sovereignty over it).

== History ==
===Pre-Israelite===
The hill is believed to have been inhabited since the 4th millennium BCE. An amulet bearing the cartouche of Thutmose III (r. 1479–1425 BCE) was discovered by the Temple Mount Sifting Project at the site in 2012.

=== Israelite period ===
According to archeologists, the Temple Mount served as the center of the religious life of biblical Jerusalem as well as the royal acropolis of the Kingdom of Judah. The First Temple is believed to have once been a part of a much larger royal complex. The Bible also mentions several other buildings constructed by Solomon at the site, including the royal palace, the &quot;House of the Lebanon Forest&quot;, the &quot;Hall of Pillars&quot;, the &quot;Hall of Throne&quot; and the &quot;House of Pharaoh&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. Some scholars believe that, in accordance with biblical accounts, the royal and religious compound on the Temple Mount was built by Solomon during the 10th century BCE as a separate entity, which was later incorporated into the city. Knauf argued that the Temple Mount already served as the cultic and governmental center of Jerusalem as early as in the Late Bronze Age. Alternatively, Na&#x27;aman suggested that Solomon built the Temple on a much smaller scale than the one described in the Bible, which was enlarged or rebuilt during the 8th century BCE. In 2014, Finkelstein, Koch and Lipschits proposed that the tell of ancient Jerusalem lies beneath the modern-day compound, rather than the nearby archeological site known as the City of David, as mainstream archaeology believes; however, this proposal was rejected by other scholars of the subject.

All scholars agree that the Iron Age Temple Mount was smaller than the Herodian compound still visible today. Some scholars, such as Kenyon and Ritmeyer, argued that the walls of the First Temple compound extended eastward as far as the Eastern Wall. Ritmeyer identifies specific courses of visible ashlars located to the north and south of the Golden Gate as Judean Iron Age in style, dating them to the construction of this wall by Hezekiah. More such stones are supposed to survive underground. Ritmeyer has also suggested that one of the steps leading to the Dome of the Rock is actually the top of a remaining stone course of the western wall of the Iron Age compound.

The First Temple was destroyed in 587/586 BCE by the Neo-Babylonian Empire under Nebuchadnezzar II.

=== Persian, Hellenistic and Hasmonean periods ===
Construction of the Second Temple began under Cyrus in around 538 BCE and was completed in 516 BCE. It was built at the original site of Solomon&#x27;s Temple.

According to Patrich and Edelcopp, the ideal area of the complex, described in Ezekiel as 50x50 cubits, was attained by the Hasmoneans, perhaps under John Hyrcanus; this is the same size later mentioned by the Mishnah.

Evidence of a Hasmonean expansion of the Temple Mount has been recovered by archaeologist Leen Ritmeyer.

In 67 BCE a quarrel broke out between Aristobulus II and Hyrcanus II on the Hasmonean throne. Roman general Pompey, who had been invited to intervene in the conflict, sided with Hyrcanus; Aristobulus and his followers barricaded themselves inside the Temple Mount and destroyed the bridge linking it to the city. When the Roman Army arrived in Jerusalem, Pompey ordered the moat defending the Temple Mount from the north to be filled in. To accomplish this, Pompey waited for Sabbaths, so the defenders would not disrupt the work. After a three-month siege, the Romans were able to topple one of the guard towers and storm the Temple Mount. Pompey himself entered the Holy of Holies, but did not harm the Temple, and allowed the priests to continue their work as usual.

=== Herodian and early Roman periods ===

Around 19 BCE, Herod the Great further expanded the Temple Mount and rebuilt the temple. The ambitious project, which involved the employment of 10,000 workers, more than doubled the size of the Temple Mount to approximately . Herod leveled the area by cutting away rock on the northwest side and raising the sloping ground to the south. He achieved this by constructing huge buttress walls and vaults and filling the necessary sections with earth and rubble. The result was the largest temenos in the ancient world.

The main entrances to the Herodian Temple Mount were two sets of gates built into the southern wall, together with four other gates reachable from the western side by stairs and bridges. Grand stoas encircled the platform on three sides, and on its southern side stood a magnificent basilica Josephus referred to as the Royal Stoa. The Royal Stoa served as a center for the city&#x27;s commercial and legal transactions, and was provided with separate access to the city below via the Robinson&#x27;s Arch overpass. The Temple itself and its courts were located on an elevated platform in the middle of the larger compound. In addition to the restoration of the Temple, its courtyards and porticoes, Herod also built the Antonia Fortress, which dominated the northwestern corner of the Temple Mount, and a rainwater reservoir, Birket Israel, in the northeast. A monumental street, today referred to as the &quot;Stepped Street&quot;, took pilgrims from the city&#x27;s southern gate via the Tyropoeon Valley to the western side of the Temple Mount. It has been proposed in 2019 that Pontius Pilate constructed the road during the 30s.

During the early phases of the First Jewish-Roman War (66–70 CE), the Temple Mount became a center of fighting for various Jewish factions struggling for control of the city, with different factions holding the area during the conflict. In April 70, the Roman army under Titus reached Jerusalem and began besieging the city. It took the Romans four months to defeat the Temple Mount&#x27;s defenders and take the site. The Romans completely destroyed the Temple and all the other structures on the platform. Massive stone collapses from the upper walls were discovered laying over the Herodian street that runs along the southern part of the Western Wall, with some of the stones burned at temperatures reaching 800 °C (1472 °F). The Trumpeting Place inscription, a monumental Hebrew inscription which was thrown down by Roman legionnaires, was found in one of these stone piles.

=== Middle Roman period ===
The city of Aelia Capitolina was built in 130 CE by the Roman emperor Hadrian and occupied by a Roman colony on the site of Jerusalem, which was still in ruins from the First Jewish Revolt in 70 CE. &quot;Aelia&quot; came from Hadrian&#x27;s &quot;nomen gentile&quot;, &quot;Aelius&quot;, while &quot;Capitolina&quot; meant that the new city was dedicated to Jupiter Capitolinus, to whom a temple was built overlapping the site of the former second Jewish temple, the Temple Mount.

Hadrian had intended the construction of the new city as a gift to the Jews, but since he had constructed a giant statue of himself in front of the Temple of Jupiter and the Temple of Jupiter had a huge statue of Jupiter inside it, there were on the Temple Mount now two enormous graven images, which Jews considered idolatrous. It was also customary in Roman rites to sacrifice a pig in land purification ceremonies. After the Third Jewish Revolt, all Jews were forbidden on pain of death from entering the city or the surrounding territory around the city.

=== Late Roman period ===

From the first through the seventh centuries Christianity spread throughout the Roman Empire, gradually became the predominant religion of Palestine and under the Byzantines Jerusalem itself was almost completely Christian, with most of the population being Jacobite Christians of the Syrian rite.

Emperor Constantine I promoted the Christianization of Roman society, giving it precedence over pagan cults. One consequence was that Hadrian&#x27;s Temple to Jupiter on the Temple Mount was demolished immediately following the First Council of Nicea in 325 CE on orders of Constantine.

The Bordeaux Pilgrim, who visited Jerusalem in 333–334, during the reign of Emperor Constantine I, wrote that &quot;There are two statues of Hadrian, and, not far from them, a pierced stone to which the Jews come every year and anoint. They mourn and rend their garments, and then depart.&quot; The occasion is assumed to have been Tisha b&#x27;Av, since decades later Jerome related that that was the only day on which Jews were permitted to enter Jerusalem.

Constantine&#x27;s nephew Emperor Julian granted permission in the year 363 for the Jews to rebuild the Temple. In a letter attributed to Julian he wrote to the Jews that &quot;This you ought to do, in order that, when I have successfully concluded the war in Persia, I may rebuild by my own efforts the sacred city of Jerusalem, which for so many years you have longed to see inhabited, and may bring settlers there, and, together with you, may glorify the Most High God therein.&quot; Julian saw the Jewish God as a fitting member of the pantheon of gods he believed in, and he was also a strong opponent of Christianity. Church historians wrote that the Jews began to clear away the structures and rubble on the Temple Mount but were thwarted, first by a great earthquake, and then by miracles that included fire springing from the earth. However, no contemporary Jewish sources mention this episode directly.

=== Byzantine period ===

During his excavations in the 1930s, Robert Hamilton uncovered portions of a multicolor mosaic floor with geometric patterns, but did not publish them. The date of the mosaic is disputed: Zachi Dvira considers that they are from the pre-Islamic Byzantine period, while Baruch, Reich and Sandhaus favor a much later Umayyad origin on account of their similarity to a mosaic from an Umayyad palace excavated adjacent to the Temple Mount&#x27;s southern wall. By comparing the photographs to Hamilton&#x27;s excavation report, Di Cesare determined that they belong to the second phase of mosque construction in the Umayyad period. Moreover, the mosaic designs were common in Islamic, Jewish and Christian buildings from the 2nd to the 8th century. Di Cesare suggested that Hamilton didn&#x27;t include the mosaics in his book because they were destroyed to explore beneath them.

=== Sassanid period ===
In 610, the Sassanid Empire drove the Byzantine Empire out of the Middle East, giving the Jews control of Jerusalem for the first time in centuries. The Jews in Palestine were allowed to set up a vassal state under the Sassanid Empire called the &quot;Sassanid Jewish Commonwealth&quot; which lasted for five years. Jewish rabbis ordered the restart of animal sacrifice for the first time since the time of Second Temple and started to reconstruct the Jewish Temple. Shortly before the Byzantines took the area back five years later in 615, the Persians gave control to the Christian population, who tore down the partially built Jewish Temple edifice and turned it into a garbage dump, which is what it was when the Rashidun Caliph Umar took the city in 637.

=== Early Muslim period ===

In 637, Arabs besieged and captured the city from the Byzantine Empire, which had defeated the Persian forces and their allies, and reconquered the city. There are no contemporary records, but many traditions, about the origin of the main Islamic buildings on the mount. A popular account from later centuries is that the Rashidun Caliph Umar was led to the place reluctantly by the Christian patriarch Sophronius. He found it covered with rubbish, but the sacred Rock was found with the help of a converted Jew, Ka&#x27;b al-Ahbar. Al-Ahbar advised Umar to build a mosque to the north of the rock, so that worshippers would face both the rock and Mecca, but instead Umar chose to build it to the south of the rock. It became known as al-Aqsa Mosque. According to Muslim sources, Jews participated in the construction of the haram, laying the groundwork for both al-Aqsa and the Dome of the Rock mosques. The first known eyewitness testimony is that of the pilgrim Arculf who visited about 670. According to Arculf&#x27;s account as recorded by Adomnán, he saw a rectangular wooden house of prayer built over some ruins, large enough to hold 3,000 people.

In 691, an octagonal Islamic building topped by a dome was built by the Caliph Abd al-Malik around the rock, for a myriad of political, dynastic and religious reasons, built on local and Quranic traditions articulating the site&#x27;s holiness, a process in which textual and architectural narratives reinforced one another. The shrine became known as the Dome of the Rock (, &quot;Qubbat as-Sakhra&quot;). (The dome itself was covered in gold in 1920.) In 715, the Umayyads, led by the Caliph al-Walid I, built al-Aqsa Mosque (, &quot;al-Masjid al-&#x27;Aqṣā&quot;,  &quot;Furthest Mosque&quot;), corresponding to the Islamic belief of Muhammad&#x27;s miraculous nocturnal journey as recounted in the Quran and hadith. The term &quot;Noble Sanctuary&quot; or &quot;Haram al-Sharif&quot;, as it was called later by the Mamluks and Ottomans, refers to the entirer area that surrounds that Rock.

=== Crusader and Ayyubid period ===

The Crusader period began in 1099 with the First Crusade&#x27;s capture of Jerusalem. After the city&#x27;s conquest, the Crusading order known as the Knights Templar was granted use of Al-Aqsa Mosque to use as their headquarters. This was probably by Baldwin II of Jerusalem and Warmund, Patriarch of Jerusalem at the Council of Nablus in January 1120. The Temple Mount had a mystique because it was above what were believed to be the ruins of the Temple of Solomon. The Crusaders therefore referred to al-Aqsa Mosque as Solomon&#x27;s Temple, and it was from this location that the new Order took the name of &quot;Poor Knights of Christ and the Temple of Solomon&quot;, or &quot;Templar&quot; knights.

In 1187, once he retook Jerusalem, Saladin removed all traces of Christian worship from the Temple Mount, returning the Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa Mosque to their Muslim purposes. It remained in Muslim hands thereafter, even during the relatively short periods of Crusader rule following the Sixth Crusade.

=== Mamluk period ===
There are several Mamluk buildings on and around the Haram esplanade, such as the late 15th-century al-Ashrafiyya Madrasa and Sabil (fountain) of Qaytbay. The Mamluks also raised the level of Jerusalem&#x27;s Central or Tyropoean Valley bordering the Temple Mount from the west by constructing huge substructures, on which they then built on a large scale. The Mamluk-period substructures and over-ground buildings are thus covering much of the Herodian western wall of the Temple Mount.

=== Ottoman period ===

Following the Ottoman conquest of Palestine in 1516, the Ottoman authorities continued the policy of prohibiting non-Muslims from setting foot on the Temple Mount until the early 19th century, when non-Muslims were again permitted to visit the site.

In 1867, a team from the Royal Engineers, led by Lieutenant Charles Warren and financed by the Palestine Exploration Fund (P.E.F.), discovered a series of tunnels near the Temple Mount. Warren secretly excavated some tunnels near the Temple Mount walls and was the first one to document their lower courses. Warren also conducted some small-scale excavations inside the Temple Mount, by removing rubble that blocked passages leading from the Double Gate chamber.

=== British Mandatory period ===

Between 1922 and 1924, the Dome of the Rock was restored by the Islamic Higher Council. The Zionist movement at the time was strongly opposed to any notion that the Temple itself might be rebuilt. Indeed, its armed wing, the Haganah militia, assassinated a Jewish man when his plan to blow up the Islamic sites on the Haram came to their attention in 1931. Renovations were also conducted at the Al-Aqsa Mosque from 1938–1942, following an earthquake in the summer of 1937.

=== Jordanian period ===
Jordan undertook two renovations of the Dome of the Rock, replacing the leaking, wooden inner dome with an aluminum dome in 1952, and, when the new dome leaked, carrying out a second restoration between 1959 and 1964.

Neither Israeli Arabs nor Israeli Jews could visit their holy places in the Jordanian territories during this period.

=== Israeli period ===

On 7 June 1967, during the Six-Day War, Israeli forces advanced beyond the 1949 Armistice Agreement Line into West Bank territories, taking control of the Old City of Jerusalem, inclusive of the Temple Mount.

The Chief Rabbi of the Israeli Defense Forces, Shlomo Goren, led the soldiers in religious celebrations on the Temple Mount and at the Western Wall. The Israeli Chief Rabbinate also declared a religious holiday on the anniversary, called &quot;Yom Yerushalayim&quot; (Jerusalem Day), which became a national holiday to commemorate the reunification of Jerusalem. Many saw the capture of Jerusalem and the Temple Mount as a miraculous liberation of biblical-messianic proportions. A few days after the war over 200,000 Jews flocked to the Western Wall in the first mass Jewish pilgrimage near the Mount since the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE. Islamic authorities did not disturb Goren when he went to pray on the Mount until, on the Ninth Day of Av, he brought 50 followers and introduced both a shofar, and a portable ark to pray, an innovation which alarmed the Waqf authorities and led to a deterioration of relations between the Muslim authorities and the Israeli government.

In June 1969, an Australian set fire to the Jami&#x27;a al-Aqsa. On April 11, 1982, a Jew hid in the Dome of the Rock and sprayed gunfire, killing 2 Palestinians and wounding 44; in 1974, 1977 and 1983 groups led by Yoel Lerner conspired to blow up both the Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa. On 26 January 1984 Waqf guards detected members of B&#x27;nei Yehuda, a messianic cult of former gangsters turned mystics based in Lifta, trying to infiltrate the area to blow it up.

On 15 January 1988, during the First Intifada, Israeli troops fired rubber bullets and tear gas at protesters outside the mosque, wounding 40 worshipers.

On October 8, 1990, Israeli forces patrolling the site blocked worshippers from reaching it. A tear gas canister was set off among the female worshippers, which caused events to escalate. On 12 October 1990 Palestinian Muslims protested violently the intention of some extremist Jews to lay a cornerstone on the site for a New Temple as a prelude to the destruction of the Muslim mosques. The attempt was blocked by Israeli authorities but demonstrators were widely reported as having stoned Jews at the Western Wall. According to Palestinian historian Rashid Khalidi, investigative journalism has shown this allegation to be false. Rocks were eventually thrown, while security forces fired rounds that killed 21 people and injuring 150 more. An Israeli inquiry found Israeli forces at fault, but it also concluded that charges could not be brought against any particular individuals.

On 8 October 1990, 22 Palestinians were killed and over 100 others injured by Israeli Border Police during protests that were triggered by the announcement of the Temple Mount Faithful, a group of religious Jews, that they were going to lay the cornerstone of the Third Temple. Between 1992 and 1994, the Jordanian government undertook the unprecedented step of gilding the dome of the Dome of the Rock, covering it with 5000 gold plates, and restoring and reinforcing the structure. Saladin&#x27;s minbar was also reconstructed. The project was paid for by King Hussein personally, at a cost of $8 million. The Temple Mount remains, under the terms of the 1994 Israel–Jordan peace treaty, under Jordanian custodianship. In December 1997, Israeli security services preempted an attempt by Jewish extremists to throw a pig&#x27;s head wrapped in the pages of the Quran into the area, in order to spark a riot and embarrass the government.

On 28 September 2000, then-opposition leader of Israel Ariel Sharon and members of the Likud Party, along with 1,000 armed guards, visited the al-Aqsa compound. The visit was seen as a provocative gesture by many Palestinians, who gathered around the site. After Sharon and the Likud Party members left, a demonstration erupted and Palestinians on the grounds of the Haram al-Sharif began throwing stones and other projectiles at Israeli riot police. Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at the crowd, injuring 24 people. The visit sparked a five-year uprising by the Palestinians, commonly referred to as the al-Aqsa Intifada, though some commentators, citing subsequent speeches by Palestinian Authority officials, particularly Imad Falouji and Yasar Arafat, claim that the Intifada had been planned months in advance, as early as July upon Arafat&#x27;s return from Camp David talks in the United States. On 29 September, the Israeli government deployed 2,000 riot police to the mosque. When a group of Palestinians left the mosque after Friday prayers (&quot;Jumu&#x27;ah,&quot;) they hurled stones at the police. The police then stormed the mosque compound, firing both live ammunition and rubber bullets at the group of Palestinians, killing four and wounding about 200.

On 3 January 2023, Israeli Minister of National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir visited the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, sparking protests by Palestinians and the condemnation of several Arab countries.

== Status quo ==

=== Under Muslim control ===
Jews were not allowed to visit for approximately one thousand years.

===British Mandate===
In the first ten years of British rule in Palestine, all were allowed entry to the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif complex. Sometimes violence broke out at the entrance between Jews and Muslims. During the 1929 Palestine riots, Jews were accused of violating the status quo. Following the riots, the Supreme Muslim Council and the Jerusalem Islamic Waqf prohibited Jews from entering the site&#x27;s gates. During the mandate period, Jewish leaders celebrated ancient religious practices at the Western Wall. The ban on visitors continued until 1948

===Jordanian control===
Although the 1949 Armistice Agreement called for &quot;resumption of the normal functioning of the cultural and humanitarian institutions on Mount Scopus and free access thereto; free access to the Holy Places and cultural institutions and use of the cemetery on the Mount of Olives&quot;, in practice, wire and concrete barriers were the reality. Cultural and religious sites in both sides of the city were destroyed and neglected and the Jewish community barred from its sacred places.

=== Under Israeli control ===

A few days after the Six-Day War, on June 17, 1967, a meeting was held at the al-Aqsa mosque between Moshe Dayan and Muslim religious authorities of Jerusalem reformulating the status quo. Jews were given the right to visit the Temple Mount unobstructed and free of charge if they respected Muslims&#x27; religious feelings and acted decently, but they were not allowed to pray. The Western Wall was to remain the Jewish place of prayer. &#x27;Religious sovereignty&#x27; was to remain with the Muslims while &#x27;overall sovereignty&#x27; became Israeli. The Muslims objected to Dayan&#x27;s offer, as they completely rejected the Israeli conquest of Jerusalem and the Temple Mount. Some Jews, led by Shlomo Goren, then the military chief rabbi, had objected as well, claiming the decision handed over the complex to the Muslims, since the Western Wall&#x27;s holiness is derived from the Mount and symbolizes exile, while praying on the Mount symbolizes freedom and the return of the Jewish people to their homeland. The President of the High Court of Justice, Aharon Barak, in response to an appeal in 1976 against police interference with an individual&#x27;s putative right to prayer on the site, expressed the view that, while Jews had a right to prayer there, it was not absolute but subject to the public interest and the rights of other groups. Israel&#x27;s courts have considered the issue as one beyond their remit, and, given the delicacy of the matter, under political jurisdiction. Barak wrote:

Police continued to forbid Jews to pray on the Temple Mount. Subsequently, several prime ministers also made attempts to change the status quo but failed. In October 1986, an agreement between the Temple Mount Faithful, the Supreme Muslim Council and police, which would allow short visits in small groups, was exercised once and never repeated, after 2,000 Muslims armed with stones and bottles attacked the group and stoned worshipers at the Western Wall. During the 1990s, additional attempts were made for Jewish prayer on the Temple Mount, which were stopped by Israeli police.

Until 2000, non-Muslim visitors could enter the Dome of the Rock, al-Aqsa Mosque and the Islamic Museum by getting a ticket from the . This procedure ended when the Second Intifada erupted. Fifteen years later, negotiation between Israel and Jordan might result in reopening of those sites once again.

In the 2010s, fear arose among Palestinians that Israel planned to change the status quo and permit Jewish prayers or that al-Aqsa mosque might be damaged or destroyed by Israel. Al-Aqsa was used as a base for attacks on visitors and the police from which stones, firebombs and fireworks were thrown. The Israeli police had never entered al-Aqsa Mosque until November 5, 2014, when dialog with the leaders of the and the rioters failed. This resulted in imposing strict limitations on entry of visitors to the Temple Mount. Israeli leadership repeatedly stated that the status quo would not change. According to then Jerusalem police commissioner Yohanan Danino, the place is at the center of a &quot;holy war&quot; and &quot;anyone who wants to change the status quo on the Temple Mount should not be allowed up there&quot;, citing an &quot;extreme right-wing agenda to change the status quo on the Temple Mount&quot;; Hamas and Islamic Jihad continued to erroneously assert that the Israeli government planned to destroy the al-Aqsa Mosque, resulting in chronic terrorist attacks and rioting.

There have been several changes to the status quo:

# Jewish visits are often prevented or considerably restricted.
# Jews and other non-Islamic visitors can only visit from Sunday to Thursday, for four hours each day.
# Visits inside the mosques are not allowed.
# Jews with religious appearance must visit in groups monitored by guards and policemen.

Many Palestinians believe the status quo is threatened since right-wing Israelis have been challenging it with more force and frequency, asserting a religious right to pray there. Until Israel banned them, members of Murabitat, a group of women, cried &#x27;Allah Akbar&#x27; at groups of Jewish visitors to remind them the Temple Mount was still in Muslim hands. In October 2021, a Jewish man, Aryeh Lippo, who was banned by Israeli police from the Temple Mount for fifteen days after being caught quietly praying, had his ban overturned by an Israeli court on the grounds that his behavior had not violated police instructions. Hamas called the ruling &quot;a clear declaration of war&quot;. A higher Israel court quickly reversed the lower court&#x27;s ruling.

== Management and access ==
An Islamic Waqf has managed the Temple Mount continuously since the Muslim reconquest of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem in 1187. On June 7, 1967, soon after Israel had taken control of the area during the Six-Day War, Prime Minister Levi Eshkol assured that &quot;no harm whatsoever shall come to the places sacred to all religions&quot;. Together with the extension of Israeli jurisdiction and administration over east Jerusalem, the Knesset passed the Preservation of the Holy Places Law, ensuring protection of the Holy Places against desecration, as well as freedom of access thereto. The site remains within the area controlled by the State of Israel, with administration of the site remaining in the hands of the Jerusalem Islamic Waqf.

Although freedom of access was enshrined in the law, as a security measure, the Israeli government now enforces a ban on non-Muslim prayer on the site. Non-Muslims who are observed praying on the site are subject to expulsion by the police. At various times, when there is fear of Arab rioting upon the mount resulting in throwing stones from above towards the Western Wall Plaza, Israel has prevented Muslim men under 45 from praying in the compound, citing these concerns. Sometimes such restrictions have coincided with Friday prayers during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. Normally, West Bank Palestinians are allowed access to Jerusalem only during Islamic holidays, with access usually restricted to men over 35 and women of any age eligible for permits to enter the city. Palestinian residents of Jerusalem, which because of Israel&#x27;s annexation of Jerusalem, hold Israeli permanent residency cards, and Israeli Arabs, are permitted unrestricted access to the Temple Mount. The Mughrabi Gate is the only entrance to the Temple Mount accessible to non-Muslims.

== Jewish attitudes towards entering the site ==

Due to religious restrictions on entering the most sacred areas of the Temple Mount (see following section), the Western Wall, a retaining wall for the Temple Mount and remnant of the Second Temple structure, is considered by some rabbinical authorities to be the holiest accessible site for Jews to pray. A 2013 Knesset committee hearing considered allowing Jews to pray at the site, amidst heated debate. Arab-Israeli MPs were ejected for disrupting the hearing, after shouting at the chairman, calling her a &quot;pyromaniac&quot;. Religious Affairs Minister Eli Ben-Dahan of Jewish Home said his ministry was seeking legal ways to enable Jews to pray at the site.

=== Jewish religious law concerning entry to the site ===

During Temple times, entry to the Mount was limited by a complex set of purity laws. Persons suffering from corpse uncleanness were not allowed to enter the inner court. Non-Jews were also prohibited from entering the inner court of the Temple. A hewn stone measuring and engraved with Greek uncials was discovered in 1871 near a court on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem in which it outlined this prohibition:

Translation: &quot;Let no foreigner enter within the parapet and the partition which surrounds the Temple precincts. Anyone caught [violating] will be held accountable for his ensuing death.&quot; Today, the stone is preserved in Istanbul&#x27;s Museum of Antiquities.

Maimonides wrote that it was only permitted to enter the site to fulfill a religious precept. After the destruction of the Temple there was discussion as to whether the site, bereft of the Temple, still maintained its holiness. Jewish codifiers accepted the opinion of Maimonides who ruled that the holiness of the Temple sanctified the site for eternity and consequently the restrictions on entry to the site remain in force. While secular Jews ascend freely, the question of whether ascending is permitted is a matter of some debate among religious authorities, with a majority holding that it is permitted to ascend to the Temple Mount, but not to step on the site of the inner courtyards of the ancient Temple. The question then becomes whether the site can be ascertained accurately.

There is debate over whether reports that Maimonides himself ascended the Mount are reliable. One such report claims that he did so on Thursday, October 21, 1165, during the Crusader period. Some early scholars however, claim that entry onto certain areas of the Mount is permitted. It appears that Radbaz also entered the Mount and advised others how to do this. He permits entry from all the gates into the 135 x 135 cubits of the Women&#x27;s Courtyard in the east, since the biblical prohibition only applies to the 187 x 135 cubits of the Temple in the west. There are also Christian and Islamic sources which indicate that Jews visited the site, but these visits may have been made under duress.

Those persons who suffered a nocturnal emission and who have not yet immersed themselves in a ritual bath were permitted to enter the Court of the Israelites, but were prohibited from entering the Court of the Levites and the Court of the Priests until they had immersed. Entrance into the areas of the other two courts was strictly forbidden to those who had not immersed themselves and who had been defiled by corpse uncleanness and who had not yet been purified. Since the latter state of impurity is pervasive, and since there is an inability to be purified from its effects, many rabbis forbid entrance into the Temple Mount altogether as a safeguard.

=== Opinions of contemporary rabbis concerning entry to the site ===

A few hours after the Temple Mount came under Israeli control during the Six-Day War, a message from the Chief Rabbis of Israel, Isser Yehuda Unterman and Yitzhak Nissim was broadcast, warning that Jews were not permitted to enter the site. This warning was reiterated by the Council of the Chief Rabbinate a few days later, which issued an explanation written by Rabbi Bezalel Jolti (Zolti) that &quot;Since the sanctity of the site has never ended, it is forbidden to enter the Temple Mount until the Temple is built.&quot; The signatures of more than 300 prominent rabbis were later obtained.

A major critic of the decision of the Chief Rabbinate was Rabbi Shlomo Goren, the chief rabbi of the IDF. According to General Uzi Narkiss, who led the Israeli force that conquered the Temple Mount, Goren proposed to him that the Dome of the Rock be immediately blown up. After Narkiss refused, Goren unsuccessfully petitioned the government to close off the Mount to Jews and non-Jews alike. Later he established his office on the Mount and conducted a series of demonstrations on the Mount in support of the right of Jewish men to enter there. His behavior displeased the government, which restricted his public actions, censored his writings, and in August prevented him from attending the annual Oral Law Conference at which the question of access to the Mount was debated. Although there was considerable opposition, the conference consensus was to confirm the ban on entry to Jews. The ruling said &quot;We have been warned, since time immemorial [], against entering the entire area of the Temple Mount and have indeed avoided doing so.&quot; According to Ron Hassner, the ruling &quot;brilliantly&quot; solved the government&#x27;s problem of avoiding ethnic conflict, since those Jews who most respected rabbinical authority were those most likely to clash with Muslims on the Mount.

Rabbinical consensus in the post-1967 period, held that it is forbidden for Jews to enter any part of the Temple Mount, and in January 2005, a declaration was signed confirming the 1967 decision.

Most Haredi rabbis are of the opinion that the Mount is off limits to Jews and non-Jews alike. Their opinions against entering the Temple Mount are based on the current political climate surrounding the Mount, along with the potential danger of entering the hallowed area of the Temple courtyard and the impossibility of fulfilling the ritual requirement of cleansing oneself with the ashes of a red heifer. The boundaries of the areas which are completely forbidden, while having large portions in common, are delineated differently by various rabbinic authorities.

However, there is a growing body of Modern Orthodox and national religious rabbis who encourage visits to certain parts of the Mount, which they believe are permitted according to most medieval rabbinical authorities. These rabbis include: Shlomo Goren (former Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi of Israel); Chaim David Halevi (former Chief Rabbi of Tel Aviv and Yafo); Dov Lior (Rabbi of Kiryat Arba); Yosef Elboim; Yisrael Ariel; She&#x27;ar Yashuv Cohen (Chief Rabbi of Haifa); Yuval Sherlo (rosh yeshiva of the hesder yeshiva of Petah Tikva); Meir Kahane. One of them, Shlomo Goren, held that it is possible that Jews are even allowed to enter the heart of the Dome of the Rock in time of war, according to Jewish Law of Conquest. These authorities demand an attitude of veneration on the part of Jews ascending the Temple Mount, ablution in a mikveh prior to the ascent, and the wearing of non-leather shoes. Some rabbinic authorities are now of the opinion that it is imperative for Jews to ascend in order to halt the ongoing process of Islamization of the Temple Mount. Maimonides, perhaps the greatest codifier of Jewish Law, wrote in &quot;Laws of the Chosen House ch 7 Law 15&quot; &quot;One may bring a dead body in to the (lower sanctified areas of the) Temple Mount and there is no need to say that the ritually impure (from the dead) may enter there, because the dead body itself can enter&quot;. One who is ritually impure through direct or in-direct contact of the dead cannot walk in the higher sanctified areas. For those who are visibly Jewish, they have no choice, but to follow a peripheral route as it has become unofficially part of the status quo on the Mount. Many of these recent opinions rely on archaeological evidence.

In December 2013, the two Chief Rabbis of Israel, David Lau and Yitzhak Yosef, reiterated the ban on Jews entering the Temple Mount. They wrote, &quot;In light of [those] neglecting [this ruling], we once again warn that nothing has changed and this strict prohibition remains in effect for the entire area [of the Temple Mount]&quot;. In November 2014, the Sephardic chief rabbi Yitzhak Yosef reiterated the point of view held by many rabbinic authorities that Jews should not visit the Mount.

On the occasion of an upsurge in Palestinian knifing attacks on Israelis, associated with fears that Israel was changing the status quo on the Mount, the Haredi newspaper Mishpacha ran a notification in Arabic asking, &#x27;their cousins&#x27;, Palestinians, to stop trying to murder members of their congregation, since they were vehemently opposed to ascending the Mount and consider such visits proscribed by Jewish law.

== Features ==

=== Courtyard ===
The large courtyard (&quot;sahn&quot;) can host more than 400,000 worshippers, making it one of the largest mosques in the world.

====Upper platform====
The upper platform surrounds the Dome of the Rock, beneath which lies the Well of Souls, originally accessible only by a narrow hole in the Sakhrah, the foundation stone on which the Dome of the Rock site and after which it is named, until the Crusaders dug a new entrance to the cave from the south. The platform is accessible via eight staircases, each of which is topped by a free-standing arcade known in Arabic as the &quot;qanatir&quot; or &quot;mawazin&quot;. The arcades were erected in different periods from the 10th to 15th centuries.

There is also a smaller domed building on the upper platform, to the east of the Dome of the Rock, known as the Dome of the Chain (&quot;Qubbat al-Sisila&quot; in Arabic). Its exact origin and purpose is uncertain but historical sources indicate it was built under the reign of Abd al-Malik, the same Umayyad caliph who built the Dome of the Rock. Two other small domes stand to the northwest of the Dome of the Rock. The Dome of the Ascension (&quot;Qubbat al-Miraj&quot; in Arabic) has an inscription with a date corresponding to 1201 CE. It may have been a former Crusader structure, possibly a baptistery, that was repurposed at this time, or it may be a structure that was built after Saladin&#x27;s capture of the city and reused some Crusader-era materials, including its columns. Per its name, this dome commemorates the spot where, according to some, Muhammad ascended to heaven. The Dome of the Spirits or Dome of the Winds (&quot;Qubbat al-Arwah&quot; in Arabic) stands a little further north and is dated to the 16th century.

In the southwest corner of the upper platform is a quadrangular structure which includes a portion topped by another dome. It is known as the Dome of Literature (&quot;Qubba Nahwiyya&quot; in Arabic) and dated to 1208. Standing further east, close to one of the southern entrance arcades, is a stone &quot;minbar&quot; known as the &quot;Summer Pulpit&quot; or Minbar of Burhan al-Din, used for open-air prayers. It appears to be an older ciborium from the Crusader period, as attested by its sculptural decoration, which was then reused under the Ayyubids. Sometime after 1345, a Mamluk judge named Burhan al-Din (d. 1388) restored it and added a stone staircase, giving it its present form.

==== Lower platform ====

The lower platform – which constitutes most of the surface of the Temple Mount – has at its southern end al-Aqsa Mosque, which takes up most of the width of the Mount. Gardens take up the eastern and most of the northern side of the platform; the far north of the platform houses an Islamic school.

The lower platform also houses an ablution fountain (known as &quot;al-Kas&quot;), originally supplied with water via a long narrow aqueduct leading from the so-called &quot;Solomon&#x27;s Pools&quot; near Bethlehem, but now supplied from Jerusalem&#x27;s water mains.

There are several cisterns beneath the lower platform, designed to collect rainwater as a water supply. These have various forms and structures, seemingly built in different periods, ranging from vaulted chambers built in the gap between the bedrock and the platform, to chambers cut into the bedrock itself. Of these, the most notable are (numbering traditionally follows Wilson&#x27;s scheme):
* Cistern 1 (located under the northern side of the upper platform). There is a speculation that it had a function connected with the altar of the Second Temple (and possibly of the earlier Temple), or with the &quot;bronze sea&quot;.
* Cistern 5 (located under the southeastern corner of the upper platform)a long and narrow chamber, with a strange anti-clockwise curved section at its northwestern corner and containing within it a doorway currently blocked by earth. The cistern&#x27;s position and design is such that there has been speculation it had a function connected with the altar of the Second Temple (and possibly of the earlier Temple), or with the &quot;bronze sea&quot;. Charles Warren thought that the &quot;altar of burnt offerings&quot; was located at the northwestern end.
* Cistern 8 (located just north of the al-Aqsa Mosque)known as the &quot;Great Sea&quot;, a large rock hewn cavern, the roof supported by pillars carved from the rock; the chamber is particularly cave-like and atmospheric, and its maximum water capacity is several hundred thousand gallons.
* Cistern 9 (located just south of cistern 8, and directly under the al-Aqsa Mosque)known as the &quot;Well of the Leaf&quot; due to its leaf-shaped plan, is also rock hewn.
* Cistern 11 (located east of cistern 9)a set of vaulted rooms forming a plan shaped like the letter E. Probably the largest cistern, it has the potential to house over 700,000 gallons of water.
* Cistern 16/17 (located at the centre of the far northern end of the Temple Mount). Despite the currently narrow entrances, this cistern (17 and 16 are the same cistern) is a large, vaulted chamber, which Warren described as looking like the inside of the cathedral at Cordoba (which was previously a mosque). Warren believed that it was almost certainly built for some other purpose and was only adapted into a cistern at a later date; he suggested that it might have been part of a general vault supporting the northern side of the platform, in which case substantially more of the chamber exists than is used for a cistern.

=== Gates ===

:Sealed gates
The retaining walls of the platform contain several gateways, all now blocked. In the eastern wall is the Golden Gate, through which legend states the Jewish Messiah would enter Jerusalem. On the southern face are the Hulda Gates – the &quot;triple gate&quot; (which has three arches) and the &quot;double gate&quot; (which has two arches and is partly obscured by a Crusader building); these were the entrance and exit (respectively) to the Temple Mount from Ophel (the oldest part of Jerusalem), and the main access to the Mount for ordinary Jews. In the western face, near the southern corner, is the Barclay&#x27;s Gate – only half visible due to a building (the &quot;house of Abu Sa&#x27;ud&quot;) on the northern side. Also in the western face, hidden by later construction but visible via the recent Western Wall Tunnels, and only rediscovered by Warren, is Warren&#x27;s Gate; the function of these western gates is obscure, but many Jews view Warren&#x27;s Gate as particularly holy, due to its location due west of the Dome of the Rock. The current location of the Dome of the Rock is considered one of the possible locations where the Holy of Holies was placed; numerous alternative opinions exist, based on study and calculations, such as those of Tuvia Sagiv.

Warren was able to investigate the inside of these gates. Warren&#x27;s Gate and the Golden Gate simply head toward the centre of the Mount, giving access to the surface by steps. Barclay&#x27;s Gate is similar, but abruptly turns south as it does so; the reason for this is unknown. The double and triple gates (the &quot;Huldah Gates&quot;) are more substantial; heading into the Mount for some distance they each finally have steps rising to the surface just north of al-Aqsa Mosque. The passageway for each is vaulted, and has two aisles (in the case of the triple gate, a third aisle exists for a brief distance beyond the gate); the eastern aisle of the double gates and western aisle of the triple gates reach the surface, the other aisles terminating some way before the steps. Warren believed that one aisle of each original passage was extended when al-Aqsa Mosque blocked the original surface exits.

In the process of investigating Cistern 10, Warren discovered tunnels that lay &quot;under&quot; the Triple Gate passageway. These passages lead in erratic directions, some leading beyond the southern edge of the Temple Mount (they are at a depth below the base of the walls); their purpose is unknown – as is whether they predate the Temple Mount – a situation not helped by the fact that apart from Warren&#x27;s expedition no one else is known to have visited them.

Altogether, there are six major sealed gates and a postern, listed here counterclockwise, dating from either the Roman/Herodian, Byzantine, or Early Muslim periods:
* Bab al-Jana&#x27;iz/al-Buraq (Gate of the Funerals/of al-Buraq); eastern wall; a hardly noticeable postern, or maybe an improvised gate, a short distance south of the Golden Gate
* Golden Gate (Bab al-Zahabi); eastern wall (northern third), a double gate:
::Bab al-Rahma (Door of Mercy) is the southern opening,
::Bab al-Tauba (Door of Repentance) is the northern opening
* Warren&#x27;s Gate; western wall, now only visible from the Western Wall Tunnel
* Bab an-Nabi (Gate of the Prophet) or Barclay&#x27;s Gate; western wall, visible from al-Buraq Mosque inside the Haram, and from the Western Wall plaza (women&#x27;s section) and the adjacent building (the so-called house of Abu Sa&#x27;ud)
* Double Gate (Bab al-Thulathe; possibly one of the Huldah Gates); southern wall, underneath al-Aqsa Mosque
* Triple Gate; southern wall, outside Solomon&#x27;s Stables/Marwani Mosque
* Single Gate; southern wall, outside Solomon&#x27;s Stables/Marwani Mosque

:Open gates of the Haram

There are now eleven open gates offering access to the Muslim Haram al-Sharif.
* Bab al-Asbat (Gate of the Tribes); north-east corner
* Bab al-Hitta/Huttah (Gate of Remission, Pardon, or Absolution); northern wall
* Bab al-Atim/&#x27;Atm/Attim (Gate of Darkness); northern wall
* Bab al-Ghawanima (Gate of Bani Ghanim); north-west corner
* Bab al-Majlis / an-Nazir/Nadhir (Council Gate / Inspector&#x27;s Gate); western wall (northern third)
* Bab al-Hadid (Iron Gate); western wall (central part)
* Bab al-Qattanin (Gate of the Cotton Merchants); western wall (central part)
* Bab al-Matarah/Mathara (Ablution Gate); western wall (central part)
Two twin gates follow south of the Ablution Gate, the Tranquility Gate and the Gate of the Chain:
* Bab as-Salam / al-Sakina (Tranquility Gate / Gate of the Dwelling), the northern one of the two; western wall (central part)
* Bab as-Silsileh (Gate of the Chain), the southern one of the two; western wall (central part)
* Bab al-Magharbeh/Maghariba (Moroccans&#x27; Gate/Gate of the Moors); western wall (southern third); the only entrance for non-Muslims
A twelfth gate still open during Ottoman rule is now closed to the public:
* Bab as-Sarai (Gate of the Seraglio); a small gate to the former residence of the Pasha of Jerusalem; western wall, northern part (between the Bani Ghanim and Council gates).

=== Solomon&#x27;s Stables/Marwani Mosque ===
East of and joined to the triple gate passageway is a large vaulted area, supporting the southeastern corner of the Temple Mount platform – which is substantially above the bedrock at this point – the vaulted chambers here are popularly referred to as Solomon&#x27;s Stables. They were used as stables by the Crusaders, but were built by Herod the Great – along with the platform they were built to support.

=== Northern and western porticos ===
The complex is bordered on the south and east by the outer walls of the Old City of Jerusalem. On the north and west it is bordered by two long porticos (&quot;riwaq&quot;), built during the Mamluk period. A number of other structures were also built along these areas, mainly also from the Mamluk period. On the north side, they include the Isardiyya Madrasa, built before 1345, and the Almalikiyya Madrasa, dated to 1340. On the west side, they include the Ashrafiyya Madrasa, built by Sultan Qaytbay between 1480 and 1482, and the adjacent Uthmaniyya Madrasa, dated to 1437. The Sabil of Qaytbay, contemporary with the Ashrafiyya Madrasa, also stands nearby.

=== Minarets ===

The existing four minarets include three along the western perimeter of the esplanade and one along the northern wall. The earliest dated minaret was constructed on the northwest corner of the Temple Mount in 1298, with three other minarets added over the course of the 14th century.

==Archaeology, site alterations==
Due to the extreme political sensitivity of the site, no real archaeological excavations have ever been conducted on the Temple Mount itself. Protests commonly occur whenever archaeologists conduct projects near the Mount. This sensitivity has not, however, protected both Jewish and Muslim works from accusations of destroying archeological evidence on a number of occasions. Aside from visual observation of surface features, most other archaeological knowledge of the site comes from the 19th-century survey carried out by Charles Wilson and Charles Warren and others. Since the Waqf is granted almost full autonomy on the Islamic holy sites, Israeli archaeologists have been prevented from inspecting the area, and are restricted to conducting excavations around the Temple Mount.

After the Six-Day War of 1967, Israeli archeologists began a series of excavations near the site at the southern wall that uncovered finds from the Second Temple period through Roman, Umayyad and Crusader times. Israeli archaeological digs at the southwestern corner of Temple Mount discovered traces of four Muslim palaces built under the Umayyad Caliphate, though the remains have not been well preserved but instead had a museum built upon them. The former UN envoy to Jerusalem, Raymond M. Lemaire, criticised &quot;the construction of a metallic pergola in the middle of the courtyard of one of the Umayyad palaces, which disfigures the site.&quot; Upon visiting Jerusalem in September 1999, medieval art historian Léon Pressouyre noted that the palaces had lost their archaeological features due to neglect, &quot;for in the guise of highlighting the remains of previous periods [the Israeli authorities] trivialise the Umayyad palaces, major monuments in the area&quot;.

Over the period 1970–1988, a number of tunnels were excavated in the vicinity, including one that passed to the west of the Mount and became known as the Western Wall Tunnel, which was opened to the public in 1996. The same year the Waqf began construction of a new mosque in the structures known since Crusader times as Solomon&#x27;s Stables. Many Israelis regarded this as a radical change of the status quo, which should not have been undertaken without first consulting the Israeli government. The project was done without attention to the possibility of disturbing historically significant archaeological material, with stone and ancient artifacts treated without regard to their preservation.

Israeli organizations such as the Committee to Prevent the Destruction of Antiquities on the Temple Mount argue that Palestinians are deliberately removing significant amounts of archaeological evidence about the Jewish past of the site and claim to have found significant artifacts in the fill removed by bulldozers and trucks from the Temple Mount. Since the late 1990s, the Temple Mount Sifting Project has been reclaiming earth from similar illegal excavations on the mount that had been dumped in the nearby Kidron Valley that had yielded important finds, including Iron Age figurines, an 8th or 7th centuries BCE clay sealing inscribed in Hebrew, Persian period YHD coins, Herodian opus sectile tiles, Byzantine tesserae, and arrowheads, mostly from the Crusader period.

In late 2002, a bulge of about was reported in the southern retaining wall part of the Temple Mount. A Jordanian team of engineers recommended replacing or resetting most of the stones in the affected area. In February 2004, the eastern wall of the Mount was damaged by an earthquake. The damage threatened to topple sections of the wall into the area known as Solomon&#x27;s Stables. A few days later, a portion of retaining wall, supporting the earthen ramp that led from the Western Wall plaza to the Gate of the Moors on the Temple Mount, collapsed. In 2007 the Israel Antiquities Authority started construction of a temporary wooden pedestrian pathway to replace the Mugrabi Gate ramp after a landslide in 2005 made it unsafe and in danger of collapse. The works sparked condemnation from Arab leaders.

In July 2007 the Muslim religious trust which administers the Mount began digging a , trench from the northern side of the Temple Mount compound to the Dome of the Rock in order to replace 40-year-old electric cables in the area. Israeli archaeologists accused the waqf of a deliberate act of cultural vandalism. Accusations of vandalism at the site resurfaced in 2018 and again in 2022.

== Noteworthy events ==
;February 2004: &quot;Partially collapsed Mughrabi-Bridge:&quot; An 800-year-old wall holding back part of the hill jutting out from the Western Wall leading up to the Mughrabi Gate partially collapsed. Authorities believed a recent earthquake may have been responsible.

;March 2005: &quot;Allah inscription:&quot; The word &quot;Allah&quot;, in approximately a Arabic script, was found newly carved into the ancient stones, an act viewed by Jews as vandalism. The carving was attributed to a team of Jordanian engineers and Palestinian laborers in charge of strengthening that section of the wall. The discovery caused outrage among Israeli archaeologists and many Jews were angered by the inscription at Judaism&#x27;s holiest site.

;October 2006:&quot;Synagogue proposal:&quot; Uri Ariel, a member of the Knesset from the National Union party (a right-wing opposition party) ascended to the mount, and said that he is preparing a plan where a synagogue will be built on the mount. His proposed synagogue would not be built instead of the mosques but in a separate area in accordance with rulings of &#x27;prominent rabbis.&#x27; He said he believed that this will be correcting a historical injustice and that it is an opportunity for the Muslim world to prove that it is tolerant to all faiths.

:&quot;Minaret proposal:&quot; Plans are mooted to build a new minaret on the mount, the first of its kind for 600 years. King Abdullah II of Jordan announced a competition to design a fifth minaret for the walls of the Temple Mount complex. He said it would &quot;reflect the Islamic significance and sanctity of the mosque&quot;. The scheme, estimated to cost $300,000, is for a seven-sided tower – after the seven-pointed Hashemite star – and at , it would be taller than the next-largest minaret. The minaret would be constructed on the eastern wall of the Temple Mount near the Golden Gate.

;February 2007: &quot;Mugrabi Gate ramp reconstruction:&quot; Repairs to an earthen ramp leading to the Mugrabi Gate sparked Arab protests.

;May 2007: &quot;Right-wing Jews ascend the Mount:&quot; A group of right-wing Religious Zionist rabbis entered the Temple Mount. This elicited widespread criticism from other religious Jews and from secular Israelis, accusing the rabbis of provoking the Arabs. An editorial in the newspaper &quot;Haaretz&quot; accused the rabbis of &#x27;knowingly and irresponsibly bringing a burning torch closer to the most flammable hill in the Middle East,&#x27; and noted that rabbinical consensus in both the Haredi and the Religious Zionist worlds forbids Jews from entering the Temple Mount. On May 16, Rabbi Avraham Shapira, former Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi of Israel and rosh yeshiva of the Mercaz HaRav yeshiva, reiterated his opinion that it is forbidden for Jews to enter the Temple Mount. The Litvish Haredi newspaper &quot;Yated Ne&#x27;eman&quot;, which is controlled by leading Litvish Haredi rabbis including Rabbi Yosef Shalom Eliashiv and Rabbi Nissim Karelitz, accused the rabbis of transgressing a decree punishable by &#x27;death through the hands of heaven.&#x27;

;July 2007: &quot;Temple Mount cable replacement&quot;: The Waqf began digging a ditch from the northern side of the Temple Mount compound to the Dome of the Rock as a prelude to infrastructure work in the area. Although the dig was approved by the police, it generated protests from archaeologists.

;October 2009: &quot;Clashes&quot;: Palestinian protesters gathered at the site after rumours that an extreme Israeli group would harm the site, which the Israeli government denied. Israeli police assembled at the Temple Mount complex to disperse Palestinian protesters who were throwing stones at them. The police used stun grenades on the protesters, of which 15 were later arrested, including the Palestinian President&#x27;s adviser on Jerusalem affairs. Eighteen Palestinians and 3 police officers were injured.

;July 2010: &quot;A public opinion poll&quot; in Israel showed that 49% of Israelis want the Temple to be rebuilt, with 27% saying the government should make active steps towards such reconstruction. The poll was conducted by channel 99, the government-owned Knesset channel, in advance of the ninth day of the Hebrew month of Av, on which Jews commemorate the destruction of both the first and second Temples, which stood at this site.

:Knesset Member Danny Danon visited the Temple Mount in accordance with rabbinical views of Jewish Law on the ninth of the Hebrew Month of Av. The Knesset member condemned the conditions imposed by Muslims upon religious Jews at the site and vowed to work to improve conditions.

;July 2017
:&quot;Temple Mount shooting&quot;: Three men from the Israeli-Arab city of Umm al-Fahm opened fire on two Israeli Druze policemen at the Lions&#x27; Gate. Gun attacks have been unusual at the Temple Mount in recent decades.

:Following the July 14 attack, the site was shut down, and reopened on July 16 with metal detector-equipped checkpoints, spurring calls for protests by Muslim leaders associated with the site.

;April 2022
:&quot;Al-Aqsa Mosque clashes&quot;: On 15 April 2022, clashes erupted between Palestinians and Israeli Security Forces on the Temple Mount. The clashes began when Palestinians threw stones, firecrackers, and other heavy objects at Israeli police officers. The policemen responded with various riot control measures. Some Palestinians then barricaded themselves inside al-Aqsa Mosque and continued throwing stones at the policemen. In response, police raided the mosque, arresting those who had barricaded themselves inside. Some damage was done to the mosque&#x27;s structure.

<doc id="65723" wikidata="Q377435" url="?curid=65723" title="Vibrato">
<text>Vibrato (Italian, from past participle of &quot;&quot;, to vibrate) is a musical effect consisting of a regular, pulsating change of pitch. It is used to add expression to vocal and instrumental music. Vibrato is typically characterized in terms of two factors: the amount of pitch variation (&quot;extent of vibrato&quot;) and the speed with which the pitch is varied (&quot;rate of vibrato&quot;).

In singing, it can occur spontaneously through variations in the larynx. The vibrato of a string instrument and wind instrument is an imitation of that vocal function. Vibrato can also be reproduced mechanically (Leslie speaker) or electronically as an audio effect close to chorus.

== Terminology ==

=== History ===
Descriptions of what would now be characterised as vibrato go back to the 16th century. However, no evidence exists of authors using the term vibrato before the 19th century. Instead, authors used various descriptive terms interchangeably, including &quot;tremolo&quot;, &quot;bebung&quot;, or &quot;tremblement&quot;, or descriptions such as &quot;wavering&quot;, &quot;shake&quot; or &quot;trillo&quot;. These “terminological uncertainties” continue to pervade modern definitions of vibrato.

=== Vibrato and tremolo ===
The terms vibrato and tremolo are sometimes used interchangeably, although (in the classical world) they are properly defined as separate effects. Vibrato is defined as a periodic variation in the pitch (frequency) of a musical note that is perceived as one fundamental frequency. Tremolo, on the other hand, is defined as a fast repetition of the same note (usually a semiquaver) or alternation between two notes, especially on instruments which do not have the ability of producing long sustained notes, such as the guitar (for instance tremolo picking). 

== Human perception ==
Currently, the leading understanding is that when vibrato is utilised, listeners are able to focus on the average pitch and hear it as a single fundamental as opposed to the alternation between two different fundamental frequencies. Carl Seashore (1967) conducted the first comprehensive studies on perceptions of vibrato in the context of classically trained singers, finding some individuals are 50-100 times more perceptive of the presence of vibrato than individuals with the least ability and that “much of the most beautiful vibrato is below the threshold for vibrato hearing and is perceived merely as tone quality.” This conclusion was confirmed by William Vennard (1967) who notes that the listener hears only the average pitch, and the fluctuation is interpreted as enhanced tonal quality. 

In practice, it is difficult for a singer or musical instrument player to achieve only pitch vibrato (where only the pitch or only the volume is varied), and variations in both pitch and volume will often be achieved at the same time. Electronic manipulation or generation of signals makes it easier to achieve or demonstrate pure tremolo or vibrato. In the world of electric guitar and record production vibrato retains the same meaning as in the classical world (a periodic variation in pitch) but tremolo describes a periodic variation in volume usually achieved using outboard effects units.

==Acoustic basis==
The use of vibrato is intended to add warmth to a note. In the case of many string instruments the sound emitted is strongly directional, particularly at high frequencies, and the slight variations in pitch typical of vibrato playing can cause large changes in the directional patterns of the radiated sound. This can add a shimmer to the sound; with a well-made instrument it may also help a solo player to be heard more clearly when playing with a large orchestra.

This directional effect is intended to interact with the room acoustics to add interest to the sound, in much the same way as an acoustic guitarist may swing the box around on a final sustain, or the rotating baffle of a Leslie speaker will spin the sound around the room.

==Typical extent of vibrato==
The extent of the variation in pitch during vibrato is controlled by the performer. The extent of vibrato for solo singers is usually less than a semitone (100 cents) either side of the note, while singers in a choir typically use narrower vibrato with an extent of less than a tenth of a semitone (10 cents) either side. Wind and bowed instruments generally use vibratos with an extent of less than half a semitone either side.

==Use in various musical genres==
Vibrato is sometimes thought of as an effect added onto the note itself, but in some cases it is so fully a part of the style of the music that it can be very difficult for some performers to play without it. The jazz tenor sax player Coleman Hawkins found he had this difficulty when requested to play a passage both with and without vibrato by Leonard Bernstein when producing his record album &quot;What is Jazz&quot; to demonstrate the difference between the two. Despite his technique, he was unable to play without vibrato. The featured saxophonist in Benny Goodman&#x27;s Orchestra, George Auld, was brought in to play the part.

Many classical musicians, especially singers and string players, have a similar problem. The violinist and teacher Leopold Auer, writing in his book &quot;Violin Playing as I Teach It&quot; (1920), advised violinists to practise playing completely without vibrato, and to stop playing for a few minutes as soon as they noticed themselves playing with vibrato in order for them to gain complete control over their technique.

===In classical music===
The use of vibrato in classical music is a matter of some dispute. For much of the 20th century it was used almost continuously in the performance of pieces from all eras from the Baroque onwards, especially by singers and string players.

The rise of notionally historically informed (&quot;period&quot;) performance from the 1970s onwards has dramatically changed its use, especially in music of the Baroque and Classical eras. However, there is no actual proof that singers performed without vibrato in the baroque era. Notably, composer Lodovico Zacconi advocated that vibrato &quot;ought always to be used&quot;.

Vocal music of the renaissance is almost never sung with vibrato as a rule, and it seems unlikely it ever was; however, it should be understood that &quot;vibrato&quot; occurs over a wide range of intensities: slow, fast, wide, and narrow. Most sources in condemning the practice seem to be referring to a wide, slow, perceptible oscillation in pitch, usually associated with intense emotion, whereas the ideal for modern vibrato, and possibly in earlier times as well, was to imitate the natural timbre of the adult singing voice, from which a measure of vibrato (it has since been shown) is rarely absent.

Leopold Mozart’s &quot;Versuch einer gründlichen Violinschule&quot; (1756), for example, provides an indication of the state of vibrato in string playing at the end of the baroque period. In it, he concedes that “there are performers who tremble consistently on each note as if they had the permanent fever”, condemning the practice, and suggesting instead that vibrato should be used only on sustained notes and at the ends of phrases when used as an ornament. This however, does not give anything more than an indication of Mozart&#x27;s own personal taste, based on the fact that he was an educated late Rococo/Classical composer. Mozart acknowledges the difference between the heavy, ornamental vibrato that he finds objectionable, and a more continuous application of the technique less obtrusively for purposes of improving tone quality (in which case he does not refer to it as &quot;vibrato&quot; or &quot;tremolo&quot; at all; describing it as merely an aspect of correct fingering). In this respect he resembles his contemporary, Francesco Geminiani, who advocated using vibrato &quot;as frequently as possible&quot; on short notes for this purpose. Although there is no aural proof, as audio recordings were not around for more than 150 years, that string players in Europe did not use vibrato, its overuse was almost universally condemned by the leading musical authorities of the day.

Certain types of vibrato, then, were seen as an ornament, but this does not mean that it was used sparingly. In wind playing too, it seems that vibrato in music up to the 20th century was seen as an ornament to be used selectively. Martin Agricola writing in his &quot;Musica instrumentalis deudsch&quot; (1529) writes of vibrato in this way. Occasionally, composers up to the baroque period indicated vibrato with a wavy line in the sheet music. Again, this does not suggest that it was not desired for the rest of the piece any more than the infrequent use of the term in 20th-century works suggests that it is not used elsewhere.

====Vibrato wars====
Music by late-Romantic composers such as Richard Wagner and Johannes Brahms is now played with a fairly continuous vibrato. However, some musicians specialising in historically informed performances, such as the conductor Roger Norrington, argue that it is unlikely that Brahms, Wagner, and their contemporaries would have expected it to be played in this way. This view has caused considerable controversy. The view that &quot;continuous vibrato&quot; was invented by Fritz Kreisler and some of his colleagues is held to be shown by early sound recordings, which allegedly demonstrate that this profuse use of vibrato appeared only in the 20th century.

The alleged growth of vibrato in 20th-century orchestral playing has been traced by Norrington by studying early audio recordings but his opponents contend that his interpretations are not supported by the actual samples. Norrington claims that vibrato in the earliest recordings is used only selectively, as an expressive device; the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra were not recorded using vibrato comparable to modern vibrato until 1935, and the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra not until 1940. French orchestras seem to have played with continuous vibrato somewhat earlier, from the 1920s.

Defenders of vibrato claim that the sonic limitations of 78-rpm recordings, particularly with respect to overtones and high frequency information, make an uncontroversial assessment of earlier playing techniques difficult (although, it must be said, early recordings of operatic singers manage to show clearly the extent to which a vibrato is present [or not] in their voices). In addition, the defenders of vibrato point out a distinction needs to be made between the kind of vibrato used by a solo player, and the sectional vibrato of an entire string ensemble, which cannot be heard as a uniform quantity as such. Rather, it manifests itself in terms of the warmth and amplitude of the sound produced, as opposed to a perceptible wavering of pitch. The fact that as early as the 1880s composers such as Richard Strauss (in his tone poems &quot;Don Juan&quot; and &quot;Death and Transfiguration&quot;) as well as Camille Saint-Saëns (Symphony No. 3 &quot;Organ&quot;) asked string players to perform certain passages &quot;without expression&quot; or &quot;without nuance&quot; somewhat suggests the general use of vibrato within the orchestra as a matter of course; by the same token, indications by Mahler and Debussy that specifically demand the use of vibrato in certain passages may suggest the opposite practice.

====In Baroque music====

On the clavichord, tremolo (bebung) refers to a vibrato effect created by varying the depression of the keys.

Theorists and authors of treatises on instrumental technique of the era regularly used tremolo or bebung to refer to vibrato on other instruments and in the voice; however, there was not uniform agreement in what the term meant.

Some influential authors such as Matteson and Hiller believed the natural trembling in the voice occurred &quot;without making it higher or lower&quot;. This could be achieved on string instruments by varying the speed of the bow, waving the hand, or rolling the bow in the fingers. On the organ, a similar effect is created by the tremulant. (Contradictory to his description, Hiller recommended string players vary the pitch by rolling the fingers to create the effect).

Other authors seem to differentiate by degrees. Leopold Mozart includes tremolo in chapter 11 of his violin treatise, but describes an unnamed vibrato technique in chapter 5 on tone production. His son, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, appears to take the exact opposite definition as his father: in a letter to his father, Mozart criticizes singers for &quot;pulsing&quot; their voice beyond the natural fluctuation of the voice, the latter of which being pleasant should be imitated on the violin, winds, and clavichord (with bebung).

To other authors such as Tartini, Zacconi, and Bremner (student of Geminiani), there is no distinction between the two.

Flute treatises of the era describe a variety of techniques for flattement as well as vibrato by shaking the flute with pitch fluctuations varying from nearly nothing to very large.

====In opera====
All human voices can produce vibrato. This vibrato can be varied in width (and rapidity) through training.
In opera, as opposed to pop, vibrato begins at the start of the note and continues to the end of the note with slight variations in width during the note.

Traditionally, however, the deliberate cultivation of a particularly wide, pervasive vibrato by opera singers from the Latin countries has been denounced by English-speaking music critics and pedagogues as a technical fault and a stylistic blot (see Scott, cited below, Volume 1, pp. 123–127). They have expected vocalists to emit a pure, steady stream of clear sound — irrespective of whether they were singing in church, on the concert platform, or on the operatic stage.

During the 19th century, for instance, New York and London based critics, including Henry Chorley, Herman Klein, and George Bernard Shaw, castigated a succession of visiting Mediterranean tenors for resorting to an excessive, constantly pulsating vibrato during their performances. Shaw called the worst offenders &quot;goat bleaters&quot; in his book &quot;Music in London 1890-1894&quot; (Constable, London, 1932). Among those censured for this failing were such celebrated figures as Enrico Tamberlik, Julián Gayarre, Roberto Stagno, Italo Campanini and Ernesto Nicolini—not to mention Fernando Valero and Fernando De Lucia, whose tremulous tones are preserved on the 78-rpm discs that they made at the beginning of the 20th century.

The popularity of an exaggerated vibrato among many (but by no means all) Mediterranean tenors and singing teachers of this era has been traced back by musicologists to the influential example set by the early-19th-century virtuoso vocalist Giovanni Battista Rubini (1794–1854). Rubini had employed it with great success as an affecting device in the new Romantic operas of Gaetano Donizetti and Vincenzo Bellini. A host of young Italian tenors—including the renowned Giovanni Matteo Mario (1810–1883) — copied Rubini&#x27;s trend-setting innovation in order to heighten the emotional impact of the music that they were singing, and to facilitate the delivery of fioritura &quot;by, as it were, running up and down the vibrato&quot; (to quote Scott; see p. 126).

Prior to the advent of the charismatic Rubini, every well-schooled opera singer had avoided using a conspicuous and continuous vibrato because, according to Scott, it varied the pitch of the note being sung to an unacceptable degree and it was considered to be an artificial contrivance arising from inadequate breath control. British and North American press commentators and singing teachers continued to subscribe to this view long after Rubini had come and gone.

Accordingly, when Enrico Caruso (1873–1921) — the most emulated Mediterranean tenor of the 20th century — made his acclaimed New York Metropolitan Opera debut in November 1903, one of the specific vocal attributes for which he was praised by music reviewers was the absence of a disruptive vibrato from his singing. The scholarly critic William James Henderson wrote in &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper, for example, that Caruso &quot;has a pure tenor voice and [it] is without the typical Italian bleat&quot;. Caruso&#x27;s gramophone recordings support Henderson&#x27;s assessment. (Other prominent Mediterranean tenors of the late 19th century to early 20th century who, like Caruso, did not &quot;bleat&quot; were Angelo Masini, Francesco Tamagno, Francesco Marconi, Francisco Viñas, Emilio De Marchi, Giuseppe Borgatti and Giovanni Zenatello, while the phenomenon was rare among French, German, Russian and Anglo-Saxon tenors of the same period—see Scott.)

The intentional use of a pronounced vibrato by Mediterranean tenors is a practice that has died out over the course of the past 100 years, owing in no small measure to Caruso&#x27;s example. The last really important practitioners of this style and method of singing were Alessandro Bonci (in the 1900-1925 period) and Giacomo Lauri-Volpi (in the 1920-1950 period). Both of them featured bel canto works, dating from Rubini&#x27;s day, in their operatic repertoires, and both of them can be heard on recordings which faithfully capture the distinct shimmer inherent in their timbre.

Italian or Spanish-trained operatic sopranos, mezzo-sopranos, and baritones exhibiting a pronounced vibrato did not escape censure, either, by British and North American arbiters of good singing. Indeed, Adelina Patti and Luisa Tetrazzini were the only Italian sopranos to enjoy star status in London and New York in the late-Victorian and Edwardian eras, while such well-known compatriots and coevals of theirs as Gemma Bellincioni and Eugenia Burzio (among several others) failed to please the Anglophones&#x27; ears because, unlike Patti and Tetrazzini, they possessed unsteady, vibrato-laden voices—see Scott for evaluations of their respective techniques. To give an additional female example from a later date, whenever the vivacious mezzo-soprano of the 1920s and &#x27;30s, Conchita Supervía, performed in London, she was admonished in print for her exceedingly vibrant and fluttery tone, which was unkindly likened by her detractors to the chatter of a machine-gun or the rattle of dice in a cup.

In 1883, Giuseppe Kaschmann (né Josip Kašman) — a principal baritone at La Scala, Milan—was criticised for his strong vibrato when he sang at the Met, and the theatre&#x27;s management did not re-engage him for the following season, even though other aspects of his singing were admired. (Kaschmann never performed in Great Britain but he remained a popular artist in the Latin countries for several decades; in 1903, he made a few recordings which exhibit only too well his perpetual flutter.) Similarly, another one of Italy&#x27;s leading baritones, Riccardo Stracciari, was unable to turn his pre-World War I London and New York operatic engagements into unambiguous triumphs due to an intrusive quiver in his tone. He subsequently moderated his vibrato, as the discs that he made for Columbia Records in 1917-1925 show, and this enabled him to pursue a significant career not only in his homeland but also at the Chicago opera.

There is another kind of vibrato-linked fault that can afflict the voices of operatic artists, especially aging ones—namely the slow, often irregular wobble produced when the singer&#x27;s vibrato has loosened from the effects of forcing, over-parting, or the sheer wear and tear on the body caused by the stresses of a long stage career.

===In jazz===

Most jazz players for the first half of the 20th century used vibrato more or less continuously. Since around the 1950s and the rise of bebop, continuous use of vibrato has largely fallen out of style in favor of more selective use.

===In folk===
Folk music singers and instrumentalists in the North American and Western European traditions rarely use vibrato, reserving it for occasional ornamentation. It also tends to be used by performers of transcriptions or reworkings of folk music that have been made by composers from a classical, music-school background such as Benjamin Britten or Percy Grainger. Vibrato of varying widths and speeds may be used in folk music traditions from other regions, such as Eastern Europe, the Balkans, the Middle East, East Asia, or India. 

===In pop===
In pop (as opposed to opera), the vibrato usually starts somewhere in the latter part of the note.
In the case of some pop balladists, the vibrato can be so wide as to constitute a pronounced wobble, although not as pronounced as that present in operatic voices. Many singers use pitch correction software in which the effect can be reduced or eliminated.

==Techniques for producing vibrato==
Not all instruments can produce vibrato, as some have fixed pitches that cannot be varied by sufficiently small degrees. Most percussion instruments are examples of this, for instance, the xylophone.

===Singing===
There are three different voice vibrato processes that occur in different parts of the vocal tract. Peter-Michael Fischer has vibrato types defined by place of production:
* The vocalis muscle vibrates at a frequency of 6.5 to 8 Hz.
* The diaphragm vibrates at a frequency below 5 Hz vibrato
* A combination of the two, resulting in a vibrato whose frequency is between 5 and 6.5 Hz vibrato. Fischer writes:
Some studies have shown that vibrato is the result of a neuromuscular tremor in the vocal folds. In 1922, Max Schoen was the first to make the comparison of vibrato to a tremor due to the following similarities:
* Vibrato and tremors have a change in amplitude 
* Both occur when the muscles are under strain 
* Neither are under the automatic control of the person
* Vibrato and tremors occur at half the rate of normal muscular discharge

===Keyboard instruments===
Some types of organ can produce vibrato by altering the pressure of the air passing through the pipes, or by various mechanical devices (see the Hammond or Wurlitzer Organs for example). The clavichord, though technically a fixed-pitch keyboard instrument, is capable of producing a type of vibrato known as &quot;Bebung&quot; by varying the pressure on the key as the note sounds. Some digital keyboards can produce an electronic vibrato effect, either by pressure on the keys, or by using a joystick or other MIDI controller.

===String instruments===

The method of producing vibrato on other instruments varies. On string instruments, for example, the finger used to stop the string can be wobbled on the fingerboard, or actually moved up and down the string for a wider vibrato.

Many contemporary string players vary the pitch from below, only up to the nominal note and not above it, although great violin pedagogues of the past such as Carl Flesch and Joseph Joachim explicitly referred to vibrato as a movement towards the bridge, meaning upwards in pitch,—and the cellist Diran Alexanian, in his 1922 treatise &quot;Traité théorique et pratique du Violoncelle&quot;, shows how one should practice vibrato as starting from the note and then moving upwards in a rhythmic motion. In a 1996 acoustic study by the Acoustical Society of America, along with Wellesley College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, found that the perceived pitch of a note with vibrato &quot;is that of its mean&quot;, or the middle of the fluctuating pitch.
Wide vibrato, as wide as a whole-tone, is commonly used among electric guitar players and adds the signature vocal-like expressiveness to the sound. This effect can be achieved both by the movement of fingers on the fretboard and by the use of a vibrato tailpiece, a lever that adjusts the tension of the strings.

Some violinists, like Leonidas Kavakos, use bow vibrato by moving the right hand up and down slightly to change the angle and pressure of the bow and thus oscillate the pitch and intensity of a note. The first known description of this technique on violin was by Francesco Geminiani. This technique was not limited to violin but was known to players of all string instruments in Italy, France, Germany, and England during the Baroque era. Sylvestro Ganassi dal Fontego is known to have described this technique for the viol da gamba as early as the 16th century.

===Woodwind===
Players of woodwind instruments generally create vibrato by modulating their air flow into the instrument. This may be accomplished either through stomach vibrato, the pulsing of the diaphragm slightly up and down, or throat vibrato, a variation of vocal cord tension to manipulate air pressure as singers do. Players of other instruments may employ less common techniques. Although saxophonists and clarinetists can also use airflow, it is more common for them to create vibrato by repeatedly moving their jaw up and down slightly. However classical clarinetists rarely play with vibrato.

===Brass===
Brass instrument players can produce vibrato by repeatedly and rapidly altering the embouchure, or use and shaping of the lips and facial muscles, essentially repeatedly &quot;bending&quot; the note. This is called lip-vibrato, and is probably the most commonly used technique of vibrato on a lower brass instrument. It is also known to give the best sound and timbre on a brass instrument and is encouraged in upper-level or militaristic style brass ensembles.

Players may also produce vibrato by gently shaking the horn which varies the pressure of the mouthpiece against the lip. This is referred to as hand vibrato. It is more favored in higher brass, but does not possess the same sound quality as lip-vibrato and at upper levels and can be viewed as a technical mistake, most notable in military style brass training.

On a trombone, a player may provide a slightly more pronounced vibrato by gently moving the slide back and forth, centering on one note to give a lyrical effect. Often this is more of a jazz technique, and is called &quot;slide vibrato&quot;. In brass playing, &quot;diaphragmatic vibrato&quot; is possible, but is viewed as an immature technique by collegiate or professional brass players as this technique interferes with proper airflow from the lungs to the instrument. The use of diaphragmatic vibrato in a brass setting is detrimental to the sound and stamina that a brass player can produce, and so is strongly discouraged at any level of musical training.

===Auto-vibrato===

Some instruments can be played only with constant, mechanical vibrato (or none at all). This effect is notable in electric organists using a Leslie speaker, the most popular of which use a two-speed vibrato; a degree of expression is gained from the acceleration between speeds. Vibrato on the theremin, which is a continuously variable-pitch instrument with no &quot;stops&quot;, can range from delicate to extravagant, and often serves to mask the small pitch adjustments that instrument requires.

Some manufacturers also build vibrato effect pedals that imitate the natural vibrato but can also produce much faster speeds. The vibrato effect is close to a chorus effect.

=== Leslie speaker ===

A Leslie speaker (best known through its historical and popular association with the Hammond organ) creates vibrato as a byproduct of tremolo production. As a Leslie speaker is moved by the rotating mechanism on which it is mounted, it moves closer to or farther away from any given object (such as a listener&#x27;s ears) not also mounted on the mechanism. Because amplitude varies directly with sound pressure (&quot;A = k1P&quot;) and sound pressure varies directly with distance (&quot;P = k2d&quot;), such that amplitude also varies directly with distance (&quot;A = k1(k2d) = k1k2d&quot;), the amplitude of the sound as perceived by the listener will be greatest when the speaker is at the point in its rotation closest to the listener and least when the speaker is farthest away. Because the speaker is constantly moving either toward or away from the listener, however, the mechanism&#x27;s rotation is constantly affecting the listener-perceived sound&#x27;s wavelength by either &quot;stretching&quot; the wave (increasing wavelength) or &quot;squeezing&quot; it (decreasing wavelength) — and because frequency, i.e., pitch, is inversely proportional to wavelength, such that increasing wavelength decreases frequency and vice versa, any listener for whom the speaker&#x27;s motion changes the sound&#x27;s perceived amplitude (&quot;i.e.&quot;, any listener whose distance from the speaker is changing) must also perceive a change in frequency.

<text>The Dome of the Rock () is an Islamic shrine at the center of the Al-Aqsa mosque compound on the Temple Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem. It is the world&#x27;s oldest surviving work of Islamic architecture, the earliest archaeologically attested religious structure to be built by a Muslim ruler and its inscriptions contain the earliest epigraphic proclamations of Islam and of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.

Its initial construction was undertaken by the Umayyad Caliphate on the orders of Abd al-Malik during the Second Fitna in 691–692 CE, and it has since been situated on top of the site of the Second Jewish Temple (built in to replace the destroyed Solomon&#x27;s Temple and rebuilt by Herod the Great), which was destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE. The original dome collapsed in 1015 and was rebuilt in 1022–23.

Its architecture and mosaics were patterned after nearby Byzantine churches and palaces. Its outside appearance was significantly changed during the Early Ottoman period, when brightly coloured, mainly blue-and-white Iznik-style tiles were applied to the exterior, and again in the modern period, notably with the addition of the gold-plated roof, in 1959–61 and again in 1993. The octagonal plan of the structure may have been influenced by the Byzantine-era Church of the Seat of Mary (also known as &quot;Kathisma&quot; in Greek and &quot;al-Qadismu&quot; in Arabic), which was built between 451 and 458 on the road between Jerusalem and Bethlehem.

The Foundation Stone (or Noble Rock) that the temple was built over bears great significance in the Abrahamic religions as the place where God created the world as well as the first human, Adam. It is also believed to be the site where Abraham attempted to sacrifice his son, and as the place where God&#x27;s divine presence is manifested more than in any other place, towards which Jews turn during prayer. The site&#x27;s great significance for Muslims derives from traditions connecting it to the creation of the world and the belief that the Night Journey of Muhammad began from the rock at the centre of the structure.

Designated by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, it has been called &quot;Jerusalem&#x27;s most recognizable landmark&quot; along with two nearby Old City structures: the Western Wall and the &quot;Resurrection Rotunda&quot; in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Its Islamic inscriptions proved to be a milestone, as afterward they became a common feature in Islamic structures and almost always mention Muhammad. The Dome of the Rock remains a &quot;unique monument of Islamic culture in almost all respects&quot;, including as a &quot;work of art and as a cultural and pious document&quot;, according to art historian Oleg Grabar.

==Architecture==
===Basic structure===
The Dome of the Rock&#x27;s basic plan is essentially octagonal. It is capped at its centre by a dome, approximately in diameter, mounted on an elevated circular drum standing on 16 supports (4 tiers and 12 columns). Surrounding this circle is an octagonal arcade of 24 piers and columns. The inner circular row of drum supports and the octagonal arcade create an inner ambulatorium that encircles the holy rock.

The outer walls are also octagonal. They each measure approximately wide and high. The inner and outer octagon create a second, outer ambulatorium surrounding the inner one.

Both the circular drum and the exterior walls contain many windows.

===Interior decoration===
The interior of the dome is lavishly decorated with mosaic, faience and marble, much of which was added several centuries after its completion. It also contains Qur&#x27;anic inscriptions. They vary from today&#x27;s standard text (mainly changes from the first to the third person) and are mixed with pious inscriptions not in the Quran.

The dedicatory inscription in Kufic script placed around the dome contains the date believed to be the year the Dome was first completed, AH 72 (691/2 CE), while the name of the corresponding caliph and builder of the Dome, al-Malik, was deleted and replaced by the name of Abbasid caliph Al-Ma&#x27;mun () during whose reign renovations took place.

===Exterior decoration===
The decoration of the outer walls went through two major phases: the initial Umayyad scheme comprised marble and mosaics, much like the interior walls. 16th-century Ottoman sultan Suleyman the Magnificent replaced it with Ottoman tile decoration. This tilework was of many different styles and techniques, including &quot;cuerda seca&quot; tiles, multi-coloured underglaze tiles, and blue-and-white tilework, resembling the Iznik tiles that were produced for the Ottoman capital. A small number of tiles were actual Iznik productions that were imported to Jerusalem. The original tiles were replaced in the 1960s with faithful copies produced in Italy.

 (the &#x27;Heart of the Quran&#x27;) is inscribed across the top of the tile work and was commissioned in the 16th century by Suleiman the Magnificent. 17, , which tells the story of the or Night Journey, is inscribed above this.

==History==
===Pre-Islamic background===

The Dome of the Rock is situated in the center of the Temple Mount, the site of Solomon&#x27;s Temple and the Second Jewish Temple, which had been greatly expanded under Herod the Great in the 1st century BCE. Herod&#x27;s Temple was destroyed in 70 CE by the Romans, and after the Bar Kokhba revolt in 135 CE, a Roman temple to was built at the site by Emperor Hadrian.

Jerusalem was ruled by the Byzantine Empire throughout the 4th to 6th centuries. During this time, Christian pilgrimage to Jerusalem began to develop. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre was built under Constantine in the 320s, but the Temple Mount was left undeveloped after a failed project of restoration of the Jewish Temple under Emperor Julian.

In 638 CE, Byzantine Jerusalem was conquered by the Arab armies of Umar ibn al-Khattab, second Caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate. Umar was advised by Ka&#x27;b al-Ahbar, a Jewish rabbi who converted to Islam, that the site is identical with the site of the former Jewish Temples in Jerusalem. Among the first Muslims, Jerusalem was referred to as (&#x27;City of the Temple&#x27;).

===Umayyads===
====Original construction====
The initial octagonal structure of the Dome of the Rock and its round wooden dome had basically the same shape as it does today. It was built by the order of the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik (). According to Sibt ibn al-Jawzi (1185–1256), construction started in 685/6, while al-Suyuti (1445–1505) holds that its commencement year was 688. A dedicatory inscription in Kufic script is preserved inside the dome. The date is recorded as AH 72 (691/2 CE), the year most historians believe the construction of the original Dome was completed. An alternative interpretation of the inscription claims that it indicates the year when construction started. In this inscription, the name of &quot;al-Malik&quot; was removed and replaced by the name of the Abbasid caliph al-Ma&#x27;mun (). This alteration of the original inscription was first noted by Melchior de Vogüé in 1864. Some scholars have suggested that the dome was added to an existing building, built either by Muawiyah I (), or indeed a Byzantine building dating to before the Muslim conquest, built under Heraclius ().

The Dome of the Rock&#x27;s architecture and mosaics were patterned after nearby Byzantine churches and palaces. The supervisor and engineer in charge of the project were Raja ibn Haywa, Yazid ibn Salam, and the latter&#x27;s son Baha. Raja was a Muslim theologian and native of Beisan, and Yazid and Baha were (non-Arab, Muslim converts; clients) of Abd al-Malik from Jerusalem. Abd al-Malik was represented in the supervision of the construction by his son Sa&#x27;id al-Khayr. The Caliph employed expert works from across his domain, at the time restricted to Syria and Egypt, who were presumably Christians. Construction cost was reportedly seven times the yearly tax income of Egypt. The historian K. A. C. Creswell noted that those who built the shrine used the measurements of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. The diameter of the dome of the shrine is and its height , while the diameter of the dome of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre is and its height .

====Motivations for construction====
Narratives by the medieval sources about Abd al-Malik&#x27;s motivations in building the Dome of the Rock vary. At the time of its construction, the Caliph was engaged in war with Christian Byzantium and its Syrian Christian allies on the one hand and with the rival caliph Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr, who controlled Mecca, the annual destination of Muslim pilgrimage, on the other hand. Thus, one series of explanations was that Abd al-Malik intended for the Dome of the Rock to be a religious monument of victory over the Christians that would distinguish Islam&#x27;s uniqueness within the common Abrahamic religious setting of Jerusalem, home of the two older Abrahamic faiths, Judaism and Christianity. The historian Shelomo Dov Goitein has argued that the Dome of the Rock was intended to compete with the many fine buildings of worship of other religions: &quot;The very form of a rotunda, given to the , although it was foreign to Islam, was destined to rival the many Christian domes&quot; - and more specifically, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, according to others.

The other main explanation holds that Abd al-Malik, in the heat of the war with Ibn al-Zubayr, sought to build the structure to divert the focus of the Muslims in his realm from the Ka&#x27;aba in Mecca, where Ibn al-Zubayr would publicly condemn the Umayyads during the annual pilgrimage to the sanctuary. Though most modern historians dismiss the latter account as a product of anti-Umayyad propaganda in the traditional Muslim sources and doubt that Abd al-Malik would attempt to alter the sacred Muslim requirement of fulfilling the pilgrimage to the Ka&#x27;aba, other historians concede that this cannot be conclusively dismissed.

===Abbasids and Fatimids===
The building was severely damaged by earthquakes in 808 and again in 846. The dome collapsed in an earthquake in 1015 and was rebuilt in 1022–1023. The mosaics on the drum were repaired in 1027–1028. The earthquake of 1033 resulted in the introduction of wooden beams to enforce the dome.

===Crusaders===

For centuries Christian pilgrims were able to come and experience the Temple Mount, but escalating violence against pilgrims to Jerusalem (Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, who ordered the destruction of the Holy Sepulchre, was an example) resulted in the Crusades. The Crusaders captured Jerusalem in 1099 and the Dome of the Rock was given to the Augustinians, who turned it into a church, while the nearby Al-Aqsa main prayer hall or Qibli Mosque first became a royal palace for a while, and then for much of the 12th century the headquarters of the Knights Templar. The Templars, active from , identified the Dome of the Rock as the site of the Temple of Solomon. The , as they called the Dome of the Rock, featured on the official seals of the Order&#x27;s Grand Masters (such as Everard des Barres and Renaud de Vichiers), and soon became the architectural model for round Templar churches across Europe.

===Ayyubids and Mamluks===

Jerusalem was recaptured by Saladin on 2 October 1187, and the Dome of the Rock was reconsecrated as a Muslim shrine. The cross on top of the dome was replaced by a crescent, and a wooden screen was placed around the rock below. Saladin&#x27;s nephew al-Malik al-Mu&#x27;azzam Isa carried out other restorations within the building, and added the porch to the Jami&#x27;a Al-Aqsa.

The Dome of the Rock was the focus of extensive royal patronage by the sultans during the Mamluk period, which lasted from 1260 until 1516.

===Ottoman period (1517–1917)===
During the Ottoman period, the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent () brought Ottoman dynastic patronage to the city, around the same time that the sultan and his wife, Haseki Hürrem Sultan (Roxelana), were also commissioning works in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Suleiman initiated a major renovation of the Dome of the Rock. The most visible legacy of this work was the covering of the exterior with Ottoman-style tiles, which replaced the old Umayyad mosaics. This was likely part of an effort to impose a visibly Ottoman mark on this major Islamic holy site. Inscriptions on the tiles provide the dates 952 AH (1545–6 CE) and 959 AH (1552 CE), but work continued until the end of Suleiman&#x27;s reign, if not later. Documents show repairs were still incomplete by the time of Murad III () and the latter can probably be credited with finishing this work, which included repairs to the lead of the dome. 

The tiles seem to have been fabricated locally rather than at centers like Iznik (famous for its production of Iznik pottery at this time), although there does not appear to have been a sophisticated ceramic production center in the region. Robert Hillenbrand remarks that the workshops that produced the tiles must have been dedicated to this project alone, because there is no evidence that similar tilework was produced for other monuments in Jerusalem during this period. The name of one of the craftsmen is recorded in an inscription as Abdallah of Tabriz. This may indicate that the tiles were commissioned from a workshop of Iranian craftsmen from Tabriz who are thought to have produced many earlier Ottoman tiles.

The Dome of the Chain, a free-standing structure next to the Dome of the Rock, was also renovated as part of Suleiman&#x27;s project, in 1561–2. Also nearby, the Ottomans built the Dome of the Prophet in its current form sometime in the 16th or 17th century.

Further restorations to the building are recorded in 1720–1721, 1742,1754, 1780, 1817–1818, and 1853. In another major restoration project undertaken in 1874–1875 during the reign of the Ottoman Sultan Abdülaziz, all the tiles on the west and southwest walls of the octagonal part of the building were removed and replaced by copies that had been made in Turkey.

===British Mandate===
Haj Amin al-Husseini, appointed Grand Mufti by the British in 1917, along with Yaqub al-Ghusayn, implemented the restoration of the Dome of the Rock and the Jami Al-Aqsa in Jerusalem.

Parts of the Dome of the Rock collapsed during the 11 July 1927 earthquake, and the walls were left badly cracked, damaging many of the repairs that had taken place over previous years.

===Jordanian rule===
In 1955, an extensive program of renovation was begun by the government of Jordan, with funds supplied by Arab governments and Turkey. The work included replacement of large numbers of tiles dating back to the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent, which had become dislodged by heavy rain. In 1965, as part of this restoration, the dome was covered with a durable aluminium bronze alloy made in Italy that replaced the lead exterior. Before 1959, the dome was covered in blackened lead. In the course of substantial restoration carried out from 1959 to 1962, the lead was replaced by aluminum-bronze plates covered with gold leaf.

===Israeli rule===
A few hours after the Israeli flag was hoisted over the Dome of the Rock in 1967 during the Six-Day War, Israelis lowered it on the orders of Moshe Dayan and invested the Muslim (religious trust) with the authority to manage the Temple Mount in order to &quot;keep the peace&quot;.

In 1993, the golden dome covering was refurbished following a donation of US$8.25million by King Hussein of Jordan, who sold one of his houses in London to fund the of gold required.

==Accessibility==
The Dome is maintained by the Ministry of Awqaf in Amman, Jordan.

Until the mid-20th century, non-Muslims were not permitted in the area. Since 1967, non-Muslims have been permitted limited access; however non-Muslims are not permitted to pray on the Temple Mount, bring prayer books, or wear religious apparel. The Israeli police help enforce this. Israel restricted access for a short time during 2012 of Palestinian residents of the West Bank to the Temple Mount. West Bank Palestinian men had to be over 35 to be eligible for a permit. Palestinian residents of Jerusalem, who hold Israeli residency cards, and Palestinians with Israeli citizenship are permitted unrestricted access.

Some Orthodox rabbis encourage Jews to visit the site, while most forbid entry to the compound lest there be a violation of Jewish law. Even rabbis who encourage entrance to the Temple Mount prohibit entrance to the actual Dome of the Rock.

==Religious significance==
The location of the Dome of the Rock is believed by many Muslims to be the site mentioned in Sura 17 of the Qur&#x27;an, which tells the story of the Isra and Mi&#x27;raj, the mythical Night Journey of Muhammad from the Great Mosque of Mecca to the Masjid Al-Aqsa (&quot;the farthest place of prayer&quot;) where he prayed, and then to visit heaven where he leads prayers and rises to heaven to receive instructions from Allah. Although the city of Jerusalem is not mentioned by any of its names in the Qur&#x27;an, it is mentioned in hadiths as the place of Muhammad&#x27;s Night Journey.

Judging though by the early Muslim sources, this does not seem to have been yet a fully formulated part of the beliefs shared by Muslims during the construction of the Dome in the 8th century, and the inscriptions inside the dome attributing the building to Caliph &#x27;Abd al-Malik in the year 691/2 do not refer at all to the Night Journey, but contain only the Quranic view on the nature of the prophet Isa (Jesus) instead. The inscription is in a mosaic frieze that includes an explicit rejection of the divinity of Christ:

According to Goitein, the inscriptions decorating the interior clearly display a spirit of polemic against Christianity, whilst stressing at the same time the Qur&#x27;anic doctrine that Jesus was a true prophet. The formula (&#x27;God has no companion&#x27;) is repeated five times; the verses from Sura Maryam 19:35–37, which strongly reaffirm Jesus&#x27; prophethood to God, are quoted together with the prayer: – &quot;O Lord, send your blessings to your Prophet and Servant Jesus son of Mary.&quot; He believes that this shows that rivalry with Christendom, together with the spirit of Muslim mission to the Christians, was at work at the time of construction.

At the beginning of the 8th century, Ibn Ishaq codified the earliest Arabic source pertaining to the Jerusalem Rock, as part of his , a biography of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, introducing the notion that right after his Night Journey from Mecca to Jerusalem (), he set off immediately and specifically from the Rock in his Ascension () to Heaven, where God instructed him in the doctrines of the new religion.

Today, many Muslims believe the Dome serves for the commemoration of Muhammad&#x27;s Ascension, in accordance to the views shared by some Islamic scholars, that the Rock is indeed the spot from which Muhammad ascended to Heaven accompanied by the angel Gabriel. Further, Muhammad was taken here by Gabriel to pray with Abraham, Moses, and Jesus.

Other Islamic scholars believe that Muhammad ascended to Heaven from the Masjid Al-Aqsa, of which the Dome of the Rock is a part.

In traditional Jewish sources, it is believed to be the place from which the creation of the world began. Moreover, many Jews believe the site to be where Abraham prepared to sacrifice his son Isaac. The Foundation Stone and its surroundings which lie at the center of the dome, are considered the holiest site in Judaism. Jews traditionally regard the location of the stone as the holiest spot on Earth, the site of the Holy of Holies of the First and the Second Temple.

Though Muslims now pray towards the Kaaba at Mecca, they once faced the Temple Mount as the Jews do; Islamic tradition holds that Muhammad led prayers towards Jerusalem until the 16th or 17th month after his migration from Mecca to Medina, when Allah directed him to instead turn towards the Kaaba in Mecca.

The Temple Institute wishes to relocate the Dome to another site and replace it with a Third Temple. Many Israelis are ambivalent about the Movement&#x27;s wishes. Some religious Jews, following rabbinic teaching, believe that the Temple should only be rebuilt in the messianic era, and that it would be presumptuous of people to force God&#x27;s hand. However, some Evangelical Christians consider rebuilding of the Temple to be a prerequisite to Armageddon and the Second Coming. Jeremy Gimpel, a US-born candidate for The Jewish Home political party in the 2013 Israeli elections, caused a controversy when he was recorded telling a Fellowship Church evangelical group in Florida in 2011 to imagine the incredible experience that would follow were the Dome to be destroyed and the construction of the Third Temple begun. All evangelicals would immediately rush to go to Israel, he opined.

==Influence and depiction==
===Homages in art and architecture===
It was long believed that the Dome of the Rock echoed the architecture of the Temple in Jerusalem, as can be seen in Raphael&#x27;s &quot;The Marriage of the Virgin&quot; and in Perugino&#x27;s &quot;Marriage of the Virgin&quot;.

For the same reason, the Dome of the Rock has inspired the architecture of a number of buildings. These include the 15th-century octagonal Church of St. Giacomo in Italy, the 19th-century octagonal Moorish Revival-style Rumbach Street Synagogue in Budapest, as well as the Mausoleum of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent in Istanbul and the New Synagogue in Berlin, Germany.

===On banknotes===
The Dome of the Rock has been depicted on the obverse and reverse of several Middle Eastern currencies:

<doc id="65726" wikidata="Q931457" url="?curid=65726" title="Lost Gardens of Heligan">
<text>The Lost Gardens of Heligan (, meaning &quot;willow tree garden&quot;) are located near Mevagissey in Cornwall, England and are considered to be amongst the most popular in the UK. The gardens are typical of the 19th century Gardenesque style with areas of different character and in different design styles.

The gardens were created by members of the Cornish Tremayne family from the mid-18th century to the beginning of the 20th century, and still form part of the family&#x27;s Heligan estate. The gardens were neglected after the First World War and restored only in the 1990s, a restoration that was the subject of several popular television programmes and books.

The gardens include aged and colossal rhododendrons and camellias, a series of lakes fed by a ram pump over 100 years old, highly productive flower and vegetable gardens, an Italian garden, and a wild area filled with subtropical tree ferns called &quot;The Jungle&quot;. The gardens also have Europe&#x27;s only remaining pineapple pit, warmed by rotting manure, and two figures made from rocks and plants known as the Mud Maid and the Giant&#x27;s Head.

They are listed Grade II in Historic England&#x27;s Register of Parks and Gardens.

The place name, properly pronounced , and not the commonly heard , is derived from the Cornish word &quot;helygen&quot;, &quot;willow tree&quot;.

==Geography==
The Lost Gardens of Heligan completely surround Heligan House and its private gardens. They lie some to the north-west of, and about above, the fishing village of Mevagissey. The gardens are by road from the town and railway station of St Austell and are principally in the civil parish of St Ewe, although elements of the eastern gardens are in Mevagissey parish.

The northern part of the gardens, which includes the main ornamental and vegetable gardens, are slightly higher than the house and slope gently down to it. The areas of the gardens to the west, south, and east of the house slope steeply down into a series of valleys that ultimately drain into the sea at Mevagissey. These areas are much wilder and include the Jungle and the Lost Valley.

==History==

The Heligan estate was originally bought by the Tremaynes in the 16th century, and earlier members of the family were responsible for Heligan House and the (still private) gardens that immediately surround it.

However, the more extensive gardens now open to the public were largely the result of the efforts of four successive squires of Heligan. These were:

*Rev. Henry Hawkins Tremayne
*John Hearle Tremayne, son of Henry Hawkins Tremayne
*John Tremayne, son of John Hearle Tremayne
*John Claude Lewis Tremayne, son of John Tremayne and better known as &quot;Jack&quot;

Two estate plans, dating from 1777 and sometime before 1810, show the changes wrought to the Heligan estate during Henry Hawkins&#x27; ownership. The first plan shows a predominantly parkland estate, with the site of today&#x27;s Northern Gardens occupied by a field. The second plan shows the development of shelter belts of trees surrounding the gardens, and the main shape of the Northern Gardens, the Mellon Yard and the Flower Garden are all readily discernible.

Henry Hawkins&#x27; descendants each made significant contributions to the development of the gardens, including the ornamental plantings along the estate&#x27;s Long Drive, The Jungle, the hybridising of rhododendrons and their planting around Flora&#x27;s Green, and the creation of the Italian Garden.

Before the First World War, the garden required the services of 22 gardeners to maintain it, but that war led to the deaths of 16 of those gardeners, and by 1916, the garden was being looked after by only eight men. By the 1920s, Jack Tremayne&#x27;s love of Italy, which had earlier inspired the Italian Garden, led him to set up permanent home there, and lease out Heligan. The house was tenanted for most of the 20th century, used by the US Army during the Second World War, and then converted into flats and sold, without the gardens, in the 1970s. Against this background, the gardens fell into a serious state of neglect, and were lost to sight.

After the childless death of Jack Tremayne, the Heligan estate came under the ownership of a trust to the benefit of several members of the extended Tremayne family. One of these, John Willis, lived in the area and was responsible for introducing record producer Tim Smit to the gardens. A group of fellow enthusiasts and he decided to restore the garden to its former glory, and eventually leased them from the Tremayne family.

The restoration, which was the subject of a six-part Channel 4 television series produced by Bamboo Productions and Cicada Films in 1996, proved to be an outstanding success, not only revitalising the gardens but also the local economy around Heligan by providing employment. The gardens are now leased by a company owned by their restorers, who continue to cultivate them and operate them as a visitor attraction.

<doc id="65730" wikidata="Q673519" url="?curid=65730" title="Arkham">
<text>Arkham () is a fictional city situated in Massachusetts, United States. An integral part of the Lovecraft Country setting created by H. P. Lovecraft, Arkham is featured in many of his stories and those of other Cthulhu Mythos writers.

Arkham House, a publishing company started by two of Lovecraft&#x27;s correspondents, August Derleth and Donald Wandrei, takes its name from this city as a tribute. Arkham Asylum, a fictional mental hospital in DC Comics&#x27; Batman mythos, is also named after Lovecraft&#x27;s Arkham.

==In Lovecraft&#x27;s stories==
Arkham is the home of Miskatonic University, which features prominently in many of Lovecraft&#x27;s works. The institution finances the expeditions in the novellas, &quot;At the Mountains of Madness&quot; (1936) and &quot;The Shadow Out of Time&quot; (1936). Walter Gilman, of &quot;The Dreams in the Witch House&quot; (1933), attends classes at the university. Other notable institutions in Arkham are the Arkham Historical Society and the Arkham Sanitarium. It is said in &quot;Herbert West—Reanimator&quot; that the town was devastated by a typhoid outbreak in 1905.

Arkham&#x27;s main newspaper is the &quot;Arkham Advertiser&quot;, which has a circulation that reaches as far as Dunwich. In the 1880s, its newspaper is called the &quot;Arkham Gazette&quot;.

Arkham&#x27;s most notable characteristics are its gambrel roofs and the dark legends that have surrounded the city for centuries.

===Location===
The precise location of Arkham is unspecified, although it may be surmised from Lovecraft&#x27;s stories to be some distance to the north of Boston, probably in Essex County, Massachusetts. 

Will Murray places Arkham in central Massachusetts and suggests it is based on the village of Oakham. Robert D. Marten rejects this and equates Arkham with Salem, with its name coming from Arkwright, Rhode Island (now part of Fiskville).

August Derleth describes Arkham as &quot;Lovecraft&#x27;s own well-known, widely used place-name for legend-haunted Salem, Massachusetts&quot;, and Lovecraft himself, in a letter to F. Lee Baldwin dated April 29, 1934, wrote that &quot;[my] mental picture of Arkham is of a town something like Salem in atmosphere [and] style of houses, but more hilly [and] with a college (which Salem [lacks]) ... I place the town [and] the imaginary Miskatonic [River] somewhere north of Salem—perhaps near Manchester.&quot;

Arkham Sanitarium appears in the short story &quot;The Thing on the Doorstep&quot; and may have been inspired by the Danvers State Insane Asylum, (Danvers State Hospital) in Danvers, Massachusetts. Danvers State Hospital itself appears in Lovecraft&#x27;s stories &quot;Pickman&#x27;s Model&quot; and &quot;The Shadow over Innsmouth&quot;.

===Miskatonic University===
Miskatonic University is a fictional university located in Arkham, near the banks of the (fictional) Miskatonic River. Lovecraft concocted the word &quot;Miskatonic&quot; as a mixture of root words from the Algonquian languages, the source of many place-names throughout New England. Anthony Pearsall believes the name is based on the Housatonic River, which extends from Long Island Sound through the Berkshires of Western Massachusetts and western Connecticut. 

After first appearing in H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s 1922 story &quot;Herbert West–Reanimator&quot;, the school was mentioned in numerous Cthulhu Mythos stories by Lovecraft and other writers. The story &quot;The Dunwich Horror&quot; implies that Miskatonic University is a elite university on par with Harvard, and that Harvard and Miskatonic are the two most popular schools for the Massachusetts &quot;Old Gentry&quot;. It is modeled on the northeastern Ivy League universities of Lovecraft&#x27;s day, perhaps Brown University in his hometown Providence, which Lovecraft himself wished to attend. Miskatonic&#x27;s student body is implied to be all-male like northeastern universities of Lovecraft&#x27;s time. The only female student mentioned is Asenath Waite in &quot;The Thing on the Doorstep&quot; (1937). 

The university library is famous for its collection of occult books, including one of the handful of genuine copies of the &quot;Necronomicon&quot;. Other tomes include &quot;Unaussprechlichen Kulten&quot; and the fragmentary &quot;Book of Eibon&quot;. Notable faculty members mentioned in Lovecraft&#x27;s stories included doctors Henry Armitage and Francis Morgan in &quot;The Dunwich Horror&quot;, and Professor William Dyer in &quot;At the Mountains of Madness&quot;. Later authors would people the university with their own characters.

<text>According to Greek mythology, the Korybantes or Corybantes (also Corybants) (; ) were the armed and crested dancers who worshipped the Phrygian goddess Cybele with drumming and dancing. They are also called the Kurbantes in Phrygia.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Korybantes&quot; is of uncertain etymology. Edzard Johan Furnée and R. S. P. Beekes have suggested a Pre-Greek origin.

Others refer the name to *κορυβή (&quot;korybé&quot;), the Macedonian version of κορυφή (&quot;koryphé&quot;) &quot;crown, top, mountain peak&quot;, explaining their association with mountains, particularly Olympus.

== Family ==
The Korybantes were the offspring of Apollo and the Muse Thalia or Rhetia. One account attests the parentage to Zeus and the Muse Calliope, or of Helios and Athena, or lastly, of Cronus.

==Kouretes==

The Kouretes () or Kuretes (see &quot;Ecstatics&quot; below) were nine dancers who venerated Rhea, the Cretan counterpart of Cybele. A fragment from Strabo&#x27;s Book VII gives a sense of the roughly analogous character of these male confraternities, and the confusion rampant among those not initiated: 

Many assert that the gods worshipped in Samothrace as well as the Kurbantes and the Korybantes and in like manner the Kouretes and the Idaean Daktyls are the same as the Kabeiroi, but as to the Kabeiroi they are unable to tell who they are.

Grant Showerman in the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition addressed the confusion, stating that the Korybantes &quot;are distinguished only [from the Kuretes] by their Asiatic origin and by the more pronouncedly orgiastic nature of their rites&quot;.

According to Oppian, the Curetes, who had been tasked with guarding the young Zeus, were turned into lions by Cronus. Zeus then made them into the kings of the animals, while his mother Rhea yoked them to her chartiot.

==Initiatory dance==

These armored male dancers kept time to a drum and the rhythmic stamping of their feet. Dance, according to Greek thought, was one of the civilizing activities, like wine-making or music. The dance in armor (the &quot;Pyrrhic dance&quot; or pyrrhichios [Πυρρίχη]) was a male coming-of-age initiation ritual linked to a warrior victory celebration. Both Jane Ellen Harrison and the French classicist Henri Jeanmaire have shown that both the Kouretes (Κουρῆτες) and Cretan Zeus, who was called &quot;the greatest &quot;kouros&quot; (κοῦρος)&quot;, were intimately connected with the transition of boys into manhood in Cretan cities.

The English &quot;Pyrrhic Dance&quot; is a corruption of the original &quot;Pyrríkhē&quot; or the &quot;Pyrríkhios Khorós&quot; &quot;Pyrrhichian Dance&quot;. It has no relationship with the king Pyrrhus of Epirus, who invaded Italy in the 3rd century BC, and who gave his name to the Pyrrhic victory, which was achieved at such cost that it was tantamount to a defeat.

==Ecstatics==
The Phrygian Korybantes were often confused by Greeks with other ecstatic male confraternities, such as the Idaean Dactyls or the Cretan Kouretes, spirit-youths (&quot;kouroi&quot;) who acted as guardians of the infant Zeus. In Hesiod&#x27;s telling of Zeus&#x27;s birth, when Great Gaia came to Crete and hid the child Zeus in a &quot;steep cave&quot;, beneath the secret places of the earth, on Mount Aigaion with its thick forests; there the Cretan Kouretes&#x27; ritual clashing spears and shields were interpreted by Hellenes as intended to drown out the infant god&#x27;s cries, and prevent his discovery by his cannibal father Cronus. Emily Vermeule observed,

This myth is Greek interpretation of mystifying Minoan ritual in an attempt to reconcile their Father Zeus with the Divine Child of Crete; the ritual itself we may never recover with clarity, but it is not impossible that a connection exists between the Kouretes&#x27; weapons at the cave and the dedicated weapons at Arkalochori&quot;.

Among the offerings recovered from the cave, the most spectacular are decorated bronze shields with patterns that draw upon north Syrian originals and a bronze gong on which a god and his attendants are shown in a distinctly Near Eastern style.

Korybantes also presided over the infancy of Dionysus, another god who was born as a babe, and of Zagreus, a Cretan child of Zeus, or child-doublet of Zeus. The wild ecstasy of their cult can be compared to the female Maenads who followed Dionysus.

Ovid, in &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, says the Kouretes were born from rainwater (Uranus fertilizing Gaia). This suggests a connection with the Hyades.

==Other functions==
The scholar Jane Ellen Harrison writes that besides being guardians, nurturers, and initiators of the infant Zeus, the Kouretes were primitive magicians and seers. She also writes that they were metal workers and that metallurgy was considered an almost magical art. There were several &quot;tribes&quot; of Korybantes, including the Cabeiri, the Korybantes Euboioi, the Korybantes Samothrakioi. Hoplodamos and his Gigantes were counted among Korybantes, and the Titan Anytos was considered a Kourete.

Homer referred to select young men as &quot;kouretes&quot;, when Agamemnon instructs Odysseus to pick out &quot;kouretes&quot;, the bravest among the Achaeans to bear gifts to Achilles. The Greeks preserved a tradition down to Strabo&#x27;s day, that the Kuretes of Aetolia and Acarnania in mainland Greece had been imported from Crete.

<doc id="65733" wikidata="Q146555" url="?curid=65733" title="Solanum">
<text>Solanum is a large and diverse genus of flowering plants, which include three food crops of high economic importance: the potato, the tomato and the eggplant (aubergine, brinjal). It is the largest genus in the nightshade family Solanaceae, comprising around 1,500 species. It also contains the so-called horse nettles (unrelated to the genus of true nettles, &quot;Urtica&quot;), as well as numerous plants cultivated for their ornamental flowers and fruit.

&quot;Solanum&quot; species show a wide range of growth habits, such as annuals and perennials, vines, subshrubs, shrubs, and small trees. Many formerly independent genera like &quot;Lycopersicon&quot; (the tomatoes) and &quot;Cyphomandra&quot; are now included in &quot;Solanum&quot; as subgenera or sections. Thus, the genus today contains roughly 1,500–2,000 species.

==Name==
The generic name was first used by Pliny the Elder (23–79 CE) for a plant also known as , most likely &quot;S. nigrum&quot;. Its derivation is uncertain, possibly stemming from the Latin word , meaning &quot;sun&quot;, referring to its status as a plant of the sun.

==Species having the common name &quot;nightshade&quot;==
The species most commonly called nightshade in North America and Britain is &quot;Solanum dulcamara&quot;, also called bittersweet or woody nightshade (so-called because it is a (scandent) shrub). Its foliage and egg-shaped red berries are poisonous, the active principle being solanine, which can cause convulsions and death if taken in large doses. Black nightshades (many species in the &quot;Solanum nigrum&quot; complex, &quot;Solanum&quot; sect. &quot;Solanum&quot;) have varying levels of toxins and are considered too toxic to eat by many people in North America and Europe, but young stems and leaves or fully ripened fruit of various species are cooked and eaten by native people in North America, Africa, and Asia. Deadly nightshade (&quot;Atropa belladonna&quot;) belongs, like &quot;Solanum&quot;, to subfamily Solanoideae of the nightshade family, but, unlike that genus, is a member of tribe Hyoscyameae (&quot;Solanum&quot; belongs to tribe Solaneae). The chemistry of &quot;Atropa&quot; species is very different from that of Solanum species and features the very toxic tropane alkaloids, the best-known of which is atropine.

== Taxonomy ==
The genus was established by Carl Linnaeus in 1753. Its subdivision has always been problematic, but slowly some sort of consensus is being achieved.

The following list is a provisional lineup of the genus&#x27; traditional subdivisions, together with some notable species. Many of the subgenera and sections might not be valid; they are used here provisionally as the phylogeny of this genus is not fully resolved yet and many species have not been reevaluated.

Cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data suggest that the present subdivisions and rankings are largely invalid. Far more subgenera would seem to warrant recognition, with &quot;Leptostemonum&quot; being the only one that can at present be clearly subdivided into sections. Notably, it includes as a major lineage several members of the traditional sections &quot;Cyphomandropsis&quot; and the old genus &quot;Cyphomandra&quot;.

== Ecology ==
&quot;Solanum&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species (butterflies and moths).

==Toxicity==
Most parts of the plants, especially the green parts and unripe fruit, are poisonous to humans (although not necessarily to other animals), with some species even being deadly.

== Uses ==
Many species in the genus bear some edible parts, such as fruits, leaves, or tubers. Three crops in particular have been bred and harvested for consumption by humans for centuries, and are now cultivated on a global scale:
* Tomato, &quot;S. lycopersicum&quot;
** Tomato varieties are sometimes bred from both &quot;S. lycopersicum&quot; and wild tomato species such as &quot;S. pimpinellifolium&quot;, &quot;S. peruvianum&quot;, &quot;S. cheesmanii&quot;, &quot;S. galapagense&quot;, &quot;S. chilense&quot;, etc. (such varieties include—among others—Bicentennial, Dwarf Italian, Epoch, Golden Sphere, Hawaii, Ida Red, Indigo Rose, Kauai, Lanai, Marion, Maui, Molokai, Niihau, Oahu, Owyhee, Parma, Payette, Red Lode, Super Star, Surecrop, Tuckers Forcing, V 121, Vantage, Vetomold, and Waltham.)
* Potato, &quot;S. tuberosum&quot;, fourth largest food crop.
** Less important but cultured relatives used in small amounts include &quot;S. stenotomum, S. phureja, S. goniocalyx, S. ajanhuiri, S. chaucha, S. juzepczukii, S. curtilobum&quot;.
* Eggplant (also known as brinjal or aubergine), &quot;S. melongena&quot;

Other species are significant food crops regionally, such as Ethiopian eggplant or scarlet eggplant (&quot;S. aethiopicum&quot;), naranjilla or lulo (&quot;S. quitoense&quot;), cocona (&quot;S. sessiliflorum&quot;), turkey berry (&quot;S. torvum&quot;), pepino or pepino melon (&quot;S. muricatum&quot;), tamarillo (&quot;S. betaceum&quot;), wolf apple (&quot;S. lycocarpum&quot;), garden huckleberry (&quot;S. scabrum&quot;) and &quot;bush tomatoes&quot; (several Australian species).

<text>is a moral code concerning samurai attitudes, behavior and lifestyle, formalized in the Edo period (1603–1868). There are multiple types of bushido which evolved significantly through history. Contemporary forms of bushido are still used in the social and economic organization of Japan. &quot;Bushido&quot; is also used as an overarching term for all the codes, practices, philosophies and principles of samurai culture. It is loosely analogous to the European concept of chivalry, but with some major differences.

== Origin ==
The concept of a samurai code or codes was developed and refined centuries before the Edo period in the Kamakura period. Such ideas formalized earlier moral values and ethics, most commonly stressing a combination of sincerity, frugality, loyalty, martial arts mastery, honour until death, &quot;bravery&quot;, and &quot;loyalty to the samurai&#x27;s lord.&quot; Bushido proper developed between the 16th and 20th centuries, but this was debated by pundits who believed they were building on a legacy dating back to the 10th century.

The term bushido itself is &quot;rarely attested in pre-modern literature&quot;, but a code of honor did exist among the writing elite and historians who were generally disgusted enough at the dishonorable activity of some fighters such as shinobi as to rarely mention them. Ideas of honor that led to bushido developed in response to the longstanding dishonorable behavior of samurai, emerging stealth and espionage techniques, and Zen Buddhist soldier tenets.

The relative peace in Japan during the Kamakura period favored ideas of honor in battle, expressed in customs such as announcing one&#x27;s family name and/or lineages before fighting, attempting to limit fights among warrior nobles to horseback archery or sword duels with no subterfuge or trickery, and conducting oneself like a legendary character or renowned hero (tales of daring were popular in the Kamakura period). Pre-bushido honor codes during this time were also contributed to by commoners, who sometimes took on similar roles to samurai and often used their family names as introductions to fighting despite not being noble. However, even during the relatively small family and land quarrels of this time, as well as duels thought to be honorable, warriors often disregarded these norms of combat and the announcement of family names or lineages was mostly a way to brag and assert a right to fight and/or gain whatever a faction was looking for after a fight. Outright bragging was also known to happen. These already tenuous codes of honor were weakened when the Japanese, expecting the invading Mongols to be laid-back with their combat, humiliatingly sent an envoy that fired a noisemaker arrow to officially commence the start of what the Japanese assumed would be a series of small duels and skirmishes. Additionally, Mongols usually cut swathes through soldiers that attempted to announce their lineages before facing them. Despite ultimately winning against the Mongols, these honor norms, along with the shogunate, were weakened enough to cause endemic division that led to the end of the Kamakura period and the court wars of the Nanboku-chō period.

Born from Neo-Confucianism during times of peace in the Edo period and following Confucian texts, while also being influenced by Shinto and Zen Buddhism, it balanced violence with the therapeutic ideals of wisdom and peace accepted at the time. It was developed further during the Muromachi period (1336–1573) and formally defined and applied in law by Tokugawa shogunates in the Edo period.

There is no strict definition, and interpretations of the code have varied over time. Bushido has undergone many changes throughout Japanese history, and various Japanese clans interpreted it in their own way until the 19th century, enough for it to be most often a series of unwritten oral expectations that could be described as different codes, with further variations likely existing in the same warrior noble house, rather than a single code.

One of the earliest known usages of bushido is in the extremely influential late 16th century text &quot;The Military Mirror of Kai&quot;, where it was used to describe unwritten rules in a complex metaphorical way that commoners could purportedly not live up to.

Another early use of the written term is in the Kōyō Gunkan in 1616 by Kōsaka Masanobu. In 1685, the ukiyo-e book by artist Hishikawa Moronobu included the term and artwork of samurai with simple descriptions meant for children. In 1642, the was written by samurai Saito Chikamori and included moral precepts which explained the theoretical aspects of bushido. It was written with accessible kana and intended for commoners, not warriors. It was very popular, demonstrating that the idea of bushido had spread among the population. The Kashoki shows that moral values were present in bushido by 1642.

The term, bushido, came into common international usage with the 1899 publication of Nitobe Inazō&#x27;s &quot;&quot; which was read by many influential western people. In &quot;Bushido&quot; (1899), Nitobe wrote:

Bushidō, then, is the code of moral principles which the samurai were required or instructed to observe...More frequently it is a code unuttered and unwritten...It was an organic growth of decades and centuries of military career. In order to become a samurai this code has to be mastered.

In &quot;Feudal and Modern Japan&quot; (1896), historian Arthur May Knapp wrote:

The samurai of thirty years ago had behind him a thousand years of training in the law of honor, obedience, duty, and self-sacrifice ... It was not needed to create or establish them. As a child he had but to be instructed, as indeed he was from his earliest years, in the etiquette of self-immolation.

== Etymology ==

 is a Japanese word that literally means &quot;warrior way&quot;. It is first attested in the 1616 work , a military chronicle recording the exploits of the Takeda clan. The term is a compound of , a Chinese-derived word first attested in Japanese in 712 with the &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; (Sino-Japanese reading), and . In modern usage, &quot;bushi&quot; is often used as a synonym for &quot;samurai&quot;; however, historical sources make it clear that &quot;bushi&quot; and &quot;samurai&quot; were distinct concepts, with the former referring to soldiers or warriors and the latter referring instead to a kind of hereditary nobility.

In the early 17th century, the term with its &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; reading was used alongside the synonymous alternative form , read using native Japanese vocabulary (&quot;kun&#x27;yomi&quot;) as &quot;mono no fu no michi&quot;. Another important term is .

== Usage ==
For centuries the samurai adhered to multiple types of the code of which the interpretations varied per samurai clan and per member of the military nobility. This encompassed morality, their role in society, and how to live a life with honor and virtue. The samurai had some common values, but they did not have a single definition or path that all samurai were required to abide. The samurai were as practical on the battlefield as any other warriors. These concepts, codes and ideals were ingrained in the samurai since they rose to power in the Kamakura period (1185–1333). At certain eras, there were prevalent rules and unwritten customs such as the &quot;Way of the Bow and the Horse&quot; (弓馬の道, kyūba no michi) since the 12th century and, in the Edo period, the code of the samurai was formalized with specific virtues and laws by the ruling Tokugawa Shogunate. Notable samurai, such as Miyamoto Musashi (1584–1645) and Yamamoto Tsunetomo (1659–1719)., wrote extensively about their interpretations of bushido. In the 1870s, the Meiji restoration abolished the samurai class and they were transferred to professional, military and business classes. However, the former samurai and their descendants continued to be influential in Japanese society because they occupied important positions. Bushido has continued to exist in various types. Additional concepts and ideas were added to bushido so that it could evolve with the times. It was used in the Armed Forces of the Empire of Japan and symbolically by the successor Japan Self-Defense Forces. In the Taisho period, bushido was advocated as the way of the merchant. It can be dormant for years and revived during geopolitical instability. Centuries of rule by the samurai class has left a deep impact on Japanese society. Thus various forms are still used today in e.g. Japanese culture, business, martial arts and communication.

===Myth and reality===
Bushido is often described as a specific moral code that all members of the samurai class were obligated to follow. However, historically, the samurai adhered to multiple warrior codes and the interpretations varied per samurai clan, individuals and eras. These codes and philosophies changed dramatically during the different eras. The earliest proto-bushido type existed since the Kamakura period (1185). The degrees of devotion and interpretations varied between individuals. Since at least the Sengoku period, samurai didn&#x27;t have compunction to use certain weapons. Retreating from battles did occur if it was unwinnable while others chose to fight till the end. Samurai did not actively seek an honorable death. However, it was honorable to die in the service of a daimyo only while furthering the daimyo&#x27;s cause.

Samurai had dark customs, the most notable: &quot;Kiri-sute gomen&quot; was the right to strike lower class who dishonored them. &quot;Seppuku&quot; was ritual suicide, to die honorably or restore one&#x27;s honor. &quot;Tsujigiri&quot; (crossroads killing) to attack a human opponent to test a weapon or skill became rampant in the early Edo period until a ban was issued. The exact frequency of tsujigiri is unknown and it was never officially condoned by any samurai clan. However, it and other types of samurai-committed murder did happen enough to become a point of complaint among Europeans.

Samurai did &quot;head collection&quot; with a ritual to beautify severed heads of worthy rivals and put on display. The samurai applied various cruel punishments on criminals. The most common capital punishments up until the Meiji Restoration were (in order of severity): decapitation, decapitation with disgraceful exposure of head post-death, crucifixion (for e.g. parricide), and death by burning with incendiaries. Members of the samurai class had the privilege to perform hara-kiri (suicide disemboweling). If it was not lethal then a friend or relation performed decapitation (kaishaku). In 1597, Toyotomi Hideyoshi ordered the prosecution of 26 Martyrs of Japan. They were tortured, mutilated, paraded through villages and executed by crucifixion, tied to crosses on a hill and impaled by lances (spears). In the 17th century, the Tokugawa Shogunate executed over 400 Christians (Martyrs of Japan) for being more loyal to their faith than the Shogunate. The capital punishments were beheading, crucifixion, death by burning and .

Bushido has been described as Japanese chivalry, and samurai in general have been described as being like Western knights. There are notable similarities and differences depending on which bushido type is compared with chivalry. Christianity had a modifying influence on the virtues of chivalry, whereas bushido was influenced by Zen Buddhism, Shinto, and Confucianism. Bushido is commonly associated with the moral norms of Nitobe Inazō&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (1900), because his book popularized the term bushido internationally. However, it is a romanticized interpretation of bushido which differs from other historical literature by samurai. Thus, the morals defined by Nitobe do not represent all of bushido. Some researchers claim that chivalric bushido as defined by Nitobe (a.k.a. Meiji Bushido) was invented in the 19th century. However, there is a plethora of historical literature about Japanese warrior codes, practices, philosophies since the Kamakura period. These types can be categorized by era into Sengoku, Edo, Meiji and Contemporary Bushido. Therefore the term &quot;bushido&quot; can be used as an &quot;overarching term&quot; for all the codes, practices, philosophies and principles of samurai culture.

Chinese politician Dai Jitao acknowledged the historical legitimacy of bushido and said it originated as a theory of a social order, but it had evolved considerably. In the Tokugawa period, bushido was used to describe an ethical theory and it became a religious concept based on Shinto. In the Meiji period, bushido absorbed European ideals and formed the foundation of Japan&#x27;s political ethics. Chinese writer Zhou Zuoren supported the historical legitimacy, although it was thought to be altered and corrupted in the modern period.

== Historical development ==
The values that became bushido evolved significantly over the centuries to the present. These first appeared as unwritten customs in the 12th century with shogun Minamoto Yoritomo. The written term &quot;bushido&quot; first appears in the Koyo Gunkan of roughly circa 1616, an account of the military exploits of the Takeda clan. Bushido evolved from being totally devoted to valor in battle into refined types that were more related to moral integrity. The samurai had different types of bushido in each era in history, reflecting changing requirements on the battlefield and in society. The era name should be used to describe the type of bushido.

=== Heian period ===
The first predecessor to bushido was the class morality system of the Heian period.

=== Kamakura period ===

The first proper Japanese central government was established around the year 700. Japan was ruled by the Emperor (Tennō) with bureaucratic support of the aristocracy. They gradually lost control of their armed servants, the samurai. By the mid-12th century, the samurai class had seized control. The samurai (bushi) ruled Japan with the shogun (将軍) as the overlord until the mid 19th century. The shogun was originally the Emperor&#x27;s military deputy. After the Genpei War (1180–1185), Minamoto no Yoritomo usurped power from the civil aristocracy by establishing a military government called the bakufu situated in Kamakura since 1192. The Emperor and his court became figureheads.
The appearance of bushido is linked to that of feudal Japan and the first shogun at the time of Minamoto no Yoritomo (1147–1199) in the 12th century. The own moral dimension bushido gradually appears in the warrior culture and landmark in stories and military treaties only from the 14th and 15th century. Thus is noted a permanence of the modern representation of its antiquity in Japanese culture and its diffusion.

In the 10th and 11th century there was the &quot;Way of the Man-At-Arms&quot; (Tsuwamon no michi), and the &quot;Way of the Bow and Arrows&quot; (Kyûsen / kyûya no Michi). At the time of the Genpei War (1180–1185), it was called &quot;Way of the Bow and the Horse&quot; (弓馬の道, kyūba no michi) because of the major importance of this style of combat for the warriors of the time, and because it was considered a traditional method, that of the oldest samurai heroes, such as Prince Shōtoku, Minamoto no Yorimitsu and Minamoto no Yoshiie (Hachimantarō). According to Louis Frédéric, the kyūba no michi appeared around the 10th century as a set of rules and unwritten customs that samurai were expected to comply. There was also &quot;Yumiya toru mi no narai&quot; (customs for those who draw the bow). This shows there was an emerging sense of ideal warrior behavior that evolved from daily training and warfare experience.

&quot;The Tale of the Heike&quot; depicts an idealized story of the Genpei War (1180–1185) with a struggle between two powerful samurai clans, the Minamoto and the Taira. Clearly depicted throughout the epic is the ideal of the cultivated warrior. During the early modern era, these ideals were vigorously pursued in the upper echelons of warrior society and recommended as the proper form of the Japanese man of arms. The influence of Shinto, Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism on bushido&#x27;s early development instilled among those who live by the code a religious respect for it.

Many early literary works of Japan talk of warriors, but the term &quot;bushidō&quot; does not appear in text until the Edo period. The code which would become bushido was conceptualized during the late-Kamakura period (1185–1333) in Japan. Since the days of the Kamakura shogunate, the &quot;way of the warrior&quot; has been an integral part of Japanese culture. Scholars generally regard pre-modern Japan as a &quot;warrior nation&quot; since the medieval period. The samurai were role models for society since medieval times. In accordance with Confucianism, one of their duties was to serve as a role model for society. They balanced their martial arts skills with peaceful accomplishments such as literature, poetry and the tea ceremony. Such as the medieval Japanese proverb &quot;Hana wa sakuragi, hito wa bushi&quot; (, literally &quot;the [best] blossom is the cherry blossom; the [best] man is the warrior&quot;). In 1843 Nakamura said: 

=== Muromachi-Azuchi (1336–1603) ===
During the Muromachi period (1336–1573) the way of the warrior began to &quot;refine&quot; by inserting in their daily activities, alongside martial training, Zen meditation, painting (monochrome style), ikebana, the tea ceremony, poetry such as the death poem (written by samurai before suicidal missions or battles) and literature.

Carl Steenstrup noted that 13th- and 14th-century writings (&quot;gunki monogatari&quot;) &quot;portrayed the &quot;bushi&quot; in their natural element, war, eulogizing such virtues as reckless bravery, fierce family pride, and selfless, at times senseless devotion of master and man&quot;.

The sayings of Sengoku-period retainers and warlords such as Katō Kiyomasa (1562–1611) and Nabeshima Naoshige were generally recorded or passed down to posterity around the turn of the 16th century when Japan had entered a period of relative peace. In a handbook addressed to &quot;all &quot;samurai&quot;, regardless of rank&quot;, Katō states:

Katō was a ferocious warrior who banned even recitation of poetry, stating:

Nabeshima Naoshige (1538–1618) says similarly, that it is shameful for any man to die without having risked his life in battle, regardless of rank, and that &quot;&quot;bushidō&quot; is in being crazy to die. Fifty or more could not kill one such a man. However, Naoshige also suggests that &quot;everyone should personally know exertion as it is known in the lower classes&quot;.

By the mid-16th century, several of Japan&#x27;s most powerful warlords began to vie for supremacy over territories amidst the Kyoto government&#x27;s waning power. With Kyoto&#x27;s capture by the warlord Oda Nobunaga in 1573, the Muromachi period concluded.

In 1551 CE, one of the first western people to visit Japan was the Roman Catholic missionary Francis Xavier. The description of Francis shows that honor, weaponry and warfare were valued of utmost importance in Japanese culture. 

The practice of decapitating and collecting enemy heads is an example of honor in samurai culture. The severed heads were shown to a general as evidence that they killed wanted opponents and to collect rewards. More heads meant higher prestige, honor and rewards. A beautification ritual of the severed heads called &quot;Ohaguro&quot; was performed. Prestigious heads were arranged on a table and presented in front of the warriors. All heads were identified and marked to prevent mistakes. The guards were left and right of the general and cited spells to transfix demonic spirits of the enemy. Then a samurai said his own name, lifted a box to show and describe the severed head. The general inspected the trophy heads while holding a fan so that the dead could not recognize his face. If the claimed head was correct then the samurai received a payment otherwise he was dismissed.

Despite the war-torn culmination of this era and the birth of the Edo period, Samurai codes of conduct continued to extend beyond the realms of warfare. Forms of bushido-related Zen Buddhism and Confucianism also emerged during this period. A Samurai adhering to bushido-like codes was expected to live a just and ethical social life; honoring the practices of the gentry in the absence of military campaigns.

=== Edo (1603–1868) ===

Japan enjoyed two and a half centuries of relative peace during the Edo period (1600 to the mid-19th century). Japan didn&#x27;t have domestic or international conflict. These peaceful times in Tokugawa society enabled bushido to be refined from a focus on &quot;valor in battle&quot; to more &quot;moral integrity&quot;.

The Tokugawa shogunate (1603–1867) codified aspects of the Samurai warrior values and formalized them into parts of the Japanese feudal law. In addition to the &quot;house codes&quot; issued in the context of the fiefdoms (han) and texts that described the right behavior of a warrior (such as the Hagakure), the first Buke shohatto (Laws for the Military Houses, 武家諸法度) was issued by the government in 1615, which prescribed to the lords of the fiefdoms (daimyo) and the samurai warrior aristocracy responsibilities and activities, the rules of conduct, simple and decent clothing, the correct supply in case of official visits, etc. The edicts were reissued in 1629, and in 1635, by the third shogun Tokugawa Iemitsu. The new edicts made clear the shogunate&#x27;s authority and its desire to assert control. The swordsmanship skills of the samurai developed into character-building martial arts.

During this period, the &quot;samurai&quot; class played a central role in the policing and administration of the country. The &quot;bushidō&quot; literature of this time contains much thought relevant to a warrior class seeking more general application of martial principles and experience in peacetime, as well as reflection on the land&#x27;s long history of war. The literature of this time includes:

* &quot;Shoke no Hyōjō&quot; by Ogasawara Sakuun (1621)
* &quot;Budo Shōshinshu&quot; (武道初心集) by Taira Shigesuke, Daidōji Yūzan (1639–1730)
*&quot;Hagakure&quot; as related by Yamamoto Tsunetomo to Tsuramoto Tashiro.
* Bugei Juhappan (武芸十八般)
* A Book of Five Rings by Miyamoto Musashi

The first mention of the term &quot;bushido&quot; is in the scriptures Koyo Gunkan (甲陽軍鑑) from Takeda-ryū (martial arts school), written around 1616 by samurai Kōsaka Masanobu (1527–1578). It consists of 20 scrolls that mention bushido over 30 times. It contains the history of the Takeda family and their military tactics. The Koyo Gunkan describes valor and exploits in battle. For example, it is a waste of talent when a bushido practitioner takes on administrative roles in government or financial affairs (e.g. dealings in rice, money, timber, or forest land). It emphasizes that bushido lies only in &quot;becoming as a spear&quot; on the battlefield. The scrolls were widely disseminated as a martial arts instruction manual by the samurai class and helped to popularize the term.

In Koyo Gunkan (1616), bushido is a survival technique for individual fighters, and it aims to make the development of the self and the clan troupe advantageous by raising the samurai name. He also affirms that he seeks a lord who praises himself for wandering, as reflected in Tōdō Takatora (1556–1630)&#x27;s deceased memoir that &quot;A samurai cannot be called a samurai until he has changed his lords seven times.&quot; Also, as symbolized by Asakura Norikage (1477–1555), &quot;The warrior may be called a beast or a dog; the main thing is winning.&quot; As symbolized by Asakura Norikage, it is essential to win the battle even with the slander of cowardice. The feature is that it also contains the cold-hearted philosophy. These are mainly related to the way of life as a samurai, and they are the teachings of each family, and they are also equivalent to the treatment of vassals.

Dr. Hiroko Willcock (senior lecturer at Griffith University, Australia) explained &quot;Koyo Gunkan is the earliest comprehensive extant work that provides a notion of bushido as a samurai ethos and the value system of the samurai tradition.&quot; However, it does not have a set of principles regarded as &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;, but rather varying perceptions widely regarded as formidable throughout different centuries. Emphasized by Thomas Cleary, 

During the Genna era (1615–1624) of the Edo period and later, the concept of &quot;the way of the gentleman&quot; (Shidō) was newly established by the philosopher and strategist Yamaga Sokō (1622–1685) and others who tried to explain this value in the morality of the Confucian Cheng–Zhu school. For the first time, Confucian ethics (such as Honor and Humanity&quot;, &quot;filial piety&quot;) became the norm required by samurai. Yamaga Sokō was widely viewed as the &quot;Sage of Bushidō&quot; in early twentieth-century Japan.

Martial arts scholar Ogasawara Sakuun compiled 20 scrolls called Shoke no Hyōjō about the military arts in 1621. Therein bushido is described as iji (willpower). The scrolls describe the essence of bushido as the strength to not yield to rewards or power, but adhere to personal convictions that dominate one&#x27;s inner principles.

In 1642, the was written by samurai &quot;Saitō Chikamori&quot; (斎藤親盛, 1603–1674) (ex-vassal of the Mogami clan from Yamagata Domain) and published. Chikamori&#x27;s pen name was Nyoraishi (如儡子). The kashoki are 5 scrolls with wide-ranging content, including samurai knowledge with moral precepts, the knowledge of ordinary people, the teachings of Confucian Buddhism, and narrative ones. It has moral precepts which explain theoretical aspects of bushido. The 5th scroll has an important definition that was made by a samurai: Thus the first known description of morality in bushido and the &quot;bushido spirit&quot; was the Kashoki.

The kashoki was important with promulgating the &quot;bushido spirit&quot; among the common population. Thus it was written for commoners, not warriors. Its accessibility made it very popular, because it was written in kana (hiragana and katakana) rather than kanji which can be read by people with elementary school reading skills. There were many editions which had major influence on the behavior of commoners such as adults, adolescents, women and generations.

Master swordsman Miyamoto Musashi&#x27;s life exemplifies bushido. Musashi (1584–1645) wrote The Book of Five Rings (Gorin no Sho) around 1643. It consists of five volumes (Earth, Water, Fire, Wind and Void). The Book of Earth describes the general framework of bushidō. For example: apply skills in any situation, always carry two swords, learn how to effectively use the lance, naginata, bow and arrow, and guns. A daimyo should know the strength of his troops and how to properly deploy them. Devote yourself to training to master a way, avoid evil acts and thoughts, broaden perspectives with arts and knowledge about different professions, make objective judgments etc.

In 1685, the ukiyo-e book by artist Hishikawa Moronobu (1618–1694) was published. It features heroic popular tales of samurai warriors with simple descriptions per artwork. The title includes the word &quot;bushido&quot; and it was meant for children which shows that it had spread among the general population.

The Chinese politician Dai Jitao (1891–1949) attended Nihon University&#x27;s law program in 1907. He was fluent in Japanese and learned about bushido. Dai criticized the supposedly violent nature of the traditional Japanese &quot;feudal class&quot; structure before the Meiji period. Dai said the samurai brutally exploited the class structure to abuse and kill people below them in the social order (and biasedly claimed the opposite for Chinese society as peace-loving). According to Dai, after Confucianism became influential in the 17th century, it brought ideas of benevolence and humanity that pacified the cruel samurai and set Japan upon the course to become a modern and civilized society. Dai also appreciated aspects of the samurai. For example Dai said: Japan continued to benefit from their spirit of self-sacrifice, selfless loyalty, and—after Confucianism was introduced—compassion. Dai blamed the problems of modern Japan (post-Meiji restoration) due to the loss of samurai virtues when the former merchant class gained power and large corporations started to steer government policy. Dai said after the samurai class was heavily influenced by Confucian ideals of compassion, their bushido became essentially a &quot;life of blood and tears&quot;, because they selflessly shed blood for their lords and cried tears of compassion for farmers and other lower class people.

The &quot;Hagakure&quot; contains many sayings attributed to Sengoku-period retainer Nabeshima Naoshige (1537–1619) regarding &quot;bushidō&quot; related philosophy early in the 18th century by Yamamoto Tsunetomo (1659–1719), a former retainer to Naoshige&#x27;s grandson, Nabeshima Mitsushige. The Hagakure was compiled in the early 18th century, but was kept as a kind of &quot;secret teaching&quot; of the Nabeshima clan until the end of the Tokugawa &quot;bakufu&quot; (1867). His saying, &quot;&quot;I have found the way of the warrior is death&quot;, was a summation of the focus on honour and reputation over all else that &quot;bushidō&quot; codified. This is occasionally misinterpreted that bushido is a code of death. The true meaning is by having a constant consciousness of death, people can achieve a state of freedom that transcends life and death, whereby &quot;it is possible to perfectly fulfill one&#x27;s calling as a warrior.&quot;&quot;

Tokugawa-era rōnin, scholar and strategist Yamaga Sokō (1622–1685) wrote extensively on matters relating to &quot;bushidō&quot;, &quot;bukyō&quot; (a &quot;warrior&#x27;s creed&quot;), and a more general &quot;shidō&quot;, a &quot;way of gentlemen&quot; intended for application to all stations of society. Sokō attempts to codify a kind of &quot;universal &quot;bushidō&quot;&quot; with a special emphasis on &quot;pure&quot; Confucian values, (rejecting the mystical influences of Tao and Buddhism in Neo-Confucian orthodoxy), while at the same time calling for recognition of the singular and divine nature of Japan and Japanese culture. These radical concepts—including ultimate devotion to the Emperor, regardless of rank or clan—put him at odds with the reigning shogunate. He was exiled to the Akō domain, (the future setting of the 47 Rōnin incident), and his works were not widely read until the rise of nationalism in the early 20th century.

The aging Yamamoto Tsunetomo&#x27;s interpretation of &quot;bushidō&quot; is perhaps more illustrative of the philosophy refined by his unique station and experience, at once dutiful and defiant, ultimately incompatible with the laws of an emerging civil society. Of the 47 &quot;rōnin&quot;—to this day, generally regarded as exemplars of &quot;bushidō&quot;—Tsunetomo felt they were remiss in hatching such a wily, delayed plot for revenge, and had been over-concerned with the success of their undertaking. Instead, Tsunetomo felt true &quot;samurai&quot; should act without hesitation to fulfill their duties, without regard for success or failure.

This romantic sentiment is of course expressed by warriors throughout history, though it may run counter to the art of war itself. This ambivalence is found in the heart of &quot;bushidō&quot;, and perhaps all such &quot;warrior codes&quot;. Some combination of traditional &quot;bushidō&quot;&#x27;s organic contradictions and more &quot;universal&quot; or &quot;progressive&quot; formulations (like those of Yamaga Sokō) would inform Japan&#x27;s disastrous military ambitions in the 20th century.

According to the social psychologist Toshio Yamagishi (:ja:山岸俊男, 1948–2018) &quot;Bushido is the ideal human image formed mainly in the Edo period, in other words a virtue in the groupism world.&quot; It was the perfect person that fitted the ideal control of the samurai administration in the Edo period.

=== Meiji-Showa (1868–1945) ===
Recent scholarship in both Japan and abroad has focused on differences between the samurai caste and the bushido theories that developed in modern Japan. Bushido evolved considerably over time. Bushido in the prewar period emphasized the role of the emperor and placed greater value on the imperial virtues of loyalty and self-sacrifice than many Tokugawa-era interpretations.
Prominent scholars consider the bushido prevalent since the Meiji era to be a simplification of the attributes of samurai. Samurai originally fought for personal matters and the honor of their family and clan. When Japan was unified, the role of samurai included public administrative responsibilities, such as public order preservation, judicial responsibility, infrastructure maintenance, disaster recovery, farmland development, healthcare administration and industrial promotion.

The samurai class was abolished in the 1870s and the role of those in it grew more bureaucratic, focusing on the formation of a modern nation-state. With the diminishing of social classes, some values were transferred to the whole population, such as loyalty to the emperor. The author Yukio Mishima asserted that &quot;invasionism or militarism had nothing to do with bushidō from the outset.&quot; According to Mishima, a man of bushido is someone who has a firm sense of self-respect, takes responsibility for his actions and sacrifices himself to embody that responsibility.

Dai Jitao credited the samurai with sole responsibility for the Meiji Restoration, which enabled Japan&#x27;s modernization, while the populace merely allowed it to happen. Dai argued that Japanese combative tendency and militarism were purely founded in Japan&#x27;s socio-religious superstitions centered on the notion of divine authority. It did not exist in Chinese or Indian thought.

Bushido was used as a propaganda tool by the government and military, who doctored it to suit their needs. The original Imperial Rescript to Soldiers and Sailors of 1882 uses the word &quot;hōkoku&quot; (報国), signifying the idea of indebtedness to one&#x27;s nation because of one&#x27;s birth. Such debt must be repaid through physical or mental exertion. This idea did not exist in earlier bushido.

Chinese writer Zhou Zuoren regarded the bushido promoted by the military as a corruption of a noble and ancient tradition. He discussed the act of seppuku and the importance of old samurai practices in his 1935 essay series, &quot;Riben guankui&quot;. He named the story of the Forty-seven rōnin of the Akō Domain, who were sentenced to seppuku after avenging their daimyo, and their legacy in the story Chūshingura (A Treasury of Loyal Retainers). He discussed the Sakai incident, in which 20 samurai from Tosa Domain committed seppuku in 1868 for attacking French sailors. These examples were compared with the soft punishment given to the soldiers who assassinated Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi in 1932. Zhou condemned them for not taking responsibility by committing suicide like traditional samurai. In 1936, Zhou wrote about the loss of humanity and empathy of traditional bushido during the deterioration of the Second World War. He pointed to the samurai novel by Jun&#x27;ichirō Tanizaki as an example where victors of a battle treated enemy corpses with dignity.

Bushido regained popularity and became intertwined with Japan&#x27;s nationalist expression in the mid-1800s in response to Britain&#x27;s invasion of China in the First Opium War. Xenophobia toward Westerners rose in Japan during the 1850s and 1860s which contributed to the perceived legitimacy of the imperial restoration. Use of &quot;bushido&quot; in text increased during this period and its concept was viewed with more positivity. While it disappeared during the 1870s, it reappeared in the 1880s to express the loss of traditional values during the rapid introduction of Western civilization and a renewed sense of urgency to defend Japanese traditions. The victory of Japan over China in 1895 restored a feeling of pride in bushido, which was considered the &quot;origin of military success.&quot;

The researcher Oleg Benesch argued that the concept of modern bushido changed throughout the modern era as a response to foreign stimuli in the 1880s, such as the English concept of the gentleman. Nitobe Inazō&#x27;s bushido interpretations followed a similar trajectory, though he was following earlier trends. This relatively pacifistic bushido was hijacked and adapted by militarists and the government from the early 1900s as nationalism increased around the time of the Russo–Japanese War.

The entrepreneur Fukuzawa Yukichi appreciated bushido and emphasized that maintaining the morale of scholars is the essence of eternal life. Nitoto Inazuke submitted his book, &quot;Bushido&quot;, to Emperor Meiji and stated, &quot;Bushido is prosperous here, assists Komo, and promotes the national style, so that the public will return to the patriotic virtues of loyal ministers.&quot; He wrote that bushido has slightly different requirements for men and women. For women, bushido means guarding their chastity, educating their children, supporting their husbands and maintaining their families.

The &quot;junshi&quot; suicide of General Nogi Maresuke and his wife on the death of Emperor Meiji earned praise as an example of opposition to the trend of decaying morals in Japan. It also earned criticism from those who believed that aspect of bushido should not be revived.

After the Meiji Restoration, the martial arts etiquette represented by Ogasawara-ryū (小笠原流) popularized training. Bushido-influenced martial arts and education corresponded with nationalistic ideals prevalent prior to 1941. Honoring tradition through bushido-inspired martial skills enabled society to remain interconnected, harnessing society&#x27;s reverence of ancestral practices for national strength. According to researcher William R. Patterson, &quot;The martial arts were seen as a way not to maintain ancient martial techniques but instead to preserve a traditional value system, Bushido, that could be used to nurture national spirit. In the midst of modernization the Japanese were struggling to hold onto some traditions that were uniquely Japanese and that could unify them as countrymen.&quot; For example, Kanō Jigorō argued, &quot;Because judo developed based on the martial arts of the past, if the martial arts practitioners of the past had things that are of value, those who practice judo should pass all those things on. Among these, the samurai spirit should be celebrated even in today&#x27;s society.&quot;

During interbellum and Second World War Shōwa Japan, bushido was pressed into use for militarism to present war as purifying, and death a duty. Bushido was pitched as revitalizing traditional values and &quot;transcending the modern&quot;. Bushido would provide a spiritual shield to let soldiers fight to the end. When giving orders, General Hideki Tojo routinely slapped the faces of the men under his command, saying face-slapping was a &quot;means of training&quot; men who came from families that were not part of the samurai caste, and for whom bushido was not second nature. Tojo wrote a chapter in the book &quot;Hijōji kokumin zenshū&quot; (&quot;Essays in time of national emergency&quot;) which the Army Ministry published in March 1934. It called for Japan to become a totalitarian &quot;national defense state&quot;. It included 15 essays by senior generals and argued Japan defeated Russia in the Russo–Japanese War because bushido gave the Japanese superior willpower: they did not fear death, unlike the Russians who wanted to live.
As the Second World War turned, the spirit of bushido was invoked to urge that all depended on the firm and united soul of the nation. When Japan lost the Battle of Attu, the government attempted to paint the more than two thousand Japanese deaths as an inspirational epic for the fighting spirit of the nation. Arguments that the plans for the Battle of Leyte Gulf, involving all Japanese ships, would expose Japan to serious danger if they failed, were countered with the plea that the Navy be permitted to &quot;bloom as flowers of death&quot;. The Japanese believed that indoctrination in bushido would give them the edge as the Japanese longed to die for the emperor, while the Americans were afraid to die. However, superior American pilot training and airplanes meant the Japanese were outclassed by the Americans. The first proposals of organized suicide attacks met resistance. While bushido called for a warrior to be always aware of death, they were not to view it as the sole end. However, desperation brought about acceptance and such attacks were acclaimed as the true spirit of bushido.

Bushido regarded surrender as cowardly. Those who did forfeited their honor and lost dignity and respect:

The practice of beheading captured soldiers and prisoners originates from samurai culture in the 14th century or earlier. Japanese propaganda claimed prisoners of war captured during the Second World War denied mistreatment, and declared they were treated well by virtue of bushido generosity. Broadcast interviews with prisoners were described as not propaganda and voluntarily given based on such sympathy for the enemy that only bushido could inspire.

During the Second World War, many Japanese infantry were trapped on Guam, surrounded by Allied forces and low on supplies. Despite being outnumbered and in horrific conditions, many soldiers refused to surrender. Nitobe Inazō wrote, &quot;They continued to honor the Bushido code, believing that to rush into the thick of battle and to be slain in it, is easy enough... but, it is true courage to live when it is right to live, and to die only when it is right to die&quot;.

== Contemporary bushido ==
Bushido is still present in the social and economic organization of Japan. The samurai spirit and the virtues can still be found in Japanese society. Notable Japanese consider bushido an important part of their culture. Certain people use aspects of bushido as a way of life.

===Business===
Bushido affects myriad aspects in Japanese society and culture. In addition to impacts on military performance, media, entertainment, martial arts, medicine and social work, the bushido code has catalyzed corporate behavior. It is the mode of thought which historically structured the capitalist activity in the 20th century. Business relations, the close relationship between the individual and the group to which he or she belongs, the notions of trust, respect and harmony within the Japanese business world are based on bushido. Therefore, this is at the origin of the industrial harmony (:ja:労使協調) ideology of modern Japan. It allowed the country to become, with the Japanese economic miracle, the economic leader of Asia in the post-war years of the 1950-1960s.

The industrialist Eiichi Shibusawa preached bushido as necessary for future times, and the spirit of Japanese business from the Meiji era to the Taishō Democracy was advocated, which became the backbone necessary for Japanese management.

Shinya Fujimura examines Samurai ethics in the academic article The Samurai Ethics: A Paradigm for Corporate Behavior. Bushido principles indicate that rapid economic growth does not have to be a goal of modern existence. Relatedly, economic contentment is attainable regardless of hegemonic gross-domestic product statistics. In Fujimura&#x27;s words, &quot;The tradition permeates the country&#x27;s corporate culture and has informed many of its social developments&quot;. Fujimura states egalitarian principles practiced by the Samurai have permeated through modern business society and culture. Principles like Honorable Poverty, &quot;Seihin,&quot; encourage those with power and resources to share their wealth, directly influencing national success. Bushido also provides enterprises with social meaning. Eloquently described by Fujimura, &quot;The moral purpose that bushido articulates transcends booms and busts ... it is often said that a Japanese company is like a family, with executives caring about employees and employees showing respect to executives. Bushido, then, is part of the basis for a sense of national identity and belonging—an ideal that says the Japanese are one people, in it together.

In Taiwan there continued to be positive views of bushido. Such as late ROC president Lee Teng-hui (1923–2020) admired traditional Japanese values and bushido influenced him. In Japanese Taiwan, Teng-hui learned kendo in school and he was deeply influenced by bushido and the Japanese &quot;Bushido spirit&quot;, which had a significant impact on his future life. He wrote the 2003 Japanese book &quot;&quot;Bushido&quot; Precis: What is Noblesse oblige?&quot; which strived to boost Japan&#x27;s morale during the economic stagnation by appealing to Japan&#x27;s warrior spirit.

===Communication===
In utilization of bushido&#x27;s seven virtues, the Samurai code has been renewed to contribute towards development of communication skills between adult Japanese couples. Composed in 2012, the empirical document &quot;The Bushido Matrix for Couple Communication&quot; identifies a methodology which can be employed by counseling agents to guide adults in self-reflection and share emotions with their partner. This activity centers on the &quot;Bushido Matrix Worksheet&quot; (BMW). The authors accentuate, &quot;practicing Bushido virtues can ultimately enhance intra- and interpersonal relationship, beginning with personal awareness and extending to couple awareness. When utilizing the matrix, a couple is asked to identify one of the seven virtues and apply it to their past and current perceptions surrounding its prevalence in their lives. If individuals identify their relationship to be absent that specific virtue, they may now ponder of its inclusion for their benevolence.

===Martial arts===

The bushido spirit exists in Japanese martial arts. Modern bushido focuses more on self-defense, fighting, sports, tournaments and just physical fitness training. While all of these things are important to the martial arts, a much more important thing is missing, which is personal development. Bushido&#x27;s art taught soldiers the important secrets of life, how to raise children, how to dress, how to treat family and other people, how to cultivate personality, things related to finances. All of these things are important to be a respected soldier. Although modern bushido is guided by eight virtues, that alone is not enough. Bushido not only taught one how to become a soldier, but all the stages of life. The warrior described by bushido is not a profession but a way of life. It is not necessary to be in the army to be a soldier. The term &quot;warrior&quot; refers to a person who is fighting for something, not necessarily physically. Man is a true warrior because of what is in his heart, mind, and soul. Everything else is just tools in the creation to make it perfect. Bushido is a way of life that means living in every moment, honorably and honestly. All this is of great importance in the life of a soldier, both now and in the past.

In the book &quot;Kata – The true essence of Budo martial arts?&quot;, Simon Dodd and David Brown state that &quot;bushido spiritualism&quot; led the martial art &#x27;Bujutsu&#x27; to evolve into modern &#x27;Budō&#x27; (武道). For their analysis, they review the Kamakura period to reiterate the influence bushido held in martial arts evolution. They distinctly state, &quot;For clarity any reference to bushido is in relation to bujutsu within the Kamakura to pre-Meiji restoration period (pre-1868), and any links to budo are referring to the modern form of the martial arts.&quot; To supplement this affirmation Dodd and Brown discuss the variance between the meaning behind Bujutsu and Budo. According to Todd and Brown Budo is a redevelopment of traditional Kamakura period martial arts principles; Budo defines the &quot;way of the warrior&quot; through roots in religious ethics and philosophy. The martial art form&#x27;s translation binds it to Confucian and Buddhist concepts of bushido:

Respected karate-ka Kousaku Yokota explains how Bujutsu could be considered the &quot;art of fighting or killing&quot; and encompasses a &#x27;win at all costs&#x27; mentality required for battlefield survival (Yokota, 2010, p. 185). Conversely, Budo could be considered the &quot;art of living or life&quot; and enables a practitioner to live &quot;honestly and righteously or at least with principles&quot;. Expanding on both these points, Deshimaru (1982, p. 11; p. 46) reports that the ideogram for bu means to &quot;the cease the struggle&quot; and that &quot;in Budo the point is...to find peace and mastery of the self&quot;

Iaidō, in its transmission and its practice, is the martial art which takes up, in its entirety, bushido by the etiquette, the code of honor, the dress, the carrying of the sword and the fight against oneself rather than against the opponent. Modern combat sports like kendo derive their philosophy from bushido; unlike other martial arts, prolonged contact or multiple hits tend to be disadvantaged in favor of simple, clean attacks on the body. Bushido has also inspired the code of honor for disciplines such as aikijutsu, aikido, aikibudo, judo, jujitsu, Kyudo, or the chanbara.

Kendo has the bushido spirit as epitomized by the motto &quot;Ken Zen Ichi Nyo&quot; (lit. &quot;the sword and Zen are one&quot;) (剣 禅 一 如). The philosopher Tetsuro Watsuji (1889–1960) wrote that kendo involves raising a struggle to a life-transcending level by freeing oneself from an attachment to life. Kendo inculcates moral instruction through strict adherence to a code of etiquette. There are kamidana (miniature Shinto shrine) in the dojo. The basic attitude in Kendo is noble by shunning base feelings and the aim is conquering the self.

===Way of life===
There are people who use bushido as a way of life. For example, the Japanese music artist Gackt said that his philosophical way of life is similar to bushido. In 2011, during interviews about his martial arts action movie Bunraku (2010) he said: Other notable people who use bushido in life are for example: former ROC president Lee Teng-hui (1923–2020).

In October 2011, Spain&#x27;s Prince of Asturias Award for Concord was given to the heroes of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster aka the Fukushima 50. They were praised for their conduct which &quot;embodied the values most deeply rooted in Japanese society&quot; and &quot;courage and exemplary behaviour&quot; with self-sacrifice. This was described by the media as &quot;samurai spirit&quot;.

===Japan Self-Defense Forces===

The Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) are the successor of the Armed Forces of the Empire of Japan which existed from 1868 till 1947. The JSDF was officially established with the Self-Defense Forces Act in 1954 (Act No. 165 of 1954). It is primarily used for national defense due to limitations of Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution. Bushido is only used symbolically for example with names for combat exercises such as Exercise Bushido Guardian (2019). There are supporters and opposition for introducing bushido to the JSDF.

====Supporters====
Since 2000, numerous general officers proclaimed the importance of bushido with lectures. Bushido is useful for uniting troops with slogans such as &quot;bravery&quot; &quot;discipline&quot; and &quot;honesty&quot;.
Takashi Araya is an author, martial artist and JGSDF veteran (1982–2008) who established the first special forces of the JSDF. Araya wrote the 2015 book &quot;To those who Fight: Japan&#x27;s Cause and Bushido&quot;. He describes the essence of bushido which was created over a thousand years, and stresses the importance of training soldiers with bushido. He argues the purpose of Japanese martial arts is not to kill other people, but to cleanse their evil spirits and open the way for coexistence and co-prosperity. He says by training soldiers with bushido they can become the strongest fighting special forces. He wants JSDF members to inherit bushido to be brave and live dignifiedly. By using the action philosophy of bushido, they can become not only strong technologically, but also spiritually.

====Opposition====
Some critics say that excessive praise of bushido could repeat the mistakes of the former Imperial Armed Forces. The old Japanese military officer training of the IJA emphasized courage under fire (assault) instead of scientific ability. This created close solidarity between the soldiers and officers, but the officers lacked the skills that the soldiers had. Japanese troops put high significance on dying bravely and spiritual value instead of long-term endurance. This resulted in &quot;an inclination toward spirituality that ignores reality.&quot; This ethos exists in the JSDF. By having officers act like soldiers to earn their loyalty with the courage of bushido, it causes sleep-deprivation. It&#x27;s disputed whether it has significance for modern-warfare such as space warfare and cyberwarfare.

There was a case of a National Police Reserve (1950–1954) member who committed seppuku to apologize for being unable to become an ideal soldier. Another example was a young squadron commander who failed an exercise due to repeating to attack rather than change tactics. The pre-war Imperial Japanese Navy researcher Alexander Chiralfi said the Japanese mindset was subjective and had no interest in academically analysing unrelated maritime issues. Subjective and short-sighted discussions don&#x27;t yield wise strategies. The ideal image of executives should change according to the times and strategic environment. Thus, feudal bushido may not fit in a modern strategic environment and culture. Critics argue that the Meiji Army defeated the Qing and the Imperial Russian Army, not because of bushido, but because it was a professional military organization. Therefore, Bushido should not become the values of the whole JSDF. Rather the ideal image of JSDF executives should be defined to achieve national interests.

== Bushido types and tenets ==
Multiple bushido types have existed through history. The code varied due to influences such as Zen Buddhism, Shinto, Confucianism as well as changes in society and on the battlefield. The consistent ideal is martial spirit, including athletic, military skills and valor: fearlessness toward the enemy in battle. Bushido is a path that the samurai of each era pursued for their entire existence.

===Sengoku bushido===
* Period: Muromachi-Azuchi (Sengoku period) (1336–1603)
* Representative and important figures: Takeda Shingen, Uesugi Kenshin, Oda Nobunaga, Tokugawa Ieyasu, Katō Kiyomasa, Nabeshima Naoshige

During this era the daimyo expanded their territory by force and strategy. Battles occurred frequently in various places. The purpose was to expand one&#x27;s power. The killing of the enemy in a battle led to evaluation.
Certain daimyos wrote about moral codes with influence from Zen Buddhism and Confucianism. There was not yet a strong attachment to moral values (apart from honor) in samurai society. Honor, weaponry and warfare were valued of utmost importance in Japanese culture. Low priority was placed on monetary savings.

====Tenets====
* Honor
* Warfare
* Weapon mastery
* Martial arts
* Valor in battle
* Early moral codes

===Edo bushido===
* Period: Early to late Edo (1603–1868)
* Representative and important figures: Kōsaka Masanobu, Saito Chikamori, Yamaga Soko, Daidoji Tomoyama, Yagyu Munenori, Yamaoka Tesshu, Miyamoto Musashi, Yamamoto Tsunetomo, Hishikawa Moronobu

After the chaotic Sengoku period, politics were carried out in orderly fashion, and peace was maintained. The samurai could no longer obtain merit on the battlefield. They found more significance of the samurai&#x27;s existence in areas other than battle. As per Confucianism, it was valued to work for morals and the public, not for personal reasons. In addition, there were many martial arts who included religious boundaries such as Buddhism and Shinto.

A famous example is a passage in the &quot;Hagakure&quot;: &quot;Bushido is realised in the presence of death. In the case of having to choose between life and death you should choose death. There is no other reasoning. Move on with determination.&quot; It can be difficult to interpret, but it was radical at the time. That appeared in the Taihei era of the Edo period. The oral tradition of the Saga Domain feudal lord Nabeshima Mitsushige, Yamamoto Tsunetomo, is the main subject. There are many expressions that criticize the samurai who are associated with Confucianism and Buddhism that were popular at the time. There are many works that guide the art of treatment while describing the spirit of the samurai of the Sengoku period.

====Tenets====
&quot;Bushidō&quot; expanded and formalized the earlier code of the &quot;samurai&quot;, and stressed sincerity, frugality, loyalty, mastery of martial arts, and honour to the death. Under the &quot;bushidō&quot; ideal, if a &quot;samurai&quot; failed to uphold his honor he could only regain it by performing &quot;seppuku&quot; (ritual suicide). The core of bushido consists of a combination of teachings from Japan&#x27;s three main philosophical traditions: 1. Buddhist precepts of serenity, stoicism, and non-attachment to life. 2. Shinto notions of fidelity and patriotism, and 3. Confucian morality. People imbued with can serenely carry out their work in the face of any adversity, and have the willpower to master themselves. Taira Shigesuke, Daidōji Yūzan wrote &quot;Bushido Shoshinshu&quot; (武道初心集) (pre-1730) which provides practical and moral instructions for samurai to improve personal, social and professional standards.

In an excerpt from his book &quot;Samurai: The World of the Warrior&quot;, historian Stephen Turnbull describes the role of seppuku in feudal Japan:

In the world of the warrior, seppuku was a deed of bravery that was admirable in a samurai who knew he was defeated, disgraced, or mortally wounded. It meant that he could end his days with his transgressions wiped away and with his reputation not merely intact but actually enhanced. The cutting of the abdomen released the samurai&#x27;s spirit in the most dramatic fashion, but it was an extremely painful and unpleasant way to die, and sometimes the samurai who was performing the act asked a loyal comrade to cut off his head at the moment of agony.

&quot;Bushidō&quot; varied dramatically over time, and across the geographic and socio-economic backgrounds of the &quot;samurai&quot;, who represented somewhere between 5% and 10% of the Japanese population. The first Meiji-era census at the end of the 19th century counted 1,282,000 members of the &quot;high &quot;samurai&quot;&quot;, allowed to ride a horse, and 492,000 members of the &quot;low samurai&quot;, allowed to wear two swords but not to ride a horse, in a country of about 25 million.

Some versions of &quot;bushidō&quot; include compassion for those of lower station, and for the preservation of one&#x27;s name. Early &quot;bushidō&quot; literature further enforces the requirement to conduct oneself with calmness, fairness, justice, and propriety. The relationship between learning and the way of the warrior is clearly articulated, one being a natural partner to the other.

Other pundits pontificating on the warrior philosophy covered methods of raising children, appearance, and grooming, but all of this may be seen as part of one&#x27;s constant preparation for death—to die a good death with one&#x27;s honor intact, the ultimate aim in a life lived according to &quot;bushidō&quot;. Indeed, a &quot;good death&quot; is its own reward, and by no means assurance of &quot;future rewards&quot; in the afterlife. Some &quot;samurai&quot;, though certainly not all (e.g., Amakusa Shirō), have throughout history held such aims or beliefs in disdain, or expressed the awareness that their station—as it involves killing—precludes such reward, especially in Buddhism. Japanese beliefs surrounding the &quot;samurai&quot; and the afterlife are complex and often contradictory, while the soul of a noble warrior suffering in hell or as a lingering spirit occasionally appears in Japanese art and literature, so does the idea of a warrior being reborn upon a lotus throne in paradise

The essence of bushido was defined by Saitō Chikamori as:
*Sincerity – do not lie, do not be insincere, do not be superficial
*Responsibility – do not be obsequious
*Frugality – do not be greedy
*Politeness – do not be rude, do not slander
*Modesty – do not be boastful, do not be arrogant
*Loyalty – do not be unfaithful
*Harmony – be on good terms with comrades
*Tranquility – do not be overly concerned with events
*Compassion – show concern for one another, be compassionate, with a strong sense of duty.

===Meiji bushido===
* Period: Meiji to mid Showa (1868–1945).
* Representative and important figures: Nitobe Inazō, Yukio Mishima, Kanō Jigorō, Kanno Kakumyō, Eiichi Shibusawa, Fukuzawa Yukichi

Meiji bushido added absolute subservience to the will of the Emperor with an emphasis on loyalty and self-sacrifice. The book &quot;&quot; by Nitobe Inazō popularized bushido internationally during the Meiji era. However, the morals that he described are romanticized interpretations and do not represent all of bushido through history.

In the Taishō era, bushido as the way of the merchant was advocated by industrialist Shibusawa Eiichi (1840–1931), known as the &quot;father of Japanese capitalism&quot;. Shibusawa was also a warrior who learned Shindō Munen-ryū and Hokushin Ittō-ryū. He spent some time as a vassal of Tokugawa Yoshinobu, and since the Meiji era, he was a businessman and involved in the establishment of hundreds of corporations.
In his book &quot;Theory and Arithmetic&quot; (論語と算盤), he advocated the word &quot;samurai business talent&quot; (士魂商才). He linked the spirit of the samurai (bushido with the influence of Confucianism) to economic activity and denied immoral merchants for self-interest.

====Eight virtues of bushido (as defined by Nitobe Inazō)====

As mentioned above, historically there was no unified code, which varied from clan to clan, but the so-called &quot;bushidō&quot; code was typified by eight virtues according to Nitobe Inazō, while he was in the United States, under obvious influence of western chivalry notions in the Meiji Period (1900): Nitobe defined bushido as &quot;the ways which fighting nobles should observe in their daily life as in their vocation.&quot;
Be acutely honest throughout your dealings with all people. Believe in justice, not from other people, but from yourself. To the true warrior, all points of view are deeply considered regarding honesty, justice and integrity. Warriors make a full commitment to their decisions.
Hiding like a turtle in a shell is not living at all. A true warrior must have heroic courage. It is absolutely risky. It is living life completely, fully and wonderfully. Heroic courage is not blind. It is intelligent and strong.
Through intense training and hard work the true warrior becomes quick and strong. They are not as most people. They develop a power that must be used for good. They have compassion. They help their fellow men at every opportunity. If an opportunity does not arise, they go out of their way to find one.
True warriors have no reason to be cruel. They do not need to prove their strength. Warriors are not only respected for their strength in battle, but also by their dealings with others. The true strength of a warrior becomes apparent during difficult times.
When warriors say that they will perform an action, it is as good as done. Nothing will stop them from completing what they say they will do. They do not have to &#x27;give their word&#x27;. They do not have to &#x27;promise&#x27;. Speaking and doing are the same action.
Warriors have only one judge of honor and character, and this is themselves. Decisions they make and how these decisions are carried out are a reflection of who they truly are. You cannot hide from yourself.
Warriors are responsible for everything that they have done and everything that they have said and all of the consequences that follow. They are immensely loyal to all of those in their care. To everyone that they are responsible for, they remain fiercely true.

===Contemporary bushido===
* Period: 1950–Present
* Representative and important figures: Lee Teng Hui, Gackt, Fukushima 50

Bushido continues to exist in various forms in for example business, communication, martial arts and as a way of life. This is also called the bushido spirit.

== Modern translations ==
Modern Western translation of documents related to &quot;bushidō&quot; began in the 1970s with Carl Steenstrup, who performed research into the ethical codes of famous &quot;samurai&quot; including Hōjō Sōun and Imagawa Sadayo.

Primary research into &quot;bushidō&quot; was later conducted by William Scott Wilson in his 1982 text &quot;Ideals of the Samurai: Writings of Japanese Warriors&quot;. The writings span hundreds of years, family lineage, geography, social class and writing style—yet share a common set of values. Wilson&#x27;s work also examined older Japanese writings unrelated to the warrior class: the Kojiki, Shoku Nihongi, the Kokin Wakashū and the Konjaku Monogatari, as well as the Chinese Classics (the Analects, the Great Learning, the Doctrine of the Mean, and the Mencius).

In May 2008, Thomas Cleary translated a collection of 22 writings on &quot;bushidō&quot; by warriors, scholars, political advisers, and educators, spanning 500 years from the 14th to the 19th centuries. Titled &quot;Training the Samurai Mind: A Bushido Sourcebook,&quot; it gave an insider&#x27;s view of the samurai world: &quot;the moral and psychological development of the warrior, the ethical standards they were meant to uphold, their training in both martial arts and strategy, and the enormous role that the traditions of Shintoism, Buddhism, Confucianism, and Taoism had in influencing samurai ideals&quot;.

<doc id="65735" wikidata="Q707502" url="?curid=65735" title="The Rape of Nanking (book)">
<text>The Rape of Nanking: The Forgotten Holocaust of World War II is a bestselling 1997 non-fiction book written by Iris Chang about the 1937–1938 Nanjing Massacre—the mass murder and mass rape of Chinese civilians committed by the Imperial Japanese Army in Nanjing, the capital of the Republic of China, immediately after the Battle of Nanjing during the Second Sino-Japanese War. It describes the events leading up to the Nanjing Massacre, provides a graphic detail of the war crimes and atrocities committed by Japanese troops, and lambasts the Japanese government for its refusal to rectify the atrocities. It also criticizes the Japanese people for their ignorance about the massacre. It is one of the first major English-language books to introduce the Nanjing Massacre to Western and Eastern readers alike, and has been translated into several languages. The book significantly renewed public interest in Japanese wartime conduct in China, Korea, Southeast Asia (including the Philippines) and the Pacific.

The book received both acclaim and criticism by the public and by academics. It has been praised as a work that &quot;shows more clearly than any previous account&quot; the extent and brutality of the episode, while elements of Chang&#x27;s analysis of the motivations for the events, Japanese culture, and her calculation of the total numbers killed and raped were criticized as inaccurate because of her lack of training as a historian. Chang&#x27;s research on the book was credited with the finding of the diaries of John Rabe and Minnie Vautrin, both of whom played important roles in the Nanking Safety Zone, a designated area in Nanjing that protected Chinese civilians during the Nanjing Massacre.

The book prompted AOL executive Ted Leonsis to fund and produce &quot;Nanking&quot;, a 2007 documentary film about the eponymous massacre.

== Background ==

===Inspiration===
As a child, Chang was told by her parents that during the Nanjing Massacre, the Japanese &quot;sliced babies not just in half but in thirds and fourths.&quot; Her parents had escaped with their families from China to Taiwan and then to the United States after World War II. In the introduction of &quot;The Rape of Nanking,&quot; she wrote that throughout her childhood, the Nanjing Massacre &quot;remained buried in the back of [her] mind as a metaphor for unspeakable evil.&quot; When she searched the local public libraries in her school and found nothing, she wondered why no one had written a book about it.

The subject of the Nanjing Massacre entered Chang&#x27;s life again almost two decades later when she learned of producers who had completed documentary films about it. One of the producers was Shao Tzuping, who helped produce &quot;Magee&#x27;s Testament&quot;, a film that contains footage of the Nanjing Massacre itself, shot by the missionary John Magee. The other producer was Nancy Tong, who, together with Christine Choy, produced and co-directed &quot;In The Name of the Emperor&quot;, a film containing a series of interviews with Chinese, American, and Japanese citizens. Chang began talking to Shao and Tong, and soon she was connected to a network of activists who felt the need to document and publicize the Nanjing Massacre.

In December 1994, she attended a conference on the Nanjing Massacre, held in Cupertino, California, and what she saw and heard at the conference motivated her to write her 1997 book&quot;.&quot; As she wrote in the book&#x27;s introduction, while she was at the conference:I was suddenly in a panic that this terrifying disrespect for death and dying, this reversion in human social evolution, would be reduced to a footnote of history, treated like a harmless glitch in a computer program that might or might not again cause a problem, unless someone forced the world to remember it.

===Research===
Chang spent two years on research for the book. She found source materials in the US, including diaries, films, and photographs of missionaries, journalists, and military officers who were in Nanjing at the time of the massacre. Additionally, she traveled to Nanjing to interview survivors of the Nanjing Massacre and to read Chinese accounts and confessions by Japanese army veterans. Also, she incorporated the most recent work on the subject by Chinese and Chinese-American historians by including many disturbing photographs and a myriad of translated documents.

Before publication, the book was reviewed by Rana Mitter and Christian Jessen-Klingenberg of the University of Oxford; Carol Gluck of Columbia University; and William C. Kirby of Harvard University. At the time of writing, the Japanese government classified Japan’s World War 2 archives, making archival records unavailable to investigators.

==== The diaries ====
Chang&#x27;s research led her to make what one &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; article called &quot;Significant Discoveries&quot; on the subject of the Nanjing Massacre, in the forms of the diaries of two Westerners who were in Nanjing leading efforts to save lives during the Japanese invasion. The diaries documented the events of the Nanjing Massacre from the perspectives of their writers, and provided detailed accounts of atrocities that they saw, as well as information surrounding the circumstances of the Nanking Safety Zone.

One diary was that of John Rabe, a German Nazi Party member who was the leader of the Nanking Safety Zone, a demilitarized zone in Nanjing that Rabe and other Westerners set up to protect Chinese civilians. Rabe&#x27;s diary is over 800 pages, and contains one of the most detailed accounts of the Nanjing Massacre. Translated into English, it was published in 1998 by Random House as &quot;The Good Man of Nanking: The Diaries of John Rabe&quot;.

The other diary belonged to Minnie Vautrin, the American missionary who saved the lives of about 10,000 women and children when she provided them with shelter in Ginling College. Vautrin&#x27;s diary recounts her personal experience and feelings on the Nanjing Massacre; in it, an entry reads, &quot;There probably is no crime that has not been committed in this city today.&quot; It was used as source material by Hua-ling Hu for a biography of Vautrin and her role during the Nanjing Massacre, entitled &quot;American Goddess at the Rape of Nanking: The Courage of Minnie Vautrin&quot;.

Chang dubbed Rabe the &quot;Oskar Schindler of Nanking&quot; and Vautrin the &quot;Anne Frank of Nanking.&quot;

== Contents ==
&quot;The Rape of Nanking&quot; is structured into three main parts. The first uses a technique—what Chang calls the &quot;Rashomon perspective&quot;—to narrate the events of the massacre from three different perspectives: that of the Japanese military, the Chinese victims, and of the Westerners who tried to help Chinese civilians. The second part concerns the postwar reaction to the massacre, especially that of the American and European governments. The third part of the book examines the circumstances that, Chang believed, have kept knowledge of the massacre out of public consciousness decades after the war.

=== Atrocities ===
The book depicted in detail the killing, torture, and rape that occurred during the Nanjing Massacre. Chang listed and described the kinds of torture that were visited upon the residents, including live burials, mutilation, &quot;death by fire,&quot; &quot;death by ice,&quot; and &quot;death by dogs.&quot; Based on the testimony of a survivor of the massacre, Chang also describes a killing contest amongst a group of Japanese soldiers to determine who could kill the fastest. On the rape that occurred during the massacre, Chang wrote that &quot;certainly it was one of the greatest mass rapes in world history.&quot; She estimates that the number of women raped ranged from 20,000 to as many as 80,000, and states that women from all classes were raped, including Buddhist nuns. Furthermore, rape occurred in all locations and at all hours, and both very young and very old women were raped. Not even pregnant women were spared, Chang wrote, and that after gang rape, Japanese soldiers &quot;sometimes slashed open the bellies of pregnant women and ripped out the fetuses for amusement.&quot; Not all rape victims were women, according to the book, Chinese men were sodomized and forced to perform repulsive sexual acts. Some were forced to commit incest—fathers to rape their own daughters, brothers their sisters, sons their mothers.

=== Death toll ===
Chang wrote of the death toll estimates given by different sources:
* Chinese military specialist Liu Fang-chu proposed a figure of 430,000; officials at the Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall and the procurator of the District Court of Nanjing in 1946 stated at least 300,000 were killed;
* the International Military Tribunal for the Far East (IMTFE) judges concluded that more than 260,000 people were killed;
* Japanese historian Akira Fujiwara mentioned at least 200,000;
* John Rabe, who &quot;never conducted a systematic count and left Nanking in February,&quot; estimated 50,000 to 60,000; and
* Japanese historian Ikuhiko Hata argued the number killed was between 38,000 and 42,000.

The book discusses the research of historian Sun Zhaiwei of the Jiangsu Academy of Social Sciences. In his 1990 paper, &quot;The Nanking Massacre and the Nanking Population&quot;, Sun estimated the total number of people killed at 377,400. Using Chinese burial records, he calculated that the number of dead exceeded the figure of 227,400. He then added estimates totaling 150,000 given by Japanese Imperial Army Major Ohta Hisao in a confessional report about the Japanese army&#x27;s disposal efforts of dead bodies, arriving at the sum of 377,400 dead.

Chang wrote that there is &quot;compelling evidence&quot; that the Japanese themselves, at the time, believed that the death toll may have been as high as 300,000. She cited a message that Japan&#x27;s foreign minister Kōki Hirota relayed to his contacts in Washington, DC in the first month of the massacre on January 17, 1938. The message acknowledged that &quot;not less than three hundred thousand Chinese civilians [were] slaughtered, many cases in cold blood.&quot;

== Reception ==
=== Acclaim ===
&quot;The Rape of Nanking&quot; sold more than half a million copies when it was first published in the US, and according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, received general critical acclaim. The book remained on the &quot;New York Times&quot;&#x27; Best Seller list for 10 weeks and sold more than 125,000 copies in four months. Several leading historians said they believe that Chang’s revelation of Japanese wartime crimes and the country’s postwar attempts to cover up and distort history will help raise public awareness of the incident. 

Iris Chang became an instant celebrity in the US: she was awarded honorary degrees; invited to give lectures and to discuss the Nanjing Massacre on shows such as &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, &quot;Nightline&quot;, and &quot;The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer&quot;; profiled by &quot;The New York Times&quot;; and was featured on the cover of &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;. Moreover, Hillary Clinton invited her to the White House; U.S. historian Stephen Ambrose described her as &quot;maybe the best young historian we&#x27;ve got;&quot; and the Organization of Chinese Americans named her National Woman of the Year. The book&#x27;s popularity prompted a lengthy book tour, with Chang visiting 65 cities in over a year and a half.

The book also received praise from news media. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; wrote that it was the &quot;first comprehensive examination of the destruction of this Chinese imperial city,&quot; and that Chang &quot;skillfully excavated from oblivion the terrible events that took place.&quot; &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; described the book as &quot;a crushing indictment of the Japanese army&#x27;s behavior.&quot; The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; called it &quot;a powerful new work of history and moral inquiry&quot; and stated that &quot;Chang takes great care to establish an accurate accounting of the dimensions of the violence.&quot; &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; wrote that it was a &quot;compelling account of a horrendous episode that, until recently, has been largely forgotten.&quot;

According to William C. Kirby, Professor of History at Harvard University, Chang &quot;shows more clearly than any previous account just what [the Japanese] did,&quot; and that she &quot;draws connections between the slaughter in Europe and in Asia of millions of innocents during World War II.&quot; Ross Terrill, an associate in research at the Fairbank Center for East Asian Research at Harvard, wrote that the book is &quot;scholarly, an exciting investigation and a work of passion.&quot; Beatrice S. Bartlett, Emeritus Professor of History at Yale University, wrote, &quot;Iris Chang&#x27;s research on the Nanking holocaust yields a new and expanded telling of this World War II atrocity and reflects thorough research.&quot; Frederic Wakeman, director of the Institute of East Asian Studies at the University of California, Berkeley, wrote that the book was &quot;Heartbreaking ... An utterly compelling book. The descriptions of the atrocities raise fundamental questions not only about imperial Japanese militarism but the psychology of the torturers, rapists, and murderers.&quot;

=== Criticism ===
Chang&#x27;s critics alleged that she made an inappropriate and facile association between mass murder and Japanese culture, which included Japanese martial competitions and &quot;bushido&quot;; that her book contained incorrect historical dates and names because of her lack of training as a historian; that her personal feelings were evident in the book, making it lack intellectual rigor; that certain passages of her book were plagiarized; and that she placed an undue amount of attention to the actions of right-wing Japanese politicians and groups who refuse to acknowledge Japan&#x27;s wartime crimes, while ignoring the contributions made by Japanese historians and groups who are preserving the memory of the massacre.

Robert Entenmann, professor of history at St. Olaf College, disagreed with her description of the massacre. Entenmann opined that her explanations on why the massacre occurred were inadequate. Disagreements notwithstanding, he acknowledged that her book will help preserve the memory of the atrocity.

Sonni Efron of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; opined that the bitter row over Iris Chang&#x27;s book may leave Westerners with the misimpression that little has been written in Japan about the Nanjing Massacre, when in fact the National Diet Library holds at least 42 books about the Nanjing massacre and Japan&#x27;s wartime misdeeds, 21 of which were written by liberals investigating Japan&#x27;s wartime atrocities. In addition, Efron noted that geriatric Japanese soldiers have published their memoirs and have been giving speeches and interviews in increasing numbers, recounting the atrocities they committed or witnessed. After years of government-enforced denial, Japanese middle school textbooks now carry accounts of the Nanjing massacre as accepted truth. According to Efron, Japanese liberals alleged that the mistakes found in her book could undermine their endeavors, which include bringing the knowledge of the massacre to the Japanese public and pressuring the Japanese government into apologizing and atoning for the massacre.

&quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; staff writer Charles Burress wrote that Chang&#x27;s quote of a secret telegram sent by Japan&#x27;s foreign minister in 1938 was incorrectly cited as &quot;compelling evidence&quot; that Japanese troops killed at least 300,000 Chinese civilians in Nanjing. According to Burress, the figure of 300,000 Chinese civilians killed actually came from a message sent by a British reporter, concerning deaths not only in Nanjing but in other places as well. Additionally, Burress questioned her motivation for writing the book—whether she wrote it as an activist or as a historian, stating that the book &quot;draws its emotional impetus&quot; from her conviction to not let the Nanjing Massacre be forgotten by the world. Burress also cited Ikuhiko Hata, a Japanese history professor at Nihon University, who alleged that 11 photos in the book were misrepresented or fake. One particular photo shows women and children walking across a bridge with Japanese soldiers, and captioned as &quot;The Japanese rounded up thousands of women. Most were gang-raped or forced into military prostitution.&quot; Hata stated that the photo originally appeared in 1937 in a Japanese newspaper as part of a series of photos that showed peaceful scenes of Chinese villagers under Japanese occupation. He alleged that since she did not conduct research in Japan, she incorrectly portrayed Japan&#x27;s postwar attitudes towards the atrocity.

Chang responded to Burress&#x27; criticism in a letter written to the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, but the letter was not published by the newspaper. In the letter, she offered criticism of her own concerning Burress&#x27;s article. She said Hata is considered as an untrustworthy scholar because of his regular contributions to ultra right-wing Japanese publications such as the Bungei Shunju, a publication that published an article that supported Holocaust denial and another article that accused her, MacArthur Foundation and Rupert Murdoch of being part of a conspiracy of the Chinese Communist Party. In regards to his allegations of her misrepresentation of photos and captions, she wrote that Hata provided insufficient evidence to support his suggestion that the photos proved a peaceful Japanese occupation. 

In reference to the photo that shows women and children walking across a bridge with Japanese soldiers, she wrote: &quot;The Japanese, like the Nazis, relied on deception to make mass executions and mass rapes more manageable. The hapless Chinese men, women and children rounded up by the Japanese were usually kept ignorant about their fate until it was too late to escape. In Nanking, women were guided to &quot;marketplaces&quot; to buy ducks and chicken, only to find platoons of soldiers waiting to rape them. Men were assured of food, shelter and safety by Japanese soldiers, only to be lured to remote areas and used for bayonet practice or decapitation contests.&quot; She wrote that her book dealt with the &quot;horror of the Japanese invasion of China,&quot; and that the caption reading &quot;The Japanese rounded up thousands of women. Most were gang-raped or forced into military prostitution&quot; contained two statements of indisputable fact. 

Chang also issued a rejoinder to Burress&#x27;s argument that she incorrectly cited a telegram sent by Japan&#x27;s foreign minister. She wrote that while the original figure of 300,000 Chinese civilian deaths in Nanjing was reported by a British reporter, this figure was cited in a message that Japan&#x27;s foreign minister sent to his contacts in Washington, DC. Chang argued that figure&#x27;s use by a high-ranking Japanese government official was evidence that the Japanese government recognized 300,000 as the number of Chinese civilian deaths. Finally, she criticized Burress for his &quot;nitpick&quot; of small details in order to draw attention away from the scope and magnitude of the Nanjing Massacre, writing that such was a &quot;common tactic&quot; of Holocaust deniers.

In an interview, Chang challenged her critics by saying:&quot;If the Japanese Foreign Ministry and the rest of the Japanese government truly care about historical truth, then they should open all their wartime archives to the rest of the world … They shouldn’t mind inviting an international task force of historians – historians from the U.S., China, Japan, Korea, and other countries – to review all the high-level Japanese records from that era and publish them for general and scholarly consumptions. Trust me, if the newly released archival records disprove any of the facts in my book, I would be the first person to acknowledge this in the next edition of &quot;The Rape of Nanking&quot;. Moreover, I would help the Japanese government publicize the new facts to the world media and find prestigious publishers in the U.S. to translate the documents into English.&quot; 

=== Reaction in Japan ===
&quot;The Rape of Nanking&quot; has caused controversy in Japan. In 1999 Fujiwara said that:“A campaign to deny the Nanking massacre itself by presenting the weaknesses of Iris Chang’s book is being developed. The massacre denial groups have been using these kinds of tactics to maintain there was no massacre by presenting the contradictions in testimony quoted or by the use of inappropriate photos. Yet it is impossible to deny the occurrence of the incident itself because of these few mistakes. It is an illogical jump in reasoning to deny that the Nanking massacre ever happened by attacking her book.” 

Associate Professor David Askew of Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University said that Chang&#x27;s book ignited an interest in Japan about the massacre, increasing the amount of publications about the massacre in Japan. He opined that a unified Japanese view of the massacre doesn&#x27;t exist because of the internal debates and contentions surrounding the massacre, and that the different views can be categorized into mutually exclusive thought groups. He alleged that some aspects of her book undermined the argument put forth by the &quot;Great Massacre School of thought,&quot; which advocates for the validity of the findings at the Tokyo Trials and concludes that there were at least 200,000 casualties and at least 20,000 rape cases, and is considered to be the most sophisticated and credible thought group in Japan.

In an attempt to prevent her Japanese publisher from releasing a Japanese translation of her book, right-wing Japanese groups threatened and pilloried Chang, her publisher and Japanese historians. A Japanese literary agency informed her that several Japanese historians declined to review the translation; one professor backed out because of pressure placed on his family from &quot;an unknown organization&quot;; and her publisher said he was risking his life by publishing her book. According to Japan scholar Ivan P. Hall, revisionist historians in Japan organized a committee of right-wing scholars to condemn the book with repeated appearances at the Foreign Correspondents&#x27; Club in Tokyo and throughout Japan. Her Japanese publisher requested her to edit the book for the changes the right-wing Japanese scholars wanted made, which included deleting photographs, altering maps, and publishing a rebuttal to her book. According to the email correspondence between Chang and Soni Efron of the Los Angeles Times, Chang defended the veracity of her research. She said that she corrected 10 errors, including incorrect dates and misspelled names. She rejected the publisher&#x27;s attempt to annotate about 65 items in the book, stating that the suggested changes were additional details, interpretations or assertions by right-wing critics for which no evidence was provided. She wrote, “I can assure you that virtually none of these errors had anything to do with the historical description of the Nanking massacre itself.” Since the editorial requests were against the publishing contract between Chang and her publisher, she decided to withdraw the Japanese publication of her book and criticized her publisher for capitulating to right-wing threats. A Japanese translation of her book was not published and circulated in Japan until December 2007.

== Chang&#x27;s death ==
After publishing the book, Chang received hate mail, primarily from Japanese ultranationalists, and threatening notes on her car and also believed her phone was tapped. Her mother said the book &quot;made Iris sad&quot;. Suffering from depression, Chang was diagnosed with brief reactive psychosis in August 2004. She began taking medications to stabilize her mood. She wrote: I can never shake my belief that I was being recruited, and later persecuted, by forces more powerful than I could have imagined. Whether it was the CIA or some other organization I will never know. As long as I am alive, these forces will never stop hounding me. Chang killed herself on November 9, 2004. A memorial service was held in China by Nanjing Massacre survivors coinciding with her funeral in Los Altos, California. The Memorial Hall of the Victims in the Nanjing Massacre, a memorial site in Nanjing built to commemorate the victims of the Nanjing Massacre, added a wing dedicated to her in 2005.

In the US, a Chinese garden in Norfolk, Virginia, which contains a memorial to Minnie Vautrin, added a memorial dedicated to Chang, including her as the latest victim of the Nanjing Massacre, and drawing parallels between Chang and Vautrin, who also took her own life. Vautrin exhausted herself trying to protect women and children during the Nanjing Massacre and subsequently during the Japanese occupation of Nanjing, finally suffering a nervous breakdown in 1940. She returned to the US for medical treatment and killed herself a year later.

<doc id="65738" wikidata="Q171730" url="?curid=65738" title="Georges Clemenceau">
<text>Georges Benjamin Clemenceau (, ; ; 28 September 1841 – 24 November 1929) was a French statesman who served as Prime Minister of France from 1906 to 1909 and again from 1917 until 1920. A physician turned journalist, he played a central role in the politics of the Third Republic, particularly amid the end of the First World War. He was a key figure of the Independent Radicals, advocating for the separation of church and state, as well as the amnesty of the Communards exiled to New Caledonia.

After about 1,400,000 French soldiers were killed between the German invasion and Armistice, he demanded a total victory over the German Empire. Clemenceau stood for reparations, a transfer of colonies, strict rules to prevent a rearming process, as well as the restitution of Alsace–Lorraine, which had been annexed to Germany in 1871. He achieved these goals through the Treaty of Versailles signed at the Paris Peace Conference (1919–1920). Nicknamed &quot;Père la Victoire&quot; (&quot;Father Victory&quot;) or &quot;Le Tigre&quot; (&quot;The Tiger&quot;), he continued his harsh position against Germany in the 1920s, although not quite so much as President Raymond Poincaré or former Supreme Allied Commander Ferdinand Foch, who thought the treaty was too lenient on Germany, prophetically stating: &quot;This is not peace. It is an armistice for twenty years.&quot; Clemenceau obtained mutual defence treaties with the United Kingdom and the United States, to unite against possible future German aggression, but these never took effect due to the U.S. Senate&#x27;s failure to ratify the treaty, which thus also nullified British obligation.

==Early years==
Clemenceau was a native of Vendée, born in Mouilleron-en-Pareds. During the period of the French Revolution, Vendée had been a hotbed of monarchist sympathies. The department was remote from Paris, rural, and poor. His mother, Sophie Eucharie Gautreau (1817–1903), was of Huguenot descent. His father, Benjamin Clemenceau (1810–1897), came from a long line of physicians, but lived off his lands and investments and did not practice medicine. Benjamin was a political activist; he was arrested and briefly held in 1851 and again in 1858. He instilled in his son a love of learning, devotion to radical politics, and a hatred of Catholicism. The lawyer Albert Clemenceau (1861–1955) was his brother. His mother was a devout Protestant; his father was an atheist and insisted that his children should have no religious education. Clemenceau was interested in religious issues. He was a lifelong atheist with a sound knowledge of the Bible. He became a leader of anti-clerical or &quot;Radical&quot; forces that battled against the Catholic Church in France and the Catholics in politics. He stopped short of the more extreme attacks. His position was that if church and state were kept rigidly separated, he would not support oppressive measures designed to further weaken the Catholic Church.

After his studies in the Lycée in Nantes, Clemenceau received his French baccalaureate of letters in 1858. He went to Paris to study medicine and eventually graduated with the completion of his thesis &quot;De la génération des éléments anatomiques&quot; in 1865.

==Political activism and American experience==

In Paris, the young Clemenceau became a political activist and writer. In December 1861, he and some friends co-founded a weekly newsletter, &quot;Le Travail&quot;. On 23 February 1862, he was arrested by the imperial police for having placed posters summoning a demonstration. He spent 77 days in the Mazas Prison. Around the same time, Clemenceau also visited the old French revolutionary Auguste Blanqui and another Republican activist, Auguste Scheurer-Kestner, in jail, further deepening his hatred of the Napoleon III regime and advancing his fervent republicanism.

He was graduated as a doctor of medicine on 13 May 1865, founded several literary magazines, and wrote many articles, most of which attacked the imperial regime of Napoleon III. After a failed love affair, Clemenceau left France for the United States as the imperial agents began cracking down on dissidents and sending most of them to the &quot;bagne de Cayennes&quot; (Devil&#x27;s Island Penal System) in French Guiana.

Clemenceau worked in New York City during the years 1865–1869, following the American Civil War. He maintained a medical practice, but spent much of his time on political journalism for a Parisian newspaper, &quot;Le Temps&quot;. He taught French in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, and also taught and rode horseback at a private girls&#x27; school in Stamford, Connecticut, where he would meet his future wife. During this time, he joined French exile clubs in New York that were opposing the imperial regime.

As part of his journalistic activity, Clemenceau covered the country&#x27;s recovery following the Civil War, the workings of American democracy, and the racial questions related to the end of slavery. From his time in America, he retained a strong faith in American democratic ideals as opposed to France&#x27;s imperial regime, as well as a sense of political compromise that later would become a hallmark of his political career.

==Marriage and family==
On 23 June 1869, he married Mary Eliza Plummer (1849–1922), in New York City. She had attended the school where he taught horseback riding and was one of his students. She was the daughter of Harriet A. Taylor and William Kelly Plummer.

Following their marriage, the Clemenceaus moved to France. They had three children together, Madeleine (born in 1870), Thérèse (1872) and Michel (1873).

Although Clemenceau had many mistresses, when his wife took a tutor of their children as her lover, Clemenceau had her put in jail for two weeks and then sent her back to the United States on a steamer in third class. The marriage ended in a contentious divorce in 1891. He obtained custody of their children. He then had his wife stripped of French nationality.

==Beginning of the Third Republic==
Clemenceau had returned to Paris after the French defeat at the Battle of Sedan in 1870 during the Franco-Prussian War and the fall of the Second French Empire. After returning to medical practice as a physician in Vendée, he was appointed mayor of the 18th arrondissement of Paris, including Montmartre, and he also was elected to the National Assembly for the 18th arrondissement. When the Paris Commune seized power in March 1871, he tried unsuccessfully to find a compromise between the more radical leaders of the Commune and the more conservative French government. The Commune declared that he had no legal authority to be mayor and seized the city hall of the 18th arrondissement. He ran for election to the Paris Commune council, but received fewer than eight hundred votes and took no part in its governance. He was in Bordeaux when the commune was suppressed by the French Army in May 1871.

After the fall of the commune, he was elected to the Paris municipal council on 23 July 1871 for the Clignancourt quarter and retained his seat until 1876. He first held the offices of secretary and vice-president, then he became president in 1875.

===Chamber of Deputies===

In 1876, Clemenceau stood for the Chamber of Deputies (which replaced the National Assembly in 1875) and was elected for the 18th arrondissement. He joined the far left and his energy and mordant eloquence speedily made him the leader of the radical section. In 1877, after the Crisis of 16 May 1877, he was one of the republican majority who denounced the ministry of the Duc de Broglie. Clemenceau led resistance to the anti-republican policy of which the incident of 16 May was a manifestation. In 1879, his demand for the indictment of the Broglie ministry brought him prominence.

From 1876 to 1880, Clemenceau was one of the main defenders of the general amnesty of thousands of Communards, members of the revolutionary government of the 1871 Paris Commune who had been deported to New Caledonia. Along with other radicals and figures such as poet and then-Senator Victor Hugo, as well as a growing number of republicans, he supported several unsuccessful proposals. Finally a general amnesty was adopted on 11 July 1880. The &quot;reconciliation&quot; envisaged by Clemenceau could begin, as the remaining deported Communards returned to France, including his friend Louise Michel.

In 1880, Clemenceau started his newspaper, &quot;La Justice&quot;, which became the principal organ of Parisian Radicalism. From this time, throughout the presidency of Jules Grévy (1879–1887), he became widely known as a political critic and destroyer of ministries (&quot;le Tombeur de ministères&quot;) who avoided taking office himself. Leading the far left in the Chamber of Deputies, he was an active opponent of the colonial policy of Prime Minister Jules Ferry, which he opposed on moral grounds and also as a form of diversion from the more important goal of &quot;Revenge against Germany&quot; for the annexation of Alsace and Lorraine after the Franco-Prussian War. In 1885, his criticism of the conduct of the Sino-French War contributed strongly to the fall of the Ferry cabinet that year.

During the French legislative elections of 1885, he advocated a strong radical programme and was returned both for his old seat in Paris and for the Var, district of Draguignan. He chose to represent the latter in the Chamber of Deputies. Refusing to form a ministry to replace the one he had overthrown, he supported the right in keeping Prime Minister Charles de Freycinet in power in 1886 and was responsible for the inclusion of Georges Ernest Boulanger in the Freycinet cabinet as war minister. When General Boulanger revealed himself as an ambitious pretender, Clemenceau withdrew his support and became a vigorous opponent of the heterogeneous Boulangist movement, although the radical press continued to patronize the general.
By his exposure of the Wilson scandal, and by his personal plain speaking, Clemenceau contributed largely to the resignation of Jules Grévy from the presidency of France in 1887. He had declined Grévy&#x27;s request to form a cabinet upon the downfall of the cabinet of Maurice Rouvier by advising his followers not to vote for Charles Floquet, Jules Ferry, nor Charles de Freycinet, Clemenceau was primarily responsible for the election of an &quot;outsider&quot;, Marie François Sadi Carnot, as president.

The split in the Radical Party over Boulangism weakened his hand and its collapse meant that moderate republicans did not need his help. A further misfortune occurred in the Panama affair, as Clemenceau&#x27;s relations with the businessman and politician Cornelius Herz led to his being included in the general suspicion. In response to accusations of corruption levelled by the nationalist politician Paul Déroulède, Clemenceau fought a duel with him on 23 December 1892. Six shots were discharged, but neither participant was injured.

Clemenceau remained the leading spokesman for French radicalism, but his hostility to the Franco-Russian Alliance so increased his unpopularity that in the French legislative elections of 1893, he was defeated for his seat in the Chamber of Deputies after having held it continuously since 1876.

===Dreyfus Affair===
For nearly a decade after his 1893 defeat, Clemenceau confined his political activities to journalism. His career was further clouded by the long-drawn-out Dreyfus case, in which he took an active part as a supporter of Émile Zola and an opponent of the anti-Semitic and nationalist campaigns. In all, during the affair Clemenceau published 665 articles defending Dreyfus.

On 13 January 1898, Clemenceau published Émile Zola&#x27;s &quot;J&#x27;Accuse...!&quot; on the front page of the Paris daily newspaper, &quot;L&#x27;Aurore&quot;, of which he was owner and editor. He decided to run the controversial article that would become a famous part of the Dreyfus Affair in the form of an open letter to Félix Faure, the president of France.

In 1900, he withdrew from &quot;La Justice&quot; to found a weekly review, &quot;Le Bloc&quot;, to which he practically was the sole contributor. The publication of &quot;Le Bloc&quot; lasted until 15 March 1902. On 6 April 1902, he was elected senator for the Var district of Draguignan, although he had previously called for the suppression of the French Senate, as he considered it a strong-house of conservatism. He served as the senator for Draguignan until 1920.

Clemenceau sat with the Independent Radicals in the Senate and moderated his positions, although he still vigorously supported the Radical-Socialist ministry of Prime Minister Émile Combes, who spearheaded the anti-clericalist republican struggle. In June 1903, he undertook the direction of &quot;L&#x27;Aurore&quot;, the journal that he had founded. In it, he led the campaign to revisit the Dreyfus affair and to create a separation of church and state in France. The latter was implemented by the 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State.

Another cause of social justice Clemenceau was involved in was supporting the Young Turks in their struggle against the Hamidian government. When French authorities elected to shutter Ahmet Rıza&#x27;s &quot;Meşveret&quot;, many journalists, principally Clemenceau, choose to support his efforts against Yıldız&#x27;s lawsuit. The French censors, heeding Clemenceau&#x27;s mission for the protection of free speech, chose to only ban the Turkish version of the newspaper, with the French supplemental being allowed to continue publication.

===Cabinet and office of Prime Minister===
In March 1906, the ministry of Maurice Rouvier fell as a result of civil disturbances provoked by the implementation of the law on the separation of church and state and the victory of radicals in the French legislative elections of 1906. The new government of Ferdinand Sarrien appointed Clemenceau as minister of the interior in the cabinet. On a domestic level, Clemenceau reformed the French police forces and ordered repressive policies toward the workers movement. He supported the formation of scientific police by Alphonse Bertillon and founded the &quot;Brigades mobiles&quot; (French for &quot;mobile squads&quot;) led by Célestin Hennion. These squads were nicknamed &quot;Brigades du Tigre&quot; (&quot;The Tiger&#x27;s Brigades&quot;) after Clemenceau, who was nicknamed &quot;The Tiger&quot;.

The miners strike in the Pas de Calais after the Courrières mine disaster, which resulted in the death of more than one thousand persons, threatened widespread disorder on 1 May 1906. Clemenceau ordered the military against the strikers and repressed the wine growers strike in the Languedoc-Roussillon. His actions alienated the French Section of the Workers&#x27; International (SFIO) socialist party, from which he definitively broke in his notable reply in the Chamber of Deputies to Jean Jaurès, leader of the SFIO, in June 1906. Clemenceau&#x27;s speech positioned him as the strong man of the day in French politics; when the Sarrien ministry resigned in October, Clemenceau became premier.

After a proposal by the deputy Paul Dussaussoy for limited women&#x27;s suffrage in local elections, Clemenceau published a pamphlet in 1907 in which he declared that if women were given the vote France would return to the Middle Ages.

As the revolt of the Languedoc winegrowers developed Clemenceau at first dismissed the complaints, then sent in troops to keep the peace in June 1907.

During 1907 and 1908, he led the development of a new &quot;Entente cordiale&quot; with Britain, which gave France a successful role in European politics. Difficulties with Germany and criticism by the Socialist party in connection with the handling of the First Moroccan Crisis in 1905–06 were settled at the Algeciras Conference.

Clemenceau was defeated on 20 July 1909 in a discussion in the Chamber of Deputies on the state of the navy, in which bitter words he exchanged with Théophile Delcassé, the former president of the Council whose downfall Clemenceau had aided. Refusing to respond to Delcassé&#x27;s technical questions, Clemenceau resigned after his proposal for the order of the day vote was rejected. He was succeeded as premier by Aristide Briand, with a reconstructed cabinet.

Between 1909 and 1912, Clemenceau dedicated his time to travel, conferences, and the treatment of his illness. He went to South America in 1910, traveling to Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina (where he went as far as Santa Ana (Tucuman) in northwest Argentina). There, he was amazed by the influence of French culture and of the French Revolution on local elites.

He published the first issue of the &quot;Journal du Var&quot; on 10 April 1910. Three years later, on 6 May 1913, he founded &quot;L&#x27;Homme libre&quot; (&quot;The Free Man&quot;) newspaper in Paris, for which he wrote a daily editorial. In these media, Clemenceau focused increasingly on foreign policy and condemned the anti-militarism of the Socialists.

===First World War===

At the outbreak of World War I in France in August 1914, Clemenceau&#x27;s newspaper was one of the first to be censored by the government. It was suspended from 29 September 1914 to 7 October. In response, Clemenceau changed the newspaper&#x27;s name to &quot;L&#x27;Homme enchaîné&quot; (&quot;The Chained Man&quot;) and criticized the government for its lack of transparency and its ineffectiveness, while defending the patriotic &quot;union sacrée&quot; against the German Empire.

In spite of the censorship imposed by the French government on Clemenceau&#x27;s journalism at the beginning of World War I, he still wielded considerable political influence. As soon as the war started, Clemenceau advised Interior Minister Malvy to invoke Carnet B, a list of known and suspected subversives who were supposed to be arrested upon mobilisation, in order to prevent the collapse of popular support for a war effort. The Prefect of Police gave the same advice, but the government did not follow it. In the end, 80% of the 2,501 people listed on Carnet B as subversives volunteered for service. In autumn 1914, Clemenceau declined to join the government of national unity as justice minister.

He was a vehement critic of the wartime French government, asserting that it was not doing enough to win the war. His stance was driven by a will to regain the province of Alsace-Lorraine, a view shared by public opinion. The autumn of 1917 saw the disastrous Italian defeat at the Battle of Caporetto, the Bolshevik seizure of power in Russia, and rumours that former Prime Minister Joseph Caillaux and Interior Minister Louis Malvy might have engaged in treason. Prime Minister Paul Painlevé was inclined to open negotiations with Germany. Clemenceau argued that even German restitution of Alsace-Lorraine and the liberation of Belgium would not be enough to justify France abandoning her allies. This forced Alexandre Ribot and Aristide Briand (both the previous two prime ministers, of whom the latter was by far the more powerful politician who had been approached by a German diplomat) to agree in public that there would be no separate peace. For many years, Clemenceau was blamed for having blocked a possible compromise peace, but it is now clear from examination of German documents that Germany had no serious intention of handing over Alsace-Lorraine. The prominence of his opposition made him the best known critic and the last man standing when the others had failed. &quot;Messieurs, les Allemands sont toujours à Noyon&quot; (Gentlemen, the Germans are still at Noyon) wrote Clemenceau&#x27;s paper endlessly.

===Second term as prime minister===
In November 1917, at one of the darkest hours for the French war effort in World War I, Clemenceau was appointed to the prime ministership. Unlike his predecessors, he discouraged internal disagreement and called for peace among the senior politicians.

====1917: return to power====
Clemenceau governed from the Ministry of War on Rue Saint-Dominique. Almost his first act as prime minister was to relieve General Maurice Sarrail from his command of the Salonika front. This was the main topic of discussion at the first meeting of the war committee on 6 December, at which Clemenceau stated, &quot;Sarrail cannot remain there&quot;. The reason for Sarrail&#x27;s dismissal was his links with the socialist politicians Joseph Caillaux and Louis Malvy (at that time suspected of treasonable contacts with the Germans)
Churchill later wrote that Clemenceau &quot;looked like a wild animal pacing to and fro behind bars&quot; in front of &quot;an assembly which would have done anything to avoid putting him there, but, having put him there, felt they must obey&quot;.

When Clemenceau became prime minister in 1917 victory seemed to be elusive. There was little activity on the western front because it was believed that there should be limited attacks until the American support arrived. At this time, Italy was on the defensive, Russia virtually had stopped fighting – and it was believed that they would be making a separate peace with Germany . At home, the government had to deal with increasing demonstrations against the war, a scarcity of resources, and air raids that were causing huge physical damage to Paris as well as undermining the morale of its citizens. It also was believed that many politicians secretly wanted peace. It was a challenging situation for Clemenceau; after years of criticizing other men during the war, he suddenly found himself in a position of supreme power. He was isolated politically, however. He did not have close links with any parliamentary leaders (especially after he had antagonized them so relentlessly during the course of the war) and so, had to rely on himself and his own circle of friends.

Clemenceau&#x27;s assumption of power meant little to the men in the trenches at first. They thought of him as &quot;just another politician&quot;, and the monthly assessment of troop morale found that only a minority found comfort in his appointment. Slowly, however, as time passed, the confidence he inspired in a few, began to grow throughout all the fighting men. They were encouraged by his many visits to the trenches. This confidence began to spread from the trenches to the home front and it was said, &quot;We believed in Clemenceau rather in the way that our ancestors believed in Joan of Arc.&quot; After years of criticism against the French army for its conservatism and Catholicism, Clemenceau would need help to get along with the military leaders to achieve a sound strategic plan. He nominated General Henri Mordacq to be his military chief of staff. Mordacq helped to inspire trust and mutual respect from the army to the government which proved essential to the final victory.

Clemenceau also was well received by the media, because they felt that France was in need of strong leadership. It was widely recognized that throughout the war he was never discouraged and never stopped believing that France could achieve total victory. There were skeptics, however, who believed that Clemenceau, like other war-time leaders, would have a short time in office. It was said, &quot;Like everyone else ... Clemenceau will not last long – only long enough to clean up [the war].&quot;

====1918: crackdown====
As the military situation worsened in early 1918, Clemenceau continued to support the policy of total war – &quot;We present ourselves before you with the single thought of total war&quot; – and the policy of &quot;la guerre jusqu&#x27;au bout&quot; (war until the end). His speech of 8 March advocating this policy was so effective that it left a vivid impression on Winston Churchill, who would make similar speeches upon becoming British prime minister in 1940. Clemenceau&#x27;s war policy encompassed the promise of victory with justice, loyalty to the fighting men, and immediate and severe punishment of crimes against France.

Joseph Caillaux, a former French prime minister, disagreed with Clemenceau&#x27;s policies. He wanted to surrender to Germany and negotiate a peace, thus Clemenceau viewed Caillaux as a threat to national security. Unlike previous ministers, Clemenceau moved against Caillaux publicly. As a result, a parliamentary committee decided that Caillaux would be arrested and imprisoned for three years. Clemenceau believed, in the words of Jean Ybarnégaray, that Caillaux&#x27;s crime &quot;was not to have believed in victory [and] to have gambled on his nation&#x27;s defeat&quot;.

The arrest of Caillaux and others raised the issue of Clemenceau&#x27;s harshness, who in turn argued that the only powers he assumed were those necessary for winning the war. The many trials and arrests aroused great public excitement. These trials, far from making the public fear the government, inspired confidence, as the public felt that for the first time in the war, action was being taken and they were being firmly governed. The claims that Clemenceau&#x27;s &quot;firm government&quot; was a dictatorship found little support. Clemenceau was still held accountable to the people and media. He relaxed censorship on political views as he believed that newspapers had the right to criticize political figures: &quot;The right to insult members of the government is inviolable.&quot;

In 1918, Clemenceau thought that France should adopt Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s Fourteen Points, mainly because of its point that called for the return of Alsace-Lorraine to France. This meant that victory would fulfil the war aim that was crucial for the French public. Clemenceau was sceptical about some other points, however, including those concerning the League of Nations, as he believed that the latter could succeed only in a utopian society.

====1918: German spring offensive====
On 21 March 1918, the Germans began their great spring offensive. The allies were caught off guard and a gap was created in the British and French lines that risked handing over access to Paris to the Germans. This defeat cemented Clemenceau&#x27;s belief, and that of the other allies, that a coordinated, unified command was the best option. It was decided that Ferdinand Foch would be appointed as &quot;generalissimo&quot;.

The German line continued to advance and Clemenceau believed that the fall of Paris could not be ruled out. Public opinions arose that if &quot;the Tiger&quot;, as well as Foch and Philippe Pétain stayed in power for even another week, France would be lost and that a government headed by Aristide Briand would be beneficial to France, because he would make peace with Germany on advantageous terms. Clemenceau adamantly opposed these opinions and he gave an inspirational speech in the Chamber of Deputies; the chamber subsequently voted their confidence in him by 377 votes to 110.

As the allied counter-offensives began to push the Germans back, it became clear that the Germans could no longer win the war. Although they still occupied vast amounts of French territory, they did not have sufficient resources and manpower to continue their attack. As countries allied to Germany began to ask for an armistice, it was obvious that Germany would soon follow. On 11 November 1918, an armistice with Germany was signed. Clemenceau was embraced in the streets and attracted many admiring crowds.

==Paris Peace Conference==
To settle the international political issues left over from the conclusion of World War I, it was decided that a peace conference would be held in Paris, France. Famously, the Treaty of Versailles between Germany and the Allied Powers to conclude the conflict was signed in the Palace of Versailles, but the deliberations on which it was based were conducted in Paris, hence the name given to the meeting of the victorious heads of state that produced the treaties signed with the defeated powers: the Paris Peace Conference of 1919. On 13 December 1918, United States president Woodrow Wilson received an enthusiastic welcome in France. His Fourteen Points and the concept of a League of Nations had made a big impact on the war-weary French. At their first meeting, Clemenceau realized that Wilson was a man of principle and conscience.

The powers agreed that since the conference was being held in France, Clemenceau would be the most appropriate president. Also, he spoke both English and French, the official languages of the conference. Clemenceau had an unassailable position of full control of the French delegation. Parliament gave him a vote of confidence on 30 December 1918, by a vote of 398 to 93. The rules of the conference allowed France five plenipotentiaries. They became Clemenceau and four others who were his pawns. He excluded all military men, especially Foch. He excluded the president of France, Raymond Poincaré, keeping him in the dark on the progress of negotiations. He excluded all parliamentary deputies, saying he would negotiate the treaty and it would be parliament&#x27;s duty to vote it up or down, after it was finished.

The progress at the conference was much slower than anticipated and decisions were being tabled constantly. It was this slow pace that induced Clemenceau to give an interview showing his irritation to an American journalist. He said he believed that Germany had won the war industrially and commercially as its factories were intact and soon its debts would be overcome through &quot;manipulation&quot;. In a short time, he believed, the German economy would once again be much stronger than the French.

France&#x27;s leverage was jeopardized repeatedly by Clemenceau&#x27;s mistrust of Wilson and David Lloyd George, as well as his intense dislike of President Poincaré. When negotiations reached a stalemate, Clemenceau had a habit of shouting at the other heads of state and storming out of the room rather than participating in further discussion.

===Attempted assassination===
On 19 February 1919, as Clemenceau was leaving his apartment, a man fired several shots at the car. Clemenceau&#x27;s assailant, anarchist Émile Cottin, was nearly lynched. Clemenceau&#x27;s assistant found him pale, but conscious. &quot;They shot me in the back&quot;, Clemenceau told him. &quot;They didn&#x27;t even dare to attack me from the front.&quot; One bullet hit Clemenceau between the ribs, just missing his vital organs. Too dangerous to remove, the bullet remained with him for the rest of his life.

Clemenceau often joked about the &quot;assassin&#x27;s&quot; bad marksmanship – &quot;We have just won the most terrible war in history, yet here is a Frenchman who misses his target six out of seven times at point-blank range. Of course this fellow must be punished for the careless use of a dangerous weapon and for poor marksmanship. I suggest that he be locked up for eight years, with intensive training in a shooting gallery.&quot;

===Rhineland and the Saar===

When Clemenceau returned to the Council of Ten on 1 March, he found that little had changed. One issue that had not changed at all was the long-running dispute over France&#x27;s eastern frontier and control of the German Rhineland. Clemenceau believed that Germany&#x27;s possession of this territory left France without a natural frontier in the east and thus, was vulnerable to invasion. The British ambassador reported in December 1918 on Clemenceau&#x27;s views on the future of the Rhineland: &quot;He said that the Rhine was a natural boundary of Gaul and Germany and that it ought to be made the German boundary now, the territory between the Rhine and the French frontier being made into an Independent State whose neutrality should be guaranteed by the great powers.&quot;

Finally, the issue was resolved when Lloyd George and Woodrow Wilson guaranteed immediate military assistance if Germany attacked without provocation. It also was decided that the allies would occupy the territory for fifteen years, and that Germany could never rearm the area. Lloyd George insisted on a clause allowing for the early withdrawal of allied troops if the Germans fulfilled the treaty; Clemenceau inserted Article 429 into the treaty that permitted allied occupation beyond the fifteen years if adequate guarantees for allied security against unprovoked aggression were not met. This was in case the U.S. Senate refused to ratify the Treaty of Guarantee, thereby making null and void the British guarantee as well, since that was dependent on the Americans being part of it. This is, in fact, what did occur. Article 429 ensured that a refusal of the U.S. Senate to ratify the treaties of guarantee would not weaken them.

President Poincaré and Marshal Ferdinand Foch both pressed repeatedly for an autonomous Rhineland state. Foch thought the Treaty of Versailles was too lenient on Germany, stating &quot;This is not peace. It is an armistice for twenty years.&quot; At a cabinet meeting on 25 April Foch spoke against the deal Clemenceau had brokered and pushed for a separate Rhineland. On 28 April Poincaré sent Clemenceau a long letter detailing why he thought allied occupation should continue until Germany had paid all her reparations. Clemenceau replied that the alliance with America and Britain was of more value than an isolated France that held onto the Rhineland: &quot;In fifteen years I will be dead, but if you do me the honour of visiting my tomb, you will be able to say that the Germans have not fulfilled all the clauses of the treaty, and that we are still on the Rhine.&quot; Clemenceau said to Lloyd George in June, &quot;We need a barrier behind which, in the years to come, our people can work in security to rebuild its ruins. The barrier is the Rhine. I must take national feelings into account. That does not mean that I am afraid of losing office. I am quite indifferent on that point. But I will not, by giving up the occupation, do something which will break the willpower of our people.&quot; Later, he said to Jean Martel, &quot;The policy of Foch and Poincaré was bad in principle. It was a policy no Frenchman, no republican Frenchman could accept for a moment, except in the hope of obtaining other guarantees, other advantages. We leave that sort of thing to Bismarck.&quot;

There was increasing discontent among Clemenceau, Lloyd George, and Woodrow Wilson about slow progress and information leaks surrounding the Council of Ten. They began to meet in a smaller group, called the Council of Four, Vittorio Orlando of Italy being the fourth, although less weighty, member. This offered greater privacy and security and increased the efficiency of the decision-making process. Another major issue that the Council of Four discussed was the future of the German Saar region. Clemenceau believed that France was entitled to the region and its coal mines after Germany deliberately damaged the coal mines in northern France. Wilson, however, resisted the French claim so firmly that Clemenceau accused him of being &quot;pro-German&quot;. Lloyd George came to a compromise; the coal mines were given to France and the territory placed under French administration for 15 years, after which a vote would determine whether the region would rejoin Germany.

Although Clemenceau had little knowledge of the defunct Austrian-Hungarian empire, he supported the causes of its smaller ethnic groups and his adamant stance led to the stringent terms in the Treaty of Trianon that dismantled Hungary. Rather than recognizing territories of the Austrian-Hungarian empire solely within the principles of self-determination, Clemenceau sought to weaken Hungary, just as Germany was, and to remove the threat of such a large power within Central Europe. The entire Czechoslovakian state was seen a potential buffer from Communism and this encompassed majority Hungarian territories.

===Reparations===
Clemenceau was not experienced in the fields of economics or finance, and as John Maynard Keynes pointed out, &quot;he did not trouble his head to understand either the Indemnity or [France&#x27;s] overwhelming financial difficulties&quot;, but he was under strong public and parliamentary pressure to make Germany&#x27;s reparations bill as large as possible. Generally, it was agreed that Germany should not pay more than it could afford, but the estimates of what it could afford varied greatly. Figures ranged between £2,000 million and £20,000 million. Clemenceau realised that any compromise would anger both the French and British citizens and that the only option was to establish a reparations commission that would examine Germany&#x27;s capacity for reparations. This meant that the French government was not directly involved in the issue of reparations.

===Defence of the treaty===
The Treaty of Versailles was signed on 28 June 1919. Clemenceau now had to defend the treaty against critics who viewed the compromises he had negotiated as inadequate for French national interests. The French Parliament debated the treaty and Louis Barthou on 24 September claimed that the U.S. Senate would not vote for the Treaty of Guarantee or the Treaty of Versailles and therefore, it would have been wiser to have the Rhine as a frontier. Clemenceau replied that he was sure the Senate would ratify both and that he had inserted Article 429 into the treaty, providing for &quot;new arrangements concerning the Rhine&quot;. This interpretation of Article 429 was disputed by Barthou.

Clemenceau&#x27;s main speech on the treaty was delivered on 25 September. He said that he knew the treaty was not perfect, but that the war had been fought by a coalition and therefore, the treaty would express the lowest common denominator of those involved. He claimed criticisms of the details of the treaty were misleading; that critics should look at the treaty as a whole and see how they could benefit from it:

The treaty, with all its complex clauses, will only be worth what you are worth; it will be what you make it ... What you are going to vote to-day is not even a beginning, it is a beginning of a beginning. The ideas it contains will grow and bear fruit. You have won the power to impose them on a defeated Germany. We are told that she will revive. All the more reason not to show her that we fear her ... M. Marin went to the heart of the question, when he turned to us and said in despairing tones, &quot;You have reduced us to a policy of vigilance.&quot; Yes, M. Marin, do you think that one could make a treaty which would do away with the need for vigilance among the nations of Europe who only yesterday were pouring out their blood in battle? Life is a perpetual struggle in war, as in peace ... That struggle cannot be avoided. Yes, we must have vigilance, we must have a great deal of vigilance. I cannot say for how many years, perhaps I should say for how many centuries, the crisis which has begun will continue. Yes, this treaty will bring us burdens, troubles, miseries, difficulties, and that will continue for long years.

The Chamber of Deputies ratified the treaty by 372 votes to 53, with the Senate voting unanimously for its ratification. On 11 October Clemenceau gave his last parliamentary speech, addressed to the Senate. He said that any attempt to partition Germany would be self-defeating and that France must find a way of living with sixty million Germans. He also said that the bourgeoisie, like the aristocracy before them in the &quot;ancien régime&quot;, had failed as a ruling class. It was now the turn of the working class to rule. He advocated national unity and a demographic revolution: &quot;The treaty does not state that France will have many children, but it is the first thing that should have been written there. For if France does not have large families, it will be in vain that you put all the finest clauses in the treaty, that you take away all the Germans guns, France will be lost because there will be no more French&quot;.

==Domestic policies==
Clemenceau&#x27;s final tenure as prime minister witnessed the implementation of various reforms aimed at regulating the hours of labour. A general eight-hour day law passed in April 1919 amending the French Labour Code, and in June that year, existing legislation concerning the duration of the working day in the mining industry was amended by extending the eight-hour day to all classes of workers, &quot;whether employed underground or on the surface&quot;. Under a previous law of December 1913, the eight-hour limit had only applied to workers employed underground. In August 1919, a similar limit was introduced for all those employed in French vessels. Another law passed in 1919 (which came into operation in October 1920) prohibited employment in bakeries between the hours of 10 P.M. and 4 A.M.; this law is sometimes credited as the cause of the popularization if not the development of the baguette as a dominant form of bread in France, and the earliest written references to a &quot;baguette&quot; as a style of bread date from August 1920. A decree of May 1919 introduced the eight-hour day for workers on trams, railways, and in inland waterways, and a second of June 1919 extended this provision to the state railways. In April 1919, an enabling act was approved for an eight-hour day and a six-day work week, although farm workers were excluded from the act.

==Presidential bid==
In 1919, France adopted a new electoral system and the legislative election gave the National Bloc (a coalition of right-wing parties) a majority. Clemenceau only intervened once in the election campaign, delivering a speech on 4 November at Strasbourg, praising the manifesto and men of the National Bloc and he urged that the victory in the war needed to be safeguarded by vigilance. In private he was concerned at this huge swing to the right.

His friend, Georges Mandel, urged Clemenceau to stand for the presidency in the upcoming election and on 15 January 1920 he let Mandel announce that he would be prepared to serve if elected. However, Clemenceau did not intend to campaign for the post, instead he wished to be chosen by acclaim as a national symbol. The preliminary meeting of the republican caucus (a forerunner to the vote in the National Assembly) chose Paul Deschanel instead of Clemenceau by a vote of 408 to 389. In response, Clemenceau refused to be put forward for the vote in the National Assembly because he did not want to win by a small majority, but by a near-unanimous vote. Only then, he claimed, could he negotiate with confidence with the allies.

In his last speech to the cabinet on 18 January he said, &quot;We must show the world the extent of our victory, and we must take up the mentality and habits of a victorious people, which once more takes its place at the head of Europe. But all that will now be placed in jeopardy ... It will take less time and less thought to destroy the edifice so patiently and painfully erected than it took to complete it. Poor France. The mistakes have begun already.&quot;

==Last years==

Clemenceau resigned as prime minister as soon as the presidential election was held (17 January 1920) and took no further part in politics. In private, he condemned the unilateral occupation by French troops of the German city of Frankfurt in 1920 and said if he had been in power, he would have persuaded the British to join it.

He took a holiday in Egypt and the Sudan from February to April 1920, then embarked for the Far East in September, returning to France in March 1921. In June, he visited England and received an honorary degree from the University of Oxford. He met Lloyd George and said to him that after the armistice he had become the enemy of France. Lloyd George replied, &quot;Well, was not that always our traditional policy?&quot; He was joking, but after reflection, Clemenceau took it seriously. After Lloyd George&#x27;s fall from power in 1922 Clemenceau remarked, &quot;As for France, it is a real enemy who disappears. Lloyd George did not hide it: at my last visit to London he cynically admitted it&quot;.

In late 1922, Clemenceau gave a lecture tour in the major cities of the American northeast. He defended the policy of France, including war debts and reparations, and condemned American isolationism. He was well received and attracted large audiences, but America&#x27;s policy remained unchanged. On 9 August 1926, he wrote an open letter to the American President Calvin Coolidge that argued against France paying all its war debts: &quot;France is not for sale, even to her friends&quot;. This appeal went unheard.

He condemned Poincaré&#x27;s occupation of the Ruhr in 1923 as an undoing of the entente between France and Britain.

He wrote two short biographies, one of the Greek orator Demosthenes and one of the French painter Claude Monet. He also penned a huge two-volume tome, covering philosophy, history, and science, entitled &quot;Au Soir de la Pensée&quot;. Writing this occupied most of his time between 1923 and 1927.
During his last months, he wrote his memoirs, despite declaring previously that he would not write them. He was spurred into doing so by the appearance of Marshal Foch&#x27;s memoirs, which were highly critical of Clemenceau, mainly for his policy at the Paris Peace Conference. Clemenceau only had time to finish the first draft and it was published posthumously as &quot;Grandeurs et miseres d&#x27;une victoire&quot; (&quot;Grandeur and Misery of Victory&quot;). He was critical of Foch and also of his successors who had allowed the Versailles Treaty to be undermined in the face of Germany&#x27;s revival. He burned all of his private letters.

Clemenceau died on 24 November 1929 and was buried in a simple grave next to his father&#x27;s at Mouchamps.

==Personal life==
Clemenceau was a long-time friend and supporter of the impressionist painter Claude Monet. He was instrumental in persuading Monet to have a cataract operation in 1923. For more than a decade, Clemenceau encouraged Monet to complete his donation to the French state of the large &quot;Les Nymphéas&quot; (Water Lilies) paintings that now are on display in the Paris Musée de l&#x27;Orangerie. They are housed in specially constructed oval galleries that opened to the public in 1927.

Having fought a dozen duels against political opponents, Clemenceau knew the importance of exercise and practised fencing every morning even when he was an old man.

Clemenceau was an atheist.

He took an interest in Japanese art, especially Japanese ceramics. He collected approximately 3,000 small incense containers (&quot;kōgō&quot; 香合), which are now in museums. The Montreal Museum of Fine Arts held a special exhibition of his collection in 1978.

<text>Aratrum is the Latin word for ard, and &quot;arotron&quot; (ἄροτρον) is the Greek word. The Greeks appear to have had several kinds of ard from the records. Hesiod advised the farmer to always have two ards handy, so that if one broke the other could replace it. These ards should be of two kinds. The first was the body- or crook-ard, called &quot;autoguos&quot; (αυτογυος, &quot;self-limbed&quot;), in which the stilt (Gk &quot;echetle&quot;; Lat &quot;stiva&quot;) was of the same piece of timber as the ard-head (Gk &quot;elyma&quot;; Lat &quot;dentale&quot;) and the draft-beam (Gk &quot;histoboeus&quot;; Lat &quot;buris&quot;). The second was the sole-ard, called &quot;pekton&quot; (πηκτον, &quot;fixed&quot;), because in it three parts (stilt + sole (Gk &quot;gyes&quot;) + beam), which were of three kinds of timber, were adjusted to one another and fastened together by nails.

The &quot;autoguos&quot; crook-ard was made from a sapling with two branches growing from its trunk in opposite directions. In ploughing, the trunk served as the draft-beam, one of the two branches stood upwards and became the stilt, and the other scratched the ground and, sometimes shod with bronze or iron, acted as the share (Gk &quot;hynis&quot;; L &quot;vomer&quot;).

<text>Freetekno is a cultural movement that is present in Europe, Australia and North America. Freetekno sound systems or tribes form in loose collectives, frequently with anarchist philosophies. These sound systems join to hold parties wherever a viable space can be found – typical locations include warehouses (also known as squat parties), fields, abandoned buildings or forests. Because freetekno parties are usually held illegally this sometimes leads to clashes with the police, as was the case at both the 2004 and 2005 Czechtek festivals and many other, smaller parties around the world at different times.

==Music==

Tekno or hardtek is also a style of music which takes elements from both techno and hardcore, generally high-tempo and energetic. Speedbass, speedcore and other forms of underground music can be heard at freetekno parties. Not all Freetekno events play hardcore (especially the Frenchcore subgenre); psychedelic trance, happy hardcore, hardstyle, drum and bass, breakbeats, glitch, electro, world beat, house, techno, trance, and experimental fusion music are also present at freetekno events.

==History==
The freetekno movement appeared in first half of the 1990s in the United Kingdom and in the same decade was strong in Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Italy and the Netherlands. It also spread to Canada, Germany, the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, Poland, Slovakia, Spain, Switzerland and Romania.

Freetekno parties are intended as an example of a Temporary Autonomous Zone. In summer, large Freetekno parties, known as teknivals, attract thousands of people and can last a week or longer, with dozens of sound systems attend. 
==Regional scenes==
===United Kingdom===
London in the United Kingdom plays host to &quot;free parties&quot; (term used by the squat party scene) thrown by an array of sound systems every week. A regular theme is (and always has been) tekno, although drum &amp; bass, breakbeat, hardcore and psytrance can be common. Parties will occur all over London from derelict/deserted buildings in the borough of Hackney to empty office blocks in the City of London. However, the South West of England is generally considered to have the best free party &#x27;vibe&#x27; due to beautiful locations of the raves, as well as the welcoming nature of all those attending. In contrast to London, the music played in the south west is generally drum and bass, jungle, jungletek/raggatek, 4x4 and hardtek.

===Germany===
Tekk, also known as Tekke or Hardtekk is a musical genre primarily originating in the eastern part of Germany, gaining prominence in the 1990s. Known for its distinctive rhythm, Tekk, classified as a form of dance music, distinguishes itself by accentuating a pronounced rhythmic structure. The term &quot;Tekk&quot; evolved to become synonymous with hardcore dance music, with the conspicuous use of the letter &quot;k&quot; serving as an advertising strategy to signify the hardness of the sound at events and compilations (&quot;Tekno&quot;, &quot;Tekkno&quot;, &quot;Tekkkno&quot;). A parallel variant emerged with the rise of the Freetekno scene, creating a dynamic interplay with the evolving landscape of Tekk. The sonic identity of Tekk is often described as &quot;dumb&quot; or &quot;asozial/assi,&quot; characterized by heavy, monotone kicks and repetitive vocals, which can be compared to .

<doc id="65747" wikidata="Q172907" url="?curid=65747" title="Praetor">
<text>Praetor ( , ), also pretor, was the title granted by the government of ancient Rome to a man acting in one of two official capacities: (i) the commander of an army, and (ii) as an elected &quot;magistratus&quot; (magistrate), assigned to discharge various duties. The functions of the magistracy, the &quot;praetura&quot; (praetorship), are described by the adjective itself: the &quot;praetoria potestas&quot; (praetorian power), the &quot;praetorium imperium&quot; (praetorian authority), and the &quot;praetorium ius&quot; (praetorian law), the legal precedents established by the &quot;praetores&quot; (praetors). &quot;Praetorium&quot;, as a substantive, denoted the location from which the praetor exercised his authority, either the headquarters of his &quot;castra&quot;, the courthouse (tribunal) of his judiciary, or the city hall of his provincial governorship. The minimum age for holding the praetorship was 39 during the Roman Republic, but it was later changed to 30 in the early Empire.

==History of the title==
The status of the &quot;praetor&quot; in the early republic is unclear. The traditional account from Livy claims that the praetorship was created by the Sextian-Licinian Rogations in 367 BC, but it was well known both to Livy and other Romans in the late republic that the chief magistrates were first called &quot;praetor&quot;. For example, Festus &quot;refers to &#x27;the praetors, who are now consuls&#x27;&quot;.

The form of the republic changed substantially over its history and the accounts of the republic&#x27;s development in the early imperial period are marred with anachronisms projecting then-current practices into the past. In the earliest periods of the republic, &quot;praetor&quot; &quot;may not have meant anything more than leader in the most basic sense&quot;, deriving from &quot;praeire&quot; (to proceed) or &quot;praeesse&quot; (to be preeminent). These early praetors may have simply been clan leaders leading &quot;military forces privately and free from state control&quot; with a multitude of private leaders leading private armies.

These early military leaders were eventually institutionalised into fixed magistrate bodies elected by the people with clear state control over military activities. This was also probably assisted by &quot;the use of &quot;recuperatores&quot; to mediate disputes and fetial priests to control the declaration of war&quot;. The effect to make it more difficult for private individuals to start wars against Rome&#x27;s neighbours. Reforms in 449 BC also may have required &quot;for the first time that all military commanders be confirmed by a popular assembly [representing] the Roman people&quot;.

The emergence of the classical praetorship was a long process that had been underway by 367 BC. This was when the Sextian-Licinian Rogations were passed, giving the Roman people substantially more power over the selection of their military commanders. While Livy claims that the rogations created the praetorship in 367 BC to relieve the consuls of their judicial responsibilities, &quot;few modern historians would accept [this] account as written&quot;. Beyond the ancient knowledge that a title of praetor dated to the beginning of the republic, what became the classical praetorship was initially a military office with imperium and &quot;virtually identical in authority and capacity to the consulship&quot;. Furthermore, a fully-formed praetorship without colleague, as Livy&#x27;s account implies, would be a &quot;tremendous violation of Roman practice in which all regular magistracies were created in colleges consisting of at least two&quot;.

&quot;Scholars increasingly view the [rogations] as establishing a college of three (and only three) praetors, two of whom eventually developed into the historical consuls&quot;. What became the classical praetorship in its early years also was not viewed as being less than the consuls, as &quot;it was common practice for men to hold the praetorship after a consulship... since [doing so] was simply a method of holding &quot;imperium&quot; for a second year&quot;.

Livy reports that until 337 BC the praetor was chosen only from among the patricians. In that year, eligibility for the &quot;praetura&quot; was opened to the plebeians, and one of them, Quintus Publilius Philo, won the office.

Only in the 125 years after the election of three military leaders did a clear distinction emerge between what became the consuls and what became the praetors due to the &quot;normal Roman practice to reserve one commander in or near the city for purposes of defence and (eventually) for civilian administration&quot;. The glory and prestige won by the praetors fighting foreign wars, then still in Italy, is what led to the higher prestige of the consulship. Only in 180 BC with the passage of the &quot;lex Villia annalis&quot; was holding the praetorship after the consulship prohibited. Even after the consulship emerged from the praetorship with higher prestige and desirability, praetorian &quot;imperium&quot; was still not legally distinct (or inferior to consular &quot;imperium&quot;) until the very end of the republic.

Starting in 241 BC, praetors started to be prorogued, allowing former praetors to act in the place of a praetor (ie &quot;pro praetore&quot;) with power only &quot;to conduct war in his assigned &quot;provincia&quot; [with] no other concerns or duties&quot;. Prorogation, in effect, granted private individuals a legally fictitious power to act in the place of the normal magistrates, allowing them to continue to act within their assigned task (&quot;provincia&quot;). Prorogation allowed a magistrate, whose &quot;imperium&quot; did not expire with his term until crossing the pomerium or being stripped by the people, to continue in his assigned task or &quot;provincia&quot;.

==Praetura==
The elected praetor was a curule magistrate, exercised &quot;imperium&quot;, and consequently was one of the &quot;magistratus majores&quot;. He had the right to sit in the &quot;sella curulis&quot; and wear the &quot;toga praetexta&quot;. He was attended by six lictors. A praetor was a magistrate with &quot;imperium&quot; within his own sphere, subject only to the veto of the consuls (who outranked him).

The &quot;potestas&quot; and &quot;imperium&quot; (power and authority) of the consuls and the praetors under the Republic should not be exaggerated. They did not use independent judgment in resolving matters of state. Unlike today&#x27;s executive branches, they were assigned high-level tasks directly by senatorial decree under the authority of the SPQR.

Livy describes the assignments given to either consuls or praetors in some detail. As magistrates, they had standing duties to perform, especially of a religious nature. However, a consul or praetor could be taken away from his current duties at any time to head a task force, and there were many, especially military. Livy mentions that, among other tasks, these executive officers were told to lead troops against perceived threats (domestic or foreign), investigate possible subversion, raise troops, conduct special sacrifices, distribute windfall money, appoint commissioners and even exterminate locusts. Praetors could delegate at will. The one principle that limited what could be assigned to them was that their duties must not concern them with &quot;minima&quot;, &quot;little things&quot;. They were by definition doers of &quot;maxima&quot;. This principle of Roman law became a principle of later European law: &quot;Non curat minima praetor&quot;, that is, the details do not need to be legislated, they can be left up to the courts.

==Praetors and their duties==

===Republican===
A second praetorship was created around 241 BC, more clearly separating this office from that of the consulship. There were two reasons for this: to relieve the weight of judicial business and to give the Republic a magistrate with &quot;imperium&quot; who could field an army in an emergency when both consuls were fighting a far-off war.

====&quot;Praetor peregrinus&quot;====
By the end of the First Punic War, a fourth magistrate entitled to hold &quot;imperium&quot; appears, the &quot;praetor qui inter peregrinos ius dicit&quot; (&quot;the praetor who administers justice among foreigners&quot;). Although in the later Empire the office was titled &quot;praetor inter cives et peregrinos&quot; (&quot;among citizens and foreigners&quot;, that is, having jurisdiction in disputes between citizens and noncitizens), by the time of the 3rd century BC, Rome&#x27;s territorial annexations and foreign populations were unlikely to require a new office dedicated solely to this task. T. Corey Brennan, in his two-volume study of the praetorship, argues that during the military crisis of the 240s the second praetorship was created to make another holder of &quot;imperium&quot; available for command and provincial administration &quot;inter peregrinos&quot;. During the Hannibalic War, the &quot;praetor peregrinus&quot; was frequently absent from Rome on special missions. The urban praetor more often remained in the city to administer the judicial system.

====&quot;Praetor urbanus&quot;====
The &quot;praetor urbanus&quot; presided in civil cases between citizens. The Senate required that some senior officer remain in Rome at all times. This duty now fell to the &quot;praetor urbanus&quot;. In the absence of the consuls, he was the senior magistrate of the city, with the power to summon the Senate and to organize the defense of the city in the event of an attack. He was not allowed to leave the city for more than ten days at a time. He was therefore given appropriate duties in Rome. He superintended the Ludi Apollinares and was also the chief magistrate for the administration of justice and promulgated the Praetor&#x27;s Edict. These Edicts were statements of praetor&#x27;s policy as to judicial decisions to be made during his term of office. The praetor had substantial discretion regarding his Edict, but could not legislate. In a sense the continuing Edicts came to form a corpus of precedents. The development and improvement of Roman Law owes much to the wise use of this praetorial discretion.

====Additional praetors====

The expansion of Roman authority over other lands required the addition of praetors. Two were created in 227 BC, for the administration of Sicily and Sardinia, and two more when the two Hispanic provinces were formed in 197 BC. The dictator Lucius Cornelius Sulla transferred administration of the provinces to former consuls and praetors, simultaneously increasing the number of praetors elected each year to eight, as part of his constitutional reforms. Julius Caesar raised the number to ten, then fourteen, and finally to sixteen.

===Imperial===
Augustus made changes that were designed to reduce the Praetor to being an imperial administrator rather than a magistrate. The electoral body was changed to the Senate, which was now an instrument of imperial ratification. To take a very simplistic view, the establishment of the principate can be seen as the restoration of monarchy under another name. The Emperor therefore assumed the powers once held by the kings, but he used the apparatus of the republic to exercise them. For example, the emperor presided over the highest courts of appeal.

The need for administrators remained just as acute. After several changes, Augustus fixed the number at twelve. Under Tiberius, there were sixteen. As imperial administrators, their duties extended to matters that the republic would have considered &quot;minima&quot;. Two praetors were appointed by Claudius for matters relating to &quot;Fideicommissa&quot; (trusts), when the business in that department of the law had become considerable, but Titus reduced the number to one; and Nerva added a Praetor for the decision of matters between the &quot;fiscus&quot; (treasury) and individuals. Marcus Aurelius appointed a Praetor for matters relating to &quot;tutela&quot; (guardianship).

==Praetors as judges==
Roman court cases fell into the two broad categories of civil or criminal trials. The involvement of a Praetor in either was as follows.

===Actions===
In an &quot;actio&quot;, which was civil, the Praetor could either issue an &quot;interdictum&quot; (interdict) forbidding some circumstance or appoint a &quot;iudex&quot; (judge). Proceedings before the praetor were technically said to be &quot;in iure&quot;. At this stage, the Praetor would establish a &quot;formula&quot; directing the &quot;iudex&quot; as to the remedy to be given if he found that certain circumstances were satisfied; for instance, &quot;Let X be &quot;iudex&quot;. If it appears that the defendant ought to pay 10,000 sesterces to the plaintiff, let the &quot;iudex&quot; condemn the defendant to pay 10,000 sesterces to the plaintiff. If it does not so appear, let the plaintiff absolve him.&quot; After they were handed over to the &quot;iudex&quot;, they were no longer &quot;in iure&quot; before the Praetor, but &quot;apud iudicem&quot;. The &quot;iudicium&quot; of the &quot;iudex&quot; was binding. By the time of Diocletian, however, this two-stage process had largely disappeared, and the Praetor would either hear the whole case in person or appoint a delegate (a &quot;iudex pedaneus&quot;), taking steps for the enforcement of the decision; the &quot;formula&quot; was replaced by an informal system of pleadings.

During the time of the Roman Republic, the Urban Praetor allegedly issued an annual edict, usually on the advice of jurists (since the Praetor himself was not necessarily educated in the law), setting out the circumstances under which he would grant remedies. The legal provisions arising from the Praetor&#x27;s Edict were known as &quot;ius honorarium&quot;; in theory the Praetor did not have power to alter the law, but in practice the Edict altered the rights and duties of individuals and was effectively a legislative document. In the reign of Hadrian, however, the terms of the Edict were made permanent and the Praetor&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; legislative role was abolished.

===&quot;Quaestiones perpetuae&quot;===
The Praetors also presided at the &quot;quaestiones perpetuae&quot; (which were criminal proceedings), so-called because they were of certain types, with a Praetor being assigned to one type on a permanent basis. The Praetors appointed judges who acted as jurors in voting for guilt or innocence. The verdict was either acquittal or condemnation.

These quaestiones looked into &quot;crimina publica&quot;, &quot;crimes against the public&quot;, such as were worthy of the attention of a Praetor. The penalty on conviction was usually death, but sometimes other severe penalties were used. In the late Republic, the public crimes were:
*&quot;Repetundae&quot;
*&quot;Ambitus&quot;
*&quot;Majestas&quot;
*&quot;Peculatus&quot;
*&quot;Falsum&quot;
*&quot;De Sicariis et Veneficis&quot;
*&quot;De Patricidis&quot;

The last three were added by the Dictator Sulla in the early 1st century BC.

==Outdoor actions==
When the Praetor administered justice in a tribunal, he sat on a &quot;sella curulis&quot;, which was that part of the court reserved for the Praetor and his assessors and friends, as opposed to the &quot;subsellia&quot;, the part occupied by the &quot;iudices&quot; (judges) and others who were present. In court, the Praetor was referred to as acting &quot;e tribunali&quot; or &quot;ex superiore loco&quot; (lit. from a raised platform or from a higher place) but he could also perform ministerial acts out of court, in which case he was said to be acting &quot;e plano&quot; or &quot;ex aequo loco&quot; (lit. from the flat ground or from an equal or level place). For instance, he could in certain cases give validity to the act of manumission when he was out-of-doors, such as on his way to the bath or to the theatre.

==Later Roman era==
By 395 AD, the praetors&#x27; responsibilities had been reduced to a purely municipal role. Their sole duty was to manage the spending of money on the exhibition of games or on public works. However, with the decline of the other traditional Roman offices such as that of tribune, the praetorship remained an important portal through which aristocrats could gain access to either the Western or Eastern senates. The praetorship was a costly position to hold as praetors were expected to possess a treasury from which they could draw funds for their municipal duties.

==Byzantine Empire==
Like many other Roman institutions, the praetor (, &quot;praitōr&quot;) survived in the Eastern Roman Empire.

Emperor Justinian I (r. 527–565) undertook a major administrative reform beginning in 535, which involved the reunification of civil and military authority in the hands of the governor in certain provinces, and the abolition of the dioceses. The Diocese of Thrace had already been abolished by the end of the 5th century by Anastasius, and its &quot;vicarius&quot; became the new &quot;praetor Justinianus&quot; of Thrace, with authority over all the former Thracian provinces except for Lower Moesia and Scythia Minor, which became part of the &quot;quaestura exercitus&quot;. Similarly, the governors of Pisidia and Lycaonia, as well as Paphlagonia (enlarged by merging it with Honorias) were upgraded to &quot;praetores Justiniani&quot;, and received the rank of &quot;vir spectabilis&quot;. In addition, in Constantinople he replaced the &quot;praefectus vigilum&quot;, who was hitherto responsible for security, by a &quot;praetor populi&quot; (in Greek πραίτωρ [τῶν] δήμων, &quot;praitōr [tōn] dēmōn&quot;), with wide-ranging police powers.

In the early 9th century, the &quot;praitōr&quot; was a junior administrative official in the &quot;themata&quot;, subordinate to the governing &quot;stratēgos&quot;. Gradually however, the civil functionaries assumed greater power, and by the late 10th century, the &quot;praitores&quot; (or &quot;kritai&quot;, &quot;judges&quot;) were placed at the head of the civil administration of a &quot;thema&quot;. This division of civil and military duties was often abandoned in the 12th century, when the posts of civil &quot;praitōr&quot; and military &quot;doux&quot; were frequently held in tandem. The provincial post fell out of use after the collapse of the Empire in 1204.

According to Helene Ahrweiler, Emperor Nikephoros II (r. 963–969) reinstituted a praetor in Constantinople, as a high-ranking judge. He is possibly identical to the Palaiologan-era post of the &quot;praitōr tou demōu&quot;, whose holders are attested until 1355. According to the &quot;Book of Offices&quot; of pseudo-Kodinos, compiled around the same time, the &quot;praitōr tou demōu&quot; occupied the 38th place in the imperial hierarchy, between the &quot;megas tzaousios&quot; and the &quot;logothetēs tōn oikeiakōn&quot;, but held no official function. His court uniform consisted of a gold-brocaded hat (&quot;skiadion&quot;), a plain silk &quot;kabbadion&quot; tunic, and a plain, smooth wooden staff (&quot;dikanikion&quot;).

== Modern era ==
Classical Latin Praetor became medieval Latin Pretor; Praetura, Pretura, etc. During the interwar period the 71 counties of Romania were divided into a various numbers of &quot;plăși&quot; (singular: &quot;plasă&quot;), headed by a &quot;Pretor&quot;, appointed by the Prefect. The institution headed by the Pretor was called &quot;Pretură&quot;. Currently, this office has survived only in the Republic of Moldova, where praetors are the heads of Chişinău&#x27;s five sectors.

In Italy, until 1998, Praetor was a magistrate with particular duty (especially in civil branch).

The Italian-speaking Swiss canton of Ticino has &quot;pretori&quot; (singular: &quot;pretore&quot;) which is the chief magistrate (civil branch) of a district, heading a &quot;pretura&quot; (a court). The &quot;pretori&quot; are appointed by the canton&#x27;s parliament.

<text>Avonlea (; &quot;av-on-LEE&quot;) is a fictional community located on Prince Edward Island, Canada, and is the setting of Lucy Maud Montgomery&#x27;s 1908 novel &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot;, following the adventures of Anne Shirley, as well as its sequels, and the television series &quot;Road to Avonlea&quot;.

Montgomery drew much of her inspiration for Avonlea from her childhood experiences in the late 19th century farming communities surrounding Cavendish, New Glasgow, New London, Hunter River, and Park Corner on Prince Edward Island.

In Montgomery&#x27;s works, Avonlea is located on the northern shore of Prince Edward Island on a small peninsula. Its primary industries are farming and lobster fishing. Neighbouring fictional communities include Carmody, White Sands (not to be confused with the modern White Sands, which is on the southern edge of Prince Edward Island), Grafton, Bright River, Newbridge, and Spencervale.

<doc id="65753" wikidata="Q853949" url="?curid=65753" title="Rational expectations">
<text>Rational expectations is an economic theory that seeks to infer the macroeconomic consequences of individuals&#x27; decisions based on all available knowledge. It assumes that individuals&#x27; actions are based on the best available economic theory and information.

== History ==
The concept of rational expectations was first introduced by John F. Muth in his paper &quot;Rational Expectations and the Theory of Price Movements&quot; published in 1961. Robert Lucas and Thomas Sargent further developed the theory in the 1970s and 1980s which became seminal works on the topic and were widely used in microeconomics.
Significant Findings

Muth’s work introduces the concept of rational expectations and discusses its implications for economic theory. He argues that individuals are rational and use all available information to make unbiased, informed predictions about the future. This means that individuals do not make systematic errors in their predictions and that their predictions are not biased by past errors. Muth’s paper also discusses the implication of rational expectations for economic theory. One key implication is that government policies, such as changes in monetary or fiscal policy may not be as effective if individuals’ expectations are not considered. For example, if individuals expect inflation to increase, they may anticipate that the central bank will raise interest rates to combat inflation, which could lead to higher borrowing costs and slower economic growth. Similarly, if individuals expect a recession, they may reduce their spending and investment, which could lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Lucas’ paper “Expectations and the Neutrality of Money” expands on Muth&#x27;s work and sheds light on the relationship between rational expectations and the monetary policy. The paper argues that when individuals hold rational expectations, changes in the money supply do not have real effects on the economy and the neutrality of money holds. Lucas presents a theoretical model that incorporates rational expectations into an analysis of the effects of changes in the money supply. The model suggests that individuals adjust their expectations in response to changes in the money supply, which eliminates the effect on real variables such as output and employment. He argues that a stable monetary policy that is consistent with individuals&#x27; rational expectations will be more effective in promoting economic stability than attempts to manipulate the money supply.

In 1973, Thomas J Sargent published the article “Rational Expectations, the Real Rate of Interest, and the Natural Rate of Unemployment” which was an important contribution to the development and application of the concept of rational expectations in economic theory and policy. By assuming individuals are forward-looking and rational, Sargent argues that rational expectations can help explain fluctuations in key economic variables such as the real interest rate and the natural rate of employment. He also suggests that the concept of the natural rate of unemployment can be used to help policymakers set macroeconomic policy. This concept suggests that there is a trade-off between unemployment and inflation in the short run, but in the long run, the economy will return to the natural rate of unemployment, which is determined by structural factors such as the skills of the labour force and the efficiency of the labour market. Sargent argues that policymakers should take this concept into account when setting macroeconomic policy, as policies that try to push unemployment below the natural rate will only lead to higher inflation in the long run.

==Theory==
The key idea of rational expectations is that individuals make decisions based on all available information, including their own expectations about future events. This implies that individuals are rational and use all available information to make decisions. Another important idea is that individuals adjust their expectations in response to new information. In this way, individuals are assumed to be forward-looking and able to adapt to changing circumstances. They will learn from past trends and experiences to make their best guess of the future.

It is assumed that an individual&#x27;s predicted outcome do not differ systematically from the market equilibrium given that they do not make systematic errors when predicting the future. 

In an economic model, this is typically modelled by assuming that the expected value of a variable is equal to the expected value predicted by the model. For example, suppose that &quot;P&quot; is the equilibrium price in a simple market, determined by supply and demand. The theory of rational expectations implies that the actual price will only deviate from the expectation if there is an &#x27;information shock&#x27; caused by information unforeseeable at the time expectations were formed. In other words, &quot;ex ante&quot; the price is anticipated to equal its rational expectation:

::formula_1
::formula_2

where formula_3 is the rational expectation and formula_4 is the random error term, which has an expected value of zero, and is independent of formula_3.

== Mathematical derivation ==
If rational expectations are applied to the Phillips curve analysis, the distinction between long and short term will be completely negated, that is, there is no Phillips curve, and there is no substitute relationship between inflation rate and unemployment rate that can be utilized.

The mathematical derivation is as follows:

Rational expectation is consistent with objective mathematical expectation: 

formula_6

Mathematical derivation (1)

Assuming that the actual process is known, the rate of inflation depends on previous monetary changes and changes in short-term variables such as X (for example, oil prices):

(1) formula_7

(2) formula_8

(3) formula_9 , formula_10

(4) formula_11

(5) formula_12

Thus, even in the short run, there is no substitute relationship between inflation and unemployment. Random shocks, which are completely unpredictable, are the only reason why the unemployment rate deviates from the natural rate.

Mathematical derivation (2)

Even if the actual rate of inflation is dependent on current monetary changes, the public can make rational expectations as long as they know how monetary policy is being decided:

(1) formula_13

(2) formula_14

(3) formula_15

(4) formula_16

(5) formula_17

The conclusion is essentially the same: random shocks that are completely unpredictable are the only thing that can cause the unemployment rate to deviate from the natural rate.

==Implications==

Rational expectations theories were developed in response to perceived flaws in theories based on adaptive expectations. Under adaptive expectations, expectations of the future value of an economic variable are based on past values. For example, it assumes that individuals predict inflation by looking at historical inflation data. Under adaptive expectations, if the economy suffers from a prolonged period of rising inflation, people are assumed to always underestimate inflation. Many economists suggested that it was an unrealistic and irrational assumption, as they believe that rational individuals will learn from past experiences and trends and adjust their predictions accordingly.

The rational expectations hypothesis has been used to support conclusions about economic policymaking. An example is the policy ineffectiveness proposition developed by Thomas Sargent and Neil Wallace. If the Federal Reserve attempts to lower unemployment through expansionary monetary policy, economic agents will anticipate the effects of the change of policy and raise their expectations of future inflation accordingly. This will counteract the expansionary effect of the increased money supply, suggesting that the government can only increase the inflation rate but not employment.

If agents do not form rational expectations or if prices are not completely flexible, discretional and completely anticipated, economic policy actions can trigger real changes.

== Criticism ==
While the rational expectations theory has been widely influential in macroeconomic analysis, it has also been subject to criticism:

Unrealistic assumptions: The theory implies that individuals are in a fixed point, where their expectations about aggregate economic variables on average are correct. This is unlikely to be the case, due to limited information available and human error.

Limited empirical support: While there is some evidence that individuals do incorporate expectations into their decision-making, it is unclear whether they do so in the way predicted by the rational expectations theory.

Misspecification of models: The rational expectations theory assumes that individuals have a common understanding of the model used to make predictions. However, if the model is misspecified, this can lead to incorrect predictions.

Inability to explain certain phenomena: The theory is also criticized for its inability to explain certain phenomena, such as &#x27;irrational&#x27; bubbles and crashes in financial markets.

Lack of attention to distributional effects: Critics argue that the rational expectations theory focuses too much on aggregate outcomes and does not pay enough attention to the distributional effects of economic policies.

<doc id="65755" wikidata="Q129628" url="?curid=65755" title="Yeti">
<text>The Yeti () is an ape-like creature purported to inhabit the Himalayan mountain range in Asia. In Western popular culture, the creature is commonly referred to as the Abominable Snowman. Many dubious articles have been offered in an attempt to prove the existence of the Yeti, including anecdotal visual sightings, disputed video recordings, photographs, and plaster casts of large footprints. Some of these are speculated or known to be hoaxes.

Folklorists trace the origin of the Yeti to a combination of factors, including Sherpa folklore and misidentified fauna such as bear or yak. The Yeti is commonly compared to Bigfoot of North America, as the two subjects often have similar physical descriptions.

==Description==
The Yeti is often described as being a large, bipedal ape-like creature that is covered with brown, grey, or white hair, and it is sometimes depicted as having large, sharp teeth.

==Etymology and alternative names==
The word &quot;Yeti&quot; is derived from , a compound of the words &quot;rocky&quot;, &quot;rocky place&quot; and () &quot;bear&quot;. Pranavananda states that the words &quot;ti&quot;, &quot;te&quot; and &quot;teh&quot; are derived from the spoken word &#x27;tre&#x27; (spelled &quot;dred&quot;), Tibetan for bear, with the &#x27;r&#x27; so softly pronounced as to be almost inaudible, thus making it &quot;te&quot; or &quot;teh&quot;.

Tibetan lore describes three main varieties of Yetis—the Nyalmo, which has black fur and is the largest and fiercest, standing around fifteen feet tall; the Chuti, which stands around eight feet tall and lives above sea level; and the Rang Shim Bombo, which has reddish-brown fur and is only tall.

Other terms used by Himalayan peoples do not translate exactly the same, but refer to legendary and indigenous wildlife:

* Michê () translates as &quot;man-bear&quot;.
* Dzu-teh – &#x27;dzu&#x27; translates as &quot;cattle&quot; and the full meaning translates as &quot;cattle bear&quot;, referring to the Himalayan brown bear.
* Migoi or Mi-go () translates as &quot;wild man&quot;.
* Bun Manchi – Nepali for &quot;jungle man&quot; that is used outside Sherpa communities where yeti is the common name.
* Mirka – Another name for &quot;wild-man&quot;. Local legend holds that &quot;anyone who sees one dies or is killed&quot;. The latter is taken from a written statement by Frank Smythe&#x27;s sherpas in 1937.
* Kang Admi – &quot;Snow Man&quot;.
* Jungli Admi – &quot;Wild Man&quot;.
* Xueren (Chinese: 雪人) - &quot;Snow Man&quot;

===Other names and locations===
In Russian folklore, the &quot;Chuchuna&quot; is an entity said to dwell in Siberia. It has been described as six to seven feet tall and covered with dark hair. According to the native accounts from the nomadic Yakut and Tungus tribes, it is a well built, Neanderthal-like man wearing pelts and bearing a white patch of fur on its forearms. It is said to occasionally consume human flesh, unlike their close cousins, the &quot;Almastis&quot;. Some witnesses reported seeing a tail on the creature&#x27;s corpse. It is described as being roughly six to seven feet tall. There are additional tales of large, reclusive, bipedal creatures worldwide, notably including both &quot;Bigfoot&quot; and the &quot;Abominable Snowman.&quot;

====The Abominable Snowman====
The name &quot;Abominable Snowman&quot; was coined in 1921, the year Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Howard-Bury led the 1921 British Mount Everest reconnaissance expedition, which he chronicled in &quot;Mount Everest The Reconnaissance, 1921&quot;. In the book, Howard-Bury includes an account of crossing the Lhagpa La at where he found footprints that he believed &quot;were probably caused by a large &#x27;loping&#x27; grey wolf, which in the soft snow formed double tracks rather like those of a bare-footed man&quot;. He adds that his Sherpa guides &quot;at once volunteered that the tracks must be that of &#x27;The Wild Man of the Snows&#x27;, to which they gave the name &#x27;metoh-kangmi. &quot;Metoh&quot; translates as &quot;man-bear&quot; and &quot;kang-mi&quot; translates as &quot;snowman&quot;.

Confusion exists between Howard-Bury&#x27;s recitation of the term &quot;metoh-kangmi&quot; and the term used in Bill Tilman&#x27;s book &quot;Mount Everest, 1938&quot; where Tilman had used the words &quot;metch&quot;, which does not exist in the Tibetan language, and &quot;kangmi&quot; when relating the coining of the term &quot;Abominable Snowman&quot;. Further evidence of &quot;metch&quot; being a misnomer is provided by Tibetan language authority Professor David Snellgrove from the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London (ca. 1956), who dismissed the word &quot;metch&quot; as impossible, because the consonants &quot;t-c-h&quot; cannot be conjoined in the Tibetan language. Documentation suggests that the term &quot;metch-kangmi&quot; is derived from one source (from the year 1921). It has been suggested that &quot;metch&quot; is simply a misspelling of &quot;metoh&quot;.

The use of &quot;Abominable Snowman&quot; began when Henry Newman, a longtime contributor to &quot;The Statesman&quot; in Calcutta, writing under the pen name &quot;Kim&quot;, interviewed the porters of the &quot;Everest Reconnaissance expedition&quot; on their return to Darjeeling. Newman mistranslated the word &quot;metoh&quot; as &quot;filthy&quot;, substituting the term &quot;abominable&quot;, perhaps out of artistic licence. As author Bill Tilman recounts, &quot;[Newman] wrote long after in a letter to &quot;The Times&quot;: The whole story seemed such a joyous creation I sent it to one or two newspapers&quot;.

==History and sightings==
===Pre-19th century===
According to H. Siiger, the Yeti was a part of the pre-Buddhist beliefs of several Himalayan people. He was told that the Lepcha people worshipped a &quot;Glacier Being&quot; as a God of the Hunt. He also reported that followers of the Bön religion once believed the blood of the &quot;mi rgod&quot; or &quot;wild man&quot; had use in certain spiritual ceremonies. The being was depicted as an ape-like creature who carries a large stone as a weapon and makes a whistling swoosh sound.

Yeti was adopted into Tibetan Buddhism, where it is considered a nonhuman animal (&quot;tiragyoni&quot;) that is nonetheless human enough to sometimes be able to follow Dharma. Several stories feature Yetis becoming helpers and disciples to religious figures. In Tibet, images of Yetis are paraded and occasionally worshipped as guardians against evil spirits. However, because Yetis sometimes act as enforcers of Dharma, hearing or seeing one is often considered a bad omen, for which the witness must accumulate merit.

===19th century===
In 1832, James Prinsep&#x27;s &quot;Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal&quot; published trekker B. H. Hodgson&#x27;s account of his experiences in northern Nepal. His local guides spotted a tall bipedal creature covered with long dark hair, which seemed to flee in fear. Hodgson concluded it was an orangutan.

An early record of reported footprints appeared in 1899 in Laurence Waddell&#x27;s &quot;Among the Himalayas&quot;. Waddell reported his guide&#x27;s description of a large apelike creature that left the prints, which Waddell thought were made by a bear. Waddell heard stories of bipedal, apelike creatures but wrote that &quot;none, however, of the many Tibetans I have interrogated on this subject could ever give me an authentic case. On the most superficial investigation, it always resolved into something that somebody heard tell of.&quot;

===20th century===
The frequency of reports increased during the early 20th century when Westerners began making determined attempts to scale the many mountains in the area and occasionally reported seeing odd creatures or strange tracks.

In 1925, N. A. Tombazi, a photographer and member of the Royal Geographical Society, writes that he saw a creature at about near Zemu Glacier. Tombazi later wrote that he observed the creature from about , for about a minute. &quot;Unquestionably, the figure in outline was exactly like a human being, walking upright and stopping occasionally to pull at some dwarf rhododendron bushes. It showed up dark against the snow, and as far as I could make out, wore no clothes.&quot; About two hours later, Tombazi and his companions descended the mountain and saw the creature&#x27;s prints, described as &quot;similar in shape to those of a man, but only long by wide... The prints were undoubtedly those of a biped.&quot;

During the autumn of 1937, John Hunt and Pasang Sherpa (later Pasang Dawa Lama) encountered footprints on the approaches to and at the Zemu Gap above the Zemu Glacier that were thought to belong to a pair of Yetis.

In June 1944, C.R. Cooke, his wife Maragaret, and a group of porters encountered very large bipedal prints in soft mud at just below the Singalila Ridge, which the porters said were of the &quot;Jungli Admi&quot; (wild man). The creature had come up through bushes on the steep hillside from Nepal and crossed the track before continuing up to the ridge. Cooke wrote &quot;We laid Maragaret&#x27;s sunglasses beside each print to indicate its size and took photographs. These prints were strange and larger than any normal human foot, heel to toe, with the great toe set back to one side, a first toe, also large, and three little toes closely bunched together.&quot;

Peter Byrne reported finding a yeti footprint in 1948, in northern Sikkim, India near the Zemu Glacier, while on holiday from a Royal Air Force assignment in India.

Western interest in the Yeti peaked dramatically in the 1950s. While attempting to scale Mount Everest in 1951, Eric Shipton took photographs of a number of large prints in the snow, at about above sea level. Shipton took three photographs, one depicting the tracks, and other two of one particular print which was size compared by a pickaxe, and boot. The footprints had distinct two large toes, and three smaller digits close together. These photos have been subject to intense scrutiny and debate. Some argue they are the best evidence of Yeti&#x27;s existence, while others contend the prints are those of a mundane creature that have been distorted by the melting snow. Jeffrey Meldrum examined a reconstructed form of the print in 2008, noting that one of the large toes was the result of Macrodactyly. He also stated the alignment of the toes matched that of a great ape, and the Yeti would likely spend more time in the subtropical region of the Himalayas. Meldrum stated it was hard to conclusively say the prints were genuine since Shipton only took two photos of a single track. 

In 1953, Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay reported seeing large footprints while scaling Mount Everest. Hillary would later discount Yeti reports as unreliable. In his first autobiography Tenzing said that he believed the Yeti was a large ape, and although he had never seen it himself his father had seen one twice, but in his second autobiography he said he had become much more sceptical about its existence.

During the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; Snowman Expedition of 1954, the mountaineering leader John Angelo Jackson made the first trek from Everest to Kanchenjunga in the course of which he photographed symbolic paintings of the Yeti at Tengboche gompa. Jackson tracked and photographed many footprints in the snow, most of which were identifiable. However, there were many large footprints which could not be identified. These flattened footprint-like indentations were attributed to erosion and subsequent widening of the original footprint by wind and particles.

On 19 March 1954, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; printed an article which described expedition teams obtaining hair specimens from what was alleged to be a Yeti scalp found in the Pangboche monastery. The hairs were black to dark brown in colour in dim light, and fox red in sunlight. The hair was analysed by Professor Frederic Wood Jones, an expert in human and comparative anatomy. During the study, the hairs were bleached, cut into sections and analysed microscopically. The research consisted of taking microphotographs of the hairs and comparing them with hairs from known animals such as bears and orangutans. Jones concluded that the hairs were not actually from a scalp. He contended that while some animals do have a ridge of hair extending from the pate to the back, no animals have a ridge (as in the Pangboche scalp) running from the base of the forehead across the pate and ending at the nape of the neck. Jones was unable to pinpoint exactly the animal from which the Pangboche hairs were taken. He was, however, convinced that the hairs were not from a bear or anthropoid ape, but instead from the shoulder of a coarse-haired hoofed animal.

Sławomir Rawicz claimed in his book &quot;The Long Walk&quot;, published in 1956, that as he and some others were crossing the Himalayas in the winter of 1940, their path was blocked for hours by two bipedal animals that were doing seemingly nothing but shuffling around in the snow.

Beginning in 1957, the Texas oil businessman and adventurer Tom Slick led an expedition to the Nepal Himalayas to investigate Yeti reports, with the anthropologist prof. Carleton S. Coon as one of its members. In 1959, supposed Yeti feces were collected by one of Slick&#x27;s expeditions; fecal analysis found a parasite which could not be classified. The United States government thought that finding the Yeti was likely enough to create three rules for American expeditions searching for it: obtain a Nepalese permit, do not harm the Yeti except in self-defense, and let the Nepalese government approve any news reporting on the animal&#x27;s discovery. In 1959, actor James Stewart, while visiting India, reportedly smuggled the so-called Pangboche Hand, by concealing it in his luggage when he flew from India to London.

In 1960, Sir Edmund Hillary mounted the 1960–61 Silver Hut expedition to the Himalayas, which was to collect and analyse physical evidence of the Yeti. Hillary borrowed a supposed Yeti scalp from the Khumjung monastery then himself and Khumjo Chumbi (the village headman), brought the scalp back to London where a small sample was cut off for testing. Marca Burns made a detailed examination of the sample of skin and hair from the margin of the alleged Yeti scalp and compared it with similar samples from the serow, blue bear and black bear. Burns concluded the sample &quot;was probably made from the skin of an animal closely resembling the sampled specimen of Serow, but definitely not identical with it: possibly a local variety or race of the same species, or a different but closely related species.&quot;

Up to the 1960s, belief in the yeti was relatively common in Bhutan and in 1966 a Bhutanese stamp was made to honour the creature. However, in the 21st century, belief in the being has declined.

In 1970, British mountaineer Don Whillans claimed to have witnessed a creature when scaling Annapurna. He reported that he once saw it moving on all fours.

In 1983, Himalayan conservationist Daniel C. Taylor and Himalayan natural historian Robert L. Fleming Jr. led a yeti expedition into Nepal&#x27;s Barun Valley (suggested by discovery in the Barun in 1972 of footprints alleged to be yeti by Cronin &amp; McNeely). The Taylor-Fleming expedition also discovered similar yeti-like footprints (hominoid appearing with both a hallux and bipedal gait), intriguing large nests in trees, and vivid reports from local villagers of two bears, &quot;rukh bhalu&quot; (&#x27;tree bear&#x27;, small, reclusive, weighing about ) and &quot;bhui bhalu&quot; (&#x27;ground bear&#x27;, aggressive, weighing up to ). Further interviews across Nepal gave evidence of local belief in two different bears. Skulls were collected, these were compared to known skulls at the Smithsonian Institution, American Museum of Natural History, and British Museum, and confirmed identification of a single species, the Asiatic black bear, showing no morphological difference between &#x27;tree bear&#x27; and &#x27;ground bear.&#x27; (This despite an intriguing skull in the British Museum of a &#x27;tree bear&#x27; collected in 1869 by Oldham and discussed in the &quot;Annals of the Royal Zoological Society&quot;.)

===21st century===
In 2004, Henry Gee, editor of the journal &quot;Nature&quot;, mentioned the Yeti as an example of folk belief deserving further study, writing, &quot;The discovery that &quot;Homo floresiensis&quot; survived until so very recently, in geological terms, makes it more likely that stories of other mythical, human-like creatures such as Yetis are founded on grains of truth.&quot;

In early December 2007, American television presenter Joshua Gates and his team (Destination Truth) reported finding a series of footprints in the Everest region of Nepal resembling descriptions of Yeti. Each of the footprints measured in length with five toes that measured a total of across. Casts were made of the prints for further research. The footprints were examined by Jeffrey Meldrum of Idaho State University, who believed them to be too morphologically accurate to be fake or man-made, before changing his mind after making further investigations. Later in 2009, in a TV show, Gates presented hair samples with a forensic analyst concluding that the hair contained an unknown DNA sequence.

On 25 July 2008, the BBC reported that hairs collected in the remote Garo Hills area of North-East India by Dipu Marak had been analysed at Oxford Brookes University in the UK by primatologist Anna Nekaris and microscopy expert Jon Wells. These initial tests were inconclusive, and ape conservation expert Ian Redmond told the BBC that there was similarity between the cuticle pattern of these hairs and specimens collected by Edmund Hillary during Himalayan expeditions in the 1950s and donated to the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, and announced planned DNA analysis. This analysis has since revealed that the hair came from the Himalayan goral.

A group of Chinese scientists and explorers in 2010 proposed to renew searches in the Shennongjia Forestry District of Hubei province, which was the site of expeditions in the 1970s and 1980s.

At a 2011 conference in Russia, participating scientists and enthusiasts declared having &quot;95% evidence&quot; of the Yeti&#x27;s existence. However, this claim was disputed later; American anthropologist and anatomist Jeffrey Meldrum, who was present during the Russian expedition, claimed the &quot;evidence&quot; found was simply an attempt by local officials to drum up publicity.

A yeti was reportedly captured in Russia in December 2011. Initially the story claimed that a hunter reported having seen a bear-like creature trying to kill one of his sheep but, after he fired his gun, the creature ran into a forest on two legs. The story then claimed that border patrol soldiers captured a hairy two-legged female creature similar to a gorilla that ate meat and vegetation. This was later revealed as a hoax or possibly a publicity stunt for charity.

In April 2019, an Indian army mountaineering expedition team claimed to have spotted mysterious &#x27;Yeti&#x27; footprints, measuring , near the Makalu base camp.

==Proposed explanations==
The misidentification of Himalayan wildlife has been proposed as an explanation for some Yeti sightings, including the &quot;chu-teh&quot;, a langur monkey living at lower altitudes; the Tibetan blue bear; or the Himalayan brown bear or &quot;dzu-teh&quot;, also known as the Himalayan red bear.

Similarly, it is possible that sightings have been deliberate hoaxes. James Randi notes that convincing costumes of gorillas or other apes have been used in films, which are more convincing than any representations of the Yeti provided by believers. Randi also argues that there would need to be &quot;many&quot; creatures in order to maintain the gene pool, and given the proposed size of the Yeti, it is hard to imagine that they have been so elusive if they are real.

A well publicised expedition to Bhutan initially reported that a hair sample had been obtained, which by DNA analysis by Professor Bryan Sykes could not be matched to any known animal. Analysis completed after the media release, however, clearly showed the samples were from a brown bear (&quot;Ursus arctos&quot;) and an Asiatic black bear (&quot;Ursus thibetanus&quot;).

In 1986, South Tyrolean mountaineer Reinhold Messner claimed in his autobiography &quot;My Quest for the Yeti&quot; that the Yeti is actually the endangered Himalayan brown bear, &quot;Ursus arctos isabellinus&quot;, or Tibetan blue bear, &quot;U. a. pruinosus&quot;, which can walk both upright or on all fours.

The 1983 Barun Valley discoveries prompted three years of research on the &#x27;tree bear&#x27; possibility by Taylor, Fleming, John Craighead and Tirtha Shrestha. From that research, the conclusion was that the Asiatic black bear, when about two years old, spends much time in trees to avoid attack by larger male bears on the ground (&#x27;ground bears&#x27;). During this tree period (that may last two years), young bears train their inner claw outward, allowing an opposable grip. The imprint in the snow of a hind paw coming over the front paw that appears to have a hallux, especially when the bear is going slightly uphill so the hind pawprint extends the overprint backward, makes a hominid-appearing track, both in that it is elongated like a human foot, but with a &quot;thumb&quot;, and in that a four-footed animal&#x27;s gait now appears bipedal. This &quot;yeti discovery&quot;, in the words of &quot;National Geographic Magazine&quot; editor Bill Garrett, &quot;[by] on-site research sweeps away much of the &#x27;smoke and mirrors&#x27; and gives us a believable yeti&quot;.

This fieldwork in Nepal&#x27;s Barun Valley led directly to the initiation of the Makalu-Barun National Park that protected over half a million acres in 1991, and across the border with China, the Qomolangma national nature preserve in the Tibet Autonomous Region that protected over six million acres. In the words of Honorary President of the American Alpine Club, Robert H. Bates, this yeti discovery &quot;has apparently solved the mystery of the yeti, or at least part of it, and in so doing added to the world&#x27;s great wildlife preserves&quot;, so that the shy animal, and the mysteries and myths of the Himalayas that it represents, can continue to live within a protected area nearly the size of Switzerland.

In 2003, Japanese researcher and mountaineer Dr. Makoto Nebuka published the results of his twelve-year linguistic study, postulating that the word &quot;Yeti&quot; is a corruption of the word &quot;meti&quot;, a regional dialect term for a &quot;bear&quot;. Nebuka claims that ethnic Tibetans fear and worship the bear as a supernatural being. Nebuka&#x27;s claims were subject to almost immediate criticism, and he was accused of linguistic carelessness. Dr. Raj Kumar Pandey, who has researched both Yetis and mountain languages, said &quot;it is not enough to blame tales of the mysterious beast of the Himalayas on words that rhyme but mean different things.&quot;

Some speculate these reported creatures could be present-day specimens of the extinct giant ape &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot;. However, the Yeti is generally described as bipedal, and most scientists believe &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; to have been quadrupedal, and so massive that, unless it evolved specifically as a bipedal ape (like the hominids), walking upright would have been even more difficult for the now extinct primate than it is for its extant quadrupedal relative, the orangutan.

In 2013, a call was put out by scientists from the universities of Oxford and Lausanne for people claiming to have samples from these sorts of creatures. A mitochondrial DNA analysis of the 12S RNA gene was undertaken on samples of hair from an unidentified animal from Ladakh in northern India on the west of the Himalayas, and one from Bhutan. These samples were compared with those in GenBank, the international repository of gene sequences, and matched a sample from an ancient polar bear jawbone found in Svalbard, Norway that dates back to between 40,000 and 120,000 years ago. The result suggests that, barring hoaxes of planted samples or contamination, bears in these regions may have been taken to be yeti. Professor of evolutionary genetics at the University of Cambridge, Bill Amos, doubted the samples were of polar bears in the Himalayas, but was &quot;90% convinced that there is a bear in these regions that has been mistaken for a yeti&quot;. Professor Bryan Sykes, whose team carried out the analysis of the samples at Oxford, has his own theory. He believes that the samples may have come from a hybrid species of bear produced from a mating between a brown bear and a polar bear. A research of 12S rRNA published in 2015 revealed that the hair samples collected are most likely those of brown bears. In 2017, a new analysis compared mtDNA sequences of bears from the region with DNA extracted from hair and other samples claimed to have come from yeti. It included hair thought to be from the same preserved specimen as the anomalous Sykes sample, and showed it to have been a Himalayan brown bear, while other purported yeti samples were actually from the Tibetan blue bear, Asiatic black bear and a domestic dog.

In 2017, Daniel C. Taylor published a comprehensive analysis of the century-long Yeti literature, giving added evidence to the (&quot;Ursus thibetanus&quot;) explanation, building on the initial Barun Valley discoveries. This book gave a meticulous explanation for the iconic Yeti footprint photographed by Eric Shipton in 1950, the 1972 Cronin-McNeely print, as well all other unexplained Yeti footprints. To complete this explanation, Taylor also located a never-before published photograph in the archives of the Royal Geographical Society, taken in 1950 by Eric Shipton, that included scratches that are clearly bear nail marks.

<text>The Western is a genre of fiction typically set in the American frontier (commonly referred to as the &quot;Old West&quot; or the &quot;Wild West&quot;) between the California Gold Rush of 1849 and the closing of the frontier in 1890, and commonly associated with folk tales of the Western United States, particularly the Southwestern United States, as well as Northern Mexico and Western Canada.

The frontier is depicted in Western media as a sparsely populated hostile region patrolled by cowboys, outlaws, sheriffs, and numerous other stock gunslinger characters. Western narratives often concern the gradual attempts to tame the crime-ridden American West using wider themes of justice, freedom, rugged individualism, manifest destiny, and the national history and identity of the United States. Native American populations were often portrayed as averse foes or savages.

Originating in vaquero heritage and Western fiction, the genre popularized the Western lifestyle, country-Western music, and Western wear globally. Throughout the history of the genre, it has seen popular revivals and been incorporated into various subgenres.

==Characteristics==

===Stories and characters===
The classic Western is a morality drama, presenting the conflict between wilderness and civilization. Stories commonly center on the life of a male drifter, cowboy, or gunslinger who rides a horse and is armed with a revolver or rifle. The male characters typically wear broad-brimmed and high-crowned Stetson hats, neckerchief bandannas, vests, and cowboy boots with spurs. While many wear conventional shirts and trousers, alternatives include buckskins and dusters.

Women are generally cast in secondary roles as love interests for the male lead; or in supporting roles as saloon girls, prostitutes or as the wives of pioneers and settlers. The wife character often provides a measure of comic relief. Other recurring characters include Native Americans of various tribes described as Indians or Red Indians, African Americans, Chinese Americans, Spaniards, Mexicans, law enforcement officers, bounty hunters, outlaws, bartenders, merchants, gamblers, soldiers (especially mounted cavalry), and settlers (farmers, ranchers, and townsfolk).

The ambience is usually punctuated with a Western music score, including American folk music and Spanish/Mexican folk music such as country, Native American music, New Mexico music, and rancheras.

===Locations===
Westerns often stress the harshness of the wilderness and frequently set the action in an arid, desolate landscape of deserts and mountains. Often, the vast landscape plays an important role, presenting a &quot;mythic vision of the plains and deserts of the American West&quot;. Specific settings include ranches, small frontier towns, saloons, railways, wilderness, and isolated military forts of the Wild West. Many Westerns use a stock plot of depicting a crime, then showing the pursuit of the wrongdoer, ending in revenge and retribution, which is often dispensed through a shootout or quick draw duel.

===Themes===
The Western genre sometimes portrays the conquest of the wilderness and the subordination of nature in the name of civilization or the confiscation of the territorial rights of the original, Native American, inhabitants of the frontier. The Western depicts a society organized around codes of honor and personal, direct or private justice–&quot;frontier justice&quot;–dispensed by gunfights. These honor codes are often played out through depictions of feuds or individuals seeking personal revenge or against someone who has wronged them (e.g., &quot;True Grit&quot; has revenge and retribution as its main themes). This Western depiction of personal justice contrasts sharply with justice systems organized around rationalistic, abstract law that exist in cities, in which social order is maintained predominantly through relatively impersonal institutions such as courtrooms. The popular perception of the Western is a story that centers on the life of a seminomadic wanderer, usually a cowboy or a gunfighter. A showdown or duel at high noon featuring two or more gunfighters is a stereotypical scene in the popular conception of Westerns.

In some ways, such protagonists may be considered the literary descendants of the knights-errant, who stood at the center of earlier extensive genres such as the Arthurian romances. Like the cowboy or gunfighter of the Western, the knight-errant of the earlier European tales and poetry was wandering from place to place on his horse, fighting villains of various kinds, and bound to no fixed social structures, but only to his own innate code of honor. Like knights-errant, the heroes of Westerns frequently rescue damsels in distress. Similarly, the wandering protagonists of Westerns share many characteristics with the &quot;ronin&quot; in modern Japanese culture.

The Western typically takes these elements and uses them to tell simple morality tales, although some notable examples (e.g. the later Westerns of John Ford or Clint Eastwood&#x27;s &quot;Unforgiven&quot;, about an old contract killer) are more morally ambiguous. Westerns often stress the harshness and isolation of the wilderness, and frequently set the action in an arid, desolate landscape. Western films generally have specific settings, such as isolated ranches, Native American villages, or small frontier towns with a saloon. Oftentimes, these settings appear deserted and without much structure. Apart from the wilderness, the saloon usually emphasizes that this is the Wild West; it is the place to go for music (raucous piano playing), women (often prostitutes), gambling (draw poker or five-card stud), drinking (beer, whiskey, or tequila if set in Mexico), brawling, and shooting. In some Westerns, where civilization has arrived, the town has a church, a general store, a bank, and a school; in others, where frontier rules still hold sway, it is, as Sergio Leone said, &quot;where life has no value&quot;.

===Plots===
Author and screenwriter Frank Gruber identified seven basic plots for Westerns:
* Union Pacific story: The plot concerns construction of a railroad, a telegraph line, or some other type of modern technology on the wild frontier. Wagon-train stories fall into this category.
* Ranch story: Ranchers protecting their family ranch from rustlers or large landowners attempting to force out the proper owners.
* Empire story: The plot involves building a ranch empire or an oil empire from scratch, a classic rags-to-riches plot, often involving conflict over resources such as water or minerals.
* Revenge story: The plot often involves an elaborate chase and pursuit by a wronged individual, but it may also include elements of the classic mystery story.
* Cavalry and Indian story: The plot revolves around taming the wilderness for White settlers or fighting Native Americans.
* Outlaw story: The outlaw gangs dominate the action.
* Marshal story: The lawman and his challenges drive the plot.

Gruber noted that good writers use dialog and plot development to expand these basic plots into believable stories.

==Media==

===Film===

The American Film Institute defines Western films as those &quot;set in the American West that [embody] the spirit, the struggle, and the demise of the new frontier&quot;. Originally, these films were called &quot;Wild West dramas&quot;, a reference to Wild West shows like Buffalo Bill Cody&#x27;s. The term &quot;Western&quot;, used to describe a narrative film genre, appears to have originated with a July 1912 article in &quot;Motion Picture World&quot; magazine.

Most of the characteristics of Western films were part of 19th-century popular Western fiction, and were firmly in place before film became a popular art form. Western films commonly feature protagonists such as cowboys, gunslingers, and bounty hunters, who are often depicted as seminomadic wanderers who wear Stetson hats, bandannas, spurs, and buckskins, use revolvers or rifles as everyday tools of survival and as a means to settle disputes using frontier justice. Protagonists ride between dusty towns and cattle ranches on their trusty steeds.
The first films that belong to the Western genre are a series of short single reel silents made in 1894 by Edison Studios at their Black Maria studio in West Orange, New Jersey. These featured veterans of &quot;Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West&quot; show exhibiting skills acquired by living in the Old West – they included Annie Oakley (shooting) and members of the Sioux (dancing).

The earliest known Western narrative film is the British short &quot;Kidnapping by Indians&quot;, made by Mitchell and Kenyon in Blackburn, England, in 1899. &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; (1903, based on the earlier British film &quot;A Daring Daylight Burglary&quot;), Edwin S. Porter&#x27;s film starring Broncho Billy Anderson, is often erroneously cited as the first Western, though George N. Fenin and William K. Everson point out (as mentioned above) that the &quot;Edison company had played with Western material for several years prior to &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot;&quot;. Nonetheless, they concur that Porter&#x27;s film &quot;set the pattern—of crime, pursuit, and retribution—for the Western film as a genre&quot;. The film&#x27;s popularity opened the door for Anderson to become the screen&#x27;s first Western star; he made several hundred Western film shorts. So popular was the genre that he soon faced competition from Tom Mix and William S. Hart.

Western films were enormously popular in the silent film era (1894–1927). With the advent of sound in 1927–1928, the major Hollywood studios rapidly abandoned Westerns, leaving the genre to smaller studios and producers. These smaller organizations churned out countless low-budget features and serials in the 1930s. An exception was The Big Trail, a 1930 American pre-Code Western early widescreen film shot on location across the American West starring 23-year-old John Wayne in his first leading role and directed by Raoul Walsh. The epic film noted for its authenticity was a financial failure due to Depression era theatres not willing to invest in widescreen technology. By the late 1930s, the Western film was widely regarded as a pulp genre in Hollywood, but its popularity was dramatically revived in 1939 by major studio productions such as &quot;Dodge City&quot; starring Errol Flynn, &quot;Jesse James&quot; with Tyrone Power, &quot;Union Pacific&quot; with Joel McCrea, &quot;Destry Rides Again&quot; featuring James Stewart and Marlene Dietrich, and especially John Ford&#x27;s landmark Western adventure &quot;Stagecoach &quot; starring John Wayne, which became one of the biggest hits of the year. Released through United Artists, &quot;Stagecoach&quot; made John Wayne a mainstream screen star in the wake of a decade of headlining B Westerns. Wayne had been introduced to the screen 10 years earlier as the leading man in director Raoul Walsh&#x27;s spectacular widescreen &quot;The Big Trail&quot;, which failed at the box office in spite of being shot on location across the American West, including the Grand Canyon, Yosemite, and the giant redwoods, due in part to exhibitors&#x27; inability to switch over to widescreen during the Great Depression. After renewed commercial successes in the late 1930s, the popularity of Westerns continued to rise until its peak in the 1950s, when the number of Western films produced outnumbered all other genres combined.

The period from 1940 to 1960 has been called the &quot;Golden Age of the Western&quot;. It is epitomized by the work of several prominent directors including Robert Aldrich, Budd Boetticher, Delmer Daves, John Ford, and others. Some of the popular films during this era include &quot;Apache&quot; (1954), &quot;Broken Arrow&quot; (1950), and &quot;My Darling Clementine&quot; (1946).

The changing popularity of the Western genre has influenced worldwide pop culture over time. During the 1960s and 1970s, Spaghetti Westerns from Italy became popular worldwide; this was due to the success of Sergio Leone&#x27;s storytelling method. 
After having been previously pronounced dead, a resurgence of Westerns occurred during the 1990s with films such as &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot; (1990), &quot;Unforgiven&quot; (1992), and &quot;Geronimo&quot; (1993), as Westerns once again increased in popularity.

===Television===

When television became popular in the late 1940s and 1950s, Television Westerns quickly became an audience favorite. Beginning with rebroadcasts of existing films, a number of movie cowboys had their own TV shows. As demand for the Western increased, new stories and stars were introduced. A number of long-running TV Westerns became classics in their own right, such as: &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; (1949–1957), &quot;Death Valley Days&quot; (1952–1970), &quot;The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp&quot; (1955–1961), &quot;Cheyenne&quot; (1955–1962), &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; (1955–1975), &quot;Maverick&quot; (1957–1962), &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot; (1957–1963), &quot;Wagon Train&quot; (1957–1965), &quot;The Rifleman&quot; (1958–1963), &quot;Rawhide&quot; (1959–1966), &quot;Bonanza&quot; (1959–1973), &quot;The Virginian&quot; (1962–1971), and &quot;The Big Valley&quot; (1965–1969). &quot;The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp&quot; was the first Western television series written for adults, premiering four days before &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; on September 6, 1955.

The peak year for television Westerns was 1959, with 26 such shows airing during primetime. At least six of them were connected in some extent to Wyatt Earp: &quot;The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp&quot;, &quot;Bat Masterson&quot;, &quot;Tombstone Territory&quot;, &quot;Broken Arrow&quot;, &quot;Johnny Ringo&quot;, and &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;. Increasing costs of American television production weeded out most action half-hour series in the early 1960s, and their replacement by hour-long television shows, increasingly in color. Traditional Westerns died out in the late 1960s as a result of network changes in demographic targeting along with pressure from parental television groups. Future entries in the genre would incorporate elements from other genera, such as crime drama and mystery whodunit elements. Western shows from the 1970s included &quot;Hec Ramsey&quot;, &quot;Kung Fu&quot;, &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;, &quot;McCloud&quot;, &quot;The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams&quot;, and the short-lived but highly acclaimed &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; that originated from a miniseries with the same name. In the 1990s and 2000s, hour-long Westerns and slickly packaged made-for-TV movie Westerns were introduced, such as &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; (1989) and &quot;Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman&quot;. Also, new elements were once again added to the Western formula, such as the space Western, &quot;Firefly&quot;, created by Joss Whedon in 2002. &quot;Deadwood&quot; was a critically acclaimed Western series that aired on HBO from 2004 through 2006. &quot;Hell on Wheels&quot;, a fictionalized story of the construction of the first transcontinental railroad, aired on AMC for five seasons between 2011 and 2016. &quot;Longmire&quot; is a Western series that centered on Walt Longmire, a sheriff in fictional Absaroka County, Wyoming. Originally aired on the A&amp;E network from 2012 to 2014, it was picked up by Netflix in 2015 until the show&#x27;s conclusion in 2017.

AMC and Vince Gilligan&#x27;s critically acclaimed &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; is a much more modern take on the Western genre. Set in New Mexico from 2008 through 2013, it follows Walter White (Bryan Cranston), a chemistry teacher diagnosed with Stage III Lung Cancer who cooks and sells crystal meth to provide money for his family after he dies, while slowly growing further and further into the illicit drug market, eventually turning into a ruthless drug dealer and killer. While the show has scenes in a populated suburban neighborhood and nearby Albuquerque, much of the show takes place in the desert, where Walter often takes his RV car out into the open desert to cook his meth, and most action sequences occur in the desert, similar to old-fashioned Western movies. The clash between the Wild West and modern technology like cars and cellphones, while also focusing primarily on being a crime drama makes the show a unique spin on both genres. Walter&#x27;s reliance on the desert environment makes the Western-feel a pivotal role in the show, and would continue to be used in the spinoff series &quot;Better Call Saul&quot;.

The neo-Western drama &quot;Yellowstone&quot; was streamed from 2018–2024.

===Literature===
Western fiction is a genre of literature set in the American Old West, most commonly between 1860 and 1900. The first critically recognized Western was &quot;The Virginian&quot; (1902) by Owen Wister. Other well-known writers of Western fiction include Zane Grey, from the early 1900s, Ernest Haycox, Luke Short, and Louis L&#x27;Amour, from the mid 20th century. Many writers better known in other genres, such as Leigh Brackett, Elmore Leonard, and Larry McMurtry, have also written Western novels. The genre&#x27;s popularity peaked in the 1960s, due in part to the shuttering of many pulp magazines, the popularity of televised Westerns, and the rise of the spy novel. Readership began to drop off in the mid- to late 1970s and reached a new low in the 2000s. Most bookstores, outside of a few Western states, now only carry a small number of Western novels and short-story collections.

Literary forms that share similar themes include stories of the American frontier, the &quot;gaucho&quot; literature of Argentina, and tales of the settlement of the Australian Outback.

=== Visual arts ===
A number of visual artists focused their work on representations of the American Old West. American West-oriented art is sometimes referred to as &quot;Western Art&quot; by Americans. This relatively new category of art includes paintings, sculptures, and sometimes Native American crafts. Initially, subjects included exploration of the Western states and cowboy themes. Frederic Remington and Charles M. Russell are two artists who captured the &quot;Wild West&quot; in paintings and sculpture. After the death of Remington Richard Lorenz became the preeminent artist painting in the Western genre.

Some art museums, such as the Buffalo Bill Center of the West in Wyoming and the Autry National Center in Los Angeles, feature American Western Art.

===Anime and manga===
With anime and manga, the genre tends towards the science-fiction Western – e.g., &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; (1998 anime), &quot;Trigun&quot; (1995–2007 manga), and &quot;Outlaw Star&quot; (1996–1999 manga). Although contemporary Westerns also appear, such as &quot;Koya no Shonen Isamu&quot;, a 1971 &quot;shonen &quot;manga about a boy with a Japanese father and a Native American mother, or &quot;El Cazador de la Bruja&quot;, a 2007 anime television series set in modern-day Mexico. Part 7 of the manga series &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure&quot; is based in the American Western setting. The story follows racers in a transcontinental horse race, the &quot;Steel Ball Run&quot;. &quot;Golden Kamuy&quot; (2014–2022) shifts its setting to the fallout of the Russo-Japanese War, specifically focusing on Hokkaido and Sakhalin, and featuring the Ainu people and other local tribes instead of Native Americans, as well other recognizable Western tropes.

===Comics===
Western comics have included serious entries, (such as the classic comics of the late 1940s and early 1950s (namely &quot;Kid Colt, Outlaw&quot;, &quot;Rawhide Kid&quot;, and &quot;Red Ryder&quot;) or more modern ones as &quot;Blueberry&quot;), cartoons, and parodies (such as &quot;Cocco Bill&quot; and &quot;Lucky Luke&quot;). In the 1990s and 2000s, Western comics leaned towards the fantasy, horror and science fiction genres, usually involving supernatural monsters, or Christian iconography as in &quot;Preacher&quot;. More traditional Western comics are found throughout this period, though (e.g., &quot;Jonah Hex&quot; and &quot;Loveless&quot;).

===Video games===
Video game Westerns emerged in the 1970s. These games and drew on the imagery of a mythic West portrayed in stories, films, television shows, and other assorted Western-themed toys.

When game developers went to the imaginary West to create new experiences, they often drew consciously or unconsciously from Western stories and films. The 1971 text-based, Mainframe computer game &quot;The Oregon Trail&quot; was first game to use the West as a setting, where it tasked players to lead a party of settlers moving westward in a covered wagon from Independence, Missouri to Oregon City, Oregon. The game only grew popular in the 1980s and 1990s as an educational game. The first video game Westerns to engage the mass public arrived in arcade games focused on the gunfighter in Westerns based on depictions in television shows, films and Electro-mechanical games such as &quot;Dale Six Shooter&quot; (1950), and Sega&#x27;s &quot;Gun Fight&quot; (1970). The first of these games was Midway&#x27;s &quot;Gun Fight&quot;, an adaptation of Taito&#x27;s &quot;Western Gun&quot; (1975) which featured two players against each other in a duel set on a sparse desert landscape with a few cacti and a moving covered wagon to hide behind. Atari&#x27;s &quot;Outlaw&quot; (1976) followed which explicitly framed the shootouts between &quot;good guys&quot; and &quot;outlaws&quot; also borrowing from gunfighter themes and imagery. Early console games such as &quot;Outlaw&quot; (1978) for the Atari 2600 and &quot;Gun Fight&quot; (1978) for the Bally Astrocade were derivative of Midway&#x27;s &quot;Gun Fight&quot;. These early video games featured limited graphical capabilities, which had developers create Westerns to the most easily recognizable and popular tropes of the gunfighter shootouts.

===Radio dramas===
Western radio dramas were very popular from the 1930s to the 1960s. There were five types of Western radio dramas during this period: anthology programs, such as &quot;Empire Builders&quot; and &quot;Frontier Fighters&quot;; juvenile adventure programs such as &quot;Red Ryder&quot; and &quot;Hopalong Cassidy&quot;; legend and lore like &quot;Red Goose Indian Tales&quot; and &quot;Cowboy Tom&#x27;s Round-Up&quot;; adult Westerns like &quot;Fort Laramie&quot; and &quot;Frontier Gentleman&quot;; and soap operas such as &quot;Cactus Kate&quot;. Some popular shows include &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; (first broadcast in 1933), &quot;The Cisco Kid&quot; (first broadcast in 1942), &quot;Dr. Sixgun&quot; (first broadcast in 1954), &quot;Have Gun–Will Travel&quot; (first broadcast in 1958), and &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; (first broadcast in 1952). Many shows were done live, while others were transcribed.

===Web series===
Westerns have been showcased in short-episodic web series. Examples include &quot;League of STEAM&quot;, &quot;Red Bird&quot;, and &quot;Arkansas Traveler&quot;.

==Subgenres==
Within the larger scope of the Western genre, there are several recognized subgenres. Some subgenres, such as spaghetti Westerns, maintain standard Western settings and plots, while others take the Western theme and archetypes into different supergenres, such as neo-Westerns or space Westerns. For a time, Westerns made in countries other than the United States were often labeled by foods associated with the culture, such as spaghetti Westerns (Italy), meat pie Westerns (Australia), ramen Westerns (Asia), and masala Westerns (India).

==Influence on other genres==
Being period drama pieces, both the Western and samurai genre influenced each other in style and themes throughout the years. &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; was a remake of Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s film &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;, and &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot; was a remake of Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Yojimbo&quot;, which itself was inspired by &quot;Red Harvest&quot;, an American detective novel by Dashiell Hammett. Kurosawa was influenced by American Westerns and was a fan of the genre, most especially John Ford.

Despite the Cold War, the Western was a strong influence on Eastern Bloc cinema, which had its own take on the genre, the so-called Red Western or Ostern. Generally, these took two forms: either straight Westerns shot in the Eastern Bloc, or action films involving the Russian Revolution, the Russian Civil War, and the Basmachi rebellion.

Many elements of space-travel series and films borrow extensively from the conventions of the Western genre. This is particularly the case in the space Western subgenre of science fiction. Peter Hyams&#x27;s &quot;Outland&quot; transferred the plot of &quot;High Noon&quot; to Io, moon of Jupiter. More recently, the space opera series &quot;Firefly&quot; used an explicitly Western theme for its portrayal of frontier worlds. Anime shows such as &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;, &quot;Trigun&quot; and &quot;Outlaw Star&quot; have been similar mixes of science-fiction and Western elements. The science fiction Western can be seen as a subgenre of either Westerns or science fiction. Elements of Western films can be found also in some films belonging essentially to other genres. For example, &quot;Kelly&#x27;s Heroes&quot; is a war film, but its action and characters are Western-like.
The character played by Humphrey Bogart in noir films such as &quot;Casablanca&quot; and &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot;—an individual bound only by his own private code of honor—has a lot in common with the classic Western hero. In turn, the Western has also explored noir elements, as with films such as Colorado Territory and &quot;Pursued.&quot;

In many of Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s books, the settlement of other planets is depicted in ways explicitly modeled on American settlement of the West. For example, in his &quot;Tunnel in the Sky&quot;, settlers set out to the planet New Canaan, via an interstellar teleporter portal across the galaxy, in Conestoga wagons, their captain sporting mustaches and a little goatee and riding a Palomino horse—with Heinlein explaining that the colonists would need to survive on their own for some years, so horses are more practical than machines.

Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; is a series of seven books that meshes themes of Westerns, high fantasy, science fiction, and horror. The protagonist Roland Deschain is a gunslinger whose image and personality are largely inspired by the Man with No Name from Sergio Leone&#x27;s films. In addition, the superhero fantasy genre has been described as having been derived from the cowboy hero, only powered up to omnipotence in a primarily urban setting. 

The Western genre has been parodied on a number of occasions, famous examples being &quot;Support Your Local Sheriff!&quot;, &quot;Cat Ballou&quot;, Mel Brooks&#x27;s &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot;, and &quot;Rustler&#x27;s Rhapsody&quot;.

George Lucas&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars&quot; films use many elements of a Western, and Lucas has said he intended for &quot;Star Wars&quot; to revitalize cinematic mythology, a part the Western once held. The Jedi, who take their name from Jidaigeki, are modeled after samurai, showing the influence of Kurosawa. The character Han Solo dressed like an archetypal gunslinger, and the Mos Eisley cantina is much like an Old West saloon.

Meanwhile, films such as &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;, which plucked actor Sam Elliott out of the Old West and into a Los Angeles bowling alley, and &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot;, about a Southern-boy-turned-gigolo in New York (who disappoints a client when he does not measure up to Gary Cooper), transplanted Western themes into modern settings for both purposes of parody and homage.

<text>The Aqsa Mosque (), also known as the Qibli Mosque or Qibli Chapel (, , ), is the main congregational mosque or prayer hall in the Al-Aqsa mosque compound in the Old City of Jerusalem. In some sources the building is also named &quot;al-Masjid al-Aqṣā,&quot; but this name primarily applies to the whole compound in which the building sits, which is itself also known as &quot;Al-Aqsa Mosque&quot;. The wider compound is known as Al-Aqsa or Al-Aqsa mosque compound, also known as al-Ḥaram al-Sharīf (, ).

During the rule of the Rashidun caliph Umar () or the Umayyad caliph Mu&#x27;awiya I (), a small prayer house on the compound was erected near the mosque&#x27;s site. The present-day mosque, located on the south wall of the compound, was originally built by the fifth Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik () or his successor al-Walid I () (or both) as a congregational mosque on the same axis as the Dome of the Rock, a commemorative Islamic monument. After being destroyed in an earthquake in 746, the mosque was rebuilt in 758 by the Abbasid caliph al-Mansur. It was further expanded upon in 780 by the Abbasid caliph al-Mahdi, after which it consisted of fifteen aisles and a central dome. However, it was again destroyed during the 1033 Jordan Rift Valley earthquake. The mosque was rebuilt by the Fatimid caliph al-Zahir (r. 1021–1036), who reduced it to seven aisles but adorned its interior with an elaborate central archway covered in vegetal mosaics; the current structure preserves the 11th-century outline.

During the periodic renovations undertaken, the ruling Islamic dynasties constructed additions to the mosque and its precincts, such as its dome, façade, minarets, and minbar and interior structure. Upon its capture by the Crusaders in 1099, the mosque was used as a palace; it was also the headquarters of the religious order of the Knights Templar. After the area was conquered by Saladin in 1187, the structure&#x27;s function as a mosque was restored. More renovations, repairs, and expansion projects were undertaken in later centuries by the Ayyubids, the Mamluks, the Ottomans, the Supreme Muslim Council of British Palestine, and during the Jordanian occupation of the West Bank. Since the beginning of the ongoing Israeli occupation of the West Bank, the mosque has remained under the independent administration of the Jerusalem Islamic Waqf.

==Definition==
The &quot;Al-Aqsa Mosque&quot; translates into &quot;the Farthest Mosque&quot; in English.
The Arabic term &quot;Al-Aqsa Mosque&quot; is the translation of both &quot;al-Masjid al-Aqṣā&quot; () and &quot;Jāmiʿ al-Aqṣā&quot; (), which have distinct meanings in Arabic. The former (&quot;al-Masjid al-Aqṣā&quot;) refers to the Quran&#x27;s &quot;Surah 17&quot; – &quot;the furthest mosque&quot; – and thus is used for whole compound of the Temple Mount, also known as the Haram al-Sharif, while the latter name (&quot;Jāmiʿ al-Aqṣā&quot;) is used for the subject of this article – the silver-domed congregational mosque building. Arabic and Persian writers such as 10th-century geographer al-Muqaddasi, 11th-century scholar Nasir Khusraw, 12th-century geographer al-Idrisi and 15th-century Islamic scholar Mujir al-Din, as well as 19th-century American and British Orientalists Edward Robinson, Guy Le Strange and Edward Henry Palmer explained that the term Masjid al-Aqsa refers to the entire esplanade plaza also known as the Temple Mount or Haram al-Sharif (&#x27;Noble Sanctuary&#x27;) – i.e. the entire area including the Dome of the Rock, the fountains, the gates, and the four minarets – because none of these buildings existed at the time the Quran was written. Al-Muqaddasi referred to the southern building (the subject of this article) as &quot;Al Mughattâ&quot; (&quot;the covered-part&quot;) and Nasir Khusraw referred to it with the Persian word &quot;Pushish&quot; (also the &quot;covered part&quot;, exactly as &quot;Al Mughatta&quot;) or the &quot;Maqsurah&quot; (a part-for-the-whole synecdoche).

The building is also referred to as (al-)Qibli Mosque or (al-)Qibli Chapel (&quot;Muṣallā al-Qiblī&quot;), in reference to its location on the southern end of the compound as a result of the Islamic qibla being moved from Jerusalem to Mecca. &quot;Qibli&quot; is the name used in official publications by the governmental organization which administers the site, the Jerusalem Islamic Waqf (part of the Jordanian government), and the Jordanian government more widely. It is also the official name used by the Palestine Liberation Organization. It has been used by numerous international organizations such as the United States State Department the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (whose role is to act as &quot;the collective voice of the Muslim world&quot;), and UNESCO, as well as various scholars and media organizations.

===Pre-construction===
The mosque is located on the southern part of the Temple Mount or Haram al-Sharif, an enclosure expanded by King Herod the Great beginning in 20 BCE during his reconstruction of the Second Jewish Temple. The mosque resides on an artificial platform that is supported by arches constructed by Herod&#x27;s engineers to overcome the difficult topographic conditions resulting from the southward expansion of the enclosure into the Tyropoeon and Kidron valleys. During the late Second Temple period, the present site of the mosque was occupied by the Royal Stoa, a basilica running the southern wall of the enclosure. The Royal Stoa was destroyed along with the Temple during the siege of Jerusalem by the Romans in 70 CE.

It was once thought that Emperor Justinian&#x27;s &quot;Nea Ekklesia of the Theotokos&quot;, and commonly known as the Nea Church, dedicated to the God-bearing Virgin Mary, consecrated in 543, was situated where al-Aqsa Mosque was later constructed. However, remains identified as those of the Nea Church were uncovered in the south part of the Jewish Quarter in 1973.

Analysis of the wooden beams and panels removed from the mosque during renovations in the 1930s shows they are made from Lebanese cedar and cypress. Radiocarbon dating gave a large range of ages, some as old as the 9th century BCE, showing that some of the wood had previously been used in older buildings. However, reexamination of the same beams in the 2010s gave dates in the Byzantine period.

During his excavations in the 1930s, Robert Hamilton uncovered portions of a multicolor mosaic floor with geometric patterns, but did not publish them. The date of the mosaic is disputed: Zachi Dvira considers that they are from the pre-Islamic Byzantine period, while Baruch, Reich and Sandhaus favor a much later Umayyad origin on account of their similarity to a mosaic from an Umayyad palace excavated adjacent to the Temple Mount&#x27;s southern wall. By comparing the photographs to Hamilton&#x27;s excavation report, Di Cesare determined that they belong to the second phase of mosque construction in the Umayyad period. Moreover, the mosaic designs were common in Islamic, Jewish and Christian buildings from the 2nd to the 8th century. Di Cesare suggested that Hamilton didn&#x27;t include the mosaics in his book because they were destroyed to explore beneath them.

===Umayyad period===
A mostly wooden, rectangular mosque on the Temple Mount site with a capacity for 3,000 worshippers is attested by the Gallic monk Arculf during his pilgrimage to Jerusalem in . Its precise location is not known. The art historian Oleg Grabar deems it likely that it was close to the present mosque, while the historian Yildirim Yavuz asserts it stood at the present site of the Dome of Rock. The architectural historian K. A. C. Creswell notes that Arculf&#x27;s attestation lends credibility to claims by some Islamic traditions and medieval Christian chronicles, which he otherwise deems legendary or unreliable, that the second Rashidun caliph, Umar (), ordered the construction of a primitive mosque on the Temple Mount. However, Arculf visited Palestine during the reign of Caliph Mu&#x27;awiya I (), founder of the Syria-based Umayyad Caliphate. Mu&#x27;awiya had been governor of Syria, including Palestine, for about twenty years before becoming caliph and his accession ceremony was held in Jerusalem. The 10th-century Jerusalemite scholar al-Mutahhar ibn Tahir al-Maqdisi claims Mu&#x27;awiya built a mosque on the Haram.

There is disagreement as to whether the present al-Aqsa Mosque was originally built by the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik () or his successor, his son al-Walid I (). Several architectural historians hold that Abd al-Malik commissioned the project and that al-Walid finished or expanded it. Abd al-Malik inaugurated great architectural works on the Temple Mount, including construction of the Dome of the Rock in . A common Islamic tradition holds that Abd al-Malik simultaneously commissioned the Dome of the Rock and the al-Aqsa Mosque. As both were intentionally built on the same axis, Grabar comments that the two structures form &quot;part of an architecturally thought-out ensemble comprising a congregational and a commemorative building&quot;, the al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock, respectively. Guy le Strange claims that Abd al-Malik used materials from the destroyed Church of Our Lady to build the mosque and points to possible evidence that substructures on the southeast corners of the mosque are remains of the church.

The earliest source indicating al-Walid&#x27;s work on the mosque is the Aphrodito Papryi. These contain the letters between al-Walid&#x27;s governor of Egypt in December 708–June 711 and a government official in Upper Egypt which discuss the dispatch of Egyptian laborers and craftsmen to help build the al-Aqsa Mosque, referred to as the &quot;Mosque of Jerusalem&quot;. The referenced workers spent between six months and a year on the construction. Several 10th and 13th-century historians credit al-Walid for founding the mosque, though the historian Amikam Elad doubts their reliability on the matter. In 713–714, a series of earthquakes ravaged Jerusalem, destroying the eastern section of the mosque, which was subsequently rebuilt by al-Walid&#x27;s order. He had gold from the Dome of the Rock melted to use as money to finance the repairs and renovations. He is credited by the early 15th-century historian al-Qalqashandi for covering the mosque&#x27;s walls with mosaics. Grabar notes that the Umayyad-era mosque was adorned with mosaics, marble, and &quot;remarkable crafted and painted woodwork&quot;. The latter are preserved partly in the Palestine Archaeological Museum and partly in the Islamic Museum.

Estimates of the size of the Umayyad-built mosque by architectural historians range from to . The building was rectangular. In the assessment of Grabar, the layout was a modified version of the traditional hypostyle mosque of the period. Its &quot;unusual&quot; characteristic was that its aisles laid perpendicular to the &quot;qibla&quot; wall. The number of aisles is not definitively known, though fifteen is cited by a number of historians. The central aisle, double the width of the others, was probably topped by a dome.

The last years of Umayyad rule were turbulent for Jerusalem. The last Umayyad caliph, Marwan II (), punished Jerusalem&#x27;s inhabitants for supporting a rebellion against him by rival princes, and tore down the city&#x27;s walls. In 746, the al-Aqsa Mosque was ruined in an earthquake. Four years later, the Umayyads were toppled and replaced by the Iraq-based Abbasid Caliphate.

===Abbasid period===
The Abbasids generally exhibited little interest in Jerusalem, though the historian Shelomo Dov Goitein notes they &quot;paid special tribute&quot; to the city during the early part of their rule, and Grabar asserts that the early Abbasids&#x27; work on the mosque suggests &quot;a major attempt to assert Abbasid sponsorship of holy places&quot;. Nevertheless, in contrast to the Umayyad period, maintenance of the al-Aqsa Mosque during Abbasid rule often came at the initiative of the local Muslim community, rather than from the caliph. The second Abbasid caliph, al-Mansur (), visited Jerusalem in 758, on his return from the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. He found the structures on the Haram in ruins from the 746 earthquake, including the al-Aqsa Mosque. According to the tradition cited by Mujir al-Din, the caliph was beseeched by the city&#x27;s Muslim residents to fund the buildings&#x27; restoration. In response, he had the gold and silver plaques covering the mosque&#x27;s doors converted into dinars and dirhams to finance the reconstruction.

A second earthquake damaged most of al-Mansur&#x27;s repairs, except for the southern portion near the &quot;mihrab&quot; (prayer niche indicating the &quot;qibla&quot;). In 780, his successor, al-Mahdi, ordered its reconstruction, mandating that his provincial governors and other commanders each contribute the cost of a colonnade. Al-Mahdi&#x27;s renovation is the first known to have written records describing it. The Jerusalemite geographer al-Muqaddasi, writing in 985, provided the following description:

This mosque is even more beautiful than that of Damascus ... the edifice [after al-Mahdi&#x27;s reconstruction] rose firmer and more substantial than ever it had been in former times. The more ancient portion remained, even like a beauty spot, in the midst of the new ... the Aqsa mosque has twenty-six doors ... The centre of the Main-building is covered by a mighty roof, high pitched and gable-wise, over which rises a magnificent dome.

Al-Muqaddasi further noted that the mosque consisted of fifteen aisles aligned perpendicularly to the &quot;qibla&quot; and possessed an elaborately decorated porch with the names of the Abbasid caliphs inscribed on its gates. According to Hamilton, al-Muqaddasi&#x27;s description of the Abbasid-era mosque is corroborated by his archaeological findings in 1938–1942, which showed the Abbasid construction retained some parts of the older structure and had a broad central aisle topped by a dome. The mosque described by al-Muqaddasi opened to the north, toward the Dome of the Rock, and, unusually according to Grabar, to the east.

Other than al-Mansur and al-Mahdi, no other Abbasid caliphs visited Jerusalem or commissioned work on the al-Aqsa Mosque, though Caliph al-Ma&#x27;mun () ordered significant work elsewhere on the Haram. He also contributed a bronze portal to the mosque&#x27;s interior, and the geographer Nasir Khusraw noted during his 1047 visit that al-Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s name was inscribed on it. Abd Allah ibn Tahir, the Abbasid governor of the eastern province of Khurasan (), is credited by al-Muqaddasi for building a colonnade on marble pillars in front of the fifteen doors on the mosque&#x27;s front (north) side.

===Fatimid period===

In 970, the Egypt-based Fatimid Caliphate conquered Palestine from the Ikhshidids, nominal allegiants of the Abbasids. Unlike the Abbasids and the Muslim inhabitants of Jerusalem, who were Sunnis, the Fatimids followed Shia Islam in its Isma&#x27;ili form. In 1033, another earthquake severely damaged the mosque. The Fatimid caliph al-Zahir () had the mosque reconstructed between 1034 and 1036, though work was not completed until 1065, during the reign of Caliph al-Mustansir ().

The new mosque was considerably smaller, reduced from fifteen aisles to seven, probably a reflection of the local population&#x27;s significant decline by this time. Excluding the two aisles on each side of the central nave, each aisle was made up of eleven arches running perpendicular to the &quot;qibla&quot;. The central nave was twice the breadth of the other aisles and had a gabled roof with a dome. The mosque likely lacked the side doors of its predecessor.

A prominent and distinctive feature of the new construction was the rich mosaic program endowed to the drum of the dome, the pendentives leading to the dome, and the arch in front of the &quot;mihrab&quot;. These three adjoining areas covered by the mosaics are collectively referred to as the &quot;triumphal arch&quot; by Grabar or the &quot;&quot;maqsura&quot; by Pruitt. Mosaic designs were rare in Islamic architecture in the post-Umayyad era and al-Zahir&#x27;s mosaics were a revival of this Umayyad architectural practice, including Abd al-Malik&#x27;s mosaics in the Dome of the Rock, but on a larger scale. The drum mosaic depicts a luxurious garden inspired by the Umayyad or Classical style. The four pendentives are gold and characterized by indented roundels with alternating gold and silver planes and patterns of peacock&#x27;s eyes, eight-pointed stars, and palm fronds. On the arch are large depictions of vegetation emanating from small vases.

Atop the &quot;mihrab&quot; arch is a lengthy inscription in gold directly linking the al-Aqsa Mosque with Muhammad&#x27;s Night Journey (the &quot;isra&quot; and &quot;mi&#x27;raj&quot;) from the &quot;masjid al-haram&quot; to the &quot;masjid al-aqsa&quot;&quot;. It marked the first instance of this Quranic verse being inscribed in Jerusalem, leading Grabar to hypothesize that it was an official move by the Fatimids to magnify the site&#x27;s sacred character. The inscription credits al-Zahir for renovating the mosque and two otherwise unknown figures, Abu al-Wasim and a &quot;sharif&quot;, al-Hasan al-Husayni, for supervising the work.

Nasir Khusraw described the mosque during his 1047 visit. He deemed it &quot;very large&quot;, measuring 420 by 150 cubits on its western side. The distance between each &quot;sculptured&quot; marble column, 280 in number, was six cubits. The columns were supported by stone arches and lead joints. He noted the following features:

 ... the mosque is everywhere flagged with coloured marble ... The Maksurah [or space railed off for the officials] is facing the centre of the south wall [of the Mosque and Haram Area], and is of such size as to contain sixteen columns. Above rises a mighty dome that is ornamented with enamel work.

Al-Zahir&#x27;s substantial investment in the Haram, including the al-Aqsa Mosque, amid the political instability in the capital Cairo, rebellions by Bedouin tribes, especially the Jarrahids of Palestine, and plagues, indicate the caliph&#x27;s &quot;commitment to Jerusalem&quot;, in Pruitt&#x27;s words. Although the city had experienced decreases in its population in the preceding decades, the Fatimids attempted to build up the magnificence and symbolism of the mosque, and the Haram in general, for their own religious and political reasons. The present-day mosque largely retains al-Zahir&#x27;s plan.

Fatimid investment in Jerusalem ground to a halt toward the end of the 11th century as their rule became further destabilized. In 1071, a Turkish mercenary, Atsiz, was invited by the city&#x27;s Fatimid governor to rein in the Bedouin, but he turned on the Fatimids, besieging and capturing Jerusalem that year. A few years later, the inhabitants revolted against him, and were slaughtered by Atsiz, including those who had taken shelter in the al-Aqsa Mosque. He was killed by the Turkish Seljuks in 1078, establishing Seljuk rule over the city, which lasted until the Fatimids regained control in 1098.

===Crusader, Ayyubid and Mamluk periods===

Jerusalem was captured by the Crusaders in 1099, during the First Crusade. They named the mosque &quot;Templum Solomonis&quot; (Solomon&#x27;s Temple), distinguishing it from the Dome of the Rock, which they named &quot;Templum Domini&quot; (Temple of God). While the Dome of the Rock was turned into a Christian church under the care of the Augustinians, the al-Aqsa Mosque was used as a royal palace and also as a stable for horses. In 1119, the Crusader king accommodated the headquarters of the Knights Templar next to his palace within the building. During this period, the mosque underwent some structural changes, including the expansion of its northern porch, and the addition of an apse and a dividing wall. A new cloister and church were also built at the site, along with various other structures. The Templars constructed vaulted western and eastern annexes to the building; the western currently serves as the women&#x27;s mosque and the eastern as the Islamic Museum.

After the Ayyubids under the leadership of Saladin reconquered Jerusalem following the siege of 1187, several repairs and renovations were undertaken at al-Aqsa Mosque. In order to prepare the mosque for Friday prayers, within a week of his capture of Jerusalem Saladin had the toilets and grain stores installed by the Crusaders at al-Aqsa removed, the floors covered with precious carpets, and its interior scented with rosewater and incense. Saladin&#x27;s predecessor—the Zengid sultan Nur al-Din—had commissioned the construction of a new &quot;minbar&quot; or &quot;pulpit&quot; made of ivory and wood in 1168–69, but it was completed after his death; Nur ad-Din&#x27;s &quot;minbar&quot; was added to the mosque in November 1187 by Saladin. The Ayyubid sultan of Damascus, al-Mu&#x27;azzam, built the northern porch of the mosque with three gates in 1218. In 1345, the Mamluk sultan al-Kamil Sha&#x27;ban added two naves and two gates to the mosque&#x27;s eastern side.

===Ottoman/modern period===
After the Ottomans assumed power in 1517, they did not undertake any major renovations or repairs to the mosque. They made architectural contributions elsewhere on the Haram, including building the Fountain of Qasim Pasha (1527) and three free-standing domes—the most notable being the Dome of the Prophet built in 1538, and restoring the Pool of Raranj. These constructions were commissioned by the Ottoman governors of Jerusalem, rather than the sultans, whose contributions were limited to additions to the existing minarets.

In 1816, the mosque was restored by Sulayman Pasha al-Adil, the Acre-based governor of Sidon, after having been in a dilapidated state.

The first renovation in the 20th century occurred in 1922, when the Supreme Muslim Council under Amin al-Husayni (the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem) commissioned Turkish architect Ahmet Kemalettin Bey to restore al-Aqsa Mosque and the monuments in its precincts. The council also commissioned British architects, Egyptian engineering experts and local officials to contribute to and oversee the repairs and additions which were carried out in 1924–25 by Kemalettin. The renovations included reinforcing the mosque&#x27;s ancient Umayyad foundations, rectifying the interior columns, replacing the beams, erecting a scaffolding, conserving the arches and drum of the main dome&#x27;s interior, rebuilding the southern wall, and replacing timber in the central nave with a slab of concrete. The renovations also revealed Fatimid-era mosaics and inscriptions on the interior arches that had been covered with plasterwork. The arches were decorated with gold and green-tinted gypsum and their timber tie beams were replaced with brass. A quarter of the stained glass windows also were carefully renewed so as to preserve their original Abbasid and Fatimid designs.

Severe damage was caused by the 1837 and 1927 earthquakes. The damage from the 1927 earthquake and a small tremor in the summer of 1937 caused the roof of the mosque to collapse. Repairs were undertaken in 1938 and 1942. The upper part of the north wall of the mosque was reconstructed and the whole interior of the roofing was refaced. Other repairs included the partial reconstruction of the jambs and lintels of the central doors, the refacing of the front of five bays of the porch, and the demolition of the vaulted buildings that formerly adjoined the east side of the mosque. Italian Fascist leader Benito Mussolini donated Carrara marble columns in the late 1930s. 

On 20 July 1951, King Abdullah I was shot three times by a Palestinian gunman as he entered the mosque, killing him. His grandson Prince Hussein, was at his side and was also hit, though a medal he was wearing on his chest deflected the bullet.

The site fell under Israeli control on 7 June 1967, during the Six Day War.
On 21 August 1969, a fire was started by a visitor from Australia named Denis Michael Rohan, an evangelical Christian who hoped that by burning down al-Aqsa Mosque he would hasten the Second Coming of Jesus. In response to the incident, a summit of Islamic countries was held in Rabat that same year, hosted by Faisal of Saudi Arabia, the then king of Saudi Arabia. The al-Aqsa fire is regarded as one of the catalysts for the formation of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC, now the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation) in 1972.

Following the fire, the dome was reconstructed in concrete and covered with anodized aluminium, instead of the original ribbed lead enamel work sheeting. In 1983, the aluminium outer covering was replaced with lead to match the original design by az-Zahir.

In the 1980s, Ben Shoshan and Yehuda Etzion, both members of the Gush Emunim Underground, plotted to blow up the al-Aqsa mosque and the Dome of the Rock. Etzion believed that blowing up the two mosques would cause a spiritual awakening in Israel, and would solve all the problems of the Jewish people. They also hoped the Third Temple of Jerusalem would be built on the location of the mosque.

On 5 November 2014, Israeli police entered Al-Aqsa for the first time since capturing Jerusalem in 1967, said Sheikh Azzam Al-Khatib, director of the Islamic Waqf. Previous media reports of &#x27;storming Al-Aqsa&#x27; referred to the Haram al-Sharif compound rather than the Al-Aqsa mosque itself.

==Architecture==
The rectangular al-Aqsa Mosque and its precincts cover , although the mosque itself is about in area and can hold up to 5,000 worshippers. It is long, wide. Unlike the Dome of the Rock, which reflects classical Byzantine architecture, the Aqsa Mosque is characteristic of early Islamic architecture.

===Dome===
Nothing remains of the original dome built by Abd al-Malik. The present-day dome mimicks that of az-Zahir, which consisted of wood plated with lead enamelwork, but which was destroyed by fire in 1969. Today it is made of concrete with lead sheeting.

Al-Aqsa&#x27;s dome is one of the few domes to be built in front of the &quot;mihrab&quot; during the Umayyad and Abbasid periods, the others being the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus (715) and the Great Mosque of Sousse (850). The interior of the dome is painted with 14th-century-era decorations. During the 1969 burning, the paintings were assumed to be irreparably lost, but were completely reconstructed using the &quot;trateggio&quot; technique, a method that uses fine vertical lines to distinguish reconstructed areas from original ones.

===Facade and porch===
The facade of the mosque was built in 1065 CE on the instructions of the Fatimid caliph al-Mustansir Billah. It was crowned with a balustrade consisting of arcades and small columns. The Crusaders damaged the facade, but it was restored and renovated by the Ayyubids. One addition was the covering of the facade with tiles. The second-hand material of the facade&#x27;s arches includes sculpted, ornamental material taken from Crusader structures in Jerusalem. The facade consists of fourteen stone arches, most of which are of a Romanesque style. The outer arches added by the Mamluks follow the same general design. The entrance to the mosque is through the facade&#x27;s central arch.

The porch is located at the top of the facade. The central bays of the porch were built by the Knights Templar during the First Crusade, but Saladin&#x27;s nephew al-Mu&#x27;azzam Isa ordered the construction of the porch itself in 1217.

===Interior===
The al-Aqsa Mosque has seven aisles of hypostyle naves with several additional small halls to the west and east of the southern section of the building. There are 121 stained glass windows in the mosque from the Abbasid and Fatimid eras. About a fourth of them were restored in 1924. The spandrels of the arch opposite the main entrance include a mosaic decoration and inscription dating back to Fatimid period.

The mosque&#x27;s interior is supported by 45 columns, 33 of which are white marble and 12 of stone. The column rows of the central aisles are heavy and stunted. The remaining four rows are better proportioned. The capitals of the columns are of four different kinds: those in the central aisle are heavy and primitively designed, while those under the dome are of the Corinthian order, and made from Italian white marble. The capitals in the eastern aisle are of a heavy basket-shaped design and those east and west of the dome are also basket-shaped, but smaller and better proportioned. The columns and piers are connected by an architectural rave, which consists of beams of roughly squared timber enclosed in a wooden casing.

A great portion of the mosque is covered with whitewash, but the drum of the dome and the walls immediately beneath it are decorated with mosaics and marble. Some paintings by an Italian artist were introduced when repairs were undertaken at the mosque after an earthquake ravaged the mosque in 1927. The ceiling of the mosque was painted with funding by King Farouk of Egypt.

===Minbar===
The &quot;minbar&quot; of the mosque was built by a craftsman named Akhtarini from Aleppo on the orders of the Zengid sultan Nur ad-Din. It was intended to be a gift for the mosque when Nur ad-Din would capture Jerusalem from the Crusaders and took six years to build (1168–74). Nur ad-Din died and the Crusaders still controlled Jerusalem, but in 1187, Saladin captured the city and the &quot;minbar&quot; was installed. The structure was made of ivory and carefully crafted wood. Arabic calligraphy, geometrical and floral designs were inscribed in the woodwork.

After its destruction by Rohan in 1969, it was replaced by a much simpler &quot;minbar&quot;. In January 2007, Adnan al-Husayni—head of the Islamic &quot;waqf&quot; in charge of al-Aqsa—stated that a new &quot;minbar&quot; would be installed; it was installed in February 2007. The design of the new &quot;minbar&quot; was drawn by Jamil Badran based on an exact replica of the Saladin Minbar and was finished by Badran within a period of five years. The &quot;minbar&quot; itself was built in Jordan over a period of four years and the craftsmen used &quot;ancient woodworking methods, joining the pieces with pegs instead of nails, but employed computer images to design the pulpit [&quot;minbar&quot;].&quot;

==Current situation==

===Administration===

The administrative body responsible for the whole Al-Aqsa Mosque compound is known as &quot;the Jerusalem Waqf&quot;, an organ of the Jordanian government.

The Jerusalem Waqf is responsible for administrative matters in the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound. Religious authority on the site, on the other hand, is the responsibility of the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, appointed by the government of the State of Palestine.

After the 1969 arson attack, the &quot;waqf&quot; employed architects, technicians and craftsmen in a committee that carry out regular maintenance operations. The Islamic Movement in Israel and the &quot;waqf&quot; have attempted to increase Muslim control of the Temple Mount as a way of countering Israeli policies and the escalating presence of Israeli security forces around the site since the Second Intifada. Some activities included refurbishing abandoned structures and renovating.

Ownership of the al-Aqsa Mosque is a contentious issue in the Israel-Palestinian conflict. During the negotiations at the 2000 Camp David Summit, Palestinians demanded complete ownership of the mosque and other Islamic holy sites in East Jerusalem.

===Access===
Muslims who are residents of Israel or visiting the country and Palestinians living in East Jerusalem are normally allowed to enter the Temple Mount and pray at al-Aqsa Mosque without restrictions. Due to security measures, the Israeli government occasionally prevents certain groups of Muslims from reaching al-Aqsa by blocking the entrances to the complex; the restrictions vary from time to time. At times, restrictions have prevented all men under 45, unmarried men under 50 and women under 45 from entering. Sometimes the restrictions are enforced on the occasion of Friday prayers, other times they are over an extended period of time. Restrictions are most severe for Gazans, followed by restrictions on those from West Bank. The Israeli government states that the restrictions are in place for security reasons.

Until 2000, non-Muslim visitors could enter the Aqsa Mosque by getting a ticket from the Waqf. That procedure ended when the Second Intifada began. Over two decades later, the Waqf still hopes negotiations between Israel and Jordan may result in allowing visitors to enter once again.

===Excavations===

Several excavations outside the Temple Mount took place following the 1967 War. In 1970, Israeli authorities commenced intensive excavations outside the walls next to the mosque on the southern and western sides. Palestinians believed that tunnels were being dug under the Aqsa Mosque in order to undermine its foundations, which was denied by Israelis, who claimed that the closest excavation to the mosque was some to its south. The Archaeological Department of the Israeli Ministry of Religious Affairs dug a tunnel near the western portion of the mosque in 1984. According to UNESCO&#x27;s special envoy to Jerusalem Oleg Grabar, buildings and structures on the Temple Mount are deteriorating due mostly to disputes between the Israeli, Palestinian and Jordanian governments over who is actually responsible for the site.

In February 2007, the department started to excavate a site for archaeological remains in a location where the government wanted to rebuild a collapsed pedestrian bridge leading to the Mughrabi Gate, the only entrance for non-Muslims into the Temple Mount complex. This site was away from the mosque. The excavations provoked anger throughout the Islamic world, and Israel was accused of trying to destroy the foundation of the mosque. Ismail Haniyeh—then Prime Minister of the Palestinian National Authority and Hamas leader—called on Palestinians to unite to protest the excavations, while Fatah said they would end their ceasefire with Israel. Israel denied all charges against them, calling them &quot;ludicrous&quot;.

===Conflicts===
In April 2021, during both Passover and Ramadan, the site was a focus of tension between Israeli settlers and Palestinians. Jewish settlers broke an agreement between Israel and Jordan and performed prayers and read from the Torah inside the compound, an area normally off limits to non-Muslims. On 14 April, Israeli police entered the area and forcibly cut wires to speakers in minarets around the mosque, silencing the call to prayer, claiming the sound was interfering with an event by the Israeli president at the Western Wall. On 16 April, seventy thousand Muslims prayed in the compound around the mosque, the largest gathering since the beginning of the COVID pandemic; police barred most from entering the structure itself. In May 2021, hundreds of Palestinians were injured following clashes in the compound after reports of Israel&#x27;s intention to proceed to evict Palestinians from land claimed by Israeli settlers.

On 15 April 2022, Israeli forces entered the Temple Mount and used tear gas shells and sound bombs to disperse Palestinians who, they said, were throwing stones at policemen. Some Palestinians barricaded themselves inside the Al-Aqsa mosque, where they were detained by Israeli police. Over 150 people ended up injured and 400 arrested.

On April 5, 2023, Israeli police raided the temple, saying &quot;agitators&quot; who had thrown stones and fired fireworks at the police, had barricaded themselves and worshippers inside. Following the incident, militants fired rockets from Gaza into southern Israel.

On 22 April, 2024 Israeli police arrested 13 for incitement to violence after they were caught in the act of smuggling goats onto the site for ritual sacrifice, 3 had been arrested in 2023 for trying to smuggle lambs and goats onto the site.

<text>A narrative technique (also, in fiction, a fictional device) is any of several storytelling methods the creator of a story uses, thus effectively relaying information to the audience or making the story more complete, complex, or engaging. Some scholars also call such a technique a narrative mode, though this term can also more narrowly refer to the particular technique of using a commentary to deliver a story. Other possible synonyms within written narratives are literary technique or literary device, though these can also broadly refer to non-narrative writing strategies, as might be used in academic or essay writing, as well as poetic devices such as assonance, metre, or rhyme scheme. Furthermore, narrative techniques are distinguished from narrative elements, which exist inherently in all works of narrative, rather than being merely optional strategies.

<text>Duncan Forbes (28 April 1798 – 17 August 1868) was a Scottish linguist and orientalist.

== Biography ==
Forbes was born in Kinnaird, Perthshire and was brought up by his grandfather from the age of three after his parents and younger brother emigrated to the United States. Illiterate until 13, he showed no early signs of linguistic ability but despite this late start, at age 17 he was appointed schoolmaster of the village of Stralock.

Shortly after this he attended Kirkmichael school followed by Perth Grammar School and the University of St. Andrews, gaining a master&#x27;s degree from the latter.

In 1823 he took a post at Calcutta Academy, but because of poor health he was forced to return to Europe in 1826. In 1837 he became professor of Oriental languages at King&#x27;s College London and stayed at this post until his retirement in 1861. During his time at King&#x27;s College London he also worked at the British Museum, cataloguing the collection of Persian manuscripts.

During his lifetime he wrote a number of books and it is for these that he is most remembered. He had a hand in translating or editing a number of books in Urdu, Persian and Arabic, including a translation of Mir Amman&#x27;s Urdu &quot;Bagh o Bahar, or Tales of the Four Darweshes&quot;, (which is itself a translation from the Persian of Amir Khusro), and of the Persian &quot;Adventures of Hatim Tai&quot;.

<text>Theatre techniques facilitate presentation of performances by actors. Improvisational theatre techniques involve spontaneous enactments of stories on the spot.

==The playwright&#x27;s craft==
Theatre technique is part of the playwright&#x27;s creative writing of drama, as a kind of mimesis rather than mere illusion or imitation of life, in that the playwright is able to present a reality to the audience that is different, yet recognisable to that which they usually identify with in their everyday lives.

Another aspect of this is that of creating the kind of dialogue that makes the playwright&#x27;s characters come alive and allows for their development in the course of his dramatization.

The playwright&#x27;s art also consists in the ability to convey to the audience the ideas that give essence to the drama within the frame of its structure. 
Finally, the feeling for the natural divisions of a play—including acts, scenes, and changes of place—its entries and exits, and the positioning of the cast are integral to playwriting technique.

One of the playwright&#x27;s functions is that concerned with adaptations of existing traditional drama, such as Charles Marowitz’s collages of &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;Macbeth&quot; and other re-interpretations of Shakespeare&#x27;s works, as well as Tom Stoppard’s approaches in &quot;Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead&quot;, &quot;Dogg&#x27;s Hamlet&quot;, and &quot;Cahoot&#x27;s Macbeth&quot;.

==The director’s craft==
The director these days is responsible for the actual production of a play, as opposed to earlier days when it was the producer who, at least in Britain until the 1950s, had this task. In earlier centuries it was the author, an actor-manager, or a leading actor with whom the responsibilities of staging a drama were invested.

The director produces the play in the way he envisages how it ought to be seen as he interprets what the playwright intended within the drama; he takes care of the effectiveness of the rehearsals of the actors; and coordinates the work of designers and technicians in the production. 
However, the playwright&#x27;s work is still reflected in the director&#x27;s prompt copy, a separate form of stage instructions worked out in detail by the director, in which each actor is given details as to what is happening onstage, where exactly he has to be in relation to the back, front, left, or right of the stage, and what he is to do at any one time during the play.

== Stage management and stagecraft ==
The stage manager has to work with the director, and ascertain whether both the director&#x27;s objectives and the perceptions of the stage designers are compatible and realistic. They are usually the link between the director and the rest of the company, and are responsible for the director&#x27;s visions being passed down to each actor and member of the running crew. They are also responsible for safety and running an orderly backstage area. They maintain the prompt book and the call board, to which rehearsal schedule notes are affixed for the cast.

Stagecraft overall has to address the various shortcomings of the stage&#x27;s spatial and physical limitations. For example, the stage alone cannot be expected to provide wide and distant vistas, or vast spaces where armies gather or huge masses of people congregate. Natural phenomena such as thunderstorms or winds, that are often part of the drama, cannot be recreated in their original form. Furthermore, because of the distance involved, it is difficult for actors to portray the feelings, tensions and passions of their characters to the audience with much distinctiveness.

It is for these reasons that special technologies and techniques have been developed from classical times onward to supplement and augment the effects that are to be realised. Technical specialists help to implement these techniques by providing expertise in various areas of the production. The stage manager and their team must ultimately draw all these separate techniques together to create an effective and successful stage production.

*Sets and sceneries have to be designed and created in the workshop. They include outdoor and indoor scenes, or special types of constructions, and must also usually achieve the appearance of depth and distance within the spatial limitations of the stage.
*Stage lighting has to be provided to set the moods and sensitivities of the play, and to permit the showing of the emotional charge in the face of the actors, possibly reinforcing the pallor or vividness of their faces.
*Costumes have to typify characters from the moment they appear on stage and signify the period or the social milieu in which the characters are to be seen. They can also indicate the characters&#x27; circumstances (whether they should appear rich or poor) or even whether they should be seen as comic or tragic personae.
*Sound effects have to convey natural phenomena, such as wind or storm. However, it is also their function to call forth moods and feelings the audience will recognise.
*Special effects have to deliver the imitations of physical actions on stage, such as explosions, fireworks, fog, or even earthquakes that are often part of the story.
*Rigging is an important aspect that is not often visible. All sound and lighting features and their cabling and wiring have to be held in a safe position, above both the stage and the auditorium, and therefore require specialist temporary and permanent fittings to be installed.
*The technical director, especially in larger theatres, has the responsibility of overseeing the rigging and construction of the stage scenery. They create working drawings from the scenic designer&#x27;s drawings in order to pass on the designs to the scene shop.

==Trends and movements==

===The three unities===
The &quot;Classical unities&quot; of time, action and place were the main principles of French neo-classical drama during part of the 17th century.&lt;br&gt;They were introduced by Jean Mairet after a misreading of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Poetics&quot;, and the critic Castelvetro insisted that playwrights and directors adhere to the unities. In the &quot;Poetics&quot; Aristotle had merely recommended that action should consist only of the main plot without any subplots, and that the time represented by action should not stretch beyond the length of one day. Time merely entered into his recommendations as a hint as to the limits of the attention span the audience could be expected to have. The unity of place, that of the confinement of the action in a play to one locality only, was not mentioned at all.&lt;br&gt;The effect of the three unities on French drama during this period was that their presentation became very restrictive, and it was only when later dramatists began to avoid mentioning specific times and places that the presentation of plays became more creative again.

===The Fourth Unity=== 

In 1944, the Bengal playwright Natyaguru Nurul Momen, introduced the fourth unity in his pioneering tragedy play, Nemesis. In this epoch-making one character play (in other words, Monodrama), Nurul Momen immaculately maintained all the three Aristotelian unities of classical Greek theatre --- and added the fourth unity for the first time in world theatre. 

In the preface of Nemesis the Natyaguru wrote, &quot; In this play a fourth Unity is added to the traditional three unities of The Greek Tragedies -- Time, Place &amp; Action. A new experimentation has been done by introducing a new unity --- &quot;Unity of Person&quot; despite maintaining the format of The three unities. &quot;

==Theatre presentation==

Some dramatists and dramaturgists try to achieve particular effects that are not normally sought in a theatre presentation.

===Defamiliarization effect (Verfremdungseffekt)===
Bertolt Brecht coined the term &quot;defamiliarization effect&quot; (sometimes called &quot;estrangement effect&quot; or &quot;alienation effect&quot;; German &quot;Verfremdungseffekt&quot;) for an approach to theater that focused on the central ideas and decisions in the play, and discouraged involving the audience in an illusory world and in the emotions of the characters. Brecht thought the audience required an emotional distance to reflect on what is being presented. See epic theater.

==Teichoscopy==

One of the oldest techniques that has been used often, is that of &quot;teichoscopy&quot; or the &quot;viewing from the wall&quot;, in which actors observe events beyond the confines of the stage, such as a distant battle, and discuss it on stage while the battle is taking place, as opposed to the event being reported by messengers at a later time after the event has happened. Shakespeare uses this technique in the final scenes of the play &quot;The Tragedy of Julius Caesar&quot;.

<doc id="65776" wikidata="Q151103" url="?curid=65776" title="Metcalfe's law">
<text>Metcalfe&#x27;s law states that the financial value or influence of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system (2). The law is named after Robert Metcalfe and was first proposed in 1980, albeit not in terms of users, but rather of &quot;compatible communicating devices&quot; (e.g., fax machines, telephones). It later became associated with users on the Ethernet after a September 1993 &quot;Forbes&quot; article by George Gilder.

==Network effects==
Metcalfe&#x27;s law characterizes many of the network effects of communication technologies and networks such as the Internet, social networking and the World Wide Web. Former Chairman of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission Reed Hundt said that this law gives the most understanding to the workings of the present-day Internet. Mathematically, Metcalfe&#x27;s Law shows that the number of unique possible connections in an formula_1-node connection can be expressed as the triangular number formula_2, which is asymptotically proportional to formula_3.

The law has often been illustrated using the example of fax machines: a single fax machine on its own is useless, but the value of every fax machine increases with the total number of fax machines in the network, because the total number of people with whom each user may send and receive documents increases. This is common illustration to explain network effect. Thus, in any social network, the greater the number of users with the service, the more valuable the service becomes to the community.

== History and derivation ==
Metcalfe&#x27;s law was conceived in 1983 in a presentation to the 3Com sales force. It stated would be proportional to the total number of possible connections, or approximately -squared.

The original incarnation was careful to delineate between a linear cost (), non-linear growth(2) and a non-constant proportionality factor affinity (). The break-even point point where costs are recouped is given by:formula_4At some size, the right-hand side of the equation , value, exceeds the cost, and describes the relationship between size and net value added. For large , net network value is then:formula_5Metcalfe properly dimensioned as &quot;value per user&quot;. Affinity is also a function of network size, and Metcalfe correctly asserted that must decline as grows large. In a 2006 interview, Metcalfe stated:

=== Growth of ===
Network size, and hence value, does not grow unbounded but is constrained by practical limitations such as infrastructure, access to technology, and bounded rationality such as Dunbar&#x27;s number. It is almost always the case that user growth reaches a saturation point. With technologies, substitutes, competitors and technical obsolescence constrain growth of . Growth of n is typically assumed to follow a sigmoid function such as a logistic curve or Gompertz curve.

=== Density ===
&quot;A&quot; is also governed by the connectivity or &quot;density&quot; of the network topology. In an undirected network, every &quot;edge&quot; connects two nodes such that there are 2&quot;m&quot; nodes per edge. The proportion of nodes in actual contact are given by formula_6.

The maximum possible number of edges in a simple network (i.e. one with no multi-edges or self-edges) is formula_7. 
Therefore the density &quot;ρ&quot; of a network is the faction of those edges that are actually present is:

which for large networks is approximated by formula_8.

== Limitations ==
Metcalfe&#x27;s law assumes that the value of each node formula_1 is of equal benefit. If this is not the case, for example because one fax machine serves 60 workers in a company, the second fax machine serves half of that, the third one third, and so on, then the relative value of an additional connection decreases. Likewise, in social networks, if users that join later use the network less than early adopters, then the benefit of each additional user may lessen, making the overall network less efficient if costs per users are fixed.

==Modified models==
Within the context of social networks, many, including Metcalfe himself, have proposed modified models in which the value of the network grows as formula_10 rather than formula_3. Reed and Andrew Odlyzko have sought out possible relationships to Metcalfe&#x27;s Law in terms of describing the relationship of a network and one can read about how those are related. Tongia and Wilson also examine the related question of the costs to those excluded.

== Validation in data ==
For more than 30 years, there was little concrete evidence in support of the law. Finally, in July 2013, Dutch researchers analyzed European Internet-usage patterns over a long-enough time and found formula_3 proportionality for small values of formula_1 and formula_10 proportionality for large values of formula_1. A few months later, Metcalfe himself provided further proof by using Facebook&#x27;s data over the past 10 years to show a good fit for Metcalfe&#x27;s law.

In 2015, Zhang, Liu, and Xu parameterized the Metcalfe function in data from Tencent and Facebook. Their work showed that Metcalfe&#x27;s law held for both, despite differences in audience between the two sites (Facebook serving a worldwide audience and Tencent serving only Chinese users). The functions for the two sites were formula_16 and formula_17 respectively.
One of the earliest mentions of the Metcalfe Law in the context of Bitcoin was by a Reddit post by Santostasi in 2014. He compared the observed generalized Metcalfe behavior for Bitcoin to the Zipf&#x27;s Law and the theoretical Metcalfe result.
The Metcalfe&#x27;s Law is a critical component of Santostasi&#x27;s Bitcoin Power Law Theory.
In a working paper, Peterson linked time-value-of-money concepts to Metcalfe value using Bitcoin and Facebook as numerical examples of the proof, and in 2018 applied Metcalfe&#x27;s law to Bitcoin, showing that over 70% of variance in Bitcoin value was explained by applying Metcalfe&#x27;s law to increases in Bitcoin network size.

In a 2024 interview, mathematician Terence Tao emphasized the importance of universality and networking within the mathematics community, for which he cited the Metcalfe&#x27;s Law. Tao believes that a larger audience leads to more connections, which ultimately results in positive developments within the community. For this, he cited Metcalfe&#x27;s law to support this perspective. Tao further stated, &quot;my whole career experience has been sort of the more connections equals just better stuff happening&quot;.

<doc id="65777" wikidata="Q2252" url="?curid=65777" title="Buzz Aldrin">
<text>Buzz Aldrin ( ; born Edwin Eugene Aldrin Jr.; January 20, 1930) is an American former astronaut, engineer and fighter pilot. He made three spacewalks as pilot of the 1966 Gemini 12 mission, and was the Lunar Module &quot;Eagle&quot; pilot on the 1969 Apollo 11 mission. He was the second person to walk on the Moon after mission commander Neil Armstrong. Following the deaths of Armstrong in 2012 and pilot Michael Collins in 2021, he is the last surviving Apollo 11 crew member.

Born in Glen Ridge, New Jersey, Aldrin graduated third in the class of 1951 from the United States Military Academy at West Point with a degree in mechanical engineering. He was commissioned into the United States Air Force and served as a jet fighter pilot during the Korean War. He flew 66 combat missions and shot down two MiG-15 aircraft.

After earning a Doctor of Science degree in astronautics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Aldrin was selected as a member of NASA&#x27;s Astronaut Group 3, making him the first astronaut with a doctoral degree. His doctoral thesis, &quot;Line-of-Sight Guidance Techniques for Manned Orbital Rendezvous&quot;, earned him the nickname &quot;Dr. Rendezvous&quot; from fellow astronauts. His first space flight was in 1966 on Gemini 12, during which he spent over five hours on extravehicular activity. Three years later, Aldrin set foot on the Moon at 03:15:16 on July 21, 1969 (UTC), nineteen minutes after Armstrong first touched the surface, while command module pilot Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit. A Presbyterian elder, Aldrin became the first person to hold a religious ceremony on the Moon, when he privately took communion, which was the first food and liquid to be consumed there.

After leaving NASA in 1971, Aldrin became Commandant of the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School. He retired from the Air Force in 1972 after 21 years of service. His autobiographies &quot;Return to Earth&quot; (1973) and &quot;Magnificent Desolation&quot; (2009) recount his struggles with clinical depression and alcoholism in the years after leaving NASA. Aldrin continues to advocate for space exploration, particularly a human mission to Mars. He developed the Aldrin cycler, a special spacecraft trajectory that makes travel to Mars more efficient in terms of time and propellant. He has been accorded numerous honors, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1969.

== Early life and education ==
Aldrin was born Edwin Eugene Aldrin Jr. on January 20, 1930, at Mountainside Hospital in Glen Ridge, New Jersey. His parents, Edwin Eugene Aldrin Sr. and Marion Aldrin ( Moon), lived in neighboring Montclair. His father was an Army aviator during World War I and the assistant commandant of the Army&#x27;s test pilot school at McCook Field, Ohio, from 1919 to 1922, but left the Army in 1928 and became an executive at Standard Oil. Aldrin had two sisters: Madeleine, who was four years older, and Fay Ann, who was a year and a half older. His nickname, which became his legal first name in 1988, arose as a result of Fay&#x27;s mispronouncing &quot;brother&quot; as &quot;buzzer&quot;, which was then shortened to &quot;Buzz&quot;. He was a Boy Scout, achieving the rank of Tenderfoot Scout.

Aldrin did well in school, maintaining an A average. He played football and was the starting center for Montclair High School&#x27;s undefeated 1946 state champion team. His father wanted him to go to the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, and enrolled him at nearby Severn School, a preparatory school for Annapolis, and even secured him a Naval Academy appointment from Albert W. Hawkes, one of the United States senators from New Jersey. Aldrin attended Severn School in 1946, but had other ideas about his future career. He suffered from seasickness and considered ships a distraction from flying airplanes. He faced down his father and told him to ask Hawkes to change the nomination to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York.

Aldrin entered West Point in 1947. He did well academically, finishing first in his class his plebe (first) year. Aldrin was also an excellent athlete, competing in pole vault for the academy track and field team. In 1950, he traveled with a group of West Point cadets to Japan and the Philippines to study the military government policies of Douglas MacArthur. During the trip, the Korean War broke out. On June 5, 1951, Aldrin graduated third in the class of 1951 with a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering.

== Military career ==
Among the top of his class, Aldrin had his choice of assignments. He chose the United States Air Force, which had become a separate service in 1947 while Aldrin was still at West Point and did not yet have its own academy. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant and underwent basic flight training in T-6 Texans at Bartow Air Base in Florida. His classmates included Sam Johnson, who later became a prisoner of war in Vietnam; the two became friends. At one point, Aldrin attempted a double Immelmann turn in a T-28 Trojan and suffered a grayout. He recovered in time to pull out at about , averting what would have been a fatal crash.
When Aldrin was deciding what sort of aircraft he should fly, his father advised him to choose bombers, because command of a bomber crew gave an opportunity to learn and hone leadership skills, which could open up better prospects for career advancement. Aldrin chose instead to fly fighters. He moved to Nellis Air Force Base in Las Vegas, where he learned to fly the F-80 Shooting Star and the F-86 Sabre. Like most jet fighter pilots of the era, he preferred the latter.

In December 1952, Aldrin was assigned to the 16th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, which was part of the 51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing. At the time it was based at Suwon Air Base, about south of Seoul, and was engaged in combat operations as part of the Korean War. During an acclimatization flight, his main fuel system froze at 100percent power, which would have soon used up all his fuel. He was able to override the setting manually, but this required holding a button down, which in turn made it impossible to also use his radio. He barely managed to make it back under enforced radio silence. He flew 66 combat missions in F-86 Sabres in Korea and shot down two MiG-15 aircraft.

The first MiG-15 he shot down was on May 14, 1953. Aldrin was flying about south of the Yalu River, when he saw two MiG-15 fighters below him. Aldrin opened fire on one of the MiGs, whose pilot may never have seen him coming. The June 8, 1953, issue of &quot;Life&quot; magazine featured gun camera footage taken by Aldrin of the pilot ejecting from his damaged aircraft.
Aldrin&#x27;s second aerial victory came on June 4, 1953, when he accompanied aircraft from the 39th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron in an attack on an airbase in North Korea. Their newer aircraft were faster than his and he had trouble keeping up. He then spotted a MiG approaching from above. This time, Aldrin and his opponent spotted each other at about the same time. They went through a series of scissor maneuvers, attempting to get behind the other. Aldrin was first to do so, but his gun sight jammed. He then manually sighted his gun and fired. He then had to pull out, as the two aircraft had gotten too low for the dogfight to continue. Aldrin saw the MiG&#x27;s canopy open and the pilot eject, although Aldrin was uncertain whether there was sufficient time for a parachute to open. For his service in Korea, he was awarded two Distinguished Flying Crosses and three Air Medals.

Aldrin&#x27;s year-long tour ended in December 1953, by which time the fighting in Korea had ended. Aldrin was assigned as an aerial gunnery instructor at Nellis. In December 1954 he became an aide-de-camp to Brigadier General Don Z. Zimmerman, the Dean of Faculty at the nascent United States Air Force Academy, which opened in 1955. That same year, he graduated from the Squadron Officer School at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama. From 1956 to 1959 he flew F-100 Super Sabres equipped with nuclear weapons as a flight commander in the 22nd Fighter Squadron, 36th Fighter Wing, stationed at Bitburg Air Base in West Germany. Among his squadron colleagues was Ed White, who had been a year behind him at West Point. After White left West Germany to study for a master&#x27;s degree at the University of Michigan in aeronautical engineering, he wrote to Aldrin encouraging him to do the same.
Through the Air Force Institute of Technology, Aldrin enrolled as a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1959 intending to earn a master&#x27;s degree. Richard Battin was the professor for his astrodynamics class. Two other USAF officers who later became astronauts, David Scott and Edgar Mitchell, took the course around this time. Another USAF officer, Charles Duke, also took the course and wrote his 1964 master&#x27;s degree at MIT under the supervision of Laurence R. Young.

Aldrin enjoyed the classwork and soon decided to pursue a doctorate instead. In January 1963, he earned a Sc.D. degree in astronautics. His doctoral thesis was &quot;Line-of-Sight Guidance Techniques for Manned Orbital Rendezvous&quot;, the dedication of which read: &quot;In the hopes that this work may in some way contribute to their exploration of space, this is dedicated to the crew members of this country&#x27;s present and future manned space programs. If only I could join them in their exciting endeavors!&quot; Aldrin chose his doctoral thesis in the hope that it would help him be selected as an astronaut, although it meant foregoing test pilot training, which was a prerequisite at the time.

After completing his doctorate Aldrin was assigned to the Gemini Target Office of the Air Force Space Systems Division in Los Angeles, working with the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation on enhancing the maneuver capabilities of the Agena target vehicle which was to be used by NASA&#x27;s Project Gemini. He was then posted to the Space Systems Division&#x27;s field office at NASA&#x27;s Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston, where he was involved in integrating Department of Defense experiments into Project Gemini flights.

== NASA career ==
Aldrin initially applied to join the astronaut corps when NASA&#x27;s Astronaut Group 2 was selected in 1962. His application was rejected on the grounds that he was not a test pilot. Aldrin was aware of the requirement and asked for a waiver but the request was turned down. On May 15, 1963, NASA announced another round of selections, this time with the requirement that applicants had either test pilot experience or 1,000 hours of flying time in jet aircraft. Aldrin had over 2,500 hours of flying time, of which 2,200 was in jets. His selection as one of fourteen members of NASA&#x27;s Astronaut Group 3 was announced on October 18, 1963. This made him the first astronaut with a doctoral degree which, combined with his expertise in orbital mechanics, earned him the nickname &quot;Dr. Rendezvous&quot; from his fellow astronauts. Although Aldrin was both the most educated and the rendezvous expert in the astronaut corps, he was aware that the nickname was not always intended as a compliment. Upon completion of initial training, each new astronaut was assigned a field of expertise; in Aldrin&#x27;s case, it was mission planning, trajectory analysis, and flight plans.

=== Gemini program ===
Jim Lovell and Aldrin were selected as the backup crew of Gemini 10, commander and pilot respectively. Backup crews usually became the prime crew of the third following mission, but the last scheduled mission in the program was Gemini 12. The February 28, 1966, deaths of the Gemini 9 prime crew, Elliot See and Charles Bassett, in an air crash, led to Lovell and Aldrin being moved up one mission to backup for Gemini 9, which put them in position as prime crew for Gemini 12. They were designated its prime crew on June 17, 1966, with Gordon Cooper and Gene Cernan as their backups.

==== Gemini 12 ====
Initially, Gemini 12&#x27;s mission objectives were uncertain. As the last scheduled mission, it was primarily intended to complete tasks that had not been successfully or fully carried out on earlier missions. While NASA had successfully performed rendezvous during Project Gemini, the gravity-gradient stabilization test on Gemini 11 was unsuccessful. NASA also had concerns about extravehicular activity (EVA). Cernan on Gemini9 and Richard Gordon on Gemini11 had suffered from fatigue carrying out tasks during EVA, but Michael Collins had a successful EVA on Gemini 10, which suggested that the order in which he had performed his tasks was an important factor.

It therefore fell to Aldrin to complete Gemini&#x27;s EVA goals. NASA formed a committee to give him a better chance of success. It dropped the test of the Air Force&#x27;s astronaut maneuvering unit (AMU) that had given Gordon trouble on Gemini11 so Aldrin could focus on EVA. NASA revamped the training program, opting for underwater training over parabolic flight. Aircraft flying a parabolic trajectory had given astronauts an experience of weightlessness in training, but there was a delay between each parabola which gave astronauts several minutes of rest. It also encouraged performing tasks quickly, whereas in space they had to be done slowly and deliberately. Training in a viscous, buoyant fluid gave a better simulation. NASA also placed additional handholds on the capsule, which were increased from nine on Gemini9 to 44 on Gemini12, and created workstations where he could anchor his feet.
Gemini 12&#x27;s main objectives were to rendezvous with a target vehicle, and fly the spacecraft and target vehicle together using gravity-gradient stabilization, perform docked maneuvers using the Agena propulsion system to change orbit, conduct a tethered stationkeeping exercise and three EVAs, and demonstrate an automatic reentry. Gemini12 also carried 14 scientific, medical, and technological experiments. It was not a trailblazing mission; rendezvous from above had already been successfully performed by Gemini 9, and the tethered vehicle exercise by Gemini 11. Even gravity-gradient stabilization had been attempted by Gemini 11, albeit unsuccessfully.

Gemini12 was launched from Launch Complex 19 at Cape Canaveral on 20:46 UTC on November 11, 1966. The Gemini Agena Target Vehicle had been launched about an hour and a half before. The mission&#x27;s first major objective was to rendezvous with this target vehicle. As the target and Gemini12 capsule drew closer together, radar contact between the two deteriorated until it became unusable, forcing the crew to rendezvous manually. Aldrin used a sextant and rendezvous charts he helped create to give Lovell the right information to put the spacecraft in position to dock with the target vehicle. Gemini12 achieved the fourth docking with an Agena target vehicle.

The next task was to practice undocking and docking again. On undocking, one of the three latches caught, and Lovell had to use the Gemini&#x27;s thrusters to free the spacecraft. Aldrin then docked again successfully a few minutes later. The flight plan then called for the Agena main engine to be fired to take the docked spacecraft into a higher orbit, but eight minutes after the Agena had been launched, it had suffered a loss of chamber pressure. The Mission and Flight Directors therefore decided not to risk the main engine. This would be the only mission objective that was not achieved. Instead, the Agena&#x27;s secondary propulsion system was used to allow the spacecraft to view the solar eclipse of November 12, 1966, over South America, which Lovell and Aldrin photographed through the spacecraft windows.

Aldrin performed three EVAs. The first was a standup EVA on November 12, in which the spacecraft door was opened and he stood up, but did not leave the spacecraft. The standup EVA mimicked some of the actions he would do during his free-flight EVA, so he could compare the effort expended between the two. It set an EVA record of two hours and twenty minutes. The next day Aldrin performed his free-flight EVA. He climbed across the newly installed hand-holds to the Agena and installed the cable needed for the gravity-gradient stabilization experiment. Aldrin performed numerous tasks, including installing electrical connectors and testing tools that would be needed for Project Apollo. A dozen two-minute rest periods prevented him from becoming fatigued. His second EVA concluded after two hours and six minutes. A third, 55-minute standup EVA was conducted on November 14, during which Aldrin took photographs, conducted experiments, and discarded some unneeded items.

On November 15, the crew initiated the automatic reentry system and splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean, where they were picked up by a helicopter, which took them to the awaiting aircraft carrier . After the mission, his wife realized he had fallen into a depression, something she had not seen before.

=== Apollo program ===

Lovell and Aldrin were assigned to an Apollo crew with Neil Armstrong as commander, Lovell as command module pilot (CMP), and Aldrin as lunar module pilot (LMP). Their assignment as the backup crew of Apollo 9 was announced on November 20, 1967. Due to design and manufacturing delays in the lunar module (LM), Apollo 8 and Apollo9 swapped prime and backup crews, and Armstrong&#x27;s crew became the backup for Apollo 8. Under the normal crew rotation scheme, Armstrong was expected to command Apollo 11.
Michael Collins, the CMP on the Apollo8 prime crew, required surgery to remove a bone spur on his spine. Lovell took his place on the Apollo8 crew. When Collins recovered he joined Armstrong&#x27;s crew as CMP. In the meantime, Fred Haise filled in as backup LMP, and Aldrin as backup CMP for Apollo 8. While the CMP usually occupied the center couch on launch, Aldrin occupied it rather than Collins, as he had already been trained to operate its console on liftoff before Collins arrived.

Apollo11 was the second American space mission made up entirely of astronauts who had already flown in space, the first being Apollo 10. The next would not be flown until STS-26 in 1988. Deke Slayton, who was responsible for astronaut flight assignments, gave Armstrong the option to replace Aldrin with Lovell, since some thought Aldrin was difficult to work with. Armstrong thought it over for a day before declining. He had no issues working with Aldrin, and thought Lovell deserved his own command.

Early versions of the EVA checklist had the lunar module pilot as the first to step onto the lunar surface. However, when Aldrin learned that this might be amended, he lobbied within NASA for the original procedure to be followed. Multiple factors contributed to the final decision, including the physical positioning of the astronauts within the compact lunar lander, which made it easier for Armstrong to be the first to exit the spacecraft. Furthermore, there was little support for Aldrin&#x27;s views among senior astronauts who would command later Apollo missions. Collins has commented that he thought Aldrin &quot;resents not being first on the Moon more than he appreciates being second&quot;.
Aldrin and Armstrong did not have time to perform much geological training. The first lunar landing focused more on landing on the Moon and making it safely back to Earth than the scientific aspects of the mission. The duo was briefed by NASA and USGS geologists. They made one geological field trip to West Texas. The press followed them, and a helicopter made it hard for Aldrin and Armstrong to hear their instructor.

==== Apollo 11 ====
On the morning of July 16, 1969, an estimated one million spectators watched the launch of Apollo11 from the highways and beaches in the vicinity of Cape Canaveral, Florida. The launch was televised live in 33 countries, with an estimated 25 million viewers in the United States alone. Millions more listened to radio broadcasts. Propelled by a Saturn V rocket, Apollo11 lifted off from Launch Complex 39 at the Kennedy Space Center on July 16, 1969, at 13:32:00 UTC (9:32:00 EDT), and entered Earth orbit twelve minutes later. After one and a half orbits, the S-IVB third-stage engine pushed the spacecraft onto its trajectory toward the Moon. About thirty minutes later, the transposition, docking, and extraction maneuver was performed: this involved separating the command module &quot;Columbia&quot; from the spent S-IVB stage; turning around; and docking with, and extracting, the lunar module &quot;Eagle&quot;. The combined spacecraft then headed for the Moon, while the S-IVB stage continued on a trajectory past the Moon.
On July 19 at 17:21:50 UTC, Apollo11 passed behind the Moon and fired its service propulsion engine to enter lunar orbit. In the thirty orbits that followed, the crew saw passing views of their landing site in the southern Sea of Tranquillity about southwest of the crater Sabine D. At 12:52:00 UTC on July 20, Aldrin and Armstrong entered &quot;Eagle&quot;, and began the final preparations for lunar descent. At 17:44:00 &quot;Eagle&quot; separated from the &quot;Columbia&quot;. Collins, alone aboard &quot;Columbia&quot;, inspected &quot;Eagle&quot; as it pirouetted before him to ensure the craft was not damaged and that the landing gear had correctly deployed.

Throughout the descent, Aldrin called out navigation data to Armstrong, who was busy piloting the &quot;Eagle&quot;. Five minutes into the descent burn, and above the surface of the Moon, the LM guidance computer (LGC) distracted the crew with the first of several unexpected alarms that indicated that it could not complete all its tasks in real time and had to postpone some of them. Due to the 1202/1201 program alarms caused by spurious rendezvous radar inputs to the LGC, Armstrong manually landed the &quot;Eagle&quot; instead of using the computer&#x27;s autopilot. The &quot;Eagle&quot; landed at 20:17:40 UTC on Sunday July 20 with about 25 seconds of fuel left.

As a Presbyterian elder, Aldrin was the first and only person to hold a religious ceremony on the Moon. He radioed Earth: &quot;I&#x27;d like to take this opportunity to ask every person listening in, whoever and wherever they may be, to pause for a moment and contemplate the events of the past few hours, and to give thanks in his or her own way.&quot; Using a kit given to him by his pastor, he took communion and read Jesus&#x27;s words from the New Testament&#x27;s John 15:5, as Aldrin records it: &quot;I am the vine. You are the branches. Whoever remains in me, and I in him, will bear much fruit; for you can do nothing without me.&quot; But he kept this ceremony secret because of a lawsuit over the reading of Genesis on Apollo 8. In 1970 he commented: &quot;It was interesting to think that the very first liquid ever poured on the Moon, and the first food eaten there, were communion elements.&quot;

On reflection in his 2009 book, Aldrin said, &quot;Perhaps, if I had it to do over again, I would not choose to celebrate communion. Although it was a deeply meaningful experience for me, it was a Christian sacrament, and we had come to the moon in the name of all mankind – be they Christians, Jews, Muslims, animists, agnostics, or atheists. But at the time I could think of no better way to acknowledge the enormity of the Apollo11 experience than by giving thanks to God.&quot; Aldrin shortly hit upon a more universally human reference on the voyage back to Earth by publicly broadcasting his reading of the Old Testament&#x27;s Psalm 8:3–4, as Aldrin records: &quot;When I considered the heavens, the work of Thy fingers, the moon and the stars which Thou hast ordained, what is man that Thou art mindful of him.&quot; Photos of these liturgical documents reveal the conflict&#x27;s development as Aldrin expresses faith.
Preparations for the EVA began at 23:43. Once Armstrong and Aldrin were ready to go outside, &quot;Eagle&quot; was depressurized, and the hatch was opened at 02:39:33 on July 21. Aldrin set foot on the Moon at 03:15:16 on July 21, 1969 (UTC), nineteen minutes after Armstrong first touched the surface. Armstrong and Aldrin became the first and second people, respectively, to walk on the Moon. Aldrin&#x27;s first words after he set foot on the Moon were &quot;Beautiful view&quot;, to which Armstrong asked &quot;Isn&#x27;t that something? Magnificent sight out here.&quot; Aldrin answered, &quot;Magnificent desolation.&quot; Aldrin and Armstrong had trouble erecting the Lunar Flag Assembly, but with some effort secured it into the surface. Aldrin saluted the flag while Armstrong photographed the scene. Aldrin positioned himself in front of the video camera and began experimenting with different locomotion methods to move about the lunar surface to aid future moonwalkers. During these experiments, President Nixon called the duo to congratulate them on the successful landing. Nixon closed with, &quot;Thank you very much, and all of us look forward to seeing you on the &quot;Hornet&quot; on Thursday.&quot; Aldrin replied, &quot;I look forward to that very much, sir.&quot;

After the call, Aldrin began photographing and inspecting the spacecraft to document and verify its condition before their flight. Aldrin and Armstrong then set up a seismometer, to detect moonquakes, and a laser beam reflector. While Armstrong inspected a crater, Aldrin began the difficult task of hammering a metal tube into the surface to obtain a core sample. Most of the iconic photographs of an astronaut on the Moon taken by the Apollo11 astronauts are of Aldrin; Armstrong appears in just two color photographs. &quot;As the sequence of lunar operations evolved,&quot; Aldrin explained, &quot;Neil had the camera most of the time, and the majority of the pictures taken on the Moon that include an astronaut are of me. It wasn&#x27;t until we were back on Earth and in the Lunar Receiving Laboratory looking over the pictures that we realized there were few pictures of Neil. My fault perhaps, but we had never simulated this during our training.&quot;

Aldrin reentered &quot;Eagle&quot; first but, as he tells it, before ascending the module&#x27;s ladder he became the first person to urinate on the Moon. With some difficulty they lifted film and two sample boxes containing of lunar surface material to the hatch using a flat cable pulley device. Armstrong reminded Aldrin of a bag of memorial items in his sleeve pocket, and Aldrin tossed the bag down. It contained a mission patch for the Apollo 1 flight that Ed White never flew due to his death in a cabin fire during the launch rehearsal; medallions commemorating Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space (who had died the previous year in a test flight accident), and Vladimir Komarov, the first man to die in a space flight, and a silicon disk etched with goodwill messages from 73 nations. After transferring to LM life support, the explorers lightened the ascent stage for the return to lunar orbit by tossing out their backpacks, lunar overshoes, an empty Hasselblad camera, and other equipment. The hatch was closed again at 05:01, and they repressurized the lunar module and settled down to sleep.
At 17:54 UTC, they lifted off in &quot;Eagle&quot; ascent stage to rejoin Collins aboard &quot;Columbia&quot; in lunar orbit. After rendezvous with &quot;Columbia&quot;, the ascent stage was jettisoned into lunar orbit, and &quot;Columbia&quot; made its way back to Earth. It splashed down in the Pacific east of Wake Island at 16:50 UTC (05:50 local time) on July 24. The total mission duration was 195 hours, 18 minutes, 35 seconds.

Bringing back pathogens from the lunar surface was considered a possibility, albeit remote, so divers passed biological isolation garments (BIGs) to the astronauts, and assisted them into the life raft. The astronauts were winched on board the recovery helicopter, and flown to the aircraft carrier , where they spent the first part of the Earth-based portion of 21 days of quarantine. On August 13, the three astronauts rode in ticker-tape parades in their honor in New York and Chicago, attended by an estimated six million people. An official state dinner that evening in Los Angeles celebrated the flight. President Richard Nixon honored each of them with the highest American civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom (with distinction).

On September 16, 1969, the astronauts addressed a joint session of Congress where they thanked the representatives for their past support and implored them to continue funding the space effort. The astronauts embarked on a 38-day world tour on September 29 that brought the astronauts to 22 foreign countries and included visits with leaders of multiple countries. The last leg of the tour included Australia, South Korea, and Japan; the crew returned to the US on November 5, 1969.

After Apollo 11, Aldrin was kept busy giving speeches and making public appearances. In October 1970, he joined Soviet cosmonauts Andriyan Nikolayev and Vitaly Sevastyanov on their tour of the NASA space centers. He was also involved in the design of the Space Shuttle. With the Apollo program coming to an end, Aldrin, now a colonel, saw few prospects at NASA, and decided to return to the Air Force on July 1, 1971. During his NASA career, he had spent 289 hours and 53 minutes in space, of which 7 hours and 52 minutes was in EVA.

== Post-NASA activities ==
=== Aerospace Research Pilot School ===

Aldrin hoped to become Commandant of Cadets at the United States Air Force Academy, but the job went to his West Point classmate Hoyt S. Vandenberg Jr. Aldrin was made Commandant of the USAF Aerospace Research Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, California. Aldrin had neither managerial nor test pilot experience, but a third of the training curriculum was devoted to astronaut training and students flew a modified F-104 Starfighter to the edge of space. Fellow Group 3 astronaut and moonwalker Alan Bean considered him well qualified for the job.

Aldrin did not get along well with his superior, Brigadier General Robert M. White, who had earned his USAF astronaut wings flying the X-15. Aldrin&#x27;s celebrity status led people to defer to him more than the higher-ranking general. There were two crashes at Edwards, of an A-7 Corsair II and a T-33. No people died, but the aircraft were destroyed and the accidents were attributed to insufficient supervision, which placed the blame on Aldrin. What he had hoped would be an enjoyable job became a highly stressful one.

Aldrin went to see the base surgeon. In addition to signs of depression, he experienced neck and shoulder pains, and hoped that the latter might explain the former. He was hospitalized for depression at Wilford Hall Medical Center for four weeks. His mother had committed suicide in May 1968, and he was plagued with guilt that his fame after Gemini12 had contributed. His mother&#x27;s father had also committed suicide, and he believed he inherited depression from them. At the time there was great stigma related to mental illness and he was aware that it could not only be career-ending, but could result in his being ostracized socially.

In February 1972, General George S. Brown paid a visit to Edwards and informed Aldrin that the USAF Aerospace Research Pilot School was being renamed the USAF Test Pilot School and the astronaut training was being dropped. With the Apollo program winding down, and Air Force budgets being cut, the Air Force&#x27;s interest in space diminished. Aldrin elected to retire as a colonel on March 1, 1972, after 21 years of service. His father and General Jimmy Doolittle, a close friend of his father, attended the formal retirement ceremony.

=== Post retirement ===
Aldrin&#x27;s father died on December 28, 1974, from complications following a heart attack. Aldrin&#x27;s autobiographies, &quot;Return to Earth&quot; (1973) and &quot;Magnificent Desolation&quot; (2009), recounted his struggles with clinical depression and alcoholism in the years after leaving NASA. Encouraged by a therapist to take a regular job, Aldrin worked selling used cars, at which he had no talent. Periods of hospitalization and sobriety alternated with bouts of heavy drinking. Eventually he was arrested for disorderly conduct. Finally, in October 1978, he quit drinking for good. Aldrin attempted to help others with drinking problems, including actor William Holden. Holden&#x27;s girlfriend Stefanie Powers had portrayed Marianne, a woman with whom Aldrin had an affair, in the 1976 TV movie version of &quot;Return to Earth&quot;. Aldrin was saddened by Holden&#x27;s alcohol-related death in 1981.

=== Bart Sibrel incident ===
On September 9, 2002, Aldrin was lured to a Beverly Hills hotel on the pretext of being interviewed for a Japanese children&#x27;s television show on the subject of space. When he arrived, Moon landing conspiracy theorist Bart Sibrel accosted him with a film crew and demanded he swear on a Bible that the Moon landings were not faked. After a brief confrontation, during which Sibrel followed Aldrin despite being told to leave him alone, and called him &quot;a coward, a liar, and a thief&quot; the 72-year-old Aldrin punched Sibrel in the jaw, which was caught on camera by Sibrel&#x27;s film crew. Aldrin said he had acted to defend himself and his stepdaughter. Witnesses said Sibrel had aggressively poked Aldrin with a Bible. Additional mitigating factors were that Sibrel sustained no visible injury and did not seek medical attention, and that Aldrin had no criminal record. The police declined to press charges against Aldrin.

=== Detached adapter panel sighting ===
In 2005, while being interviewed for a Science Channel documentary titled &quot;First on the Moon: The Untold Story&quot;, Aldrin told an interviewer the Apollo 11 crew had seen an unidentified flying object (UFO). The documentary makers omitted the crew&#x27;s conclusion that they probably saw one of the four detached spacecraft adapter panels from the upper stage of the SaturnV rocket. The panels had been jettisoned before the separation maneuver so they closely followed the spacecraft until the first mid-course correction. When Aldrin appeared on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; on August 15, 2007, Stern asked him about the supposed UFO sighting. Aldrin confirmed that there was no such sighting of anything deemed extraterrestrial and said they were, and are, &quot;99.9 percent&quot; sure the object was the detached panel. According to Aldrin his words had been taken out of context. He made a request to the Science Channel to make a correction, but was refused.

=== Polar expedition ===
In December 2016, Aldrin was part of a tourist group visiting the Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station in Antarctica when he fell ill and was evacuated, first to McMurdo Station and from there to Christchurch, New Zealand. At 86 years of age, Aldrin&#x27;s visit made him the oldest person to reach the South Pole. He had traveled to the North Pole in 1998.

== Mission to Mars advocacy ==

After leaving NASA, Aldrin continued to advocate for space exploration. In 1985 he joined the University of North Dakota (UND)&#x27;s College of Aerospace Sciences at the invitation of John D. Odegard, the dean of the college. Aldrin helped to develop UND&#x27;s Space Studies program and brought David Webb from NASA to serve as the department&#x27;s first chair. To further promote space exploration, and to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the first lunar landing, Aldrin teamed up with Snoop Dogg, Quincy Jones, Talib Kweli, and Soulja Boy to create the rap single and video &quot;Rocket Experience&quot;, proceeds from which were donated to Aldrin&#x27;s non-profit foundation, ShareSpace. He is also a member of the Mars Society&#x27;s Steering committee.

In 1985, Aldrin proposed a special spacecraft trajectory now known as the Aldrin cycler. Cycler trajectories offer reduced cost of repeated travel to Mars by using less propellant. The Aldrin cycler provided a five and a half month journey from the Earth to Mars, with a return trip to Earth of the same duration on a twin cycler orbit. Aldrin continues to research this concept with engineers from Purdue University. In 1996 Aldrin founded Starcraft Boosters, Inc. (SBI) to design reusable rocket launchers.

In December 2003, Aldrin published an opinion piece in &quot;The New York Times&quot; criticizing NASA&#x27;s objectives. In it, he voiced concern about NASA&#x27;s development of a spacecraft &quot;limited to transporting four astronauts at a time with little or no cargo carrying capability&quot; and declared the goal of sending astronauts back to the Moon was &quot;more like reaching for past glory than striving for new triumphs&quot;.

In a June 2013 opinion piece in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Aldrin supported a human mission to Mars and which viewed the Moon &quot;not as a destination but more a point of departure, one that places humankind on a trajectory to homestead Mars and become a two-planet species.&quot; In August 2015, Aldrin, in association with the Florida Institute of Technology, presented a master plan to NASA for consideration where astronauts, with a tour of duty of ten years, establish a colony on Mars before the year 2040.

== Awards and honors ==

Aldrin was awarded the Air Force Distinguished Service Medal (DSM) in 1969 for his role as lunar module pilot on Apollo 11. He was awarded an oak leaf cluster in 1972 in lieu of a second DSM for his role in both the Korean War and in the space program, and the Legion of Merit for his role in the Gemini and Apollo programs. During a 1966 ceremony marking the end of the Gemini program, Aldrin was awarded the NASA Exceptional Service Medal by President Johnson at LBJ Ranch. He was awarded the NASA Distinguished Service Medal in 1970 for the Apollo11 mission. Aldrin was one of ten Gemini astronauts inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame in 1982. He was also inducted into the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame in 1993, the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 2000, and the New Jersey Hall of Fame in 2008.
The &quot;Toy Story&quot; character Buzz Lightyear was named in honor of Buzz Aldrin.

In 1999, while celebrating the 30th anniversary of the lunar landing, Vice President Al Gore, who was also the vice-chancellor of the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s Board of Regents, presented the Apollo11 crew with the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s Langley Gold Medal for aviation. After the ceremony, the crew went to the White House and presented President Bill Clinton with an encased Moon rock. The Apollo11 crew was awarded the New Frontier Congressional Gold Medal in the Capitol Rotunda in 2011. During the ceremony, NASA administrator Charles Bolden said, &quot;Those of us who have had the privilege to fly in space followed the trail they forged.&quot;
The Apollo11 crew were awarded the Collier Trophy in 1969. The National Aeronautic Association president awarded a duplicate trophy to Collins and Aldrin at a ceremony. The crew was awarded the 1969 General Thomas D. White USAF Space Trophy. The National Space Club named the crew the winners of the 1970 Dr. Robert H. Goddard Memorial Trophy, awarded annually for the greatest achievement in spaceflight. They received the international Harmon Trophy for aviators in 1970, conferred to them by Vice President Spiro Agnew in 1971. Agnew also presented them the Hubbard Medal of the National Geographic Society in 1970. He told them, &quot;You&#x27;ve won a place alongside Christopher Columbus in American history&quot;. In 1970, the Apollo11 team were co-winners of the Iven C. Kincheloe award from the Society of Experimental Test Pilots along with Darryl Greenamyer who broke the world speed record for piston engine airplanes. For contributions to the television industry, they were honored with round plaques on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

In 2001, President George W. Bush appointed Aldrin to the Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry. Aldrin received the 2003 Humanitarian Award from Variety, the Children&#x27;s Charity, which, according to the organization, &quot;is given to an individual who has shown unusual understanding, empathy, and devotion to mankind.&quot; In 2006, the Space Foundation awarded him its highest honor, the General James E. Hill Lifetime Space Achievement Award.

Aldrin received honorary degrees from six colleges and universities, and was named as the Chancellor of the International Space University in 2015. He was a member of the National Space Society&#x27;s Board of Governors, and has served as the organization&#x27;s chairman. In 2016, his hometown middle school in Montclair, New Jersey, was renamed Buzz Aldrin Middle School. The Aldrin crater on the Moon near the Apollo11 landing site and Asteroid 6470 Aldrin are named in his honor.

In 2019, Aldrin was awarded the Starmus Festival&#x27;s Stephen Hawking Medal for Science Communication for Lifetime Achievement. On his 93rd birthday he was honored by Living Legends of Aviation. On May 5, 2023, he received an honorary promotion to the rank of brigadier general in the United States Air Force, as well as being made an honorary Space Force guardian.

== Personal life ==
=== Marriages and children ===

Aldrin has been married four times. His first marriage was on December 29, 1954, to Joan Archer, a Rutgers University and Columbia University alumna with a master&#x27;s degree. They had three children, James, Janice and Andrew. They filed for divorce in 1974. His second wife was Beverly Van Zile, whom he married on December 31, 1975, and divorced in 1978. His third wife was Lois Driggs Cannon, whom he married on February 14, 1988. Their divorce was finalized in December 2012. The settlement included 50percent of their $475,000 bank account and $9,500 a month plus 30percent of his annual income, estimated at more than $600,000. he had one grandson, Jeffrey Schuss, born to his daughter Janice, and three great-grandsons and one great-granddaughter.

In 2018, Aldrin was involved in a legal dispute with his children Andrew and Janice and former business manager Christina Korp over their claims that he was mentally impaired through dementia and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. His children alleged that he made new friends who were alienating him from the family and encouraging him to spend his savings at a high rate. They sought to be named legal guardians so they could control his finances. In June, Aldrin filed a lawsuit against Andrew, Janice, Korp, and businesses and foundations run by the family. Aldrin alleged that Janice was not acting in his financial interest and that Korp was exploiting the elderly. He sought to remove Andrew&#x27;s control of Aldrin&#x27;s social media accounts, finances, and businesses. The situation ended when his children withdrew their petition and he dropped the lawsuit in March 2019, several months before the 50th anniversary of the Apollo11 mission.

On January 20, 2023, his 93rd birthday, Aldrin announced on Twitter that he had married for the fourth time, to his 63-year-old companion, Anca Faur.

=== Politics ===

Aldrin is an active supporter of the Republican Party, headlining fundraisers for its members of Congress and endorsing its candidates. He appeared at a rally for George W. Bush in 2004 and campaigned for Paul Rancatore in Florida in 2008, Mead Treadwell in Alaska in 2014 and Dan Crenshaw in Texas in 2018. He appeared at the 2019 State of the Union Address as a guest of President Donald Trump.

In the 2024 Presidential Election, he endorsed Donald Trump. Aldrin cited Trump&#x27;s promotion of space exploration policy as a reason for his endorsement, claiming that interest in it has waned in previous years. He was quoted with saying &quot;For me, for the future of our Nation, to meet enormous challenges, and for the proven policy accomplishments above, I believe the nation is best served by voting for Donald J. Trump&quot;. He added, &quot;I wholeheartedly endorse him for President of the United States. Godspeed President Trump, and God Bless the United States of America&quot;.

=== Freemasonry ===
Buzz Aldrin is the first Freemason to set foot on the Moon. Aldrin was initiated into Freemasonry at Oak Park Lodge No. 864 in Alabama and raised at Lawrence N. Greenleaf Lodge, No. 169 in Colorado.

By the time Aldrin stepped onto the lunar surface, he was a member of two Masonic lodges: Montclair Lodge No. 144 in New Jersey and Clear Lake Lodge No. 1417 in Seabrook, Texas, where he was invited to serve on the High Council and was ordained in the 33rd degree of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite.

Aldrin is also a member of York Rite and Arabia Shrine Temple of Houston.

=== Other ===
In 2007, Aldrin confirmed to &quot;Time&quot; magazine that he had recently had a face-lift, joking that the g-forces he was exposed to in space &quot;caused a sagging jowl that needed some attention&quot;.

Following the 2012 death of his Apollo11 colleague Neil Armstrong, Aldrin said he was

Aldrin has primarily resided in the Los Angeles area, including Beverly Hills and Laguna Beach since 1985. In 2014, he sold his Westwood condominium; this was after his third divorce in 2012. He also lives in Satellite Beach, Florida.

Aldrin has been a teetotaler since 1978.

<text>Vladimir Mikhaylovich Komarov (, ; 16 March 1927 – 24 April 1967) was a Soviet test pilot, aerospace engineer, and cosmonaut. In October 1964, he commanded Voskhod 1, the first spaceflight to carry more than one crew member. He became the first Soviet cosmonaut to fly in space twice when he was selected as the solo pilot of Soyuz 1, its first crewed test flight. A parachute failure caused his Soyuz capsule to crash into the ground after re-entry on 24 April 1967, making him the first human to die in a space flight.

He was declared medically unfit for training or spaceflight twice while in the program but continued playing an active role. During his time at the cosmonaut training center, he contributed to space vehicle design, cosmonaut training, evaluation and public relations.

==Early life==
Komarov was born on 16 March 1927 in Moscow and grew up with his half-sister Matilda (born in 1915). His father was a labourer who worked at various low-paid jobs to support the family. In 1935, Komarov began his formal education in the local elementary school. Here he showed a natural aptitude for mathematics. In 1941, Komarov left school because of World War II and the German invasion of the Soviet Union, and he became a laborer on a collective farm. He showed an interest in aeronautics from an early age, and he collected magazines and pictures about aviation, in addition to making model aircraft and his own propeller. At the age of fifteen in 1942, Komarov entered the &quot;1st Moscow Special Air Force School&quot; to pursue his dream of becoming an aviator. Shortly thereafter, his family learned that Komarov&#x27;s father had been killed in an &quot;unknown war action&quot;. Of necessity because of the German invasion, the flight school was soon moved to the Tyumen region in Siberia for the duration of the war. Students there learned a wide variety of subjects besides aviation—including zoology and foreign languages. In 1945, Komarov graduated from flight school with honors. World War II hostilities ended before Komarov was called on to enter combat.

In 1946, Komarov completed his first year of training at the Chkalov Higher Air Force School in Borisoglebsk in Voronezh Oblast. He then completed his training at the A.K. Serov Military Aviation College in Bataisk. Komarov&#x27;s mother died in 1948, seven months before his graduation in 1949, at which he received his pilot&#x27;s wings and commission as a lieutenant in the Soviet Air Force.

==Career in the Soviet Air Force==

In December 1949, Komarov served as the pilot of a fighter plane with the 383rd Regiment of the 42nd North Caucasian Fighter Air Division that was based in Grozny.

Komarov married Valentina Yakovlevna Kiselyova in October 1950. He was promoted to senior lieutenant in 1952, and he was later assigned as the chief pilot of the 486th Fighter Aviation Regiment of the 279th Fighter Air Division in the Prikarpate Region. Komarov continued to fly in that position until 1954, and then he enrolled in an engineering course at the Zhukovsky Air Force Engineering Academy. In 1959, Komarov was promoted to the rank of senior engineer-lieutenant. Later that year he achieved his goal of becoming a test pilot at the Central Scientific Research Institute at Chkalovsky.

==Cosmonaut selection==

===Air Force Group One===
In September 1959, Komarov was promoted to engineer-captain and invited to participate in the selection process for cosmonaut candidate along with approximately 3,000 other pilots. He was one of twenty candidates selected for &quot;Air Force Group One&quot;; he and the others reported to the newly formed TsPK (Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center) just outside Moscow for assignment on 13 March 1960.

Although eminently qualified, Komarov was not chosen in the top six candidates, because he did not meet the age, height, and weight restrictions specified by the Chief Designer of Russia&#x27;s space program, Sergei Korolev. &quot;If the criteria had been different,&quot; the cosmonaut trainer Mark Gallai noted in an interview, &quot;Certainly Komarov, who was very intelligent, would have been in the group. He had Air Force Academy flight experience. He greatly influenced the design of the &#x27;Vostok&#x27; and [the] &#x27;Voskhod&#x27;.&quot; At age 32, Komarov was the second oldest of the pilots chosen; Korolev had specified a maximum age of 27. Only two members of the first group, Pavel Belyayev (Voskhod 2) and Komarov himself, were also graduates of the Soviet Air Force Academy. In addition, only Komarov had experience as a flight test engineer on new aircraft.

===Training===
Shortly after beginning his training Komarov was hospitalised for a minor operation in May 1960, which left him medically unfit for physical training for approximately six months. At the time, the selection criteria placed a heavy emphasis on the physical condition of cosmonauts and any imperfection led to instant disqualification. Since Komarov already held engineering qualifications, he was allowed to remain in the program after assuring the administration he would be able to catch up. He continued with the required academic studies while recovering. He returned to training in October, because his recovery was more rapid than medical staff had expected. During that time he assisted his younger peers with their academic studies; earning him the casual nickname of &quot;The Professor,&quot; which he shared with Belyayev, who was two years his senior. In 1961 the first space flights began. By 1962, Komarov was the third-highest-paid cosmonaut, due to his qualifications, rank and experience. He earned 528 rubles a month, with only cosmonauts 1 and 2, Yuri Gagarin and Gherman Titov, being more highly paid.

When Georgi Shonin demonstrated an unacceptable level of g-force susceptibility in the centrifuge, Komarov replaced him in May 1962 for planned dual Vostok missions.
Komarov was selected as back up for Pavel Popovich (Vostok 4), but subsequent routine ECG testing of Komarov revealed a heart irregularity and he was pulled from the program and replaced by Boris Volynov. The same heart irregularity grounded American astronaut Deke Slayton. After Komarov persistently lobbied medical and military personnel for re-admittance to the program, they allowed him to return to training.

In 1963, cosmonaut training was conducted in six Groups, with Komarov being selected in Group 2 with Valery Bykovsky and Volynov. This group was to train for missions of up to five days in duration scheduled for the latter part of 1963. In May 1963, Alekseyev proposed to General Kamanin that Komarov be named backup for Vostok 5 rather than Khrunov because his suit was ready. Komarov was later named in a further group for planned missions in 1964 with Belyaev, Shonin, Khrunov, Zaikin, Gorbatko, Volynov, and Leonov. The training groups were formed for later Vostok missions (Vostok 7–13), but no actual crews were assigned and the missions did not occur under the auspices of the original Vostok program. In December 1963, Komarov was shortlisted for flight by Kamanin with Volynov and Leonov, having completed two years of training.

In April 1964 Komarov was declared space-flight ready with Bykovsky, Popovich, Titov, Volynov, Leonov, Khrunov, Belyayev, and Lev Demin. From this group the commander of the planned Voskhod mission scheduled for late 1964 would be chosen. In May the group was reduced to Volynov, Komarov, Leonov and Khrunov.

During training, Komarov lived at the TsPK with his wife Valentina and their two children Yevgeny and Irina. There, he enjoyed hunting, cross country skiing, ice hockey, and other social activities with his fellow trainees in their leisure time. Komarov was well liked by his peers, who referred to him as &quot;Volodya&quot; (a diminutive of his first name). Pavel Popovich noted that Komarov was respected for his humility and experience: &quot;he was already an engineer when he joined us, but he never looked down on the others. He was warm-hearted, purposeful and industrious. Volodya&#x27;s prestige was so high that people came to him to discuss all questions: personal as well as questions of our work.&quot;
Fellow cosmonaut Alexei Leonov described him as &quot;very serious. He was a first-class test pilot.&quot;

==Spaceflights==
===Voskhod 1===

By July 1964, only seven cosmonauts remained eligible for the Voskhod crew after some were disqualified on medical grounds. On 6 July, Komarov was named as the commander of the back-up crew for Voskhod 1. After several months of much heated debate between Kamanin and Korolev over the selection of the crew, Komarov was named as prime crew commander by the State Commission on 4 October 1964, just eight days before its scheduled launch. Kamanin played tennis with the Voskhod crew that evening and noted that Komarov played poorly in comparison to his crew: Boris Yegorov and Konstantin Feoktistov.

On 9 October, Komarov and the crew inspected the Voskhod with Korolev and other members of the administration. Later that day they were interviewed by the state press and played tennis for the benefit of photographers.

On the morning of 11 October, Komarov was given various communist relics to take with him into space the following day. In the afternoon the crew again inspected the capsule and were given their final instructions by Korolev. Komarov was the only member of the crew to have undertaken extensive training and was the only member with any flight experience; the two other crewmen being civilians. His call sign was &quot;Ruby&quot; (Russian: Рубин).

During the mission Komarov performed various tasks with the other crew members, including medical and navigational tests and observing the Aurora Borealis. Komarov alone carried out tests with ion thrusters that had been attached to the Voskhod. He also made a number of radio transmissions, including a greeting to the Tokyo Olympics, which had opened on 10 October. The mission lasted just over twenty-four hours. After the crew landed safely they were flown back to the launch site at Tyuratam (also known as Baikonur to disguise its true location). Kamanin noted in his diary that while his crew were in good spirits, Komarov was fatigued. On 19 October, Komarov and his crew made reports in Red Square and attended an audience at the Kremlin. After the success of this short but scientifically important mission he was promoted to colonel. The success of the mission earned Komarov the awards of the &quot;Order of Lenin&quot; and &quot;Hero of the Soviet Union&quot;.

In December 1964, the RVSN (Strategic Rocket Forces) requested that Komarov be transferred from the VVS (Soviet Air Force) to the RVSN, in a move possibly motivated by the poor record of the RVSN in producing successful rockets compared to the VVS. The request was opposed by Kamanin.

In 1965, Komarov worked with Gagarin in supervising preparations for the flight of Voskhod 2, which carried out the first attempt of an extravehicular activity in outer space. These preparations included fitting of space suits on the cosmonauts and briefings for the spaceflight. In April of that year, Komarov toured Leningrad with Kamanin, Gagarin, Titov, Belyayev, and Leonov. Komarov also visited Petropavlovsk Fortress with Valentin Glushko where Glushko had conducted early rocket experiments in the early 1930s. In September that year, Komarov toured West Germany.

===Soyuz 1===
Komarov was assigned to the Soviet Soyuz program along with Gagarin and Leonov. In July 1966, Komarov was reprimanded by Kamanin for his unauthorised disclosure, while in Japan, that &quot;the Soviet Union will, at the scheduled time, fly an automated spacecraft around the Moon and return it to (the) Earth, to be followed by a dog flight, then a manned circumlunar flight.&quot; The following month Komarov clashed with other engineers over ongoing design problems in which zero-G tests showed that the Soyuz module hatch was too small to allow the safe exit of a fully suited cosmonaut. Meanwhile, Komarov and his fellow cosmonauts had their groups and assignments constantly revised, and they became increasingly anxious about the lack of response to their concerns about the design and manufacture of the spacecraft, which Gagarin had raised in a letter on their behalf to Leonid Brezhnev.

Komarov was selected to command the Soyuz 1, in 1967, with Gagarin as his backup cosmonaut. During the preparations for the spaceflight, both cosmonauts were working twelve- to fourteen-hour days. On orbital insertion, the solar panels of the Soyuz module failed to fully deploy thereby preventing the craft from being fully powered and obscuring some of the navigation equipment. Komarov reported: &quot;Conditions are poor. The cabin parameters are normal, but the left solar panel didn&#x27;t deploy. The electrical bus is at only 13 to 14 amperes. The HF (high frequency) communications are not working. I cannot orient the spacecraft to the sun. I tried orienting the spacecraft manually using the DO-1 orientation engines, but the pressure remaining on the DO-1 has gone down to 180.&quot; Komarov tried unsuccessfully to orient the Soyuz module for five hours. The craft was transmitting unreliable status information, and lost communications on orbits 13 through 15 due to the failure of the high frequency transmitter that should have maintained radio contact while the craft was out of range of the ultra high frequency (UHF) ground receivers.

As a result of the problems with the craft, the Soviets did not launch the second Soyuz module, from which cosmonauts were to perform an extra-vehicular activity (EVA) to the Soyuz 1, and cut the mission short.

Komarov was ordered to re-orient the craft using the ion flow sensors on orbits 15 to 17. The ion sensors failed. Komarov did not have enough time to attempt a manual re-entry until orbit 19. Manual orientation relied on using the equipped Vzor periscope device, but to do this, Komarov had to be able to see the Sun. To reach the designated landing site at Orsk, the retro-fire had to take place on the night side of the Earth. Komarov oriented the spacecraft manually on the dayside then used the gyro-platform as a reference so that he could orient the craft for a night side retro-fire. He successfully re-entered the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere on his 19th orbit, but the module&#x27;s drogue and main braking parachute failed to deploy correctly. The module crashed into the ground, killing Komarov, at 6.24 a.m.

==Response to Komarov&#x27;s death==
In his diary, Kamanin recorded that the Soyuz 1 capsule crashed into the ground at and that the remains of Komarov&#x27;s body were an irregular lump in diameter and long. Three hours after the capsule&#x27;s crash, Keldysh, Tyulin, Rudenko, and other State Commission members visited the site. At 21:45 Kamanin accompanied Komarov&#x27;s remains to the Orsk aerodrome, where they were loaded on an Il-18. Ten minutes before departure an An-12 landed with Kuznetsov and several cosmonauts. Kamanin&#x27;s aircraft arrived in Moscow in the early hours of the next morning. The aircraft had to divert to Sheremetyevo since all the other airfields around Moscow were closed to takeoffs or landings due to weather. Konstantin Vershinin&#x27;s orders were that Komarov&#x27;s remains were to be photographed, then immediately cremated so that a state burial in the Kremlin wall could take place. The remains underwent a quick autopsy that morning, then were cremated.

On 25 April, a response to Komarov&#x27;s death by his fellow cosmonauts was published in &quot;Pravda&quot;:
&quot;For the forerunners it is always more difficult. They tread the unknown paths and these paths are not straight, they have sharp turns, surprises and dangers. But anyone who takes the pathway into orbit never wants to leave it. And no matter what difficulties or obstacles there are, they are never strong enough to deflect such a man from his chosen path. While his heart beats in his chest, a cosmonaut will always continue to challenge the universe. Vladimir Komarov was one of the first on this treacherous path.&quot;

When interviewed on 17 May by the newspaper &quot;Komsomolskaya Pravda&quot;, Gagarin alluded to the failure of the administration to listen to the concerns about the Soyuz module that the cosmonaut corps had identified, and maintained that Komarov&#x27;s death should teach the establishment to be more rigorous in its testing and evaluation of &quot;all the mechanisms of the spaceship, even more attentive to all stages of checking and testing, even more vigilant in our encounter with the unknown. He has shown us how dangerous the pathway to space is. His flight and his death will teach us courage.&quot; In May 1967, Gagarin and Leonov criticised program head Vasily Mishin&#x27;s &quot;poor knowledge of the Soyuz spacecraft and the details of its operation, his lack of cooperation in working with the cosmonauts in flight and training activities,&quot; and asked Kamanin to cite him in the official crash report.

==Honours and awards==

===Posthumous honours===
On 26 April 1967, Komarov was given a state funeral in Moscow, and his ashes were interred in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis at Red Square. The American astronauts requested the Soviet government to allow a representative to attend, but were turned down.

Komarov was posthumously awarded his second Order of Lenin and also Hero of the Soviet Union.

On 25 April 1968, a memorial service was held for Komarov at the crash site near Orsk . Kamanin noted in his diary that over 10,000 people were present at this service, &quot;some driving hundreds of kilometres for the event.&quot;

Komarov has been featured on commemorative First Day Covers and stamps for his contribution to the space program—from several different countries.

Komarov is commemorated with other prominent figures from the early Russian space program with a bust on &quot;Cosmonauts Alley&quot; in Moscow, and he is also honored with a monument at the crash site near Orsk.
Before leaving the Moon on Apollo 11&#x27;s Lunar Module, Neil Armstrong&#x27;s final task was to place a small package of memorial items to honor Soviet cosmonauts Komarov, Yuri Gagarin, and the Apollo 1 astronauts Gus Grissom, Ed White, and Roger Chaffee. Komarov&#x27;s name also appears on a commemorative plaque left at Hadley Rille on the Moon by the commander of Apollo 15, David Scott in memory of 14 deceased NASA astronauts and USSR cosmonauts, along with a small sculpture entitled &quot;Fallen Astronaut&quot;, on 1 August 1971. This plaque and the sculpture represent those astronauts and cosmonauts who died in the quest to reach outer space and the Moon.

The asteroid 1836 Komarov, discovered in 1971, was named in the honor of Komarov, as was a crater on the Moon.
This asteroid and the cosmonaut inspired the composer Brett Dean to write a piece of symphonic music commissioned by conductor Simon Rattle in 2006. The composition is named &quot;Komarov&#x27;s Fall&quot;, and it can be found on the EMI Classics Album of Simon Rattle&#x27;s &quot;The Planets&quot;.

The Fédération Aéronautique Internationale&#x27;s &quot;V.M. Komarov Diploma&quot; is named in Komarov&#x27;s honor.

There was formerly a Soviet satellite-tracking ship named for Komarov, the &quot;Kosmonaut Vladimir Komarov&quot;.

==In popular culture==

Vladimir Komarov is a character in the French science fiction series &quot;Missions&quot;. The crew of a mission to Mars find Komarov decades after he was believed to have died.

<text>Ellesmere Island (; ) is Canada&#x27;s northernmost and third largest island, and the tenth largest in the world. It comprises an area of , slightly smaller than Great Britain, and the total length of the island is .

Lying within the Arctic Archipelago, Ellesmere Island is considered part of the Queen Elizabeth Islands. Cape Columbia at is the most northerly point of land in Canada and one of the most northern points of land on the planet (the most northerly point of land on Earth is the nearby Kaffeklubben Island of Greenland).

The Arctic Cordillera mountain system covers much of Ellesmere Island, making it the most mountainous in the Arctic Archipelago. More than one-fifth of the island is protected as Quttinirpaaq National Park.

In 2021, the population of Ellesmere Island was recorded at 144. There are three settlements: Alert, Eureka, and Grise Fiord. Ellesmere Island is administered as part of the Qikiqtaaluk Region in the Canadian territory of Nunavut.

==Geology==

Ellesmere Island has three major geological regions. The Grant Land Highlands is a large belt of fold mountains which dominate the northern face of the island. It is part of the Franklinian mobile belt, a zone of Cretaceous volcanic and intrusive rock. South of this is the Greely-Hazen Plateau, a large tableland composed of sedimentary and volcanic rocks. Covering most of the island, the coastal sedimentary plateau is a succession of highly eroded sedimentary peaks which are part of the Franklinian Shield with an extension of the Canadian Shield (Precambrian igneous and metamorphic rocks) in the island&#x27;s southeastern corner. In addition, there are syntectonic clastics which comprise the Ellesmere Island Volcanics of the Sverdrup Basin Magmatic Province.

A period of uplift and faulting prior to the Pleistocene epoch (&gt;2.6 Ma) established the overall features of the island. Additional uplift occurred due to isostatic rebound following the last glacial period. Land features were then shaped by erosion from glacial ice, meltwaters, and scouring by sea ice.

==History==

It is believed that each of the pre-contact peoples who migrated through the High Arctic approached Ellesmere Island from the south and west. They were able to travel along Ellesmere&#x27;s coasts or overland to Nares Strait, and some of them crossed the strait to populate Greenland.

The archaeological record of past Arctic cultures is quite complete, as artefacts deteriorate very slowly. Items exposed to the cold, dry winds become naturally freeze-dried while items that become buried are preserved in the permafrost. Artefacts are in a similar condition to when they were left or lost, and settlements abandoned thousands of years ago can be seen much as they were the day their inhabitants left. From these sites and artefacts, archaeologists have been able to construct a history of these cultures. However, the research is incomplete and only a small proportion of the details of excavations have been published.

===Small tool cultures===

The Arctic small tool tradition peoples ( Paleo-Eskimos) in the High Arctic had small populations organized as hunting bands, spread from Axel Heiberg Island to the northern extremity of Greenland, where the Independence I culture was active from 2700 BCE. On Ellesmere, they chiefly hunted in the Eureka Upland and the Hazen Plateau. Six different small-tool cultures have been identified at the Smith Sound region: Independence I, Independence I / Saqqaq, Pre-Dorset, Saqqaq, early Dorset, and late Dorset. They chiefly hunted muskoxen: more than three-quarters of their known archeological sites on Ellesmere are located in the island&#x27;s interior and their winter dwellings were skin tents, suggesting a need for mobility to follow the herds. There is evidence at Lake Hazen of a trade network , including soapstone lamps from Greenland and incised lance heads from cultures to the south.

===Thule culture===

The Thule moved into the High Arctic at the time of a warming trend, c. 1000 CE. Their major population centre was the Smith Sound area (on both the Ellesmere and Greenland sides) due to its proximity to polynyas and its position on transportation routes. From settlements at Smith Sound, the Thule sent summer hunting parties to harvest marine mammals in Nansen Strait. Their summer camps are evidenced by tent rings as far north as Archer Fiord, with clusters of stone dwellings around Lady Franklin Bay and at Lake Hazen which suggest semi-permanent occupations.

The Thule genetically and culturally completely replaced the Dorset people some time after 1300 CE. The Thule displaced the small-tool cultures, having a number of technological advantages which notably included effective weapons, kayaks and umiaks for hunting marine mammals, and sled dogs for surface transport and pursuit. The Thule also had an extensive trade network, evidenced by meteoritic iron from Greenland which was exported through Ellesmere Island to the rest of the archipelago and to the North American mainland.

More than fifty Norse artefacts have been found in Thule archeological sites on the Bache Peninsula, including pieces of chain mail. It is uncertain if Ellesmere Island was directly visited by Norse Greenlanders who sailed from the south or if the items were traded through a network of middlemen. It is also possible the items may have been taken from a shipwreck. A bronze set of scales discovered in western Ellesmere Island has been interpreted as indicating the presence of a Norse trader in the region. The Norse artefacts date from c. 1250 to 1400 CE.

Between 1400 and 1600 CE, the Little Ice Age developed and conditions for hunting became increasingly difficult, forcing the Thule to withdraw from Ellesmere and the other northern islands of the archipelago. The Thule who remained in northern Greenland became isolated, specialized at hunting a diminishing number of game animals, and lost the ability to make boats. Thus, the waters around Ellesmere were not navigated again until the arrival of large European vessels after 1800.

===Early European exploration===

Much of the initial phase of European exploration of the North American Arctic was centred on a search for the Northwest Passage and undertaken by Britain. The 1616 expedition of William Baffin were the first Europeans to record sighting the then-unnamed Ellesmere Island (Baffin named Jones and Smith Sounds on the island&#x27;s south and southeast coasts). However, the onset of the Little Ice Age interrupted the progress of explorations for two centuries.

In 1818, an ice jam in Baffin Bay broke, allowing European vessels access to the High Arctic (whalers had been active in Davis Strait, about southeast of Ellesmere, since 1719). Baffin Bay was then navigable in the summers due to the presence of an ice dam in Smith Sound, which prevented Arctic drift ice from flowing south. The other channels of the archipelago remained congested with ice.

That year, John Ross led the first recorded European expedition to Cape York, at which time there were reportedly only 140 Inughuit. (The Inughuit of North Greenland, the Kalaallit of West Greenland, and Inuit of the archipelago are descendants of the Thule culture, which had diverged during the isolation imposed by the Little Ice Age.) Knowledge of Ellesmere persisted in the oral histories of the Inuit of Baffin Island and the Inughuit of northern Greenland, who each called it .

=== Euro-American exploration and contact ===

The search for Franklin&#x27;s lost expedition – also searching for the Northwest Passage and to establish claims to the Far North – involved more than forty expeditions to the High Arctic over two decades, and represented the peak period of Euro-American Arctic exploration. Edward Augustus Inglefield led an 1852 expedition which surveyed the coastlines of Baffin Bay and Smith Sound, being stopped by ice in Nares Strait. He named Ellesmere Island for the president of the Royal Geographical Society (1849–1852), Francis Egerton, 1st Earl of Ellesmere. The Second Grinnell expedition (1853–1855) made slightly further progress before becoming trapped in the ice. Over two winters the expedition charted both sides of Kane Basin to about 80°N, from where Elisha Kent Kane claimed to have sighted the conjectured Open Polar Sea.

During this period, as the Little Ice Age abated and the hunting of marine mammals became more feasible again, Aboriginal peoples began to return to Ellesmere Island. The most well-known of these migrations in both Inuit and European accounts is the journey of Qitlaq, who led a group of Inuit families from Baffin Island to northwestern Greenland, via Ellesmere Island, in the 1850s. This journey reestablished contact between Inuit who had been separated for two centuries and reintroduced vital technologies to the Inughuit. Other groups followed and by the 1870s Inuit were living on Ellesmere Island and had regular contact with those on the neighbouring islands.

Contact between Inuit and Europeans or Americans was often indirect, as the Inuit happened upon shipwrecks or abandoned base camps which provided wood and metal resources. European goods were also obtained through inter-group trade. Long-term contact began in the 1800s through whaling stations and trading posts, which frequently relocated. Euro-American expeditions employed Inughuit, Inuit and west Greenlander guides, hunters and labourers, gradually blending their knowledge with European technology to conduct effective exploration.

British and United States Arctic expeditions had been interrupted for some years due to the priorities of the Crimean War and the American Civil War, respectively. By about 1860, the focus of Arctic exploration had shifted to the North Pole. As earlier attempts at the pole via Svalbard or eastern Greenland had reached impasses, numerous expeditions came to Ellesmere Island to pursue the route through Nares Straight.

The United States expedition led by Adolphus Greely in 1881 crossed the island from east to west, establishing Fort Conger in the northern part of the island. The Greely expedition found fossil forests on Ellesmere Island in the late 1880s. Stenkul Fiord was first explored in 1902 by Per Schei, a member of Otto Sverdrup&#x27;s 2nd Norwegian Polar Expedition.

The Ellesmere Ice Shelf was documented by the British Arctic Expedition of 1875–76, in which Lieutenant Pelham Aldrich&#x27;s party went from Cape Sheridan () west to Cape Alert (), including the Ward Hunt Ice Shelf. In 1906 Robert Peary led an expedition in northern Ellesmere Island, from Cape Sheridan along the coast to the western side of Nansen Sound (93°W). During Peary&#x27;s expedition, the ice shelf was continuous; it has since been estimated to have covered . The ice shelf broke apart in the 20th century, presumably due to climate change.

=== Establishment of Canadian sovereignty ===

In 1880, the British Arctic Territories were transferred to Canada. Canada did little to solidify its legal possession of the islands until prompted by foreign action in 1902–03: Otto Sverdrup claimed three islands west of Ellesmere for Norway, the Alaska boundary dispute was settled against Canada&#x27;s interests, and Roald Amundsen set out to sail the Northwest Passage. To establish an official government presence in the Far North, the North-West Mounted Police (NWMP) were sent on sovereignty patrols. A NWMP detachment sailed to the Arctic whaling stations in 1903, where they forbade whalers from killing muskox or trading skins, in order to prevent overhunting and protect the Inuit&#x27;s ability to sustain themselves. In 1904 a NWMP detachment sailed to Cape Herschel at the east end of Sverdrup Pass, where they could intercept hunters accessing the interior of Ellesmere.

While the fur trade was brought under control, American exploration parties to the Far North had acted with autonomy and intensively hunted terrestrial mammals to sustain their expeditions. Peary&#x27;s parties had heavily hunted muskoxen on Ellesmere and had nearly brought the extinction of caribou in northern Greenland; the Crocker Land Expedition (1913–1916) also extensively hunted muskoxen. In response to these and other trespasses, the government amended the &quot;Northwest Game Act&quot; to prohibit the killing of muskoxen except for Native inhabitants who otherwise faced starvation.

In 1920, the government learned that Inughuit from Greenland had been annually visiting Ellesmere Island for polar bear and muskox hunting – in violation of Canadian law – selling the skins at Knud Rasmussen&#x27;s trading post at Qaanaaq, formerly known as Thule. The Danish government stated that North Greenland was a &quot;no man&#x27;s land&quot; outside their administration and Rasmussen, as the &quot;de facto&quot; sole authority, refused to stop the trade which the Inughuit needed to support themselves. In response, Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) detachments were established on Ellesmere Island at Craig Harbour in 1922 and at Bache Post in 1926, positioned to guard the coastal and overland routes to the hunting grounds on the western side of Ellesmere. In addition to intercepting illegal hunting and fur-trading, the RCMP conducted patrols and encouraged the Inuit to maintain their traditional lifestyle. The posts were closed in the mid-1930s, after the sovereignty issues had been settled.

==Geography==

Ellesmere Island is the northernmost island of the Arctic Archipelago in Canada&#x27;s Far North and one of the world&#x27;s northernmost land masses. It is exceeded in this regard only by neighbouring Greenland, which extends about closer to the north pole. Ellesmere&#x27;s northernmost point, Cape Columbia (at ), is less than from the north pole, while its southern coasts at 77°N are well within the Arctic Circle.

Ellesmere has the highest and longest mountain ranges in eastern North America and is the most mountainous island in the Arctic Archipelago. It has over half of the archipelago&#x27;s ice cover, with ice caps and glaciers across 40% of its surface. Its extensive coastline includes some of the world&#x27;s longest fiords.

To the west, Ellesmere is separated from Axel Heiberg Island by Nansen and Eureka Sounds, the latter of which narrows to . Devon Island is to the south across Jones Sound; at the west end of the sound, they are separated by North Kent Island and two channels which narrow to . Greenland is to the east across Nares Strait; the strait narrows to at Cape Isabella on Smith Sound and further north narrows to at Robeson Channel. These channels and straits typically freeze over in winter, though winds and currents leave pockets of open water (temporary leads and persistent polynyas) in Nares Strait. To the north of Ellesmere is the Arctic Ocean, with Lincoln Sea to the northeast.

===Protected areas===
More than one-fifth of the island is protected as Quttinirpaaq National Park (formerly Ellesmere Island National Park Reserve), which includes seven fjords and a variety of glaciers, as well as Lake Hazen, North America&#x27;s largest lake north of the Arctic Circle. Barbeau Peak, the highest mountain in Nunavut () is located in the British Empire Range on Ellesmere Island. The most northern mountain range in the world, the Challenger Mountains, is located in the northeast region of the island. The northern lobe of the island is called Grant Land.

The Arctic willow is the only woody species to grow on Ellesmere Island.

In July 2007, a study noted the disappearance of habitat for waterfowl, invertebrates, and algae on Ellesmere Island. According to John Smol of Queen&#x27;s University in Kingston, Ontario, and Marianne S. V. Douglas of the University of Alberta in Edmonton, warming conditions and evaporation have caused low water levels and changes in the chemistry of ponds and wetlands in the area. The researchers noted that &quot;In the 1980s they often needed to wear hip waders to make their way to the ponds...while by 2006 the same areas were dry enough to burn.&quot;

===Climate===
Ellesmere Island has a tundra climate (Köppen &quot;ET&quot;) and an ice cap climate (Köppen &quot;EF&quot;) with the temperature being cold year-round. Two semi-permanent air systems dominate the weather: the high-pressure northern polar vortex and a low-pressure area which forms in different sites between Baffin Bay and the Labrador Sea. Prevailing winds on Ellesmere are northwesterly, cold, and of low humidity due to ice cover over the Arctic Ocean. Seasonal shifts on Ellesmere are sudden and striking: winters are long and harsh, summers short and relatively abundant, with spring and autumn being brief intervals of transition.

Fog regularly occurs near open water in September. While the major air systems strengthen towards their annual peak in winter, the Arctic and Atlantic air masses collide in autumn to produce severe storms at Ellesmere. The storm season peaks in October and persists until the sea freezes. The polar vortex strengthens during the polar night and gives rise to easterly winds which are major hazards for populations, especially given the very low temperatures. January winds have been recorded at with gusts to at Fort Conger and at Lake Hazen. Very cold temperatures continue until April and no month passes without experiencing freezing temperatures.

Snowfall begins in late August and does not melt until the June thaw. The seasonal shift in daylight is also extreme. The polar night lasts from four-and-a-half months in the north to about three months in the south.

====Regional variation====

Ellesmere&#x27;s Arctic marine climate is strongly affected in the north by Arctic Ocean currents and the polar vortex, while the climate of the southeastern coast is influenced by the warm Atlantic water of the West Greenland Current. Interior regions shielded by the island&#x27;s high mountain ranges experience distinctive quasi-continental microclimates.

The highest precipitation is on the northern coast, averaging . On the south side of the Grant Land mountains, only reaches the Hazen Plateau.

The average number of snow-free days varies from 45 days on the north coast to 77 days in the Eureka–Tanquary corridor.

Winters are considerably colder in the interior. At Lake Hazen, Peary&#x27;s expedition recorded daytime temperatures of in February 1900, and a Defence Research Board party recorded temperatures as low as in the winter of 1957–58. Nonetheless, there are archaeological remains of winter dwellings of both Independence and Thule cultures in the interior.


====Climate change====

A paleolimnological study of algae in the sediments of shallow ponds on Cape Herschel (which faces Smith Sound on Ellesmere&#x27;s eastern coast) found that the ponds had been permanent and relatively stable for several millennia until experiencing ecological changes associated with warming, beginning around 1850 and accelerating in the early 2000s. During the 23-year study period, an ecological threshold was crossed as several of the study ponds had completely desiccated while others had very reduced water levels. In addition, the wetlands surrounding the ponds were severely affected and dried vegetation could be easily burned.

===Glaciers, ice caps and ice shelves===
Large portions of Ellesmere Island are covered with glaciers and ice, with Manson Icefield () and Sydkap () in the south; Prince of Wales Icefield () and Agassiz Ice Cap () along the central-east side of the island, and the Northern Ellesmere icefields ().

The northwest coast of Ellesmere Island was covered by a massive, long ice shelf until the 20th century. The Ellesmere Ice Shelf shrank by 90 per cent in the 20th century due to warming trends in the Arctic, particularly in the 1930s and 1940s, a period when the largest ice islands (the T1 and the T2 ice islands) were formed leaving the separate Alfred Ernest, Ayles, Milne, Ward Hunt, and Markham Ice Shelves. The Ward Hunt Ice Shelf, the largest remaining section of thick (&gt;10 m, &gt;30 ft) landfast sea ice along the northern coastline of Ellesmere Island, lost almost of ice in a massive calving in 1961–1962. Five large ice islands which resulted account for 79% of the calved material. It further decreased by 27% in thickness () between 1967 and 1999. A 1986 survey of Canadian ice shelves found that or of ice calved from the Milne and Ayles ice shelves between 1959 and 1974.
The breakup of the Ellesmere Ice Shelves has continued in the 21st century: the Ward Ice Shelf experienced a major breakup during the summer of 2002; the Ayles Ice Shelf calved entirely on 13 August 2005; the largest breakoff of the ice shelf in 25 years, it may pose a threat to the oil industry in the Beaufort Sea. The piece is . In April 2008, it was discovered that the Ward Hunt shelf was fractured, with dozens of deep, multi-faceted cracks and in September 2008 the Markham shelf () completely broke off to become floating sea ice.

A 2018 study measured a 5.9% reduction in area amongst 1,773 glaciers in Northern Ellesmere island in the 16-year period 1999–2015 based on satellite data. In the same period, 19 out of 27 ice tongues disintegrated to their grounding lines and ice shelves suffered a 42% loss in surface area.

===Paleontology===

Schei and later Alfred Gabriel Nathorst described the Paleocene-Eocene (ca. 55 Ma) fossil forest in the Stenkul Fiord sediments. The Stenkul Fiord site represents a series of deltaic swamp and floodplain forests. The trees stood for at least 400 years. Individual stumps and stems of &gt;1 m (&gt;3 ft) diameter were abundant, and are identified as &quot;Metasequoia&quot; and possibly &quot;Glyptostrobus&quot;. Well preserved Pliocene peats containing abundant vertebrate and plant macrofossils characteristic of a boreal forest have been reported from Strathcona Fiord.

In 2006, University of Chicago paleontologist Neil Shubin and Academy of Natural Sciences paleontologist Ted Daeschler reported the discovery of the fossil of a Paleozoic (ca. 375 Ma) fish, named &quot;Tiktaalik roseae&quot;, in the former stream beds of Ellesmere Island. The fossil exhibits many characteristics of fish, but also indicates a transitional creature that may be a predecessor of amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, including humans.

In 2011, Jason P. Downs and co-authors described the sarcopterygian &quot;Laccognathus embryi&quot; from specimens collected from the same locality that &quot;Tiktaalik&quot; was found.

===Ecology===
The ecosystems of the High Arctic are considered to be young and underdeveloped, having only emerged since the glacial retreat of 8,000 to 6,000 BCE. There is a lack of species diversity, with a small number of animal species and short food chains.

These species have adapted to take advantage of the productive summer while surviving through winter scarcity. Zooplankton, for example, grow to a larger body size and produce larger eggs in greater numbers than in other regions.

Aside from the polar desert conditions of much of the island, there are remarkably productive ecological zones in the arctic oasis of the Lake Hazen area and the polynyas of the island&#x27;s coastal waters.

====Insect ecology====
Ellesmere Island is noted as being the northernmost occurrence of eusocial insects; specifically, the bumblebee &quot;Bombus polaris&quot;. There is a second species of bumblebee occurring there, &quot;Bombus hyperboreus&quot;, which is a parasite in the nests of &quot;B. polaris&quot;.

While non-eusocial, the Arctic woolly bear moth (&quot;Gynaephora groenlandica&quot;) can also be found at Ellesmere Island. While this species generally has a 10-year life cycle, its life is known to extend to up to 14 years at both the Alexandra Fiord lowland and Ellesmere Island.

===Earth&#x27;s magnetism===
In 2015, the Earth&#x27;s geomagnetic north pole was located at approximately , on Ellesmere Island. It is forecast to remain on Ellesmere Island in 2020, shifting to .

==Population==

All groups occupying the island settled on the coast, particularly those relying on maritime resources, while modern-era government-funded settlements were initially supplied by sea.

In 2021, the population of Ellesmere Island was recorded as 144. There are three settlements on Ellesmere Island: Alert (permanent pop. 0, but home to a small temporary population), Eureka (permanent pop. 0), and Grise Fiord (pop. 144). Politically, it is part of the Qikiqtaaluk Region. Part of the year there is also Parks Canada staff stationed at Camp Hazen and Tanquary Fiord Airport.

=== Alert ===
Canadian Forces Station (CFS) Alert is the northernmost continuously inhabited settlement in the world. With the end of the Cold War and the advent of new technologies allowing for remote interpretation of data, the overwintering population has been reduced to 62 civilians and military personnel as of 2016.

=== Eureka ===
Eureka (the third northernmost settlement in the world) consists of three areas: Eureka Aerodrome, which includes Fort Eureka (the quarters for military personnel maintaining the island&#x27;s communications equipment); the Environment Canada Weather Station; and the Polar Environment Atmospheric Research Laboratory (PEARL), formerly the Arctic Stratospheric Ozone (AStrO) Observatory. Eureka has the lowest average annual temperature and least precipitation of any weather station in Canada.

=== Grise Fiord ===

Grise Fiord (Inuktitut: , Romanized: , place that never thaws&quot;) is an Inuit hamlet that, despite a population of only 144, is the largest community on Ellesmere Island.

Located at the southern tip of Ellesmere Island, Grise Fiord lies north of the Arctic Circle. Grise Fiord is the northernmost civilian settlement in Canada. It is also one of the coldest inhabited places in the world, with an average yearly temperature of .

Grise Fiord is cradled by the Arctic Cordillera mountain range.

==Transportation==
Transportation along coastal waters has been historically important for hunting and trade, whether on the sea ice or in small boats. The ice foot, a belt of level and secure ice around the shoreline between the high and low water marks, can be used from mid-September to July. In contrast, the pack ice does not stabilize and freeze fast until February, and presents a much rougher surface for travel.

The navigation season for seagoing vessels is from late July to September, but is often considered treacherous due to currents, persistent shore ice, sea ice, and massive icebergs calved off of the many glaciers. September also marks a change in the weather with regular fog and the beginning of the autumn storm season.

==In popular culture==
Ellesmere Island is the setting of much of Melanie McGrath&#x27;s &quot;The Long Exile: A True Story of Deception and Survival Amongst the Inuit of the Canadian Arctic&quot; about the High Arctic relocation, and also of her Edie Kiglatuk mystery series.

In the 2013 American superhero film &quot;Man of Steel&quot;, Ellesmere Island is the site of a combined United States-Canadian scientific expedition to recover an ancient Kryptonian spaceship buried in the glacial ice pack.

The island is the location for the 2014 BBC programme &quot;Snow Wolf Family and Me&quot;.

The 2008 documentary &quot;Exile&quot; by Zacharias Kunuk documents the experiences of Inuit families who were forcibly relocated to Ellesmere island in the 1950s to settle it for the Canadian government. The families discuss being deceived by the government about the conditions and terms of where they were going and having to endure years of surviving in inhospitable conditions with little food or water.

In 2022, the US National Museum of Wildlife Art debuted the travelling exhibit &quot;Wolves: Photography by Ronan Donovan.&quot; The exhibit was developed in collaboration with the National Geographic Society and features images and videos of the Arctic wolves living on Ellesmere Island.

<text>Teichoscopy or teichoscopia (), meaning &quot;viewing from the walls&quot;, is a recurring narrative strategy in ancient Greek literature. One famous instance of teichoscopy occurs in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad,&quot; Book 3, lines 121–244.

The passage begins with Helen approached in her chamber by Iris, disguised as her sister-in-law Laodice, the daughter of Priam. Helen is then led to the walls of the Skaian gates, where she is summoned by Priam, who asks her to point out the Achaean heroes she sees on the Trojan plain. Below her, the two armies are preparing for the duel between Menelaus and Paris. Helen identifies Agamemnon, Odysseus, Telamonian (Greater) Ajax, and Idomeneus. She also mentions that she does not see her brothers Castor and Pollux, who unbeknownst to her are already dead back in Greece. After this scene, the duel commences, with both armies praying to Zeus and the rest of the gods on Olympus to open the action.

==Analysis==
According to Maria C. Pantelia, Helen becomes the &#x27;author&#x27; of a catalog when she describes for Priam the qualities of the most important Greek warriors. It has been suggested that the teichoscopy, as well as the duel between Paris and Menelaus, would have more likely occurred at the beginning of the war rather than during its tenth year. However, although Homer is not at the beginning of the Trojan War, he is at the beginning of the poem and therefore uses the teichoscopia as a poetic structure that provides information and suspense important for the remainder of the play and the duel to come.

Although teichoscopy can be viewed as simply a vignette that surveys the major Greek warriors, it has been suggested that Homer is also trying to reveal something about Helen. Helen&#x27;s open admiration of both the Greek and Trojan warriors is viewed as ironic, as it seems odd that the major cause of a war that has brought devastation to the Trojans should praise the enemy. However, by doing this, Homer is, according to Frederic Will, “insisting on the importance, and centrality, of Helen’s viewpoint. He is integrating a traditional form artistically.”

The main object of teichoscopy is the synchronous discussion of events, as opposed to events being reported later by messengers or other eyewitnesses. It is a well-established technique in dramaturgy. For example, teichoscopeia is a key device in the drama &quot;Penthesilea&quot; by Heinrich von Kleist. At the time of writing (1808) the work was considered unsuitable for stage production because of the unusually high frequency of teichoscopic events, and the first stage production was not undertaken until half a century later. However, in the twentieth century further stage productions as well as opera, radio and film versions followed (cf. Penthesilea (Kleist)).

<text>The Central Baseball League, formerly the Texas–Louisiana League, was an independent baseball league whose member teams were not affiliated with any Major League Baseball (MLB) franchises.

In 1991, potential owners, Dallas businessman Byron Pierce and U. S. Congressman John Bryant, became frustrated that the Texas League had no plans to expand into other Texas locations, and formed The Texas–Louisiana League. The league began play in 1994. After further expansion into Missouri and Mississippi, the Texas–Louisiana League changed its name to the Central Baseball League. In 12 seasons, the league produced 10 different champions; Alexandria and Edinburg were the only teams to win a title twice.

After the 2005 season, the eight-team Central Baseball League disbanded. Five teams joined the American Association: Pensacola, Shreveport, Fort Worth, Coastal Bend and El Paso; and one joined the United League, San Angelo. Edinburg also received a franchise in the United League, unrelated to the now-defunct Roadrunners of the Central League.

The following teams were, at one time, either a member of the Central Baseball League or the Texas–Louisiana League.

<text>The Alexandria Aces were a baseball team based in Alexandria, Louisiana. The last version of the Aces played in the United League Baseball in 2013. The Aces have played their home games at historic Bringhurst Field, which was built in 1933 for the original Alexandria Aces.

==History==
That team started in 1934 as a member of the old Evangeline League and ceased operations with the league in 1942 due to World War II. This early era was highlighted by the presence of Hal Newhouser and Virgil Trucks, future Detroit Tigers&#x27; stars who headed the pitching staff of the 1939 Aces. The Aces (and the league) were revived after the war but once again ceased operations in 1957. Alexandria was the only city to field a team every year the Evangeline League operated. The Aces appeared regularly in the league&#x27;s Shaughnessy playoffs and took the Evangeline pennant twice — in 1936 and 1940.

Baseball returned to Alexandria again from 1972, with the Aces as the San Diego Padres&#x27; AA farm club, and while it only lasted four years, many major league notables passed through Alexandria – in particular All-Star pitcher Randy Jones and longtime Cleveland Indians first baseman John Grubb. Duke Snider also managed the team during this period.

The new Aces were a charter member of the independent Texas–Louisiana League in 1994, and the Aces won back-to-back titles in and before the league changed its name to the Central Baseball League. In the first season of the new United League in 2006, the Aces won the inaugural ULB championship before pulling off another repeat as they would win the title once again in 2007. In 2009 the Aces joined the Continental Baseball League when the ULB went bankrupt. The Aces are the 2009 CBL Champions, beating the Big Bend Cowboys 2–0. In 2010, the Aces ended their contract with the CBL, citing travel costs among other reasons before joining the college wooden bat league, the Texas Collegiate League.

On March 12, 2011 the front office announced that there would be a change to the team&#x27;s logo for the first time since the team returned in 1994.

In 2013, the Aces joined United League Baseball and slightly past the halfway mark of the season, with a 24–20 record and in second place, the United League cancelled the remaining games for the Aces. Four scheduled road games were forfeited, giving the Aces an official record of 24-24. According to league CEO John Bryant, the league could not justify spending at least $100,000 for the remainder of the season because of low attendance, averaging 333 fans a game.

<doc id="65785" wikidata="Q1064632" url="?curid=65785" title="Tremolo">
<text>In music, tremolo (), or tremolando (), is a trembling effect. There are multiple types of tremolo: a rapid repetition of a note, an alternation between two different notes, or a variation in volume.

Tremolos may be either &quot;measured&quot;, in which the exact rate of repetition or oscillation is specified, or &quot;unmeasured&quot;, in which it is not (the understanding being in that case that it should be performed as rapidly as possible).

== Types of tremolo ==

=== Rapid reiteration or oscillation ===
The rapid reiteration of a single note is a characteristic effect of bowed string instruments, obtained by rapidly moving the bow back and forth. However, the technique may be performed on any instrument on which it is practicable. (Indeed, a slow measured tremolo is simply a shorthand notation for an ordinary repetition of notes; thus, tremolo notation may appear in written music for any instrument.)

The notation for this effect consists of one or more strokes drawn through the stem of a note (or, if the note lacks a stem, through the position that a hypothetical stem would occupy); the strokes correspond to the beams that would connect the individual repeated notes if they were to be written out, thereby representing the rate of repetition (i.e. the speed of the tremolo).

Some special cases are worth noting:

* On plucked strings such as on a harp, the word &quot;&quot; () or &quot;whispering&quot; is used. Tremolo picking, on traditionally plucked string instruments including guitar and mandolin, is the rapid articulation of single notes or a group of notes with a plectrum (pick) or with fingers. Tremolo playing sustains notes that would otherwise rapidly decay (fade to silence).
* The technique of flutter-tonguing on wind instruments is analogous to an unmeasured tremolo on strings, and notated similarly.
* The roll on percussion instruments is one of the most familiar examples. On unpitched instruments, as well as timpani, it may be notated as either a tremolo or a trill -- a fact suggestive of the close relationship between tremolos and trills (see below).

A rapid alternation between two different pitches is another type of tremolo. On bowed string instruments, this is referred to as a &quot;fingered tremolo&quot; to distinguish it from the &quot;bowed tremolo&quot; discussed above; but once again it may be performed on any instrument. It is notated by writing the pitches to be alternated as a melodic interval, with both notes receiving the rhythmic value of the total duration of the tremolo (e.g. two half-notes for a tremolo lasting a half-note), and then either connecting them with beams, or else interpolating strokes, with the number of beams or strokes corresponding to the speed of the tremolo (e.g. a tremolo in thirty-second notes lasting a half-note would be written either as two open noteheads connected by three beams, or as two half-notes with three strokes interpolated).

This type of tremolo includes the trill as a special case: a trill is simply an unmeasured tremolo between two notes separated by the interval of a major or minor second (whole- or half step). Thus, a tremolo in this sense is a generalization of a trill to any interval, and to include measured durations.

=== Amplitude variation ===
A separate type of tremolo is a variation in amplitude:
* As produced on organs by tremulants
* Using electronic effects in guitar amplifiers and effects pedals which rapidly turn the volume of a signal up and down, creating a &quot;shuddering&quot; effect
* An imitation of the same by strings in which pulsations are taken in the same bow direction
* A vocal technique involving a wide or slow vibrato, not to be confused with the trillo or &quot;Monteverdi trill&quot;
Tremolo is sometimes used interchangeably with vibrato. However, a tremolo is a variation of volume (or amplitude); as contrasted with vibrato, which is a variation of pitch (or frequency).

Some electric guitars (in particular the Fender Stratocaster) use a lever branded a &quot;tremolo arm&quot; or &quot;whammy bar&quot; that allows a performer to lower or (usually, to some extent) raise the pitch of a note or chord, an effect properly termed vibrato or &quot;pitch bend&quot;. This non-standard misuse of the term &quot;tremolo&quot; refers to pitch rather than amplitude. However, the term &quot;trem&quot; or &quot;tremolo&quot; is still misused to refer to a bridge system built for a whammy bar, or the bar itself. True tremolo for an electric guitar, electronic organ, or any electronic signal would normally be produced by a simple amplitude modulation electronic circuit, or in terms of analog synthesis, a VCA under control of an LFO. Electronic tremolo effects were available on many early guitar amplifiers. Fender labeled them Vibrato, adding to the confusion between the two terms. Tremolo effects pedals are also widely used to achieve this effect.

Most settings on a tremolo effects pedal include depth of the tremolo (sometimes called intensity) and speed of the tremolo. Some models allow to choose the shape of the waveform (sine wave, triangle wave, square wave).

==History==
Although it had already been employed as early as 1617 by Biagio Marini and again in 1621 by Giovanni Battista Riccio, the bowed tremolo was invented in 1624 by the early 17th-century composer Claudio Monteverdi, and, written as repeated semiquavers (sixteenth notes), used for the &quot;stile concitato&quot; effects in &quot;Il combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda&quot;. The &quot;measured tremolo&quot;, presumably played with rhythmic regularity, was invented to add dramatic intensity to string accompaniment and contrast with regular tenuto strokes. However, it was not till the time of Gluck that the real tremolo became an accepted method of tone production. Four other types of historical tremolos include the obsolete &quot;undulating tremolo&quot;, the &quot;bowed tremolo&quot;, the &quot;fingered tremolo&quot; (or slurred tremolo), and the &quot;bowed-and-fingered tremolo&quot;.

The undulating tremolo was produced through the fingers of the right hand alternately exerting and relaxing pressure upon the bow to create a &quot;very uncertain–undulating effect ... But it must be said that, unless violinists have wholly lost the art of this particular stroke, the result is disappointing and futile in the extreme,&quot; though it has been suggested that rather than as a legato stroke it was done as a series of &quot;jetés&quot;.

There is some speculation that tremolo was employed in medieval Welsh harp music, as indicated in the transcription by Robert ap Huw.

==Notation==
In musical notation, unmeasured tremolo is usually notated as regular repeated notes -- measured tremolo -- of very short duration: so short as to preclude confusion with an actual measured tremolo. Commonly, for example, the duration used will be demisemiquavers (thirty-second notes). In this case, there will be three strokes through the stems of the notes, except on notes which already have beams or flags: quavers (eighth notes) then take two slashes, and semiquavers (sixteenth notes) take one.
In the case of semibreves (whole notes), which lack stems, the strokes or slashes are drawn above or below the note, where the stem would be if there were one.

In slower tempos (and/or meters with larger denominators), notes of shorter duration (corresponding to additional strokes) would be used. To eliminate ambiguity as to whether an unmeasured tremolo or regular repeated demisemiquavers (thirty-second notes) should be played, the word &quot;tremolo&quot; or the abbreviation &quot;trem.&quot;, is sometimes added.

If the tremolo is between two or more notes, both notes are given the full value of the passage and the bars are drawn between them:
As shown above, a minim (half note)-based tremolo is sometimes drawn with beams connecting the two notes together rather than interpolated bars (strokes).

===Bowed string instruments===
Violin fingered tremolo; notice the joining of strokes and stems is different for different time values, and that some notes shorter than eighth notes are written out, such as the last thirty-second notes on the last beat of measure three:
Violin bowed-and-fingered tremolo, notated the same as fingered tremolo but without slurs and with &quot;staccato&quot; above the staff:
