<text>Jan Timman (born 14 December 1951) is a Dutch chess grandmaster who was one of the world&#x27;s leading chess players from the late 1970s to the early 1990s. At the peak of his career, he was considered to be the best non-Soviet player and was known as &quot;The Best of the West&quot;. He has won the Dutch Chess Championship nine times and has been a Candidate for the World Chess Championship several times. He lost the title match of the 1993 FIDE World Championship against Anatoly Karpov.

== Early career ==
He is the son of mathematics professor Rein Timman and his wife Anneke, who as a schoolgirl was a mathematics student of former world champion Max Euwe. His older brother, Ton (1946–2014), held the chess title of FIDE Master. Jan Timman was already an outstanding prospect in his early teens, and at Jerusalem 1967 played in the World Junior Championship, aged fifteen, finishing third.

Timman received the International Master title in 1971, and in 1974 attained Grandmaster status, making him the Netherlands&#x27; third after Max Euwe and Jan Hein Donner. In the same year he won the Dutch Championship for the first time, having finished second in 1972. He was to win it again on many more occasions through 1996. His first notable international success was at Hastings 1973/74, where he shared victory with Tal, Kuzmin, and Szabó. A string of victories quickly followed at Sombor 1974 (with Boris Gulko), Netanya 1975, Reykjavík 1976 (with Fridrik Olafsson), Amsterdam IBM 1978, Nikšić 1978, and Bled/Portorož 1979.

==Tournament successes==
By 1982 Timman was ranked second in the world, behind only Anatoly Karpov. In the 1980s he won a number of very strong tournaments, including Amsterdam IBM in 1981, Wijk aan Zee in 1981 and 1985, Linares in 1988, the 1989 Euwe Memorial, and the 1989 World Cup tournament in Rotterdam. Other major successes included Las Palmas 1981, Mar del Plata 1982, Bugojno 1984, and Sarajevo 1984. One of his notable later successes was the 2nd Immopar Rapid Tournament in 1991, a weekend event which attracted a huge amount of prize money. In this knock-out format tournament he defeated Gata Kamsky 1½–½, Karpov 2–0, Viswanathan Anand 1½–½, and finally the World Champion Garry Kasparov 1½–½ to win the first prize of approximately 75,000 USD. His performance was equivalent to an Elo rating of 2950.

==World Championship Candidate==
Timman&#x27;s world championship career began at the zonal tournaments at Forssa/Helsinki 1972 and Reykjavík 1975. He failed to qualify for the next stage on both occasions. However his win at Amsterdam 1978 took him to his first interzonal tournament at Rio de Janeiro, where he failed to progress further. He finished in the middle of the field at the 1982 Las Palmas Interzonal, but won the Taxco 1985 Interzonal convincingly to qualify for the Candidates Matches for the first time. However, he lost in the first round to Artur Yusupov in 1986. In the next cycle, after winning the 1987 Tilburg Interzonal he defeated Valery Salov, Lajos Portisch, and Jonathan Speelman, but lost in the final to Anatoly Karpov in 1990. He reached the final round once again in 1993, having defeated Robert Hübner, Viktor Korchnoi, and Yusupov, but lost this time to Nigel Short. However, after Short and Garry Kasparov played their World Championship match outside of the auspices of the sport&#x27;s governing body FIDE, Timman was invited to compete against Karpov for the FIDE version of the world title. He lost the match by 12½ points to 8½.

==Olympiad career==

Timman represented the Netherlands in 13 Chess Olympiads from 1972 to 2004, playing on the top board on 11 occasions. In 1976 he won the gold medal for the best individual performance on that board.

==Later career==
Timman continues to play actively. In 2004 he placed equal first in a tournament in Reykjavík and was equal second at Amsterdam. He played in the gold medal-winning Dutch team at the European Team Chess Championships in Gothenburg in 2005, alongside Loek van Wely, Ivan Sokolov, Sergei Tiviakov, and Erik van den Doel. In 2006 he won the Sigeman Tournament in Malmö Sweden and was second in the Howard Staunton Memorial in London.

==Writings==
Timman is one of the chief editors of the magazine &quot;New In Chess&quot;. His book &quot;The Art of Chess Analysis&quot; () is widely considered one of the modern classics of chess literature. His &quot;Timman&#x27;s Titans&quot; won the 2017 ECF Book of the Year. His other books include &quot;Timman&#x27;s Selected Games&quot; (1995), &quot;Studies and Games&quot; (1996), &quot;Fischer, World Champion!&quot; (2002), an account of the 1972 World Championship, &quot;Power Chess with Pieces: The Ultimate Guide to the Bishops Pair &amp; Strong Knights&quot; (2004), &quot;Botvinnik&#x27;s Secret Games&quot; (2006), &quot;On the Attack: The Art of Attacking Chess According to the Modern Masters&quot; (2006), &quot;Curaçao 1962: The Battle of Minds That Shook the Chess World&quot; (2007), which covers the 1962 Candidates Tournament and &quot;The Art of the Endgame (My journeys in the Magical World Endgame Studies)&quot; (2011).
==Style==
Timman likes to challenge opponents directly in the areas of their strengths. Yasser Seirawan describes a game where Timman had an over-the-board inspiration to opt for a complicated game—the kind that Timman knew Seirawan really enjoyed—in spite of having prepared an equalizing variation beforehand. Timman&#x27;s fearlessness has caused him to lose a lot of games, but also makes him a feared competitor because nobody likes to lose from their favourite positions. Raymond Keene described Timman&#x27;s playing style as that of &quot;a fighter, in the mould of Emanuel Lasker&quot;.

He has always adopted a wide and varied opening repertoire, playing an array of different systems as both White and Black. When he first reached the world class level in the 1970s, this was relatively unusual, with most elite grandmasters deploying a more narrowly focused range of openings, but it is now the norm.

===Example game===
This game, played between Timman and Garry Kasparov in Hilversum on 17 December 1985, is a good example of Timman&#x27;s style: 
:Timman vs. Garry Kasparov, Hilversum 1985; Ruy Lopez, Zaitsev Variation 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Be7 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3 d6 8.c3 0-0 9.h3 Bb7 10.d4 Re8 11.Ng5 Rf8 12.Nf3 Re8 13.Nbd2 Bf8 14.a3 h6 15.Bc2 Nb8 16.b4 Nbd7 17.Bb2 g6 18.c4 exd4 19.cxb5 axb5 20.Nxd4 c6 21.a4 bxa4 22.Bxa4 Qb6 23.Nc2 Qc7 24.Bb3 Ba6 25.Rc1 Bg7 26.Ne3 Bb5 27.Nd5 Nxd5 28.Bxg7 Kxg7 29.exd5 Ne5 30.Ne4 Nd3 31.Qd2 Ra3 32.Nf6 Rxe1+ 33.Rxe1 Kxf6 34.Qc3+ Ne5 35.f4 Ba4 36.fxe5 dxe5 (see diagram; at this point, Timman finds a game-ending combination) 37.d6 Qxd6 38.Qf3+ Ke7 39.Qxf7+ Kd8 40.Rd1 Ra1 41.Qf6+ (Kasparov cannot hang on to his queen) 

==Personal life==
Timman married twice, with a son and a daughter from the first marriage.

<doc id="69128" wikidata="Q622778" url="?curid=69128" title="Tonkin">
<text>Tonkin, also spelled Tongkin, Tonquin or Tongking, is an exonym referring to the northern region of Vietnam. During the 17th and 18th centuries, this term referred to the domain &quot;Đàng Ngoài&quot; under Trịnh lords&#x27; control, including both the Northern and Thanh-Nghệ regions, north of the Gianh River. From 1884 to 1949, this term was used for the French protectorate of Tonkin, composed of only present-day Northern Vietnam.

==Names==
&quot;Tonkin&quot; is a Western rendition of 東京 &quot;Đông Kinh&quot;, meaning &#x27;Eastern Capital&#x27;. This was the name of the capital of the Lê dynasty (present-day Hanoi). Locally, Tonkin is nowadays known as &quot;miền Bắc&quot;, or &quot;Bắc Bộ&quot;, meaning &#x27;Northern Region&#x27;.

The name was used from 1883 to 1945 for the French protectorate of Tonkin (Vietnamese: &quot;Bắc Kỳ&quot; 北圻), a constituent territory of French Indochina.

==Geography==

It is south of Yunnan (Vân Nam) and Guangxi (Quảng Tây) Provinces of China; east of northern Laos and west of the Gulf of Tonkin.

Having the fertile delta area of the Red River, Tonkin is rich in rice production.

Unlike tropical Central and Southern Vietnam, Tonkin (Northern Vietnam) has a subtropical climate.

==History==

The area was called Văn Lang from around 2000−200 BC. Evidence of the earliest established society in northern Vietnam, along with the Đông Sơn culture, was discovered in the Cổ Loa Citadel area, located near present-day Hanoi, the capital city of Vietnam.

According to Vietnamese myths the first Vietnamese peoples descended from the Dragon Lord Lạc Long Quân and the Immortal Goddess Âu Cơ. Lạc Long Quân and Âu Cơ had 100 sons before they decided to part ways. 50 of the children went with their mother to the mountains, and the other 50 went with their father to the sea. The eldest son became the first in a line of earliest Vietnamese kings, collectively known as the Hùng kings of the Hồng Bàng dynasty. The country was called Văn Lang and its people were referred to as the Lạc Việt.

By the 3rd century BC, another Viet group, the Âu Việt, emigrated to the Red River delta and mixed with the indigenous population. A new kingdom, Âu Lạc, emerged as the union of the Âu Việt and the Lạc Việt, with Thục Phán proclaiming himself An Dương Vương.

Âu Lạc was annexed into Nam Việt kingdom of Triệu Đà. After the Triệu dynasty, this region started to be officially under Chinese rule. In pre-Tang times Tonkin was the port of call for ships on the South China Sea, though the center of commerce later moved north to Guangdong.

The victory of Ngô Quyền at the Battle of Bạch Đằng in 938 ushered a new era of independence of Vietnam. The Ngô dynasty was followed by the Đinh, Early Lê, Lý, Trần, and Hồ.

===15th and 16th centuries===
Lê Lợi (reigned 1428–1433), a notable landowner in the Lam Sơn region, had a following of more than 1,000 people before rising up against rule of the Chinese Ming dynasty. Following his victory he mounted the throne and established himself in the city of Thăng Long (&#x27;Ascending Dragon&#x27;), present Hà Nội. Thăng Long was also called &quot;Đông Kinh&quot; , meaning &#x27;Eastern Capital&#x27; (東京 is identical in meaning and written form in Chinese characters to that of Tokyo).

===17th and 18th centuries===
During the 17th and 18th centuries, Westerners commonly used the name Tonkin (from &quot;Đông Kinh&quot;) to refer to &quot;Đàng Ngoài&quot; in the North, ruled by the Trịnh lords. &quot;Đàng Ngoài&quot;, or &quot;Bắc Hà&quot;, included not only the delta of the Red River, but also the deltas of the Mã River and Cả River. Meanwhile, Cochinchina or Quinan was used to refer to &quot;Đàng Trong&quot; in the South, ruled by the Nguyễn lords; and Annam, from the name of the former Chinese province, was used to refer to Vietnam as a whole.

===19th and 20th centuries===

After French assistance to Nguyễn Ánh to unify Vietnam under the Nguyễn dynasty, the French Navy began its heavy presence in Lower Cochinchina, including Saigon, and later colonized the whole of this southern third of Vietnam in 1867.

During the Sino-French War (1884–1885), Tonkin, then considered a crucial foothold in Southeast Asia and a key to the Chinese market, was invaded by the French in the Tonkin Campaign. It was colonized as the French protectorate of Tonkin, and was gradually separated from the French protectorate of Annam, with Vietnam being effectively separated into three parts.

During French colonial rule within French Indochina, Hanoi was the capital of Tonkin protectorate, and in 1901 became the capital of all French Indochina (Cambodia, Laos, &amp; Vietnam). French colonial administration ruled until 9 March 1945, including 1941-1945 during the World War II Japanese occupation of Vietnam. French administration was allowed by the Japanese as a puppet government. Japan briefly took full control of Vietnam in March 1945, as the Empire of Vietnam. Tonkin became a site of the Vietnamese famine of 1945 during this period.

After the end of World War II, French rule returned over French Indochina. The Northern part of Vietnam became a stronghold for the communist Viet Minh. Hanoi was later reoccupied by the French and conflict between the Viet Minh and France broke out into the First Indochina War. In 1949 it came under the authority of the State of Vietnam, a new associated state of the French Union.

After the French defeat at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu in western Tonkin and signature of Geneva accords in 1954, the communist nation of North Vietnam was formed, consisting of Tonkin and northern Annam. The State of Vietnam&#x27;s territory was reduced to the southern half of the country, becoming South Vietnam.

In 1964, the US and North Vietnamese were involved in a battle off the coast known as the Gulf of Tonkin Incident.

<text>Fred Dagg is a fictional character from New Zealand created and acted on stage, film and television by satirist John Clarke. Clarke appeared on New Zealand TV screens as Dagg during the mid to late 1970s, &quot;&quot; out of the post-pioneering Kiwi &quot;blokes&quot; and &quot;blokesses&quot;. The sense of the name &quot;Dagg&quot; is associated with the slang term &quot;dag&quot;. The Fred Dagg character is a stereotypical farmer and New Zealand bloke: clad in a black singlet and gumboots, hailing from the isolated rural town of Taihape, and attended by numerous associates (or sons) all named &quot;Trev&quot;. One memorable expression was uttered whenever there was a knock at the door: &quot;That&#x27;ll be the door.&quot; When Clarke first unveiled the character of Fred Dagg in recordings and on New Zealand TV in 1975, he became a national star. He also recorded a series of records and cassettes as Dagg, as well as publishing several books.

In 1977, Clarke moved from New Zealand to Australia, where he went on to establish himself as a top script writer and personality.

He appeared regularly on Australian television delivering political satire sketches with actor comedian Bryan Dawe until his death in April 2017.

==Influence==
Clarke stated that the inspiration for Fred Dagg came primarily from his uncles who would talk in such a way, using intonation and speech rhythm, to cause laughter without the standard telling of jokes.

Much of the comedy coming into New Zealand at the time was British radio and this was an inspiration to him.

==Works==
John Clarke slowly refined the character of Fred Dagg in short comedic interview segments that screened occasionally on the New Zealand current affairs show &quot;Nationwide&quot; throughout 1974. In December of that year the character was the subject of a satirical mockumentary spoof episode on the NZBC farming show, &quot;Country Calendar&quot;. Fred Dagg went on to become a household name in New Zealand in 1975 with further comedy skit appearances on the Television One news programme &quot;Tonight at Nine&quot; and with the release by Clarke (as Dagg) of two singles with EMI, &quot;Traditional Air&quot;/&quot;Unlabelled&quot;, and &quot;We Don&#x27;t Know How Lucky We Are&quot;/&quot;Larry Loves Barry&quot;, with the latter making it to number 17 on the national music single charts.

An album called &quot;Fred Dagg&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot; followed and was a massive seller. Thirty years after its release this album remains one of New Zealand&#x27;s all-time biggest selling records.

Another single recorded with Diamond Lil was an even bigger hit in 1976. &quot;Gumboots&quot;/&quot;Save The Last Dance For Me&quot; climbed to number 6 on the charts. &quot;Gumboots&quot; was a modified version of Billy Connolly&#x27;s &quot;If It Wasna For Your Wellies&quot;, itself an adaptation of the old song &quot;The Work Of The Weavers&quot;.

A second album, &quot;Fred Dagg Live&quot; was released in 1976. Following on in the style of the first, it was also a huge seller.

1977 saw the release of the film &quot;Dagg Day Afternoon&quot;, co-directed and co-written by John Clarke and Geoff Murphy, and starring Fred Dagg. The film, under 45 minutes long, is essentially a series of sketches tied together with a loose narrative about Dagg&#x27;s secret mission to find a &quot;bionic sheep&quot; (or 6 million dollar ram) which has been lost by the government.

By 1978 John Clarke and his young family had settled in Australia but he briefly commuted back to New Zealand during that year to create a Fred Dagg television series for South Pacific Television (TV2). &quot;The Fred Dagg Lectures on Leisure&quot; consisted of 20 five-minute long episodes which screened Sunday nights from September 1978 through to February 1979. The programmes featured Fred holding forth on a variety of diverse subjects such as golf, photography, how to write an autobiography, UFO spotting, saving whales and tree-felling. The original master tapes of all these episodes no longer exist and are thought to have either been wiped or lost by SPTV when the company was dissolved and amalgamated with Television One in 1980.

A third and final album was released in 1979 called &quot;The Fred Dagg Tapes&quot;.

In 1998 the &quot;Fred Dagg Anthology&quot; CD was released by Columbia. It contained most of Dagg&#x27;s best-known material. A lot of the second half of the &quot;Anthology&quot; isn&#x27;t genuine &quot;Fred Dagg&quot; material, having been created by Clarke after he&#x27;d retired Fred Dagg and moved to Australia. A number of mock interviews were first broadcast on Australian current affairs television, and lampoon prominent people (such as businessman Alan Bond) who would not be familiar to a New Zealand audience. There are also six &quot;farnarkeling&quot; reports, which parody sports news and were first performed by Clarke on the ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Gillies Report&quot;.

&quot;We Don&#x27;t Know How Lucky We Are!&quot; was re-released in 1998 with revised lyrics. This re-recording was driven by Graeme Hill, and Sky TV&#x27;s &quot;SportsCafe&quot;.

<doc id="69134" wikidata="Q210074" url="?curid=69134" title="Tiglath-Pileser III">
<text>Tiglath-Pileser III (, meaning &quot;my trust belongs to the son of Ešarra&quot;; ) was the king of the Neo-Assyrian Empire from 745 BC to his death in 727. One of the most prominent and historically significant Assyrian kings, Tiglath-Pileser ended a period of Assyrian stagnation, introduced numerous political and military reforms and more than doubled the lands under Assyrian control. Because of the massive expansion and centralization of Assyrian territory and establishment of a standing army, some researchers consider Tiglath-Pileser&#x27;s reign to mark the true transition of Assyria into an empire. The reforms and methods of control introduced under Tiglath-Pileser laid the groundwork for policies enacted not only by later Assyrian kings but also by later empires for millennia after his death.

The circumstances of Tiglath-Pileser&#x27;s rise to the throne are not clear. Because ancient Assyrian sources give conflicting accounts concerning Tiglath-Pileser&#x27;s lineage and there are records of a revolt at around the time of his accession, many historians have concluded that Tiglath-Pileser was a usurper, who seized the throne from his predecessor Ashur-nirari V, who was either his brother or his father. Other historians postulate that the evidence could just as easily be interpreted as Tiglath-Pileser inheriting the throne through legitimate means and the debate remains unresolved.

Tiglath-Pileser early on increased royal power and authority through curbing the influence of prominent officials and generals. After securing some minor victories in 744 and 743, he defeated the Urartian king Sarduri II in battle near Arpad in 743. This victory was significant since Urartu had for a brief time equalled Assyrian power; Sarduri had eleven years earlier defeated Tiglath-Pileser&#x27;s predecessor Ashur-nirari. After defeating Sarduri, Tiglath-Pileser turned his attention to the Levant. Over the course of several years, Tiglath-Pileser conquered most of the Levant, defeating and then either annexing or subjugating previously influential kingdoms, notably ending the kingdom of Aram-Damascus. Tiglath-Pileser&#x27;s activities in the Levant were recorded in the Hebrew Bible. After a few years of conflict, Tiglath-Pileser conquered Babylonia in 729, becoming the first king to rule as both king of Assyria and king of Babylon.

== Background ==

=== Ancestry and rise to the throne ===

There is not enough surviving evidence to conclude how Tiglath-Pileser III came to the throne and the nature of his accession is thus unclear and disputed. Several pieces of evidence indicate that he might have been a usurper. Pointing to this are the facts that there was a revolt in Nimrud, the capital of the Assyrian Empire, in 746/745 and that numerous officials and governors were replaced after 745. Ancient Assyrian sources give conflicting information in regards to Tiglath-Pileser&#x27;s lineage. Tiglath-Pileser in inscriptions attributed his rise to the throne solely to divine selection, rather than the more typical practice of Assyrian kings ascribing their rise to both divine selection and his royal ancestry. The &quot;Assyrian King List&quot;, an ancient Assyrian document listing the kings of Assyria, states that Tiglath-Pileser&#x27;s father was his immediate predecessor Ashur-nirari V. Tiglath-Pileser in his own inscriptions claimed that he was the son of Adad-nirari III, making him Ashur-nirari&#x27;s brother.

Assyriologists and other historians have overwhelmingly concluded that Tiglath-Pileser was a usurper. The Assyriologist Bradley J. Parker went as far as suggesting that he was not part of the previous royal dynasty at all, but per the Assyriologist Karen Radner, his claims of royal descent were probably true, meaning that while he did usurp the throne, he was a legitimate contender for it, having been victorious in an intra-dynastic civil war. Tiglath-Pileser faced no known resistance or rebellions against his rule after taking the throne.

If accepted as a royal dynast, uncertainties still exist in whether Tiglath-Pileser was the son of Adad-nirari or Ashur-nirari. The Assyriologists Fei Chen, Albert Kirk Grayson and Shiego Yamada consider it more likely that he was Adad-nirari&#x27;s son, with the Assyrian King List&#x27;s identification of him as the son of Ashur-nirari possibly being a scribal error. The Assyriologist Paul Garelli considers this unlikely, given that 38 years separate the reign of Adad-nirari from that of Tiglath-Pileser, writing that the possibility of him being Ashur-nirari&#x27;s son cannot be fully ruled out. 

The historian Tracy Davenport holds that &quot;we may never know&quot; whether Tiglath-Pileser was Ashur-nirari&#x27;s son or brother. There are ways to explain Tiglath-Pileser&#x27;s inscriptions proclaiming him as the son of Adad-nirari despite the 38 years between their two reigns. It is possible that &quot;son&quot; in this context meant &quot;grandson&quot;, meaning that Tiglath-Pileser would have been the son of Ashur-nirari or another of Adad-nirari&#x27;s sons, or that Tiglath-Pileser actually was Adad-nirari&#x27;s son, but came to the throne when he was already relatively old, possibly aged about 50.
The &quot;Eponym Chronicle&quot;, a list of eponyms, names for the years, typically taken from influential officials, of Assyria confirms there was a revolt in Nimrud the year before Tiglath-Pileser became king. According to the historian Stefan Zawadzki, writing in 1994, the eponyms also provide insight into how the transition from Ashur-nirari to Tiglath-Pileser might have happened. That Tiglath-Pileser took the throne the year after the uprising was interpreted by Zawadzki, and others, as firmly indicating that he took the throne as the result of a &quot;coup d&#x27;etat&quot;. Zawadzki believes the Eponym Chronicle further suggests that the rebellion, while not necessarily led by Tiglath-Pileser himself, was started with his knowledge and consent. The chief piece of evidence Zawadzki presents for this is that the revolt of 746 began in Nimrud and the first official appointed as eponym holder by Tiglath-Pileser (in 744) was Bel-dan, the governor of Nimrud. 

Garelli believes the revolt in 746 was instigated by Shamshi-ilu, a prominent official throughout the reigns of Tiglath-Pileser&#x27;s predecessors, and that the uprising was crushed by Tiglath-Pileser after he legitimately inherited the throne. Zawadzki believes Shamshi-ilu may have revolted, as he is no longer recorded in Tiglath-Pileser&#x27;s reign, but that the uprising in Nimrud was a separate revolt from Shamshu-ilu&#x27;s supposed uprising and that Tiglath-Pileser or his supporters would have fought both Shamshu-ilu and Ashur-nirari.

In her 2016 PhD thesis, the historian Tracy Davenport advanced the theory that Tiglath-Pileser might have been entirely legitimate and that he could even have co-ruled with Ashur-nirari for some time. Supporting Garelli&#x27;s idea that Tiglath-Pileser was not responsible for any rebellion and the idea that he was a member of the royal dynasty, Davenport examined the Eponym Chronicle. Notably, the eponyms for Tiglath-Pileser&#x27;s early reign do not follow the traditional sequence used for Assyrian eponym holders. Typically, the king was eponym holder in his second regnal year, followed by important magnates and then provincial governors.

If Tiglath-Pileser became king in 745, the eponym holder of his second regnal year was Bel-dan, not the king himself, who was the eponym holder in 743, his third regnal year. This could be explained by Tiglath-Pileser not having become the sole ruler of Assyria until 744. There are some strange features of the Eponym Chronicle that suggest that Ashur-nirari ruled until 744, together with Tiglath-Pileser 745–744. There are two horizonal lines in this part of the list, one beneath 746, possibly marking Tiglath-Pileser&#x27;s rise to the throne, and one beneath 744, possibly marking Ashur-nirari&#x27;s death. 

It is unlikely that the second line is an error, since it occurs right after a note that records the end of Ashur-nirari&#x27;s reign and its length. Both the Eponym Chronicle and the Assyrian King List gives Ashur-nirari a reign length of 10 years, only possible if he ruled until 744, and not 745. If Ashur-nirari did rule until 744, it is unlikely that there was a civil war, since Tiglath-Pileser is recorded to have gone on campaigns against Assyria&#x27;s foreign enemies in this time, not possible if he was simultaneously involved in internal conflict.

=== Name ===

Due to Assyria for centuries mainly being known through its appearances in the Hebrew Bible, the Assyrian kings who are mentioned in the Bible are generally known today by the Biblical forms of their names. The modern name Tiglath-Pileser thus derives from the Hebrew &quot;Tīglaṯ Pīl&#x27;eser&quot; (תִּגְלַת פִּלְאֶסֶר), a corrupted form of the original Akkadian name &quot;Tukultī-apil-Ešarra&quot; ().&quot;&quot; Presumably a regnal name, adopted upon his accession to the throne, &quot;Tukultī-apil-Ešarra&quot; means &quot;my trust belongs to the son of Ešarra&quot;. Ešarra was a temple dedicated to the god Ninurta (who was thus the &quot;son of Ešarra&quot;). By the time of Tiglath-Pileser&#x27;s reign, Ninurta was viewed as the son of the Assyrian national deity Ashur.

In some non-contemporary sources, such as the Ptolemaic Canon, the Babylonian King List, the Bible and the works of later Babylonian and Greco-Roman historians, Tiglath-Pileser is recorded under the name Pulu (&quot;Pūlu&quot;, ), the etymology of which is uncertain. Though sometimes interpreted as a second regnal name, there are no contemporary Assyrian or Babylonian sources that refer to Tiglath-Pileser by this name and there is no evidence that it was ever used officially. No evidence exists of any Assyrian king ever using more than one regnal name in their lifetime.

In 2007, the Incirli Trilingual inscription was published that gave contemporary confirmation that Pul (Pulu) and Tiglath-Pileser III were one and the same king. Only the Phoenician part of the inscription has been published so far, because of the monument’s poor state of preservation. Still, the identification of Tiglath-Pileser III as Pul is fairly certain, because this phrase is repeated more than once in the text. The Phoenician spelling of this name is &quot;Puwal&quot;.

: &quot;Tiglath-pileser III is also referred to as Puˀ/wal [Puwal] with an intervocalic glide, spelled פאל quite clearly in at least one place (and probably the others) in contrast to biblical פול, vocalized Pûl. If it were pronounced according to the latter then one would expect פל in the Phoenician orthography.&quot;

The Phoenician inscription is narrated in the first person by king :de:Awariku (&quot;Awarikku&quot;, &quot;Warika&quot;, &quot;Urikki&quot;) of Que (Quwê, Adanawa, Adana), known from other ancient inscriptions. His stele was erected to mark the land that was gifted to Awariku by Tiglath-Pileser III. He is also known as the King of the Danunites (Danaans), or the &quot;Danunean king&quot;. He also describes himself as &#x27;the King of the dynasty of Mopsos&#x27;.

Some Assyriologists, such as Eckart Frahm and Paul-Alain Beaulieu, have speculated that Pulu was Tiglath-Pileser&#x27;s original name before he became king and assumed his regnal name or perhaps a nickname.

According to Gertoux, Tiglath-Pileser III was the son of Adad-nīrārī III, and used the name Pulu as a young co-regent under previous kings. When he won the kingship of Babylon, for the last two years of his life, this again became his official name in Babylon. Gertoux explains the derivation of this name as a hypocoristic use of the word &quot;aplu&quot; “the heir”.

=== Assyria before Tiglath-Pileser ===

Assyria first rose as a prominent state under the Middle Assyrian Empire in the 14th century BC, previously only having been a city-state centered on the city of Assur. From the 12th century BC onwards, the Middle Assyrian Empire entered into a period of decline, becoming increasingly restricted to just the Assyrian heartland itself. Though the decline was at times halted by energetic warrior-kings, reconquests were not lasting until the time of Ashur-dan II (934–912 BC), who campaigned in the northeast and northwest. The accession of Ashur-dan&#x27;s son Adad-nirari II (911–891 BC) traditionally marks the beginning of the Neo-Assyrian Empire. 

Under the early Neo-Assyrian kings, there was a gradual reconquest of former Assyrian lands. The success of this project was an extraordinary achievement given that the kings essentially had to rebuild the Assyrian Empire from scratch. Under Ashurnasirpal II (883–859 BC) the Neo-Assyrian Empire rose to become the dominant political power in the ancient Near East. Ashurnasirpal&#x27;s son Shalmaneser III (859–824 BC) further expanded Assyrian territory but his enlarged domain proved difficult to stabilize and his last few years initiated a renewed period of stagnation and decline, marked by both external and internal conflict.
The most important problems facing Shalmaneser late in his reign were the rise of the kingdom of Urartu in the north and the increasing political authority and influence of the &quot;magnates&quot;, a set of influential Assyrian courtiers and officials. The rise of Urartu threatened Assyrian hegemony since submission to Urartu was viewed by many vassal states as a realistic alternative to Assyria. The Urartian administration, culture, writing system and religion closely followed those of Assyria. The Urartian kings were also autocrats highly similar to the Assyrian kings. The imperialist expansionism undertaken by the kings of both Urartu and Assyria led to frequent military clashes between the two, despite being separated by the Taurus Mountains. 

For a brief time, the Urartian army equalled that of Assyria; though the Assyrians scored many victories against Urartu, notably plundering Urartu&#x27;s heartland late in Shalmaneser&#x27;s reign, the Urartians scored victories of their own. In 754, the Urartian king Sarduri II defeated the Assyrian army under Ashur-nirari V at Arpad, an event that may have led to the Assyrian army not campaigning for several years. The Assyrian kings were unable to deal with external threats since the magnates had gradually become the dominant political actors and central authority had become very weak. 

The reigns of Tiglath-Pileser&#x27;s three predecessors Shalmaneser IV (783–773 BC), Ashur-dan III (773–755 BC) and Ashur-nirari V was the low point of Assyrian royal power. In Shalmaneser IV&#x27;s reign, the &quot;turtanu&quot; (commander-in-chief) Shamshi-ilu was bold enough to credit military victories to himself rather than the king. Ashur-nirari V appears to have been relatively idle as a ruler. He campaigned only three times, staying in Assyria throughout the majority of his reign, and he is not known to have conducted any building projects.

== Reign ==

=== Reforms and policies ===

One of Tiglath-Pileser&#x27;s important early reforms was reducing the influence of the magnates, thus increasing the authority of the king. The division of the large provinces previously governed by the magnates into smaller units, placed under royally appointed provincial governors, reduced the wealth and power of the magnates. The right to commission inscriptions concerning military and building activities was withdrawn from officials and henceforth restricted to the king. Some historically prominent officials, such as the &quot;turtanu&quot; Shamshi-ilu, were subjected to &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot;, with their names being deliberately erased from inscriptions and documents. With these reforms, the power of the magnates to challenge the king was virtually eliminated.

Tiglath-Pileser revitalized the Assyrian army, transforming it from a seasonally active army, only assembled in the summer months, consisting only of conscripts, into a professional army. Under Tiglath-Pileser these conscripts were largely replaced with trained specialized soldiers. He introduced new and superior weapons, technologies and logistics. Among his major innovations were new forms of siege engines. The central standing army introduced under Tiglath-Pileser was dubbed the &quot;kiṣir šarri&quot; (&quot;king&#x27;s unit&quot;). 

The size of the army was further increased throughout Tiglath-Pileser&#x27;s reign through the recruitment of soldiers from the various lands the Assyrians conquered and through the recruitment of mercenaries from Babylonia, the Zagros Mountains and Anatolia. Though Tiglath-Pileser&#x27;s conquests generated a massive amount of revenue, he appears to have invested little of it into the Assyrian heartland itself; the only known building work conducted by him was a new palace in Nimrud. Instead, most of the money probably went into establishing the new army and into projects in the provinces.

Tiglath-Pileser&#x27;s conquests were marked by brutality, to emphasize the king&#x27;s strength and power. Resettlements of tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of people were also a common practice. Though previous kings had resettled people, Tiglath-Pileser&#x27;s reign saw the beginning of frequent mass deportations, a policy which continued under his successors. There were two intended goals of this policy: firstly to reduce the local identities in conquered regions, to counteract the risk of revolt, and secondly to recruit and move laborers to where the Assyrian kings needed them, such as underdeveloped and underutilized provinces. Though the Assyrian resettlements were probably devastating both for the resettled people and the regions they came from, resettled people were not harmed or killed. Deportees were highly valued for their labor and abilities. Their journeys and new settlements were designed to be as safe and comfortable as possible. 

=== Wars and conquests ===

==== Early campaigns ====

In addition to his reforms, Tiglath-Pileser&#x27;s reign is marked by a series of large-scale military campaigns in all directions. Though Tiglath-Pileser recorded his military exploits in great detail in his &quot;annals&quot;, written on sculpted stone slabs decorating his palace in Nimrud, these are poorly preserved, meaning that for several of his campaigns it is only possible to produce a broad outline. Tiglath-Pileser&#x27;s first campaign was conducted already in 744, when he assaulted Babylonian lands on the east side of the Tigris river. This conflict was resolved swiftly, with the Assyro-Babylonian border shifted in Tiglath-Pileser&#x27;s favor. In 743, Tiglath-Pileser campaigned in the region around the Zagros Mountains, where he created the two new provinces Bit‐Ḫamban and Parsua. The new Zagros provinces were founded along a highly important trade route, the predecessor of the later Silk Road.

The Assyrian successes in 744 and 743 demonstrated to the empire&#x27;s neighbors that the time of Assyrian stagnation was over. Tiglath-Pileser&#x27;s success inspired Iranzu, king of the Mannaeans, a people who lived in northwestern Iran, to personally meet with Tiglath-Pileser in 744 and forge an alliance. Iranzu&#x27;s predecessors had usually maintained their kingdom&#x27;s independence through changing allegiance between Urartu and Assyria, but Iranzu made a firm choice to side with Assyria and Tiglath-Pileser eagerly accepted the alliance since Iranzu&#x27;s realm was ideally placed to protect Assyria from Urartian raids.

These developments worried Sarduri II of Urartu, who intensified his efforts to oppose and overtake Assyrian hegemony. Later in 743, Sarduri arrived at the Euphrates river border of Assyria with his army, his forces bolstered by troops sent by various kingdoms and states in Syria. In the same year, Tiglath-Pileser engaged Sarduri in battle near Arpad. Unlike the Assyrian defeat by Arpad eleven years earlier, Tiglath-Pileser won the battle, one of the greatest triumphs of his reign. Sarduri was forced to flee the battle and was pursued back to the Urartian capital of Tushpa.

==== Conquest of the Levant ====

In the period from 743 to 732, Tiglath-Pileser led several campaigns in the Levant, which led to a great annexation of territory and the loss of independence of numerous ancient states in the region. After defeating Sarduri, Tiglath-Pileser resolved to conquer Arpad itself, both because of the city&#x27;s strategic value and in order to punish the city for providing Sarduri access to the Assyrian frontier. After three campaigns over the course of three years and a lengthy siege, Arpad was captured in 740. 

During the fighting, Arpad was assisted by both Urartian troops and by troops sent by other cities and minor states in Syria. After the city was captured, the Assyrian army did not simply plunder it and then leave, as they had dealt with cities in Syria in previous times. Instead, the lands controlled by Arpad were converted into two provinces and annexed into the Neo-Assyrian Empire. After his victory at Arpad, Tiglath-Pileser received tribute from the Syro-Hittite kingdoms of Gurgum and Kummuh, Carchemish and Quwê, some of which had previously sent forces to aid Sarduri, as well as from the Phoenician city of Tyre and the Aramean kingdom of Aram-Damascus.

The annexation of Arpad put rulers throughout the Levant on the alert. In the period of Assyrian stagnation, many of the Levantine states had aspired to expand and become large kingdoms in their own right, something the Assyrians might have perceived as an anti-Assyrian activity. In 738, Tiglath-Pileser continued his efforts in Syria, conquering some lands to the south of Arpad and establishing the three new provinces of Kullania, Ḫatarikka, and Ṣimirra. These lands had been under the rule of the Syro-Hittite kingdom of Hama, which he accused of plotting against him. 

The strategy employed by Tiglath-Pileser in his successful conquest of the Levant was carefully thought out and prepared. Instead of attacking the strongholds of the larger states, he first subdued smaller kingdoms through fast and wide-ranging attacks. The early conquests brought coastal and flat lands under his rule, which meant that Assyrian troops in the later campaigns could march through the region fast and efficiently. During the campaign against Hama, Tiglath-Pileser conquered and annexed the Syro-Hittite kingdom of Pattin. Hama was spared full annexation, with the kingdom being allowed to remain somewhat independent as a vassal state. The victory inspired more states in the region to pay tribute to the Assyrians, including the Phoenician city of Byblos, the Kingdom of Israel and various states in eastern Anatolia and some Arab tribes. Israel and Damascus had sent aid to Hama during the conflict.

The Anatolian realms who began paying tribute to Assyria, five kingdoms in total, probably did so not out of fear of Assyrian conquest but rather in the hope of Assyrian aid against the expansionist kingdom of Phrygia, which threatened their existence. The Anatolians at times tried to play Assyria and Phrygia against each other, with disastrous consequences. In 730, Tiglath-Pileser attacked and removed king Wasusarma of Tabal from power after he stopped paying tribute, writing in his annals that Wasusarma &quot;acted as if he were the equal of Assyria&quot;.

Tiglath-Pileser marched on the Levant for the fifth time in 734, reaching as far south as the border of Egypt. This campaign resulted in the conquest of Gaza and the submission of numerous states, effectively bringing the entire Levant under direct or indirect Assyrian rule; Assyria and Egypt shared a border for the first time in history. Asqaluna, Judah, Edom, Moab and Ammon, and the Mu’na Arab tribe, all began paying tribute to Tiglath-Pileser. By extending his control throughout the Levant, Tiglath-Pileser formed a semi-circle of control around Israel and Aram-Damascus and cut them off from Egypt, which had at times offered support to the Levantine states. The Assyrian efforts resulted in Aram-Damascus becoming both geopolitically isolated and without a large enough food supply to feed its people.
In 733, Tiglath-Pileser resolved to cement his conquest. In this year, he again campaigned against Aram-Damascus, still the strongest remaining native state in the region, which was supported by the Assyrian tributaries Tyre and Asqaluna, as well as Israel. In 732, Damascus fell and Tiglath-Pileser annexed the lands of Aram-Damascus. In the same conflict, Tiglath-Pileser also captured Tyre and defeated Israel, which he divided in half, annexing the northern portion of the kingdom as the province Megiddo and subjugating the southern portion as a vassal kingdom. The weakening and enormous reduction in size of Israel was seen by the Israelites as vindicating predictions of impending doom made by the prophet Amos a few decades prior.

The massive western expansion of Assyria brought Tiglath-Pileser and his armies into direct contact with Arab tribes, several of whom began paying tribute. In 733, Tiglath-Pileser campaigned against the Qedarites to the south of Damascus, hoping to consolidate his control of southern Syria. The surprise attack caught the Qedarite queen Samsi off-guard and the Qedarites were easily defeated. Though Tiglath-Pileser was victorious, he realized that he would not be able to effectively govern the territories ruled by the Qedarites and thus allowed Samsi to remain in control of her domain, though under the supervision of an Assyrian official to guide her political actions.

==== Conquest of Babylonia ====

In his late reign, Tiglath-Pileser increasingly focused on Babylonia in the south. Babylonia had once been a large and hugely influential kingdom, competing with Assyria for centuries, but during the Neo-Assyrian period it was typically weaker than its northern neighbor. Babylonia suffered from both the lack of a well-organized army and from internal ethno-cultural divisions. Babylonians governed most of the prominent southern cities, such as Babylon, Kish, Ur, Uruk, Borsippa and Nippur, but were not the only prominent group in the region. Chaldean tribes, led by chieftains who often squabbled with each other, dominated most of the southernmost land. Arameans also lived on the fringes of settled land and were notorious for plundering surrounding territories. Through his agents, Tiglath-Pileser throughout his reign kept tabs on events in the south.

In 731, the Chaldean chieftain Nabu-mukin-zeri, of the Bit-Amukkani tribe, seized power in Babylon as king. Tiglath-Pileser saw the accession of Nabu-mukin-zeri, who aspired to heal the divides in Babylonia, as a provocation and threat to Assyrian interests and hegemony. Tiglath-Pileser thus dedicated the next several years to defeating Nabu-mukin-zeri and his supporters. First, Assyrian armies blockaded Babylonia&#x27;s eastern border to ensure that Nabu-mukin-zeri would not receive any support from Elam, which was often opposed to Assyrian interests. Then, Tiglath-Pileser defeated and subdued a number of Aramean clans and Chaldean tribes, including the Bit-Shilani and the Bit-Sha&#x27;alli.
The struggle for control of Babylonia began in earnest in 730. In this year, Assyrian envoys are recorded travelling to Babylon and urging the inhabitants to open their gates and surrender to Tiglath-Pileser, stating that the king would grant them amnesty and tax privileges. The Babylonians refused the offer. Nabu-mukin-zeri was not in Babylon at this time and was instead probably directing the Babylonian war effort from his ancestral home city of Sapia. In 729, Tiglath-Pileser captured Babylon and proclaimed himself as both king of Assyria and king of Babylon, the first Assyrian king to be recognized as such by the Babylonians. 

Nabu-mukin-zeri lost Sapia in the same year but appears to have continued to resist Tiglath-Pileser until 728 since there are some documents ascribed to his fourth regnal year. As the new king, Tiglath-Pileser received tribute from the most powerful Chaldean tribes, the Bit-Dakkuri and Bit-Yakin. The Bit-Yakin at this time was under the leadership of Marduk-apla-iddina II, who in the years following Tiglath-Pileser&#x27;s reign would emerge as a staunch adversary of Assyria.

Unlike many other Assyrian conquests, Babylonia was not divided into provinces but kept as a full kingdom, in personal union with Assyria. This was chiefly because the Assyrians greatly respected Babylonian culture and religion. Because of this respect and because Babylonia was showing signs of the beginning of an economic recovery, Tiglath-Pileser worked to conciliate the populace to the idea of Assyrian overlordship. He twice participated in the religiously important New Years&#x27; &quot;Akitu&quot; festival, which required the presence of the king, and also led campaigns against remaining Chaldean strongholds in the far south who resisted his rule.

== Family and succession ==

Tiglath-Pileser&#x27;s queen was named Iaba (&quot;Iabâ&quot;), a name clearly not of Akkadian origin. Possible roots and etymologies of the name include &quot;yph&quot; (&quot;beautiful&quot;), &quot;nby&quot; (&quot;to name&quot;) and &quot;yhb&quot; (&quot;to give&quot;); Iaba might have been of Arab or West Semitic (Levantine or Aramean) descent. In 1998, Stephanie Dalley proposed that Iaba was of Hebrew origin and speculated that she might have been a princess from the Kingdom of Judah. She based this argument on the name Atalia, a later queen speculated to have been related to Iaba, being similar to the name Athaliah, borne by a Judean queen who ruled about a century earlier, and that the ending of the name Atalia (&quot;i-a&quot; or &quot;ia-a&quot;) could represent a theophoric element deriving from Yahweh. Dalley&#x27;s arguments have met with both support and opposition. The idea that the names Iaba and Atalia were Hebrew has also been independently forwarded by Simo Parpola. 

In 2002, K. Lawson Younger pointed out that it was far from certain that &quot;i-a&quot; or &quot;ia-a&quot; actually corresponded to Yahweh since there are few analogues in other Neo-Assyrian names and inscriptions. The identification of Atalia as a Hebrew name was also doubted by Nicholas Postgate in 2008, and in that year Ran Zadok alternatively suggested that Atalia was an Arabic name. Iaba&#x27;s tomb was discovered at Nimrud in 1989.&quot;&quot;

Tiglath-Pileser is believed to have died peacefully of old age. He was succeeded by his son Shalmaneser V. In Tiglath-Pileser&#x27;s reign, Shalmaneser was known by his birth name Ululayu, &quot;Shalmaneser&quot; being a regnal name he assumed upon his accession to the throne in 727. Shalmaneser likely participated in some of his father&#x27;s campaigns and several letters are known from him to his father, many of them reports on the status of the lands he governed. Shalmaneser was replaced as king after only a few years by Sargon II, probably through being deposed and assassinated. Though Assyrian king lists connected Sargon to previous kings through claiming that he was the son of Tiglath-Pileser, this claim does not appear in most of his inscriptions, which instead stress that he was called upon and appointed as king by Ashur. 

Many historians accept Sargon&#x27;s claim to have been a son of Tiglath-Pileser, but do not believe him to have been the legitimate heir to the throne as the next-in-line after the end of Shalmaneser&#x27;s reign, i.e. assuming Shalmaneser had children. Even then, his claim to have been Tiglath-Pileser&#x27;s son is generally treated with more caution than Tiglath-Pileser&#x27;s own claims of royal ancestry. Some Assyriologists, such as J. A. Brinkman, believe that Sargon, at the very least, did not belong to the direct dynastic lineage. If Tiglath-Pileser was Sargon&#x27;s father, he also had a third son, Sin-ahu-usur. Sin-ahu-usur is attested as the younger brother of Sargon, in 714 granted the command of Sargon&#x27;s royal cavalry guard.

== Legacy ==

The Assyriologist Hayim Tadmor referred to Tiglath-Pileser&#x27;s reign as a &quot;watershed&quot; in the history of the Middle East. Tiglath-Pileser left a legacy of enormous historical significance. His reign is generally seen as marking the beginning of an entirely new age of Assyrian imperialism. As the earliest Assyrian king to be mentioned in the Hebrew Bible and in the Babylonian Chronicles, Tiglath-Pileser is the first Assyrian king for whom there exist outside perspectives and accounts of his reign. All Mesopotamian history prior to Tiglath-Pileser is ignored in the Hebrew Bible. The Bible records both Tiglath-Pileser&#x27;s impact on the Kingdom of Israel (2 Kings 15,29–31) and the events of his reign from the perspective of the southern Kingdom of Judah (2 Kings 15,32–16,20, 2 Chronicles 27,1–28,27, Isaiah, 7,1–25).

Tiglath-Pileser greatly expanded Assyrian territory. By the time of his death, Tiglath-Pileser had more than doubled the amount of land ruled by the Neo-Assyrian Empire. His method of introducing direct Assyrian rule to foreign lands, dividing them into Assyrian provinces rather than creating vassal kingdoms, significantly altered the economy of the Assyrian state. Whereas the Assyrians had previously relied on tribute from vassals, from Tiglath-Pileser&#x27;s time they became increasingly dependent on taxes collected by provincial governors. This approach increased administrative costs but also reduced the risk of uprisings against Assyrian rule and reduced the need for military intervention.

Several Assyriologists consider Assyria to only truly have transitioned into an &quot;empire&quot; in a strict sense during the reign of Tiglath-Pileser, owing to its unprecedented size, multi-ethnic and multi-lingual character and the new mechanisms of economic and political control. The supremacy attained by Assyria under Tiglath-Pileser is frequently seen as turning the Neo-Assyrian Empire into the first world empire in history; i.e. an imperial state without any competitors, ruling most of the world as known to the Assyrians themselves. 

The Assyrian Empire served as the model for later empires in the Middle East and elsewhere, chiefly because of the imperial innovations of Tiglath-Pileser. Through the concept of &quot;translatio imperii&quot; (transfer of empire) the claim to world domination forwarded by the Neo-Assyrian kings gave rise to similar claims in later Middle Eastern empires, notably the Achaemenid Empire, which facilitated the rise of aspirations for universal rule in numerous later kingdoms and empires. 

The Assyrian resettlement policy which intensified under Tiglath-Pileser and continued under his successors had large-scale consequences. First and foremost, it led to significant improvements in irrigation in the provinces, owing to deportees being tasked to introduce Assyrian-developed agricultural techniques to their new communities, and to an increase in prosperity across the empire. In the long term, the movement of peoples from across the empire changed the cultural and ethnic makeup of the Middle East forever and in time led to the rise of Aramaic as the region&#x27;s lingua franca, a position the language retained until the 14th century AD. 

Aramaic was the most widely spoken and mutually understandable of the empire&#x27;s Semitic languages, the group to which many of the languages in the empire belonged. Already in Tiglath-Pileser&#x27;s reign, Aramaic became an official language in the empire, indicated by reliefs from his time depicting the king using both Aramaic and Akkadian scribes to record messages.

<text>Thyine wood is a 15th-century English name for a wood from the tree known botanically as &quot;Tetraclinis articulata&quot; (syn. &quot;Callitris quadrivalvis&quot;, &quot;Thuja articulata&quot;). The name is derived from the Greek word &quot;thuon&quot;, &quot;fragrant wood,&quot; or possibly &quot;thuein&quot;, “to sacrifice”, and it was so called because it was burnt in sacrifices, on account of its fragrance.

In Rome, wood from this tree was called &quot;citrum&quot;, &quot;citrus wood&quot;. It was considered very valuable, and was used for making articles of furniture by the Greeks and Romans. Craftsmen who worked in citrus wood and ivory had their own guild &quot;(collegium)&quot;.

Thyine wood is mentioned in the King James Version of the Bible at Revelation 18:12 as being among the articles which would cease to be purchased when Babylon fell. The New International Version translates the passage &quot;citron wood&quot;; the Amplified Bible translates it as &quot;scented wood&quot;. This wood is also mentioned in the 1st Book of Kings, chapter 10, in a list of items brought to Solomon by the navy of Hiram.

The resin is used as the basis for euparal, a mounting medium used in microscopy.

<text>Tre Taverne (; , &quot;Treis Tabernai&quot;) was a place on the ancient Appian Way, about 50 km (31 miles) from Rome, designed for the reception of travellers, as the name indicates.

==History==
Tres Tabernae originated as a post station on the Appian Way (), around the 3rd century BC.

Here, the Christian saint Paul of Tarsus, on his way to Rome, was reportedly met by a band of Roman Christians (Acts 28:15). The &quot;Tres Tabernae was the first &quot;mansio&quot; or &quot;mutatio&quot;, that is, halting-place for relays, from Rome, or the last on the way to the city. At this point three roads run into the Via Appia, that from Tusculum, that from Alba Longa, and that from Antium; so necessarily here would be a halting-place, which took its name from the three shops there, the general store, the blacksmith&#x27;s, and the refreshment-house...Tres Tabernae is translated as Three Taverns, but it more correctly means three shops&quot;.

The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition identifies it as &quot;an ancient village of Latium, Italy, a post station on the Via Appia, at the point where the main road was crossed by a branch from Antium&quot;. It is by some fixed some 3 m. S.E. of the modern village of Cisterna just before the Via Appia enters the Pontine Marshes, at a point where the modern road to Ninfa and Norba diverges to the north-east, where a few ruins still exist (&quot;Grotte di Nottola&quot;), 33 m. from Rome. Others believe that it stood at Cisterna itself, where a branch road running from Antium by way of Satricum actually joins the Via Appia. However, excavations that took place at km 58.1 of the Via Appia Nuova between 1993 and 2001 revealed a bath plant and some further buildings.

Around the 3rd century AD, the area was invaded by marshes, and the inhabitants of the nearby &quot;Ulubrae&quot; likely moved to &quot;Tres Tabernae&quot;, which grew of importance and became a Christian episcopal see with a Palaeo-Christian cathedral dedicated to St. Paul. In 307, emperor Flavius Severus was assassinated (or forced to commit suicide) here by Heraclius, by order of other emperors Maximian and Maxentius. The barbaric invasions in Italy caused a further expansions of the marshes, and Tres Tabernae declined so that, in 592, Pope Gregory I united its diocese to that of Velletri. Later in the high Middle Ages, Tres Tabernae was ravaged several times by the Saracens, until it was completely destroyed in 868.

The position of the Tres Tabernae is also shown in the Tabula Peutingeriana in a location south of Rome.

<text>The &quot;March of the Volunteers&quot;, originally titled the &quot;March of the Anti-Manchukuo Counter-Japan Volunteers&quot;, has been the official national anthem of the People&#x27;s Republic of China since 1978. Unlike previous Chinese state anthems, it was written entirely in vernacular Chinese, rather than in Classical Chinese.

The Japanese invasion of Manchuria saw a boom of nationalistic arts and literature in China. This song had its lyrics written first by the communist playwright Tian Han in 1934, then set to melody by Nie Er and arranged by Aaron Avshalomov for the communist-aligned film &quot;Children of Troubled Times&quot; (1935). It became a famous military song during the Second Sino-Japanese War beyond the communist faction, most notably the Nationalist general Dai Anlan designated it to be the anthem of the 200th Division, who fought in Burma. It was adopted as the PRC&#x27;s provisional anthem in 1949 in place of the &quot;Three Principles of the People&quot; of the Republic of China and the Communist &quot;Internationale&quot;. During the Cultural Revolution, Tian Han was criticized and placed in prison, where he died in 1968. The song was briefly and unofficially replaced by &quot;The East Is Red&quot;, then reinstated but played without lyrics, restored to official status in 1978 with altered lyrics, before the original version was fully restored in 1982.

== History ==

The lyrics of the &quot;March of the Volunteers&quot;, also formally known as the National Anthem of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, were composed by Tian Han in 1934 as two stanzas in his poem &quot;The Great Wall&quot; (), () intended either for a play he was working on at the time or as part of the script for Diantong&#x27;s upcoming film &quot;Children of Troubled Times&quot;. The film is a story about a Chinese intellectual who flees during the Shanghai Incident to a life of luxury in Qingdao, only to be driven to fight the Japanese occupation of Manchuria after learning of the death of his friend. Urban legends later circulated that Tian wrote it in jail on rolling paper or the liner paper from cigarette boxes after being arrested in Shanghai by the Nationalists; in fact, he was arrested in Shanghai and held in Nanjing just after completing his draft for the film. During March and April 1935, in Japan, Nie Er set the words (with minor adjustments) to music; in May, Diantong&#x27;s sound director He Luting had the Russian composer Aaron Avshalomov arrange their orchestral accompaniment. The song was performed by Gu Menghe and Yuan Muzhi, along with a small and &quot;hastily-assembled&quot; chorus; He Luting consciously chose to use their first take, which preserved the Cantonese accent of several of the men. On 9 May, Gu and Yuan recorded it in more standard Mandarin for Pathé Orient&#x27;s Shanghai branch ahead of the movie&#x27;s release, so that it served as a form of advertising for the film.

Originally translated as &quot;Volunteers Marching On&quot;, the English name references the several volunteer armies that opposed Japan&#x27;s invasion of Manchuria in the 1930s; the Chinese name is a poetic variation—literally, the &quot;Righteous and Brave Armies&quot;—that also appears in other songs of the time, such as the 1937 &quot;Sword March&quot;.

In May 1935, the same month as the movie&#x27;s release, Lü Ji and other leftists in Shanghai had begun an amateur choir and started promoting a National Salvation singing campaign, supporting mass singing associations along the lines established the year before by Liu Liangmo, a Shanghai YMCA leader. Although the movie did not perform well enough to keep Diantong from closing, its theme song became wildly popular: musicologist Feng Zikai reported hearing it being sung by crowds in rural villages from Zhejiang to Hunan within months of its release and, at a performance at a Shanghai sports stadium in June 1936, Liu&#x27;s chorus of hundreds was joined by its audience of thousands. Although Tian Han was imprisoned for two years, Nie Er fled to the Soviet Union, only to die en route in Japan; and Liu Liangmo eventually fled to the U.S. to escape harassment from the Nationalists. The singing campaign continued to expand, particularly after the December 1936 Xi&#x27;an Incident reduced Nationalist pressure against leftist movements. Visiting St Paul&#x27;s Hospital at the Anglican mission at Guide (now Shangqiu, Henan), W.H. Auden and Christopher Isherwood reported hearing a &quot;Chee Lai!&quot; treated as a hymn at the mission service and the same tune &quot;set to different words&quot; treated as a favorite song of the Eighth Route Army.

The Pathé recording of the march appeared prominently in Joris Ivens&#x27;s 1939 &quot;The 400 Million&quot;, an English-language documentary on the war in China. The same year, Lee Pao-chen included it with a parallel English translation in a songbook published in the new Chinese capital Chongqing; this version would later be disseminated throughout the United States for children&#x27;s musical education during World War II before being curtailed at the onset of the Cold War. The &quot;New York Times&quot; published the song&#x27;s sheet music on 24 December, along with an analysis by a Chinese correspondent in Chongqing. In exile in New York City in 1940, Liu Liangmo taught it to Paul Robeson, the college-educated polyglot folk-singing son of a runaway slave. Robeson began performing the song in Chinese at a large concert in New York City&#x27;s Lewisohn Stadium. Reportedly in communication with the original lyricist Tian Han, the pair translated it into English and recorded it in both languages as (&quot;Arise!&quot;) for Keynote Records in early 1941. Its 3-disc album included a booklet whose preface was written by Soong Ching-ling, widow of Sun Yat-sen, and its initial proceeds were donated to the Chinese resistance. Robeson gave further live performances at benefits for the China Aid Council and United China Relief, although he gave the stage to Liu and the Chinese themselves for the song&#x27;s performance at their sold-out concert at Washington&#x27;s Uline Arena on 24 April 1941. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor and beginning of the Pacific War, the march was played locally in India, Singapore, and other locales in Southeast Asia; the Robeson recording was played frequently on British, American, and Soviet radio; and a cover version performed by the Army Air Force Orchestra appears as the introductory music to Frank Capra&#x27;s 1944 propaganda film &quot;The Battle of China&quot; and again during its coverage of the Chinese response to the Rape of Nanking.

The &quot;March of the Volunteers&quot; was used as the Chinese national anthem for the first time at the World Peace Conference in April 1949. Originally intended for Paris, French authorities refused so many visas for its delegates that a parallel conference was held in Prague, Czechoslovakia. At the time, Beijing had recently come under the control of the Chinese Communists in the Chinese Civil War and its delegates attended the Prague conference in China&#x27;s name. There was controversy over the third line, &quot;The Chinese nation faces its greatest peril&quot;, so the writer Guo Moruo changed it for the event to &quot;The Chinese nation has arrived at its moment of emancipation&quot;. The song was personally performed by Paul Robeson.

In June, a committee was set up by the Chinese Communist Party to decide on an official national anthem for the soon-to-be declared People&#x27;s Republic of China. By the end of August, the committee had received 632 entries totaling 694 different sets of scores and lyrics. The &quot;March of the Volunteers&quot; was suggested by the painter Xu Beihong and supported by Zhou Enlai. Opposition to its use centered on the third line, as &quot;The Chinese people face their greatest peril&quot; suggested that China continued to face difficulties. Zhou replied, &quot;We still have imperialist enemies in front of us. The more we progress in development, the more the imperialists will hate us, seek to undermine us, attack us. Can you say that we won&#x27;t be in peril?&quot; His view was supported by Mao Zedong and, on 27 September 1949, the song became the provisional national anthem, just days before the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic. The highly fictionalized biopic &quot;Nie Er&quot; was produced in 1959 for its 10th anniversary; for its 50th in 1999, &quot;The National Anthem&quot; retold the story of the anthem&#x27;s composition from Tian Han&#x27;s point of view.

Although the song had been popular among Nationalists during the war against Japan, its performance was then banned in the territories of the Republic of China until the 1990s.
The 1 February 1966 &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; article condemning Tian Han&#x27;s 1961 allegorical Peking opera &quot;Xie Yaohuan&quot; as a &quot;big poisonous weed&quot; was one of the opening salvos of the Cultural Revolution, during which he was imprisoned and his words forbidden to be sung. As a result, there was a time when &quot;The East Is Red&quot; served as the PRC&#x27;s unofficial anthem. Following the 9th National Congress, &quot;The March of the Volunteers&quot; began to be played once again from the 20th National Day Parade in 1969, although performances were solely instrumental. Tian Han died in prison in 1968, but Paul Robeson continued to send the royalties from his American recordings of the song to Tian&#x27;s family.

The anthem was restored by the 5th National People&#x27;s Congress on 5 March 1978, but with rewritten lyrics including references to the Chinese Communist Party, communism, and Chairman Mao. Following Tian Han&#x27;s posthumous rehabilitation in 1979 and Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s consolidation of power over Hua Guofeng, the National People&#x27;s Congress resolved to restore Tian Han&#x27;s original verses to the march and to elevate its status, making it the country&#x27;s official national anthem on 4 December 1982.

The anthem&#x27;s status was enshrined as an amendment to the Constitution of the People&#x27;s Republic of China on 14 March 2004.
On 1 September 2017, &quot;The Law of the National Anthem of the People&#x27;s Republic of China&quot;, which protects the anthem by law, was passed by the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress and took effect one month later. The anthem is considered to be a national symbol of China. The anthem should be performed or reproduced especially at celebrations of national holidays and anniversaries, as well as sporting events. Civilians and organizations should pay respect to the anthem by standing and singing in a dignified manner. Personnel of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army, the People&#x27;s Armed Police and the People&#x27;s Police of the Ministry of Public Security salute when not in formation when the anthem is played, the same case for members of the Young Pioneers of China and PLA veterans.

==Special administrative regions==
The anthem was played during the handover of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom in 1997 and during the handover of Macau from Portugal in 1999. It was adopted as part of Annex III of the Basic Law of Hong Kong, taking effect on 1 July 1997, and as part of Annex III of the Basic Law of Macau, taking effect on 20 December 1999.

=== Macau ===
The use of the anthem in the Macau Special Administrative Region is particularly governed by Law No.5/1999, which was enacted on 20 December 1999. Article 7 of the law requires that the anthem be accurately performed pursuant to the sheet music in its Appendix 4 and prohibits the lyrics from being altered. Under Article 9, willful alteration of the music or lyrics is criminally punishable by imprisonment of up to two years or up to 360 day-fines and, although both Chinese and Portuguese are official languages of the region, the provided sheet music has its lyrics only in Chinese. Mainland China has also passed a similar law in 2017.

=== Hong Kong ===
Nonetheless, the Chinese National Anthem in Mandarin now forms a mandatory part of public secondary education in Hong Kong as well. The local government issued a circular in May 1998 requiring government-funded schools to perform flag-raising ceremonies involving the singing of the &quot;March of the Volunteers&quot; on particular days: the first day of school, the &quot;open day&quot;, National Day (1 October), New Year&#x27;s (1 January), the &quot;sport day&quot;, Establishment Day (1 July), the graduation ceremony, and for some other school-organized events; the circular was also sent to the SAR&#x27;s private schools. The official policy was long ignored, but—following massive and unexpected public demonstrations in 2003 against proposed anti-subversion laws—the ruling was reiterated in 2004 and, by 2008, most schools were holding such ceremonies at least once or twice a year. From National Day in 2004, as well, Hong Kong&#x27;s local television networks have also been required to preface their evening news with government-prepared promotional videos including the national anthem in Mandarin. Initially a pilot program planned for a few months, it has continued ever since. Viewed by many as propaganda, even after a sharp increase in support in the preceding four years, by 2006, the majority of Hongkongers remained neither proud nor fond of the anthem. On 4 November 2017, the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress decided to insert a Chinese National Anthem Law into the Annex III of the Basic Law of Hong Kong, which would make it illegal to insult or not show sufficient respect to the Chinese national anthem. On 4 June 2020, the National Anthem Bill was passed in Hong Kong after being approved by the Legislative Council.

A 1939 bilingual songbook which included the song called it &quot;a good example of...copy[ing] the good points from Western music without impairing or losing our own national color&quot;. Nie&#x27;s piece is a march, a Western form, opening with a bugle call and a motif (with which it also closes) based on an ascending fourth interval from D to G inspired by &quot;The &quot;Internationale&quot;&quot;. Its rhythmic patterns of triplets, accented downbeats, and syncopation and use (with the exception of one note, F in the first verse) of the G major pentatonic scale, however, create an effect of becoming &quot;progressively more Chinese in character&quot; over the course of the tune. For reasons both musical and political, Nie came to be regarded as a model composer by Chinese musicians in the Maoist era. Howard Taubman, the &quot;New York Times&quot; music editor, initially panned the tune as telling us China&#x27;s &quot;fight is more momentous than her art&quot; although, after US entrance into the war, he called its performance &quot;delightful&quot;.

<doc id="69146" wikidata="Q17032955" url="?curid=69146" title="Thorn in the flesh">
<text>Thorn in the flesh is a phrase of New Testament origin used to describe an annoyance, or trouble in one&#x27;s life, drawn from Paul the Apostle&#x27;s use of the phrase in his Second Epistle to the Corinthians 12:7–9:

Other biblical passages where &quot;thorn&quot; is used as a metaphor are:

The standard English translation was popularised by the 1611 King James Version of the Bible. Among earlier translations, the 1526 Tyndale Bible uses &quot;vnquyetnes&quot; (&quot;unquietness&quot;) rather than &quot;thorn&quot;, and the 1557 Geneva Bible refers to a &quot;pricke in the fleshe&quot;.

== Biblical meaning ==
Paul mentions what the &quot;thorn in his flesh&quot; was in 2 Corinthians 12:6-7 when he said (Verse 6) &quot;...lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me. (Verse 7) And lest I should be exalted above measure through &#x27;the abundance of revelations&#x27;, there was given to me &#x27;a thorn in the flesh&#x27;...&quot; from &quot;the abundance of revelations&quot; and how people perceived him or &quot;...man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me.&quot;

Paul does not specify the nature of his &quot;thorn,&quot; and his other epistles do not directly address the topic. Throughout church history, there has been a significant amount of speculation about what Paul was referring to, although scholars such as Philip Edgcumbe Hughes, F. F. Bruce and Ralph P. Martin conclude that definite identification of the thorn is impossible with the evidence available. Other scholars such as B. J. Oropeza, M. David Litwa, and Paula R. Gooder suggest that the thorn refers to the messenger of Satan who harmed Paul during his third heaven experience.

The &quot;thorn&quot; is most commonly interpreted in relation to persecutions or hardships Paul faced.

Other interpretations include:
# One pre-Vatican II Roman Catholic writer thought that it denotes suggestions of impiety.
# Paul&#x27;s agony over Jewish rejection of the gospel
# A reference to Paul&#x27;s opponents
# A physical ailment

== Modern usage ==
The phrase &quot;thorn in the flesh&quot; continues to be used as a metaphor for &quot;a source of continual annoyance or trouble.&quot; It is synonymous with the phrase &quot;thorn in the side&quot;, which is also of biblical origin, based on the description in Numbers 33:55. As an example usage, the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; cites E. M. Forster&#x27;s 1924 novel &quot;A Passage to India&quot;, in which Nawab Bahadur says, &quot;I can be a thorn in Mr. Turton&#x27;s flesh, and if he asks me I accept the invitation.&quot;

<doc id="69147" wikidata="Q41179" url="?curid=69147" title="Mekong">
<text>The Mekong or Mekong River ( , ) is a transboundary river in East Asia and Southeast Asia. It is the world&#x27;s twelfth-longest river and the third-longest in Asia with an estimated length of and a drainage area of , discharging of water annually.
From its headwaters in the Tibetan Plateau, the river runs through Southwest China (where it is officially called the Lancang River), Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and southern Vietnam. The extreme seasonal variations in flow and the presence of rapids and waterfalls in the Mekong make navigation difficult, though the river remains a major trade route between Tibet and Southeast Asia. The construction of hydroelectric dams along the Mekong in the 2000s through the 2020s has caused serious problems for the river&#x27;s ecosystem, including the exacerbation of drought.

==Names==
The Mekong was originally called &quot;Mae Nam Khong&quot; from a contracted form of Kra-Dai shortened to &quot;Mae Khong&quot;. In Thai and Lao, &quot;Mae Nam&quot; (&quot;Mother of Water[s]&quot;) is used for large rivers and &quot;Khong&quot; is the proper name referred to as &quot;River Khong&quot;. However, &quot;Khong&quot; is an archaic word meaning &quot;river&quot;, loaned from Austroasiatic languages, such as Vietnamese &quot;sông&quot; (from *&quot;krong&quot;) and Mon &quot;kruŋ&quot; &quot;river&quot;, which led to Chinese whose Old Chinese pronunciation has been reconstructed as and which long served as the proper name of the Yangtze before becoming a generic word for major rivers. To the early European traders, the Mekong River was also known as &quot;Mekon River&quot;, &quot;May-Kiang River&quot; and &quot;Cambodia River&quot;.

The local names for the river include:
# From Tai:
#*, , or just .
#*, , or just .
#*, , or just .
#*, , or just .
#*Tai Lue: , .
#* or .
# Other:
#* () or , ( &quot;Nine Dragons River&quot; ).
#*Chinese: .
#* &quot;Tônlé Thum&quot; (lit. &quot;Big River&quot; or &quot;Great River&quot;) or &quot;Mékôngk&quot; , &quot;Tônlé Mékôngk&quot; .
#*Khmuic: , &quot; means &#x27;river&#x27; or &#x27;water&#x27;, here it means &#x27;river&#x27;, &quot; means &#x27;canal&#x27;. So &quot; means &#x27;canal river&#x27;. In the ancient time Khmuic people called it &quot; or &quot; which means &#x27;giant canal river&#x27; or &#x27;deep canal river&#x27; respectively.

==Course==
The Mekong rises as the Za Qu (; ) and soon becomes known as the Lancang River (, from the old name of Lao kingdom Lan Xang; the characters may also be literally understood as &quot;turbulent green river&quot;). It originates in the &quot;three rivers source area&quot; on the Tibetan Plateau in the Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve. The reserve protects the headwaters of, from north to south, the Yellow (Huang He), the Yangtze, and the Mekong Rivers. It flows through the Tibetan Autonomous Region and then southeast into Yunnan Province, and then the Three Parallel Rivers Area in the Hengduan Mountains, along with the Yangtze to its east and the Salween River (Nu Jiang in Chinese) to its west.

Then the Mekong meets the China–Myanmar border and flows about along that border until it reaches the tripoint of China, Myanmar and Laos. From there it flows southwest and forms the border of Myanmar and Laos for about until it arrives at the tripoint of Myanmar, Laos, and Thailand. This is also the point of confluence between the Ruak River (which follows the Thai–Myanmar border) and the Mekong. The area of this tripoint is sometimes termed the Golden Triangle, although the term also refers to the much larger area of those three countries that was notorious as a drug producing region.

From the Golden Triangle tripoint, the Mekong turns southeast to briefly form the border of Laos with Thailand.

Khon Pi Long is a series of rapids along a section of the Mekong River dividing Chiang Rai and Bokeo Province in Laos. The name of the rapids means &#x27;where the ghost lost its way&#x27;. It then turns east into the interior of Laos, flowing first east and then south for some before meeting the border with Thailand again. Once more, it defines the Laos-Thailand border for some as it flows first east, passing the capital of Laos, Vientiane, then turns south. A second time, the river leaves the border and flows east into Laos soon passing the city of Pakse. Thereafter, it turns and runs more or less directly south, crossing into Cambodia.

At Phnom Penh the river is joined on the right bank by the river and lake system the Tonlé Sap. When the Mekong is low, the Tonle Sap is a tributary: water flows from the lake and river into the Mekong. When the Mekong floods, the flow reverses: the floodwaters of the Mekong flow up the Tonle Sap.

Immediately after the Sap River joins the Mekong by Phnom Penh, the Bassac River branches off the right (west) bank. The Bassac River is the first and main distributary of the Mekong. This is the beginning of the Mekong Delta. The two rivers, the Bassac to the west and the Mekong to the east, enter Vietnam shortly after this. In Vietnam, the Bassac is called the Hậu River (Sông Hậu or Hậu Giang); the main, eastern, branch of the Mekong is called the Tiền River or Tiền Giang. In Vietnam, distributaries of the eastern (main, Mekong) branch include the Mỹ Tho River, the Ba Lai River, the Hàm Luông River, and the Cổ Chiên River.

==Drainage basin==


The Mekong Basin is frequently divided into two parts: the &quot;upper Mekong basin&quot; comprising those parts of the basin in Tibet, Yunnan and eastern Myanmar, and the &quot;lower Mekong basin&quot; from Yunnan downstream from China to the South China Sea. From the point where it rises to its mouth, the most precipitous drop in the Mekong occurs in the upper Mekong basin, a stretch of some . Here, it drops before it enters the lower basin where the borders of Thailand, Laos, China, and Myanmar come together in the Golden Triangle. Downstream from the Golden Triangle, the river flows for a further through Laos, Thailand, and Cambodia before entering the South China Sea via a complex delta system in Vietnam.

===Upper basin===
The upper basin makes up 24% of the total area and contributes 15–20% of the water that flows into the Mekong River. The catchment here is steep and narrow with Soil erosion being a major problem and as a result of this, approximately 50% of the sediment in the river comes from the upper basin.

In Yunnan Province in China, the river and its tributaries are confined by narrow, deep gorges. The tributary river systems in this part of the basin are small. Only 14 have catchment areas that exceed , yet the greatest amount of loss of forest cover in the entire river system per square kilometer has occurred in this region due to heavy unchecked demand for natural resources. In the south of Yunnan, in Simao and Xishuangbanna Prefectures, the river changes as the valley opens out, the floodplain becomes wider, and the river becomes wider and slower.

===Lower basin===
Major tributary systems develop in the lower basin. These systems can be separated into two groups: tributaries that contribute to the major wet season flows, and tributaries that drain low relief regions of lower rainfall. The first group are left bank tributaries that drain the high rainfall areas of Laos. The second group are those on the right bank, mainly the Mun and Chi Rivers, that drain a large part of northeast Thailand.

Laos lies almost entirely within the lower Mekong basin. Its climate, landscape and land use are the major factors shaping the hydrology of the river. The mountainous landscape means that only 16% of the country is farmed under lowland terrace or upland shifting cultivation. With upland shifting agriculture (slash and burn), soils recover within 10 to 20 years but the vegetation does not. Shifting cultivation is common in the uplands of northern Laos and is reported to account for as much as 27% of the total land under rice cultivation. As elsewhere in the basin, forest cover has been steadily reduced during the last three decades by shifting agriculture and permanent agriculture. The cumulative impacts of these activities on the river regime have not been measured. However, the hydrological impacts of land cover changes induced by the Vietnam War were quantified in two sub-catchments of the lower Mekong River basin.

Loss of forest cover in the Thai areas of the lower basin has been the highest of all the lower Mekong countries over the past 60 years. On the Khorat Plateau, which includes the Mun and Chi tributary systems, forest cover was reduced from 42% in 1961 to 13% in 1993. Although this part of northeast Thailand has an annual rainfall of more than , a high evaporation rate means it is classified as a semi-arid region. Consequently, although the Mun and Chi basins drain 15% of the entire Mekong basin, they only contribute 6% of the average annual flow. Sandy and saline soils are the most common soil types, which makes much of the land unsuitable for wet rice cultivation. In spite of poor fertility, however, agriculture is intensive. Glutinous rice, maize, and cassava are the principal crops. Drought is by far the major hydrological hazard in this region.
As the Mekong enters Cambodia, over 95% of its flows have already joined the river. From here on downstream the terrain is flat and water levels rather than flow volumes determine the movement of water across the landscape. The seasonal cycle of changing water levels at Phnom Penh results in the unique &quot;flow reversal&quot; of water into and out of the Great Lake via the Tonle Sap River. Phnom Penh also marks the beginning of the delta system of the Mekong River. Here the mainstream begins to break up into an increasing number of branches.

In Cambodia, wet rice is the main crop and is grown on the flood plains of the Tonle Sap, Mekong, and Bassac (the Mekong delta distributary known as the Hậu in Vietnam) Rivers. More than half of Cambodia remains covered with mixed evergreen and deciduous broadleaf forest, but forest cover has decreased from 73% in 1973 to 63% in 1993. Here, the river landscape is flat. Small changes in water level determine the direction of water movement, including the large-scale reversal of flow into and out of the Tonle Sap basin from the Mekong River.
The Mekong Delta in Vietnam is farmed intensively and has little natural vegetation left. Forest cover is less than 10%. In the Central Highlands of Vietnam, forest cover was reduced from over 95% in the 1950s to around 50% in the mid-1990s. Agricultural expansion and population pressure are the major reasons for land use and landscape change. Both drought and flood are common hazards in the Delta, which many people believe is the most sensitive to upstream hydrological change.

===Water flow along its course===
Table 1: Country share of Mekong River Basin (MRB) and water flows
By taking into account hydrological regimes, physiography land use, and existing, planned and potential resource developments, the Mekong is divided into six distinct reaches:
&quot;Reach 1: Lancang Jiang or Upper Mekong River in China&quot;. In this part of the river, the major source of water flowing into the river comes from melting snow on the Tibetan plateau. This volume of water is sometimes called the &quot;Yunnan component&quot; and plays an important role in the low-flow hydrology of the lower mainstream. Even as far downstream as Kratie, the Yunnan component makes up almost 30% of the average dry season flow. A major concern is that the ongoing and planned expansion of dams and reservoirs on the Mekong mainstream in Yunnan could have a significant effect on the low-flow regime of the lower Mekong basin system.

&quot;Reach 2: Chiang Saen to Vientiane and Nong Khai&quot;. This reach is almost entirely mountainous and covered with natural forest although there has been widespread slash and burn agriculture. Although this reach cannot be termed &quot;unspoiled&quot;, the hydrological response is perhaps the most natural and undisturbed of all the lower basin. Many hydrological aspects of the lower basin start to change rapidly at the downstream boundary of this reach.

On 19 July 2019 this reach of the river dropped to its lowest level in a century. Officials are particularly concerned as July is in the wet season, when mainstream flows are abundant historically. Locals are blaming low water on the newly constructed Xayaburi Dam, as it enters its test phase prior to the start of commercial operation in October 2019.

&quot;Reach 3: Vientiane and Nong Khai to Pakse&quot;. The boundary between Reach 2 and 3 is where the Mekong hydrology starts to change. Reach 2 is dominated in both wet and dry seasons by the Yunnan Component. Reach 3 is increasingly influenced by contributions from the large left bank tributaries in Laos, namely the Nam Ngum, Nam Theun, Nam Hinboun, Se Bang Fai, Se Bang Hieng and Se Done Rivers. The Mun-Chi river system from the right bank in Thailand enters the mainstream within this reach.

&quot;Reach 4: Pakse to Kratie&quot;. The main hydrological contributions to the mainstream in this reach come from the Se Kong, Se San, and Sre Pok catchments. Together, these rivers make up the largest hydrological sub-component of the lower basin. Over 25% of the mean annual flow volume to the mainstream at Kratie comes from these three river basins. They are the key element in the hydrology of this part of the system, especially to the Tonle Sap flow reversal.

&quot;Reach 5: Kratie to Phnom Penh&quot;. This reach includes the hydraulic complexities of the Cambodian floodplain, the Tonle Sap and the Great Lake. By this stage, over 95% of the total flow has entered the Mekong system. The focus turns from hydrology and water discharge to the assessment of water level, over- bank storage and flooding and the hydrodynamics that determine the timing, duration and volume of the seasonal flow reversal into and out of the Great Lake.

&quot;Reach 6: Phnom Penh to the South China Sea&quot;. Here the mainstream divides into a complex and increasingly controlled and artificial system of branches and canals. Key features of flow behaviour are tidal influences and salt water intrusion. Every year, 35–50% of this reach is flooded during the rainy season. The impact of road embankments and similar infrastructure developments on the movement of this flood water is an increasingly important consequence of development.

Table 2 summarises the mean annual flows along the mainstream. The mean annual flow entering the lower Mekong from China is equivalent to a relatively modest depth of runoff. Downstream of Vientiane this increases to over as the principal left bank tributaries enter the mainstream, mainly the Nam Ngum and Nam Theun. The flow level falls again, even with the right bank entry of the Mun-Chi system from Thailand. Although the Mun–Chi basin drains 20% of the lower system, average annual runoff is only . Runoff in the mainstream increases again with the entry from the left bank of the Se Kong from southern Laos and Se San and Sre Pok from Vietnam and Cambodia.


Table 2: Lower Mekong Mainstream annual flow (1960 to 2004) at selected sites.

Flows at Chiang Saen entering the lower basin from Yunnan make up about 15% of the wet season flow at Kratie. This rises to 40% during the dry season, even this far downstream. During the wet season, the proportion of average flow coming from Yunnan rapidly decreases downstream of Chiang Saen, from 70% to less than 20% at Kratie. The dry season contribution from Yunnan is much more significant. The major portion of the balance comes from Laos, which points to a major distinction in the low-flow hydrology of the river. One fraction comes from melting snow in China and Tibet and the rest from over-season catchment storage in the lower basin. This has implications for the occurrence of drought conditions. For example, if runoff from melting snow in any given year is very low, then flows upstream of Vientiane-Nong Khai would be lower.

In a large river system like the Mekong, seasonal flows can be quite variable from year to year. Although the pattern of the annual hydrograph is fairly predictable, its magnitude is not. The average monthly flows along the mainstream are listed in Table 3, providing an indication of their range and variability from year to year. At Pakse, for example, flood season flows during August would exceed nine years out of ten, but exceed only one year in ten.

Table 3: Mekong Mainstream monthly discharge, 1960–2004 (m3/s).
There is little evidence from the last 45 years of data of any systematic changes in the hydrological regime of the Mekong.

==Geology==
The internal drainage patterns of the Mekong are unusual among those of large rivers. Most large river systems that drain the interiors of continents, such as the Amazon, Congo, and Mississippi, have relatively simple tributary networks that resemble a branching tree.

Typically, such patterns develop in basins with gentle slopes where the underlying geological structure is fairly homogeneous and stable, exerting little or no control on river morphology. In marked contrast, the tributary networks of the Salween, Yangtze, and particularly the Mekong, are complex with different sub-basins often exhibiting different, and distinct, drainage patterns. These complex drainage systems have developed in a setting where the underlying geological structure is heterogeneous and active, and is the major factor controlling the course of rivers and the landscapes they carve out.

The elevation of the Tibetan Plateau during the Tertiary period was an important factor in the genesis of the south-west monsoon, which is the dominant climatic control influencing the hydrology of the Mekong Basin. Understanding the nature and timing of the elevation of Tibet (and the Central Highlands of Vietnam) therefore helps explain the provenance of sediment reaching the delta and the Tonle Sap Great Lake today. Studies of the provenance of sediments in the Mekong delta reveal a major switch in the source of sediments about eight million years ago (Ma). From 36 to 8 Ma the bulk (76%) of the sediments deposited in the delta came from erosion of the bedrock in the Three Rivers Area. From 8 Ma to the present, however, the contribution from the Three Rivers Area fell to 40%, while that from the Central Highlands rose from 11 to 51%. One of the most striking conclusions of provenance studies is the small contribution of sediment from the other parts of the Mekong basin, notably the Khorat Plateau, the uplands of northern Laos and northern Thailand, and the mountain ranges south of the Three Rivers area.

The last glacial period came to an abrupt end about 19,000 years ago (19 ka) when sea levels rose rapidly, reaching a maximum of about above present levels in the early Holocene about 8 ka. At this time the shoreline of the South China Sea almost reached Phnom Penh and cores recovered from near Angkor Borei contained sediments deposited under the influence of tides, and salt marsh and mangrove swamp deposits. Sediments deposited in the Tonle Sap Great Lake about this time (7.9–7.3 ka) also show indications of marine influence, suggesting a connection to the South China Sea. Although the hydraulic relationships between the Mekong and the Tonle Sap Great Lake systems during the Holocene are not well understood, it is clear that between 9,000 and 7,500 years ago the confluence of the Tonle Sap and the Mekong was in proximity to the South China Sea.

The present river morphology of the Mekong Delta developed over the last 6,000 years. During this period, the delta advanced over the continental shelf of the South China Sea, covering an area of more than . From 5.3 to 3.5 ka the delta advanced across a broad embayment formed between higher ground near the Cambodian border and uplands north of Ho Chi Minh City. During this phase of its development the delta was sheltered from the wave action of long-shore currents and was constructed largely through fluvial and tidal processes. At this time the delta was advancing at a rate of per year. After 3.5 ka, however, the delta had built out beyond the embayment and became subject to wave action and marine currents. These deflected deposition south-eastwards in the direction of the Cà Mau Peninsula, which is one of the most recent features of the delta.

For much of its length the Mekong flows through bedrock channels, i.e., channels that are confined or constrained by bedrock or old alluvium in the bed and riverbanks. Geomorphologic features normally associated with the alluvial stretches of mature rivers, such as meanders, oxbow lakes, cut-offs, and extensive floodplains are restricted to a short stretch of the mainstream around Vientiane and downstream of Kratie where the river develops alluvial channels that are free of control exerted by the underlying bedrock.

The Mekong basin is not normally considered a seismically active area as much of the basin is underlain by the relatively stable continental block. Nonetheless, the parts of the basin in northern Laos, northern Thailand, Myanmar and China do experience frequent earthquakes and tremors. The magnitude of these earthquakes rarely exceeds 6.5 on the Richter magnitude scale and is unlikely to cause material damage.

==History==
The difficulty of navigating the river has meant that it has divided, rather than united, the people who live near it. The earliest known settlements date to 210 BCE, with Ban Chiang being an excellent example of early Iron Age culture. The earliest recorded civilization was the 1st century Indianised-Khmer culture of Funan, in the Mekong delta. Excavations at Oc Eo, near modern An Giang, have found coins from as far away as the Roman Empire. This was succeeded by the Khmer culture Chenla state around the 5th century. The Khmer empire of Angkor was the last great Indianized state in the region. From around the time of the fall of the Khmer empire, the Mekong was the front line between the emergent states of Siam and Tonkin (North Vietnam), with Laos and Cambodia, then on the coast, torn between their influence.

The first European to encounter the Mekong was the Portuguese António de Faria in 1540. A European map of 1563 depicts the river, although even by then little was known of the river upstream of the delta. European interest was sporadic: the Spanish and Portuguese mounted some missionary and trade expeditions, while the Dutch Gerrit van Wuysthoff led an expedition up the river as far as Vientiane in 1641–42.

The French invaded the region in the mid-19th century, capturing Saigon in 1861, and establishing a protectorate over Cambodia in 1863.
The first systematic European exploration began with the French Mekong Expedition led by Ernest Doudard de Lagrée and Francis Garnier, which ascended the river from its mouth to Yunnan between 1866 and 1868. Their chief finding was that the Mekong had too many falls and rapids to ever be useful for navigation. The river&#x27;s source was found by Pyotr Kuzmich Kozlov in 1900.

From 1893, the French extended their control of the river into Laos, establishing French Indochina by the first decade of the 20th century. This lasted until the First and Second Indochina Wars expelled French from its former colony and defeated US-supported governments.

During the wars in Indochina in the 1970s, a significant quantity of explosives (sometimes, entire barges loaded with military ordnance) sank in the Cambodian section of the Mekong (as well as in the country&#x27;s other waterways). Besides being a danger for fishermen, unexploded ordnance also creates problems for bridge and irrigation systems construction. As of 2013, Cambodian volunteers are being trained, with the support of the Office of Weapons Removal and Abatement within the US State Department Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, to conduct underwater explosive removal.

The many maps of the river basin produced throughout recorded history reflect the region&#x27;s changing human geography and politics.

In 1995, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam established the Mekong River Commission (MRC) to manage and coordinate the use and care of the Mekong. In 1996 China and Myanmar became &quot;dialogue partners&quot; of the MRC and the six countries now work together in a cooperative framework. In 2000, the governments of China, Laos, Thailand and Myanmar signed a &quot;Agreement on Commercial Navigation on Lancang-Mekong River among the Governments of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the Lao People&#x27;s Democratic Republic, the Union of Myanmar and the Kingdom of Thailand&quot; which is the mechanism for cooperation with regard to riverine trade on the upper stretches of the Mekong.

==Natural history==
The Mekong basin is one of the richest areas of biodiversity in the world. Only the Amazon boasts a higher level of bio-diversity. Biota estimates for the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) include 20,000 plant species, 430 mammals, 1,200 birds, 800 reptiles and amphibians, and an estimated 850 freshwater fish species (excluding euryhaline species mainly found in salt or brackish water, as well as introduced species). The most species rich orders among the freshwater fish in the river basin are cypriniforms (377 species) and catfish (92 species).

New species are regularly described from the Mekong. In 2009, 145 species previously unknown to science were described from the region, including 29 fish species, 2 bird species, 10 reptiles, 5 mammals, 96 plants, and 6 amphibians. Between 1997 and 2015, an average of two new species per week were discovered in the region. The Mekong Region contains 16 WWF Global 200 ecoregions, the greatest concentration of ecoregions in mainland Asia.

No other river is home to so many species of very large fish. The biggest include three species of &quot;Probarbus&quot; barbs, which can grow up to and weigh , the giant freshwater stingray (&quot;Himantura polylepis&quot;, syn. &quot;H. chaophraya&quot;), which can reach at least in length and in width, the giant pangasius (&quot;Pangasius sanitwongsei&quot;), giant barb (&quot;Catlocarpio siamensis&quot;) and the endemic Mekong giant catfish (&quot;Pangasianodon gigas&quot;). The last three can grow up to about in length and weigh . All of these have declined drastically because of dams, flood control, and overfishing.

One species of freshwater dolphin, the Irrawaddy dolphin (&quot;Orcaella brevirostris&quot;), was once common in the whole of the lower Mekong but is now very rare, with only 85 individuals remaining.

Among other wetland mammals that have been living in and around the river are the smooth-coated otter (&quot;Lutra perspicillata&quot;) and fishing cat (&quot;Prionailurus viverrinus&quot;).

The endangered Siamese crocodile (&quot;Crocodylus siamensis&quot;) occurs in small isolated pockets within the northern Cambodian and Laotian portions of the Mekong River. The saltwater crocodile (&quot;Crocodylus porosus&quot;) once ranged from the Mekong Delta up the river into Tonle Sap and beyond but is now extinct in the river, along with being extinct in all of Vietnam and possibly even Cambodia.

===Protected areas===
*The headwaters of the Mekong in Zadoi County, Qinghai, China, are protected in Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve. The name Sanjiangyuan means &quot;the sources of the Three Rivers&quot;. The reserve also includes the headwaters of the Yellow River and the Yangtze.
*The section of the river flowing through deep gorges in Yunnan Province is part of the Three Parallel Rivers of Yunnan Protected Areas, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
*The Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve in Cambodia contains the largest lake in Southeast Asia. It is a UNESCO Biosphere reserve.
===Natural phenomena===
The low tide level of the river in Cambodia is lower than the high tide level out at sea, and the flow of the Mekong inverts with the tides throughout its stretch in Vietnam and up to Phnom Penh. The very flat Mekong delta area in Vietnam is thus prone to flooding, especially in the provinces of An Giang and Dong Thap (Đồng Tháp), near the Cambodian border.

==Fisheries==
Aquatic biodiversity in the Mekong River system is the second highest in the world after the Amazon.
The Mekong boasts the most concentrated biodiversity per hectare of any river. The largest recorded freshwater fish, a giant freshwater stingray in 2022 and previously a Mekong giant catfish in 2005, were both caught in the Mekong River.

The commercially valuable fish species in the Mekong are generally divided between &quot;black fish&quot;, which inhabit low oxygen, slow moving, shallow waters, and &quot;white fish&quot;, which inhabit well oxygenated, fast moving, deeper waters. People living within the Mekong River system generate many other sources of food and income from what are often termed &quot;other aquatic animals&quot; (OAAs) such as freshwater crabs, shrimp, snakes, turtles, and frogs.

OAAs account for about 20% of the total Mekong catch. When fisheries are discussed, catches are typically divided between the wild capture fishery (i.e., fish and other aquatic animals caught in their natural habitat), and aquaculture (fish reared under controlled conditions). Wild capture fisheries play the most important role in supporting livelihoods. Wild capture fisheries are largely open access fisheries, which poor rural people can access for food and income.

Broadly, there are three types of fish habitats in the Mekong: i) the river, including all the main tributaries, rivers in the major flood zone, and the Tonle Sap, which altogether yield about 30% of wild catch landings; ii) rain-fed wetlands outside the river-floodplain zone, including mainly rice paddies in formerly forested areas and usually inundated to about , yielding about 66% of wild catch landings; and iii) large water bodies outside the flood zone, including canals and reservoirs yielding about 4% of wild catch landings.

The Mekong Basin has one of the world&#x27;s largest and most productive inland fisheries. An estimated two million tonnes of fish are landed a year, in addition to almost 500,000 tonnes of other aquatic animals. Aquaculture yields about two million tonnes of fish a year. Hence, the lower Mekong basin yields about 4.5 million tonnes of fish and aquatic products annually. The total economic value of the fishery is between US$3.9 and US$7 billion a year. Wild capture fisheries alone have been valued at US$2 billion a year. This value increases considerably when the multiplier effect is included, but estimates vary widely.

An estimated 2.56 million tonnes of inland fish and other aquatic animals are consumed in the lower Mekong every year. Aquatic resources make up between 47 and 80% of animal protein in rural diets for people who live in the Lower Mekong Basin. Fish are the cheapest source of animal protein in the region and any decline in the fishery is likely to significantly impact nutrition, especially among the poor. Fish are the staple of the diet in Laos and Cambodia, with around 80% of the Cambodian population&#x27;s annual protein intake coming from fish caught in the Mekong River system, with no alternative source to replace it. An MRC report claims that dam projects on the Mekong River will reduce aquatic life by 40% by 2020, and predicted that 80% of fish will be depleted by 2040. Thailand will be impacted, as its fish stocks in the Mekong will decline by 55%, Laos will be reduced by 50%, Cambodia by 35%, and Vietnam by 30%.

It is estimated that 40 million rural people, more than two-thirds of the rural population in the lower Mekong basin, are engaged in the wild capture fishery. Fisheries contribute significantly to a diversified livelihood strategy for many people, particularly the poor, who are highly dependent on the river and its resources for their livelihoods. They provide a principal form of income for numerous people and act as a safety net and coping strategy in times of poor agricultural harvests or other difficulties. In Laos alone, 71% of rural households (2.9 million people) rely on fisheries for either subsistence or additional cash income. Around the Tonle Sap Lake in Cambodia, more than 1.2 million people live in fishing communes and depend almost entirely on fishing for their livelihoods.

==Dams==
Dams in the Mekong reference those built for hydropower, irrigation and other uses (such as water supply). As of February 2024, dams in the Mekong are distributed as follows:

Table 4: Dams in the Mekong River Basin

Notes: HPPs = Hydropower Plants. Data calculated from the CGIAR Research Program on Water, Land and Ecosystems - Greater Mekong &#x27;Dataset on the Dams of the Irrawaddy, Mekong, Red and Salween River Basins&#x27;. Only HPPs with an installed capacity of 15 Megawatts (MW) or more are included; and/or dams with a reservoir area of 0.5 km2 or more. 

There are also multiple HPPs under construction within the basin. As of February 2024, there is one under construction in Cambodia, three in the TAR, and 14 in Laos.

Of the Mekong&#x27;s HPPs, 15 are located on the Mekong mainstream. Of these, 13 are in China, and two in Laos. An additional mainstream dam is currently under construction in Laos, and another in China.

==Navigation==

For thousands of years the Mekong River has been an important conduit for people and goods between the many towns on its banks. Traditional forms of trade in small boats linking communities continue today, however the river is also becoming an important link in international trade routes, connecting the six Mekong countries to each other, and also to the rest of the world. The Mekong is still a wild river and navigation conditions vary greatly along its length. Broadly, navigation of the river is divided between upper and lower Mekong, with the &quot;upper&quot; part of the river defined as the stretch north of the Khone Falls in southern Laos and the &quot;lower&quot; part as the stretch below these falls.

Narrower and more turbulent sections of water in the upstream parts of the Mekong River, coupled with large annual water level variations continue to present a challenge to navigation. The seasonal variations in water level directly affect trade in this section of the river. Volumes of trade being shipped decrease by more than 50%, primarily due to the reduced draughts available during the low water season (June–January). Despite these difficulties, the Mekong River is already an important link in the transit chain between Kunming and Bangkok with about 300,000 tonnes of goods shipped via this route each year. The volume of this trade is expected to increase by 8–11% per year. Port infrastructure is being expanded to accommodate the expected growth in traffic, with new facilities planned for Chiang Saen port.

In Laos, 50 and 100 DWT vessels are operated for regional trade. Cargos carried are timber, agricultural products, and construction materials. Thailand imports a wide variety of products from China, including vegetables, fruit, agricultural products, and fertilisers. The main exports from Thailand are dried longan, fish oil, rubber products, and consumables. Nearly all the ships carrying cargo to and from Chiang Saen Port are 300 DWT Chinese flag vessels.

Waterborne trade in the lower Mekong countries of Vietnam and Cambodia has grown significantly, with trends in container traffic at Phnom Penh port and general cargo through Can Tho port both showing steady increases until 2009 when a decrease in cargo volumes can be attributed to the global financial crisis and a subsequent decline in demand for the export of garments to the US. In 2009, Mekong trade received a significant boost with the opening of a new deep-water port at Cai Mep in Vietnam. This new port has generated a renewed focus on the Mekong River as a trade route. The Cai Mep container terminals can accommodate vessels with a draught of , equivalent to the largest container ships in the world. These mother vessels sail directly to Europe or the United States, which means that goods can be shipped internationally to and from Phnom Penh with only a single transshipment at Cai Mep.

As an international river, a number of agreements exist between the countries that share the Mekong to enable trade and passage between them. The most important of these, which address the full length of the river, are:
*Agreement between China and Lao PDR on Freight and Passenger Transport along the Lancang–Mekong River, adopted in November 1994.
*Agreement on the Cooperation for the Sustainable Development of the Mekong River Basin, Article 9, Freedom of Navigation, 5 April 1995, Chiang Rai.
*Hanoi Agreement between Cambodia and Viet Nam on Waterway Transportation, 13 December 1998.
*Agreement between and among the Governments of the Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam for Facilitation of Cross border Transport of Goods and People, (amended at Yangon, Myanmar), signed in Vientiane, 26 November 1999.
*Agreement on Commercial Navigation on Lancang–Mekong River among the governments of China, Laos, Myanmar and Thailand, adopted at Tachileik, 20 April 2000.
*Phnom Penh Agreement between Cambodia and Vietnam on the Transit of Goods, 7 September 2000.
*New Agreement on Waterway Transportation between Vietnam and Cambodia, signed in Phnom Penh, 17 December 2009.

In December 2016, the Thai cabinet of Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha agreed &quot;in principle&quot; to a plan to dredge stretches of the Mekong and demolish rocky outcrops that are hindrances to easy navigation. The international Lancang-Mekong River navigation improvement plan for 2015–2025, conceived by China, Myanmar, Lao, and Thailand, aims to make the river more navigable for 500-tonne cargo vessels sailing the river from Yunnan to Luang Prabang, a distance of . China has been the driving force behind the demolition plan as it aims to expand trade in the area. The plan is split into two phases. The first phase, from 2015 to 2020, involves a survey, a design, and an assessment of the environmental and social impacts of the project. These have to be approved by the four countries involved: China, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand. The second phase (2020–2025) involves navigational improvements from Simao in China to 243 border posts in China and Myanmar, a distance of . Local groups have countered that native inhabitants already operate their boats year-round and that the plan to blast the rapids is not about making life better for local people, but about enabling year-round traffic of large Chinese commercial boats.

On 4 February 2020, the Thai Cabinet voted to stop the project to blast and dredge of the river bed after Beijing failed to stump up the money for further surveys of the affected area.

==Bridges==
Construction of Myanmar–Laos Friendship Bridge started on 19 February 2013. The bridge will be long and have an wide two-lane motorway.

The Thai–Lao Friendship Bridge (, ) connects Nong Khai city with Vientiane in Laos. The bridge opened on 8 April 1994. It has two lanes with a single railway line in the middle. On 20 March 2004, the Thai and Lao governments agreed to extend the railway to Tha Nalaeng in Laos. This extension has since been completed.

The Second Thai–Lao Friendship Bridge connects Mukdahan to Savannakhet. The two-lane, , bridge opened to the public on 9 January 2007.

The Third Thai–Lao Friendship Bridge opened for traffic on 11 November 2011, connecting Nakhon Phanom Province (Thailand) and Thakhek (Laos), as part of Asian Highway 3. The Chinese and Thai governments agreed to build the bridge and share the estimated US$33 million cost.

The Fourth Thai–Lao Friendship Bridge opened to traffic on 11 December 2013. It links Chiang Rai Province, Thailand with Ban Houayxay, Laos.

There is one bridge over the Mekong entirely within Laos. Unlike the Friendship Bridges, it is not a border crossing. It is at Pakse in Champasak Province. It is long, and was completed in 2000. ).

The Kizuna Bridge is in Cambodia, in the city of Kampong Cham, on the road linking Phnom Penh with the remote provinces of Ratanakiri and Mondolkiri, and Laos. The bridge opened for traffic on 11 December 2001.

The Prek Tamak Bridge, north of Phnom Penh opened in 2010.

Phnom Penh itself has no bridge under construction yet, although two new bridges have recently opened on the Tonle Sap, and the main bridge on the highway to Ho Chi Minh was duplicated in 2010.

Another new bridge was built at Neak Leung on the Phnom Penh to Ho Chi Minh Highway 1 with Japanese government assistance, and opened in 2015.

In Vietnam, the Mỹ Thuận Bridge was opened in 2000, crossing the first channel—the left, main branch of the Mekong, the Sông Tiền or Tiền Giang—near Vĩnh Long. Since 2008, the Rạch Miễu Bridge crosses it near Mỹ Tho, between the provinces of Tiền Giang and Bến Tre.

Cần Thơ Bridge crosses the second channel—the right, main distributary of the Mekong, the Bassac (Song Hau). Inaugurated in 2010, it is the longest main span cable-stayed bridge in Southeast Asia.

==Environmental issues==
Drought linked to a changing climate and dozens of hydroelectric dams are damaging the Mekong ecosystem. When drought ends and the inevitable floods begin, the effects of Mekong dams on flood pulse dynamics over the entire Lower Mekong are poorly understood.

Sewage treatment is rudimentary in towns and urban areas throughout much of the Mekong&#x27;s length, such as Vientiane in Laos. Water pollution impacts the river&#x27;s ecological integrity as a result.

Much of the 8.3 billion tonnes of plastic present on earth makes its way to the oceans. Ninety percent of plastic in the oceans is flushed there by just 10 rivers. The Mekong is one of them.

A growing number of academics, NGOs, and scientists have urged the international community and the Mekong River Commission to reduce the use of hydropower, giving concerns of long-term sustainability. Some of them have urged an immediate moratorium on new construction of hydropower projects and a shift to solar and other forms of renewable energy, which are becoming more competitive and faster to install.

Sand mining of the Mekong River in the countries Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam has led to various environmental impacts on both areas local and downstream to these operations due to the disturbance of the rivers river&#x27;s natural flow. These impacts include river embankment instability, reduced supply of vital floodwater and sediments to floodplains, increased salinity levels and both the disturbance and displacement of various species.

<text>In the New Testament, Tertullus (a modification of &quot;Tertius&quot;) was an orator or lawyer who was employed by the Jewish leaders to state their case against the apostle Paul in the presence of Felix (Acts 24:1-9).

==New Testament account==
Tertullus gives a formal rhetorical presentation on behalf of the Jewish leaders opposed to Paul&#x27;s preaching. The charges he raised against Paul were that he created disturbances &quot;among all the Jews throughout the world&quot;, an offence against the Roman government (&quot;crimen majestatis&quot;), secondly, that he was a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes; and thirdly, that he attempted to profane the temple, a crime which the Jews were permitted to punish.

It is generally assumed that Tertullus was himself a Hellenistic Jew, although he could have been a Gentile. It is not certain whether the trial would have taken place in Latin or Greek.

Tertullus before Antonius Felix makes the first recorded use of the plural &quot;Nazarenes&quot; (&quot;Nazoraioi&quot;, the plural form of Iesous ho &quot;Nazoraios&quot; &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot;) to refer to Christians, although the use of the term &quot;Christians&quot; at Antioch had already been noted in Acts, and it was used by Herod Agrippa II in the next trial of Paul before Porcius Festus. Tertullus&#x27; use of the Greek term &quot;Nazoraioi&quot; has continuity with the Hebrew term &quot;Notzrim&quot; found in later rabbinical literature. Tertullus presumably could not use the Antioch term &quot;Christianoi&quot; (Hebrew &quot;Meshiykhiyyim&quot; משיחיים) since &quot;Christianoi&quot; from Greek &quot;Christos&quot; (literally &quot;Anointed One&quot;, &quot;Messiah&quot;) might imply Tertullus&#x27; recognition of Jesus of Nazareth as a Davidic &quot;Anointed One&quot; or &quot;Messiah&quot;.

<text>The MMR vaccine is a vaccine against measles, mumps, and rubella (German measles), abbreviated as &quot;MMR&quot;. The first dose is generally given to children around 9 months to 15 months of age, with a second dose at 15 months to 6 years of age, with at least four weeks between the doses. After two doses, 97% of people are protected against measles, 88% against mumps, and at least 97% against rubella. The vaccine is also recommended for those who do not have evidence of immunity, those with well-controlled HIV/AIDS, and within 72 hours of exposure to measles among those who are incompletely immunized. It is given by injection.
The MMR vaccine is widely used around the world. Worldwide over 500 million doses were administered between 1999 and 2004, and 575 million doses have been administered since the vaccine&#x27;s introduction worldwide. Measles resulted in 2.6 million deaths per year before immunization became common. This has decreased to 122,000 deaths per year mostly in low-income countries. Through vaccination, , rates of measles in North and South America are very low. Rates of disease have been seen to increase in populations that go unvaccinated. Between 2000 and 2018, vaccination decreased measles deaths by 73%.
Side effects of immunization are generally mild and resolve without any specific treatment. These may include fever, as well as pain or redness at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occur in about one in a million people. Because it contains live viruses, the MMR vaccine is not recommended during pregnancy but may be given during breastfeeding. The vaccine is safe to give at the same time as other vaccines. Being recently immunized does not increase the risk of passing measles, mumps, or rubella on to others. There is no evidence of an association between MMR immunisation and autistic spectrum disorders. The MMR vaccine is a mixture of live weakened viruses of the three diseases.
The MMR vaccine was developed by Maurice Hilleman. It was licensed for use in the US by Merck in 1971. Stand-alone measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines had been previously licensed in 1963, 1967, and 1969, respectively. Recommendations for a second dose were introduced in 1989. The MMRV vaccine, which also covers chickenpox, may be used instead. An MR vaccine, without coverage for mumps, is also occasionally used.

==Medical use==

Cochrane concluded that the &quot;Existing evidence on the safety and effectiveness of MMR and MMRV vaccine supports current policies of mass immunisation aimed at global measles eradication to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with measles mumps rubella and varicella.&quot;

The combined MMR vaccine induces immunity less painfully than three separate injections at the same time, and sooner and more efficiently than three injections given on different dates. Public Health England reports that providing a single combined vaccine as of 1988, rather than giving the option to have them also done separately, increased uptake of the vaccine.

===Measles===

Before the widespread use of a vaccine against measles, rates of disease were so high that infection was felt to be &quot;as inevitable as death and taxes.&quot; Reported cases of measles in the United States fell from hundreds of thousands to tens of thousands per year following introduction of the vaccine in 1963. Increasing uptake of the vaccine following outbreaks in 1971, and 1977, brought this down to thousands of cases per year in the 1980s. An outbreak of almost 30,000 cases in 1990 led to a renewed push for vaccination and the addition of a second vaccine to the recommended schedule. Fewer than 200 cases have been reported in the US each year between 1997 and 2013, and the disease is no longer considered endemic there.

The benefit of measles vaccination in preventing illness, disability, and death has been well documented. The first 20 years of licensed measles vaccination in the US prevented an estimated 52 million cases of the disease, 17,400 cases of intellectual disability, and 5,200 deaths. During 1999–2004, a strategy led by the World Health Organization and UNICEF led to improvements in measles vaccination coverage that averted an estimated 1.4 million measles deaths worldwide. Between 2000 and 2018, measles vaccination resulted in a 73% decrease in deaths from the disease.

Measles is common in many areas of the world. Although it was declared eliminated from the US in 2000, high rates of vaccination and good communication with people who refuse vaccination are needed to prevent outbreaks and sustain the elimination of measles in the US. Of the 66 cases of measles reported in the US in 2005, slightly over half were attributable to one unvaccinated individual who acquired measles during a visit to Romania. This individual returned to a community with many unvaccinated children. The resulting outbreak infected 34 people, mostly children and virtually all unvaccinated; 9% were hospitalized, and the cost of containing the outbreak was estimated at $167,685. A major epidemic was averted due to high rates of vaccination in the surrounding communities.

In 2017, an outbreak of measles occurred among the Somali-American community in Minnesota, where MMR vaccination rates had declined due to the misconception that the vaccine could cause autism. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recorded 65 affected children in the outbreak by April 2017.

===Rubella===

Rubella, also known as German measles, was also very common before widespread vaccination. The major risk of rubella is during pregnancy when the baby may contract congenital rubella, which can cause significant congenital defects.

===Mumps===
Mumps is another viral disease that was once very common, especially during childhood. If mumps is acquired by a male who is past puberty, a possible complication is bilateral orchitis, which can in some cases lead to sterility.

===Administration===
The MMR vaccine is administered by a subcutaneous injection, the first dose typically at twelve months of age. The second dose may be given as early as one month after the first dose. The second dose is a dose to produce immunity in the small number of persons (2–5%) who fail to develop measles immunity after the first dose. In the US it is done before entry to kindergarten because that is a convenient time. Areas where measles is common typically recommend the first dose at nine months of age and the second dose at fifteen months of age.

==Safety==

Adverse reactions, rarely serious, may occur from each component of the MMR vaccine. Ten percent of children develop fever, malaise, and a rash 5–21 days after the first vaccination; and 3% develop joint pain lasting 18 days on average. Older women appear to be more at risk of joint pain, acute arthritis, and even (rarely) chronic arthritis. Anaphylaxis is an extremely rare but serious allergic reaction to the vaccine. One cause can be egg allergy. In 2014, the FDA approved two additional possible adverse events on the vaccination label: acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), and transverse myelitis, with permission to also add &quot;difficulty walking&quot; to the package inserts. A 2012 IOM report found that the measles component of the MMR vaccine can cause measles inclusion body encephalitis in immunocompromised individuals. This report also rejected any connection between the MMR vaccine and autism. Some versions of the vaccine contain the antibiotic neomycin and therefore should not be used in people allergic to this antibiotic.

The number of reports on neurological disorders is very small, other than evidence for an association between a form of the MMR vaccine containing the Urabe mumps strain and rare adverse events of aseptic meningitis, a form of viral meningitis. The UK National Health Service stopped using the Urabe mumps strain in the early 1990s due to cases of transient mild viral meningitis, and switched to a form using the Jeryl Lynn mumps strain instead. The Urabe strain remains in use in a number of countries; MMR with the Urabe strain is much cheaper to manufacture than with the Jeryl Lynn strain, and a strain with higher efficacy along with a somewhat higher rate of mild side effects may still have the advantage of reduced incidence of overall adverse events.

A Cochrane review found that, compared with placebo, MMR vaccine was associated with fewer upper respiratory tract infections, more irritability, and a similar number of other adverse effects.

Naturally acquired measles often occurs with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP, a purpuric rash and an increased tendency to bleed that resolves within two months in children), occurring in 1 to 20,000 cases. Approximately 1 in 40,000 children are thought to acquire ITP in the six weeks following an MMR vaccination. ITP below the age of six years is generally a mild disease, rarely having long-term consequences.

===False claims about autism===
In 1998 Andrew Wakefield &quot;et al.&quot; published a fraudulent paper about twelve children, reportedly with bowel symptoms and autism or other disorders acquired soon after administration of MMR vaccine, while supporting a competing vaccine. In 2010, Wakefield&#x27;s research was found by the General Medical Council to have been &quot;dishonest&quot;, and &quot;The Lancet&quot; fully retracted the paper. Three months following &quot;The Lancet&#x27;s&quot; retraction, Wakefield was struck off the UK medical register, with a statement identifying deliberate falsification in the research published in &quot;The Lancet&quot;, and was barred from practising medicine in the UK. The research was declared fraudulent in 2011 by the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot;.

Since Wakefield&#x27;s publication, multiple peer-reviewed studies have failed to show any association between the vaccine and autism. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Institute of Medicine of the US National Academy of Sciences, the UK National Health Service and the Cochrane Library review have all concluded that there is no evidence of a link.

Administering the vaccines in three separate doses does not reduce the chance of adverse effects, and it increases the opportunity for infection by the two diseases not immunized against first. Health experts have criticized media reporting of the MMR-autism controversy for triggering a decline in vaccination rates. Before publication of Wakefield&#x27;s article, the inoculation rate for MMR in the UK was 92%; after publication, the rate dropped to below 80%. In 1998, there were 56 measles cases in the UK; by 2008, there were 1348 cases, with two confirmed deaths.

In Japan, the MMR triplet is not used. Immunity is achieved by a combination vaccine for measles and rubella, followed up later with a mumps only vaccine. This has had no effect on autism rates in the country, further disproving the MMR autism hypothesis.

==History==
The component viral strains of MMR vaccine were developed by propagation in animal and human cells.

For example, in the case of mumps and measles viruses, the virus strains were grown in embryonated chicken eggs. This produced strains of virus which were adapted for chicken cells and less well-suited for human cells. These strains are therefore called &quot;attenuated strains&quot;. They are sometimes referred to as &quot;neuroattenuated&quot; because these strains are less virulent to human neurons than the wild strains.

The rubella component, Meruvax, was developed in 1967, through propagation using the human embryonic lung cell line WI-38 (named for the Wistar Institute) that was derived six years earlier in 1961.
The term &quot;MPR vaccine&quot; is also used to refer to this vaccine, whereas &quot;P&quot; refers to parotitis which is caused by mumps.

Merck MMR II is supplied freeze-dried (lyophilized) and contains live viruses. Before injection, it is reconstituted with the solvent provided.

According to a review published in 2018, the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) MMR vaccine known as Pluserix &quot;contains the Schwarz measles virus, the Jeryl Lynn–like mumps strain, and RA27/3 rubella virus&quot;.

Pluserix was introduced in Hungary in 1999. Enders&#x27; Edmonston strain has been used since 1999 in Hungary in Merck MMR II product. GSK Priorix vaccine, which uses attenuated Schwarz Measles, was introduced in Hungary in 2003.

==MMRV vaccine==
The MMRV vaccine, a combined measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (chickenpox) vaccine, has been proposed as a replacement for the MMR vaccine to simplify the administration of the vaccines. Preliminary data indicate a rate of febrile seizures of 9 per 10,000 vaccinations with MMRV, as opposed to 4 per 10,000 for separate MMR and varicella shots; US health officials therefore, do not express a preference for use of MMRV vaccine over separate injections.

In a 2012 study pediatricians and family doctors were sent a survey to gauge their awareness of the increased risk of febrile seizures (fever fits) in the MMRV. 74% of family doctors and 29% of pediatricians were unaware of the increased risk of febrile seizures. After reading an informational statement only 7% of family doctors and 20% of pediatricians would recommend the MMRV for a healthy 12- to 15-month-old child. The factor that was reported as the &quot;most important&quot; deciding factor in recommending the MMRV over the MMR+V was ACIP/AAFP/AAP recommendations (pediatricians, 77%; family physicians, 73%).

==MR vaccine==
This is a vaccine that covers measles and rubella but not mumps. As of 2014, it was used in a &quot;few (unidentified) countries&quot;.

== Society and culture ==
=== Religious concerns ===
Some brands of the vaccine use gelatin, derived from pigs, as a stabilizer. This has caused reduced take-up among some communities, despite the fact that alternative vaccines without pig derivatives are approved and available.

<text>Terah or Terach ( &quot;Teraḥ&quot;) is a biblical figure in the Book of Genesis. He is listed as the son of Nahor and father of the patriarch Abraham. As such, he is a descendant of Shem&#x27;s son Arpachshad. Terah is mentioned in Genesis 11:26–27, Book of Joshua 24:2, and 1 Chronicles 1:17–27 of the Hebrew Bible and Luke 3:34–36 in the New Testament.

==Biblical narrative==
Terah is mentioned in Genesis 11:26–27, Joshua 24:2, and 1 Chronicles 1:17–27 of the Hebrew Bible and Luke 3:34–36 in the New Testament. Terah is mentioned in Genesis 11:26–32 as a son of Nahor, the son of Serug, descendants of Shem. He is said to have had three sons: Abram (better known by his later name Abraham), Haran, and Nahor II, and one daughter: Sarai (better known by her later name Sarah). The family lived in Ur of the Chaldees. His grandchildren were Lot, Milcah and Iscah, whose father, Haran, had died at Ur.

In the Book of Joshua, in his final speech to the Israelite leaders assembled at Shechem, Joshua recounts the history of God&#x27;s formation of the Israelite nation, beginning with &quot;Terah the father of Abraham and Nahor, who lived beyond the Euphrates River and worshiped other gods.&quot; Terah is also mentioned in a biblical genealogy given in 1 Chronicles.

In the Genesis narrative, Terah took his family and left Ur to move to the land of Canaan. Terah set out for Canaan but stopped in the city of Haran along the way, where he died.

==Jewish tradition==
===Children===
Genesis 11:26 states that Terah lived 70 years, &quot;and begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran&quot;. The Talmud says that Abraham was 52 years old at year 2000 AM (Anno Mundi), which means that he was born in the year 1948 AM.

===Occupation===

According to rabbinic literature Terah was a wicked (&quot;Numbers Rabbah&quot; 19:1; 19:33), idolatrous priest (Midrash HaGadol on Genesis 11:28) who manufactured idols (&quot;Eliyahu Rabbah&quot; 6, and &quot;Eliyahu Zuta&quot; 25). Abram, in opposition to his father&#x27;s idol shop, smashed his father&#x27;s idols and chased customers away. Terah then brought his unruly son before Nimrod, who threw him into a fiery furnace, yet Abram miraculously escaped (Genesis Rabbah 38:13). The Zohar says that when God saved Abram from the furnace, Terah repented (Zohar Genesis 1:77b) and Rabbi Abba B. Kahana said that God assured Abram that his father Terah had a portion in the &quot;World to Come&quot; (Genesis Rabbah 30:4; 30:12).

Rabbi Hiyya relates this account in the Genesis Rabbah: 
===Leader of the journey===
Terah is identified as the person who arranged and led the family to embark on a mysterious journey to Canaan. It is shrouded in mystery to Jewish scholars as to why Terah began the journey and as to why the journey ended prematurely. It is suggested that he was a man in search of a greater truth that could possibly be found in the land of Canaan, and that it was Abram who picked up the torch to continue his father&#x27;s quest, that Terah himself was unable to achieve.

===When Abram leaves Haran===
In Jewish tradition, when Terah died at age 205, Abraham (70 years younger) was already 135 years old. Abram thus left Haran at age 75, well before Terah died. The Torah, however, relates Terah&#x27;s death in Haran before Abram continues the journey to Canaan as an expression that he was not remiss in the Mitzvah of honoring a parent by leaving his aging father behind. The significance of Terah not reaching Canaan was a reflection of his character, a man who was unable to go &quot;all the way&quot;. Although on a journey in the right direction, Terah fell short at arriving to the divine destination—in contrast to Abram, who did follow through and achieved the divine goal, and was not bound by his father&#x27;s idolatrous past. Abram&#x27;s following God&#x27;s command to leave his father, thus absolved him from the mitzvah of honoring parents, and as Abraham, he would go on to create a new lineage distinct from his ancestors.

==Samaritan tradition==
In the Samaritan Pentateuch Terah dies aged 145 years and Abram leaves Haran after his death.

==Christian tradition==
In the Christian tradition Abram left Haran after Terah died. The Christian views of the time of Terah come from a passage in the New Testament at Acts 7:2–4 where Stephen said some things that contrast with Jewish rabbinical views. He said that God appeared to Abraham in Mesopotamia, and directed him to leave the Chaldeans—whereas most rabbinical commentators see Terah as being the one who directed the family to leave Ur Kasdim from Genesis 11:31: &quot;Terah took his son Abram, his daughter-in-law Sarai (his son Abram&#x27;s wife), and his grandson Lot (his son Haran&#x27;s child) and left Ur of the Chaldeans to go to the land of Canaan.&quot; Stephen asserts that Abram left Haran after Terah died.

==Islamic tradition==
=== In Sunni Islam ===
Some Sunni scholars are of the opinion that Azar (mentioned in the Qur&#x27;an) is not the father of Ibrahim. For some, the actual name of the father of Ibrahim is Tarakh, thus cannot be Azar. Ibn Hajar&#x27;s position is that in fact Azar is the paternal uncle of Ibrahim and that Arabs use the term &quot;ab&quot; to refer to the paternal uncle also and that Allah used this expression in the Qur&#x27;an where Isma&#x27;il, the paternal uncle of Ya&#x27;qub, is referred to as an &quot;ab&quot;.

Some commentators said: Terah&#x27;s, had two names: Azar and Terah, as Al-Tabari narrated in Jami’ al-Bayan (11/466) with his chain of transmission on the authority of Saeed bin Abdul Aziz. He said: He is Azar, and he is Terah, such as “Israel” and “Jacob”.

It is also maintained by some that Azar&#x27;s real name was Nakhoor, and that though Azar earlier worshipped Allah, he abandoned his forefathers&#x27; religion when he became the minister of Namrud.

===In Shi&#x27;ism===
====Terah as Abraham&#x27;s father====
There is a consensus among Shia Muslim scholars and exegetes that Azar was not the biological father of Abraham but rather his paternal uncle while Terah is believed to be his father. Shaykh Tusi maintained that Azar was not Abraham&#x27;s father and cited a hadith from Muhammad according to which none of the prophet&#x27;s ancestors up to Adam were polytheists. By this he argued that since Azar was an idolater and Abraham was one of the prophet&#x27;s ancestors, it is not possible for Azar to be Abraham&#x27;s father. According to Grand Ayatollah Naser Makarem Shirazi in Tafsir Nemooneh, all Shiite exegetes and scholars believe that Azar was not Abraham&#x27;s father. Allamah Tabatabai in his Tafsir al-Mizan appealed to the Quranic verses in which Abraham prayed for his parents, that they show that his father was someone other than Azar. In Dua Umm Dawood, a supplication recited by Shi&#x27;ite Muslims cited to be from Imam Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq, the supplicant sends blessings on a person by the name of &#x27;Turakh&#x27;. In &quot;Nahj al-Balagha&quot;, Imam Ali is reported to have said in a sermon, &quot;I testify that Muhammad is His servant and messenger, and the chief of His creation; whenever Allah divided the line of descent, He put him in the better one..&quot; Likewise, in &quot;Ziyarat Arbaeen&quot;, a recitation with which Shiite Muslims pay respect to Imam Husayn, it is recited &quot;I bear witness that you were a light in the sublime loins and purified wombs..&quot;, through which it is believed that none of his ancestors up to Adam were impure, which includes Muhammad, Imam Ali and Lady Fatimah and hence including Abraham&#x27;s biological father.

The Twelver Shi&#x27;ite website &quot;Al-Islam.org&quot; treats Azar as being Abraham&#x27;s uncle, not his biological father. To justify this view, it references a passage of the Quran, which mentions that the sons of Yaʿqūb (Jacob) referred to his uncle Ismāʿīl (Ishmael), father Is-ḥāq (Isaac) and grandfather Ibrāhīm (Abraham) as his &quot;ābāʾ&quot; ():

Therefore, the singular word &quot;ab&quot; does not always mean progenitor, and can be used for an uncle or caretaker or a forefather, unlike the word &quot;wālid&quot; (, progenitor). Thus, &quot;Al-Islam.org&quot; denies that Abraham&#x27;s biological father was &#x27;Azar&#x27;, and instead agreed with Ibn Kathir that he was the biblical figure &#x27;Terah&#x27;, who nevertheless treated him as a polytheist.

====As Abraham&#x27;s uncle====
In contrast to &quot;Al-Islam.org&quot;, Shi&#x27;ite scholar and jurist Mohammad Taqi al-Modarresi believed Terah to be the uncle of Abraham, not his father.

== In popular culture ==
Terah is portrayed by Vittorio Gassman in the film &quot;Abraham&quot; (1993).

<doc id="69151" wikidata="Q1813990" url="?curid=69151" title="List of rivers of the Americas">
<text>This is a list of [[river]]s of the Americas, it includes major historical or physiological significant rivers of the Americas grouped by region where they are located (Central America, Northern America, West Indies and South Americas). The longest rivers in each country are included. Further details and references are provided in each river&#x27;s separate article. Unusually significant tributaries appear in this list, under the river into which they drain.

The longest river in the Americas is the Amazon River. The length of the Amazon River is usually said to be &quot;at least&quot; , but reported values lie anywhere between .
The length measurements of many rivers are only approximations and differ from each other because there are many factors that determine the calculated river length, such as the position of the geographical source and the mouth, the scale of measurement, and the length measuring techniques (for details see also List of rivers by length).

There are 11 countries in the Americas that do not have rivers: Anguilla, Aruba, Bermuda, Bonaire, Cayman Islands, Curaçao, Saba, Saint Barthélemy, Saint Martin, Sint Eustatius, and Sint Maarten.

==North America==
===Central America===

The water in rivers in Central America flows to either the Atlantic Ocean or Pacific Ocean. The Río Coco, locally known as the Wanks, runs along the border with Honduras and is the longest river flowing totally within Central America. The second longest river in Central America is the Patuca River.

Some of the significant rivers and their lengths in Central America include:

===Northern America===


Water from rivers in the Northern Americas flows toward either the Arctic Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean, the land-locked Great Basin in the western United States or the interior basin in Mexico.

The Missouri River is the longest river in North America and the United States (). The second longest river in North America and the United States is the Mississippi River (). The Rio Conchos () is the longest river in Mexico. The longest river in Canada is the Mackenzie River ().

Some of the longest or otherwise notable rivers include the rivers listed in the table below.

<text>Moskvitch or Moskvich () (also written as &quot;Moskvich&quot;, &quot;Moskvič&quot;, or &quot;Moskwitsch&quot;) is a Soviet/Russian automobile brand produced by AZLK from 1946 to 1991 and by OAO Moskvitch from 1991 to 2001. Production later resumed in 2022. The current article incorporates information about both the brand and the joint-stock successor of AZLK.

OAO Moskvitch is the name of a privatized venture given to the former factory to avoid legal issues after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. Since the factory had no assembly branches outside Russia after 1991, its name is largely used today to refer to the building located in the lower eastern part of Moscow.

The word &quot;moskvich&quot; () itself translates as &quot;a native of Moscow, a Moscovite&quot;. It was used to point out the original location of the cars manufactured there.

==History==
===Early history===
The Soviet Union entered a series of five-year plans in 1928 under the rule of Joseph Stalin. The goals of the plan was to rapidly industrialise the economy of the Soviet Union. Included in these plans were provisions for the development of domestic automobile production. It was assumed that by improving the quality of life for the affected citizens and providing them with the opportunity to learn to drive during peacetime, they would constitute a cadre of trained drivers for the Red army in the event of armed conflict.

Industrial cooperation between Russia and the American Ford Motor Company dated back to the era of Nicholas II, with the company being an important supplier of passenger and commercial vehicles such as tractors and trucks. This cooperation persisted despite the events and ideology of the Russian Revolution, with tens of thousands of vehicles imported during the 1910s and 1920s. This was deemed necessary due to the devastation of the state and its economic output following the Great War, occupation of Russian territories by the Central Powers, and the Russian Civil War.

The construction of the Moscow Car Assembly Factory () began in 1929. In December 1930, the plant received the name of KIM (Factory named after Communist Youth International) , from 1930 to 1939 its official name was Moscow Car Assembly Factory named after KIM () and then from 1939 until the beginning of the Great Patriotic War it was called Moscow Car Factory named after KIM ().

In 1930, the licensed production of Ford Model A and Ford Model AA vehicles began. These were assembled using knock-down kits. In 1933, the plant became a branch of GAZ and began to assemble GAZ-A and GAZ-AA vehicles. In 1939, KIM was no longer a subsidiary of GAZ and in the following year it started to produce their first own model, the KIM 10 inspired by the Ford Prefect. The plant&#x27;s newly formed design department was headed by A. N. Ostrovtsev, an engineer from the NAMI, and tasked by the Economic Committee of Sovnarkom with designing a small economy car suitable for large scale manufacture. From November 1940 to April 1941, 338 sedans were assembled. Exact production numbers for the phaeton version are unknown.

=== Great Patriotic War ===

In May 1941 the Red Army subjected a KIM-10 to a series of tests, including in road conditions varying from the newly built Moscow-Minsk Highway to rural mud roads and off-road. Despite the official “mostly satisfactory” mark, the car proved to be unsuited to the requirements of the military service.

In October, 1941 the plant was hastily evacuated to Ural. Most of the manufacturing equipment was abandoned or destroyed during the Battle of Moscow.

In 1944, with a Soviet Victory imminent, plans were in place to continue production of the KIM-10-52.

=== First generation ===
In August 1945, the plant was renamed to the Moscow Plant of Small Cars (MZMA) ().

Following the war, the Soviet Union requested vehicle tooling and designs from Germany as part of war reparations, to compensate for the loss of industrial equipment in the Battle of Moscow. Soviet planners wished for a car similar in specifications to the KIM 10, and as such rejected the KdF-Wagen and DKW F8. The Opel Kadett K38 was found to match these requirements. In August 1945, the State Defense Committee published Order No. 9905, which prescribed the start of production of the Kadett, under the Moskvitch-400 name. The implementation of this order was however deeply complicated. The Opelwerk Brandenburg plant had been deeply involved in the Nazi German war effort, producing aircraft engines for the Luftwaffe, and had been heavily damaged by Allied bombing. However, a number of Kadetts had been captured by the Red Army and were available for study, and was accomplished through joint Soviet-German ventures overseen by the Soviet Military Administration in Germany. Nonetheless, the majority of stamping dies and tooling were freshly produced in the Soviet Union due to the amount of damage to the factory. Production of the Moskvitch 400-420 began in December 1946, and continued for ten years until 1956 with the improved Moskvitch 401. In total 247,439 400 and 401 models had been built, with some being exported to countries such as Belgium, East Germany and Norway.

=== Second generation ===

MZMA replaced the 400 and 401 with new designs starting in 1956, developed within the Soviet Union. This marked the second generation of production vehicles for the enterprise. This started with the Moskvitch 402, followed on by upgraded variants in the form of the Moskvitch 403 and Moskvitch 407, which featured improvements such as independent suspension, improved interior and radio included, comparable to models such as the Hillman Minx, Fiat 1100, and Ford Consul. The Moskvitch 402 series could be considered as the first step in Soviet and Russian automotive history towards producing adapted models for various use cases. While the Moskvitch 407 provided greater driving comfort at larger expenses, other trim levels included the Moskvitch 407-424 station wagon available for the general public, Moskvitch 431 van and even the Moskvitch 410/411 attempt of creating an early off-road sedan/station wagon. The M-407 was the first Soviet automotive export to be truly successful in the West. Up to half of all Moskvitch 407 production was reserved for export, mainly to the Eastern Bloc countries, Norway, Finland, and France.

=== Third generation ===
The 1960s bought about a third generation of cars, with the more advanced Moskvitch 408, Moskvitch 412 and Moskvitch 2140. On May 18, 1967, the company produced its one millionth car. The Moskvitch 408 was the first Soviet-built car to be designed with extra safety features in mind, including crumple zones, safer steering column, soft interior parts, seat belts, a padded dashboard, and a split circuit braking system. The first series of Moskvitch 408 cars had vertical rear lights, two or four round headlights, a front bench seat, and a 4-speed manual transmission with column mounted gear lever. The second generation 408 was produced between 1969 and 1976. It had the same engine and transmission as its predecessor, but an updated body fitted with rectangular headlights and horizontal rear lights, with triangular turn signal markers mounted on tailfins. It additionally included separated bucket seats and the transmission used a floor-mounted gear lever. The 408 was popular due to its good value in countries such as the United Kingdom, Finland and Norway. The Moskvitch 412 improved on this design with various engine and styling improvements.

In 1966 during a visit by French President Charles de Gaulle to the Soviet Union, an agreement was signed between MZMA and Renault. Renault would assist in the reconstruction of the plant in Moscow, as well as cooperate in the establishment of a second plant in Izhevsk.

In 1969, both the 412 and the related 408 had their bodies redesigned. These were notable for being the first Moskvitch models to feature rectangular headlights and horizontal rear lights. Safety improvements were also incorporated over time, with the Moskvitch 412 meeting the safety standards adopted by the UNECE, and received an international safety certificate as a result of almost five months of tests in France. The 412 was the first Moskvitch vehicle to pass safety-feature tests in France, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Sweden and West Germany.

In October 1968, the name of the factory was changed from MZMA to Automobile Factory in Honour of the Leninist Communist Youth Union (AZLK) (), to mark the 50th anniversary of the Komsomol.

SATRA Motors entered M-412s in the Group One Production Saloon Car Championship in 1972 and 1973, where it easily beat &quot;sharp-handling but underpowered&quot; British Hillman Imps and Austin Minis. Further improvements were also made in the form of the Moskvitch 2138 and Moskvitch 2140, based on a modified Moskvitch 412 platform.

=== Fourth generation ===
In 1986, the Moskvitch-2141 Aleko became available for the first time. It was influenced by the Simca 1307 (which had also been badged as the Chrysler/Talbot Alpine, and under other names, in western markets). It was upgraded and restyled during the period of its production. It was powered by the 1.5 L UZAM used in the M-412 model and VAZ-2106 1.6 L in-line, four-cylinder engines, which had by then had been used in several LADA models. Aleko was different from any model the factory had made previously; it was larger and more luxurious, made with more comfort, safety, and aerodynamics in mind. The new car had such features as front-wheel drive, a hatchback body style, MacPherson strut front suspension and torsion-crank rear suspension. It had rack-and-pinion steering and a collapsible steering column. The 1.8-liter gasoline engine for the new car was planned, but never materialized, as was also the case with a diesel version. In the early 1990s, AZLK still remained one of the largest auto companies in the USSR. Design and experimental work were prepared to create a new model car (sedan M-2142) and an engine plant. However, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, due to a financial crisis, disruptions in the work of the company, and financial mismanagement, the engine plant was not finished and the Moskvitch company fell into decline.

===OAO Moskvitch===
The factory, which had been renamed to OAO Moskvitch (Moskvitch Joint-Stock Company) in the early 1990s, filed for bankruptcy in 2002 and ceased production. Unfinished bodyshells remained on the production line in various stages of completion, while furniture, computers, office supplies, and documents remained in the plant&#x27;s administration building. Several attempts to restart production had been made over the next 3 years, but none were successful.

Technopolis Moscow was opened in 2012 on the premises of the factory.

A portion of the abandoned plant was acquired by Avtoframos (later renamed as Renault Russia), a joint venture between the City of Moscow and French automaker Renault. In 2005, Avtoframos commenced assembly of Renault Logan sedans from imported knock-down kits. It later became a wholly owned subsidiary of Renault.

The bankruptcy of OAO Moskvitch was officially announced in 2006, and the company was liquidated the following year. As of 2016, over a million Moskvitch cars remained on Russian roads.

In 2015, Renault announced they had begun the process for obtaining the Moskvitch rights in Russia.

=== JSC Automobile Plant Moskvitch ===
In May 2022, as a result of international sanctions against Russia, Renault sold its Moscow plant to the Moscow city government which intended to nationalize the facility for renewed production of vehicles under the Moskvitch name.

Moskvitch presented its new range of models on July 6, 2022: a sedan and 3 SUVs, Model I having both a fuel version as well as an electric version. The cars have names made up of Roman numerals, from I and II to IV. All models are rebadged cars from Chinese manufacturer JAC.

On October 20, the mayor of Moscow, Sergey Sobyanin, said that the production of Moskvich vehicles will resume in December at Renault&#x27;s former factory in Moscow, now renamed the &quot;Moscow Automobile Factory Moskvich&quot;, which has been inactive after Renault decided to leave the Russian market.

On December 26, 2022, the Moskvitch 3 and Moskvitch 3e went on sale in Russia, with the JAC JS4 based cars produced in association with truck manufacturer Kamaz.

In early 2023, Moskvitch and Yandex Taxi signed an agreement of intent to supply 3,000 Moskvitch 3, and 2,000 Moskvitch 3e taxi and car share vehicles. This was followed by the introduction of Moskvitch 3 vehicles for the car services Citydrive, BelkaCar, Taxovichkof and Citymobil. Furthermore, traffic police in Moscow Oblast and Stavropol Krai began to be equipped with Moskvitch 3e electric crossovers. Furthermore, delivery was in progress for traffic police in Moscow City, Krasnodar and Krasnoyarsk.

In June 2023, Hans Peter Moser was appointed General Manager of Moskvitch, replacing Dmitry Valentinovich Pronin, who would move to the position of chairman of the board of directors. Moser had previously worked for the Russian truck manufacturer Kamaz, as well as the German industrial firm Knorr-Bremse. In addition, Moskvitch further announced an expansion of their dealer network to more cities across Russia, as well as the impending release of a new Moskvitch 6 model later in 2023, as well as the Moskvitch 5.

==== Belgium ====
The Moskvitch 408 was manufactured in Belgium under the Scaldia name. In 1965, this name was changed to Scaldia-Volga. These vehicles were imported partially built from the Soviet Union, with their engines and transmission installed after arrival in Belgium. Some of these vehicles were equipped with British origin Perkins diesel engines. The Moskvitch 2141 Aleko was also assembled by Scaldia-Volga for a short period of time.

==== Bulgaria ====

Moskvitch 408, Moskvitch 412, Moskvitch 2140 and Moskvitch 2141 Aleko models were license produced in Lovech, Bulgaria by Balkancar under the Rila marque. Some of these vehicles were identical in configuration to those produced by Moskvitch/AZLK, while some, like their Belgian counterparts, made use of British origin Perkins diesel engines.

<text>The Oxford English Dictionary gives the etymology of teil as Latin &quot;tilia&quot; and Old French (13th to 15th centuries) &quot;til&quot;. In Modern French it is &quot;tilleul&quot;. The French and Latin word cognates appeared amongst the English literate classes starting in the 14th century. Most names of trees, however, kept their Germanic origins, hence linden and lime (a deformation of lind according to the OED). The linden or til tree is native to northern Europe and Asia. In various versions of Protestant Bibles the til is sometimes confused with the terebinth, which is a tree native to southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. One variety of terebinth furnishes the pistachio nut and the thick bark of the tree is a source of a highly valued varnish and particular turpentine (Modern French, térébenthine). The English and French translations in the Roman Catholic Douay Bible from the Vulgate do not confuse the two trees.

The Easton&#x27;s Bible Dictionary (1897) says that Teil tree is an old name for the linden tree, the tilia (also known as &quot;lime tree&quot; in the UK).

The name was used in the King James Version of the Bible for the Hebrew word &quot;elah&quot;, a word that more modern translations translate as &quot;terebinth&quot; or &quot;oak&quot; – this seems to be the chief source of Web references to the name, but the linden tree does not grow in the Middle East in present-day where the Bible verses are describing now. The translators of this version may have used &quot;teil tree&quot; rather than &quot;linden&quot; as an intention to distinguish this Middle Eastern tree (identified as a pistachio tree by Israeli philologist Avi Gold) from the similar European linden tree.

&quot;Teil Tree &quot; is mentioned only in the book of Isaiah.

 &quot;But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall be eaten: as a Teil Tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in them, when they cast their leaves: so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof.&quot;

<text>GAZ or Gorkovsky avtomobilny zavod () is a Russian automotive manufacturer located in Nizhny Novgorod, formerly known as Gorky (Горький) (1932–1990). It is the core subsidiary of GAZ Group Holding, which is itself part of Basic Element industrial group. JSC Russian Machines is the controlling shareholder in OAO GAZ.

==History==
===Early history===
In May 1929 the Soviet Union signed an agreement with the American Ford Motor Company. Under its terms, the Soviets agreed to purchase $13 million worth of automobiles and parts, while Ford agreed to give technical assistance until 1938 to construct an integrated automobile-manufacturing plant at Nizhny Novgorod. The factory was founded and production started on 1 January 1932. At the time the factory was known as Nizhny Novgorod Automobile Plant, short NAZ (&quot;Nizhegorodskiy avtomobilny zavod&quot;), full name Nizhny Novgorod Automobile Plant named after V. M. Molotov (&quot;Nizhegorodskiy avtomobilny zavod imeni V. M. Molotova&quot;), after the Soviet minister Vyacheslav Molotov. In 1932 the plant produced its first automobiles, GAZ-AA (originally known as NAZ-AA, as they were manufactured before Nizhny Novgorod became Gorky) truck and GAZ-A passenger car (manufactured after Nizhny Novgorod became Gorky). The cars were based on the Ford Model AA and Ford Model A, respectively.

In 1933, the factory&#x27;s name changed to &quot;Gorkovsky avtomobilny zavod&quot;, or GAZ, when the city was renamed after Maxim Gorky.

The GAZ-A was succeeded by the more modern GAZ-M1 (based largely on the four-cylinder version of the Ford Model B), produced from 1936 to 1942. The M letter stands for &quot;Molotovets&quot; (&#x27;of Molotov&#x27;s fame&#x27;), it was the origin of the car&#x27;s nickname, &quot;M&#x27;ka&quot; (эмка).

During the war, GAZ assembled Chevrolet G7107 and G7117 (G7107 with winch) from parts shipped from the US under Lend Lease.

===Postwar period===

At that time, GAZ engineers worked to develop an all-new car model to enter production once hostilities ended. Called the GAZ-M20 Pobeda (Victory), this affordably-priced sedan with streamlined, fastback styling, entered production in 1946 and was produced by GAZ until 1958. (Licensed production under the name Warszawa continued in Polish FSO until the 1970s). It was the first Soviet car with electric windshield wipers (rather than mechanical- or vacuum-operated ones).

GAZ also made GAZ-12 ZIM, GAZ-21 and GAZ-24 Volga and the luxury cars GAZ-13 and GAZ-14 Chaika. The ZIM was the first GAZ car to feature the leaping deer hood ornament. The GAZ-21 made its public debut in 1955, with a three cars on a demonstration drive from Moscow to the Crimea, two automatic models and a manual. It was launched in 1956 and became a symbol of the whole Soviet epoch. The car offered front seats able to fold flat and came standard with cigarette lighter and a radio at a time when most American-built cars did not have a radio. A small number of Volgas with the Chaika engine, automatic transmission, and power steering were built for the KGB as the M23, 603 were built in 1962–1970. As the car&#x27;s leading engineer Boris Dekhtyar recalled, the new version of the Volga had improved brake pads and reached a higher top speed of over 170 km/h; it was well received. The new engine produced 195 h.p. at 4,400 rpm.

In the 1960s GAZ plant renewed its truck range by launching such models as GAZ-52, GAZ-53А and GAZ-66. In the 1960s and 1970s, the plant was overhauled and updated; 1962 saw it fitted with the Soviet Union&#x27;s first automated precision shop. In 1994 the plant started production of GAZelle light commercial vehicles.

The plant became &quot;AvtoGAZ&quot;, with the integration of its various subcontractors, on 24 August 1971; the same year, it was awarded the Order of Lenin. GAZ produced its ten millionth vehicle in March 1981. In the late 1990s GAZ was deemed to be the best managed Russian automotive manufacturer.

===SibAl takeover===

In November 2000 GAZ was acquired in a hostile takeover by SibAl. In March 2003 GAZ declared that the production of passenger cars was no longer a priority for the company, and plans to release a new GAZ-3115 model had been abandoned.

In 2006, GAZ made a move on the LDV company based in Birmingham, England, and acquired the van maker from the venture capital group Sun European Partners, LLP in July of that year. GAZ said that they planned to market the MAXUS (LDV&#x27;s new Panel-van that was released in January 2005) into the rest of Europe and Asia. GAZ proposed to increase production in the LDV plant in England, while also commencing production of the MAXUS in a new plant in Russia. However, due to the recession, the production at the LDV plant was halted and the plant was sold to a Chinese company called ECO Concept in 2009.

As then DaimlerChrysler modernized its Sterling Heights Assembly plant in 2006, the old Chrysler Sebring / Dodge Stratus assembly line and tooling was sold to GAZ and was shipped to Nizhny Novgorod in Russia. Since then GAZ car facility is used for contract manufacturing for Volkswagen and General Motors.

===Andersson leadership===

In 2009, Bo Andersson, former Vice-President of General Motors, was invited to become a President/CEO of GAZ Group.

In 2010, GAZ upgraded its model range by launching new GAZelle-BUSINESS lineup with diesel and petrol engines and LPG equipment.

In November 2010 the company decided to end production of the Volga Siber, its last GAZ passenger car model, and to discontinue the GAZ Volga range. In December 2010, GAZ Group signed a memorandum of understanding with Daimler on contract manufacturing of Mercedes-Benz Sprinter at GAZ plant in Nizhny Novgorod. It is expected that production will start in 2013.

In February 2011, General Motors and GAZ Group signed an agreement on contract assembly of the new Chevrolet Aveo car at GAZ plant in Nizhny Novgorod. As of December 2012, production was underway with an expected annual production of 30,000 vehicles.

In June 2011, Volkswagen Group Rus and GAZ Group signed a long-term agreement on contract manufacturing at GAZ plant with total investment of €200 million. It is planned to produce Škoda Yeti, the new Volkswagen Jetta and Škoda Octavia. The total production volume in the peak years will be about 110,000 vehicles. In November 2011, under the contract manufacturing agreement, GAZ started SKD assembly of Škoda Yeti; full-cycle production started in December 2012.

===Recent developments===

In April 2019, GAZ asked for a $468 million bailout from the Russian government, saying that US sanctions on Oleg Deripaska and his assets put the company at risk of default. On July 4, 2019, workers from GAZ protested against the US sanctions in front of the US embassy in Moscow as an opposition to measures they claim will lead to the bankruptcy of the company.

In November 2021, &quot;GAZ Group&quot; announced that its division, &quot;Silovye Agregaty&quot;, would be ready for mass production of hydrogen engines in 2.5 years.

<doc id="69156" wikidata="Q908182" url="?curid=69156" title="GAZ Chaika">
<text>The GAZ Chaika (), which means gull, is a luxury automobile from the Soviet Union made by GAZ (&quot;Gorkovsky Avtomobilny Zavod&quot;, translated as Gorky Automobile Plant (Russian: &quot;ГАЗ&quot; or &quot;Го́рьковский автомоби́льный заво́д&quot;)). The vehicle is one step down from the ZIL-111 limousine, and was produced in much larger numbers. Chaika production consisted of two generations, the GAZ-13 from 1959 to 1981 and the GAZ-14 from 1977 to 1988.

== GAZ-13 Chaika ==

The GAZ-13 Chaika debuted in 1958 and was exhibited internationally at the Brussels motor show. It was produced from 1959 to 1981, with a total of 3,179 built. The GAZ-13 was powered by a 195-hp SAE gross 5.5 L V8 and driven through a push-button automatic transmission of a similar design to the Chrysler TorqueFlite unit. It was offered as a saloon (GAZ-13), limousine (GAZ-13A), and four-door cabriolet (GAZ-13B) with an electrohydraulic top. The cabriolet was made in 1961 and 1962 for official parades. A station wagon version was also offered as a hearse or ambulance.

== GAZ-14 Chaika ==

The GAZ-13&#x27;s styling had become antiquated by the 1970s, and it was succeeded by the more modern &quot;GAZ-14 Chaika&quot; introduced in 1977 (although production of both versions overlapped by several years). Although visually modern and fitted with the latest electronic luxury features, the GAZ-14 was in fact built around the drivetrain and undercarriage of the older model. Chaikas were mainly used by local governors, as the more luxurious ZiL were usually reserved exclusively for members of the Politburo, but in some cases it found its way up to the top, such as in Cuba where it was used by Fidel Castro.

<text>UAZ or Ulyanovsky Avtomobilny Zavod () is an automobile manufacturer based in Ulyanovsk, Russia, which manufactures off-road vehicles, buses and trucks. It has been part of the Sollers automotive group since 2000.

UAZ is best known for the UAZ-469 utility vehicle, which has seen wide use as a military vehicle in the Eastern bloc and around the world. The UAZ factory started production in 1941 as part of the Soviet war effort. 51,706 UAZ vehicles were produced in 2016.

==History==
===War and postwar===
The Ulyanovsk Automobile Plant was founded in 1941 as a direct result of the German invasion of the Soviet Union. In response to this threat, the government of Joseph Stalin ordered the evacuation of strategically crucial industrial centers to the East. By October 1941, the rapid German drive to Moscow, triggered the decision to relocate the Moscow automotive manufacturer ZIS to the Volga town of Ulyanovsk. The town, already a nascent industrial center with a sufficiently developed infrastructure and a good supply of skilled workers, would be an ideal location for the reconstituted factory. It was also safely out of reach of the German army. At that time of its founding, the plant was considered a subsidiary of ZIS. By 1942, the plant began production of artillery shells and automobiles. The first vehicle produced at the plant was the ZIS-5 three-ton truck.

In 1943, when the prospect of a German victory had become far less likely, it was decided the relocated plant would remain in Ulyanovsk and be separated administratively from ZIS, which would be rebuilt in Moscow from scratch. This was in line with the Soviet post-war policy regarding various relocated industrial operations. It was considered more efficient to leave the newly built plants as is, while the original plants, provided they survived the war were outfitted anew, frequently with captured German machinery. At the end of 1944, the production of the ZIS-5 was transferred to The Ural Automotive Plant in Miass, while the Ulyanovsk plant began producing the smaller GAZ-AA in 1947. UAZ developed a prototype 1.5-tonne truck in 1948, using the ubiquitous inline four of the &quot;Pobeda&quot;; this, the UAZ-300, was never built, due to a lack of production capacity. In 1954, production was expanded to include the GAZ-69, and the first batches were assembled from GAZ parts. Two years later, the factory was not just assembling GAZ-69s from parts delivered elsewhere, but manufacturing them in their entirety.

The connection with GAZ led UAZ to be the top Soviet manufacturer of four-wheel drive vehicles.

===Golden age===
UAZ began its growth away from being a mere assembler in 1954, with the creation of its own design office. It was this office, responding to a request from the Red Army, that in 1955 created a forward control van project, codenamed &quot;Forty&quot;, on the GAZ-69 chassis. This became the UAZ-450, the first Soviet &quot;cabover&quot; truck. The prototype appeared in 1956, and was tested in both the Caucasus Mountains and the Crimea. Its loaded weight was 2.7 tonnes, and it, like all the UAZ-450 series vehicles, was powered by a low-compression inline-four (based on the ubiquitous &quot;Pobeda&quot;″s, but with an bore, rather than ), and the &quot;Pobeda&quot;″s three-speed transmission, while the transfer case, drive axles, leaf springs, and drum brakes came from the GAZ-69.

In 1958, UAZ began production of the UAZ-450 series of trucks and vans. The first model was the UAZ-450A ambulance; with room for two stretchers and four-wheel drive, it was arguably the best in the world for use in remote areas. It was followed by the UAZ-450D drop-side pickup, which had an payload; the UAZ-450 van, with a payload; and the 11-seat UAZ-450V microbus. All the UAZ-450 series were capable of disconnecting the front drive axle and of reaching , achieving fuel economy of , and of towing an trailer.

A two-wheel drive variant of the UAZ-450 was announced on 12 December 1961, with the UAZ-450&#x27;s wheelbase and engine, as the UAZ-451 (van), UAZ-451D (drop-side pickup), UAZ-451A (ambulance), and UAZ-451B (minibus). The ambulance spawned a prototype UAZ-452GP with hydropneumatic suspension, to enable it to cross rough ground at high speed, following on the work done by Citroën on the DS19. The system proved very successful on trials, but it was rejected by the Soviet Army as too complicated, and so never entered production.

In 1966, the UAZ-451s were updated with a inline-four (still based on the &quot;Pobeda&quot;″s), four-speed gearbox, and minor detail changes, plus a stronger chassis (and so higher payload). The models were a redesignated UAZ-451M (van, with an payload) and a UAZ-451DM (pickup, with a payload). Maximum speed was .

In 1966, the four-wheel drives were renumbered UAZ-452 (van), UAZ-452D (pickup), UAZ-452V (minibus), UAZ-452A and UAZ-452G (both ambulances, with different patient capacities). There was also the UAZ-452S ambulance, specially designed for Arctic conditions, with more heating capacity, double-glazed windows, and insulation; they proved able to keep a 30 °C interior temperature in −60 °C outside conditions. The UAZ-452 was able to cross of snow and carry an load. The UAZ-452s would go on to become a workhorse of Soviet agriculture and police, with the pickup proving a popular commercial vehicle. Export versions of the UAZ-452D were called Trekmaster when sold in Britain, but never in large numbers; there was also a version with a British-built dump body, the Tipmaster.

The UAZ-451S was a snow-crossing variant with front skis and rear tracks; it was never produced in quantity, nor was the UAZ-451S2, which had tracks at front and rear. The UAZ-452 also served as the basis for an articulated model, the UAZ-452P, that was never put into production.

In 1972 the well-regarded, but outdated, GAZ-69 was replaced by the more modern UAZ-469. This was developed from the UAZ-471 of 1958 (with four-wheel independent suspension, which proved too complex) and the UAZ-460. The UAZ-469 was a sturdy, but not-so-comfortable vehicle with the ability to overcome virtually any terrain, while also providing ease of maintenance. The UAZ-469 was not made available to the civilian market until the late 1980s, before which time it was built exclusively for police and military use, as well as heads of agricultural enterprises (kolhozes and sovkhozes). A commercially available variant was produced by the Lutzk Automotive Works.

===Later years===
In the 1990s, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, UAZ became a joint-stock company and soon received the Golden Globe and Golden Mercury Awards for a significant volume of sales and its contribution to the Russian economy.

On 5 August 1997, the new UAZ-3160 went into production and received a gold medal at an international fair in Yekaterinburg. The car was used as the basis for the later Simbir and UAZ-3163.

In March 2003, UAZ opened an assembly line in Vietnam. On 20 November, the company produced the last UAZ-31512 and the first UAZ Hunter.

On 17 August 2005, the first UAZ Patriots rolled off the assembly line. They had new suspension, transmission and steering control and became the first brand new models of UAZ since the fall of the Soviet Union. The same year the assembly line had undergone a large-scale modernization. The company signed contracts with foreign suppliers and used a significant number of foreign components in its newest vehicles.

In 2006, UAZ opened a new control and test section of the main assembly line and presented 4 new cars at the Moscow International Automobile Salon.

In the following years UAZ introduced a number of additional options and improvements in its vehicles, such as the better heating and ventilation of the passenger compartment, engine cooling system, together with Lukoil introduced a new line of motor oils for its cars, offered Iveco diesel engines and launched the UAZ Cargo, a light commercial truck based on the UAZ Patriot.

In 2012, the Patriot and the Pickup received a new engine, ZMZ Euro-4 with European on-board diagnostics, which became the first Russian diesel engine to meet the Euro-4 Standard published in 1998. 2013 was the banner year for UAZ, with export sales increasing by 37% since 2012. The next year the sales of the Patriot rose by 10%, and the company was visited by Premier Dmitry Medvedev.

During a test drive in 2014, a UAZ Patriot crossed winter roads and frozen tundra of the Sakha Republic and reached one of the northernmost Russian ports at Tiksi, being the first car to cross the 73rd parallel north moving under its own power.

In January 2015, the sales increased by 3%. A UAZ Patriot support vehicle took part in the 2015 Dakar Rally, crossing the route of 9,295 km through Bolivia, Chile and Peru. The company finished the production of special series of UAZ Hunters, which were to be replaced by newer models; these Hunters were a limited edition and had airbrushed artistic paintings on them commemorating the 70th anniversary of the victory in World War II. In August the UAZ Patriot received new upgrades, including new paint colors, 18-inch wheels, interiors, frameless wiper blades, etc. The same year UAZ trucks were present at the Moscow Off-Road Show 2015, Interpolitech-2015 and ComTrans-2015 exhibitions.

UAZ delisted from the Moscow Exchange in July 2015.

In May 2023, Izvestia reported that UAZ would shortly launch knock down production of vehicles in Cuba, as a result of negotiations between Russian and Cuban enterprises. Service centers for the repair and maintenance of these vehicles would also be set up in the country. The Cuban side of the delegation was reportedly the most interested in UAZ Profi delivery vehicles, as well as ambulances based on the UAZ Classic. The first batch of machine kits will go to Cuba in July–August 2023. UAZ further stated that vehicle production would increase by 2,000 units, as well as increase employee wages by 12%.

In June 2023, UAZ announced plans to launch a limited anniversary edition of the UAZ Classic.

<text>ZAZ or Zaporizhzhia Automobile Building Plant (, &quot;Zaporiz&#x27;kyi avtomobilebudivnyi zavod&quot; or &quot;Zaporiz&#x27;kyi avtozavod&quot;) is the main automobile manufacturer of Ukraine, based in the south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia. It also produces buses and trucks and is known for its former parent company&#x27;s name, AvtoZAZ.

== History ==
The date of foundation of the plant is considered to be 1863. In 1908, the company was founded, which later became the Melitopol Motor Plant (MeMZ). In 1923, the former Abram Koop plant was renamed the Communar. In 1960, the Melitopol Motor Plant began to supply its engines to the Zaporizhia Automobile Plant. Since 1975, MeMZ has become a part of the production association &quot;AvtoZAZ&quot;. Today it is one of the structural elements of PJSC &quot;ZAZ&quot;. In 1961 the plant was renamed &quot;Zaporizhia Automobile Plant&quot;. The plant was engaged in the production of a single car - ZAZ-965, which went down in history as a &quot;humpbacked Zaporozhets&quot;.

JV &quot;AvtoZAZ-DEU&quot; (since January 2003 - CJSC &quot;ZAZ&quot;) in the form of a closed joint stock company was established on April 15, 1998, on the production base of JSC &quot;Avtozaz&quot;. The authorized capital was formed at the expense of the founders&#x27; contributions: from OJSC Avtozaz - property in the amount equivalent to $150; from Daewoo Motors - $150 million. In addition to the main enterprise in Zaporizhia, the joint venture also included the Melitopol Motor Plant (Fracturing Plant AvtoZAZ-Motor), the Black Sea Plant of Automobile Units (Fracturing Plant ChZAA), and the Pologi Plant Iskra (Fracturing Plant Iskra) as self-supporting enterprises.

Following the bankruptcy of Daewoo Motors in 2001, UkrAvto bought AvtoZAZ in 2002. All production facilities of AvtoZAZ (primarily MeMZ and the Black Sea Motor Plant) were transformed into ZAZ. The company has even adopted a new logo. Daewoo&#x27;s stake (50%) in the joint venture was bought by the Swiss company Hirsch &amp; CIE in 2003.

PJSC &quot;ZAZ&quot; is now the only company in Ukraine that has a full cycle of passenger car production, which includes stamping, welding, painting, body equipment and car assembly. The plant has created and is constantly improving a qualitatively new modern high-tech production that meets the requirements of the international standard ISO 9001 version 2000.

The first three symbols of the VIN-code of Zaporizhia-made cars are Y6D.

===From A. J. Koop to Kommunar===
The company that became ZAZ developed out of four businesses founded by German entrepreneur Abram J. Koop to manufacture agricultural machinery. The factory had been built for local Mennonite industrialist Abram J. Koop in 1863. It produced iron parts for the windmills, reapers, threshers and plows. They were nationalized and restarted as the state-operated Kommunar factory which continued to produce twenty-four types of machines;. its first combine harvesters appeared in 1929, with 129,724 built by 1952 (not counting the war years). In 1930 Kommunar started to produce the first Soviet harvester Kommunar which was based on the American Holt Caterpillar horse-drawn harvester. The production of the harvester allowed the Soviet Union to cease import of harvesters from abroad.

===From harvesters to cars===
Design of a car accessible to the public, and one in part taking the place of the soon to be discontinued Moskvitch 401, began in 1956. Following the growing trend of small cars (then accounting for between 25% and 40% of all European car sales), the minister in charge of &quot;Minavtroprom&quot; (the Soviet automotive ministry) selected the new Fiat 600 as the model to follow. The first prototype, the MZMA 444, appeared in October 1957. It was powered by a flat twin-cylinder MD-65 engine provided by the Irbitskyi Motorcycle Plant, which was &quot;totally unsuited&quot;: it produced only and lasted only between major overhauls. As a result, a search for another engine was begun, and the success of the VW Type 1&#x27;s boxer led to a preference for an air-cooled engine, which NAMI (the National Automobile Institute) had on the drawing board. &quot;Minavtroprom&quot;, however, preferred a V4 engine, the NAMI-G, which had the additional advantage of being developed for the LuAZ-967.

The new car was approved for production 28 November 1958, the name changing to ZAZ (Zaporizhzhia Automobile Building Plant) to reflect the new profile. The Zaporizhzhia factory was supplemented with the Mikoyan Diesel-Building Factory in Melitopol, which was part of the &quot;Soyuzdiesel&quot; combinat.

The first car, dubbed the ZAZ-965 Zaporozhets, was delivered 12 June 1959, was approved 25 July 1960, and entered production 25 October.

Following on the success of the ZAZ-965, plant manager Yuri Sorochkin planned a forward control microbus on the ZAZ-965&#x27;s platform (akin to the VW Type 2 being built on a modified Type 1 pan), with a payload, as the ZAZ 970. Sorochkin hoped to capture the market for compact utility vehicles, which were in perennially short supply in the Soviet Union. The project was prototyped by a team under Yuri Danilov, which pioneered use of -thick steel in the Soviet Union. The steel was provided by Zaporizkyi Metallurgical Plant. The engine and transmission were straight out of a ZAZ-965, which caused liftover problems, because the V4 was mounted under the rear floor. Three prototypes were built in 1962: a van with payload and volume, a pickup with a payload, and a microbus able to seat six or seven plus a ; even four-wheel drive models (971, 971B, and 971V) were planned. None was built.
In 1975 the factory was consolidated in the AvtoZAZ holding, which was transformed into joint-stock company in 1990s. In 1986 ZAZ together with Comau installed a new production complex. The Illichivsk factory of automobile parts (IZAA) in one of the biggest freight sea ports on Black Sea in Illichivsk became part of the AutoZAZ holding. 

In November 1987, the plant began producing a new front wheel drive car ZAZ-1102 Tavria. In 1989, it became known that new models were being developed based on the &quot;Tavria&quot; - a five-door ZAZ-1105 and a &quot;Kombi&quot; model with &quot;station wagon&quot; body. In October 1989, the plant produced its three millionth car. All these cars were powered by a water cooled, front mounted MeMZ engine and fall into micro-class. 

=== In Ukraine ===
On June 1, 1994, the factory ceased production of its ZAZ-968M model.

When AvtoZAZ-Daewoo joint venture with Daewoo Motors was formed in 1998, ZAZ was assigned to the new company as a 50% share on behalf of AvtoZAZ. Daewoo Motors made large investments and established the production of its own models, while keeping and modernizing the native ZAZ brand. CKD kits of Daewoo Lanos, Daewoo Nubira and Daewoo Leganza started assembling the same year in Chornomorsk; at the same time, CKD assembly of a number of older VAZ models started.

Following the bankruptcy of Daewoo Motors in 2001, UkrAVTO corporation bought out AvtoZAZ holding in 2002. All of the AvtoZAZ manufacturing facilities (most notably, MeMZ and Illichivsk assembling plant) were reincorporated into ZAZ. The company even adopted a new logo. The Daewoo part in the joint venture was bought out by Swiss venture &quot;Hirsch &amp; CIE&quot; in 2003.

End of 2004 saw the beginning of full-scale production of completely domestic ZAZ Lanos (T150), now that CKD kits of Lanos were no longer supplied. In 2006, ZAZ reached an agreement with the Chinese manufacturer Chery Automobile to assemble passenger cars from kits and from 2011 started full-scale production of the Chery A13 under its own badge as ZAZ Forza. The same year production of the Chevrolet Aveo (T250) was moved from the FSO car factory to ZAZ.

By Decree of the President of Ukraine, CJSC &quot;ZAZ&quot; employees were rewarded with State awards of Ukraine in 2009.

In the first half of 2012 ZAZ manufactured 20,060 vehicles, a 30% decline from the same period in 2011. In 2012 Zaporizhzhia Automobile Building Plant started serial full-scale production of new car model, the ZAZ Vida.

=== The era of &quot;Zaporozhets&quot; ===

The history of passenger car production in Zaporizhia, which is identified with the history of the Ukrainian automobile industry in general, dates back to 1960, when the first Ukrainian microcar - ZAZ-965 &quot;Zaporozhets&quot; came off the assembly line of the Kommunar plant (currently PJSC ZAZ).

Production of serial machines began on October 1, 1960, and by the end of the year was released about one and a half thousand &quot;Zaporozhtsiv&quot;. ZAZ-965 &quot;Zaporozhets&quot; quickly became popular. It cost relatively little and was economical. Operating fuel consumption was 7.3 liters per 100 km against 10 liters in &quot;Moskvich-402&quot; or &quot;Moskvich-407&quot;. The full-fledged 4-seater was compact and maneuverable: its length was 3.33 m, and the radius of rotation behind the track of the outer wheel - 5 m. Independent suspension of all wheels, smooth, without a tunnel for the &quot;cardan&quot;, bottom, 20-centimeter ground clearance the rear axle provided good passability. There were, of course, shortcomings. For example, the noise, which often annoyed the rear passengers. The doors opened in the old-fashioned way, against the move, and could, if accidentally opened on the move, become a sail that could easily take the car off the road. Unsuccessful, from the point of view of fire safety, was the location of the gas tank in front of the body.

Many motorists were not satisfied with the insufficient engine power, and therefore - the weak dynamics of the &quot;Zaporozhets&quot;. Therefore, in October 1962 the production of the modernized ZAZ-965A began. Engine displacement increased from 746 to 887 cm3, respectively, power increased from 22 to 27 hp. The maximum speed has also increased - from 80 to 90 km / h. This machine was produced until 1969. When the 130th anniversary of the plant was celebrated in September 1993, the festive motorcade was opened by one of the first &quot;Zaporozhians&quot;, decorated with a banner with the number 332 106. This is the number of cars produced during the years of production - from 1960 to 1969. In 1961, ZAZ designers began to develop the ZAZ-966 car with a new body. However, its production was delayed due to the allied leadership, perhaps for economic reasons - to put on the assembly line a new model just a year after the release of the previous one was considered inappropriate. Therefore, ZAZ-966 was released only six years later. Its engine was also located at the rear. Initially, it was a 30-horsepower MeMZ-966A, which was installed on the latest modifications of the &quot;humpback&quot; predecessor. Then came the 40-horsepower MeMZ-966V, which allowed the car to accelerate to 120 km / h on a straight road. However, in practice, not everyone could develop such a speed, and fines for speeding &quot;Zaporozhets&quot; were so rare that in itself such an event was regarded as a topic worthy of a joke.

Since 1969, on the basis of the model ZAZ-966 began to produce ZAZ-968 with a new engine and some minor changes. Since 1975 in the same body - ZAZ-968A. It featured a new brake system, improved front seats and an ignition lock with anti-theft device. Before the ZAZ-968A in 1972 there was a slightly modernized model ZAZ-968 - it did not have a decorative panel on the front of the body, there was a new unit. A more serious reworking awaited the model in 1979–1980.

ZAZ-968M became not only the last domestic car with a rear engine, but also the most durable, because it was produced until 1994. But he received a new line of engines: more powerful MeMZ-968 GE (45 hp) and MeMZ-968 BE (50 hp).

In total (from 1960 to 1994) 3,422,444 Zaporozhets cars in Zaporizhia and air-cooled engines in Melitopol were manufactured.

=== The era of «Tavria» ===
The history of &quot;Tavria&quot; is interesting and diverse, because the current car was preceded by many different prototypes, some of which have remained forever in the form of models, dusted in the design offices of ZAZ, and others were embodied in metal and once passed running tests .

The first conceptual variant that left the plant on its own was the front-wheel drive ZAZ-1102 &quot;Tavria&quot; of the 1970 model, developed by a group of Kommunar specialists under the leadership of chief designer Steshenko. However, the tests revealed many design flaws that determined the museum&#x27;s future of this car.

In 1973, two more experimental models were prepared with a 3-door hatchback and a 4-door sedan, which also failed to reach the level of a production car. The next stages in the evolution of the ZAZ-1102 Tavria were the 1974 front-wheel drive prototype with an elegant sedan body and the all-wheel drive version of the 1976 model with a completely modern appearance at the time.

The designers of the Kommunar plant needed a lot of time to prepare and launch into serial production in 1988 the final version of the ZAZ-1102 &quot;Tavria&quot;. In 1991, three years after the start of production, the car was restyled, during which the shape of the front wings and interior elements changed. To reduce the cost of the car, attempts were made to switch from expensive front Czech optics to domestic. The cessation of production threatened &quot;Tavria&quot; in the mid-1990s, because buyers did not have money for a new car. And the quality of ZAZ products was severely lame: it concerned both the production itself and the components. But despite the difficult times in 1995, the plant prepared for production a new model based on &quot;Tavria&quot; - a five-door station wagon ZAZ-1105 &quot;Dana&quot;, which was produced until 1997.

Since 1994, a new circuit for switching on the electric fan has been introduced and the design of the half-axles has been changed. But the introduction of local Ukrainian components has negatively affected the overall quality of the models, especially after 1992.

After the founding of JV AvtoZAZ-Daewoo in 1998, some modernization of the structure and saturation of the market with imported (Korean) components, there was hope for the rehabilitation of the quality of the car. In 1998, the so-called &quot;transitional samples&quot; were still in production, the complete set of which may not correspond to the declared one.

In the fall of 1995, the ZAZ-1103 Slavuta, a five-door liftback based on the Tavria base, was presented. In 1999, its serial production began.

=== &quot;AvtoZAZ-Daewoo&quot; ===
In 1998, a Ukrainian-Korean joint venture with foreign investment was registered in the form of the closed joint-stock company AvtoZAZ-Daewoo. Production of a qualitatively new ZAZ-110206 &quot;Tavria-Nova&quot; car has been introduced. Production preparation works have been completed and large-scale assembly of European-level cars Daewoo Lanos, Daewoo Nubira, Daewoo Leganza has been started at the Black Sea Automobile Assembly Plant.

Thanks to the financial support of a foreign partner, new technologies, unique quality control systems, engineering developments, which were introduced together with investments, as well as the consistent assistance of the state, a new historical stage has begun for Zaporizhzhya plant. In 1999, UkrAvto Corporation was delegated the functions of managing the state-owned stake in the plant. In 2002, UkrAvto Corporation became the owner of the state block of shares of Zaporizhzhya Automobile Plant (more than 82% of shares of OJSC AvtoZAZ, which in turn owns 50% of shares of CJSC ZAZ) and received the right to manage the enterprise and, in particular, its production programs. In January 2003, the company was renamed the Zaporizhia Automobile Plant.

During 1998–2003, the company underwent profound structural changes according to new, world standards. organized quality control of products that meet international standards; production of Daewoo cars began at the car assembly plant in the Black Sea; after modernization at the main plant in Zaporozhye, the production of a qualitatively new Tavria was resumed; administrative and personnel policy changed. This period was also marked by significant changes in the strategy opened up new prospects and opportunities for cooperation with the greats of the global automotive business - DaimlerChrysler, General Motors, Opel, Renault and others, which allowed to implement investment projects to organize full-scale production of leading global brands.

=== PJSC &quot;ZAZ&quot; ===
In 2003, the plant changed its form of ownership and became a Closed Joint-Stock Company with Foreign Investment &quot;Zaporizhzhya Automobile Plant&quot;.

Also in 2003, a general distribution agreement was concluded between UkrAvto Corporation (represented by one of its divisions - UkrAvtoZAZ-Service), Zaporizhia Automobile Plant and the German company Adam Opel GmbH (European representative office of GMC). Opel acted as a production partner of ZAZ and UkrAvto, providing investments for the development of large- and small-scale production of cars of its model range.

In the same year, the Swiss financial and investment company Hirsch &amp; Cie acquired a 50% stake in ZAZ owned by Daewoo Motors.

In 2004, serial production of the Opel Astra Classic began.

In 2005, full-scale production of the Daewoo Lanos began at the Zaporizhia Automobile Plant.

UkrAvto Corporation became the main shareholder of the flagship of the Polish automotive industry - the FSO plant. The Chevrolet Lanos car, manufactured by the Zaporizhia Automobile Plant, was exported to Russia.

In 2005, ZAZ designers developed the ZAZ Lanos Pick-up.

In 2005, the plant produced 148,163 cars, in 2006 - 193,113.

In 2006, the production of I-VAN buses was started on the basis of the platform of the well-known Indian company TATA.

In 2010, the production of ZAZ A10 buses with a load-bearing body and units of leading European companies began.

September 10, 2010 - ZAZ Lanos Electro van and ZAZ-A10C31 and ZAZ-A10L50 buses were presented at the 2010 Auto Show in Kyiv.

In 2011, production of a new model - ZAZ Forza - began.

In 2011, PJSC &quot;ZAZ&quot; produced 60,862 cars, which is 33.9% more than in 2010 (45,465), with more than 50% of the cars produced for export.

=== ZAZ and its reputation ===
ZAZ&#x27;s products were never held in high esteem by Soviet citizens. In fact, ZAZ&#x27;s original mission was to create a &quot;people&#x27;s car&quot;, almost like Volkswagen&#x27;s initial mission. In May 2009, ZAZ won the international tender for the production of vehicles for veterans and disabled people of Azerbaijan.

<text>Tết (, ), short for  (), is the most important celebration in Vietnamese culture. Tết celebrates the arrival of spring based on the Vietnamese calendar and usually has the date in January or February in the Gregorian calendar.

 is not to be confused with Tết Trung Thu, which is also known as Children&#x27;s Festival in Vietnam. &quot;&quot; itself only means festival but it would generally refer to the Lunar New Year in Vietnamese, as it is often seen as the most important festival amongst the Vietnamese and the Vietnamese diaspora, with regarded as the second-most important.

Vietnamese people celebrate annually, which is based on a lunisolar calendar (calculating both the motions of Earth around the Sun and of the Moon around Earth). Tết is generally celebrated on the same day as Chinese New Year (also called Spring Festival), with the one-hour time difference between Vietnam and China resulting in the new moon occurring on different days. Rarely, the dates of Vietnamese and Chinese Lunar New Year can differ, such as in 1943, when Vietnam celebrated Lunar New Year one month after China. It takes place from the first day of the first month of the Vietnamese lunar calendar (around late January or early February) until at least the third day.

Tết is also an occasion for pilgrims and family reunions. They set aside the trouble of the past year and hope for a better and happier upcoming year. This festival can also be referred to as in vernacular Vietnamese, (from &quot;lễ hội&quot;, &quot;festival&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, &quot;spring&quot;).

==History==
The Lunar Year holiday was originally brought to Vietnam by the Chinese, who had formally incorporated Vietnam into their Han Dynasty empire in 111 BCE and mostly had ruled it for over 1000 years until the collapse of the Tang Dynasty in the 10th century. That historic period of Chinese rule had significantly influenced Vietnamese culture, language, and administration, as Chinese governors had attempted for complete Sinicization. Vietnamese Lunar New Year today still retains a degree of the original Chinese customs such as giving of lucky money in red envelopes and use of the lunar calendar, but has also over time, evolved its own separate and unique traditions that reflect Vietnam&#x27;s distinct culture and identity, which includes the Vietnamese zodiac where the Vietnamese do not use the Ox, Rabbit, and Sheep in the Chinese zodiac but instead replace them with the Buffalo, Cat, and Goat, respectively, as well as traditional Vietnamese dishes.

=== Controversies ===
Most information sources state that Tết originated from the period of Chinese domination. However according to the official online newspaper of the Vietnamese government, some historical materials suggest otherwise. Tết&#x27;s origins have been a subject of scholarly research for many generations.

According to researcher Toan Anh, Tết Nguyên Đán is considered the first festival of the new year, beginning at midnight with the ceremony. The ceremony usually takes place between the hour of the Pig on the 30th day or, if it is a short month, on the 29th day of the 12th lunar month, and the hour of the Rat on the 1st day of the first lunar month.

Researcher Phan Cẩm Thượng, in his book &quot;Customs of Human Life&quot;, explains that the Vietnamese use the agricultural calendar or lunar calendar, which is based on the moon&#x27;s rotation around the earth but also accounts for the 24 solar terms of the earth with the sun, including the four key points of the spring equinox, autumnal equinox, winter solstice, and summer solstice. Tết begins on the first day of lunar January, marking the start of a new year and a new farming cycle.

Historian Trần Văn Giáp asserts that there are many ways to divide time into months and years. From the beginning, each ethnic group had its own way of dividing months and years. According to Trần&#x27;s research, Tết Nguyên Đán in Vietnam dates back to the first century AD. The origin and meaning of Tết Nguyên Đán have been prevalent since then.

According to the legend of Bánh chưng Bánh giầy, the Vietnamese have celebrated Tết since before the time of the Hùng kings. The legend of Lang Lieu and Bánh chưng also suggests that Tết existed over a thousand years before the period of Chinese domination.

==Name==
The name is a shortening of , literally written as (meaning &#x27;festivals&#x27;; only used in festival names) and which means the first day of the year. Both terms come from Sino-Vietnamese, respectively, (SV: ) and .

The word for festival is usually , another Sino-Vietnamese term: .

==Customs==

Vietnamese people usually return to their families during Tết. Some return to worship at the family altar or visit the graves of their ancestors in their homeland. They also clear up the graves of their families as a sign of respect. Although Tết is a national holiday among all Vietnamese, each region and religion has its own customs.

Many Vietnamese prepare for Tết by cooking special holiday food and doing house cleaning. These foods include , , , , , dried young bamboo soup (), , and xôi (sticky rice). Many customs and traditions are practiced during Tết, such as visiting a person&#x27;s house on the first day of the new year (), ancestor veneration, exchanging New Year&#x27;s greetings, giving lucky money to children and elderly people, opening a shop, visiting relatives, friends, and neighbors.

Tết can be divided into three time periods, tất niên (celebrations before the end of the year), giao thừa (New Year&#x27;s Eve), and năm mới (the New Year), representing the preparation before Tết, the eve of Tết, and the days of and following Tết, respectively. 

===New Year in Tết===
The first day of Tết is reserved for the nuclear family. Children receive red envelopes containing money from their elders. This tradition is called &quot;mừng tuổi&quot; (happy age) in the North region and lì xì in the South region. Usually, children wear their new clothes and give their elders the traditional Tết greetings before receiving money. Wearing red clothing during Tết is common as it is associated with good luck. Since the Vietnamese believe that the first visitor who a family receives in the year determines their fortune for the entire year, people never enter any house on the first day without being invited first. The verb of being the first person to enter a house at Tết is xông đất, xông nhà, or đạp đất, which is one of the most important customs during Tết. According to Vietnamese tradition, if good things come to a family on the first day of the lunar New Year, the entire following year will also be full of blessings. Usually, a person of good temper, morality, and success will be a lucky sign for the host family and be first invited into his house. However, just to be safe, the owner of the house will leave the house a few minutes before midnight and come back just as the clock strikes midnight to prevent anyone else from entering the house first who might potentially bring any unfortunate events in the new year to the household. This is a common practice done by many families. 

Sweeping during Tết is taboo, it is xui or rủi (unlucky), since it symbolizes sweeping the luck away; that is why they clean before the new year. It is also taboo for anyone who experienced a recent loss of a family member to visit anyone else during Tết. 

It is important to retain harmony within the household during the first three days of Tết. Engaging in conflict, arguments, or exhibiting any feelings of anger and hatred may bring upon bad luck for the upcoming year. 

During subsequent days, people visit relatives and friends. Traditionally but not strictly, the second day of Tết is usually reserved for friends, while the third day is for teachers, who command respect in Vietnam. Students in Vietnam are usually given a one-week long break from school to celebrate Tết. Local Buddhist temples are popular spots because people like to give donations and get their fortunes told during Tết. Children are free to spend their new money on toys or on gambling games such as &quot;bầu cua cá cọp&quot;, which can be found in the streets. Prosperous families can pay for dragon dancers to perform at their house. Also, public performances are given for everyone to watch.

===Traditional celebrations===
These celebrations can last from a day up to the entire week, and the New Year is filled with people in the streets trying to make as much noise as possible using firecrackers, drums, bells, gongs, and anything they can think of to ward off evil spirits. This parade will also include different masks and dancers hidden under the guise of what is known as the &quot;múa lân &quot;or lion dancing. The &quot;lân&quot; is an animal between a lion and a dragon and is the symbol of strength in the Vietnamese culture that is used to scare away evil spirits. After the parade, families, and friends come together to have a feast of traditional Vietnamese dishes and share the happiness and joy of the New Year with one another. This is also the time when the elders will hand out red envelopes with money to the children for good luck in exchange for Tết greetings. 

It is also a tradition to pay off debts before the Vietnamese New Year for some Vietnamese families.

===Decorations===
Traditionally, each family displays &quot;cây nêu&quot;, an artificial New Year tree consisting of a bamboo pole long. The top end is usually decorated with many objects, depending on the locality, including good luck charms, origami fish, cactus branches, and more. 

At Tết, every house is usually decorated by Yellow Apricot blossoms (&quot;hoa mai&quot;) in the central and southern parts of Vietnam, peach blossoms (&quot;hoa đào&quot;) in the northern part of Vietnam, or St. John&#x27;s wort (&quot;hoa ban&quot;) in the mountain areas. In the north, some people (especially the elite in the past) also decorate their house with plum blossoms (also called &quot;hoa mơ&quot; in Vietnamese but referring to a totally different species from mickey-mouse blossoms). In the north or central, the kumquat tree is a popular decoration for the living room during Tết. Its many fruits symbolize fertility and fruitfulness which the family hopes in the coming year. 

Vietnamese people also decorate their homes with Hòn non bộ and flowers such as chrysanthemums (&quot;hoa cúc&quot;), marigolds (&quot;vạn thọ&quot;) symbolizing longevity, cockscombs (&quot;mào gà&quot;) in southern Vietnam, and paperwhites (&quot;thủy tiên&quot;) and orchids (&quot;hoa lan&quot;) in northern Vietnam. In the past, there was a tradition where people tried to make their paperwhites bloom on the day of the observance. 

They also hung up Đông Hồ paintings and thư pháp calligraphy pictures. 

==Greetings==

The traditional greetings are &quot;&quot;Chúc Mừng Năm Mới&quot; (祝𢜠𢆥㵋, Happy New Year) and &quot;Cung Chúc Tân Xuân&quot;&quot;, (恭祝新春, gracious wishes of the new spring). People also wish each other prosperity and luck. Common wishes for Tết include the following:

*&quot;Sống lâu trăm tuổi&quot;: (𤯩𥹰𤾓歲, Live long for a hundred years!): used by children for elders. Traditionally, everyone is considered one year older on Tết, so children would wish their grandparents&#x27; health and longevity in exchange for &quot;mừng tuổi&quot; (𢜠歲) or &quot;lì xì&quot; (利市 &quot;SV: lợi thị&quot;).
*&quot;An khang thịnh vượng&quot;: (安康盛旺, Security, good health, and prosperity)
*&quot;Vạn sự như ý&quot;: (萬事如意, May things go your way)
*&quot;Sức khỏe dồi dào&quot;: (飭劸洡𤁠, Plenty of health!)
*&quot;Làm ăn tấn tới&quot;: (爫咹晉𬧐, Be successful at work!)
*&quot;Tiền vô như nước:&quot; (錢𠓺如渃, May money flow in like water!). Used informally.
*&quot;Cung hỉ phát tài&quot;: (恭喜發財, Congratulations and best wishes for a prosperous New Year!)
*&quot;Năm mới thắng lợi mới&quot;: (𢆥㵋勝利㵋, New year, new triumphs!; often heard in political speeches)
*&quot;Chúc hay ăn chóng lớn&quot;: (祝𫨩咹𢶢𡘯, Eat well, grow quick!; aimed at children)
*&quot;Năm mới thăng quan tiến chức&quot;: (𢆥㵋陞官進織, I wish for you to be promoted in the new year!)
*&quot;Năm mới toàn gia bình an&quot;: (𢆥㵋全家平安, I wish that the new year will bring health and peace to your family!)
*&quot;Mừng xuân Di-lặc:&quot; (𢜠春彌勒, Happy Spring of Maitreya!). Used by Buddhists.
*&quot;Mừng xuân an lạc:&quot; (𢜠春安樂, Happy peaceful joyful spring!). Used by Buddhists.
*&quot;Chúc mừng Chúa Xuân:&quot; (祝𢜠主春, Praise the Lord of Spring!). Used by Catholics.
==Food==

In the Vietnamese language, to celebrate Tết is to &quot;ăn Tết&quot;, literally meaning &quot;eat Tết&quot;, showing the importance of food in its celebration. Some of the food is also eaten year-round, while other dishes are only eaten during Tết. Also, some of the food is vegetarian since it is believed to be good luck to eat vegetarian on Tết. Some traditional foods on Tết include the following:
* &quot;Bánh chưng&quot; and &quot;bánh tét&quot;: essentially tightly packed sticky rice with meat or bean fillings wrapped in &quot;dong&quot; leaves (&quot;Phrynium placentarium&quot;). When these leaves are unavailable, banana leaves can be used as a substitute. One difference between them is their shape. &quot;Bánh chưng&quot; is the square-shaped one to represent the Earth, while &quot;bánh tét&quot; is cylindrical to represent the moon. Also, &quot;bánh chưng&quot; is more popular in the northern parts of Vietnam, &quot;bánh tét&quot; is more popular in the south. Preparation can take days. After molding them into their respective shapes (the square shape is achieved using a wooden frame), they are boiled for several hours to cook. The story of their origins and their connection with Tết is often recounted to children while cooking them overnight.
* &quot;Mứt&quot;: These dried candied fruits are rarely eaten at any time besides Tết.
* &quot;Kẹo dừa&quot;: coconut candy
* &quot;Kẹo mè xửng&quot;: peanut brittle with sesame seeds or peanuts
* &quot;Cầu sung dừa đủ xoài&quot;: In southern Vietnam, popular fruits used for offerings at the family altar in fruit arranging art are the custard-apple/sugar-apple/soursop (&quot;mãng cầu&quot;), coconut (&quot;dừa&quot;), goolar fig (&quot;sung&quot;), papaya (&quot;đu đủ&quot;), and mango (&quot;xoài&quot;), since they sound like &quot;cầu sung vừa đủ xài&quot; ([We] pray for enough [money/resources/funds/goods/etc.] to use) in the southern dialect of Vietnamese.
* &quot;Thịt kho nước dừa:&quot; Meaning &quot;meat stewed in coconut juice&quot;, is a traditional dish of pork belly and medium boiled eggs stewed in a broth-like sauce made overnight of young coconut juice and &quot;nước mắm&quot;. It is often eaten with pickled bean sprouts and chives, and white rice.
* &quot;Xôi gấc&quot;: a red sticky rice made from gac fruit, typically paired with chả lụa (the most common type of sausage in Vietnamese cuisine, made of pork and traditionally wrapped in banana leaves).

==Forms of entertainment==

People enjoy traditional games during Tết, including &quot;bầu cua cá cọp&quot;, &quot;cờ tướng&quot;, &quot;ném còn&quot;, &quot;chọi trâu&quot;, and &quot;đá gà&quot;. They also participate in some competitions presenting their knowledge, strength, and aestheticism, such as the bird competition and &quot;ngâm thơ&quot; competition.

Fireworks displays have also become a traditional part of a Tết celebration in Vietnam. During New Year&#x27;s Eve, fireworks displays at major cities, such as Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, and Da Nang, are broadcast through multiple national and local TV channels, accompanied by New Year wishes of the incumbent president. In 2017 only, fireworks displays were prohibited due to political and financial reasons. In 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, most provinces and cities canceled the fireworks displays; instead, the displays were only held in Hanoi and several provinces with public gatherings prohibited. In 2022, due to the aforementioned pandemic, all provinces canceled the firework displays due to financial reasons. In Australia, Canada &amp; the United States, there are fireworks displays at many of its festivals, although in 2021 they were either held virtually or canceled. In the United States, a popular show that many individuals engage in is Paris by Night.

&quot;Gặp nhau cuối năm&quot; (&quot;Year-end meet&quot;) is a nationally known satirical theatrical comedy show, broadcast on VTV on New Year&#x27;s Eve.

==Dates in the Vietnamese calendar==
From 2020 to 2043.

==Music==
In the weeks leading up to Tết, celebratory songs are played throughout Vietnam. One song, Ngày Tết Quê Em (Tết in My Homeland) was released by Linh Trang and Xuan Mai in 2006. It was on the album Xuân Mai và Thiếu Nhi Cali 2 Hội chợ Cali. The song can be heard playing in many public places across the country.

The song summarizes some of the main Tết traditions. During Tết, it is traditional for Vietnamese people to travel to their hometowns, hence the lyrics &quot;People traveling here and there.&quot; 

Typically, there are large fireworks displays in most major cities. Prior to 1995, it was customary to use firecrackers at individual homes; however, the government banned the production and use of these fireworks due to fatal accidents. In December 2020 a regulation was passed that allows &quot;anyone aged 18 and older with legal capacity&quot; to purchase sparklers for special occasions. The regulations went into effect on January 11, 2020.

While the song is not inherently religious, it does reference pagodas, a tiered tower used by Buddhists and Taoists for worship. Many Buddhist altars are set up in the weeks leading up to Tet. 

The line &quot;If you&#x27;re a farmer, you&#x27;ll gain more&quot; refers to beliefs held by many Vietnamese people about the effects the new year will bring on agriculture. Tet symbolizes the start of the spring season. Farmers traditionally use this time as an opportunity to remember the gods of harvest. The next line, &quot;If you&#x27;re dealers, you&#x27;ll earn more&quot; refers to the amount of work retailers do in order to be prepared for the surge of shopping in preparation for the holiday.

<doc id="69162" wikidata="Q44826" url="?curid=69162" title="Tarshish">
<text>Tarshish (; ; ) occurs in the Hebrew Bible with several uncertain meanings, most frequently as a place (probably a large city or region) far across the sea from Phoenicia (now Lebanon) and the Land of Israel. Tarshish was said to have exported vast quantities of important metals to Phoenicia and Israel. The same place name occurs in the Akkadian inscriptions of the Neo-Assyrian emperor Esarhaddon (died 669 BC) and also on the Phoenician inscription of the Nora Stone (around 800 BCE) in Sardinia; its precise location was never commonly known, and was eventually lost in antiquity. Legends grew up around it over time, so its identity has been the subject of scholarly research and commentary for more than two thousand years.

Its importance stems in part from the fact that Hebrew biblical passages tend to understand Tarshish as a source of King Solomon&#x27;s tremendous wealth in metals – especially silver, but also gold, tin, and iron according to Ezekiel 27. The metals were reportedly obtained in partnership with the Phoenician king Hiram I of Tyre and fleets of ships from Tarshish, according to Isaiah 23.

Tarshish is also the name of a modern village in the Mount Lebanon Governorate, Lebanon, and Tharsis, Huelva is a village in Andalusia, Spain.

According to the Jewish Encyclopedia &quot;&quot;, the biblical phrase &quot;ships of Tarshish&quot; refers not to ships from a particular location, but to a class of ships: large vessels for long-distance trade.

==Hebrew Bible==
&quot;Tarshish&quot; occurs 25 times in the Masoretic text of the Hebrew Bible. Although, as stated in the previous section, the phrase &quot;ships of Tarshish&quot; may refer only to huge ships fit for ocean journeys and not to a location or nation, possible references to Tarshish as a location or nation include:

* In Tarshish appears among the Sons of Noah: &quot;And the sons of Javan [were:] Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.&quot; This is closely restated in 1 Chronicles 1:7. The next passage details that these offspring have dispersed numerous peoples throughout the &quot;archipelago&quot;, each with a distinct language, lineage, and culture.
* notes that King Solomon had &quot;a fleet of ships of Tarshish&quot; at sea with the fleet of his ally King Hiram of Tyre: &quot;Once every three years the fleet of ships of Tarshish used to come bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.&quot; This is echoed (with some notable changes) in .
* states that &quot;Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold, but they did not go, for the ships were wrecked at Ezion-geber.&quot; This is repeated in , preceded by the information that the ships were built at Ezion-Geber, and emphasizing the prophecy of Eliezer son of Dodavahu of Mareshah against Jehoshaphat: &quot;Because you have joined with Ahaziah, the Lord will destroy what you have made.&quot; And the ships were wrecked and were not able to go to Tarshish. This may be referenced in : &quot;By the east wind you shattered the ships of Tarshish.&quot; From these verses, commentators conclude that &quot;ships of Tarshish&quot; was used to denote any large trading ships intended for long voyages, whatever their destination, and some Bible translations, including the NIV, go as far as to translate the phrase &quot;ship(s) of Tarshish&quot; as &quot;trading ship(s).&quot; 
* , often interpreted as Messianic in Jewish and Christian tradition, has &quot;May the kings of Tarshish and of the coastlands render him tribute; may the kings of Sheba and Seba bring gifts!&quot; This verse is the source text of the liturgical antiphon &quot;Reges Tharsis&quot; in Christian Cathedral music. In this Psalm, the &#x27;chain of scaled correlates&#x27; consisting of &#x27;mountains and hills&#x27;, &#x27;rain and showers&#x27;, &#x27;seas and river&#x27; leads up to the phrase &#x27;Tarshish and islands&#x27;, indicating that Tarshish was a large island. 
* Isaiah contains three prophecies mentioning Tarshish. First, at 2:16 &quot;against all the ships of Tarshish, and against all the beautiful craft,&quot; then Tarshish is mentioned at length in Chapter 23 against Tyre: &quot;Wail, O ships of Tarshish, for Tyre is laid waste, without house or harbor!&quot; (23:1 and 23:14) and &quot;Cross over to Tarshish; wail, O inhabitants of the coast!&quot; (23:6). In 23:10, Tyre is identified as a &quot;daughter of Tarshish&quot;. These prophecies are reversed in Isaiah 60:9: &quot;For the coastlands shall hope for me, the ships of Tarshish first, to bring your children from afar&quot;; and 66:19: &quot;and I will set a sign among them. And from them I will send survivors to the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, who draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan, to the coastlands far away, that have not heard my fame or seen my glory. And they shall declare my glory among the nations.&quot;
* Jeremiah only mentions Tarshish in passing as a source of silver: &quot;Beaten silver is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz&quot; (10:9).
* Ezekiel describes Tyre&#x27;s trading relations with Tarshish: &quot;Tarshish did business with you because of your great wealth of every kind; silver, iron, tin, and lead they exchanged for your wares&quot; () and &quot;The ships of Tarshish traveled for you with your merchandise. So you were filled and heavily laden in the heart of the seas&quot; (). The metals from Tarshish were stored in Tyre and resold, probably to Mesopotamia. In the prophecy against Gog, Ezekiel predicts: &quot;Sheba and Dedan and the merchants of Tarshish and all its leaders will say to you, &#x27;Have you come to seize spoil? Have you assembled your hosts to carry off plunder, to carry away silver and gold, to take away livestock and goods, to seize great spoil? ()
* and 4:2 mention Tarshish as a distant place: &quot;But Jonah rose to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the Lord. He went down to Jaffa and found a ship going to Tarshish.&quot; Jonah&#x27;s fleeing to Tarshish may need to be taken as &quot;a place very far away&quot; rather than a precise geographical term. On the Mediterranean Sea, ships that used only sails were often left stranded without wind, while ships with oars could continue their voyage.

==Other ancient and classical-era sources==
* Esarhaddon, Aššur Babylon E (AsBbE) preserves &quot;All the kings from the lands surrounded by sea – from the country Iadanana (Cyprus) and Iaman, as far as Tarsisi (Tarshish) – bowed to my feet.&quot; Here, Tarshish is certainly a large island, and cannot be confused with Tarsus (Thompson and Skaggs 2013).
* Flavius Josephus (1st century) reads &quot;Tarshush&quot;, identifying it as the city of Tarsus in southern Asia Minor, which some have later equated with the Tarsisi mentioned in Assyrian records from the reign of Esarhaddon. Phoenician inscriptions were found at Karatepe in Cilicia. Bunsen and Sayce have seemed to agree with Josephus, but the Phoenicians were active in many regions where metals were available, and classical authors, some biblical authors, and certainly the Nora Stone that mentions Tarshish generally place Phoenician expansion aimed at metals-acquisition in West of the Mediterranean.
* The Septuagint and the Vulgate in several passages translate it with Carthage, apparently following a Jewish tradition found in the Targum of Jonathan (&quot;Afriki&quot;, i.e., Carthage).

==Identifications and interpretations==
Tarshish is placed on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea by several biblical passages, and more precisely: west of Israel. It is described as a source of various metals: &quot;beaten silver is brought from Tarshish&quot; (Jeremiah 10:9), and the Phoenicians of Tyre brought from there silver, iron, tin and lead (Ezekiel 27:12).

The context in Isaiah 23:6 and 66:19 seems to indicate that it is an island, and from Israel it could be reached by ship, as attempted by Jonah (Jonah 1:3) and performed by Solomon&#x27;s fleet (2 Chronicles 9:21). Some modern scholars identify Tarshish with Tartessos, a port in southern Spain, described by classical authors as a source of metals for the Phoenicians, while Josephus&#x27; identification of Tarshish with the city of Tarsus in Cilicia (south-central Turkey) is even more widely accepted. However, a clear identification is not possible, since a whole array of Mediterranean sites with similar names are connected to the mining of various metals.

===Mediterranean Sea===
According to Rashi, a medieval rabbi and commentator of the Bible, quoting Tractate Hullin 9lb, &#x27;tarshish&#x27; means the Mediterranean Sea.

===Carthage===
The Targum of Jonathan along with several passages of the Septuagint and the Vulgate render Tarshish as Carthage. The Jewish-Portuguese scholar, politician, statesman and financier Isaac Abarbanel (1437–1508 AD) described Tarshish as &quot;the city known in earlier times as Carthage and today called Tunis.&quot;

===Sardinia===
Thompson and Skaggs argue that the Akkadian inscriptions of Esarhaddon (AsBbE) indicate that Tarshish was an island (not a coastland) far to the west of the Levant. In 2003, Christine Marie Thompson identified the Cisjordan Corpus, a concentration of hacksilver hoards in Israel and Palestine (Cisjordan). This Corpus dates between 1200 and 586 BC, and the hoards in it are all silver-dominant. The largest hoard was found at Eshtemo&#x27;a, present-day as-Samu, and contained 26 kg of silver. Within it, and specifically in the geographical region that was part of Phoenicia, is a concentration of hoards dated between 1200 and 800 BC. There is no other known such concentration of silver hoards in the contemporary Mediterranean, and its date-range overlaps with the reigns of King Solomon (990–931 BC) and Hiram of Tyre (980–947 BC).

American scholars William F. Albright (1891–1971) and Frank Moore Cross (1921–2012) suggested Tarshish was Sardinia because of the discovery of the Nora Stone, whose Phoenician inscription mentions Tarshish. Cross read the inscription to understand that it was referring to Tarshish as Sardinia. Recent research into hacksilver hoards has also suggested Sardinia.

Hacksilver objects in these Phoenician hoards have lead isotope ratios that match ores in the silver-producing regions of Sardinia and Spain, only one of which is a large island rich in silver. Contrary to translations that have been rendering Assyrian &quot;tar-si-si&quot; as &#x27;Tarsus&#x27; up to the present time, Thompson argues that the Assyrian tablets inscribed in Akkadian indicate &quot;tar-si-si&quot; (Tarshish) was a large island in the western Mediterranean, and that the poetic construction of Psalm 72:10 also shows that it was a large island to the very distant west of Phoenicia. The island of Sardinia was always known as a hub of the metals trade in antiquity, and was also called by the ancient Greeks as &quot;Argyróphleps nésos&quot; &quot;island of the silver veins&quot;.

The same evidence from hacksilver is said to fit with what the ancient Greek and Roman authors recorded about the Phoenicians exploiting many sources of silver in the western Mediterranean to feed developing economies back in Israel and Phoenicia soon after the fall of Troy and other palace centers in the eastern Mediterranean around 1200 BC. Classical sources starting with Homer (8th century BC), and the Greek historians Herodotus (484–425 BC) and Diodorus Siculus (d. 30 BC) said the Phoenicians were exploiting the metals of the west for these purposes before they set up the permanent colonies in the metal-rich regions of the Mediterranean and Atlantic.

===Either Sardinia or Spain===
The editors of the &quot;New Oxford Annotated Bible&quot;, first published in 1962, suggest that Tarshish is either Sardinia or Tartessos.

===Spain===
Rufus Festus Avienus the Latin writer of the 4th century AD, identified Tarshish as Cadiz. This is the theory espoused by Father Mapple in Chapter 9 of &quot;Moby Dick&quot;.

Some biblical commentators as early as 1646 (Samuel Bochart) read it as Tartessos in ancient Hispania (the Iberian Peninsula), near Huelva and Sevilla today. Bochart, the 17th century French Protestant pastor, suggested in his &quot;Phaleg&quot; (1646) that Tarshish was the city of Tartessos in southern Spain. He was followed by others, including Hertz (1936).

===Phoenician coast===
Sir Peter le Page Renouf (1822–1897) thought that &quot;Tarshish&quot; meant a coast, and, as the word occurs frequently in connection with Tyre, the Phoenician coast is to be understood.

===Tyrsenians or Etruscans===
T. K. Cheyne (1841–1915) thought that &quot;Tarshish&quot; of and &quot;Tiras&quot; of are really two names of one nation derived from two different sources, and might indicate the Tyrsenians or Etruscans.

===Britain===
Some 19th-century commentators believed that Tarshish was Britain, including Alfred John Dunkin who said &quot;Tarshish demonstrated to be Britain&quot; (1844), George Smith (1850), James Wallis and David King&#x27;s &quot;The British Millennial Harbinger&quot; (1861), John Algernon Clarke (1862), and Jonathan Perkins Weethee of Ohio (1887). This idea stems from the fact that Tarshish is recorded to have been a trader in tin, silver, gold, and lead, all of which were mined in Cornwall. This is still reputed to be the &quot;Merchants of Tarshish&quot; today by some Christian sects.

===Southeast Africa===
Augustus Henry Keane (1833–1912) believed that Tarshish was Sofala, and that the biblical land of Havilah was centered on the nearby Great Zimbabwe.

===Southern India and Sri Lanka ===
Bochart, apart from Spain (see there), also suggested eastern localities for the ports of Ophir and Tarshish during King Solomon&#x27;s reign, specifically the Tamilakkam continent (present day South India and Northern Ceylon) where the Dravidians were well known for their gold, pearls, ivory and peacock trade. He fixed on &quot;Tarshish&quot; being the site of Kudiramalai, a possible corruption of Thiruketheeswaram.

===Cilicia===
It may, however, refer to Tarsus in Cilicia, where Saul, later Paul, hailed from (Acts 9:11, 21:39, 22:3).

===Tarxien===
There are several indications that Tarshish could have been located at Malta, where still today a local council is called Tarxien. The pronunciation in the Semitic language of the Maltese people is rather similar to the Hebrew pronunciation of Tarshish (). All megalithic temples from the Neolithic epoch of Malta are assigned to the Tarxien phase of the island. The inhabitants claim that Tarxien was founded by the Carthaginians.

==Controversy==
The existence of Tarshish in the western Mediterranean, along with any Phoenician presence in the western Mediterranean before c. 800 BC, has been questioned by some scholars in modern times, because there is no direct evidence. Instead, the lack of evidence for wealth in Israel and Phoenicia during the reigns of Solomon and Hiram, respectively, prompted a few scholars to opine that the archaeological period in Mediterranean prehistory between 1200 and 800 BC was a &#x27;Dark Age&#x27;.

==Other usage==
* The Hebrew term has a homonym, &quot;tarshish&quot;, occurring seven times and translated beryl in older English versions. According to , it is one of the precious stones set into the priestly breastplate (&quot;the fourth row [shall be] a beryl [tarshish], and . . .&quot;). It is associated with the Tribe of Asher, and has been identified by the Septuagint and Josephus as the &quot;gold stone&quot; χρυσόλιθος (whose identification remains in dispute, possibly topaz, probably not modern chrysolite), and later as aquamarine.
* , part of a genealogy, mentions in passing a Jewish man named Tarshish, son of Bilhan.

<text>The Segre ( ; ) is a river tributary to the Ebro (&quot;Ebre&quot; in Catalan) with a basin comprising territories across three states: France, Andorra, and Spain.

The river Segre, known to Romans and Greeks as Sicoris, and to the Arabs of Al-Andalus as Nahr az-Zaytūn (نهر الزيتون, river of Olives) has its sources on the north face of the Pic del Segre or &quot;Puigmal de Segre&quot; (&quot;Segre&#x27;s Peak&quot;) in the French department Pyrénées-Orientales (historically the &quot;comarca&quot; of Alta Cerdanya), in the Catalan Pyrenees. It follows a western direction all along the Cerdanya (&quot;Cerdagne&quot;) Valley, and crosses the town Saillagouse, the Spanish exclave Llívia, and Bourg-Madame.

It enters Spain at Puigcerdà and continues west until La Seu d&#x27;Urgell, where it meets the Valira River coming from Andorra. From this point, it adopts a south-western course across the pre-Pyrenees (with several dams along its gorges) and the western plains of Catalonia. It passes through Balaguer, Lleida, and flows into the Ebro at Mequinenza.

Among its tributaries: Valira (from Andorra), Noguera Pallaresa, Noguera Ribagorzana, and Cinca.

==In Lleida==
The river Segre is an essential feature of the Lleida&#x27;s geography, dividing the city in two. During the city&#x27;s history, several floods have occurred, the last in the late 1970s. There is also a dam on the river, near the natural park La Mitjana. Another park, Els Camps Elisis, is adjacent to the Segre.

Many bridges span the river in the city of Lleida, namely: Pont Vell, Pont del Ferrocarril, Pont Nou, Pont de la Universitat, Pont de Pardinyes, Pont de Príncep de Viana, Passarel·la de Rufea, Passarel·la dels Maristes, Passarel·la d&#x27;Onze de Setembre, Passarel·la de Pardinyes, and Passarel·la del Liceu Escolar.

<text>Symbian Ltd. was a software development and licensing consortium company, known for the Symbian operating system (OS), for smartphones and some related devices. Its headquarters were in Southwark, London, England, with other offices opened in Cambridge, Sweden, Silicon Valley, Japan, India, China, South Korea, and Australia.

It was established on 24 June 1998 as a partnership between Psion, Nokia, Ericsson, Motorola, and Sony, to exploit the convergence between personal digital assistants (PDAs) and mobile phones, and a joint-effort to prevent Microsoft from extending its desktop computer monopoly into the mobile devices market. Ten years to the day after it was established, on 24 June 2008, Nokia announced that they intended to acquire the shares that they did not own already, at a cost of €264 million. On the same day the Symbian Foundation was announced, with the aim to &quot;provide royalty-free software and accelerate innovation&quot;, and the pledged contribution of the Symbian OS and user interfaces.

The acquisition of Symbian Ltd. by Nokia was completed on 2 December 2008, at which point all Symbian employees became Nokia employees. Transfer of relevant Symbian Software Ltd. leases, trademarks, and domain names from Nokia to the Symbian Foundation was completed in April 2009. On 18 July 2009, Nokia&#x27;s Symbian professional services department, which was not transferred to the Symbian Foundation, was sold to the Accenture consulting company.

==Overview==

Symbian Ltd. was the brainchild of Psion&#x27;s next generation mobile operating system project following the 32-bit version of EPOC. Psion approached the other four companies and decided to work together on a full software suite including kernel, device drivers, and user interface. Much of Symbian&#x27;s initial intellectual property came from the software arm of Psion.

Symbian Ltd developed and licensed Symbian OS, an operating system for advanced mobile phones and personal digital assistants (PDAs).

Symbian Ltd wanted the system to have different user interface layers, unlike Microsoft&#x27;s offerings. Psion originally created several interfaces or &quot;reference designs&quot;, which would later end up as Pearl (smartphone), Quartz (Palm-like PDA), and Crystal (clamshell design PDA). One early design called Emerald also ended up in the market on the Ericsson R380.

Nokia created the Series 60 (from Pearl), Series 80 and Series 90 platforms (both from Crystal), whilst UIQ Technology, which was a subsidiary of Symbian Ltd. at the time, created UIQ (from Quartz). Another interface was MOAP(S) from NTT Docomo. Despite being partners at Symbian Ltd, the different backers of each interface were effectively competing with each other&#x27;s software. This became a prominent point in February 2004 when UIQ, which focuses on pen devices, announced its foray in traditional keyboard devices, competing head-on with Nokia&#x27;s Series 60 offering whilst Nokia was in the process of acquiring Psion&#x27;s remaining stake in Symbian Ltd. to take overall control of the company.

==Shareholding==
The company&#x27;s founder shareholders were Psion, Nokia and Ericsson. Motorola joined the Symbian consortium shortly later, gaining the same 23.1% stake as Nokia and Ericsson in October 1998. Matsushita followed in May 1999 paying £22 million for an 8.8% stake. This was followed by Siemens taking 5% in April 2002 and Samsung also taking 5% in February 2003.

Motorola sold its stake in the company to Psion and Nokia in September 2003.

In February 2004, Psion, the originator of Symbian, intended to sell its 31.1% stake in the company to Nokia. This caused unease amongst other shareholders as Nokia would gain majority control of the company, with Sony Ericsson in particular being a vocal critic. The deal finalised with the stake shared between Nokia, Matsushita, Siemens and Sony Ericsson in July 2004, with Nokia holding a 47.9% share.

== Decline ==
The decline of Symbian Ltd. has been tied to Nokia&#x27;s fate. By 2007, it enjoyed a high level of success with its operating system running one of every two mobile phones bearing the Nokia logo so that it claimed 65 percent of the mobile market. Its Symbian OS continued to dominate the market until Nokia acquired the company in its entirety in 2008, creating it as an independent non-profit organization called Symbian Foundation. Nokia donated the assets of Symbian Ltd. as well as the Nokia&#x27;s S60 platform to the new entity with the goal of developing an open-source and royalty-free mobile platform.

Nokia, however, began to lose its market share with the emergence of Apple&#x27;s iPhone and Google&#x27;s Android. To address this, Nokia abandoned the Symbian OS in favor of Windows Phone OS for its mobile devices, shipping its last Symbian handset in 2013. Having lost its biggest supporter and caretaker, Symbian was absorbed by Accenture, which is supposed to maintain it until 2016. The prior Symbian Foundation has transitioned into a licensing entity with no permanent staff, claiming on its website that it is responsible for only specific licensing and legal frameworks put in place during the open sourcing of the platform.

==Licensees==
Licensees of Symbian&#x27;s operating system were:
Arima, BenQ, Fujitsu, Lenovo, Matsushita, Motorola, Nokia, Samsung, Sharp, Siemens and Sony Mobile.

==Key people==
Symbian Ltd&#x27;s CEO at the time of acquisition was Nigel Clifford. Prior CEOs included David Levin, who left in 2005 to head United Business Media, and the founding CEO, Colly Myers, who left the company in 2002 to found IssueBits, the company behind text messaging Short Message Service (SMS) information service Any Question Answered (AQA).

<text>Charles William Paddock (August 11, 1900 – July 21, 1943) was an American athlete and two-time Olympic champion.

==Biography==
Paddock was born in Gainesville, Texas, to Charles H. and Lulu (Robinson) Paddock. His family moved to Pasadena, California, when he was a child. After serving in World War I as a lieutenant of field artillery in the U.S. Marines, Paddock studied at the University of Southern California. There he became a member of the track and field team, and excelled in the sprint events. He won the 100 and 200 m in the first major sporting event after the war, the 1919 Inter-Allied Games, in which soldiers of the Allied nations competed against each other. Paddock was the first person named &quot;The fastest man alive&quot;.

In 1920, Paddock represented his country at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp. In Belgium, he had his greatest successes, winning the 100 m final, while placing second in the 200 m event. With the American 4 × 100 m relay team, Paddock won a third Olympic medal. Paddock became famous for his unusual finishing style, leaping towards the finish line at the end of the race.

The next year, he ran the 110 yd, which is slightly more than 100 m, in 10.2 seconds. It was not until 1956 that the world record for the 100 m became lower than Paddock&#x27;s time over 110 yard. Paddock broke or equaled several other world records over Imperial distances.

At the 1924 Olympics, Paddock again qualified for both the 100 and 200 m finals, but he was less successful than four years earlier; he finished 5th in the 100 m and won another silver medal in the 200 m. Paddock was not a part of the American relay team. In &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;, the 1981 Oscar-winning film about those races, Paddock was portrayed by Dennis Christopher. In 1928, Paddock participated in his third Olympics, but did not reach the 200 m final.

During his athletic activities, Paddock also held management positions in several newspapers; his father-in-law was newspaper publisher Charles H. Prisk. In 1926, Paddock appeared in &quot;The Campus Flirt&quot;, a black-and-white silent film (now lost) featuring another Texas native, Paramount starlet Bebe Daniels. Paddock served on the personal staff of Major General William P. Upshur beginning at the end of World War I. An autobiography, entitled &quot;The Fastest Human&quot;, was published in 1932.

In 1943, during World War II, Upshur and Paddock (by then a captain) died in a plane crash near Sitka, Alaska. Paddock is interred at Sitka National Cemetery in Sitka.

In 1976 he was inducted into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame.

<text>Alastair Preston Reynolds (born 13 March 1966) is a Welsh science fiction author. He specialises in hard science fiction and space opera.

==Early life==
Reynolds was born in Wales and spent his early years in Cornwall before moving back to Wales, and later attended Newcastle University, where he studied physics and astronomy. He subsequently earned a PhD in astrophysics from the University of St Andrews.

==Career==
Reynolds wrote his first four published science fiction short stories while still a graduate student, in 1989–1991; they appeared in 1990–1992, his first sale being to &quot;Interzone&quot;. In 1991 Reynolds graduated and moved from Scotland to the Netherlands to work at ESA. He then started spending much of his writing time on a first novel, which eventually turned into &quot;Revelation Space&quot;, while the few short stories he submitted from 1991–1995 were rejected. This ended in 1995 when his story &quot;Byrd Land Six&quot; was published, which he says marked the beginning of a more serious phase of writing. he has published over forty shorter works and nine novels. His works are hard science fiction, typically in the sub-genres of space opera and noir, and reflect his professional expertise with physics and astronomy, included by extrapolating future technologies in terms that are consistent, for the most part, with current science. Reynolds has said he prefers to keep the science in his books to what he personally believes will be possible, and he does not believe faster-than-light travel will ever be possible, but that he adopts science he believes will be impossible when it is necessary for the story. Most of Reynolds&#x27;s novels contain multiple storylines that originally appear to be completely unrelated, but merge later in the story.

Eight of his novels and several of his short stories take place within one consistent future universe, usually now called the Revelation Space universe after the first novel published in it, although it was originally developed in short stories for several years before the first novel. Although most characters appear in more than one novel, the works set within this future timeline rarely have the same protagonists twice. Often the protagonists from one work belong to a group that is regarded with suspicion or enmity by the protagonists of another work. While a great deal of science fiction reflects either very optimistic or dystopian visions of the human future, Reynolds&#x27;s future worlds are notable in that human societies have not departed to either positive or negative extremes, but instead are similar to those of today in terms of moral ambiguity and a mixture of cruelty and decency, corruption and opportunity, despite their technology being dramatically advanced.

The &quot;Revelation Space&quot; series includes eight novels, seven novellas, and six short stories set over a span of several centuries, spanning approximately AD 2205 to 40 000, although the novels are all set in a 300-year period spanning from 2427 to 2727. In this universe, extraterrestrial sentience exists but is elusive, and interstellar travel is primarily undertaken by a class of vessel called a lighthugger which only approaches the speed of light (faster than light travel is possible, but it is so dangerous that no race uses it). Fermi&#x27;s paradox is explained as resulting from the activities of an inorganic alien race referred to by its victims as the Inhibitors, which exterminates sentient races if they proceed above a certain level of technology. The tetralogy consisting of &quot;Revelation Space&quot;, &quot;Redemption Ark&quot;, &quot;Absolution Gap&quot;, and &quot;Inhibitor Phase&quot; deals with humanity coming to the attention of the Inhibitors and the resultant war between them.

&quot;Century Rain&quot; takes place in a future universe independent of the &quot;Revelation Space&quot; universe and has different rules, such as faster-than-light travel being possible through a system of portals similar to wormholes. &quot;Century Rain&quot; also departs substantially from Reynolds&#x27;s previous works, both in having a protagonist who is much closer to the perspective of our real world (in fact he is from a version of our past), serving as a proxy for the reader in confronting the unfamiliarity of the advanced science fiction aspects and in having a much more linear storytelling process. Reynolds&#x27;s previous protagonists started out fully absorbed in the exoticisms of the future setting and his previous &quot;Revelation Space&quot; works have several interlinked story threads, not necessarily contemporaneous. According to Reynolds, while &quot;Century Rain&quot; is a &quot;personal favorite&quot;, he has &quot;sworn there will never be a sequel&quot;.

&quot;Pushing Ice&quot; is also a standalone story, with characters from much less distant in the future than in any of his other novels, set into a framework storyline that extends much further into the future of humanity than any of his previous novels. It contains an alternative interpretation of the Fermi paradox: intelligent sentient life in this universe is extremely scarce. Reynolds states that he is &quot;firmly intending&quot; to return to the &quot;Pushing Ice&quot; setting to write a sequel.

&quot;The Prefect&quot; marked a return to the &quot;Revelation Space&quot; universe. Like &quot;Chasm City&quot;, it is a stand-alone novel within that setting. It is set prior to any of the other &quot;Revelation Space&quot; novels, though still 200 years after the original human settlement is established on the planet Yellowstone in the Epsilon Eridani system. It was published in the United Kingdom on 2 April 2007. Since its publication, the title of &quot;The Prefect&quot; has been changed to &quot;Aurora Rising&quot; to more align with the name of the sequel, &quot;Elysium Fire&quot;, which was published in 2018, marking the first novel length return to the &quot;Revelation Space&quot; universe since 2007. This sub-series within the &quot;Revelation Space&quot; universe is now called &quot;The Prefect Dreyfus Emergencies&quot;. Reynolds states that he has &quot;tentative plans for three more Dreyfus titles, with an arc that would eventually take him beyond Yellowstone, and then back again.&quot;

&quot;House of Suns&quot; is a standalone novel set in the same universe as his novella &quot;Thousandth Night&quot; from the &quot;One Million A.D.&quot; anthology. It was released in the UK on 17 April 2008 and in the US on 2 June 2009. Reynolds described it as &quot;Six million years in the future, starfaring clones, tensions between human and robot metacivilisations, King Crimson jokes.&quot; As with &quot;Pushing Ice&quot;, Reynolds also states that he is &quot;firmly intending&quot; to return to the &quot;House of Suns&quot; setting to write a sequel.

&quot;Terminal World&quot;, published in March 2010 was described by Reynolds as &quot;a kind of steampunk-tinged planetary romance, set in the distant future&quot;. As with &quot;Century Rain&quot;, Reynolds has said that he does not plan any further work in the universe of &quot;Terminal World&quot;.

In June 2009 Reynolds signed a new deal, worth £1 million, with his British publishers for ten books to be published over the next ten years.

Between 2012 and 2015 Reynolds released three novels set in a new universe called &quot;Poseidon&#x27;s Children&quot;: &quot;Blue Remembered Earth&quot; (2012), &quot;On the Steel Breeze&quot; (2014), and &quot;Poseidon&#x27;s Wake&quot; (2015). The novels comprise a hard science fiction trilogy dealing with the expansion of the human species into the solar system and beyond, and the emergence of Africa as a spacefaring, technological super-state.

His &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novel &quot;Harvest of Time&quot; was published in June 2013.

His forthcoming work includes &quot;Banish&quot;, which will be appearing in &quot;Multiverses&quot; by Preston Grassmann (ed.) for Titan Publishing.

==Awards and nominations==

Reynolds&#x27;s fiction has received three awards and several other nominations. His second novel &quot;Chasm City&quot; won the 2001 British Science Fiction Award for Best Novel. His short story &quot;Weather&quot; won the Japanese National Science Fiction Convention&#x27;s Seiun Award for Best Translated Short Fiction. His novels &quot;Absolution Gap&quot; and &quot;The Prefect&quot; have also been nominated for previous BSFA awards. Reynolds has been nominated for the Arthur C. Clarke Award three times, for his novels &quot;Revelation Space&quot;, &quot;Pushing Ice&quot; and &quot;House of Suns&quot;. In 2010, he won the Sidewise Award for Alternate History for his short story &quot;The Fixation&quot;. His novella &quot;Troika&quot; made the shortlist for the 2011 Hugo Awards. His Novel &quot;Revenger&quot; received the 2017 Locus Award for Best Young Adult Book. 

==Adaptations==
On 10 March 2019 Alastair Reynolds announced that his short stories &quot;Zima Blue&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Aquila Rift&quot; had been adapted as part of Netflix&#x27;s animated anthology &quot;Love, Death &amp; Robots&quot;. These stories are the first of Reynolds&#x27;s works to be adapted for TV or film.

==Personal life==
In 1991, Reynolds moved to Noordwijk in the Netherlands, where he met his wife Josette (who is from France) and worked for the European Space Research and Technology Centre (part of the European Space Agency) until 2004, when he left to pursue writing full-time. He returned to Wales in 2008 and lives near Cardiff.

<doc id="69169" wikidata="Q44057" url="?curid=69169" title="Millennium Bridge, London">
<text>The Millennium Bridge, officially known as the London Millennium Footbridge, is a steel suspension bridge for pedestrians crossing the River Thames in London, England, linking Bankside with the City of London. It is owned and maintained by Bridge House Estates, a charitable trust overseen by the City of London Corporation. Construction began in 1998, and it initially opened on 10 June 2000.

Londoners nicknamed it the &quot;Wobbly Bridge&quot; and even the &quot;&quot; after pedestrians experienced an alarming swaying motion on its opening day. The bridge was closed later that day and, after two days of limited access, it was closed again for almost two years so that modifications and repairs could be made to keep the bridge stable and stop the swaying motion. It reopened in February 2002.

The bridge is located between Southwark Bridge and Blackfriars Railway Bridge. Its southern end is near the Globe Theatre, the Bankside Gallery, and Tate Modern, while its northern end is next to the City of London School below St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. The bridge&#x27;s alignment is such that a clear view (i.e. a &quot;terminating vista&quot;) of St Paul&#x27;s south façade is presented from across the river, framed by the bridge supports.

==Design==

An architectural design competition was organised in 1996 by Southwark council and RIBA Competitions. The winning entry was an innovative &quot;blade of light&quot; effort from Arup Group, Foster + Partners and Anthony Caro. Due to height restrictions, and to improve the view, the bridge&#x27;s suspension design had the supporting cables below the deck level, giving a very shallow profile. The bridge has two river piers and consists of three main sections of , , , (north to south) with a total structure length of ; the aluminium deck is wide. The eight suspension cables are tensioned to pull with a force of 2,000 tons against the piers set into each bank—enough to support a working load of 5,000 people.

==Construction==
Ordinarily, bridges across the River Thames require an Act of Parliament. For this bridge, that was avoided by the Port of London Authority granting a licence for the structure, and the City of London and London Borough of Southwark granting planning permission. Construction began in late 1998, and the main works were started on 28 April 1999 by Monberg &amp; Thorsen and Sir Robert McAlpine. The eventual cost was £18.2 million (£2.2m over budget), primarily paid for by the Millennium Commission and the London Bridge Trust.

==Opening==
The bridge opened on 10 June 2000, one month late.

Unexpected lateral vibration due to resonant structural response caused the bridge to be closed on 12 June for modifications. Attempts had been made to limit the number of people crossing the bridge, which led to long queues but were ineffective to dampen the vibrations. Closure of the bridge only two days after opening attracted public criticism as another high-profile British Millennium project that suffered an embarrassing setback, akin to how many saw the Millennium Dome.

The vibration was attributed to a then-underresearched phenomenon whereby pedestrians crossing a bridge that has a &quot;lateral&quot; sway have an unconscious tendency to match their footsteps to the sway, exacerbating it. This is different from the well-understood problem of &quot;vertical&quot; sway, which is why troops stop marching in stride together as a unit when crossing such a bridge. An example is London&#x27;s Albert Bridge, which has a sign dating from 1873 warning marching ranks of soldiers to break step while crossing.

==Resonance==
The bridge&#x27;s movements were caused by a positive feedback phenomenon, known as &quot;synchronous lateral excitation&quot;. The natural sway motion of people walking caused small sideways oscillations in the bridge, which in turn caused people on the bridge to sway in step, increasing the amplitude of the bridge oscillations and continually reinforcing the effect; the maximum sway was around . On the day of opening, the bridge was crossed by 90,000 people, with up to 2,000 on the bridge at a time.

Resonant vibrational modes due to vertical loads (such as trains, traffic or pedestrians) and wind loads are well understood in bridge design. In the case of the Millennium Bridge, because the lateral motion caused pedestrians to directly participate with the bridge, the vibrational modes had not been anticipated by the designers. When the bridge lurches to one side, the pedestrians must adjust to keep from falling over, and they all do this at the same time. The effect is similar to soldiers marching in lockstep, but horizontal instead of vertical.

The risks of lateral vibration in lightweight bridges are well known. Any bridge with lateral frequency modes of less than 1.3 Hz, and sufficiently low mass, could witness the same phenomenon with sufficient pedestrian loading. The greater the number of people, the greater the amplitude of the vibrations. Other bridges which have seen similar problems are:

* Auckland Harbour Bridge, with a lateral frequency of 0.67 Hz during a 1975 demonstration
* Birmingham NEC Link bridge, with a lateral frequency of 0.7 Hz

===Mitigation===
Engineers at Arup, the company that designed the bridge, conducted research into the unexpected oscillation, which they called &#x27;synchronous lateral excitation&#x27;. The first laboratory studies used pedestrians on moving platforms at the University of Southampton and Imperial College London. Later in 2000, one span of the bridge was instrumented and tested with crowds of up to 275 people.

They concluded that making the bridge stiffer, to move its resonant frequency out of the excitation range, was not feasible as it would greatly change its appearance. Instead, the resonance was controlled by retrofitting 37 viscous fluid dampers to dissipate energy. These include 17 chevron dampers – long V-shaped braces under the deck panels – to control lateral movement, 4 vertical to ground dampers to control lateral and vertical movements, and 16 pier dampers to control lateral and torsional movements. Additionally, 52 tuned mass dampers add inertia to control vertical movement. The work took from May 2001 to January 2002 and cost £5 million. After a period of testing, the bridge was reopened on 22 February 2002 and, since that date, has not been subject to significant vibration. In spite of the successful cure, the &quot;wobbly bridge&quot; (sometimes &quot;wibbly-wobbly&quot;) epithet remains in common usage among Londoners.
===Cable resonance===
An artistic expression of the higher-frequency resonances within the cables of the bridge were explored by Bill Fontana&#x27;s &quot;Harmonic Bridge&quot; exhibition at the Tate Modern in mid-2006. This used acoustic transducers placed at strategic locations on the cabling of the Millennium Bridge and the signals from those transducers were amplified and dynamically distributed throughout the Turbine Hall of the Tate by a programme which Fontana entered into the sound diffusion engine of the Richmond Sound Design AudioBox.

==Repair==
In October 2023, the bridge was closed for three weeks to allow repairs to its surface, undertaken by FM Conway. The bridge closed on Saturday 14 October and reopened late on 5 November.

==Millennium Inclinator==

A short inclined lift, known as the Millennium Inclinator, is next to the northern end of the Millennium Bridge. It was opened in December 2003 to allow pedestrians to surmount the steep slope (13.6°) of Peter&#x27;s Hill from the riverside to the entrance to the Millennium Bridge without using the alternative flight of steps. The lower end of the lift is on Paul&#x27;s Walk next to the Thames, and the top end is further up Peter&#x27;s Hill on the terrace which is level with the deck of the bridge. It was primarily installed for use by those who cannot easily manage the steep steps, such as people with disabilities and parents with push chairs.

The lift carriage was originally powered by an electric traction motor, manufactured in Italy by Maspero Elevatori, with a speed of and a maximum capacity of . However, by 2010 the City of London Planning and Transportation Committee decided that the level of service was unacceptable, because the inclinator was frequently out of service due to mechanical breakdowns and vandalism. So the Committee agreed it would be replaced at a cost of up to £750,000 in time for the 2012 Summer Paralympics.

A major renovation project was undertaken in 2012, and the lift was reopened in time for the Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant of 3 June 2012, which took place about a month before the 2012 Summer Olympics. The new lift was manufactured by &quot;Hütter Aufzüge&quot; of Glinde, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, a lift manufacturer which was taken over by Otis in 2013. Axis Elevators installed the new equipment.
Following a redevelopment of the area in 2021 the lift was closed and will be replaced by a platform lift.

<doc id="69170" wikidata="Q29758" url="?curid=69170" title="Pocket PC">
<text>A Pocket PC (P/PC, PPC) is a class of personal digital assistant (PDA) that runs the Windows Mobile operating system, which is based on Windows CE/Windows Embedded Compact, and that has some of the abilities of modern desktop PCs. The name was introduced by Microsoft in 2000 as a rebranding of the Palm-size PC category and was marketed until 2007. Some of these devices also had integrated phone and data capabilities, which were called Pocket PC Phone Edition. Windows &quot;Smartphone&quot; is another Windows CE based platform for non-touch and non-PDA devices. 

In 2007, with the advent of Windows Mobile 6.0, Microsoft dropped the name Pocket PC in favor of a new naming scheme:
* Windows Mobile Classic (formerly Pocket PC): devices without an integrated phone;
* Windows Mobile Professional (formerly Pocket PC Phone Edition): devices with an integrated phone and a touch screen;
* Windows Mobile Standard (formerly Smartphone): devices with an integrated phone but without a touch screen.

As of 2010, thousands of applications existed for handhelds adhering to the Microsoft Pocket PC specification, many of which were freeware. Microsoft-compliant Pocket PCs can be used with many add-ons such as GPS receivers, barcode readers, RFID readers, and cameras. Pocket PC was replaced by Windows Phone in 2010 but even after versions were released based on the Windows NT kernel were ultimately unable to compete with the iPhone of 2007 and Android phones and interest waned in Pocket PCs without phones.

==History==

The Pocket PC was an evolution from prior calculator-sized computers. Keystroke-programmable calculators which could do simple business and scientific applications were available by the 1970s. In 1982, Hewlett Packard&#x27;s HP-75 incorporated a 1-line text display, an alphanumeric keyboard, HP BASIC language and some basic PDA abilities. The HP 95LX, HP 100LX and HP 200LX series packed a PC-compatible MS-DOS computer with graphics display and QWERTY keyboard into a palmtop format. The HP OmniGo 100 and 120 used a pen and graphics interface on DOS-based PC/GEOS, but was not widely sold in the United States. The HP 300LX built a palmtop computer on the Windows CE operating system.

Palm-size PC (PsPC) was Microsoft&#x27;s official name for Windows CE PDAs that were smaller than Handheld PCs by the lack of a physical keyboard. The class was announced in January 1998 originally as &quot;Palm PC&quot; which provoked a lawsuit by Palm Inc., and the name changed soon afterwards to Palm-size PC before release. These devices were similar to the Handheld PC and also ran Windows CE, however this version was more limited and lacked Pocket Microsoft Office, Pocket Internet Explorer, ActiveX and some other tools. Its main competitor was the PalmPilot and Palm III. According to the specification, Palm-size PCs use SuperH SH3 processors and MIPS architecture. The term &quot;palm-sized PC&quot; was also used as a generic term of similar such devices that are not necessary connected to Microsoft, such as the PalmPilot.

Microsoft&#x27;s Handheld PCs and Palm-size PCs did not gain much success in the markets compared to Palm, with users complaining the Windows CE software were hard to use and the devices themselves were thick. On April 19, 2000, Microsoft introduced Pocket PC with a revamped interface and to better compete against the popular Palm devices. The Pocket PC was based on the all new version 3.0 of Windows CE. HP, Casio and Compaq were the first OEMs with Pocket PC devices in 2000. The familiar desktop Windows UI from Palm-size PCs was removed in favor of a more tailored interface on Pocket PCs.

According to Microsoft, the Pocket PC is &quot;a handheld device that enables users to store and retrieve e-mail, contacts, appointments, tasks, play multimedia files, games, exchange text messages with Windows Live Messenger (formerly known as MSN Messenger), browse the Web, and more.&quot;Prior to the release of Windows Mobile 2003, third-party software was developed using Microsoft&#x27;s eMbedded Visual Tools, eMbedded Visual Basic (eVB) and eMbedded Visual C (eVC). eVB programs can usually be converted fairly easily to NS Basic/CE. or to Basic4ppc.

In 2007 the Pocket PC name was dropped altogether. The Pocket PC Phone Edition became Windows Mobile Professional; the Smartphone became Windows Mobile Standard; and the classic phone-less Pocket PC (which by now had become a niche) became Windows Mobile Classic.

The Pocket PC/Windows Mobile OS was superseded by Windows Phone on February 15, 2010, when the latter was announced at Mobile World Congress that year. No existing hardware was officially supported for a Windows Phone 7 upgrade. Additionally, not a single one of the thousands of apps available for Windows Mobile would run unaltered on Windows Phone.

==Specification==
From a technical standpoint, &quot;Pocket PC&quot; is a Microsoft specification that sets various hardware and software requirements for mobile devices bearing the &quot;Pocket PC&quot; label.

For instance, any device which is to be classified as a Pocket PC must:
* Run Microsoft&#x27;s Windows Mobile, Pocket PC edition
* Come bundled with a specific suite of applications in ROM
:&quot;Note: the name &quot;Windows Mobile&quot; includes both the Windows CE operating system and a suite of basic applications along with a specified user interface&quot;
* Include a touchscreen
* Include a directional pad or touchpad
* Include a set of hardware application buttons
* Be based on an ARMv4 compatible, Intel XScale (ARMv5), MIPS or SH3 CPU. (As of the Pocket PC 2002 specification, ARM-based CPUs are required.)

==Operating system versions==
===Windows Mobile 6.5===

The first Windows Mobile 6.5 device was first shown in September 2009. Leaked ROMs surfaced in July 2009 for specific devices. The generic ROM images for Mobile 6.5 are also available as part of the officially distributed and freely downloadable development kit.

Several phones running Windows Mobile 6.1 can be updated to Windows Mobile 6.5.

===Windows Mobile 6.1===

Microsoft&#x27;s Windows Mobile 6.1 was announced on April 1, 2008, and introduced instant messaging-like texting. Windows Mobile 6.1 was built upon Windows CE 5.

===Windows Mobile 6===

Microsoft&#x27;s Windows Mobile 6, internally code-named &#x27;Crossbow&#x27;, was officially released by Microsoft on February 12, 2007. Mobile 6 was still based on Windows CE 5 and was effectively just a face-lift of Windows Mobile 5. With Mobile 6 also came Microsoft&#x27;s new naming conventions and devices were no longer called Pocket PCs: devices with no phone abilities were named Windows Mobile Classic, and devices with phone abilities were named Windows Mobile Professional.

===Windows Mobile 5===

Windows Mobile 5 for Pocket PC was based on Windows CE 5 and contained many fixes and improvements over Windows Mobile 2003.

Pocket PCs running prior versions of the operating system generally stored user-installed applications and data in RAM, which meant that if the battery was depleted the device would lose all of its data. Windows Mobile 5.0 solved this problem by storing all user data in persistent (flash) memory, leaving the RAM to be used only for running applications, as it would be on a desktop computer. As a result, Windows Mobile 5.0 Pocket PCs generally had more flash memory, and less RAM, compared to earlier devices.

===Windows Mobile 2003===

Windows Mobile 2003 consisted of the Windows CE.NET 4.2 operating system bundled with scaled-down versions of many popular desktop applications, including Microsoft Outlook, Internet Explorer, Word, Excel, Windows Media Player, and others.

Windows Mobile 2003 Second Edition added native landscape, square screen and VGA support as well as other fixes and changes to those features already present in the original release of Windows Mobile 2003.

===Windows CE 3.0===

Pocket PC 2000 was launched April 2000, and ran Windows CE 3.0. Pocket PC 2000 featured a mobile version of Microsoft Office, a chief feature being the ability to password-protect Excel files.

Pocket PC 2002 was launched October 2001, and was powered by Windows CE 3.0, as with its predecessor. Some Pocket PC 2002 devices were also sold as &quot;Phone Editions&quot;, which included cell phone functionality in addition to the PDA abilities.

==Vendors==

Before the Pocket PC brand was launched, there were other Windows-based machines of the same form factor called Palm-size PCs. These devices ran Windows CE 2.0–2.11 and had an interface that was similar to the then-current desktop versions of Windows like Windows 95. The first of these was the Everex Freestyle, also known as HTC Kangaroo, from 1998. Other examples include Casio Cassiopeia E-10/E-11, Compaq Aero 1500/1520, Philips Nino and HP Jornada 420/430.

Pocket PCs were manufactured and sold by several different companies; the major manufacturers include HP (under the iPAQ and now defunct Jornada brands), Toshiba, Acer, Asus, Dell (under the now defunct Axim brand), Fujitsu Siemens, E-TEN, HTC, and ViewSonic. In mid-2003, Gateway Computers and JVC announced they would release Pocket PCs, but the projects were discontinued before a product was released. Prices in 2003 ranged from around for the high-end models, some of which are combined with cell phones, to $200 for low-end models. A $100–$200 model was rumored to be released within 2004 or early 2005, although the lowest price for a just-released Pocket PC never went under $300. Many companies ceased to sell PDA&#x27;s by 2003–2004 because of a declining market. Major companies such as Viewsonic and Toshiba stopped producing new Pocket PCs.

Companies like O2, T-Mobile and Orange were marketing Pocket PCs that have integrated mobile telephony (smartphones). All users have to do is put in the SIM card and follow the wizard, to put their SIM contacts in the address book. An example is O2&#x27;s Xda, or T-Mobile&#x27;s MDA Compact. Both of these devices, while bearing the phone operator&#x27;s logo, are manufactured by the dominant Pocket PC manufacturer HTC.

One of the more popular high-end consumer-market Pocket PCs was the Dell Axim x51v, which was discontinued in 2007. Hardware specs included 3.7&quot; color TFT VGA display with 640x480 resolution, Intel XScaleTM PXA270 processor at 624 MHz, 336 MB of memory (256 MB flash, 64 MB SDRAM), integrated 802.11b and Bluetooth 1.2, integrated Intel 2700G multimedia accelerator with 16 MB video memory. Expansion was possible via CompactFlash Type II and SD slots (supporting SDIO Now!, SDIO and MMC cards). Included is a 1,100 mAh user replaceable battery (est. 4–6.5 hours, 2200 mAh also available).

Some Pocket PCs featured integrated GPS often combined with mobile phone functionality. Pocket PCs with built-in telephony differ from Windows Mobile Smartphone Edition devices in several respects, including the lack of a touchscreen on the latter. Some examples of current Pocket PCs with GPS integrated are the Fujitsu Siemens Pocket Loox N560, a high-end Pocket PC with a VGA screen and an integrated SiRF Star III GPS; the HTC TyTN, a small communicator with integrated slide in keyboard; the HP hw6945 and HP iPAQ hw6515 with integrated thumb-board, GPS and GSM/GPRS telephony; the HTC top-of-the-line Universal, branded as the QTek 9000 (also branded by various telecommunications companies as the Orange SPV M5000, T-mobile MDA Pro, Vodafone VPA IV, O2 Xda Exec, i-Mate JasJar, Dopod 900).

A newer entrant into the Pocket PC market was its rival Palm, which sold devices like the Treo 700w/wx based on Windows Mobile 5.0 and featuring integrated telephony. Previous to this, Palm only produced PDAs running its own Palm OS (as did the first versions of the Palm Treo) before it was losing popularity to Pocket PC&#x27;s Windows Mobile.

HTC manufactured up to 80% of all phone enabled Windows Mobile devices for other companies (including HP and O2), as well as many non-phone Pocket PCs (for companies such as Dell, HP and Fujitsu Siemens) as of 2006. HTC was by now marketing Windows Mobile devices under their own brand, as well as that of Dopod.

<doc id="69174" wikidata="Q320416" url="?curid=69174" title="Tartessos">
<text>Tartessos () is, as defined by archaeological discoveries, a historical civilization settled in the southern Iberian Peninsula characterized by its mixture of local Paleohispanic and Phoenician traits. It had a writing system, identified as Tartessian, that includes some 97 inscriptions in a Tartessian language.

In the historical records, Tartessos () appears as a semi-mythical or legendary harbor city and the surrounding culture on the south coast of the Iberian Peninsula (in modern Andalusia, Spain), at the mouth of the Guadalquivir. It appears in sources from Greece and the Near East starting during the first millennium BC. Herodotus, for example, describes it as beyond the Pillars of Hercules. Roman authors tend to echo the earlier Greek sources, but from around the end of the millennium there are indications that the name Tartessos had fallen out of use and the city may have been lost to flooding, although several authors attempt to identify it with cities of other names in the area.

The Tartessians were rich in metals. In the fourth century BC the historian Ephorus describes &quot;a very prosperous market called Tartessos, with much tin carried by river, as well as gold and copper from Celtic lands&quot;. Trade in tin was very lucrative in the Bronze Age, since it is an essential component of bronze and is comparatively rare. Herodotus refers to a king of Tartessos, Arganthonios, presumably named for his wealth in silver. Herodotus also says that Arganthonios welcomed the first Greeks to reach Iberia, which was a ship carrying the Phocaeans from Asia Minor.

Pausanias wrote that Myron, the tyrant of Sicyon, built a treasury, which was called the treasury of the Sicyonians, to commemorate a victory in the chariot race at the Olympic games. In the treasury, he made two chambers with two different styles, one Doric and one Ionic, with bronze. The Eleans said that the bronze was Tartessian.

The people from Tartessos became important trading partners of the Phoenicians, whose presence in Iberia dates from the eighth century BC and who nearby built a harbor of their own, Gadir (, , present-day Cádiz).

== Location ==
Several early sources, such as Aristotle, refer to Tartessos as a river. Aristotle claims that it rises from the Pyrene Mountain (generally accepted by modern scholars as the Pyrenees) and flows out to sea outside the Pillars of Hercules, the modern Strait of Gibraltar. No such river traverses the Iberian Peninsula.

According to the fourth century BC Greek geographer and explorer Pytheas, quoted by Strabo in the first century AD, the ancestral homeland of the Turduli was located north of Turdetania, the region where the kingdom of Tartessos was located in the Baetis River valley (the present-day Guadalquivir valley) in southern Spain.

Pausanias, writing in the second century AD, identified the river and gave details of the location of the city:

They say that Tartessus is a river in the land of the Iberians, running down into the sea by two mouths and that between these two mouths lies a city of the same name. The river, which is the largest in Iberia and tidal, those of a later day called Baetis and there are some who think that Tartessus was the ancient name of Carpia, a city of the Iberians.

The river known in his day as the Baetis is now the Guadalquivir. Thus, Tartessos may be buried, Schulten thought, under the shifting wetlands. The river delta has gradually been blocked by a sandbar that stretches from the mouth of the Rio Tinto, near Palos de la Frontera to Almonte, the riverbank that is opposite Sanlúcar de Barrameda. The area is now protected as the Parque Nacional de Doñana.

In the first century AD, Pliny the Elder incorrectly identified the city of Carteia as the Tartessos mentioned in Greek sources while Strabo just commented. Carteia is identified as El Rocadillo, near S. Roque, Province of Cádiz, some distance away from the Guadalquivir. In the second century AD, Appian thought that Karpessos (Carpia) was previously known as Tartessos.

== Archaeological discoveries ==

The discoveries published by Adolf Schulten in 1922 first drew attention to Tartessos and shifted its study from classical philologists and antiquarians to investigations based on archaeology, although attempts at localizing a capital for what was conceived as a complicated culture in the nature of a centrally controlled kingdom ancestral to Spain were inconclusively debated. Subsequent discoveries were widely reported: in September 1923 archaeologists discovered a Phoenician necropolis in which human remains were unearthed and stones found with illegible characters. It may have been colonized by the Phoenicians for trade because of its richness in metals.

A later generation turned instead to identifying and localizing &quot;orientalizing&quot; (eastern Mediterranean) features of the Tartessian material culture within the broader Mediterranean horizon of an &quot;Orientalizing period&quot; recognizable in the Aegean and Etruria.
J. M. Luzón was the first to identify Tartessos with modern Huelva, based on discoveries made in the preceding decades. Since the discovery in September 1958 of the rich gold treasure of El Carambolo in Camas, three kilometres west of Seville, and of hundreds of artefacts in the necropolis at La Joya, Huelva, archaeological surveys have been integrated with philological and literary surveys and the broader picture of the Iron Age in the Mediterranean basin to provide a more informed view of the supposed Tartessian culture on the ground, concentrated in western Andalusia, Extremadura, and in southern Portugal from the Algarve to the Vinalopó River in Alicante.

=== Turuñuelo archaeological site ===

Significant discoveries were made at Turuñuelo archeological site in Guareña, where excavation began in 2015. The site was declared &quot;bien de interés cultural&quot; (National heritage site) in May 2022.

Two ornate stone busts, featuring details of jewelry and hairstyles which are thought to be the first facial representations of the Tartessian goddesses were discovered in 2023. These sculptures are somewhat similar to the Lady of Elche sculpture, which was dated between the 5th and 4th centuries BC, but are considerably earlier. Fragments of at least three other busts have also been recovered. One of them is attributed to a warrior because part of his helmet is preserved.

In this region of southern Spain, the Tartessian culture was born around the 9th century B.C. as a result of hybridization between the Phoenician settlers and the local inhabitants. Scholars refer to the Tartessian culture as &quot;a hybrid archaeological culture&quot;.

=== Metallurgy ===
Alluvial tin was panned in Tartessian streams from an early date. The spread of a silver standard in Assyria increased its attractiveness (the tribute from Phoenician cities was assessed in silver). The invention of coinage in the seventh century BC spurred the search for bronze and silver as well. Henceforth trade connections, formerly largely in elite goods, assumed an increasingly broad economic role. By the Late Bronze Age, silver extraction in Huelva Province reached industrial proportions. Pre-Roman silver slag is found in the Tartessian cities of Huelva Province. Cypriot and Phoenician metalworkers produced 15 million tons of pyrometallurgical residues at the vast dumps of Riotinto. Mining and smelting preceded the arrival, from the eighth century BC onward, of Phoenicians and then Greeks, who provided a stimulating wider market and whose influence sparked an &quot;orientalizing&quot; phase in Tartessian material culture ( BC) before Tartessian culture was superseded by the Classic Iberian culture.

&quot;Tartessic&quot; artefacts linked with the Tartessos culture have been found, and many archaeologists now associate the &quot;lost&quot; city with Huelva. In excavations on spatially restricted sites in the center of modern Huelva, sherds of elite painted Greek ceramics of the first half of the sixth century BC have been recovered. Huelva contains the largest accumulation of imported elite goods and must have been an important Tartessian center. Medellín, on the Guadiana River, revealed an important necropolis.
Elements specific to Tartessian culture are the Late Bronze Age fully evolved pattern-burnished wares and geometrically banded and patterns &quot;Carambolo&quot; wares, from the ninth to the sixth centuries BC; an &quot;Early Orientalizing&quot; phase with the first eastern Mediterranean imports, beginning circa 750 BC; a &quot;Late Orientalizing&quot; phase with the finest bronze casting and goldsmith work; gray ware turned on the fast potter&#x27;s wheel, local imitations of imported Phoenician red-slip wares.

Characteristic Tartessian bronzes include pear-shaped jugs, often associated in burials, with shallow dish-shaped braziers having loop handles, incense-burners with floral motifs, fibulas, both elbowed and double-spring types, and belt buckles.

No pre-colonial necropolis sites have been identified. The change from a late Bronze Age pattern of circular or oval huts scattered on a village site to rectangular houses with dry-stone foundations and plastered wattle and daub walls took place during the seventh and sixth centuries BC, in settlements with planned layouts that succeeded one another on the same site. 

At Cástulo (Jaén), a mosaic of river pebbles from the end of the sixth century BC is the earliest mosaic in Western Europe. Most sites were inexplicably abandoned in the fifth century BC.

Tartessic occupation sites of the Late Bronze Age that were not particularly complex: &quot;a domestic mode of production seems to have predominated&quot; is one mainstream assessment. An earlier generation of archaeologists and historians took a normative approach to the primitive Tartessian adoption of Punic styles and techniques, as of a less-developed culture adopting better, more highly evolved cultural traits, and finding Eastern parallels for Early Iron Age material culture in the Tartessian sites. A later generation has been more concerned with the &quot;process&quot; through which local institutions evolved.
The emergence of new archaeological finds in the city of Huelva is prompting the revision of these traditional views. Just in two adjacent lots adding up to 2,150 sq. m. between Las Monjas Square and Mendez Nuñez Street, some 90,000 ceramic fragments of indigenous, Phoenician, and Greek imported wares were exhumed, out of which 8,009 allowed scope for a type identification. This pottery, dated from the tenth to the early eighth centuries BC predates finds from other Phoenician colonies; together with remnants of numerous activities, the Huelva discoveries reveal a substantial industrial and commercial &quot;emporion&quot; on this site lasting several centuries. Similar finds in other parts of the city make it possible to estimate the protohistoric habitat of Huelva at some 20 hectares, large for a site in the Iberian Peninsula during that period.

Calibrated carbon-14 dating carried out by University of Groningen on associated cattle bones as well as dating based on ceramic samples permit a chronology of several centuries through the state of the art of craft and industry since the tenth century BC, as follows: pottery (bowls, plates, craters, vases, amphorae, etc.), melting pots, casting nozzles, weights, finely worked pieces of wood, ship parts, bovid skulls, pendants, fibulae, anklebones, agate, ivory –with the only workshop of the period so far proven in the west-, gold, silver, etc.

The existence of foreign produce and materials together with local ones suggests that the old Huelva harbor was a major hub for the reception, manufacturing, and shipping of diverse products of different and distant origin. The analysis of written sources and the products exhumed, including inscriptions and thousands of Greek ceramics, some of which are works of excellent quality by known potters and painters, has led some scholars to suggest that this habitat can be identified not only with Tarshish mentioned in the Bible, in the Assyrian stele of Esarhaddon, and perhaps in the Phoenician inscription of the Nora Stone, but also with the &quot;Tartessos&quot; of Greek sources –interpreting the Tartessus river as equivalent to the present-day Tinto River and the Ligustine Lake to the joint estuary of the Odiel and Tinto rivers flowing west and east of the Huelva Peninsula.

== Religion ==
There is very little data but it is assumed that as with other Mediterranean peoples, the religion was polytheistic. It is believed that Tartessians worshiped the goddess Astarte or Potnia and the masculine divinity Baal or Melkart, as a result of the Phoenician acculturation. Sanctuaries inspired by Phoenician architecture have been found in the deposit of Castulo (Linares, Jaén) and in the vicinity of Carmona. Several images of Phoenician deities have been found in Cádiz, Huelva, and Sevilla.

== Language ==
The Tartessian language is an extinct pre-Roman language once spoken in southern Iberia. The oldest known indigenous texts of Iberia, dated from the seventh to sixth centuries BC, are written in Tartessian. The inscriptions are written in a semi-syllabic writing system called the Southwest script; they were found in the general area in which Tartessos was located and in surrounding areas of influence. Tartessian language texts were found in Southwestern Spain and Southern Portugal (namely in the Conii, Cempsi, Sefes, and Celtici areas of the Algarve and southern Alentejo).

== Possible identification as &quot;Tarshish&quot; or &quot;Atlantis&quot; ==
Since the classicists of the early twentieth century, biblical archaeologists often identify the place-name Tarshish in the Hebrew Bible with Tartessos, although others connect Tarshish to Tarsus in Anatolia or other places as far as India. Tarshish, like Tartessos, is associated with extensive mineral wealth (Iberian Pyrite Belt).

In 1922, Adolf Schulten gave currency to a view of Tartessos that made it the Western, and wholly European source of the legend of Atlantis. A more serious review, by W. A. Oldfather, appeared in &quot;American Journal of Philology&quot;. Both Atlantis and Tartessos were believed to have been advanced societies that collapsed when their cities were lost beneath the waves; supposed further similarities with the legendary society make a connection seem feasible, although virtually nothing is known of Tartessos, not even its precise site. Other Tartessian enthusiasts imagine it as a contemporary of Atlantis, with which it might have traded.

In 2011, a team led by Richard Freund claimed to have found strong evidence for the location in Doñana National Park based on underground and underwater surveys and the interpretation of the archaeological site Cancho Roano as &quot;memorial cities&quot; rebuilt in the image of Atlantis.
 Spanish scientists have dismissed Freund&#x27;s claims claiming that he was sensationalising their work. The anthropologist Juan Villarías-Robles, who works with the Spanish National Research Council, said &quot;Richard Freund was a newcomer to our project and appeared to be involved in his own very controversial issue concerning King Solomon&#x27;s search for ivory and gold in Tartessos, the well-documented settlement in the Doñana area established in the first millennium BC&quot; and described his claims as &#x27;fanciful&#x27;.

Simcha Jacobovici, involved in the production of a documentary on Freund&#x27;s work for the National Geographic Channel, stated that the biblical Tarshish (which he believes is the same as Tartessos) was Atlantis, and that &quot;Atlantis was hiding in the Tanach&quot;, although this is heavily disputed by most archeologists involved in the project. The enigmatic Lady of Elx, an ancient bust of a woman found in southeastern Spain, has been tied with Atlantis and Tartessos, although the statue displays clear signs of being manufactured by later Iberian cultures.

<doc id="69176" wikidata="Q209089" url="?curid=69176" title="Guarana">
<text>Guaraná ( from the Portuguese &quot;guaraná&quot; ; Paullinia cupana, syns. &quot;P. crysan, P. sorbilis&quot;) is a climbing plant in the family Sapindaceae, native to the Amazon basin and especially common in Brazil. Guaraná has large leaves and clusters of flowers, and is best known for the seeds from its fruits, which are about the size of a coffee bean.

As a dietary supplement or herb, guaraná seed is an effective stimulant: it contains about twice the concentration of caffeine found in coffee beans (about 2–8% caffeine in guarana seeds, compared to about 1–3% for coffee beans). The additive has gained notoriety for being used in energy drinks. As with other plants producing caffeine, the high concentration of caffeine is a defensive toxin that repels insects from the berry and seeds.

The color of the fruit ranges from brown to red and it contains black seeds that are partly covered by white arils. The color contrast when the fruit is split open has been compared with the appearance of eyeballs, and has become the basis of an origin myth among the Sateré-Mawé people.

==History and culture==
The word &quot;guaraná&quot; comes from the Guaraní word &quot;guara-ná&quot;, which has its origins in the Sateré-Maué word for the plant, &quot;warana&quot;, that in Guaraní means &quot;fruit like the eyes of the people&quot; or &quot;eyes of the gods&quot;.

Guaraná plays an important role in Tupi and Guarani culture. According to a myth attributed to the Sateré-Maué tribe, guaraná&#x27;s domestication originated with a deity killing a beloved village child. To console the villagers, a more benevolent god plucked the left eye from the child and planted it in the forest, resulting in the wild variety of guaraná. The god then plucked the right eye from the child and planted it in the village, giving rise to domesticated guarana.

The Guaranis make a herbal tea by shelling, washing and drying the seeds, followed by pounding them into a fine powder. The powder is kneaded into a dough and then shaped into cylinders. This product is known as guaraná bread, which is grated and then immersed into hot water along with sugar.

This plant was introduced to European colonizers and to Europe in the 16th century by Felip Betendorf, Oviedo, Hernández, Cobo and other Spaniard chroniclers. It has since been used, refined, adapted and commercialized by settlers, folklorists, food scientists, and marketers.

==Composition==

According to the Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank, guaranine (better known as caffeine) is found in guaraná and is identical to caffeine derived from other sources, like coffee, tea, kola nut, and Ilex. Guaranine, theine, and mateine are all synonyms for caffeine when the definitions of those words include none of the properties and chemicals of their host plants except caffeine. 

Natural sources of caffeine contain widely varying mixtures of xanthine alkaloids other than caffeine, including the cardiac stimulants theophylline, theobromine and other substances such as polyphenols, which can form insoluble complexes with caffeine. The main natural phenols found in guarana are (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin.

The table below contains a partial listing of some of the chemicals found in guaraná seeds, although other parts of the plant also may contain them in varying quantities.

==Uses==
===Safety===
In the United States, guaraná fruit powder and seed extract have not been evaluated for the status of &quot;generally recognized as safe&quot; (GRAS) by the Food and Drug Administration, but rather are approved as food additives for flavor (but not non-flavor) uses.

Guaraná is used in sweetened or carbonated soft drinks and energy drinks, an ingredient of herbal teas or contained in dietary supplement capsules. South America obtains much of its caffeine from guaraná.

===Beverages===

Brazil, the third-largest consumer of soft drinks in the world, produces several soft drink brands from the seeds of guaraná. A fermented drink is also prepared from guaraná seeds, cassava and water. Paraguay is also a producer of guaraná soft drinks with several brands operating in its market. The word &quot;guaraná&quot; is widely used in Brazil, Peru and Paraguay as a reference to soft drinks containing guaraná extract.

== Pop culture references==
Guarana is a key plot device in the &quot;Murdoch Mysteries&quot; episodes &quot;Excitable Chap&quot; and &quot;From Murdoch to Eternity&quot;, in which inventor James Pendrick creates an energy drink from a particularly potent strain of guarana, which is ultimately plowed under to make way for the Panama Canal.

<text>In phonetics, a bilabial consonant is a labial consonant articulated with both lips.

== Frequency ==
Bilabial consonants are very common across languages. Only around 0.7% of the world&#x27;s languages lack bilabial consonants altogether, including Tlingit, Chipewyan, Oneida, and Wichita, though all of these have a labial–velar approximant /w/.

==Varieties==
The bilabial consonants identified by the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) are:

== Other varieties ==
The extensions to the IPA also define a () for smacking the lips together. A lip-smack in the non-percussive sense of the lips audibly parting would be .

The IPA chart shades out &quot;bilabial lateral consonants&quot;, which is sometimes read as indicating that such sounds are not possible. The fricatives and are often lateral, but since no language makes a distinction for centrality, the allophony is not noticeable.

<doc id="69179" wikidata="Q864177" url="?curid=69179" title="Lemmings (video game)">
<text>Lemmings is a puzzle-strategy video game originally developed by DMA Design and published by Psygnosis for the Amiga in 1991 and later ported for numerous other platforms. The game was programmed by Russell Kay, Mike Dailly and David Jones, and was inspired by a simple animation that Dailly created while experimenting with Deluxe Paint.

The objective of the game is to guide a group of anthropomorphised lemmings through a number of obstacles to a designated exit. In any given level, the player must save a specified number or percentage of the lemmings in order to advance. To this end, the player must decide how to assign limited quantities of eight different skills to individual lemmings, allowing them to alter the landscape and/or their own behaviour so that the entire group can reach the exit safely.

&quot;Lemmings&quot; was one of the best-received video games of the early 1990s. It was the second-highest-rated game in the history of &quot;Amstrad Action&quot;, and was considered the eighth-greatest game of all time by &quot;Next Generation&quot; in 1996. &quot;Lemmings&quot; is also one of the most widely ported video games, and is estimated to have sold around 20 million copies between its various ports. The popularity of the game also led to the creation of several other &quot;Lemmings&quot; video-games, remakes and spin-offs, and has also inspired similar games. Despite its success, Lemmings lost considerable popularity by the late 1990s, which was attributed in part to the slow pace of gameplay compared to video games of later generations.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Lemmings&quot; is divided into a number of levels, grouped into four difficulty categories. Each level begins with one or more trap doors opening from above, releasing a steady line of lemmings who all follow each other. Levels include a variety of obstacles that prevent lemmings from reaching the exit, such as large drops, booby traps and pools of lava.

The goal of each level is to guide at least a portion of the green-haired, blue-robed lemmings from the entrance to the exit by clearing or creating a safe passage through the landscape for the lemmings to use. Unless assigned a special task, each lemming will walk in one direction ignoring any other lemming in its way (except Blockers), falling off any edges and turning around if it hits an obstacle it cannot pass. A lemming can die in a number of ways: falling from too great a height, drowning or falling into lava, falling off the bottom edge of the screen, being caught in a trap or fire, or being assigned the Bomber skill. Every level has a time limit; if the timer expires, the level ends and the player is evaluated on the number of lemmings rescued.

To successfully complete the level, the player must assign specific skills to certain lemmings. Which skills and how many uses of each are available to the player varies from level to level, and the player must assign the skills carefully to successfully guide the lemmings. There are eight skills that can be assigned: Climbers climb vertically though fall down if they hit an overhang. Floaters use a parachute to fall safely from heights. Bombers explode after a five-second timer, destroying themselves and any destructible landscape in close proximity, though not damaging other lemmings or traps. Blockers stand still and prevent other lemmings from passing; lemmings that hit a Blocker simply reverse direction. Builders build a stairway of 12 steps. Bashers, Miners and Diggers tunnel horizontally, diagonally downwards or directly downwards respectively, but cannot break through steel barriers.

While the player is able to pause the game to inspect the level and status of the lemmings, skills can only be assigned in real-time. Lemmings are initially released at a rate predetermined by the level (from 1 to 99). The player can increase the rate as desired to a maximum of 99, and later decrease it down to, but not lower than, the initial rate. The player also has the option to &quot;nuke&quot; all the remaining lemmings on the screen, converting them to Bombers. This option can be used to abort a level when in a no-win situation, remove any Blockers that remain after the remaining lemmings have been rescued, or end a level quickly once the required percentage of saved lemmings has been reached.

The four difficulty groups – &quot;Fun&quot;, &quot;Tricky&quot;, &quot;Taxing&quot; and &quot;Mayhem&quot; – are used to organise the levels to reflect their overall difficulty. This rating reflects several factors, including the number of obstacles the player has to surpass, the limitation on the number of types of skills available to assign, the time limit, the minimum rate of lemming release, and the percentage of lemmings that must be saved. Some versions have additional difficulty ratings with more levels in each.

===Two-player mode===
The original &quot;Lemmings&quot; also has 20 two-player levels. This took advantage of the Amiga&#x27;s ability to support two mice simultaneously, and the Atari&#x27;s ability to support a mouse and a joystick simultaneously. Each player is presented with their own view of the same map (on a vertically split screen), can only give orders to their own lemmings (green or blue), and has their own base. The goal is to get more lemmings (regardless of colour) into one&#x27;s own base than the other player. Gameplay cycles through the 20 levels until neither player gets any lemmings home.

==Development==
Mike Dailly, the first employee of DMA Design and one of the programmers for &quot;Lemmings&quot;, provided a detailed history of the development of the game titled &quot;The Lemmings Story&quot; in 2006. David Jones, founder of DMA Design, has also commented on the development and success of &quot;Lemmings&quot;.

The inspiration for gameplay came as a result of a simple animated character sprite in an 8×8 pixel box created by Dailly using Deluxe Paint as part of development for &quot;Walker&quot;, then envisioned as a sequel to &quot;Blood Money&quot;. Dailly was able to quickly produce an animated graphic showing his creations moving endlessly, with additional graphical improvements made by Gary Timmons and other members of the DMA Design team to help remove the stiffness in the animation. One member, Russell Kay, observed that &quot;There&#x27;s a game in that!&quot;, and later coined the term &quot;lemmings&quot; for these creations, according to Dailly. Allowing the creatures to move across the landscape was based on a &quot;Salamander&quot; weapon concept for &quot;Blood Money&quot; and demonstrated with the animations.

Levels were designed based on a Deluxe Paint interface, which allowed several of the members to design levels, resulting in &quot;hundreds of levels&quot;. There were several internal iterations of the levels, each designer challenging the others. Dailly pointed out that David Jones &quot;used to try and beat us, and after proudly stabbing a finger at the screen and saying &#x27;There! Beat that!&#x27;, we&#x27;d calmly point out a totally new way of getting around all his traps, and doing it in a much simpler method. &#x27;Oh...&#x27;, he&#x27;d mutter, and scramble off to try and fix it.&quot; They also sent internally tested levels to Psygnosis, getting back the results of their testing via fax. While most were solved quickly, Dailly commented that &quot;Every now and again though, the fax would be covered in scribbles with the time and comments crossed out again and again; this is what we were striving for while we were designing the levels, and it gave us all a warm fuzzy feeling inside.&quot;

Each of the designers had a somewhat different style in their levels: Dailly&#x27;s levels often had titles containing clues to what to do (such as &quot;It&#x27;s Hero Time&quot;, suggesting that one lemming had to be separated from the crowd) and generally required the player to perform several actions at once; Gary Timmons&#x27;s levels were minimalistic, with popular culture references in the titles; and Scott Johnston&#x27;s (whose mother was the first voice of the lemmings) levels were generally tightly packed. Dailly was also responsible for the &quot;custom&quot; levels based on other Psygnosis and Reflections Interactive Amiga games, including &quot;Shadow of the Beast&quot;, &quot;Menace&quot;, &quot;Awesome&quot; and &quot;Shadow of the Beast II&quot;. These &quot;crossover&quot; levels also used music from those games, though in ports these levels have been removed or altered to remove such references. After they developed most of the hard levels, they then created several simple levels either by copying the existing ones or creating new layouts; as Dailly states, &quot;This I believe is where many games fall down today, they do not spend the time making a good learning curve.&quot; Timmons is credited with the official drawings of the lemmings, as necessitated by the need of Psygnosis for box cover artwork.

The two-player option was inspired by then-current games &quot;Populous&quot; and &quot;Stunt Car Racer&quot;. DMA Design initially wanted to use a null-modem connection between two machines to allow competitive play, but ended up using the ability of the Amiga to have two mouse pointer devices usable at the same time and thus created the split-screen mode.

==Music==
Music was originally created by Brian Johnston (Scott&#x27;s younger brother), who sampled bits of copyrighted music. This had been common practice, but at that point there was a growing awareness of music copyright. Psygnosis therefore asked Tim Wright to replace the offending tracks; he often used arrangements and reworkings of classical and traditional music to avoid copyright problems.

==Ports and expansions==
The game&#x27;s popularity on the Amiga led to its rapid porting to many other platforms, and it is regarded as one of the most widely ported video games. Within a year of its release, the game had been ported to Atari ST, Sinclair Spectrum, PC and SNES. David Jones stated that after porting the game to 20 systems, he stopped keeping count of additional ports. Other commercial ports of the original game include 3DO, Acorn Archimedes, Apple IIGS, Macintosh, CDTV, Commodore 64, Nintendo Entertainment System, Master System, Mega Drive, PC Engine, CD-i, and X68000.

The license to the &quot;Lemmings&quot; intellectual property had remained with Psygnosis, which became part of Sony Computer Entertainment in 1993 but ultimately folded in 2012, leaving &quot;Lemmings&quot; as a Sony property. Sony has used that to craft more modern remakes. In early 2006, Sony released a remake of &quot;Lemmings&quot; for the PlayStation Portable, developed by Team17. It features all 120 levels from the original game, 36 brand-new levels as well as DataPack support (similar to the Extra Track system featured in &quot;Wipeout Pure&quot;), and a user-level editor. Every level in the game is a pre-rendered 3D landscape, although their gameplay is still 2D and remains faithful to the original game. User levels can be constructed from pre-rendered objects and distributed by uploading them to a PlayStation-specific &quot;Lemmings&quot; online community. The soundtrack also marks the final video game score created by longtime composer Tim Follin after he announced his retirement from the industry in mid-2005. In October 2006 the game was ported by developer Rusty Nutz for the PlayStation 2 with use of the EyeToy. The basic change in the concept is that the player must stretch and use their limbs in the recorded picture to aid the lemmings.


===Expansions===
&quot;Lemmings&quot; received some expansion packs following its launch. &quot;Oh No! More Lemmings&quot;, originally released for the Amiga in 1991 both as a data disk or standalone game, added five varying difficulties – Tame, Crazy, Wild, Wicked and Havoc – each with 20 new levels. The game also features enhanced graphics and altered sound effects. The expansion was also ported to Acorn Archimedes, Atari ST, DOS, Macintosh, and SAM Coupé, and the levels were made available with the Game Boy Color, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation and Sega Mega Drive versions of &quot;Lemmings&quot;. &quot;Oh No! More Lemmings&quot; received generally positive reviews. Dan Slingsby of &quot;CU Amiga&quot; found the game addictive, calling the puzzles &quot;ingenious&quot;, and Peter Lee of &quot;Amiga Action&quot; praised the quality and difficulty of the levels; Stuart Campbell of &quot;Amiga Power&quot; was disappointed by the lack of fixes from the original game, and Ed Ricketts of &quot;ST Format&quot; criticized the difficulty gradient of the levels and the price of the expansion, but both ultimately gave positive reviews nonetheless.

&quot;Christmas Lemmings&quot;, also known as &quot;Holiday Lemmings&quot;, was also released as a series of short games released between 1991 and 1994. The gameplay remains unchanged from the base game, which is not required. First released as &quot;Xmas Lemmings&quot; as two four-level demos in 1991 and 1992, there were two later full retail releases on the Amiga and Atari ST in 1993 and 1994, both with an additional 32 levels. The games were well-received; Rob Mead of &quot;Amiga Format&quot; described it as &quot;funny, frustrating and incredibly addictive&quot;, despite being disappointed by the number of levels, and Will Greenwald of &quot;PC Magazine&quot; ranked it among the best Christmas video games in 2014.

==Reception==
The original sales for &quot;Lemmings&quot; on the Amiga topped 55,000 copies on the first day of sales; in comparison, &quot;Menace&quot; sold 20,000 copies and &quot;Blood Money&quot; sold 40,000 copies cumulatively. With all ports included, Mike Dailly estimated that 15 million copies of &quot;Lemmings&quot; were sold between 1991 and 2006. In 2011, Luke Plunkett from &quot;Kotaku&quot; placed the figure at over 20 million, a figure which has been quoted as far back as 1997.

At the time of its first release, &quot;Lemmings&quot; received several high scores from gaming magazines, with only the level of graphics and sound receiving some small amount of criticism. David Sears of &quot;Compute!&quot;, in his review of &quot;Lemmings&quot; for the PC, stated that &quot;perhaps Psygnosis has tapped into the human instinct for survival in formulating this perfect blend of puzzle, strategy, and action.&quot; &quot;Amiga Computing&quot; stated that &quot;&quot;Lemmings&quot; is absolutely brilliant. Psygnosis have managed to produce a game that is not only totally original, but also features the kind of addictive gameplay that will keep you coming back for more time and time again.&quot; A review from the &quot;Australian Commodore and Amiga Review&quot; (&quot;ACAR&quot;) stated that &quot;above all, the concept is simple, and the game is a lot of fun.&quot; &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; stated that &quot;Not since &quot;Tetris&quot; has this reviewer been so addicted to, or completely fascinated with, a series of challenging puzzles ... follow the crowd and get &quot;Lemmings&quot;&quot;. In 1992 the magazine named it its Action Game of the Year. The game was reviewed in 1991 in &quot;Dragon&quot; by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in &quot;The Role of Computers&quot; column. The reviewers gave the game 5 out of 5 stars. The Lessers reviewed the Macintosh version of the game in 1993 in &quot;Dragon&quot;, also giving that version 5 stars.

In the Finnish magazine &quot;Mikrobitti&quot;, Jukka Tapanimäki gave the Amiga and DOS versions of &quot;Lemmings&quot; 84 points of 100. He praised the game&#x27;s originality but expressed criticism for it being repetitive.

In 1994 &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; complimented the Lynx version&#x27;s large number of options and password feature, and remarked, &quot;&quot;Lemmings&quot; has always been a good strategy game, and the Lynx version continues the tradition.&quot; The following year they reviewed the CD-i version, criticising that it has nothing but the obligatory full-motion video intro to set it apart from the numerous ports of the game that had already been released over the past four years. &quot;GamePro&quot; made the same criticisms, commenting that &quot;this former 16-bit puzzler isn&#x27;t going anywhere new on the CD-i.&quot;

&quot;Next Generation&quot;″s review of the 3DO version assessed that &quot;If you&#x27;ve played any version, you&#x27;ve played this one, too, but if you haven&#x27;t tried it, this is one of the better ones, and it&#x27;s still one game that&#x27;s addictive as hell.&quot;

In 1996, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; declared &quot;Lemmings&quot; the 12th-best computer game ever released, and that same year, &quot;Next Generation&quot; declared it the 8th-greatest game of all time, and &quot;second only to &quot;Tetris&quot;&quot; in the puzzle genre. In 2004, readers of &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; voted &quot;Lemmings&quot; as the 21st-top retro game, with the editors calling it &quot;perhaps Psygnosis&#x27; finest hour and a turning point in the puzzle genre.&quot; In 1991, &quot;PC Format&quot; named &quot;Lemmings&quot; one of the 50 best computer games ever. The editors wrote, &quot;Yes, we know it sounds stupid, but you will like it – everyone else has.&quot; In 1994, &quot;PC Gamer US&quot; named &quot;Lemmings&quot; the 30th-best computer game ever. The editors called it &quot;one of the biggest puzzlers ever released for PC&quot; and &quot;cleaner and less complicated&quot; than its sequel. That same year, &quot;PC Gamer UK&quot; named it the 25th-best computer game of all time, calling it &quot;a seminal title.&quot;

In 1998, &quot;PC Gamer&quot; declared it the 21st-best computer game ever released, and the editors called it &quot;as fresh and addictive today as it was when it was first released&quot;. In 2018, Complex listed the game 70th on its &quot;The Best Super Nintendo Games of All Time&quot;. In 1995, Total! ranked the game 81st on their Top 100 SNES Games summarizing: &quot;The game that spawned a dozen imitators is still one of the best platform puzzlers available.&quot;

==Legacy==

&quot;Lemmings&quot; inspired several further games in the franchise, including the &quot;Christmas Lemmings&quot; short games that were released between 1991 and 1994, and the 1991 expansion &quot;Oh No! More Lemmings&quot;. Stand-alone sequels were &quot;Lemmings 2: The Tribes&quot; (1993), &quot;All New World of Lemmings&quot; (1994), &quot;3D Lemmings&quot; (1995) and &quot;Lemmings Revolution&quot; (2000). By mid-1995, &quot;Lemmings&quot; and its sequels had accumulated combined sales of more than 4 million units worldwide. Two spin-off games were also made, both in 1996; &quot;Lemmings Paintball&quot; and &quot;The Adventures of Lomax&quot;. 

The intellectual property (IP) of &quot;Lemmings&quot; stayed with the initial publisher Psygnosis, who were acquired by Sony Computer Entertainment in 1993. Sony gained the IP for &quot;Lemmings&quot; from this acquisition; in 2006 a new game also titled &quot;Lemmings&quot; was released for PlayStation consoles. The next game in the franchise, &quot;Lemmings Touch&quot;, was developed by D3T and released in 2014 for PlayStation Vita. Sony eventually licensed the rights to Exient Entertainment, who published a mobile game &quot;Lemmings: The Puzzle Adventure&quot; in 2018. Exient produced a 30th anniversary documentary of the history of &quot;Lemmings&quot;, released in February 2022.

Numerous clones of &quot;Lemmings&quot; were made, including&quot;The Humans&quot; (1992) and &quot;Pingus&quot; (1998). Other similar games include &quot;Clones&quot; (2009), which was described by the developed as &quot;a multiplayer version of Lemmings&quot;. 
Yannick LeJacq of Kotaku, commenting on the 2014 game &quot;MouseCraft&quot; which incorporates elements of &quot;Lemmings&quot; and &quot;Tetris&quot;, speculated that games like &quot;Lemmings&quot; would not be very successful in the current gaming market, as the pace of the game is far too slow to satisfy most players.

In 2004, Graham Cormode proved that deciding whether it is possible to complete a level of Lemmings is NP-hard. Later, Giovanni Viglietta showed that the task is PSPACE-complete, even for levels where there is only one lemming to save.

In 2010, it was announced that &quot;Lemmings&quot; would be ported to the iOS operating system by developer Mobile 1UP, though Sony Computer Entertainment Europe later presented them with a cease-and-desist letter, forcing them to halt development of the port. Mobile 1UP reworked the game to replace the Lemmings with humans in a prehistoric setting, and instead released the game under the name &quot;Caveman&quot; in 2011. Brutal Deluxe, the developer who did the porting of the Apple IIGS version of &quot;Lemmings&quot;, has released the port&#x27;s source code.

&quot;Lemmings&quot; has also been called a predecessor of the modern real-time strategy (RTS) video game genre. A 1991 &quot;Amiga Power&quot; article claimed that &quot;Lemmings&quot; &quot;was the first major game to introduce the &#x27;indirect-control&#x27; concept,&quot; an element that is now common in many RTS games. Blizzard Entertainment developer Bob Fitch said that part of the inspiration for the first &quot;Warcraft&quot; game, &quot;&quot;, was based on developing a competitive multiplayer RTS that combined elements of &quot;The Lost Vikings&quot; (which he had worked on) and &quot;Lemmings&quot;; Fitch said &quot;We just went, &#x27;Oh it&#x27;s so cool when you see lots of Lemmings all over the place. Why don&#x27;t we have lots of Vikings all over instead, and then the Vikings can fight each other.&quot; &quot;Lemmings&quot;″ introduction of RTS elements has been noted by fantasy author Terry Pratchett; in his novel &quot;Interesting Times&quot;, an army of golems is controlled in a fashion reminiscent of the &quot;Lemmings&quot; user interface. When readers asked if this was deliberate, Pratchett responded: &quot;Merely because the red army can fight, dig, march and climb and is controlled by little icons? Can&#x27;t imagine how anyone thought that... Not only did I wipe &quot;Lemmings&quot; from my hard disk, I overwrote it so I couldn&#x27;t get it back.&quot;

&quot;Lemmings&quot; was one of six games featured in a stamp series issued by the Royal Mail in 2020 to pay tribute to the United Kingdom&#x27;s early video game industry.

<text>The sycamine tree ( &quot;sykaminοs&quot;) is a tree mentioned in both classical Hebrew literature (Isaiah 9:10; Mishnah &quot;Demai&quot; 1:1, &quot;et al.&quot;) and in Greek literature. The tree is also known by the names sycamore fig tree (&quot;Ficus sycomorus&quot;), and fig-mulberry. It appears also in Luke 17:6 and 19:4 of the Bible. The Hebrew word for the tree is &quot;shiḳmah&quot; (sing.) (), &quot;shiḳmīn&quot; (pl.) (), having nearly the same phonemes in Greek ( &quot;sykomorea&quot;) Others, however, identify the tree as mulberry tree, found in two species, the Black Mulberry (&quot;Morus nigra&quot;) and the White Mulberry (&quot;Morus alba&quot;), which are common in Palestine. It is in the same family as the fig-tree.

The bricks are fallen, but we will build with hewn stones; the sycamores are cut down, but cedars will we put in their place.

The trees were once very common along the lowlands and coastal plains of Israel. During the Second Temple period, sycamore fig trees grew in Jericho, but when passers-by would come along and appropriate the tree branches unto themselves, the owners came and dedicated the trees, in their entirety, to the Temple treasury as a dedicatory offering in order to prevent their theft.

The sycamine is a deciduous to semi-deciduous tree and sheds its fruit in a prolific manner, by reason of which the Sages of Israel prohibited a Jewish planter from planting such trees within the radius of 50 cubits from his neighbor&#x27;s cistern.

All sycamines that currently grow in the Land of Israel (&quot;Ficus sycomorus&quot;) are believed to be invasive species, but which are now cultivated in Israel. The tree is native to East Africa. It is thought that the species was once endemic to the Land of Israel. Another species of sycamine endemic to the Horn of Africa, Ethiopia and Yemen is &quot;Ficus vasta&quot;.

<text>Suph is a place name that appears in Deuteronomy 1:1 (R.V. marg. &quot;some ancient versions have the Red Sea,&quot; as in the A.V.).

Some scholars (Patrick, Rosenmüller, and others) identify it with Suphah (Numbers 21:14, quoting the lost Book of the Wars of the Lord) as probably the name of a place. Others identify it with es-Sufah i.e. Maaleh-acrabbim (Joshua 15:3), and yet others with Zuph (1 Samuel 9:5). It is most probable, however, that, in accordance with the ancient versions, this word is to be regarded as simply an abbreviation of Yam Suph i.e. the &quot;Red Sea&quot;.

<text>Acetophenone is the organic compound with the formula C6H5C(O)CH3. It is the simplest aromatic ketone. This colorless, viscous liquid is a precursor to useful resins and fragrances.

==Production==
Acetophenone is formed as a byproduct of the cumene process, the industrial route for the synthesis of phenol and acetone. In the Hock rearrangement of isopropylbenzene hydroperoxide, migration of a methyl group rather than the phenyl group gives acetophenone and methanol as a result of an alternate rearrangement of the intermediate:
The cumene process is conducted on such a large scale that even the small amount of acetophenone by-product can be recovered in commercially useful quantities. 

Acetophenone is also generated from ethylbenzene hydroperoxide. Ethylbenzene hydroperoxide is primarily converted to 1-phenylethanol (α-methylbenzyl alcohol) in the process with a small amount of by-product acetophenone. Acetophenone is recovered or hydrogenated to 1-phenylethanol which is then dehydrated to produce styrene.

==Uses==
===Precursor to resins===
Commercially significant resins are produced from treatment of acetophenone with formaldehyde and a base. The resulting copolymers are conventionally described with the formula , resulting from aldol condensation. These substances are components of coatings and inks. Modified acetophenone-formaldehyde resins are produced by the hydrogenation of the aforementioned ketone-containing resins. The resulting polyol can be further crosslinked with diisocyanates. The modified resins are found in coatings, inks and adhesives.

===Niche uses===
Acetophenone is an ingredient in fragrances that resemble almond, cherry, honeysuckle, jasmine, and strawberry. It is used in chewing gum. 
It is also listed as an approved excipient by the U.S. FDA. 

===Laboratory reagent===
In instructional laboratories, acetophenone is converted to styrene in a two-step process that illustrates the reduction of carbonyls using sodium borohydride and the dehydration of alcohols:
:

A similar two-step process is used industrially, but reduction step is performed by hydrogenation over a copper chromite catalyst:

Being prochiral, acetophenone is also a popular test substrate for asymmetric hydrogenation experiments.

===Drugs===
Acetophenone is used for the synthesis of many pharmaceuticals.

== Natural occurrence ==
Acetophenone occurs naturally in many foods including apple, cheese, apricot, banana, beef, and cauliflower. It is also a component of castoreum, the exudate from the castor sacs of the mature beaver.

== Pharmacology ==
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, acetophenone was used in medicine. It was marketed as a hypnotic and anticonvulsant under brand name Hypnone. The typical dosage was 0.12 to 0.3 milliliters. It was considered to have superior sedative effects to both paraldehyde and chloral hydrate. In humans, acetophenone is metabolized to benzoic acid, carbonic acid, and acetone. Hippuric acid occurs as an indirect metabolite and its quantity in urine may be used to confirm acetophenone exposure, although other substances, like toluene, also induce hippuric acid in urine.

== Toxicity ==
The is 815 mg/kg (oral, rats). Acetophenone is currently listed as a Group D carcinogen indicating that there is no evidence at present that it causes cancer in humans.

<text>The President&#x27;s Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy, known unofficially as the Warren Commission, was established by President Lyndon B. Johnson through on November 29, 1963, to investigate the assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy that had taken place on November 22, 1963.

The U.S. Congress passed Senate Joint Resolution 137 authorizing the Presidential appointed Commission to report on the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, mandating the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence. Its 888-page final report was presented to President Johnson on September 24, 1964, and made public three days later.

It concluded that President Kennedy was assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald and that Oswald acted entirely alone. It also concluded that Jack Ruby acted alone when he killed Oswald two days later. The Commission&#x27;s findings have proven controversial and have been both challenged and supported by later studies.

The Commission took its unofficial name—the Warren Commission—from its chairman, Chief Justice Earl Warren. According to published transcripts of Johnson&#x27;s presidential phone conversations, some major officials were opposed to forming such a commission and several commission members took part only reluctantly. One of their chief reservations was that a commission would ultimately create more controversy than consensus.

==Formation==
The creation of the Warren Commission was a direct consequence of the murder by Jack Ruby of the assassin Lee Harvey Oswald on November 24, 1963, carried live on national television in the basement of the Dallas police station. The lack of a public process addressing the mistakes of the Dallas Police, who concluded that the case was closed, created doubt in the mind of the public.

The new president, Lyndon B. Johnson, himself from Texas, the state where the two assassinations had taken place, found himself faced with the risk of a weakening of his presidency. Confronted with the results obtained by the Texas authorities, themselves seriously discredited and criticized, he decided after various consultations, including in particular that with FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, to create a presidential commission of inquiry by Executive Order 11130 of November 29, 1963. This act made it possible both to avoid an independent investigation led by Congress and to avoid entrusting the case to the Attorney General, Robert F. Kennedy, deeply affected by the assassination, whose federal jurisdiction would have been applied in the event of withdrawal of the share of the State of Texas for the benefit of the federal authorities in Washington.

Nicholas Katzenbach, Deputy Attorney General, provided advice that led to the creation of the Warren Commission. On November 25 he sent a memo to Johnson&#x27;s White House aide Bill Moyers recommending the formation of a Presidential Commission to investigate the assassination. To combat speculation of a conspiracy, Katzenbach said that the results of the FBI&#x27;s investigation should be made public. He wrote: &quot;The public must be satisfied that Oswald was the assassin; that he did not have confederates who are still at large.&quot;

Four days after Katzenbach&#x27;s memo, Johnson appointed to the commission some of the nation&#x27;s most prominent figures, including Earl Warren, Chief Justice of the United States. At first, Warren refused to head of the commission because he stated the principle of law that a member of the judicial power could not be at the service of the executive power. It was only under pressure from President Lyndon Johnson, who spoke of international tensions and the risks of war resulting from the death of his predecessor, that he agreed to chair the commission. The other members of the commission were chosen from among the representatives of the Republican and Democratic parties, in both houses of Congress, and added diplomat John J. McCloy, former president of the World Bank, and former CIA director Allen Dulles.

==Meetings==
The Warren Commission met formally for the first time on December 5, 1963, on the second floor of the National Archives Building in Washington, D.C. The Commission conducted its business primarily in closed sessions, but these were not &quot;secret&quot; sessions.

==Conclusions of the report==
The report concluded that:

# The shots which killed President Kennedy and wounded Governor Connally were fired from the sixth-floor window at the southeast corner of the Texas School Book Depository.
# President Kennedy was first struck by a bullet which entered at the back of his neck and exited through the lower front portion of his neck, causing a wound which would not necessarily have been lethal. The President was struck by a second bullet, which entered the right-rear portion of his head, causing a massive and fatal wound.
# Governor Connally was struck by a bullet which entered on the right side of his back and traveled downward through the right side of his chest, exiting below his right nipple. This bullet then passed through his right wrist and entered his left thigh then it caused a superficial wound.
# There is no credible evidence that the shots were fired from the Triple Underpass, ahead of the motorcade, or from any other location.
# The weight of the evidence indicates that there were three shots fired.
# Although it is not necessary to any essential findings of the Commission to determine just which shot hit Governor Connally, there is very persuasive evidence from the experts to indicate that the same bullet which pierced the President&#x27;s throat also caused Governor Connally&#x27;s wounds. However, Governor Connally&#x27;s testimony and certain other factors have given rise to some difference of opinion as to this probability but there is no question in the mind of any member of the Commission that all the shots which caused the President&#x27;s and Governor Connally&#x27;s wounds were fired from the sixth-floor window of the Texas School Book Depository.
# The shots which killed President Kennedy and wounded Governor Connally were fired by Lee Harvey Oswald.
# Oswald killed Dallas Police Patrolman J. D. Tippit approximately 45 minutes after the assassination.
# Ruby entered the basement of the Dallas Police Department and killed Lee Harvey Oswald and there is no evidence to support the rumor that Ruby may have been assisted by any members of the Dallas Police Department.
# The Commission has found no evidence that either Lee Harvey Oswald or Jack Ruby was part of any conspiracy, domestic or foreign, to assassinate President Kennedy.
# The Commission has found no evidence of conspiracy, subversion, or disloyalty to the U.S. Government by any Federal, State, or local official.
# The Commission could not make any definitive determination of Oswald&#x27;s motives. 
# The Commission believes that recommendations for improvements in Presidential protection are compelled by the facts disclosed in this investigation.

==Death of Lee Harvey Oswald==
In response to Jack Ruby&#x27;s shooting of Lee Harvey Oswald, the Warren Commission declared that the news media must share responsibility with the Dallas police department for &quot;the breakdown of law enforcement&quot; that led to Oswald&#x27;s death. In addition to the police department&#x27;s &quot;inadequacy of coordination&quot;, the Warren Commission noted that &quot;these additional deficiencies [in security] were directly related to the decision to admit newsmen to the basement&quot;.

The commission concluded that the pressure of press, radio, and television for information about Oswald&#x27;s prison transfer resulted in relaxed security standards for admission to the basement, allowing Ruby to enter and subsequently shoot Oswald, noting that &quot;the acceptance of inadequate press credentials posed a clear avenue for a one-man assault.&quot; Oswald&#x27;s death was said to have been a direct result of &quot;the failure of the police to remove Oswald secretly or control the crowd in the basement.&quot;

The consequence of Oswald&#x27;s death, according to the Commission, was that &quot;it was no longer possible to arrive at the complete story of the assassination of John F. Kennedy through normal judicial procedures during the trial of the alleged assassin.&quot; While the Commission noted that the prime responsibility was that of the police department, it also recommended the adoption of a new &quot;code of conduct&quot; for news professionals regarding the collecting and presenting of information to the public that would ensure &quot;there [would] be no interference with pending criminal investigations, court proceedings, or the right of individuals to a fair trial.&quot;

==Aftermath==


===Secret Service===
The findings prompted the Secret Service to make numerous modifications to its security procedures. The Commission made other recommendations to the Congress to adopt new legislation that would make the murder of the President (or Vice-President) a federal crime, which was not the case in 1963.

== Commission records ==
In November 1964, two months after the publication of its 888-page report, the commission published twenty-six volumes of supporting documents, including the testimony or depositions of 552 witnesses and more than 3,100 exhibits making a total of more than 16,000 pages. The Warren Report, however, lacked an index, which greatly complicated the work of reading. It was later endowed with an index by the work of Sylvia Meagher for the report and the twenty-six volumes of documents.

All of the commission&#x27;s records were then transferred on November 23 to the National Archives. The unpublished portion of those records was initially sealed for seventy-five years (to 2039) under a general National Archives policy that applied to all federal investigations by the executive branch of government, a period &quot;intended to serve as protection for innocent persons who could otherwise be damaged because of their relationship with participants in the case.&quot;

The 75-Year Rule no longer exists, supplanted by the Freedom of Information Act of 1966 and the JFK Records Act of 1992. By 1992, ninety-eight percent of the Warren Commission records had been released to the public. Six years later, after the Assassination Records Review Board&#x27;s work, all Warren Commission records, except those records that contained tax return information, were available to the public with redactions.

The remaining Kennedy assassination-related documents were partly released to the public on October 26, 2017, twenty-five years after the passage of the JFK Records Act. President Donald Trump, as directed by the FBI and the CIA, took action on that date to withhold certain remaining files, delaying the release until April 26, 2018, then on April 26, 2018, took action to further withhold the records &quot;until 2021&quot;.

== CIA &quot;benign cover-up&quot; ==

According to a report by the CIA Chief Historian David Robarge (which was released to the public in 2014), CIA Director McCone was complicit in a Central Intelligence Agency &quot;benign cover-up&quot; by withholding information from the Warren Commission. According to this report, CIA officers had been instructed to give only &quot;passive, reactive, and selective&quot; assistance to the commission, to keep the commission focused on &quot;what the Agency believed at the time was the &#x27;best truth&#x27; — that Lee Harvey Oswald, for as yet undetermined motives, had acted alone in killing John Kennedy.&quot; The CIA may have also covered up evidence of being in communication with Oswald before 1963, according to the 2014 report findings.

Also withheld were earlier CIA plots, involving CIA links with the Mafia, to assassinate Cuban president Fidel Castro, which might have been considered to provide a motive to assassinate Kennedy. The report concluded, &quot;In the long term, the decision of John McCone and Agency leaders in 1964 not to disclose information about CIA&#x27;s anti-Castro schemes might have done more to undermine the credibility of the Commission than anything else that happened while it was conducting its investigation.&quot;

== Skepticism ==

In the years following the release of its report and 26 investigatory evidence volumes in 1964, the Warren Commission has been frequently criticized for some of its methods, important omissions, and conclusions. Many independent investigators, journalists, historians, jurists, and academics issued opinions opposing the conclusions of the Warren commission based on the same elements collected by its works. 

These skeptics and their works included Thomas Buchanan, Sylvan Fox, Harold Feldman, Richard E. Sprague, Mark Lane″s &quot;Rush to Judgment&quot;, Edward Jay Epstein″s &quot;Inquest&quot;, Harold Weisberg&#x27;s &quot;Whitewash&quot;, Sylvia Meagher&#x27;s &quot;Accessories After the Fact&quot; or Josiah Thompson&#x27;s &quot;Six Seconds in Dallas&quot;. English historian Hugh Trevor-Roper wrote: &quot;The Warren Report will have to be judged, not by its soothing success, but by the value of its argument. I must admit that from the first reading of the report, it seemed impossible to me to join in this general cry of triumph. I had the impression that the text had serious flaws. Moreover, when probing the weak parts, they appeared even weaker than at first sight.&quot;

In 1992, following popular political pressure in the wake of the film &quot;JFK&quot;, the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) was created by the JFK Records Act to collect and preserve the documents relating to the assassination. In a footnote in its final report, the ARRB wrote: &quot;Doubts about the Warren Commission&#x27;s findings were not restricted to ordinary Americans. Well before 1978, President Johnson, Robert F. Kennedy, and four of the seven members of the Warren Commission all articulated, if sometimes off the record, some level of skepticism about the Commission&#x27;s basic findings.&quot;

== Weak points of the report ==

In its conclusions, the opposition of the summary of the report and the documents constituting the 26 volumes of annexes leading to a falsification of the facts. For example, the Warren Commission argued that direct witnesses to the shooting, who immediately rushed en masse to the grassy knoll after the shots were fired, were fleeing the area of the shooting. In reality, the people present, including a dozen members of the security forces, in particular Sheriff Decker&#x27;s team, who had given the order to investigate the area, all testified that they were running to the search for one or more shooters posted on the grassy Knoll. 

It also did not interview John Fitzgerald Kennedy&#x27;s personal doctor, George Burkley, who was present during the shooting in the convoy of official vehicles then at Parkland Hospital, on board Air Force One, then at Bethesda Naval Hospital during the autopsy. He signed the death certificate and also took delivery of the brain of John Fitzgerald Kennedy which is declared lost in the National Archives. Concerning the conclusions of the Warren commission about the three shots, the practitioner had declared in 1967: &quot;I would not like to be quoted on this subject&quot;.

The ballistic reports conducted by the FBI and the autopsy reports were not the subject of any counter-investigation, which made the commission directly dependent on the work of the latter. The Warren Commission, by decision of Earl Warren, refused to hire its own independent investigators. However, it had its own investigative capacity thanks to direct access to the emergency presidential budget funds granted by President Lyndon Johnson when it was created, to conduct its own investigations. Thus the Warren commission was not informed by the FBI of the discovery the day after the attack, on November 23, 1963, by a medical student, William Harper, of a piece of occiput located at the rear left in relation to at the position of the presidential limo during the fatal shot to the head. He had it examined by the professor and medical examiner, Doctor Cairns who measured it and photographed this piece before informing the FBI, on November 25, 1963. The latter received instructions not to make any publicity on this subject. It was the Attorney General, Robert F. Kennedy, who, informed by a letter from Dr. Cairns transmitted to the Warren Commission, allowed the latter to question the practitioner. The non-use by the members of the Warren Commission of the direct elements of the autopsy such as notes, photos and x-rays. He only used drawings by FBI artists reproducing photographic images.

The revelation by Edward Jay Epstein, in his book &quot;Inquest&quot; published in 1966, that as early as the beginning of 1964, the chief adviser, J. Lee Rankin, had given the outcome of the results of the work of the commission: guilt of Oswald, the latter having acted alone. Even before the creation of the commission, on November 25, 1963, and a few hours after the assassination of Lee Harvey Oswald by Jack Ruby in the premises of the Dallas police, Nicolas Katzenbach, assistant attorney general, had indicated in a memorandum intended of Bill Moyers that: &quot;The public must be convinced that Oswald was the killer; that he had no accomplices still at large; and that evidence was such that he would have been found guilty at trial&quot; creating a political orientation of the results of the investigation, even before the start of the first official investigations and knowledge of the results. Its objective was to cut short the speculations of public opinion either on a plot of communist origin (thesis of the Dallas police) or a plot fomented by the far right to blame the communists (hypothesis defended by the press of communist bloc formed around the USSR).

As early as the 1970s, official members of the Warren Commission questioned its work, in particular Hale Boggs who criticized the influence of J. Edgar Hoover, the director of the FBI from 1924 to 1972, who had centralized all of the information from the FBI agents before synthesizing it and transmitting it to the Warren Commission. He campaigned for a reopening of the file considering that the director of the FBI had lied to the Warren commission. He disappeared in a plane crash in October 1972.

Commission member Richard Russell told the &quot;Washington Post&quot; in 1970 that Kennedy had been the victim of a conspiracy, criticizing the commission&#x27;s no-conspiracy finding and saying &quot;we weren&#x27;t told the truth about Oswald&quot;. John Sherman Cooper also considered the ballistic findings to be &quot;unconvincing&quot;. Russell also particularly rejected Arlen Specter&#x27;s &quot;single bullet&quot; theory, and he asked Earl Warren to indicate his disagreement in a footnote, which the chairman of the commission refused.

== Other investigations ==
Four other U.S. government or senate investigations have been conducted about the Warren Commission&#x27;s conclusion or its material in different circumstances. The Church Committee analyzed in 1976 the work of the CIA and FBI which had communicated the different elements to the Warren Commission Members. The three others concluded with the initial conclusions that two shots struck JFK from the rear: the 1968 panel set by Attorney General Ramsey Clark, the 1975 Rockefeller Commission, and the 1978-79 House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA), which reexamined the evidence with the help of the largest forensics panel and bringing new materials to the public.

=== The Church Committee ===
In 1975, the Church Committee was created per US Senate after the revelations about illegal actions of federal agency as the FBI, CIA and IRS on the territory of the United States of America and after the political Watergate scandal. The Church Committee carried out investigative work on the assassination of John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963, questioning 50 witnesses and accessing 3,000 documents.

It focuses on the necessary actions and the support provided by the FBI and the CIA to the Warren Commission and raises the question of the possible connection between the plans to assassinate political leaders abroad, in particular in relation to Fidel Castro in Cuba, a huge point of international tension in the 1960s, and that of the 35th President of the United States, John F. Kennedy. The Church Committee questioned the process of obtaining the information, blaming federal agencies for failing in their duties and responsibilities and concluding that the investigation into the assassination had been flawed.

The American Senator Richard Schweiker indicated on this subject, in a television interview on June 27, 1976: &quot;The John F. Kennedy assassination investigation was snuffed out before it even began,&quot; and that &quot;the fatal mistake the Warren Commission made was to not use its own investigators, but instead to rely on the CIA and FBI personnel, which played directly into the hands of senior intelligence&quot;&quot;.&quot;

The results of the Church Committee opened the way of the creation of the HSCA, with parallelly the March 6, 1975, first time diffusion on network television in the show &quot;Good Night America&quot; of the Zapruder film, which had been stored by &quot;Life&quot; magazine and never shown to the public during the preceding twenty years.

=== The House Select Committee on Assassinations ===
The HSCA involved Congressional hearings and ultimately concluded that Oswald assassinated Kennedy, probably as the result of a conspiracy. The HSCA concluded that Oswald fired shots number one, two, and four, and that an unknown assassin fired shot number three (but missed) from near the corner of a picket fence that was above and to President Kennedy&#x27;s right front on the Dealey Plaza grassy knoll. However, this conclusion has also been criticized, especially for its reliance upon disputed acoustic evidence. The HSCA Final Report in 1979 did agree with the Warren Report&#x27;s conclusion in 1964 that two bullets caused all of President Kennedy&#x27;s and Governor Connally&#x27;s injuries, and that both bullets were fired by Oswald from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository.

In his September 1978 testimony to the HSCA, President Ford defended the Warren Commission&#x27;s investigation as thorough. Ford stated that knowledge of the assassination plots against Castro may have affected the scope of the Commission&#x27;s investigation but expressed doubt that it would have altered its finding that Oswald acted alone in assassinating Kennedy.

As part of its investigation, the HSCA also evaluated the performance of the Warren Commission, which included interviews and public testimony from the two surviving Commission members (Ford and McCloy) and various Commission legal counsel staff. The Committee concluded in their final report that the Commission was reasonably thorough and acted in good faith, but failed to adequately address the possibility of conspiracy: &quot;...the Warren Commission was not, in some respects, an accurate presentation of all the evidence available to the Commission or a true reflection of the scope of the Commission&#x27;s work, particularly on the issue of possible conspiracy in the assassination.&quot;

The HSCA also pointed to the role of the mafia in the attack because of Cuba. Indeed, the Cuban Castro Revolution of 1959 had caused the criminal organization to lose millions of dollars, which had tried in vain to win the favors of the Cuban leader during the change of regime. In 1959, the income generated by criminal activities amounted to an annual amount of 100 million dollars, i.e. 900 million reported in 2013.

The HSCA determined that the gradual change in policy of the Kennedy administration toward Cuba, first with the failure of the Bay of Pigs Invasion in April 1961, then more sustainably with the missile crisis of October 1962, in order to appease relations with the Cuban regime on a lasting basis and to open up new prospects, contributed to directing, if not slightly, within the many groups of paramilitary operations the most radical fringe of anti-Castro Cubans, American intelligence agents and Mafia criminals who continued their operations to overthrow the regime of Fidel Castro despite requests for formal arrests from the White House. The HSCA invited the Department of Justice to resume investigations. The latter would respond eight years later, arguing the absence of decisive evidence allowing the reopening of an investigation, which is equivalent to supporting the conclusions of Warren report.

== Legacy ==
The findings of the Warren Commission are generally highly criticized, and while the majority of American citizens believe that Oswald shot President Kennedy, the majority also believe that Oswald was part of a conspiracy and therefore do not believe the official thesis defended by the commission. In 1976, 81% of Americans disputed the findings of the Warren Report, 74% in 1983, 75% in 1993 and 2003. In 2009, a CBS poll indicated that 74% of respondents believed there had been an official cover-up by the authorities to keep the general public away from the truth.

<text>A boxing ring, often referred to simply as a ring or the squared circle, is the space in which a boxing match occurs. A modern ring consists of a square raised platform with a post at each corner. Four ropes are attached to the posts and pulled parallel under tension with turnbuckles to form the boundary of the competition area. It also traditionally features a red corner for the higher ranked, more experienced, crowds favorite or home boxer and a blue corner for the lower ranked, less experienced or guest boxer.

==Construction==
As there are a number of professional boxing organizations, the standards of construction vary. A standard ring is between to a side between the ropes with another outside. The platform of the ring is generally from the ground and is covered by about of padding topped by stretched canvas. The ropes are approximately in diameter and at heights of 18, 30, 42, and 54 inches (.46, .76, 1.07, and 1.37 m) above the mat, held up on posts rising around above the mat. The ropes are attached together with spacers that prevent them from spreading too far apart.

Construction of the ring environment extends to maximization of lighting in the ring, minimization of heat of the lighting, and a complete as possible cut-off of illumination at the ringside.

Construction differs from the similar wrestling ring. A wrestling ring sports only three ropes (which may be sheathed steel cable) and is constructed to provide a more flexible mat surface than a boxing ring.

==Terminology==
The name &quot;ring&quot; is a relic from when contests were fought in a roughly drawn circle on the ground. The name ring continued with the London Prize Ring Rules in 1743, which specified a small circle in the centre of the fight area where the boxers met at the start of each round. The first square ring was introduced by the Pugilistic Society in 1838. That ring was specified as square and bound by two ropes. For these and other reasons, the boxing ring is commonly referred to as the &quot;squared circle&quot;. The term &quot;ringside seat&quot; dates as far back as the 1860s.

<text>In phonetics, labiodentals are consonants articulated with the lower lip and the upper teeth, such as and . In English, labiodentalized /s/, /z/ and /r/ are characteristic of some individuals; these may be written .

==Labiodental consonants in the IPA==
The labiodental consonants identified by the International Phonetic Alphabet are:

The IPA chart shades out &quot;labiodental lateral consonants&quot;. This is sometimes read as indicating that such sounds are not possible. In fact, the fricatives and often have lateral airflow, but no language makes a distinction for centrality, and the allophony is not noticeable.

The IPA symbol refers to a sound occurring in Swedish, officially described as similar to the velar fricative [x], but one dialectal variant is a rounded, velarized labiodental, less ambiguously rendered as . The labiodental click is an allophonic variant of the (bi)labial click.

==Occurrence==
The only common labiodental sounds to occur phonemically are the fricatives and the approximant. The labiodental flap occurs phonemically in over a dozen languages, but it is restricted geographically to central and southeastern Africa. With most other manners of articulation, the norm are bilabial consonants (which together with labiodentals, form the class of labial consonants).

 is quite common, but in all or nearly all languages in which it occurs, it occurs only as an allophone of before labiodental consonants such as and . It has been reported to occur phonemically in a dialect of Teke, but similar claims in the past have proven spurious.

The XiNkuna dialect of Tsonga features a pair of affricates as phonemes. In some other languages, such as Xhosa, affricates may occur as allophones of the fricatives. These differ from the German voiceless labiodental affricate , which commences with a bilabial p. All these affricates are rare sounds.

The stops are not confirmed to exist as separate phonemes in any language. They are sometimes written as &quot;ȹ ȸ&quot; &quot;(qp&quot; and &quot;db&quot; ligatures). They may also be found in children&#x27;s speech or as speech impediments.

== consonants==
Dentolabial consonants are the articulatory opposite of labiodentals: They are pronounced by contacting lower teeth against the upper lip. The diacritic for dentolabial in the extensions of the IPA for disordered speech is a superscript bridge, , by analogy with the subscript bridge used for labiodentals: thus . Complex consonants such as affricates, prenasalized stops and the like are also possible.
These are rare cross-linguistically, likely due to the prevalence of dental malocclusions (especially retrognathism) that make them difficult to produce, though the voiceless dentolabial fricative is used in some of the southwestern dialects of Greenlandic.

<doc id="69193" wikidata="Q120443" url="?curid=69193" title="Dental consonant">
<text>A dental consonant is a consonant articulated with the tongue against the upper teeth, such as , . In some languages, dentals are distinguished from other groups, such as alveolar consonants, in which the tongue contacts the gum ridge. Dental consonants share acoustic similarity and in the Latin script are generally written with consistent symbols (e.g. &quot;t&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;n&quot;).

In the International Phonetic Alphabet, the diacritic for dental consonant is . When there is no room under the letter, it may be placed above, using the character , such as in /p͆/.

==Cross-linguistically==
For many languages, such as Albanian, Irish and Russian, velarization is generally associated with more dental articulations of coronal consonants. Thus, velarized consonants, such as Albanian , tend to be dental or denti-alveolar, and non-velarized consonants tend to be retracted to an alveolar position.

Sanskrit, Hindustani and all other Indo-Aryan languages have an entire set of dental stops that occur phonemically as voiced and voiceless and with or without aspiration. The nasal also exists but is quite alveolar and apical in articulation. To native speakers, the English alveolar and sound more like the corresponding retroflex consonants of their languages than like dentals.

Spanish and are denti-alveolar, while and are prototypically alveolar but assimilate to the place of articulation of a following consonant. Likewise, Italian , , , are denti-alveolar (, , , and respectively) and and become denti-alveolar before a following dental consonant.

Although denti-alveolar consonants are often described as dental, it is the point of contact farthest to the back that is most relevant, defines the maximum acoustic space of resonance and gives a characteristic sound to a consonant. In French, the contact that is farthest back is alveolar or sometimes slightly pre-alveolar.

==Occurrence==
Dental/denti-alveolar consonants as transcribed by the International Phonetic Alphabet include:

<doc id="69197" wikidata="Q675306" url="?curid=69197" title="Cenovis">
<text>Cenovis is a dark brown food paste from Switzerland consisting of yeast extract, onions, carrots and spices. Sold internationally under the brand Sonaris, it is similar to English Marmite, Brazilian Cenovit, and Australian Vegemite. It is rich in vitamin B1. It is used to flavour soups, sausages, and salads. The most popular way to consume Cenovis, however, is to spread it on a slice of buttered bread, as stated on the product&#x27;s packaging (it can also be blended directly into butter, and then spread on bread, or used as a filling in croissants and buns).

The company does not disclose whether the Swiss Cenovis was a licensed product from the older German one. In contrast to comparable yeast extracts, the Swiss Cenovis, similar to Thomy mustard, was sold in tubes early on and is somewhat lighter and more liquid.

== Protein versus vitamin ==
Since the beginning of the 20th century many attempts to turn brewer&#x27;s yeast into food have been made. The main reason being its availability and nutritional physiology. The English Marmite (1902) and the Australian Vegemite (1922) became successful as products. 1912 Casimir Funk discovered an active ingredient against deficiency diseases which he called vitamin. The high thiamine content (vitamin B1) then became the quality of nutritional yeast that was more effective in advertising than its protein content, which had been known for a long time.

== Origins in Germany ==
In 1915, Cenovis Nahrungsmittelwerke GmbH was founded in Munich as a brewer&#x27;s yeast and malt factory, which also produced by-products of these products and other foods such as oatmeal and baking powder, making it one of Maggi&#x27;s main competitors. The German Cenovis vitamin extract was available from around 1920 in jars labeled &quot;unbegrenzt haltbar&quot; (unlimited shelf life).

The image of the Cenovis products was associated with the life reform movement (from which the Reformhäuser emerged). It was reported in 1921 that the Cenovis yeast extract consisted of cleaned and de-bittered brewer&#x27;s yeast and had a honey-like consistency. It has a &quot;similar, only finer taste than Liebig&#x27;s meat extract&quot;. The founder and main shareholder of Cenovis, Julius Schülein, a son of the brewery owner Joseph Schülein, reports in his book from 1938 (the year when his Munich company was expropriated by Aryanization and he emigrated to the USA) about an Cenovis vitamin yeast produced in Switzerland. In the same year, the Australian trademark Cenovis was established.

== Swiss manufacturing ==
Cenovis is popular in Switzerland (particularly Romandie). It was developed in Rheinfelden in 1931, on the initiative of a master brewer named Alex Villinger. Since 1935, they have been producing Cenovis extract alongside brewer&#x27;s yeast and other by-products. In 1955, Cenovis became part of the Swiss Army&#x27;s survival ration. In 1965, Vitamin-Hefe AG acquired all of the word marks and manufacturing processes from Cenovis-Werke GmbH in Munich. The foreign trademark rights were sold to the Hügli Group in Steinach SG. The Heirler Cenovis GmbH that emerged from it has a similar range of products as the Munich Cenovis of the time.

== Revival ==
Cenovis yeast extract was developed during times of economic crisis, aimed at replacing meat products like sausages. It is economical, long-lasting without refrigeration, and shares similarities with the Australian spread Vegemite. However, unlike Vegemite, which has become a staple in the harsh environment of the Australian outback, Cenovis has seen a decline in sales in Switzerland. In German-speaking Switzerland, it remains popular among the older generation, while in French-speaking Switzerland, it only gained traction after being relaunched by Michel Yagchi in 1999, with the help of Didier Fischer and Frank Guemara, who applied modern marketing techniques to rejuvenate the brand.

On 29 February 2008, Michel Yagchi transferred the brand, acquired in 1999, to Gustav Gerig AG, an Aargau company, and the product thereby returned to its canton of origin.

Cenovis has been manufactured by Sonaris AG in Arisdorf BL since 2008. Sonaris AG was founded in Rheinfelden AG in 1997 as the successor company to Leiber Vitamin-Hefe AG. From then on, the production rights for the production of the Cenovis extract were held by the company Sonaris AG, which relocated its headquarters from Rheinfelden to Arisdorf in 2003. In 2008, Cenovis&#x27; Swiss trademark rights were bought back by Sonaris AG. International distribution, notably in France, uses the Sonaris brand instead. In 2013, the two companies Cenovis AG and Sonaris AG merged to form today&#x27;s Cenovis AG, based in Arisdorf.

The company presents the following story behind Cenovis:
&quot;In 1931, a brewer recycled the yeast used for the fermentation of beer: vegetal substances very rich in vitamin B1. After several tests, the product was perfected and a group of Swiss brewers launched Cenovis; the product was an immediate success and the famous spread was so good that from 1955 it was included in the rations for Swiss soldiers... Healthy and strong soldiers!&quot;

<text>A spiritual gift or charism (plural: charisms or charismata; in Greek singular: 
, plural: χαρίσματα ) is an extraordinary power given by the Holy Spirit. These are believed by followers to be supernatural graces that individual Christians need to fulfill the mission of the Church. In the narrowest sense, it is a theological term for the extraordinary graces given to individual Christians for the good of others and is distinguished from the graces given for personal sanctification, such as the Seven Gifts of the Holy Spirit and the fruit of the Holy Spirit.

These abilities, often termed &quot;charismatic gifts&quot;, are the word of knowledge, increased faith, the gifts of healing, the gift of miracles, prophecy, the discernment of spirits, and speaking in tongues. To these are added the gifts of apostles, prophets, teachers, helps (connected to service of the poor and sick), and governments (or leadership ability) which are connected with certain offices in the Church. These gifts are given by the Holy Spirit to individuals, but their purpose is to build up the entire Church. They are described in the New Testament, primarily in 1 Corinthians 12, 13 and 14, Romans 12, and Ephesians 4. 1 Peter 4 also touches on the spiritual gifts.

The gifts are related to both seemingly &quot;natural&quot; abilities and seemingly more &quot;miraculous&quot; abilities, empowered by the Holy Spirit. The two major opposing theological positions on their nature are that they ceased long ago or that they continue, which is the dispute of cessationism versus continuationism.

==Biblical and theological overview==
The New Testament contains several lists of spiritual gifts, most in the Pauline epistles. While each list is unique, there is overlap.

Christians believe that the &quot;charismata&quot; were foretold in the Book of Joel () and promised by Christ (Gospel of Mark ). This promise was fulfilled on the Day of Pentecost and elsewhere as the church spread. In order to correct abuses concerning the spiritual gifts at Corinth, Paul devoted much attention to spiritual gifts in his First Epistle to the Corinthians (chapters 12–14).

In 1 Corinthians 12, two Greek terms are translated as &quot;spiritual gifts&quot;. In verse 1, the word &quot;pneumatika&quot; (&quot;spirituals&quot; or &quot;things of the Spirit&quot;) is used. In verse 4, &quot;charisma&quot; is used. This word is derived from the word &quot;charis&quot;, which means &quot;grace&quot;. In verses 5 and 6, the words &quot;diakonia&quot; (translated &quot;administrations&quot;, &quot;ministries&quot;, or &quot;service&quot;) and &quot;energemata&quot; (&quot;operations&quot; or &quot;inworkings&quot;) are used in describing the nature of the spiritual gifts. In verse 7, the term &quot;manifestation (&quot;phanerosis&quot;) of the Spirit&quot; is used.

From these scriptural passages, Christians understand the spiritual gifts to be enablements or capacities that are divinely bestowed upon individuals. Because they are freely given by God, these cannot be earned or merited. Though worked through individuals, these are operations or manifestations of the Holy Spirit—not of the gifted person. They are to be used for the benefit of others, and in a sense they are granted to the church as a whole more than they are given to individuals. There is diversity in their distribution—an individual will not possess all of the gifts. The purpose of the spiritual gifts is to edify (build up), exhort (encourage), and comfort the church.

It is generally acknowledged that Paul did not list all of the gifts of the Spirit, and many believe that there are as many gifts as there are needs in the body of Christ. The gifts have at times been organized into distinct categories based on their similarities and differences to other gifts. Some divide them into three categories using Old Testament offices. &quot;Prophetic&quot; gifts include any gift involving teaching, encouraging, or rebuking others. &quot;Priestly&quot; gifts include showing mercy and care for the needy or involve intercession before God. &quot;Kingly&quot; gifts are those involving church administration or government. Others categorize them into &quot;gifts of knowledge&quot; (word of wisdom, word of knowledge, distinguishing between spirits), &quot;gifts of speech&quot; (tongues, interpretation, prophecy), and &quot;gifts of power&quot; (faith, healing, miracles). The gifts have also been categorized as those that promote the inner growth of the church (apostle, prophecy, distinguishing between spirits, teaching, word of wisdom/knowledge, helps, and administration) and those that promote the church&#x27;s outer development (faith, miracles, healing, tongues, interpretation of tongues).

Proponents of cessationism distinguish between the &quot;extraordinary&quot;, &quot;miraculous&quot;, or &quot;sign&quot; gifts (such as prophecy, tongues, and healing) and the other gifts. Cessationism is held by some Protestants, especially from the Calvinist tradition, who believe that miraculous gifts and their operations were limited to early Christianity and &quot;ceased&quot; afterward. Other Protestants, including Lutheran, Methodist, Pentecostals and charismatics, adhere to the continuationist position, believing that all the spiritual gifts are distributed among Christians by the Holy Spirit and that they are normative in contemporary Christendom. In addition, Roman Catholicism
and the Eastern Orthodox Church also continue to believe in and make use of all of the spiritual gifts.

==Descriptions==
Apostle: The title apostle comes from the Greek word &quot;apostolos&quot; which means &quot;a messenger, one sent forth with orders&quot;. It refers to one who has been delegated authority by another in a foreign land. Apostles were the first leaders of the Church; they were commissioned by Jesus to initiate and direct the preaching of the gospel. While many Christians agree that the title of apostle is reserved for those among the first generation of Christians, many Christian denominations continue in one way or another to recognize a continuing apostolic ministry. Many churches, such as the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Churches, believe in the doctrine of apostolic succession, which holds that properly ordained bishops are the successors to the apostles. Only bishops have the charism certain of the truth (in Latin: &quot;charisma veritatis certum&quot;), which is the faculty to establish undoubtedly a truth in matter of faith or morality or concerning the Holy Scripture. Other Christian groups, such as classical Pentecostals, consider the role of a missionary to be fulfilling an apostolic ministry. There are some Christians, however, who advocate restoring the Fivefold ministry, including the formal recognition of the office of apostle. Others would say that the office no longer exists.

Prophet: In the New Testament, the office of prophet is to equip the saints for the work of service through exhortation, edification, and consolation (1 Corinthians 12:28; 1 Corinthians 14:3 Ephesians 4:11). The prophet&#x27;s corresponding gift is prophecy. Prophecy is &quot;reporting something that God spontaneously brings to your mind&quot;. Many, particularly Pentecostals and charismatics, distinguish between the &quot;office of prophet&quot; and the &quot;gift of prophecy&quot;, believing that a Christian can possess the gift of prophecy without holding the prophetic office.

Prophecy has been addressed to the human understanding “he who prophesies speaks to men,” Cor 14:1-25. The prophet “edifies the church” (14:4).

Evangelist: An evangelist is one who devotes himself to preaching the gospel. In the New Testament, evangelists preached from city to city, church to church.

Pastor: This term derives from a Greek word for &quot;shepherd&quot;. In theory pastors are gifted to lead, guide, and set an example for other Christians. The grammatical structure of Ephesians 4:11 leads many to conclude that teacher and pastor should be considered one term (pastor-teacher). Even so, the two terms are not interchangeable; while all pastors are teachers, not all teachers are pastors. Pastoral Gifts include integrity and compassion.

Teacher: Someone who devotes his or her life to preaching and teaching the Christian faith. When teaching is provided for the Church by God, two gifts are actually given—to the Church is given a teacher and along with the teacher comes a divine capacity to teach.

Service: The word translated as &quot;ministry&quot; is &quot;diakonia&quot;, which can also be translated &quot;service&quot;. Since there are many types of ministries and service to the Church, this then describes a broad array of gifts rather than a single gift.

Exhortation: The ability to motivate Christians &quot;to patient endurance, brotherly love, and good works&quot;.

Giving: Those with this gift share their own possessions with others with extraordinary generosity. While all Christians should be givers, those possessing this gift will go beyond this normal giving.

Leading: This gift speaks to the various leadership roles found in the Church. While many think of roles such as administration, management of funds, strategy planning, etc. as functions outside of the supernatural realm, in reality individuals in these positions are just as in need of supernatural empowerment as are ministers of the gospel. Some writers consider the gifts of governments and leading to be the same gift, but others consider them closely related yet different.

Mercy: Possibly identical to the gift of helps, the mercy-shower possesses a ministry of visitation, prayer, and compassion to the poor and sick.

Word of wisdom: An utterance or message of wisdom supernaturally granted to an individual. For Paul, wisdom refers to &quot;the knowledge of the great Christian mysteries: the Incarnation, Passion, and Resurrection of Christ, and the indwelling in the believer of the Spirit of God (1 Corinthians 2; Ephesians 1:17)&quot;.

Word of knowledge: The knowledge referred to is often said to relate to understanding Christian doctrine or scriptural truth. It is sometimes said to be connected with the ministry of teachers.

Faith: This refers to that strong or special faith &quot;which removes mountains, casts out devils (Matthew 17:19–20), and faces the most cruel martyrdom without flinching&quot;. It is distinguished from the &quot;saving&quot; and &quot;normal&quot; Christian faith.

Gifts of healings: The ability to supernaturally minister healing to others. The plural indicates the variety of sickness healed and the many forms the gift takes, such as healing by anointing with oil, by the laying on of hands, by saying the name of Jesus or by the sign of the cross.

Working of miracles: The performance of deeds beyond ordinary human ability by the power of the Holy Spirit.

Visions. An outpouring of this gift is prophesied in Joel 2:28 and Acts 2:17 shows that early Christians believed this prophecy was fulfilled on the day of Pentecost. Visions tend to be more private experiences than the other gifts. Some researchers expand the definition of visions to include a strongly felt presence.

Discerning of spirits: The capacity to discern, distinguish, or to discriminate the source of a spiritual manifestation—whether it emanates from a good or evil spirit. It seemed to have been particularly associated with prophecy as it would be necessary to know whether a prophetic utterance was truly inspired by God.

Tongues: The supernatural ability of speaking an unlearned language. Paul seems to have distinguished between the public use of the gift (which must always be interpreted) and the private use which was for the spiritual strengthening of oneself. Currently among Christians there is a dispute as to whether tongues were/are always xenoglossy (speaking an unlearned human language) or whether it also included/includes glossolalia (speaking an unlearned and allegedly non-human language of heavenly or angelic origin).

Interpretation of tongues: This gift ought always follow the public exercise of the gift of tongues. In 1 Corinthians 14, the Apostle Paul required that all speech in Christian worship should be intelligible. This required that speech given in an unknown tongue be interpreted in the common language of the gathered Christians.

Helps: This gift has to do with service to the sick and the poor. Possessors of this gift have a &quot;spiritual burden and a God-given love for the needy and afflicted&quot;.

Administration: Also called the gift of governing, the Greek word translated &quot;governments&quot; is &quot;kubernesis&quot;, the verb form of which means &quot;to steer&quot; or &quot;to be a helmsman&quot;. This gift then refers to the God-given capacity to lead or guide the Church through storms and difficult seas.

==Other spiritual gifts==
While not specifically defined as spiritual gifts in the Bible, other abilities and capacities have been considered as spiritual gifts by some Christians. Some are found in the New Testament such as:
* celibacy ()
* fellowship
* hospitality ()
* intercession ()
* marriage ()
* (effective) witnessing (Acts 1:8, 5:32, 26:22, )

Others are found in the Old Testament such as:
* craftsmanship (such as the special abilities given to artisans who constructed the Tabernacle in Exodus 35:30–33)
* interpretation of dreams (e.g. Joseph and Daniel) in Genesis 43-50, Daniel 2
* composing spiritual music, poetry, and prose

== Social meaning ==
The word is also used in secular circumstances within social psychology. In that context, charism is defined as personal influence on other people individually or as a group.

Religious orders (including Anglican, Catholic, Lutheran and Methodist) use the word &quot;charism&quot; to describe their spiritual orientation and any special characteristics of their mission or values that might be exhibited as a result of the vows that they have taken and the orientation of the order to which they belong. An example might be the works of a teaching order compared to that of a missionary order or one devoted to the care of the poor or the sick and those in need of help.

<text>Pavlovo Bus Factory (, formerly , Pavlovsky Avtobusny Zavod or PAZ) is a manufacturer of buses in Russia, in the city of
Pavlovo, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast. PAZ is a subsidiary of Russian Buses which is a division of GAZ.

Pavlovo Bus Factory specializes in designing and manufacturing buses of the small/medium class (length 9.7 m). Buses are the most common plant in Russia, their annual output is over 10,000 units, almost 80% of small buses in Russia. The small PAZ buses have long been used by Russian &quot;fixed-route taxi&quot; (&quot;marshrutka&quot;) operators.

Starting in 2015, the GAZ Group introduced a single brand for all its bus manufacturing subsidiaries, and newly manufactured vehicles now feature the deer badge of the GAZ company.

==History==
The factory has its origins in the ZATI automobile and tractor tool plant, established in Pavlovo in 1932. The building of the factory started in 1952, and in the same year the first PAZ-651 long-hood buses (based on the GAZ-51 general-purpose lorry) were produced. The government had a plan to produce 10,000 buses per year. In 1960, the production of new PAZ-652 forward control model on the same chassis started. It was replaced by the outwardly similar PAZ-672 (based on the GAZ-53 lorry) in early 1968, and this bus had a large family of various modifications. 1989 saw a start of production of the new PAZ-3205 model having basically the same chassis but a completely new body.

<doc id="69206" wikidata="Q1578308" url="?curid=69206" title="FSO Syrena">
<text>The Syrena was a Polish automobile model first exhibited at the Poznań Trade Fair in 1955 and manufactured from 1957 to 1972 by the &quot;Fabryka Samochodów Osobowych&quot; (FSO) in Warsaw and from 1972 until 1983 by &quot;Fabryka Samochodów Małolitrażowych&quot; (FSM) in Bielsko-Biała. 177,234 were manufactured by FSO and 344,077 by FSM, a total of 521,311. During its remarkably long production run it underwent only minor modifications.

The Syrena was produced in various models: 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, while the most popular model was the 105. All were two-door sedans with two-stroke engines, initially of two cylinders. In 1965 the Syrena received a larger three-cylinder engine.

From 1968 a prototype model named &quot;laminat&quot; was produced. A van called Syrena Bosto and a pick-up called the R20 were also produced. A coupé Syrena Sport and a hatchback Syrena 110 (in 1966) remained prototypes only.

A &quot;Siren&quot; is a mermaid who, according to the legend, protects the river Vistula and the Polish capital city, Warsaw. She is featured on the city&#x27;s coat of arms. Also a diminutive name &quot;Syrenka&quot; (little siren) is commonly used for the car in Poland.

== History ==
At first, Polish engineers wanted Syrena to have a four-stroke air-cooled engine and a self-supporting chassis. But due to a lack of deep-drawn metal parts and cost reductions, the first Syrena 100 cars were supposed to have a wooden bodywork covered with leather-like material. The cars were powered by 2-stroke engines designed by engineer Fryderyk Bluemke. The first two prototypes of Syrena were made in December 1953. One – with a wooden framework, was constructed by Stanisław Panczakiewicz, while the second, steel-bodied car was made by Stanisław Łukaszewicz. They met halfway by combining the first car&#x27;s design with the steel bodywork of the second one (with one exception – the roof remained wooden). By March 1955 FSO had built 5 prototypes of Syrena 100.

In September all of the prototypes took part in an experimental rally covering a distance of 5600 km. One of the cars, driven by Karol Pionnier, crashed, revealing the weak structure of the roof. As a result, the engineers decided to use steel instead of wood for this part of the car. One of the prototypes was exhibited at the Poznań Trade Fair in autumn 1955. On 20 March 1957 the mass production of Syrena 100 started.
=== Syrena 100 ===
Syrena 100 was designed by engineers Stanislaw Lukasiewicz, Stanisław Panczakiewicz and Fryderyk Bluemke. The chassis and running gear was copied from the DKW. It was introduced to the public in June 1955 at the 24th Poznań Trade Fair. The car aroused much interest, which prompted the government to put it into production. At first, the production rate was to be 10,000 cars a year. Because of financial reasons, Syrena 100 and the much larger Warszawa automobile shared many parts. As a result, the Syrena was much heavier than intended (950 kg).
=== Syrena 101 ===

In 1960 Syrena underwent a first, minor modernisation. The improved car had a pneumatic fuel pump and a different type of carburetor. It also received new twin windscreen wipers and a better suspension.
=== Syrena 102 ===

The Syrena 102, produced in 1962 and 1963, had slightly different body details. The &quot;S&quot; version of this model shared an engine with Wartburg 312. Around 150 examples of Syrena 102S were produced.
=== Syrena 103 ===

Syrena 103 (1963–66) had a restyled front and a different engine.
=== Syrena 104 ===

The next model lasted from 1966 to 1972. It had a new, three-cylinder engine, a synchronized gearbox and restyled tail lights.
=== Syrena 105 ===

The 105 was the last Syrena design. It was produced from 1972 to 1983 by the FSM factory and was badged accordingly. Unlike its predecessors it had regular front doors instead of &quot;suicide&quot; ones. The &quot;Lux&quot; version, produced from 1974, had the gear lever and handbrake between the front seats. The 105 served as a basis for two other models – Syrena R-20, which was a pick-up and a van – Bosto.
A 1983 FSM Syrena 105L finished in yellow was featured in series 10 episode 10 of the British television program &quot;Wheeler Dealers&quot;. Presenter Mike Brewer purchased the car in Poland for zł7,000 (the equivalent of £1,400) and drove it back to the show&#x27;s UK-based workshop where it underwent repairs and upgrades by mechanic Edd China. The colour was changed to red and white in homage to the Polish flag. Other work included upgrades to the steering box, refurbishing the drum brakes, replacing the dynamo with an alternator and replacing the radio. The total cost of procuring and upgrading the car reached £5454. The completed car was driven to the Polish embassy where ambassador Witold Sobków took a ride with them. The car was later sold for £8,000 to the bubble car museum in Lincolnshire.

== Syrena Bosto==
The Syrena Bosto panel van and its pickup truck sister, the Syrena R-20, were first introduced to the 104 models of the Syrena. The name is an acronym of &quot;Bielski Osobowo-Towarowy&quot;, or &quot;Passenger-Cargo [car] of Bielsko.&quot; The first model of the Bosto was revealed in December 1971, at the newly constructed FSM factory in Bielsko-Biala in southern Poland. The final model finished production 30 April 1983. Overall, approximately 135,000 Bostos were built.

The Bosto 104B started official production in 1972, and was available as a four-seater van, capable of carrying 200 kg of freight, or as a two-seater cab with a 350 kg load rating. The second edition, Syrena Bosto 105B, replaced the 104 in 1976. Essentially the same vehicle stylistically, the differences were in construction. Uprated semi-elliptical springs from the FSO Warszawa, an increased fuel tank borrowed from the FSO 125p, and the handbrake moved to the &quot;standard&quot; position between the front seats were the main modifications. As with the Syrena saloon the 3-cylinder, 2-stroke engine was mounted longitudinally in front of the front axle and powered the front wheels through a gearbox with driveshafts coming sideways out of it.

The driver&#x27;s compartment was separated from the rear load space by a single sheet bulkhead, and additional roof-fixed netting. Because the Bosto was designed for heavy loads, as opposed to the sedan version of the Syrena, the suspension underneath was modified. An extended chassis held a rear trailing axle on leaf suspension, each with a hydraulic suspension damper. This allowed a lower floor level, and in turn allowed FSM to borrow directly parts from the Zuk A05/A06.

===Dimensions===
Weight: 950 kg
Wheelbase: 2300mm
Length: 39650mm
Rear Compartment: H-1600 mm x W-1470 mm

==Syrena Sport==
In 1960 a prototype Syrena Sport was produced with a fibreglass body and a four-stroke two-cylinder engine. However, this model was not put into production.

<doc id="69207" wikidata="Q35987" url="?curid=69207" title="Pistacia">
<text>Pistacia is a genus of flowering plants in the cashew family, Anacardiaceae. It contains 10 to 20 species that are native to Africa and Eurasia from the Canary Islands, all of Africa, and southern Europe, warm and semidesert areas across Asia, and North America from Guatemala to Mexico, as well as southern Texas.

==Description==
&quot;Pistacia&quot; plants are shrubs and small trees growing to tall. The leaves are alternate, pinnately compound, and can be either evergreen or deciduous depending on species. All species are dioecious, but monoecious individuals of &quot;Pistacia atlantica&quot; have been noted. The genus is estimated to be about 80 million years old.

It is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Anacardiaceae. The plants are dioecious, and have male and female trees independently; a viable population should have both sexes.

Well-known species in the genus &quot;Pistacia&quot; include &quot;P. vera&quot;, the pistachio, grown for its edible seeds; &quot;P. terebinthus&quot;, from which terebinth resin, a turpentine, is produced; &quot;P. lentiscus&quot;, source of the plant resin mastic; and &quot;P. chinensis&quot;, the Chinese pistache, cultivated as an ornamental tree.

=== &quot;P. vera&quot; genome ===
Scientists from Iran and China assembled a draft genome of pistachio and resequenced 107 whole genomes, including 93 domestic and 14 wild individuals of &quot;P. vera&quot; and 35 other genomes from different wild &quot;Pistacia&quot; species. Integrating genomic and transcriptomic analyses revealed expanded gene families (e.g., cytochrome P450 and chitinase) and the jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthetic pathway that are likely involved in stress adaptation. Comparative population genomic analyses revealed that pistachio was domesticated about 8000 years ago, and that likely key genes for domestication are those involved in tree and seed size, which experienced artificial selection.

== Species ==
&quot;Bursera simaruba&quot; was formerly classified as &quot;P. simaruba&quot; 

==Ecology==
The &quot;Pistacia&quot; species are vicarious Anacardiaceae with few species outside the Old World, and are mostly more adapted to water shortage and alkaline soil.

Many plant species are adapted to desert or summer drought typical of Mediterranean climate, so have a high tolerance to saline soil. They grow well in water containing up to 0.3 to 0.4% of soluble salts. They are quite resilient in their ecological requirements, and can survive in temperatures ranging from −10 °C in winter to 45 °C in summer. They prefer places oriented toward the sun and well-drained soil, but grow well in the bottom of ravines. Though very hardy and drought resistant, &quot;Pistacia&quot; species grow slowly and only begin to bear fruit after about 7–10 years from planting, obtaining full development only after 15–20 years. The fruit ripens in the Mediterranean from August; only female trees have fruit.

Although some species prefer moderate humidity, they do not grow well in high-humidity conditions. They are susceptible to root rot, molds, and fungi, and parasites attack if they receive too much water and the soil has insufficient drainage. They require a period of drought each year for proper development.
Their leaves are intensely bright green and leathery, with three to nine leaflets. The leaves are alternate, compound, and paripinnate.
The flowers are unisexual, apetalous, and grouped in clusters. The flowers range from purple to green. The fruit is a drupe, generally unpalatable to humans, the size of a pea, and red to brown in color, depending on the degree of maturation. The seeds do not have endosperm.
The seeds are eaten and dispersed by birds, for which they are a valuable resource because of the scarcity of food in some important times of year, as the time of breeding, migration, or the dry season. The commercial species of pistachio has larger fruits and is edible.

The plants emit a bitter, resinous, or medicative smell, which in some species is very intense and aromatic. Some species develop &quot;galls&quot; that occur in the leaves and leaflets after the bite of insects. Although marred by the presence of galls, they are very vigorous and resistant plants that survive in degraded areas where other species have been eliminated. They multiply by seeds, stolons, and root shoots. Various species hybridize easily between them, and hybrid plants are difficult to identify.

Some tree species (e.g. &quot;Pistacia aethiopica&quot;, &quot;Pistacia atlantica&quot;) can exist as small bushes and shrubs due to the extremes of their habitat, adverse conditions, or the excessive consumption by wildlife or livestock that hinders growth.

&quot;Pistacia lentiscus&quot; is a very common plant related to &quot;P. terebinthus&quot; with which it hybridizes. &quot;P. terebinthus&quot; is more abundant in the mountains and inland in the Iberian Peninsula, and mastic is usually found more frequently in areas where the Mediterranean influence of the sea prevents or moderates frost. Some species with very small ranges cover only one or a group of islands in the Mediterranean. &quot;P. terebinthus&quot; is also found on the east coast of the Mediterranean, Syria, Lebanon, and Israel, filling the same ecological niche of these species. On the west coast of the Mediterranean, the Canary Islands, and the Middle East, it can be confused with &quot;Pistacia atlantica&quot;.

&quot;Pistacia&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae (caterpillars) of some species of Lepidoptera including the emperor moth.

==Cultivation and uses==
Best known as the pistachio, &quot;P. vera&quot; is a small tree native to Iran, grown for its edible seeds. The seeds of the other species were also eaten in prehistory, but are too small to have commercial value today. Records of &quot;Pistacia&quot; from preclassical archaeological sites, and mentions in preclassical texts, always refer to one of these other species (often &quot;P. terebinthus&quot;).

&quot;P. terebinthus&quot; (the terebinth), also a native of Iran, and the western Mediterranean countries, is tapped for turpentine. It is also common in the eastern Mediterranean countries. Because terebinths have the ability to kill certain bacteria, terebinth resin was widely used as a preservative in ancient wine. In the Zagros Mountains of Iran, in one of the earliest examples of winemaking, archaeologists discovered terebinth resin deposits from 5400 to 5000 BC in jars that also contained grape-juice residue.

&quot;P. lentiscus&quot;, an evergreen shrub or small tree of the Mediterranean region, supplies a resin called mastic.

&quot;P. chinensis&quot; (Chinese pistache), the most frost-tolerant species in the genus, is grown as an ornamental tree, valued for its bright red autumn leaf colour.

<text>Sosthenes (Greek: Σωσθένης, &quot;Sōsthénēs&quot;, &quot;safe in strength&quot;) was the chief ruler of the synagogue at Corinth, who, according to the Acts of the Apostles, was seized and beaten by the mob in the presence of Gallio, the Roman governor, when Gallio refused to proceed against Paul at the instigation of the Jews (). The motives of this assault against Sosthenes are not recorded. Some manuscripts assert the mob was composed of &quot;Greeks&quot;; others read &quot;Jews&quot;.

Some historians identify this Sosthenes with a companion of Paul the Apostle referred to as &quot;Sosthenes our brother&quot; (, &quot;Sōsthénēs ho adelphós&quot;, literally &quot;Sosthenes &quot;the&quot; brother&quot;), a convert to the Christian faith and co-author of the First Epistle to the Corinthians (). It is not clear whether this identification is tenable. According to Protestant theologian Heinrich Meyer, &quot;Theodoret and most commentators, including Flatt, Billroth, Ewald, Maier [and] Hofmann, identify Sosthenes with the person so named in Acts 18:17, but this is denied by Michaelis, Pott, Rückert, and de Wette&quot;. The name was a common one.

It has also been suggested that Sosthenes is a later name of Crispus, who is mentioned in Acts 18:8 and 1 Corinthians 1:14, but Strong and McClintock say this &quot;is arbitrary and unsupported&quot;. 

He is traditionally listed among the Seventy Disciples of .

<doc id="69209" wikidata="Q757410" url="?curid=69209" title="Semivowel">
<text>In phonetics and phonology, a semivowel, glide or semiconsonant is a sound that is phonetically similar to a vowel sound but functions as the syllable boundary, rather than as the nucleus of a syllable. Examples of semivowels in English are &quot;y&quot; and &quot;w&quot; in &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;west&quot;, respectively. Written in IPA, &quot;y&quot; and &quot;w&quot; are near to the vowels &quot;ee&quot; and &quot;oo&quot; in &quot;seen&quot; and &quot;moon,&quot; written in IPA. The term &quot;glide&quot; may alternatively refer to any type of transitional sound, not necessarily a semivowel.

==Classification==
Semivowels form a subclass of approximants. Although &quot;semivowel&quot; and &quot;approximant&quot; are sometimes treated as synonymous, most authors use the term &quot;semivowel&quot; for a more restricted set; there is no universally agreed-upon definition, and the exact details may vary from author to author. For example, do not consider the labiodental approximant to be a semivowel.

In the International Phonetic Alphabet, the diacritic attached to non-syllabic vowel letters is an inverted breve placed below the symbol representing the vowel: . When there is no room for the inverted breve under a symbol, it may be written above, using . Before 1989, non-syllabicity was represented by , which now stands for extra-shortness.

Additionally, there are dedicated symbols for four semivowels that correspond to the four close cardinal vowel sounds:

In addition, some authors consider the rhotic approximants , to be semivowels corresponding to R-colored vowels such as . An unrounded central semivowel, (or ), equivalent to , is uncommon, though rounded (or ), equivalent to , is found in Swedish and Norwegian.

==Contrast with vowels==
Semivowels, by definition, contrast with vowels by being non-syllabic. In addition, they are usually shorter than vowels. In languages such as Amharic, Yoruba, and Zuni, semivowels are produced with a narrower constriction in the vocal tract than their corresponding vowels. Nevertheless, semivowels may be phonemically equivalent with vowels. For example, the English word &quot;fly&quot; can be considered either as an open syllable ending in a diphthong or as a closed syllable ending in a consonant .

It is unusual for a language to contrast a semivowel and a diphthong containing an equivalent vowel, but Romanian contrasts the diphthong with , a perceptually similar approximant-vowel sequence. The diphthong is analyzed as a single segment, and the approximant-vowel sequence is analyzed as two separate segments.

In addition to phonological justifications for the distinction (such as the diphthong alternating with in singular-plural pairs), there are phonetic differences between the pair:
* has a greater duration than 
*The transition between the two elements is longer and faster for than with the former having a higher F2 onset (greater constriction of the articulators).

Although a phonological parallel exists between and , the production and perception of phonetic contrasts between the two is much weaker, likely because of lower lexical load for , which is limited largely to loanwords from French, and speakers&#x27; difficulty in maintaining contrasts between two back rounded semivowels in comparison to front ones.

==Contrast with fricatives/spirant approximants==
According to the standard definitions, semivowels (such as ) contrast with fricatives (such as ) in that fricatives produce turbulence, but semivowels do not. In discussing Spanish, Martínez Celdrán suggests setting up a third category of &quot;spirant approximant&quot;, contrasting both with semivowel approximants and with fricatives. Though the spirant approximant is more constricted (having a lower F2 amplitude), longer, and unspecified for rounding (&quot;viuda&quot; &#x27;widow&#x27; vs. &quot;ayuda&quot; &#x27;help&#x27;), the distributional overlap is limited. The spirant approximant can only appear in the syllable onset (including word-initially, where the semivowel never appears). The two overlap in distribution after and : &quot;enyesar&quot; (&#x27;to plaster&#x27;) &quot;aniego&quot; (&#x27;flood&#x27;) and although there is dialectal and idiolectal variation, speakers may also exhibit other near-minimal pairs like &quot;abyecto&quot; (&#x27;abject&#x27;) vs. &quot;abierto&quot; (&#x27;opened&#x27;). One potential minimal pair (depending on dialect) is &quot;ya visto&quot; (&#x27;already seen&#x27;) vs. &quot;y ha visto&quot; (&#x27;and he has seen&#x27;).
Again, it is not present in all dialects. Other dialects differ in either merging the two or enhancing the contrast by moving the former to another place of articulation (), like in Rioplatense Spanish.

<doc id="69211" wikidata="Q2509255" url="?curid=69211" title="Song of Ascents">
<text>Song of Ascents is a title given to fifteen of the Psalms, 120–134 (119–133 in the Septuagint and the Vulgate), each starting with the superscription &quot;Shir Hama&#x27;aloth&quot; (), or, in the case of Psalm 121, Shir Lama&#x27;aloth (). They are also variously called Gradual Psalms, Fifteen Psalms, Songs of Degrees, Songs of Steps, songs for going up to worship or Pilgrim Songs.

Four of them (Psalms 122, 124, 131, and 133) are linked in their ascriptions to David, and one (127) to Solomon. Three of them (Psalms 131, 133, and 134) have only three verses. The longest is Psalm 132 (18 verses).

A chiastic structure is seen by many in these Psalms with Psalm 127 a Psalm of Solomon as center. Preceded and succeeded by seven Psalms of ascent, each side adorned with 24 occurrences of &#x27;Yahweh,&#x27; a numerical symmetry evoking divine significance.

12 of the 15 Psalms, excluding Psalm 127, echo phrases from the priestly blessing, &#x27;The Lord keep you and bless you; may His face shine upon you,&#x27; except for the unusual omission of &#x27;make His face shine upon you&#x27;.

The centrality of Psalm 127, attributed to Solomon, the builder of God&#x27;s &#x27;house,&#x27; resonates as pilgrims sing these Psalms on their journey to the sacred dwelling. The pilgrimage begins with references to locations north and south of Israel, depicting distance from the temple in Psalm 120, concluding with a blessing for temple night-shift servants in Psalm 134. This nuanced symphony of balance, priestly blessings, and geographical references invites scholarly contemplation.

==History==
Many scholars believe the title indicates that these psalms were sung by worshippers as they ascended the road to Jerusalem to attend the Three Pilgrimage Festivals (). Others think they were sung by the Levite singers as they ascended the fifteen steps to minister at the Temple in Jerusalem. One view says the Levites first sang the Songs at the dedication of Solomon&#x27;s temple during the night of the fifteenth of Tishri 959 BC. Another study suggests that they were composed for a celebration after Nehemiah&#x27;s rebuilding of Jerusalem&#x27;s walls in 445 BC. Others consider that they may originally have been individual poems which were later collected together and given the title linking them to pilgrimage after the Babylonian captivity.

They were well suited for being sung by their poetic form and the sentiments they express. &quot;They are characterized by brevity, by a key-word, by epanaphora [&quot;i.e.&quot;, repetition], and by their epigrammatic style... More than half of them are cheerful, and all of them hopeful.&quot; As a collection, they contain a number of repeated formulaic phrases, as well as an emphasis on Zion.

The Great Psalms Scroll (11Q5), one of the Dead Sea Scrolls written between , contains a set of psalms partially coincident with the canonical Psalms. Most of the canonical psalms it contains are in a different order than in Psalms, but the Songs of Ascents are included in full in their canonical order.

==Judaism==
===Historical===
There are two references to the Songs of Ascents in the Mishnah, noting the correspondence between the fifteen songs and the temple&#x27;s fifteen steps between the Israelite&#x27;s court and the women&#x27;s court. Rashi refers to a Talmudic legend that King David composed or sang the fifteen songs to calm rising waters at the foundation of the temple.

===Present day===
Psalm 126, eponymously called &quot;Shir Hamaalot&quot; due to its common use, is traditionally recited by Ashkenazim before the Grace After Meals on Shabbat, Jewish holidays, and other festive occasions in keeping with its themes of joy and redemption. The psalm is sung to a wide variety of tunes both liturgical and secular.

It is traditional for some Jews to place a copy of Psalm 121 in the labor and delivery room to promote an easy labor by asking God for mercy. As well, it is placed on the baby&#x27;s carriage and in the baby&#x27;s room to protect the child and surround them in learning and with holy objects.

The 15 chapter are recited in some communities following Mincha on Shabbat afternoon in the winter.

Psalm 128 is recited in some communities in Maariv at the conclusion of the Sabbath.

==Christian liturgy==
The liturgical use of these psalms came into Christianity through its Jewish roots. The form of the Hebrew Bible used in early Christianity was primarily the Septuagint. In the Septuagint, these psalms are numbered 119–133.

Many early hermits observed the practice of reciting the entire Psalter daily, cenobites communities would chant the entire Psalter in a week, so these psalms would be said regularly, during the canonical hours.

===Eastern Christianity===
In the Eastern Orthodox Church and those Eastern Catholic Churches which follow the Byzantine Rite, the Songs of Degrees (Greek: &quot;anabathmoi&quot;) make up the Eighteenth Kathisma (division of the Psalter), and are read on Friday evenings at Vespers throughout the liturgical year. The Kathisma is divided into three sections (called &quot;stases&quot;) of five psalms each.

During Great Lent the Eighteenth Kathisma is read every weekday (Monday through Friday evening) at Vespers, and on Monday through Wednesday of Holy Week. In the Slavic usage this Kathisma is also read from the apodosis of the Exaltation of the Cross up to the forefeast of the Nativity of Christ, and from the apodosis of Theophany up to the Sunday of the Prodigal Son. The reason for this is that the nights are longer in winter, especially in the northern latitudes, so during this season three Kathismata will be chanted at Matins instead of two, so in order to still have a reading from the Psalter at Vespers, the Eighteenth Kathisma is repeated.

====Anabathmoi====

At Matins on Sundays and feast days throughout the year, special hymns called &quot;anabathmoi&quot; (, from βαθμός, &#x27;step&#x27;; Slavonic: &quot;stepénny&quot;) are chanted immediately before the prokeimenon and Matins Gospel. These anabathmoi are compositions based upon the Songs of Ascents, and are written in the eight tones of Byzantine chant. The Anabathmoi for each tone consists of three &quot;stases&quot; or sets of verses (sometimes called antiphons), except for Tone 8 which has four stases. On Sundays, the anabathmoi are chanted according to the tone of the week; on feast days which do not fall on Sunday, the Anabathmoi almost always consist of the first stasis in Tone 4 (based on Psalm 128).

Symbolically, the anabathmoi are chanted as a reminder that Christians are ascending to the Heavenly Jerusalem, and that the spiritual intensity of the service is rising as they approach the reading of the Gospel.

===Western Christianity===
The Western Daily Office was strongly influenced by the Rule of Saint Benedict, where these psalms are assigned to Terce, Sext and Nones on weekdays. Over the centuries, however, various schedules have been used for reciting the psalms. Among the laity, the devotion of the Fifteen Psalms was adopted within primer prayer books.

In the arrangement used in the Roman Rite until 1911, Psalms 119–132 are said at Vespers, from Monday to Thursday, and Psalm 133 was one of the four Psalms said every day at Compline. After the reform by Pope Pius X in 1911, and continuing in the later reform by Pope John XXIII in 1960, these psalms remained at Vespers, but not always on the same day as previously. Psalm 133 was said at Compline only on Sundays and major feasts. The 1960 reform is still in use as the Extraordinary Form of the Roman Rite.

In the modern Liturgy of the Hours of the Catholic Church, the Gradual Psalms are used in several ways:
* Psalms 120–127 and 129–131 are scheduled throughout the four-week Psalter for use at Vespers; 119, 128, and 132 are scheduled for use for Daytime Prayer, and 133 is scheduled for Night Prayer.
* Psalms 119–127 are broken into three parts, to be used as the complementary Psalmody for those who pray three daytime offices separately as Terce, Sext, and None, rather than one office of Daytime Prayer.
* They are used as the sole Psalmody at daytime prayer on solemnities, except for certain solemnities of the Lord and during the octave of Easter and those solemnities falling on Sunday.

== Text ==
&quot;(1) A Song of Ascents. I will lift up mine eyes unto the mountains: From whence shall my help come? (2) My help cometh from the LORD, Who made heaven and earth. (3) He will not suffer thy foot to be moved; He that keepeth thee will not slumber. (4) Behold, He that keepeth Israel Doth neither slumber nor sleep. (5) The LORD is thy keeper; The LORD is thy shade upon thy right hand. (6) The sun shall not smite thee by day, Nor the moon by night. (7) The LORD shall keep thee from all evil; He shall keep thy soul. (8) The LORD shall guard thy going out and thy coming in, From this time forth and for ever.&quot;

<text>IMZ-Ural Group Inc., more commonly known as Ural Motorcycles (), is a multinational company involved in developing, manufacturing, and worldwide distribution of Ural sidecar motorcycles. Headquartered in Redmond, Washington, with assembly facilities in Petropavl, Kazakhstan, Ural is the oldest and one of the world&#x27;s largest manufacturers of sidecar-equipped motorcycles. 

==History==
IMZ-Ural&#x27;s origins are linked to developments in the Eastern Front during World War II as the Soviet Union was preparing to repel possible military action by Nazi Germany. Mobility was especially stressed after the Soviet Union had witnessed the effect of the blitzkrieg on Poland, and a small, rugged, multi-purpose vehicle that could handle Russia&#x27;s underdeveloped road network and pockmarked battlefields was a priority.
=== Pre-war and the Nazi Invasion ===

A meeting was held at the People&#x27;s Commissariat of Defense of the USSR at the end of 30s to devise a motorcycle that would be suitable for the Red Army, and the Nazi Wehrmacht&#x27;s BMW R71 motorcycle was found to closely match the Red Army&#x27;s requirements. Five units were covertly purchased through Sweden and handed over to Moscow Motorcycle Plant, recently organized in a retooled bicycle factory. Soviet engineers dismantled the BMWs and reverse engineered the bike&#x27;s design in every detail. Molds and dies were made to produce engines, gearboxes and other components. The production of these new military sidecar motorcycles, designated M-72 by the Red Army, started in August 1941.

The suspected military offensive occurred in the summer of 1941, as the Nazis executed Operation Barbarossa and invaded the Soviet Union. The opening stages of the attack were so swift and so effective, that Soviet strategists worried that Moscow would quickly be in range of Luftwaffe bombers. On October 21, 1941, the decision was made to move the motorcycle plant east, out of bombing range and into the resource-rich Ural mountain region. The site chosen was the town of Irbit, located on the fringes of Siberia in the Ural Mountains.

Irbit was chosen because it had been an important trade center throughout Russian history and was the site of the country&#x27;s second largest fair before the Revolution of 1917. The only available building large enough to contain the factory was a brewery outside of town, beyond the railway line. This brewery became the Irbit Motorcycle Factory, or IMZ (Russian Ирбитский мотоциклетный завод; Romanized Irbitsky Motosikletny Zavod), and quickly began cranking out motorcycles for the war effort. On February 25, 1942, the first batch of motorcycles—assembled from the parts brought from Moscow—went to the front. During WWII a total of 9,799 M-72 motorcycles were delivered for reconnaissance detachments and mobile troops.

=== Post-war Developments ===
After the war, the IMZ factory was expanded and updated, which including construction of frame and body parts shops, an aluminum foundry, and other shops to produce various motorcycle components. Throughout the 1950s, the motorcycles produced by IMZ were for military use only. By the end of the decade, however, military production was moved to a sister plant in Kyiv, Ukraine, (KMZ) while IMZ focused on producing bikes for the domestic market. During this time, the IMZ facility grew into a massive, Soviet-style collective factory that produced nearly every component used to build its motorcycles. The factory&#x27;s various shops produced everything from rubber and plastic parts to shock absorbers, brake components, and control cables. Nearly 10,000 people worked at the massive factory, and at its peak it produced around 130,000 motorcycles annually—primarily for the Russian domestic market as a cheap alternative to automobiles.
=== Ural Exports ===
IMZ began exporting motorcycles in 1953, mostly to Soviet states and allies in the Global South. Over the next five decades, Ural motorcycles were exported to every corner of the Soviet Union and could be found as far afield as Western Europe, Southeast Asia, India, and even the U.S. In the 1970s, UK company Satra Motors imported Urals to sell under the Cossack Motorcycles brand. In 1994, an independent distributor called Ural-America began selling Urals in the United States. This set the foundations of Ural&#x27;s presence in America and led directly to the formation of the current IMZ-Ural company.

As of 2023, Ural Motorcycles are sold all over the world through a network of over 190 dealerships and service centers. Ural&#x27;s main market is the United States, but the company&#x27;s bikes are popular in Japan, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and throughout the European Union.

== Modern-day products ==

Ural&#x27;s main product is a heavy-duty, sidecar-equipped adventure motorcycle called the Gear Up. Available in three trim levels—Base, Standard, and Expedition—the Gear Up is powered by Ural&#x27;s 749cc, air-cooled, four-stroke, fuel injected, overhead-valve, two-cylinder boxer engine that produces 41 horsepower at 5,500 RPM and 42-foot-pounds of torque at 4,300 RPM. Power is transmitted to the rear wheel through a four-speed (plus reverse) gearbox with a dual-disc dry clutch and a shaft final drive. In addition, all Gear Ups feature an on-demand two-wheel drive system that powers the sidecar wheel via a CV driveshaft connected to the rear drive hub.

Despite its classic looks, and rumors to the contrary, the Gear Up is a thoroughly modern, if simple, motorcycle equipped with high-end parts from numerous international parts suppliers. The brakes are a combination of Brembo two-piston calipers and floating rotors by NG Brakes on all three wheels, suspension is by Sachs, and the rugged tires are by Heidenau Tires. Other parts are supplied by Denso (electrics), Keihin (throttle bodies), J. Juan (parking brake), and Italcerchio (wheels), among others. 

Along with being fully integrated into the modern global supply chain, Ural and its products are in compliance with all applicable environmental and safety standards and protocols, including Euro 5.

==Corporate information==
In November 1992, the state-owned IMZ transformed into a privatized entity owned 40 percent by management and employees through grant, 38 percent by auction with privatization vouchers (mostly management and employees also), with 22 percent retained by the government.

At the beginning of 1998, the business was bought by Russian-Georgian statesmen and businessman Kakha Bendukidze. By that time, IMZ had almost completely lost the domestic market as Russians started buying used Western cars instead of sidecar motorcycles. In 1998 IMZ produced fewer than 2,000 units but the factory still employed nearly 4,000 people. To fix this problem, Bendukidze brought in new management and mandated new ideas. Investments were made to develop a two-wheeled motorcycle, the chopper-styled Ural Wolf. Unfortunately, the Wolf&#x27;s price was too high and its quality was too low and the company couldn&#x27;t sell enough bikes to stay afloat.

In October 2000, the factory had to halt production as it wasn&#x27;t able to pay its bills and Bendukidze was unwilling to invest more money into the dying company. That December, Bendukidze sold the factory to three individuals—including the company&#x27;s current CEO and majority shareholder, the Russian-born American businessman Ilya Khait—in a process of management buyout. The new owners immediately began reorganizing the factory by selling off assets, reducing the workforce by two-thirds, and consolidating production in the facility&#x27;s smaller buildings. The new owners also decided to focus mainly on export markets and to do what the factory did best—produce sidecar-equipped motorcycles. Motorcycle production restarted in the spring of 2001.

The next year, in 2002, the new owners decided to consolidate the disparate distribution networks under company control. The American distribution arm, Irbit Motorworks of America, Inc., was incorporated in Redmond, WA. Ural Motorcycles GmbH, the European distribution arm, was formed in Austria in 2003. Corporate headquarters was moved to the United States in 2006 with the formation of the holding company IMZ-Ural Group, Inc. in Redmond, WA. Besides the manufacturing entities, IMZ-Ural Group, Inc. currently owns distribution companies in the US, Australia, Japan, Spain, and the Czech Republic.

During the opening rounds of Russia&#x27;s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, IMZ-Ural released a statement unequivocally condemning the invasion and calling for a peaceful resolution. In March of that year, Ural production ground to a halt due to inability to import components and export bikes out of Russia caused by international sanctions laid on the country. 

In light of these issues, the company decided to open a new assembly facility in Petropavl, Kazakhstan. Petropavl, a city roughly 373 miles (600 kilometers) south-east from Irbit, was chosen because it had an established industrial infrastructure and a sizeable Russian-speaking populace.

Production at the new factory, IMZ-Kazakhstan, began in August 2022, and shipment of new motorcycles started soon thereafter. Since then, all new Ural Gear Ups have been built in Kazakhstan using parts supplied from all over the world.

<text>The Anacardiaceae, commonly known as the cashew family or sumac family, are a family of flowering plants, including about 83 genera with about 860 known species. Members of the Anacardiaceae bear fruits that are drupes and in some cases produce urushiol, an irritant. The Anacardiaceae include numerous genera, several of which are economically important, notably cashew (in the type genus &quot;Anacardium&quot;), mango, Chinese lacquer tree, yellow mombin, Peruvian pepper, poison ivy, poison oak, sumac, smoke tree, marula and cuachalalate. The genus &quot;Pistacia&quot; (which includes the pistachio and mastic tree) is now included, but was previously placed in its own family, the Pistaciaceae.

The cashew family is more abundant in warm or tropical regions with only a few species living in the temperate zones. Mostly native to tropical Americas, Africa and India. &quot;Pistacia&quot; and some species of &quot;Rhus&quot; can be found in southern Europe, &quot;Rhus&quot; species can be found in much of North America and &quot;Schinus&quot; inhabits South America exclusively.
==Description==

Trees or shrubs, each has inconspicuous flowers and resinous or milky sap that may be highly poisonous, as in black poisonwood and sometimes foul-smelling.
Resin canals located in the inner fibrous bark of the fibrovascular system found in the plant&#x27;s stems, roots, and leaves are characteristic of all members of this family; resin canals located in the pith are characteristic of many of the cashew family species and several species have them located in the primary cortex or the regular bark. Tannin sacs are also widespread among the family.

The wood of the Anacardiaceae has the frequent occurrence of simple small holes in the vessels, occasionally in some species side by side with scalariform holes (in &quot;Campnosperma&quot;, &quot;Micronychia&quot;, and &quot;Heeria argentea&quot; (&quot;Anaphrenium argenteum&quot;). The simple pits are located along the vessel wall and in contact with the parenchyma.

Leaves are deciduous or evergreen, usually alternate (rarely opposite), estipulate (without stipule) and imparipinnate (rarely paripinnate or bipinnate), usually with opposite leaflets (rarely alternate), while others are trifoliolate or simple or unifoliolate (very rarely simple leaves are palmate). Leaf architecture is very diverse. Primary venation is pinnate (rarely palmate). Secondary venation is eucamptodromous, brochidodromous, craspedodromous or cladodromous (rarely reticulodromous) Cladodromous venation, if present is considered diagnostic for Anacardiaceae.

Flowers grow at the end of a branch or stem or at an angle from where the leaf joins the stem and have bracts.
Often with this family, bisexual and male flowers occur on some plants, and bisexual and female flowers are on others, or flowers have both stamens and pistils (perfect). A calyx with three to seven cleft sepals and the same number of petals, occasionally no petals, overlap each other in the bud. Stamens are twice as many or equal to the number of petals, inserted at the base of the fleshy ring or cup-shaped disk, and inserted below the pistil(s).
Stamen stalks are separate, and anthers are able to move.
Flowers have the ovary free, but the petals and stamen are borne on the calyx.
In the stamenate flowers, ovaries are single-celled. In the pistillate flowers, ovaries are single or sometimes quadri- or quinticelled. One to three styles and one ovule occur in each cavity.

Fruits rarely open at maturity
and are most often drupes.

Seed coats are very thin or are crust-like. Little or no endosperm is present. Cotyledons are fleshy.
Seeds are solitary with no albumen around the embryo.

==Taxonomy==

=== History ===

In 1759, Bernard de Jussieu arranged the plants in the royal garden of the Trianon at Versailles, according to his own scheme. That classification included a description of an order called the Terebintaceæ, which contained a suborder that included &quot;Cassuvium&quot; (&quot;Anacardium&quot;), &quot;Anacardium&quot; (&quot;Semecarpus&quot;), &quot;Mangifera&quot;, &quot;Connarus&quot;, &quot;Rhus&quot;, and &quot;Rourea&quot;. In 1789, Antoine Laurent de Jussieu, nephew of Bernard de Jussieu, published that classification scheme.

Robert Brown described a subset of the Terebintaceae called Cassuvlæ or Anacardeæ in 1818, using the herbarium that was collected by Christen Smith during a fated expedition headed by James Hingston Tuckey to explore the River Congo. The name and genera were based on the order with the same name that had been described by de Jussieu in 1759. The herbarium from that expedition contained only one genus from the family, &quot;Rhus&quot;.

Augustin Pyramus de Candolle in 1824, used Robert Brown&#x27;s name Cassuvlæ or Anacardeæ, wrote another description of the group, and filled it with the genera &quot;Anacardium&quot;, &quot;Semecarpus&quot;, &quot;Holigarna&quot;, &quot;Mangifera&quot;, &quot;Buchanania&quot;, &quot;Pistacia&quot;, &quot;Astronium&quot;, &quot;Comocladia&quot;, and &quot;Picramnia&quot;.

John Lindley described the &quot;essential character&quot; of the Anacardiaceæ, the &quot;Cashew Tribe&quot; in 1831, adopting the order that was described by de Jussieu, but abandoning the name Terebintaceæ. He includes the genera that were found in de Candolle&#x27;s Anacardieæ and Sumachineæ: &quot;Anacardium&quot;, &quot;Holigarna&quot;, &quot;Mangifera&quot;, &quot;Rhus&quot;, and &quot;Mauria&quot;.

===Phylogeny===
The genus &quot;Pistacia&quot; has sometimes been separated into its own family, the Pistaciaceae, based on the reduced flower structure, differences in pollen, and the feathery style of the flowers.The nature of its ovary, though, does suggest it belongs in the Anacardiaceae, a position supported by morphological and molecular studies, and recent classifications have included &quot;Pistacia&quot; in the Anacardiaceae. The genus &quot;Abrahamia&quot; was separated from &quot;Protorhus&quot; in 2004.(Pell 2004)

=== Subdivision ===

The family has been treated as a series of five tribes by Engler, and later into subfamilies by Takhtajan, as Anacardioideae (including tribes Anacardieae, Dobineae, Rhoideae, and Semecarpeae) and Spondiadoideae (including tribe Spondiadeae). Pell&#x27;s (2008) molecular analysis reinstated the two subfamilies without further division into tribes (Pell 2004). Later, Min and Barfod, in the &quot;Flora of China&quot; (2008) reinstated the five tribes (four in Anacardioideae), and the single tribe Spondiadeae as Spondiadoideae.

===Genera===
79 genera are accepted:


==Uses==
Members of this family produce cashew and pistachio nuts, and mango and marula fruits.

Some members produce a viscous or adhesive fluid which turns black and is used as a varnish or for tanning and even as a mordant for red dyes. The sap of &quot;Toxicodendron vernicifluum&quot; is used to make lacquer for lacquerware and similar products.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Anacardium&quot;, originally from the Greek, refers to the nut, core or heart of the fruit, which is outwardly located: &quot;ana&quot; means &quot;upward&quot; and &quot;-cardium&quot; means &quot;heart&quot;).

<doc id="69215" wikidata="Q616342" url="?curid=69215" title="Son of man">
<text>&quot;Son of man&quot;, &quot;son of Adam&quot;, or &quot;as a man&quot;, are phrases used in the Hebrew Bible, various apocalyptic works of the intertestamental period, and in the Greek New Testament. In the indefinite form (&quot;son of Adam&quot;, &quot;son of man&quot;, &quot;like a man&quot;) used in the Hebrew Bible, it is a form of address; or it contrasts humans with God and the angels; or it contrasts foreign nations (like the Sasanian Empire and Babylon), which are often represented as animals in apocalyptic writings (bear, goat, or ram), with Israel which is represented as human (a &quot;son of man&quot;); or it signifies an eschatological human figure.

The phrase is used in its indefinite form in the Septuagint, Biblical apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha. The Greek New Testament uses the earlier indefinite form while introducing a novel definite form, &quot;the son of man.&quot;

==History==
===Jewish Bible===

The Hebrew expression &quot;son of man&quot; () appears 107 times in the Hebrew Bible, the majority (93 times) in the Book of Ezekiel. It is used in three main ways: as a form of address (Ezekiel); to contrast the lowly status of humanity against the permanence and exalted dignity of God and the angels (, ); and as a future eschatological figure whose coming will signal the end of history and the time of God&#x27;s judgment ().

Daniel 7 tells of a vision given to Daniel in which four &quot;beasts,&quot; representing pagan nations, oppress the people of Israel until judged by God. describes how the &quot;Ancient of Days&quot; (God) gives dominion over the earth to &quot;one &quot;like a son of man&quot; ( [])&quot;. The passage in Daniel 7:13 occurs in Biblical Aramaic.

Later, in chapter 7, it is explained that &quot;one like a man&quot; certainly implies a &quot;human being&quot; and also stands for &quot;the saints of the Most High&quot; (7:18, 21–22) and &quot;the people of the saints of the Most High&quot; (7:27). The &quot;saints&quot; and &quot;people of the saints,&quot; in turn, probably stand for the Israelites – the vision sees it that God will take dominion over the world away from the beast-like pagan &quot;nations&quot; and give it to human-like Israel.

===Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha===
Although Daniel&#x27;s 7:13 &quot;like a son of man&quot; has been interpreted as standing for the Messiah (e.g. in Rashi&#x27;s &quot;Commentary on the Tanakh&quot;), this interpretation was probably introduced by later apocryphal and deuterocanonical works such as the Similitudes (or Parables) of Enoch and 4 Ezra. Whether these messianic &quot;Son of Man&quot; references are genuinely Jewish or the result of Christian interpolation is disputed. An example of a disputed section is that of The Similitudes (1 Enoch 37–71) which uses Daniel 7 to produce an unparalleled messianic Son of Man, pre-existent and hidden yet ultimately revealed, functioning as judge, vindicator of righteousness, and universal ruler. The Enochic messianic figure is an individual representing a group (the Righteous One who represents the righteous, the Elect One representing the elect), but in (also called 2 Esdras) he becomes an individual man.

===New Testament===

The New Testament features the indefinite &quot;a son of man&quot; in (citing ), and &quot;one like the son of man&quot; in (referencing Daniel 7:13&#x27;s &quot;one like a son of man&quot;). The Gospels introduce a new definite form, , literally &#x27;the son of the man,&#x27; an awkward and ambiguous expression in Greek. It functions as an emphatic equivalent of the first-person pronoun I/me/my, and in all four gospels it is used only by Jesus (except once in the Gospel of John, when the crowd asks what Jesus means by it). German theologian Rudolf Bultmann sees the phrase not as one genuinely used by Jesus but as one inserted by the early Church, but theologian C. F. D. Moule argues that the phrase, &quot;so far from being a title evolved from current apocalyptic thought by the early Church and put by it onto the lips of Jesus, is among the most important symbols used by Jesus himself to describe his vocation and that of those whom he summoned to be with him.&quot;

The title &quot;Son of Man&quot; is the most frequently used designation for Jesus in the Gospels, particularly in his own self-references. Outside the Gospels, however, &quot;Christ&quot; (Messiah) becomes the dominant title, especially in the writings of Paul and the broader New Testament epistles.

In the New Testament, Jesus combines the titles &quot;Son of Man&quot; and &quot;Son of God&quot; in key theological moments. In his conversation with Nicodemus, he unites both titles while speaking of his divine mission and salvation. At his trial before the Sanhedrin, he affirms his identity by linking them again. Other instances include his discourse on resurrection and judgment, Peter’s confession at Caesarea Philippi, and Martha’s confession before the raising of Lazarus. These passages highlight the interconnected nature of Jesus&#x27; humanity and divinity in Christian theology.

<text>The Tangut people (Tangut: , &quot;mjɨ nja̱&quot; or , &quot;mji dzjwo&quot;; ; ; ) were a Sino-Tibetan people who founded and inhabited the Western Xia dynasty. The group initially lived under Tuyuhun authority, but later submitted to the Tang dynasty. After the collapse of Tang dynasty, the Tanguts established the Western Xia. They spoke the Tangut language, which was previously believed to be one of the Qiangic languages or Yi languages which belong to the Tibeto-Burman family.&quot; Phylogenetic and historical linguistic accounts, however, reveal that Tangut belonged instead to the Gyalrongic branch of Tibeto-Burman. Western Xia was annihilated by the Mongol Empire in 1227, most of its written records and architecture were destroyed. Today the Tangut language and its unique script are extinct; only fragments of Tangut literature remain.

==Language==

The Tangut language, otherwise known as &quot;Fan&quot;, belongs to the Tibeto-Burman branch of the Sino-Tibetan language family. Like many other Sino-Tibetan languages, it is a tonal language with predominantly mono-syllabic roots, but it shares certain grammatical traits central to the Tibeto-Burman branch. It used to be debated as to whether Tangut belonged to the Yi or Qiangic subdivision of Tibeto-Burman. The Tanguts, called the Dangxiang () in Chinese, are typically regarded by Chinese scholars to be synonymous with or at least related to the Qiang people. Historically, &quot;Qiang&quot; was a collective term for the multiple ethnic groups who lived on the western borderlands of China, including the modern Qiang people (Rma). The name Tangut first appears in the Orkhon inscriptions of 735. In their own Tangut language, the Tanguts called themselves &quot;Mi-niah&quot; (Miñak). Until the 19th century, the term Minjak was still used to refer to the area inhabited by Qiang people in today&#x27;s Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture. Speakers of the Qiangic Muya language in western Kangding calls themselves Minyak. Geographic names such as Min river and Min county (Gansu) are pointed to this root.

==Appearance==
According to William of Rubruck, who travelled to various parts of the Mongol Empire in the 13th century, the Tanguts were valiant and had big swarthy men among them, in contrast to the Uyghurs, who were &quot;of medium size, like us&quot;.

==Origin==
The early Tanguts inhabited the steppes and mountains of southeast Qinghai and northwest Sichuan. Their home originally was in the highlands of western Sichuan. These regions correspond to the Amdo and Kham regions of the Tibetan plateau. At some point their leader Tuoba Chici, who was likely of mixed Xianbei and Qiang heritage, submitted to Tang China rule and was bestowed the title of Captain General of Western-Rong and the surname &quot;Li&quot;. In the early 8th century, increasing pressure from the Tibetan Empire had forced the Tanguts to migrate north from their homelands in northeastern Tibet to the eastern Ordos region. By the time of the An Lushan Rebellion (755–763), the Tanguts were the predominant local power in what is now eastern Gansu, Ningxia, and northern Shaanxi.

==History== 

In 881 the Tanguts, who were subjects of Tang China, assisted Tang in suppressing the Huang Chao rebellion. As a reward the Tang central government granted the Tangut general Li Sigong the three prefectures of Xia (, Tangut: ), Sui (, Tangut: ), and Yin (, Tangut: ) as hereditary titles under the Dingnan Jiedushi. After the collapse of Tang China, multiple warlords started to form new states in the former territories of Tang China. The Tanguts expanded their realm southwest towards their old homelands. In 1002 they conquered Ling Prefecture and set up their first capital there under the name of Xiping. By 1036 they had annexed the Guiyi Circuit and the Ganzhou Uyghur Kingdom, even pushing into Tibetan territory and conquering Xining. The state of Western Xia was proclaimed in 1038.

Being subjects of Tang China previously for two centuries, the Tangut people adopted many Han/Tang Chinese culture, but also maintained their own customs, as is proven by the vast amount of literature which survived the Tangut state itself.

The Western Xia founder Li Deming&#x27;s son, Li Yuanhao, enthroned as Emperor Jingzong, sought to differentiate the Tangut state from that of its rival Han-led Song China and started to nurture a national Tangut identity by ordering the creation of an official Tangut script and by instituting laws that reinforced traditional Tangut customs. One of the laws he mandated called for citizens to wear traditional ethnic apparel and another required men to wear their hair short or shaved as opposed to the Chinese custom of wearing hair long and knotted. Abandoning the royal Chinese surnames of &quot;Li&quot;, previously bestowed by the Tang dynasty Li royal family, and &quot;Zhao&quot;, subsequently bestowed by the Song dynasty Zhao royal family, he adopted a Tangut surname , rendered in Chinese as &quot;Weiming&quot; (). He made Xingqing (, modern Yinchuan) his capital city.

In the thirteenth century, Genghis Khan unified the northern grasslands of Mongolia and led his troops in six rounds of attacks against the Western Xia over a period of twenty-two years (1205, 1207, 1209–10, 1211–13, 1214–19, 1225–27). During the last spate of the Mongol attacks, Genghis died in Western Xia territory. The official Mongol history attributes his death to illness, whereas legends claim that he died from a wound inflicted in these battles.

In 1227, the capital of Western Xia was overrun by the Mongols, who devastated its buildings and written records: all was burnt to the ground except its monastery. The last emperor was killed and tens of thousands of civilians massacred. However, many Tangut families joined the Mongol Empire. Some of them led Mongol armies, e.g. Cha&#x27;an, into the conquest of China. After the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368) was established, the Tangut troops were incorporated into the Mongol army in their subsequent military conquests in central and southern China. The Tangut were considered Semu under the Yuan class system, thus separating them from the North Chinese. As late as the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), there was evidence of small Tangut communities in Anhui and Henan provinces. The people including members of the royal clan emigrated to western Sichuan, northern Tibet, even possibly northeast India, in some instances becoming local rulers. The Tangut people living in Central China preserved their language until at least the 16th century.

==Culture==
Tangut society was divided into two classes: the &quot;Red Faced&quot; and the &quot;Black Headed&quot;. The Red Faced Tanguts were seen as commoners while the Black Headed Tanguts made up the elite priestly caste. Although Buddhism was extremely popular among the Tangut people, many Tangut herdsmen continued to practice a kind of shamanism known as Root West (Melie). The black caps worn by Root West shamans give the Black Headed caste its name. According to Tangut myth, the ancestor of the Black Headed Tanguts was a heavenly white crane, while the ancestor of the Red Faced Tanguts was a monkey. Tangut kings went by the title of Wuzu.

According to sources in the Tangut language, the Tangut state known now as the Western Xia was named translated as &quot;Great State of White and Lofty&quot; (&quot;phôn¹ mbın² lhi̯ə tha²&quot;). Although the Chinese translation of this name () was occasionally used in Tangut sources, the state was most commonly referred to as the &quot;Great Xia&quot; (大夏) in Chinese-language sources of the Tangut or as the &quot;Xia State&quot; () to the Song. In later historiography and in modern Chinese the Tangut state is referred to as the &quot;Western Xia&quot; (&quot;Xī Xià&quot; 西夏). The Mongols and other steppe tribes referred to the Tangut kingdom as &quot;Qashi&quot; or &quot;Qashin&quot;, which was derived from the Middle Chinese name for Hexi, the region the Tanguts controlled ().

==Religion== 
The Tanguts were primarily Buddhists. Tangut Buddhism was influenced by external elements. The entire Chinese Buddhist canon was translated into the Tangut language over a span of 50 years and published around 1090 in about 3700 fascicles. Buddhism in the Tangut state is believed to be an amalgamation of Tibetan and Chinese traditions, among which the Huayan-Chan tradition of Guifeng Zongmi (Chinese: 圭峰宗密, 780–841) and his master Huayan Chengguan was the most influential. A number of texts previously believed to be of native Tangut origin turned out to be translations of Khitan source texts. The degree of Tibetan impact on the formation of Tangut Buddhism still remains unexplored, especially in the light of new discoveries showing that Tangut Buddhism owed more to the local culture in North China than to pure Tibetan or Chinese influences. Texts belonging to the Tibetan Mahamudra tradition demonstrate that Tangut Buddhism initially evolved along the Karma Kagyu rather than Sakya lines of Buddhist transmission.

A number of Tangut Buddhist institutions, such as &quot;Imperial Preceptor&quot; survived the Tangut State itself and could be found during the Yuan dynasty. One of the more definite sources of Tangut Buddhism was Mount Wutai, where both Huayan and Chinese Esoteric Buddhism flourished from the late Tang dynasty up to the time of the Mongol conquest.

Solonin (2005: unpaginated) links the Tanguts, the Helan Mountains and the Chan teachings of both Kim Hwasang and Baotang Wuzhu:
Worship of Confucianism also existed in the Western Xia, which has led to some claims that the Tangut religion was rooted in Confucianism, but this was incomparable with the degree of popularity of Buddhism. Tangut literature is dominated by Buddhist scriptures while secular teachings including the Chinese classics were rarely available in the Tangut language.

The Tangut state enforced strict laws pertaining to the teaching of religious beliefs and rigorously screened potential teachers. Before he was allowed to teach, a newcomer entering the state from Tibet or India first had to seek the approval of local authorities. Doctrines taught and methods used were carefully supervised to ensure there was no possibility that the Tangut people might misunderstand the teachings. Anyone found to be a fortune-teller or charlatan faced immediate persecution. Deeming it contrary to Buddhist ethical beliefs, the Tangut state strictly forbade religious teachers from accepting compensation or reward for their teaching services.

Although the state did not support an official school of Buddhism, it did protect all religious sites and objects within the country&#x27;s boundaries.

As in China, becoming a Buddhist monk required government approval and anyone found to have taken the vows of a monk without such government oversight faced severe punishment. Remarkably for the time, women played a role in Tangut religious practices by serving as nuns, a position that could only be held by a woman who had been widowed or who was an unmarried virgin.

Suchan (1998) traces the influence of the first several Karmapas upon the Yuan and Ming courts as well as the Western Xia, and mentions Düsum Khyenpa, 1st Karmapa Lama:
After the fall of the Western Xia, the influx of refugees into Tibet led to the adoption of the Pehar deity into Tibetan Buddhism, eventually in the important role as the state oracle, the Nechung Oracle.

<doc id="69217" wikidata="Q204330" url="?curid=69217" title="Gouache">
<text>Gouache (; ), body color, or opaque watercolor is a water-medium paint consisting of natural pigment, water, a binding agent (usually gum arabic or dextrin), and sometimes additional inert material. Gouache is designed to be opaque. Gouache has a long history, having been used for at least twelve centuries. It is used most consistently by commercial artists for posters, illustrations, comics, and other design work.

Gouache is similar to watercolor in that it can be rewetted and dried to a matte finish, and the paint can become infused into its paper support. It is similar to acrylic or oil paints in that it is normally used in an opaque painting style and it can form a superficial layer. Many manufacturers of watercolor paints also produce gouache, and the two can easily be used together.

== Description ==
Gouache paint is similar to watercolor, but it is modified to make it opaque. Just as in watercolor, the binding agent has traditionally been gum arabic but since the late nineteenth century cheaper varieties use yellow dextrin. When the paint is sold as a paste, e.g. in tubes, the dextrin has usually been mixed with an equal volume of water. To improve the adhesive and hygroscopic qualities of the paint, as well as the flexibility of the rather brittle paint layer after drying, propylene glycol is often added. Gouache differs from watercolor in that the particles are typically larger, the ratio of pigment to binder is much higher, and an additional white filler such as chalk—a &quot;body&quot;—may be part of the paint. This makes gouache heavier and more opaque than watercolor, and endows it with greater reflective qualities.

Gouache generally dries to a value that differs from the one it has when wet (lighter tones generally dry darker and darker tones tend to dry lighter), which can make it difficult to match colors over multiple painting sessions. Its quick coverage and total hiding power mean that gouache lends itself to more direct painting techniques than watercolor. &quot;En plein air&quot; paintings take advantage of this, as do the works of J. M. W. Turner.

Gouache is today much used by commercial artists for works such as posters, illustrations, comics, and for other design work. Most 20th-century animations used it to create an opaque color on a cel with watercolor paint used for the backgrounds. Using gouache as &quot;poster paint&quot; is desirable for its speed as the paint layer dries completely by the relatively quick evaporation of the water.

The use of gouache is not restricted to the basic opaque painting techniques using a brush and watercolor paper. It is often applied with an airbrush. As with all types of paint, gouache has been used on unusual surfaces from Braille paper to cardboard. A variation of traditional application is the method used in the &quot;gouaches découpées&quot; (cut collages) created by Henri Matisse. His &quot;Blue Nudes&quot; series is a good example of the technique. A new variation in the formula of the paint is &quot;acrylic gouache&quot;.

== History ==

A form of gouache, with honey or tragacanth gum as a binder, was used in Ancient Egyptian painting. It was also used in European illuminated manuscripts, as well as Persian miniatures. Although they are often described as &quot;watercolor&quot;, Persian miniatures and Mughal miniatures are predominantly examples of gouache. The term gouache, derived from the Italian &quot;guazzo&quot;, also refers to paintings using this opaque method. &quot;Guazzo&quot;, Italian for &quot;mud&quot;, was originally a term applied to the early 16th-century practice of applying oil paint over a tempera base, which could give a matted effect. In the 18th century in France, the term &quot;gouache&quot; was applied to opaque watermedia.

During the eighteenth century gouache was often used in a mixed technique, for adding fine details in pastel paintings. Gouache was typically made by mixing watercolours based on gum arabic with an opaque white pigment. In the nineteenth century, watercolours began to be industrially produced in tubes and a &quot;Chinese white&quot; tube was added to boxes for this purpose. Gouache tends to be used in conjunction with watercolor, and often ink or pencil, in 19th-century paintings.

Later that century, for decorative uses &quot;poster paint&quot; (as it is known in the U.S.), was mass-produced, based on the much cheaper dextrin binder. It was sold in cans or as a powder to be mixed with water. The dextrin replaced older paint types based on hide glue or size. During the twentieth century, gouache began to be specially manufactured in tubes for more refined artistic purposes. Initially, gum arabic was used as a binder but soon cheaper brands were based on dextrin, as is most paint for children.

== Acrylic gouache ==
A relatively new variation in the formula of the paint is &quot;acrylic gouache&quot;. Its highly concentrated pigment is similar to traditional gouache, but it is mixed with an acrylic-based binder, unlike traditional gouache, which is mixed with gum arabic. It is water-soluble when wet and dries to a matte, opaque, and water-resistant surface when dry. Acrylic gouache differs from acrylic paint because it contains additives to ensure the matte finish.

<text>Anacardium, the cashews, are a genus of flowering plants in the family Anacardiaceae, native to tropical regions of the Americas. The best known species is &quot;Anacardium occidentale,&quot; which is commercially cultivated for its cashew nuts and cashew apples.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Anacardium&quot;, originally from the Greek, actually refers to the nut, core or heart of the fruit, which is outwardly located (ana means &quot;upwards&quot; and -cardium means &quot;heart&quot;).

==Taxonomy==
The oldest species of the genus &quot;Anacardium&quot; is &quot;Anacardium germanicum&quot; from the Eocene aged Messel Pit of Germany, well outside the current range of the genus. They were present in the Americas by the Oligocene-Miocene, as evidenced by the species &quot;Anacardium gassonii&quot; from Panama.

, the PoWO (&quot;Plants of the World Online&quot;) accepts 13 species:
*&quot;Anacardium amapaense&quot; 
*&quot;Anacardium amilcarianum&quot;

<doc id="69219" wikidata="Q19637" url="?curid=69219" title="Tranmere Rovers F.C.">
<text>Tranmere Rovers Football Club is a professional association football club based in Birkenhead, Merseyside, England. The team competes in , the fourth level of the English football league system.

Founded in 1884 as Belmont Football Club, they adopted their current name in 1885. Tranmere&#x27;s regular kit is an all-white strip with blue, or occasionally blue and green trim which have been their main colours since 1962. The club moved to its current home, Prenton Park, in 1912. In 1995, the ground had a major redevelopment in response to the Taylor Report. It now seats 16,567 in four stands: the Main Stand, the Kop, the Johnny King Stand and the Cowshed.

Tranmere played in regional leagues until they were invited to become a founder member of Football League Third Division North in 1921. They finished as champions for the 1937–38 season, though were relegated out of the Second Division the following year. They dropped into the Fourth Division in 1961, before winning promotion back to the third tier at the end of the 1966–67 season. Relegation in 1975 was followed by an immediate promotion in 1975–76 under the stewardship of manager John King, and this time they survived for just three seasons in the third tier until being relegated once again in 1979. During the 1980s, they were beset by financial problems and, in 1987, went into administration. However John King returned to manage the club for a second spell and guided Rovers to promotion in 1988–89, which they followed up by winning the Associate Members&#x27; Cup in 1990 and then promotion out of the play-offs in 1991.

The 1990s would prove to be the most successful period in the club&#x27;s history as Tranmere remained in the second tier, and came close to reaching the Premier League with three consecutive play-off campaigns at the start of the decade. Under King&#x27;s successor, John Aldridge, Tranmere experienced a number of cup runs, most notably reaching the 2000 League Cup final. They were finally relegated in 2001 and then spent 13 seasons in the third tier, before back-to-back relegations saw them drop out of the Football League after an 94-year stay. Tranmere spent three seasons in the National League and then returned to the third tier of the Football League via successive play-off campaigns in 2018 and 2019. They were demoted from League One in 2020 after clubs voted to end the season early due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==History==
===Formative years===

Tranmere Rovers were, initially, formed as Belmont Football Club when the football arms of two cricket clubs – Lyndhurst Wanderers and Belmont – came together in 1884. On 15 November 1884, they won their first game 4–0 against Brunswick Rovers. This was a friendly match, as there were no leagues until 1888. Under the presidency of James McGaul, the team had a successful inaugural season, losing only one of their fifteen matches. An unrelated, disbanded side had played under the name &quot;Tranmere Rovers Cricket Club (Association football section)&quot; in 1881–82. On 16 September 1885, before their second season began, Belmont F.C. adopted this name Tranmere Rovers. Tranmere is historically a large village that was subsumed within the later expansion of the town of Birkenhead.

Tranmere played their first matches at Steeles Field in Birkenhead. In 1887, they bought Ravenshaws Field from Tranmere Rugby Club. In 1895, their ground was renamed Prenton Park, although it was 25 years later that the team moved into the current stadium of the same name. Tranmere first wore a kit of blue shirts, white shorts and blue socks. In 1889 they adopted orange and maroon shirts, but in 1904 returned to wearing their original kit.

In 1886, Tranmere entered their first competition: the Liverpool and District Challenge Cup; in 1889, they entered the West Lancashire League. They joined the Combination, a much stronger league, in 1897, and won the championship in 1908. In 1910, continuing their movement through the leagues, they entered the Lancashire Combination and in 1912 they showed their ambition by moving to the present Prenton Park site, with an 800-seat stand. Tranmere won the Lancashire Combination Championship in 1914, and Stan Rowlands became the first Tranmere player to receive an international cap when he was selected to play for Wales.

Rovers continued to play throughout the First World War, although their players were criticised for avoiding military service, despite being employed in the local shipyards.

===Inter-war years===

Following the expulsion of Leeds City Reserves in 1919, Tranmere were able to enter the Central League. Their timing was excellent as the following season, four Central League clubs – including Tranmere – were invited to join the new Division Three North. On 27 August 1921, as founder members of the division, they won their first Football League match 4–1 against Crewe Alexandra at Prenton Park. At this time the team were managed by Bert Cooke, who did so for 23 years in total, the club record for longest serving manager.

In 1924, local boy Dixie Dean made his debut aged 16 years 355 days. He played 30 games for Rovers, scoring 27 goals, before being transferred to Everton for £3,000. In the 1927–28 season, Dean scored a record 60 League goals for Everton. After Dean&#x27;s departure, several talented young players also left for Division One clubs, leading to Cooke&#x27;s reputation as a shrewd businessman. Among those sold was Pongo Waring who – having scored six goals in the 11–1 victory over Durham City – went to Aston Villa for £4,700. As of 2010, Waring retains the record of scoring most goals for Villa in a single season.

In 1934, an FA Cup tie between Rovers and Liverpool was watched at Anfield by 61,036 fans, then a record crowd for a game involving Rovers. One year later, Bunny Bell netted 57 goals during the 1933–34 season, and nine goals in the 13–4 Boxing Day 1935 victory over Oldham Athletic. As of 2011, the aggregate of 17 goals in one game remained a league record.

During this same period, Tranmere made several appearances in the Welsh Cup, reaching the final on two occasions. In 1934, they lost 3–0 to Bristol City in a replay, after a 1–1 draw. The following season, they went one better by beating local rivals Chester 1–0 to win their first silverware since joining the Football League.

Rovers won their first championship in the Football League in 1938, with victory in Division Three North, and, hence, promotion to Division Two for the first time. It is still Rovers&#x27;s only championship in the Football League. However, they were relegated the next season, winning six matches – the record for the worst performance of any team in Division Two.

===Creation of the Superwhites===

Prenton Park emerged from the Second World War largely unscathed. Tranmere rejoined the peacetime Football League in Division Three North, and stayed there until the 1958 restructuring of the football league&#x27;s lower divisions. Manager Peter Farrell led Tranmere to finish 11th in the final season of the Northern Section, securing a place in the new national Division Three, where they were, again, founder members. The final match against Wrexham, also fighting for a place in the higher league, attracted a crowd of 19,615, which, as of 2010, remained the highest ever attendance at a Prenton Park league match.

In 1961, Tranmere&#x27;s inspirational captain Harold Bell left the club. Bell had been picked in the first game after the Second World War in the 1946 season, and did not miss a match until he was dropped on 30 August 1955, a total of 459 consecutive appearances for a British team, a record which held until 2011. Rovers certainly missed their captain, and were relegated to Division Four for the first time in 1961.

The club brought in Dave Russell as manager, and Russell made some changes. Tranmere had worn a kit of blue shirts, white shorts and blue socks since 1904 – the same colours as local rivals, Division One club Everton. Russell introduced an all-white strip to set the teams apart; these have been Tranmere&#x27;s usual colours since. Russell also developed a successful youth policy which included England international Roy McFarland among its graduates. Russell guided Rovers back to Division Three in 1967, a year before a new 4,000-seater main stand was opened, and Rovers reached the fifth round of the FA Cup for the first time. Three years later the club&#x27;s record attendance at Prenton Park was established as 24,424 supporters witnessed Rovers draw 2–2 with Stoke City in the FA Cup.

In 1972, Ron Yeats was installed as player-manager. He strengthened Tranmere&#x27;s connections with local rivals Liverpool by recruiting several former teammates such as Ian St John, and bringing in Bill Shankly in a consultancy role. This team saw one of the most memorable Rovers results of all time when, in a League Cup tie in 1973, Tranmere beat First Division Arsenal 1–0 at their former Highbury home. However, Tranmere returned to the Fourth Division in 1975. The following decade was among the bleakest times in the club&#x27;s history, with the team usually in the lower reaches of the Fourth Division, beset by financial problems, and attaining crowds of less than 2,000.

In 1979, Steve Mungall joined Tranmere from Motherwell. He went on to make more than 500 league appearances for Rovers in a 17-year period. This spell saw Rovers rise up the league and make several appearances at Wembley. He remained with the club, on the coaching staff, until October 2000, when he left to pursue business interests.

Another relegation to Division Four in 1979 put the club in financial difficulties. Debts mounted throughout the 1980s, with insolvency forestalled through a series of friendly fixtures, contributions from fans and a £200,000 loan from Wirral Council. This partnership proved an enduring one, as Wirral&#x27;s logo still appeared on the shirts until 2011. In July 1984, the club was sold to a Californian attorney, making Tranmere one of the first English clubs to be bought by a foreign owner. Nonetheless, in 1987, the club went into administration.

===Johnny King era===
Local businessman Peter Johnson took over control and ownership. This proved to be a turning point in Tranmere&#x27;s history, the club under his ownership experiencing by far the most successful period in its history, in which manager John King took the team from the bottom of Division Four to the brink of English football&#x27;s top league. King&#x27;s first task was to avoid the team finishing bottom of Division Four, which would have resulted in their relegation from the football league. Safety was guaranteed in the last game of the season, with a 1–0 home win over Exeter City on the last day of the season.

The first full season (1987–88) of King&#x27;s second managerial spell in charge saw Tranmere make their first appearance at Wembley Stadium, when a good mid-season run of form saw them qualify for the Football League Centenary Tournament. Tranmere defeated Division One clubs Wimbledon and Newcastle United, before losing on penalties to eventual winner Nottingham Forest. The following season, King guided Tranmere to promotion as Division Four runner-up. Their final game played to secure promotion was against Crewe Alexandra, with both teams needing a point to gain promotion. The first half was contested as usual, but, in the second half, with the score at 1–1, neither team targeted the goal of the other, leading to combined celebrations when the game had concluded. Earlier that season, they had won several games in the League Cup, including against Division One Middlesbrough, in between wins against fellow Division Four club Stockport County and Division 3 club Blackpool, ultimately losing to Bristol City of Division 3.

At the end their first season in Division Three, Tranmere almost secured promotion to Division 2, losing 2–0 in the play-off final to Notts County, a week after Tranmere&#x27;s 2–1 victory over Bristol Rovers at Wembley Stadium in the final of the Leyland DAF Trophy had secured the club&#x27;s first trophy. The form of striker Ian Muir was key to Tranmere&#x27;s success during this period. He joined the club in 1985, and scored 180 goals in eleven seasons. He became the club&#x27;s record scorer, and, in 2012, the first inductee to their hall of fame. Fellow hall of fame member John Morrissey joined the club in 1986. The winger spent 14 seasons at the club, making 585 appearances.

In the 1990–91 season, Tranmere won promotion to Division Two for the first time since the 1930s, with a 1–0 play-off win over local rivals Bolton Wanderers. Once again, Rovers made an appearance in the Leyland DAF Trophy final, this time losing 3–2 to Birmingham City. This made the play-off victory over Bolton Wanderers Tranmere&#x27;s fourth appearance in a Wembley Stadium final in just over a year.

In summer 1991, former Liverpool player John Aldridge joined Tranmere Rovers, signing from Spanish club Real Sociedad for a fee of £250,000; he would remain on the club&#x27;s payroll for the next 10 years, scoring 170 times to put him behind only Ian Muir in the all-time scoring charts. Aldridge also received 30 caps for the Republic of Ireland, and was the first Tranmere player to score at a World Cup. In 1993, Scotland international Pat Nevin joined the team, forming a four-man attack alongside Aldridge, Malkin and Morrissey. In three successive seasons, Tranmere reached the play-off semi-finals, missing out on promotion to the newly formed Premier League through defeat to Swindon Town in 1993, Leicester City in 1994, and Reading in 1995. 1994 also saw Tranmere progress to the League Cup semi-final, where they faced Aston Villa over two legs. The home leg was won 3–1 by Tranmere, with Villa scoring their only goal in the 94th minute. The score in the away leg was 2–1 in favour of Villa until the 88th minute when Villa scored again to win the game 3–1, so the match went to extra-time and penalties. With Tranmere one kick away from the final, Mark Bosnich saved Liam O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s sudden death penalty, and Tranmere eventually lost 5–4.

A reconstructed Prenton Park was opened in March 1995, with the all-seater stadium then holding just under 17,000 supporters. In April 1996, with Rovers struggling for form in the league, chairman Frank Corfe appointed John Aldridge as player-manager, and King was &quot;moved upstairs&quot; to become Director of football. They finished the 1995–96 campaign in 13th position.

===2000 and beyond===

In the 1999–2000 season, despite severe financial constraints, victories over two Premiership sides (West Ham United, Sunderland, followed by First Division club Fulham) led, not only to a place in the sixth round of the FA Cup, but also, to a place in the 2000 Football League Cup final against Leicester City – the first time in the club&#x27;s history that Rovers had reached a major final. Matt Elliott scored Leicester&#x27;s opening goal, before Tranmere&#x27;s Clint Hill was sent off for a second bookable offence. Despite being reduced to ten men, David Kelly equalised; however, Elliot scored Leicester&#x27;s second goal three minutes later, and Tranmere lost the match 2–1. This was the last League Cup game held at the original Wembley stadium.

In 2000, the all-white kit was reintroduced and is still used in 2014. That season, Tranmere Rovers had another cup competition run, beating local Premier League rival Everton 3–0 at Goodison Park, then Southampton 4–3 (after being 0–3 down), before exiting after a loss to another local rival, Premier League club Liverpool. However, Tranmere Rovers struggled during league matches that season; Aldridge quit as manager before Tranmere&#x27;s relegation to Division Two ended a spell of ten years in Division One.

The club hired Brian Little as manager in 2003. He took Rovers to a play-off semi-final in 2004–05, and a best ever 6th round replay in the 2004 FA Cup, where they lost to eventual finalists, Millwall. At the end of the 2005–06 season, Little left the club and was replaced by former player Ronnie Moore. In Moore&#x27;s three seasons in charge, the club finished 9th, 11th and 7th, narrowly missing out on qualification for in the play-offs in his final season. Moore was sacked in 2009, with former England winger John Barnes, whose only previous domestic managerial experience was with Celtic 10 years earlier, replacing him. It was during Barnes&#x27;s time as manager that long-serving kitman, Mark Trevor, ended his 12-year &quot;Labour of Love&quot;, washing the kit of his local team. Having been at the club since 1997, he washed his last kit in August 2009, ahead of the club&#x27;s home game against Charlton Athletic. Barnes&#x27;s term as manager lasted considerably less time, and it was a five months before long-serving club physiotherapist Les Parry was given temporary charge. Rovers finished the season in 19th place in League One, avoiding relegation on the final day of the season, thanks to a 3–0 victory at Stockport County. In June 2010, Parry was given the manager&#x27;s job on a permanent basis. He was sacked on 4 March 2012, after a 1–0 defeat by Chesterfield left the club only one point above the relegation zone, and replaced by Ronnie Moore for the remainder of the season. Moore won six of his thirteen games in charge at the end of the season, guiding Tranmere to a mid-table position, as they finished the season in the top half for the first time in several years. In April 2012, Moore signed a new one-year deal with Tranmere, keeping him at the club until the end of the 2012–13 season.

Towards the end of the 2013–14 season, Moore admitted breaking the Football Association&#x27;s betting rules, and Tranmere sacked him when the club were just clear of the relegation zone. Assistant John McMahon took over as caretaker manager, but Tranmere were relegated to League Two in the final gameof the season on the final day of the season. Rob Edwards was subsequently appointed as new manager.

On 11 August 2014, it was announced that former player and Football Association chief executive Mark Palios and his wife Nicola were taking a controlling interest in the club from outgoing chairman Peter Johnson. Mark Palios would become executive chairman of the club, with Johnson becoming its honorary president.

After a poor start to the season, the home loss to Plymouth Argyle on 11 October 2014 saw Tranmere in last place in the Football League for the first time since 27 August 1987 after they had lost their first two matches of that season. Edwards was sacked as manager on 13 October. Mickey Adams took over a week later, with the aim of saving the club from relegation to the Conference. However, on 25 April 2015, after another defeat to Plymouth Argyle in the reverse fixture, Tranmere were relegated, ending their 94-year stay in the Football League.

===Non-League years===

Gary Brabin was appointed as manager on 5 May 2015. It was a season of ups and downs, with poorer home form than away form. It took a while for Rovers to adjust to life in the non-league, with erratic form during the season. Tranmere finished sixth, one place outside the play-off zone, in Gary Brabin&#x27;s first season.

Tranmere started the 2016–17 season well, ranking at the top of the non-league table at the end of August, after which Brabin received an award for manager of the month. Form later dipped which resulted in one goal scored in the next four games, with a 1–0 defeat to Sutton United resulting in Brabin being sacked on 18 September 2016. Assistant manager, ex-Southport boss Paul Carden took over on an interim basis. On 6 October 2016, former Tranmere player Micky Mellon was appointed permanent manager. His first game in charge was against cross-border rivals Wrexham, and ended with a 2–0 victory for Tranmere. Despite a 2nd-place finish and a club record 95-point haul, this still was not enough to gain automatic promotion back to the league. Tranmere faced Aldershot Town in the play-offs. A goal from James Norwood and a brace from Cole Stockton in the first leg away at the Recreation Ground saw Rovers take a 3–0 lead back to Prenton Park for the second leg, which ended in a 2–2 draw, Norwood and Stockton once again on the scoresheet. This gave Tranmere a 5–2 aggregate win and their first Wembley appearance in 17 years. Tranmere lost 3–1 in the 2017 National League play-off final the 3–1 to Forest Green Rovers.

Tranmere&#x27;s 2017–18 season got off to a poor start, with 3 wins from the first 12 games. Tranmere slipped to 18th in the table, their lowest ever league position. A spectacular winter turnaround saw Tranmere move into the play-off spots, where they remained for the rest of the season. This turnaround included a record-breaking run of 9 consecutive home league wins. This record-breaking stint was ended in February by a 4–1 defeat to eventual title winner Macclesfield Town. Tranmere responded to this defeat by winning 8 out of their next 9 games, finishing the season as National League runners-up for the second time in as many years, qualifying for the play-offs. In the play-off semi-final, Tranmere met Ebbsfleet United at home. Tranmere came from behind twice to take the game to extra time before prevailing 4–2 after extra time, a result which sent Tranmere to Wembley Stadium for the National League play-off final. On 12 May 2018, a crowd of 16,306 were at Wembley for the final against Boreham Wood. Tranmere were 2–1 victors, their first trophy in 27 years, and were promoted back to the Football League.

===Return to the Football League===
Under the chairmanship of Mark Palios and the management of Micky Mellon, Tranmere played in League Two for the 2018–19 season, finishing 6th and thereby reaching the play-offs. On 25 May 2019, Tranmere secured back-to-back promotions, beating Newport County 1–0 at Wembley Stadium. They did so with a goal from Connor Jennings in the 119th minute, thus securing their spot in League One for the 2019–20 season.

By March 2020, the team were within the relegation zone, but with a game in hand on their nearest rivals and on a run of three successive victories. The cancellation of fixtures due to the COVID-19 pandemic meant that the season could not be completed, and a vote was taken by League One clubs on 9 June to resolve promotion and relegation issues on a points per game (PPG) basis. This meant that Tranmere would be demoted to League Two for the 2020–21 season. Club chairman Mark Palios said that the decision was unfair and that he was considering legal action as a result. He also announced that 20 members of staff would have to be made redundant.

With the team back in League Two, Mike Jackson was named as manager of Tranmere on 18 July 2020. He was sacked on 31 October 2020. Keith Hill succeeded temporary manager Ian Dawes on 21 November 2020. He was sacked on 11 May 2021, after the side reached the play-offs, but before the play-off matches had started. Morecambe defeated Tranmere in the play-off semi-final. At the end of May 2021, Tranmere announced that Micky Mellon was returning to the club as manager, having spent the season apart in charge of Dundee United. Despite a strong start to the season, Tranmere sacked Mellon on 19 March 2023, following results that included a total of six wins since mid-October 2022. Dawes oversaw seven games as caretaker manager before being appoinbted the permanent manager, but Tranmere sacked him in early September 2023 after six consecutive defeats; Tranmere appointed their technical director Nigel Adkins as interim manager.

==Colours and crest==
Belmont F.C., the forerunners of today&#x27;s Rovers, wore blue shirts and white shorts, as did the early Rovers, until a radical change in 1889, when a combination of maroon and orange shirts and navy blue shorts was introduced to &quot;dazzle&quot; their opponents in the West Lancashire League. These were abandoned in 1904 in favour of the earlier blue and white colours which have, in some form or other, remained until the present day. In 1962, Dave Russell introduced a white strip with blue trim, saying &quot;Tranmere Rovers should have a specific identity of its own, so on Merseyside there&#x27;s now Liverpool&#x27;s Red, Everton&#x27;s blue and Tranmere&#x27;s white&quot;. Since then, the team have worn varying combinations of blue and white, moving back towards a more predominantly white kit in 2000. The team&#x27;s colours are reflected in their nickname of the &quot;Superwhites&quot;.

Tranmere first introduced a badge on their shirt in 1962, wearing the coat of arms of the borough of Birkenhead, along with adopting their motto &quot;Ubi fides ibi lux et robur&quot;, meaning &quot;Where there is faith there is light and strength&quot;. The crest was replaced in 1972 by a monogram, and, in 1981, by a simplified blue and white shield. In 1987, a complex heraldic crest was introduced, adapting the Birkenhead crest through the inclusion of a football and a TRFC logo. The simpler badge was adopted in 1997, and modified slightly in 2009 to mark the club&#x27;s 125-year anniversary. The blue and white crest incorporated simplified elements of the Birkenhead civic coat of arms: the crosier and lion originally formed part of the Birkenhead Priory seal; the oak tree was a symbol of the Tranmere Local Board; the star or starfish represents Bebington; the two lions represent Oxton; and the crescents may represent the Laird family.

For the 2021–22 season, Tranmere reverted to their pre-1997 badge.

==Stadium==

Rovers played their first matches at Steeles Field in Birkenhead but, in 1887, they bought a new site from Tranmere Rugby Club. The ground was variously referred to as the &quot;Borough Road Enclosure&quot;, &quot;Ravenshaw&#x27;s Field&quot; and &quot;South Road&quot;. The name &quot;Prenton Park&quot; was adopted in 1895 as a result of a suggestion in the letters page of the Football Echo. Because the land was required for housing and a school, Tranmere were forced to move and the name went with them. The present Prenton Park was opened on 9 March 1912. There were stands (also known as bleachers) on both sides of the pitch, a paddock and three open terraces, the general format which remained until 1994.

Many improvements to the ground were driven by changes in legislation. The biggest change of all took place during 1994 and 1995. The Taylor Report suggested that all stadia in the top two divisions of English football should no longer permit standing. The club&#x27;s response was to redevelop three sides of the ground with entirely new all-seater stands created – the Borough Road Stand (now the Johnny King Stand), the Cowshed and the new Kop, in addition to the existing Main Stand. Capacity in the ground thus increased from 14,200 to the 16,567 of today. On 11 March 1995, having been built at a cost of £3.1 million, the new ground was officially opened.

Attendances at the ground have fluctuated over its hundred-year history. Around 8,000 visitors watched the first game at the stadium, as Tranmere beat Lancaster Town 8–0. Prenton Park&#x27;s largest-ever crowd was 24,424 for a 1972 FA Cup match between Tranmere and Stoke City. Average attendances for home games between 2008 and 2011 ranged from above 5,000 to under 6,000.

==Supporters and rivalries==
Tranmere Rovers had an average home attendance of 6,552 during the 2018–19 season, making them the 4th best supported club in League Two and 42nd in The Football League as a whole. The club has a number of supporters&#x27; groups, including the Tranmere Rovers Supporters Trust; in 2010, the trust raised £12,500 for the club to sign Andy Robinson on loan. In 2011, they raised £200,000 and planned to purchase a controlling interest in Tranmere. TSB (Tranmere Stand Boys) is the hooligan firm associated with the club. Tranmere Rovers have been the subject of an independent supporters&#x27; fanzine &quot;Give Us an R&quot; since the 1990s.

Despite being geographically closest to Everton and Liverpool, Tranmere&#x27;s time in the lower leagues has meant that they have rarely met either club and have built up traditional rivalries with near neighbours Wrexham, Chester, and Southport, the latter two of which are now non-league clubs. According to a survey entitled &#x27;The League of Love and Hate&#x27; conducted in August 2019, Tranmere fans listed the more distant Bolton Wanderers and Oldham Athletic as their biggest rivals, followed by Everton, Liverpool and Crewe Alexandra, although the results were open to debate as the census does not contain non-league clubs. Tranmere also had a fierce rivalry with Wallasey-based near neighbour New Brighton, until that club failed to be re-elected to the Football League in 1951.

As of the end of the 2022–23 season, Tranmere had met the following teams most times in the Football League:
==Tranmere Rovers Ladies==
Tranmere Rovers Ladies Football Club were founded in 1990. Based in the Wirral, they are affiliated with the men&#x27;s team, and play home games at Villa Park, the home of Ashville F.C., in Wallasey. Between 1996 and 2004 they competed in the FA Premier League National Division, then the top tier of the English women&#x27;s football pyramid. Since 2011, they have played in the North West Regional League, Premier Division. As of the start of the 2011–12 season, they have won the Cheshire Cup a record 11 times.

==Players==
===First-team squad===












===Former players===
As part of the club&#x27;s 125th anniversary celebrations in 2010, a hall of fame was announced, initially honouring seven former players and managers: Ian Muir, John Aldridge, John King, Ray Mathias, Steve Mungall, John Morrissey, and Pat Nevin. Harold Bell holds the record for the most consecutive league appearances for a British team. He was picked for the first game after the Second World War in the 1946–47 season and did not miss a match until 30 August 1955, a total of 401 consecutive matches in the Third Division North.

==Officials==

===Coaching staff===

===Managers===
By the start of the 2024–25 season, the club had employed 40 managers. The first man to hold this position was Bert Cooke, appointed in 1912. He oversaw the club&#x27;s entry into the Football League, and remained in charge for 23 years, the longest spell of any manager at the club. Major changes were not seen until businessman Dave Russell took over in 1961. His introductions included the team&#x27;s current all-white kit and regularly arranged floodlit home fixtures on Friday evenings rather than the usual Saturday afternoon. Rock band and Tranmere fans Half Man Half Biscuit described the practice in their song &quot;Friday Night And The Gates Are Low&quot;.

Tranmere&#x27;s most successful period came at the end of the twentieth century. John King returned for his third spell at the club in 1987, having previously both played for and managed the team. He led them to a victory in the League Trophy, and from the bottom of the Fourth Division to, on three occasions, reach the semi-finals in play-offs that had as their prize a promotion to the Premier League. Under King&#x27;s replacement, John Aldridge, Tranmere appeared in the 2000 Football League Cup final. From 2009, they were managed by former club physiotherapist, Les Parry, until he was sacked on 4 March 2012, and replaced by Ronnie Moore. In February 2014, media reports suggested Moore was under investigation by The Football Association, for breaching its rules against betting on competitions in which his club were involved. Three days later, Tranmere suspended Moore, and then sacked him on 9 April 2014, after he conceded that the FA&#x27;s charges were valid.

On 27 May 2014, the club announced that Rob Edwards had been appointed as their new manager. Tranmere sacked Edwards on 13 October 2014. Moving quickly to arrest the decline which had seen Tranmere slump to the bottom of League Two, Tranmere announced former Port Vale manager Micky Adams&#x27;s appointment as Edwards&#x27;s successor on 16 October 2014. He left the club by mutual consent on 19 April 2015, when the club were bottom of the league with two matches remaining. Gary Brabin, whose contract was in turn ended in September 2016, replaced Adams. Tranmere appointed Micky Mellon as manager the following month, and he led the team to a pair of consecutive play-off final victories in the 2017–18 and 2018–19 seasons, the last of which brought a return to League One for the club. After four years at Tranmere, Mellon moved to Dundee United on 6 July 2020.

On 18 July 2020, Mellon&#x27;s former assistant manager Mike Jackson was appointed as manager, however his tenure was short-lived. After only two league wins in his first 10 games Jackson was sacked on 31 October 2020 following a 1–0 home defeat to Morecambe. Keith Hill replaced Jackson as first team manager on 21 November. Hill&#x27;s first game ended in a 1–0 victory against Carlisle United. His side were top of the form table (after 20 games) in February, the team&#x27;s spine spearheaded by Scott Davies, Peter Clarke, Manny Monthé, Jay Spearing, Paul Lewis and finally, James Vaughan, who is still the youngest ever Premier League goalscorer since 2005. Hill was sacked in May 2021, after the team had reached the League Two play-offs, but before the play-off matches took place. At the end of May 2021, Micky Mellon returned to Tranmere for a second spell as manager.

Full time managers are shown below (excluding caretaker managers).
