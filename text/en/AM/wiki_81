<text>Goofy is a cartoon character created by the Walt Disney Company. He is a tall, anthropomorphic dog who typically wears a turtle neck and vest, with pants, shoes, white gloves, and a tall hat originally designed as a rumpled fedora. Goofy is a close friend of Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck, and is Max Goof&#x27;s father. He is normally characterized as hopelessly clumsy and dim-witted, yet this interpretation is not always definitive; occasionally, Goofy is shown as intuitive and clever, albeit in his own unique, eccentric way.

Goofy debuted in animated cartoons, starting in 1932 with &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Revue&quot; as Dippy Dawg, who is older than Goofy would come to be. Later the same year, he was re-imagined as a younger character, now called Goofy, in the short &quot;The Whoopee Party&quot;. During the 1930s, he was used extensively as part of a comedy trio with Mickey and Donald. Starting in 1939, Goofy was given his own series of shorts that were popular in the 1940s and early 1950s. Two &quot;Goofy&quot; shorts were nominated for an Oscar: &quot;How to Play Football&quot; (1944) and &quot;Aquamania&quot; (1961). He also co-starred in a short series with Donald, including &quot;Polar Trappers&quot; (1938), where they first appeared without Mickey Mouse. Three more &quot;Goofy&quot; shorts were produced in the 1960s after which Goofy was only seen in television and Disney comics. He returned to theatrical animation in 1983 with &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot;. His most recent theatrical appearance was &quot;How to Hook Up Your Home Theater&quot; in 2007. Goofy has also been featured in television, most extensively in &quot;Goof Troop&quot; (1992), &quot;House of Mouse&quot; (2001–2003), &quot;Mickey Mouse Clubhouse&quot; (2006–2016), &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; (2013–2019), &quot;Mickey and the Roadster Racers / Mickey Mouse Mixed-Up Adventures&quot; (2017–2021), &quot;Mickey Mouse Funhouse&quot; (2021–present) and &quot;Mickey Mouse Clubhouse+&quot; (2025).

Originally known as Dippy Dawg, the character is more commonly known simply as &quot;Goofy&quot;, a name used in his short film series. In his 1950s cartoons, he usually played a character called George G. Geef. Sources from the &quot;Goof Troop&quot; continuity give the character&#x27;s full name as G. G. &quot;Goofy&quot; Goof, likely in reference to the 1950s name. In many other sources, both animated and comics, the surname Goof continues to be used. In other 2000s-era comics, the character&#x27;s full name has occasionally been given as Goofus D. Dawg.

==Characteristics==

In the comics and his pre-1992 animated appearances, Goofy was usually single and childless. Unlike Mickey and Donald, he did not have a steady girlfriend. The exception was the 1950s cartoons, in which Goofy played a character called George Geef who was married and at one point became the father of a kid named George Junior. In the &quot;Goof Troop&quot; series (1992–1993), however, Goofy was portrayed as a single father with a son named Max, and the character of Max made further animated appearances until 2004. This marked a division between animation and comics, as the latter kept showing Goofy as a single childless character, excluding comics taking place in the &quot;Goof Troop&quot; continuity. After 2004, Max disappeared from animation, thus removing the division between the two media. Goofy&#x27;s wife was never shown, while George Geef&#x27;s wife appeared—but always with her face unseen—in 1950s-produced cartoon shorts depicting the character as a &quot;family man&quot;.

In the comics, Goofy usually appears as Mickey&#x27;s sidekick, though he also is occasionally shown as a protagonist. Goofy lives in Mouseton in the comics and in Spoonerville in &quot;Goof Troop&quot;. In comics books and strips, Goofy&#x27;s closest relatives are his smarter nephew Gilbert. and his grandmother, simply called Grandma Goofy. In Italian comics, he has been given several cousins, including adventurer Arizona Goof (original Italian name: Indiana Pipps), who is a spoof of the fictional archaeologist Indiana Jones.

Goofy&#x27;s catchphrases are &quot;gawrsh!&quot; (which is his usual exclamation of surprise and his way of pronouncing &quot;&quot;), along with &quot;ah-hyuck!&quot; (a distinctive chuckle) that is sometimes followed by a &quot;hoo hoo hoo hoo!&quot;, and especially the Goofy holler (YAAAAAAAAH-HOO-HOO-HOO-EEEEE!). In the classic shorts, he would sometimes say &quot;Somethin&#x27; wrong here&quot; (first heard in &quot;Lonesome Ghosts&quot;) whenever he suspected something was not right about the situation he was currently in, or sing a few bars of &quot;The World Owes Me a Livin&#x27;&quot; from the Silly Symphonies cartoon &quot;The Grasshopper and the Ants&quot; (the first instance of Goofy singing this song is &quot;On Ice&quot;). In &quot;The Grasshopper and the Ants&quot;, the Grasshopper had an aloof character similar to Goofy and shared the same voice actor (Pinto Colvig) as him.

According to biographer Neal Gabler, Walt Disney disliked the Goofy cartoons, thinking they were merely &quot;stupid cartoons with gags tied together&quot; with no larger narrative or emotional engagement and a step backward to the early days of animation. As such, he threatened constantly to terminate the series, but only continued it to provide make-work for his animators. Animation historian Michael Barrier is skeptical of Gabler&#x27;s claim, saying that his source did not correspond with what was written.

===Origin and Early Years===
The character of Goofy originated with his voice actor, a former circus and vaudville actor, comedian, clown and chalk talk artist Pinto Colvig, who began working as a story man for the Disney Studio in 1930. 

According to Colvig, one day in 1931, he was having a conversation with Walt Disney and director Wilfred Jackson, and began to reminisce about “…a grinny, half-baked village nitwit back in my hometown whose mannerisms I had copied and used for one of my former stage characters, &quot;The Oregon Appleknocker&quot;.” Colvig later identified this “village nitwit” as a local flagman that worked at Jacksonville, Oregon&#x27;s main railroad crossing, who he described as a “...slow-minded guy who is the happiest fellow in the world. Each small town has one, and he always seems to hang around the depot... As a youngster I used to watch every train come in, and I knew all the details and peculiarities of that flagman&#x27;s life. I impersonated that man for Disney, not in jest, but because I admired him and his simplicity. I always laughed with him rather than at him.&quot; 

Walt Disney was captivated by Colvig&#x27;s impersonation, and eager to expand his cast of recognizable cast of characters, decided to develop a new character around Colvig&#x27;s former stage routine for Mickey&#x27;s ever-growing roster of supporting players. The next day, Colvig went in front of a microphone and camera and started acting out the loose ungainly mannerisms of his &quot;Oregon Appleknocker&quot; persona, while animator Tom Palmer sketched out a character based on his performance. “Thus ‘Goofy, the Guy with a Silly Laugh’ was hatched” as Colvig would later declare with pride.

The character first appeared in &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Revue&quot;, released on May 27, 1932. Directed by Jackson, the short features Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Horace Horsecollar and Clarabelle Cow performing a song and dance show: a typical Mickey cartoon of the time. What set this short apart was the appearance of a new character: a dog-like member of the audience who constantly irritates his fellow spectators by noisily crunching peanuts and laughing loudly (the laugh being provided by Colvig) until two of those fellow spectators knocked him out with their mallets, before revealing they have the same exact laugh. 

This early version of Goofy was named &quot;Dippy Dawg&quot; by Disney artist Frank Webb and was depicted as an old man with a white beard, a puffy tail, and no trousers, shorts, or undergarments. A considerably younger and more refined version of the &quot;Dippy Dawg&quot; character next appeared in &quot;The Whoopee Party&quot; (released on September 17, 1932) this time as a party guest and a friend of Mickey and his gang. 

&quot;Dippy Dawg&quot; made a total of six appearances between 1932 and 1933, but most of them were mere cameos. By his seventh appearance, in &quot;Orphan&#x27;s Benefit&quot; (released on August 11, 1934), he gained the new name &quot;Goofy&quot;, but was still considered a minor character.

===Development under Art Babbitt===

Inspired by popular comedy trio acts of the era – such as &quot;The Three Stooges&quot; and &quot;The Marx Brothers&quot; – Walt Disney and his storymen decided to team Mickey, Goofy and the newly popular character of Donald Duck together in a cartoon entitled &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Service Station&quot;: directed by Ben Sharpsteen and eventually released on March 16, 1935.

In mid-1934, Walt held a story meeting for &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Service Station&quot; where he and Sharpsteen began assigning animators to specific sequences. One of the animators assigned to the short, Art Babbitt, took a particular liking to a sequence with Goofy. &quot;I had to fight for that...&quot; Babbitt rememebred years later:

Babbitt&#x27;s scene with Goofy was originally timed to be 7 feet of film (just over 4 seconds); however, Babbitt padded his scene adding additional bits of comic business, with the final scene being 57 feet (38 seconds) long. Sharpsteen was furious that Babbitt had gone over his allotted time without permission, but Walt was impressed by Babbitt&#x27;s work and approved his scene.

Upon completing his sequence with Goofy in &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Service Station&quot;, Babbitt (who had been studying Konstantin Stanislavski&#x27;s theories of method acting) not only redesigned Goofy from his earlier ganglier appearance to a more ovular streamlined version, but also psychoanalyzed the character: something no other animator had done before. Babbitt wrote a two-and-a-half page character bible of Goofy, entitled &quot;Character Analysis of the Goof&quot; that circulated the studio in late 1934. Some of what Babbitt wrote included:

Babbitt&#x27;s &quot;Character Analysis&quot; was considered highly influential within the studio, and character bibles were quickly adopted for all Disney&#x27;s major stars; including Mickey, Donald and Pluto.

&quot;Mickey&#x27;s Service Station&quot; also set the template for a series of films where Mickey, Donald and Goofy attempted to perform a certain task, with each character being separated early on, and attempting to solve a problem in their own way and with their distinct style of comedy, before reuniting at the end – often resulting failure rather than success.

While other animators would also animate the character of Goofy in these &quot;trio&quot; shorts (such as in &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Fire Brigade&quot;, released in August 1935, where an earlier Pre-Babbitt version of Goofy was animated by Wolfgang Reitherman), Art Babbitt became the Goofy specialist at the Disney studio and the authority on the character.

Babbitt continued to develop the character of Goofy when he next animated him in &quot;On Ice&quot; (released in September 1935). Here he developed a technique he called &quot;breaking the joints&quot; – where Goofy&#x27;s arms, legs, feet and other appendages would bend the wrong way for a few frames before popping back into the correct position. This gave the character a lot more loose and unpredictable movements, emphasising his stupid personality.

Babbitt finally crystalized the character of Goofy with his third time animating the character in &quot;Moving Day&quot; (released in June 1936), where he was tasked to animate a scene of Goofy attempting to move a piano onto a truck. For this scene Babbitt created another first for animation: using his recently acquired 16mm camera, he filmed Pinto Colvig performing Goofy&#x27;s movements in his &quot;Oregon Appleknocker&quot; persona, making Babbitt the first animator to use live-action reference.

As animation historian Michael Barrier wrote of this scene: &quot;Babbitt&#x27;s &quot;Moving Day&quot; animation was by far his most ambitious... Babbitt&#x27;s &quot;Goofy&quot; was the first Disney character after [Norm] Ferguson&#x27;s &quot;Pluto&quot; to have a visible inner life and &quot;Goofy&quot;, stupid though he was, was clearly more complex than &quot;Pluto&quot;. For the most part, &quot;Pluto&quot; simply reacted; &quot;Goofy&quot; schemed and planned, however dimly.&quot;

Ben Sharpsteen directed the majority of the Mickey, Donald and Goofy trio cartoons. &quot;Clock Cleaners&quot; and &quot;Lonesome Ghosts&quot; (released on both October 15 and December 24, 1937 respectively), are considered the highlights of this series, with the former being voted Number 27 in the book &quot;The 50 Greatest Cartoons&quot;.

Progressively during the series, Mickey&#x27;s part diminished in favor of Donald, Goofy, and Pluto. The reason for this was simple: between the easily frustrated Donald and Pluto and the always-living-in-a-world-of-his-own Goofy, Mickey—who became progressively gentler and more laid-back—seemed to act as the straight man of the trio. The studio&#x27;s artists found that it had become easier coming up with new gags for Goofy or Donald than Mickey, to a point that Mickey&#x27;s role had become unnecessary.

&quot;Polar Trappers&quot;, released on June 17, 1938, was the first film to feature Goofy and Donald as a duo. Mickey would return in &quot;The Whalers&quot;, released on August 19, 1938, but this and &quot;Tugboat Mickey&quot;, released on April 26, 1940, would be the last two shorts to feature all three characters as a team.

===Solo series===
Goofy next starred at his first solo cartoon &quot;Goofy and Wilbur&quot; directed by Dick Huemer, first released on March 17, 1939. The short featured Goofy fishing with the help of Wilbur, his pet grasshopper.

====The &quot;How to...&quot; series====

Jack Kinney would take over the Goofy cartoons with the second short &quot;Goofy&#x27;s Glider&quot; (1940). Kinney&#x27;s Goofy cartoons would feature zany, fast-paced action and gags similar to those being made at Warner Bros and MGM, and possibly influenced by Tex Avery. Kinney found Goofy to be &quot;a nice long, lean character that you could move; you could get poses out of him, crazy poses&quot;. A sports fan, he would place Goofy in &quot;How to...&quot; themed shorts in which Goofy would demonstrate, poorly, how to perform certain sports.

&quot;How to Ride a Horse&quot;, a segment in the 1941 film &quot;The Reluctant Dragon&quot;, would establish the tone and style of future shorts like &quot;The Art of Skiing&quot; (1941), &quot;How to Fish&quot; (1942), &quot;How to Swim&quot; (1942) and &quot;How to Play Golf&quot; (1944). Cartoon shorts like &quot;How to Play Baseball&quot; (1942), &quot;How to Play Football&quot; (1944) and &quot;Hockey Homicide&quot; (1945) would feature Goofy not as a single character but multiple characters playing the opposing teams. Animation historian Paul Wells considers &quot;Hockey Homicide&quot; to be the &quot;peak&quot; of the sports cartoons. Some of the later sports-theme cartoons, like &quot;Double Dribble&quot; (1946) and &quot;They&#x27;re Off&quot; (1948) would be directed by Jack Hannah.

Pinto Colvig had a falling out with Disney in 1937 and left the studio, leaving Goofy without a voice. Kinney recalls &quot;so we had to use whatever was in the library; you know, his laugh and all those things. But he did have a hell of a library, of different lines of dialogue&quot;. In addition, the studio had voice artist Danny Webb record new dialog. Kinney also paired Goofy with a narrator voiced by John McLeish: &quot;He had this deep voice, just a great voice, and he loved to recite Shakespeare. So I suggested, my God, we&#x27;ll get McLeish for a narrator, and don&#x27;t tell him that he&#x27;s not doing it straight. Just let him play it&quot;. Colvig returned to Disney in 1941 and resumed the voice until 1967.

====The &quot;Everyman&quot; years====

Disney had started casting Goofy as a suburban everyman in the late 1940s. And with this role came changes in depiction. Goofy&#x27;s facial stubble and his protruding teeth were removed to give him a more refined look. His clothing changed from a casual style to wearing business suits. He began to look more human and less dog-like, with his ears hidden in his hat. By 1951, Goofy was portrayed as being married and having a son of his own. Neither the wife nor the son was portrayed as dog-like. The wife&#x27;s face was never seen, but her form was human. The son lacked Goofy&#x27;s dog-like ears. One notable short made during this era is &quot;Motor Mania&quot; (1950). Kinney disliked making most of these later shorts, stating &quot;...those pictures were disasters, because I didn&#x27;t fight it hard enough&quot;. Goofy would also be given a formal name in these cartoons, George Geef.

Christopher P. Lehman connects this depiction of the character to Disney&#x27;s use of humor and animal characters to reinforce social conformity. He cites as an example &quot;Aquamania&quot; (1961), where everyman Goofy drives to the lake for a boat ride. During a scene depicting a pile-up accident, every car involved has a boat hitched to its rear bumper. Goofy is portrayed as one of the numerous people who had the same idea about how to spend their day. Every contestant in the boat race also looks like Goofy. Lehman does not think that Disney used these aspects of the film to poke fun at conformity. Instead, the studio apparently accepted conformity as a fundamental aspect of the society of the United States. &quot;Aquamania&quot; was released in the 1960s, but largely maintained and prolonged the status quo of the 1950s. The decade had changed, but the Disney studio followed the same story formulas for theatrical animated shorts it had followed in the previous decade. And Lehman points that Disney received social approval for it. &quot;Aquamania&quot; itself received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film.

===Later appearances===
After the 1965 educational film &quot;Goofy&#x27;s Freeway Troubles&quot;, Goofy was mostly retired except for cameos because of the cartoons&#x27; fading popularity and the death of voice actor Pinto Colvig. Goofy had an act in the 1969 tour show &quot;Disney on Parade&quot; with costar Herbie the Love Bug. His profile began to rise again after his appearance in &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot; as the ghost of Jacob Marley. After that, he appeared in &quot;Sport Goofy in Soccermania&quot;, a 1987 television special. He made a brief appearance in Disney/Amblin&#x27;s Academy Award-winning film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, in which the titular character, Roger Rabbit, says of Goofy: &quot;Nobody takes a wallop like Goofy! What timing! What finesse! What a genius!&quot;. He later appears at the end of the film with the other characters.
In the 1990s, Goofy got his own TV series called &quot;Goof Troop&quot;. In the show, Goofy lives with his son Max and his cat Waffles, and they live next door to Pete and his family. &quot;Goof Troop&quot; eventually led to Goofy and Max starring in their own movies: &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot; (in 1995) and &quot;An Extremely Goofy Movie&quot; (in 2000); as well as starring in their own segments of &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Once Upon a Christmas&quot; (in 1999) and &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Twice Upon a Christmas&quot; (in 2004). While Goofy is clearly depicted as a single custodial parent in all of these appearances, by the end of &quot;An Extremely Goofy Movie&quot; he begins a romance with the character Sylvia Marpole, Max being grown and in college by this point.

In one episode of &quot;Bonkers&quot;, Goofy has an off-screen cameo whose distinctive laugh is &quot;stolen&quot; by a disgruntled toon. In another episode, both he and Pete cameo as actors who film cartoons at Wackytoon Studios. And in a third episode, Goofy cameos as part of a group of civilians held hostage in a bank robbery.

Goofy returned to his traditional personality in &quot;Mickey Mouse Works&quot; and appeared as a head waiter in &quot;House of Mouse&quot; (2001 to 2003). Goofy&#x27;s son Max also appeared in &quot;House of Mouse&quot; as the nightclub&#x27;s valet, so that Goofy juggled not only his conventional antics but also the father-role displayed in &quot;Goof Troop&quot; and its aforementioned related media. In both &quot;Mickey Mouse Works&quot; and &quot;House of Mouse&quot;, Goofy also seemed to have a crush on Clarabelle Cow, as he asks her on a date in the &quot;House of Mouse&quot; episode &quot;Super Goof&quot; and is stalked by the bovine in the Mickey Mouse Works cartoon &quot;How To Be a Spy&quot;. Though Clarabelle was noted as Horace Horsecollar&#x27;s fiancé in early decades, comics from the 1960s and 1970s and in later cartoons like the aforementioned &quot;House of Mouse&quot; and &quot;Mickey Mouse Works&quot;, as well as &quot;Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers&quot;, imply some mutual affections between Goofy and Clarabelle; perhaps as an attempt for Disney to give Goofy a more mainstream girlfriend to match his two male co-stars.

On &quot;Toontown Online&quot;, an interactive website for kids, Goofy previously ran his own neighborhood called Goofy Speedway until the close of Toontown. Goofy Speedway was a place where players could race cars and enter the Grand Prix. Tickets were exclusively spent on everything there, instead of the usual jellybean currency. The Grand Prix only came on &quot;Grand Prix Monday&quot; and &quot;Silly Saturday&quot;. Goofy&#x27;s Gag Shop was also found in almost every part of Toontown&#x27; except Cog HQs, Goofy Speedway, or Chip &amp; Dale&#x27;s Acorn Acres. At Goofy&#x27;s Gag Shop, Toons could buy gags.

Goofy also appears in the children&#x27;s television series, &quot;Mickey Mouse Clubhouse&quot;, with his trademark attire and personality. Goofy appeared in &quot;The Lion King 1½&quot;. Goofy starred in a new theatrical cartoon short called &quot;How to Hook Up Your Home Theater&quot;, that premiered at the Ottawa International Animation Festival. The short received a positive review from animation historian Jerry Beck and then had a wide release on December 21, 2007, in front of &quot;National Treasure: Book of Secrets&quot; and has aired on several occasions on the Disney Channel.

In 2011, Goofy appeared in a promotional webtoon advertising Disney Cruise Line. He is also a main character on &quot;Mickey and the Roadster Racers&quot;. He has also appeared in the third season of the 2017 &quot;DuckTales&quot; TV series; based on his &quot;Goof Troop&quot; incarnation. Guest starring in the episode, &quot;Quack Pack&quot;, Goofy appears as the Duck family&#x27;s wacky neighbor after Donald accidentally wished them into a &#x27;90s sitcom. Donald hires him to be the photographer for a family photo, but after the Ducks realize what Donald did, Goofy helps him understand that &quot;normal&quot; does not necessarily mean the same thing between families; using the relationship he has with his son Max as an example.

In 2021, it was announced that Goofy would star in a new series of &quot;How to...&quot; shorts entitled &quot;How to Stay at Home&quot; in a reflection of the COVID-19 pandemic. Animator Eric Goldberg (the Genie from &quot;Aladdin&quot;) served as director of the shorts as well as supervising animator on one of them, while Mark Henn (Belle and Jasmine) and Randy Haycock (Naveen in &quot;The Princess and the Frog&quot;) served as supervising animators for other shorts. Bill Farmer once again voiced the Goof, with Corey Burton narrating. The shorts &quot;How to Wear a Mask&quot;, &quot;Learning to Cook&quot;, and &quot;Binge Watching&quot; were released on Disney+ on August 11, 2021.

==Comics==
Comic strips first called the character Dippy Dawg, but his name changed to Goofy by 1936. In the early years, the other members of Mickey Mouse&#x27;s gang considered him a meddler and a pest but eventually warmed up to him.

The &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; comic strip drawn by Floyd Gottfredson was generally based on what was going on in the Mickey Mouse shorts at the time, but when Donald Duck&#x27;s popularity led to Donald Duck gaining his own newspaper strip, Disney decided that he was no longer allowed to appear in Gottfredson&#x27;s strips. Accordingly, Goofy remained alone as Mickey&#x27;s sidekick, replacing Horace Horsecollar as Mickey&#x27;s fellow adventurer and companion. Similarly in comics, the Mickey Mouse world with Goofy as Mickey&#x27;s sidekick was usually very separate from the Donald Duck world and crossovers were rare. Goofy also has a characteristic habit of holding his hand in front of his mouth, a trademark that was introduced by Paul Murry.

A character called &quot;Glory-Bee&quot; was Goofy&#x27;s girlfriend for some years.

In 1990, when Disney was publishing their own comics, Goofy starred in &quot;Goofy Adventures&quot;, that featured him starring in various parodies. Perhaps because of poor sales, &quot;Goofy Adventures&quot; was the first of the company&#x27;s titles to be canceled by the Disney Comics Implosion, ending at its 17th issue.

===Super Goof===

Super Goof is Goofy&#x27;s superhero alter ego who gets his powers by eating super goobers (peanuts). Goofy became the first Disney character to also be a superhero, but several would follow, including Donald Duck as Paperinik.

The initial concept was developed by Disney Publications Dept. head George Sherman and Disney United Kingdom merchandising representative Peter Woods. It was passed on to Western Publishing scripter Del Connell who refined it, including the eventual device of peanuts providing superpowers.

The initial version of Super Goof appeared in &quot;The Phantom Blot meets Super Goof&quot;, in &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s The Phantom Blot&quot; No. 2 (Feb. 1965) by Connell (story) and Paul Murry (art). There Goofy mistakenly believes he has developed superpowers. A second version appeared as an actual superhero in the four-page story &quot;All&#x27;s Well That Ends Awful&quot; in &quot;Donald Duck&quot; No. 102 (July 1965), also by Connell and Murry.

The third and definitive version debuted in &quot;The Thief of Zanzipar&quot; in &quot;Walt Disney Super Goof&quot; No. 1 (Oct. 1965), written by Bob Ogle and drawn by Murry, in which the origin of his powers are special peanuts Goofy finds in his backyard. In this story, Super Goof battles the Super Thief, a scientific genius who shrinks world landmarks, and holds them for ransom.

The effect of Super Goof&#x27;s special peanuts is temporary, so the superpowers wear off after a couple of hours. Many stories use this as a comical effect with the powers wearing off at the most inappropriate time. The peanuts give similar superpowers to whoever eats them, not just Goofy. In some stories, random criminals who have accidentally eaten the peanuts have temporarily become supervillains.

In a crossover story, Huey, Dewey and Louie found a super goober plant sprouted by a dropped goober, and &quot;borrowed&quot; Super Goof&#x27;s powers; after doing a round of super deeds, the ducks&#x27; powers faded, and they had to be rescued by the Junior Woodchucks. On occasion, Gilbert uses the super goobers to become a superhero under the name Super Gilbert, beginning with the story &quot;The Twister Resisters&quot; in &quot;Walt Disney Super Goof&quot; No. 5.

Gold Key Comics subsequently published the comic-book series &quot;Walt Disney Super Goof&quot; for 74 issues through 1984. A handful of stories were scripted by Mark Evanier. Additional Super Goof stories (both original and reprints) appeared in &quot;Walt Disney Comics Digest&quot;. The Dynabrite comics imprint issued by Western in the late 1970s and &quot;Disney Comic Album&quot; No. 8 (1990) from Disney Comics contained reprints. Gemstone reprinted a Disney Studio Program story written by Evanier and drawn by Jack Bradbury as a backup in its 2006 release &quot;Return of the Blotman&quot;.

On Disney&#x27;s &quot;Toontown Online&quot; during the Halloween season, Goofy is Super Goof for the occasion. He also appeared in one episode of &quot;House of Mouse&quot; (&quot;Super Goof&quot;) and in two episodes of &quot;Mickey Mouse Clubhouse&quot; (&quot;Goofy&#x27;s Super Wish&quot; and &quot;Super Goof&#x27;s Super Puzzle&quot;). In the television series &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot;, Goofy dresses as Super Goof for the half-hour Halloween special &quot;The Scariest Story Ever: A Mickey Mouse Halloween Spooktacular!&quot;.

==In video games==
===&quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series===
Goofy is the captain of the royal guard at Disney Castle in the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; video game series. Goofy reappears in the prequel, &quot;Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep&quot;, in a relatively minor role.

==Voice actors==
Pinto Colvig voiced Goofy for most of his classic appearances from 1932 (&quot;Mickey&#x27;s Revue&quot;) to 1938 (&quot;The Whalers&quot;) when he had a fallout with Disney and left the company to work on other projects. He was later replaced by Jack Bailey in 1939, and George Johnson from 1940 to 1942 (Johnson would also voice Goofy in &quot;No Sail&quot; in 1945). However, Colvig returned to Disney and resumed the role in 1944 (&quot;How to Be a Sailor&quot;) until shortly before his death in 1967. One of his last known performances as the character was for the Telephone Pavilion at Expo 67. Many cartoons featured Goofy silent, recycled dialogue from earlier shorts, or had various different-sounding Goofys instead of the original. Colvig also gave Goofy a normal voice for four George Geef shorts.

Stuart Buchanan voiced Goofy in &quot;The Mickey Mouse Theater of the Air&quot;. Richard Edwards voiced Goofy in the end of &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Trailer&quot; and some lines in &quot;The Whaler&quot;. Jimmy MacDonald, the voice of Mickey Mouse, voiced Goofy in &quot;Californy&#x27;er Bust&quot;, &quot;Lion Down&quot; and the 1960s Disney album, &quot;Donald Duck and his Friends&quot;. Cactus Mack provided Goofy&#x27;s narration voiceover in &quot;Californy&#x27;er Bust&quot;. Bob Jackman took Colvig&#x27;s place when he left the Disney Studios for unknown reasons and voiced Goofy in 1951 for a brief time. Gilbert Mack voiced Goofy in the 1955 Golden Records record, &quot;Goofy the Toreador&quot;. Bill Lee provided the singing voice for Goofy on the 1964 record, &quot;Children&#x27;s Riddles and Game Songs.&quot; Peter Hawkins voiced Goofy in the ITV children&#x27;s series &quot;Disney Wonderland&quot; from 1966 to 1967. Hal Smith began voicing Goofy in 1967 after Pinto Colvig&#x27;s death and voiced him until &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot; in 1983. Walker Edmiston voiced Goofy in the Disneyland record album &quot;An Adaptation of Dickens&#x27; Christmas Carol, Performed by The Walt Disney Players&quot; in 1974. Tony Pope voiced Goofy in the 1979 Disney album &quot;Mickey Mouse Disco&quot; for the song, &quot;Watch Out for Goofy&quot;. He then voiced him in &quot;Sport Goofy in Soccermania&quot; in 1987 and &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; in 1988. Jack Wagner voiced Goofy and other Disney characters in the 1980s, primarily for live entertainment offerings in the parks, &quot;Disney on Ice&quot; shows, and live-action clips for television. Will Ryan did the voice for &quot;DTV Valentine&quot; in 1986 and &quot;Down and Out with Donald Duck&quot; in 1987.

Aside from those occasions, Bill Farmer has been voicing Goofy since 1987. While Pope was the sole voice credit for Goofy in &quot;Roger Rabbit&quot;, Farmer actually provided some of Goofy&#x27;s lines in the movie as well. Farmer closely imitated Colvig for projects like &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot; but began putting his own spin on the character in 1992&#x27;s &quot;Goof Troop&quot;. Farmer also inherited Colvig&#x27;s other characters, like Pluto, Sleepy, and Practical Pig. Although, in 2001, Jason Marsden (voice actor of Goofy&#x27;s son Max) provided the voice of Goofy in the DVD storybook adaptation of the 1994 children&#x27;s storybook &quot;Me and My Dad&quot;, included as a bonus feature on the DVD release of &quot;An Extremely Goofy Movie&quot;.

==Relatives==
===Max Goof===

Max Goof is Goofy&#x27;s teenage son. He first appeared in the 1992 television series &quot;Goof Troop&quot; and stars in both the spin-off film &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot; (1995) and its direct-to-video sequel &quot;An Extremely Goofy Movie&quot; (2000). He also features in the direct-to-video &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Once Upon a Christmas&quot; (1999), its sequel &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Twice Upon a Christmas&quot; (2004), and the 2001 TV series &quot;House of Mouse&quot;. Max is a playable character on the Super NES video game &quot;Goof Troop&quot; (1993), the PlayStation 2 video game &quot;Disney Golf&quot; (2002), and the PC video game &quot;Disney&#x27;s Extremely Goofy Skateboarding&quot; (2001).

Max is one of the few Disney characters aside from his best friend P.J. and Huey, Dewey, and Louie, child or otherwise, who has actually aged in subsequent appearances. He was depicted as an eleven-year-old middle school student in &quot;Goof Troop&quot;, then a high school student in &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot;, and then a high school graduate teenager starting college in &quot;An Extremely Goofy Movie&quot;. In &quot;House of Mouse&quot;, he is still a teenager but old enough to be employed as a parking valet.

<doc id="72806" wikidata="Q488260" url="?curid=72806" title="Jefferson Airplane">
<text>Jefferson Airplane was an American rock band formed in San Francisco, California, in 1965. One of the pioneering bands of psychedelic rock, the group defined the San Francisco Sound and was the first from the Bay Area to achieve international commercial success. They headlined the Monterey Pop Festival (1967), Woodstock (1969), Altamont Free Concert (1969), and the first Isle of Wight Festival (1968) in England. Their 1967 breakout album &quot;Surrealistic Pillow&quot; was one of the most significant recordings of the Summer of Love. Two songs from that album, &quot;Somebody to Love&quot; and &quot;White Rabbit&quot;, are among &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;.

The October 1966 to February 1970 lineup of Jefferson Airplane, consisting of Marty Balin (vocals), Paul Kantner (guitar, vocals), Grace Slick (vocals, keyboards), Jorma Kaukonen (lead guitar, vocals), Jack Casady (bass), and Spencer Dryden (drums), was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. Balin left the band in 1971. After 1972, Jefferson Airplane effectively split into two groups. Kaukonen and Casady moved on full-time to their own band, Hot Tuna. Slick, Kantner, and the remaining members of Jefferson Airplane recruited new members and regrouped as Jefferson Starship in 1974, with Balin eventually joining them. Jefferson Airplane received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2016.

==History==
===1965–1966: Formation and early development===
In 1962, 20-year-old Marty Balin recorded two singles for Challenge Records, neither of which was successful. He then played in a folk quartet, the Town Criers, from April 1963 to June 1964. With the Beatles-led British Invasion, Balin was inspired by the emerging folk rock genre to form a group in March 1965 that would follow that lead, as well as opening a nightclub for them to perform. With a group of investors, he purchased a former pizza parlor on Fillmore Street in San Francisco and converted it into a club called the Matrix. Meanwhile, he searched for like-minded musicians to form his group.

Balin met fellow folk guitarist and singer Paul Kantner during a hootenanny at another local club, the Drinking Gourd, and invited Kantner to join him in putting together a band. A native San Franciscan, Kantner had started out performing on the Bay Area folk circuit in the early 1960s, alongside fellow folkies Jerry Garcia and David Crosby. He cited folk groups like the Kingston Trio and the Weavers as strong early influences. He briefly moved to Los Angeles in 1964 to work in a folk duo with future Airplane/Starship member David Freiberg (who subsequently joined Quicksilver Messenger Service).

Balin and Kantner then recruited other musicians to form the house band at the Matrix. They hired bluegrass acoustic bassist Bob Harvey and former Marine Band drummer Jerry Peloquin. Both Kantner and Balin wanted the group to have a female singer. After hearing vocalist Signe Toly Anderson at the Drinking Gourd, Balin invited her to be the group&#x27;s co-lead singer. Anderson sang with the band for a year and performed on their first album before departing in October 1966 after the birth of her first child.

They still needed a lead guitarist. Kantner recruited an old friend, blues guitarist Jorma Kaukonen, who auditioned for the group and joined them in June, completing the original lineup. Originally from Washington, D.C., Kaukonen had moved to California in the early 1960s and met Kantner at Santa Clara University in 1962. Kaukonen was invited to jam with the new band, and although initially reluctant to join, he was won over after playing his guitar through a tape delay device that was part of the sound system used by Ken Kesey for his Acid Test parties.

Kaukonen came up with the band name &quot;Jefferson Airplane&quot;. It was based on the nickname &quot;Blind Thomas Jefferson Airplane,&quot; which was given to Kaukonen by his friend Richmond &quot;Steve&quot; Talbot, inspired by the name of one of Kaukonen&#x27;s influences, bluesman Blind Lemon Jefferson. According to Kaukonen, &quot;The band was coming up with all these really stupid names and I said, &#x27;If you want something really silly, try Jefferson Airplane.&#x27;&quot;

At a music shop near the Matrix, Peloquin encountered Matthew Katz, a music manager who was searching for a band to work with. Katz had beforehand offered to manage the Town Criers, Balin&#x27;s previous group, but was turned down because of disagreements over his terms. Peloquin reintroduced Katz to Balin, who had been trying to find a manager for Jefferson Airplane. Katz enticed the band by mentioning that he had access to an unreleased Bob Dylan song, &quot;Lay Down Your Weary Tune&quot;, and they appointed him as their manager, although they did not officially sign a contract with Katz until December 1965.
After rehearsing throughout the summer, the group made its first public appearance as Jefferson Airplane at the opening night of The Matrix on August 13, 1965. The band expanded from its folk roots, drawing inspiration from the Beatles, the Byrds and the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful, and gradually developed a more pop-oriented electric sound. Later that month, John L. Wasserman of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; praised the band&#x27;s &quot;musical approach and style&quot;—noting their blend of folk, blues, and rock and roll—and remarked, &quot;Although there are but hints at this time, it is entirely possible that this will be the new direction of contemporary pop music.&quot;

A few weeks after the group started performing, Peloquin departed because of conflicts with his bandmates, in part because of his disdain for their drug use. Although he was not a drummer, singer-guitarist Skip Spence (who later co-founded Moby Grape) was then invited to replace Peloquin. Spence quickly adapted and made his debut at the Matrix in September. In October 1965, after the other members decided that Bob Harvey&#x27;s bass playing was not up to par, he was replaced by guitarist-bassist Jack Casady, an old friend of Kaukonen from Washington, D.C. Casady played his first gig with the Airplane on October 30 in the Harmon Gym at the University of California, Berkeley.

The group&#x27;s performance skills improved rapidly and they soon gained a strong following in and around San Francisco, aided by reviews from music journalist Ralph J. Gleason, the jazz critic of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;. After seeing them at the Matrix, Gleason wrote in the September 13 edition of his &quot;On the Town&quot; column that the band, still without a record deal, would &quot;obviously record for someone&quot; eventually. Gleason&#x27;s support raised the band&#x27;s profile considerably, and within three months Katz was fielding offers from recording companies, although they had yet to perform outside the San Francisco Bay Area.
Two significant early concerts featuring the Airplane were held in late 1965. The first was the historic dance at the Longshoremen&#x27;s Hall in San Francisco on October 16, 1965, the first of many &quot;happenings&quot; in the Bay Area, where Gleason first saw them perform. At this concert they were supported by a local folk-rock group, the Great Society, that featured Grace Slick as lead singer, and it was here that Kantner met Slick for the first time. A few weeks later, on November 6, they appeared at a benefit concert for the San Francisco Mime Troupe, the first of many promotions by rising Bay Area entrepreneur Bill Graham, who later became the band&#x27;s manager.

By late 1965, Jefferson Airplane, under Katz&#x27;s management, had turned down recording offers from Capitol, Valiant, Fantasy, Elektra, and London. In November 1965, Jefferson Airplane signed a recording contract with RCA Victor, which included a then unheard-of advance of $25,000 (). Before this, they had recorded a demo for Columbia Records of &quot;The Other Side Of This Life&quot; with Harvey on bass, which was immediately rejected by the label. On December 10, 1965, the Airplane played at the first Bill Graham-promoted show at the Fillmore Auditorium, supported by the Great Society and others. The Airplane also appeared at numerous Family Dog shows promoted by Chet Helms at the Avalon Ballroom.
The group&#x27;s first single was Balin&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s No Secret&quot; (a tune he wrote with Otis Redding in mind); the B-side was &quot;Runnin&#x27; Round This World&quot;, the song that led to the band&#x27;s first clash with RCA Victor over the lyric &quot;The nights I&#x27;ve spent with you have been fantastic trips&quot;. After their debut LP was completed in March 1966, Skip Spence quit the band and he was eventually replaced by Spencer Dryden, who played his first show with the Airplane at the Berkeley Folk Festival on July 4, 1966. Dryden had previously played with a Los Angeles group called the Ashes, which later became the Peanut Butter Conspiracy.

Original manager Katz was fired in August, sparking a long-running legal battle that continued until 1987, and Balin&#x27;s friend and roommate Bill Thompson was installed as road manager and temporary band manager. It was Thompson, a friend and staunch supporter of the band and a former &quot;Chronicle&quot; staffer, who had convinced reviewers Ralph Gleason and John Wasserman to see the band at the Matrix. Thanks to Gleason&#x27;s influence, Thompson was able to book the group for appearances at the Monterey Jazz Festival.

The group&#x27;s debut LP &quot;Jefferson Airplane Takes Off&quot; was released on August 15, 1966. The album was dominated by Balin, who provided most of the lead vocals and had a hand in writing all of the original material, including &quot;It&#x27;s No Secret&quot; and &quot;Come Up the Years.&quot; It also contained covers of &quot;Tobacco Road&quot;, Dino Valente&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Together&quot;, and &quot;Chauffeur Blues&quot;, which became a signature tune for Anderson. RCA Victor initially pressed only 15,000 copies, but it sold more than 10,000 in San Francisco alone, prompting the label to reprint it. For the re-pressing, the company deleted &quot;Runnin&#x27; Round This World&quot; (which had appeared on early mono pressings), because executives objected to the word &quot;trip&quot; in the lyrics. For similar reasons, RCA Victor substituted altered versions for two other tracks: &quot;Let Me In&quot;, changing the line &quot;I gotta get in/you know where&quot; to &quot;you shut your door/now it ain&#x27;t fair.&quot; In the same song, they also switched the lyric &quot;Don&#x27;t tell me you want money&quot; to &quot;Don&#x27;t tell me it ain&#x27;t funny&quot;. &quot;Run Around&quot; was also edited, changing the line &quot;flowers that sway as you lay under me&quot; to &quot;flowers that sway as you stay here by me&quot;. The original pressings of the LP featuring &quot;Runnin&#x27; &#x27;Round This World&quot; and the uncensored versions of &quot;Let Me In&quot; and &quot;Run Around&quot; are collectors items.

Signe Anderson gave birth to her daughter in May 1966, and in October she announced her departure from the band. Her final performance with the Airplane took place at the Fillmore on October 15, 1966. A recording of the performance, subtitled &quot;Signe&#x27;s Farewell&quot;, was released in 2010.

===1966–1967: Commercial breakthrough===

The following night, Anderson&#x27;s successor, Grace Slick made her first appearance. Slick had seen the Airplane at the Matrix in 1965, and her previous group, the Great Society, had often supported them in concert.

Slick&#x27;s recruitment proved pivotal to the Airplane&#x27;s commercial breakthrough—she possessed a powerful and supple contralto voice that complemented Balin&#x27;s and was well-suited to the group&#x27;s amplified psychedelic music. A former model, her good looks and stage presence greatly enhanced the group&#x27;s live impact. &quot;White Rabbit&quot; was written by Slick while she was still with The Great Society. The first album she recorded with Jefferson Airplane was &quot;Surrealistic Pillow&quot;, its 1967 breakout album. Slick provided two songs from her previous group: her own &quot;White Rabbit&quot; and &quot;Somebody to Love&quot;, written by her brother-in-law Darby Slick. Both songs became breakout successes for Jefferson Airplane and have ever since been associated with that band.

The Great Society had recorded an early version of &quot;Somebody to Love&quot; (under the title &quot;Someone to Love&quot;) as the B-side of their only single, &quot;Free Advice&quot;, produced by Sylvester Stewart (soon to become famous as Sly Stone). It reportedly took more than 50 takes to achieve a satisfactory rendition. The Great Society split up in late 1966 and played its last show on September 11. Soon after, Slick was asked to join Jefferson Airplane by Casady (whose musicianship was a major influence on her decision) and her Great Society contract was bought out for $750.

In December 1966, Jefferson Airplane was featured in a &quot;Newsweek&quot; article about the booming San Francisco music scene, one of the first in a welter of similar media reports that prompted a massive influx of young people to the city and contributed to the commercialization of hippie culture.

Around the beginning of 1967, Bill Graham took over from Thompson as manager. In January the group made its first visit to the East Coast. On January 14, alongside the Grateful Dead and Quicksilver Messenger Service, Jefferson Airplane headlined the &quot;Human Be-In&quot;, the famous all-day &quot;happening&quot; in Golden Gate Park, one of the key events leading up to the &quot;Summer of Love&quot;.

During this period the band gained its first international recognition when rising British pop star Donovan, who saw them during his stint on the U.S. West Coast in early 1966, mentioned the Airplane in his song &quot;The Fat Angel&quot;, which subsequently appeared on his &quot;Sunshine Superman&quot; LP.

The group&#x27;s second LP record|LP, &quot;Surrealistic Pillow&quot;, recorded in Los Angeles with producer Rick Jarrard in 13 days at a cost of $8,000, launched the Airplane to international fame. Released in February 1967, the LP entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart on March 25 and remained there for over a year, peaking at No. 3. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. The name &quot;Surrealistic Pillow&quot; was suggested by the album&#x27;s informal producer, Jerry Garcia, when he mentioned that, as a whole, the album sounded &quot;as surrealistic as a pillow is soft.&quot; Although RCA did not acknowledge Garcia&#x27;s contributions to the album with a production credit, he is listed in the album&#x27;s credits as &quot;spiritual advisor.&quot;

In addition to the group&#x27;s two best-known tracks, &quot;White Rabbit&quot; and &quot;Somebody to Love&quot;, the album featured &quot;My Best Friend&quot; by former drummer Skip Spence, Balin&#x27;s driving blues-rock songs &quot;Plastic Fantastic Lover&quot; and &quot;3/5 of a Mile in 10 Seconds&quot;, and the atmospheric Balin-Kantner ballad &quot;Today&quot;. A reminder of their earlier folk incarnation was Kaukonen&#x27;s solo acoustic guitar &quot;tour de force&quot; &quot;Embryonic Journey&quot; (his first composition), which referenced contemporary acoustic guitar masters such as John Fahey and helped to establish the popular genre exemplified by acoustic guitarist Leo Kottke.

The first single from the album, &quot;My Best Friend&quot;, failed to chart, but the next two rocketed the group to prominence. Both &quot;Somebody to Love&quot; and &quot;White Rabbit&quot; became major U.S. hits, the former reaching No. 5 and the latter No. 8 on the Billboard singles chart. By late 1967 the Airplane were national and international stars and had become one of the hottest groups in America. Grace Slick biographer Barbara Rowes called the album &quot;a declaration of independence from the establishment [-] What Airplane originated was a romanticism for the electronic age. Unlike the highly homogenized harmonies of the Beach Boys, Airplane never strived for a synthesis of its divergent sensibilities. Through [-] each song, there remain strains of the individual styles of the musicians [creating] unusual breadth and original interplay within each structure&quot;.

This phase of the Airplane&#x27;s career peaked with their famous performance at the Monterey International Pop Festival in June 1967. Monterey showcased leading bands from several major music &quot;scenes&quot; including New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and the United Kingdom, and the resulting TV and film coverage gave national (and international) exposure to groups that had previously had only regional fame. Two songs from the Airplane&#x27;s set were subsequently included in the D. A. Pennebaker film documentary of the event.

In August 1967, the Airplane performed in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, at two free outdoor concerts, along with fellow Bay Area band the Grateful Dead. The first concert was held in downtown Montreal at Place Ville Marie, and the second was at the Youth Pavilion of Expo 67.

The Airplane also benefited greatly from appearances on national network TV shows such as &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; on NBC and &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; on CBS. The Airplane&#x27;s famous appearance on &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot; performing &quot;White Rabbit&quot; and &quot;Somebody to Love&quot; was videotaped in color and augmented by developments in video techniques. It has been frequently re-screened and is notable for its pioneering use of the Chroma key process to simulate the Airplane&#x27;s psychedelic light show.

===1967–1970: Heavier sound and improvisation===
After &quot;Surrealistic Pillow&quot;, the group&#x27;s music underwent a significant transformation. The band&#x27;s third LP, &quot;After Bathing at Baxter&#x27;s&quot;, was released in December, 1967 and eventually peaked in the charts at No. 17. Its famous cover, drawn by artist and cartoonist Ron Cobb, depicts a flying machine (constructed around an idealized version of a typical Haight-Ashbury district house) soaring above the chaos of American commercial culture. Recorded over a period of more than four months, with little input from nominal producer Al Schmitt, the new album demonstrated the group&#x27;s growing engagement with psychedelic rock. Although the previous LP had consisted entirely of standard-length pop songs, &quot;After Bathing at Baxter&#x27;s&quot; was dominated by long multi-part suites. However, &quot;A Small Package of Value Will Come to You, Shortly&quot; was a musique concrète-style audio collage.

&quot;After Bathing at Baxter&#x27;s&quot; also marked the ascendency of Kantner and Slick as the band&#x27;s chief composers and the concurrent decline of Balin&#x27;s influence and involvement. The other members, gravitating toward a harder-edged style, openly criticized Balin for his ballad-oriented compositions. Balin was also reportedly becoming increasingly disenchanted with the &quot;star trips&quot; and &quot;inflated egos&quot; generated by the band&#x27;s runaway commercial success.

In contrast to &quot;White Rabbit&quot; and &quot;Somebody to Love&quot;, &quot;The Ballad of You and Me and Pooneil&quot; only peaked at No. 42 and &quot;Watch Her Ride&quot; stalled at No. 61. However, both singles reached the Top 40 in &quot;Cash Box&quot; magazine. None of the band&#x27;s subsequent singles reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 40 and several failed to chart at all. AM Top 40 radio became wary of a group that had scored a hit with a song that contained thinly veiled drug references and whose singles were often deemed too controversial, so Jefferson Airplane never again enjoyed the kind of widespread AM radio support that served as a prerequisite for top-ten hits.

In February 1968, manager Bill Graham was fired after Slick delivered an &quot;either he goes or I go&quot; ultimatum. Bill Thompson took over as permanent manager and consolidated the group&#x27;s financial security, establishing Icebag Corp. to oversee the band&#x27;s publishing interests and purchasing a 20-room mansion at 2400 Fulton Street across from Golden Gate Park near the Haight-Ashbury, which became the band&#x27;s office and communal residence. Bill Laudner was hired as road manager.

In mid-1968, the group was photographed for a &quot;Life&quot; magazine story on &quot;The New Rock&quot;, appearing on the cover of the June 28, 1968 edition. They undertook their first major tour of Europe in August–September 1968, playing alongside the Doors in the Netherlands, England, Germany and Sweden. In a notorious incident at a concert in Amsterdam, while Jefferson Airplane was performing &quot;Plastic Fantastic Lover&quot;, Doors singer Jim Morrison, under the influence of a combination of drugs that fans had given him, appeared on stage and began dancing &quot;like a pinwheel&quot;. As the group played faster and faster, Morrison spun around wildly until he finally fell senseless on the stage at Balin&#x27;s feet. Morrison was unable to perform his set with the Doors and was hospitalized; keyboardist Ray Manzarek sang all the vocals. It was also during this tour that Slick and Morrison allegedly engaged in a brief sexual relationship, described in &quot;Somebody to Love?,&quot; Slick&#x27;s 1998 autobiography.

Jefferson Airplane&#x27;s fourth LP, &quot;Crown of Creation&quot; (released in September 1968), was a commercial success, peaking at No. 6 on the album chart and receiving a gold certification. Slick&#x27;s &quot;Lather&quot;, which opens the album, is said to be about her affair with drummer Spencer Dryden and his 30th birthday. &quot;Triad&quot;, a David Crosby composition, had been rejected by the Byrds because they deemed its subject matter (a &quot;ménage à trois&quot;) to be too &quot;hot.&quot; Slick&#x27;s searing sexual and social-commentary anthem &quot;Greasy Heart&quot; was released as a single in March 1968. A few tracks recorded for the LP were omitted from the album but were later included as bonus tracks, including the Slick/Frank Zappa collaboration &quot;Would You Like a Snack?&quot;

Jefferson Airplane&#x27;s appearance on &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot; in October of 1968 caused a minor stir when Slick appeared in blackface and raised her fist in the Black Panther Party&#x27;s salute after singing &quot;Crown of Creation&quot;.

In November 1968, the band played &quot;House at Pooneil Corners&quot; and part of &quot;Somebody to Love&quot; on the roof of the Schuyler Hotel on West 45th Street in Manhattan. It was filmed for the D. A. Pennebaker film &quot;One P.M&quot;. at the invitation of French filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard. As no permit had been obtained, the performance was stopped by the police just as occurred with the Beatles&#x27; famous rooftop concert about two months later, as depicted in the documentary &quot;Let It Be&quot; (1970). Several people, including Balin and actor Rip Torn, were arrested.

In February 1969, RCA released the live album &quot;Bless Its Pointed Little Head&quot;, which was culled from 1968 performances at the Fillmore West on October 24–26 and the Fillmore East on November 28–30. It became the band&#x27;s fourth Top 20 album, peaking at No. 17.

Hot Tuna began during a break in Jefferson Airplane&#x27;s touring schedule in early 1969 while Slick recovered from throat node surgery that left her unable to perform. Kaukonen, Casady, Kantner and drummer Joey Covington played several shows around San Francisco, including Jefferson Airplane&#x27;s original club, The Matrix, before Jefferson Airplane resumed performing. Their early repertoire was derived mainly from Jefferson Airplane material that Kaukonen (the band&#x27;s frontman) sang and covers of American ragtime artist Jelly Roll Morton and country blues artists such as Reverend Gary Davis, Bo Carter and Blind Blake. From October 1969 to November 1970, Hot Tuna (also including Balin and, following Kantner&#x27;s departure, a dedicated rhythm guitarist in their electric performances until November 1970) performed as the opening act to Jefferson Airplane with a combination of both electric and acoustic sets.

In April 1969, sessions began for Jefferson Airplane&#x27;s next album, &quot;Volunteers&quot;, using new 16-track facilities at the Wally Heider Studio in San Francisco. This proved to be the last album by the classic lineup of the group. The album&#x27;s release was delayed following the band&#x27;s conflict with the label over the content of songs such as &quot;We Can Be Together&quot; and the planned title of the album, &quot;Volunteers of Amerika&quot;, a title derived from the Volunteers of America charity, and the term was in vogue in 1969 as an ironic expression of dissatisfaction with Americ. After the charity group objected, the title was shortened to &quot;Volunteers&quot;.

A few days after the band headlined at a free concert in New York&#x27;s Central Park in August 1969, they performed in what Slick called the &quot;morning maniac music&quot; slot at the Woodstock Festival, for which the group was joined by noted British session keyboard player Nicky Hopkins. When interviewed about Woodstock by Jeff Tamarkin in 1992, Kantner recalled it with fondness but Slick and Dryden did not. Immediately after their Woodstock performance, the band taped an appearance on &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot; and played a few songs. Other guests on that same episode were David Crosby, Stephen Stills and Joni Mitchell.

The new album was finally released in the United States in November 1969. It continued Jefferson Airplane&#x27;s run of Top 20 LPs, peaking at No. 13 and attaining a RIAA gold certification early in 1970. It was their most political venture, showcasing the group&#x27;s vocal opposition to the Vietnam War and documenting their reaction to the changing political atmosphere in the United States. The best-known tracks include &quot;Volunteers&quot;, &quot;We Can Be Together&quot;, &quot;Good Shepherd&quot; and the post-apocalyptic &quot;Wooden Ships&quot;, which Kantner cowrote with Crosby and Stills, and which Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash also recorded on their debut album.

RCA raised objections to the phrase &quot;up against the wall, motherfucker!&quot; in the lyrics of Kantner&#x27;s &quot;We Can Be Together&quot;, but the group managed to prevent it from being censored on the album, pointing out that RCA had already allowed the offending word to be included on the cast album of the rock musical &quot;Hair&quot;. In addition, the song had the line &quot;in order to survive, we steal, cheat, lie, forge, fuck, hide and deal&quot;, which was also kept on the album. The group sang the song with both lines intact during their &quot;Dick Cavett Show&quot; appearance, thus becoming the first known persons to utter those words on national broadcast television. In the printed lyrics that accompanied the album, the line was transcribed as &quot;up against the wall fred&quot;.

In December 1969, Jefferson Airplane played at the Altamont Free Concert at Altamont Speedway in California. Following the Grateful Dead&#x27;s withdrawal from the program, they became the only band to perform at all three of the iconic rock festivals of the 1960s—Altamont, Monterey Pop and Woodstock. Headlined by the Rolling Stones, the concert was marred by violence. Balin was punched on stage during a scuffle with Hells Angels members who had been hired to act as security guards. The event became notorious for the fatal stabbing of teenager Meredith Hunter in front of the stage by Hells Angels after he drew a revolver during the Rolling Stones&#x27; performance.

===1970–1974: Decline and dissolution===
Dryden was dismissed from the band in February 1970 by a unanimous vote of the other members. Dryden had political differences with the band and was experiencing burnout after four years on the &quot;acid merry-go-round&quot;. He was also deeply disillusioned by the events at Altamont, which, he later recalled, &quot;did not look like a bunch of happy hippies in streaming colors. It looked more like sepia-toned Hieronymus Bosch.&quot; He took time off before returning to music the following year as Mickey Hart&#x27;s replacement in the New Riders of the Purple Sage. Dryden was replaced by Hot Tuna drummer Joey Covington, who had already contributed additional percussion to &quot;Volunteers&quot; and performed select engagements with Jefferson Airplane as a touring second drummer in 1969. Later that year, the band was further augmented by the addition of veteran jazz violinist Papa John Creach, a friend of Covington who officially joined Hot Tuna and Jefferson Airplane for their fall tour in October 1970.
Touring continued throughout 1970, but the group&#x27;s only new recordings that year were the single &quot;Mexico&quot; backed with the B-side &quot;Have You Seen the Saucers?&quot; Slick&#x27;s &quot;Mexico&quot; was an attack on President Richard Nixon&#x27;s Operation Intercept, which had been implemented to curtail the flow of marijuana into the United States. &quot;Have You Seen the Saucers&quot; marked the beginning of the science-fiction themes that Kantner explored in much of his subsequent work, including &quot;Blows Against the Empire,&quot; his first solo album. Released in November 1970 and credited to &quot;Paul Kantner/Jefferson Starship,&quot; this prototypical iteration of Jefferson Starship (alternatively known as the Planet Earth Rock and Roll Orchestra) included Crosby, Graham Nash, Grateful Dead members Jerry Garcia, Bill Kreutzmann and Mickey Hart, session luminary Harvey Brooks, David Freiberg, Slick, Covington and Casady. &quot;Blows Against the Empire&quot; peaked at No. 20 in the United States and was the first rock album nominated for the Hugo Award.

Jefferson Airplane ended 1970 with their traditional Thanksgiving Day engagement at the Fillmore East (marking the final performances of the short-lived Creach-era septet) and the release of their first compilation album, &quot;The Worst of Jefferson Airplane&quot;, which continued their unbroken run of post-1967 chart success, reaching No. 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart.

1971 was a year of major upheaval for Jefferson Airplane. Slick and Kantner had begun a relationship in 1970, and on January 25, 1971, their daughter China Wing Kantner (&quot;Wing&quot; was Slick&#x27;s maiden name) was born. Slick&#x27;s divorce from her first husband had recently become official, but she and Kantner agreed that they did not wish to marry.

In April 1971, Balin officially left Jefferson Airplane after disassociating himself from the group following the fall 1970 tour. Although he had remained a key part of live performances after the band&#x27;s creative direction shifted from brooding love songs, the evolution of the polarized Kantner/Slick and Kaukonen/Casady cliques—compounded by an emerging drinking problem—had finally left him the odd man out. Following the traumatic death of Janis Joplin, he began to pursue a healthier lifestyle; Balin&#x27;s study of yoga and abstention from drugs and alcohol further distanced him from the other members of the group, whose drug intake continued unabated. This further complicated the recording of their long-overdue follow-up to &quot;Volunteers&quot;; Balin had recently completed several new songs, including &quot;Emergency&quot; and the elongated R&amp;B-infused &quot;You Wear Your Dresses Too Short,&quot; both of which later appeared on archival releases.

On May 13, 1971, Slick was injured in a near-fatal automobile crash when her car slammed into a wall in a tunnel near the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. The accident happened while she was drag racing with Kaukonen; both were driving at over 100 miles per hour, and Kaukonen claims that he &quot;saved her life&quot; by pulling her from the car. Slick&#x27;s recuperation took a few months, forcing the Airplane to curtail their touring commitments. In the meantime, Slick recorded a comic song (&quot;Never Argue with a German If You&#x27;re Tired or European Song&quot;) about the incident for the new album.

In September 1971, &quot;Bark&quot; was released. With cover art depicting a dead fish wrapped in an A&amp;P-style grocery bag, it was both the final album owed to RCA under the band&#x27;s existing contract and the inaugural release on the band&#x27;s Grunt Records vanity label. Manager Bill Thompson had struck a deal with RCA to allow Jefferson Airplane to run Grunt Records as they saw fit while retaining RCA&#x27;s distribution. The single &quot;Pretty As You Feel&quot;, excerpted from a longer jam with members of Santana and featuring lead vocals by Joey Covington, its principal composer, was the last Jefferson Airplane chart hit, peaking at No. 60 in &quot;Billboard&quot; and No. 35 in &quot;Cashbox&quot;. The album rose to No. 11 in &quot;Billboard&quot;, higher than &quot;Volunteers&quot;, &quot;Blows Against the Empire&quot; and Hot Tuna&#x27;s second album, &quot;First Pull Up, Then Pull Down&quot;, released three months before &quot;Bark&quot; in June.

Despite the band&#x27;s continued success, major creative and personal divisions persisted between the Slick-Kantner and Kaukonen-Casady factions. (Kaukonen&#x27;s &quot;Third Week In The Chelsea,&quot; from &quot;Bark&quot;, chronicles the thoughts he was having about leaving the band.) These problems continued to be exacerbated by the band&#x27;s escalating cocaine use and Slick&#x27;s alcohol use disorder. Consequently, while the band played several dates in August in support of &quot;Bark&quot; (including two concerts in the New York metropolitan area and a show apiece in Detroit and Philadelphia), no tour was planned. Following a private concert/party commemorating the formation of Grunt Records at San Francisco&#x27;s Friends and Relations Hall in September, the band would not reconvene until several Midwestern engagements in January 1972.

Jefferson Airplane held together long enough to record one more album, &quot;Long John Silver,&quot; begun in April 1972 and released in July. By this time the various members were thoroughly engaged with their various solo projects. Following the release of Kantner and Slick&#x27;s &quot;Sunfighter&quot; in November 1971 and Creach&#x27;s eponymous solo debut in December 1971, Hot Tuna released their first studio album and third opus &quot;Burgers&quot; in February 1972; meanwhile, Covington immersed himself in various Grunt Records projects, including his own solo album, &quot;Fat Fandango&quot;, released in 1973, and the sessions for Black Kangaroo&#x27;s debut album led by multi-instrumentalist Peter Kaukonen, Jorma&#x27;s younger brother. Covington was either dismissed from the band or left of his own volition shortly after the sessions commenced.

With Hot Tuna drummer Sammy Piazza deputizing on one track, Covington (who had already recorded two drum parts) was soon replaced by former Turtles and CSNY drummer John Barbata, who ultimately played on most of the album. Barbata was recommended to the group by David Crosby. &quot;Long John Silver&quot; is notable for its cover, which folded out into a humidor, which the inner photo depicted as storing cigars (which may have been filled with marijuana). Despite middling reviews, the album rose to No. 20 in the United States, a significantly higher placement than &quot;Burgers&quot; (No. 68) or &quot;Sunfighter&quot; (No. 89).

The band began a proper national tour to promote &quot;Long John Silver&quot; in 1972, their first in nearly two years. Shortly before the tour commenced, David Freiberg (who had recently completed a prison sentence for marijuana possession after leaving Quicksilver Messenger Service) joined as a belated replacement for Balin. The East Coast leg of the tour included a major free concert in Central Park that drew over 50,000 attendees. They returned to the West Coast in September, playing concerts in San Diego, Hollywood, Phoenix and Albuquerque. The tour culminated in two shows at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco (September 21–22), both of which were recorded. At the end of the second show, the group was joined on stage by Balin, who sang lead vocals on &quot;Volunteers&quot; and the final song, &quot;You Wear Your Dresses Too Short&quot;.

The Winterland shows were the last live performances by Jefferson Airplane[22] until their reunion in 1989. A new live album, &quot;Thirty Seconds Over Winterland&quot;, was culled from the tour and released in April 1973. Later that year, Kaukonen and Casady decided to focus on Hot Tuna as a full-time endeavor, effectively leaving the band; however, no official announcement was ever released. By December 1973, RCA had terminated the band&#x27;s salaries, resulting in Freiberg being forced to draw unemployment to maintain his house payments.

Following the commercially unsuccessful &quot;Baron von Tollbooth &amp; the Chrome Nun&quot; (1973; credited to Kantner, Slick and Freiberg) and &quot;Manhole&quot; (1974; credited to Slick), Jefferson Airplane evolved into Jefferson Starship in January 1974. The initial lineup consisted of the remaining members of Jefferson Airplane (Kantner, Slick, Freiberg, Barbata, Creach); bassist Peter Kaukonen (soon replaced by British multi-instrumentalist Pete Sears, a veteran of Creach&#x27;s debut solo album and &quot;Manhole&quot;); and lead guitarist Craig Chaquico, a member of Grunt Records band Jack Traylor and Steelwind who contributed to the Kantner/Slick solo albums beginning with &quot;Sunfighter&quot;. They appropriated the name from Kantner&#x27;s &quot;Blows Against the Empire&quot;, with Bill Thompson convincing the group that maintaining the connection was prudent from a business standpoint. Reflecting the transition, the album &quot;Dragon Fly&quot;, released in September 1974, was credited to Slick, Kantner and Jefferson Starship.

===Side projects and spin-off bands===
===Reunions and other performances, 1989–present===
After the acrimonious events that resulted in Jefferson Starship&#x27;s 1984 evolution into Starship, Kantner reunited with Balin (who joined Jefferson Starship in January 1975 following a guest appearance on &quot;Dragon Fly&quot; before leaving once more in 1978) and Casady in 1985 to form the KBC Band. They released their only album, &quot;KBC Band&quot;, in 1986 on Arista Records. On March 4, 1988, Slick made a cameo appearance during a Hot Tuna San Francisco performance at the Fillmore (with Kantner and Creach joining in), facilitating a potential reunion of Jefferson Airplane.

In 1989, the classic 1966–70 lineup of Jefferson Airplane reunited (with the exception of Dryden) for a tour and album. The self-titled album was released by Epic to modest sales but the accompanying tour was considered a success.

In 1996, the 1966–70 lineup of Jefferson Airplane was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, with Balin, Casady, Dryden, Kantner and Kaukonen attending and performing. Slick was absent.

1998 saw the production and broadcast of a very popular episode of the hit VH1 documentary television series &quot;Behind the Music&quot; about Jefferson Airplane, directed by Bob Sarles. Band members Slick, Balin, Kantner, Kaukonen, Casady and Dryden were all interviewed for the episode, along with David Crosby, longtime Airplane manager Bill Thompson and China Kantner, daughter of Paul Kantner and Grace Slick.

In 2004, the film &quot;Fly Jefferson Airplane&quot; (directed by Bob Sarles) was released on DVD. It covers the years 1965–72 and includes then-recent interviews with band members and 13 complete songs.

Kaukonen and Casady performed a set at the 2015 Lockn&#x27; Festival to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Jefferson Airplane. They were joined by G.E. Smith, Rachael Price, Larry Campbell and Teresa Williams. In 2016, Jefferson Airplane was given the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2022, Jefferson Airplane received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Spencer Dryden died of colon cancer on January 11, 2005. Signe Anderson and Paul Kantner both died on January 28, 2016. Marty Balin died on September 27, 2018.

<text>Zhang Ziyi (; ; born 9 February 1979), sometimes credited Ziyi Zhang, is a Chinese actress, model, and former dancer. Known for playing independent and strong-willed characters, she is the recipient of various accolades. Born and raised in Beijing, Zhang was admitted to the Central Academy of Drama in 1996. That year, she made her acting debut in the television film &quot;Touching Starlight&quot; (1996). After her breakout role in Zhang Yimou&#x27;s &quot;The Road Home&quot; (1999), which won her the Best Actress Award at the 2000 Hundred Flowers Awards, she gained international recognition for her performance in the wuxia martial arts film &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; (2000).

Zhang made her Hollywood debut as a villain in the 2001 action comedy film &quot;Rush Hour 2&quot; with Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker. That year she also starred as a princess in the South Korean historical drama film &quot;Musa&quot;. She reunited with Yimou in the critically acclaimed films &quot;Hero&quot; (2002) and &quot;House of Flying Daggers&quot; (2004). For her work in the romantic drama film &quot;2046&quot; (2004), she won best actress at the 2005 Hong Kong Film Awards. Her most critically acclaimed works are the period drama film &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; (2005), which earned her nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture Drama, the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role, and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role; and the martial arts film &quot;The Grandmaster&quot; (2013), for which she won 12 different Best Actress awards to become the most awarded Chinese actress for a single film.

Zhang is regarded as one of the Four Dan actresses of China. From 2004 to 2010, she ranked in the Top 5 of &quot;Forbes&quot; China Celebrity 100 list every year. In 2008, she was awarded with the Outstanding Contribution to Chinese Cinema award at the 11th Shanghai International Film Festival. She has modeled for multiple high-end fashion brands. One of the most recognisable Asian actresses in the Western world, &quot;Time&quot; called her &quot;China&#x27;s gift to Hollywood&quot; in 2005. The same year, &quot;Time&quot; named her one of the 100 Most Influential People. In 2013, she received the French Cultural Order at the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres.

==Early life==
Zhang Ziyi was born in Beijing to Zhang Yuanxiao, an accountant and later economist, and Li Zhousheng, a kindergarten teacher. She has an older brother, Zhang Zinan, who was her manager. Zhang began her nine-year study of folk dance when she was 8; at 11, she joined the Affiliated Secondary School of Beijing Dance Academy at her parents&#x27; suggestion. While at this boarding school, she noticed how mean the other girls were to each other while competing for status amongst the teachers. Zhang disliked the attitudes of her peers and teachers so much that, on one occasion, she ran away from the school. In 1994, she won the performance award in the National Taoli Cup Dance Competition. She also appeared in a handful of TV commercials. In 1996, Zhang entered the Central Academy of Drama, majoring in acting.

==Career==

===1996–2000: Early career===
In her freshman year, Zhang made her acting debut in the television film &quot;Touching Starlight&quot;. In 1998, Zhang was offered her first major role by director Zhang Yimou in his film &quot;The Road Home&quot;, which would win the Silver Bear prize at the 2000 Berlin International Film Festival. Zhang plays a country girl in love with the town&#x27;s young teacher. She won the Best Actress Award at the 2000 Hundred Flowers Awards for her performance.

===2000–06: Wuxia epics and international breakthrough===
Zhang rose to international fame in 2000 with her role as Yu Jiaolong in Ang Lee&#x27;s re-visioned wuxia martial arts film &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot;. Zhang plays a young Manchu noblewoman who has secretly learned martial arts and runs off to become a wandering swordswoman rather than commit to an arranged marriage. This role won her the Most Promising Actress award at the Chicago Film Critics Association Awards and Best Supporting Actress awards from the Independent Spirit Awards, as well as Toronto Film Critics Association Awards. The movie&#x27;s success in the US and Europe helped her break into Hollywood.

Zhang then appeared in her first American film, &quot;Rush Hour 2&quot; (2001) opposite Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker. On playing her first villain role, Zhang expressed that &quot;the opportunity to sort of try and analyze the psyche of the character and get to know and pull out emotions I’ve never had to utilize before...was very exciting.&quot;

In 2002, Zhang co-starred in &quot;Hero&quot; alongside Jet Li, Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung, directed by her early mentor Zhang Yimou. The film was a huge success in the English-speaking world and was nominated for an Oscar and a Golden Globe award in the category of Best Foreign Language Film. She then signed on to film an avant-garde drama film &quot;Purple Butterfly&quot; (2003), which competed in the 2003 Cannes Film Festival.

Zhang went back to the wuxia martial arts genre in &quot;House of Flying Daggers&quot; (2004), again by Zhang Yimou, where she starred along Takeshi Kaneshiro and Andy Lau. She plays the blind dancing girl Mei, who despite the lack of eyesight, is a skilled fighter. In preparation for the part, Zhang spent two months living with an actual blind girl. Her performance earned her a Best Actress nomination at the BAFTA Awards. She also featured on the &quot;House of Flying Daggers&quot; soundtrack with her own musical rendition of the ancient Chinese poem &quot;Jia Rén Qu&quot; (佳人曲, &quot;The Beauty Song&quot;).

Zhang next starred in Wong Kar-wai&#x27;s romantic drama film &quot;2046&quot; (2004), which featured many top Chinese actors and actresses. Critics praise Zhang for her &quot;expressive&quot; body language that was combined with her &quot;reserved and complex emotions&quot; in performance as a struggling prostitute. Zhang won Best Actress awards at the Hong Kong Film Critics&#x27; Award and Hong Kong Film Academy Award.

In 2005, Zhang featured in the critically acclaimed film &quot;Jasmine Women&quot;, adapted from Su Tong&#x27;s novel titled &quot;Women&#x27;s Lives&quot;. She won Best Actress at the Golden Rooster Awards for her performance. Next came &quot;Princess Raccoon&quot; (2005), directed by Japan&#x27;s Seijun Suzuki, which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. For her role, Zhang took two weeks of singing and dancing lessons in Japan.

Zhang played the lead role of Sayuri in the American film adaptation based on the international bestseller&quot; Memoirs of a Geisha&quot;. Controversy arose in China about having a Chinese woman portray a prominent Japanese geisha in a film set during the height of Japanese imperialist aggression against China in World War II. Nonetheless, the film was a box office hit in the West. For the role, Zhang was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Drama, the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role, and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role.

On 27 June 2005, Zhang accepted an invitation to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), placing her among the ranks of those who are able to vote on the Academy Awards. In May 2006, Zhang was chosen as a jury member of &quot;Feature Films&quot; at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival.

Zhang returned to China in 2006 for the Chinese wuxia film &quot;The Banquet&quot;, directed by Feng Xiaogang. The film is a loose adaptation of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;.

===2007–12: Hollywood and China===
In 2007, Zhang performed the voice of Karai in the American animated film &quot;TMNT&quot; (2007). In the same year, Zhang starred alongside Liu Ye and Ge You in the first-ever opening short for the Chinese academy awards (Golden Rooster Awards) where director Dayyan Eng got top stars to spoof the action-movie genre in a humorous send-up on national TV in China.

In &quot;Forever Enthralled&quot; (2008), which tells the story of legendary Peking opera actor Mei Lanfang, Zhang appears in the second act as 
Mei&#x27;s lover Meng Xiaodong. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; praised her performance as &quot;confident and passion&quot;, giving the romance a sparkle.

Her next American film was &quot;The Horsemen&quot; (2009), where she starred opposite Dennis Quaid. Back in China, she played the titular character in romantic comedy &quot;Sophie&#x27;s Revenge&quot; (2009); a comic book artist seeking to punish her unfaithful boyfriend. She then starred alongside Aaron Kwok in the AIDS-themed film &quot;Love for Life&quot; (2011).

In 2012, Zhang starred next to Cecilia Cheung and Jang Dong-gun in the Chinese-Korean co-production &quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot;, an adaptation of the French novel &quot;Les Liaisons dangereuses&quot;, narrating Shanghai of the 1930s. Zhang was reportedly paid 20 million RMB (approximately $3.5 million) for the role. The same year, she was cast in the coming-of-age film &quot;Forever Young&quot; directed and written by Li Fangfang. The film premiered in January 2018.

===2013–17: Return to stardom===
In 2013, Zhang received the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres for her significant contributions to the film industry.

Zhang reunited with Wong Kar-wai and Tony Leung for &quot;The Grandmaster&quot; (2013), which also marks her return to the martial arts genre after 7 years since &quot;The Banquet&quot; (2006). The film was China&#x27;s submission to the Academy Awards for Best Foreign-Language Picture. Critics praise Zhang&#x27;s portrayal of Gong&#x27;Er as the &quot;best performance she&#x27;s ever delivered in the history of her career.&quot; which led to her winning several &quot;Best Actress&quot; trophies across Asia. The same year, she reprised her role as Sophie in &quot;My Lucky Star&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Sophie&#x27;s Revenge&quot;. Described as Zhang&#x27;s &quot;breakthrough comedy role&quot;, the film topped Chinese box office on the week of its release.

In 2014, Zhang starred in John Woo&#x27;s romantic epic &quot;The Crossing&quot;, based on the true story of the Taiping steamer collision and follows six characters and their intertwining love stories in Taiwan and Shanghai during the 1930s. Zhang plays a poor illiterate woman waiting for her soldier lover in 1930&#x27;s Shanghai.

In 2015, Zhang produced her third film &quot;Oh My God&quot;, which stars Zhang Yixing and Li Xiaolu. She made a cameo appearance in the film. Zhang next starred in romance anthology film &quot;Run for Love&quot; and crime epic &quot;The Wasted Times&quot;.

===2018–present: Hollywood epics, directorial debut and small-screen debut===

<doc id="72814" wikidata="Q1822183" url="?curid=72814" title="Newgate Prison">
<text>Newgate Prison was a prison at the corner of Newgate Street and Old Bailey, just inside the City of London, England, originally at the site of Newgate, a gate in the Roman London Wall. Built in the 12th century and demolished in 1904, the prison was extended and rebuilt many times, and remained in use for over 700 years, from 1188 to 1902.

In the late 18th century, executions by hanging were moved here from the Tyburn gallows. These took place on the public street in front of the prison, drawing crowds until 1868, when they were moved into the prison.

For much of its history, a succession of criminal courtrooms were attached to the prison, commonly referred to as the &quot;Old Bailey&quot;. The present Old Bailey (officially, Central Criminal Court) now occupies much of the site of the prison.

==History==

In the 12th century, Henry II instituted legal reforms that gave the Crown more control over the administration of justice. As part of his Assize of Clarendon of 1166, he required the construction of prisons, where the accused would stay while royal judges debated their innocence or guilt and subsequent punishment. In 1188, Newgate was the first institution established to meet that purpose. Also around this time, the Sheriffs of London were given jurisdiction in Middlesex, as well as in the City of London.

A few decades later in 1236, in an effort to significantly enlarge the prison, the king converted one of the Newgate turrets, which still functioned as a main gate into the city, into an extension of the prison. The addition included new dungeons and adjacent buildings, which would remain unaltered for roughly two centuries.

By the 15th century, however, Newgate was in need of repair. Following pressure from reformers who learned that the women&#x27;s quarters were too small and did not contain their own latrines – obliging women to walk through the men&#x27;s quarters to reach one – officials added a separate tower and chamber for female prisoners in 1406. Some Londoners bequeathed their estates to repair the prison. The building was collapsing and decaying, and many prisoners were dying from the close quarters, overcrowding, rampant disease, and bad sanitary conditions. Indeed, one year, 22 prisoners died from &quot;gaol fever&quot;. The situation in Newgate was so dire that in 1419, city officials temporarily shut down the prison.

The executors of the will of Lord Mayor Dick Whittington were granted a licence to renovate the prison in 1422. The gate and gaol were pulled down and rebuilt. There was a new central hall for meals, a new chapel, and the creation of additional chambers and basement cells with no light or ventilation. There were three main wards: the Master&#x27;s side for those could afford to pay for their own food and accommodations, the Common side for those who were too poor, and a Press Yard for special prisoners. The king often used Newgate as a holding place for heretics, traitors, and rebellious subjects brought to London for trial. The prison housed both male and female felons and debtors. Prisoners were separated into wards by sex. By the mid-15th century, Newgate could accommodate roughly 300 prisoners. Though the prisoners lived in separate quarters, they mixed freely with each other and visitors to the prison.

The prison was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666, and was rebuilt in 1672 by Sir Christopher Wren. In 1752, a windmill was built on top of the prison by Stephen Hales in an effort to provide ventilation.
In 1769, construction was begun by the King&#x27;s Master Mason, John Deval, to enlarge the prison and add a new &#x27;Old Bailey&#x27; sessions house. Parliament granted £50,000 (~£9.3 million in 2020 terms) towards the cost, and the City of London provided land measuring by . The work followed the designs of George Dance the Younger. The new prison was constructed to an &quot;architecture terrible&quot; design intended to discourage law-breaking. The building was laid out around a central courtyard, and was divided into two sections: a &quot;Common&quot; area for poor prisoners and a &quot;State area&quot; for those able to afford more comfortable accommodation.

Construction of the second Newgate Prison was almost finished when it was stormed by a mob during the Gordon riots in June 1780. The building was gutted by fire, and the walls were badly damaged; the cost of repairs was estimated at £30,000 (~£5.6 million in 2020 terms). Dance&#x27;s new prison was finally completed in 1782.

During the early 19th century, the prison attracted the attention of the social reformer Elizabeth Fry. She was particularly concerned at the conditions in which female prisoners (and their children) were held. After she presented evidence to the House of Commons improvements were made.

The prison closed in 1902, and was demolished in 1903.

== Prison life ==

All manner of criminals stayed at Newgate. Some committed acts of petty crime and theft, breaking and entering homes or committing highway robberies, while others performed serious crimes such as rapes and murders. The number of prisoners in Newgate for specific types of crime often grew and fell, reflecting public anxieties of the time. For example, towards the tail end of Edward I&#x27;s reign, there was a rise in street robberies. As such, the punishment for drawing out a dagger was 15 days in Newgate; injuring someone meant 40 days in the prison.

Upon their arrival in Newgate, prisoners were chained and led to the appropriate dungeon for their crime. Those who had been sentenced to death stayed in a cellar beneath the keeper&#x27;s house, essentially an open sewer lined with chains and shackles to encourage submission. Otherwise, common debtors were sent to the &quot;stone hall&quot; whereas common felons were taken to the &quot;stone hold&quot;. The dungeons were dirty and unlit, so depraved that physicians would not enter.

The conditions did not improve with time. Prisoners who could afford to purchase alcohol from the prisoner-run drinking cellar by the main entrance to Newgate remained perpetually drunk. There were lice everywhere, and jailers left the prisoners chained to the wall to languish and starve. From 1315 to 1316, 62 deaths in Newgate were under investigation by the coroner, and prisoners were always desperate to leave the prison.

The cruel treatment from guards did nothing to help the unfortunate prisoners. According to medieval statute, the prison was to be managed by two annually elected sheriffs, who in turn would sublet the administration of the prison to private &quot;gaolers&quot;, or &quot;keepers&quot;, for a price. These keepers in turn were permitted to exact payment directly from the inmates, making the position one of the most profitable in London. Inevitably, often the system offered incentives for the keepers to exhibit cruelty to the prisoners, charging them for everything from entering the gaol to having their chains both put on and taken off. They often began inflicting punishment on prisoners before their sentences even began. Guards, whose incomes partially depended on extorting their wards, charged the prisoners for food, bedding, and to be released from their shackles. To earn additional money, guards blackmailed and tortured prisoners. Among the most notorious Keepers in the Middle Ages were the 14th-century gaolers Edmund Lorimer, who was infamous for charging inmates four times the legal limit for the removal of irons, and Hugh De Croydon, who was eventually convicted of blackmailing prisoners in his care.

Indeed, the list of things that prison guards were not allowed to do serve as a better indication of the conditions in Newgate than the list of things that they were allowed to do. Gaolers were not allowed to take alms intended for prisoners. They could not monopolize the sale of food, charge excessive fees for beds, or demand fees for bringing prisoners to the Old Bailey. In 1393, new regulation was added to prevent gaolers from charging for lamps or beds.
Not a half century later, in 1431, city administrators met to discuss other potential areas of reform. Proposed regulations included separating freemen and freewomen into the north and south chambers, respectively, and keeping the rest of the prisoners in underground holding cells. Good prisoners who had not been accused of serious crimes would be allowed to use the chapel and recreation rooms at no additional fees. Meanwhile, debtors whose burden did not meet a minimum threshold would not be required to wear shackles. Prison officials were barred from selling food, charcoal, and candles. The prison was supposed to have yearly inspections, but whether they actually occurred is unknown. Other reforms attempted to reduce the waiting time between jail deliveries to the Old Bailey, with the aim of reducing suffering, but these efforts had little effect.

Over the centuries, Newgate was used for a number of purposes including imprisoning people awaiting execution, although it was not always secure: burglar Jack Sheppard twice escaped from the prison before he went to the gallows at Tyburn in 1724. Prison chaplain Paul Lorrain achieved some fame in the early 18th century for his sometimes dubious publication of &quot;Confessions&quot; of the condemned.

==Executions==

In 1783, the site of London&#x27;s gallows was moved from Tyburn to Newgate. Public executions outside the prison – by this time, London&#x27;s main prison – continued to draw large crowds. It was also possible to visit the prison by obtaining a permit from the Lord Mayor of the City of London or a sheriff. The condemned were kept in narrow, sombre cells separated from Newgate Street by a thick wall and received only a dim light from the inner courtyard. The gallows were constructed outside a door in Newgate Street for public viewing. Dense crowds of thousands of spectators could pack the streets to see these events, and in 1807 dozens died at a public execution when part of the crowd of 40,000 spectators collapsed into a crowd crush. In November 1835 James Pratt and John Smith were the last two men to be executed for sodomy. 

Michael Barrett was the last man to be hanged in public outside Newgate Prison (and the last person to be publicly executed in Great Britain) on 26 May 1868. From 1868, public executions were discontinued and executions were carried out on gallows inside Newgate, initially using the same mobile gallows in the Chapel Yard, but later in a shed built near the same spot. Dead Man&#x27;s Walk was a long stone-flagged passageway, partly open to the sky and roofed with iron mesh (thus also known as Birdcage Walk). The bodies of the executed criminals were then buried beneath its flagstones. Until the 20th century, future British executioners were trained at Newgate. One of the last was John Ellis, who began training in 1901. In total – publicly or otherwise – 1,169 people were executed at the prison. Death masks of several of them were transferred to the Black Museum at New Scotland Yard on the prison&#x27;s closure.

==Legacy==
The Central Criminal Court – known as the Old Bailey after the street on which it stands – now stands upon the Newgate Prison site.

The original iron gate leading to the gallows was used for decades in an alleyway in Buffalo, New York. It is currently housed in that city at Canisius University.

The original door from a prison cell used to house St. Oliver Plunkett in 1681 is on display at St Peter&#x27;s Church in Drogheda, Ireland (which also displays his head).

The phrase &quot;[as] black as Newgate&#x27;s knocker&quot; is a Cockney reference to the door knocker on the front of the prison.

===In literature===
A record of executions conducted at the prison, together with commentary, was published as &quot;The Newgate Calendar&quot;.

The prison appears in a number of works by Charles Dickens. Novels include &quot;Little Dorrit&quot;, &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;, &quot;Barnaby Rudge: A Tale of the Riots of &#x27;Eighty&quot; and &quot;Great Expectations&quot;. Newgate prison was also the subject of an entire essay in his work &quot;Sketches by Boz&quot;.

===In song===
The Australian &quot;Convict&#x27;s Rum Song&quot; mentions Newgate with a line reading: &quot;[I&#x27;d] ... even dance the Newgate Hornpipe If ye&#x27;ll only gimme Rum!&quot;. The &#x27;Newgate Hornpipe&#x27; refers to execution by hanging.

<doc id="72816" wikidata="Q3539177" url="?curid=72816" title="Trillium erectum">
<text>Trillium erectum, the red trillium, also known as wake robin, purple trillium, bethroot, or stinking benjamin, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melanthiaceae. The plant takes its common name &quot;wake robin&quot; by analogy with the European robin, which has a red breast heralding spring. Likewise &quot;Trillium erectum&quot; is a spring ephemeral plant whose life-cycle is synchronized with that of the forests in which it lives. It is native to the eastern United States and eastern Canada from northern Georgia to Quebec and New Brunswick.

==Description==
&quot;Trillium erectum&quot; is a perennial, herbaceous, flowering plant that persists by means of an underground rhizome. Like all trilliums, it has a whorl of three bracts (leaves) and a single trimerous flower with three sepals, three petals, two whorls of three stamens each, and three carpels (fused into a single ovary with three stigmas). It grows to about in height with a spread of . The petals are dark reddish brown, maroon, purple, pale yellow, or white. The ovary is dark purple to maroon regardless of petal color. If the flower is successfully pollinated, the petals wither, leaving behind a fruit that ripens to a dark red berry-like capsule, 1 to 1.5 centimeters long.

===Species Complex===
&quot;Trillium erectum&quot; shares many anatomical details with other North American Trillium species. These species hybridize in the wild, which has led some researchers to group them into a species complex, specifically, a syngameon of semispecies.

The combinations of traits that are supposed to differentiate members of the complex from one another are sometimes inconsistently combined in wild populations. This has led some researchers to declare the individual species invalid, and refer to the species complex collectively as &quot;T. erectum&quot; (&quot;sensu lato&quot;). Others acknowledge the existence of introgression and hybrid swarm formation between some or all complex members, but maintain that the named species within the complex represent convenient groups with common features.

Members of the &quot;T. erectum&quot; complex have flowers with the following commonalities: (1) petals that are coarse and stiff in texture (in contrast with the wavy edges of other species), (2) petals that do not change color after pollination, (3) petals with prominent, netted veins, (4) fleshy stigmas that are attached to the ovary separately, without a common style, and (5) conspicuous, deeply-ridged ovaries.

North American members of the &quot;T. erectum&quot; species complex:
* &quot;T. cernuum&quot;
* &quot;T. erectum&quot;
* &quot;T. flexipes&quot;
* &quot;T. rugelii&quot;
* &quot;T. simile&quot;
* &quot;T. sulcatum&quot;
* &quot;T. vaseyi&quot;

The Asian species &quot;T. camschatcense&quot;, resembles the North American &quot;T. flexipes&quot; very closely, and itself has close relatives with similar floral features. However, trillium speciation in this group of Asian species is characterized by differences in chromosome number, with hybrids more definitively distinguishable from parent species by karyotype.
* &quot;T. apetalon&quot;
* &quot;T. camschatcense&quot;
* &quot;T. channellii&quot;
* &quot;T.&quot; × &quot;hagae&quot;
* &quot;T. smallii&quot;
* &quot;T. tschonoskii&quot;

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Trillium erectum&quot; was first described by the Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus in 1753. The specific epithet &quot;erectum&quot; means &quot;upright, erect&quot;, a reference to the erect pedicel of some forms of this species. In many populations, however, the pedicel leans or declines, sometimes declining beneath the leaves, making the name somewhat inappropriate.

In 1803 André Michaux introduced the name &quot;Trillium rhomboideum&quot; to describe a form of &quot;T. erectum&quot; with black fruit in &quot;the high mountains of North Carolina&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;rhomboideum&quot; refers to the broadly rhombic leaves of this (and all) forms of &quot;T. erectum&quot;. Michaux also described &quot;Trillium rhomboideum&quot; var. &quot;atropurpureum&quot;, a variety with large, dark purple petals. A decade later in 1813, Frederick Traugott Pursh referred to Michaux&#x27;s variety more simply as &quot;Trillium erectum&quot; var. &quot;atropurpureum&quot;. Perhaps unaware of these taxonomic developments, other botanists subsequently described &quot;Trillium atropurpureum&quot;. The epithet &quot;atropurpureum&quot; means &quot;dark-purple coloured&quot;, a reference to the petal color of certain forms of &quot;T. erectum&quot;. Indeed, in some locales &quot;T. erectum&quot; is commonly known as the purple trillium.

===Infraspecies===
, Plants of the World Online (POWO) accepts two infraspecific names:

* &quot;Trillium erectum&quot; var. &quot;album&quot; 
* &quot;Trillium erectum&quot; var. &quot;erectum&quot;

POWO lists 30 synonyms for variety &quot;erectum&quot; and 3 synonyms for variety &quot;album&quot;. Michaux introduced the term &quot;album&quot; in 1803 by describing &quot;Trillium rhomboideum&quot; var. &quot;album&quot;, a variety with a smaller flower and white petals. Pursh gave a similar description for &quot;Trillium erectum&quot; var. &quot;album&quot; in 1814. The word &quot;album&quot; means &quot;bright, dead-white&quot;, a reference to the variety&#x27;s white petals, a distinctive feature noted by both Michaux and Pursh. 

John Kunkel Small raised &quot;T. rhomboideum&quot; var. &quot;album&quot; to species rank in 1903. In his description, he added long anthers to the list of characters cited by Michaux while expanding the range of the taxon to include North Carolina, Tennessee, and Georgia. In 1917, R.R. Gates recognized the existence of two distinct forms of &quot;T. erectum&quot; with white petals, one of which was represented by the previously mentioned &quot;Trillium album&quot; . This prompted Ralph Hoffmann to propose &quot;Trillium erectum&quot; f. &quot;albiflorum&quot;, a white-flowered form of &quot;T. erectum&quot; that occurs occasionally and spontaneously throughout the range of the species. Thus the distinct taxa recognized by Gates were fully realized by 1922.

POWO cites the Flora of North America (FNA) as an authority for &quot;Trillium erectum&quot; var. &quot;album&quot; . The treatment of the variety in FNA expands the original concept described by Michaux to include the occasional white-flowered red trillium found throughout the range of the species. Under this scheme, all non-white petal colors (including yellow) comprise the typical variety (var. &quot;erectum&quot;). Thus FNA lumps the two forms recognized by Gates into a single taxon. In contrast, POWO restricts the range of &quot;Trillium erectum&quot; var. &quot;album&quot; to eastern Tennessee and western North Carolina. Noting that its distribution is poorly understood, Flora of the Southeastern United States (FSUS) describes a white-flowered variety of &quot;T. erectum&quot; common to the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains, in North Carolina and Tennessee, but rare elsewhere. FSUS suggests that variety &quot;album&quot; may be genetically distinct from variety &quot;erectum&quot;, while other evidence suggests there is little genetic difference between the two varieties.

==Distribution==
&quot;Trillium erectum&quot; is native to eastern North America. Its range extends from northern Georgia in the southeastern United States to Quebec and New Brunswick in eastern Canada, and as far west as Michigan and southern Ontario. The species is known to occur in the following provinces and states:

* Canada: New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Quebec
* United States: Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia

&quot;Trillium erectum&quot; var. &quot;album&quot; (as described in the Flora of the Southeastern United States) occurs in western North Carolina, eastern Tennessee, and other areas surrounding the Great Smoky Mountains, primarily at elevations less than .

, &quot;Trillium erectum&quot; is globally secure. It is critically imperiled in Delaware, Illinois, and Rhode Island.

==Ecology==
&quot;Trillium erectum&quot; is a carrion-scented flower. It produces fetid or putrid odors purported to attract carrion fly and beetle pollinators. The fetid odor is described as that of a wet dog. The common name stinking benjamin refers to this characteristic of the plant. &quot;Benjamin&quot; is a corruption of the word benzoin, which itself is a corruption of the word &quot;benjoin&quot;, a plant-based organic compound used in the manufacture of perfume. Despite the origins of the common name, the chemical basis of carrion-scented flowers is not well understood.

&quot;Trillium erectum&quot; can tolerate extreme cold in winter, surviving temperatures down to .

==Uses==
The root of the red trillium was used by various indigenous peoples of North America as an aid in childbirth, hence the common name birthwort or birthroot (which is sometimes corrupted to bethroot). Root tea was used for menstrual disorders, to induce childbirth, and to aid in labor. The Cherokee peoples used a poultice of the whole plant to treat tumors, inflammation, and ulcers.

The leaves contain calcium oxalate crystals and crystal raphide, and should not be consumed by humans.

&quot;Trillium erectum&quot; is cultivated as a flowering ornamental plant. Although not as showy as &quot;T. grandiflorum&quot;, the flowers of some forms of &quot;T. erectum&quot; can be quite striking, especially since it tends to form large clumps. It has received the Award of Garden Merit from the Royal Horticultural Society.

<text>Bundaberg () is a city in the Bundaberg Region, Wide Bay, Queensland, Australia, and is the tenth largest city in the state. It is a major centre of the Wide Bay–Burnett geographical region. The Bundaberg central business district is situated along the southern bank of the Burnett River, about from its mouth at Burnett Heads, and flows into the Coral Sea. The city is sited on a rich coastal plain, supporting one of the nation&#x27;s most productive agricultural regions. The area of Bundaberg is the home of the Taribelang-Bunda, Goreng Goreng, Gurang, and Bailai peoples. Popular nicknames for Bundaberg include &quot;Bundy&quot;, &quot;Rum City&quot;, and &quot;The &#x27;Berg&quot;. In the , Bundaberg&#x27;s urban area has a population of 73,747 people.

The district surveyor, John Thompson Charlton designed the city layout in 1868, which planned for uniform square blocks with wide main streets, and named it ‘Bundaberg’. An early influence on the development of Bundaberg came with the 1868 Land Act, which was a famous Queensland via media, that aimed to create a class of Australian yeoman. Large sugarcane plantations were established throughout the 1880s, with industries of sugar mills, refineries, and rum distilleries that delivered prosperity to Bundaberg. These plantations used South Sea Islanders as indentured labourers, many of whom were blackbirded, a practice considered of form of slavery. The trade was outlawed in 1904, with most South Sea Islanders deported by 1906. Major floods in 1942 and 1954 damaged the river, ending Bundaberg&#x27;s role as a river port and led to a new port at the mouth of the Burnett river. In the post-war era, Bundaberg continued to grow with its wealth tied to its sugar industry. In 2013, Bundaberg experienced record flooding from Cyclone Oswald, which was the worst disaster in the city&#x27;s history.

The economy of Bundaberg is based primarily on agriculture, forestry, fishing and tourism, with a gross regional product at about $5.62 billion as of June 2023. Bundaberg also has a major distillery and brewery industry that exports to international markets. The city is served by the Port of Bundaberg and the Bundaberg Airport.

Bundaberg has a rich history and culture, along with its humid subtropical climate it is known for its weeping fig trees, dry stone walls, and historic plantations, including the Fairymead Plantation and the Sunnyside Sugar Plantation, the latter of which is the site of a mass grave. Other sites of South Sea Islander cultural significance include Sir Anthony&#x27;s Rest atop the Bundaberg Hummock and the South Sea Islander Church. Major cultural institutions include the Hinkler Hall of Aviation and the Bundaberg Regional Art Gallery. The city&#x27;s culinary culture is highlighted by its annual &#x27;Banquet on the Bridge&#x27;, and an iconic rum and gin culture with Bundaberg Rum originating in the city.

Bundaberg is a popular tourism destination, the city&#x27;s hinterland includes the historic towns of Childers and Gin Gin, Lake Monduran, Cania Gorge National Park and the Promisedland mountain bike trails. Bundaberg&#x27;s coastal areas include Bargara and Mon Repos, Deepwater National Park, and the southernmost reaches of the Great Barrier Reef alongside the islands of Lady Musgrave and Lady Elliot.

==Geography==
The city is about north of the state capital, Brisbane. It is inland from the Coral Sea coast and situated on the Burnett River.

== Etymology ==

===City name===
The name was coined by surveyor John Charlton Thompson and his assistant Alfred Dale Edwards. &quot;Bunda&quot; was derived from the name of one of the kinship groups of the local Taribelang people, and appended with the suffix &quot;berg&quot;. Two sources of the suffix have been proposed. It is a Saxon suffix which means &quot;hill&quot;. It is also a German word which translates as &quot;mountain&quot;, and refers to the Sloping Hummoch, the singular hill rising above the relatively flat region surrounding the Burnett River on which the city is situated.

Colloquially, the city is widely known throughout Australia as &quot;Bundy&quot;. Residents are referred to by the demonym Bundaberger, and the corresponding adjective is Bundabergian.

===Bourbong Street===
Bourbong Street is the main street of the city. and there is some controversy in regards to its spelling and meaning. Bourbong was alternatively spelled Bourbon or Boorbong, which was a local Aboriginal title given to a large waterhole in the area. The main street was historically also gazetted in the Bundaberg Mail as &quot;Bourbon&quot; street, but by 1941 there is no reference to &quot;Bourbon&quot; street. Robert Strathdee&#x27;s farming selection in the vicinity of the watering holes was recorded on early survey maps as &#x27;Boorbung&#x27;.

A pioneer pastoralist of the region, Nicholas Tooth, wrote that &quot;Bourbong&quot; was derived from the local Aboriginal phrase &quot;bier rabong&quot;, meaning &quot;plenty dead&quot;. Tooth, who took up land in the area in the early 1860s, found that Aboriginal people resolutely avoided the &quot;bier rabong&quot; vicinity. He later found the skeletal remains there of around twenty Aboriginal people who were apparently massacred in a raid by the Native Police.

==History==
===Early history===
The Traditional owner Aboriginal groups in the region are the Taribelang, Gooreng Gooreng, Gurang, and Bailai peoples. They are the original inhabitants of the region. A determination of Native Title was made for all four cultural groups by the National Native Title Tribunal, pursuant to the &quot;Native Title Act 1993,&quot; on 28 November 2017. It was determined that &quot;native title exists in the entire determination area&quot; of Bundaberg, Gladstone, and the North Burnett.

As such, the Bundaberg Regional Council has reflected this recognition in their &quot;First Nations Strategy 2022-2026&quot;, and endeavours to celebrate and embrace the region&#x27;s &quot;local connections to First Nation Peoples and other cultures&quot;.

=== Initial British colonisation ===
The first British man to visit the area was James Davis in the 1830s. He was an escaped convict from the Moreton Bay Penal settlement who lived with the Kabi people to the south of the region. He resided mostly around the Mary River and was referred to as &quot;Durrumboi&quot;. The Burnett River was surveyed by John Charles Burnett, after whom it was named during his exploration mission of the Wide Bay and Burnett regions in 1847.

British occupation of the land in the region began in 1848 when pastoral squatters Gregory Blaxland Jnr and William Forster established a sheep station. Blaxland was a son of the Blue Mountains explorer, Gregory Blaxland, and Forster was later to become a Premier of New South Wales. They selected a very large area of land which encompassed most of the western part of the modern day Bundaberg Region along the Burnett River. They named this pastoral lease Tirroan.

Blaxland and Forster had previously set up sheep stations near the Clarence River and had a notable history of conflict with Aboriginal people. Sheep stations imposed on native bushland disrupt native food production, typically resulting in widespread hunger and illness amongst native peoples. Conflict continued at Tirroan when two of their shepherds were killed by Aboriginal people in 1849. Forster and Blaxland led a punitive expedition causing multiple Aboriginal deaths. Further conflict occurred the following year when Blaxland was clubbed to death. Forster and a number of other squatters conducted another reprisal, resulting in a large massacre of Aboriginal people in scrubland toward the coastal part of Tirroan.

In the early 1850s, Forster sold the property to Alfred Henry Brown who changed the name of the pastoral lease to Gin Gin. At the same time, Native Police officer, Richard Purvis Marshall, took up the Bingera leasehold in the rainforest scrubland downstream from Tirroan. Three towns in the Bundaberg region, Tirroan, South Bingera and Gin Gin, commemorate these massive initial leaseholds.
=== Cattle and logging ===

Before colonisation, much of the land around the lower reaches of the Burnett River consisted of either the Woongarra Scrub, a subtropical rainforest that stood where most of the Bundaberg canefields now grow, or the Barolin Plains, a lightly timbered grassland that stretched along the coastal fringe. Neither of these areas were suitable for sheep farming but the British soon found that raising cattle was possible. In the early 1860s the first cattle stations in the area were established; Branyan on the south side of the Burnett River and Tantitha on the north side.
Timber companies, such as that owned by William Pettigrew, started the logging of the Woongarra Scrub in 1867.
In 1868, Samuel Johnston erected a sawmill in Waterview, on the north bank of the Burnett River. The Waterview sawmill became a prominent supplier of timber until its closure in 1903 after being damaged by flood.

=== Town of Bundaberg ===
In 1867, timber-getters and farmers, John and Gavin Steuart, established the Woondooma property which consisted of a few houses and a wharf on the northern banks of the Burnett River where Bundaberg North now stands. An official survey of the area was undertaken in 1869 by John Charlton Thompson, assisted by James Ellwood and Alfred Dale Edwards, and the town of Bundaberg was gazetted across the river on the higher, southern banks. The first Bundaberg land sale was held in Maryborough on 11 May 1870 where hotelier John Foley bought the original lots.

=== Sugar ===
Most of the early settlers exploited the timber and grew maize on their selections but as a result of the incentives of the Sugar and Coffee Regulations of 1864, sugar became a major component in Bundaberg&#x27;s development from the 1870s. Experimental sugar cane cultivation in the district was first grown at John Charlton Thompson&#x27;s Rubyanna property in 1870 and the first sugar mill was built by Richard Elliot Palmer at his Millbank plantation in 1872. Bundaberg rapidly became an important sugar production region after the construction of the Millaquin Sugar Refinery at East Bundaberg by Robert Cran and his sons in 1882. The Fairymead sugar processing plant owned by the Young Brothers (Arthur, Horace and Ernest Young) opened in 1884 which further augmented Bundaberg&#x27;s sugar producing capacity.

The initial 35 years of the sugar industry in Bundaberg was reliant on South Sea Islander workers, who were often blackbirded and kept in a status close to slavery. The first significant shipload of Kanaka labour, as it was called, to arrive on the Burnett River came in January 1872 aboard the &quot;Petrel&quot;. Allegations of kidnapping and wounding immediately arose concerning the recruitment of the Islanders on this vessel. Influential Bundaberg plantation owners were able to purchase recruiting ships in order to obtain labour directly from areas such as the Solomon Islands and the New Hebrides. The Young Brothers owned the &quot;Lochiel&quot; and the &quot;May&quot; vessels, the Cran family and Frederic Buss were the major investors in the &quot;Helena&quot; while the &quot;Ariel&quot; was co-owned by a number of local planters. While some of the recruitment was voluntary, violence and deception toward Islanders often took place. For example, the crew of the &quot;Helena&quot; fought a battle with the locals of Ambrym while taking Islanders from there.

These labourers had to work for three years and were only paid at the end of this time period. Instead of cash, they usually received substandard goods and trinkets of minimal value as payment. Excessive mortality of the Islanders while serving their term of labour in the Bundaberg region was frequent. Overwork, poor housing, inadequate food, contaminated water supplies and a lack of medical care all contributed to the high death rate. Penalties for the plantation owners whose neglect resulted in these fatalities were rare and did not exceed a £10 fine. Importing South Sea Islander labour was made illegal in 1904 and enforced repatriation of these workers out of Bundaberg and other locations in Queensland occurred from 1906 to 1908.
The 1911 Queensland sugar strike occurred after the phasing out of South Sea Islander labour, with workers claiming that many plantation owners had substituted black indentured labourers (sometimes referred to as slaves) with white ones. Workers sought better accommodation, wages and conditions, including an eight-hour day and a minimum weekly wage of 30 shillings, including food. The mobilisation of unionists from Bundaberg to Mossman was a major achievement, with the 1911 strike lasting over seven weeks in Bundaberg where the town&#x27;s economy was largely based on the sugar industry. The end result of the strike was a Commonwealth Royal Commission into the sugar industry in 1911–12, which had been initially requested by Harry Hall, a Bundaberg AWA organiser in 1908 with a petition signed by 1500 Bundaberg sugar workers. The Royal Commission, with ALF Secretary Albert Hinchcliffe as secretary, concluded the AWA demands had been justified. The union victory was a watershed in organised labour in Queensland and Australia.
=== Further progress ===
St Joseph&#x27;s School opened in June 1876.

With the passage of the &quot;Local Authorities Act 1902&quot;, Barolin Division became the Shire of Barolin and the Borough of Bundaberg became the Town of Bundaberg on 31 March 1903. On 22 November 1913, Bundaberg was proclaimed a City.

In 1912 Bundaberg pioneering aviator Bert Hinkler built and successfully flew his own glider on Mon Repos beach. He also completed a noteworthy non-stop flight from London to Turin in 1920. The following year in 1921 Hinkler flew from Sydney to Bundaberg, non-stop, in a record breaking flight of 8 and a half hours, in the process beating a telegram he had sent to his mother, to warn her of his arrival.

The Bundaberg War Memorial commemorating those who died in the Anglo-Boer War and World War I was unveiled by Major-General Charles Brand on 30 July 1921. The Bundaberg digger was imported from Italy and is constructed of Italian marble. The completed memorial, at a cost of £1,650, was the third most costly to be erected in Queensland. It is a major regional memorial and one of the two most intact digger memorials that remain in their original settings of intersections.

The Bundaberg tragedy of 1928 resulted in the deaths of 12 children in a 24-hour period after they were administered a contaminated diphtheria vaccine.

In 1941 the Sisters of Mercy purchased the house &quot;Brabourne&quot; (originally owned by prominent citizen Frederick Buss) and established St Mary&#x27;s Hostel, for women and girls working in or visiting Bundaberg. After World War II, doctors were calling for modern hospital facilities in Bundaberg, so the Sisters converted the hostel into the Mater Private Hospital, a 24-bed hospital with an operating theatre, chapel, and accommodation for the nurses and maids, officially opening on 28 July 1946. The nurses were initially all nuns, but they established a training school for other women to become nurses. The hospital expanded over the years with additional beds, operating theatres, X-ray, pathology and a dedicated children&#x27;s ward. It was the first hospital in Queensland to use the Zeiss ophthalmic microscope, the first regional hospital in Queensland to have a lymphoedema clinic, and to use facial recognition technology for endoscopic sinus surgery.

In the 1960s the township was completely flooded by the Burnett river. In 1967 Bundaberg celebrated its centenary by producing a coin and opening The Bundaberg and District Historical Museum in the Bundaberg Botanical Gardens in Bundaberg North.

===Bundaberg in the 21st century===
In December 2010, Bundaberg suffered its worst floods in 60 years, when floodwaters from the Burnett River inundated hundreds of homes.

Two years later, in January 2013, Bundaberg experienced its worst flooding in recorded history as a result of Cyclone Oswald. Floodwaters from the Burnett River peaked at 9.53 metres. Over 4,000 properties and 600 businesses had been affected by floodwaters, which moved in excess of . Two defence force Blackhawk helicopters were brought in from Townsville as part of the evacuation operation, which ultimately used an additional 14 aircraft.

On 6 April 2018, Prince Charles visited Bundaberg Rum Distillery He stated, &quot;“I&#x27;m thrilled that this Distillery&#x27;s proving to be the one that produces some of the most famous and special of all rums around the world.&quot;&quot;

In 2018, the Australian Bureau of Statistics estimated the population of Bundaberg&#x27;s significant urban area was 70,921 people.

== Climate ==
Bundaberg has a warm humid subtropical climate (Köppen: Cfa) with hot, wet summers and very mild, dry winters. Mean maximum temperatures are high for most of the year, from in July to in January. Annual rainfall averages around , with a strong summer maximum and winter minimum. Extreme temperatures ranged from on 16 July 1918 to on 19 December 1901.
== Suburbs of Bundaberg ==


Increasing population in Bundaberg is extending residential development into rural localities, such as Ashfield.

== Economy ==


Subtropical Bundaberg is dependent to a large extent on the local sugar industry. Extensive sugar cane fields have been developed throughout the district. Value-adding operations, such as the milling and refinement of sugar, and its packaging and distribution, are located around the city. A local factory that manufactured sugar-cane harvesters was closed down after it was taken over by the US multinational corporation Case New Holland. Most of the raw sugar is exported. A bulk terminal for the export of sugar is located on the Burnett River east of Bundaberg. Recent years have seen the reduction of cane farms and in turn increase of Macadamia farms, whoms main market is China.

Another of the city&#x27;s exports is Bundaberg Rum, made from the sugar cane by-product molasses. Bundaberg is also home to beverage producer Bundaberg Brewed Drinks Vintage Soda, Craft Brewery Ballistic Brewing Company and Craft Distillery&#x27;s Waterview Distillery and Kalki Moon.

Commercial fruit and vegetable production is also significant: avocado, banana, bean, button squash, capsicum, chilli, citrus, cucumber, custard apple, egg fruit, honeydew melon, lychee, mango, passionfruit, potato, pumpkin, rockmelon, snow peas, stone fruit, sweet corn, sweet potato, tomato, watermelon, zucchini. Macadamia nuts are also grown. Due to the year-round farm work available in Bundaberg, the city has a high number of working hostels for backpackers looking to extend their working holiday visa in Australia. The hostels provide backpackers with work on farms across the Bundaberg area. However, the hostels and farms have received huge criticism in the press and on social media due to the treatment some backpackers have faced. The Courier-Mail have reported claims of poor living conditions, underpayment and allegations of sexual abuse which they say has led to backpackers warning others about working hostels in Bundaberg.

Because of its high rate of unemployment, Bundaberg has been referred to as the &quot;dole capital of Australia&quot;.

==Tourism==
Tourism is an important industry in Queensland, and Bundaberg is known as the &#x27;Southern Gateway to the Great Barrier Reef&#x27;. The city lies near the southern end of the reef in proximity to Lady Elliot and Lady Musgrave Islands. The nearby town of Bargara is an increasingly popular holiday and retirement destination.
Nearby beaches are popular with both locals and tourists. Moore Park Beach, to the city&#x27;s north, has of golden sandy beach. Beaches on the southern side of the Burnett River are (from north to south) the Oaks Beach, Mon Repos, Nielson Park, Bargara Beach, Kellys Beach, Innes Park and Elliott Heads.

Cania Gorge National Park, Deepwater National Park, Eurimbula National Park and Kinkuna National Park, located in the Bundaberg region are popular with campers and bush-lovers.

Tours of the Bundaberg Rum distillery and attractions at Bundaberg Botanic Gardens, such as the 2 ft narrow gauge Australian Sugar Cane Railway, are also popular with tourists. The Mystery Craters, 35 unexplained water-filled holes in the ground, discovered in 1971 at South Kolan, are also a tourist attraction.

Opened in 2002 by the former member for Hinkler Paul Neville, the Tom Quinn Community Centre gardens (a multiple &quot;Bundy in Bloom&quot; winner) is a site to be seen with local flora and fauna, its own cafe, marketplace, chapel, green house, training facilities, woodwork and indigenous nature section.

Opened in December 2008, the Hinkler Hall of Aviation is an historical aviation tourist attraction that celebrates pioneer solo aviator Bert Hinkler. In 1928, Hinkler was the first person to fly solo from England to Australia. The museum includes an exhibition hall, featuring multi-media exhibits, a flight simulator, a theatre, five aircraft and the historic Hinkler House.

Other local attractions and events include the Whaling Wall, East Bundaberg Water Tower, Baldwin Swamp Environmental Park, Alexandra Park Zoo, Buss Park, Barrell House, Bundy in Bloom, Whale watching, reef tours of Lady Musgrave &amp; Lady Elliiot islands, the Bundaberg Show, Bundaberg &amp; Childers Regional Art Galleries, the Bundaberg Gliding school, Fishing Charters, the Bundaberg International Air Show, and the Woongarra Marine Park.

Bundaberg has ghost tours.

<text>Year 426 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Tribunate of Cincinnatus, Albinus, Fusus and Cossus (or, less frequently, year 328 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 426 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===
==== Greece ====
* The Athenian leader Cleon and Athenian general Demosthenes revitalise the city&#x27;s military and naval forces despite opposition from Nicias, a rich merchant and soldier, and his supporters.
* Demosthenes unsuccessfully besieges the Corinthian colony of Leukas. As a result, he does not return to Athens, fearing for his life. However when, later in the year, Ambracia invades Acarnania, and the Acarnanians seek help from Demosthenes, who is patrolling the Ionian Sea coast with twenty Athenian ships, he reaches the Athenian naval base in the Gulf of Corinth at Naupactus and secures it just in time to defend it against a large Spartan army from Delphi under Eurylochus which has come to assist the Ambraciots. Demosthenes defeats the Spartan army and Eurylochus is killed during the Battle of Olpae. The Acarnanians and Ambraciots then sign a peace treaty.
* An Athenian army under Nicias, Hipponicus and Eurymedon defeats a combined Tanagran and Theban army in the Battle of Tanagra.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

<doc id="72819" wikidata="Q750215" url="?curid=72819" title="Mass murder">
<text>Mass murder is the violent crime of killing a number of people, typically simultaneously or over a relatively short period of time and in close geographic proximity. A mass murder typically occurs in a single location where one or more persons kill several others.

In the United States, Congress defined mass murders as the killing of three or more persons during an event with no &quot;cooling-off period&quot; between the homicides. The Investigative Assistance for Violent Crimes Act of 2012, passed in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, clarified the statutory authority for federal law enforcement agencies, including those in the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security, to assist state law enforcement agencies, and mandated across federal agencies a definition of &quot;mass killing&quot; as three or more killings during an incident.

A mass murder may be further classified as a mass shooting or a mass stabbing. Mass murderers differ from spree killers, who kill at two or more locations with almost no time break between murders and are not defined by the number of victims, and serial killers, who kill people over long periods of time.

==By terrorist organizations==
Many terrorist groups in recent times have used the tactic of killing many victims to fulfill their political aims. Such incidents have included:

* 33 civilians killed in the Başbağlar attack by the PKK on July 5, 1993;
* 19 American airmen killed in the Khobar Towers bombing on June 25, 1996, by Hezbollah Al-Hejaz;
* 2,977 people killed by Al-Qaeda in the September 11 attacks of 2001; 
* 193 people killed in the 2004 Madrid train bombings by Al-Qaeda;
* 334 (including 186 children) killed in the Beslan school siege on September 1–4, 2004 by Riyad-us Saliheen;
* 52 killed in the 2005 London bombings by Islamic terrorists; 
* 166 killed in the 2008 Mumbai attacks by Lashkar-e-Taiba;
* 156 children and teachers killed in the 2014 Peshawar school massacre by Tehrik-i-Taliban in Peshawar, Pakistan;
* 1,095 killed in the Camp Speicher massacre by the Islamic State;
* 224 people killed in the Metrojet Flight 9268 by the Islamic State;
* 130 killed as the result of the November 2015 Paris attacks by the Islamic State;
*1,180 killed in the October 7th 2023 attack on Israel led by Hamas and several other Palestinian Terrorist groups;

==By cults==
Certain cults, especially religious cults, have committed a number of mass killings and mass murder–suicides.

* Jim Jones&#x27; Peoples Temple in Jonestown, Guyana, where 919 people died in 1978
* Order of the Solar Temple in Canada, Switzerland, and France, where 74 died in 1994, 1995, and 1997
* Shoko Asahara&#x27;s Aum Shinrikyo, which killed 14 in Tokyo, Japan, in 1995
* Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God in Uganda, where 778 died in 2000

==By individuals and governments==
Mass murderers may be categorized into killers of family, of coworkers, of students, and of random strangers. Their motives vary. One motivation for mass murder is revenge, but other motivations are possible, including the need for attention or fame.

Several autocratic regimes have been known to have ordered mass murders including genocide and politicide. Acting on the orders of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, Vasili Blokhin&#x27;s war crime of killing of 7,000 Polish prisoners of war, shot over 28 days, was one of the most organized and protracted mass murders by a single individual on record.

===Law enforcement response and countermeasures===
Analysis of the Columbine High School massacre and other incidents where law enforcement officers waited for backup has resulted in changed recommendations regarding what victims, bystanders, and law enforcement officers should do. In the Columbine shooting, the perpetrators, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, were able to murder 13 people, then commit suicide before the first SWAT team even entered the school. Average response time by law enforcement to a mass shooting is typically much longer than the time the shooter is engaged in killing. While immediate action may be extremely dangerous, it could save lives which would be lost if victims and bystanders involved in the situation remain passive, or law enforcement response is delayed until overwhelming force can be deployed. It is recommended that victims and bystanders involved in the incident take active steps to flee, hide, or fight the shooter and that law enforcement officers present or first arriving at the scene attempt immediately to engage the shooter. In many instances, immediate action by victims, bystanders, or law enforcement officers has saved lives. However, law enforcement programs and actions have so far been unable to reduce the total number of incidents. In 2020, a record number of 600 mass shootings occurred.

==Criticism as an analytical category==
Commentators have pointed out that there are a wide variety of ways that homicides with more than several victims might be classified. Such incidents can be, and have been even in recent decades, classified many different ways including &quot;as a &quot;mass shooting&quot;; as a &quot;school shooting&quot;; as &quot;mass murder&quot;; as &quot;workplace violence&quot;...; as &quot;a crime involving an assault rifle&quot;; as &quot;a case of a mentally ill person committing acts of violence&quot;; and so on.&quot;

How such rarely occurring incidents of homicide are classified tends to change significantly with time. &quot;In the 1960s and 1970s... it was understood that the key feature of [a number of such] cases was a high body count. These early discussions of mass murder lumped together [a variety of] cases that varied along what would come to be seen as important dimensions:
* Time: Did the killings occur more or less simultaneously, or did they extend over several days, months, or years?
* Place: Did the killings occur in a single location, or in a variety of places?
* Method: How were the victims killed?&quot;
In the late decades of the 20th century and early years of the 2000s, the most popular classifications moved to include method, time and place.

While such classifications may assist in gaining human meaning, as human-selected categories, they can also carry significant meaning and reflect a particular point of view of the commentator who assigned the descriptor.

<text>The turkey is a large bird in the genus Meleagris, native to North America. There are two extant turkey species: the wild turkey (&quot;Meleagris gallopavo&quot;) of eastern and central North America and the ocellated turkey (&quot;Meleagris ocellata&quot;) of the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico. Males of both turkey species have a distinctive fleshy wattle, called a snood, that hangs from the top of the beak. They are among the largest birds in their ranges. As with many large ground-feeding birds (order Galliformes), the male is bigger and much more colorful than the female.

The earliest turkeys evolved in North America over 20 million years ago. They share a recent common ancestor with grouse, pheasants, and other fowl. The wild turkey species is the ancestor of the domestic turkey, which was domesticated approximately 2,000 years ago by indigenous peoples. It was this domesticated turkey that later reached Eurasia, during the Columbian exchange.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Meleagris&quot; was introduced in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. The genus name is from the Ancient Greek μελεαγρις, &quot;meleagris&quot; meaning &quot;guineafowl&quot;. The type species is the wild turkey (&quot;Meleagris gallopavo&quot;).

Turkeys are classed in the family Phasianidae (pheasants, partridges, francolins, junglefowl, grouse, and relatives thereof) in the taxonomic order Galliformes. They are close relatives of the grouse and are classified alongside them in the tribe Tetraonini.

===Extant species===
The genus contains two species.



===Fossil species===
* &quot;Meleagris californica&quot; Californian turkey – Southern California
* &quot;Meleagris crassipes&quot; Southwestern turkey - New Mexico

==Names==

The linguist Mario Pei proposes two possible explanations for the name &quot;turkey&quot;. One theory suggests that when Europeans first encountered turkeys in the Americas, they incorrectly identified the birds as a type of guineafowl, which were already being imported into Europe by English merchants to the Levant via Constantinople. The birds were therefore nicknamed &quot;turkey coqs&quot;. The name of the North American bird may have then become &quot;turkey fowl&quot; or &quot;Indian turkeys&quot;, which was eventually shortened to &quot;turkeys&quot;.

A second theory arises from turkeys coming to England not directly from the Americas, but via merchant ships from the Middle East, where they were domesticated successfully. Again the importers lent the name to the bird; hence&quot; turkey-cocks&quot; and &quot;turkey-hens&quot;, and soon thereafter, &quot;turkeys&quot;.

In 1550, the English navigator William Strickland, who had introduced the turkey into England, was granted a coat of arms including a &quot;turkey-cock in his pride proper&quot;. William Shakespeare used the term in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, believed to be written in 1601 or 1602. The lack of context around his usage suggests that the term was already widespread.

Other European names for turkeys incorporate an assumed Indian origin, such as (&#x27;from India&#x27;) in French, (, &#x27;bird of India&#x27;) in Russian, in Polish and Ukrainian, and (&#x27;Indian&#x27;) in Turkish. These are thought to arise from the supposed belief of Christopher Columbus that he had reached India rather than the Americas on his voyage. In Portuguese a turkey is a ; the name is thought to derive from the country in South America &#x27;Peru&#x27;.

Several other birds that are sometimes called turkeys are not particularly closely related: the brushturkeys are megapodes, and the bird sometimes known as the &quot;Australian turkey&quot; is the Australian bustard (&quot;Ardeotis australis&quot;). The anhinga (&quot;Anhinga anhinga&quot;) is sometimes called the &quot;water turkey&quot;, from the shape of its tail when the feathers are fully spread for drying.

An infant turkey is called a &quot;chick&quot; or &quot;poult&quot;.

==History==

Turkeys were likely first domesticated in Pre-Columbian Mexico, where they held a cultural and symbolic importance. The Classical Nahuatl word for the turkey, ( in Spanish), is still used in modern Mexico, in addition to the general term . Mayan aristocrats and priests appear to have had a special connection to ocellated turkeys, with ideograms of those birds appearing in Mayan manuscripts. Spanish chroniclers, including Bernal Díaz del Castillo and Father Bernardino de Sahagún, describe the multitude of food (both raw fruits and vegetables as well as prepared dishes) that were offered in the vast markets () of Tenochtitlán, noting there were tamales made of turkeys, iguanas, chocolate, vegetables, fruits and more.

Turkeys were first exported to Europe via Spain around 1519, where they gained immediate popularity among the aristocratic classes. Turkeys arrived in England in 1541. From there, English settlers brought turkeys to North America during the 17th century.

=== Destruction and re-introduction in the United States ===
In what is now the United States, there were an estimated 10 million turkeys in the 17th century. By the 1930s, only 30,000 remained. In the 1960s and 1970s, biologists started trapping wild turkeys from the few places they remained (including the Ozarks and New York), and re-introducing them into other states, including Minnesota and Vermont. Starting in 2014, researchers sent a survey to wildlife biologists in the National Wild Turkey Federation Technical Committee across the U.S. states to gather data regarding the population of turkeys. As of 2019, the wild turkey population declined by around 3% since 2014. Also as of 2019, the number of wild turkey hunters decreased by 18% since 2014 from the reports of the participating U.S. states. The 2019 data for population was missing information from 12 states and the 2019 hunter data was missing information from 8 states.

==Human conflicts with wild turkeys==
Turkeys have been known to be aggressive toward humans and pets in residential areas. Wild turkeys have a social structure and pecking order and turkeys may respond to humans and animals as they do to other turkeys. Habituated turkeys may attempt to dominate or attack people that the birds view as subordinates.

In 2017, the town of Brookline, Massachusetts, recommended a controversial approach when confronted with wild turkeys. Besides taking a step forward to intimidate the birds, officials also suggested &quot;making noise (clanging pots or other objects together); popping open an umbrella; shouting and waving your arms; squirting them with a hose; allowing your leashed dog to bark at them; and forcefully fending them off with a broom&quot;. This advice was quickly rescinded and replaced with a caution that &quot;being aggressive toward wild turkeys is not recommended by State wildlife officials.&quot;

==Fossil record==
A number of turkeys have been described from fossils. The Meleagridinae are known from the Early Miocene ( mya) onwards, with the extinct genera &quot;Rhegminornis&quot; (Early Miocene of Bell, U.S.) and &quot;Proagriocharis&quot; (Kimball Late Miocene/Early Pliocene of Lime Creek, U.S.). The former is probably a basal turkey, the other a more contemporary bird not very similar to known turkeys; both were much smaller birds. A turkey fossil not assignable to genus but similar to &quot;Meleagris&quot; is known from the Late Miocene of Westmoreland County, Virginia. In the modern genus &quot;Meleagris&quot;, a considerable number of species have been described, as turkey fossils are robust and fairly often found, and turkeys show great variation among individuals. Many of these supposed fossilized species are now considered junior synonyms. One, the well-documented California turkey &quot;Meleagris californica&quot;, became extinct recently enough to have been hunted by early human settlers. It has been suggested that its demise was due to the combined pressures of human hunting and climate change at the end of the last glacial period.

The Oligocene fossil &quot;Meleagris antiquus&quot; was first described by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1871. It has since been reassigned to the genus &quot;Paracrax&quot;, first interpreted as a cracid, then soon after as a bathornithid Cariamiformes.

===Fossil species===
* &quot;Meleagris&quot; sp. (Early Pliocene of Bone Valley, U.S.)

* &quot;Meleagris&quot; sp. (Late Pliocene of Macasphalt Shell Pit, U.S.)

* &quot;Meleagris californica&quot; (Late Pleistocene of southwestern U.S.)formerly &quot;Parapavo/Pavo&quot;
* &quot;Meleagris crassipes&quot; (Late Pleistocene of southwestern North America)

Turkeys have been considered by many authorities to be their own family—the Meleagrididae—but a recent genomic analysis of a retrotransposon marker groups turkeys in the family Phasianidae. In 2010, a team of scientists published a draft sequence of the domestic turkey (&quot;Meleagris gallopavo&quot;) genome. In 2023 a new improved haplotype-resolved domestic turkey genome was published, which confirmed the large inversion on the Z chromosome not found in other Galliformes, and found new structural variations between the parent haplotypes that provides potential new target genes for breeding.

==Anatomy==

In anatomical terms, a &quot;snood&quot; is an erectile, fleshy protuberance on the forehead of turkeys. Most of the time when the turkey is in a relaxed state, the snood is pale and 2–3 cm long. However, when the male begins strutting (the courtship display), the snood engorges with blood, becomes redder and elongates several centimeters, hanging well below the beak (see image).

Snoods are just one of the caruncles (small, fleshy excrescences) that can be found on turkeys.

While fighting, commercial turkeys often peck and pull at the snood, causing damage and bleeding. This often leads to further injurious pecking by other turkeys and sometimes results in cannibalism. To prevent this, some farmers cut off the snood when the chick is young, a process known as &quot;de-snooding&quot;.

The snood can be between in length depending on the turkey&#x27;s sex, health, and mood.

===Function===
The snood functions in both intersexual and intrasexual selection. Captive female wild turkeys prefer to mate with long-snooded males, and during dyadic interactions, male turkeys defer to males with relatively longer snoods. These results were demonstrated using both live males and controlled artificial models of males. Data on the parasite burdens of free-living wild turkeys revealed a negative correlation between snood length and infection with intestinal coccidia, deleterious protozoan parasites. This indicates that in the wild, the long-snooded males preferred by females and avoided by males seemed to be resistant to coccidial infection. Scientists also conducted a study on 500 male turkeys, gathering data on their snood lengths and blood samples for immune system functionality. They discovered a similar negative correlation. The presence of more red blood cells when the snood is not removed will help to fight off unwanted invaders in their immune system, explaining this trend.

== Behavior ==

=== Feeding ===
Wild turkeys feed on various wildlife, depending on the season. In the warmer months of spring and summer, their diet consists mainly of grains such as wheat, corn, and of smaller animals such as grasshoppers, spiders, worms, and lizards. In the colder months of fall and winter, wild turkeys consume smaller fruits and nuts such as grapes, blueberries, acorns, and walnuts. To find this food, they have to continuously forage and feed most during the sunrise and sunset hours.

Domesticated turkeys consume a commercially produced feed formulated to increase the size of the turkeys. To supplement their nutrition, farmers will also feed them grains wild turkeys eat such as corn.

=== Grooming ===
Turkeys participate in a number of grooming behaviors including: dusting, sunning, and feather preening. In dusting, turkeys get low on their stomach or side and flap their wings, coating themselves with dirt. This action serves to remove debris build-up on the feathers and also clog tiny pores that parasites such as lice can inhabit. Sunning for turkeys involves bathing in the sunlight, for their top and bottom halves. This can serve to liquidate the oil that turkeys naturally produce, spreading over their feathers and dry their feathers from precipitation at the same time. In feather preening, turkeys are able to remove dirt and bacteria, while also ensuring that non-durable feathers are removed.

=== Flight ===
Though domestic turkeys are considered flightless, wild turkeys can and do fly for short distances. Turkeys are best adapted for walking and foraging; they do not fly as a normal means of travel. When faced with a perceived danger, wild turkeys can fly up to a quarter mile. Turkeys may also make short flights to assist roosting in a tree.

==Use by humans==

The species &quot;Meleagris gallopavo&quot; is eaten by humans. They were first domesticated by the indigenous people of Mexico from at least 800 BC onwards. By 200 BC, the indigenous people of what is today the American Southwest had domesticated turkeys; though the theory that they were introduced from Mexico was once influential, modern studies suggest that the turkeys of the Southwest were domesticated independently from those in Mexico. Turkeys were used both as a food source and for their feathers and bones, which were used in both practical and cultural contexts. Compared to wild turkeys, domestic turkeys are selectively bred to grow larger in size for their meat.

Turkey forms a central part of modern Thanksgiving celebrations in the United States of America, and is often eaten at similar holiday occasions, such as Christmas.

===The Norfolk turkeys===
In her memoirs, Lady Dorothy Nevill (1826–1913) recalls that her great-grandfather Horatio Walpole, 1st Earl of Orford (1723–1809), imported a quantity of American turkeys which were kept in the woods around Wolterton Hall and in all probability were the embryo flock for the popular Norfolk turkey breeds of today.

<doc id="72822" wikidata="Q1755287" url="?curid=72822" title="Japanese wordplay">
<text>Japanese wordplay relies on the nuances of the Japanese language and Japanese script for humorous effect, functioning somewhat like a cross between a pun and a spoonerism. Double entendres have a rich history in Japanese entertainment (such as in kakekotoba) due to the language&#x27;s large number of homographs (different meanings for a given spelling) and homophones (different meanings for a given pronunciation).

== Kakekotoba ==

 or &quot;pivot words&quot; are an early form of Japanese wordplay used in waka poetry, wherein some words represent two homonyms. The presence of multiple meanings within these words allowed poets to impart more meaning into fewer words.

==Goroawase==
 is an especially common form of Japanese wordplay, wherein homophonous words are associated with a given series of letters, numbers or symbols, in order to associate a new meaning with that series. The new words can be used to express a superstition about certain letters or numbers. More commonly, however, &quot;goroawase&quot; is used as a mnemonic technique, especially in the memorization of numbers such as dates in history, scientific constants and phone numbers.

===Numeric substitution===

In Japanese, each digit/number has at least one native Japanese (kun&#x27;yomi), Sino-Japanese (on&#x27;yomi), and English-origin reading. Furthermore, variants of readings may be produced through abbreviation (i.e. rendering &quot;ichi&quot; as &quot;i&quot;), consonant voicing (i.e &quot;sa&quot; as &quot;za&quot;; see Dakuten and handakuten), gemination (i.e. &quot;roku&quot; as &quot;rokku&quot;; see sokuon), vowel lengthening (i.e. &quot;ni&quot; as &quot;nii&quot;; see chōonpu), or the insertion of the nasal mora &quot;n&quot; (ん). Non-single digit numbers, most commonly ten, are also occasionally used. Goroawase substitutions are well known as mnemonics, notably in the selection of memorable telephone numbers used by companies and the memorization of numbers such as years in the study of history.
Numeric substitutions may contain multiple types of readings and variations; for example, 0348, read as uses abbreviated English readings for zero and three, an on&#x27;yomi reading for four, and ends with a kun&#x27;yomi reading for eight.
====Examples====

* 11 can be read as &quot;wan-wan&quot;, which is commonly used in Japan as an onomatopoeia for a dog barking.
* 16 can be read as &quot;hi-ro&quot;, Hiro being a common Japanese given name. 16 is also a common age for anime and manga protagonists (i.e., heroes).
* 26 can be read as &quot;fu-ro&quot; (), meaning &quot;bath&quot;. Public baths in Japan have reduced entry fees on the 26th day of every month.
* 29 can be read as &quot;ni-ku&quot; (), meaning &quot;meat&quot;. Restaurants and grocery stores have special offers on the 29th day of every month.
*39 can be read as &quot;san-kyū&quot;, referring to &quot;thank you&quot; in English.
* 44 can be read as &quot;yo-yo&quot; and is thus a common slang term in the international competitive yo-yo community, which has a strong Japanese presence.
* 56, read as &quot;ko-ro&quot;, is used in , an alternate spelling of the verb &quot;korosu&quot; (, to kill) used on the internet to avoid wordfilters.
* 89 can be read as &quot;ha-gu&quot;, which refers to &quot;hug&quot; in English. August 9th is National Hug Day in Japan.
* 109 can be read as &quot;tō-kyū&quot;. The 109 department store in Shibuya, Tokyo is often read as &quot;ichi-maru-kyū&quot;, but the number 109 was selected as the alternative reading &quot;tō-kyū&quot; is a reference to Tokyu Corporation, the group that owns the building.
* 230 can be read as &quot;fu-mi-o&quot;, the given name of former Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida. He uses this number in his Twitter handle &quot;kishida230&quot;.
* 428 can be read as &quot;shi-bu-ya&quot;, referring to the Shibuya area of Tokyo, and &quot;yo-tsu-ba&quot; () meaning four-leaf clover.
* 526 can be read as &quot;ko-ji-ro&quot; in reference to Sasaki Kojiro, a samurai from the Edo period.
* 634 can be read as &quot;mu-sa-shi&quot;. The Tokyo Skytree&#x27;s height was intentionally set at 634 meters so it would sound like Musashi Province, an old name for the area in which the building stands.
*801 can be read as &quot;ya-o-i&quot; or yaoi, a genre of homoerotic manga typically aimed at women.
* 893 can be read as &quot;ya-ku-za&quot; () or &quot;yakuza&quot;. It is traditionally a bad omen for a student to receive this candidate number for an exam.
*1492, the year of Columbus&#x27; first voyage to America, can be read as &quot;i-yo-ku-ni&quot; and appended with &quot;ga mieta&quot; to form the phrase &quot;Alright! I can see land!&quot; (). Additionally, &quot;i-yo-ku-ni&quot; itself could simply be interpreted as &quot;It&#x27;s a good country&quot; (). The alternative reading &quot;i-shi-ku-ni&quot; is also used to memorize the year, though it is not typically associated with a particular meaning.
* 4649 can be read as &quot;yo-ro-shi-ku&quot; (), meaning &quot;best regards&quot;.
* 18782 + 18782 = 37564 can be read as &quot;i-ya-na-ya-tsu + i-ya-na-ya-tsu = mi-na-go-ro-shi&quot; .
*3.14159265, the first nine digits of pi, can be read as &quot;san-i-shi-i-ko-ku-ni-mu-kou&quot; (), meaning &quot;an obstetrician faces towards a foreign country&quot;.

==Dajare==

In Japanese, puns are referred to as . Like puns in English, &quot;dajare&quot; may be considered . &quot;Dajare&quot; commonly involve the usage of two homophonous phrases alongside each other in a sentence, though double entendres are used as well.

Example one:
* アルミ缶の上にある蜜柑 (arumi kan no ue ni aru mikan)
: Translation:
: An orange on an aluminum can.
: Explanation:
: アルミ (&quot;arumi&quot;) means &quot;aluminum&quot; and 缶 (&quot;kan&quot;) means &quot;can&quot;; ある (aru) means &quot;to exist&quot; and 蜜柑 (&quot;mikan&quot;) refers to mandarin varieties popular in Japan.

Example two:
: A: 大食いのたけし君も、宇宙ではあまり物を食べられないよ。 (&quot;ōgui no takeshi kun mo, uchū dewa amari mono o taberarenaiyo&quot;)
: B: なぜ? (&quot;naze&quot;)
: A: 宇宙には空気(食う気)がない。 (&quot;uchū niwa kūki ga nai&quot;)
: Translation:
: A: In space, even a glutton like Takeshi can&#x27;t eat anything.
: B: Why&#x27;s that?
: A: In space, there is no air.
: Explanation:
: &quot;Kūki&quot; (くうき) can mean either &quot;air&quot; (空気) or &quot;appetite&quot; (食う気), thus the last phrase could also be interpreted as &quot;in space, (he has) no appetite&quot;.
===Ginatayomi===
Some &quot;dajare&quot; rely on for effect, similar to garden-path sentences in English. Many are commonly told by children.

Example one:&lt;br&gt;
:「パン作ったことある」(&quot;pan tsukutta koto aru&quot;; Have you ever made bread before?)
:　Can also be interpreted as:
:「パンツ食ったことある」(&quot;pantsu kutta koto aru&quot;; Have you ever eaten underpants before?)

Example two:&lt;br&gt;
:「ねぇ、ちゃんとお風呂入ってる」(&quot;nee, chanto ofuro haitteru&quot;; Hey, have you been bathing regularly?)
:　Can also be interpreted as:
:「姉ちゃんとお風呂入ってる」(&quot;nee-chan to ofuro haitteru&quot;; Do you bathe with your older sister?)

<doc id="72824" wikidata="Q875399" url="?curid=72824" title="Boundary (topology)">
<text>In topology and mathematics in general, the boundary of a subset of a topological space is the set of points in the closure of not belonging to the interior of . An element of the boundary of is called a boundary point of . The term boundary operation refers to finding or taking the boundary of a set. Notations used for boundary of a set include formula_1 and formula_2.

Some authors (for example Willard, in &quot;General Topology&quot;) use the term frontier instead of boundary in an attempt to avoid confusion with a different definition used in algebraic topology and the theory of manifolds. Despite widespread acceptance of the meaning of the terms boundary and frontier, they have sometimes been used to refer to other sets. For example, &quot;Metric Spaces&quot; by E. T. Copson uses the term boundary to refer to Hausdorff&#x27;s border, which is defined as the intersection of a set with its boundary. Hausdorff also introduced the term residue, which is defined as the intersection of a set with the closure of the border of its complement.

== Definitions ==

There are several equivalent definitions for the boundary of a subset formula_3 of a topological space formula_4 which will be denoted by formula_5 formula_6 or simply formula_2 if formula_8 is understood:
A boundary point of a set is any element of that set&#x27;s boundary. The boundary formula_9 defined above is sometimes called the set&#x27;s topological boundary to distinguish it from other similarly named notions such as the boundary of a manifold with boundary or the boundary of a manifold with corners, to name just a few examples.

A connected component of the boundary of is called a boundary component of .

== Properties ==

The closure of a set formula_10 equals the union of the set with its boundary: 
formula_11 
where formula_12 denotes the closure of formula_10 in formula_14 
A set is closed if and only if it contains its boundary, and open if and only if it is disjoint from its boundary. The boundary of a set is closed; this follows from the formula formula_15 which expresses formula_9 as the intersection of two closed subsets of formula_14 

(&quot;Trichotomy&quot;) Given any subset formula_18 each point of formula_8 lies in exactly one of the three sets formula_20 and formula_21 Said differently, formula_22 and these three sets are pairwise disjoint. Consequently, if these set are not empty then they form a partition of formula_14 

A point formula_24 is a boundary point of a set if and only if every neighborhood of formula_25 contains at least one point in the set and at least one point not in the set. 
The boundary of the interior of a set as well as the boundary of the closure of a set are both contained in the boundary of the set. 

&quot;Conceptual Venn diagram showing the relationships among different points of a subset formula_10 of formula_27 formula_28 = set of accumulation points of formula_10 (also called limit points), formula_30 set of boundary points of formula_31 area shaded green = set of interior points of formula_31 area shaded yellow = set of isolated points of formula_31 areas shaded black = empty sets. Every point of formula_10 is either an interior point or a boundary point. Also, every point of formula_10 is either an accumulation point or an isolated point. Likewise, every boundary point of formula_10 is either an accumulation point or an isolated point. Isolated points are always boundary points.&quot;
== Examples ==

=== Characterizations and general examples ===

A set and its complement have the same boundary:
formula_37

A set formula_38 is a dense open subset of formula_8 if and only if formula_40 

The interior of the boundary of a closed set is empty. 
Consequently, the interior of the boundary of the closure of a set is empty. 
The interior of the boundary of an open set is also empty. 
Consequently, the interior of the boundary of the interior of a set is empty. 
In particular, if formula_3 is a closed or open subset of formula_8 then there does not exist any nonempty subset formula_43 such that formula_38 is open in formula_14 
This fact is important for the definition and use of nowhere dense subsets, meager subsets, and Baire spaces. 

A set is the boundary of some open set if and only if it is closed and nowhere dense. 
The boundary of a set is empty if and only if the set is both closed and open (that is, a clopen set).

=== Concrete examples ===
Consider the real line formula_46 with the usual topology (that is, the topology whose basis sets are open intervals) and formula_47 the subset of rational numbers (whose topological interior in formula_46 is empty). Then

* formula_49
* formula_50
* formula_51
* formula_52

These last two examples illustrate the fact that the boundary of a dense set with empty interior is its closure. They also show that it is possible for the boundary formula_2 of a subset formula_10 to contain a non-empty open subset of formula_55; that is, for the interior of formula_2 in formula_8 to be non-empty. However, a subset&#x27;s boundary always has an empty interior. 

In the space of rational numbers with the usual topology (the subspace topology of formula_46), the boundary of formula_59 where formula_60 is irrational, is empty.

The boundary of a set is a topological notion and may change if one changes the topology. For example, given the usual topology on formula_61 the boundary of a closed disk formula_62 is the disk&#x27;s surrounding circle: formula_63 If the disk is viewed as a set in formula_64 with its own usual topology, that is, formula_65 then the boundary of the disk is the disk itself: formula_66 If the disk is viewed as its own topological space (with the subspace topology of formula_67), then the boundary of the disk is empty. 

=== Boundary of an open ball vs. its surrounding sphere ===

This example demonstrates that the topological boundary of an open ball of radius formula_68 is necessarily equal to the corresponding sphere of radius formula_69 (centered at the same point); it also shows that the closure of an open ball of radius formula_68 is necessarily equal to the closed ball of radius formula_69 (again centered at the same point). 
Denote the usual Euclidean metric on formula_67 by
formula_73
which induces on formula_67 the usual Euclidean topology. 
Let formula_75 denote the union of the formula_76-axis formula_77 with the unit circle formula_78 centered at the origin formula_79; that is, formula_80 which is a topological subspace of formula_67 whose topology is equal to that induced by the (restriction of) the metric formula_82 
In particular, the sets formula_83 and formula_84 are all closed subsets of formula_67 and thus also closed subsets of its subspace formula_14 
Henceforth, unless it clearly indicated otherwise, every open ball, closed ball, and sphere should be assumed to be centered at the origin formula_87 and moreover, only the metric space formula_88 will be considered (and not its superspace formula_89); this being a path-connected and locally path-connected complete metric space. 

Denote the open ball of radius formula_68 in formula_88 by 
formula_92
so that when formula_93 then 
formula_94
is the open sub-interval of the formula_76-axis strictly between formula_96 and formula_97 
The unit sphere in formula_88 (&quot;unit&quot; meaning that its radius is formula_93) is 
formula_100
while the closed unit ball in formula_88 is the union of the open unit ball and the unit sphere centered at this same point: 
formula_102

However, the topological boundary formula_103 and topological closure formula_104 in formula_8 of the open unit ball formula_106 are:
formula_107
In particular, the open unit ball&#x27;s topological boundary formula_108 is a subset of the unit sphere formula_109 in formula_110 
And the open unit ball&#x27;s topological closure formula_111 is a proper subset of the closed unit ball formula_112 in formula_110 
The point formula_114 for instance, cannot belong to formula_104 because there does not exist a sequence in formula_116 that converges to it; the same reasoning generalizes to also explain why no point in formula_8 outside of the closed sub-interval formula_84 belongs to formula_119 Because the topological boundary of the set formula_106 is always a subset of formula_106&#x27;s closure, it follows that formula_103 must also be a subset of formula_123 

In any metric space formula_124 the topological boundary in formula_125 of an open ball of radius formula_68 centered at a point formula_127 is always a subset of the sphere of radius formula_69 centered at that same point formula_129; that is, 
formula_130
always holds. 

Moreover, the unit sphere in formula_88 contains formula_132 which is an open subset of formula_14 This shows, in particular, that the unit sphere formula_134 in formula_88 contains a subset of formula_14

== Boundary of a boundary ==

For any set formula_137 where formula_138 denotes the superset with equality holding if and only if the boundary of formula_10 has no interior points, which will be the case for example if formula_10 is either closed or open. Since the boundary of a set is closed, formula_141 for any set formula_142 The boundary operator thus satisfies a weakened kind of idempotence.

In discussing boundaries of manifolds or simplexes and their simplicial complexes, one often meets the assertion that the boundary of the boundary is always empty. Indeed, the construction of the singular homology rests critically on this fact. The explanation for the apparent incongruity is that the topological boundary (the subject of this article) is a slightly different concept from the boundary of a manifold or of a simplicial complex. For example, the boundary of an open disk viewed as a manifold is empty, as is its topological boundary viewed as a subset of itself, while its topological boundary viewed as a subset of the real plane is the circle surrounding the disk. Conversely, the boundary of a closed disk viewed as a manifold is the bounding circle, as is its topological boundary viewed as a subset of the real plane, while its topological boundary viewed as a subset of itself is empty. In particular, the topological boundary depends on the ambient space, while the boundary of a manifold is invariant.

<doc id="72827" wikidata="Q913764" url="?curid=72827" title="Cauchy's integral formula">
<text>In mathematics, Cauchy&#x27;s integral formula, named after Augustin-Louis Cauchy, is a central statement in complex analysis. It expresses the fact that a holomorphic function defined on a disk is completely determined by its values on the boundary of the disk, and it provides integral formulas for all derivatives of a holomorphic function. Cauchy&#x27;s formula shows that, in complex analysis, &quot;differentiation is equivalent to integration&quot;: complex differentiation, like integration, behaves well under uniform limits – a result that does not hold in real analysis.

==Theorem==
Let be an open subset of the complex plane , and suppose the closed disk defined as
formula_1
is completely contained in . Let be a holomorphic function, and let be the circle, oriented counterclockwise, forming the boundary of . Then for every in the interior of ,
formula_2

The proof of this statement uses the Cauchy integral theorem and like that theorem, it only requires to be complex differentiable. Since formula_3 can be expanded as a power series in the variable formula_4
formula_5
it follows that holomorphic functions are analytic, i.e. they can be expanded as convergent power series.
In particular is actually infinitely differentiable, with
formula_6

This formula is sometimes referred to as Cauchy&#x27;s differentiation formula.

The theorem stated above can be generalized. The circle can be replaced by any closed rectifiable curve in which has winding number one about . Moreover, as for the Cauchy integral theorem, it is sufficient to require that be holomorphic in the open region enclosed by the path and continuous on its closure.

Note that not every continuous function on the boundary can be used to produce a function inside the boundary that fits the given boundary function. For instance, if we put the function , defined for , into the Cauchy integral formula, we get zero for all points inside the circle. In fact, giving just the real part on the boundary of a holomorphic function is enough to determine the function up to an imaginary constant — there is only one imaginary part on the boundary that corresponds to the given real part, up to addition of a constant. We can use a combination of a Möbius transformation and the Stieltjes inversion formula to construct the holomorphic function from the real part on the boundary. For example, the function has real part . On the unit circle this can be written . Using the Möbius transformation and the Stieltjes formula we construct the function inside the circle. The term makes no contribution, and we find the function . This has the correct real part on the boundary, and also gives us the corresponding imaginary part, but off by a constant, namely .

== Proof sketch ==

By using the Cauchy integral theorem, one can show that the integral over (or the closed rectifiable curve) is equal to the same integral taken over an arbitrarily small circle around . Since is continuous, we can choose a circle small enough on which is arbitrarily close to . On the other hand, the integral
formula_7
over any circle centered at . This can be calculated directly via a parametrization (integration by substitution) where and is the radius of the circle.

Letting gives the desired estimate
formula_8

== Example ==

Let
formula_9
and let be the contour described by (the circle of radius 2).

To find the integral of around the contour , we need to know the singularities of . Observe that we can rewrite as follows:
formula_10
where and .

Thus, has poles at and . The moduli of these points are less than 2 and thus lie inside the contour. This integral can be split into two smaller integrals by Cauchy–Goursat theorem; that is, we can express the integral around the contour as the sum of the integral around and where the contour is a small circle around each pole. Call these contours around and around .

Now, each of these smaller integrals can be evaluated by the Cauchy integral formula, but they first must be rewritten to apply the theorem. For the integral around , define as . This is analytic (since the contour does not contain the other singularity). We can simplify to be:
formula_11
and now
formula_12

Since the Cauchy integral formula says that:
formula_13
we can evaluate the integral as follows:
formula_14

Doing likewise for the other contour:
formula_15
we evaluate
formula_16

The integral around the original contour then is the sum of these two integrals:
formula_17

An elementary trick using partial fraction decomposition:
formula_18

==Consequences==
The integral formula has broad applications. First, it implies that a function which is holomorphic in an open set is in fact infinitely differentiable there. Furthermore, it is an analytic function, meaning that it can be represented as a power series. The proof of this uses the dominated convergence theorem and the geometric series applied to

formula_19

The formula is also used to prove the residue theorem, which is a result for meromorphic functions, and a related result, the argument principle. It is known from Morera&#x27;s theorem that the uniform limit of holomorphic functions is holomorphic. This can also be deduced from Cauchy&#x27;s integral formula: indeed the formula also holds in the limit and the integrand, and hence the integral, can be expanded as a power series. In addition the Cauchy formulas for the higher order derivatives show that all these derivatives also converge uniformly.

The analog of the Cauchy integral formula in real analysis is the Poisson integral formula for harmonic functions; many of the results for holomorphic functions carry over to this setting. No such results, however, are valid for more general classes of differentiable or real analytic functions. For instance, the existence of the first derivative of a real function need not imply the existence of higher order derivatives, nor in particular the analyticity of the function. Likewise, the uniform limit of a sequence of (real) differentiable functions may fail to be differentiable, or may be differentiable but with a derivative which is not the limit of the derivatives of the members of the sequence.

Another consequence is that if is holomorphic in and then the coefficients satisfy Cauchy&#x27;s estimate
formula_20

From Cauchy&#x27;s estimate, one can easily deduce that every bounded entire function must be constant (which is Liouville&#x27;s theorem).

The formula can also be used to derive Gauss&#x27;s Mean-Value Theorem, which states
formula_21

In other words, the average value of over the circle centered at with radius is . This can be calculated directly via a parametrization of the circle.

==Generalizations==

===Smooth functions===
A version of Cauchy&#x27;s integral formula is the Cauchy–Pompeiu formula, and holds for smooth functions as well, as it is based on Stokes&#x27; theorem. Let be a disc in and suppose that is a complex-valued function on the closure of . Then
formula_22

One may use this representation formula to solve the inhomogeneous Cauchy–Riemann equations in . Indeed, if is a function in , then a particular solution of the equation is a holomorphic function outside the support of . Moreover, if in an open set ,
formula_23
for some (where ), then is also in and satisfies the equation
formula_24

The first conclusion is, succinctly, that the convolution of a compactly supported measure with the Cauchy kernel
formula_25
is a holomorphic function off the support of . Here denotes the principal value. The second conclusion asserts that the Cauchy kernel is a fundamental solution of the Cauchy–Riemann equations. Note that for smooth complex-valued functions of compact support on the generalized Cauchy integral formula simplifies to
formula_26
and is a restatement of the fact that, considered as a distribution, is a fundamental solution of the Cauchy–Riemann operator .

The generalized Cauchy integral formula can be deduced for any bounded open region with boundary from this result and the formula for the distributional derivative of the characteristic function of :
formula_27
where the distribution on the right hand side denotes contour integration along .
\left(\chi_X\right), \varphi\right\rangle &amp; =-\int_X \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \bar{z}} \mathrm{~d}(x, y) \\
&amp; =-\frac{1}{2} \int_X\left(\partial_x \varphi+\mathrm{i} \partial_y \varphi\right) \mathrm{d}(x, y) .
\end{aligned}
&lt;/math&gt;
then traverse formula_28 in the anti-clockwise direction. Fix a point formula_29 and let formula_30 denote arc length on formula_28 measured from formula_32 anti-clockwise. Then, if formula_33 is the length of formula_34 is a parametrization of formula_28. The derivative formula_36 is a unit tangent to formula_28 and formula_38 is the unit outward normal on formula_28. We are lined up for use of the divergence theorem: put formula_40 so that formula_41 and we get
:formula_42
Hence we proved formula_43.
Now we can deduce the generalized Cauchy integral formula:
^1(X)&lt;/math&gt; and since formula_44 this distribution is locally in formula_45 of the form &quot;distribution times function&quot;, so we may apply the Leibniz rule to calculate its derivatives:
:formula_46
Using that is a fundamental solution of the Cauchy–Riemann operator , we get formula_47:
:formula_48
Applying formula_49 to formula_50:
:formula_51
where formula_43 is used in the last line.

Rearranging, we get
:formula_53
as desired.

===Several variables===
In several complex variables, the Cauchy integral formula can be generalized to polydiscs. Let be the polydisc given as the Cartesian product of open discs :
formula_54

Suppose that is a holomorphic function in continuous on the closure of . Then
formula_55
where .

===In real algebras===

The Cauchy integral formula is generalizable to real vector spaces of two or more dimensions. The insight into this property comes from geometric algebra, where objects beyond scalars and vectors (such as planar bivectors and volumetric trivectors) are considered, and a proper generalization of Stokes&#x27; theorem.

Geometric calculus defines a derivative operator under its geometric product — that is, for a -vector field , the derivative generally contains terms of grade and . For example, a vector field () generally has in its derivative a scalar part, the divergence (), and a bivector part, the curl (). This particular derivative operator has a Green&#x27;s function:
formula_56
where is the surface area of a unit -ball in the space (that is, , the circumference of a circle with radius 1, and , the surface area of a sphere with radius 1). By definition of a Green&#x27;s function,
formula_57

It is this useful property that can be used, in conjunction with the generalized Stokes theorem:
formula_58
where, for an -dimensional vector space, is an -vector and is an -vector. The function can, in principle, be composed of any combination of multivectors. The proof of Cauchy&#x27;s integral theorem for higher dimensional spaces relies on the using the generalized Stokes theorem on the quantity and use of the product rule:
formula_59

When , is called a &quot;monogenic function&quot;, the generalization of holomorphic functions to higher-dimensional spaces — indeed, it can be shown that the Cauchy–Riemann condition is just the two-dimensional expression of the monogenic condition. When that condition is met, the second term in the right-hand integral vanishes, leaving only
formula_60
where is that algebra&#x27;s unit -vector, the pseudoscalar. The result is
formula_61

Thus, as in the two-dimensional (complex analysis) case, the value of an analytic (monogenic) function at a point can be found by an integral over the surface surrounding the point, and this is valid not only for scalar functions but vector and general multivector functions as well.

<doc id="72836" wikidata="Q677935" url="?curid=72836" title="Veii">
<text>Veii (also Veius; ) was an important ancient Etruscan city situated on the southern limits of Etruria and north-northwest of Rome, Italy. It now lies in Isola Farnese, in the comune of Rome. Many other sites associated with and in the city-state of Veii are in Formello, immediately to the north. Formello is named after the drainage channels that were first created by the Veians.

Veii was the richest city of the Etruscan League. It was alternately at war and in alliance with the Roman Kingdom and later Republic for over 300 years. It eventually fell in the Battle of Veii to Roman general Camillus&#x27;s army in 396 BC. Veii continued to be occupied after its capture by the Romans.

The site is now a protected area, part of the Parco di Veio established by the regional authority of Lazio in 1997.

==Site==
=== City of Veii===
The city of Veii lies mainly on a tuff plateau in area.

The Valchetta flows a few miles eastward to join the Tiber River on the south side of Labaro along the Via Flaminia and Veii&#x27;s territory included this area.

Its proximity to the Tiber and the trade route to the interior, which became the Via Flaminia, augmented its prosperity. The Veiians were known to trade with nearby Greece, as well as with the Phoenicians that made up the Levant region. Many Grecian pottery shards have been found throughout the site, dating from as far back as the 8th century BC. Although the river brought wealth and affluence to Veii, it also placed it in competition with Rome for the domination of Latium. 

The temple of Juno was the greatest and most honoured in the city.

The largest visible monument is the sanctuary of Minerva from the 7th c. BC, situated along an important route just outside the city (at modern Portonaccio). Prior to their influx of wealth around the 7th century BC, the people of Veii preferred to worship their gods and goddesses in the open air. Early &quot;temples&quot; consisted of small shrines surrounded by foliage. Due to their affinity to the stars, many Veiians preferred to worship under the night sky. Once the city began to prosper, an official temple was built of wood and stone. The sanctuary was one of the oldest and most revered in Etruria, standing out for its sumptuous polychrome terracotta decorations, many of which can be seen today in the Villa Giulia. The sanctuary included the temple of Apollo of about 510 BC to which belonged the Apollo of Veii (now in the National Etruscan Museum).

The impressive thermal baths and the forum built under Augustus have been partially excavated in recent years.

Many rich &quot;Tumuli&quot; and chamber tombs have been found. The most famous is the Grotta Campana uncovered in 1843, a chamber tomb with the oldest known Etruscan frescoes.

There are also long tunnels leading into the plateau of the city, which may corroborate Livy&#x27;s account of the Roman victory in the Battle of Veii.

The walls of Veii, of which small sections remain, bordered the two intersecting streams using the streambeds as a ditch, with a wall across the plateau closing the triangle.

===Piazza d&#x27;Armi===

Every Etruscan stronghold was built on an elevation, and Veii was no exception. Its &quot;arx&quot;, or citadel, was placed on a bluff delineated by cliffs within the angle of confluence of the two streams, nearly separated from the main ridge by a gully, through which ran a road in the Roman period. An archaeological site, Piazza d&#x27;Armi (&quot;military square&quot;), marks the location today.

===Etruscan League===

Despite the many mysteries surrounding the Etruscan League, it is well documented that the league was one of the most influential organizations in the Mediterranean. Because the Etruscan civilization was split into a federation of city-states, the league allowed the leaders of each to come together and discuss a variety of topics. Like Congress or the United Nations, the statesmen would discuss issues regarding laws, taxes, and territorial disputes. Although little is known about the league itself, scholars have found that the city-states shared a common religion, as well as different variations of the same language. The leaders met on a yearly basis at the Fanum Volumnae Sanctuary near Orvieto. 

===Art===

Veii&#x27;s sculptures and statues were made of terracotta. Most ceramic vessels were decorated with intricate details. Depictions of the everyday life of Etruscans were very common. Many uncovered vases and bowls portray images of farmers harvesting crops and raising animals, as well as blacksmiths in the midst of working in a raging fire. Battle victories, as well as other accomplishments, were very popular subjects in funerary ceramics. 

As population and wealth flourished within the city, the use of bronze became more and more common. The people of Veii first used metal for horse harnesses, weapons, fans, jewelry, and mirrors.

===Burial practices===
The use of burial and cremation altered depending on the stability of the settlement. In the early years, most citizens were cremated. As affluence increased, individuals were freer to bury their loved ones close by in order to visit them regularly. Burial sites dating back to the 9th century BC have been uncovered. As inhumation became more and more popular, the sarcophagi became more and more intricate. Through the use of terracotta, local sculptors began using their talents to add adornments around the coffins, creating detailed accounts of the deceased&#x27;s life, as well as the deities that meant the most to them. Tombs were commonly decorated with sentimental objects, as well as items they may need in the afterlife. 

During times of war or economic difficulty, the use of cremation rose. Unlike their ancestors, however, the people of Veii continued the tradition of burial by keeping the urns of their loved ones in miniature tombs. Like the sarcophagi, the urns were made of terracotta and depicted varying scenes important to the diseased individual. Items were still placed in the small tombs; however, the value of the objects steadily dropped as times of financial crisis continued.

===Etruscan language===
Over 10,000 Etruscan written pieces are known. Varying examples of Etruscan script have been uncovered all over the ancient world.

==History==

===Early history===
The earliest evidence of occupation by demographic analysis, including that of the cemeteries, dates from the 10th century BC in the Late Bronze Age. Small settlements were scattered over a wider area than the plateau, and the population of the plateau at Veii is estimated to have been stable at about 1,000. In the 9th century BC, the Early Iron Age (Villanovan culture), the finds are localized to the plateau but appear to be associated with independent settlements, each with its own cemetery. Occupation gradually intensified in the 8th (remainder of Villanovan) and 7th (Orientalising period) centuries BC, by conurbation of the settlements as the site assumed an urban appearance with city blocks in a grid pattern arranged around a central square containing a water cistern. That evidence suggests that the city of Veii was shaped into its classical form in the 7th century BC by a population, presumably Etruscan, first settling there in the 10th century BC. During the settlement&#x27;s early years, many homes were built in spherical shapes out of wood over a shallow trench and topped with a thatched roof. Up until the 7th century BC Veii had to depend on itself for the majority of its resources and goods. Many artisans found work in the textile industry, creating intricate wool designs for clothes and blankets. Further supporting their self-sufficiency, many yarn spools and loom weights have been discovered in the area. 

The population of the early Veii practiced both inhumation and cremation within the same family. The proportion was 50% in the 9th century BC, after a predomination of cremation (90%) earlier. In the 8th century, inhumation rose to 70%, which may be attributable to an influence from Latium, where inhumation prevailed in the 9th century BC.

During the 9th and 8th centuries BC, the population density and grave goods were on the increase: more and wealthier people and also more of a disparity in wealth: the rise of a wealthier class. In the 8th century BC, both the potter&#x27;s wheel and writing were introduced from Greece. During the entire period, the settlements translocated around the plateau; however, a settlement (Casale del Fosso) maintained a cemetery to the north of the plateau continuously from the late 9th century BC to the early 6th century BC.

===Conflict with Rome===
The documented history of Veii, like that of all Italian cities in their early centuries, is sparse and unreliable.

According to Livy (writing 700 years later) the Fidenates and the Veientes were defeated in a war with Rome during the reign of Rome&#x27;s mythical first king, Romulus, in the 8th century BC.

Plutarch (writing even later in the 1st C. AD) says of them:The first (to oppose Romulus) were the Veientes, a people of Tuscany (the site is now in Lazio), who had large possessions, and dwelt in a spacious city; they took occasion to commence a war, by claiming Fidenae as belonging to them...

Fidenae and Veii were said to have again been defeated by Rome in the 7th century BC during the reign of Rome&#x27;s third king Tullus Hostilius.

In the 6th century BC Rome&#x27;s sixth king Servius Tullius warred against Veii (after the expiry of an earlier truce) and the Etruscans. He is said to have shown valour in the campaign, and to have routed a great army of the enemy. The war helped him to cement his position at Rome.

In 509 BC, after the overthrow of the Roman monarchy, the family of Tarquinius Superbus went into exile in Caere in Etruria. Tarquin sought to regain the throne, at first by the Tarquinian conspiracy and, when that failed, by force of arms. He convinced the cities of Tarquinii and Veii to support him, and led their armies against Rome in the Battle of Silva Arsia. The Roman army was victorious, and it is recorded by Livy that although the forces of Tarquinii fought well on the right wing, initially pushing back the Roman left wing, the Veientes on the left wing faltered and fled the battle, because they were accustomed to defeat at the hands of the Romans. After the loss of the battle the forces of Veii returned home. Livy writes that later in 509 BC, consul Publius Valerius Publicola returned to fight the Veientes.

In the 5th century BC, the Fabians, an aristocratic Roman family, moved into an Etruscan town just outside of Fidenae. Due to the sudden increase of wealth in the community, many Etruscan citizens began to worry about the impending fall of the economy. Soon, battles broke out on both sides, eventually leading to war. The sequence of events following the initial conflicts is widely considered to be a legend; it is said that the Veiian warriors murdered 300 Fabii, leaving all but one dead in order to incite fear in the rest of the community. 

The most famous king of Veii was Lars Tolumnus whose family was part of the Veientine aristocracy and who instigated a war with Rome in 438 BC. The nearby Roman colony of Fidenae revolted against Rome and allied itself with Veii, giving Tolumnus control of the Fidenate army. The Romans sent four envoys to demand an explanation but they were murdered. Rome declared war against Veii and sent Lucius Sergius with an army who won the battle of Fidenae but the Roman losses were so high that a state of emergency was declared. A subsequent fiercely-fought battle with Veii in 437 BC reinforced by a contingent from Falerii was indecisive until the tribune Aulus Cornelius Cossus unhorsed Tolumnus and killed him with his spear.

In 406 BC, Rome declared war against Veii, still powerful and well-fortified, and her allies Falerii and Capena which required the Romans to commence a siege lasting many years. As Plutarch says:

Veii had been the capital of Etruria, not inferior to Rome, either in number of arms or multitude of soldiers, so that relying on her wealth and luxury, and priding herself upon her refinement and sumptuousness, she had engaged in many honourable contests with the Romans for glory and empire ... as the city was furnished with all sorts of weapons, offensive and defensive, likewise with corn and all manner of provisions, they cheerfully endured a siege

After ten years, in 396 BC, the Romans appointed Camillus as &quot;dictator&quot;. After defeating both Falerii and Capena at Nepete, Camillus commanded the final strike against Veii (Battle of Veii). He dug into the soft tuff rock below the walls whilst distracting the Veiians with attacks on the walls and infiltrated the city&#x27;s drainage system to emerge in the citadel, leading to their defeat. Not interested in surrender but only in Veii&#x27;s complete destruction, the Romans slaughtered the entire adult male population and made slaves of all the women and children. The plunder was very rich and extensive including the statue of Juno taken to Rome.

Camillus supported the patricians in opposing the plebeian plan to populate Veii with half of the city of Rome designed to resolve poverty and space issues. Camillus deliberately protracted the project until its abandonment.

===Roman and later history===

The city was soon assimilated under Roman control and is termed &quot;Roman Veii&quot; as opposed to &quot;Etruscan Veii&quot; by scholarly literature. Under the empire the Romans called the city the &quot;Municipium Augustum Veiens&quot;. The city never recovered its former wealth or its population after the Roman conquest. Nevertheless, after Rome&#x27;s defeat in the battle of the Allia, many Roman soldiers fled there, and a project was proposed for abandoning Rome for Veii; this project was successfully opposed by Camillus.

The Romans built wealthy villas in the region and Livia had an estate there, according to Suetonius.

Veii was eventually abandoned after Roman times, and everything of value or utility was removed by anyone with access to the site. Finally it was filled and smoothed for ploughland and was forgotten until its rediscovery in the 17th century by the antiquarian Raffaello Fabretti.

===Ager Veientanus===
The territory of a city-state anywhere within the Roman domain was, in Roman legal terminology, an &quot;ager&quot;. The law made a number of fine distinctions, but by &quot;ager&quot; it meant primarily &quot;ager publicus&quot;, &quot;public territory&quot;, the land belonging to the state, which in those times was primarily agricultural (&quot;ager&quot; is &quot;field&quot;). 
The &quot;ager Veientanus&quot; (i.e. of Veii) covered the entire region between the right bank of the lower Tiber river and the coast; that is all of southern Etruria. The northwest border was probably as far west as the Monti Sabatini and Lake Bracciano in the north. 
In Etruscan times the &quot;ager Veiantanus&quot; shared the countryside with the &quot;Silva Ciminia&quot;, the remnant of an ancient forest, of which the Romans stood in superstitious dread.

The &quot;ager Veiantanus&quot; remained for the most part agrarian until it became evident after World War II that the city of Rome was going to expand into and develop that area as a suburb. Moreover, a new method of ploughing was turning over the soil a metre deep, destroying all surface evidence. John Bryan Ward-Perkins, then Director of the British School at Rome, set into motion the South Etruria Survey (1954–1968), which cataloged all the visible antiquities in the &quot;ager Veientanus&quot;. It was published in 1968.

Nearly 30 years later, in 1997, the Italian government moved to protect a part of that area, creating the Veio Regional Natural Park of between the Via Cassia on the west, the Via Flaminia on the east, the Via Campagnanese on the north and the city of Rome on the south. Within the park are the comuni of Campagnano di Roma, Castelnuovo di Porto, Formello, Magliano Romano, Mazzano Romano, Morlupo, Riano, Sacrofano and Municipio XX of the city of Rome.

<doc id="72839" wikidata="Q178841" url="?curid=72839" title="Foucault pendulum">
<text>The Foucault pendulum or Foucault&#x27;s pendulum is a simple device named after French physicist Léon Foucault, conceived as an experiment to demonstrate the Earth&#x27;s rotation. If a long and heavy pendulum suspended from the high roof above a circular area is monitored over an extended period of time, its plane of oscillation appears to change spontaneously as the Earth makes its 24-hourly rotation.

The pendulum was introduced in 1851 and was the first experiment to give simple, direct evidence of the Earth&#x27;s rotation. Foucault followed up in 1852 with a gyroscope experiment to further demonstrate the Earth&#x27;s rotation. Foucault pendulums today are popular displays in science museums and universities.

== History ==

Foucault was inspired by observing a thin flexible rod on the axis of a lathe, which vibrated in the same plane despite the rotation of the supporting frame of the lathe. 

The first public exhibition of a Foucault pendulum took place in February 1851 in the Meridian of the Paris Observatory. A few weeks later, Foucault made his most famous pendulum when he suspended a brass-coated lead bob with a wire from the dome of the Panthéon, Paris. 

Because the latitude of its location was formula_1, the plane of the pendulum&#x27;s swing made a full circle in approximately formula_2, rotating clockwise approximately 11.3° per hour. The proper period of the pendulum was approximately formula_3, so with each oscillation, the pendulum rotates by about formula_4. Foucault reported observing 2.3 mm of deflection on the edge of a pendulum every oscillation, which is achieved if the pendulum swing angle is 2.1°.

Foucault explained his results in an 1851 paper entitled &quot;Physical demonstration of the Earth&#x27;s rotational movement by means of the pendulum&quot;, published in the &quot;Comptes rendus de l&#x27;Académie des Sciences&quot;. He wrote that, at the North Pole:
...an oscillatory movement of the pendulum mass follows an arc of a circle whose plane is well known, and to which the inertia of matter ensures an unchanging position in space. If these oscillations continue for a certain time, the movement of the earth, which continues to rotate from west to east, will become sensitive in contrast to the immobility of the oscillation plane whose trace on the ground will seem animated by a movement consistent with the apparent movement of the celestial sphere; and if the oscillations could be perpetuated for twenty-four hours, the trace of their plane would then execute an entire revolution around the vertical projection of the point of suspension.

The original bob used in 1851 at the Panthéon was moved in 1855 to the Conservatoire des Arts et Métiers in Paris. A second temporary installation was made for the 50th anniversary in 1902.

During museum reconstruction in the 1990s, the original pendulum was temporarily displayed at the Panthéon (1995), but was later returned to the Musée des Arts et Métiers before it reopened in 2000. On April 6, 2010, the cable suspending the bob in the Musée des Arts et Métiers snapped, causing irreparable damage to the pendulum bob and to the marble flooring of the museum. The original, now damaged pendulum bob is displayed in a separate case adjacent to the current pendulum display.

An exact copy of the original pendulum has been operating under the dome of the Panthéon, Paris since 1995.

== Mechanism ==
At either the Geographic North Pole or Geographic South Pole, the plane of oscillation of a pendulum remains fixed relative to the distant masses of the universe while Earth rotates underneath it, taking one sidereal day to complete a rotation. So, relative to Earth, the plane of oscillation of a pendulum at the North Pole (viewed from above) undergoes a full clockwise rotation during one day; a pendulum at the South Pole rotates counterclockwise.

When a Foucault pendulum is suspended at the equator, the plane of oscillation remains fixed relative to Earth. At other latitudes, the plane of oscillation precesses relative to Earth, but more slowly than at the pole; the angular speed, (measured in clockwise degrees per sidereal day), is proportional to the sine of the latitude, :

formula_5

where latitudes north and south of the equator are defined as positive and negative, respectively. A &quot;pendulum day&quot; is the time needed for the plane of a freely suspended Foucault pendulum to complete an apparent rotation about the local vertical. This is one sidereal day divided by the sine of the latitude. For example, a Foucault pendulum at 30° south latitude, viewed from above by an earthbound observer, rotates counterclockwise 360° in two days.

Using enough wire length, the described circle can be wide enough that the tangential displacement along the measuring circle of between two oscillations can be visible by eye, rendering the Foucault pendulum a spectacular experiment: for example, the original Foucault pendulum in Panthéon moves circularly, with a 6-metre pendulum amplitude, by about 5 mm each period.

A Foucault pendulum requires care to set up because imprecise construction can cause additional veering which masks the terrestrial effect. Heike Kamerlingh Onnes (Nobel laureate 1913) performed precise experiments and developed a fuller theory of the Foucault pendulum for his doctoral thesis (1879). He observed the pendulum to go over from linear to elliptic oscillation in an hour. By a perturbation analysis, he showed that geometrical imperfection of the system or elasticity of the support wire may cause a beat between two horizontal modes of oscillation. The initial launch of the pendulum is also critical; the traditional way to do this is to use a flame to burn through a thread which temporarily holds the bob in its starting position, thus avoiding unwanted sideways motion (see a detail of the launch at the 50th anniversary in 1902).

Notably, veering of a pendulum was observed already in 1661 by Vincenzo Viviani, a disciple of Galileo, but there is no evidence that he connected the effect with the Earth&#x27;s rotation; rather, he regarded it as a nuisance in his study that should be overcome with suspending the bob on two ropes instead of one.

Air resistance damps the oscillation, so some Foucault pendulums in museums incorporate an electromagnetic or other drive to keep the bob swinging; others are restarted regularly, sometimes with a launching ceremony as an added attraction. Besides air resistance (the use of a heavy symmetrical bob is to reduce friction forces, mainly air resistance by a symmetrical and aerodynamic bob) the other main engineering problem in creating a 1-meter Foucault pendulum nowadays is said to be ensuring there is no preferred direction of swing.

==Related physical systems==

Many physical systems precess in a similar manner to a Foucault pendulum. As early as 1836, the Scottish mathematician Edward Sang contrived and explained the precession of a spinning top. In 1851, Charles Wheatstone described an apparatus that consists of a vibrating spring that is mounted on top of a disk so that it makes a fixed angle with the disk. The spring is struck so that it oscillates in a plane. When the disk is turned, the plane of oscillation changes just like the one of a Foucault pendulum at latitude .

Similarly, consider a nonspinning, perfectly balanced bicycle wheel mounted on a disk so that its axis of rotation makes an angle with the disk. When the disk undergoes a full clockwise revolution, the bicycle wheel will not return to its original position, but will have undergone a net rotation of .

Foucault-like precession is observed in a virtual system wherein a massless particle is constrained to remain on a rotating plane that is inclined with respect to the axis of rotation.

Spin of a relativistic particle moving in a circular orbit precesses similar to the swing plane of Foucault pendulum. The relativistic velocity space in Minkowski spacetime can be treated as a sphere &quot;S&quot;3 in 4-dimensional Euclidean space with imaginary radius and imaginary timelike coordinate. Parallel transport of polarization vectors along such sphere gives rise to Thomas precession, which is analogous to the rotation of the swing plane of Foucault pendulum due to parallel transport along a sphere &quot;S&quot;2 in 3-dimensional Euclidean space.

In physics, the evolution of such systems is determined by geometric phases. Mathematically they are understood through parallel transport.

== Absolute reference frame for pendulum ==

The motion of a pendulum, such as the Foucault pendulum, is typically analyzed relative to an Inertial frame of reference, approximated by the &quot;fixed stars.&quot;
These stars, owing to their immense distance from Earth, exhibit negligible motion relative to one another over short timescales, making them a practical benchmark for physical calculations. While fixed stars are sufficient for physical analyses, the concept of an absolute reference frame introduces philosophical and theoretical considerations.

Newtonian absolute space
* Isaac Newton proposed the existence of &quot;absolute space,&quot; a universal, immovable reference frame independent of any material objects. In his &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot;, Newton described absolute space as the backdrop against which true motion occurs.
* This concept was criticized by later thinkers, such as Ernst Mach, who argued that motion should only be defined relative to other masses in the universe.

Cosmic microwave background (CMB)
* The CMB, the remnant radiation from the Big Bang, provides a universal reference for cosmological observations. By measuring motion relative to the CMB, scientists can determine the velocity of celestial bodies, including Earth, relative to the universe&#x27;s early state. This has led some to consider the CMB a modern analogue of an absolute reference frame.

Mach&#x27;s principle and distant masses
* Ernst Mach proposed that inertia arises from the interaction of an object with the distant masses in the universe. According to this view, the pendulum&#x27;s frame of reference might be defined by the distribution of all matter in the cosmos, rather than an abstract absolute space.
* The &quot;distant masses of the universe&quot; play a crucial role in defining the inertial frame, suggesting that the pendulum&#x27;s apparent motion might be influenced by the collective gravitational effect of these masses. This perspective aligns with Mach’s principle, emphasizing the interconnectedness of local and cosmic phenomena.
* However, the connection between Mach&#x27;s principle and Einstein&#x27;s general relativity remains unresolved. Einstein initially hoped to incorporate Mach&#x27;s ideas but later acknowledged difficulties in doing so.

General relativity and spacetime
* General relativity suggests that spacetime itself can serve as a reference frame. The pendulum’s motion might be understood as relative to the curvature of spacetime, which is influenced by nearby and distant masses. This view aligns with the concept of geodesics in curved spacetime.
* The Lense-Thirring effect, a prediction of general relativity, implies that massive rotating objects like Earth can slightly &quot;drag&quot; spacetime, which could affect the pendulum’s oscillation. This effect, though theoretically significant, is currently too small to measure with a Foucault pendulum.

== Equation formulation for the Foucault pendulum ==
To model the Foucault pendulum, we consider a pendulum of length &quot;L&quot; and mass &quot;m&quot;, oscillating with small amplitudes. In a reference frame rotating with Earth at angular velocity Ω, the Coriolis force must be included. The equations of motion in the horizontal plane (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) are:

:formula_6

where:
* formula_7 is the natural angular frequency of the pendulum,
* formula_8 is the latitude,
* formula_9 is the acceleration due to gravity.

These coupled differential equations describe the pendulum&#x27;s motion, incorporating the Coriolis effect due to Earth&#x27;s rotation.

=== Precession rate calculation ===
The precession rate of the pendulum’s oscillation plane depends on latitude. The angular precession rate formula_10 is given by:

:formula_11

where formula_12 is Earth&#x27;s angular rotation rate (approximately formula_13 radians per second).

=== Examples of precession periods ===

The time formula_14 for a full rotation of the pendulum’s plane is:

:formula_15

Calculations for specific locations:

* Paris, France (latitude formula_16):
:formula_17

* New York City, USA (latitude formula_18):
:formula_19

These calculations show that the pendulum&#x27;s precession period varies with latitude, completing a full rotation more quickly at higher latitudes.

== Installations ==
There are numerous Foucault pendulums at universities, science museums, and the like throughout the world. The United Nations General Assembly Building at the United Nations headquarters in New York City has one. The Oregon Convention Center pendulum is claimed to be the largest, its length approximately , however, there are larger ones listed in the article, such as the one in Gamow Tower at the University of Colorado of . There used to be much longer pendulums, such as the pendulum in Saint Isaac&#x27;s Cathedral, Saint Petersburg, Russia.

The experiment has also been carried out at the South Pole, where it was assumed that the rotation of the Earth would have maximum effect. A pendulum was installed in a six-story staircase of a new station under construction at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station. It had a length of and the bob weighed . The location was ideal: no moving air could disturb the pendulum. The researchers confirmed about 24 hours as the rotation period of the plane of oscillation.

<text>The Antofagasta Region (, ) is one of Chile&#x27;s sixteen first-order administrative divisions. Being the second-largest region of Chile in area, it comprises three provinces, Antofagasta, El Loa and Tocopilla. It is bordered to the north by Tarapacá, by Atacama to the south, and to the east by Bolivia and Argentina. The region&#x27;s capital is the port city of Antofagasta; another one of its important cities is Calama. The region&#x27;s main economic activity is copper mining in its giant inland porphyry copper systems.

Antofagasta&#x27;s climate is extremely arid, albeit somewhat milder near the coast. Nearly all of the region is devoid of vegetation, except close to the Loa River and at oases such as San Pedro de Atacama. Much of the inland is covered by salt flats, tephra and lava flows, and the coast exhibits prominent cliffs.

The region was sparsely populated by indigenous Changos and Atacameños until massive Chilean immigration in conjunction with a saltpeter boom in the later 19th century. Most of the region was organised as Bolivia&#x27;s only coastal territory until Chilean takeover in 1879 at the onset of the War of the Pacific.

==History==

Antofagasta&#x27;s history is divided, as the territory itself, into two sections: the coastal region, and the highlands plateau or altiplano around the Andes. In pre-Columbian times, the coastline was populated by nomadic fishing clans of Changos Indians, of which very little is known due to very limited contact with the Spanish conquerors.

The inland section was populated by the Atacaman culture around the great dry salt lake Salar de Atacama, the Loa River basin, and valleys and oases across the altiplano, with the most important settlement being the village of San Pedro de Atacama.

The Atacaman culture was deeply influenced by Tiwanaku culture and later fell under Inca rule. The Atacamans harvested mainly corn and beans and developed trade as far as the Amazon basin and Pacific shores. The arrival of the Spaniards in the 16th century did not destroy the culture but transformed it deeply through the process of mestizaje, in which both cultures mixed. Under Spanish rule, Atacaman territory was placed under the administration of the Audiencia Real de Charcas, though it is disputed whether the Audiencia Real de Charcas was to administer only the inland portion or the coast as well. At the time of independence general Simón Bolívar integrated it into the new Republic of Bolivia, under the name of &quot;Litoral Department&quot;. This decision was disputed by the Chilean Government and has been a source of conflict until present times. Chile claimed that according to the Uti possidetis of the Spanish crown, the coastal region belong to them and their territory bordered directly with Peru.

Chilean explorers such as Juan López and José Santos Ossa discovered rich nitrate and guano deposits which produced a massive Chilean colonization of the coastline. Friction between the new settlers from both countries grew until 1879 when the War of the Pacific erupted. Antofagasta was permanently annexed by the Chilean government at the end of the war.

Colonization by Chileans followed mainly from Norte Chico (the contemporary regions of Atacama and Coquimbo, also known as the III and IV regions), into the new territories of Antofagasta and Tarapacá, known as Norte Grande.

In the early 20th century the region became a significant base of Chile&#x27;s union-organizing movements. It continued to depend economically on the nitrate-extraction industry until its replacement by copper mining. Two of the largest and richest open pit mines in the world are located inland from Antofagasta: La Escondida and Chuquicamata.

==Administration==
Each province in the region is further subdivided into communes.

==Geography==

The main river is the Loa.

Along the Coastal Cordillera lies Atacama Fault. The area of the Coastal Cordillera around the fault is rich in iron ore constituting the northern part of the so-called Chilean Iron Belt. These ore deposits are often of the manto-type deposits and are chiefly emplaced on rocks of La Negra Formation.

==Climate==

The average rainfall in the Antofagasta is just per year. From the coast, east to the Chilean Coast Range, is the south-central part of the Atacama Desert, the driest desert in the world. Further to the east, it is part of the less arid Central Andean dry puna ecoregion. The surroundings of abandoned Yungay town have been named the driest place in the world.

==Demography==
Most of the population lives on the coast in Antofagasta and Mejillones, or in Calama in the interior, the hub of the mining industry and the home of a large part of its work force.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, immigrant settlers also arrived from Europe (mainly Croatians, Italians, Spaniards, Greeks, English, French, and Portuguese peoples), from the Levant, and in smaller numbers from China, Japan, Korea, Peru and Bolivia. Various immigration flows joined with the culture of the altiplano region creating the modern culture of the north of Chile, which arguably presents more Andean- and multi-European-features than the Central Valley and mainstream Chilean culture. 

==Economy==

The Antofagasta Region is the heart of the mining industry, Chile&#x27;s main source of export revenue. It represents 53% of Chile&#x27;s mining output, led by copper and followed by potassium nitrate, gold, iodine, and lithium, which means it could have had GDP per capita higher than Luxembourg had it had a large degree of autonomy. The mining industry regularly accounts for more than 90% of the region&#x27;s exports.

Fishing and manufacturing also contribute to the income of the area.

The availability of infrastructure and services, due to the region&#x27;s mining boom, together with its abundance of beautiful natural scenery, have opened vast prospects for the travel industry, both in the interior and on the coast. Interesting tourist attractions include the small town of San Pedro de Atacama, once the center of the Atacameño culture, Atacama Salt Flat, the Valley of the Moon, the Quitor Pukará, the Puritama hot springs and the numerous astronomical observatories including the Very Large Telescope and ALMA.

<text>The Atacama Region (, ) is one of Chile&#x27;s 16 first order administrative divisions. It comprises three provinces: Chañaral, Copiapó and Huasco. It is bordered to the north by Antofagasta, to the south by Coquimbo, to the east by the provinces of Catamarca, La Rioja and San Juan of Argentina, and to the west by the Pacific Ocean. The regional capital Copiapó is located north of the country&#x27;s capital of Santiago. The region occupies the southern portion of the Atacama Desert, the rest of the desert is mainly distributed among the other regions of Norte Grande.

==Demography==
The Atacama Region is the third least populated region of the country, after Aisén and Magallanes. Of its total population, over 50% are located in the cities of Copiapó and Vallenar.

The largest cities are (2002 census data) Copiapó (125,983 inhabitants), Vallenar (43,750), Caldera (12,776), Chañaral (12,086), El Salvador (8,697) Tierra Amarilla (8,578), and Diego de Almagro (7,951).

==History==
The original inhabitants of this area were the Diaguitas and Changos.

The region experienced a boom when the Chañarcillo silver mine was discovered in 1832.

==Natural features==
Much of the region is desert, and encompasses considerable mineral resources. Numerous flora and fauna species are found in the Atacama Region. One subspecies of the lesser rhea, known by the scientific name &quot;Rhea pennata tarapacensis&quot;, is a notable large terrestrial bird in this region, which subspecies is considered endangered. The diminished numbers of this bird are due to prehistoric and modern hunting but more significantly due to agricultural land conversion in order to feed the expanding human population.
==Economy==

Mining accounts for 45% of the region&#x27;s GDP and 90% of its exports. Moreover, various geological surveys have identified new deposits.
Iron ore mining is the most dynamic activity and there are numerous small-scale mines, which sell their output to ENAMI (the national mining company) for processing at its Paipote smelter. The region&#x27;s main copper deposit is Candelaria, which produces around 200,000 tonnes per year and is controlled by Phelps Dodge, an international corporation. The next in size is El Salvador, owned by CODELCO, with an annual output of around 81,000 tonnes. Both mines export through the port of Chañaral.
Over recent decades, fresh fruit also emerged as regional export item, when the Copiapó and Huasco valleys joined Chile’s fruit-growing boom. They enjoy a comparative advantage because, thanks to the sunny climate, fruit ripens earlier than in the rest of the country and reaches northern hemisphere markets first.
Grapes are the main crop and, on a smaller scale, olives, tomatoes, peppers, onions, broad beans, citrus fruits, nectarines, apricots, oregano, and flowers.
The region&#x27;s organic wealth, its clear waters and sheltered bays, together with its entrepreneurial experience, favor the development of aquaculture. Species produced include the northern scallop, Japanese and Chilean oysters, abalone, turbot, algae, and different varieties of mussels. Other products with more value added include boned fish fillets, smoked and salted fish, roe, and fishburgers.

The unique weather conditions in the Atacama Desert, with extremely rare cloudy days, are ideal for solar power generation. Many PV and CSP plants are being built in this area.

<text>Etruria ( ) was a region of Central Italy delimited by the rivers Arno and Tiber, an area that covered what is now most of Tuscany, northern Lazio, and north-western Umbria. It was inhabited by the Etruscans, an ancient civilization that flourished in the area from around the 8th century BC until they were assimilated into the Roman Republic in the 4th century BC.

==Etruscan Etruria==
The ancient people of Etruria
are identified as Etruscans. Their complex culture centered on numerous city-states that arose during the Villanovan period in the ninth century BC, and they were very powerful during the Orientalizing Archaic periods.

The Etruscans were a dominant culture in Italy by 650 BC, surpassing other ancient Italic peoples such as the Ligures. Their influence may be seen beyond Etruria&#x27;s confines in the Po River Valley and Latium, as well as in Campania and through their contact with the Greek colonies in Southern Italy (including Sicily). Indeed, at some Etruscan tombs, such as those of the Tumulus di Montefortini at Comeana (see Carmignano) in Tuscany, physical evidence of trade with Egypt has been found by archaeologists—fine Egyptian faience cups are an example. Such trade occurred either directly with Egypt or through intermediaries such as Greek or Phoenician sailors.

Rome was influenced strongly by the Etruscans even though it was separated from the early boundary of Etruria by the Silva Ciminia, the Ciminian Forest. A series of Etruscan kings ruled Rome until 509 BC when the last Etruscan king, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, was removed from power and the Roman Republic was established. The Etruscans are credited with influencing Roman architecture and ritual practice; it was under the Etruscan kings that important structures such as the Capitolium, Cloaca Maxima, and Via Sacra were realized.

The Etruscan civilization had a great influence on the culture of early Republican Rome, some of what later became the most symbolic traditions of the city. It also included the introduction of new foods, the Latin alphabet, the architecture, and engineering elements.

==Territorial subdivision of Etruria==
Etruria usually is divided into two main territories, called Northern Etruria and Southern Etruria, to which must be added the northernmost territories are called Etruria Padana, and the southernmost territories are called Etruria Campana.
; Etruria (proper):
* Northern Etruria - much of modern Tuscany, from the Arno river to the north, the Apennines to the east, and the Albegna river to the south of Tuscany; 
* Inner Etruria - the Etruscan territories in the Perugia area in modern western Umbria
* Southern Etruria - small portions of the most southern areas of Tuscany, all of northern and central Lazio to the gates of Rome
; Etruscan colonies:

* Etruria Padana (Padanian Etruria) - territories in Emilia-Romagna and in the southern extremity of Lombardy and Veneto, in northern Italy
* Etruria Campana (Campanian Etruria) - territories in southern Lazio and Campania, in southern Italy

==Cities of Etruria==
Latin and Italian names are given between parentheses:
* Arritim (Arretium, Arezzo)
* Atria (Adria)
* Caisra (Caere, Cerveteri)
* Clevsin (Clusium, Chiusi)
* Curtun (Cortonium, Cortona)
* Felathri (Volaterrae, Volterra)
* Fufluna (Populonium, Populonia)
* Parusia (Perusia, Perugia)
* Tarchna (Volscian Anxur) (Tarracina, Terracina)
* Tarchnal (Tarquinii, Tarquinia)
* Veii (Veii, Veio)
* Vetluna (Vetulonium, Vetulonia)
* Vipsul (Faesulae, Fiesole)
* Velch (Vulci, Volci)
* Velzna (Volsiniia, Volsinii)

There was a period between 600 BC and 500 BC, during which twelve Etruscan city-states formed a loose confederation known as the Etruscan League. Etruscan was the official language for their meetings. When Etruria was conquered by the Roman Republic, Latin became the official language.

==Roman Etruria==
In the Augustan organization of Roman Italy, &quot;Etruria&quot; was the name of a region (Regio VII). Its borders were the Tiber, the Tyrrhenian Sea, the Apuan Alps, and the Apennines. This is roughly coincident with those of Etruria before the Roman period that began in 509 BC.

==Etruria in modern history==
The Grand Duchy of Tuscany (which existed 1569–1801 and 1814–1859) styled itself in Latin as &quot;Magnus Ducatus Etruriae&quot; (Grand Duchy of Etruria). The name Etruria also was applied to the Kingdom of Etruria, an ephemeral client state of Napoleon I of France that replaced the Grand Duchy between 1801 and 1807.

A particularly noteworthy work dealing with Etruscan locations is D. H. Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;Sketches of Etruscan Places and Other Italian Essays&quot;.

<doc id="72847" wikidata="Q2121" url="?curid=72847" title="Coquimbo Region">
<text>The Coquimbo Region (, ) is one of Chile&#x27;s 16 administrative regions. It is located approximately north of the national capital, Santiago. The region is bordered by the Atacama Region to the north, the Valparaíso Region to the south, Argentina to the east, and the Pacific Ocean to the west.

The capital and largest city is La Serena. Other significant cities include Coquimbo, a major seaport, and Ovalle, a center for agriculture.

==Geography and ecology==

The Coquimbo Region forms the narrowest part of Chile and is one of the most mountainous areas in the country, as the Andes range lies closer to the sea here than in other regions. The region is home to diverse marine and terrestrial species. Upwelling along the coast fosters high marine productivity, contributing to a rich ecosystem.

In the southern mountainous areas, the endangered Chilean Wine Palm (&quot;Jubaea chilensis&quot;) can be found. Its habitat is under threat from human activities, such as population growth and deforestation for agriculture and urban expansion.

The Elqui Valley, known for its clear skies, is home to numerous astronomical observatories. Additionally, the Puclaro Dam, a 640-meter-long structure, contains a reservoir that holds 4.63 million cubic meters of water for agricultural irrigation along the Elqui River.

==Demography==
Mining and agriculture have shaped the distribution of settlements in the Coquimbo Region, particularly around transverse valleys and mineral deposits. Historically, these settlements corresponded to the locations of Diaguita indigenous villages. A significant portion of the population, around 70-75%, is of Mestizo (Euro-Amerindian) descent, the highest percentage in Chile. Other indigenous groups present in the region include the Aymara, Atacameño, Mapuche, and Quechua, many of whom migrated from Peru and Bolivia.

The La Serena-Coquimbo conurbation, with an estimated population of around 300,000 people (297,253 as of the last census), accounts for about half of the region&#x27;s total population. Other major urban centers include Ovalle (66,405), Illapel (21,826), Vicuña (12,910), Salamanca (11,615), and Los Vilos (10,966), based on data from the 2002 census.

==Economy==
The Coquimbo Region is a popular tourist destination, known for its long, white-sand beaches and mild climate. The region&#x27;s economy is also supported by agriculture and fishing. Additionally, its mountainous terrain makes it a key location for astronomical research.

==Media and communications==
The first newspaper in the region, &quot;El Minero de Coquimbo&quot;, was published in 1828. Today, the region is served by several local newspapers, including &quot;El Día&quot; in La Serena, founded in 1944, &quot;La Región&quot; in Coquimbo, founded in 2004, and &quot;El Ovallino&quot;, founded in 1989 in Ovalle.

TVN Red Coquimbo, a regional affiliate of Televisión Nacional de Chile (TVN), began broadcasting in 1993. Several local cable and UHF television channels, such as CuartaVisión and Ovalle TV, offer regional programming that includes news, sports, and cultural content. However, several regional stations have ceased operations, including Telenorte and Canal 8 UCV TV, which broadcast until 2001 and 2002, respectively.

==Notable people==
The Coquimbo Region is the birthplace of several notable figures, including:

* Gabriela Mistral, the Nobel Laureate poet, who was born in Vicuña, a town in the Elqui Valley known for pisco production.
* Hermann Niemeyer, a pediatrician and biochemist born in Ovalle in 1918, who played a key role in the development of biochemistry in Chile.

<text>The Valparaíso Region (, ) is one of Chile&#x27;s 16 first order administrative divisions. With the country&#x27;s second-highest population of 1,790,219 , and fourth-smallest area of , the region is Chile&#x27;s second most densely populated after the Santiago Metropolitan Region to the southeast. The region also includes Chile&#x27;s remote islands of the Pacific Ocean, including Rapa Nui and the Juan Fernandez Islands.

Its capital is the port city of Valparaíso; other important cities include Viña del Mar, Quillota, San Felipe, Quilpué, Villa Alemana, and San Antonio.

== Administration ==
As a region, Valparaíso is a first-level administrative division. Since 2021, the region is governed by the governor, who is elected by popular vote. The current governor is Rodrigo Mundaca (Broad Front).

==Geography and natural features==

The region is on the same latitude as the Santiago Metropolitan Region. Its capital is Valparaíso, which is the site for the National Congress of Chile and an important commercial port. Also in this region is the top resort city of Viña del Mar. Additionally, the Pacific islands of Easter Island, Isla Salas y Gómez, the Juan Fernández Islands and the Desventuradas Islands fall under the Valparaíso Region&#x27;s administration.

The Valparaíso Region is part of the very restricted range of the endangered Chilean wine palm (&quot;Jubaea chilensis&quot;); in prehistoric times, this endemic Chilean tree had a significantly larger range.

==Demographics==
The Valparaíso Region is populated by 1.71 million inhabitants. The population density reached 94.1 inhabitants/km2. 91.6% of the population lives in urban areas and only 8.4% of the population lives in rural areas.

The most populous municipalities in the region are Valparaíso, with 308,000 inhabitants and Viña del Mar, with 287,000 inhabitants, which together with Villa Alemana, Quilpué and Concón form the Greater Valparaíso, a continuum of 1.75 million people. There are also Quillota, with about 201,000 inhabitants and San Antonio with more than 200,000 inhabitants with estimates at 250,000 to be the region&#x27;s second-largest city. 

===Immigration and culture===



Valparaíso developed as a trans-oceanic rest stop for fishing ships, sea cruise-liners, and international naval ships. Therefore, a large proportion of residents have a variety of national origins, ethnic groups, and cultures. The 16th-century colonial population was founded by male settlers from the Spanish regions of Andalusia, Asturia and León, and the large Basque contingent has given rise to a substantial Basque Chilean population. Large numbers came from other countries of Latin America from Mexico to Uruguay, esp. came during colonial rule in the 17th century. And in the late 18th–early 19th centuries came a small wave of Galician settlers from the Spanish region of Galicia.

It is thought the majority of Valparaíso&#x27;s people have some non-Spanish European background, such as: British and Irish, Australians and New Zealanders, North Americans (U.S. or Canadian), Croats and Bosnians, Dutch and Belgians, French, Germans, Greeks, Italians, Portuguese and Scandinavians. Also, there are more or less assimilated groups of Chilean Jews (mostly Ashkenazi), as well as Christians from the Ottoman Empire, primarily Syro-Lebanese and a large Palestinian community in the town of La Calera.

In racial terms, the majority of Valparaíso&#x27;s inhabitants are castizos, meaning that their paternal origins are overwhelmingly from white whalers, settlers and traders of various European nationalities, including colonial Spanish settlers, while their maternal origins usually stems from unions between colonial Spanish men and local indigenous women, including those of Mapuche, Inca, Aymara and North American Indian descent (transplanted Cherokees are reported to come in the late 19th century, though it could well be a myth). Smaller numbers of East Asians, mostly Chinese, Japanese or Korean, minuscule numbers of Afro-Chileans, as well as a component of Polynesians whose ancestors were kidnapped from Easter Island and the Marquesas Islands, further added to the region&#x27;s Hispanicized melting pot.

==Economics and industry==
The Valparaíso Region is a host of agricultural lands, wine producers, and industrial activity such as copper mining and cement. Chile&#x27;s largest oil refinery is located in Concón (on the mouth of the Aconcagua River and about north of Valparaíso) and there are two important copper ore refineries: the state-owned Ventanas (on the coast and north of Concón) and the private works in Chagres, about inland.

The region also is a hub for chemicals and gas storage near the port of Quintero. In the interior valleys, there is a booming export industry, mainly around the avocado (palta), chirimoyas and flowers. The most striking recent development has been the cultivation of hillsides using high-tech drip feed irrigation. This has allowed otherwise dry and unproductive land to bear high yields.

<text>The Miami Heat are an American professional basketball team based in Miami. The Heat compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Southeast Division of the Eastern Conference. The team plays its home games at Kaseya Center, and has won three NBA championships.

The franchise began play in the 1988–89 season as an expansion team. After a period of mediocrity, the Heat gained relevance in the mid-1990s when Pat Riley became team president and head coach. Riley constructed the trades for Alonzo Mourning and Tim Hardaway, which propelled the team into playoff contention. Mourning and Hardaway led the Heat to four consecutive division titles prior to their departures in 2001 and 2002, respectively. The team also experienced success after drafting Dwyane Wade in 2003.

Led by Wade, following a trade for former NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, the Heat won their first NBA title in 2006, after Riley named himself head coach for a second stint. After the departure of O&#x27;Neal two years later, the team struggled for the remainder of the 2000s. Riley remained team president, but was replaced as head coach by Erik Spoelstra. In 2010, the Heat formed a superteam through the signing of reigning league MVP LeBron James and NBA All-Star Chris Bosh, creating the &quot;Big Three&quot; along with Wade. During their four years together, Spoelstra, James, Wade, and Bosh led the Heat to the NBA Finals in every season, culminating in back-to-back championships in 2012 and 2013. All three departed by 2016, and the team entered a period of rebuilding. After acquiring All-Star Jimmy Butler in 2019, the Heat returned to the NBA Finals in 2020 and 2023. The Heat acquired six-time NBA All-Star Kyle Lowry in 2021.

The Heat hold the record for the NBA&#x27;s third-longest winning streak, 27 straight games, set during the 2012–13 season. Seven Hall of Famers have played for Miami, and James won two consecutive NBA MVP Awards while playing for the team.

==History==


===1987–1995: Early years in Miami===
In 1987, the NBA granted one of four new expansion teams to Miami (the others being the Orlando Magic, Charlotte Hornets, and the Minnesota Timberwolves); the team, known as the Heat, began play in November 1988. The Miami Heat began their early years with much mediocrity, only making the playoffs twice in their first eight years and falling in the first round both times.

Miami had previously been home to the Miami Floridians of the American Basketball Association (ABA) from 1968 to 1972.

===1995–2003: Title hopefuls===

Upon the purchasing of the franchise by Carnival Cruise Lines chairman Micky Arison in 1995, Pat Riley was brought in as the team president and head coach. Riley acquired center Alonzo Mourning and point guard Tim Hardaway to serve as the centerpieces for the team, transforming Miami into a championship contender throughout the late 1990s. With them they also brought in a new team trainer, Cody Posselt, to work on shooting. The Heat underwent a dramatic turnaround in the 1996–97 season, improving to a 61–21 record – a franchise record at the time, and currently second-best in team history. That same year, Miami earned the moniker of &quot;Road Warriors&quot; for its remarkable 32–9 record on the road. On the backs of Hardaway and Mourning, the Heat achieved their first two series victories in the playoffs, making it to the conference finals against the Michael Jordan-led Chicago Bulls before losing in five games. Their biggest rivals of the time were the New York Knicks, Riley&#x27;s former team, who would eliminate the Heat in the playoffs from 1998 through 2000. A period of mediocrity followed after, highlighted by missing the playoffs in 2002 and 2003.

===2003–2016: The Dwyane Wade era===
In the 2003 NBA draft, with the fifth overall pick, Miami selected shooting guard Dwyane Wade out of Marquette. Free-agent swing-man Lamar Odom was signed from the Los Angeles Clippers. Just prior to the start of the 2003–04 season, Riley stepped down as head coach to focus on rebuilding the Heat, promoting Stan Van Gundy to the position of head coach. Behind Van Gundy&#x27;s leadership, Wade&#x27;s stellar rookie year and Odom&#x27;s break out season, the Heat made the 2004 NBA playoffs, beating the New Orleans Hornets 4–3 in the first round and losing to the Indiana Pacers 4–2 in the second round. In the off-season, Riley engineered a summer blockbuster trade for Shaquille O&#x27;Neal from the Los Angeles Lakers. Alonzo Mourning returned to the Heat in the same season, serving as a backup to O&#x27;Neal. Returning as championship contenders, Miami finished with a 59–23 record, consequently garnering the first overall seed in the Eastern Conference. Sweeping through the first round and the semifinals, Miami went back to the conference finals for the first time in eight years, where it met the defending champion Detroit Pistons. Despite taking a 3–2 lead, Miami lost Wade to injury for Game 6. The Heat would go on to lose Game 7 at home despite Wade&#x27;s return.

====2005–2006: Championship season====

In the summer of 2005, Riley brought in veteran free agent Gary Payton from the Boston Celtics, and also brought in James Posey, Jason Williams and Antoine Walker via trades. After a disappointing 11–10 start to the 2005–06 season, Riley relieved Van Gundy of his duties and took back the head coaching job. The Heat made it to the conference finals in 2006 and in a re-match, defeated the Pistons, winning the series 4–2. Making its first NBA Finals appearance, they played the Dallas Mavericks, who won the first two games in Dallas in routs. The Heat then won the next four games, capturing its first-ever championship. Wade won the Finals MVP award.

====2006–2010: Post-championship struggles====
The Heat experienced four years of post-title struggles from 2007 through 2010, including a 4–0 sweep by the Chicago Bulls in the first round of the 2007 NBA playoffs. In the 2007–08 season, Wade was plagued by injuries and the Heat had a league-worst 15–67 record. O&#x27;Neal was traded to Phoenix midway through the season. Riley resigned as head coach following the season but retained his position as team president. Long-time assistant Erik Spoelstra was promoted to head coach. A healthy Wade led the Heat to 43 wins in 2009 and 47 wins in 2010, making the playoffs both seasons, though they lost in the first round, 4–3 in 2009 and 4–1 in 2010. Wade was the scoring champion in 2009 and the NBA All-Star MVP in 2010.

====2010–2014: The &quot;Big Three&quot; era====
Entering the 2010–11 season with nearly $48 million in salary cap space, the Heat caused a major power shift during the blockbuster 2010 free agency, adding Chris Bosh and LeBron James, starting the &quot;Big 3&quot; era. However, the Heat got off to a 9–8 start. After a &quot;players only&quot; meeting, the team improved. The Heat finished with a 58–24 record and the second seed. In the much anticipated 2011 NBA playoffs, Miami defeated the Philadelphia 76ers in the first round, Boston Celtics in the conference semifinals, and Bulls in the conference finals, all in 5 games. The Heat reached the 2011 NBA Finals for the first time since 2006, in a rematch against the Dallas Mavericks. After taking a 2–1 series lead, the Heat lost the final three games to the Mavericks.

After the second NBA lockout ended, the Heat signed veteran Shane Battier. In the shortened 2011–12 season, the Heat started 27–7. However they would struggle for the second half of the season, going 19–13. The Heat finished 46–20, earning the second seed in the East for the NBA playoffs. Entering the first round, they took a 3–0 lead against the New York Knicks but like their previous series with the Sixers, were not able to close them out in Game 4. A victory in Game 5 ultimately defeated New York and the Heat advanced to the second round versus the Indiana Pacers. After losing Game 2 at home and Game 3 at Indiana, many criticized Dwyane Wade&#x27;s lackluster performance in Game 3, bringing attention to the fact that he got into a verbal argument with Spoelstra. However, with Wade visiting his former college coach, the team defeated the Pacers in the next three games, to close out the Pacers. They met the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference finals, taking the first two games before losing the next three, including one home loss where Bosh returned from injury. On June 7 they won on the road at Boston beating the Celtics 98–79 to tie the series 3–3; James had 45 points and 15 rebounds. The deciding Game 7 was at Miami. The Celtics largely dominated during the first half. The second half saw several lead changes. The Heat eventually won 101–88, reaching the NBA Finals for the second straight year. In the much-anticipated match-up with the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Heat split the first two games, winning Game 2 on the road, before sweeping the next three at home. James was named the Finals MVP as he won his first NBA championship.

On July 11, 2012, the Heat officially signed veterans Ray Allen to a three-year contract and Rashard Lewis to a two-year contract. The Heat later posted a 27-game winning streak from February 3, 2013, and March 27, 2013. Defeating Orlando in the season finale set the franchise record for 66 wins in a season. By the end of the season, the Heat won 18 of its 19 road games, the best streak on the road to end a season in NBA history. The Heat went 17–1 in March, becoming the first team to win 17 games in a single calendar month. The Heat ended with a franchise-best and league-best 66–16 record to take the first seed in the 2013 NBA playoffs. They swept the Milwaukee Bucks in the first round and defeated Chicago in five games before winning against the Indiana Pacers in Game 7. Miami became the first Eastern Conference team to reach the NBA Finals in three straight years since the Chicago Bulls in the late 1990s. Miami lost Game 1 of the Finals on their home floor in a close game that was decided by a last-minute buzzer beater by Tony Parker. The Heat went on to win Game 2 with a 33–5 run in the second half. The two teams continued to trade wins leading up to Game 6 where the Spurs, up 10 heading in the fourth quarter, were in position to close out the series and win the championship. James went on to score 16 points in the period, outscoring the entire Spurs team by himself at one point. With 5.2 seconds remaining, Ray Allen scored a three-pointer to tie the game at 95–all and force overtime, where the Heat won the game 103–100. The Heat went on to defeat the Spurs 95–88 in Game 7 behind a 37-point and 12 rebounds performance from James and a 23-point and 10 rebound effort from Wade. Shane Battier also scored 18 points, making six three-pointers, after having a shooting slump during the postseason up to that point. The Heat captured the NBA title for a second year in a row, becoming the first team in the Eastern Conference to repeat as league champions since the late 1990s Chicago Bulls. James was named the NBA Finals MVP, becoming the fifth player to win the award back-to-back along with Michael Jordan, Hakeem Olajuwon, Shaquille O&#x27;Neal and Kobe Bryant, and only the second player in NBA history to win the Finals MVP and league MVP back-to-back along with Jordan.

Miami struggled throughout the 2013–14 season with extended absences of Dwyane Wade, who only played 54 games to injury and ended on an 11–14 record entering the playoffs. They entered the playoffs as the Eastern Conference second seed with a record of 54–28 team, and with the &quot;Big 3&quot; healthy. They went 12–3 in the first 3 rounds. They swept the Charlotte Bobcats. They then beat the Brooklyn Nets 4–1. They went on to play the first-seeded 56–26 Pacers in the conference finals, in a rematch of the previous year&#x27;s Conference finals. The Pacers were eliminated from the playoffs for a third consecutive year by the Heat. The Heat went to a fourth consecutive Finals, and faced the Spurs again. The first two games in San Antonio were split but the Heat fell to the Spurs 4–1, failing to repeat as champions for the third consecutive season.

====2014–2016: Post-&quot;Big Three&quot; and rebuild====
On July 11, 2014, LeBron James announced on &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; &#x27;s website that after opting out of the final year of his contract, he would leave the Heat and return to the Cleveland Cavaliers. Wade and Bosh stayed in Miami. Like the Cavaliers in the 2010 off-season, the Heat focused on how it would maintain itself without LeBron. Wade and Bosh were joined by returning players Mario Chalmers, Norris Cole, Udonis Haslem and Chris Andersen along with former rivals Luol Deng and Danny Granger. The Heat also drafted Shabazz Napier and James Ennis. In 2015, they also gained Goran Dragić and his younger brother Zoran Dragić.

After a season with several injuries, including to Chris Bosh and Josh McRoberts, the Heat finished with a 37–45 record, the NBA&#x27;s 10th-worst. They failed to make the playoffs after being Eastern Conference champions four straight years. It was the second time in Wade&#x27;s career they did not qualify for the postseason. The Heat were the first team since the 2004–05 Los Angeles Lakers to miss the playoffs after going to the NBA Finals the previous year. Miami had qualified for the playoffs for six consecutive seasons.

At the 2015 NBA draft lottery, the Heat were awarded the 10th pick for the 2015 NBA draft, which was used to select Duke forward Justise Winslow.

During the 2015–16 season, the Heat compiled a 48–34 regular season record; however, their season ended in the Conference semifinals where they lost to the Toronto Raptors. The 2016 free agency was marked with relationship issues and disagreements between Dwyane Wade and Heat president Pat Riley, mostly focusing on how much Wade would get paid.

===2016–2019: Departure and return of Wade===
On July 6, 2016, Wade announced that he was leaving the Heat to go join his hometown Chicago Bulls.

In September 2016, Bosh failed his physical exam with the Heat and was not cleared by the team to participate in training camp. On September 26, 2016, Heat president Riley said he viewed Bosh&#x27;s career with the team as over, noting that the team was no longer working toward his return. On July 4, 2017, the Heat waived Bosh a month after an NBA ruling declared his blood clotting issues a career-ending illness. Riley immediately announced that Bosh&#x27;s number would be retired in the future out of respect to him and his accomplishments with the Heat. With nearly all remnants of the Big Three era gone in just two seasons, Miami went 41–41 and missed the playoffs by virtue of a tiebreaker with the Chicago Bulls.

On February 8, 2018, the Cleveland Cavaliers traded Dwyane Wade back to Miami. Wade willed the Heat to a game two win against the Philadelphia 76ers in the first round of the 2018 playoffs, but the team would lose the series in five games. Wade retired after one last season with the Heat in 2018–19; Bosh and Wade&#x27;s jerseys were retired in March 2019 and February 2020, respectively.

===2019–2025: The Jimmy Butler era===

In 2019–20, Miami acquired All-Star Jimmy Butler, Andre Iguodala, and Jae Crowder, and drafted Kentucky shooting guard Tyler Herro. Following the suspension of the 2019–20 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Heat were one of 22 teams invited to participate in the NBA Bubble, completing the season behind closed doors in Orlando from July to October 2020. The fifth-seeded Heat went 12–3 in the bubble playoffs to win the franchise&#x27;s sixth conference championship in 15 seasons. They would meet LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA Finals, losing in six games.

After a historically short 72-day off-season, the Heat struggled to find consistency in the 2020–21 season, finishing as the sixth seed. They were swept in a first-round rematch with the eventual champion Milwaukee Bucks. The 2021 off-season saw the departures of Dragić and Iguodala, along with the acquisition of veteran Kyle Lowry and P.J. Tucker.

The Heat bounced back during the 2021–22 season, finishing at the top of the Eastern Conference for the first time since 2013. Miami defeated their first round opponents, the Atlanta Hawks, in five games, and then won against the Philadelphia 76ers 4–2 in the conference semifinals. The Heat faced off against the Boston Celtics in the conference finals, but fell short after Butler&#x27;s three-point shot to take the lead missed with 11 seconds remaining in Game 7.

The next season, the Heat finished the 2022–23 regular season as the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference, qualifying for the play-in tournament; however, they managed to clinch their division title. In the first play-in game, they lost to the Atlanta Hawks, who eventually clinched the seventh seed in the NBA playoffs. Despite this, the Heat managed to enter the playoffs as the eighth seed after defeating the Chicago Bulls in the final seeding game. They faced the Milwaukee Bucks in their third playoff meeting in four seasons, and eventually defeated them in five games, becoming the sixth team to eliminate a top-seeded team in the first round. They next defeated the New York Knicks and the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference Semifinals and the Eastern Conference Finals, respectively. Becoming just the second eighth seed to reach the NBA Finals, they faced the Denver Nuggets, losing in five games.

==Uniforms==

===1988–1999 uniforms===
Unveiled prior to the 1988–89 season, the original Miami Heat uniforms consist of simple striping, exclusive only on the right side of the jersey and shorts. The home uniforms were white with lettering in red, black and orange trim, while the away uniforms were black with red, white and orange trim; the numbers were white with red, black and orange trim, using the same font as the classic Los Angeles Lakers jerseys. The original &#x27;flaming ball&#x27; logo is on the left leg of the shorts while the word &#x27;Miami&#x27; is on the right leg.

In the 1995–96 season the Heat introduced a red alternate uniform with lettering and numbers in black, white and orange trim. The original set lasted until the 1998–99 season.

The original white and red uniforms were reintroduced as throwback uniforms during the Heat&#x27;s 20th and 25th anniversary seasons, respectively, while the original black uniforms were used as throwbacks in the 2013–14 season. The classic white uniforms were used again for the 2015–16 season.

As part of Nike&#x27;s uniform contract with the NBA, the so-called &quot;Classic&quot; edition was introduced and featured modernized throwback uniform designs from past years. During the 2017–18 season, the Heat were one of eight teams who participated in this line and wore their black 1988–99 uniforms, updated to the current Nike uniform cut. In the 2022–23 season, the Heat wore a white version of the uniforms from the same era.

===1999–present uniforms===
The current Heat uniforms have been in use since the 1999–2000 season. These uniforms, though similar, have marked differences such as striping on both sides, change from orange to yellow trim, updated lettering and block numbers, and a modified &#x27;flaming ball&#x27; logo on the right leg. The black away uniform numbers are now consistent with the lettering colors (white with red trim).

The alternate red uniform was introduced during the 2001–02 season, and features the city name and numbers in white with black trim. With subtle changes like the &quot;Miami&quot; wordmark on the black uniforms and the addition of the &quot;MH&quot; alternate logo on the shorts, these uniforms remain in use with the Heat today.

Following the switch to Nike as the uniform provider in the 2017–18 season, the Heat&#x27;s current uniforms now fall under three categories. The white uniforms are part of the &quot;Association&quot; line, the black uniforms are on the &quot;Icon&quot; line and the red uniforms are assigned to the &quot;Statement&quot; line. All three uniforms are now used regardless of home or away games.

===Special uniforms===
Since the 2007–08 season, the Heat participated in the NBA&#x27;s Noche Latina promotions, or Latin Nights. From 2008 to 2014, the Heat wore a modified version of their black uniforms, featuring the wordmark &quot;El Heat&quot;; a sleeved version was used in 2014. For the 2014–15 season, the Heat wore their white uniforms with the &quot;El Heat&quot; wordmark, followed by the Noche Latina version of their red alternates in the 2015–16 season.

The Heat wore a variation of their current home uniforms on the opening night of the 2012–13 season, with gold accents and a patch of the Larry O&#x27;Brien Championship Trophy on the right chest. They used another variation on opening night of the 2013–14 season, this time with gold lettering.

During the 2013–14 season, the Heat wore a variation of their current home uniforms, but with the player&#x27;s names at the back replaced by their nicknames (e.g. &#x27;King James&#x27; for LeBron James). They wore the uniforms for select home games that season.

From 2012 to 2014, the Heat wore special monochrome uniforms: an all-black ensemble in the 2011–12 season, an all-white version in the 2012–13 season, and an all-red attire in the 2013–14 season. In 2015, a variation of their all-black uniforms, featuring drop shadows, centered numbers and heavy striping inspired from a tuxedo, was used, followed by a similarly designed white uniform in the 2016–17 season.

The 2015–16 season saw the unveiling of two special uniforms. One featured a blend of modern and classic styles (Heat Legacy), while the other is a military-inspired uniform (Home Strong).

The Heat also participated in the Christmas Day games wearing special uniforms. In 2012, they wore monochrome red uniforms known as &quot;Big Color.&quot; The following year, they wore their &quot;Big Logo&quot; sleeved uniforms, featuring a chrome-treated version of their &quot;flaming ball&quot; logo. In 2014, the Heat wore a variation of their home uniform, featuring their primary logo and centered numbers in front, and black nameplates with the player&#x27;s first name below the number at the back.

The Heat have also honored the ABA&#x27;s Miami Floridians by donning throwback uniforms; first the road jerseys in the 2005–06 season, then the home jerseys in the 2011–12 season.

In the 2017–18 season, the Heat wore special &quot;City&quot; uniforms (named as such by Nike to commemorate local cultures and team traditions) that paid homage to the hit 1980s TV series &quot;Miami Vice&quot;. The uniforms were white with pink, light blue and black trim and featured the &quot;Miami&quot; wordmark inspired from the logo of the Miami Arena. For the 2018–19 season, the Heat released black versions of the Miami Vice uniforms. In addition, a pink version of the uniform was unveiled as part of Nike&#x27;s &quot;Earned&quot; series which were exclusive only to the 16 teams that qualified in the 2018 NBA playoffs. A light blue version of the uniforms was used in the 2019–20 season. The Vice theme continued with the 2020–21 &quot;City&quot; uniform, this time featuring a pink and blue gradient and black letters.

In the 2021–22 season, the Heat wore special &quot;City&quot; uniforms that mixed various uniform styles used by the team. The black-based uniform featured a mix of lettering taken from the Heat&#x27;s previous and current uniform sets, including the throwback Floridians and Miami Vice &quot;City&quot; set. Players were allowed to choose their own number styles. A white version of this uniform served as its 2022–23 &quot;City&quot; uniform.

The 2023–24 &quot;City&quot; uniform centered around the mantra of &quot;HEAT Culture&quot; within the organization. The black-based uniform featured the team name in red and &quot;CULTURE&quot; in white letters. The number font was based on the 1988–99 uniforms. A modified version of the uniform was worn by Jaime Jaquez Jr. during the 2024 All-Star Weekend Slam Dunk Contest, with &quot;EL HEAT CULTURA&quot; emblazoned in front to acknowledge Jaquez Jr.&#x27;s Mexican American heritage. A red version of the &quot;HEAT Culture&quot; uniform served as its 2024–25 &quot;City&quot; uniform. However, midway through the 2024–25 season, the Heat retired the red &quot;HEAT Culture&quot; uniform in favor of the 2017–18 white &quot;Miami Vice&quot; uniform, which they wore as a temporary substitute to the primary white &quot;Association&quot; uniform for the rest of the season.

Miami&#x27;s 2021 &quot;Earned&quot; uniform (rewarded after making the 2020 NBA playoffs) marked the first time the team used yellow as a base color; previously it was only utilized as an accent color on the logo and uniforms. Letters were rendered in black with white trim, but red was not used at all in the uniform.

==Rivalries==

===New York Knicks===

The rivalry between the New York Knicks and the expansion Miami Heat was a result of their four consecutive playoff series from 1997 to 2000. Each series went seven games. The rivalry&#x27;s central figure was Pat Riley, the head coach of both teams (the early 1990s for the Knicks and the late 1990s for the Heat). Jeff Van Gundy took over Riley&#x27;s stint as head coach of the Knicks, while his elder brother Stan Van Gundy was simultaneously an assistant coach for the Heat. Patrick Ewing and Alonzo Mourning had been friends from their Georgetown college basketball period. Larry Johnson, one of the Knicks, held bad blood with Mourning as far back as their days in the Charlotte Hornets.

===Chicago Bulls===

The rivalry with the Chicago Bulls began once the Miami Heat became contenders during the 1990s, a decade dominated by the Bulls and Michael Jordan. During that period, the Heat were eliminated three times by the Bulls, who would go on to win the NBA championship each time. After Jordan retired and the Heat&#x27;s fall in the early 2000s, the rivalry cooled but slightly picked up when the Heat faced them in the first round of the 2006 NBA playoffs, which ended in a 4–2 Heat series victory and went on to win the NBA Finals. The Bulls would sweep the defending champion Heat in the first round the next season.

The rivalry has intensified with the resurgence of the Bulls, and the emergence of Derrick Rose and the Heat re-signing Dwyane Wade (who turned down a chance of joining his hometown Bulls) with newly acquired superstars in Chris Bosh and LeBron James (who spurned a chance of teaming up with Rose in Chicago). The revived rivalry has been very physical, involving rough plays and hard fouls between players. Both teams met in the 2011 Eastern Conference finals, with the Heat winning in five games.

The Bulls ended the Heat&#x27;s record-setting 27 game win streak on March 27, 2013, with a 101–97 victory at the United Center in Chicago. Despite playing without Derrick Rose, Joakim Noah, Richard &quot;Rip&quot; Hamilton, and Marco Belinelli, the Bulls managed to end the second longest win streak in basketball history.

The rivalry would continue into the 2013 NBA playoffs when the Heat would play the Bulls in the second round. The Bulls ended another Miami Heat winning streak by beating the Heat 93–87 in Game 1. The Heat came back in Game 2 and set a record for the largest margin of victory in franchise playoff history with a 115–78 win. The Bulls also set a record for the worst playoff defeat in franchise history. The 51 personal fouls were the most in a playoff game since 1995. In Game 3, Nazr Mohammed was ejected for shoving LeBron James early in the second quarter. Norris Cole had his jersey ripped by Taj Gibson while driving to the basket for a layup. Joakim Noah was seen applauding and cheering on the image of Chris Bosh arguing with Mario Chalmers. Noah received a technical foul for shoving Chris Andersen after he fell on Nate Robinson. Chalmers received a flagrant foul for ringing his arm around Noah&#x27;s neck. Taj Gibson and Noah were both ejected in the same game for yelling at the referees.

The two teams met in the 2023 Play-In Tournament to determine the 8th seed for the East. The Heat won to earn the Eastern Conference&#x27;s 8th seed. They both met again with the Heat once again defeating the Bulls, earning the 8th seed.

===Orlando Magic===

The Orlando Magic and the Miami Heat had a rivalry because both teams are located in Florida, thus the rivalry was known as the Sunshine State rivalry. Another ingredient to the rivalry was the high-caliber players on both teams such as Orlando&#x27;s Shaquille O&#x27;Neal and Penny Hardaway to Miami&#x27;s Alonzo Mourning and Tim Hardaway. The two had met each other in the NBA playoffs for the first time in 1997, with Miami beating Orlando 3–2, they have not met in the playoffs since.

The rivalry intensified during the 2000s and early 2010s with the rising stardom of Miami&#x27;s and Orlando&#x27;s Dwyane Wade and Dwight Howard, along with Miami&#x27;s acquiring high-caliber stars such LeBron James from the Cleveland Cavaliers and Chris Bosh from the Toronto Raptors and in 2010, resulting in fierce competition between the two.

When Dwight Howard departed from the Magic to the Los Angeles Lakers in August 2012, the rivalry softened. The Orlando Magic are undergoing a process of rebuilding, however, competition still remains tense.

===Boston Celtics===

The two teams first squared off in the playoffs in 2010, with the Celtics defeating the Heat four games to one en route to an eventual NBA Finals appearance by the Celtics. Having suffered first-round losses in three straight years, it was the loss to the Celtics that prompted Dwyane Wade to declare that the loss would be &quot;my last&quot; in the first round for the near future.

LeBron James&#x27; own enmity with the Boston Celtics can be found as far back as his first stint with the Cleveland Cavaliers, where the Celtics upset the Cavaliers in 2008 and 2010. Among the two Heat stars, Wade went as far as to say that he personally hates the Celtics, with James&#x27; own disdain for Boston manifesting in how he referred to the Celtics exclusively as &quot;that team&quot; in 2011. With the acquisition of both James and Chris Bosh in 2010, the Heat challenged the Celtics for dominance in the Eastern Conference; James claimed that the formation of the Heat&#x27;s Big 3 was to mirror the formation of the Celtics&#x27; Big 3 in Paul Pierce, Ray Allen and Kevin Garnett. After dropping the first three games versus the Celtics in the regular season, Miami prevailed in their fourth encounter, taking the second seed from the Celtics and gaining home-court advantage for their eventual match-up of the postseason. The teams met in the Eastern Conference semifinals of the 2011 NBA playoffs, where Paul Pierce was ejected in Game 1, Dwyane Wade inadvertently broke Rajon Rondo&#x27;s arm in Game 3 and James scored the final 10 points in the deciding Game 5. James could be found roaring to the fans as the Celtics&#x27; end came, even kneeling to the ground in relief after finally defeating the Celtics. The rivalry would continue in the following season, where the Heat again took home-court advantage over the Celtics, though Boston again won the season series over the Heat. Despite the loss of Bosh to injury in the semifinals, the Heat took a 2–0 lead before the Celtics won the next three games; the first five games included two overtimes, Rondo&#x27;s 44-point performance in Game 2, as well as Pierce and James fouling out in Game 4. James&#x27; 45-point performance in Game 6 at Boston forced a deciding seventh game, where the two teams traded blows deep into the third and fourth quarters, before Miami pulled away with a 4–3 victory en route to the 2012 NBA Finals.

In the off-season, the Celtics&#x27; Big 3 was broken up following Ray Allen&#x27;s joining of the Heat. When asked about their immediate reactions to their teammate leaving for their rival, Kevin Garnett claimed that he deleted Allen&#x27;s phone number, while Paul Pierce admitted that it &quot;hurt&quot;, though he still considers Allen &quot;a brother to me&quot; for their 2008 championship run. Although the two teams would not meet in the playoffs, the animosity continued in their four regular season games. The season opener – a Heat victory – included Rondo clotheslining Wade&#x27;s neck, Garnett snubbing a handshake from Allen pre-game, and Garnett throwing an elbow at Mario Chalmers. During Miami&#x27;s 2013 streak, Paul Pierce went on record to say that he wished for Miami to lose all of its remaining games by that point. When James voiced his displeasure over the Chicago Bulls&#x27; physicality against him, Boston&#x27;s general manager Danny Ainge called it &quot;embarrassing&quot; for LeBron to complain about it. Pat Riley, the Heat team president, retorted that &quot;Danny should shut the fuck up.&quot; The teams met during the streak, where it was five years to the day that the Celtics&#x27; stopped the Houston Rockets&#x27; own 20+-game winning streak. It ended in a Heat victory, one that featured James dunking on Jason Terry; he received a technical foul for staring down at Terry post-dunk. When asked about it after the game by reporters, James stated that he was &quot;glad it happened to him.&quot;

From 2020 to 2023, the Heat and the Celtics faced each other in the Eastern Conference finals for three out of four of the years. The Heat won the first and third meetings, with the Celtics winning the second. The Heat and the Celtics would lose all the finals that played in from those years. In 2024, the Heat and Celtics faced off in the first round, but the Heat were playing without Jimmy Butler, and the Celtics won the championship that year.

===Indiana Pacers===
A recent rivalry was triggered with the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference semifinals of the 2012 NBA playoffs. Although the two previously met in the 2004 NBA playoffs (when Indiana won 4–2), as of 2014, the only player still left from either team is Udonis Haslem of the Heat. Both head coaches were fined for statements made relating to the officiating: Frank Vogel accused the Heat of flopping before the series started, while Erik Spoelstra took offense to what he perceived to be deliberate head-hunting of his players on the part of the Pacers. Indiana took a 2–1 lead after Miami&#x27;s Chris Bosh was sidelined with an abdominal strain. Powered by LeBron James and Dwyane Wade, Miami won three straight games to take the series, 4–2. The series was marked by several suspensions, flagrant fouls, and confrontations between the players: Tyler Hansbrough&#x27;s flagrant foul on Dwyane Wade (which drew blood), Udonis Haslem&#x27;s retaliatory flagrant foul on Hansborough (which led to Haslem&#x27;s Game 6 suspension), Wade colliding with Darren Collison in transition, Juwan Howard confronting Lance Stephenson over the latter&#x27;s flashing of the choke sign to James, and Dexter Pittman elbowing Stephenson in the neck (which led to his own three-game suspension). Indiana&#x27;s Danny Granger received technical fouls in three consecutive games for his confrontations with Heat players; he stripped James of his headband in Game 2 while attempting to block a shot, pulled the back of James&#x27; jersey in Game 3 while trying to stop a fast-break, and chest-bumped Wade in Game 4 after the latter was fouled by Roy Hibbert.

The following season saw improvements for both teams, from Miami&#x27;s acquisition of Ray Allen and Chris Andersen, to the emergence of Paul George and Lance Stephenson. Notably, it was after the Heat lost to the Pacers that they compiled a 27-game winning streak; the last time the Heat lost two in a row in the year were the games against Indiana and Portland. During the waning minutes of Game 6 in the semifinals between the Pacers and the New York Knicks, the Pacers&#x27; fans were chanting &quot;Beat the Heat&quot; as their team beat their old New York rivals. True to form, the Heat and the Pacers met in the conference finals of the 2013 NBA playoffs on May 22, 2013. Several instances of physicality became prominent in the series: Shane Battier received an offensive foul for throwing his knee at Hibbert&#x27;s midsection; Hibbert claimed that it was an intentional dirty play on the part of Battier. Andersen suffered a bloodied nose after colliding with David West. Ian Mahinmi received a retroactive flagrant foul for a grab of James&#x27; arm. Norris Cole latched a hand on West&#x27;s groin area as he tried to slip through West. Wade received a retroactive flagrant foul for hitting Stephenson in the head, another incident that the Pacers, notably Paul George, felt was a dirty play. The Heat survived Game 1 on a James game-winning layup, while the Pacers came back to tie the series at 1–1 after forcing James into two late fourth-quarter turnovers for Game 2. In Game 3, the Heat set a team record for points in a postseason half with 70. It was the first time the Pacers had given up 70 points since 1992. Allen&#x27;s single turnover was the least ever suffered by the Heat in a first half. Their five total turnovers is tied for the fewest in franchise history. The Game 3 victory marked the first time that an NBA team had won five straight road games by double digits. The Heat won the series 4–3, with a 99–76 win in Game 7. In the 2014 NBA playoffs, after beating the Brooklyn Nets in five games, and the Pacers beating the Washington Wizards in six games, the Heat and the first-seeded Pacers would meet up in the Eastern Conference finals in a much-anticipated rematch. The Heat would go on to eliminate the Pacers 4–2, advancing to their fourth consecutive NBA Finals in the Big Three-era. The Heat stumbled during Game 1 in Indianapolis, falling 107–96. They would win the next three games, but during Game 5, which Miami lost 93–90, James struggled, suffering heavy foul trouble and scoring only seven points, his lowest playoff record. During Game 6 in Miami, the Heat would defeat the Pacers 117–92.

===Dallas Mavericks===
The Heat–Mavericks rivalry began in the 2006 NBA Finals, where the two teams met and both entering their first NBA Finals appearance. A year prior, the Heat had acquired Shaquille O&#x27;Neal. The Mavericks were led by Dirk Nowitzki, and the Heat were led by Dwyane Wade. Dallas had home-court advantage in the series due to a better regular season record (60–22) than Miami&#x27;s (52–30) and took the first two games in the series, entering Game 3 with a commanding 2–0 lead. They looked set to win Game 3 until a rally by the Heat, including many free throws from Wade, resulted in the Mavericks losing the third game. The Heat won all of its home games, as the Mavericks dropped games 3, 4 and 5. In a highly controversial Game 5, a 101–100 victory for the Heat, Wade shot more free throws than the entire Mavericks team. Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, as well as Nowitzki, were both fined for acts of misconduct. During Game 6, the series returned to Dallas, where the Mavericks fell 95–92. Jason Terry airballed a three-point attempt that could have tied the game. Wade picked up the ball, throwing it in the air in celebration as the Heat won the NBA Championship, and its first one as well. Wade was named the Finals MVP.

In the 2010 off-season, Miami acquired LeBron James from the Cleveland Cavaliers and Chris Bosh from the Toronto Raptors to team up with Wade and form their own &quot;big three&quot; (to rival the Celtics&#x27; big three) that was expected to win the championship. The Heat finished 58–24, acquiring the southeast division title and the second seed in the Eastern Conference. During the regular season, the Mavericks swept the Heat 2–0. The Heat cruised through the Playoffs without much competition, eliminating every team – the Philadelphia 76ers, defending Eastern Conference champions Boston Celtics and the top-seeded Chicago Bulls all five games. Meanwhile, the Mavericks had tallied 57–25 for the third seed, leaving them to face the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round. The Mavericks had been defeated in the first round all but one time since the 2006 Finals, including a defeat from the seventh-seeded San Antonio Spurs just the previous season. Because of this, the Mavericks were underdogs throughout the playoffs, but they were able to dispatch Portland in six games. They faced the defending NBA champions Los Angeles Lakers and pulled off the impossible by sweeping them, ending their bid for a three-peat. In the conference finals, they defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder, resulting a rematch between the two teams. After taking a 2–1 lead however, the Heat stumbled in the next three games. They were eliminated on their own home floor after losing 105–95 during Game 6 in Miami – extending LeBron&#x27;s quest for a ring. The loss had also brought further public humiliation for LeBron James, who had been scrutinized and negatively criticized for leaving the Cavaliers to join the Heat. LeBron was criticized for only averaging 17.8 points. Cavaliers fans rejoiced in the Heat&#x27;s loss due to the anger that was caused by LeBron&#x27;s decision to join the Heat, which they felt was unfair and a betrayal.

After that, the Mavericks would never win another game against the Heat. Dallas hosted the Heat for the season opener on December 25, 2011, of the lockout-shortened 2011–12 season that was shortened to 66 games. The Heat spoiled the Mavericks&#x27; championship banner-raising night, giving them a 105–94 loss.

Although the Heat and the Mavericks have not met in the postseason ever since, the rivalry continued as Mark Cuban publicly discussed his extreme personal dislike for the Heat. He described &quot;hate&quot; was not being strong enough of a word to describe his dislike for the Heat. He also had a personal dislike for Wade.

==Home arenas==
==Radio and television==

The Heat&#x27;s flagship radio stations are WAXY (790 AM) in English, with Mike Inglis, former Heat coach Ron Rothstein, and former WNBA player Ruth Riley calling games, and WQBA (1140 AM) in Spanish, with Jose Pañeda and Joe Pujala on the call.

The Heat games are televised primarily by FanDuel Sports Network Sun with Eric Reid and John Crotty. Reid has been part of the Heat&#x27;s broadcasting team since the beginning of the franchise, first serving as a color analyst, and later becoming the lead play-by-play voice starting in the 1991–92 season. For the first four years of the franchise, there were radio-television simulcasts of locally broadcast games before the franchise eventually created separate broadcast teams.

WBFS-TV (channel 33) was the original over-the-air flagship station for Heat games, with its first stint concluding at the end of the 1998–99 season, after 11 seasons. WAMI-TV (channel 69) took over the following season; however, WBFS (along with now-sister station WFOR channel 4) returned as the Heat&#x27;s primary over-the-air home in 2000–01, this time lasting until the 2003–04 season. On the cable side, Heat games were televised on then-SportsChannel Florida (now FanDuel Sports Network Florida), before moving to then-Sunshine Network (later Sun Sports, Fox Sports Sun and Bally Sports Sun, currently FanDuel Sports Network Sun) starting in the 1992–93 season. Since 2004–05, Sun Sports have served as the exclusive regional carrier of Heat games throughout the team&#x27;s designated broadcast territory, which includes the metropolitan areas of Miami–Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach–Fort Pierce–Port St. Lucie, and Fort Myers–Naples.

On a national scale, games are occasionally televised by TNT, ESPN, or ABC.

From 1988 to 1993, the Heat were on WQAM. WINZ previously aired games from 1993 to 1996 and WIOD did from 1996 to 2008.

==Personnel==

===Current roster===
===Retained draft rights===
The Heat hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player&#x27;s draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player&#x27;s contract with the non-NBA team ends. This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams.

===Basketball Hall of Famers===
===FIBA Hall of Famers===
===Retired numbers===
The Heat have retired seven numbers, although only six of the players played for the franchise. Michael Jordan was the first player to be honored despite not having played for the Heat. Pat Riley retired Jordan&#x27;s signature No. 23 before his final game in Miami during the 2002–03 season as a tribute to his career.

During the 2005–06 season the organization honored Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Marino&#x27;s No. 13 in respect of his contributions to the National Football League (NFL)&#x27;s Miami Dolphins. However, the No. 13 jersey is not retired and is still available for use by the Heat players.

The NBA retired Bill Russell&#x27;s No. 6 for all its member teams on August 11, 2022.
==Head coaches==

There have been six head coaches for the Miami Heat. Ron Rothstein was the franchise&#x27;s first head coach, serving from 1988 through 1991; he remains as assistant coach. Kevin Loughery was his successor from 1991 to 1995, guiding the Heat to their first two playoff berths in 1992 and 1994. Loughery was fired 46 games into the 1994–95 season, posting a 17–29 record. Alvin Gentry, an assistant coach who joined in 1991, was brought in to replace Loughery on an interim basis. Miami went 15–21 for the final 36 games, and Gentry moved to the Detroit Pistons the following season.

In the summer of 1995, owner Micky Arison hired Pat Riley as the head coach and team president. At eleven years, Riley is the longest-tenured head coach in the franchise&#x27;s history, as well its all-time leader in total wins and games coached. Upon suffering a 25–57 record in the 2002–03 season, Riley abruptly announced his retirement, but remained as team president. He elevated assistant coach Stan Van Gundy as his replacement. Van Gundy is Miami&#x27;s all-time leader for the highest winning percentage in the regular season (.605), having led Miami to a 42–40 record in his first season and a 59–23 record in his second year. He spearheaded Miami&#x27;s 2005 campaign, where they held the top seed in the east, swept their first two playoff opponents and made it to the conference finals.

An 11–10 record early into the 2005–06 season prompted Riley to come out of retirement and replace Van Gundy. Shortly thereafter, Riley would win his fifth and final championship as a head coach, as well as Miami&#x27;s first championship in 2006. Riley would retire permanently following the 15-win 2007–08 season, but once again remained as team president. His hand-picked replacement, longtime assistant Erik Spoelstra, is the current Heat head coach, a position he has held since 2008. At 38, he was the youngest head coach in the league at the time, as well as the first Filipino-American head coach in league history. Spoelstra led the team to four consecutive appearances in the NBA Finals, culminating in back-to-back championships in 2012 and 2013.

<text>The Brooklyn Nets are an American professional basketball team based in the New York City borough of Brooklyn. The Nets compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference. The team plays its home games at Barclays Center. They are one of two NBA teams located in New York City; the other being the New York Knicks.

The club was established in 1967 as a charter franchise of the NBA&#x27;s rival league, the American Basketball Association (ABA). They played in New Jersey as the New Jersey Americans during their first season, before relocating to Long Island, New York, in 1968 and changing their name to the New York Nets. During this time, the Nets won two ABA championships (1974 and 1976). In 1976, the ABA merged with the NBA, and the Nets were absorbed into the NBA along with three other ABA teams (the Denver Nuggets, Indiana Pacers, and San Antonio Spurs), all of whom remain in the league to this day.

In 1977, the team returned to New Jersey and played as the New Jersey Nets from 1977 to 2012. Led by star point guard Jason Kidd, the Nets reached the NBA Finals in two consecutive NBA seasons (2001–02 and 2002–03), but failed to win a championship. In the summer of 2012, the team moved to Barclays Center in Brooklyn, becoming the first major sports franchise in the borough since the departure of the Brooklyn Dodgers baseball team in 1957. Since moving to Brooklyn, the Nets have qualified for the playoffs on eight occasions, including trips to the conference semifinals in 2014 and 2021.

==History==

The Brooklyn Nets were founded in 1967 and initially played in Teaneck, New Jersey, as the New Jersey Americans. In its early years, the team led a nomadic existence, moving to Long Island in 1968 and playing in various arenas there as the New York Nets.

Led by Hall of Famer Julius &quot;Dr. J&quot; Erving, the Nets won two ABA championships in New York before becoming one of four ABA teams to be admitted into the NBA as part of the ABA–NBA merger in 1976. Unlike the other three ABA teams entering the NBA, who played in cities without any NBA presence, the Nets were required by the NBA to pay an &quot;encroachment fee&quot; of $4.8million (equivalent to $million in ) to the New York Knicks. The team financed that payment by selling Erving&#x27;s contract to the Philadelphia 76ers; and the Nets went from winning the last ABA title in 1975–76 to having the worst record in the NBA in 1976–77. The team then moved back to New Jersey in 1977 and became the New Jersey Nets. During their time in the state, the Nets played in two consecutive NBA Finals in the 2001–02 and 2002–03 seasons, led on the court by point guard Jason Kidd.

After playing 35 seasons in New Jersey, the team moved back to the state of New York, changed its geographic name to Brooklyn, and began playing in the new Barclays Center, starting with the 2012–13 NBA season. The team&#x27;s move from New Jersey to Brooklyn was approved unanimously by the NBA Board of Governors on April 13, 2012.

==Rivalries==

===Boston Celtics===
During the early 2000s, the Nets were led by Jason Kidd and Kenyon Martin, while the Boston Celtics were experiencing newfound success behind Paul Pierce and Antoine Walker. The rivalry began to heat up in the conference finals of the 2002 playoffs, which was preceded by trash talking from the Celtics, who claimed Martin was a &quot;fake&quot; tough guy. Things progressed as the series started, and on-court tensions seemed to spill into the stands. Celtic fans berated Kidd and his family with chants of &quot;Wife Beater!&quot; in response to Kidd&#x27;s 2001 domestic abuse charge. When the series returned to New Jersey, Nets fans responded, with some brandishing signs that read &quot;Will someone please stab Paul Pierce?&quot; referring to a night club incident in 2000 in which Pierce was stabbed 11 times. When asked about the fan barbs being traded, Kenyon Martin stated, &quot;Our fans hate them, their fans hate us.&quot; Bill Walton said at the time that Nets–Celtics was the &quot;beginning of the next great NBA rivalry&quot; during the conference finals. Led by Kidd, the Nets advanced to the NBA Finals, and the following year, swept Boston in the 2003 playoffs.

On November 28, 2012, there were indications that the rivalry might be rekindled when an altercation occurred on the court, resulting in the ejection of Rajon Rondo, Gerald Wallace, and Kris Humphries. Rondo was suspended for two games in the aftermath, while Wallace and Kevin Garnett were fined. The story was revisited on December 25, when Wallace grabbed Garnett&#x27;s shorts and the two had to be broken up by referees and players alike.

In the 2019 NBA off-season, the Nets signed point guard Kyrie Irving. Coming off two seasons with the Celtics, Irving was described as selfish by many critics. This impression caused many Celtics fans to blame him for the Celtics&#x27; inability to get through to the playoffs.

During a regular season game in the 2019–20 season between the Celtics and Nets, the Celtics&#x27; fans displayed their displeasure with Irving by chanting &quot;Kyrie sucks&quot; in TD Garden. When the series returned to Brooklyn two days later, the Nets&#x27; fans chanted &quot;Kyrie&#x27;s better&quot; in response to the chants in Boston. The &quot;Kyrie&#x27;s Better&quot; chants reference to how the Celtics signed Kemba Walker after Irving left for the Nets.

On May 30, 2021, after Kyrie Irving stomped on the Celtics center-court logo, a fan threw a water bottle at Irving at TD Garden following a Nets victory and a 3–1 lead in the series.

===New York Knicks===

The Knicks–Nets rivalry has historically been a geographical one, with the Knicks playing in Madison Square Garden in the New York City borough of Manhattan, while the Nets played in the suburban area of Long Island and in New Jersey, and since 2012 have been playing at Barclays Center in Brooklyn. Media outlets have noted the Knicks–Nets rivalry&#x27;s similarity to those of other New York City teams, such as the Major League Baseball (MLB) historical Subway Series rivalry and the current rivalry between the American League (AL)&#x27;s New York Yankees and the National League (NL)&#x27;s New York Mets, and the National Football League (NFL) rivalry between the National Football Conference (NFC)&#x27;s New York Giants and the American Football Conference (AFC)&#x27;s New York Jets, the result of the boroughs&#x27; proximity through the New York City subway. Historically, the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn competed via the Dodgers–Giants rivalry, when the two teams were the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants. Like the Knicks and Nets, the Giants and Dodgers played in Manhattan and Brooklyn, respectively, and were fierce intraleague rivals. The rivalry between the New York Islanders and New York Rangers of the National Hockey League (NHL) took on a similar dimension while the Islanders inhabited the Barclays Center, from 2015 to 2021. Due to the Knicks being located in Manhattan and the Nets being located in Brooklyn, some media outlets have dubbed this rivalry &quot;Clash of the Boroughs&quot;.

===Toronto Raptors===

The rivalry with the Toronto Raptors began in the 2000s, specifically in 2004, after Raptors guard/forward Vince Carter was traded to the New Jersey Nets. However, the two teams did not meet in the playoffs until 2007, when the Nets defeated the Raptors in the first round series, 4 games to 2, after a go-ahead shot by Richard Jefferson with 8 seconds left in Game 6 led to a 98–97 victory. In 2014, the teams met again in the first round, and the series went to seven games, with a game-winning block by Paul Pierce, giving the Nets the 104–103 victory. The series was noted for controversy when Toronto Raptors general manager Masai Ujiri made derogatory remarks towards Brooklyn at a fan rally outside Maple Leaf Square in Toronto before Game 1. Ujiri later apologized at halftime. The Raptors and Nets faced each other in the 2020 NBA playoffs in the first round, with Toronto winning the series four games to none.

==Uniforms==

===New Jersey Americans===
Upon debuting in the ABA in 1967, the New Jersey Americans wore white and red uniforms. The white uniforms contained red, blue and white stripes, with the team name and numerals in red with blue trim. The red uniforms mirror the striping configurations of the white uniforms while the city name and numerals were in blue with white trim.

===New York Nets===

====1968–1972====
Moving to Long Island as the New York Nets, they kept the original Americans template except for the location and team name. The white uniforms featured a script &quot;Nets&quot; lettering with a tail accent below, while the red uniforms featured &quot;New York&quot; in block letters (similar to the New York Knicks). Over the years, the letters and stripes would endure a few adjustments.

====1972–1977====
The Nets changed uniforms upon moving to Nassau Coliseum. The white uniforms featured a thick blue stripe with white stars on the left, along with a red stripe and white outline. The team name is written in red block letters. The blue uniforms, which featured &quot;New York&quot; in white block letters, mirrored that of the white uniforms.

===New Jersey Nets===
====1977–1981; 1983–1990====
The Nets carried the &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; uniform to New Jersey in 1977. The white uniform remained the same but the blue uniform read &quot;Nets&quot; in front. The blue uniform later added &quot;New Jersey&quot; in white block letters inside the red stripe.

====1981–1983====
Upon moving to the Meadowlands in 1981, the Nets briefly changed their uniform set. The white uniform brought back the &quot;Nets&quot; script from the original New York Nets uniforms, but the color scheme became blue with red trim. The blue uniform featured &quot;New Jersey&quot; stacked together in a similar script style, and the letters were colored in red with white trim.

====1990–1997====
The Nets underwent a visual rebrand before the 1990–91 season. The white uniform featured a more futuristic &quot;Nets&quot; script in red with white and blue trim, while adding red and blue stripes. Initially, the Nets wore white and light blue gradient road uniforms that had a tie-dye effect, but switched to a solid blue uniform after only one season. Both blue uniforms featured the same &quot;Nets&quot; script in red with blue and white trim along with red and white stripes.

====1997–2012====
The Nets updated their visual identity prior to the 1997–98 season, going with a deeper red and navy scheme with silver accents. The white uniform, which remained virtually unchanged throughout its history, featured the team name in navy with silver and red trim. The navy uniform featured the city name in silver with navy and red trim. The dark grey alternate uniform, used until 2006, initially went with the city name in navy with white and red trim, but reversed the color scheme to white with red and navy trim after only two seasons. This uniform was the only one to feature the &quot;NJ&quot; alternate logo on the neckline. The red alternate uniform, which replaced the grey alternate and became the primary dark uniform in 2009, featured the team name in white with navy and silver trim. All uniforms featured thick navy and silver argyle stripes.

===Brooklyn Nets===
====2012–2017====
Upon moving to Brooklyn in 2012, the Nets went with a simple black and white uniform design, with &quot;Brooklyn&quot; in front of both the white and black uniforms. They also wore three different alternate uniforms. A grey-sleeved alternate with &quot;Brooklyn&quot; in Dodger blue, was first used in 2013 as a visual recall to the Brooklyn Dodgers. A white-sleeved alternate with the team name in black, featured the same &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; look from the 1970s. A dark grey sleeveless alternate, meant to recall the 1980s New Jersey Nets uniforms, featured the team name in white and the city name in white written inside a black stripe.

====2017–present====
With the switch from Adidas to Nike, the Nets kept most aspects of their visual identity intact. The white uniform became the &quot;Association&quot; uniform while the black uniform became the &quot;Icon&quot; uniform. The Nets have had three different versions of the &quot;Statement&quot; uniform. The first set, with &quot;BKLYN&quot; in white, was in dark grey and featured the same stars and stripes look from the 1970s. The uniform was updated in 2019 to a lighter grey base and black/dark grey stripes, with &quot;BKLYN&quot; written in graffiti style designed by Eric Haze. In 2022, the Nets again changed its &quot;Statement&quot; uniform, this time with a black base, black letters with silver trim, and a subtle greyscale herringbone striping with three black stars on the left.

The Nets also employed a fourth uniform option: the &quot;City&quot; uniform. The 2017–18 black &quot;City&quot; uniform featured the full team name spelled in white along with grey accents inspired from the Brooklyn Bridge. The following season, it was replaced with a black uniform featuring stylized Brooklyn camo patterns as a tribute to the Notorious B.I.G. For 2019–20, the Nets wore white versions of the &quot;Biggie&quot; uniforms, but with Haze-designed &quot;BED-STUY&quot; graffiti lettering in front (a reference to Bedford–Stuyvesant where the Notorious B.I.G. grew up). The 2020–21 &quot;City&quot; uniform, which honors Brooklyn-born artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, is predominantly black and features &quot;BKLYN NETS&quot; written in Basquiat&#x27;s style along with multi-colored striping. The Basquiat-inspired &quot;City&quot; uniform returned in 2022–23 but in a white base.

In the 2021–22 season, the Nets&#x27; &quot;City&quot; uniform featured visual references to the Nets&#x27; uniform history. The navy base and white and silver argyle stripes recalled the 1997–2009 uniforms. The &quot;Nets&quot; wordmark and lettering were taken from the 1990–97 uniforms. A red stripe with white stars honored the &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; uniform of the 1970s and 1980s. A modified version of the 1980s New Jersey Nets logo, replacing the New Jersey outline with the map of Brooklyn, was added to the right leg. The 1997–2012 shield logo, also tweaked to feature the current &quot;B&quot; alternate logo, was added on the waist.

The &quot;City&quot; uniform for the 2023–24 season featured a collaboration with Brooklyn-based artist Kaws. The predominantly dark grey design featured splashes of light grey, blue, turquoise and pink inspired by Kaws&#x27; &quot;Tension&quot; series. The stylized &quot;Nets&quot; wordmark was also influenced by Kaws&#x27; graphic style. The design was slightly tweaked for the 2024–25 &quot;City&quot; uniform, this time with the color splashes relegated to the &quot;Brooklyn&quot; wordmark as part of an outer trim, with the base now featuring greyscale splashes.

A fifth uniform option, the &quot;Earned&quot; uniform, is released occasionally and is exclusive only to the teams who qualified in the NBA playoffs the previous year. The Nets, by virtue of qualifying in the 2020 NBA playoffs, were given an &quot;Earned&quot; uniform. The design featured the herringbone parquet style of the Barclays Center court in shades of black and grey, with Helvetica lettering inspired from the signs found at the New York City Subway.

==Culture==

===Mascot===

The mascot of the New Jersey Nets was Sly the Silver Fox, who debuted on October 31, 1997, as part of the rebranding of the Nets for the 1997–98 season. Prior to that, the Nets&#x27; mascot was an anthropomorphic dragon named Duncan the Dragon.

After the Nets&#x27; move to Brooklyn, the team introduced a new superhero mascot named BrooklyKnight (a pun on the demonym &quot;Brooklynite&quot;) on November 3, 2012. In his first appearance, he was lowered from the ceiling of Barclays Center amid sparks and fanfare and introduced by Nets public address announcer David Diamante: &quot;Here to defend Brooklyn, he&#x27;s the BrooklyKnight.&quot; The mascot was co-created by Marvel Entertainment, a sister company to NBA broadcasters ABC and ESPN. The character also starred in a 32-page comic book published by Marvel titled &quot;BrooklyKnight #1&quot;, written by Jason Aaron with art from Mike Deodato. After the Nets&#x27; second season in Brooklyn, the BrooklyKnight mascot was retired, leaving the Nets mascotless.

===Team anthem===
On November 3, 2012, the Nets introduced a new team anthem titled &quot;Brooklyn: Something To Lean On&quot;, written and recorded by Brooklyn-born musician John Forté. The song is notable for its refrain, which features the &quot;Brooklyn&quot; chant that has been popular with fans in the Barclays Center.

===Brooklyn Brigade===

The Brooklyn Brigade is a group of fans who are known for their loud chants and passionate attitude towards the Nets. The group was founded in November 2012 by Nets fan and Brooklyn native Udong &quot;Bobby&quot; Edemeka. Edemeka attended a few early season games of the team in their new Brooklyn home. Edemeka noticed that the team lacked a solid fan base in their new home, and decided to purchase tickets for a small group of roughly 20 fans who he noticed were regular followers of the team on the SB Nation online blog, NetsDaily.
The Brigade was not yet based in Section 114. Instead, Edemeka would purchase tickets in whichever section he could, which often included nosebleed seats. The Brigade initially did not get much recognition from the Nets. Edemeka met with the CEO Irina Pavlova (of the ONEXIM Group), who was fond of the group&#x27;s antics. Although Pavlova was a supporter of the group, other members of the organization were resistant to showing support for the Brigade. During the 2014–15 season, however, the Brooklyn Nets organization began assigning seats to the Brigade in Section 114 of the Barclays Center. This section is adjacent to the press booth and gave the Brooklyn Brigade exposure on a regional level and then eventually on a national level.

During the conference semifinals in 2014, while the Nets battled the Miami Heat, Brooklyn Nets and Barclays Center CEO Brett Yomark noticed the Brigade&#x27;s effect on the arena, and he started to visit Section 114 distributing Nets&#x27; apparel. In 2016, the Nets hired Sean Marks as their general manager, who became an immediate supporter of the group. During the 2018–19 season, the Nets reserved section 114 for passionate fans, and called it &quot;The BK Block.&quot; Although the Brigade is an independent fan group of the Nets, The Block comprises mostly Brigade members.

===Mr. Whammy===
Bruce Reznick, known commonly as &quot;Mr. Whammy&quot;, is an iconic 86-year-old Nets superfan. Reznick became a Nets season ticket holder in 1998 when the Nets played in Continental Airlines Arena. He is known for his signature &quot;whammy&quot;, a practice in which he stands on the sidelines in view of opposing players while they are attempting free throws and tries to distract them with pointing, jumping, and yelling. Reznick will not &quot;whammy&quot; players that have previously played for the Nets. Reznick believes the practice is effective as Barclays Center often has one of the lowest opposing team free throw percentages in the league. For example, by January 11, 2023, opposing teams had only a 70.3 free throw shot percentage in Brooklyn, which was about eight points lower than league average for the 2022–23 NBA season. Before Reznick was given the name &quot;Mr. Whammy&quot; by Nets broadcaster Ian Eagle he was referred to as &quot;Red Shirt&quot;.

==Management==
On September 18, 2019, Joseph Tsai, the executive vice chairman of the Alibaba Group, completed the acquisition of full ownership of the Brooklyn Nets. With the closing of the transaction, Tsai became NBA Governor of the Nets and its affiliates. Additionally, former Turner Broadcasting president David Levy was named CEO of the Nets and Barclays Center. On November 12, the Nets and Barclays Center announced that David Levy would step down from the CEO position he had assumed less than two months before. Oliver Weisberg, president of Tsai&#x27;s holding company J Tsai Sports, assumed an interim CEO role.

===Ownership history===
The original owner of the Nets franchise was trucking magnate Arthur J. Brown, who founded the team in 1967. The next year, Brown sold the team for $1.1 million to entrepreneur Roy Boe. Due to financial losses suffered while the team was on Long Island, Boe moved the team back to New Jersey in 1977 and sold the team a year later to a group of seven local businessmen led by Alan N. Cohen and Joseph Taub, who became known as the &quot;Secaucus Seven&quot;.

After a lengthy ownership of the franchise and numerous unsuccessful attempts to improve the financial situation of the team, the &quot;Secaucus Seven&quot; finally sold the team in 1998 to a group of local real estate developers led by Raymond Chambers and Lewis Katz, who called themselves the &quot;Community Youth Organization&quot; and wanted to move the team to Newark, New Jersey. The next year the group signed an agreement with New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner to form YankeeNets, a holding company that owned the two teams, and later also the New Jersey Devils, and increase leverage in future broadcast contracts by negotiating together. After receiving offers from several broadcast partners, including Cablevision, which held their rights at that time, YankeeNets decided to launch its own regional sports television called the YES Network.

YankeeNets failed in its attempts to secure a deal with Newark to construct a new arena in the city. By that point in time, tensions between the management of the Yankees, Nets, and the Devils had cause a rift between them, and a decision was made to split the group. With their plan to move the Nets dead, the Community Youth Organization placed the team up for sale. After a short bidding process, the group secured a deal in 2004 with real estate developer Bruce Ratner to buy the team for $300 million, defeating a similar offer by Charles Kushner and Senator Jon Corzine of New Jersey. Ratner had purchased the team with the intent of moving it to a new arena in Brooklyn, which was to be a centerpiece of the large-scale Atlantic Yards development.

Rapper Jay-Z owned a small minority stake in the Nets from 2003 until 2013. Jay-Z was a leader in the marketing for the team and helped encourage their move from New Jersey to the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, in which he also held a stake. He relinquished his stake after registering as a sports agent with his new agency Roc Nation Sports, to avert any potential conflicts of interest. His shares were eventually sold to singer, rapper, actor and entrepreneur Will Pan, making Pan the first American of Taiwanese descent to own a U.S. professional sports franchise.

On September 24, 2009, Mikhail Prokhorov, Russia&#x27;s third-richest man according to &quot;Forbes&quot;, confirmed his intention to become majority owner of the Nets. Prokhorov sent an offer to the team owners requesting that the controlling shares of the basketball club be sold to his company, Onexim, for a symbolic price. In return, Prokhorov funded a loan of $700 million for the construction of Barclays Center, and attracted additional funds from Western banks. Prokhorov stated that he initiated the deal to help push Russian basketball to a new level of development. On May 11, 2010, following approval from the other owners of NBA teams, Prokhorov had become the principal owner of the Nets.

In late 2017, Prokhorov agreed to sell a 49% stake in the team to Joseph Tsai, with an option for Tsai to become the majority owner. The option was exercised in August 2019, with Tsai also buying the Nets&#x27; arena, Barclays Center, from Prokhorov for nearly $1 billion in a separate deal. The NBA Board of Governors unanimously approved the sale to Tsai on September 18, 2019.

==Facilities==

===Practice facilities===
The Nets&#x27; practice facility and headquarters for the team&#x27;s basketball operations are located at the Hospital for Special Surgery Training Center in the Industry City complex in the Sunset Park neighborhood of Brooklyn. The facility opened on February 17, 2016, and is built on the roof of an empty warehouse in the complex, occupying 70,000 square feet of space in total. The renovation project cost roughly $50 million. The opening of the training center completed the Nets&#x27; move to Brooklyn.

The team&#x27;s previous practice facility was at the 65,000-square-foot PNY Center in East Rutherford, New Jersey, which opened in 1998. Prior to that, the team practiced at the APA Recreation Center in North Bergen, New Jersey, sharing their lockers and practice courts with truck drivers who used the facility, and at Ramapo College in Mahwah, New Jersey.

In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy in November 2012, PNY Center suffered a power outage and extensive water damage due to flooding, and for several months, the team used the smaller training spaces and practice courts inside the Barclays Center instead.

===Retained draft rights===
The Nets hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA team. In this case, the team retains the player&#x27;s draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player&#x27;s contract with the non-NBA team ends. This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams.

==NBA D-League/G League affiliation==
The Nets signed an agreement with the Springfield Armor to become its exclusive NBA Development League affiliate starting in the 2011–12 season. This made the Nets the second team to opt for a D-League &quot;hybrid affiliation&quot;, the first being the Houston Rockets with the Rio Grande Valley Vipers. Springfield ownership maintained control over business, marketing, and day-to-day operations, with the Nets having control over coaching and player decisions. This hybrid model was well received by GMs and owners. However, after three seasons, the Detroit Pistons purchased the Armor from its former owners, and moved and renamed the team the Grand Rapids Drive.

On November 6, 2015, the Nets announced that they had purchased a new D-League team to be called the Long Island Nets. The team played their home games during the 2016–17 season at the Barclays Center and then at the Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, New York, after renovations were complete for the 2017–18 season. The Long Island Nets became the twelfth D-League team to be owned by an NBA team.

==Media==
The television home of the Nets is currently the YES Network, which the team helped create while they were under the corporate umbrella of YankeeNets LLC, a merger of business operations between the Nets and the New York Yankees. After the dissolution of YankeeNets and Bruce Ratner&#x27;s purchase of the team, YES signed a long-term deal to keep broadcasting Nets games. The sale to the Ratner group did not include the percentage of YES that was previously owned by the Nets, which remains with the pre-merger Nets owners. Prior to that, the Nets&#x27; TV home was Fox Sports Net New York and SportsChannel New York.

Select playoff games air over-the-air on WWOR-TV instead of on YES, this is only when Yankees games are airing at the same time. Previously these games aired on WLNY-TV or WPIX.

The current flagship radio station of the Nets is WFAN, which took over the radio rights to the Nets after losing their basketball contract with the Knicks (who moved to WEPN). Prior to that, Nets games aired on WNEW, WMCA, WVNJ, WNBC, WQEW, and WOR.

In the club&#x27;s early ABA years, some Sunday road games were televised in a package carried by WPIX. The team&#x27;s later ABA tenure featured more frequent road telecasts on their current broadcast partner, WWOR-TV. Known then as WOR-TV, it continued airing road games for a time once the team joined the NBA in 1976.

===Television===
Ian Eagle has been the sole television play-by-play announcer for the Nets since the departure of Marv Albert in 2011. Eagle became the lead television voice for the team in 1995 after serving as the team&#x27;s radio voice for one year, while Albert joined the Nets following his firing by MSG Network in 2005 after four decades as the lead voice of the New York Knicks. When Albert joined the broadcast team, he became the lead broadcaster with Eagle as his substitute; beginning in the 2009–10 season, due to Albert&#x27;s advancing age and his other commitments, Eagle once again assumed the lead play-by-play spot. Ryan Ruocco substitutes for Eagle during the latter&#x27;s CBS NFL and NCAA commitments.

As of 2024, Sarah Kustok, Ian Eagle, Ryan Ruocco, and/or Noah Eagle provide color commentary on YES Network broadcasts, and Meghan Triplett serves as courtside reporter.

===Radio===
WFAN is the Nets&#x27; current radio flagship, the station having assumed radio rights from WOR following the 2003–04 season. Chris Carrino and Tim Capstraw comprise the broadcast team, Carrino on play-by-play and Capstraw as the analyst. The games air on other Entercom-operated stations, such as WCBS (AM) and WXBK, when there are programming conflicts on WFAN.

Other broadcasters who have worked for the Nets include Howard David, Bob Papa, Bill Raftery, Kelly Tripucka, Albert King, Mike O&#x27;Koren, Spencer Ross, Mel Proctor, Joe Tait, John Sterling, John Minko and Mark Jackson.

Nets games have also aired on WNEW and WQEW in the past.

During the club&#x27;s ABA years, announcers included Marty Glickman, Marv Albert&#x27;s brothers Al Albert and Steve Albert, baseball Hall of Fame pitcher Bob Gibson, Bob Goldsholl, as well as Sterling and Vince DiTomasso. The latter two joined the club&#x27;s move into the NBA.

<text>The New York Knickerbockers, shortened and more commonly referred to as the New York Knicks, are an American professional basketball team based in the New York City borough of Manhattan. The Knicks compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference. The team plays its home games at Madison Square Garden, an arena they share with the New York Rangers of the National Hockey League (NHL). They are one of two NBA teams located in New York City; the other being the Brooklyn Nets. Alongside the Boston Celtics, the Knicks are one of two original NBA teams still located in its original city.

The team, established by Ned Irish in 1946, was one of the founding members of the Basketball Association of America (BAA), which became the NBA after merging with the rival National Basketball League (NBL) in 1949. The Knicks were successful during their early years and were constant playoff contenders under the franchise&#x27;s first head coach, Joe Lapchick. Beginning in 1950, the Knicks made three consecutive appearances in the NBA Finals, all of which were losing efforts. Lapchick resigned in 1956 and the team subsequently began to falter.

It was not until the late 1960s when Red Holzman became the head coach that the Knicks began to regain their former dominance. Holzman successfully guided the Knicks to two NBA championships, in 1970 and 1973. The Knicks of the 1980s had mixed success that included six playoff appearances; however, they failed to participate in the NBA Finals.

The playoff-level Knicks of the 1990s were led by future Hall of Fame center Patrick Ewing; this era was marked by passionate rivalries with the Chicago Bulls, Indiana Pacers, and Miami Heat. During this time, they were known for playing tough defense under head coaches Pat Riley and Jeff Van Gundy, making NBA Finals appearances in 1994 and 1999. However, they were unable to win an NBA championship during this era.

Since 2000, the Knicks have struggled to regain their former successes, but won their first division title in 19 years in 2012–13, led by a core of forwards Carmelo Anthony and Amar&#x27;e Stoudemire. They were eventually eliminated in the Eastern Conference semifinals by the Indiana Pacers.

The Knicks failed to make the playoffs for eight years until 2020–21 when they were led by forward Julius Randle and sophomore RJ Barrett, who was selected third overall in the 2019 NBA draft. 

==History==
===1946–1967: early years===
In 1946, basketball, particularly college basketball, was a growing and increasingly profitable sport in New York City. Hockey was another popular sport at the time and generated considerable profits; however, the arenas were not used often. Max Kase, a New York sportswriter, became the sports editor at the &quot;Boston American&quot; in the 1930s, when he met Boston Garden owner Walter A. Brown. Kase developed the idea of an organized professional league to showcase college players upon their graduation and felt it could become profitable if properly assembled. Brown, intrigued by the opportunity to attain additional income when the hockey teams were not playing or on the road, contacted several arena owners. On June 6, 1946, Kase and Brown and a group of seventeen others assembled at the Commodore Hotel in New York City, as the Basketball Association of America (BAA), where charter franchises were granted to major cities throughout the country.

Ned Irish, a college basketball promoter, retired sportswriter and then president of Madison Square Garden, was in attendance. Kase originally planned to own and operate the New York franchise himself and approached Irish with a proposal to lease the Garden. Irish explained that the rules of the Arena Managers Association of America stated that Madison Square Garden was required to own any professional teams that played in the arena. On the day of the meeting, Kase made his proposal to the panel of owners; however, they were much more impressed by Irish and his vast resources; Kase relented and the franchise was awarded to Irish.

Irish wanted a distinct name for his franchise that was representative of the city of New York. He called together members of his staff for a meeting to cast their votes in a hat. After tallying the votes, the franchise was named the Knickerbockers. The &quot;Knickerbocker&quot; name comes from the pseudonym used by Washington Irving in his book &quot;A History of New York&quot;, a name that became applied to the descendants of the original Dutch settlers of what later became New York, and later, by extension, to New Yorkers in general. In search of a head coach, Irish approached successful St. John&#x27;s University coach Joe Lapchick in May 1946. Lapchick readily accepted after Irish promised to make him the highest-paid coach in the league; however, he requested he remain at St. John&#x27;s one more season in hopes of winning one last championship. Irish obliged, hiring former Manhattan College coach Neil Cohalan as interim coach for the first year.

With no college draft in the league&#x27;s initial year, there was no guarantee that the Knicks or the league itself would thrive. Consequently, teams focused on signing college players from their respective cities as a way to promote the professional league. The Knicks held their first training camp in the Catskill Mountains at the Nevele Country Club. Twenty-five players were invited to attend the three-week session. Players worked out twice a day and the chemistry between the New York natives was instant. With a roster assembled, the Knicks faced the Toronto Huskies at Toronto&#x27;s Maple Leaf Gardens on November 1, 1946, in what would be the franchise&#x27;s first game—as well as the first in league history. In a low-scoring affair presented in front of 7,090 spectators, the Knicks defeated the Huskies 68–66 with Leo Gottlieb leading the Knicks in scoring with 14 points. With Madison Square Garden&#x27;s crowded schedule, the Knicks were forced to play many of their home games at the 69th Regiment Armory during the team&#x27;s early years. The Knicks went on to finish their inaugural campaign with a 33–27 record and achieved a playoff berth under Cohalan despite a dismal shooting percentage of 28 percent. The Knicks faced the Cleveland Rebels in the quarterfinals, winning the series 2–1. However, the Knicks were swept by the Philadelphia Warriors in two games in the semifinals.

As promised, Lapchick took over in 1947, bringing with him his up-tempo coaching style, which emphasized fast ball movement. Six new players were signed, including guard Carl Braun and Japanese-American guard Wataru Misaka, the first non-Caucasian basketball player in the BAA. Under Lapchick, the Knicks made nine straight playoff appearances beginning in 1947. Braun, who averaged 14.3 points, emerged as the team&#x27;s star and paired with Dick Holub and Bud Palmer to account for half of the team&#x27;s offense. Despite this, the Knicks struggled throughout the year, compiling a 26–22 record. Their finish was good enough to place them second in the Eastern Division and secure a playoff match-up against the Baltimore Bullets where they lost the series two games to one. In the 1948 NBA draft, the Knicks selected two future Hall of Fame players in center Dolph Schayes and Harry Gallatin. The Knicks were leery of Schayes&#x27; talent, prompting the center to leave to play for the Syracuse Nationals of the struggling National Basketball League. Despite losing Schayes, the team started the year well going 17–8 before they fell into a slump. They ended the year with a seven-game win streak to finish with a 32–28 record and a third-straight playoff appearance. The Knicks defeated the Bullets in a rematch of their previous encounter in 1947, winning the series 2–1. The team however struggled against the Washington Capitols and lost the series 1–2.
Prior to the beginning of the 1949–50 season, the BAA merged with the National Basketball League to form the National Basketball Association which comprised 17 teams. Despite division realignments, the Knicks remained in the Eastern Division. The team continued its dominance under Lapchick, winning 40 games; however they lost the Eastern Division finals to the Syracuse Nationals.

The following season, the Knicks made history signing Sweetwater Clifton to a contract, thus becoming the first professional basketball team to sign an African American player. During this same season, the Knicks finished with a 36–30 record. Though they placed third in their division, they secured a playoff spot and began the first of three consecutive trips to the NBA Finals. In spite of their success, the Knicks could not overcome the Rochester Royals despite a valiant comeback after losing the first three games of the Finals. The next two years, in 1952 and 1953, New York fell to the Minneapolis Lakers in the Finals.

It was during this early period, the Knicks developed their first standout players in Carl Braun who retired as the Knicks leading scorer with 10,449 points before later being surpassed by the likes of Patrick Ewing, Walt Frazier and Willis Reed. Harry Gallatin and Dick McGuire were also well-known standouts on the team and were later enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.

Following these back-to-back losses, the Knicks made the playoffs in the subsequent two years with no success. Lapchick resigned as the team&#x27;s head coach in January 1956 citing health-related issues. Vince Boryla made his debut in February 1956 as the Knicks&#x27; new coach in a win over the St. Louis Hawks. However, after two seasons of poor performances and no playoff appearances, Boryla tendered his resignation from the team in April 1958.

Looking to regain their former dominance, Andrew Levane was named the head coach and in his first year, the results were significantly better as the team finished with a 40–32 record, securing their playoff spot. However, the Knicks could not manage to get past the Eastern Division semi-finals. The Levane-led squad fared poorly to begin the 1959–60 season and under mounting pressure Levane resigned and was immediately replaced by Carl Braun, who became the team&#x27;s first player-coach. The team did not fare much better under Braun and the Knicks hired Eddie Donovan, who helped build up St. Bonaventure&#x27;s basketball team, in 1961. During Donovan&#x27;s tenure, New York failed to achieve a playoff berth. As a testament to their struggles, on March 2, 1962, the Knicks faced the Philadelphia Warriors in Hershey, Pennsylvania, where they infamously allowed Wilt Chamberlain to score an NBA-record 100 points in a 169–147 Warriors victory.

In 1964, the franchise&#x27;s fortunes began to take a steady turn. The Knicks drafted center Willis Reed, who made an immediate impact on the court and was named NBA Rookie of the Year for his efforts. However, the leaders of the team still remained in flux. In an attempt to reorganize, the Knicks named former standout Harry Gallatin as head coach while reassigning Donovan to general manager position. After a slow start in 1965, Dick McGuire, another former Knick, replaced his former teammate Gallatin midway through the season. Though he failed to guide the Knicks to the playoffs in 1965, he managed to do so the following season, however, the Knicks lost in the Eastern Division semi-finals.

===1967–1975: championship years===

The Knicks started their 1967–68 season with a 124–122 win over the visiting Warriors. In that game, seven players on the Knicks&#x27; roster scored in double figures. However, the Knicks lost their next six games, falling to a 1–6 record. They managed to stop their losing streak on November 1, 1967, when the Knicks won the road game against the Lakers, 129–113. During the game, Willis Reed scored a career-high 53 points on 21-of-29 shooting from the field. On November 3, the Knicks defeated the Seattle SuperSonics 134–100 in Seattle. In that game, nine Knicks&#x27; player scored at least 10 points. Head coach Dick McGuire was replaced midway through the 1967–68 season after the team began the season with a 15–22 record. With the Knicks under .500, the team decided to hire coach Red Holzman, whose impact was immediate. Under his direction, the Knicks went 28–17 and finished with a 43–39 record thus salvaging a playoff berth, however, the Knicks were again vanquished in the Eastern Division semi-finals by the Philadelphia 76ers. However their roster was slowly coming together piece by piece. Rookies Phil Jackson and Walt Frazier were named to the NBA All-Rookie Team while Dick Barnett and Willis Reed performed in the 1968 NBA All-Star Game.

The following season, the team acquired Dave DeBusschere from the Detroit Pistons, and the team went 54–28. In the playoffs, New York made it past the first round of contention for the first time since 1953, sweeping the Baltimore Bullets in four games, before falling to the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Division finals.

In the 1969–70 season, the Knicks had a then-single-season NBA record 18 straight victories en route to a 60–22 record, which was the best regular season record in the franchise&#x27;s history to that point. After defeating the Bullets in the Eastern Division semifinals and the Milwaukee Bucks in the Eastern Division finals, the Knicks faced the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA Finals. With the series tied at 2–2, the Knicks would be tested in Game 5. Willis Reed tore a muscle in his right leg in the second quarter, and was lost for the rest of the game. Despite his absence, New York went on to win the game, rallying from a 16-point deficit.

Without their injured captain the Knicks lost Game 6, setting up one of the most famous moments in NBA history. Reed limped onto the court before the seventh game, determined to play through the pain of his injury. He scored New York&#x27;s first two baskets before going scoreless for the remainder of the contest. Although he was not at full strength, Reed&#x27;s heroics inspired the Knicks, and they won the game by a score of 113–99, allowing New York to capture the title that had eluded them for so long. Reed, who had been named the All-Star MVP and the league&#x27;s MVP that season, was named MVP of the Finals, becoming the first player to attain all three awards in a single season.

The Knicks&#x27; success continued for the next few years. After losing to the Bullets in the 1971 Eastern Conference finals, the team, aided by the acquisitions of Jerry Lucas and Earl &quot;The Pearl&quot; Monroe, returned to the Finals in 1972. This time the Knicks fell to the Lakers in five games. The next year, the results were reversed, as the Knicks defeated the Lakers in five games to win their second NBA title in four years. The team had one more impressive season in 1973–74, as they reached the Eastern Conference finals, where they fell in five games to the Celtics. It was after this season that Willis Reed announced his retirement, and the team&#x27;s fortunes began to shift once more.

===1975–1985: post-championship years===
In the 1974–75 season, the Knicks posted a 40–42 record, their first losing record in eight seasons. The team still qualified for a playoff spot, however, but they lost to the Houston Rockets in the first round. After two more seasons with losing records, Holzman was replaced by Willis Reed, who signed a three-year contract. In Reed&#x27;s first year, New York finished the year with a 43–39 record and returned to the Eastern Conference semi-finals, where they were swept by the Philadelphia 76ers. The next season, after the team began with a 6–8 record, Holzman was rehired as the team&#x27;s coach after Reed had angered Madison Square Garden president Sonny Werblin. The team did not fare any better under Holzman&#x27;s direction, finishing with a 31–51 record, their worst in thirteen years.

After improving to a 39–43 record in the 1979–80 season, the Knicks posted a 50–32 record in the 1980–81 season. In the playoffs, the Chicago Bulls swept New York in two games. Holzman retired the following season as one of the winningest coaches in NBA history. The team&#x27;s record that year was a dismal 33–49. However, Holzman&#x27;s legacy would continue through the players he influenced. One of the Knicks&#x27; bench players and defensive specialists during the 1970s was Phil Jackson. Jackson went on to coach the Chicago Bulls and Los Angeles Lakers to 11 NBA championships, surpassing Red Auerbach for the most in NBA history. Jackson cited Holzman as a significant influence on his career in the NBA.

Hubie Brown replaced Holzman as head coach and in his first season, the team went 44–38 and made it to the second round of the playoffs, where they were swept by the eventual champion Philadelphia 76ers. The next season, the team, aided by new acquisition Bernard King, improved to 47–35 and returned to the playoffs. The team defeated the Detroit Pistons in the first round with an overtime win in the fifth and deciding game, before losing in the second round in seven games to the Celtics. The team&#x27;s struggles continued into the 1984–85 season, as they lost their last 12 games to finish with a 24–58 record. The first of these losses occurred on March 23, 1985, where King injured his knee and spent the next 24 months in rehabilitation.

===1985–2000: the Patrick Ewing era===

In the summer of 1985, the Knicks were entered into the first-ever NBA draft lottery. The Knicks ended up winning the number one pick in that year&#x27;s NBA draft. They used the pick to select star center Patrick Ewing of Georgetown University. In Ewing&#x27;s first season with the Knicks, he led all rookies in scoring (20 points per game) and rebounds (9 rebounds per game), and he won the NBA Rookie of the Year Award. The team would not fare as well, though, as they struggled to a 23–59 record in his first season.

During Ewing&#x27;s second season, the team started with a 4–12 record and head coach Hubie Brown was dismissed in favor of assistant Bob Hill. Under Hill, the Knicks had brief successes but went on to lose seventeen of their twenty-one final games of the season to finish 20–46 under Hill and 24–58 on the season. Hill was dismissed at season&#x27;s end.

The team immediately turned around in the 1987–88 season with the hiring of Rick Pitino as head coach, who, only months prior to his hiring, led Providence College to the Final Four, turning around a program that had struggled prior to his arrival. Combined with the selection of point guard Mark Jackson, who won the NBA Rookie of the Year Award and garnered MVP consideration, in the draft and with Ewing&#x27;s consistently stellar play, the Knicks made the playoffs with a record of 38–44, where they were defeated by the Celtics in the first round.

The resurgence continued the following season as the team traded backup center Bill Cartwright to the Bulls for power forward Charles Oakley before the season started and then posted a 52–30 record, which was good enough for their first division title in 18 years and their fifth division title in franchise history. In the playoffs, they defeated the 76ers in the first round before losing to the Chicago Bulls in the Eastern Conference semi-finals.

Prior to the start of the 1989–90 season, Pitino departed from New York to coach for the University of Kentucky leaving many stunned by his departure. Assistant Stu Jackson was named as Pitino&#x27;s replacement becoming the team&#x27;s 14th head coach and the youngest head coach in the NBA, at the time, at the age of 32. Under Jackson&#x27;s direction, the Knicks went 45–37 and defeated the Celtics in the first round of the playoffs, winning the final three games after losing the first two. They went on to lose to the eventual NBA champion Detroit Pistons in the next round. Jackson and the Knicks struggled to a 7–8 record to begin the 1990–91 season and Jackson was replaced by John MacLeod who led the Knicks to a 32–35 record, ending the season with a 39–43 record overall that was good enough to earn the team another playoff appearance. The Knicks were swept in the first round by the eventual NBA champion, Chicago Bulls.

====1991–1996: the Pat Riley/Don Nelson years====
After the conclusion of the season, MacLeod left the team to become the head coach at the University of Notre Dame. President David Checketts reached out to Pat Riley, who was working as a commentator for the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), to see if he was interested in returning to coaching. Riley accepted the Knicks proposition on May 31, 1991. Riley, who coached the Lakers to four NBA titles during the 1980s, implemented a rough and physical style emphasizing defense. Under Riley, the team, led by Ewing and guard John Starks, who scored 24 points per game and 13.9 points per game respectively, improved to a 51–31 record, tying them for first place in the Atlantic Division. After defeating the Pistons in the first round of the playoffs, the team faced the Bulls, losing the series 4–3 in seven games. The 1992–93 season proved to be even more successful, as the Knicks won the Atlantic Division with a 60–22 record. Before the season, the Knicks traded Mark Jackson to the Los Angeles Clippers for Charles Smith, Doc Rivers, and Bo Kimble while also acquiring Rolando Blackman from the Dallas Mavericks. After defeating the Indiana Pacers and Charlotte Hornets in the first two rounds of the playoffs, the Knicks made it to the Eastern Conference finals, where once again they met the Bulls. After taking a 2–0 series lead, the Knicks lost the next four games.

After the Bulls&#x27; Michael Jordan made what would be his first retirement from basketball prior to the 1993–94 season, many saw this as an opportunity for the Knicks to finally make it to the NBA Finals. The team, who acquired Derek Harper in a midseason trade with the Dallas Mavericks, once again won the Atlantic Division with a 57–25 record. In the playoffs, the team played a then NBA-record 25 games (the Boston Celtics played 26 games in the 2008 playoffs); they started by defeating the New Jersey Nets in the first round before finally getting past the Bulls, defeating them in the second round in seven games. In the Eastern Conference Finals, they faced the Indiana Pacers, who at one point held a three games-to-two lead. They had this advantage thanks to the exploits of Reggie Miller, who scored 25 fourth-quarter points in Game 5 to lead the Pacers to victory. However, the Knicks won the next two games to reach their first NBA Finals since 1973.

In the finals, the Knicks would play seven low-scoring, defensive games against the Houston Rockets. After splitting the first two games in Houston, the Knicks would win two out of three games at Madison Square Garden, which also hosted the New York Rangers first Stanley Cup celebration in 54 years following their win over the Vancouver Canucks in Game 7 of their finals during the series. (A Knicks win would have made the Garden the first building to host a Cup winner and an NBA champ in the same season.) In Game 6, however, a last-second attempt at a game-winning shot by Starks was tipped by Rockets center Hakeem Olajuwon, giving the Rockets an 86–84 victory and forcing a Game 7. The Knicks lost Game 7 90–84, credited in large part to Starks&#x27;s dismal 2-for-18 shooting performance and Riley&#x27;s stubborn refusal to bench Starks, despite having bench players who were renowned for their shooting prowess, such as Rolando Blackman and Hubert Davis available. The loss denied New York the distinction of having both NBA and NHL championships in the same year. Nevertheless, the Knicks had gotten some inspiration from Mark Messier and the Rangers during the finals.

The next year, the Knicks were second place in the Atlantic Division with a 55–27 record. The team defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers before facing the Pacers again in the second round. The tone for the Knicks–Pacers series was set in Game 1, as Miller once again became a clutch nuisance to the Knicks by scoring eight points in the final 8 seconds of the game to give the Pacers a 107–105 victory. The series went to a Game 7, and when Patrick Ewing&#x27;s last-second finger roll attempt to tie the game missed, the Pacers clinched the 97–95 win. Riley resigned the next day, and the Knicks hired Don Nelson as their new head coach.

While Nelson had been a successful coach before joining the Knicks, his offensive-oriented Nellie Ball philosophy failed to mesh with the team, and during the 1995–96 season, Nelson was fired after 59 games, and, instead of going after another well-known coach, the Knicks hired longtime assistant Jeff Van Gundy, who had no prior experience as a head coach. Van Gundy, who restored the team&#x27;s defense-first style of his mentor Pat Riley, went 13–10 the rest of the way. The Knicks ended up with a 47–35 record that year, and swept the Cavaliers in the first round of the playoffs before losing to the eventual champion Bulls (who had an NBA record 72 wins in the regular season) in five games.

====1996–2000: the Jeff Van Gundy years====
In the 1996–97 season, the Knicks, with the additions of such players as Larry Johnson and Allan Houston, registered a 57–25 record. In the playoffs, the Knicks swept the Charlotte Hornets in the first round before facing the Miami Heat (coached by Riley) in the second round. The Knicks took a 3–1 lead in the series before a brawl near the end of Game 5 resulted in suspensions of key players. Many of the suspended Knicks players, Ewing in particular, were disciplined not for participating in the altercation itself, but for violating an NBA rule stipulating that a benched player may not leave the bench during a fight (the rule was subsequently amended, making it illegal to leave the &quot;bench area&quot;). With Ewing and Houston suspended for Game 6, Johnson and Starks suspended for Game 7, and Charlie Ward suspended for both, the Knicks lost the series.

The 1997–98 season was marred by a wrist injury to Ewing on December 22, which forced him to miss the rest of the season and much of the playoffs. The team, which had a 43–39 record that season, still managed to defeat the Heat in the first round (a series, which saw another violent bench-clearing brawl at the end of Game 4, this time between Johnson and former Hornets teammate Alonzo Mourning) of the playoffs before having another meeting with the Pacers in the second round. Ewing returned in time for game two of the series. This time, the Pacers easily won the series in five games, as Reggie Miller once again broke the hearts of Knicks fans by hitting a tying three-pointer with 5.1 seconds remaining in Game 4, en route to a Pacers overtime victory. For the fourth straight year, the Knicks were eliminated in the second round of the playoffs.

Prior to the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season, the Knicks traded Charles Oakley to the Toronto Raptors for Marcus Camby while also trading John Starks in a package to the Golden State Warriors for 1994&#x27;s 1st team all-league shooting guard Latrell Sprewell (whose contract was voided by the Warriors after choking Warriors&#x27; head coach P. J. Carlesimo during the previous season). After barely getting into the playoffs with a 27–23 record, the Knicks started a Cinderella run. It started with the Knicks eliminating the #1 seeded Heat in the first round after Allan Houston bounced in a running one-hander off the front of the rim, high off the backboard, and in with 0.8 seconds left in the deciding 5th game. This remarkable upset marked only the second time in NBA history that an 8-seed had defeated the 1-seed in the NBA playoffs, and also the first time it happened in the Eastern Conference. After defeating the Atlanta Hawks in the second round four games to none, they faced the Pacers yet again in the Eastern Conference Finals. Despite losing Ewing to injury for the rest of the playoffs prior to Game 3, the Knicks won the series (aided in part to a four-point play by Larry Johnson in the final seconds of Game 3) to become the first eighth-seeded playoff team to make it to the NBA Finals. However, in the Finals, the San Antonio Spurs, with superstars David Robinson and Tim Duncan, proved too much for the injury-laden Knicks, who lost in five games. The remarkable fifth game of this Finals is remembered for its 2nd half scoring duel between the Spurs&#x27; Tim Duncan and the Knicks&#x27; Latrell Sprewell, and was decided by a long jumper by Avery Johnson with 47 seconds left to clinch the title for the Spurs.

The 1999–2000 season, would prove to be the last one in New York for Ewing, as the Knicks, who had a 50–32 record that season swept the Toronto Raptors a team led by Vince Carter, Antonio Davis and a young Tracy McGrady in three games in the first round, defeated the Miami Heat in another dramatic seven-game series in which Ewing&#x27;s dunk with over a minute remaining in game 7, provided the winning margin in a 1-point road victory. They would, however, lose in the Eastern Conference Finals to the Reggie Miller-led Indiana Pacers in six games. After the season, Ewing was traded on September 20, 2000, to the Seattle SuperSonics, and the Ewing era, which produced many successful playoff appearances but no NBA championship titles, came to an end.

===2000–2003: downfall===

Despite the loss of Ewing, the Knicks remained successful in the regular season, as they posted a 48–34 record under the direction of Houston and Sprewell. In the first round of playoff contention, however, New York fell to the Toronto Raptors in five games, failing to get past the first round of the playoffs for the first time in a decade. After a poor start to the season, the Knicks managed to get above .500 with a 10–9 record. In spite of their recent success, Van Gundy unexpectedly resigned as head coach on December 8, 2001, explaining he had &quot;lost focus&quot; and would no longer be able to properly coach the team. The team, which named longtime assistant Don Chaney as their new head coach, ended the season with a 30–52 record, and for the first time since the 1986–87 season they did not qualify for the playoffs.

In October 2002, the team elected to extend Chaney&#x27;s contract for another year. Rather than rebuilding, the Knicks opted to add veterans to the roster including Antonio McDyess who had been dealing with knee problems in the preceding years. Furthermore, the Knicks were criticized by many analysts as multiple players on the roster were overpaid in light of their poor performances, causing salary cap problems that would persist until Donnie Walsh took over as team president. McDyess injured his knee during the team&#x27;s third preseason game and was subjected to further operations in April 2003 after a CT scan revealed the injured knee necessitated he undergo bone-graft surgery. The Knicks managed only seven wins in their first twenty games, setting the tone for the rest of the season, which they completed with a 37–45 record; it was their second consecutive season without a playoff appearance.

===2003–2008: Isiah Thomas era===

After a 10–18 start to the 2003–04 season, the Knicks underwent a massive overhaul. Isiah Thomas was named the Knicks&#x27; president on December 22, 2003, upon the firing of Scott Layden. Thomas continued to restructure the team, firing Chaney after an unproductive tenure and hiring Hall of Famer Lenny Wilkens to coach the team. Additionally, Thomas orchestrated multiple trades, including one that brought point guard Stephon Marbury to the team. The team qualified for the playoffs that year with a 39–43 record, but were swept by the New Jersey Nets in the first round. The series included a highly publicized spat between the Knicks&#x27; Tim Thomas and Nets&#x27; Kenyon Martin, in which Thomas all but challenged Martin to a fight and called him &quot;Fugazy&quot;. The following season, the Knicks struggled to a 17–22 record before Wilkens resigned as head coach. Herb Williams, who had previously coached the team in a game against the Orlando Magic prior to the team hiring Wilkens, took over as interim head coach for the remainder of the season and did not fare much better as the Knicks ended their season with a 33–49 record and out of playoff contention.

Hoping to find a leader that could put the team back on track, New York hired Larry Brown to coach the team. Brown, who idolized the team during his childhood, was well regarded for his coaching abilities and his arrival brought a sense of hope to the franchise. Hoping to find the next Patrick Ewing, the Knicks drafted center Channing Frye and signed centers Jerome James and Eddy Curry, the former prior to the season and the latter during the season. Curry, who reportedly had a worrying heart condition, refused to take a controversial DNA test, and fell out of favor with John Paxson, Chicago&#x27;s general manager. The Bulls signed-and-traded him to the Knicks along with Antonio Davis for Tim Thomas, Michael Sweetney, the Knicks&#x27; 2006 first-round pick, and the right to swap first-round picks with the Knicks in 2007, as well as 2007 and 2009 second-round picks. Isiah Thomas did not lottery-protect the picks, and the Knicks forfeited the second pick in the 2006 draft, and the ninth in the 2007 draft. With a bloated payroll, the Knicks stumbled to the second worst record in the NBA that season, at 23–59. The season concluded with the firing and $18.5 million buy-out of head coach Larry Brown after one season.
With the departure of Brown, team president Isiah Thomas took over the head coaching responsibilities. Thomas continued his practice of signing players to high-priced contracts while the franchise struggled to capitalize on their talent on the court. As a testament to their struggles, on December 16, 2006, the Knicks and the Denver Nuggets broke into a brawl during their game in Madison Square Garden. With multiple players still serving a suspension as a result of the brawl, on December 20, 2006, David Lee created one of the most memorable plays in recent Knicks history, and served as a bright spot as the team&#x27;s struggles persisted, during a game against the Charlotte Bobcats. With a tie game and 0.1 seconds left on the game clock in double overtime, Jamal Crawford inbounded from the sideline, near half-court. The ball sailed towards the basket, and with that 0.1 seconds still remaining on the game clock, Lee tipped the ball off of the backboard and into the hoop. Because of the Trent Tucker Rule, a player is allowed solely to tip the ball to score when the ball is put back into play with three-tenths of a second or less remaining. Because of this rule, the rarity of Lee&#x27;s play increases. The Knicks won, 111–109 in double overtime. The Knicks improved by ten games in the 2006–2007 campaign in spite of injuries that ravaged the team at the end of the year; they ended with a 33–49 record, avoiding a 50-loss season by defeating the Charlotte Bobcats 94–93 on the last day of the season.

During the 2007 off-season, the organization became embroiled in further controversy away from the basketball court. Anucha Browne Sanders, a former Knicks executive, had filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against Isiah Thomas and Madison Square Garden. Faced with a trial, the jury returned a verdict finding Thomas and Madison Square Garden liable for sexual harassment. The jury also levied $11.6 million in punitive damages against Madison Square Garden, though this was later reduced to $11.5 million in a settlement between both parties. The ordeal proved embarrassing for the franchise, revealing sordid details about Knicks management and the environment at Madison Square Garden. The Knicks struggled as they opened their 2007 campaign with a 2–9 record leaving many Knicks fans, frustrated with the franchise&#x27;s lack of progress under Thomas, called for the coach&#x27;s firing—the chant &quot;Fire Isiah&quot; became a common occurrence during the Knicks&#x27; home games. On November 29, 2007, the Knicks were handed one of their worst defeats in their history by the Boston Celtics, with a final score of 104–59. This matched their third-largest margin of defeat. New York went on to post an eighth consecutive losing season and tied the franchise mark for their worst record ever, at 23–59.

===2008–2010: rebuilding===
MSG chairman James Dolan hired former Indiana Pacers President Donnie Walsh on April 2, 2008, to take over Isiah Thomas&#x27;s role as team president. At the introductory press conference, Walsh, while not proclaiming to be a savior, did set goals, which included getting the team under the salary cap and bringing back a competitive environment. Upon the conclusion of the 2007–2008 regular season, Walsh fired Thomas, and on May 13, 2008, officially named former Phoenix Suns head coach Mike D&#x27;Antoni as head coach. D&#x27;Antoni signed a four-year, $24 million deal to coach the team. The Knicks, holding the sixth pick in the 2008 NBA draft, selected Danilo Gallinari on May 20, 2008.

On November 21, 2008, the Knicks dealt one of their top scorers, Jamal Crawford, to the Golden State Warriors for Al Harrington. Hours later, New York traded Zach Randolph, along with Mardy Collins, to the Los Angeles Clippers for Cuttino Mobley and Tim Thomas, with the intention of freeing cap space for the 2010 off-season, when top-flight players such as LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh, and Amar&#x27;e Stoudemire would be available. In February 2009, the Knicks traded Tim Thomas, Jerome James, and Anthony Roberson to the Chicago Bulls for Larry Hughes, in addition to sending Malik Rose to the Oklahoma City Thunder for Chris Wilcox.

Additionally, the long-standing controversy with Stephon Marbury ended when the two sides agreed to a buy-out of Marbury&#x27;s contract, which allowed him to sign with the Celtics when he cleared waivers on February 27, 2009. In spite of a volatile roster, the Knicks improved by nine wins from the previous season in D&#x27;Antoni&#x27;s first season, to finish 32–50, coinciding with the emergence of forward-center David Lee, who led the league with 65 double-doubles, and the continued development of guard Nate Robinson and swingman Wilson Chandler.

In the 2009 NBA draft, the Knicks selected forward Jordan Hill eighth after targets such as Stephen Curry, Jonny Flynn, and Ricky Rubio were off the board. Guard Toney Douglas was then selected with a 29th overall pick, which was acquired from the Los Angeles Lakers. Shortly afterwards, New York executed a trade with the Memphis Grizzlies in which the Knicks acquired Darko Miličić in exchange for Quentin Richardson. The Knicks got off to their worst 10-game start in franchise history, producing nine losses, with just one win. The Knicks responded by winning nine games and losing six in December. On January 24, 2010, the Knicks suffered their worst home loss in Madison Square Garden history against the Dallas Mavericks in front of a sellout crowd. The 50-point loss was also the second-worst in Knicks franchise history.

On February 17, the Knicks shook up the roster, trading Miličić to the Minnesota Timberwolves for Brian Cardinal and cash considerations. A day later, the Knicks and Celtics swapped guard Nate Robinson for shooting guard Eddie House. The deal also included forward Marcus Landry going to the Celtics and the Knicks acquiring bench players J. R. Giddens and Bill Walker. The Knicks also acquired All-Star forward Tracy McGrady from the Houston Rockets and point guard Sergio Rodríguez from the Sacramento Kings in a three-way trade. The deal sent Knicks shooting guard Larry Hughes to Sacramento and forward Jordan Hill and power forward Jared Jeffries to Houston. The trades, orchestrated to give the Knicks more cap space for the summer of 2010, netted the Knicks $30 million of cap space. About three weeks after these team-changing trades, the Knicks played the Dallas Mavericks at American Airlines Center and blew them out by a score of 128–94 for their largest win of the season. However, the Knicks were eliminated from playoff contention in late March 2010 and completed their season with a 29–53 record, a regression from their first season under D&#x27;Antoni.

===2010–2013: arrival of Carmelo Anthony===

The Knicks and former Phoenix Suns forward-center Amar&#x27;e Stoudemire came to an agreement on July 5, 2010. The sign and trade deal was made official on July 8 as Stoudemire agreed to an approximately $100 million contract over the span of five years. Team president Donnie Walsh stated the signing of Stoudemire as a turning point for the future of a Knicks team that had struggled in recent years. The Knicks continued to redesign their roster, trading David Lee to the Golden State Warriors for Anthony Randolph, Kelenna Azubuike and Ronny Turiaf. The Knicks also struck deals with former Bobcats point guard Raymond Felton and Russian center Timofey Mozgov. The Knicks regained their title as the most valuable franchise in the NBA following these acquisitions, though this was mainly due to the arrival of Stoudemire, whose star power allowed the team to resurge; the Knicks sold out their full-season ticket inventory for the first time since 2002.

D&#x27;Antoni along with Stoudemire and the core of young players, including Felton, Danilo Gallinari, Mozgov, Wilson Chandler and rookie Landry Fields, piloted the Knicks to a 28–26 record prior to the All-Star break, marking the first time the team had been above the .500 mark at that point of the season since 2000. In spite of the team&#x27;s mounting success, New York made a push to acquire Denver Nuggets forward Carmelo Anthony. After months of speculation, on February 22, 2011, Anthony was traded to New York, with teammates Chauncey Billups, Shelden Williams, Anthony Carter, and former Knicks player Renaldo Balkman. Denver acquired Felton, Danilo Gallinari, Wilson Chandler, Mozgov, Kosta Koufos, a 2014 first-round draft pick, the Warriors&#x27; second-round draft picks for 2013 and 2014 and $3 million in cash. In addition, the Knicks sent Anthony Randolph and Eddy Curry to the Minnesota Timberwolves and in return the Timberwolves&#x27; Corey Brewer was sent to the Knicks.

The Knicks clinched their first playoff berth since the 2004 NBA playoffs in a rout of the Cleveland Cavaliers on April 3, 2011. Carmelo Anthony ensured the franchise&#x27;s first winning season since 2001 on April 10, 2011, against the Indiana Pacers, as Anthony scored the game-winning basket for the Knicks and subsequently blocked Danny Granger&#x27;s shot in the final seconds of the game. The Knicks were ultimately eliminated from contention in the first round on April 24, 2011, by the Boston Celtics, losing the series 0–4. In spite of Donnie Walsh&#x27;s successful efforts to help rebuild the franchise, he decided not to return as the team&#x27;s president, electing to step down at the end of June 2011, citing the uncertainty surrounding his ability to continue to manage the daily operations of the team. Glen Grunwald was elected as interim president and general manager.

Following the conclusion of the 2011 NBA lockout, the Knicks engaged in a sign-and-trade deal with the Mavericks for center Tyson Chandler on December 10, 2011, with Chandler signing a four-year contract worth approximately $58 million. In return, the Knicks sent Andy Rautins to the Mavericks, generating a trade exception for Dallas. Ronny Turiaf and $3 million in cash considerations were sent to the Wizards to complete the three-way trade. The Knicks also obtained the draft rights to Ahmad Nivins and Georgios Printezis from Dallas. In order to fit Chandler under the salary cap, Chauncey Billups was earlier waived under the amnesty clause of the new collective bargaining agreement. To replace Billups at point guard, the Knicks signed Mike Bibby to a one-year, veteran minimum contract. The Knicks also signed veteran point guard Baron Davis on December 19 to a one-year contract. At the time, Davis had suffered a herniated disk and was not expected to compete for about 6–8 weeks, leaving Toney Douglas as the team&#x27;s starting point guard. The Knicks struggled early in the season because Douglas and Bibby struggled to facilitate the offense and subsequently, it became stagnated. Subsequently, rookie Iman Shumpert was thrust into the role as the starting point guard after Douglas was relegated to the bench due to his struggles. In addition, head coach D&#x27;Antoni also decided to use Carmelo Anthony as a point forward to help generate a more up-tempo offense; however, there were concerns Anthony was holding the ball for too long, thus contributing to the stagnation of the Knicks&#x27; offense.

====&quot;Linsanity&quot;====

With the Knicks struggling to an 8–15 record, D&#x27;Antoni inserted third-string point guard Jeremy Lin into the rotation against the New Jersey Nets on February 4, 2012. Lin, who had been claimed off waivers on December 27 following an injury to Iman Shumpert, scored 25 points and had seven assists en route to a Knicks win. Lin was praised for his ability to facilitate the offense, something the Knicks had struggled to do for the first 23 games of the season. Lin, exceeding expectations, was named the starter for the Knicks following a game against the Utah Jazz. Lin guided the Knicks to a seven-game winning streak, despite being without Anthony and Amar&#x27;e Stoudemire for five games due to a groin injury and a death in the family respectively, that brought the team back to a .500 winning percentage. The surge of positive play by the Knicks accompanied by the performance of Lin caused extensive national and worldwide media coverage that was referred to as &quot;Linsanity&quot;. To bolster their depth and perimeter shooting percentage, the Knicks signed J. R. Smith on February 18, 2012. The team struggled to congeal when Anthony returned from injury and went on to lose seven of eight games before head coach Mike D&#x27;Antoni resigned on March 14, 2012. Assistant Mike Woodson was named the interim head coach.

====Under Mike Woodson====

Under Woodson, the Knicks finished 18–6 during the regular season and clinched a playoff spot for the second straight year this time as the seventh seed, making it the first time they have clinched consecutive playoff berths since making 13 straight playoff appearances from 1988 to 2001. Not only did they also clinch consecutive winning seasons for the first time in a decade, but their 36–30 record was the highest winning percentage for the team since the 2000–01 season. The Knicks faced the Miami Heat in the first round of the playoffs and lost the first three games, breaking the NBA record for longest playoff losing streak at 13 games. The team&#x27;s struggles were partially attributed to injuries as Jeremy Lin, Baron Davis and Iman Shumpert were all sidelined by knee ailments. The Knicks proceeded to win a close Game 4, which snapped their streak and ensured that they would not be swept out of the first round; however, they failed to keep up with the Heat&#x27;s up-tempo offense in Game 5 and lost the series 4–1. Despite the team&#x27;s disappointing postseason exit, the Knicks removed Woodson&#x27;s interim status and he was officially named the full-time head coach on May 25, 2012.

The Knicks began their off-season by selecting Greek forward Kostas Papanikolaou in the 2012 NBA draft. One week later, the team came to terms with veteran point guard Jason Kidd, who was originally supposed to serve as a backup to Lin. The Knicks also re-acquired Marcus Camby from the Houston Rockets in a sign and trade sending Houston Josh Harrellson, Jerome Jordan, Toney Douglas and 2014 and 2015 two second-round picks and completed a sign-and-trade with the Portland Trail Blazers that brought back Raymond Felton and Kurt Thomas in exchange for Jared Jeffries, Dan Gadzuric, and the draft rights to Papanikolaou and Greek forward Georgios Printezis, whose draft rights had been acquired by the Knicks in December 2011. The Knicks also re-signed free agents J. R. Smith and Steve Novak and added more players to the roster, such as James White, Chris Copeland, and Argentinian point guard Pablo Prigioni. However the Knicks lost restricted free agents shooting guard, Landry Fields to the Toronto Raptors and point guard, Jeremy Lin to the Houston Rockets, who were both key players during the 2011–12 season. The Knicks decided not to match those teams&#x27; offers. Despite these losses, the Knicks continued to add players to the roster, signing former Chicago Bulls guard Ronnie Brewer on July 25, 2012, and signing Chris Smith, the younger brother of J. R. Smith, on August 1, 2012. It was also announced that Rasheed Wallace would come out of retirement to play for the Knicks on October 2, 2012.

Despite playing without an injured Iman Shumpert and Amar&#x27;e Stoudemire, the Knicks compiled an 18–5 record to start the season, their best start since 1993. In their first four games, they scored at least 100 points and won by double digits in all of those games. The streak ended after a 10-point loss to Memphis Grizzlies. The following Sunday, in a game against the Indiana Pacers, the Knicks at home went on to win 88–76, assuring them a 7–1 record. After two tough losses to the Dallas Mavericks and Houston Rockets, the Knicks returned home in a game against the Detroit Pistons on November 25, with a 121–100 blowout win, making them one of only three teams undefeated at home along with the Miami Heat and Utah Jazz. The Knicks finished November with an 11–4 record, their best month record since going 11–6 in March 2000. By the All-Star break in mid-February 2013, the Knicks compiled a 32–18 record, good for second in the Eastern Conference. On February 21, on the trade deadline, the team traded Ronnie Brewer for a 2014 second-round draft pick. The Knicks then signed veteran power forward Kenyon Martin to a 10-day contract. In late March, the Knicks went on to compile a four-game losing streak, tying their worst skid of the season. They would go on and face the Jazz on the road, eventually winning the game and starting what would turn out to be a 13-game winning streak, including wins against the Miami Heat and the Oklahoma City Thunder. This was the third-longest winning streak in franchise history. On April 9, the Knicks beat the Washington Wizards to secure the Atlantic Division title for the first time since the 1993–94 NBA season. The Knicks&#x27; 13-game winning streak came to an end on April 11 as they lost to the Chicago Bulls. Despite that, they set the NBA single-season record for three-pointers. On May 3, the Knicks defeated the Boston Celtics in the first round of the NBA playoffs, 4–2, their first playoff victory since 2000. On May 18, the Knicks were eliminated in the second round of the playoffs, losing the series to the Indiana Pacers 4–2. Point guard Jason Kidd retired following the end of the season—he was named head coach of the Brooklyn Nets a few days later. In the 2013 NBA draft, the Knicks selected Tim Hardaway Jr. as the 24th pick in the first round. During the 2013 off-season, The Knicks claimed Los Angeles Lakers F Metta World Peace off of waivers. They re-signed J. R. Smith to a 3-year, $18 million deal and traded Quentin Richardson, Steve Novak, Marcus Camby, and three draft picks to acquire Andrea Bargnani from the Toronto Raptors.

===2013–2017: Phil Jackson era===
The Knicks also saw changes to business operations in late 2013, replacing general manager Glen Grunwald with former MSG president Steve Mills. The Knicks also purchased an NBA D-League team located White Plains, which began operations at the start of the 2014–15 NBDL season. The Knicks then appointed former coach Phil Jackson as president of basketball operations, with Mills remaining as general manager, with the duo working directly under MSG chairman James Dolan. Following the 2013–14 season, coach Mike Woodson and his entire staff were fired, and was replaced by Derek Fisher. Fisher played under Jackson with the Los Angeles Lakers, winning five NBA championships with the franchise. The Knicks finished the season with a disappointing 37–45 record and finished ninth in the Eastern Conference, but was the season Carmelo Anthony established his career high, the Knicks&#x27; franchise record, and the Madison Square Garden record for single-game scoring. Anthony recorded 62 points and 13 rebounds in a victory against the Charlotte Bobcats.
&quot;Forbes&quot; magazine released its franchise value rankings for NBA teams, and listed the Knicks as the world&#x27;s most valuable basketball organization at $1.4 billion in 2014, edging out the Los Angeles Lakers by $50 million. The Knicks were valued at 40% more than the third-place Chicago Bulls valuation of $1 billion, and were valued nearly twice as highly as their crosstown rivals, the Brooklyn Nets, who came in at $780 million.

In the off-season, the Knicks traded controversial guard Raymond Felton, along with former NBA defensive player of the year, Tyson Chandler, to the Dallas Mavericks. In return, the Knicks received Shane Larkin, José Calderón, Samuel Dalembert, and Wayne Ellington along with two picks for the 2014 NBA draft. The trade was the first one that Jackson ever executed as a front office executive. On June 26, as part of the draft, the Knicks selected Cleanthony Early as the 34th overall pick, and Thanasis Antetokounmpo as the 51st overall pick, using the draft picks received in the trade from the Mavericks. The Knicks also acquired Louis Labeyrie, an additional second-round draft pick, in a trade with the Indiana Pacers for cash considerations.

The Knicks would then go onto set a franchise record with its 13th consecutive loss, losing 101–91 to the Washington Wizards, giving New York its longest losing streak in the franchise&#x27;s 69-season history. This record was extended to 16th consecutive losses, after the NBA Global Games loss against the Milwaukee Bucks in London. The Knicks would finish the 2014–15 season with a win–loss record of 17–65, the worst record in franchise history, and allowed them to gain the 4th overall selection in the upcoming draft. The Knicks also bought out Amar&#x27;e Stoudemire&#x27;s $100 million contract a season early.

On June 24, 2015, the Knicks selected Kristaps Porziņģis with the fourth overall pick in the draft, and traded Tim Hardaway Jr. to the Atlanta Hawks in exchange for Jerian Grant, the 19th overall pick. Midway through another losing season, Fisher was relieved of his coaching duties, with Kurt Rambis being named as interim head coach as the Knicks finished the season with a record of 32–50. Jeff Hornacek was then hired as their next head coach, which also oversaw Jackson&#x27;s most notable acts as an executive. On June 22, former NBA MVP Derrick Rose was traded, along with Justin Holiday and a second-round pick from Chicago, to New York in exchange for Robin Lopez, José Calderón and Grant. The Knicks also signed Joakim Noah, Brandon Jennings, and Courtney Lee to contracts worth a combined $127 million, and regressed the following season, causing the franchise to part ways with Jackson after three years as the Knicks&#x27; president of basketball operations. Under Jackson&#x27;s presidency, the Knicks had gone 80–166, suffered three consecutive losing seasons, and missed three consecutive playoffs.

In his last act prior to leaving the Knicks, Jackson selected Frank Ntilikina with the eighth overall pick, Damyean Dotson with the 44th overall pick, and Ognjen Jaramaz with the 58th overall pick in the 2017 NBA draft.

===2017–2020: further struggles===
Following Jackson&#x27;s departure, the Knicks appointed Scott Perry as general manager and named Steve Mills president of basketball operations. The Knicks also saw Carmelo Anthony demanding a trade from the team, which posed difficulty for both player and franchise due to a no-trade clause inserted in Anthony&#x27;s contract given by Jackson in 2013. Originally, the only teams for which he would waive his no-trade clause were for the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Houston Rockets, with the former eventually removed from trade discussions due to internal conflicts. Anthony intended to join the Rockets, with a three-way trade with the Portland Trail Blazers set up involving Ryan Anderson. Anderson&#x27;s three-year, $60 million contract was not feasibly able to be absorbed by either franchise, however, causing Perry to cease talks with the Rockets, before agreeing to a deal with the Oklahoma City Thunder, after Anthony agreed to expand his no-trade clause to include the Thunder. The Knicks received Enes Kanter, Doug McDermott and a 2018 second-round pick in exchange for Anthony on September 25, 2017, while also positioning Kristaps Porziņģis as the new centerpiece of the franchise.

The Knicks also re-signed Tim Hardaway Jr. to a four-year, $71 million contract, while also agreeing to a one-year, minimum contract with Michael Beasley. The franchise also traded for former lottery pick Emmanuel Mudiay from the Denver Nuggets at the trade deadline, who was a point guard the Knicks were rumored to have targeted prior to selecting Porziņģis in 2015. The trade also included the Dallas Mavericks, with Dallas acquiring McDermott from the Knicks, and the Nuggets obtaining Devin Harris from Dallas. However, the season again ended poorly, with 29–53 record to leave the Knicks as the 11th seed in the Eastern Conference. This caused the Knicks to part ways with head coach Jeff Hornacek. Hornacek&#x27;s two full seasons retained criticism for the team&#x27;s continued struggle on defense, as well as the inability to implement an efficient, modern offense. He was replaced with former Memphis Grizzlies head coach David Fizdale. Fizdale signed a four-year deal, and was tasked to deliver on player development and improving the team&#x27;s basketball philosophy.

On May 15, 2018, the Knicks were awarded the ninth overall pick in the 2018 NBA draft, and selected Kevin Knox II from the Kentucky. The team also acquired Mitchell Robinson with the 36th overall pick, and signed former lottery pick Mario Hezonja. They further invested in untapped potential by signing another former lottery pick, with Noah Vonleh agreeing to a one-year deal. However, following a dismal start to the season, and after a meeting with Porziņģis gave team officials the impression that he wanted to be traded, Porziņģis was traded on January 30, 2019, alongside Trey Burke, Courtney Lee and Tim Hardaway Jr., to the Dallas Mavericks in exchange for DeAndre Jordan, Wesley Matthews, Dennis Smith Jr., an unprotected 2021 first-round draft pick, and an additional top-ten protected 2023 first-round draft pick. The Knicks finished the 2018–19 season with a league worst 17–65 regular season record, but the season was notable for the emergence of undrafted rookie Allonzo Trier, as well as for the progression of Dotson and Robinson. The Knicks won the third overall pick in the 2019 NBA draft, and selected RJ Barrett from Duke. The team also traded for forward Iggy Brazdeikis, who was drafted in the second round from Michigan.

In preparation for the 2019–20 season, and as a result of having a record $74 million in cap space following the Porziņģis trade, the team divided it among five new signings. The Knicks agreed terms with veteran role players Wayne Ellington and Taj Gibson, with forward Bobby Portis also signing. The team then signed former lottery picks Elfrid Payton and Julius Randle. On February 4, 2020, the Knicks fired Steve Mills after seven seasons as president with Scott Perry taking over on an interim basis.

===2020–present: return to relevance and the arrival of Jalen Brunson===

On March 2, 2020, Leon Rose was named president of the team. On July 30, the Knicks announced that they hired Tom Thibodeau as their head coach. Julius Randle had a breakout season and, on February 23, 2021, Randle was named as a reserve for the 2021 NBA All-Star Game. On May 3, with a 118–104 win over the Memphis Grizzlies, the Knicks clinched their first winning season since the 2012–13 season. On May 12, the Knicks clinched their first playoff appearance since 2013, ending their eight-year playoff drought. At the end of the regular season, Randle was named NBA Most Improved Player, while Thibodeau was named the NBA Coach of the Year, becoming the first Knicks head coach since Pat Riley in 1992–93 to receive the award. The Knicks faced the Atlanta Hawks in the first round of the 2021 NBA playoffs as the fourth seed, losing in five games. Fan attendance in home games during the 2020–21 season was prohibited until February 23, 2021, per an executive order from Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo. The Knicks reopened Madison Square Garden to spectators on February 23.

In the 2021 off-season, the Knicks retained much of their old talent, while bringing in former all-star guard Kemba Walker and forward Evan Fournier. Additionally, after Randle&#x27;s breakthrough season, the Knicks extended his contract for four years in August 2021.

On January 13, 2022, the Knicks traded former eighth overall pick of the 2018 NBA draft, Kevin Knox II and a protected future first round pick in exchange for former 10th overall pick of the 2019 NBA draft, Cam Reddish, Solomon Hill and a 2025 second-round draft pick and cash considerations. During the 2021–22 season, the Knicks struggled regressed finishing 11th in the Eastern Conference with a 37–45 record. Randle took a step back having a down season across the boards and his shooting percentages took a hit that resulted in fans booing Randle and increased trade rumours, and the lack of leadership of Randle was questioned, along with attitude and desire to be a Knick. Head coach Thibodeau was questioned if he was the right coach for the Knicks heading onwards. The signings of guard Kemba Walker and forward Evan Fournier were considered extreme failures that set the Knicks back as well. The third overall pick of the 2019 NBA draft, RJ Barrett in his third season averaged 20.0 points, 5.8 rebounds and 3.0 assists.
The 2022 off-season brought a lot of change to the Knicks&#x27; roster. During the 2022 NBA draft, the Knicks traded Alec Burks, Nerlens Noel and Kemba Walker to the Detroit Pistons to clear cap space for the free agency period, as well as trading their 11th overall pick for protected future first round picks. On June 12, 2022, the Knicks signed point guard Jalen Brunson to a four-year contract, with hopes he could bring some much-needed stability to the position. The Knicks completed the 2022–23 season with a 47–35 record, finishing in fifth place in the Eastern Conference. Randle represented the Knicks in the 2023 NBA All-Star Game. In the first round of the 2023 playoffs, the Knicks defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in five games, their first playoff series win since 2013. They were then defeated 4–2 by the Miami Heat in the second round.

In 2024, the Knicks saw Brunson and Randle represent them at the NBA All-Star Game. The team finished with 50 wins and secured the second seed, with a first round matchup against the Philadelphia 76ers. The Knicks defeated the 76ers in six games, before falling short in seven games against the Indiana Pacers.

==Logos and uniforms==

===1946–1964: Father Knickerbocker era===
The first logo of the New York Knicks is of a character named &quot;Father Knickerbocker&quot; dribbling a basketball, in the iconic blue and orange colors. It was designed by New York World-Telegram cartoonist Willard Mullin. From the beginning, the Knicks home uniforms are in white with blue and orange trim, while the away uniforms are in blue with orange and white trim. The first iterations contain monotone lettering in blue (home) and orange (away) lettering, with the addition of a checkerboard pattern during the mid-1950s.

===1964–1992: the Classic roundball era===
The Knicks would introduce an iconic logo that would endure for the next three decades. Designed by Bud Freeman, the word &quot;Knicks&quot; superimposed over a brown basketball is known as the &quot;classic roundball logo&quot;, with minor changes throughout its lifespan such as maroon wordmark and orange basketball. An alternate logo featuring the full team name inside an orange basketball was used during the late 1960s and into the 1970s. As the 1960s began, the Knicks updated their uniforms again. This time the lettering is in serifed fonts, and the blue lettering and numbers on the home uniforms are now trimmed in orange. The away uniforms maintained the orange lettering but added white trim; it later changed to white letters while adding white trim on the piping. Side stripes were also added to the uniform. The &quot;NY&quot; monogram is on the left leg of the shorts.

====1968–1979; 1983–1997: championship era uniforms====
The Knicks unveiled a uniform that would stay for three decades. This uniform, with an arched &quot;NEW YORK&quot; in serif lettering and in orange, would be the uniform worn during their 1970 and 1973 championship seasons; however, they were not introduced simultaneously. The home uniforms would debut in 1968, while the away uniforms debuted the following year. One noticeable feature was that the player&#x27;s name was in a straight block arched lettering (which is also called the &quot;vertical arch&quot; style), which was meticulously designed by Gerry Cosby and his sporting goods company. The unusual arrangement on the player&#x27;s name was later adopted by several Major League Baseball teams in the 1970s, and are currently used by the National Hockey League&#x27;s Colorado Avalanche, Detroit Red Wings and New York Rangers. On the shorts, there was no logo placed during much of the 1970s, but during the 1978–79 season, the side stripes were eliminated and the interlocking &quot;NY&quot; logo inside an apple was placed instead. When this uniform style was reinstated for the 1983–84 season, it now featured the player&#x27;s number and the interlocking &quot;NY&quot; logo (similar to the &quot;NY&quot; on the iconic New York Yankees pinstripe uniform), in addition to the return of the side stripes. The shorts number was eliminated in 1987, while variations of the &quot;roundball logo&quot; replaced the &quot;NY&quot; logo from 1991 to 1997. Since the 1991–92 season various outfitters such as Champion, Puma, Reebok, Adidas, and Nike have taken over uniform production from Cosby, with player names on the back reverted to a radial arch and added serifs.

====1979–1983: crimson red era uniforms====
The Knicks radically changed their uniforms prior to the 1979–80 season. Royal blue and orange were replaced by navy and crimson red. During this period, the home uniforms featured the team name below the number, both in crimson red with navy trim and in a stylized, free-flowing font. Navy away uniforms continue to feature the city name but below the white and crimson red number. The interlocking &quot;NY&quot; logo debuted on the shorts, with the addition of player numbers and side stripes during the 1981–82 season.

The change to crimson red and navy was initiated by then-team president E. Michael Burke, whose alma mater University of Pennsylvania wore those colors.

The &quot;Knicks&quot; script from the &quot;crimson red era&quot; uniforms was later reused in the uniforms of the Knicks&#x27; NBA Development League affiliate Westchester Knicks, with the same team name below the number format.

===1992–2012: new look era===
Before the 1992–93 season, the Knicks updated their &quot;roundball logo&quot; to its present form, with the word &quot;Knicks&quot; in a futuristic font, again superimposed over a basketball, with a silver triangle accentuating the look. The &quot;new look&quot; logo was designed by Tom O&#x27;Grady. For the 1995–96 season, the city name in a futuristic script was added atop the logo, while an alternate &quot;subway token&quot; logo featuring the acronym &quot;NYK&quot; was introduced. Black was also introduced as an accent color. The logo was added while the &quot;championship era&quot; uniforms were still in use, but during the 1995–96 season, the Knicks unveiled a blue alternate uniform, this time featuring black side stripes and the aforementioned &quot;subway token&quot; logo on the shorts&#x27; beltline. A home white version of this uniform was introduced for the 1997–98 season, effectively retiring the championship era uniforms. In the 2001–02 season, the side stripes were narrowed, while the &quot;subway token&quot; logo was moved to the back of the uniform, and the Knicks primary logo moved from the side to the front of the shorts.

===2012–present: modern era===
The Knicks updated their &quot;new look logo&quot;, this time eliminating the color black from the scheme. They still used the previous uniform during the 2011–12 season, but for the 2012–13 season, the Knicks unveiled new uniforms inspired from their &quot;championship era&quot; uniforms. A more subtle and bolder &quot;New York&quot; script was introduced, while the uniform piping stopped until the lettering. The phrase &quot;Once A Knick, Always A Knick&quot; is added on the uniform collar. Gray became the accent color. In addition, an updated version of their 1970s secondary logo, this time featuring only the team name, was introduced.

On October 25, 2013, the Knicks unveiled an alternate orange uniform, which is essentially a mirror image of the blue away uniforms, but with orange as the primary color and blue and white as trim colors. The uniforms debuted on October 31 in a road game against the Chicago Bulls, and were used in the first five weekend home games, but after going 0–6 in the orange uniforms, they were discontinued permanently.

Beginning with the 2017–18 season, Nike became the NBA&#x27;s new uniform provider. Under Nike, &quot;home&quot; and &quot;away&quot; uniform designations were eliminated, and in their place were the white &quot;Association&quot; set, primary color &quot;Icon&quot; set, alternate color &quot;Statement&quot; set, and annual &quot;City&quot; set that were used either at home or away. The Knicks kept their white &quot;Association&quot; and blue &quot;icon&quot; uniforms almost intact with only a few alterations such as truncated shoulder and shorts striping and the modern roundball logo on the waistband.

From 2017 to 2019, the Knicks&#x27; &quot;statement&quot; uniform featured a white base with lettering in orange with white and blue trim. The striping was inspired from the team&#x27;s 1970s-era uniforms. In the 2019–20 season, the Knicks changed their Statement uniform to a blue base and white lettering with blue and orange trim. The white letters were a nod to the team&#x27;s 1960s blue uniforms. As with the previous &quot;statement&quot; uniform, the striping was based on the team&#x27;s 1970s uniforms. Before the 2022–23 season, the &quot;statement&quot; uniform was again changed, this time with a navy base and orange gradient striping. The 1995–2011 &quot;New Look&quot; logo was placed on either side of the shorts. Letters are orange with blue trim.

===Special uniforms===
The Knicks have also worn special edition uniforms every March as part of the NBA&#x27;s Noche Latina events and during St. Patrick&#x27;s Day. The uniforms during Noche Latina were originally white with blue and orange trim, first using the 2001–12 uniform from 2008 to 2012, and then the current uniforms from 2012 to 2015, the only exception being &quot;Nueva York&quot; in front. In the 2015–16 season, the Knicks used a variation of their away blue uniform for Noche Latina. The Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day uniforms used the road uniform template except for green substituting for the blue base. These uniforms have also been used on Christmas Day from the 2009–10 season, and was worn in particular by Nate Robinson for a &quot;Kryptonate vs. Superman&quot; theme against Dwight Howard in the 2009 Slam Dunk Contest. The St. Patrick&#x27;s uniforms were shelved after the 2011–12 season.

On Christmas Day 2012, the Knicks wore monochrome uniforms known as &quot;big color&quot;. The uniforms are mostly orange, with blue trimming. The following year, the Knicks wore sleeved orange uniforms known as &quot;big logo&quot;, featuring a chrome-treated Knicks logo in front. For the 2014 edition, the Knicks wore a variation of their home uniforms, featuring the team logo in front and the player&#x27;s first name in a blue nameplate below the number. The 2016 Christmas Day game against the Celtics saw the Knicks wear an all-blue uniform without additional striping, complete with fancy scripted orange lettering and numbers.

As part of its deal with Nike, a special &quot;city&quot; uniform would be used to pay tribute to either local culture or team traditions. The Knicks&#x27; 2017–18 &quot;city&quot; uniform, which is navy with orange and grey trim and features an emblem containing the team name, uniform number, a ladder with a silhouette of a firefighter, a fire hydrant, and the abbreviation &quot;N.Y.C.&quot; for New York City, pays homage to the city&#x27;s firefighters and their families. It was designed in collaboration with the Knicks, the NBA, Nike and the Uniformed Firefighters Association.

The Knicks&#x27; second &quot;city&quot; uniform is also in navy and features white lettering, a straight aligned &quot;New York&quot; wordmark in front and alternating stripes of blue, navy and orange designed to mimic the New York City skyline. The blue and orange arm striping was inspired from the team&#x27;s 1950s uniforms. The Knicks initially debuted the uniform in the 2018–19 season, and was retained the following season.

The Knicks&#x27; 2020–21 &quot;city&quot; uniform is designed in collaboration with Kith. The uniform is predominantly black with blue and orange side gradients. The roundel in front features both the full team name and the &quot;city never sleeps&quot; nickname in a white, blue and orange gradient, and white numbers with blue drop shadows are added inside. The &quot;NYC&quot; acronym in black and white trim is placed within the Nike mark.

The Knicks&#x27; 2021–22 &quot;city&quot; uniform featured another collaboration with Kith. The predominantly black uniform featured the classic &quot;New York&quot; wordmark in white with orange trim, and orange numbers with white trim. Those elements, along with the 1992 &quot;New Look&quot; logo on the waist, paid tribute to the 1995–2001 blue uniforms. Along the side, black and gray checkerboard stripes were an homage to the 1950s set. A silhouette of the classic Madison Square Garden logo was added to the side stripes on the shorts.

Another Kith-collaborated &quot;city&quot; uniform was released in the 2022–23 season. This design was inspired by the blue uniforms they wore from 1995 to 2001, but with black as the base color.

The 2023–24 &quot;City&quot; uniform, again under a collaboration with Kith, was yet another nod to the late 1990s–early 2000s uniform design. In a first for the franchise, dark blue pinstripes were added to the blue-based uniform, and two &quot;New York&quot; wordmarks in both white and orange were layered twice on the top, in a nod to the iconic saying “the city so nice, they named it twice.” Black and orange side stripes were also featured. This uniform, albeit in white, was reused as part of the 2024–25 &quot;City&quot; uniform.

===Throwback uniforms===
The Knicks were one of several NBA teams to wear throwback uniforms during the league&#x27;s 50th anniversary in the 1996–97 season. The throwback set they wore that season represented the franchise&#x27;s first season in 1946–47. However, both the blue and white throwbacks featured blue letters with orange trim (the originals had only orange letters on the blue uniform and blue letters on the white uniform minus any additional trim).

In the 2004–05 season, the Knicks wore throwback white uniforms from the &quot;maroon era&quot; of the early 1980s. The only difference from the originals was that the letters on the player&#x27;s name were arranged in a radial arch (the originals were designed in a vertical arch) and were smaller in size.

The following season, the Knicks wore throwback blue checkerboard uniforms from the mid-1950s, which featured the &quot;Father Knickerbocker&quot; logo on the left leg (the originals did not feature said logo).

For the 2007–08 season, the Knicks wore their classic white uniforms as a tribute to the early 1970s championship teams. As with the &quot;maroon era&quot; throwbacks, the player&#x27;s name no longer appeared in a vertical arch and were smaller in size. In addition, the original &quot;roundball&quot; logo was added (the original uniforms had no logo on the shorts).

The 2010–11 season saw the Knicks wear the blue uniforms to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the 1969–70 championship team. However, the design they wore that season faithfully replicated those of the 1991–92 Knicks team, complete with radially-arched serifed block letters on the player&#x27;s name and the &quot;roundball&quot; logo on the shorts. In the original version, the shorts had no logo while the player name is arranged in a vertical arch and in a sans-serif block font.

In the 2015–16 season, the Knicks wore throwback white versions of the mid-1950s checkerboard uniforms in commemoration of the franchise&#x27;s 70th season.

In the 2021–22 season, the Knicks, along with the Celtics and Warriors, were one of three teams to wear a &quot;classic edition&quot; uniform to commemorate each franchise and the NBA&#x27;s 75th anniversary. The Knicks design harkened back to the original white uniforms from 1946, complete with enlarged blue numbers, blue waistbands, and blue and orange side stripes.

==Rivalries==

===Boston Celtics===

The New York Knicks and the Boston Celtics are two of the three remaining teams from the original 1946 NBA (the other is the Golden State Warriors). The rivalry stems from the old rivalry between the cities of New York City and Boston, which is also mirrored in both the Yankees–Red Sox and Jets–Patriots rivalries. The fact that Boston and New York City are only 190 miles apart contributes to it.

The teams have met nine times in the postseason. The last time was in the 2012–13 season, when Carmelo Anthony won the 2013 scoring title and helped them win the Atlantic Division for the first time since 1994. The Knicks faced the Celtics, who were without Rajon Rondo because of a mid-season injury, in the 1st round of the 2013 playoffs. In both games 1 and 2, Celtics had a lead going into halftime but were held to 25 and 23 points respectively in the second half, which was an all-time low for the franchise in the playoffs. Knicks gained a 3–0 lead in the series, but Boston avoided elimination in games 4 and 5. In game six, Knicks once led by 26 points in the fourth quarter, then the Celtics went onto a 20–0 run in less than 5 minutes to make it a close game, but Knicks still won and moved on to round 2.

===Brooklyn Nets===

The Brooklyn Nets, formerly the New Jersey Nets, are the Knicks&#x27; closest rival geographically. Both teams play in New York City, with the Knicks in Manhattan and the Nets in Brooklyn. Media outlets have noted the Knicks-Nets rivalry&#x27;s similarity to those of other New York City teams, such as Major League Baseball&#x27;s Subway Series rivalry between the American League&#x27;s New York Yankees (the Bronx) and the National League&#x27;s New York Mets (Queens), due to both boroughs&#x27; proximity through the New York City Subway. Historically, the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn competed via the Dodgers–Giants rivalry, when the two teams were known as the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants. Like the Knicks and Nets, the Giants and Dodgers played in Manhattan and Brooklyn, respectively, and were fierce divisional rivals. The rivalry between the New York Islanders and New York Rangers of the National Hockey League also had this distinction when the Islanders played in Brooklyn from 2015 to 2020. Due to the Knicks and Nets being located in the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn, some media outlets have dubbed this rivalry &quot;Clash of the Boroughs&quot;. The Knicks and Nets have met in the playoffs three times, with the Knicks winning two of the three meetings. The Knicks defeated the Nets in the playoffs in 1983 and 1994, while the Nets won their most recent meeting in 2004.

===Chicago Bulls===

The Knicks have a strong rivalry with the Chicago Bulls. The rivalry&#x27;s most intense period was during the late 1980s and early 90s, when both teams were huge playoff contenders. This intensity was due to a variety of factors: the great frequency in which the teams competed against each other in high-stakes contests and playoff series; well-known players such as Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Patrick Ewing, and John Starks; the reputations of the team&#x27;s respective cities; and personnel changes and conflicts between the teams.

The rivalry was dormant through much of the 2000s, with both teams rebuilding after the retirements of Patrick Ewing and Michael Jordan. However, with the arrival of future NBA MVP Derrick Rose in 2008, the Chicago Bulls began experiencing success once again. In the summer of 2010, the Bulls signed Carlos Boozer and the Knicks signed Amar&#x27;e Stoudemire, making both teams playoff contenders once again. Carmelo Anthony and Tyson Chandler joined the Knicks soon after, and the rivalry between the two teams appears to have been reborn.

===Indiana Pacers===

The rivalry between the New York Knicks and the Indiana Pacers started in 1993 and quickly became one of the most bitter in NBA history. They met in the playoffs 6 times from 1993 to 2000, fueling a rivalry epitomized by the enmity between Reggie Miller and prominent Knick fan Spike Lee. Miller likened it to the Hatfield–McCoy feud, and The New York Times said in 1998 that it was &quot;as combustible as any in the league&quot;.
The rivalry gave Miller the nickname &quot;The Knick-Killer&quot;. His clutch performances were frequently followed by jabs at Lee like the choke sign, adding fuel to the rivalry. The rivalry renewed during the 2013 NBA playoffs in the Eastern Conference Semifinals, with Indiana taking the series 4 games to 2, and again in the second round of the 2024 NBA playoffs, where the Pacers upset the Knicks in seven games.

===Miami Heat===

The Miami Heat were one of the New York Knicks&#x27; strongest inter-divisional foes. The two teams met in the playoffs each year from 1997 to 2000, with all four of those series being played to the maximum number of games. Pat Riley, the head coach of the Miami Heat at the time, served as the head coach of the Knicks from 1991 to 1995 and led the Knicks to the 1994 NBA Finals. During this four-year span, the Heat and the Knicks each won two playoff series against each other.

The two teams met again in the first round of the 2012 NBA playoffs, for the first time since the 1990s rivalry days. The Heat won the series, 4–1, and later went on to win the 2012 NBA Finals.

<text>The Orlando Magic are an American professional basketball team based in Orlando, Florida. The Magic compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Southeast Division of the Eastern Conference. The franchise was established in 1989 as an expansion franchise, and such notable NBA stars as Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, Penny Hardaway, Grant Hill, Tracy McGrady, Vince Carter and Dwight Howard, have played for the club throughout its history. , the franchise has played in the NBA playoffs 17 times in 35 seasons, and twice went to the NBA Finals, in 1995 and 2009, losing to the Houston Rockets and the Los Angeles Lakers, respectively.

==History==
===1985–1986: Team creation===
In September 1985, Orlando businessman Jim L. Hewitt approached Philadelphia 76ers general manager Pat Williams as they met in Texas on his idea of bringing an NBA team to Orlando. Intrigued by the potential of an Orlando-based NBA team, Williams became the front man of the investment group one year later, after he left the 76ers. On June 19, 1986, the two held a news conference to announce their intention of seeking an NBA franchise.

At the same time, Hewitt and Williams decided to hold a contest in the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; newspaper to get names for their new franchise. Out of a total of 4,296 submitted entries, the names were subsequently narrowed to four, &quot;Heat&quot;, &quot;Tropics&quot;, &quot;Juice&quot;, and &quot;Magic&quot;. The last one, which had been submitted by 11 people, was picked after Williams brought his seven-year-old daughter Karyn to visit in Orlando. On July 27, 1986, it was announced that the committee chose the Magic to be the new name of the Orlando franchise in the NBA. The name &quot;Magic&quot; alludes to the area&#x27;s biggest tourist attraction and economic engine Walt Disney World, along with its Magic Kingdom, highlighting its corporate theme of magic. Hewitt added that &quot;You look at all the aspects of Central Florida, and you find it really is an exciting place, a magical place.&quot;

Many, including Williams himself at first, thought that Miami or Tampa were better locations in Florida for a franchise. At the time, Orlando was a small city without a major airport or a suitable arena. Hewitt brought investors such as real estate developer William DuPont, Orlando Renegades owner Don Dizney, and Southern Fruit Citrus owners Jim and Steve Caruso, and talked the Orlando city officials into approving an arena project. Meanwhile, Williams gave presentations to NBA commissioner David Stern and the owners of the other teams of the league that the town was viable.

In April, the franchise committee recommended expanding by three teams, with two of the slots going to Charlotte and Minneapolis-St. Paul. The recommendation put the Orlando bid in doubt, since it advised that the state of Florida should only be allocated one team as part of the three-team expansion. This feedback put the planned Orlando franchise up against the Miami-based team, originally known as the &quot;Florida Heat&quot; and eventually named the Miami Heat. When both Miami and Orlando ownership groups made successful pitches, the expansion committee decided to expand by four teams, allowing both to have a franchise.

The Magic became the first-ever major-league professional sports franchise in the Orlando area, following an expansion fee of reportedly $32.5 million. They were one of the four new expansion franchises awarded by the NBA in 1987 along with the Charlotte Hornets, Miami Heat and Minnesota Timberwolves. The Magic hired Matt Guokas as the team&#x27;s first coach, who helped the Magic select 12 players in the NBA Expansion Draft on June 15, 1989.

===1989–1992: Early years===
The Magic, in their debut year, selected Nick Anderson from Illinois in the first round of the 1989 NBA Draft. As the 11th pick, he was the team&#x27;s first franchise player and leading scorer for a decade.
The Magic&#x27;s very first game played was an exhibition game on October 13, 1989, against the then-reigning champion Detroit Pistons, which the Magic won. Anderson was quoted as saying the atmosphere and the people watching the game was &quot;like Game 7 of the NBA Finals&quot;.

On November 4, 1989, the Magic played their first season game at the Orlando Arena (O-Rena) against the visiting New Jersey Nets, who won 111–106 in a hard-fought game. The Magic&#x27;s first victory came two days later, as the Magic defeated the New York Knicks 118–110. The inaugural team compiled a record of 18–64 with players including the franchise star player Nick Anderson, Reggie Theus, Scott Skiles, Terry Catledge, Sam Vincent, Otis Smith, and Jerry Reynolds.

In the 1990 NBA draft, the Orlando Magic selected Dennis Scott with the fourth overall pick. On December 30, 1990, Scott Skiles racked up 30 assists in the 155–116 victory over the Denver Nuggets, breaking Kevin Porter&#x27;s NBA single-game assists record (29). Skiles was named the NBA&#x27;s Most Improved Player at the end of the season, as the Magic heralded the NBA&#x27;s most improved record that season. Forward Dennis Scott set a team mark with 125 three-point field goals for the season, the best long-distance production by a rookie in NBA history. He was named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team.

On September 19, 1991, the DeVos family, founders of Amway, purchased the franchise for $85 million. Family patriarch Richard DeVos became the owner of the franchise. The 1991–92 season was disappointing for the Magic as various players missed games with injuries. Dennis Scott played only 18 games, Nick Anderson missed 22 games, Stanley Roberts, Jerry Reynolds, Brian Williams, Sam Vincent and Otis Smith all missed at least 27 games each. With a shortage of healthy players, the team struggled through a 17-game losing streak and finished with a 21–61 record. The Magic still managed to have all 41 home games sold out.
===1992–1996: The Shaquille O&#x27;Neal and Penny Hardaway era===

The Magic history was changed on May 17, 1992, when the franchise won the first pick in the 1992 NBA draft Lottery. The Magic selected big-man Shaquille O&#x27;Neal from Louisiana State University, the biggest prize in the draft since the Knicks won Patrick Ewing. O&#x27;Neal, a center, made an immediate impact on the Magic, leading the team to a 41–41 record. The Magic again became the NBA&#x27;s most improved franchise, as they improved by 20 games. O&#x27;Neal was the first rookie to be voted an All-Star starter since Michael Jordan in 1985. He also became the 1992–93 NBA Rookie of the Year. Despite O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s presence, the Magic missed the 1993 NBA playoffs because they were tied with the Indiana Pacers for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference with the Pacers holding the tiebreaker.

Despite barely missing the playoffs and receiving the least chance of gaining the top draft pick with only one ball in the lottery, the Magic again won the first pick in the 1993 NBA draft Lottery. Prior to the draft, Guokas stepped down as head coach, and Brian Hill was promoted to become the Magic&#x27;s second head coach. In the draft, the Magic selected Chris Webber, but traded him to the Golden State Warriors for the number three pick, guard Anfernee &quot;Penny&quot; Hardaway and three future first-round draft picks. With the combination of O&#x27;Neal and Hardaway, the Magic became a dominant team in the NBA, compiling the first 50 win season in franchise history with a 50–32 record. The Magic were in the playoffs for the first time, ranked the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference; however, the Pacers swept the Magic 3–0 in the first round, thus ending the Magic&#x27;s season.

In the 1994–95 season, the Magic&#x27;s sixth season, All-Star forward Horace Grant was acquired as a free agent from the Chicago Bulls. The Orlando Magic compiled a 57–25 record, best in the East and winning the Atlantic Division title, becoming the second-fastest team (behind the Milwaukee Bucks in 1971, who were in their third season) to advance to the NBA Finals in league history. In the playoffs, the Magic defeated the Boston Celtics, Bulls, and the Pacers, advancing to the NBA Finals where O&#x27;Neal, Hardaway and the young Magic bowed to a more playoff-experienced Hakeem Olajuwon and the Houston Rockets, winning their second consecutive championship in a 4–0 sweep of Orlando.

In the 1995–96 season, the Magic again were near the top of the Eastern Conference and the Atlantic Division with a 60–22 record, led by O&#x27;Neal and Hardaway; however, the Magic were seeded number two, behind the NBA&#x27;s second-best all-time 72–10 record of the Chicago Bulls. In the meantime, general manager Pat Williams was promoted to senior executive vice president and replaced by the vice president of Basketball Operations John Gabriel on April 29, 1996. In the playoffs, after the Magic defeated the Detroit Pistons and the Atlanta Hawks, Orlando met the Bulls in the Eastern Conference Finals. The combination of Jordan, Scottie Pippen and rebounder Dennis Rodman was too much for the Magic, and Orlando was swept 4–0.

===1996–1999: The post-Shaq/Penny Hardaway era===
In the off-season, O&#x27;Neal left as a free agent to the Los Angeles Lakers, dealing a huge blow to the Magic franchise. In the middle of the season, urged by player discontent, management fired coach Brian Hill and named Richie Adubato as interim coach for the rest of the season. Under Adubato, the Magic went 21–12 to compile a 45–37 record, led by Penny Hardaway. In the playoffs, the Magic quickly fell 0–2 to the heavily favored Miami Heat in the first round, but Hardaway battled back with consecutive 40-point games to assure a game five (the first player to do so), which the Magic ultimately lost.

The Magic then hired Chuck Daly to be head coach for the 1997–98 season. In addition, Hall of Famer Julius Erving joined the Magic&#x27;s front office, giving Orlando hope for a successful season. The season was hampered by an injury to Hardaway who sat out the majority of the season. Anderson, combined with newly acquired free agent Bo Outlaw, led the team to a 41–41 record, just out of reach of the NBA playoffs. In addition, Rony Seikaly was traded during the season to the New Jersey Nets for three role players and a future draft pick.

In 1998–99, with the drafting of Michael Doleac and Matt Harpring with the 12th and 15th picks in the 1998 draft, and a healthy Penny Hardaway and Nick Anderson, the Magic tied for the Eastern Conference&#x27;s best record with the Miami Heat in the lockout-shortened season, 33–17. At the heart of the team was veteran and future Orlando Magic Hall of Famer Darrell Armstrong, leading from the vanguard (a constant that Orlando fans would enjoy for a decade) and picking up the NBA&#x27;s Sixth-Man and Most Improved Player awards along the way. Orlando also acquired NBA great Dominique Wilkins, along with brother Gerald, who were past their primes but were both still serviceable NBA players. In the playoffs the Penny Hardaway-led Magic were seeded number 3 because of tiebreakers and faced the Philadelphia 76ers. The 76ers, led by Allen Iverson, upset the Magic 3–1 in the first round. The team also changed their uniforms for the first time ever, changing from pinstripes to stars.

===1999–2000: &quot;Heart and Hustle&quot; season===
In 1999, the Magic, under general manager John Gabriel, who was later named Executive of the Year, hired rookie-coach Doc Rivers. Gabriel dismantled the previous team trading their only remaining superstar Penny Hardaway to the Phoenix Suns for Danny Manning (who never donned a Magic uniform), Pat Garrity, and two future draft picks. The Magic were then a team composed of virtually all no name players and little experience, which included team captain Armstrong, Bo Outlaw and a young Ben Wallace, along with Coach Rivers, who led the Magic to a 41–41 record, barely missing out on the playoffs. At the end of the season Rivers was named Coach of the Year. That year was characterized by the slogan &quot;Heart and Hustle&quot;, as the team was known for its hard-working style.

===2000–2004: The Tracy McGrady era===
The following off-season, Gabriel, with millions of cleared salary cap space, attempted to lure three of the NBA&#x27;s most prized free agents: Tim Duncan, Grant Hill, and Tracy McGrady. While Duncan opted to remain with the San Antonio Spurs, the Magic acquired Hill, a perennial All-Star, and McGrady. With McGrady and Hill together, the Magic were expected to be a force in the East. However, Hill was limited to 4 games because of an ankle injury. McGrady blossomed into a star during the season, becoming one of the NBA&#x27;s top scorers. With the addition of Mike Miller from the draft, the Magic compiled a 43–39 record, which included a nine-game winning streak, and once again made the playoffs. McGrady made the All-Star Team and All-NBA Second Team. Miller won the Rookie of the Year. In the playoffs, they faced the Milwaukee Bucks in the first round. The Bucks won the series 3–1.

In 2001–02, McGrady led the Magic to a winning record of 44–38. Hill was still severely limited by his ankle injury, and did not play for the vast majority of the season. McGrady, combined with Armstrong, Miller, and 3-point sharpshooter Pat Garrity, formed the core of the team. McGrady made the All-NBA for the first time and made his second consecutive All-Star Team. However, the Magic were defeated 3–1 in the first round of the playoffs by the Charlotte Hornets led by Baron Davis.

In 2002–03, with the acquisitions of Gordan Giricek and Drew Gooden from the Memphis Grizzlies in exchange for Mike Miller, McGrady once again led the Magic to a 42–40 record. McGrady led the league in scoring with 32.1 points per game, made his second All-NBA First Team, and Third All-Star Team. Despite still not having Hill due to injury, the Magic entered the playoffs for the third straight year. However, after taking a 3–1 lead in the best-of-seven first-round series, the Magic fell to the Detroit Pistons 4–3 in the now infamous heartbreaker. McGrady was quoted as saying, &quot;It feels good to get in the second round&quot; after still needing one more win to advance.

The Magic&#x27;s 15th season in 2003–04 proved to be one of its toughest ever. Even with the acquisition of veteran free agents Tyronn Lue and Juwan Howard, the Magic struggled early. After winning its first game, the Magic lost 19 consecutive games, setting a franchise record. They never recovered, and finished an NBA worst 21–61. Despite this, McGrady led the league in scoring with 28.0 points per game, made the All-NBA Second Team and his fourth consecutive All-Star Team. In the middle of the 19-game losing streak, coach Doc Rivers was fired, and assistant Johnny Davis was promoted to head coach. General manager Gabriel was replaced by John Weisbrod.

===2004–2012: The Dwight Howard era===

In the off-season, Weisbrod completely dismantled the team. Though he kept Davis as coach, he shook up the player roster, only keeping a few players from last season. The most significant trade was Tracy McGrady. McGrady, discontent with the Magic, wished to move on; Weisbrod accused McGrady of &quot;slacking off&quot; and not attending practices (McGrady later admitted that he did not give 100 percent during the 2003–04 season and wanted the team to bring him some help, but never wanted to leave Orlando). The Magic traded McGrady along with Reece Gaines, Tyronn Lue, and Juwan Howard to the Houston Rockets for Steve Francis, Kelvin Cato, and Cuttino Mobley. In addition, the Magic acquired center Tony Battie and two second-round draft picks from the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for Drew Gooden, Steven Hunter, and the draft rights to Anderson Varejão. The Magic then signed free agent Hedo Türkoğlu. With the number one draft pick, the Magic selected high-school phenomenon and future All-Star and franchise cornerstone Dwight Howard, and a draft-day trade with the Denver Nuggets got them point guard Jameer Nelson.

After a promising 13–6 start, the Magic began to fall apart. First, Weisbrod traded Mobley for Doug Christie from the Sacramento Kings. Christie, because of his emotional ties to the Kings, at first refused to play for the Magic. Later on, Christie claimed he had bone spurs and was placed on the injured list after playing only a few games for the Magic. Near the end of the season, with a playoff-push faltering, Weisbrod fired Davis after leading Davis to believe he was going to be the team&#x27;s head coach for the entire 2004–05 NBA season. He then promoted Chris Jent to interim head coach. Throughout the season, bolstered by Hill&#x27;s return, the Magic played spectacularly, defeating top NBA teams. However, led by the erratic play of Francis, the Magic also lost to league teams with losing records. Howard showed great promise, becoming one of the few players to average a double-double. Howard was a consistent rebounder and scorer, becoming the first rookie to start and play all 82 games in a season. In addition, Nelson, after a slow start, developed into a talented player, taking over the starting point guard position. Hill also returned and averaged 19.7 points a game. Hill was chosen an All-Star starter by NBA fans for the 2005 All-Star Game, and Dwight Howard and Jameer Nelson were named to the All-Rookie first and second teams, respectively. Howard was a unanimous selection.
The Magic finished the season 36–46. Their playoff push was hampered by injuries in the last quarter of the season: a season-ending broken wrist for sixth man Hedo Türkoğlu, a shin injury to Grant Hill, a rib cage injury to Nelson, and a three-game suspension to Francis for kicking a photographer. The Magic ended a few games out of the playoffs. On May 23, 2005, the Magic&#x27;s plans were disrupted by the abrupt resignation of general manager and Chief Operating Officer John Weisbrod. In addition, the Magic announced the following day that Brian Hill, the coach who led the Magic to the NBA Finals under O&#x27;Neal and Hardaway, would return as head coach.

The Magic drafted Spanish Fran Vázquez with the 11th pick in the 2005 NBA draft. On July 28, 2005, Vazquez stunned the team after announcing that he would remain in Spain to play for Akasvayu Girona, getting ridiculed by media after he was quoted that the decision to stay was made by his girlfriend. Owner Rich DeVos announced on October 21 that he was transferring ownership to his children, with the official owner role moving to son-in-law and team president Bob Vander Weide. The transfer was supposed to be complete by the end of the year.

The 2005–06 season opened with high hopes for the Magic despite not being able to add first-round draft pick Vasquez. Grant Hill was supposedly finally healed from his multiple ankle surgeries. Dwight Howard and Jameer Nelson showed excellent progress during summer-league play. Second-round draft pick Travis Diener showed excellent shooting and decision-making during the summer. And the free-agent signing of Keyon Dooling showed that the club was going to continue making progress. Then trouble began. Hill, despite his ankle apparently being healed, suffered a painful sports hernia injury that would hamper his play throughout the entire season. After playing in three preseason games, he underwent surgery to correct the hernia and would not appear during the regular season until mid-December, to which he lasted a month before attempting to make another comeback in February and early March, however, he only played sporadically. Then a foot injury to Nelson forced him to sit out for over a month.

On February 15, 2006, the Magic announced that they had acquired Darko Miličić and Carlos Arroyo from the Detroit Pistons in exchange for Kelvin Cato and a 2007 top-five protected first-round draft pick. One week later, on February 22, the Magic announced that they had traded Steve Francis to the New York Knicks in exchange for Penny Hardaway (whom they waived two days later) and Trevor Ariza. With a set starting rotation of Battie, Howard, Türkoğlu, DeShawn Stevenson, and Nelson, the Magic mounted a surprising run at the eighth playoff spot in the Eastern Conference, including an 8-game winning streak and 12 consecutive home wins. The streak included wins against NBA powerhouses Detroit, San Antonio, Dallas and Miami, as well as a game against the Philadelphia 76ers in which Howard recorded 28 points and a career-high 26 rebounds. Despite their efforts they did not make the playoffs.

====2006–2010: Return to the NBA Finals====

With the 11th overall pick in the 2006 NBA draft, the Magic took former Duke star JJ Redick. Even with the fan support to get him playing time he averaged just over 11 minutes a game. After beginning the season strong with a 13–4 record, the Orlando Magic began to suffer in the standings as the result of multiple losses, due in large part to the injuries of Tony Battie, Keyon Dooling, and Grant Hill. The Magic were also hampered with the sporadic play of many of their young stars, who on multiple occasions showed their propensity for streaky shooting and the team&#x27;s lack of a solid scoring two-guard. Despite the team&#x27;s poor play, Dwight Howard continued to develop and blossom in his third year in the league, culminating in his first selection to the Eastern Conference All-Star team. The final few weeks of the season saw the Magic build momentum and confidence with an impressive late push towards the Playoffs. On April 15, 2007, with an 88–86 victory over the Boston Celtics, the Magic secured its first berth in the NBA playoffs since 2003 by locking up the eighth seed in the Eastern Conference. This marked the first time that the team had made the playoffs while posting a losing record. Nevertheless, their Playoff run ended on April 28, 2007, after they were swept in the first round by first seeded Detroit Pistons whose experience, veteran leadership and ability to consistently make the clutch basket proved far too much for the undermanned and overwhelmed Magic to overcome. It was announced on May 23, 2007, that Brian Hill had been fired as head coach of the Magic.

On June 1, 2007, the Magic signed Billy Donovan to be their head coach for five years. The next day, Donovan wished to be released from the contract and the Magic agreed several days later. On June 6, 2007, the Magic signed a 4-year contract with Stan Van Gundy. In the free agent market, the Magic signed Rashard Lewis of the Seattle SuperSonics to a six-year league-maximum contract believed to be worth over $110 million. At the NBA China Games, the Magic swept the three games in China, twice against the Cleveland Cavaliers and once against the Chinese national team in games held in Shanghai and in Macau.

On November 15, 2007, Bob Vander Weide, the son-in-law of Richard DeVos, officially took over as owner of the team, although ownership is still split evenly amongst Richard DeVos&#x27; other children as well.

The Magic started the 2007–08 NBA season with an impressive 16–4 record in their first 20 games, which included wins over the Boston Celtics and Cleveland Cavaliers. Through the next few months, the Magic were not so successful, splitting their next 36 games with 18 wins and 18 losses. At the start of March, the Magic seemed to pick up speed again, finishing the month with 10 wins, the first time since November that they won 10 or more in a month. The Magic clinched the Southeast Division title when the Washington Wizards were routed at Utah 129–87 on March 31, 2008. It was the Magic&#x27;s third division title, but only their first since 1995–96 season, as well as their first since the Southeast Division was formed. They also earned their 50th win of the season against the Chicago Bulls on April 13, which had not happened since the 1995–96 season. The Magic finished the regular season 52–30, their best season since 1995–96. With the third seed in the Eastern Conference, they were matched up in their first-round playoff series against the Toronto Raptors. The Magic had home-court advantage for the first time since the 1998–99 season.

On April 28, 2008, at Amway Arena, the Magic eliminated the Raptors with a 4–1 series victory in the first round. It was the first playoff series victory for the Magic in 12 years after 6 straight first-round exits. The run of success did not last long as they fell 4–1 to the experienced Detroit Pistons in the second round. With the Magic already down in the series, controversy erupted after the Pistons&#x27; Game 2 victory. At the conclusion of the third quarter, Chauncey Billups of the Pistons made a three-point shot giving the Pistons a three-point lead. However, the clock had stopped just as the play began. NBA rules prohibit officials from using instant replay or any timing device to determine how much time has elapsed when a clock malfunctions, nor is a replay allowed to be viewed from the time of the malfunction to when the play ends, when the game clock has not expired. Because of the rule, the officials then estimated that the play took 4.6 seconds, and because there were 5.1 seconds remaining when play began, the field goal was allowed to be counted. The NBA later admitted that the play actually took 5.7 seconds and the basket in question should not have counted. The Pistons went on to win Game 2. The Magic were able to win Game 3, with the Pistons&#x27; Chauncey Billups out for most of the game with an injury but were unable to take advantage of his absence and defeat the Pistons in Games 4 and 5, which ended the Magic&#x27;s playoff run in 2008. Another highlight of the season was Hedo Turkoglu winning Most Improved Player.
The first half of the 2008–09 season went very well for the Magic. After 41 games, the Magic were 33–8, leading the Southeast Division, as well as having one of the top four records in the league. At the start of February, Jameer Nelson, their all-star starting point guard, went down with a shoulder injury. He was expected to miss the remainder of the season. After trading for Rafer Alston, the Magic finished the regular season with a 59–23 record, it was the most games the team had won in a season since the 1995–96 season in which they had 60 wins. In the playoffs, the Magic beat the Philadelphia 76ers in the first round of the playoffs and then the defending champions, the Boston Celtics, in the Eastern Conference semifinals, behind assistant coach Patrick Ewing&#x27;s guarantee that they would win Game 7 of that series. In their first conference finals since 1996, the Magic beat the Cleveland Cavaliers, which were led by the season&#x27;s MVP, LeBron James. After dropping the first two games in the Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers, the Magic finally won their first-ever game in the Finals in Game 3. Despite Nelson&#x27;s return to the team for the Finals, the Lakers won the series and the championship by beating the Magic in five games.

In the 2009 off-season, Orlando traded Rafer Alston, Tony Battie, and Courtney Lee to the New Jersey Nets in exchange for eight-time All-Star Vince Carter and Ryan Anderson. Hedo Türkoğlu, as part of a sign-and-trade, was sent to the Toronto Raptors. They then made several free agent signings. On July 10, former Dallas Mavericks power forward Brandon Bass was given a 4-year deal. On July 21, the Magic signed former Phoenix Suns forward Matt Barnes. On August 19, they signed former Miami Heat point guard Jason Williams, who decided to come back after a year in retirement.

On September 28, 2009, Orlando extended the contract of head coach Stan Van Gundy by exercising his option for the 2010–11 season. They did the same for general manager Otis Smith, which would keep him in that position through the 2011–12 season.

The Magic were without Rashard Lewis for the first 10 games of the 2009–10 season. Lewis tested positive for an elevated testosterone level that was caused by an over-the-counter supplement containing a substance banned by the league. To make matters worse, Vince Carter suffered a left ankle injury in just the second game of the season. Carter&#x27;s injury turned out to be not too serious, but caused him to miss the next five games. Another setback came in mid-November, when Jameer Nelson injured his left knee, which required arthroscopic surgery to repair. Nelson would be out for five weeks. Despite all of this, the Magic had a 23–8 record at the end of December.

Orlando lost seven of their first ten games in January but recovered well enough to post a winning record for the month by winning six of their next seven. Following the All-Star break, the Magic went on a roll, winning 23 of their 28 remaining games, clinching their fourth consecutive playoff berth and winning their third consecutive division championship in the process. The Magic finished the regular season with a 59–23 record, matching their record from the 2008–09 season, and finishing with not only the second-best record in the Eastern Conference, but the second-best record in the entire league. The team became one of the only teams in NBA history to beat all of the other 29 teams at least once during the regular season. The Magic swept the Charlotte Bobcats and the Atlanta Hawks in the first two rounds of the playoffs, respectively. They then faced the Boston Celtics in the conference finals. After losing the first three games of the series, Orlando managed to win the next two games, but lost on the road in Game 6, ending their season.

====2010–2012: &quot;Dwightmare&quot; saga====

In anticipation of the team&#x27;s move to Amway Center, the Magic updated its logo. They retained the streaking ball logo, but changed the wordmark taken from their current uniforms. The Magic hosted the NBA All-Star Game in 2012. The Magic also unveiled black alternate uniforms.

In the summer of 2010, the Orlando Magic signed Chris Duhon, formerly of the New York Knicks, and Quentin Richardson, formerly of the Miami Heat.

On December 18, 2010, having lost five of their last six games, the Magic made a blockbuster trade deal with the Phoenix Suns and the Washington Wizards. They traded Vince Carter, Marcin Gortat and Mickaël Piétrus to Phoenix for Hedo Türkoğlu (who led them into the 2009 NBA Finals when they lost 4–1 against the Los Angeles Lakers), Jason Richardson and Earl Clark. Rashard Lewis was traded to Washington for 3-time All-Star Gilbert Arenas.

The Magic finished the season with 52 victories, good for second in the Southeast Division. But they were ousted in six games by the Atlanta Hawks in the first round of the 2011 NBA playoffs, the first time head coach Stan Van Gundy was eliminated early in the playoffs.

In a lockout-shortened 2011–12 season, the Magic started the off-season on a rocky note, with their All-Star center, Dwight Howard, requesting a trade to either the New Jersey Nets, Los Angeles Lakers, or Dallas Mavericks. Overlooking the trade request the Magic did a sign and trade with the Boston Celtics for Glen Davis and Von Wafer in exchange for Brandon Bass. The Magic also amnestied Gilbert Arenas and signed Larry Hughes, Justin Harper, and DeAndre Liggins. The Magic started the season on Christmas Day in Oklahoma City against the Thunder. They lost the season opener 97–89. During the month of February, the Magic waived Hughes and signed Ish Smith. On February 26, Orlando hosted the 2012 All-Star Game. The Magic struggled to win games consistently, with concerns about the uncertainty of Dwight Howard&#x27;s future with the franchise. However, after Dwight rescinded his trade demand and signed a one-year deal in March, the Magic seemed to find their footing again. But then in early April, shortly after it became public that Howard requested coach Van Gundy to be replaced, the center was diagnosed with a herniated disk and forced to have back surgery, thus ending his season. The Magic clinched the sixth seed in the east with a 37–29 record. The Magic were faced with the third-seeded Pacers in the first round. Despite winning the first game of the series the Magic were defeated 4–1.

On May 21, 2012, it was reported that general manager Otis Smith and head coach Stan Van Gundy would part ways with the organization. Stan Van Gundy finished with a 259–135 regular season record with the team which included making the playoffs in those five years and a conference championship.

CEO Alex Martins announced former Oklahoma City assistant general manager Rob Hennigan as the new general manager for the Orlando Magic on June 20, 2012. Once hired, he became the youngest general manager in the league.

In the 2012 NBA draft, the Magic selected Andrew Nicholson and Kyle O&#x27;Quinn.

On June 25, 2012, Dwight Howard had face-to-face meetings with general manager Rob Hennigan in Los Angeles and demanded a trade to the Brooklyn Nets.

On July 9, 2012, the Magic completed a sign-and-trade deal with the New Orleans Hornets, that sent forward Ryan Anderson to the Hornets. In return the Magic received center Gustavo Ayon.

On July 28, 2012, Jacque Vaughn was named the new head coach. He had been the assistant coach for the San Antonio Spurs for the last two seasons.

On August 9, 2012, ESPN reported that a four-team trade would send Dwight Howard to the Los Angeles Lakers. Marc Stein of ESPN.com was told the Lakers were to acquire Howard, Chris Duhon and Earl Clark, the Denver Nuggets were to acquire Andre Iguodala, the Philadelphia 76ers were to acquire Andrew Bynum and Jason Richardson, and the Magic were to acquire Arron Afflalo, Al Harrington, Nikola Vučević, Maurice Harkless, Josh McRoberts, Christian Eyenga, and five total protected future (three first-round, two second-round) picks from each of the other three teams. The deal was officially confirmed and completed on August 10.
Howard left the Magic as their all-time leading scorer, shot blocker, and rebounder.

===2012–2021: Struggles with Nikola Vucevic===
====2012–2017: Rob Hennigan era====

Following the trade of Dwight Howard, the Magic entered into a state of rebuilding with Maurice Harkless and Nikola Vučević. On August 29, the Magic signed free agent guard E&#x27;Twaun Moore. On December 2, 2012, Howard&#x27;s first game against his former team, the Magic defeated the Lakers 113–103.

On February 21, 2013, the Magic traded JJ Redick, Ish Smith and Gustavo Ayón to the Milwaukee Bucks. In return, the Magic received Beno Udrih, Tobias Harris and rookie Doron Lamb. The Magic also traded Josh McRoberts to the Charlotte Bobcats for Hakim Warrick who was waived 2 days later.

The Magic used their lottery pick to draft Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year, shooting guard Victor Oladipo from Indiana University. The Magic also had the 51st pick in the second round of the NBA draft. They used this pick to draft forward Romero Osby from the University of Oklahoma. Osby averaged 16 points, seven rebounds, and 1.3 assists during his senior NCAA season at Oklahoma but was cut by the Magic before the season opener.

The Magic finished the 2013–14 season with a 23–59 record, third worst in the NBA. The draft lottery gave them the fourth pick in the 2014 NBA draft. In the draft, they selected Aaron Gordon with the fourth pick and Dario Šarić with the 12th pick. Saric was then swapped for the 10th pick, Elfrid Payton in exchange for a 2017 first round pick and a future second round pick. Roy Devyn Marble was selected with the 56th pick in the second round. On February 5, 2015, Jacque Vaughn was relieved of his head coaching duties after coaching seasons for the Magic. His overall record was 58–158. He was replaced by interim head coach James Borrego.

On May 29, 2015, the Magic hired their former point guard Scott Skiles as the franchise&#x27;s 12th head coach.

On June 25, 2015, in the 2015 NBA draft, Orlando selected Mario Hezonja with the fifth overall pick and Tyler Harvey
with the 51st overall pick. On February 16, 2016, the Magic traded Tobias Harris to the Detroit Pistons in exchange for Ersan İlyasova and Brandon Jennings.

On May 12, 2016, Skiles stepped down as head coach of the Orlando Magic. On May 19, the Orlando Magic agreed to a deal with former Indiana Pacers coach Frank Vogel to become the next head coach of the team.

With Vogel as their new coach, the Magic made many changes to their roster during the off-season. On June 23, 2016, in the 2016 NBA draft the Magic selected Domantas Sabonis 11th overall, but then traded Sabonis and shooting guard Victor Oladipo for defensive power forward Serge Ibaka of the Oklahoma City Thunder. During free agency the Magic re-signed Evan Fournier to a five-year, $85 million contract and also signed Bismack Biyombo, Jeff Green, and D. J. Augustin. On July 15, C. J. Wilcox was acquired, along with cash considerations, from the Clippers in exchange for Devyn Marble and a future second round draft pick.

On February 14, 2017, Ibaka was traded to the Toronto Raptors in exchange for Terrence Ross and a future first-round draft pick. The Magic finished the 2016–17 season with the third worst record in their conference, finishing 29–53.

====2017–2022: Jeff Weltman era====

In the summer of 2017, the Magic made various changes, the first being the firing of general manager Rob Hennigan on April 13. On May 23, the Magic named Jeff Weltman, the former general manager of the Toronto Raptors, as president of basketball operations and named John Hammond, the former general manager for the Milwaukee Bucks, as the new general manager.

On September 6, 2018, team owner Richard DeVos died aged 92 from complications from an infection.

During the 2018–19 season, the Magic won their sixth division title and finished in seventh place in the Eastern Conference to clinch a playoff berth for the first time since the 2011–12 season. Mohamed Bamba was diagnosed with stress fracture on February 5, 2019, and eventually missed the remainder of the season. At the NBA trade deadline, the Magic traded Jonathon Simmons and two draft picks to the Philadelphia 76ers for Markelle Fultz. Nikola Vučević was selected as a reserve for the 2019 Eastern Conference All Star Team, being the first Orlando Magic All Star player since Dwight Howard in 2012. In March 2019, the Magic signed former NBA Rookie of the Year Michael Carter-Williams to two ten-day contracts before signing him to a one-year deal. The Magic were matched up against the Toronto Raptors in the first round of the 2019 NBA playoffs. While the Magic won their first playoff game in seven years, the Raptors won the series in five games.

In the 2019 NBA draft the Magic selected Chuma Okeke with the 16th overall pick, and traded its second-round pick to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for $2.2 million and a future draft pick. With the prospect of limited playing time due to injury, the Magic and Okeke agree to sign a one-year deal with the Magic&#x27;s G League affiliate in Lakeland and sign Okeke&#x27;s rookie contract in the summer of 2020. During the 2019 free agency, the Magic re-signed with Vučević, Terrence Ross, Michael Carter-Williams, and Birch, signed free agent Al-Farouq Aminu, and waived Mozgov. The Magic compiled a 30–35 record before the league suspended its season on March 11, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the suspension of the season, the Magic were one of the 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble to participate in the final eight seeding games of the regular season. Season ending injuries to Jonathan Isaac and Mo Bamba, along with significant injuries to Terrence Ross and Evan Fournier hampered their performance and they went 3–5 in the seeding games, but the team earned the eighth playoff spot in the Eastern Conference to face the Milwaukee Bucks. While the Magic won the opening game, Milwaukee won the next four ending the Magic&#x27;s season in round one for the second year in a row.

In the 2020 NBA draft the Magic selected Cole Anthony with the 15th overall pick. The shortened free agency period followed where the Magic signed their 2019 draft pick Chuma Okeke, re-signed James Ennis, Michael Carter-Williams, and Gary Clark, while adding Dwayne Bacon. The injury Jonathan Isaac suffered during the previous season was significant enough that he was ruled out for the entire 2020–21 season. In the eighth game of the 2020–21 season, starting point guard, Markelle Fultz went down with an ACL tear in a game against the Cleveland Cavaliers. After the season-ending injury, rookie point guard, Cole Anthony would fill the starting point guard role. On January 20, 2021, Fultz underwent surgery. At the 2021 NBA trade deadline the Magic traded away Nikola Vučević, Aaron Gordon, and Evan Fournier, each to different teams, in what has been viewed as the beginning of another rebuilding period. At the end of the season, the team and Clifford mutually agreed to part ways.

On July 11, 2021, Jamahl Mosley was named head coach after spending the previous season as an assistant coach with the Dallas Mavericks.

On July 29, 2021, the Magic selected Jalen Suggs with the fifth pick and Franz Wagner with the eighth pick (Acquired via the Chicago Bulls in the Nikola Vučević trade) in the 2021 NBA draft. The Magic also selected Orlando native Jason Preston in the second round and promptly traded him on draft night to the Los Angeles Clippers.

===2022–present: The Paolo Banchero Era===

====2022–23: First year of Banchero====

On June 23, 2022, the Magic selected Paolo Banchero from Duke University with the first pick and Caleb Houstan from the University of Michigan with the 32nd pick in the 2022 NBA draft. Banchero helped the Magic improve their record from 22 wins to 34, averaging 20 points per game and ultimately being chosen as Rookie of the Year.

In May 2023, the Magic donated $50,000 to a super PAC supporting Florida governor Ron DeSantis&#x27;s 2024 presidential campaign, in what the &quot;New York Times&quot; called &quot;the first known instance in which an NBA team directly donated to a group allied with a presidential candidate.&quot;

On June 22, 2023, the Magic selected Anthony Black from the University of Arkansas with the sixth overall pick and Jett Howard from the University of Michigan with the 11th pick.

On July 5, 2023, the Magic promoted Anthony Parker to general manager (GM) and Pete D&#x27;Alessandro to executive vice president (EVP), while Jeff Weltman was promoted to President of Basketball Operations.

On July 17, 2023, the Magic traded picks with the Phoenix Suns. The Suns received a 2023 second-round pick via the Denver Nuggets, a 2026 second-round pick via the Los Angeles Clippers, and a 2028 second-round pick via the Orlando Magic (protected No. 31-45). In this deal, the Orlando Magic receive unprotected swap rights to the 2026 first-round pick of the Phoenix Suns or Washington Wizards (the Phoenix Suns owe the top of these two picks or theirs already, therefore allowing the Orlando Magic to receive the best of the left-over pick selection spots or keep their own).

====2023–present: Playoff rise====
The 2023–24 season saw the young Orlando Magic rise as a playoff team. Paolo Banchero made his first All-Star team as a reserve for the Eastern Conference, becoming the first Magic All-Star since Nikola Vucevic in 2021. Jalen Suggs made all defensive-second team. The Magic finished 47–35 as the fifth seed in the Eastern Conference and forced the Cleveland Cavaliers led by Donovan Mitchell to seven games in the first round of the playoffs but lost game 7.

The next offseason, the Magic did not resign former number one overall pick Markelle Fultz. They drafted Tristan Da Silva and traded for the 47th pick which they used to select Antonio Reeves.

On October 31st, Paolo Banchero, two games after dropping a career high 50 points, was announced injured with a torn right oblique, triggering an All-Star Leap and brief leadership role for Franz Wagner. However, Wagner later tore his right oblique and was announced out indefinitely. The Magic lost both their star forwards to torn obliques. After missing more than two months, Banchero made his return to the Orlando lineup in a loss against the Bucks, dropping 34 points and 7 rebounds.

==Home arenas==
===Kia Center===
The team&#x27;s current home arena, Kia Center (formerly Amway Center), officially opened on October 1, 2010. The Orlando Magic hosted their first preseason game at Amway Center on October 10 against the New Orleans Hornets. The 2010–11 regular season home opener was on October 28 against the Washington Wizards, and the Magic won both games. In 2012, the Amway Center hosted the All-Star Weekend.

At the time it opened, the new Amway Center was home to the largest Jumbotron in the NBA. The arena also features approximately of digital ribbon boards, and outside the building a by video display is visible to motorists traveling on Interstate 4.

On December 20, 2023, Amway Center was formally renamed Kia Center in partnership with Kia America.

Kia Center is also the home of the minor league hockey team, Orlando Solar Bears and the Orlando Predators of the National Arena League (NAL).

===Amway Arena (former arena)===
Amway Arena opened in 1989 and served as home to the Orlando Magic since their inception until the 2009–10 season. It was originally known as the Orlando Arena, or the &quot;O-Rena&quot;, during its first 10 years. In 1999, TD Waterhouse purchased the naming rights and named the venue the TD Waterhouse Centre. In December 2006, the naming rights were purchased by Amway for four years. It is also home of the Arena Football League&#x27;s Orlando Predators, the Orlando Sharks of the Major Indoor Soccer League, and various sporting and entertainment events. Amway Arena was one of &quot;The Orlando Venues&quot; owned and operated by the City of Orlando. The other facilities include the Bob Carr Performing Arts Centre, Tinker Field, Camping World Stadium, Harry P. Leu Gardens, and Mennello Museum.

==Team identity==

===Logos and uniforms===
====Original pinstripes (1989–1998)====
Orlando advertising agency The Advertising Works, led by its president Doug Minear was responsible for the original Magic uniforms. The logo, featuring a basketball crowded by stars and the wordmark &quot;Magic&quot; with a star replacing the A, was created following meetings with Walt Disney World artists and over 5000 suggestions sent from around the country. Stars would remain a primary feature of the logo once it was redesigned in 2000 to feature a comet-like basketball. Pat Williams first suggested the colors black and gold of his alma mater Wake Forest, but this was eschewed for various factors, including the local college UCF using the same scheme. Black would still be the primary color in the scheme used by Minear, a trait shared by 16 other NBA teams. Other colors were an electric blue specially made by sporting goods manufacturer MacGregor, and silver. The home uniforms were white with black pinstripes, featuring black numbers with blue trim, and the road jerseys reversed the scheme while featuring &quot;Orlando&quot; instead of the Magic wordmark. Given the standard mesh nylon worn across the NBA did not allow for pinstripes, the jerseys were made out of durene, a material with cotton on the underside and polyester bonded on the outside. The road uniform was changed to blue with white pinstripes in 1994–95, although the black uniforms remained in use as alternates.

====Sublimated stars (1998–2003)====
For the Magic&#x27;s 10th anniversary in 1998–99, a new look designed by fashion designer Jhane Barnes was unveiled. The pinstripes were relegated to the sides and the uniforms now featured stars as the background. Both jerseys, made out of the dazzle that was used in the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association uniforms, had the Magic wordmark, with the home jersey in white and the away in blue. For its first two seasons, the original &quot;streaking ball with stars&quot; logo was placed on the waistline, but after the Magic changed its logo in the 2000–01 season, the new &quot;shooting ball with stars&quot; logo was placed on the left leg.

====Back to basics (2003–2008)====
The Magic&#x27;s 15th anniversary in 2003–04 inspired another uniform revamp, opting for a cleaner look without stripes or stars. The home jerseys were white and featured &quot;Magic&quot; in blue block letters with silver and black trim. The away jersey reverted to the city name in white block letters with silver and black trim and was blue. The logo was placed on either side with thin white and black stripes, and a silver star was placed beneath the collar. During this time, the team&#x27;s original pinstriped jerseys were worn several times per year as alternates: black in 2003–04 and 2006–07, blue in 2004–05, and white in 2005–06.

====Pinstripes return (2008–2017)====
For the 2008–09 season, the Magic have once again introduced new uniforms. The Magic returned to the pinstriped uniforms to commemorate the team&#x27;s 20th anniversary. The current design combines the elements of the previous three uniform designs the Magic used in its 20-year history. The home jerseys are white with silver pinstripes, while the away jerseys are blue with white pinstripes. The font used for the number and player/team name has also been updated to a more modern look. Magic alternate logos are on the shorts and the back of the jersey. This is the fourth model in franchise history.

As the Magic moved to the Amway Center in 2010, they unveiled a new logo that for the first time fully spelled &quot;Magic&quot;, without the star instead of the A. They also unveiled a black alternate uniform, with silver pinstripes, mirroring the regular blue road uniform. They were usually worn as throwback uniforms as part of the NBA Hardwood Classics program. A variation of the uniform is also used for Noche Latina every March, with &#x27;Orlando&#x27; substituted for &#x27;El Magic&#x27;, with &#x27;El&#x27; in black and silver trim and &#x27;Magic&#x27; in blue and silver trim. This was unveiled in the 2011–12 season.

=====Silver sleeves and &quot;Stars&quot; jersey=====
In 2014, Magic unveiled a silver uniform for the first time in their history. It was sleeved, and featuring white pinstripes along with blue, black and white trim for the letters and numbers. Unlike the three other uniforms, a different striping pattern will be used on the sides. In 2016, The Magic unveiled a third alternate uniform, featuring carbon as the primary color and without pinstripes. Named “Stars”, it featured the team&#x27;s secondary logo and a blue, white and blue tricolor stripe in front, along with white lettering.

====Nike era (2017–present)====
The Magic made only a few slight tweaks to their uniforms when Nike became the league&#x27;s uniform provider in 2017. From 2017 to 2019, the Magic wore white &quot;Association&quot; uniforms, blue &quot;Icon&quot; uniforms and black &quot;Statement&quot; uniforms. With the exception of the black uniforms eliminating the blue side stripes and changing pinstripe colors from silver to blue, the set remained almost identical to the previous Adidas set. Beginning with the 2019–20 season, the black uniform became the &quot;Icon&quot; uniform while a new blue uniform served as the &quot;Statement&quot; uniform. The uniform was inspired from the different sets the Magic wore through the years, such as the silver star and black stripes with white pinstripes from the 1989–98 set, and the cleaner look of the 2003–08 set. This uniform was then tweaked prior to the 2022–23 season, adding black pinstripes (a nod to the 1989–98 uniforms) and black stripes with subtle star patterns (a nod to the 1998–2003 uniforms). Starting in 2020–21, the &quot;Statement&quot; uniforms would feature Jordan Brand&#x27;s jumpman logo. Their jersey&#x27;s sponsor is Disney.

=====City edition: &quot;Stars&quot;=====
An annual &quot;City&quot; edition is also utilized by Nike to honor either local culture or team tradition. The Magic&#x27;s 2017–18 &quot;City&quot; uniform featured a printed pattern of stars in the sky along with the team&#x27;s alternate logo in front. For the 2018–19 season, the Magic only made slight changes to their &quot;City&quot; uniform, with the printed pattern of stars relegated to the sides and a predominantly black base.

=====City edition: &quot;Orange&quot;=====
The 2019–20 City uniforms featured an &quot;anthracite&quot; (grey) base with orange lettering. The orange color pays homage to Florida&#x27;s orange-growing industry. The Magic kept the orange theme for their 2020–21 &quot;City&quot; uniform, this time with a white base and orange letters and numerals with anthracite trim. The uniform also paid homage to the original uniforms worn from 1989 to 1998, featuring &quot;Orl&quot; beside an anthracite star in its original typeface along with orange pinstripes. When the jersey&#x27;s colors are inverted it shows the exact color scheme used in Orlando&#x27;s original uniforms. In the 2021–22 season, the Magic again reprised the orange theme for its &quot;City&quot; uniform, this time featuring a few elements from previous uniforms.

=====City edition: &quot;Kingdom&quot;=====
For their 2022–23 &quot;City&quot; uniform, the Magic went with a black base, dark gray pinstripes, and gothic-inspired white letters with blue trim to represent the team and the city as a kingdom on the rise. Orlando&#x27;s &quot;City&quot; uniform for the 2023–24 season featured a Gothic-themed design, attributing to Orlando&#x27;s pride and resiliency and the Magic&#x27;s determination to protect its kingdom. The midnight-based jersey incorporated silver stripes meant to evoke a steel cage, along with Gothic script lettering. The Magic&#x27;s &quot;Kingdom&quot; series was again used for the 2024–25 &quot;City&quot; uniform, with the design similar to last season&#x27;s &quot;City&quot; uniform but in a platinum base with midnight blue letters.

=====Earned uniforms=====
Having qualified for the 2020 NBA playoffs the previous year, the Magic were also given an &quot;Earned&quot; uniform. The design, which has a white base, featured the alternate logo in front (an homage to the 2016–17 &quot;Stars&quot; alternate and 2017–19 &quot;City&quot; uniform) and blue numbers with black and silver trim. Side panels featured the stars pattern as an homage to the 1998–2003 blue uniforms.

=====Classic uniforms=====
The Magic are one of seven teams to wear &quot;Classic&quot; uniforms for the 2018–19 season. As part of their 30th anniversary, the team unveiled the blue pinstriped uniform similar to those worn from 1994 to 1998. To commemorate not only its 35th anniversary season, but also the 25th anniversary of the 1999–2000 &quot;Heart and Hustle&quot; team in 2023–24, the Magic donned the blue &quot;sublimated stars&quot; uniform worn from 1999 to 2003.

===Mascot===
Stuff the Magic Dragon has been the Magic&#x27;s mascot since 1989. A dragon designed by Wade Harrison and Bonnie Erickson of Acme Mascots, Inc, his name is a pun on Puff the Magic Dragon, and how a slam dunk is also known as &quot;stuffing&quot;.

==Personnel==

===Current roster===
===Retained draft rights===

A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player&#x27;s draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player&#x27;s contract with the non-NBA team ends. This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams.

==Rivalries==

===Miami Heat===
The Orlando Magic and the Miami Heat had a rivalry because both teams are located in Florida, thus the rivalry was known as the Sunshine State rivalry. Another ingredient to the rivalry was the high-caliber players on both teams such as Orlando&#x27;s Shaquille O&#x27;Neal and Penny Hardaway to Miami&#x27;s Alonzo Mourning and Tim Hardaway. The two had met each other in the NBA playoffs for the first time in 1997, with Miami beating Orlando 3–2, they have not met in the playoffs since.

The rivalry intensified during the 2000s and early 2010s with the rising stardom of Miami&#x27;s and Orlando&#x27;s Dwyane Wade and Dwight Howard, respectively, along with Miami&#x27;s acquiring high caliber stars such LeBron James from the Cleveland Cavaliers and Chris Bosh from the Toronto Raptors and in 2010, resulting in fierce competition between the two.

When Dwight Howard departed from the Magic to the Los Angeles Lakers in August 2012, the rivalry softened. The Orlando Magic have been going through a process of rebuilding ever since then.

===Atlanta Hawks===
The Atlanta Hawks and the Orlando Magic had an intense rivalry, mostly stemming from playoff competitions and the rising stardom of Dwight Howard and Josh Smith, both from the 2004 NBA draft and who were both raised in Georgia.

The two teams faced each other three times in the 1996, 2010, and 2011 NBA playoffs. The Magic defeated the Hawks in the second round of the 1996 playoffs 4–1, and swept the second-round series 4–0 in the 2010 playoffs, while the Hawks eliminated the Magic 4–2 in the first round of the corresponding 2011 playoffs.

==Media==
===Television===
The current television announcing team for the Orlando Magic is play-by-play announcer David Steele and color analyst Jeff Turner. Turner played for the Magic from its inaugural 1989 season to 1996. Paul Kennedy and Dante Marchetelli serve as courtside reporters, while Marchetelli, former coach Brian Hill, and former Magic player Nick Anderson host the pre-game, halftime and post-game shows. Television broadcasts were split in 2007–08 between Fox Sports Florida and Sun Sports (later Fox Sports Sun, currently Bally Sports Sun). In the 18 years before then, broadcasts were split between Sun Sports (formerly known as the Sunshine Network) and local television stations, originally WKCF and, later, WRBW.

There was a controversy with moving broadcasts to Fox Sports Florida since Orlando&#x27;s largest cable TV provider, Bright House Networks, did not carry the network. Pressure increased for the cable provider to pick up FS Florida in time for the 2007–08 NBA season but this did not happen. The Magic persisted with airing games on FS Florida into the 2008–09 season despite Bright House&#x27;s refusal to pick up the channel in all of its affiliates. Bright House and FS Florida came to an agreement on January 1, 2009, and began airing the channel as part of its standard cable package. However, Bright House airs the channel using a digital signal that only allows customers who own the Digital cable box to receive the channel. The customers do not have to pay any additional costs to get the channel with their Digital cable box.

As of the 2020–21 season, all Magic games are now on Bally Sports Florida.

===Radio===
After the end of the 2019–20 season, the Orlando Magic decided to not to renew its contract with play-by-play announcer Dennis Neumann and color analyst Richie Adubato, another former Magic head coach. Games are produced by Magic Radio Network flagship AM 580 WDBO in Orlando, and also broadcast on AM 1380 WELE in Daytona Beach, 99.5 FM WGMW &quot;The Star&quot; in Gainesville and Ocala, AM 1290 WPCF in Panama City, AM 1590 WPSL in Port St. Lucie and AM 1450 WSTU in Stuart. The affiliate in Tallahassee is AM 1270 &quot;My 94.3&quot; WTLY. The immediate Tampa Bay area has no affiliate although AM 1340 in Clearwater WTAN is listed on the team&#x27;s website. The Magic will continue to have a radio presence using the audio from its television broadcasts.

The flagship broadcast was simulcast on WDBO-FM during the 2011–12 NBA season while that station moved from AM to FM. When WDBO re-formatted from talk radio to sports radio, it retained the flagship status. However, WOEX (the former WDBO-FM) still simulcasts Magic games in Central Florida.

===Podcasts===
The official Orlando Magic website features a collection of podcasts available on iTunes, including &quot;Magic Overtime with Dante and Galante&quot;.
