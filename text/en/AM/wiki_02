<text>Boric acid, more specifically orthoboric acid, is a compound of boron, oxygen, and hydrogen with formula . It may also be called hydrogen [[orthoborate]], trihydroxidoboron or boracic acid. It is usually encountered as colorless crystals or a white powder, that dissolves in water, and occurs in nature as the mineral sassolite. It is a weak acid that yields various borate anions and salts, and can react with alcohols to form borate esters.

Boric acid is often used as an antiseptic, insecticide, flame retardant, neutron absorber, or precursor to other boron compounds.

The term &quot;boric acid&quot; is also used generically for any oxyacid of boron, such as metaboric acid and tetraboric acid .

==History==
Orthoboric acid was first prepared by Wilhelm Homberg (1652–1715) from borax, by the action of mineral acids, and was given the name (&quot;sedative salt of Homberg&quot;). However boric acid and borates have been used since the time of the ancient Greeks for cleaning, preserving food, and other activities.

==Molecular and crystal structure==
The three oxygen atoms form a trigonal planar geometry around the boron. The B-O bond length is 136 pm and the O-H is 97 pm. The molecular point group is &quot;C&quot;3h.

Two crystalline forms of orthoboric acid are known: triclinic with space group P, and trigonal with space group P32. The former is the most common; the second, which is a bit more stable thermodynamically, can be obtained with a special preparation method.

The triclinic form of boric acid consists of layers of molecules held together by hydrogen bonds with an O...O separation of 272 pm. The distance between two adjacent layers is 318 pm. While the layers of the triclinic phase are nearly trigonal with , , and (compared to for the trigonal form), the stacking of the layers is somewhat offset in the triclinic phase, with and . The triclinic phase has and the trigonal one has .

==Preparation==
Boric acid may be prepared by reacting borax (sodium tetraborate decahydrate) with a mineral acid, such as hydrochloric acid:

: ·10 + 2 HCl → 4 + 2 NaCl + 5 

It is also formed as a by product of hydrolysis of boron trihalides and diborane:

: + 6 → 2 + 6 

: + 3 → + 3 HX (X = Cl, Br, I)

==Reactions==
===Pyrolysis===
When heated, orthoboric acid undergoes a three step dehydration. The reported transition temperatures vary substantially from source to source.

When heated above 140 °C, orthoboric acid yields metaboric acid () with loss of one water molecule:

Heating metaboric acid above about 180 °C eliminates another water molecule forming tetraboric acid, also called pyroboric acid ():

: 4 → + 

Further heating (to about 530 °C) leads to boron trioxide:

: → 2 + 

===Aqueous solution===
When orthoboric acid is dissolved in water, it partially dissociates to give metaboric acid:
The solution is mildly acidic due to ionization of the acids:
: + + 

However, Raman spectroscopy of strongly alkaline solutions has shown the presence of ions, leading some to conclude that the acidity is exclusively due to the abstraction of from water:
Equivalently,
: + + (&quot;K&quot;a = 7.3×10−10; p&quot;K&quot;a = 9.14)
Or, more properly,
: + 2 + 
This reaction occurs in two steps, with the neutral complex aquatrihydroxyboron as an intermediate:
# + → + 

This reaction may be characterized as Lewis acidity of boron toward , rather than as Brønsted acidity. However, some of its behaviour towards some chemical reactions suggest it to be a tribasic acid in the Brønsted-Lowry sense as well.

Boric acid, mixed with borax (more properly ) in the weight ratio of 4:5, is highly soluble in water, though they are not so soluble separately.

===Sulfuric acid solution===
Boric acid also dissolves in anhydrous sulfuric acid according to the equation:
: + 6 → + 2 + 3 
The product is an extremely strong acid, even stronger than the original sulfuric acid.

===Esterification===
Boric acid reacts with alcohols to form borate esters, where R is alkyl or aryl. The reaction is typically driven by a dehydrating agent, such as concentrated sulfuric acid:

: + 3 ROH → + 3 

===With vicinal diols===
The acidity of boric acid solutions is greatly increased in the presence of cis-vicinal diols (organic compounds containing similarly oriented hydroxyl groups in adjacent carbon atoms, ) such as glycerol and mannitol.

The tetrahydroxyborate anion formed in the dissolution spontaneously reacts with these diols to form relatively stable anion esters containing one or two five-member rings. For example, the reaction with mannitol , whose two middle hydroxyls are in &quot;cis&quot; orientation, can be written as
: + + 2 
: + + 2 
Giving the overall reaction 
: + 2 + 3 + 

The stability of these mannitoborate ester anions shifts the equilibrium of the right and thus increases the acidity of the solution by 5 orders of magnitude compared to that of pure boric oxide, lowering the p&quot;K&quot;a from 9 to below 4 for sufficient concentration of mannitol. The resulting solution has been called mannitoboric acid.

The addition of mannitol to an initially neutral solution containing boric acid or simple borates lowers its pH enough for it to be titrated by a strong base as NaOH, including with an automated a potentiometric titrator. This property is used in analytical chemistry to determine the borate content of aqueous solutions, for example to monitor the depletion of boric acid by neutrons in the water of the primary circuit of light-water reactor when the compound is added as a neutron poison during refueling operations.

==Toxicology==
Based on mammalian median lethal dose (LD50) rating of 2,660 mg/kg body mass, boric acid is only poisonous if taken internally or inhaled in large quantities. The Fourteenth Edition of the &quot;Merck Index&quot; indicates that the LD50 of boric acid is 5.14 g/kg for oral dosages given to rats, and that 5 to 20 g/kg has produced death in adult humans. For a 70 kg adult, at the lower 5 g/kg limit, 350 g could produce death in humans. For comparison&#x27;s sake, the LD50 of salt is reported to be 3.75 g/kg in rats according to the &quot;Merck Index&quot;. According to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, &quot;The minimal lethal dose of ingested boron (as boric acid) was reported to be 2–3 g in infants, 5–6 g in children, and 15–20 g in adults. [...] However, a review of 784 human poisonings with boric acid (10–88 g) reported no fatalities, with 88% of cases being asymptomatic.&quot; Human studies in three borate exposure rich comparison groups (U.S. Borax mine and production facility workers, Chinese boron workers, Turkish residents living near boron rich regions) produced no indicators of developmental toxicity in blood and semen tests. Highest estimated exposure was 5 mg B/kg/day likely due to eating in contaminated workplaces, more than 100 times the average daily exposure. 

Long-term exposure to boric acid may be of more concern, causing kidney damage and eventually kidney failure (see links below). Although it does not appear to be carcinogenic, studies in dogs have reported testicular atrophy after exposure to 32 mg/(kg⋅day) for 90 days. This level, were it applicable to humans at like dose, would equate to a cumulative dose of 202 g over 90 days for a 70 kg adult, not far lower than the above LD50.

According to the CLH report for boric acid published by the Bureau for Chemical Substances Lodz, Poland, boric acid in high doses shows significant developmental toxicity and teratogenicity in rabbit, rat, and mouse fetuses, as well as cardiovascular defects, skeletal variations, and mild kidney lesions. As a consequence in the 30th ATP to EU directive 67/548/EEC of August 2008, the European Commission decided to amend its classification as reprotoxic category 2 and to apply the risk phrases R60 (may impair fertility) and R61 (may cause harm to the unborn child).

At a 2010 European Diagnostics Manufacturing Association (EDMA) Meeting, several new additions to the substance of very high concern (SVHC) candidate list in relation to the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals Regulations 2007 (REACH) were discussed. Following the registration and review completed as part of REACH, the classification of boric acid CAS 10043-35-3 / 11113-50-1 is listed from 1 December 2010 is &quot;H360FD (May damage fertility. May damage the unborn child)&quot;.

==Uses==
===Industrial===
The primary industrial use of boric acid is in the manufacture of monofilament fiberglass usually referred to as textile fiberglass. Textile fiberglass is used to reinforce plastics in applications that range from boats, to industrial piping to computer circuit boards.

In the jewelry industry, boric acid is often used in combination with denatured alcohol to reduce surface oxidation and formation of firescale on metals during annealing and soldering operations.

Boric acid is used in the production of the glass in LCD flat panel displays.

In electroplating, boric acid is used as part of some proprietary formulas. One known formula uses about a 1 to 10 ratio of to , a very small portion of sodium lauryl sulfate and a small portion of .

The solution of orthoboric acid and borax in 4:5 ratio is used as a fire retarding agent of wood by impregnation.

It is also used in the manufacturing of ramming mass, a fine silica-containing powder used for producing induction furnace linings and ceramics.

Boric acid is added to borax for use as welding flux by blacksmiths.

Boric acid, in combination with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) or silicone oil, is used to manufacture Silly Putty.

Boric acid is also present in the list of chemical additives used for hydraulic fracturing (fracking) in the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania. It is often used in conjunction with guar gum as cross-linking and gelling agent for controlling the viscosity and the rheology of the fracking fluid injected at high pressure in the well. It is important to control the fluid viscosity for keeping in suspension on long transport distances the grains of the propping agents aimed at maintaining the cracks in the shales sufficiently open to facilitate the gas extraction after the hydraulic pressure is relieved. The rheological properties of borate cross-linked guar gum hydrogel mainly depend on the pH value.

Boric acid is used in some expulsion-type electrical fuses as a de-ionization/extinguishing agent. During an electrical fault in an expulsion-type fuse, a plasma arc is generated by the disintegration and rapid spring-loaded separation of the fusible element, which is typically a specialized metal rod that passes through a compressed mass of boric acid within the fuse assembly. The high-temperature plasma causes the boric acid to rapidly decompose into water vapor and boric anhydride, and in-turn, the vaporization products de-ionize the plasma, helping to interrupt the electrical fault.

===Medical===
Boric acid can be used as an antiseptic for minor burns or cuts and is sometimes used in salves and dressings, such as boracic lint. Boric acid is applied in a very dilute solution as an eye wash. Boric acid vaginal suppositories can be used for recurrent candidiasis due to non-albicans candida as a second line treatment when conventional treatment has failed. It is less effective than conventional treatment overall. Boric acid largely spares lactobacilli within the vagina. As TOL-463, it is under development as an intravaginal medication for the treatment for vulvovaginal candidiasis. 

As an antibacterial compound, boric acid can also be used as an acne treatment. It is also used as prevention of athlete&#x27;s foot, by inserting powder in the socks or stockings. Various preparations can be used to treat some kinds of (ear infection) in both humans and animals. The preservative in urine sample bottles in the UK is boric acid.

Boric acid solutions used as an eye wash or on abraded skin are known to be toxic, particularly to infants, especially after repeated use; this is because of its slow elimination rate.

Boric acid is one of the most commonly used substances that can counteract the harmful effects of reactive hydrofluoric acid (HF) after an accidental contact with the skin. It works by forcing the free anions into the inert tetrafluoroborate anion. This process defeats the extreme toxicity of hydrofluoric acid, particularly its ability to sequester ionic calcium from blood serum which can lead to cardiac arrest and bone decomposition; such an event can occur from just minor skin contact with HF.

===Insecticidal===
Boric acid was first registered in the US as an insecticide in 1948 for control of cockroaches, termites, fire ants, fleas, silverfish, and many other insects. The product is generally considered to be safe to use in household kitchens to control cockroaches and ants. It acts as a stomach poison affecting the insects&#x27; metabolism, and the dry powder is abrasive to the insects&#x27; exoskeletons. It is in non-specific IRAC group 8D. Boric acid also has the reputation as &quot;the gift that keeps on killing&quot; in that cockroaches that cross over lightly dusted areas do not die immediately, but that the effect is like shards of glass cutting them apart. This often allows a roach to go back to the nest where it soon dies. Cockroaches, being cannibalistic, eat others killed by contact or consumption of boric acid, consuming the powder trapped in the dead roach and killing them, too.

Boric acid has also been widely used in the treatment of wood for protection against termites. The full complexity of its mechanism is not fully understood, but aside from causing dose-dependent mortality, boric acid causes dysbiosis in the Eastern Subterranean termite, leading to the opportunistic rise of insect pathogens that could be contributing to mortality. In Japan the practice of laying newspapers treated with o-boric acid and borax under buildings has been effective in controlling Coptotermes formosanus and Reticulitermes speratus populations. Decaying wood treated with 0.25 to 0.5 percent DOT was also found to be effective for baiting Heterotermes aureus populations. A 1997 paper concluded: &quot;Borate baits would undoubtably be helpful in the long-term, but do not appear sufficient as a sole method of structural protection.&quot;

===Preservation===
In combination with its use as an insecticide, boric acid also prevents and destroys existing wet and dry rot in timbers. It can be used in combination with an ethylene glycol carrier to treat external wood against fungal and insect attack. It is possible to buy borate-impregnated rods for insertion into wood via drill holes where dampness and moisture is known to collect and sit. It is available in a gel form and injectable paste form for treating rot affected wood without the need to replace the timber. Concentrates of borate-based treatments can be used to prevent slime, mycelium, and algae growth, even in marine environments.

Boric acid is added to salt in the curing of cattle hides, calfskins, and sheepskins. This helps to control bacterial development, and helps to control insects.

===pH buffer===
Boric acid in equilibrium with its conjugate base the borate ion is widely used (in the concentration range 50–100 ppm boron equivalents) as a primary or adjunct pH buffer system in swimming pools. Boric acid is a weak acid, with p&quot;K&quot; (the pH at which buffering is strongest because the free acid and borate ion are in equal concentrations) of 9.24 in pure water at 25 °C. But apparent p&quot;K&quot; is substantially lower in swimming pool or ocean waters because of interactions with various other molecules in solution. It will be around 9.0 in a salt-water pool. No matter which form of soluble boron is added, within the acceptable range of pH and boron concentration for swimming pools, boric acid is the predominant form in aqueous solution, as shown in the accompanying figure. The boric acid – borate system can be useful as a primary buffer system (substituting for the bicarbonate system with p&quot;K&quot; = 6.0 and p&quot;K&quot; = 9.4 under typical salt-water pool conditions) in pools with salt-water chlorine generators that tend to show upward drift in pH from a working range of pH 7.5–8.2. Buffer capacity is greater against rising pH (towards the pKa around 9.0), as illustrated in the accompanying graph. The use of boric acid in this concentration range does not allow any reduction in free HOCl concentration needed for pool sanitation, but it may add marginally to the photo-protective effects of cyanuric acid and confer other benefits through anti-corrosive activity or perceived water softness, depending on overall pool solute composition.

===Lubrication===
Colloidal suspensions of nanoparticles of boric acid dissolved in petroleum or vegetable oil can form a remarkable lubricant on ceramic or metal surfaces with a coefficient of sliding friction that decreases with increasing pressure to a value ranging from 0.10 to 0.02. Self-lubricating films result from a spontaneous chemical reaction between water molecules and coatings in a humid environment. In bulk-scale, an inverse relationship exists between friction coefficient and Hertzian contact pressure induced by applied load.

Boric acid is used to lubricate carrom and novuss boards, allowing for faster play.

===Nuclear power===
Boric acid is used in some nuclear power plants as a neutron poison. The boron in boric acid reduces the probability of thermal fission by absorbing some thermal neutrons. Fission chain reactions are generally driven by the probability that free neutrons will result in fission and is determined by the material and geometric properties of the reactor. Natural boron consists of approximately 20% boron-10 and 80% boron-11 isotopes. Boron-10 has a high cross-section for absorption of low energy (thermal) neutrons. By increasing boric acid concentration in the reactor coolant, the probability that a neutron will cause fission is reduced. Changes in boric acid concentration can effectively regulate the rate of fission taking place in the reactor. During normal at power operation, boric acid is used only in pressurized water reactors (PWRs), whereas boiling water reactors (BWRs) employ control rod pattern and coolant flow for power control, although BWRs can use an aqueous solution of boric acid and borax or sodium pentaborate for an emergency shutdown system if the control rods fail to insert. Boric acid may be dissolved in spent fuel pools used to store spent fuel elements. The concentration is high enough to keep neutron multiplication at a minimum. Boric acid was dumped over Reactor 4 of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant after its meltdown to prevent another reaction from occurring.

===Pyrotechnics===
Boron is used in pyrotechnics to prevent the amide-forming reaction between aluminium and nitrates. A small amount of boric acid is added to the composition to neutralize alkaline amides that can react with the aluminium.

Boric acid can be used as a colorant to make fire green. For example, when dissolved in methanol it is popularly used by fire jugglers and fire spinners to create a deep green flame much stronger than copper sulfate.

===Agriculture===
Boric acid is used to treat or prevent boron deficiencies in plants. It is also used in preservation of grains such as rice and wheat.

<text>The Saskatoon Yellow Jackets were a baseball team that played in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. The team was a member of the Western Major Baseball League, a collegiate summer baseball league operating in the prairie provinces of Canada. The team joined the league in 2002, but struggled financially throughout its existence and folded in 2014.

== Team history ==
The Yellow Jackets began play out of Cairns Field in 2002. The team changed ownership multiple times and struggled with fan engagement. The team also struggled on the field, and missed the playoffs for six straight seasons from 2009 to 2014, finishing at the bottom of the Central division each of those years. The team folded in 2014. This left Saskatoon without a WMBL team until the city was awarded an expansion franchise, the Saskatoon Berries, in 2023.

In August 2017, two former Yellow Jackets dressed for the Seattle Mariners, marking the first time that two WMBL players dressed for the same Major League Baseball team. Andrew Albers, from North Battleford, pitched five innings on 15 August, while Marco Gonzales took the mound on 16 August.

<text>An antiseptic ( and ) is an antimicrobial substance or compound that is applied to living tissue to reduce the possibility of sepsis, infection, or putrefaction. Antiseptics are generally distinguished from &quot;antibiotics&quot; by the latter&#x27;s ability to safely destroy bacteria within the body, and from &quot;disinfectants&quot;, which destroy microorganisms found on non-living objects.

Antibacterials include antiseptics that have the proven ability to act against bacteria. Microbicides which destroy virus particles are called viricides or antivirals. Antifungals, also known as antimycotics, are pharmaceutical fungicides used to treat and prevent mycosis (fungal infection).

==Surgery==
Antiseptic practices evolved in the 19th century through multiple individuals. Ignaz Semmelweis showed already in 1847-1848 that hand washing prior to delivery reduced puerperal fever. Despite this, many hospitals continued to practice surgery in unsanitary conditions, with some surgeons taking pride in their bloodstained operating gowns.Only a decade later the situation started to change, when some French surgeons started to adopt carbolic acid as an antiseptic, reducing surgical infection rates, followed by their Italian colleagues in the 1860s. In 1867 Joseph Lister published seminal paper &quot;Antiseptic Principle of the Practice of Surgery&quot;, where he explained this reduction in terms of Louis Pasteur&#x27;s germ theory. Thus he was able to popularize the antiseptic surgical methods in the English-speaking world.

Some of this work was anticipated by:
* Ancient Greek physicians Galen () and Hippocrates () as well as Sumerian clay tablets dating from 2150 BC that advocate the use of similar techniques.
* Florence Nightingale, who contributed substantially to the report of the Royal Commission on the Health of the Army (1856–1857), based on her earlier work
* Medieval surgeons Hugh of Lucca, Theoderic of Servia, and his pupil Henri de Mondeville were opponents of Galen&#x27;s opinion that pus was important to healing, which had led ancient and medieval surgeons to let pus remain in wounds. They advocated draining and cleaning the wound edges with wine, dressing the wound after suturing, if necessary and leaving the dressing on for ten days, soaking it in warm wine all the while, before changing it. Their theories were bitterly opposed by Galenist Guy de Chauliac and others trained in the classical tradition.
* Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr., who published &quot;The Contagiousness of Puerperal Fever&quot; in 1843

==Some common antiseptics==

Antiseptics can be subdivided into about eight classes of materials. These classes can be subdivided according to their mechanism of action: small molecules that indiscriminately react with organic compounds and kill microorganisms (peroxides, iodine, phenols) and more complex molecules that disrupt the cell walls of the bacteria.
* Alcohols, including ethanol and 2-propanol/isopropanol are sometimes referred to as &quot;surgical spirit&quot;. They are used to disinfect the skin before injections, among other uses.
* Diguanides including chlorhexidine gluconate, a bacteriocidal antiseptic which (with an alcoholic solvent) is considered a safe and effective antiseptic for reducing the risk of infection after clean surgery, including tourniquet-controlled upper limb surgery. It is also used in mouthwashes to treat inflammation of the gums (gingivitis). Polyhexanide (polyhexamethylene biguanide, PHMB) is an antimicrobial compound suitable for clinical use in critically colonized or infected acute and chronic wounds. The physicochemical action on the bacterial envelope prevents or impedes the development of resistant bacterial strains.
* Iodine, especially in the form of povidone-iodine, is widely used because it is well tolerated; does not negatively affect wound healing; leaves a deposit of active iodine, thereby creating the so-called &quot;remnant&quot;, or persistent effect; and has wide scope of antimicrobial activity. The traditional iodine antiseptic is an alcohol solution (called tincture of iodine) or as Lugol&#x27;s iodine solution. Some studies do not recommend disinfecting minor wounds with iodine because of concern that it may induce scar tissue formation and increase healing time. However, concentrations of 1% iodine or less have not been shown to increase healing time and are not otherwise distinguishable from treatment with saline. Iodine will kill all principal pathogens and, given enough time, even spores, which are considered to be the most difficult form of microorganisms to be inactivated by disinfectants and antiseptics.
* Octenidine dihydrochloride, currently increasingly used in continental Europe, often as a chlorhexidine substitute.
* Peroxides, such as hydrogen peroxide and benzoyl peroxide. Commonly, 3% solutions of hydrogen peroxide have been used in household first aid for scrapes, etc. However, the strong oxidization causes scar formation and increases healing time during fetal development.
* Phenols such as phenol itself (as introduced by Lister) and triclosan, hexachlorophene, chlorocresol, and chloroxylenol. The fact that the more substituted and more lipophylic phenols are less toxic, less irritant and more powerful was gradually discovered in late 19th century. Nowadays comparatively more water-soluble phenols such as chlorocresol are commonly used as preservatives in personal care products while less soluble such as chloroxylenol – as topical antiseptics. Both can be encountered in household disinfectants.
* Quat salts such as benzalkonium chloride/lidocaine (trade name Bactine among others), cetylpyridinium chloride, or cetrimide. These surfactants disrupt cell walls.
* Quinolines such as hydroxyquinolone, dequalium chloride, or chlorquinaldol.
* 4-Hexylresorcinol, or S.T.37

<text>A borate is any of a range of boron oxyanions, anions containing boron and oxygen, such as orthoborate , metaborate , or tetraborate ; or any salt of such anions, such as sodium metaborate, and borax . The name also refers to esters of such anions, such as trimethyl borate .

==Natural occurrence==
Borate ions occur, alone or with other anions, in many borate and borosilicate minerals such as borax, boracite, ulexite (boronatrocalcite) and colemanite. Borates also occur in seawater, where they make an important contribution to the absorption of low frequency sound in seawater.

Borates also occur in plants, including almost all fruits.

==Anions==
The main borate anions are:
* tetrahydroxyborate , found in sodium tetrahydroxyborate .
* orthoborate , found in trisodium orthoborate 
* , found in the calcium yttrium borosilicate oxyapatite 
* perborate , as in sodium perborate 
* metaborate or its cyclic trimer , found in sodium metaborate 
* diborate , found in magnesium diborate (suanite) ,
* triborate , found in calcium aluminium triborate (johachidolite) ,
* tetraborate , found in anhydrous borax 
* tetrahydroxytetraborate , found in borax &quot;decahydrate&quot; 
* tetraborate(6-) found in lithium tetraborate(6-) 
* pentaborate or , found in sodium pentaborate 
* octaborate found in disodium octaborate 

==Preparation==

In 1905, Burgess and Holt observed that fusing mixtures of boric oxide and sodium carbonate yielded on cooling two crystalline compounds with definite compositions, consistent with anhydrous borax (which can be written ) and sodium octaborate (which can be written ).

==Structures==
Borate anions (and functional groups) consist of trigonal planar and/or tetrahedral structural units, joined together via shared oxygen atoms (corners) or atom pairs (edges) into larger clusters so as to construct various ions such as , , , , , etc. These anions may be cyclic or linear in structure, and can further polymerize into infinite chains, layers, and tridimensional frameworks. The terminal (unshared) oxygen atoms in the borate anions may be capped with hydrogen atoms () or may carry a negative charge ().

The planar units may be stacked in the crystal lattice so as to have π-conjugated molecular orbitals, which often results in useful optical properties such as strong harmonics generation, birefringence, and UV transmission.

Polymeric borate anions may have linear chains of 2, 3 or 4 trigonal structural units, each sharing oxygen atoms with adjacent unit(s). as in , contain chains of trigonal structural units. Other anions contain cycles; for instance,  and contain the cyclic ion, consisting of a six-membered ring of alternating boron and oxygen atoms with one extra oxygen atom attached to each boron atom.

The thermal expansion of crystalline borates is dominated by the fact that and polyhedra and rigid groups consisting of these polyhedra practically do not change their configuration and size upon heating, but sometimes rotate like hinges, which results in greatly anisotropic thermal expansion including linear negative expansion.
==Reactions==
===Aqueous solution===

In aqueous solution, boric acid can act as a weak Brønsted acid, that is, a proton donor, with p&quot;K&quot;a ~ 9. However, it more often acts as a Lewis acid, accepting an electron pair from a hydroxide ion produced by the water autoprotolysis:

: + 2 + (p&quot;K&quot; = 8.98)

This reaction is very fast, with characteristic time less than 10 μs. Polymeric boron oxoanions are formed in aqueous solution of boric acid at pH 7–10 if the boron concentration is higher than about 0.025 mol/L. The best known of these is the tetraborate ion , found in the mineral borax:

:4 + 2 + 7 

Other anions observed in solution are triborate(1−) and pentaborate(1−), in equilibrium with boric acid and tetrahydroxyborate according to the following overall reactions:

: 2 + + 3 (fast, p&quot;K&quot; = —1.92)

: 4 + + 6 (slow, p&quot;K&quot; = —2.05)

In the pH range 6.8 to 8.0, any alkali salts of &quot;boric oxide&quot; anions with general formula where 3&quot;x&quot;+&quot;q&quot; = 2&quot;y&quot; + &quot;z&quot; will eventually equilibrate in solution to a mixture of , , , and .

These ions, similarly to the complexed borates mentioned above, are more acidic than boric acid itself. As a result of this, the pH of a concentrated polyborate solution will increase more than expected when diluted with water.

===Borate salts===
A number of metal borates are known. They can be obtained by treating boric acid or boron oxides with metal oxides.

===Mixed anion salts===
Some chemicals contain another anion in addition to borate. These include borate chlorides, borate carbonates, borate nitrates, borate sulfates, borate phosphates.

===Complex oxyanions containing boron===
More complex anions can be formed by condensing borate triangles or tetrahedra with other oxyanions to yield materials such as borosulfates, boroselenates, borotellurates, boroantimonates, borophosphates, or boroselenites.

Borosilicate glass, also known as pyrex, can be viewed as a silicate in which some [SiO4]4− units are replaced by [BO4]5− centers, together with additional cations to compensate for the difference in valence states of Si(IV) and B(III). Because this substitution leads to imperfections, the material is slow to crystallise and forms a glass with low coefficient of thermal expansion, thus resistant to cracking when heated, unlike soda glass.

==Uses==
Common borate salts include sodium metaborate (NaBO2) and borax. Borax is soluble in water, so mineral deposits only occur in places with very low rainfall. Extensive deposits were found in Death Valley and shipped with twenty-mule teams from 1883 to 1889. In 1925, deposits were found at Boron, California on the edge of the Mojave Desert. The Atacama Desert in Chile also contains mineable borate concentrations.

Lithium metaborate, lithium tetraborate, or a mixture of both, can be used in borate fusion sample preparation of various samples for analysis by XRF, AAS, ICP-OES and ICP-MS. Borate fusion and energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometry with polarized excitation have been used in the analysis of contaminated soils.

Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate (commonly abbreviated DOT) is used as a wood preservative or fungicide. Zinc borate is used as a flame retardant.

Some borates with large anions and multiple cations, like and have been considered for applications in nonlinear optics.

== Borate esters==
Borate esters are organic compounds, which are conveniently prepared by the stoichiometric condensation reaction of boric acid with alcohols (or their chalcogen analogs).

== Thin films ==
Metal borate thin films have been grown by a variety of techniques, including liquid-phase epitaxy (e.g. FeBO3, β-BaB2O4), electron-beam evaporation (e.g. CrBO3, β-BaB2O4), pulsed laser deposition (e.g. β-BaB2O4,  Eu(BO2)3), and atomic layer deposition (ALD). Growth by ALD was achieved using precursors composed of the tris(pyrazolyl)borate ligand and either ozone or water as the oxidant to deposit CaB2O4, SrB2O4, BaB2O4, Mn3(BO3)2, and CoB2O4 films.

==Physiology==
Borate anions are largely in the form of the undissociated acid in aqueous solution at physiological pH. No further metabolism occurs in either animals or plants. In animals, boric acid/borate salts are essentially completely absorbed following oral ingestion. Absorption occurs via inhalation, although quantitative data are unavailable. Limited data indicate that boric acid/salts are not absorbed through intact skin to any significant extent, although absorption occurs through skin that is severely abraded. It distributes throughout the body and is not retained in tissues, except for bone, and is rapidly excreted in the urine.

<text>Borax (also referred to as sodium borate, tincal () and tincar ()) is a salt (ionic compound), a hydrated or anhydrous borate of sodium, with the chemical formula .

It is a colorless crystalline solid that dissolves in water to make a basic solution.

It is commonly available in powder or granular form and has many industrial and household uses, including as a pesticide, as a metal soldering flux, as a component of glass, enamel, and pottery glazes, for tanning of skins and hides, for artificial aging of wood, as a preservative against wood fungus, and as a pharmaceutic alkalizer. In chemical laboratories, it is used as a buffering agent.

The terms &quot;tincal&quot; and &quot;tincar&quot; refer to native borax, historically mined from dry lake beds in various parts of Asia.

== History ==
Borax was first discovered in dry lake beds in Tibet. Native tincal from Tibet, Persia, and other parts of Asia was traded via the Silk Road to the Arabian Peninsula in the 8th century AD.

Borax first came into common use in the late 19th century when Francis Marion Smith&#x27;s Pacific Coast Borax Company began to market and popularize a large variety of applications under the 20 Mule Team Borax trademark, named for the method by which borax was originally hauled out of the California and Nevada deserts.

== Etymology ==
The English word &quot;borax&quot; is Latinized: the Middle English form was , from Old French . That may have been from Medieval Latin (another English spelling), , along with Spanish (&gt; ) and Italian , in the 9th century, and from Arabic () 

The words &quot;tincal&quot; and &quot;tincar&quot; were adopted into English in the 17th century from Malay and from Urdu/Persian/Arabic ; thus the two forms in English. These all appear to be related to the Sanskrit .

== Chemistry ==
From a chemical perspective, borax contains the [B4O5(OH)4]2− ion. In this structure, there are two four-coordinate boron centers and two three-coordinate boron centers.

It is a proton conductor at temperatures above 21 °C. Conductivity is maximum along the &quot;b-&quot;axis.

Borax is also easily converted to boric acid and other borates, which have many applications. Its reaction with hydrochloric acid to form boric acid is:
Borax is sufficiently stable to find use as a primary standard for acid-base titrimetry.

Molten borax dissolves many metal oxides to form glasses. This property is important for its uses in metallurgy and for the borax bead test of qualitative chemical analysis.

Borax is soluble in a variety of solvents; however, it is notably insoluble in ethanol.

The term &quot;borax&quot; properly refers to the so-called &quot;decahydrate&quot; , but that name is not consistent with its structure. It is actually octahydrate. The anion is not tetraborate but tetrahydroxy tetraborate , so the more correct formula should be . However, the term may be applied also to the related compounds. Borax &quot;pentahydrate&quot; has the formula , which is actually a trihydrate . It is a colorless solid with a density of 1.880 kg/m3 that crystallizes from water solutions above 60.8 °C in the rhombohedral crystal system. It occurs naturally as the mineral tinkhanite. It can be obtained by heating the &quot;decahydrate&quot; above 61 °C. Borax &quot;dihydrate&quot; has the formula , which is actually anhydrous, with the correct formula . It can be obtained by heating the &quot;decahydrate&quot; or &quot;pentahydrate&quot; to above 116-120 °C. Anhydrous borax is sodium tetraborate proper, with formula . It can be obtained by heating any hydrate to 300 °C. It has one amorphous (glassy) form and three crystalline forms – α, β, and γ, with melting points of 1015, 993 and 936 K respectively. α- is the stable form.

== Natural sources ==

Borax occurs naturally in evaporite deposits produced by the repeated evaporation of seasonal lakes. The most commercially important deposits are found in: Turkey; Boron, California; and Searles Lake, California. Also, borax has been found at many other locations in the Southwestern United States, the Atacama Desert in Chile, newly discovered deposits in Bolivia, and in Tibet and Romania. Borax can also be produced synthetically from other boron compounds.

Naturally occurring borax (known by the trade name Rasorite–46 in the United States and many other countries) is refined by a process of recrystallization.
== Uses ==
Borax is used in pest control solutions because it is toxic to ants and rats. Because it is slow-acting, worker ants will carry the borax to their nests and poison the rest of the colony. Borax is more effective than zinc borate for termite control but a 1997 paper concluded that exposing at least 10% of the total colony population was needed for effective treatment. In Japan the practice of laying newspapers treated with o-boric acid and borax under buildings has been effective in controlling Coptotermes formosanus and Reticulitermes speratus populations. Decaying wood treated with 0.25 to 0.5 percent DOT was also found to be effective for baiting Heterotermes aureus populations. The paper concluded: &quot;Borate baits would undoubtably be helpful in the long-term, but do not appear sufficient as a sole method of structural protection.&quot;

Borax is used in various household laundry and cleaning products, including the 20 Mule Team Borax laundry booster, Boraxo powdered hand soap, and some tooth bleaching formulas.

Borate ions (commonly supplied as boric acid) are used in biochemical and chemical laboratories to make buffers, e.g. for polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of DNA and RNA, such as TBE buffer (borate buffered tris-hydroxymethylaminomethonium) or the newer SB buffer or BBS buffer (borate buffered saline) in coating procedures. Borate buffers (usually at pH 8) are also used as preferential equilibration solutions in dimethyl pimelimidate (DMP) based crosslinking reactions.

Borax as a source of borate has been used to take advantage of the co-complexing ability of borate with other agents in water to form complex ions with various substances. Borate and a suitable polymer bed are used to chromatograph non-glycated hemoglobin differentially from glycated hemoglobin (chiefly HbA1c), which is an indicator of long-term hyperglycemia in diabetes mellitus.

Borax alone does not have a high affinity for &quot;hardness cations&quot;, although it has been used for water-softening. Its chemical equation for &quot;water-softening&quot; is given below:
:

The sodium ions introduced do not make water &quot;hard&quot;. This method is suitable for removing both temporary and permanent types of hardness.

A mixture of borax and ammonium chloride is used as a flux when welding iron and steel. It lowers the melting point of the unwanted iron oxide (scale), allowing it to run off. Borax is also mixed with water as a flux when soldering jewelry metals such as gold or silver, where it allows the molten solder to wet the metal and flow evenly into the joint. Borax is also a good flux for &quot;pre-tinning&quot; tungsten with zinc, making the tungsten soft-solderable. Borax is often used as a flux for forge welding.

In artisanal gold mining, borax is sometimes used as part of a process known as the borax method (as a flux) meant to eliminate the need for toxic mercury in the gold extraction process, although it cannot directly replace mercury. Borax was reportedly used by gold miners in parts of the Philippines in the 1900s. There is evidence that, in addition to reducing the environmental impact, this method achieves better gold recovery for suitable ores and is less expensive. This borax method is used in northern Luzon in the Philippines, but miners have been reluctant to adopt it elsewhere for reasons that are not well understood. The method has also been promoted in Bolivia and Tanzania.

A rubbery polymer sometimes called Slime, Flubber, &#x27;gluep&#x27; or &#x27;glurch&#x27; (or erroneously called Silly Putty, which is based on silicone polymers), can be made by cross-linking polyvinyl alcohol with borax. Making flubber from polyvinyl acetate-based glues, such as Elmer&#x27;s Glue, and borax is a common elementary science demonstration.

Borax, given the E number &quot;E285&quot;, is used as a food additive but this use is banned in some countries, such as Australia, China, Thailand and the United States. As a consequence, certain foods, such as caviar, produced for sale in the United States contain higher levels of salt to assist preservation. In addition to its use as a preservative, borax imparts a firm, rubbery texture to food. In China, borax ( or ) has been found in foods including wheat and rice noodles named &quot;lamian&quot; (), &quot;shahe fen&quot; (), &quot;char kway teow&quot; (), and &quot;chee cheong fun&quot; () In Indonesia, it is a common, but forbidden, additive to such foods as noodles, bakso (meatballs), and steamed rice. When consumed with boric acid, numerous studies have demonstrated a negative association between borax and various types of cancers. Boric acid and borax are low in toxicity for acute oral exposures, at approximately the same acute toxicity as salt. The average dose for asymptomatic ingestion cases, which accounts for 88% of all ingestions, is around 0.9 grams. However, the range of reported asymptomatic doses is wide, from 0.01 to 88.8 g.

Other uses include:

* Ingredient in enamel glazes
* Component of glass, pottery, and ceramics
* Used as an additive in ceramic slips and glazes to improve fit on wet, greenware, and bisque
* Fire retardant
* Anti-fungal compound for cellulose insulation
* Mothproofing 10% solution for wool
* Pulverized for the prevention of stubborn pests (e.g. German cockroaches) in closets, pipe and cable inlets, wall panelling gaps, and inaccessible locations where ordinary pesticides are undesirable
* Precursor for sodium perborate monohydrate that is used in detergents, as well as for boric acid and other borates
* Tackifier ingredient in casein, starch and dextrin-based adhesives
* Precursor for boric acid, a tackifier ingredient in polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl alcohol-based adhesives
* To make indelible ink for dip pens by dissolving shellac into heated borax
* Curing agent for snake skins
* Curing agent for salmon eggs, for use in sport fishing for salmon
* Swimming pool buffering agent to control pH
* Neutron absorber, are used in nuclear reactors and spent fuel pools to control reactivity and to shut down a nuclear chain reaction
* As a micronutrient fertilizer to correct boron-deficient soils
* Preservative in taxidermy

* In particle physics as an additive to nuclear emulsion, to extend the latent image lifetime of charged particle tracks. The first observation of the pion, which was awarded the 1950 Nobel Prize, used this type of emulsion.

== Toxicity ==
According to one study, borax is not acutely toxic. Its (median lethal dose) score is tested at 2.66 g/kg in rats, meaning that a significant dose of the chemical is needed to cause severe symptoms or death. The lethal dose is not necessarily the same for humans. On pesticide information websites it is listed as a non-lethal compound and of no hazardous concerns. Human studies in three borate exposure rich comparison groups (U.S. Borax mine and production facility workers, Chinese boron workers, Turkish residents living near boron rich regions) produced no indicators of developmental toxicity in blood and semen tests. Highest estimated exposure was 5 mg B/kg/day likely due to eating in contaminated workplaces, more than 100 times the average daily exposure. Borax is absorbed poorly through intact skin, although fatalities have been recorded in persistent treatment of rashes and open wounds with boric acid-containing ointments and bath solutions. Borax is readily absorbed orally, well above 90%, and mostly excreted through the urine. Fatal cases attributed to ingestion include small children mistakenly drinking pesticides or suicide attempts with large volumes of crystals. No genotoxicity or carcinogenicity has been recorded in studies. 

Borax has been in use as an insecticide in the United States with various restrictions since 1946. All restrictions were removed in February 1986 due to the low toxicity of borax, as reported in two EPA documents relating to boric acid and borax.

Although it cited inconclusive data, a re-evaluation in 2006 by the EPA still found that &quot;There were no signs of toxicity observed during the study and no evidence of cytotoxicity to the target organ.&quot; In the reevaluation, a study of toxicity due to overexposure was checked and the findings were that &quot;The residential handler inhalation risks due to boric acid and its sodium salts as active ingredients are not a risk concern and do not exceed the level of concern...&quot; but that there could be some risk of irritation to children inhaling it if used as a powder for cleaning rugs.

Overexposure to borax dust can cause respiratory irritation, while no skin irritation is known to exist due to external borax exposure. Ingestion may cause gastrointestinal distress including nausea, persistent vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Effects on the vascular system and human brain include headaches and lethargy but are less frequent. In severe cases, a &quot;beefy&quot; red rash affecting the palms, soles, buttocks and scrotum has occurred.

The Indonesian Directorate of Consumer Protection warns of the risk of liver cancer with high consumption of borax over a period of 5–10 years.

Borax was added to the Substance of Very High Concern (SVHC) candidate list on December 16, 2010. The SVHC candidate list is part of the EU Regulations on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals 2006 (REACH), and the addition was based on the revised classification of borax as &quot;toxic for reproduction&quot; category 1B under the CLP Regulations. Substances and mixtures imported into the EU which contain borax are now required to be labelled with the warnings &quot;May damage fertility&quot; and &quot;May damage the unborn child&quot;. It was proposed for addition to REACH Annex XIV by the ECHA on July 1, 2015. If this recommendation is approved, all imports and uses of borax in the EU will have to be authorized by the ECHA.

A review of the boron toxicity (as boric acid and borates) published in 2012 in the &quot;Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health&quot; concluded: &quot;It clearly appears that human B [boron] exposures, even in the highest exposed cohorts, are too low to reach the blood (and target tissue) concentrations that would be required to exert adverse effects on reproductive functions.&quot; A draft risk assessment released by Health Canada in July 2016 has found that overexposure to boric acid has the potential to cause developmental and reproductive health effects. Since people are already exposed to boric acid naturally through their diets and water, Health Canada advised that exposure from other sources should be reduced as much as possible, especially for children and pregnant women.

The concern is not with any one product, but rather multiple exposures from a variety of sources. With this in mind, the department also announced that certain pesticides that contain boric acid, which are commonly used in homes, will have their registrations cancelled and be phased out of the marketplace. As well, new, more protective label directions are being introduced for other boric acid pesticides that continue to be registered in Canada (for example, enclosed bait stations and spot treatments using gel formulations).

<text>The Electric Company is an American educational children&#x27;s television series produced by the Children&#x27;s Television Workshop (CTW, now known as Sesame Workshop). It was co-created by Paul Dooley, Joan Ganz Cooney, and Lloyd Morrisett. The series aired on PBS for 780 episodes over the course of its six seasons from October 25, 1971, to April 15, 1977. The program continued in reruns until October 4, 1985. &quot;The Electric Company&quot; later reran on Noggin, a channel co-founded by the CTW, from 1999 to 2003. Noggin also produced a compilation special for the show.

The Workshop produced the show at Reeves Teletape Studios in Manhattan. &quot;The Electric Company&quot; employed sketch comedy and various other devices to provide an entertaining program to help elementary school children develop their grammar and reading skills. Since it was intended for children who had graduated from CTW&#x27;s flagship program, &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, the humor was more mature than what was seen there.

The show was directed by Robert Schwarz (1971 and 1977), Henry Behar (1972–1975), and John Tracy (1975–1976), and written by Dooley, Christopher Cerf (1971–1973), Jeremy Stevens (1972–1974) and John Boni/Amy Ephron (1972–1973).

In many areas, a preview special, &quot;Here Comes The Electric Company&quot;, was seen in syndication through sponsor Johnson Wax on many local commercial stations during the week before its 1971 debut.

==Performers==
The original cast included Morgan Freeman, Rita Moreno, Bill Cosby, Judy Graubart, Lee Chamberlin and Skip Hinnant. Most of the cast had done stage, repertory, and improvisational work, with Cosby and Moreno already well-established performers on film and television. Ken Roberts (1971–1973), best known as a soap opera announcer (&quot;Love of Life&quot;; &quot;The Secret Storm&quot;), was the narrator of some segments during season one, most notably the parody of the genre that had given him prominence, &quot;Love of Chair&quot;.

Jim Boyd, who was strictly an off-camera voice actor and puppeteer during the first season, began appearing on-camera in the second season, mostly in the role of J. Arthur Crank. Luis Ávalos also joined the cast at that time.

Cosby was a regular in season one, and occasionally appeared in new segments during season two, but left afterward. Segments that Cosby had taped for the first two seasons were repeatedly used for the remainder of the series run. Similarly, Chamberlin was a regular for the first two seasons, and her segments were also repeatedly used throughout the show’s run. As a result, they were billed as cast members throughout the whole series run.

Added to the cast at the beginning of season three (1973–1974) was Hattie Winston, actress and singer who later appeared on the sitcom &quot;Becker.&quot; Beginning in season four (1974–1975), Danny Seagren, a puppeteer who had worked on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; and also as a professional dancer, appeared in the role of Spider-Man; Marvel Comics published &quot;Spidey Super Stories&quot; that tied into Seagren&#x27;s appearances as Spider-Man in character, who never spoke aloud or unmasked himself.

==Selected sketches==
* &quot;The Adventures of Letterman&quot;: Premiering during season two, &quot;Letterman&quot; featured the work of animators John and Faith Hubley, written by author Mike Thaler. The title character (a flying superhero in a varsity sweater and a football helmet) repeatedly foiled the Spell Binder, an evil magician who made mischief by changing words into new words. (In the &quot;origin of Letterman&quot; segment, &quot;In The Beginning,&quot; the Spell Binder was given this motive: &quot;He HATES words, and he hates people who USE them!&quot;) It featured the voices of Zero Mostel, Joan Rivers, who narrated the segments, and Gene Wilder. In his book &quot;The TV Arab&quot;, Jack Shaheen criticized the portrayal of the evil Spell Binder as a negative racial stereotype; he found this disappointing, as PBS shows such as &quot;Sesame Street&quot; gained a reputation for appropriate portrayals of ethnicities.
* &quot;Five Seconds&quot;: Halfway through the show, viewers were challenged to read a word within a five- or ten-second time limit. In seasons three and four (1973 to 1975), in a send-up of &quot;&quot;, the word would self-destruct in a Scanimate animation sequence after the time expired. In seasons five and six (1975 to 1977), the viewers had to read the word before a cast member (or a group of children) did.
* &quot;Giggles, Goggles&quot;: Two friends (usually Rita Moreno and Judy Graubart) conversed while riding a tandem bicycle or performing some other activity together. One would humorously misuse a word and the other would correct her, with the process being repeated several times until they returned to the original word.
* &quot;Here&#x27;s Cooking at You&quot;: A send-up of Julia Child&#x27;s cooking shows, with Judy Graubart playing Julia Grown-Up.
* &quot;Jennifer of the Jungle&quot;: A Borscht Belt-style parody of &quot;George of the Jungle&quot; (which itself was a send-up of &quot;Tarzan)&quot;, with Judy Graubart as Jennifer and Jim Boyd as Paul the Gorilla.
* &quot;The Last Word&quot;: Shown at the end of season one (1971 to 1972), a dimly lit incandescent bulb with a pull-chain switch was shown hanging; the voice of Ken Roberts would gravely state, &quot;And now, the last word.&quot; A single word would appear, usually one that had been featured earlier in the episode. An unseen cast member would read the word aloud, reach his/her arm into the shot, and turn the light off by tugging the pull chain.
* &quot;Love of Chair&quot;: A send-up of &quot;Love of Life&quot; in which Ken Roberts, who was also the announcer for &quot;Life&quot;, would read a &quot;Dick and Jane&quot;–style story about a boy (Skip Hinnant) sitting on a chair and doing simple things, concluding by asking questions in a dramatic tone (the announcer&#x27;s final, portentous question was always ”And...what about Naomi?“) followed by &quot;For the answer to these and other questions, tune in tomorrow for...&#x27;Love of Chair&#x27;.&quot; &quot;Naomi&quot; was an in-joke reference to Naomi Foner, a producer on the show during its first two seasons; Foner went on to become an Academy Award-nominated screenwriter (&quot;Running on Empty&quot;) and the mother of Maggie Gyllenhaal and Jake Gyllenhaal. 
* &quot;Mad Scientist&quot;: Monster parody with an evil scientist (Morgan Freeman) and his Peter Lorre-esque assistant Igor (Luis Ávalos), who tried to read words associated with their experiments.
* &quot;Monolith&quot;: Animated short, set in outer space and used to introduce segments involving a phonic. A large, rectangular pillar of rock (as seen in &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, but depicted white instead of the film&#x27;s black depiction to avoid plagiarism concerns from MGM Studios, the rights holder at the time), was shown disturbed by aliens or astronauts, then shuddering and collapsing during a music bed of the entire opening fanfare of Richard Strauss&#x27; &quot;Also Sprach Zarathustra&quot;. The letters of the phonic would appear from the clearing dust, and a bass voice would pronounce it. Similar segments for &quot;Me&quot; and &quot;Amor&quot; were featured on Sesame Street. The &quot;Monolith&quot; segments were almost entirely animated and directed by Fred Calvert and produced at Fred Calvert Productions.
* &quot;Pedro&#x27;s Plant Place&quot;: Featured Luis Ávalos as a garden-shop proprietor who incorporated words into his planting tips, accompanied by the plant-language-speaking guard plant Maurice (Jim Boyd).
* &quot;Phyllis and the Pharaohs&quot;: A 1950s-style doo-wop group, with Rita Moreno singing lead and the male adult cast on backup.
* &quot;Road Runner&quot;: New cartoons featuring the Looney Tunes character and his pursuer, Wile E. Coyote, produced and directed by Chuck Jones, which reinforced reading skills with words on signs encountered by the characters; used occasional sound and verbal effects.
* &quot;Sign Sing-Along&quot;: Often the last sketch on a Friday, these films featured signs with words accompanied by a sing-along song. They were sung once through; viewers supplied the lyrics the second time, while a trumpet-and-bassoon duo played the melody.
* &quot;The Six-Dollar and Thirty-Nine-Cent Man&quot;: A parody of &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; in seasons five and six, with Jim Boyd as Steve Awesome, Luis Ávalos as Awesome&#x27;s boss Oscar and Hattie Winston as the General; the other adult cast members played villains.
* &quot;Slow Reader&quot;: Animated or live-action shorts in which a slow reader was given a message to read by a delivery man. Each message had advice that he needed to follow, but because of his inability to sound out the words, he often wound up in trouble.
* &quot;Soft-Shoe Silhouettes&quot;: Two people in silhouette, one making the initial sound of a word and the other the rest of the word; the two then said the word in unison. The soft-shoe music itself was composed by Joe Raposo, one of the Children&#x27;s Television Workshop in-house composers at the time.
* &quot;Spidey Super Stories&quot;: Short pieces debuting during season four and featuring Spider-Man (played by Danny Seagren from 1974 to 1977) foiling petty criminals. Spidey was never seen out of costume as his alter ego, Peter Parker, and he spoke in speech balloons for the audience to read. A spin-off comic book, &quot;Spidey Super-Stories&quot;, was produced by Marvel Comics from 1974 to 1981.
* &quot;Vaudeville Revue&quot;: Skits and songs presented in variety-show style on stage, with music fanfare and canned applause; also called the Stage.
* &quot;A Very Short Book&quot;: Sometimes the last sketch of the episode. A cast member read a nursery rhyme or story, turning the pages of a book that showed both the sentences and film footage of the action. The stories usually had a humorous ending that was different from the original.
* &quot;Vi&#x27;s Diner&quot;: Lee Chamberlin played the proprietor of a diner where customers read simple menus to place their orders.
* &quot;Wild Guess&quot;: A game-show send-up (similar to &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot;) with announcer Ken Kane (Bill Cosby in season 1, Morgan Freeman in seasons 2–6) and host Bess West (Rita Moreno), in which the contestant would guess the day&#x27;s secret word. When the word was not guessed, West would give three clues as to what the word was.

==Selected recurring characters==
* The Blond-Haired Cartoon Man (Mel Brooks): a character who would read words appearing on screen. However, they often showed up in the wrong order or made no sense. Thus, the character would resort to correcting the words.
* The Blue Beetle (Jim Boyd): a bungling superhero who often made matters worse instead of better when he tried to help; he often challenged Spider-Man.
* Clayton: a claymation character, animated by Will Vinton, who commented on the previous skit or introduced a new concept.
* The Corsican Twins (Skip Hinnant and Jim Boyd): twin swashbuckler brothers who taught phonics. Whenever either brother hurt himself, the other one felt the pain and reacted accordingly.
* Dr. Doolots (Luis Ávalos): a parody of Doctor Dolittle and Groucho Marx who used words to cure his patients.
* Easy Reader (Morgan Freeman): a smooth hipster who loves reading and is associated with Valerie the Librarian (Hattie Winston) and Vi (Lee Chamberlin) in her diner. The character&#x27;s name was a pun on the movie &quot;Easy Rider&quot;.
* Fargo North, Decoder (Skip Hinnant): an Inspector Clouseau-type detective who decoded scrambled word messages and phrases for clients. His name was a pun based on Fargo, North Dakota.
* J. Arthur Crank (Jim Boyd): a plaid-wearing grouchy character, who interrupted sketches to complain when spellings or pronunciations confused him.
* Lorelei the Chicken (Jim Boyd): an animated chicken who appeared in live-action scenes. She was a caricature of actress Carol Channing.
* Mel Mounds (Morgan Freeman): a disc jockey who introduced songs, usually by the Short Circus.
* The Monsters: Werewolf (Jim Boyd), Frankenstein (Skip Hinnant), and Dracula (Morgan Freeman).
* Millie the Helper (Rita Moreno): an eager-beaver trainee working at various jobs. She was the first to shout, &quot;Hey, you GUYS!&quot;—a phrase that was eventually incorporated into the opening credits. The character&#x27;s name is likely a reference to a character on &quot;The Dick van Dyke Show&quot;.
* Otto the Director (Rita Moreno): a short-tempered film director, a take off of Otto Preminger who tried in vain to get her actors to say their lines correctly, with the help of a cue card to highlight the word they kept missing.
* Pandora the Brat (Rita Moreno): Bratty-but-lovable blonde girl who tried to outwit the adults around her.
* Paul the Gorilla (Jim Boyd): the sidekick of Jennifer of the Jungle; named after head writer Paul Dooley.
* Vincent the Vegetable Vampire (Morgan Freeman): a send-up of Dracula who was obsessed with eating vegetables.

The adult cast also had recurring roles as Spider-Man (Danny Seagren) (seasons 4–6 (1974–1977)), J.J. (Skip Hinnant), Carmela (Rita Moreno), Brenda (Lee Chamberlin) (seasons 1–2 (1971–1973)), Mark (Morgan Freeman), Hank (Bill Cosby) (seasons 1–2 (1971–1973)), Roberto (Luis Ávalos) (seasons 2–6 (1972–1977)), Winnie (Judy Graubart), Andy (Jim Boyd), and Sylvia (Hattie Winston) (seasons 3–6 (1973–1977)).

==Short Circus==
Another regular part of the show was the Short Circus (a pun on &quot;short circuit&quot;), a five-member singing band whose songs also facilitated reading comprehension. June Angela was the only Short Circus member to remain with the show during its entire six-year run. Others lasted anywhere from one to four years. Irene Cara appeared during the first season (1971–1972) and would go on to become a pop-music star. Cara was replaced in the second season (1972–1973) by Denise Nickerson, who previously appeared on the ABC daytime series &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; and was best known for her appearance as Violet Beauregarde in the 1971 film &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot;.

The other three original members of the Short Circus were singer and guitarist Melanie Henderson; drummer and singer Stephen Gustafson; and singer, tambourinist, and guitarist Douglas Grant. For seasons three (1973–1974) and four (1974–1975), Grant and Nickerson were replaced by tap dancer Gregg Burge and Broadway actress Bayn Johnson.

Except for June Angela, an entirely new Short Circus was cast for the show’s fifth and sixth season (1975–1977). The new hires were Todd Graff, singer Rodney Lewis, Réjane Magloire, and singer Janina Matthews.

In the first season (1971–1972), a number of unbilled children were also used on-camera with the show&#x27;s cast, as on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, but this concept was quickly dropped.

Because of the frequent reuse of segments, a practice derived from &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, actors continued to appear after their departures from the cast.

==Guest appearances==
&quot;The Electric Company&quot; also featured celebrity guest appearances, including the following:

==Music==
With the exception of Tom Lehrer, all the individuals listed below were Children&#x27;s Television Workshop in-house composers.

* Joe Raposo, who was famous for his work on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, was the music director of the series for Seasons 1–3 and wrote songs for the show during its entire run.
* Gary William Friedman, who wrote the music for the hit Broadway rock opera &quot;The Me Nobody Knows&quot;, was the music director and composer for Season 4, composer for an additional 260 episodes, and wrote some 40 songs, including the popular Spider-Man theme song.
* Tom Lehrer, a satirist and pianist, wrote 10 songs for the series. Two of those songs, &quot;L-Y&quot; and &quot;Silent E&quot; (whose visual segment was directed by Clark Gist and animated by Tony Benedict), were included as bonus tracks on the CD issue of his second live album, while the boxed set &quot;The Remains of Tom Lehrer&quot; included five songs from the show, with the original recordings of &quot;L-Y&quot;, &quot;Silent E&quot;, &quot;O-U (The Hound Song)&quot;, and &quot;S-N (Snore, Sniff, and Sneeze)&quot;, along with a new recording of &quot;N Apostrophe T&quot;.
* Dave Conner was the music director for Seasons 5–6.
* Clark Gesner wrote several songs for the series, including most of the sign songs but never served as the show&#x27;s official music coordinator, a position that fell to Raposo&#x27;s ensemble percussionist Danny Epstein.
* Eric Rogers, who composed the music for the DePatie-Freleng cartoons in the &#x27;70s. He was the additional music composer for 260 episodes of &quot;The Electric Company&quot;, and wrote some new songs, including the arrangement from &quot;The Electric Company&quot; theme song.

The original soundtrack album, released on Warner Bros. Records, won a Grammy Award for the show&#x27;s cast.

==Visuals==
The series was notable for its extensive, innovative use of early computer-generated imagery, especially Scanimate, a then-state-of-the-art analog video-synthesizer system. They were often used for presenting words with particular sounds. Sometimes a cast member would be seen alongside or interacting in another way with a word animation.

==Show numbering==
Comedian, actor and writer Paul Dooley created the series and served as head writer. A total of 780 episodes were produced in the show&#x27;s six-season run, 130 per season. As with &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, each episode of &quot;The Electric Company&quot; was numbered on-screen instead of using traditional episode titles. Seasons One through Four were numbered 1–520 (1971–1975). Season five was numbered 1A–130A (1975–1976), while season six was numbered 1B–130B (1976–1977). The last two seasons were designated as such because they were designed as year-long curricula for schools.

Starting with season three, a show&#x27;s number would be presented in the sketch-of-the-day teaser segment, a parody of soap-opera teasers, which would highlight a particular sketch that would be shown during that episode. The voice of a cast member would say a variant of, &quot;Today on &quot;The Electric Company&quot;, the so-and so says, &#x27;(bleep)&#x27;,&quot; and the action would freeze as the graphic of the word of the day (or a card with the word of the day printed on it) became visible to viewers. The redacted words were replaced by a series of Minimoog sounds that roughly mimicked the modulation of the word or phrase in question so children could guess them. The still action would linger on the screen for several seconds, then fade to black, where the show number would become visible in a Scanimate animation in a random color. The music for this segment was a repetitive, funky instrumental groove featuring a call-and-response between horns and a scratchy wah-wah electric guitar.

The next-show teaser, which was introduced in season two without music, worked in the same way, and usually used a different take of the music heard during the sketch-of-the-day teaser, except that the voice said &quot;Tune in next time, when...,&quot; and there was no show number shown.

In season one, however, after the title sequence, the sound of a striking match would be heard, and a fade-up from black would reveal a hand holding a lit match and &quot;Show #&quot;x&quot;&quot; handwritten on a piece of paper that was placed in such a way so that it could blend with the surrounding objects in-frame. Instead of the next-show teaser, Ken Roberts&#x27;s voice could be heard, saying, &quot;And now, the last word,&quot; and the trademark light bulb would be shut off by a hand doing whatever the last word was. In season two, after the opening sequence the words &quot;The Electric Company&quot; would disappear from the logo, and the show number would appear in its place through the use of a Scanimate animation and an electronic whooshing sound.

Notably, some episodes in seasons three through five had serious technical errors with either their sketch-of-the-day teaser segments or their next-show teaser segments, which was probably because of the failure of the linear analog video-editing equipment. Episodes that have these errors in their sketch-of-the-day teasers include 297, 390, 1A, 8A, and 15A—sometimes the music started too late, ended too early, or played too long; sometimes the errors are negligible, with the teaser music only playing a fraction of a second longer than usual.

For season six, because the teaser music was changed to a shorter, self-contained composition, these errors do not occur, with the exception of the teaser of 33B shown at the end of 32B (available on iTunes), where the teaser was accidentally &quot;cut&quot; by a fraction of a second.

==Cancellation==
&quot;The Electric Company&quot; was canceled in 1977 at the height of its popularity. Unlike its counterpart &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, which licensed its Muppet characters for merchandising, &quot;The Electric Company&quot; never had a stand-alone brand or character that could have helped to generate additional profits. The only significant items the show licensed were comic books and a Milton Bradley board game of the Fargo North, Decoder character. Licensing rights were also granted to Mattel Electronics for two educational-based video games for the Intellivision console in 1979. These games featured both the show&#x27;s title logo on the game&#x27;s packaging and label and the first several notes of the theme song played on the title screen of the games.

Also, the PBS stations and statewide networks that aired the show often complained of the Children&#x27;s Television Workshop &quot;soaking up so much money in public television&quot;, said veteran television producer Samuel Gibbon, who worked on the show. &quot;The stations demanded that one of the programs—either &quot;Sesame Street&quot; or &quot;The Electric Company&quot;—be put into reruns to save money. By that time, &quot;Sesame Street&quot; was a cash fountain for the Workshop. The show was almost supporting itself by then with all the productions, books, records, and games. There was no way, it was felt, that they could reduce the number of original shows of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. But the thought was that if we produce two final seasons of &quot;The Electric Company&quot; that were designed to be repeated, that would give the show four more years of life.&quot; Most PBS programs at the time were produced entirely by local stations, instead of being the work of independent producers like CTW. The final episode of &quot;The Electric Company&quot; featured a short musical and dance number featuring the final cast members (with the exception of Bill Cosby, Lee Chamberlin, both of whom had long since left the show and Rita Moreno, who did not take part in this episode) including the then-current members of the Short Circus. The lyrics of the song summed up the closure of the series:

After the last original episode on April 15, 1977, &quot;The Electric Company&quot; continued on PBS in reruns until early October 1985.

==Revivals==
===1999 rebroadcast===
The earlier shows did not resurface until February 2, 1999, when the Noggin network, which was partly owned by Sesame Workshop and PBS at the time, rebroadcast the show as a result of its co-ownership of the network. Noggin created a two-hour compilation special to re-introduce the series to a new generation. The special was aired on TV Land as a way to promote Noggin.

Noggin ran 65 select episodes until mid-2003, when they were pulled from the program lineup because Sesame Workshop sold its half of the network to Viacom, which already owned the other half. The shows were cut subtly to fit Noggin&#x27;s shorter running time and free up time for various interstitial segments produced for the network. These deletions included the episode numbers, the Scanimate word animations, the segments of up to 15 seconds, and the teasers of the next episodes (in seasons 2–6).

During the same period as the Noggin rebroadcasts, numerous fans of the program produced QuickTime and MP3 clips from the Noggin rebroadcasts, old over-the-air recordings, and, in some cases, from master recordings. These were hosted online at various places and received heavy attention from the blogosphere (e.g., Boing Boing) until a cease-and-desist letter took down the most prominent of these sites in 2004.

===DVD releases===
The series was not seen since it was pulled from Noggin&#x27;s schedule until Sesame Workshop, under license to Shout! Factory, released a DVD boxed set on February 7, 2006, called &quot;The Best of the Electric Company&quot; that included 20 uncut episodes from throughout the show&#x27;s run, including the first and last episodes, plus outtakes and introductions and commentary by Rita Moreno and June Angela.

Due to the overwhelming—and somewhat unexpected—popularity of the initial DVD release, a second boxed set was released on November 14, 2006 (&quot;The Best of the Electric Company: Volume 2&quot;). This second volume contained 20 episodes from seasons one through five plus a 30-minute documentary on the effects of in-school viewings of &quot;The Electric Company&quot; from 1975. Cast members Luis Ávalos, Jim Boyd, Judy Graubart, Skip Hinnant, and Hattie Winston provided commentary and reflected on their years on the show. However, the original content of nine episodes presented in this set were altered. In some cases, material that was originally broadcast in a particular episode was removed completely while material from other episodes was included. For example, 60A originally contained the Spider-Man episode &quot;Spidey Meets the Prankster&quot; and used a scene from that sketch as the opening teaser, which was removed completely (due to Marvel Entertainment licensing) after the opening credits, leaving only the episode number. Also removed following the &quot;Letterman&quot; sketch in this episode was the clip of the Short Circus singing &quot;Stop!&quot; and a Road Runner–Wile E. Coyote cartoon (due to Warner Bros. licensing). These altered episodes also contain special effects used to segue from one sketch to another that were not used in the show&#x27;s original run. The other altered episodes are 197, 227, 322, 375, 35A, 57A, 77A, and 105A.

It is believed that these changes were probably made to avoid repeats of segments that were on the first DVD set, but it is more likely that it was due to ownership rights—the segments that were used to cover up the material not under Sesame Workshop&#x27;s control (Spider-Man, Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote, etc.) were longer than the excised segments, so the episodes were cut further to get them down to their required 28-minute length.

An hour-long television show called &quot;The Electric Company&#x27;s Greatest Hits &amp; Bits&quot; was broadcast on many PBS stations in late 2006. It included interviews with cast members, voice talent, and creator-producer Joan Ganz Cooney. The special was produced by Authorized Pictures and distributed by American Public Television, and was designed to be seen during pledge drives. It was released on DVD on March 6, 2007.

===iTunes===
In early 2007, Apple Inc., through its iTunes service, started selling 15 previously unavailable episodes of &quot;The Electric Company.&quot; &quot;Volume 1&quot; contained Episodes 5, 13, 23, 128, 179, 249, 261, 289, 297, 374, 416, 475, 91A, 8B, and 32B.

In late 2007, another collection of 15 episodes dubbed &quot;Volume 2&quot; became available from iTunes. The new additions were Episodes 2, 36, 40, 75, 142, 154, 165, 172, 189, 218, 245, 290, 337, and 350. Repeated from &quot;Volume 1&quot; was Episode 8B, erroneously labeled as 658, even though it &quot;is&quot; correct if the A–B designations were disregarded (1A–130A are 521–650, 1B–130B are 651–780).

It is unclear if these episodes were altered from the versions originally shown on television. Shout! Factory representatives indicated that it had no plans for another DVD set, implying that episodes distributed via iTunes would not be available in another format.

==International broadcasts==

In Australia, &quot;The Electric Company&quot; aired on ABC in the mid-1970s and in 1979–80 on the Ten Network. It aired on SBS in 1984–89.

<doc id="65563" wikidata="Q54488" url="?curid=65563" title="Darling Harbour">
<text>Darling Harbour is a harbour and neighborhood adjacent to the city centre of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, that is made up of a large recreational and pedestrian precinct that is situated on western outskirts of the Sydney central business district.

Originally named Long Cove, the locality extends northwards from Chinatown, along both sides of Cockle Bay to King Street Wharf on the east, and to the suburb of Pyrmont on the west. Cockle Bay is just one of the waterways that makes up Darling Harbour, which opens north into the much larger Port Jackson.

The precinct and its immediate surroundings are administered independently of the local government area of the City of Sydney, by Property NSW.

==History==

The original name of the land now known as Darling Harbour is Tambalong, in Dharag language.

Darling Harbour is named after Lieutenant-General Ralph Darling, who was Governor of New South Wales from 1825 to 1831. The area was originally known as Long Cove, but was generally referred to as Cockle Bay until 1826 when Governor Darling renamed it after himself. The name Cockle Bay has recently been restored in reference to the headwaters of the harbour. It was originally part of the commercial port of Sydney, including the Darling Harbour Railway Goods Yard. During the Great Depression, the eastern part of Darling Harbour (&quot;Barangaroo&quot;) became known as The Hungry Mile, a reference to the waterside workers searching for jobs along the wharves.
Much of the land had been the site of the NSW Railways central marshalling yards and freight consolidation centre. The Enquiry into the NSW industry, including rail/road competition (1978–80), under Commissioner Gavan McDonell, found that this centre was inefficient, should be moved, and the land used for other public purposes. These recommendations were acted upon and by the mid-to-late 1980s, when the area had become largely derelict it was redeveloped as a pedestrian and tourist precinct as an initiative of then New South Wales Minister for Public Works, Laurie Brereton. The Sydney Convention &amp; Exhibition Centre at Darling Harbour was a venue of the 2000 Summer Olympic Games and a key meeting venue of APEC Australia 2007.


On 26 January 1994, Charles III then Prince of Wales, was giving a speech during the Australia Day celebrations. David Kang ran at the Prince whilst firing two blanks before falling onto the ground and being promptly held and arrested. The Prince was unhurt and was ushered off the podium.

Diana, Princess of Wales toured Darling Harbour on 1 November 1996 during her short tour of Sydney in a series of fundraising events.

== Heritage listings ==
Darling Harbour has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Harbour Promenade: Darling Harbour Woodward Water Feature

==Transport==

Darling Harbour is accessible via various modes of public transport. The precinct is served by the Inner West Light Rail of Sydney&#x27;s light rail network, with access via Paddy&#x27;s Markets, Convention, Exhibition and Pyrmont Bay stations. Ferry wharves including Barangaroo and Pyrmont Bay provide access to the Pyrmont Bay ferry services to Circular Quay and other suburbs while the Barangaroo wharf also provides access to the Parramatta River ferry services. King Street Wharf is accessible by private boat charters. The Goods Line is a park and pedestrian pathway connecting Darling Harbour to Railway Square and Central station. The nearest train station is Town Hall.

===Proposed Metro station===
Darling Harbour will be served by Pyrmont as a future rapid transit station that will be built as part of the Sydney Metro West project.

==Redevelopment==


East Darling Harbour has been part of a large urban renewal development. Plans for the site include half business and residential developments, while the other half to be reserved for open public space. The state government of NSW declared plans for &quot;Globe Street&quot;, a street designed to become Australia&#x27;s and Asia Pacific&#x27;s centre for corporate trade (styled on New York&#x27;s Wall Street district). The urban renewal development was expected to be completed by 2020. East Darling Harbour is now known as a part of the Barangaroo precinct.

At the south end of Cockle Bay, the Sydney Convention &amp; Exhibition Centre site was replaced by the new International Convention Centre Sydney (ICC Sydney), opened in December 2016. The new site includes a exhibition facility. Other new facilities within the Darling Harbour region include the recently opened ICC Theatre, an 8,000 seat mixed purpose venue for concerts and intimate shows, replacing the Sydney Entertainment Centre, a gallery, and an upcoming new 25 story multi purpose venue called The Ribbon which will be replacing the IMAX Theatre which was closed and demolished in late 2016, which was reopened on 11 October 2023 with a new, updated theatre.

This area was the site of the Sydney Port Authority and featured an Overseas Passenger Terminal (Wharf 8) which was mainly used by the &quot;Pacific Dawn&quot; of the P&amp;O Cruises Australia fleet and the &quot;Sun Princess&quot;, operated by Princess Cruises. The passenger terminal is now in White Bay and the container terminal has since closed.

On the west side of Cockle Bay, the Harbourside Shopping Centre, built in 1988, was demolished in 2023, and a new Harbourside Residences project is under construction in 2024/2025.

==In popular culture==

Darling Harbour is the location of the season residence on MTV&#x27;s reality TV show, &quot;The Real World: Sydney&quot;, which aired in late 2007. The house has a large &quot;Darling Harbour&quot; sign along its edge, and the World Tower high rise building can be seen behind it.
20th Century Fox&#x27;s 1995 film &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie&quot; was shot in Sydney, and featured some scenes filmed in Darling Harbour.

Seven&#x27;s Saturday morning TV Music Show &quot;Eclipse Music TV&quot; is filmed weekly at the precinct&#x27;s shopping centre, Harbourside.

On 27 August 2010, the soap opera &quot;Neighbours&quot; filmed scenes in the harbour and on board the cruise ship, Pacific Jewel.

Canadian post-hardcore band Silverstein recorded a song entitled &quot;Darling Harbour&quot; on their Transitions EP.

<text>Progressive metal (often shortened to prog metal) is a broad fusion music genre melding heavy metal and progressive rock, combining the loud &quot;aggression&quot; and amplified guitar-driven sound of the former with the more experimental, cerebral or quasi-classical compositions of the latter.

The music typically showcases the extreme technical proficiency of the performers and usually uses unorthodox harmonies as well as complex rhythms with frequent meter changes and intense syncopation. The rhythmic aspects are especially emphasized in the djent subgenre. 
Although the genre emerged towards the late-1980s, it was not until the 1990s that progressive metal achieved widespread success. Watchtower, Queensrÿche, Dream Theater, Tool, Symphony X, Shadow Gallery, King&#x27;s X, and Fates Warning are a few examples of progressive metal bands who achieved commercial success.

==History==
Progressive metal, as a distinct musical style, was primarily advanced by members of the American heavy metal scene of the mid-1980s, particularly Queensrÿche, Savatage, Fates Warning, Watchtower and then later on, Dream Theater and Symphony X. It has since developed in a non-linear fashion, with countless groups demonstrating innovations in personal ways.

The origins of the genre date back to the very beginning of heavy metal/hard rock and progressive rock when some bands began to merge the two different approaches. 1960s pioneers King Crimson maintained their musical innovation while incorporating a harder approach, using dissonance and experimental tones, yet still maintaining a relationship to the power chords of hard rock, with the main example being &quot;21st Century Schizoid Man&quot;. Canadian trio Rush are widely recognized as bridging the gap between hard rock, English progressive rock, and pure heavy metal. Initially influenced by Led Zeppelin, they evolved to combine established progressive rock technique with blues-based power chords. Records such as &quot;2112&quot; (1976) showcased technical expertise and complex compositional skill while still utilizing a more direct and heavier approach than the well-established English progressive rock sound.

1984 brought full-length debut albums from American bands Queensrÿche from Washington state, and Fates Warning from Connecticut. Both expanded their music to include more progressive elements (&quot;The Warning,&quot; 1984; &quot;The Spectre Within,&quot; 1985) – some through sound experimentation and compositional refinement, others through extremely complex structures and atypical riffs – up to the two seminal works in 1986: &quot;Rage for Order&quot; and &quot;Awaken the Guardian&quot;. In the following years the two bands, while following different paths – more basic and simple the first, more articulate and complex the latter — explore and expand the technical refinement and sonic finesse of their music, continuing to lay the foundations of the genre with important works such as &quot;&quot; (1988) by Queensrÿche, and &quot;Perfect Symmetry&quot; (1989) by Fates Warning.
Progressive metal also found a home in the growing U.S. thrash metal movement, influencing popular heavy metal bands like Megadeth, with its acclaimed album &quot;Rust in Peace&quot; (1990), together with Metallica and its famous album &quot;...And Justice for All&quot; (1988). Among the other pioneering thrash metal bands, one of the most important is Canada&#x27;s Voivod, with their complex and experimental style, full of psychedelic dissonances (&quot;Dimension Hatröss,&quot; 1988; &quot;Nothingface,&quot; 1989). &quot;Math-metal&quot; pioneers Watchtower, from Texas, took the concept of time-changes to a new level, combining thrash metal, syncopation and prog in their albums &quot;Energetic Disassembly&quot; (1985) and &quot;Control and Resistance&quot; (1989), giving rise to an extremely technical approach based on the rhythmic deconstruction typical in jazz fusion. This same direction in prog metal would be later integrated into death metal by bands such as Atheist (&quot;Unquestionable Presence,&quot; 1991), which would become known as technical death metal or progressive death metal. Bands which also explored fusion-inspired prog metal include most notably Death and Cynic.

The major US bands that contribute to further delineating and developing the genre are Psychotic Waltz and Dream Theater. The former, with an approach halfway in between Watchtower and Fates Warning, produced &quot;A Social Grace&quot; (1990), melding their signature sound with the psychedelic &quot;Into the Everflow&quot; (1992), while the latter explored the legacy of the bands that preceded them while advancing their personal style with &quot;When Dream and Day Unite&quot; (1989). Both albums focused on keyboards and band members&#x27; instrumental skills. As for Dream Theater, their efforts resulted in two fundamental albums, which helped institutionalize classic progressive metal — &quot;Images and Words&quot; (1992) and &quot;Awake&quot; (1994).

Among European pioneers of the genre are Germany&#x27;s Sieges Even, who, starting out of technical thrash stylistically significant to Watchtower, explored the more technical and angular side of progressive metal with &quot;The Art of Navigating by the Stars&quot; (2005).Among the bands of the late 1990s who brought innovation to the genre are the Dutch Ayreon (a project by Arjen Anthony Lucassen) and Swedes Pain of Salvation. Ayreon focused on theatrical and melodramatic rock operas &quot;Into the Electric Castle&quot; (1998) and &quot;The Human Equation&quot; (2004), performed by many different members of prominent metal bands. Pain of Salvation was always working towards a more or less unusual style, demonstrated by the eclecticism and anti-conformism found on &quot;One Hour by the Concrete Lake&quot; (1998), and &quot;BE&quot; (2004). Forerunners of a more experimental and alternative approach include Thought Industry, as seen in their album &quot;Mods Carve the Pig: Assassins, Toads and God&#x27;s Flesh&quot; (1993).

Puerto Rican band Puya rose to prominence in the late &#x27;90s with their innovative fusion of jazz, salsa, and progressive metal, evident on their 1999 album &quot;Fundamental&quot;.

Some of the first bands to pioneer the combination of progressive rock and extreme metal influences were Dan Swanö&#x27;s Edge of Sanity, and Opeth, both bands hailing from Sweden. In particular, Edge of Sanity&#x27;s &quot;Crimson&quot; (1996), a 40-minute concept album consisting of a single track, brought the band critical acclaim and was heralded as one of the first extreme-metal forays into a progressive rock-esque concept album, featuring death-metal vocals and heavily distorted guitars, with guest vocals and lead guitar from Opeth&#x27;s Mikael Åkerfeldt. Dan Swanö produced Opeth&#x27;s first release, &quot;Orchid&quot; (1995), which was unique for its combination of death metal vocals and instrumentation, melodic guitar harmonies, and acoustic passages, but it wasn&#x27;t until their hallmark record &quot;Blackwater Park&quot; (2001) that they received critical acclaim. Steven Wilson, progressive rock icon and frontman of Porcupine Tree, was given a copy of Opeth&#x27;s prior record &quot;Still Life&quot; (1999) from a friend, and, after listening, noted that the experimental music he had been after had drifted into extreme metal. Being mutual fans of each other&#x27;s work, Steven ended up co-producing &quot;Blackwater Park&quot; along with Opeth&#x27;s frontman Mikael Åkerfeldt, and would go on to co-produce &quot;Deliverance&quot; (2002) and &quot;Damnation&quot; (2003), together a would-be double album. Their next release, Ghost Reveries, became an &quot;instant classic,&quot; followed by Watershed, their last &quot;heavy&quot; album, both of which have had significant influence on the progressive metal genre, along with other &quot;extreme metal&quot; bands like Meshuggah. This style of progressive metal is often referred to as &quot;extreme progressive metal,&quot; or &quot;extreme prog,&quot; for short. Later bands who would play in this style are Ne Obliviscaris, Disillusion. Porcupine Tree would later be influenced by this style, and in particular from Opeth, while Opeth would subsequently switch to a more traditional progressive metal/rock band, devoid of extreme metal elements.

Between the Buried and Me, who started as a more straightforward metalcore band, also began to incorporate both progressive metal and death metal into their music on their 2003 album &quot;The Silent Circus&quot;, a landmark album in the progressive metalcore genre. They would later add avant-garde elements as well on releases such as &quot;The Great Misdirect&quot; (2009).

In the 2010s, due to the rapid growth of djent led by bands such as Periphery and After the Burial, progressive metal saw an increased interest with a large number of newcomers to the genre. Some of the newer progressive metal bands that have gained popularity since the 2010s are Haken, Plini, Vola, and Caligula&#x27;s Horse, among others.

==Stylistic diversity==
One of the hallmark musical qualities of progressive metal is eclecticism. In between the riffs, choruses, and solos typical of rock and metal songs, prog metal bands often include sections inspired by jazz, classical and Middle Eastern music, among others. Progressive metal is difficult to define specifically, since most bands labeled under the genre have considerably different musical influences when compared to each other.

Similarly, bands such as Dream Theater, Planet X and Puya have a jazz influence, with extended solo sections that often feature &quot;trading solos&quot;. 

Orphaned Land from Israel debuted as a melodic death-doom/melodic death metal band that fused middle eastern rhythms and melodies into their music with a progressive edge. The band knew they wanted to create a new subgenre of metal from the very beginning, a style they would dub &quot;oriental metal,&quot; and were always viewed as progressive due to the nature of the middle eastern elements of their music, which is known for using time signatures that are uncommon in the west, expansive song structures, and microtones. As their career developed, they would later play in a more traditional progressive metal style, comparable to Opeth, Symphony X, and the like, while maintaining their &quot;oriental&quot; edge. Steven Wilson, who lived in Israel for some time playing in Blackfield, found Ophaned Land to be &quot;something special&quot; after listening to Mabool and, would end up producing and engineering The Never Ending Way of ORWarriOR.

In the late 2000s, bands such as Periphery, Tesseract, Animals as Leaders and Vildhjarta popularized the &quot;djent&quot; style of progressive metal in a sound originally developed by Meshuggah. It is characterized by high-attack, palm-muted, syncopated riffs (often incorporating polymeters), as well as use of extended-range guitars. Extended-range guitars also feature in other forms of progressive metal; artists including Dream Theater, Devin Townsend, Dir En Grey, and Ne Obliviscaris have used seven-string guitars without being part of the djent movement, Dream Theater having been one of the earliest progressive metal bands to incorporate seven-stringed guitars into their music.

Proyecto Eskhata, a Spanish band, has received much press coverage in Spain for its fusion of progressive rock and rap metal, which journalists have described as &quot;progressive rap metal&quot;.

Progressive doom is a fusion genre that combines elements of progressive metal and doom metal. Bands include King Goat, Below the Sun, Sierra, and Oceans of Slumber.

<doc id="65567" wikidata="Q570007" url="?curid=65567" title="Japanese aircraft carrier Hiryū">
<text>was an aircraft carrier built for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) during the 1930s. Generally regarded as the only ship of her class, she was built to a modified design. Her aircraft supported the Japanese invasion of French Indochina in mid-1940. She took part in the attack on Pearl Harbor and the Battle of Wake Island. During the first few months of the Pacific War, the ship supported the conquest of the Dutch East Indies in January 1942. The following month, her aircraft bombed Darwin, Australia; and continued to assist in the Dutch East Indies campaign. In April, &quot;Hiryū&quot; aircraft helped sink two British heavy cruisers and several merchant ships during the Indian Ocean Raid.

After a brief refit, &quot;Hiryū&quot; and three other fleet carriers of the First Air Fleet (&quot;Kido Butai&quot;) participated in the Battle of Midway in June 1942. After bombarding American forces on the atoll, the carriers were attacked by aircraft from Midway and the carriers , , and . Dive bombers from &quot;Yorktown&quot; and &quot;Enterprise&quot; crippled &quot;Hiryū&quot; and set her afire. She was scuttled the following day after it became clear that she could not be salvaged. The loss of &quot;Hiryū&quot; and three other IJN carriers at Midway was a crucial strategic defeat for Japan and contributed significantly to the Allies&#x27; ultimate victory in the Pacific.

==Design==
&quot;Hiryū&quot; was one of two large carriers approved for construction under the 1931–1932 Supplementary Program. Originally designed as the sister ship of &quot;Sōryū&quot;, her design was enlarged and modified in light of the &quot;Tomozuru&quot; and Fourth Fleet Incidents in 1934–1935 that revealed many IJN ships were top-heavy, unstable and structurally weak. Her forecastle was raised and her hull strengthened. Other changes involved increasing her beam, displacement, and armor protection.

The ship had a length of overall, a beam of and a draft of . She displaced at standard load and at normal load. Her crew consisted of 1,100 officers and enlisted men.
===Machinery===
&quot;Hiryū&quot; was fitted with four geared steam turbine sets with a total of , each driving one propeller shaft using steam provided by eight Kampon water-tube boilers. The turbines and boilers were the same as those used in the s. The ship&#x27;s power and slim, cruiser-type hull with a length-to-beam ratio of 10:1 gave her a speed of and made her the fastest carrier in the world at the time of her commissioning. &quot;Hiryū&quot; carried of fuel oil which gave her a range of at . The boiler uptakes were trunked to the ship&#x27;s starboard side amidships and exhausted just below flight deck level through two funnels curved downward.

===Flight deck and hangars===
The carrier&#x27;s flight deck was wide and overhung her superstructure at both ends, supported by pairs of pillars. &quot;Hiryū&quot; was one of only two carriers ever built whose island was on the port side of the ship ( was the other). It was also positioned further to the rear and encroached on the width of the flight deck, unlike &quot;Sōryū&quot;. Nine transverse arrestor wires were installed on the flight deck that could stop a aircraft. One group of three wires was positioned further forward to allow the ship to land aircraft over the bow, although this was never done in practice. The flight deck was only above the waterline and the ship&#x27;s designers kept this figure low by reducing the height of the hangars. The upper hangar was and had an approximate height of ; the lower was and had an approximate height of . Together they had an approximate total area of . This caused problems in handling aircraft because the wings of a Nakajima B5N &quot;Kate&quot; torpedo bomber could neither be spread nor folded in the upper hangar.

Aircraft were transported between the hangars and the flight deck by three elevators, the forward one abreast the island on the centerline and the other two offset to starboard. The forward platform measured , the middle one , and the rear . They were capable of transferring aircraft weighing up to . &quot;Hiryū&quot; had a designed aircraft capacity of 64, plus nine spares.

===Armament===
&quot;Hiryū&quot;″s primary anti-aircraft (AA) armament consisted of six twin-gun mounts equipped with 12.7-centimeter Type 89 dual-purpose guns mounted on projecting sponsons, three on either side of the carrier&#x27;s hull. When firing at surface targets, the guns had a range of ; they had a maximum ceiling of at their maximum elevation of +90 degrees. Their maximum rate of fire was 14 rounds a minute, but their sustained rate of fire was approximately eight rounds per minute. The ship was equipped with two Type 94 fire-control directors to control the guns, one for each side of the ship; the starboard-side director was on top of the island and the other director was positioned below flight deck level on the port side.

The ship&#x27;s light AA armament consisted of seven triple and five twin-gun mounts for license-built Hotchkiss 25 mm Type 96 AA guns. Two of the triple mounts were sited on a platform just below the forward end of the flight deck. The gun was the standard Japanese light AA gun during World War II, but it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it largely ineffective. According to historian Mark Stille, the weapon had many faults including an inability to &quot;handle high-speed targets because it could not be trained or elevated fast enough by either hand or power, its sights were inadequate for high-speed targets, it possessed excessive vibration and muzzle blast, and its magazines were too small to maintain high rates of fire&quot;. These guns had an effective range of , and an effective ceiling of at an elevation of +85 degrees. The maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute because of the frequent need to change the fifteen-round magazines. The Type 96 guns were controlled by five Type 95 directors, two on each side and one in the bow.

===Armor===
&quot;Hiryū&quot; had a waterline belt with a maximum thickness of over the magazines that reduced to over the machinery spaces and the avgas storage tanks. It was backed by an internal anti-splinter bulkhead. The ship&#x27;s deck was thick over the machinery spaces and thick over the magazines and avgas storage tanks.

==Construction and service==

Following the Japanese ship-naming conventions for aircraft carriers, &quot;Hiryū&quot; was named &quot;Flying Dragon&quot;. The ship was laid down at the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal on 8 July 1936, launched on 16 November 1937 and commissioned on 5 July 1939. She was assigned to the Second Carrier Division on 15 November. In September 1940, the ship&#x27;s air group was transferred to Hainan Island to support the Japanese invasion of French Indochina. In February 1941, &quot;Hiryū&quot; supported the blockade of Southern China. Two months later, the 2nd Carrier Division, commanded by Rear Admiral Tamon Yamaguchi, was assigned to the First Air Fleet, or &quot;Kido Butai&quot;, on 10 April. &quot;Hiryū&quot; returned to Japan on 7 August and began a short refit that was completed on 15 September. She became flagship of the Second Division from 22 September to 26 October while &quot;Sōryū&quot; was refitting.

===Pearl Harbor and subsequent operations===

In November 1941, the IJN&#x27;s Combined Fleet, commanded by Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, prepared to participate in Japan&#x27;s initiation of a formal war with the United States by conducting a preemptive strike against the United States Navy&#x27;s Pacific Fleet base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. On 22 November, &quot;Hiryū&quot;, commanded by Captain Tomeo Kaku, and the rest of the &quot;Kido Butai&quot;, under Vice Admiral Chūichi Nagumo and including six fleet carriers from the First, Second, and Fifth Carrier Divisions, assembled in Hitokappu Bay at Etorofu Island. The fleet departed Etorofu on 26 November and followed a course across the north-central Pacific to avoid commercial shipping lanes. Now the flagship of the Second Carrier Division, the ship embarked 21 Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters, 18 Aichi D3A &quot;Val&quot; dive bombers, and 18 Nakajima B5N &quot;Kate&quot; torpedo bombers. From a position north of Oahu, &quot;Hiryū&quot; and the other five carriers launched two waves of aircraft on the morning of 7 December 1941 Hawaiian time.

In the first wave, 8 B5N torpedo bombers were supposed to attack the aircraft carriers that normally berthed on the northwest side of Ford Island, but none were in Pearl Harbor that day; 4 of the B5N pilots diverted to their secondary target, ships berthed alongside &quot;1010 Pier&quot; where the fleet flagship was usually . That ship, the battleship , was in drydock and its position was occupied by the light cruiser and the minelayer ; all four torpedoes missed. The other four pilots attacked the battleships and . The remaining 10 B5Ns were tasked to drop armor-piercing bombs on the battleships berthed on the southeast side of Ford Island (&quot;Battleship Row&quot;) and may have scored one or two hits on them, in addition to causing a magazine explosion aboard the battleship that sank her with heavy loss of life. The 6 A6M Zeros strafed parked aircraft at Marine Corps Air Station Ewa (MCAS Ewa), claiming 22 aircraft destroyed.

The second wave consisted of 9 Zeros and 18 D3As, one of each aborting with mechanical problems. The former strafed Naval Air Station Kaneohe Bay before moving on to attack Bellows Army Airfield. They strafed the airfield, and shot down two Curtiss P-40 fighters attempting to take off when the Zeros arrived and a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress heavy bomber that had earlier diverted from Hickam Army Airfield, and also destroyed a Stinson O-49 observation aircraft on the ground for the loss of one of their own. The fighters with remaining ammunition expended it strafing MCAS Ewa, the rendezvous point for the second-wave fighters. The D3As attacked various ships in Pearl Harbor, but it is not possible to identify which aircraft attacked which ship. Two D3As from &quot;Hiryū&quot; were lost during the attack, one shot down by Second Lieutenant George Welch.

While returning to Japan after the attack, Nagumo ordered that &quot;Sōryū&quot; and &quot;Hiryū&quot; be detached on 16 December to attack the defenders of Wake Island who had already defeated the first Japanese attack on the island. The two carriers reached the vicinity of the island on 21 December and launched 29 D3As and 2 B5Ns, escorted by 18 Zeros, to attack ground targets. They encountered no aerial opposition and launched 35 B5Ns and 6 A6M Zeros the following day. They were intercepted by the 2 surviving Grumman F4F Wildcat fighters of Marine Fighter Squadron VMF-211. The Wildcats shot down 2 B5Ns before they were shot down by PO3c Isao Towara. The garrison surrendered the next day after Japanese troops were landed.

The carriers arrived at Kure on 29 December. They were assigned to the Southern Force on 8 January 1942 and departed four days later for the Dutch East Indies. The ships supported the invasion of the Palau Islands and the Battle of Ambon, attacking Allied positions on the island on 23 January with 54 aircraft. Four days later the carriers detached 18 Zeros and 9 D3As to operate from land bases in support of Japanese operations in the Battle of Borneo. &quot;Hiryū&quot; and &quot;Sōryū&quot; arrived at Palau on 28 January and waited for the arrival of the carriers and &quot;Akagi&quot;. All four carriers departed Palau on 15 February and launched air strikes against Darwin, Australia, four days later. &quot;Hiryū&quot; contributed 18 B5Ns, 18 D3As, and 9 Zeros to the attack. Her aircraft attacked the ships in port and its facilities, sinking or setting on fire three ships and damaging two others. The Zeros destroyed 1 P-40E as it was taking off, 2 Consolidated PBY Catalina seaplanes on the water, and a Zero was forced to crash land after being damaged by a P-40E of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) 33rd Pursuit Squadron.

&quot;Hiryū&quot; and the other carriers arrived at Staring Bay on Celebes Island on 21 February to resupply and rest before departing four days later to support the invasion of Java. On 1 March 1942, the ship&#x27;s D3As damaged the destroyer badly enough for her to be caught and sunk by Japanese cruisers. Later that day the dive bombers sank the oil tanker . The four carriers launched an airstrike of 180 aircraft against Tjilatjep on 5 March and set the town on fire, sinking five small ships, and damaging nine others that later had to be scuttled. Two days later, they attacked Christmas Island and &quot;Hiryū&quot;″s aircraft sank the Dutch freighter &quot;Poelau Bras&quot; before returning to Staring Bay on 11 March to resupply and train for the impending Indian Ocean raid. This raid was intended to secure newly conquered Burma, Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies against any Allied attack by destroying base facilities and forces in the eastern Indian Ocean.

===Indian Ocean Raid===

On 26 March, the five carriers of the First Air Fleet departed from Staring Bay; they were spotted by a Catalina about southeast of Ceylon on the morning of 4 April. Six of &quot;Hiryū&quot;″s Zeros were on Combat Air Patrol (CAP) and helped to shoot it down. Nagumo closed to within of Colombo before launching an airstrike the next morning. &quot;Hiryū&quot; contributed 18 B5Ns and 9 Zeros to the force; the latter encountered a flight of 6 Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers from 788 Naval Air Squadron en route and shot them all down without loss. The Japanese aircraft encountered defending Hawker Hurricane fighters from Nos. 30 and 258 Squadrons RAF over Ratmalana airfield and &quot;Hiryū&quot;″s fighters claimed to have shot down 11 with 3 Zeros damaged, although the fighters from the other carriers also made claims. British losses were 21 Hurricanes shot down and 2 more forced to crash land. The D3As and B5Ns inflicted some damage to the port facilities, but a day&#x27;s warning had allowed much of the shipping in the harbor to be evacuated. The British were attempting to find Nagumo&#x27;s ships all morning and &quot;Hiryū&quot;″s Zeros on CAP over the fleet helped to shoot down an RAF Catalina, shot down a Fairey Albacore torpedo bomber and drove off another from the carrier . Later that morning the British heavy cruisers and were spotted and &quot;Hiryū&quot; launched 18 D3As. They sank both ships in combination with the dive bombers from the other carriers.

On the morning of 9 April, &quot;Hiryū&quot;″s CAP shot down another Catalina attempting to locate the fleet and, later that morning, contributed 18 B5Ns, escorted by 6 Zeros, to the attack on Trincomalee. The fighters engaged 261 Squadron RAF, claiming to have shot down two with two more shared with fighters from the other carriers. British losses were only eight fighters, but the Japanese pilots claimed a total of 49 aircraft shot down when the RAF only had 16 Hurricanes in the fight. The British pilots shot down one of &quot;Hiryū&quot;″s B5Ns and forced another to crash land while they were bombing the port. Meanwhile, a floatplane from the battleship spotted the small aircraft carrier , escorted by the destroyer , and every available D3A was launched to attack the ships, escorted by nine Zeros. &quot;Hiryū&quot; contributed 18 dive bombers and 3 fighters, but they arrived too late to assist in sinking them and found two other ships further north. They sank the freighter RFA &quot;Athelstone&quot; and her escorting corvette, . While this was going on, &quot;Akagi&quot; narrowly escaped damage when 9 British Bristol Blenheim bombers from Ceylon penetrated the CAP and dropped their bombs from . &quot;Hiryū&quot; had eight Zeros aloft, along with 12 more from the other carriers, and collectively they accounted for 5 of the British bombers for the loss of 1 of &quot;Hiryū&quot;″s Zeros. The Blenheims ran into the D3As from , escorted by &quot;Hiryū&quot;″s Zeros, on their way back home and lost one more bomber to the Japanese aircraft. The dive bombers claimed to have shot down two Blenheims in conjunction with the Zeros, which claimed one on their own, for the loss of one Zero shot down by the bombers&#x27; gunners and one D3A damaged. After launching the dive bombers that sank &quot;Hermes&quot; and the other ships, the First Air Fleet reversed course and headed southeast for the Malacca Strait and Japan.

On 19 April, while transiting the Bashi Straits between Taiwan and Luzon en route to Japan, &quot;Hiryū&quot;, &quot;Sōryū&quot;, and &quot;Akagi&quot; were sent in pursuit of the American carriers and , which had launched the Doolittle Raid against Tokyo. They found only empty ocean, as the American carriers had immediately departed the area to return to Hawaii. The carriers quickly abandoned the chase and dropped anchor at Hashirajima anchorage on 22 April. Having been engaged in constant operations for four and a half months, the ship, along with the other three carriers of the First and Second Carrier Divisions, was hurriedly refitted and replenished in preparation for the Combined Fleet&#x27;s next major operation, scheduled to begin one month hence. While at Hashirajima, &quot;Hiryū&quot;″s air group was based ashore at Tomitaka Airfield, near Saiki, Ōita, and conducted flight and weapons training with the other First Air Fleet carrier units.

===Midway===

Concerned by the American carrier strikes in the Marshall Islands, Lae-Salamaua, and the Doolittle raids, Yamamoto was determined to force the U.S. Navy into a showdown to eliminate the American carrier threat. He decided to invade and occupy Midway Atoll, which he was sure would draw out the American carriers to defend it. The Japanese code-named the Midway invasion Operation &quot;MI&quot;. Unknown to the Japanese, the U.S. Navy had divined the Japanese plan by breaking its JN-25 code and had prepared an ambush using its three available carriers, positioned northeast of Midway.

On 25 May 1942, &quot;Hiryū&quot; set out with the Combined Fleet&#x27;s carrier striking force in the company of &quot;Kaga&quot;, &quot;Akagi&quot;, and &quot;Sōryū&quot;, which constituted the First and Second Carrier Divisions, for the attack on Midway. Her aircraft complement consisted of 18 Zeros, 18 D3As, and 18 B5Ns. Also aboard were three A6Ms of the 6th Kōkūtai intended as the aerial garrison for Midway. With the fleet positioned northwest of Midway at dawn (04:45 local time) on 4 June 1942, &quot;Hiryū&quot;″s portion of the 108-plane airstrike was an attack on the facilities on Sand Island with 18 torpedo bombers, one of which aborted with mechanical problems, escorted by nine Zeros. The air group suffered heavily during the attack: Two B5Ns were shot down by fighters, with a third falling victim to antiaircraft fire. Heavy damage forced a fourth, flown by squadron leader Rokuro Kikuchi, to crash-land on Kure Atoll, where he and his crew were later discovered and killed by U.S. forces. A fifth B5N was forced to ditch on its return, and five more were damaged beyond repair. In addition, two Zeros were also deemed unserviceable, although none were lost.

The carrier also contributed three Zeros to the total of 11 assigned to the initial CAP over the four carriers. By 07:05, the carrier had six fighters with the CAP, which helped to defend the &quot;Kido Butai&quot; from the first U.S. attackers from Midway Island at 07:10. At this time, Nagumo&#x27;s carriers were attacked by six U.S. Navy Grumman TBF Avengers and four USAAC Martin B-26 Marauders, all carrying torpedoes. The Avengers went after &quot;Hiryū&quot; while the Marauders attacked &quot;Akagi&quot;. The 30 CAP Zeros in the air at this time, including the six from &quot;Hiryū&quot;, immediately attacked the American airplanes, shooting down five of the Avengers and two of the B-26s. The Avengers shot down one of &quot;Hiryū&quot;″s Zeros. The surviving aircraft dropped their torpedoes, but all missed.

At 07:15, Nagumo ordered the B5Ns on &quot;Kaga&quot; and &quot;Akagi&quot; rearmed with bombs for another attack on Midway Island. This process was slowed by the number of ordnance carts used to handle the bombs and torpedoes and the limited number of ordnance elevators. This meant that the torpedoes could not be struck below until after all the bombs were moved up from their magazine, assembled and mounted on the aircraft. This process normally took about an hour and a half; more time would be required to bring the aircraft up to the flight deck, and to warm up and launch the strike group. Around 07:40, he reversed his order when he received a message from one of his scout aircraft that American warships had been spotted. Depleted of ammunition, two of &quot;Hiryū&quot;″s CAP Zeros landed aboard the carrier at 07:40.

At 07:55, the next American strike from Midway arrived in the form of 16 Marine Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers of Marine Scout Bomber Squadron 241 (VMSB-241) under Major Lofton R. Henderson. &quot;Hiryū&quot;″s three CAP fighters were among the nine still aloft that attacked Henderson&#x27;s planes, shooting down six of them as they executed a fruitless glide bombing attack on &quot;Hiryū&quot;. In return, the gunner of one of the Dauntlesses shot down one of &quot;Hiryū&quot;″s Zeros. At roughly the same time, the Japanese carriers were attacked by 12 USAAC B-17s, bombing from . The high altitude of the B-17s gave the Japanese captains enough time to anticipate where the bombs would land, and they successfully maneuvered out of the impact area. Four B-17s attacked &quot;Hiryū&quot;, but missed with all their bombs.

&quot;Hiryū&quot; reinforced the CAP with launches of three more Zeros at 08:25. These fresh Zeros helped defeat the next American air strike from Midway, 11 Vought SB2U Vindicator dive bombers from VMSB-241, which attacked the battleship &quot;Haruna&quot; starting around 08:30. &quot;Haruna&quot; escaped damage and three of the Vindicators were shot down. Although all the American air strikes had thus far caused negligible damage, they kept the Japanese carrier forces off-balance as Nagumo endeavored to prepare a response to news, received at 08:20, of the sighting of American carrier forces to his northeast.

&quot;Hiryū&quot; began recovering her Midway strike force at around 09:00 and finished shortly by 09:10. The landed aircraft were quickly struck below, while the carriers&#x27; crews began preparations to spot aircraft for the strike against the American carrier forces. The preparations were interrupted at 09:18, when the first attacking American carrier aircraft were sighted. These consisted of 15 Douglas TBD Devastator torpedo bombers of VT-8, led by Lieutenant Commander John C. Waldron from the &quot;Hornet&quot;. They attempted a torpedo attack on &quot;Soryū&quot;, but all of the American planes were shot down by the 18 CAP fighters, leaving one surviving aviator treading water.

Shortly afterwards, 14 Devastators from Torpedo Squadron 6 (VT-6) from &quot;Enterprise&quot;, led by Lieutenant Commander Eugene E. Lindsey, attacked. Lindsey&#x27;s aircraft tried to sandwich &quot;Kaga&quot;, but the CAP, reinforced by four additional Zeros launched by &quot;Hiryū&quot; at 09:37, shot down all but four of the Devastators, and &quot;Kaga&quot; dodged the torpedoes. &quot;Hiryū&quot; launched another trio of CAP Zeros at 10:13 after Torpedo Squadron 3 (VT-3) from &quot;Yorktown&quot; was spotted. Two of her Zeros were shot down by Wildcats escorting VT-3 and another was forced to ditch.
While VT-3 was still attacking &quot;Hiryū&quot;, American dive bombers arrived over the Japanese carriers almost undetected and began their dives. It was at this time, around 10:20, that in the words of Jonathan Parshall and Anthony Tully, the &quot;Japanese air defenses would finally and catastrophically fail.&quot; Three American dive bomber squadrons now attacked the three other carriers and set each of them on fire. &quot;Hiryū&quot; was untouched and proceeded to launch 18 D3As, escorted by six Zeros, at 10:54. &quot;En route&quot;, the Zeros engaged a group of &quot;Enterprise&quot; SBDs that they had spotted. They failed to shoot down any of the dive bombers, but two of the Zeros were shot up by the bombers&#x27; rear gunners, with one Zero forced to ditch near a destroyer on its return. American radar detected the incoming Japanese dive bombers at 11:52 and vectored &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s CAP of 20 Wildcats against them. The Wildcats shot down three of the remaining Zeros for the loss of one of their own and engaged the D3As. Only seven of the dive bombers survived long enough to make their attack on &quot;Yorktown&quot; and two of those were shot down by flak during their dive, but they made three direct hits and two near misses that badly damaged the carrier and set her on fire.

Confident that his men had sunk &quot;Yorktown&quot;, Yamaguchi launched a second wave of ten B5Ns (including one from &quot;Akagi&quot;), escorted by six Zeros (two from &quot;Kaga&quot;), at 13:30, with the instruction that they attack a separate carrier than that hit by the first wave. However, the Americans had managed to extinguish the fires on &quot;Yorktown&quot; by 14:00, and the carrier was making by 14:30 when the second strike group approached. As a result, the strike pilots mistook her for one of her undamaged sisters, and launched the attack. At that moment, six Wildcats were on CAP duty, and four of these were vectored toward the attacking aircraft while the other two were retained to cover the takeoff of ten Wildcats fueling on deck. The Japanese were jumped at 14:38 by two Wildcats, which shot down one torpedo bomber before they were both shot down by the escorting Zeros (two Zeros were shot down later for the loss of one Wildcat). Four more B5Ns fell during the attack, but two of the survivors managed to score hits on &quot;Yorktown&quot; that damaged three boilers and knocked out all electrical power so that she could not pump fuel oil to starboard to counteract her six-degree list to port. Seventeen minutes later, after the list increased to 23 degrees, the crew was ordered to abandon ship. Of the four Zeros and five B5Ns that returned to &quot;Hiryū&quot;, only two Zeros and three bombers were still airworthy.
Yamaguchi radioed his intention to Nagumo at 16:30 to launch a third strike against the American carriers at dusk (approximately 18:00), but Nagumo ordered the fleet to withdraw to the west. Unbeknownst to the Japanese, &quot;Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Hornet&quot; had already launched airstrikes well before then. &quot;Enterprise&quot; launched a total of 26 Dauntlesses at 15:25 using her own aircraft plus those from &quot;Yorktown&quot; that had been forced to recover aboard her after &quot;Yorktown&quot; was damaged, and &quot;Hornet&quot; launched 16 more of her own Dauntlesses at 16:00. At this point in the battle, &quot;Hiryū&quot; had only four airworthy dive-bombers and five torpedo-planes left. She also retained 19 of her own fighters on board, as well as a further 13 Zeros on CAP (a composite force of survivors from the other carriers). At 16:45, &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s dive bombers spotted the Japanese carrier and began to maneuver for good attacking position while reducing altitude. At 16:56, just as the first Dauntlesses were beginning their dives, Nagumo ordered a change in course to 120 degrees, possibly to prepare to recover his reconnaissance floatplanes, that threw off the aim of the leading SBDs. The Japanese did not even spot the Americans until 17:01. The CAP shot down two of the American aircraft in their dives and another after it was forced to abort its dive when some of &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s SBDs passed in front of it, starting their own dives. &quot;Hiryū&quot; was struck by four bombs, three on the forward flight deck and one on the forward elevator. The explosions started fires among the aircraft on the hangar deck. The forward half of the flight deck collapsed into the hangar while part of the elevator was hurled against the ship&#x27;s bridge. The fires were severe enough that the remaining American aircraft attacked the other ships escorting &quot;Hiryū&quot;, albeit without effect, deeming further attacks on the carrier as a waste of time, because she was aflame from stem to stern. Beginning at 17:42, two groups of B-17s attempted to attack the Japanese ships without success, although one bomber strafed &quot;Hiryū&quot;″s flight deck, killing several anti-aircraft gunners.
Although &quot;Hiryū&quot;″s propulsion was not affected, the fires could not be brought under control. At 21:23, her engines stopped, and at 23:58 a major explosion rocked the ship. The order to abandon ship was given at 03:15, and the survivors were taken off by the destroyers and . Yamaguchi and Kaku decided to remain on board as &quot;Hiryū&quot; was torpedoed at 05:10 by &quot;Makigumo&quot; as the ship could not be salvaged. One torpedo missed and the other struck near the bow without the typical plume of water, although the detonation was quite visible. Around 07:00, one of &#x27;s Yokosuka B4Y aircraft discovered &quot;Hiryū&quot; still afloat and not in any visible danger of sinking. The aviators could also see crewmen aboard the carrier, men who had not received word to abandon ship. They finally launched some of the carrier&#x27;s boats and abandoned ship around 09:00. Thirty-nine men made it into the ship&#x27;s cutter only moments before &quot;Hiryū&quot; sank around 09:12, taking the bodies of 389 men with her. The cutter drifted for 14 days before being discovered by a PBY Catalina and rescued by the seaplane tender . Four men died of their wounds or exposure before being picked up and a fifth died that night.

The loss of &quot;Hiryū&quot; and the three other IJN carriers at Midway, comprising two thirds of Japan&#x27;s total number of fleet carriers and the experienced core of the First Air Fleet, was a strategic defeat for Japan and contributed significantly to Japan&#x27;s ultimate defeat in the war. In an effort to conceal the defeat, the ship was not immediately removed from the Navy&#x27;s registry of ships, instead being listed as &quot;unmanned&quot; before finally being struck from the registry on 25 September 1942.

The IJN selected a modified version of the &quot;Hiryū&quot; design for mass production to replace the carriers lost at Midway. Of a planned program of 16 ships of the , only six were laid down and three were commissioned before the end of the war.

<doc id="65568" wikidata="Q726146" url="?curid=65568" title="Japanese aircraft carrier Kaga">
<text>was an aircraft carrier built for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN). Originally intended to be one of two s, &quot;Kaga&quot; was converted under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty to an aircraft carrier as the replacement for the battlecruiser , which had been irreparably damaged during the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake. &quot;Kaga&quot; was rebuilt in 1933–1935, increasing her top speed, improving her exhaust systems, and adapting her flight decks to accommodate more modern, heavier aircraft.

The ship figured prominently in the development of the IJN&#x27;s carrier striking force doctrine, which grouped carriers together to give greater mass and concentration to their air power. A revolutionary strategic concept at the time, the employment of the doctrine was crucial in enabling Japan to attain its initial strategic goals during the first six months of the Pacific War.

&quot;Kaga&quot;″s aircraft first supported Japanese troops in China during the Shanghai Incident of 1932 and participated in the Second Sino-Japanese War in the late 1930s. With other carriers, she took part in the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 and the invasion of Rabaul in the Southwest Pacific in January 1942. The following month her aircraft participated in a combined carrier airstrike on Darwin, Australia, and helping secure the conquest of the Dutch East Indies by Japanese forces. She missed the Indian Ocean raid in April as she had to return to Japan for repairs after hitting a reef in February.

Following repairs, &quot;Kaga&quot; rejoined the 1st Air Fleet for the Battle of Midway in June 1942. After bombarding American forces on Midway Atoll, &quot;Kaga&quot; and three other IJN carriers were attacked by American aircraft from Midway and the carriers , , and . Dive bombers from &quot;Enterprise&quot; severely damaged &quot;Kaga&quot;; when it became obvious she could not be saved, she was scuttled by Japanese destroyers to prevent her from falling into enemy hands. The loss of &quot;Kaga&quot; and three other IJN carriers at Midway was a crucial setback for Japan, and contributed significantly to Japan&#x27;s ultimate defeat. In 1999, debris from &quot;Kaga&quot; including a large section of her hull was located on the ocean floor northwest of Midway Island. In 2019, discovered her wreck on the ocean floor.

==Design and construction==

&quot;Kaga&quot; was laid down as a , and was launched on 17 November 1921 at the Kawasaki Heavy Industries shipyard in Kobe. On 5 February 1922 both &quot;Tosa&quot;-class ships were canceled and scheduled to be scrapped under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty.

The Treaty authorized conversion of two battleship or battlecruiser hulls into aircraft carriers of up to standard displacement. The incomplete battlecruisers &quot;Amagi&quot; and were initially selected, but the Great Kantō earthquake of 1923 damaged &quot;Amagi&quot;″s hull beyond economically feasible repair, and &quot;Kaga&quot; was selected as her replacement. The formal decision to convert &quot;Kaga&quot; to an aircraft carrier was issued 13 December 1923, but no work took place until 1925 as new plans were drafted and earthquake damage to the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal was repaired. She was officially commissioned on 31 March 1928, but this signified only the beginning of sea trials. She joined the Combined Fleet (&quot;Rengō Kantai&quot;) on 30 November 1929 as the IJN&#x27;s third carrier to enter service, after (1922) and &quot;Akagi&quot; (1927).

&quot;Kaga&quot; was completed with a length of overall. She had a beam of and a draft at full load of . She displaced at standard load, and at full load, nearly less than her designed displacement as a battleship. Her complement totaled 1,340 crewmembers.

===Flight deck arrangements===

&quot;Kaga&quot;, like &quot;Akagi&quot;, was completed with three superimposed flight decks, the only carriers ever to be designed so. The British carriers converted from &quot;large light cruisers&quot;, , , and , each had two flight decks, but there is no evidence that the Japanese copied the British model. It is more likely that it was a case of the parallel designs converging in separate attempts to improve launch and recovery cycle flexibility by allowing simultaneous launch and recovery of aircraft. &quot;Kaga&quot;″s main flight deck was long and wide, her middle flight deck was only about long and started in front of the bridge, and her lower flight deck was approximately long. The utility of her middle flight deck was questionable as it was so short that only some of the lightly loaded aircraft could use it, even in an era when the aircraft were much lighter and smaller than they were during World War II. The ever-increasing growth in aircraft performance, size and weight during the 1930s meant that even the bottom flight deck was no longer able to accommodate the take-off roll required for the new generations of aircraft being fielded and it was plated over when the ship was modernized in the mid-1930s. &quot;Kaga&quot; lacked an island until one was added during the modernization.

As completed, the ship had two main hangar decks and a third auxiliary hangar with a total capacity of 60 aircraft. The hangars opened onto the middle and lower flight decks to allow aircraft to take off directly from the hangars while landing operations were in progress on the main flight deck above. No catapults were fitted. Her forward aircraft elevator was offset to starboard and in size. Her aft elevator was on the centerline and . Her arresting gear was a French transverse system as used on their aircraft carrier and known as the Model Fju (&quot;Fju shiki&quot;) in the Japanese service. As originally completed, &quot;Kaga&quot; carried an air group of 28 Mitsubishi B1M3 torpedo bombers, 16 Nakajima A1N fighters and 16 Mitsubishi 2MR reconnaissance aircraft.

===Armament and armor===

&quot;Kaga&quot; was armed with ten 3rd Year Type guns, one twin-gun Type B turret on each side of the middle flight deck and six in casemates aft. They fired projectiles at a rate of three to six rounds per minute with a muzzle velocity of ; at 25°, they had a maximum range between . The Type B turrets were nominally capable of 70° elevation to provide additional anti-aircraft (AA) fire, but in practice the maximum elevation was only 55°. The slow rate of fire and the fixed 5° loading angle minimized any real anti-aircraft capability. This heavy gun armament was provided in case she was surprised by enemy cruisers and forced to give battle, but her large and vulnerable flight deck, hangars, and other features made her more of a target in any surface action than a fighting warship. Carrier doctrine was still evolving at this time and the impracticability of carriers engaging in gun duels had not yet been realized.

She was given an anti-aircraft armament of six twin 10th Year Type Model A2 gun mounts fitted on sponsons below the level of the funnels, where they could not fire across the flight deck, three mounts per side. These guns fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of ; at 45° this provided a maximum range of , and they had a maximum ceiling of at 75° elevation. Their effective rate of fire was 6 to 8 rounds per minute. She had two Type 89 directors to control her 20 cm guns and two Type 91 manually powered anti-aircraft directors (&quot;Kōshaki&quot;) to control her 12 cm guns. &quot;Kaga&quot;″s waterline armored belt was reduced from during her reconstruction and the upper part of her torpedo bulge was given of armor. Her deck armor was also reduced from .

===Propulsion===

When &quot;Kaga&quot; was being designed, the problem of how to deal with exhaust gases in carrier operations had not been resolved. The swiveling funnels of &quot;Hōshō&quot; had not proved successful and wind-tunnel testing had not provided an answer. As a result, &quot;Akagi&quot; and &quot;Kaga&quot; were given different exhaust systems to evaluate in real-world conditions. &quot;Kaga&quot;″s funnel gases were collected in a pair of long horizontal ducts which discharged at the rear of each side of the flight deck, in spite of predictions by a number of prominent naval architects that they would not keep the hot gases away from the flight deck. The predictions proved to be correct, not least because &quot;Kaga&quot; was slower than &quot;Akagi&quot;, which allowed the gases to rise and interfere with landing operations. Another drawback was that the heat of the gases made the crew&#x27;s quarters located on the side of the ship by the funnels almost uninhabitable.

&quot;Kaga&quot; was completed with four Kawasaki Brown-Curtis geared steam turbines with a total of on four shafts. As a battleship her expected speed had been , but the reduction in displacement from allowed this to increase to , as demonstrated on her sea trials on 15 September 1928. She had twelve Kampon Type B (Ro) boilers with a working pressure of , although only eight were oil-fired. The other four used a mix of oil and coal. She carried of fuel oil and of coal to give her a range of at .

==Early service and development of carrier doctrine==

On 1 December 1931 &quot;Kaga&quot; was assigned as the flagship of the First Carrier Division under the command of Rear Admiral Takayoshi Katō. The First Carrier Division, along with &quot;Hōshō&quot;, departed for Chinese waters on 29 January 1932 to support Imperial Japanese Army troops during the Shanghai Incident as part of the IJN&#x27;s 3rd Fleet. The B1M3s carried by &quot;Kaga&quot; and &quot;Hōshō&quot; were the main bombers used during the brief combat over Shanghai.
&quot;Kaga&quot;″s aircraft, operating from both the carrier and a temporary base at Kunda Airfield in Shanghai, flew missions in support of Japanese ground forces throughout February 1932. During one of these missions three of &quot;Kaga&quot;″s Nakajima A1N2 fighters, including one piloted by future ace Toshio Kuroiwa, escorting three Mitsubishi B1M3 torpedo bombers, scored the IJN&#x27;s first air-to-air combat victory on 22 February when they shot down a Boeing P-12 flown by an American volunteer pilot. &quot;Kaga&quot; returned to home waters upon the declaration of the cease-fire on 3 March and resumed fleet training with the rest of the Combined Fleet.

At this time, the IJN&#x27;s developing carrier doctrine was still in its earliest stages. &quot;Kaga&quot; and the other carriers were initially given roles as tactical force multipliers supporting the fleet&#x27;s battleships in the IJN&#x27;s &quot;decisive battle&quot; doctrine. In this role, &quot;Kaga&quot;″s aircraft were to attack enemy battleships with bombs and torpedoes. Aerial strikes against enemy carriers were later, beginning around 1932–1933, deemed of equal importance in order to establish air superiority during the initial stages of battle. The essential component in this strategy was that the Japanese carrier aircraft must be able to strike first with a massed aerial attack. As a result, in fleet training exercises the carriers began to operate together in front of or with the main battle line. This revolutionary strategy emphasized maximum speed from both the carriers and the aircraft they carried as well as larger aircraft with greater range. Thus, longer flight decks on the carriers were required in order to handle the newer, heavier aircraft which were entering service.

&quot;Kaga&quot; was soon judged inferior to &quot;Akagi&quot; because of her slower speed, smaller flight deck ( shorter), and problematic funnel arrangement. Because of &quot;Kaga&quot;″s perceived limitations, she was given priority over &quot;Akagi&quot; for modernization. &quot;Kaga&quot; was relegated to reserve status on 20 October 1933 to begin a second major reconstruction, with an official start date of 25 June 1934.

==Reconstruction==
During her second reconstruction &quot;Kaga&quot;″s two lower flight decks were converted into hangars and, along with the main flight deck, were extended to the bow. This increased the flight deck length to and raised aircraft capacity to 90 (72 operational and 18 in storage). A third elevator forward, , serviced the extended hangars. Bomb and torpedo elevators were modified to deliver their munitions directly to the flight deck. Her arrester gear was replaced by a Japanese-designed Type 1 system. A small starboard island superstructure was also installed.
Her power plant was completely replaced as were her propellers. &quot;Kaga&quot; was equipped with eight improved oil-burning models of the Kampon Type B (Ro) with a working pressure of at a temperature of . New Kampon multi-stage geared turbines were fitted that increased her power from during trials. The hull was lengthened by at the stern to reduce drag and she was given another torpedo bulge above the side armor abreast the upper part of the existing bulge to increase her beam and lower her center of gravity as a result of lessons learned from the &quot;Tomozuru&quot; Incident in early 1934. This raised her standard displacement significantly, from . The extra power and the extra displacement roughly offset each other and her speed increased by less than a knot, up to on trials. Her fuel storage was increased to of fuel oil which increased her endurance to at . The lengthy funnel ducting was replaced by a single downturned starboard funnel modeled on that used by the &quot;Akagi&quot; with a water-cooling system for the exhaust gasses and a cover that could be raised to allow the exhaust gasses to escape if the ship developed a severe list and the mouth of the funnel touched the sea. The space freed up by the removal of the funnel ducts was divided into two decks and converted into living quarters for the expanded air group. The carrier&#x27;s complement increased to 1708 crewmembers.

The two twin turrets on the middle flight deck were removed and four new 20 cm 3rd Year Type No. 1 guns in casemates were added forward. Her 12 cm anti-aircraft guns were replaced by eight Type 89 guns in twin mounts. They fired projectiles at a rate between 8 and 14 rounds per minute at a muzzle velocity of ; at 45°, this provided a maximum range of , and a maximum ceiling of . Their sponsons were raised one deck to allow them some measure of cross-deck fire. Eleven twin 25 mm Type 96 gun mounts were added, also on sponsons. They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of ; at 50°, this provided a maximum range of , and an effective ceiling of . The maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute due to the frequent need to change the fifteen-round magazines. Six Type 11 machine guns were also carried. Six Type 95 directors were fitted to control the new 25 mm guns, but &quot;Kaga&quot; retained her outdated Type 91 anti-aircraft directors.

Several major weaknesses in &quot;Kaga&quot;″s design were not rectified. &quot;Kaga&quot;″s aviation fuel tanks were incorporated directly into the structure of the carrier, meaning that shocks to the ship, such as those caused by bomb or shell hits, would be transmitted directly to the tanks, resulting in cracks or leaks. Also, the fully enclosed structure of the new hangar decks made fire suppression difficult, at least in part because fuel vapors could accumulate in the hangars. Adding to the danger was the requirement from the Japanese carrier doctrine that aircraft be serviced, fueled, and armed whenever possible on the hangar decks rather than on the flight deck. In addition, the carrier&#x27;s hangar and flight decks carried little armor protection. Furthermore, there was no redundancy in the ship&#x27;s fire-extinguishing systems. These weaknesses would later be crucial factors in the loss of the ship.

==Sino-Japanese War==

&quot;Kaga&quot; returned to service in 1935 and was assigned to the Second Carrier Division. The carrier embarked a new set of aircraft, including 16 Nakajima A2N Type 90 fighters, 16 Aichi D1A Type 94/96 dive bombers, and 28 Mitsubishi B2M Type 89 torpedo bombers.
The renewal of hostilities with China at the Marco Polo Bridge in July 1937 found &quot;Kaga&quot; in home waters. The ship&#x27;s fighter squadron completed training at Ōmura, Nagasaki then helped escort ships taking army reinforcements from Japan to China. On 15 August, along with &quot;Hōshō&quot; and , the ship took station in the East China Sea as part of the 3rd Fleet and began supporting Japanese military operations along the central China coast around Shanghai and further inland.

&quot;Kaga&quot; aircraft fought their first battle on 15 August 1937, when thirteen Aichi D1A1 (Type 94) dive-bombers encountered Chinese Air Force Curtiss A-12 Shrike attack-bombers of the 26th and 27th Squadrons at Chao&#x27;er Airbase preparing for strikes against Japanese positions in Shanghai, and a dogfight duly ensued between the two unlikely dogfighting opponents; two D1A1s were shot down; a third badly shot-up D1A1 returned to &quot;Kaga&quot; with a fatally wounded crewman, while the D1A1 flight claimed three Shrikes. On 16 August 1937, six Type 90 fighters engaged four Chinese aircraft over Jiangwan, shooting down three without loss. Between 17 August and 7 September, &quot;Kaga&quot;″s Type 90 and two Mitsubishi A5M Type 96 fighters, which joined the carrier on 22 August, engaged Chinese aircraft on several more occasions. &quot;Kaga&quot;″s fighter pilots claimed to have shot down 10 Chinese aircraft in these encounters without loss. On 17 August twelve of the carrier&#x27;s bombers attacked Hangzhou without fighter escort and 11 of them were shot down by Chinese fighters. On 7 September, three Type 96 (A5M) fighters escorted six Type 96 (D1A2) bombers and were engaged by three Chinese Hawk IIIs near Taihu Lake; two Type 96 bombers were quickly shot down, but the ensuing half-hour long dogfight resulted in no further losses for either side despite claims. Beginning on 15 September, six Type 90 and six Type 96 fighters, 18 dive bombers, and 18 torpedo bombers were temporarily deployed to Kunda Airfield from the ship to support land operations.
On 26 September the carrier went to Sasebo for reprovisioning. At Sasebo, the carrier received new replacement aircraft including 32 Yokosuka B4Y Type 96 carrier attack planes (torpedo bombers), 16 Aichi D1A2 Type 96 carrier bombers (dive bombers), and 16 more Type 96 fighters. Several Nakajima A4N Type 95 fighter aircraft augmented the carrier&#x27;s fighter group at an unspecified later date.

&quot;Kaga&quot; returned to the front in early October 1937, and except for two brief trips to Sasebo, remained off China until December 1938. Using Taiwan (then part of the Empire of Japan) as its base, the carrier steamed supporting military operations from the South and East China Seas. During that time, &quot;Kaga&quot; bombers supported army operations by attacking enemy railroad bridges, airfields, and transportation vehicles. The carrier&#x27;s fighter pilots claimed to have destroyed at least 17 Chinese aircraft in aerial combat while losing five aircraft themselves. On 12 December 1937 &quot;Kaga&quot; aircraft participated in the Panay incident.

On 11 November 1937, three Chinese Air Force Northrop Gamma 2ECs of the 2nd BG, 14th Squadron led by Captain Yu Y.C. attacked &quot;Kaga&quot; off the Maanshan Islands near Shanghai; the bombs fell wide into &quot;Kaga&quot;″s wake, and the Chinese Gammas were pursued and intercepted by three A5Ms of &quot;Kaga&quot;″s combat air patrol (CAP) led by flight leader Jirō Chōno, which shot down two of the Gammas, while Yu managed to escape into the clouds and return to base in his damaged Gamma.

Six &quot;Kaga&quot; fighters were assigned to land bases near Shanghai and Nanking between 9 December 1937 and 15 January 1938. Nine fighters were temporarily based out of Nanking from 3 March through 4 April 1938. On 13 April 1938, &quot;Kaga&quot; launched eighteen D1A1s and three each of A4Ns and A5Ms on a strike against Canton, and they were met by two squadrons of Gloster Gladiators of the 5th Fighter Group led by Captain John Xinrui Huang and Captain Louie Yim-qun; Huang would score a triple kill in this battle against the &quot;Kaga&quot; raid, while Jirō Chōno (A5M) and Hatsuo Hidaka (A4N) would each claim double kills, including Chōno&#x27;s shooting-down of Huang, who was injured bailing out. &quot;Kaga&quot;″s fighter group at this time included future aces Jirō Chōno, Osamu Kudō, Yoshio Fukui, Watari Handa, Masaichi Kondō, Hatsuo Hidaka, Kiichi Oda, Satoru Ono, and Chitoshi Isozaki. The US Navy decrypted an IJN message which reportedly indicated that the attack on the and other neutral ships in the Yangtze River had been knowingly and deliberately planned by an air officer on &quot;Kaga&quot;.

&quot;Kaga&quot; entered the shipyard on 15 December 1938, where her arresting gear was replaced by a Type 3 system and her bridge was modernized. The flight deck and hangar areas were enlarged, increasing the carrier&#x27;s aircraft capacity. The ship was completely overhauled from 15 November 1939 to 15 November 1940 before returning to active service. In the meantime, a new generation of aircraft had entered service and &quot;Kaga&quot; embarked 12 A5M fighters, 24 D1A dive bombers and 36 B4Y torpedo bombers. Another 18 aircraft were carried in crates as spares.

The Japanese carriers&#x27; experiences off China had helped further develop the IJN&#x27;s carrier doctrine. One lesson learned in China was the importance of concentration and mass in projecting naval air power ashore. Therefore, in April 1941 the IJN formed the First Air Fleet to combine all of its fleet carriers under a single command. On 10 April 1941 &quot;Kaga&quot; was assigned to the First Carrier Division with &quot;Akagi&quot; as part of the new carrier fleet, which also included the Second and Fifth carrier divisions. The IJN centered its doctrine on airstrikes that combined the air groups within carrier divisions, rather than each individual carrier. When more than one carrier division was operating together, the divisions&#x27; air groups were combined with each other. This doctrine of combined, massed, carrier air attack groups was the most advanced of its kind of all the world&#x27;s navies. The IJN, however, remained concerned that concentrating all of its carriers together would render them vulnerable to being wiped out all at once by a massive enemy air or surface strike. Thus, the IJN developed a compromise solution in which the fleet carriers would operate closely together within their carrier divisions but the divisions themselves would operate in loose rectangular formations, with approximately separating the carriers from each other.

Although the concentration of so many fleet carriers into a single unit was a new and revolutionary offensive strategic concept, the First Air Fleet suffered from several defensive deficiencies which gave it, in Mark Peattie&#x27;s words, a &#x27;: it could throw a punch but couldn&#x27;t take one.&quot; Japanese carrier anti-aircraft guns and associated fire control systems had several design and configuration deficiencies which limited their effectiveness. The IJN&#x27;s fleet CAP consisted of too few fighter aircraft and was hampered by an inadequate early warning system, including a lack of radar. Poor radio communications with the fighter aircraft inhibited effective command and control of the CAP. The carriers&#x27; escorting warships were deployed as visual scouts in a ring at long range, not as close anti-aircraft escorts, as they lacked training, doctrine, and sufficient anti-aircraft guns. These deficiencies would eventually doom &quot;Kaga&quot; and other First Air Fleet carriers.

==World War II==
===Pearl Harbor===

In November 1941 the IJN&#x27;s Combined Fleet, under Isoroku Yamamoto, prepared to participate in Japan&#x27;s initiation of a formal war with the United States by conducting a preemptive strike against the United States Navy&#x27;s Pacific Fleet base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. On 17 November &quot;Kaga&quot;, under the command of Captain Jisaku Okada, loaded 100 torpedoes at Saeki Bay, Hiroshima; these torpedoes were specially designed for use in the shallow waters of the Pearl Harbor anchorage. On 19 November, &quot;Kaga&quot; and the rest of the Combined Fleet&#x27;s mobile strike force (&quot;Kido Butai&quot;), under Chuichi Nagumo and including six fleet carriers from the First, Second, and Fifth Carrier Divisions, assembled in Hitokappu Bay at Etorofu Island. The fleet departed Etorofu on 26 November and followed a course across the north-central Pacific to avoid commercial shipping lanes.

For the attack on Pearl Harbor, &quot;Kaga&quot; carried a total of 18 Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters, 27 Nakajima B5N torpedo bombers and 27 Aichi D3A dive bombers, plus three crated aircraft of each type for the operation. During the morning of 7 December 1941 &quot;Kaga&quot; aircraft participated in both First Air Fleet strikes launched against Oahu from a position north of the island. In the first strike of 183 total aircraft (six aborted), 26 &quot;Kaga&quot; B5N carrier attack bombers attacked the American ships at anchor with bombs and torpedoes, escorted by nine Zeros. In the second strike of 167 aircraft (four aborted), 26 &quot;Kaga&quot; D3A dive bombers targeted the airfield at Ford Island in the middle of the harbor while nine Zeros provided escort and attacked aircraft on the ground. A total of five B5Ns, four Zeros and six D3As from the ship were lost during the two strikes, along with their aircrews, a total of 31 personnel. &quot;Kaga&quot;″s bomber and torpedo crews claimed hits on the battleships , , , , , and . The ship&#x27;s fighter pilots claimed to have shot down one US aircraft and destroyed 20 on the ground. Upon completion of the attack, the First and Fifth Carrier divisions, including &quot;Kaga&quot;, returned immediately to Japan.

===Pacific conquest===

In January 1942, together with the rest of the First and Fifth Carrier Division carriers and staging out of Truk (now Chuuk) in Micronesia, &quot;Kaga&quot; supported the invasion of Rabaul in the Bismarck Islands. &quot;Kaga&quot; provided 27 bomb-carrying B5N and 9 Zeros for the initial airstrike on Rabaul on 20 January 1942, during which one B5N was shot down by anti-aircraft fire. The First Carrier Division attacked Allied positions at nearby Kavieng the following day, of which &quot;Kaga&quot; contributed nine Zeros and sixteen D3As. On the 22nd &quot;Kaga&quot;″s D3As and Zeros again attacked Rabaul and two dive bombers had to make emergency landings, but the crews were rescued. &quot;Kaga&quot; returned to Truk on 25 January and Rabaul and Kavieng were successfully occupied by Japanese forces by February.

On 9 February &quot;Kaga&quot; hit a reef at Palau after she had unsuccessfully sortied against American carrier forces attacking the Marshall Islands on 1 February. The damage reduced the carrier&#x27;s speed to 18 knots. After temporary repairs, she continued to the Timor Sea, where on 19 February 1942 she, with the other carriers of the First and Second Carrier Divisions, launched air strikes against Darwin, Australia, from a point southeast of the easternmost tip of Timor. &quot;Kaga&quot; contributed 27 B5Ns (carrying bombs), 18 D3A, and 9 Zeros to the attack, which caught the defenders by surprise. Eight ships were sunk, including the destroyer , and fourteen more were damaged, at a cost of only one of &quot;Kaga&quot;″s B5Ns. In March 1942, &quot;Kaga&quot;, based out of Staring-baai, helped cover the invasion of Java, although her only contribution appears to have been aircraft for the 5 March 1942 airstrike on Tjilatjap. In that attack &quot;Kaga&quot; contributed 27 bomb-carrying B5N escorted by nine Zeros. The attacking aircraft bombed merchant ships in the harbor, sinking eight of them, and attacked anti-aircraft batteries and a warehouse without loss. Most of the Allied forces in the Dutch East Indies surrendered to the Japanese later in March. &quot;Kaga&quot; was unable to participate in the Indian Ocean raid in April because of the damage she had received in February. Instead, she sailed for Sasebo on 15 March for repairs, entering drydock on 27 March. The repairs were completed on 4 May.

===Battle of Midway===
====Midway raid====
Concerned by the US carrier strikes such as the Doolittle Raid, on the Marshall Islands, and the Lae-Salamaua raids, Yamamoto was determined to force the US Navy into a showdown to eliminate the American carrier threat. Yamamoto decided to invade and occupy Midway Island, which he was sure would draw out the American carrier forces to battle. The Midway invasion was codenamed by the Japanese as Operation MI.

In support of &quot;MI&quot;, on 27 May 1942, &quot;Kaga&quot; departed the Inland Sea with the Combined Fleet on her final mission, in the company of carriers &quot;Akagi&quot;, , and which constituted the First and Second Carrier Divisions. Her aircraft complement was 27 Zeros, 20 D3As, and 27 B5Ns. With the fleet positioned northwest of Midway Island at dawn on 4 June 1942, &quot;Kaga&quot; contributed eighteen D3As, commanded by Lieutenant Shōichi Ogawa, escorted by nine Zeros to the strike against the island. The carrier&#x27;s B5Ns were armed with torpedoes and kept ready in case enemy ships were discovered during the Midway raid. One each of the D3As and Zeros was shot down by AA fire over Midway, and another four D3As were damaged. &quot;Kaga&quot;″s Zero pilots claimed to have shot down 12 US aircraft over Midway Island. One &quot;Kaga&quot; B5N was launched to augment the fleet&#x27;s reconnaissance of the surrounding ocean. The carrier also put up two Zeros on CAP. Another five Zeros reinforced her CAP at 07:00 and the seven fighters helped to defend the Kido Butai from the first US air attackers from Midway Island at 07:10. Unknown to the Japanese, the US Navy had divined the Japanese &quot;MI&quot; plan from signals intelligence and had prepared an ambush using its three available carriers, positioned northeast of Midway.

At 07:15 Admiral Nagumo ordered the B5Ns still on &quot;Kaga&quot; and &quot;Akagi&quot; rearmed with bombs for another attack on Midway itself. This process was limited by the number of ordnance carts used to handle the bombs and torpedoes and the limited number of ordnance elevators. Thus, the torpedoes could not be struck below until after all the bombs were moved up from their magazine, assembled and mounted on the aircraft. This process normally took about an hour and a half; more time would be required to bring the aircraft up to the flight deck and warm up and launch the strike group. Around 07:40 Nagumo reversed his order when he received a message that American carriers had been spotted. At 07:30 &quot;Kaga&quot; recovered three of her CAP.

====Sinking====
&quot;Kaga&quot;″s four remaining CAP fighters were in the process of landing when 16 Marine SBD Dauntless dive-bombers from Midway, led by Lofton R. Henderson, attacked around 07:55 without result. Five Zeros were launched at 08:15 and three intercepted a dozen Midway-based United States Army B-17 Flying Fortresses attempting to bomb the three other carriers from , but only limited damage was inflicted on the heavy bombers, although their attacks all missed. Five D3As also joined the CAP around this time. Another trio of Zeros were launched at 08:30. &quot;Kaga&quot; began landing her returning Midway strike force aboard around 08:35 and was finished by 08:50; one Zero pilot died after crash-landing his aircraft.

The five Zeros launched at 08:15 were recovered aboard at 09:10 and replaced by six more Zeros launched at 09:20. They intercepted the first US carrier aircraft to attack, TBD Devastator torpedo-bombers of VT-8 from the US carrier at 09:22, and shot down all 15, leaving only a single survivor, George H. Gay, Jr., treading water. Shortly thereafter, 14 Devastators from VT-6 from the US carrier , led by Eugene E. Lindsey, were spotted. They tried to sandwich &quot;Kaga&quot;, but the CAP, reinforced by another six Zeros launched by &quot;Kaga&quot; at 10:00, shot down all but four of the Devastators, and the carrier dodged the torpedoes.

Soon after the torpedo plane attacks, American carrier dive bombers arrived over the Japanese carriers almost undetected and began their dives. At 10:22, 25 SBD Dauntless dive-bombers from &quot;Enterprise&quot;, led by C. Wade McClusky, hit &quot;Kaga&quot; with one bomb and at least three bombs. The first landed near her rear elevator and set the berthing compartments on fire, and the next bomb hit the forward elevator and penetrated the upper hangar, setting off explosions and fires among the armed and fueled planes on her hangar deck. The third bomb exploded directly on the island, destroying the bridge, killing Okada and most of his command staff. The 1000-pound bomb hit amidships and penetrated the flight deck to explode on the upper hangar. The explosions ruptured the ship&#x27;s avgas lines, damaged both her port and starboard fire mains and the emergency generator powering her fire pumps, as well as knocking out the carbon dioxide fire suppression system. Fueled by the avgas pouring onto the hangar deck, the fires detonated the of bombs and torpedoes strewn across the hangar deck in a series of catastrophic multiple fuel-air explosions that blew out the hangar sides. At nearly the same time, dive bombers hit and fatally damaged &quot;Akagi&quot; and &quot;Sōryū&quot;.

Unable to contain her fires, &quot;Kaga&quot; survivors were taken off by the destroyers and between 14:00 and 17:00. Around 19:25 she was scuttled by two torpedoes from &quot;Hagikaze&quot; and sank stern-first at position . Warrant Officer Takeshi Maeda, an injured &quot;Kaga&quot; B5N aircrew member rescued by &quot;Hagikaze&quot;, described the scene: &quot;My comrade carried me up to the deck so I could see the last moments of our beloved carrier, which was nearby. Even though I was in pain tears started to run down my cheeks, and everyone around me was crying; it was a very sad sight.&quot;

The carrier&#x27;s crew suffered 811 fatalities, mainly among the aircraft mechanics and armorers stationed on the hangar decks and the ship&#x27;s engineers, many of whom were trapped below in the boiler and engine rooms by uncontrolled fires raging on the decks above them. Twenty-one of the ship&#x27;s aviators were killed. &quot;Kaga&quot;″s surviving crewmembers were restricted incommunicado to an airbase in Kyūshū for one to two months after returning to Japan, to help conceal word of the Midway defeat from the Japanese public. Many of the survivors were then transferred back to frontline units without being allowed to contact family. Some of the injured were quarantined in hospitals for almost a year. This was the highest loss of lives of all the Japanese carriers lost at Midway.

The loss of &quot;Kaga&quot; and the three other IJN carriers at Midway (&quot;Hiryū&quot; was also sunk during the battle), with their aircraft and veteran pilots, was a crucial strategic defeat for Japan and contributed significantly to Japan&#x27;s ultimate defeat in the war.

==Wreck survey==
In May 1999, the Nauticos Corporation, in partnership with the US Navy, discovered some wreckage from &quot;Kaga&quot;. They employed the research vessel during a survey of a fleet exercise area with the US Navy&#x27;s recently modified SEAMAP acoustic imaging system. A follow-on search by in September 1999 located the wreckage and took photos of it. The wreckage included a long section of hangar bulkhead, two 25 mm anti-aircraft gun tubs, and a landing light array. The artifacts were at a depth of .

On 18 October 2019, the wreck of &quot;Kaga&quot; was located by the Director of Undersea Operations for Vulcan Inc. Rob Kraft, David W. Jourdan and Naval History and Heritage Command historian Frank Thompson aboard . She sits upright at a depth of about , buried up to the degaussing wires in the seafloor and with most of her superstructure and flight deck missing. The wreck is surrounded by a large debris field and has been heavily colonized by marine growth. The wreck of &quot;Akagi&quot; was found by the same crew two days later. A more extensive survey of the wreck was conducted by the in September 2023.

<doc id="65569" wikidata="Q849588" url="?curid=65569" title="Japanese aircraft carrier Shōkaku">
<text>was the lead ship of her class of two aircraft carriers built for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) shortly before the Pacific War. Along with her sister ship , she took part in several key naval battles during the war, including the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Battle of the Coral Sea, and the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, before being torpedoed and sunk by the U.S. submarine at the Battle of the Philippine Sea.

==Design==

The &quot;Shōkaku&quot;-class carriers were part of the same program that also included the s. No longer restricted by the provisions of the Washington Naval Treaty, which expired in December 1936, the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) was free to incorporate all those features they deemed most desirable in an aircraft carrier, namely high speed, a long radius of action, heavy protection and a large aircraft capacity. &quot;Shōkaku&quot; was laid down at Yokosuka Dockyard on 12 December 1937, launched on 1 June 1939, and commissioned on 8 August 1941.

With an efficient modern design, a displacement of about , and a top speed of , &quot;Shōkaku&quot; could carry 70–80 aircraft. Her enhanced protection compared favorably to that of contemporary Allied aircraft carriers and enabled &quot;Shōkaku&quot; to survive serious damage during the battles of the Coral Sea and Santa Cruz.

===Hull===
In appearance, &quot;Shōkaku&quot; resembled an enlarged , though with a longer overall length, wider beam and a larger island. As in &quot;Hiryū&quot;, the forecastle was raised to the level of the upper hangar deck to improve seakeeping. She also had a wider, more rounded and heavily flared bow which kept the flight deck dry in most sea conditions.

The carrier&#x27;s forefoot was of the newly developed bulbous type, sometimes referred to informally as a &quot;Taylor pear&quot;, which served to reduce the hull&#x27;s underwater drag within a given range of speeds, improving both the ship&#x27;s speed and endurance. Unlike the larger bulbous forefeet fitted to the battleships and , however, &quot;Shōkaku&quot;″s did not protrude beyond the ship&#x27;s stem.

&quot;Shōkaku&quot; was 10,000 tons heavier than , mainly due to the extra armor incorporated into the ship&#x27;s design. Vertical protection consisted of on the main armor deck over the machinery, magazines and aviation fuel tanks, while horizontal protection consisted of along the waterline belt abreast the machinery spaces, reducing to outboard of the magazines.

&quot;Shōkaku&quot; normally stowed 150,000 gallons of avgas for operational use. Unlike British carriers, whose aviation fuel was stored in separate cylinders or coffer-dams surrounded by seawater, all pre-war Japanese carriers had their aviation fuel tanks built integral with the ship&#x27;s hull, and &quot;Shōkaku&quot; was no exception. The dangers this posed, however, did not become evident until wartime experience demonstrated these were often prone to cracking and leaking as the shocks and stresses of hits or near-misses to the carrier&#x27;s hull were inevitably transferred to and absorbed by the fuel tanks. Following the debacle at Midway in mid-1942, the empty air spaces around &quot;Shōkaku&quot;″s aviation fuel tanks, normally pumped full of inert carbon dioxide, were instead filled with concrete in an attempt to protect them from possible damage. But this did little to prevent volatile fumes spreading to the hangar decks in the event damage did occur, particularly demonstrated when &quot;Cavalla&quot; torpedoed and sank her.

===Machinery===
The geared turbines installed on &quot;Shōkaku&quot; were essentially the same as those on &quot;Sōryū&quot;, maximum power increasing by to . In spite of all the additional armor, greater displacement and a increase in draught, &quot;Shōkaku&quot; was able to attain a speed of just over during trials. Maximum fuel bunkerage was 4100 tons, giving her a radius of action of at . Two same-sized downward-curving funnels on the ship&#x27;s starboard side, just abaft the island, vented exhaust gases horizontally from the boilers and were sufficiently angled to keep the flight deck free of smoke in most wind conditions.

===Flight deck and hangars===
&quot;Shōkaku&quot;″s long wood-planked flight deck ended short of the ship&#x27;s bow and, just barely, short of the stern. It was supported by four steel pillars forward of the hangar box and by two pillars aft.

The flight deck and both hangars (upper and lower) were serviced by three elevators, the largest being the forward one at by , the middle and the rear elevators measured by . All three were capable of transferring aircraft weighing up to and raising or lowering them took approximately 15–20 seconds.

&quot;Shōkaku&quot;″s nine Type 4 electrically operated arrester wires followed the same standard arrangement as that on &quot;Hiryū&quot;, three forward and six aft. They were capable of stopping a aircraft at speeds of . A third crash barrier was added and a light collapsible wind-break screen was installed just forward of the island.

The upper hangar was and had an approximate height of ; the lower was and had an approximate height of . Together they had an approximate total area of . Hangar space was not greatly increased in comparison to &quot;Sōryū&quot; and both &quot;Shōkaku&quot; and &quot;Zuikaku&quot; could each carry just nine more aircraft than &quot;Sōryū&quot;, giving them a normal operating capacity of seventy-two plus room for twelve in reserve. Unlike on &quot;Sōryū&quot;, the reserve aircraft did not need to be kept in a state of disassembly, however, thereby shortening the time required to make them operational.

After experimenting with port-side islands on two previous carriers, and &quot;Hiryū&quot;, the IJN opted to build both &quot;Shōkaku&quot; and her sister ship &quot;Zuikaku&quot; with starboard-side islands.

In September 1942, a Type 21 air-warning radar was installed on &quot;Shōkaku&quot;″s island atop the central fire control director, the first such device to be fitted on any Japanese carrier. The Type 21 had a &quot;mattress&quot; antenna and the initial prototypes were light enough that no major structural modifications were necessary. Later versions, however, were bulkier and required eventual removal of the fifth fire control director in order to accommodate the larger and heavier antenna.

===Armament===
&quot;Shōkaku&quot;″s heavy anti-aircraft armament consisted of sixteen Type 89 dual-purpose AA guns in twin mountings. These were sited below flight deck level on projecting sponsons with four such paired batteries on either side of the ship&#x27;s hull, two forward and two aft. Four fire control directors were installed, two on the port side and two to starboard. A fifth fire control director was located atop the carrier&#x27;s island and could control any or all of the heavy-caliber guns as needed.

The light anti-aircraft armament initially consisted of twelve triple-mount Type 96 AA guns. In June 1942, &quot;Shōkaku&quot; had her anti-aircraft armament augmented with six triple 25 mm mounts, two each at the bow and stern, and one each fore and aft of the island. The bow and stern groups each received a Type 95 director. In October another triple 25 mm mount was added at the bow and stern and 10 single mounts were added before the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June 1944.

==Operational history==

&quot;Shōkaku&quot; and &quot;Zuikaku&quot; formed the Japanese 5th Carrier Division, embarking their aircraft shortly before the Pearl Harbor attack. Each carrier&#x27;s aircraft complement consisted of 18 Mitsubishi A6M2 &quot;Zero&quot; fighters, 27 Aichi D3A1 &quot;Val&quot; dive bombers, and 27 Nakajima B5N1 or B5N2 &quot;Kate&quot; torpedo bombers.

&quot;Shōkaku&quot; and &quot;Zuikaku&quot; joined the &quot;Kido Butai&quot; (&quot;Mobile Unit/Force&quot;, the Combined Fleet&#x27;s main carrier battle group) and participated in Japan&#x27;s early wartime naval offensives, including Pearl Harbor and the attack on Rabaul in January 1942.

In the Indian Ocean raid of March–April 1942, aircraft from &quot;Shōkaku&quot;, along with the rest of &quot;Kido Butai&quot;, attacked Colombo, Ceylon on 5 April, sinking two ships in harbor and severely damaging support facilities. The task force also found and sank two Royal Navy heavy cruisers, and , on the same day, as well as the aircraft carrier on 9 April off Batticaloa.

The Fifth Carrier Division was then deployed to Truk to support Operation Mo (the planned capture of Port Moresby in New Guinea). During this operation, &quot;Shōkaku&quot;″s aircraft helped sink the American aircraft carrier during the Battle of the Coral Sea but was herself seriously damaged on 8 May 1942 by dive bombers from and &quot;Lexington&quot; which scored three bomb hits: one on the carrier&#x27;s port bow, one to starboard at the forward end of the flight deck and one just abaft the island. Fires broke out but were eventually contained and extinguished. The resulting damage required &quot;Shōkaku&quot; to return to Japan for major repairs.

On the journey back, maintaining a high speed in order to avoid a cordon of American submarines out hunting for her, the carrier shipped so much water through her damaged bow that she nearly capsized in heavy seas. She arrived at Kure on 17 May 1942 and entered drydock on 16 June 1942. Repairs were completed within ten days and, a little over two weeks later on 14 July, she was formally reassigned to Striking Force, 3rd Fleet, Carrier Division 1.

The time required for repairs, combined with the aircraft and aircrew losses incurred by her and &quot;Zuikaku&quot;, kept both carriers from participating in the Battle of Midway.

Following her return to front-line duty, both &quot;Shōkaku&quot; and her sister-ship &quot;Zuikaku&quot;, with the addition of the light carrier , were redesignated as the First Carrier Division and took part in the Battle of the Eastern Solomons, where they damaged , but &quot;Shōkaku&quot; was in turn damaged by dive bombers of &quot;Enterprise&quot;, which prevented the bombardment of nearby Henderson Field.

The First Carrier Division subsequently participated in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands on 26 October 1942, where they crippled (&quot;Hornet&quot; was abandoned and later sunk by Japanese destroyers and ). &quot;Shōkaku&quot; was again seriously damaged, taking at least three (and possibly as many as six) 1,000-lb. bomb hits from a group of fifteen Douglas SBD-3 dive bombers launched from &quot;Hornet&quot; and . The Type 21 radar, installed a month ago, enabled the early detection of the incoming U.S. planes, so refueling crews were alerted below deck, giving them time to drain and purge the aviation gasoline lines before they were ruptured by bomb hits, thus saving the ship from the catastrophic avgas fires and explosions that caused most of the carrier sinkings in the Pacific theater. &quot;Shōkaku&quot; was also fortunate as she had few aircraft on board at the time of the attack. As a result, no major avgas fires broke out and her seaworthiness was preserved. Her flight deck and hangars, however, were left in shambles and she was unable to conduct further air operations during the remainder of the battle. The need for repairs kept her out of action for months, leaving other Japanese defensive operations in the Pacific lacking sufficient airpower.

After several months of repairs and training, &quot;Shōkaku&quot;, now under the command of Captain Hiroshi Matsubara, was assigned in May 1943 to a counterattack against the Aleutian Islands, but the operation was cancelled after the Allied victory at Attu. For the rest of 1943, she was based at Truk, then returned to Japan for maintenance late in the year.

===Sinking===
In 1944, &quot;Shōkaku&quot; was deployed to the Lingga Islands south of Singapore. On 15 June, she departed with the Mobile Fleet for Operation &quot;A-Go&quot;, a counterattack against Allied forces in the Mariana Islands, resulting in the Battle of the Philippine Sea. Her strike waves suffered heavy losses from U.S. combat air patrols and anti-aircraft fire, but some survived and returned safely to the carrier. One of her D4Y &quot;Suisei&quot; strike groups, composed of veterans from the Coral Sea and Santa Cruz engagements, broke through and one plane allegedly struck home with a bomb that damaged the battleship and caused many casualties, but this group suffered heavy losses themselves.

&quot;Shōkaku&quot; was struck at 11:22 on 19 June by three (possibly four) torpedoes from the submarine , under Commander Herman J. Kossler. As &quot;Shōkaku&quot; had been in the process of refueling and rearming aircraft and was in an extremely vulnerable condition, the torpedo hits started avgas fires that proved impossible to control. At 12:10, an aerial bomb exploded, detonating aviation fuel vapors which had spread throughout the ship. The order to abandon ship was given, but before the evacuation had progressed very far, &quot;Shōkaku&quot; abruptly took on water forward and sank quickly bow-first at position , taking 1,272 men with her. The light cruiser and destroyers , , and rescued Captain Matsubara and 570 men.

<doc id="65570" wikidata="Q749453" url="?curid=65570" title="Japanese aircraft carrier Sōryū">
<text>was an aircraft carrier built for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) during the mid-1930s. A sister ship, , was intended to follow &quot;Sōryū&quot;, but &quot;Hiryū&quot;″s design was heavily modified and she is often considered to be a separate class. &quot;Sōryū&quot;″s aircraft were employed in operations during the Second Sino-Japanese War in the late 1930s and supported the Japanese invasion of French Indochina in mid-1940. During the first months of the Pacific War, she took part in the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Battle of Wake Island, and supported the conquest of the Dutch East Indies. In February 1942, her aircraft bombed Darwin, Australia, and she continued on to assist in the Dutch East Indies campaign. In April, &quot;Sōryū&quot; aircraft helped sink two British heavy cruisers and several merchant ships during the Indian Ocean raid.

After a brief refit, &quot;Sōryū&quot; and three other carriers of the 1st Air Fleet (&quot;Kidō Butai&quot;) participated in the Battle of Midway in June 1942. After bombarding American forces on Midway Atoll, the carriers were attacked by aircraft from the island and the carriers , , and . Dive bombers from &quot;Yorktown&quot; crippled &quot;Sōryū&quot; and set her afire. Japanese destroyers rescued the survivors but the ship could not be salvaged and was ordered to be scuttled so as to allow her attendant destroyers to be released for further operations. She sank with the loss of 711 officers and enlisted men of the 1,103 aboard. The loss of &quot;Sōryū&quot; and three other IJN carriers at Midway was a crucial strategic defeat for Japan and contributed significantly to the Allies&#x27; ultimate victory in the Pacific.

==Design and description==
&quot;Sōryū&quot; was one of two large carriers approved for construction under the Imperial Japanese Navy&#x27;s 1931–32 Supplementary Program (the other being her near-sister &quot;Hiryū&quot;). In contrast to some earlier Japanese carriers, such as and , which were conversions of battlecruiser and battleship hulls respectively, &quot;Sōryū&quot; was designed from the keel up as an aircraft carrier and incorporated lessons learned from the light carrier .

The ship had a length of overall, a beam of and a draught of . She displaced at standard load and at normal load. Her crew consisted of 1,100 officers and ratings.

===Machinery===

&quot;Sōryū&quot; was fitted with four geared steam turbine sets with a total of , each driving one propeller shaft using steam provided by eight Kampon water-tube boilers. The turbines and boilers were the same as those used in the s. The ship&#x27;s power and slim, cruiser-type hull, with a length-to-beam ratio of 10:1, gave her a speed of and made her the fastest carrier in the world at the time of her commissioning. &quot;Sōryū&quot; carried of fuel oil which gave her a range of at . The boiler were together to the ship&#x27;s starboard side amidships and exhausted just below flight deck level through two funnels curved downwards.

===Flight deck and hangars===
The carrier&#x27;s flight deck was wide and overhung her superstructure at both ends, supported by pairs of pillars. &quot;Sōryū&quot;″s island was built on a starboard-side extension that protruded beyond the side of the hull so that it did not encroach on the width of the flight deck. Nine transverse arrestor wires were installed on the flight deck and could stop a aircraft. The flight deck was only above the waterline and the ship&#x27;s designers kept this distance low by reducing the height of the hangars. The upper hangar was and had an approximate height of ; the lower was and had an approximate height of . Together they had an approximate total area of . This caused problems in handling aircraft because the wings of a Nakajima B5N &quot;Kate&quot; torpedo bomber could neither be spread nor folded in the upper hangar.

Aircraft were transported between the hangars and the flight deck by three elevators, the forward one abreast the island on the centerline and the other two offset to starboard. The forward platform measured , the middle one , and the rear . They were capable of transferring aircraft weighing up to . &quot;Sōryū&quot; had an aviation gasoline capacity of for her planned aircraft capacity of sixty-three plus nine spares.

===Armament===
&quot;Sōryū&quot;″s primary anti-aircraft (AA) armament consisted of six twin-gun mounts equipped with 50-caliber 12.7-centimeter Type 89 dual-purpose guns mounted on projecting sponsons, three on either side of the carrier&#x27;s hull. The guns had a range of , and a ceiling of at an elevation of +90 degrees. Their maximum rate of fire was fourteen rounds a minute, but their sustained rate of fire was around eight rounds per minute. The ship was equipped with two Type 94 fire-control directors to control the guns, one for each side of the ship, although the starboard director on the island could control all of the Type 89 guns.

The ship&#x27;s light AA armament consisted of fourteen twin-gun mounts for license-built Hotchkiss 25 mm (1 in) Type 96 AA guns. Three of these were sited on a platform just below the forward end of the flight deck. The gun was the standard Japanese light AA weapon during World War II, but it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it largely ineffective. According to historian Mark Stille, the weapon had many faults including an inability to &quot;handle high-speed targets because it could not be trained or elevated fast enough by either hand or power, its sights were inadequate for high-speed targets, it possessed excessive vibration and muzzle blast&quot;. These guns had an effective range of , and a ceiling of at an elevation of +85 degrees. The effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute because of the frequent need to change the 15-round magazines. The Type 96 guns were controlled by five Type 95 directors, two on each side and one in the bow.

===Armor===
To save weight &quot;Sōryū&quot; was minimally armored; her waterline belt of of Ducol steel only protected the machinery spaces and the magazines. Comparable figures for &quot;Hiryū&quot; were over the machinery spaces and the aviation gasoline storage tanks increasing to over the magazines. &quot;Sōryū&quot;″s waterline belt was backed by an internal anti-splinter bulkhead. The ship&#x27;s deck was only 25 mm thick over the machinery spaces and thick over the magazines and aviation gasoline storage tanks.

==Construction and service==

Following the Japanese ship-naming conventions for aircraft carriers, &quot;Sōryū&quot; was named &quot;Blue (or Green) Dragon&quot;. The ship was laid down at the Kure Naval Arsenal on 20 November 1934, launched on 23 December 1935 and commissioned on 29 December 1937. She was assigned to the Second Carrier Division after commissioning. Her air group was initially intended to consist of eighteen Mitsubishi A5M (&quot;Claude&quot;) monoplane fighters, twenty-seven Aichi D1A2 (&quot;Susie&quot;) Type 96 dive bombers, and twelve Yokosuka B4Y (&quot;Jean&quot;) Type 96 torpedo bombers, but the A5Ms were in short supply and Nakajima A4N1 biplanes were issued instead. On 25 April 1938, nine A4Ns, eighteen D1A2s, and nine B4Ys transferred to Nanjing to support forces advancing up the Yangtze River. The air group advanced with the successful Japanese offensive, despite the defense by the Chinese Air Force and the Soviet Volunteer Group; it was transferred to Wuhu in early June and then to Anqing. Little is known of its operations there, but its primary role during this time was air defense. One fighter pilot of the group was killed after he shot down a Chinese aircraft. Leaving a few fighters and their pilots behind to serve as the nucleus of a new fighter unit, the air group returned to &quot;Sōryū&quot; on 10 July. The ship supported operations over Canton in September, but her aircraft saw no aerial combat. She returned home in December and spent most of the next year and a half training.

In September–October 1940, the ship was based at Hainan Island to support the Japanese invasion of French Indochina. In February 1941, &quot;Sōryū&quot; moved to Taiwan to reinforce the blockade of southern China. Two months later, the 2nd Carrier Division was assigned to the First Air Fleet, or &quot;Kido Butai&quot;, on 10 April. &quot;Sōryū&quot;″s air group was detached in mid-July and transferred to Hainan Island to support the occupation of southern Indochina. &quot;Sōryū&quot; returned to Japan on 7 August and became flagship of the 2nd Division. She was relieved of that role on 22 September as she began a short refit that was completed on 24 October. The ship arrived at Kagoshima two days later and she resumed her former role as flagship of the Division.

===Pearl Harbor and subsequent operations===

In November 1941 the IJN&#x27;s Combined Fleet, under Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, prepared to participate in Japan&#x27;s initiation of war with the United States by conducting a preemptive strike against the US Navy&#x27;s Pacific Fleet base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. On 22 November, &quot;Sōryū&quot;, commanded by Captain Ryusaku Yanagimoto, and the rest of the &quot;Kido Butai&quot; under Vice Admiral Chuichi Nagumo, including six fleet carriers from the First, Second, and Fifth Carrier Divisions, assembled in Hitokappu Bay at Etorofu Island. The fleet departed Etorofu on 26 November and followed a course across the north-central Pacific to avoid commercial shipping lanes. At this time &quot;Sōryū&quot; embarked 21 Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters, 18 Aichi D3A &quot;Val&quot; dive bombers, and 18 Nakajima B5N torpedo bombers. From a position north of Oahu, &quot;Sōryū&quot; and the other five carriers launched two waves of aircraft on the morning of 8 December 1941 (Japan time).

In the first wave, eight of &quot;Sōryū&quot;″s B5Ns were supposed to attack the aircraft carriers that normally berthed on the northwest side of Ford Island, but none were in Pearl Harbor that day; six B5Ns attacked the ships that were present, torpedoing the target ship , causing her to capsize, and the elderly light cruiser , damaging her. Two of the B5N pilots diverted to their secondary target, ships berthed alongside &quot;1010 Pier&quot;, where the fleet flagship was usually . That battleship was in drydock and her position was occupied by the light cruiser and the minelayer . One torpedo passed underneath &quot;Oglala&quot; and struck &quot;Helena&quot; in one of her engine rooms; the other pilot rejected these targets and attacked the battleship . Her other ten B5Ns were tasked to drop armor-piercing bombs on the battleships berthed on the southeast side of Ford Island (&quot;Battleship Row&quot;) and may have scored one or two hits on them. Her eight A6M Zeros strafed parked aircraft at Marine Corps Air Station Ewa, claiming twenty-seven aircraft destroyed in addition to five aircraft shot down.

&quot;Sōryū&quot;″s second wave consisted of nine A6M Zeros and seventeen D3As. The former attacked Naval Air Station Kaneohe Bay, losing one Zero to American anti-aircraft guns. On the return trip, the Zero pilots claimed to have shot down two American aircraft while losing two of their own. The D3As attacked various ships in Pearl Harbor, but it is not possible to identify which aircraft attacked which ship. Two of them were shot down during the attack.

While returning to Japan, Vice Admiral Chūichi Nagumo, commander of the First Air Fleet, ordered that &quot;Sōryū&quot; and &quot;Hiryū&quot; be detached on 16 December to attack the defenders of Wake Island who had already defeated the first Japanese attack on the island. The two carriers reached the vicinity of the island on 21 December and launched twenty-nine D3As and two B5Ns, escorted by eighteen Zeros, to attack ground targets. They encountered no aerial opposition and launched thirty-five B5Ns and six A6M Zeros the following day. They were intercepted by the two surviving Grumman F4F Wildcat fighters of Marine Fighter Squadron VMF-211. The Wildcats shot down two B5Ns before they were shot down themselves by the Zeros. The garrison surrendered the next day after Japanese troops were landed.

The carriers arrived at Kure on 29 December. They were assigned to the Southern Force on 8 January 1942 and departed four days later for the Dutch East Indies. The ships supported the invasion of the Palau Islands and the Battle of Ambon, attacking Allied positions on the island on 23 January with fifty-four aircraft. Four days later the carriers detached eighteen Zeros and nine D3As to operate from land bases in support of Japanese operations in the Battle of Borneo. On 30 January they destroyed two aircraft on the ground and shot down a Qantas Short Empire flying boat flying to Surabaya to pick up refugees.

&quot;Sōryū&quot; and &quot;Hiryū&quot; arrived at Palau on 28 January and waited for the arrival of the carriers &quot;Kaga&quot; and &quot;Akagi&quot;. All four carriers departed Palau on 15 February and launched air strikes against Darwin, Australia, four days later. &quot;Sōryū&quot; contributed eighteen B5Ns, eighteen D3As, and nine Zeros to the attack while flying Combat Air Patrols (CAP) over the carriers. Her aircraft attacked the ships in port and its facilities, sinking or setting on fire eight ships and causing three others to be beached lest they sink. The Zeros destroyed a single Consolidated PBY Catalina flying boat; one D3A was lost. The Japanese aircraft spotted a ship on the return trip but had expended all their ordnance and had to be rearmed and refueled before they could attack the vessel. Several hours later, nine of &quot;Sōryū&quot;″s D3As located and bombed an American supply ship of , &quot;Don Isidro&quot;, hitting her five times but failing to sink her. &quot;Sōryū&quot; and the other carriers arrived at Staring Bay on Celebes Island on 21 February to resupply and rest before departing four days later to support the invasion of Java. On 1 March 1942, the ship&#x27;s D3As damaged the destroyer badly enough for her to be caught and sunk by Japanese cruisers. Later that day the dive bombers sank the oil tanker . The four carriers launched an airstrike of 180 aircraft against Tjilatjep on 5 March, sinking five small ships, damaging another nine badly enough that they had to be scuttled, and set the town on fire. Two days later they attacked Christmas Island before returning to Staring Bay on 11 March to resupply and train for the impending Indian Ocean raid. This raid was intended to secure newly conquered Burma, Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies against Allied attack by destroying base facilities and forces in the eastern Indian Ocean.

===Indian Ocean raid===
On 26 March 1942, the five carriers of the First Air Fleet departed from Staring Bay; they were spotted by a Catalina about southeast of Ceylon on the morning of 4 April. Nagumo closed to within of Colombo before launching an airstrike the next morning. &quot;Sōryū&quot; contributed eighteen B5Ns and nine Zeros to the force. The pilots of the latter aircraft claimed to have shot down a single Fairey Fulmar of 806 Naval Air Squadron, plus seven other fighters while losing one of their own. The D3As and B5Ns inflicted some damage to the port facilities, but a day&#x27;s warning had allowed most of the shipping in the harbor to be evacuated. Later that morning the British heavy cruisers and were spotted and &quot;Sōryū&quot; launched eighteen D3As. They were the first to attack and claimed to have made fourteen hits on the two ships, sinking both in combination with the dive bombers from the other carriers.

On 9 April, &quot;Sōryū&quot; contributed eighteen B5Ns, escorted by nine Zeros, to the attack on Trincomalee. Her B5Ns were the first to bomb the port and her fighters did not encounter any British fighters. Meanwhile, a floatplane from the battleship spotted the small aircraft carrier , escorted by the Australian destroyer , and every available D3A was launched to attack the ships. &quot;Sōryū&quot; contributed eighteen dive bombers, but they arrived too late and instead found three other ships further north. They sank the oil tanker &quot;British Sergeant&quot; and the Norwegian cargo ship &quot;Norviken&quot; before they were attacked by eight Fulmars of 803 and 806 Naval Air Squadrons. The Royal Navy pilots claimed three D3As shot down for the loss of a pair of Fulmars; the Japanese actually lost four D3As with another five damaged. While this was going on, &quot;Akagi&quot; narrowly escaped damage when nine British Bristol Blenheim bombers from Ceylon penetrated the CAP and dropped their bombs from . &quot;Sōryū&quot; had six Zeros aloft, along with fourteen more from the other carriers, and they collectively accounted for five of the British bombers for the loss of one of &quot;Hiryū&quot;″s Zeros. After launching the D3As that sank &quot;Hermes&quot; and the other ships, the First Air Fleet reversed course and headed southeast for the Malacca Strait before recovering their aircraft; they then proceeded to Japan.

On 19 April, while transiting the Bashi Straits between Taiwan and Luzon en route to Japan, &quot;Akagi&quot;, &quot;Sōryū&quot;, and &quot;Hiryū&quot; were sent in pursuit of the American carriers and , which had launched the Doolittle Raid against Tokyo. They found only empty ocean, for the American carriers had immediately departed the area to return to Hawaii. The carriers quickly abandoned the chase and dropped anchor at Hashirajima anchorage on 22 April. Having been engaged in constant operations for four and a half months, &quot;Sōryū,&quot; along with the other three carriers of the First and Second Carrier Divisions, was hurriedly refitted and replenished in preparation for the Combined Fleet&#x27;s next major operation, scheduled to begin one month hence. While at Hashirajima, &quot;Sōryū&quot;″s air group was based ashore at nearby Kasanohara, near Kagoshima, and conducted flight and weapons training with the other First Air Fleet carrier units.

===Midway===
Concerned by the US carrier strikes in the Marshall Islands, Lae-Salamaua, and the Doolittle raids, Yamamoto was determined to force the US Navy into a showdown to eliminate the American carrier threat. He decided to invade and occupy Midway Island, an action that he was sure would draw out the American carriers. The Japanese codenamed the Midway invasion Operation &quot;MI&quot;.

On 25 May 1942, &quot;Sōryū&quot; set out with the Combined Fleet&#x27;s carrier striking force in the company of &quot;Kaga&quot;, &quot;Akagi&quot;, and &quot;Hiryū&quot;, which constituted the First and Second Carrier Divisions, for the attack on Midway Island. Her aircraft complement consisted of eighteen Zeros, sixteen D3As, eighteen B5Ns, and two preproduction reconnaissance variants (D4Y1-C) of the new Yokosuka D4Y dive bomber. Also aboard were three A6M Zeros of the 6th Kōkūtai intended as a portion of the aerial garrison for Midway.

With the fleet positioned northwest of Midway at dawn (04:45 local time) on 4 June 1942, &quot;Sōryū&quot;″s part in the 108-plane combined air raid was a strike on the airfield on Eastern Island with eighteen torpedo bombers escorted by nine Zeros. The air group suffered heavily during the attack; a single B5N was shot down by fighters, two more were forced to ditch on the return (both crews rescued), and five (including one that landed aboard &quot;Hiryu&quot;) were damaged beyond repair. The Japanese did not know that the US Navy had discovered their &quot;MI&quot; plan by breaking their cipher, and had prepared an ambush using its three available carriers, positioned northeast of Midway.

The carrier also contributed 3 Zeros to the total of eleven assigned to the initial combat air patrol (CAP) over the four carriers. By 07:00 the carrier had six fighters with the CAP that helped to defend the &quot;Kido Butai&quot; from the first US attackers from Midway Island at 07:10. At this time, Nagumo&#x27;s carriers were attacked by six US Navy Grumman TBF Avengers from Torpedo Squadron 8 (VT-8) that had been temporarily detached from the &quot;Hornet&quot; to Midway, and four United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) Martin B-26 Marauders, all carrying torpedoes. The Avengers went after &quot;Hiryū&quot; while the Marauders attacked &quot;Akagi&quot;. The thirty CAP Zeros in the air at this time, including the six from &quot;Sōryū&quot;, immediately attacked the American airplanes, shooting down five of the Avengers and two of the B-26s. The surviving aircraft dropped their torpedoes, but all missed. &quot;Sōryū&quot; launched three more Zeros to reinforce the CAP, at 07:10.

At 07:15 Admiral Nagumo ordered the B5Ns on &quot;Kaga&quot; and &quot;Akagi&quot; rearmed with bombs for another attack on Midway itself. This process was limited by the number of ordnance carts (used to handle the bombs and torpedoes) and ordnance elevators, preventing torpedoes from being stowed belowdeck until after all the bombs were moved up from their magazine, assembled, and mounted on the aircraft. The process normally took about an hour and a half; more time would be required to bring the aircraft up to the flight deck, and to warm up and launch the strike group. Around 07:40 Nagumo reversed his order when he received a message from one of his scout aircraft that American warships had been spotted. Depleted of ammunition, the first six of &quot;Sōryū&quot;″s CAP Zeros landed aboard the carrier at 07:30.

At 07:55, the next American strike from Midway arrived in the form of sixteen Douglas SBD Dauntless bombers of Marine Scout Bomber Squadron 241 (VMSB-241) under Major Lofton R. Henderson. &quot;Sōryū&quot;″s three CAP fighters were among the nine still aloft that attacked Henderson&#x27;s planes, shooting down six of them as they executed a fruitless glide-bombing attack on &quot;Hiryū&quot;. At roughly the same time, a dozen USAAC Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses attacked the Japanese carriers, bombing from . The high altitude of the B-17s gave the Japanese captains enough time to anticipate where the bombs would land and successfully maneuver their ships out of the impact area. Four B-17s attacked &quot;Sōryū&quot;, but they all missed.

The CAP defeated the next American air strike from Midway, shooting down three of the eleven Vought SB2U Vindicator dive bombers from VMSB-241, which attacked the battleship &quot;Haruna&quot; unsuccessfully, starting at around 08:30. Although all the American air strikes had thus far caused negligible damage, they kept the Japanese carrier forces off-balance as Nagumo endeavored to prepare a response to news, received at 08:20, of the sighting of American carrier forces to his northeast. Around 08:30 &quot;Sōryū&quot; launched one of her D4Ys on a mission to confirm the location of the American carriers.

&quot;Sōryū&quot; began recovering her Midway strike force at around 08:40 and finished shortly by 09:10. The landed aircraft were quickly struck below, while the carriers&#x27; crews began preparations to spot aircraft for the strike against the American carrier forces. The preparations were interrupted at 09:18 when the first American carrier aircraft to attack were sighted. These consisted of fifteen Douglas TBD Devastator torpedo bombers of VT-8, led by Lieutenant Commander John C. Waldron from &quot;Hornet&quot;. The three airborne CAP Zeros were landing aboard at 09:30 when the Americans unsuccessfully attempted a torpedo attack on &quot;Soryū&quot;, but three of the morning&#x27;s escort fighters were still airborne and joined the eighteen CAP fighters in destroying Waldron&#x27;s planes. All of the American planes were shot down, leaving George H. Gay Jr.—the only surviving aviator—treading water.

Shortly afterwards, fourteen Devastators from Torpedo Squadron 6 (VT-6) from the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, led by Lieutenant Commander Eugene E. Lindsey, attacked. Lindsey&#x27;s aircraft tried to sandwich &quot;Kaga&quot;, but the CAP, reinforced by three more Zeros launched by &quot;Sōryū&quot; at 09:45, shot down all but four of the Devastators, and &quot;Kaga&quot; dodged the torpedoes. &quot;Sōryū&quot; launched another trio of CAP Zeros at 10:00 and another three at 10:15 after Torpedo Squadron 3 (VT-3) from was spotted. A Wildcat escorting VT-3 shot down one of her Zeros.

While VT-3 was still attacking &quot;Hiryū&quot;, American dive bombers arrived over the Japanese carriers almost undetected and began their dives. It was at this time, around 10:20, that in the words of Jonathan Parshall and Anthony Tully, the &quot;Japanese air defenses would finally and catastrophically fail&quot;. At 10:25, &quot;Sōryū&quot; was attacked by thirteen Dauntlesses from &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s Bombing Squadron 3 (VB-3). The carrier received three direct hits from 1,000 lb (454 kg) bombs: one penetrated to the lower hangar deck amidships, and the other two exploded in the upper hangar deck fore and aft. The hangars contained armed and fueled aircraft preparing for the upcoming strike, resulting in secondary explosions and rupturing the steam pipes in the boiler rooms. Within a very short time the fires on the ship were out of control. At 10:40 she stopped and her crew was ordered to abandon ship five minutes later. The destroyers and rescued the survivors. &quot;Sōryū&quot; was still afloat and showed no signs of beginning to sink by early evening, so &quot;Isokaze&quot; was ordered to scuttle her with torpedoes so as to allow the destroyers to be used for possible operations that night. The destroyer reported at 19:15 that &quot;Sōryū&quot; had sunk at position . Losses were 711 crew of her complement of 1,103, including Captain Yanagimoto, who chose to remain on board. This was the highest mortality percentage of all the Japanese carriers lost at Midway, due largely to the devastation in both hangar decks.

The loss of &quot;Sōryū&quot; and the three other IJN carriers at Midway, comprising two-thirds of Japan&#x27;s total number of fleet carriers and the experienced core of the First Air Fleet, was a crucial strategic defeat and contributed significantly to the ultimate Allied victory. In an effort to conceal the defeat, the ship was not immediately removed from the Navy&#x27;s registry of ships, awaiting a &quot;suitable opportunity&quot; before finally being struck from the registry on 10 August 1942.

<doc id="65571" wikidata="Q228691" url="?curid=65571" title="Japanese aircraft carrier Zuikaku">
<text>was the second and last built for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) shortly before the beginning of the Pacific War. &quot;Zuikaku&quot; was one of the most modern Japanese aircraft carriers when commissioned, and saw successful action throughout numerous battles during the Pacific War.

&quot;Zuikaku&quot; started the war as part of Kidō Butai. Her aircraft struck airfields during the attack on Pearl Harbor that formally brought the United States into the war. She also participated in the Indian Ocean raid, where her dive bombers sank or helped to sink several major British warships. &quot;Zuikaku&quot; and her sister were detached from Kidō Butai to support Operation Mo, the invasion of Port Moresby, New Guinea, during which her torpedo bombers contributed to the sinking of the aircraft carrier at the Battle of the Coral Sea; however heavy airgroup losses and damage to &quot;Shōkaku&quot; resulted in both carriers missing the Battle of Midway. She and her sister fought US carriers at the Battle of the Eastern Solomons, and again at the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands where she helped to sink the aircraft carrier . During the Battle of the Philippine Sea and Battle of Leyte Gulf, she was damaged by US carrier aircraft, being sunk in the latter engagement.

&quot;Zuikaku&quot; was one of six carriers to participate in the Pearl Harbor attack and was the last of the six to be sunk in the war (, , , and in the Battle of Midway; in the Battle of the Philippine Sea; and &quot;Zuikaku&quot; in the Battle of Leyte Gulf.)

A memorial for the fallen personnel of the &quot;Zuikaku&quot; is located at the grounds of Kashihara Shrine, located in the city of Kashihara, Nara Prefecture, Japan.

==Service history==

&quot;Zuikaku&quot; was laid down on 25 May 1938, launched on 27 November 1939, and formally commissioned on 25 September 1941. On the day of commissioning, &quot;Zuikaku&quot; departed on her maiden voyage from Kobe to Kure. Under the command of Captain Yokokawa Ichibei, &quot;Zuikaku&quot; departed for Oita Bight on October 7, arriving at her destination the next day where for the first time she joined her sister ship . Both ships made up Carrier Division 5.

=== Attack on Pearl Harbor and subsequent activities ===
On 26 November 1941, she left Hitokappu Bay for the attack on Pearl Harbor as part of the &quot;Kidō Butai&quot; (&quot;Mobile Force&quot;). Her aircraft complement consisted of 18 Mitsubishi A6M &quot;Zero&quot; fighters, 27 Aichi D3A &quot;Val&quot; dive bombers, and 27 Nakajima B5N &quot;Kate&quot; torpedo bombers. On 7 December, she launched two waves of aircraft against American military installations on the island of Oahu. In the first wave, 25 Val dive bombers attacked Wheeler Army Airfield and five Zero fighters attacked the airbase at Kaneohe. In the second wave, 27 high-level Kate bombers attacked the airbase at Hickam Field.

On the 24th of December, &quot;Zuikaku&quot; arrived back at Kure alongside &quot;Shōkaku&quot;, , and ( and having previously departed to attack Wake Island), and she was drydocked from the 30th to January 3rd. Meeting &quot;Shōkaku&quot; on the 5th, they departed Hiroshima Bay on the 8th, arriving at Truk on the 14th. In aid of the Japanese conquest against Pacific islands, on January 20 they launched 19 dive bombers and 6 fighters to attack Rabaul, then the next day struck both Lae and Salamaua, and on the 23rd launched strikes to aid the successful landings on both Rabaul and Kavieng before returning to Truk on the 29th. &quot;Zuikaku&quot; finally took part in a failed attempt to sweep for allied aircraft carriers on February 1st before departing back to Japan, arriving at Yokosuka on the 13th, where her pilots took part in vigorous training exercises until the 28th.

=== Indian Ocean Raid ===
&quot;Zuikaku&quot; would play a key role in the Indian Ocean Raid throughout April, where the Kidō Butai (excluding which scraped her hull on a reef) attacked various British warships and positions in a multiple-day raid. On the 5th, &quot;Zuikaku&quot;″s air group attacked Colombo in an event since named the Easter Sunday Raid. Her torpedo bombers sank the destroyer , while her dive bombers damaged the tanker &quot;San Cirilo&quot;. Later that night, alongside the other aircraft carriers, &quot;Zuikaku&quot;″s aircraft engaged and sank the heavy cruisers and . On the 9th, &quot;Zuikaku&quot; and &quot;Shōkaku&quot; raided Trincomalee, where they destroyed the cargo ship and damaged the monitor .

==== Sinking of HMS &quot;Hermes&quot; ====
Later that night, a Japanese floatplane launched from the battleship managed to locate the light carrier , and &quot;Zuikaku&quot;″s air group was the first to respond, quickly followed by &quot;Shōkaku&quot;. Bombers from the pair hit &quot;Hermes&quot; almost 40 times, smashing the carrier into a burning hulk. The pair were then joined by planes from the fellow aircraft carrier , who on her own sank the destroyer . The floating wreck of &quot;Hermes&quot; rapidly sank, having only managed to shoot down six attacking planes.

&quot;Zuikaku,&quot; alongside &quot;Shōkaku,&quot; was the first aircraft carrier in history to sink an enemy aircraft carrier in combat.

=== Battle of the Coral Sea ===
In May 1942, she was assigned along with &quot;Shōkaku&quot; to support Operation Mo, the invasion of Port Moresby, New Guinea. On the 7th, a large US naval force was located by spotters from the heavy cruisers and , prompting both ships to launch their planes, fearing US carriers in the area. However, once attacked, it was discovered to only be a US convoy. Not wanting their efforts to go to waste, planes from both &quot;Zuikaku&quot; and &quot;Shōkaku&quot; combined to sink the destroyer and the oil tanker .

Alerted by intercepted and decrypted Japanese naval messages, the Americans dispatched the carriers and to stop the operation. On the same day as the carrier&#x27;s initial attack, the US planes located the light carrier , which &quot;Lexington&quot;″s aircraft crippled before &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s aircraft finished her off. Both &quot;Zuikaku&quot; and &quot;Shōkaku&quot; sent out plane squadrons to scout for the US carriers, but failed to make contact on the 7th.

On the 8th, a spotter plane from &quot;Lexington&quot; located both &quot;Zuikaku&quot; and &quot;Shōkaku&quot;, and both carriers attacked with their air groups. Hidden by a rain squall, &quot;Zuikaku&quot; escaped detection, but &quot;Shōkaku&quot; was hit three times by bombs and was unable to launch or recover her aircraft. In return, &quot;Zuikaku&quot;″s planes located the American carriers, and proceeded to wreak havoc on both ships. First, &quot;Zuikaku&quot;″s torpedo bombers, commanded by Shigekazu Shimazaki, caught &quot;Lexington&quot; in a pincer attack, hitting the flat top with two torpedoes, cutting her speed to 24 knots and punching through the gasoline storage tanks, leaking gas fumes throughout the ship. Her dive bombers, commanded by Tamotsu Ema, then attacked and crippled &quot;Yorktown&quot; with a bomb hit that caused severe damage to her hangar bay and aviation storage rooms and over a dozen near misses. &quot;Shōkaku&quot;″s dive bombers then hit &quot;Lexington&quot; with three bombs to her flight deck, starting a large fire.

Damage control efforts quickly persisted on &quot;Lexington&quot;, putting out the fires from &quot;Shōkaku&quot;″s bomb hits. However, gas fumes from &quot;Zuikaku&quot;″s torpedo hits leaked throughout the ship. When the fumes reached electric motors, a chain reaction of explosion after explosion riddled &quot;Lexington&quot; with fatal damage. &quot;Lexington&quot; began to sink, as her crew was evacuated. To make sure she hit the ocean floor and wasn&#x27;t captured by Japanese forces, &quot;Lexington&quot; was scuttled by escorting destroyers.

&quot;Zuikaku&quot; was undamaged in the battle, but sustained severe losses in aircraft and aircrew. This required her to return to Japan with her sister ship for resupply and aircrew training, and neither carrier was able to take part in the Battle of Midway in June 1942, where every carrier that participated in the Pearl Harbor attack besides the two &quot;Shōkaku&quot;-class ships was sunk by American carrier-based aircraft. Both ships returned to Kure, &quot;Shōkaku&quot; still operating under her own power despite immense damage. On the 21st, &quot;Zuikaku&quot; was targeted by the submarine , but was not damaged. She spent the rest of June and July transiting to various ports and naval facilities.

===Battle of the Eastern Solomons===
In August 1942, commanded by Captain Tameteru Notomo, &quot;Zuikaku&quot; was dispatched as part of the First Carrier Division along with the repaired &quot;Shōkaku&quot; and their escorts to oppose the American offensive in the Solomon Islands. Their goal was to sink US shipping operating in the Solomons to aid in recapturing Henderson Field, an ex-Japanese air base which was captured by American forces and being used against Japanese shipping to great effect.

On the 24th, a floatplane launched from the heavy cruiser spotted a large American task force, consisting of the aircraft carriers and , and their escorts, battleship , four cruisers, and eleven destroyers. Subsequently, both &quot;Zuikaku&quot; and &quot;Shōkaku&quot; launched 37 aircraft and attacked the US ships. Due to the haste of Japanese pilots, almost all attacks were focused on &quot;Enterprise&quot; to heavy results. The effectiveness of US anti aircraft, particularly of &quot;North Carolina&quot;″s part, shot down many attacking aircraft, but in the end, both carriers crippled &quot;Enterprise&quot; with three bomb hits. They nearly sank her, with a squadron of seven dive bombers, three from &quot;Shōkaku&quot; and four from &quot;Zuikaku&quot;, nearly delivering the final blow when &quot;North Carolina&quot; shot down every single attacking plane.

Neither &quot;Zuikaku&quot; or &quot;Shōkaku&quot; were damaged during the battle, although &quot;Shōkaku&quot; barely avoided being bombed by &quot;Enterprise&quot;. However, together they lost 25 aircraft out of 37 launched, and planes from &quot;Saratoga&quot; sank the light carrier , while planes from Henderson Field sank the destroyer and the troopship &quot;Kinryu Maru&quot;. The battle is considered a US victory as &quot;Zuikaku&quot; and the other Japanese ships retreated without sinking a single American vessel.

=== Battle of Santa Cruz ===
While the US still maintained air superiority through Henderson field, their carrier force was greatly diminished. After her big action, &quot;Saratoga&quot; was crippled by a torpedo fired from the submarine , putting her out of action, while in September the aircraft carrier was sunk by three torpedo hits fired by the submarine . These actions left as the only American fleet carrier operating in the Pacific, shortly joined by the repaired &quot;Enterprise&quot;. Taking advantage of this, &quot;Zuikaku&quot; and &quot;Shōkaku&quot; were sent out to attack the remaining US carriers in a decisive battle, now joined by the aircraft carrier and the light carrier and their escorts. This would culminate in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands.

The force set out on October 11. On the 15th, a Japanese patrol plane spotted the destroyer towing a barge that carried fuel and bombs for US forces at Guadalcanal. &quot;Zuikaku&quot;″s air group quickly responded, and in a ten-minute battle hit &quot;Meredith&quot; with three torpedoes and a number of bombs, causing the destroyer to roll over and sink. The force continued on, and on the 26th was spotted by a Catalina seaplane, shortly followed by the attacks of both &quot;Hornet&quot; and &quot;Enterprise&quot;, just as the Japanese wanted. Dive bombers from &quot;Enterprise&quot; hit &quot;Zuihō&quot; with a bomb that prevented her from recovering aircraft, while dive bombers from &quot;Hornet&quot; scorched &quot;Shōkaku&quot; with at least 3–4 (and potentially up to 6) bomb hits and damaged the heavy cruiser &quot;Chikuma&quot; with two bombs.

In return, the Japanese planes wreaked havoc on American shipping. Fighters from &quot;Zuihō&quot; shot down an American torpedo bomber, which in a bamboozling series of events launched its torpedo as it crashed in a friendly fire incident that sank the destroyer , while &quot;Jun&#x27;yō&quot; damaged the battleship and the light cruiser with bomb hits. &quot;Zuikaku&quot; focused her attacks on &quot;Hornet&quot;, and hit her with three bombs. Two of her bombers that were shot down proceeded to crash into &quot;Hornet&quot;, one of which still had its bomb equipped which exploded on impact. Meanwhile, planes from &quot;Shōkaku&quot; hit &quot;Hornet&quot; with two torpedoes. The damage from both ships left Hornet dead in the water and heavily listing.

Under tow from the heavy cruiser , damage control efforts attempted to correct the list on the crippled, but not sunk &quot;Hornet&quot; in an attempt to save the ship. However, further air attacks persisted. A flight of nine torpedo bombers from both &quot;Shōkaku&quot; and &quot;Jun&#x27;yō&quot; attacked the flat top, and while &quot;Jun&#x27;yō&quot;″s planes missed, &quot;Shōkaku&quot; hit &quot;Hornet&quot; with a third and fatal torpedo which caused the US to abandon all efforts to save &quot;Hornet&quot;.

&quot;Zuikaku&quot; hit &quot;Hornet&quot; with another bomb while US destroyers attempted to scuttle &quot;Hornet&quot; (though due to the quality of US torpedoes, all either missed or failed to explode). &quot;Hornet&quot; slowly sank, and was listing at a 45-degree angle when she was discovered by the destroyers and . They fired their torpedoes, claiming three hits. Because of this, they are sometimes credited with sinking &quot;Hornet&quot;, but she was already sinking due to damage from the previous air attacks, and would have sunk regardless of any further damage, meaning it&#x27;s debatable whether they deserve credit for &quot;Hornet&quot;″s sinking as opposed to the carrier&#x27;s loss being pinned solely on the &quot;Shōkaku&quot; twins.

Of the 110 aircraft launched by the Japanese carriers, only 67 returned to &quot;Zuikaku&quot;. She then returned to the home islands via Truk for training and aircraft ferrying duties.

In February 1943, she covered the evacuation of Japanese ground forces from Guadalcanal. In May, she was assigned to a mission to counterattack the American offensive in the Aleutian Islands, but this operation was cancelled after the Allied victory on Attu on 29 May 1943. Later in 1943, under the command of Captain Kikuchi Tomozo, she was again based at Truk and operated against U.S. forces in the Marshall Islands, but never managed to see combat throughout the rest of the year.

&quot;Zuikaku&quot; started off 1944 by entering drydock at Kure on January 8, and leaving drydock on the 17th. On February 13, &quot;Zuikaku&quot; was assigned to carrier division 1 alongside &quot;Shōkaku&quot;, and over 2 days received her air group, but her new pilots were poorly trained and inexperienced, a grand fall from the glory days of the Kidō Butai. However, they were sufficient to score &quot;Zuikaku&quot; another kill when on 27 February, her torpedo bombers hunted down the submarine and quickly sank her with a single 250-kilogram (551 lb) bomb hit. After ferrying aircraft to Singapore and being drydocked, she joined &quot;Shōkaku&quot; and the new armored aircraft carrier .

===Battle of the Philippine Sea===
In June she was assigned to Operation A-Go, an attempt to repulse the Allied invasion of the Mariana Islands. On 19 June, in the Battle of the Philippine Sea, &quot;Taihō&quot; and &quot;Shōkaku&quot; were both sunk by American submarines, leaving &quot;Zuikaku&quot;, the only survivor of Carrier Division One, to recover the Division&#x27;s few remaining aircraft. On 20 June, a bomb hit started a fire in the hangar, but &quot;Zuikaku&quot;″s experienced damage control teams managed to get it under control, and she was able to escape under her own power. After this battle, &quot;Zuikaku&quot; was the only survivor of the six fleet carriers that had launched the attack on Pearl Harbor.

===Battle off Cape Engaño===

In October 1944, she was the flagship of Admiral Jisaburo Ozawa&#x27;s decoy Northern Force in Operation Shō-Gō 1, the Japanese counterattack to the Allied landings on Leyte. On 24 October, as part of the depleted Third Carrier Division, which had just 108 aircraft across four carriers, she launched aircraft along with the light carriers , , and in an ineffective strike against the U.S. Third Fleet. Several of these aircraft were shot down, and the majority of the surviving aircraft did not return to the carriers, instead landing at Japanese land bases on Luzon. However, some of her aircraft made &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks and helped sink the light carrier ; and most of the others were sent to other surviving carriers and air bases, to later sink the escort carrier during the Battle off Samar after again using the new &quot;kamikaze&quot; tactics.

The next day, during the Battle off Cape Engaño, she launched her few remaining aircraft for combat air patrol, search, or to join the aircraft already on Luzon. She then came under heavy air attack and was hit by seven torpedoes and nine bombs. With &quot;Zuikaku&quot; listing heavily to port, Ozawa shifted his flag to the light cruiser . The order to abandon ship was issued at 13:58 and the naval ensign was lowered. &quot;Zuikaku&quot; rolled over and sank stern-first at 14:14, taking the lives of Rear Admiral (promoted from captain 10 days earlier) Kaizuka Takeo and 842 of the ship&#x27;s crew; 862 officers and men were rescued by the destroyers and . Before her loss, &quot;Zuikaku&quot; was the last surviving Japanese carrier to have attacked Pearl Harbor. She was also the only Japanese fleet carrier (as opposed to a light carrier) to have been sunk by aircraft-launched torpedoes, as all others were sunk by bombs delivered by dive bombers or submarine-launched torpedoes.

<doc id="65572" wikidata="Q1026385" url="?curid=65572" title="Calcutta auction">
<text>A Calcutta auction is an open auction held in conjunction with a golf tournament, horse race or similar contest with multiple entrants. It is popular in backgammon, the Melbourne Cup, and college basketball pools during March Madness. Culcutta auction is a sequential auction, where the bidding for each contestant begins in random order, with only one contestant being bid upon at any time. Accordingly, participants (originally in Calcutta, India, from where this technique was first recorded by the Colonial British) bid among themselves to &quot;buy&quot; each of the contestants, with each contestant being assigned to the highest bidder. The contestant will then pay out to the owner a predetermined proportion of the pool depending on how it performs in the tournament.

While variations in payoff schedules exist, in an NCAA Basketball tournament (64 teams, single elimination, maximum six wins) the payoffs could be:

The precise rules of a Calcutta can vary from place to place; many tournament organizers employ software programs that apply odds and determine win-place-show amounts. Perhaps the simplest and most common Calcutta payout is 70 percent of the pool to the &quot;owner&quot; of the winning tournament team, 30 percent to the &quot;owner&quot; of the second-place tournament team.

An interesting element of Calcutta auctions is in determining an appropriate wager for each contestant, as the payoff will directly hinge on the size of the pot and thereby the size of the bids being placed. Thus the value of each team fluctuates during the course of the betting. For example, even if a bidder knew the University of North Carolina would be the tournament winner and thus pay out 32% of the pool, he would still be unsure of the exact value of the team (unless it was the last team being bid on) since the payout depends on the sum total of all winning bids, i.e. the final size of the pool.

Another typical variation in NCAA Calcutta auctions is the bundling and auctioning off as a block the lowest seeded teams in each region, called the &quot;Dogs&quot;. For example, the 16th to 13th seeded teams from the Midwest Region would be bid upon as a bundle named the &quot;Dogs of the Midwest&quot;. The winning bidder would own all 4 teams and usually recoups his or her investment if one or two of the Dogs wins an upset.

This is similar to parimutuel betting, in that the winnings are awarded from the total pool of bets, but differs in that only one player can bet on any one contestant. However, a player may purchase as many contestants as they desire.

One variation that has grown as the Calcutta auction is used more in conjunction with March Madness involves auctioning teams off in the reverse order of their seeds instead of random order. As bidding evolves, this aids bidders in estimating the final pot size since the heavily favored teams that command the highest bids are auctioned at the end, thereby limiting the risk on the larger bets.

A Calcutta golf tournament is seen in the 1967 film &quot;Banning&quot;.

<text>Shu Qingchun (3 February 189924 August 1966), known by his pen name Lao She, was a Chinese novelist and dramatist. He was a writer of 20th-century Chinese literature, known for his novel &quot;Rickshaw Boy&quot; and the play &quot;Teahouse&quot; (茶馆). He was of Manchu ethnicity, and his works are known for their vivid use of the Beijing dialect.

Lao She was a writer whose life span covered all stages of modern China: the Qing dynasty, the Republic and the Communists.

Lao She was greatly influenced by the writer Charles Dickens. Born during the end of the Qing dynasty, Lao She was from the Manchu Sumuru clan and experienced the Boxer Rebellion first hand as well as the atrocities committed by the Eight-Nation Alliance, a scarring experience for him. During the Cultural Revolution, Shu was tortured by the Red Guards, causing him to become insane. Shu either died by drowning himself or was murdered.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Lao She was born Shu Qingchun (舒慶春) on 3 February 1899 in Beijing, to a poor Manchu family of the Šumuru clan belonging to the Plain Red Banner. His father, who was a guard soldier, died in a street battle with the Eight-Nation Alliance Forces in the course of the Boxer Rebellion events in 1901. &quot;During my childhood,&quot; Lao She later recalled, &quot;I didn&#x27;t need to hear stories about evil ogres eating children and so forth; the foreign devils my mother told me about were more barbaric and cruel than any fairy tale ogre with a huge mouth and great fangs. And fairy tales are only fairy tales, whereas my mother&#x27;s stories were 100 percent factual, and they directly affected our whole family.&quot; In 1913, he was admitted to the Beijing Normal Third High School (now Beijing Third High School), but had to leave after several months because of financial difficulties. In the same year, he was accepted to Beijing Normal University, from which he graduated in 1918.

===Career===
Between 1918 and 1924, Lao She was involved as administrator and faculty member at a number of primary and secondary schools in Beijing and Tianjin. He was highly influenced by the May Fourth Movement (1919). He stated, &quot;The May Fourth Movement gave me a new spirit and a new literary language. I am grateful to the May Fourth Movement, as it allowed me to become a writer.&quot;

He went on to serve as lecturer in the Chinese section of the School of Oriental Studies (now the School of Oriental and African Studies) at the University of London from 1924 to 1929, living in Notting Hill for most of that period. During his time in London, he absorbed a great deal of English literature (especially Dickens, whom he adored) and began his own writing. His later novel &quot;Mr Ma and Son&quot;, about a Chinese father and his son in London, drew on these experiences. Up until that time, he had signed his works with his courtesy name She Yu (舍予). In his first novel &quot;Old Zhang&#x27;s Philosophy&quot; (老张的哲学 &quot;Lao Zhang de Zhexue&quot;), first published on Fiction Monthly, he first adopted the pen name Lao She. 

In the summer of 1929, he left Britain for Singapore, teaching at the Chinese High School. Between his return to China in the spring of 1930 until 1937, he taught at several universities, including Cheeloo University until 1934, and Shandong University (Qingdao).

Lao She was a major popularizer of humor in China, especially through his novels, his short stories and essays for journals like Lin Yutang&#x27;s &quot;The Analects Fortnightly&quot; (論語半月刊, &quot;Lunyu Banyuekan&quot;, est. 1932), and his stage plays and other performing arts, notably xiangsheng.

On 27 March 1938, The All-China Resistance Association of Writers and Artists was established with Lao She as its leader. The purpose of this organization was to unite cultural workers against the Japanese, and Lao She was a respected novelist who had remained neutral during the ideological discussions between various literary groups in the preceding years.

In March 1946, Lao She travelled to the United States on a two-year cultural grant sponsored by the State Department, lecturing and overseeing the translation of several of his novels, including &quot;The Yellow Storm&quot; (1951) and his last novel, &quot;The Drum Singers&quot; (1952; its Chinese version was not published until 1980). He stayed in the US from 1946 until December 1949. During Lao She&#x27;s traveling, his friend, Pearl S. Buck, and her husband, had served as sponsors and they helped Lao She live in the U.S. After the People&#x27;s Republic of China was established, Lao She rejected Buck&#x27;s advice to stay in America and came back to China. &quot;Rickshaw Boy&quot; was translated by Buck in the early 1940s. This action helped Rickshaw Boy become a best seller book in America.

===Marriage and family===

In 1930, Hu Jieqing was studying at Beijing Normal University. Hu&#x27;s mother was afraid that she would delay marriage and having children because of her studies. Linguist Luo Changpei was acquainted with Hu Jieqing&#x27;s brothers. Once, Lao She went to Hu&#x27;s house to play, and Hu Mu asked him to play hide and seek. At this time, Lao She happened to be returning from London, and he had written works, so Luo Changpei introduced Lao She to Hu Mu. After learning about Lao She&#x27;s talent and character, Hu Mu was extremely happy and privately appointed Lao She the son-in-law of Chenglong. Luo discussed together a detailed plan for Lao She and Hu Jieqing to meet. In the winter of 1930, Lao She returned to Peiping. Under Luo&#x27;s arrangement, Lao She was dragged by friends everywhere to eat, and there was always Hu Jieqing at the dinner table. After frequent meetings, Hu and Lao developed affection. In the summer of 1931 that Hu Jieqing graduated, and the two held a wedding. Half a month after the marriage, Lao She brought his wife to Jinan and continued to teach at the university, while Hu Jieqing taught in a middle school. The first child of the two was born in Jinan, a girl named Shu Ji. In 1935, the second child, son Shu Yi was born. In 1937, she gave birth to his third child in Chongqing, named Shu Yu. In 1945, the young girl Shu Li was born.

===Death===
Like numerous other intellectuals in China, Lao She experienced mistreatment when the Cultural Revolution began in 1966. Condemned as a counterrevolutionary, he was paraded and struggled by the Red Guards through the streets and beaten publicly at the door steps of the Temple of Confucius in Beijing. According to the official record, this abuse left Lao She greatly humiliated both mentally and physically, and he committed suicide by drowning himself in Beijing&#x27;s Taiping Lake on 24 August 1966. Leo Ou-fan Lee mentioned the possibility that Lao She was murdered. However, no reliable information has emerged to verify definitively the actual circumstances of Lao&#x27;s death. His relatives were accused of implication in his &quot;crimes&quot;, but rescued his manuscripts after his death, hiding them in coal piles and a chimney and moving them from house to house.

==Works==
Lao She&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The Philosophy of Lao Zhang&quot; was written in London (1926) and modeled on Dickens&#x27; &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot;, but is set among students in Beijing. His second novel, &quot;Zhao Ziyue&quot; (1927) is set in the same Beijing milieu, but tells the story of a 26-year-old college student&#x27;s quest for the trappings of fame in a corrupt bureaucracy. Both &quot;The Philosophy of Lao Zhang&quot; and &quot;Zhao Ziyue&quot; were Lao She&#x27;s novels which expressed the native Peking lives and memories. He also wrote &quot;Crescent Moon&quot; (), written in the early stage of his creative life. It depicts the miserable life of a mother and daughter and their deterioration into prostitution.

=== &quot;Mr Ma and Son&quot; ===

&quot;Mr. Ma and Son&quot; showed another writing style for Lao She. He described Mr. Ma and his son&#x27;s life in London Chinatown, showing the poor situation of Chinese people in London. These were praised as reflecting Chinese students&#x27; experiences. Lao She used funny words to show cruel social truths. From &quot;Mr. Ma and Son&quot;, Lao She pointed the stereotype included appearances and spirits and he hoped to get rid of these dirty impressions.

===&quot;Cat Country&quot; ===

&quot;Cat Country&quot; is a satirical fable, sometimes seen as a Chinese science fiction novel, published in 1932 as a thinly veiled observation on China. Lao She wrote it from the perspective of a visitor to the planet Mars. The visitor encountered an ancient civilisation populated by cat-people. The civilisation had long passed its glorious peak and had undergone prolonged stagnation. The visitor observed the various responses of its citizens to the innovations by other cultures. Lao She wrote &quot;Cat Country&quot; in direct response to Japan&#x27;s invasion of China (Manchuria in 1931 and Shanghai in 1932). Paradoxically, &quot;Cat Country&quot; has been considered as an artistic failure by the author himself.

===&quot;Rickshaw Boy&quot; ===
His novel &quot;Rickshaw Boy&quot; (also known in the West as &quot;Camel Xiangzi&quot; or &quot;Rickshaw&quot;) was published in 1936. It describes the tragic life of a rickshaw-puller in Beijing of the 1920s, and revealed the tragedy of lower classes at that time through the narration of the rickshaw boy&#x27;s story. Xiangzi is a stereotype of a social phenomenon: a peasant coming to the city and then turning to an urban tramp, experiencing spiritual crises of all kinds. Not only a problem of particular historical period, it is an all-pervasive one that persists throughout Chinese history. Reading the novel today reveals more about the contemporary Chinese society than the text itself. It is considered to be a classic of modern Chinese literature and a contribution to the genre of world literature about laborers. Moreover, it was translated into English and sold in the USA. In 1945, an unauthorized translation that added a bowdlerized happy ending to the story was published and sold. In 1982, the original version was made into a film of the same title.

=== &quot;Teahouse&quot;===
&quot;Teahouse&quot; is a play in three acts, set in a teahouse called &quot;Yu Tai&quot; in Beijing from 1898 until the eve of the 1949 revolution. First published in 1957, the play is a social and cultural commentary on the problems, culture, and changes within China during the early twentieth century. It has been translated into many different languages.

=== Promotion of Baihua (National Language) ===
Lao She advocated the use of Baihua or plain language in written Chinese. Baihua evolved a new language from classic Chinese during the May Fourth Movement. As the All-China League of Resistance Writers leader, he found he needed to abandon the use of classical Chinese for a more accessible modern style. Lao She was an early user of Baihua, and other writers and artists also adopted Baihua. Modern written Chinese is largely in the plain Baihua style.

=== Treasure Boat ===
&quot;Treasure Boat&quot; was written by Lao She in 1961. It was the only children&#x27;s opera he wrote.

== Article style ==
Lao She&#x27;s writing was known for its humor and irony, being simple but deep. He wrote humorous, satiric novels and short stories and, after the onset of the Sino-Japanese War (1937–45), patriotic and propagandistic plays and novels.

==Legacy==
After the end of the Cultural Revolution, Lao She was posthumously &quot;rehabilitated&quot; in 1978 and his works were republished. Several of his stories have been made into films, including &quot;This Life of Mine&quot; (1950, dir. by Shi Hui), &quot;Dragon Beard Ditch&quot; (1952, dir. by Xian Qun), &quot;Rickshaw Boy&quot; (1982, dir. by Ling Zifeng), &quot;The Teahouse&quot; (1982, dir. by Xie Tian), &quot;The Crescent Moon&quot; (1986, dir. by Huo Zhuang), &quot;The Drum Singers&quot; (1987, dir. by Tian Zhuangzhuang), and &quot;The Divorce&quot; (1992, dir. by Wang Hao-wei). Tian Zhuangzhuang&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;The Drum Singers&quot;, also known as &quot;Street Players&quot;, was mostly shot on location in Sichuan. Some of Lao She&#x27;s plays have also been staged in the recent past, including &quot;Beneath the Red Banner&quot; in 2000 in Shanghai, and &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Beard Ditch&quot; in 2009 in Beijing as part of the celebration of the writer&#x27;s 110th birthday.

Lao She&#x27;s former home in Beijing is preserved as the Lao She Memorial Hall, opened to the public as a museum of the writer&#x27;s work and life in 1999. Originally purchased in 1950, when it was 10 Fengsheng Lane, Naicifu, the address of the traditional courtyard house is now 19 Fengfu Lane. It is close to Wangfujing, in Dongcheng District. Lao She lived there until his death 16 years later. The courtyard contains persimmon trees planted by the writer. His wife called the house &#x27;Red Persimmon Courtyard&#x27;.

The Lao She Literary Award has been given every two to three years starting in the year 2000. It is sponsored by the Lao She Literature Fund and can only be bestowed on Beijing writers.

The Laoshe Tea House, a tourist attraction in Beijing that opened in 1988 and features regular performances of traditional music, is named after Lao She, but features primarily tourist-oriented attractions.

== Three-self principles ==
As a philosophy, the three-self principles survived in China. The People&#x27;s Republic of China expelled all foreign missionaries in 1950, and in 1954 forced the Protestant churches to merge into a single body, the Three-Self Patriotic Movement of Protestant Churches in China, and break ties with foreign money, influence, and leadership. Critics charged that the movement was actually designed to train leaders in patriotism and to facilitate communication between the government and the Christian community. In 1966, as the Cultural Revolution began, public Christian worship was banned, and the Three-self Movement was disbanded. It was reorganized in 1980. Its main role is to articulate new government policies regarding religion. On a more positive note, it has helped foster the sense that the contemporary Chinese Protestant church is an indigenous body and no longer a branch of a foreign institution.

Lao She&#x27;s work revealed the language, the joys, and the pains of the common people of China. He believed his country and its Christianity needed to be sinicized and not dependent upon the foreigner for funds and direction.

<text>The M4 Sherman, officially medium tank, M4, was the medium tank most widely used by the United States and Western Allies in World War II. The M4 Sherman proved to be reliable, relatively cheap to produce, and available in great numbers. It was also the basis of several other armored fighting vehicles including self-propelled artillery, tank destroyers, and armored recovery vehicles. Tens of thousands were distributed through the Lend-Lease program to the British Commonwealth, Soviet Union, and other Allied Nations. The tank was named by the British after the American Civil War General William Tecumseh Sherman.

The M4 Sherman tank evolved from the M3 Lee, a medium tank developed by the United States during the early years of World War II. The M3, also known by its service names &quot;Grant&quot; and &quot;Lee,&quot; was characterized by a unique design that featured the main armament mounted in a side sponson. The Grant variant, used by British forces, employed a lower-profile turret based on British designs, while the Lee variant, used by the United States, retained the original American turret design. Despite the M3&#x27;s effectiveness, the tank&#x27;s unconventional layout and the limitations of its hull-mounted gun prompted the need for a more efficient and versatile design, leading to the development of the M4 Sherman.

The M4 Sherman retained much of the mechanical design of the M3, but it addressed several shortcomings and incorporated improvements in mobility, firepower, and ergonomics. One of the most significant changes was the relocation of the main armament—initially a 75 mm gun—into a fully traversing turret located at the center of the vehicle. This design allowed for more flexible and accurate fire control, enabling the crew to engage targets with greater precision than was possible on the M3. Additionally, the M4 featured a one-axis gyrostabilizer, which, while not precise enough to allow for accurate firing while in motion, helped keep the gun roughly aimed in the direction of the target when the tank came to a stop. This feature proved useful in ensuring the tank could quickly take aim after halting to fire, enhancing its effectiveness in combat. However, by modern standards, this system was relatively rudimentary compared to more advanced stabilizers.

The development of the M4 Sherman emphasized key factors such as reliability, ease of production, and standardization. The U.S. Army and the designers prioritized durability and maintenance ease, which ensured the tank could be quickly repaired in the field. A critical aspect of the design process was the standardization of parts, allowing for streamlined production and the efficient supply of replacement components. Additionally, the tank&#x27;s size and weight were kept within moderate limits, which facilitated easier shipping and compatibility with existing logistical and engineering equipment, including bridges and transport vehicles. These design principles were essential for meeting the demands of mass production and quick deployment.

The M4 Sherman was designed to be more versatile and easier to produce than previous models, which proved vital as the United States entered World War II. It became the most-produced American tank of the conflict, with a total of 49,324 units built, including various specialized variants. Its production volume surpassed that of any other American tank, and it played a pivotal role in the success of the Allied forces. In terms of tank production, the only World War II-era tank to exceed the M4&#x27;s production numbers was the Soviet T-34, with approximately 84,070 units built.

On the battlefield, the Sherman was particularly effective against German light and medium tanks during the early stages of the war. Its 75 mm gun and relatively superior armor provided an edge over the tanks fielded by Nazi Germany during this period. The M4 Sherman saw widespread use across various theaters of combat, including North Africa, Italy, and Western Europe. It was instrumental in the success of several Allied offensives, particularly after 1942, when the Allies began to gain momentum following the Allied landings in North Africa (Operation Torch) and the subsequent campaigns in Italy and France. The ability to produce the Sherman in large numbers, combined with its operational flexibility and effectiveness, made it a key component of the Allied war effort.

The Sherman&#x27;s role as the backbone of U.S. armored forces in World War II cemented its legacy as one of the most influential tank designs of the 20th century. Despite its limitations—such as relatively thin armor compared to German heavy tanks like the Tiger and Panther—the M4 was designed to be both affordable and adaptable. Its widespread deployment, durability, and ease of maintenance ensured it remained in service throughout the war, and it continued to see action even in the years following World War II in various conflicts and regions. The M4 Sherman remains one of the most iconic tanks in military history, symbolizing the industrial might and innovation of the United States during the war.

When the M4 tank went into combat in North Africa with the British Army at the Second Battle of El Alamein in late 1942, it increased the advantage of Allied armor over Axis armor and was superior to the lighter German and Italian tank designs. For this reason, the US Army believed that the M4 would be adequate to win the war, and relatively little pressure was initially applied for further tank development. Logistical and transport restrictions, such as limitations imposed by roads, ports, and bridges, also complicated the introduction of a more capable but heavier tank. Tank destroyer battalions using vehicles built on the M4 hull and chassis, but with open-topped turrets and more potent high-velocity guns, also entered widespread use in the Allied armies. Even by 1944, most M4 Shermans kept their dual-purpose 75 mm gun. By then, the M4 was inferior in firepower and armor to increasing numbers of German upgraded medium tanks and heavy tanks but was able to fight on with the help of considerable numerical superiority, greater mechanical reliability, better logistical support, and support from growing numbers of fighter-bombers and artillery pieces. Later in the war, a more effective armor-piercing gun, the 76 mm gun M1, was incorporated into production vehicles. For anti-tank work, the British refitted Shermans with a 76.2 mm Ordnance QF 17-pounder gun (as the Sherman Firefly). Some were fitted with a 105 mm howitzer to act as infantry support vehicles.

The relative ease of production allowed large numbers of the M4 to be manufactured, and significant investment in tank recovery and repair units allowed disabled vehicles to be repaired and returned to service quickly. These factors combined to give the Allies numerical superiority in most battles, and many infantry divisions were provided with M4s and tank destroyers. By 1944, a typical U.S. infantry division had attached for armor support an M4 Sherman battalion, a tank destroyer battalion, or both.

After World War II, the Sherman, particularly the many improved and upgraded versions, continued to see combat service in many conflicts around the world, including the UN forces in the Korean War, with Israel in the Arab–Israeli wars, briefly with South Vietnam in the Vietnam War, and on both sides of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965.

==U.S. design prototype==
The United States Army Ordnance Department designed the M4 medium tank as a replacement for the M3 medium tank. The M3 was an up-gunned development of the M2 medium tank of 1939, in turn, derived from the M2 light tank of 1935. The M3 was developed as a stopgap measure until a new turret mounting a 75 mm gun could be devised. While it was a big improvement when used by the British in Africa against German forces, the placement of a 37 mm gun turret on top gave it a very high profile, and the unusual side-sponson mounted main gun, with limited traverse, could not be aimed across the other side of the tank. Though reluctant to adopt British weapons into their arsenal, the American designers were prepared to accept proven British ideas. These ideas, as embodied in a tank designed by the Canadian General Staff, also influenced the development of the American Sherman tank. Before long American military agencies and designers had accumulated sufficient experience to forge ahead on several points. In the field of tank armament, the American 75 mm and 76 mm dual-purpose tank guns won the acknowledgment of British tank experts. Detailed design characteristics for the M4 was submitted by the Ordnance Department on 31 August 1940, but the development of a prototype was delayed while the final production designs of the M3 were finished and the M3 entered full-scale production. On 18 April 1941, the U.S. Armored Force Board chose the simplest of five designs. Known as the T6, the design was a modified M3 hull and chassis, carrying a newly designed turret mounting the M3&#x27;s 75 mm gun. This would later become the Sherman.

The Sherman&#x27;s reliability resulted from many features developed for U.S. light tanks during the 1930s, including vertical volute spring suspension, rubber-bushed tracks, and a rear-mounted radial engine with drive sprockets in front. The goals were to produce a fast, dependable medium tank able to support infantry, provide breakthrough striking capacity, and defeat any tank then in use by the Axis nations.

The T6 prototype was completed on 2 September 1941. The upper hull of the T6 was a single large casting. It featured a single overhead hatch for the driver and a hatch in the side of the hull. In the later M4A1 production model, this large casting was maintained, although the side hatch was eliminated, and a second overhead hatch was added for the assistant driver. The modified T6 was standardized as the M4, and first production completed in February 1942. The cast-hull models would later be re-standardized as M4A1, with the first welded-hull models receiving the designation M4. In August 1942, a variant of the M4 was put forth by the Detroit Arsenal to have angled, rather than rounded hull and turret armor. The changes were intended to improve the tank&#x27;s protection without increasing weight or degrading other technical characteristics.

===Doctrine===
As the United States approached entry into World War II, armored employment was doctrinally governed by Field Manual 100–5, Operations (published May 1941, the month following selection of the M4 tank&#x27;s final design). That field manual stated:
The M4 was, therefore, not originally intended primarily as an infantry support tank. It placed tanks in the &quot;striking echelon&quot; of the armored division and placed the infantry in the &quot;support echelon&quot;, without directing that tanks should only seek to attack other tanks, thus leaving target selection up to the field commander based on what types of units were available to him to attack. A field manual covering the use of the Sherman (FM 17–33, &quot;The Tank Battalion, Light and Medium&quot; of September 1942) described fighting enemy tanks, when necessary, as one of the many roles of the Sherman, but devoted only one page of text and four diagrams to tank-versus-tank action out of 142 pages. This early armored doctrine was heavily influenced by the sweeping early war successes of German blitzkrieg tactics. By the time M4s reached combat in significant numbers, battlefield demands for infantry support and tank-versus-tank action far outnumbered the occasional opportunities of rear-echelon exploitation.

United States doctrine held that the most critical anti-tank work stopping massed enemy tank attacks was primarily to be done by towed and self-propelled anti-tank guns, operated by &quot;Tank Destroyer&quot; battalions, with friendly tanks being used in support if possible. Speed was essential to bring the tank destroyers from the rear to destroy incoming tanks. This doctrine was rarely followed in combat, as it was found to be impractical. Commanders were reluctant to leave tank destroyers in reserve; if they were, it was also easier for an opposing armored force to achieve a breakthrough against an American tank battalion, which would not have all of its anti-tank weapons at the front during the beginning of any attack.

==U.S. production history==

The first production of the Sherman took place at the Lima Locomotive Works and was first used in 1941, with many early vehicles reserved for British use under Lend-Lease; the first production Sherman was given to the U.S. Army for evaluation, and the second tank of the British order went to London. Nicknamed &quot;Michael&quot;, probably after Michael Dewar, head of the British tank mission in the U.S., the tank was displayed in London and is now an exhibit at The Tank Museum, Bovington, UK.

In World War II, the U.S. Army ultimately fielded 16 armored divisions, along with 70 separate tank battalions, while the U.S. Marine Corps fielded six tank battalions. A third of all Army tank battalions, and all six Marine tank battalions, were deployed to the Pacific Theater of Operations (PTO). Before September 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt had announced a production program calling for 120,000 tanks for the Allied war effort. Although the American industrial complex was not affected by enemy aerial bombing or submarine warfare as was Japan, Germany and, to a lesser degree, Great Britain, an enormous amount of steel for tank production was diverted to the construction of warships and other naval vessels. Steel used in naval construction amounted to the equivalent of approximately 67,000 tanks; and consequently, only about 53,500 tanks were produced during 1942 and 1943.

The Army had seven main sub-designations for M4 variants during production: M4, M4A1, M4A2, M4A3, M4A4, M4A5, and M4A6. These designations did not necessarily indicate linear improvement; in that &quot;M4A4&quot; did not indicate it was better than &quot;M4A3&quot;. These sub-types indicated standardized production variations, which were often manufactured concurrently at different locations. The sub-types differed mainly in engines, although the M4A1 differed from the other variants by its fully cast upper hull, with a distinctive rounded appearance. The M4A4 had a longer engine that required a longer hull and more track blocks, and thus the most distinguishing feature of the M4A4 was the wider longitudinal spacing between the bogies. &quot;M4A5&quot; was an administrative placeholder designation for Canadian Ram tank. The M4A6 had a radial diesel engine as well as the elongated chassis of the M4A4, but only 75 of these were ever produced.

Most Sherman sub-types ran on gasoline. The air-cooled Continental-produced Wright R-975 Whirlwind 9-cylinder radial gasoline engine in the M4 and M4A1 produced . The M4A3 used the liquid-cooled Ford GAA V8 gasoline engine, and the M4A4 used the liquid-cooled 30 cylinder Chrysler A57 multibank gasoline engine. There were also two diesel-engined variants. The M4A2 was powered by a pair of liquid-cooled GMC Detroit Diesel 6–71 two-stroke inline engines, that produced a total of , while the M4A6 used an RD-1820 (a redesigned Caterpillar D-200A air-cooled radial diesel engine, adapted from Wright Aeronautical&#x27;s Wright R-1820 &quot;Cyclone 9&quot; nine-cylinder radial aircraft engine.) that produced . A 24-volt electrical system was used in the M4. The M4A2 and M4A4 were mostly supplied to other Allied countries under Lend-Lease.
The term &quot;M4&quot; can refer specifically to the initial sub-type with its Continental radial engine, or generically, to the entire family of seven Sherman sub-types, depending on context. Many details of production, shape, strength, and performance improved while in production, without a change to the tank&#x27;s basic model number. These included stronger suspension units, safer &quot;wet&quot; (W) ammunition stowage, and stronger or more effective armor arrangements, such as the M4 &quot;Composite&quot;, which had a cheaper to produce cast front hull section mated to a regular welded rear hull. British nomenclature for Shermans was by mark numbers for the different hulls with letters for differences in armament and suspension: &quot;A&quot; for a vehicle with the 76 mm gun, &quot;B&quot; for the 105 mm howitzer, &quot;C&quot; for the 17-pounder gun, and &quot;Y&quot; for any vehicle equipped with horizontal volute spring suspension (HVSS), e.g. British operated M4A1(76) was known as Sherman IIA.


Early Shermans mounted a 75 mm medium-velocity general-purpose gun. Although Ordnance began work on the T20/22/23 series as Sherman replacements, the Army Ground Forces were satisfied with the M4 and Armored Force Board considered some features of the experimental tanks unsatisfactory. Continuing with M4 minimized production disruption but elements of the experimental designs were incorporated into the Sherman. Later M4A1, M4A2, and M4A3 models received the larger turret with high velocity 76 mm gun trialed on the T23 tank. The first standard-production 76 mm gun-armed Sherman was an M4A1, accepted in January 1944, which first saw combat in July 1944 during Operation Cobra. Variants of the M4 and M4A3 were factory-produced with a 105 mm howitzer and a distinctive rounded gun mantlet, which surrounded the main gun, on the turret. The first Sherman variant to be armed with the 105 mm howitzer was the M4, first accepted in February 1944.
From May to July 1944, the Army accepted a limited run of 254 M4A3E2 &quot;Jumbo&quot; Shermans, which had very thick hull armor and the 75 mm gun in a new, better-protected T23-style turret (&quot;Jumbos&quot; could mount the 76 mm M1 cannon), to assault fortifications, leading convoys, and spearhead armored columns. The M4A3 model was the first to be factory-produced with the HVSS system with wider tracks to distribute weight, beginning in August 1944. With the smooth ride of the HVSS, it gained the nickname &quot;Easy Eight&quot; from its experimental &quot;E8&quot; designation. The M4 and M4A3 105 mm-armed tanks, as well as the M4A1 and M4A2 76 mm-armed tanks, were also eventually equipped with HVSS. Both the Americans and the British developed a wide array of special attachments for the Sherman, although few saw combat, remaining experimental. Those that saw action included a bulldozer blade, the Duplex Drive system, flamethrowers for &quot;Zippo&quot; flame tanks, and various rocket launchers such as the T34 Calliope. British variants (DDs and mine flails) formed part of the group of specialized vehicles collectively known as &quot;Hobart&#x27;s Funnies&quot; (after Percy Hobart, commander of the 79th Armoured Division).

The M4 Sherman&#x27;s basic chassis was used for all the sundry roles of a modern mechanized force. These included the M10 and M36 tank destroyers; M7B1, M12, M40, and M43 self-propelled artillery; the M32 and M74 &quot;tow truck&quot;-style recovery tanks with winches, booms, and an 81 mm mortar for smoke screens; and the M34 (from M32B1) and M35 (from M10A1) artillery prime movers.

==Service history==
===Allocation===

During World War II, approximately 19,247 Shermans were issued to the U.S. Army and about 1,114 to the U.S. Marine Corps. The U.S. also supplied 17,184 to United Kingdom (some of which in turn went to the Canadians and the Free Poles), while the Soviet Union received 4,102 and an estimated 812 were transferred to China. These numbers were distributed further to the respective countries&#x27; allied nations.

The U.S. Marine Corps used the diesel M4A2 and gasoline powered M4A3 in the Pacific. However, the Chief of the Army&#x27;s Armored Force, Lt. Gen. Jacob L. Devers, ordered that no diesel-engined Shermans be used by the Army outside the Zone of Interior (the continental U.S.). The Army used all types for either training or testing within the United States but intended the M4A2 and M4A4 (with the A57 Multibank engine) to be the primary Lend-Lease exports.

===First combat===

Shermans were being issued in small numbers for familiarization to U.S. armored divisions when there was a turn of events in the Western Desert campaign. On 21 June 1942, Axis forces captured Tobruk, threatening Egypt and Britain&#x27;s supply line through the Suez Canal. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was at the Second Washington Conference when news of the defeat broke; President Franklin D. Roosevelt asked what he could do to help and Churchill replied at once, &quot;Give us as many Sherman tanks as you can spare and ship them to the Middle East as quickly as possible.&quot; The US considered collecting all Shermans together to be able to send the 2nd Armored Division under Patton to reinforce Egypt, but delivering the Shermans directly to the British was quicker and over 300 – mostly M4A1s, but also including M4A2s – had arrived there by September 1942.

The Shermans were modified for desert warfare with shields over the tracks and another stowage. The Sherman first saw combat at the Second Battle of El Alamein in October 1942 with the British 8th Army. At the start of the offensive, there were 252 tanks fit for action. These equipped the British 9th Armoured Brigade (for the battle under the New Zealand Division), 2nd Armoured Brigade (1st Armoured Division), and 8th and 20th Armoured Brigades (10th Armoured Division). Their first encounter with tanks was against German Panzer III and IV tanks with long 50 mm and 75 mm guns engaging them at . There were losses to both sides.
The first U.S. Shermans in battle were M4s and M4A1s in Operation Torch the following month. On 6 December, near Tebourba, Tunisia, a platoon from the 2nd Battalion, 13th Armored Regiment was lost to enemy tanks and anti-tank guns.

Additional M4s and M4A1s replaced M3s in U.S. tank battalions over the course of the North African campaign.

The M4 and M4A1 were the main types in U.S. units until the fall of 1944 when the Army began replacing them with the preferred M4A3 with its more powerful engine. Some M4s and M4A1s continued in U.S. service for the rest of the war. The first Sherman to enter combat with the 76 mm gun in July 1944 was the M4A1, then the M4A2, closely followed by the M4A3. By the end of the war, roughly half the U.S. Army Shermans in Europe had the 76 mm gun. The first HVSS-equipped Sherman to see combat was the M4A3(76)W in December 1944.

===Eastern Front===

Under Lend-Lease, 4,102 M4A2 medium tanks were sent to the Soviet Union. Of these, 2,007 were equipped with the original 75 mm main gun, with 2,095 mounting the more-capable 76 mm gun. The total number of Sherman tanks sent to the USSR under Lend-Lease represented 18.6% of all Lend-Lease Shermans. The first 76 mm-armed M4A2 Shermans started to arrive in the Soviet Union in the late summer of 1944. The Soviet records reported the receiving of 3,664 tanks; the difference mainly due to deliveries being sunk on the way and discrepancies between the United States and Soviet Union archives

The Red Army considered the M4A2 to be much less prone to catch fire due to ammunition detonation than the T-34/76, but the M4A2 had a higher tendency to overturn in road accidents and collisions or because of rough terrain than the T-34 due to its higher center of gravity.

By 1945, some Red Army armored units were equipped entirely with the Sherman. Such units included the 1st Guards Mechanized Corps, the 3rd Guards Mechanized Corps and the 9th Guards Mechanized Corps, amongst others. According to Soviet tanker Dmitriy Loza, the Sherman was held in good regard and viewed positively by many Soviet tank crews, with compliments given to its reliability, ease of maintenance, generally good firepower (referring especially to the 76 mm gun version) as well as an auxiliary power unit (APU) to keep the tank&#x27;s batteries charged without having to run the main engine, as was required on the T-34. However, according to Soviet tank crews, the Sherman also had disadvantages, the greatest being its high center of gravity and the ease of hitting it by enemy fire. The Sherman&#x27;s relatively narrow-set tracks struggled to negotiate muddy terrain compared to the wider-set tracks of the T-34 or German Panther tank.

David M. Glantz wrote: &quot;[The Sherman’s] narrow treads made it much less mobile on mud than its German and Soviet counterparts, and it consumed great quantities of fuel...&quot; Glantz noted that Soviet tankers preferred the American tanks to the British ones, but preferred Soviet ones most of all.

===Pacific Theater===
While combat in the European theater often consisted of high-profile armored warfare, the mainly naval nature of the Pacific Theater of Operations (PTO) relegated it to secondary status for both the Allies and the Japanese. While the U.S. Army fielded 16 armored divisions and 70 separate tank battalions during the war, only a third of the battalions and none of the divisions were deployed to the Pacific Theater. The Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) deployed only their 1st Tank Division and 2nd Tank Division to the Pacific during the war with the 3rd Tank Division being deployed in Burma, China and Manchukuo&#x27;s border with the Soviet Union and the 4th Tank Division remaining on the Japanese home islands in preparation for an allied invasion that never came. Armor from both sides mostly operated in jungle terrain that was poorly suited to armored warfare. For this type of terrain, the Japanese and the Allies found light tanks easier to transport and deploy.
During the early stages of combat in the Pacific, specifically, the Guadalcanal Campaign, the U.S. Marine Corps&#x27; M2A4 light tank fought against the equally matched Type 95 Ha-Go light tank; both were armed with a 37 mm main gun. However, the M2 (produced in 1940) was newer by five years. By 1943, the IJA still used the Type 95 and Type 97 Chi-Ha medium tanks, while Allied forces were quickly replacing their light tanks with 75 mm-armed M4s. The Chinese in India received 100 M4 Shermans and used them to great effect in the subsequent 1944 and 1945 offensives in the China Burma India Theater.
To counter the Sherman, the Japanese developed the Type 3 Chi-Nu and the heavier Type 4 Chi-To; both tanks were armed with 75 mm guns, albeit of different type. Only 166 Type 3s and two Type 4s were built, and none saw combat; they were saved for the defense of the Japanese home islands, leaving 1930s era light and medium armor to do battle against 1940s-built Allied light and medium armor.

During the later years of the war, general purpose high explosive ammunition was preferred for fighting Japanese tanks because armor-piercing rounds, which had been designed for penetrating thicker steel, often went through the thin armor of the Type 95 Ha-Go (the most commonly encountered Japanese tank) and out the other side without stopping. Although the high-velocity guns of tank destroyers were useful for penetrating fortifications, M4s armed with flamethrowers were often deployed, as direct fire seldom destroyed Japanese fortifications.

===Korean War===
During the Korean War, the M4A3E8 &quot;Easy Eight&quot; was the main tank force of the U.S. military until the signing of the armistice agreement.

At the outbreak of the war, the U.S. military tried to deploy the M4A3E8, a medium-sized tank of the same class, to respond to North Korean T-34-85, but there were few tanks available for rapid deployment from the Far East due to disarmament after World War II. The U.S. Far East Command collected 58 M4A3E8 scattered throughout Japan, created the 8072nd Temporary Tank Battalion (later renamed to the 89th Tank Battalion) on 17 July and landed them in Busan on 1 August. The 8072nd Temporary Tank Battalion was immediately deployed for Battle of Masan to support the 25th U.S. Infantry Division.

Since then, a total of 679 M4A3E8 were deployed on the Korean Peninsula in 1950. The M4A3E8 and T-34-85 were comparable and could destroy each other at normal combat ranges, although the use of High-Velocity Armor Piercing ammunition, advanced optics, and better crew training gave the Sherman an advantage. The M4A3E8, using 76 mm HVAP ammunition, destroyed 41 enemy tanks from July to November 1950.

The M4A3E8 had weaker anti-tank combat capability compared to the larger caliber M26 Pershing and the M46 Patton that were operated at the same time. However, the lighter M4A3E8 became the preferred U.S. tank in the later phases of the war. It was considered more advantageous in terms of maneuverability on rough terrain and ease of maintenance due to the mechanical reliability. Because of this feature, the M4A3E8 were widely used for providing close support to infantry units, particularly during battles for high ground and mountains.

From December 1951, around 20 M4A3E8s saw service with the Republic of Korea Marine Corps during the war while the Army operated M36 GMCs as its main armored asset.

===Other uses===
After World War II, the U.S. kept the M4A3E8 &quot;Easy Eight&quot; in service, with either the 76 mm gun or a 105 mm M4 howitzer. The U.S. Army replaced the M4 in 1957, in favor of the M47 Patton, M48 Patton and, M60 Patton. The U.S. continued to transfer Shermans to its allies, which contributed to widespread foreign use.

The Israeli Defense Force used Shermans from its creation in 1948 until the 1980s, having first acquired a single M4A2 lacking the main armament from British forces as they withdrew from Israel. The popularity of the tank (having now been re-armed) compared to the outdated, 1934-origin French Renault R35 interwar light tanks with their 37 mm short-barreled guns, which made up the bulk of the IDF&#x27;s tank force, led to the purchase of 30 unarmed M4(105 mm)s from Italian scrapyards. Three of these, plus the original M4A2, saw extensive service in the 1948-9 war of independence. The remainder were then serviced and rearmed with 75 mm guns and components whenever these became available, composing a large part of Israeli tank forces for the next eight years. The 75 mm-armed Shermans were replaced by M4A1 (76 mm) Shermans imported from France before the 1956 Suez Crisis after it was realized that their armor penetration was insufficient for combat against newer tanks such as the IDF Centurions as well as the T-34-85s being delivered to Egyptian forces. During further upgrades, the French military helped develop a conversion kit to upgrade about 300 Shermans to the long high-velocity 75 mm gun CN 75-50 used in the AMX-13. These were designated Sherman M-50 by the Israelis. Before the Six-Day War in 1967, the Israeli Army upgraded about 180 M4A1(76)W HVSS Shermans with the French 105 mm Modèle F1 gun, re-engined them with Cummins diesel engines, and designated the upgraded tank Sherman M-51. The Sherman tanks, fighting alongside the 105 mm Centurion &quot;Shot Kal&quot; and M48 Patton tanks, were able to defeat the T-34-85, T-54/55/62 series, and IS-3 tanks used by the Egyptian and Syrian forces in the 1967 Six-Day War.

M4A3s were also used by British forces in Indonesia during the Indonesian National Revolution until 1946 when they were passed on to the KNIL, which used them until 1949 before they were passed on to the Indonesian National Armed Forces.

==Armament==
===Gun development===
As the Sherman was being designed, provisions were made so that multiple types of main armament (specified as a 75 mm gun, a 3-inch gun, or a 105 mm howitzer) could be mounted in the turret. The possibility of mounting the main gun of the M6 heavy tank, the 3-inch gun M7, in the turret of the M4 Sherman was explored first, but its size and weight (the weapon was modified from a land-based antiaircraft gun) made it too large to fit in the turret of the Sherman. Development on a new 76 mm gun better suited to the Sherman began in fall 1942.

In early 1942, tests began on the feasibility of mounting a 105 mm howitzer into the turret of the Sherman. The basic 105 mm howitzer M2A1 was found to be ill-designed for mounting in a tank turret, so it was completely redesigned and re-designated the 105 mm howitzer M4. After modifications to the turret (concerning the balancing of the gun and the strength of the power traverse) and interior of the hull (concerning the stowage of the 105 mm ammunition), the Ordnance Department expressed its approval of the project, and production of M4 tanks armed with 105 mm howitzers began in February 1944.

The Sherman would enter combat in 1942 equipped with the 75 mm gun M3, a 40-caliber gun that could penetrate an estimated of rolled homogeneous armor (RHA) at 90 degrees, a range of and at firing the usual M61 APCBC round, and equipped with an M38A2 telescopic gunsight. Facing the early Panzer III and Panzer IV in North Africa, the Sherman&#x27;s gun could penetrate the frontal armor of these tanks at normal combat ranges, within . U.S. Army Intelligence discounted the arrival of the Tiger I in 1942 and the Panther tank in 1943, predicting that the Panther would be a heavy tank like the Tiger I, and doubted that many would be produced. There were also reports of British QF 6-pounder (57 mm) guns being able to destroy the Tiger I. However, this only happened at very close ranges and against the thinner side armor. Due to their misconceptions related to this, and also due to tests that seemed to prove that the 76 mm gun was able to destroy both the Tiger and the Panther, the leadership of Army Ground Forces were not especially concerned by the Tiger I. The criteria and results of the 76 mm gun tests were later ruled to have been inaccurate when compared to real-world conditions (tests against sections of American armor plate configured to resemble those found on a Panther tank suggested that the new M1A1 gun would be adequate, but testing against actually captured Panther tanks was never done), with Eisenhower even remarking that he was wrongly told by Ordnance that the 76 mm could knock out any German tank. The Army also failed to anticipate that the Germans would attempt to make the Panther the standard tank of their panzer divisions in 1944, supported by small numbers of Tiger I and IIs.
When the newly designed 76 mm gun, known as the T1, was first installed in the M4 in spring 1943, it was found to unbalance the turret, and the gun barrel also protruded too far forward, making it more difficult to transport and susceptible to hitting the ground when the tank traveled over undulating terrain. The barrel length was reduced by (from 57 calibers to 52), resulting in the M1 variant. Mounting this gun in the original M4 turret proved problematic, so the turret for the aborted T23 tank project was used instead for the definitive production version of the 76 mm M4 Shermans, along with a modified version of the gun known as the M1A1.

Despite the Ordnance Department&#x27;s development of new 76 mm and 90 mm anti-tank guns, the Army Ground Forces rejected their deployment as unnecessary. An attempt to upgrade the M4 Sherman by installing the 90 mm-armed turret from the T26 tank project on an M4 hull in April 1944 (referred to as the M4/T26) was halted after realizing it could not go into production sooner than the T26 and would likely delay T26 development. Even in 1943, most German armored fighting vehicles (later models of the Panzer IV tank, StuG III assault gun and Marder III &quot;panzerjaeger&quot; self-propelled anti-tank gun) mounted the 7.5 cm KwK 40. As a result, even weakly armored light German tank destroyers such as the Marder III, which was meant to be a stop-gap measure to fight Soviet tanks in 1942, could destroy Shermans from a distance. The disparity in firepower between the German armored fighting vehicles that began to be fielded in 1943 and the 75 mm-armed M4 was the impetus to begin production of 76 mm-armed M4s in January 1944. In testing before the invasion of Normandy, the 76 mm gun was found to have an undesirably large muzzle blast that kicked up dust from the ground and obscured vision for further firing. The M1A1C gun, which entered production lines in March 1944, was threaded for a muzzle brake, but as the brakes were still in development, the threads were protected with a cap. The addition of a muzzle brake on the new M1A2 gun (which also incorporated a faster rifling twist leading to a slight accuracy increase at longer ranges) beginning in October 1944 finally solved this problem by directing the blast sideways.

Army doctrine at the time emphasized the multirole ability of the tank, and the capability of the high explosive shell was considered important. Being a dedicated anti-tank gun, the 76 mm had a much weaker high explosive shell than the existing 75 mm and was not initially accepted by various U.S. armored division commanders, even though many had already been produced and were available. All of the U.S. Army M4s deployed initially in Normandy in June 1944 had the 75 mm gun. Fighting against Panther tanks in Normandy quickly demonstrated the need for better anti-tank firepower, and the 76 mm M4s were deployed to First Army units in July 1944. Operation Cobra was the combat debut of the 76 mm gun-armed Sherman, in the form of the M4A1(76)W. General George S. Patton&#x27;s Third Army were initially issued 75 mm M4s and accepted 76 mm-armed M4s only after the Battle of Arracourt against Panther tanks in late September 1944.
The higher-velocity 76 mm gun gave Shermans anti-tank firepower equal to many of the German vehicles they encountered, particularly the Panzer IV and StuG III, but its gun was inferior to that of the Tiger or the Panther. The 76 mm could penetrate of unsloped RHA at and at using the usual M62 round. The M1 helped to equalize the Sherman and the Panzer IV in terms of firepower; the 48-caliber 7.5 cm KwK 40 (75 mm L/48) of the Panzer IV could penetrate of unsloped RHA at and at . The 76 mm gun was still inferior to the much more powerful 70-caliber 7.5 cm KwK 42 (75 mm L/70) of the Panther, which could penetrate of unsloped RHA at and at using the usual PzGr.39/42 round. The 76 mm was capable of knocking out a Panther at normal combat ranges from the flanks or rear but could not overcome the glacis plate. Due to its 55-degree slope, the Panther&#x27;s glacis had a line-of-sight thickness of with actual effectiveness being even greater. An M4 might only knock out a Panther frontally from point-blank range by aiming for its turret front and transverse-cylindrical shaped mantlet, the lower edge of which on most Panthers (especially the earlier Ausf. D and A versions) constituted a vulnerable shot trap. A 76 mm-armed Sherman could penetrate the upper frontal hull superstructure of a Tiger I tank from normal combat ranges. Although the new gun lessened the gap between the two tanks, the Tiger I was still capable of knocking an M4 out frontally from over .

In late summer 1944, after breaking out of the bocage and moving into open country, U.S. tank units that engaged German defensive positions at longer ranges sometimes took 50% casualties before spotting where the fire was coming from. The average combat range noted by the Americans for tank-versus-tank action was . Sherman crews also had concerns about firing from longer ranges, as Sherman&#x27;s high-flash powder made their shots easier to spot. This, and the U.S. Army&#x27;s usual offensive tactical situation, often contributed to losses suffered by the U.S. Army in Europe. Even though the various gunsights fitted to the Sherman had fewer magnification settings than those fitted to German tanks, their gunners were able to use a secondary periscope that featured a far larger field of view than their German counterparts.

T4 High-Velocity Armor Piercing (HVAP) ammunition became available in September 1944 for the 76 mm gun. The projectile contained a tungsten penetrator surrounded by a lightweight aluminum body and ballistic windshield, which gave it a higher velocity and more penetrating power. The increased penetration of HVAP allowed the 76 mm gun to match the Panther&#x27;s 7.5 cm KwK 42 APCR shot. However, its performance was heavily degraded by sloped armor such as the Panther&#x27;s glacis. Because of tungsten shortages, HVAP rounds were constantly in short supply. Priority was given to U.S. tank destroyer units and over half of the 18,000 projectiles received were not compatible with the 76 mm gun M1, being fitted into the cartridge case of the M10 tank destroyer&#x27;s 3-inch gun M7. Most Shermans carried only a few rounds at any one time, and some units never received any.
The British anticipated future developments in German armor and began development of a anti-tank gun even before its 57 mm predecessor entered service. Out of expediency and also driven by delays in their new tank designs, they mounted the powerful 76.2 mm Ordnance QF 17-pounder gun in a standard 75 mm M4 Sherman turret. This conversion became the Sherman Firefly. The U.S. M1 gun and the 17-pounder had nearly identical bore diameters, but the British piece used a more voluminous cartridge case containing a much bigger propellant charge. This allowed it to penetrate of unsloped RHA at and at using APCBC ammunition. The 17-pounder still could not penetrate the steeply sloped glacis plate of the Panther but it was expected to be able to pierce its gun mantlet at over ; moreover it was estimated it would defeat the Tiger I&#x27;s frontal armor from . However, British Army test results conducted with two Fireflys against a Panther turret-sized target demonstrated relatively poor accuracy at long range; a hit probability of 25.4% at with APCBC, and only 7.4% with APDS. In late 1943, the British offered the 17-pounder to the U.S. Army for use in their M4 tanks. General Devers insisted on comparison tests between the 17-pounder and the U.S. 90 mm gun. The tests were finally done on 25 March – 23 May 1944; they seemed to show the 90 mm gun was equal to or better than the 17-pounder. By then, production of the 76 mm-armed M4 and the 90 mm-armed M36 were both underway and U.S. Army interest in the 17-pounder waned. Late in 1944, the British began to produce tungsten sabot rounds for the 17-pounder, which could readily breach the armor of even the Tiger II; these were not as accurate as standard rounds and not generally available.

After the heavy tank losses of the Battle of the Bulge, in January 1945, General Eisenhower asked that no more 75 mm M4s be sent to Europe: only 76 mm M4s were wanted. Interest in mounting the British 17-pounder in U.S. Shermans flared anew. In February 1945, the U.S. Army began sending 75 mm M4s to England for conversion to the 17-pounder. Approximately 100 conversions were completed by the beginning of May. By then, the end of the war in Europe was clearly in sight, and the U.S. Army decided the logistical difficulties of adding a new ammunition caliber to the supply system was not warranted. None of the converted 17-pounder M4s was deployed in combat by the U.S., and it is unclear what happened to most of them, although some were given to the British as part of Lend-Lease post-war.

===The tank destroyer doctrine===
General Lesley J. McNair was head of the Army Ground Forces from 1942 to 1944. McNair, a former artilleryman, advocated for the role of the tank destroyer (TD) within the U.S. Army. In McNair&#x27;s opinion, tanks were to exploit breakthroughs and support infantry, while masses of attacking hostile tanks were to be engaged by tank destroyer units, which were composed of a mix of self-propelled and towed anti-tank guns. Self-propelled tank destroyers, called &quot;gun motor carriages&quot; (as were any U.S. Army self-propelled armored vehicles mounting an artillery piece of heavy caliber), were similar to tanks but were lightly armored with open-topped turrets. The tank destroyers were supposed to be faster and carry a more powerful anti-tank gun than tanks (although in reality tanks often received more powerful guns before tank destroyers did) and armor was sacrificed for speed. Armored Force and Tank Destroyer Force doctrine were developed separately, and it was not against Armored Force doctrine for friendly tanks to engage hostile tanks that appeared while attacking or defending; tank destroyers were to engage numbers of enemy tanks that broke through friendly lines.

McNair approved the 76 mm upgrade to the M4 Sherman and production of the 90 mm gun-armed M36 tank destroyer, but he at first staunchly opposed mass production of the T20 medium tank series and its descendants, the T25 and T26 (which would eventually become the M26 Pershing) during the crucial period of 1943 because they did not meet the two criteria of the Army Ground Forces for accepting new equipment; they were not &quot;battle worthy,&quot; and he saw no &quot;battle need&quot; for them. In fall 1943, Lieutenant General Devers, commander of U.S. forces in the European Theater of Operations (ETO), asked for 250 T26 tanks for use in the invasion of France; McNair refused, citing the fact that he believed the M4 was adequate. Devers appealed all the way to the War Department, and Major General Russell L. Maxwell, the Assistant Chief of Staff G-4 of the War Department General Staff, ordered the 250 tanks built in December 1943. McNair finally relented in his opposition, but still opposed mass production; his Army Ground Forces even asked for the tanks to be &quot;down-gunned&quot; from 90 mm to 75 or 76 mm in April 1944, believing the 76 mm gun was capable of performing satisfactorily. General George C. Marshall then summarily ordered the tanks to be provided to the ETO as soon as possible. Soon after the Normandy invasion in June 1944, General Dwight D. Eisenhower urgently requested heavy tanks, but McNair&#x27;s continued opposition to mass production due to persistent serious mechanical problems with the vehicles delayed their procurement. That same month, the War Department reversed course and completely overruled the Army Ground Forces when making their tank production plan for 1945. 7,800 tanks were to be built, of which 2,060 were to be T26s armed with 90 mm guns, 2,728 were to be T26s armed with 105 mm howitzers and 3,000 were to be M4A3 Sherman tanks armed with 105 mm howitzers. As a part of the plan, the British requested 750 90 mm-armed T26s and 200 105 mm-armed T26s. General McNair was killed in a botched air support mission in July 1944, and the path to production for the T26 tank became somewhat clearer. General Marshall intervened again and the tanks were eventually brought into full production. However, only a few T26 tanks (by then designated M26) saw combat beginning in February 1945, too late to have any effect on the battlefield.

===Variants===

The Sherman, like its M3 predecessor, was one of the first tanks to feature a gyroscopically stabilized gun and sight. The stabilization was only in the vertical plane; the mechanism could not slew the turret. The stabilizer was sufficient to keep the gun&#x27;s elevation setting within 1/8th of a degree, or 2 mils, while crossing moderately rough terrain at . This gave a hit probability of 70% on enemy tanks at ranges of to . The utility of the stabilization is debatable, with some saying it was useful for its intended purpose, others that it was useful only for using the sights for stabilized viewing on the move. Some operators disabled the stabilizer.

The 75 mm gun also had an effective canister round that functioned as a large shotgun. In the close fighting of the French &quot;bocage&quot; of Normandy, the U.S. Army&#x27;s 2nd Armored Division tanks used Culin Hedgerow Cutters fitted to their tanks to push three tanks together through a hedgerow. The flank tanks would clear the back of the hedgerow on their side with canister rounds while the center tank would engage and suppress known or suspected enemy positions on the next hedgerow. This approach permitted surprisingly fast progress through the very tough and well-defended hedgerows in Normandy. Over 500 sets of these were fitted to US armored vehicles, and many fitted to various British tanks (where they were called &quot;prongs&quot;).

The 75 mm gun had a white phosphorus shell originally intended for use as an artillery marker to help with targeting. M4 tank crews discovered that the shell could also be used against the Tiger and Panther—when the burning white phosphorus adhered to the German tanks, their excellent optics would be blinded and the acrid smoke would get sucked inside the vehicle, making it difficult or impossible for the crew to breathe. This, and the fear of fire starting or spreading inside the tank, would sometimes cause the crew to abandon the tank. There were several recorded instances where white phosphorus shells defeated German tanks in this fashion.

M4 Shermans armed with the 105 mm M4 howitzer were employed as a three-vehicle &quot;assault gun&quot; platoon under the tank battalion headquarters company along with another one in each medium tank company (a total of six tanks in the battalion) to provide close fire support and smoke. Armored infantry battalions were also eventually issued three of 105 mm Shermans in the headquarters company. The 105 mm-armed variants were issued the M67 high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) round; although very effective the low muzzle velocity made hitting enemy armor difficult. The 105 mm Shermans were not equipped with a power-traversing turret, and this resulted in complaints from soldiers in the field. An upgrade was not available before the end of the war.
===Secondary armament===
The standard secondary armament comprised; a coaxial .30 caliber M1919 Browning machine gun A5 with 4,750 rounds of ammunition, a ball-mounted M1919 A4 in the front hull operated by the assistant driver and a pintle mounted .50 caliber M2 Browning HB machine gun with 300 rounds on the turret roof for anti-aircraft protection. Early production models of the M4 and M4A1 also had a pair of fixed, forward firing M1919 machine guns mounted in the front hull and operated by the driver; this arrangement was inherited from the M2 and M3 medium tanks and was a result of a World War I requirement to be able to sweep the ground in front of an advancing tank with unaimed fire.

==Armor==
===Turret===
The turret armor of the 75 mm and 105 mm armed M4 ranged from to thick. The turret front armor was 76.2 mm thick, angled at 30 degrees from the vertical, giving an effective thickness of . The opening in the front of the M4&#x27;s turret for the main gun was covered by a rounded thick rotor shield. Early Shermans that had a periscopic sight for the main gun mounted in the turret roof possessed a small thick mantlet that only covered the hole where the main gun barrel protruded; the exposed barrel of the coaxial machine gun was vulnerable to bullet splash or shrapnel and a small armored cover was manufactured to protect it. When the Sherman was later fitted with a telescopic sight next to the main gun, a larger thick gun mantlet that covered the entire rotor shield including the sight and coaxial machine gun barrel was produced. 105 mm-armed Sherman tanks did not have a rotor shield, possessing only the mantlet to cover the opening in the turret front. The turret side armor was thick at a 5-degree angle from the vertical. The turret rear armor was thick and vertical, while the turret roof armor was thick, and flat.

Later models of the M4A1, M4A2 and M4A3 Sherman tanks were equipped with the T80 turret developed for the T23 tank and the new 76 mm gun. This turret&#x27;s armor was thick on the sides and rear, angled from 0 to 13 degrees from the vertical. It had a thick roof, which sat at 0 to 45 degrees from the vertical. The front of the T23 turret, which like the 105 mm-armed Sherman&#x27;s turret, did not have a rotor shield, was protected by an unsloped thick cast gun mantlet. Combat experience indicated that the single hatch in the three-man 75 mm gun turret was inadequate for timely evacuation, so Ordnance added a loader&#x27;s hatch beside the commander&#x27;s beginning in late 1943. All 76 mm gun turrets had two roof hatches.

===Hull===

The Sherman&#x27;s glacis plate was originally thick. and angled at 56 degrees from the vertical, providing an effective thickness of . The M4, M4A1, early production M4A2, and early production M4A3 possessed protruding cast &quot;hatchway&quot; structures that allowed the driver and assistant driver&#x27;s hatches to fit in front of the turret ring. In these areas, the effect of the glacis plate&#x27;s slope was greatly reduced. Later Shermans had an upgraded glacis plate that was uniformly thick and sloped at 47 degrees from the vertical, providing an effective thickness of over the entire plate. The new design improved overall ballistic protection by eliminating the &quot;hatchways&quot;, while also allowing for larger hatches for the driver and bow gunner. The cast hull M4A1 for the most part retained its previous glacis shape even after the larger hatches were introduced; the casting, irrespective of the larger hatches, sat 37 to 55 degrees from the vertical, with the large majority of the piece sitting closer to a 55-degree angle.

The transmission housing was rounded, made of three cast sections bolted together or cast as one piece. It ranged from thick. The upper and lower hull sides were thick, and vertical, while the upper hull rear was also thick, vertical or sloped at 10 degrees from the vertical. The lower hull rear, which protected the engine, was thick, sloped at 0 to 22 degrees from the vertical depending upon the variant. The hull roof was . The hull floor ranged from thick under the driver and assistant driver&#x27;s positions to thick at the rear. The M4 had a hatch on the hull bottom to dispose of spent shell casings and to provide an emergency escape route. In the Pacific, Marines often used this Sherman feature in reverse to recover wounded infantry under fire.

===Effectiveness===
The armor of the Sherman was ineffective against most Axis tanks (such as tanks like the Panzer IV with 7.5 cm cannon and above) along with anti-tank weapon fire early in the war during multiple occasions. So it was decided it needed a compound angle to resist later German tank and anti-tank guns. The distinctive protruding &quot;hatchways&quot; of the early Sherman compromised the 56 degree-angled glacis plate, making them weak points where the effect of the glacis plate&#x27;s slope was greatly reduced. In 1943, to make the thickness of these areas equal with the rest of the glacis plate, appliqué armor plates were fitted in front of them.

A &quot;Waffenamt-Prüfwesen&quot; 1 report estimated that with the M4 angled 30 degrees sideways and APCBC round, the Tiger I&#x27;s 8.8 cm KwK 36 L/56 gun would be capable of penetrating the differential case of an American M4 Sherman from and the turret front from , but the Tiger&#x27;s 88 mm gun would not penetrate the upper glacis plate at any range and that the Panther, with its long barreled 7.5 cm KwK 42 L/70, would have to close in to to achieve a penetration in the same situation. However, other German documents suggested that the glacis of a Sherman could be penetrated at a range of by the Tiger I. The Tiger I was estimated to be able to penetrate the Sherman in most other armor plates at a range of or above, far exceeding the ranges at which the tank itself was vulnerable to fire from the Sherman.

Although the later-model German medium and heavy tanks were greatly feared, Buckley opined &quot;The vast majority of German tanks encountered in Normandy were either inferior or merely equal to the Sherman.&quot; (Panzer III or Panzer IV)

Research for tank casualties in Normandy from 6 June to 10 July 1944 conducted by the British No. 2 Operational Research Section concluded that from a sample of 40 Sherman tanks, 33 tanks burned (82 percent) and 7 tanks remained unburned following an average of 1.89 penetrations. In comparison, from a sample of five Panzer IVs, four tanks burned (80 percent) and one tank remained unburned, following an average of 1.5 penetrations. The Panther tank burned 14 times (63 percent) from a sample of 22 tanks and following 3.24 penetrations, while the Tiger burned four times (80 percent) out of a sample of five tanks following 3.25 penetrations. John Buckley, using a case study of the British 8th and 29th Armoured Brigades, found that of their 166 Shermans knocked out in combat during the Normandy campaign, 94 (56.6 percent) burned out. Buckley also notes that an American survey carried out concluded that 65% of tanks burned out after being penetrated. United States Army research proved that the major reason for this was the stowage of main gun ammunition in the vulnerable sponsons above the tracks. A U.S. Army study in 1945 concluded that only 10–15 percent of wet stowage Shermans burned when penetrated, compared to 60–80 percent of the older dry-stowage Shermans. As a burned tank was unrecoverable, it was prudent in combat to continue to fire at a tank until it caught fire.

At first, a partial remedy to ammunition fires in the M4 was found in 1943 by welding appliqué armor plates to the sponson sides over the ammunition stowage bins, though there was doubt that these had any effect. Later models moved ammunition stowage to the hull floor, with water jackets surrounding each storage bin. The practice, known as &quot;wet stowage&quot;, reduced the chance of fire after a hit to about 15 percent. The Sherman allegedly gained the grim nickname &quot;Tommy Cooker&quot; (by the Germans, who referred to British soldiers as &quot;Tommies&quot;; a tommy cooker was a World War I-era trench stove), though no evidence appears to exist beyond anecdote on the Allied side and post-war. Conversely, it was also allegedly called &quot;Ronson&quot; or &quot;Zippo&quot; due to the flamethrower version of the tank, and not because &quot;it lights the first time, every time&quot;; this nickname story has been almost conclusively proven to be a fabrication as the Ronson company did not begin using the slogan until the 1950s and the average soldier did not have a Ronson lighter. Fuel fires occasionally occurred, but such fires were far less common and less deadly than ammunition fires. In many cases, the fuel tank of the Sherman was found intact after a fire. Tankers described &quot;fierce, blinding jets of flame&quot;, which is consistent with burning pressurized hydraulic fluid, but not gasoline-related fires.

===Overview===
Comparisons can be drawn between the T-34 and the U.S. M4 Sherman tank. Both tanks were the backbone of the armored units in their respective armies, both nations distributed these tanks to their allies, who also used them as the mainstay of their own armored formations, and both were upgraded extensively and fitted with more powerful guns. Both were designed for mobility and ease of manufacture and maintenance, sacrificing some performance for these goals. Both chassis were used as the foundation for a variety of support vehicles, such as armor recovery vehicles, tank destroyers, and self-propelled artillery. Both were an approximately even match for the standard German medium tank, the Panzer IV, though each of these three tanks had particular advantages and weaknesses compared with the other two. Neither the T-34 nor the M4 was a match for Germany&#x27;s heavier tanks, the Panther (technically a medium tank) or the Tiger I; the Soviets used the IS-2 heavy tank and the U.S. used the M26 Pershing as the heavy tanks of their forces instead.
===Upgrades===
Upgrades included the rectangular armor patches protecting ammunition stowage mentioned above, and smaller armor patches in front of each of the protruding hatchway structures in the glacis in an attempt to mitigate their ballistic weakness. Field improvisations included placing sandbags, spare track links, concrete, wire mesh, or even wood for increased protection against shaped-charge rounds. While mounting sandbags around a tank had little effect against high-velocity anti-tank gunfire it was thought to provide standoff protection against HEAT weapons, primarily the German &quot;Panzerfaust&quot; anti-tank grenade launcher and the 88 mm caliber &quot;Panzerschreck&quot; anti-tank rocket launcher. In the only study known to have been done to test the use of sandbags, on 9 March 1945, officers of the 1st Armored Group tested standard &quot;Panzerfaust&quot; 60s against sandbagged M4s; shots against the side blew away the sandbags and still penetrated the side armor, whereas shots fired at an angle against the front plate blew away some of the sandbags but failed to penetrate the armor. Earlier, in the summer of 1944, General Patton, informed by his ordnance officers that sandbags were useless, and that the machines&#x27; chassis suffered from the extra weight, had forbidden the use of sandbags. Following the clamor for better armor and firepower after the losses of the Battle of the Bulge, Patton ordered extra armor plates salvaged from knocked-out American and German tanks welded to the turrets and hulls of tanks of his command. Approximately 36 of this up-armored M4s were supplied to each of the three armored divisions of the Third Army in the spring of 1945.

====M4A3E2====

The M4A3E2 Sherman &quot;Jumbo&quot; assault tank variant, based upon a standard M4A3(75)W hull, had an additional plate welded to the glacis, giving a total thickness of , which resulted in a glacis of line-of-sight thickness, and over effective thickness. The sponson sides had thick plates welded on, to make them thick. The transmission cover was significantly thicker, and a new, more massive T23-style turret with of armor on the sides and rear and a thick flat roof. The gun mantlet had an additional of armor welded on giving a total thickness of 177.8 mm. It was originally to be armed with the 76 mm gun, but the 75 mm was preferred for infantry support and was used, although some were later upgraded to use the 76 mm. The higher weight required changing the transmission gear ratios to reduce maximum speed to 22 mph, and crews were warned not to let the suspension &quot;bottom&quot; too violently. 254 were built at the Fisher Tank Arsenal from May to July 1944, and arrived in Europe in the fall of 1944, being employed throughout the remainder of the fighting in various roles. They were considered &quot;highly successful&quot;.

==Mobility==
In its initial specifications for a replacement for the M3 medium tank, the U.S. Army restricted Sherman&#x27;s height, width, and weight so that it could be transported via typical bridges, roads, railroads, and landing craft without special accommodation. Army Regulation 850-15 initially restricted the widths of a tank to 103 inches (2.62 m) and its weight to 30 tons (27.2 t). This greatly aided the strategic, logistical, and tactical flexibility and mobility of all Allied armored forces using the Sherman.

A long-distance service trial conducted in Britain in 1943 compared diesel and gasoline Shermans to Cromwell tanks (Rolls-Royce Meteor engine) and Centaur (Liberty L-12). The British officer commanding the trial concluded:
The Sherman had good speed both on and off-road. Off-road performance varied. In the desert, the Sherman&#x27;s rubber-block tracks performed well, and in the confined, hilly terrain of Italy, the smaller, nimbler Sherman could often cross terrain that some heavy German tanks could not. Albert Speer recounted in his autobiography &quot;Inside the Third Reich&quot;:

However, while this may have held compared with the first-generation German tanks, such as the Panzer III and Panzer IV, comparative testing with the second generation wide-tracked German tanks (Panther and Tiger) conducted by the Germans at their Kummersdorf testing facility, as well as by the U.S. 2nd Armored Division, proved otherwise. The M4&#x27;s initial tracks were 16.5 inches wide. This produced ground pressure of 14 pounds per square inch. U.S. crews found that on soft ground, the narrow tracks of the Sherman gave poorer ground pressure compared to the Panther and Tiger.

Because of their wider tracks and use of the characteristic &quot;Schachtellaufwerk&quot; interleaved and overlapped road wheels (as used on pre-war origin German half-track vehicles), the Panther and Tiger had greater mobility on soft ground because of their greater flotation (i.e., lower ground pressure). Lieutenant Colonel Wilson M. Hawkins of the 2nd Armored Division wrote the following comparing the U.S. M4 Sherman and the German Panther in a report to Allied headquarters:

This was backed up in an interview with Technical Sergeant Willard D. May of the 2nd Armored Division who commented: &quot;I have taken instructions on the Mark V [Panther] and have found, first, it is easily as maneuverable as the Sherman; second the flotation exceeds that of the Sherman.&quot;

Staff Sergeant and tank platoon sergeant Charles A. Carden completes the comparison in his report:


The U.S. Army issued extended end connectors (&quot;duckbills&quot;) to add width to the standard tracks as a stopgap solution. Duckbills began to reach front-line tank battalions in fall 1944 but were original factory equipment for the heavy M4A3E2 Jumbo to compensate for the extra weight of armor. The M4A3(76)W HVSS Shermans and other late models with wider-tracked suspensions corrected these problems but formed only a small proportion of the tanks in service even in 1945.

==Reliability==
===M4A1===
In September 1942 the British developed some potential improvements and tested the tanks.

After the springs of the left front bogie broke, considered typical for this type of suspension. Oil accumulated on the floor of the engine compartment during driving. The engine periodically stalled under high load due to interrupted fuel supply. It was found that the engine had been built and installed incorrectly. Upon disassembly carbon deposits were found on the working surfaces of the cylinders; they were very worn out after only 65 hours of operation or run. In the absence of a replacement by 10 October, the engine was put back in the tank; the revised fuel system was supposed to improve the stalling engine.

In November 1943, several M4A1 Shermans were tested at the American proving ground to test British innovations. On one of them, 37 experimental changes were made, on the second – 47, on the third – 53. In total, 60 changes were developed and implemented for the Shermans, most of which were considered successful after a 600-mile run and firing.

===M4A2===
In Africa, the British engines ran for 700–900 miles (1130–1450 km), or 180–200 hours. The engine had to be inspected and repaired after 100 hours, which significantly extended its service life, but there was not enough time for such work, and among crews, it was believed that there was little benefit in the procedure. The engine left much to be desired, as evidenced by attempts at modifications in the Eighth Army, which did not affect the reliability of the tank. The Shermans also had other defects, including broken wiring, breaking ignition coils, and clutch rods.

The improved return roller design performed much better than that which the early Sherman production inherited from the M3. A February 1943 report described a unit where there were no broken bogey coil springs even after a 1,000-mile (1,600 km) march. The tracks however suffered; the rubber flaked off and after a run of 600 miles (970 km) the tracks were unusable. Some units rode on tracks without the rubber pads, but the rubber tires of the rollers wore down faster. The introduction of radially grooved tires helped to cope with overheating when driving fast in the desert, but de-lamination of the tires still led to cracks in the rollers after 300 miles (480 km).

The M4A2 performed very well in hot climates in general. The British sent as many of these as possible to the Mediterranean theater, retaining a minimum of vehicles for training in the UK. Complaints began to come in about carbon fouling of the injectors due to oil getting into the combustion chamber.

Other mechanical problems were rare and were most common in the left engine. Shermans suffered from wear to tire trackpads which were mitigated by changing to all-metal tracks and ventilated rollers. The tanks proved to be very reliable with proper operation. In June 1943, it was noted that the average service life was estimated at 1,500 miles (2,400 km). The M4A2 was rated &quot;very high&quot;, while the M4A1 was rated &quot;high&quot;.

The Soviet 6th Guards Tank Army determined the lifespan of their M4A2 Shermans to be or 250–300 hours, comparable to the T-34.

===M4A3===
The Ford V-8 engined M4A3s took part in the 1943 &#x27;survival&#x27; race. On average, the engines worked for 255 hours, though one failed after 87 hours of running. Three tanks were taken out of the test at 187, 247, and 295 operating hours due to reasons unrelated to the engine. The report noted that even disqualified motors could be returned to service by replacing only one part: the rest were still in excellent condition. Of all the Ford engines, it turned out to be the most service friendly. The M4A3 tanks covered a greater distance than other Shermans: ten vehicles covered 20,346 miles (32,743 km) in total (half on-the-road, half off-road) over 2,388 hours - an impressive achievement.

The M4A3 continued to lead to reliability through further testing. On tests in the winter and spring of 1944, one tank covered in 203 hours and 25 minutes. An M4 failed after only 15 hours and 10 minutes and was replaced by another. The M4A1 lasted 27 hours 15 minutes, and the M4A4 covered 1,343 miles (2,161 km) in 149 hours and 35 minutes.

Around the same time, another reliability test began, albeit on a smaller scale of 20 Shermans of various types including four M4A3. The time spent on repairs was carefully measured: on average, the M4A3 took 110 hours to service the engine, which was better than the M4A1 (132 hours) or M4A2 (143 hours), but more than double the average of 45 hours on maintenance of the Chrysler multibank by M4A4 crews. M4A3 remained superior in transmission time: 112 hours versus 340 hours for the M4A4. In terms of suspension, the tanks turned out to be approximately equal. None of the tanks with Ford engines passed the entire route: they dropped out after 293, 302, 347, and 350 hours of running. Only three Chrysler engines and one General Motors diesel engine coped with the task.

Although M4A3s were not in service with other armies, some were supplied to the Allies for review. In early January 1943, a new M4A3 was provided to the British Fighting Vehicle Proving Establishment. By 16 January, it began trials. The engine failed after 495 miles (800 km). A new engine was delivered by the end of February. This gave more power and better performance and despite multiple problems, the tank achieved 2,000 miles (3,220 km). The British considered the M4A3 a very reliable tank but far from perfect. An upgraded vehicle was tested in the spring of 1944; it covered over 3,000 miles (4,863 km) through several defects accumulated over the course of the run. The M4A3 was considered an outstanding vehicle for its reliability.

===M4A4===
In October 1942, five M3A4s and five M4A4s were tested in the California desert, which was a monstrous test for vehicles with an unsatisfactory cooling system. Constant breakdowns of auxiliary engine units put an end to the tank&#x27;s combat career in the US Army. By the spring of 1943, the recommendations given by the Armored Council had been implemented, and 10 M4A4 tanks had been driven to a 4,000-miles (6,440 km) range. The average service life of the A57 engine reached 240 hours. M4A4 tanks took second place in reliability after the M4A3 with a Ford GAA engine (255 hours), ahead of diesel M4A2 (225 hours) and M4A1 radial (218 hours). The M4A4 was the easiest to maintain.

Additional tests of four M4A4s from 8 October 1943, to 14 February 1944, showed even better results: one engine broke down after 339 hours, three others worked 400 hours with less than 10% power loss. 3 out of 4 M4A4 could finish the Armored Council test and drive for 4,000-miles (6,440 km).

Despite the positive outcomes of additional testing, oil and fuel consumption was still too high for the engine to be recommended for service in the American army. Production of the M4A4 was discontinued on 10 October 1943, and it was declared obsolete in 1945.

===Engine===

Diesel M4A2s had a significant superiority over the R975 gasoline engines. The first M4A3 tank with a Ford GAA V8 gasoline engine, surpassing the R975 in all aspects, was assembled in May 1942, and even the M4A4 had a more reliable engine.
The R975 engine began to lose relevance once the vehicle was put into service. The R975 was initially powered by high-octane aviation gasoline. With the entry of the United States into the war, it was necessary to change to a lower grade fuel. To maintain performance, the maximum octane number of fuel for the new engine was limited to 80. In April 1942, an engine with a compression ratio of 5.7 was tested, which was considered acceptable. The nominal revs increased from 1200 to 1800 per minute. The new engine used a richer fuel mixture and had a larger combustion chamber.

Engines were compared in large-scale tests at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds in the winter of 1943–1944 with four examples each of M4A1, M4A2, M4A3, and M4A4. The endpoint was 4,000 miles or 400 hours run time. Faults with anything except the motor were repaired and testing resumed; only critical damage or loss of a third of its original power took the engine out of the competition.

During the tests, it took 132 hours to service the R-975 in the M4A1, 143 hours for the GM diesel M4A2, 110 hours for the Ford GAA M4A3, and 45 hours for the multibank M4A4. None of the R975 engines reached the 200 hours mark, failing on average after 166 hours. It was noted that a lot of time was spent on servicing the air filters for the R-975; over 23 days of testing, 446 man-hours were spent on cleaning and repairing them.

An M4 with the R975-C1 engine was tested a year later over a 5,000-mile (8,050 km) test in which the engine had to be replaced three times. In addition, there were transmission and suspension problems. The filters performed poorly: it was noted that sand and dust severely spoil the engine and other units.

Work to improve the reliability of the R975 engine led to quite significant changes, resulting in the R975-C4. Engine power increased from , and fuel consumption decreased by 10%. The engine torque went from 1800 Nm at 1900 pm to 2040 Nm. Older engines were upgraded to the later model during a major overhaul.
The new engine was approved for production on 17 June 1943, with 200 units ordered for the gun motor carriage T70 tank destroyer. In October 1943 the British demanded that it be provided for their Shermans. Tests in February 1944 on the M4A1 tank that as well as increased power: oil consumption dropped by 35% and cylinder temperature by 50 °C.

The speed increased: the M4A1 with the new engine covered 1.5 miles (2.4 km) of paved track in 4 minutes and 45 seconds – 47 seconds faster than the tank with the R975-C1 engine. Tests have also shown increased reliability. The three new R975-C4s installed on the M4A1 were withdrawn from testing after 177, 219, and 231 hours, respectively, and the R975-C1, upgraded to the C4 standard, worked 222 hours on the M4 tank. Compared to its predecessor, the service life of the engines has increased, albeit only slightly.

In 1943, the Americans conducted large-scale trials of all types of Shermans. In total, 40 tanks were admitted to them: 10 each M4A1, M4A2, M4A3, and M4A4. The target was 400 hours or 4000 miles before the engine failed. The rest of the tank units could be repaired an unlimited number of times.

By 23 April 1943, ten M4A2 had covered a total of 16,215 miles (8229 miles on-road and 7,986 miles off-road), operating for 1,825 hours. Fuel consumption of the M4A2 was lower than that of other Shermans: 1.1 mpg (214 liters per 100 km) on the highway, and 0.5 miles per gallon (470 liters per 100 km) on off-road. On average, tanks consumed 0.81 quarts (0.76 liters) of oil per engine hour. The tests ended on 11 May. By that time, the M4A2 had covered 22,126 miles, running 2,424 hours. The average speed of the M4A2 was the fastest at . The M4A1 and M4A4 both made , while the M4A3 made .
In terms of reliability, the M4A2 was in third place. The first engine failed after 75 hours of operation. Two engines worked all 400 hours, while one was in good condition, and the other was on its last legs. On average, the engines worked for 225 hours before the breakdown of the internal units. Only the R-975 engines showed themselves worse than the GM 6–71 (average service life of 218 hours). Ford GAA (255 hours) and Chrysler A57 (240 hours) proved to be more reliable. In terms of time spent on maintenance, the M4A2 came in second.

The tanks continued to race for survival. At the end of 1943, 20 vehicles entered trials at once: four M4A1, M4A2, M4A3, M4A4, and new M4E1 with an experimental engine. The Shermans drove on three types of surfaces: fine loose sand, clayey stony ground, and highways. As in previous tests, during the run, the repairmen could change any units, and only the breakdown of internal components and engine parts disqualified the tank.

By 27 December, all M4A1s (average mileage of 166 hours) and one M4A3 were out of order, but not a single tank with a diesel engine. By 18 February, tests for the M4A2 ended. Three tanks failed after 276, 278, and 353 hours, respectively, while one covered 4295 miles in 403 hours and was still on the move. From M4A3, one tank also remained on the move, but with a rather modest mileage, since it had been under repair for a long time. Of the four M4A4s, one tank broke down, and the M4E1 was removed from testing – it was decided that the RD1820 engine would not go into a large series anyway.

By 18 March, the tanks had finished testing. The M4A4 turned out to be the most reliable again: out of four tanks, three reached the finish line. The M4A4 engine also took the least time to service: 45 hours per tank. M4A2 was in second place, as the last M4A3 still broke down, and did not cover the required distance. However, the maintenance of the GM 6–71 engine took 143 hours – more than the M4A3 (110 hours) or M4A1 (132 hours). The M4A2 also did not shine in servicing the transmission group: it took 220 hours to take care of each tank (only the M4A4 with 340 hours did more). In terms of suspension service time, the tank was at the level of other &quot;Shermans&quot;: 205 hours. A total of 327 hours of a run of the average diesel Sherman took 594.5 hours of mechanics&#x27; work.

==Foreign variants and use==

The Sherman was extensively supplied through Lend-Lease to Britain, the Soviet Union, China, and Free France. Britain received 17,181 in various models, mostly M4А2s and M4A4s (5,041 Sherman III and 7,167 V, respectively), of which over 2000 were re-equipped with a more powerful gun to become the Sherman Firefly. The Soviet Union was shipped 4,065 M4 (M4A2s: 1,990 with 75 mm- and 2,073 with 76 mm-armed versions, 2 M4A4s), or 4,102 M4 (2,007 with 75 mm- and 2,095 with 76 mm versions). Еnrolled 3,664. The Free French were the third largest recipient, being given 755 during 1943 and 1944. At least 57 (or 157) Shermans were also delivered to other U.S. allies.

A similar vehicle was developed in Canada from January 1941, known as the Ram tank. Like the Sherman, this was based on the M3 Lee&#x27;s chassis and powertrain upgraded to have a turret, although it used a new turret of Canadian design. One improvement was the use of all-steel &#x27;CDP&#x27; (Canadian Dry Pin) tracks, which although an inch narrower than the early M4 steel and rubber pad tracks, were cheaper to produce and gave better traction. Suspension units and roadwheels remained the M3 vertical volute pattern, with the idler &quot;above&quot; the mounting bracket, rather than the M4 development with the idler moved behind the mounting bracket to give more room for suspension travel. The Ram had a distinctive turret with a bolted flat-faced mantlet and the UK 6-pounder gun, with the hull machine gunner housed in a rotating turret based on the M3 &#x27;Lee&#x27; cupola, rather than the simpler ball-mount that was becoming universal for tank hull guns. Production facilities for the Ram were constructed at the Montreal Locomotive Works, with the aid of Alco, but the large armor castings for turret and hull were supplied by General Steel Castings in the US. Greater Sherman production and availability meant that the Ram was never used in action as a gun tank, being either used for training or converted to Kangaroo armored personnel carriers.

A later Canadian medium tank, produced in late 1943, was the Grizzly, an adaption of the Sherman M4A1. This differed only in details, such as the CDP tracks, British radio equipment, and the British 2&quot; smoke mortar in the turret roof. 188 were produced.

After World War II, Shermans were supplied to some NATO armies; Shermans were used by the U.S. and allied forces in the Korean War.

After World War II, quite a few Shermans also went to Israel. The Israeli Ordnance Corps, seeking an upgrade, up-gunned it using the 75mm CN-75-50 L/61.5 from the French AMX-13/75 light tank and the 105 mm Modèle F1 from the French AMX-30 Main Battle Tank, designated the M-50 and M-51 respectively. These Super Shermans, as they were often called, were remarkable examples of how a long-obsolete design can be upgraded for front-line use. They saw combat in the 1967 Six-Day War, fighting Soviet World War II-era armor like the T-34-85, and also in the 1973 Yom Kippur War. The M-50 and M-51 Super Shermans were eventually retired from Israel in 1980, and were replaced by the much more modern Merkava platform.

Paraguay retired three Shermans from the &quot;Regimiento Escolta Presidencial&quot; (REP, &quot;Presidential Escort Regiment&quot;) in 2018, which marked the end of service of the final Sherman tanks in use anywhere in the world.

<text>Hu Yaobang (; 20 November 1915 – 15 April 1989) was a Chinese politician who was a high-ranking official of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. He held the top office of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) from 1981 to 1987, first as Chairman from 1981 to 1982, then as General Secretary from 1982 to 1987. After the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), Hu rose to prominence as a close ally of Deng Xiaoping, the paramount leader of China at the time. 

Hu joined the CCP in the 1930s. During the Cultural Revolution, he was purged, recalled, and purged again by Mao Zedong. After Deng rose to power, following Mao&#x27;s death, Hu played an important role in the &quot;Boluan Fanzheng&quot; program. Throughout the 1980s, he pursued a series of economic and political reforms under the supervision of Deng. Meanwhile, Hu&#x27;s political and economic reforms also made him the enemy of several powerful Party elders, who opposed free-market and government reforms. When widespread student protests occurred across China in December 1986 and January 1987, Hu&#x27;s political opponents blamed him for the disruptions and convinced Deng that Hu&#x27;s tolerance of &quot;bourgeois liberalization&quot; had instigated the protests. Hu was forced to resign as General Secretary in early 1987, but allowed to retain his membership in the Politburo.

Hu&#x27;s position as General Secretary was succeeded by his close ally Zhao Ziyang, who carried on many of Hu&#x27;s economic and political reforms. A day after Hu&#x27;s death in April 1989, a small-scale unofficial commemoration took place in Beijing, during which people demanded that the Chinese government reassess and recognize Hu&#x27;s legacy; a week later, the day before Hu&#x27;s funeral, some 100,000 students marched on Tiananmen Square, eventually leading to the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre in June. The Chinese government subsequently censored details of Hu&#x27;s life, but in 2005 it officially rehabilitated his image and lifted its censorships, on the occasion of his 90th birth anniversary. Hu was buried in Gongqingcheng in Jiangxi.

==Early years==
===Young revolutionary===
Hu Yaobang&#x27;s ancestors were Hakkas from Jiangxi. During the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) they migrated into Hunan, where Hu was born. Hu Yaobang was born into a poor peasant family. He did not have formal education and taught himself to read.

Hu participated in his first rebellion when he was twelve and left his family to join the Chinese Communist Party when he was only fourteen, becoming a full member of the Party in 1933. During the factional struggles that polarized the CCP during the 1930s, Hu supported Mao Zedong and opposed the 28 Bolsheviks.

Hu was one of the youngest veterans of the Long March. Once Mao was removed from power, shortly before the beginning of the Fourth Encirclement Campaign, Mao&#x27;s supporters were persecuted, and Hu Yaobang was sentenced to death. Just before the beginning of the Long March, he and others were on their way to be beheaded. However, a powerful local communist commander named Tan Yubao intervened at the last minute, saving Hu&#x27;s life. Because of Hu&#x27;s support of Mao, he was deemed unreliable and ordered to join the Long March so that he could be placed under surveillance.

Hu Yaobang was seriously wounded in the battle of Mount Lu, near Zunyi, close to the area where Mao Zedong rose back to power via the Zunyi Conference. After Hu was wounded, the communist field medic teams chose not to help Hu, and left him in the battlefield to die on the side of the road. Hu was rescued by a childhood friend of his, a Chinese Red Army commander, who happened to pass by. Hu called out his friend&#x27;s nickname to ask for help, and the friend helped him catch up with the retreating main force of the Chinese Red Army and get treatment for his wounds.

Hu was taken prisoner by the KMT during the Long March. In 1936, Hu had joined an expeditionary force led by Zhang Guotao. The objective of Zhang&#x27;s 21,800+ strong force, was to cross the Yellow River, to expand the communist base west of Shaanxi, and to link up with forces from the Soviet Union or with the Xinjiang warlord Sheng Shicai, who was an ally of the communists and the Soviet Union. Zhang Guotao&#x27;s forces were soundly defeated by the local Nationalist warlords, the Ma clique. Hu Yaobang, along with Qin Jiwei, became two of the thousands of prisoners-of-war captured by Ma clique&#x27;s forces. Hu was one of only 1,500 prisoners-of-war whom Ma Bufang decided to use as forced labor rather than execute.
Ma Bufang sent several Muslim cavalry divisions under General Ma Biao to fight against the Japanese. However Chiang Kai-shek pressured Ma Bufang to contribute even more of his troops to fight Japanese invaders, Ma Bufang decided that, instead of using more of his own troops, he would instead send the 1,500 Chinese Red Army prisoners-of-war as conscripts. Since the marching route had to pass the border of the communist base in Shaanxi, Hu Yaobang and Qin Jiwei decided to return to the Communists, and secretly organized an escape. The escape took place as planned and was a success: out of the total 1,500 POWs, more than 1,300 successfully returned to Yan&#x27;an. Mao personally welcomed these returning communists, and Hu Yaobang returned to communist forces, where he would remain for rest of his life.

After Hu arrived in Yan&#x27;an, he attended the Anti-Japanese Military School. While studying in Yan&#x27;an, Hu met and married his wife, Li Zhao, who was also a student in Yan&#x27;an. After his training, Hu worked in the political department, and was assigned to work as a member of Peng Dehuai&#x27;s Third Front Army.

Hu befriended and worked closely with Deng Xiaoping in the 1930s. In the 1940s, Hu worked under Deng as a political commissar in the Second Field Army. In the final stages of the Chinese Civil War, Hu accompanied Deng to Sichuan, and communist forces successfully took control of the province from Nationalist forces in 1949.

=== Land reform movement ===
During the final round of China&#x27;s land reform movement, Hu took part in the Party&#x27;s efforts to restrain peasant violence against landlords, explaining that calls to &quot;annihilate&quot; landlords meant to take landlord property, not lives. Hu instructed Party work teams never to &quot;use beheadings to solve problems[.]&quot; In Hu&#x27;s view, execution of &quot;evil tyrants&quot; (meaning the most exploitive or criminal landlords) and counterrevolutionary landlords was appropriate: &quot;It is entirely they who force us to kill them.&quot; 

===Early PRC politician===

In 1949, the CCP successfully defeated Nationalist forces on mainland China, and the communists founded the People&#x27;s Republic. In 1952, Hu accompanied Deng to Beijing, and Hu became the leader of the Communist Youth League from 1952 to 1966. Hu rose rapidly up the Communist Party hierarchy, until Mao sent Hu to work as First Party Secretary of Shaanxi in 1964, saying: &quot;He needs some practical training&quot;. Hu may have been assigned to work outside of Beijing because he was judged as being not sufficiently enthusiastic about Maoism. Unlike many of his colleagues, Hu was able to keep his membership within the Party Central Committee until the 9th Party Congress in April 1969.

During the Cultural Revolution, Hu was purged twice and rehabilitated twice, mirroring the political career of Hu&#x27;s mentor, Deng Xiaoping. In 1969, Hu was recalled to Beijing to be persecuted. Hu became &quot;number one&quot; among the &quot;Three Hus&quot;, whose names were vilified and who were paraded through Beijing wearing heavy wooden collars around their necks. The other two &quot;Hus&quot; were Hu Keshi, who was the second most senior member of the Communist Youth League, and Hu Qili, who was third most senior in the Communist Youth League and who had also become a close associate of Deng Xiaoping. After being publicly humiliated, Hu was sent to an isolated work camp to participate in &quot;reformation through labour&quot; under strict security. While in political exile Hu was forced to work hauling large boulders by hand.

When Deng was temporarily recalled to Beijing, from 1973 to 1976, Hu was also recalled; but, when Deng was purged again, in 1976, Hu was also purged. After his second purge, Hu was sent to herd cattle. Hu was recalled and rehabilitated a second time in 1977, shortly after Mao&#x27;s death. After Hu was recalled, he was promoted to directing the Party&#x27;s organizational department, and later directed Party propaganda through a department of the Politburo. Hu was one of the main leaders responsible for re-assessing the fates of people who had been persecuted during the Cultural Revolution. According to the Chinese government, Hu was personally responsible for exonerating over three million people. Hu tacitly supported the 1978 Democracy Wall protesters, and invited two of the activists to his home in Beijing. Hu opposed Hua Guofeng&#x27;s &quot;Two Whatevers&quot; policy, and was an important supporter of Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s ascent to power.
==Reformer==
===Public policies===

Hu Yaobang&#x27;s rise to power was engineered by Deng Xiaoping, and Hu rose to the highest levels of the Party after Deng displaced Hua Guofeng as China&#x27;s &quot;paramount leader&quot;. In 1980 Hu became General Secretary of the Central Committee&#x27;s Secretariat, and was elected to the powerful Politburo Standing Committee. In 1981, Hu became CCP Chairman, but helped abolish the position of Party chairman in 1982, as part of a broader effort to distance China from Maoist politics. Most of the chairman&#x27;s functions were transferred to the post of General Secretary, a post taken by Hu. Deng&#x27;s displacement of Hua Guofeng marked the Party leadership&#x27;s consensus that China should abandon strict Maoist economics in favor of more pragmatic policies, and Hu directed many of Deng&#x27;s attempts to reform the Chinese economy. By 1982, Hu was the second most powerful person in China, after Deng. Throughout the last decade of Hu&#x27;s career, he promoted the role of intellectuals as being fundamental to China&#x27;s achievement of the Four Modernizations.

During the early 1980s, Deng referred to Hu and Zhao Ziyang as his &quot;left and right hands&quot;. After advancing to the position of general secretary, Hu promoted a number of political reforms, often collaborating with Zhao. The ultimate goals of Hu&#x27;s reforms were sometimes vaguely defined. Hu attempted to reform China&#x27;s political system by: requiring candidates to be directly elected in order to enter the Politburo; holding more elections with more than one candidate; increasing government transparency; increasing public consultation before determining Party policy; and, increasing the degree to which government officials could be held directly responsible for their mistakes.

During his time in office, Hu tried to rehabilitate the people who were persecuted during the Cultural Revolution. Many Chinese people think that this was his most important achievement. He was also in favor of a pragmatic policy in the Tibet Autonomous Region after realising the mistakes of previous policies. He ordered the withdrawal of thousands of Han Chinese cadres from the Tibet Autonomous Region following a May 1980 visit to the region, believing that Tibetans and Uyghurs should be empowered to administer their own affairs. Hu reduced the number of Han party cadre, and relaxed social controls. Han Chinese who remained were required to learn Tibetan and Uyghur. He set out six requirements to improve &#x27;existing conditions&#x27;, including the increase of state funds to the Tibet Autonomous Region, improvements in education, and efforts to revive Tibetan and Uyghur culture. At the same time, Hu stated that &quot;anything that is not suited to Tibet&#x27;s conditions should be rejected or modified&quot;. Hu made a point of explicitly apologizing to Tibetans for China&#x27;s misrule of the region during this trip. He also declared to cancel Bingtuan (soldier farmers) in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, but he failed to do so due to Wang Zhen&#x27;s against. Later his ethnic policy has been criticized by some high-level officials such as Deng Liqun, as well as some Han nationalists who think Hu Yaobang have given too many Social privilege to ethnic minorities.

Hu traveled widely throughout his time as general secretary, visiting 1500 individual districts and villages in order to inspect the work of local officials and to keep in touch with the common people. In 1971, Hu retraced the route of the Long March, and took the opportunity to visit and inspect remote military bases located in Tibet, Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, Yunnan, Qinghai, and Inner Mongolia.

===Controversial political opinions===
Hu was notable for his liberalism and the frank expression of his opinions, which sometimes agitated other senior Chinese leaders. On a trip to Inner Mongolia in 1984, Hu publicly suggested that Chinese people might start eating in a Western way (with forks and knives, on individual plates) in order to prevent communicable diseases. He was one of the first Chinese officials to abandon wearing a Mao suit in favor of Western business suits. When asked which of Mao Zedong&#x27;s theories were desirable for modern China, he reportedly replied &quot;I think, none&quot;.

Hu was not prepared to abandon Marxism completely, but frankly expressed the opinion that Communism could not solve &quot;all of mankind&#x27;s problems&quot;. Hu encouraged intellectuals to raise controversial subjects in the media, including democracy, human rights, and the possibility of introducing legal limits to the Communist Party&#x27;s influence within the Chinese government. Many party elders mistrusted Hu from the start and eventually grew to fear his influence. The ire of some of the Eight Elders ultimately contributed to his forced resignation from the post of general secretary.

Hu made sincere efforts to repair Sino-Japanese relations, but was criticized for the scope of his efforts. In 1984, when Beijing recognized the twelfth anniversary of Japan&#x27;s diplomatic recognition of the People&#x27;s Republic, Hu invited 3,000 Japanese youth to Beijing, and arranged for them to tour Shanghai, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Wuhan, and Xi&#x27;an. Many senior officials considered Hu&#x27;s efforts extravagant, since Japan had only invited 500 Chinese youths to Japan the previous year. Hu was criticized internally for the lavish gifts that he gave to visiting Japanese officials, and for allowing his daughter to privately accompany Japanese prime minister Nakasone&#x27;s son when they visited Beijing. Hu defended his actions by citing the importance of strong Sino-Japanese relations, and his belief that the atrocities committed by Japan in China during World War II were the actions of military warlords, and not ordinary citizens.

Hu alienated potential allies within the People&#x27;s Liberation Army when he suggested for two consecutive years that the Chinese defense budget should be reduced, and senior military leaders began to criticize him. Military officials accused Hu of making poor choices when purchasing military hardware from Australia in 1985. When Hu visited Britain, military officials criticized him for drinking soup too loudly during a banquet hosted by Queen Elizabeth II.

Zhao and Hu began a large-scale anti-corruption programme, and permitted the investigations of the children of high-ranking Party elders, who had grown up protected by their parents&#x27; influence. Hu&#x27;s investigation of Party officials belonging to this &quot;Crown Prince Party&quot; made Hu unpopular with many powerful Party officials. After Deng refused to support some of Hu&#x27;s reforms, Hu made private comments critical of Deng Xiaoping for his indecisiveness and &quot;old-fashioned&quot; way of thinking, opinions of which Deng eventually became aware.

===Resignation===
In December 1986, a group of students organized public protests across over a dozen cities in support of political and economic liberalization. The protests began in the University of Science and Technology in Hefei, Anhui, where they were led by the activist and astrophysicist, Fang Lizhi, who was then vice president of the university. Fang talked openly about introducing political reforms which would end the influence of the Communist Party within the Chinese government. The protests were also led by two other &quot;radical intellectuals&quot;, Wang Ruowang and Liu Binyan.

Deng Xiaoping disliked all three leaders, and ordered Hu to dismiss them from the Party in order to silence them, but Hu Yaobang refused. In January 1987, after two weeks of student protests demanding greater Western-style freedoms, a clique of Party elders, senior military officials and Deng Xiaoping forced Hu to resign on the grounds that he had been too lenient with student protesters and for moving too quickly towards free market-style economic reforms.

After Hu&#x27;s forced dismissal, Deng Xiaoping promoted Zhao Ziyang to replace the liberal Hu as Party general secretary, putting Zhao in a position to succeed Deng as &quot;paramount leader&quot;. Hu officially resigned as Party general secretary on 16 January, but retained his seat in the Politburo Standing Committee. When Hu &quot;resigned&quot;, the Party forced him to issue a humiliating &quot;self-criticism of his mistakes on major issues of political principles in violation of the party&#x27;s principle of collective leadership&quot;. During the event, which consisted of all of the Elders, Politburo, Secretariat, and the Central Advisory Commission, all of his allies abandoned him with the exception of his close friend, Xi Zhongxun, who stood up and defended him and lashed out at everybody for Hu&#x27;s treatment. Hu had to keep Xi from losing his temper, telling him &quot;Don&#x27;t worry about it, Zhongxun, I&#x27;ve got this.&quot; After that, Hu became more reclusive and less active in Chinese politics, studying revolutionary history and practicing his calligraphy in his spare time, and taking long walks for exercise. Hu was generally viewed as having no real power after his resignation, and he was relegated to largely ceremonial roles.

Hu&#x27;s &quot;resignation&quot; harmed the credibility of the CCP while improving Hu&#x27;s own. Among Chinese intellectuals Hu became an example of a man who refused to compromise his convictions in the face of political resistance, and who had paid the price as a result. The promotion of a conservative, Li Peng, to the position of premier after Hu&#x27;s departure from executive-level positions made the government less enthusiastic to pursue reform, and upset plans of an orderly succession of power from Deng Xiaoping to any politician similar to Hu.

==Death, protests, and burial==

===Death and public reactions===
In October 1987, Hu retained his membership in the CCP&#x27;s Central Committee at the 13th Party Congress, and was subsequently elected a member of the new Politburo by the first plenary session of the Central Committee. On 8 April 1989, Hu suffered a heart attack while attending a Politburo meeting in Zhongnanhai to discuss education reform. Hu was rushed to the hospital, accompanied by his wife. Hu died several days later, on 15 April. He was 73 years old. Hu&#x27;s last words were that he should be buried simply, without extravagance, in his hometown.

In his official obituary, Hu was described as &quot;a long-tested and staunch communist warrior, a great proletarian revolutionist and statesman, an outstanding political leader for the Chinese army&quot;. Western reporters observed that Hu&#x27;s obituary was intentionally &quot;glowing&quot; in order to divert suspicion that the Party had mistreated him. At the memorial service, Hu&#x27;s widow Li Zhao blamed Hu&#x27;s death on how harshly the party treated him, telling Deng Xiaoping &quot;It&#x27;s all because of &quot;you&quot; people!&quot;

Although he had become a semi-retired official by the time of his death, and had been removed from positions of real power for his &quot;mistakes&quot;, public pressure forced the Chinese government to give him a state funeral, attended by Party leaders. The eulogy at Hu&#x27;s funeral praised his work in restoring political normality and promoting economic development after the Cultural Revolution. Public mourners at Hu&#x27;s funeral lined up long, a reaction which surprised China&#x27;s leaders. Shortly after Hu&#x27;s funeral, students in Beijing began petitioning the government to officially reverse the verdict that had led to Hu&#x27;s &quot;resignation&quot;, and to provide a more elaborate public funeral. The government then held a public memorial service for Hu in the Great Hall of the People.

On 22 April 1989, 50,000 students marched to Tiananmen Square to participate in Hu&#x27;s memorial service, and to deliver a letter of petition to Premier Li Peng. Many people were dissatisfied with the party&#x27;s slow response and relatively subdued funerary arrangements. Public mourning began on the streets of Beijing and elsewhere. In Beijing, this was centred on the Monument to the People&#x27;s Heroes in Tiananmen Square. The mourning became a public conduit for anger against perceived nepotism in the government, the unfair dismissal and early death of Hu, and the behind-the-scenes role of the &quot;old men&quot;, officially retired leaders who nevertheless maintained quasi-legal power, such as Deng Xiaoping. The protests eventually escalated into the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, resulted in the dismissal of more liberal Zhao Ziyang and the rise of Jiang Zemin, who becomes the new paramount leader. Hu&#x27;s promotion of the ideas on freedom of speech and freedom of press greatly influenced the students participating in the protests.

===Tomb===
After Hu&#x27;s funeral, his body was cremated, and his ashes were buried in Babaoshan. Hu&#x27;s wife, Li Zhao, was unhappy with the location of Hu&#x27;s grave, and successfully petitioned the government to move Hu&#x27;s remains to a more suitable site. Eventually Hu&#x27;s remains were moved to a large mausoleum in Gongqingcheng (a county-level city under the jurisdiction of Jiujiang), a city that Hu had helped found in 1955. Hu&#x27;s mausoleum is arguably the most impressive tomb of any senior CCP leader.

Li Zhao collected money for the construction of Hu&#x27;s tomb from both private and public sources; and, with the help of her son, they selected an appropriate location in Gongqingcheng. The tomb was constructed in the shape of a pyramid, on the top of a hill. On 5 December 1990, Hu&#x27;s ashes were flown to Gongqingcheng, carried by his son, Hu Deping. The ceremony was attended by Wen Jiabao, numerous Jiangxi public officials, and 2,000 members of the Communist Youth League. Gongqingcheng&#x27;s factories and schools were closed for the day, allowing 7,000 local citizens to attend. At the ceremony, Li Zhao made a speech expressing her gratitude towards the government and for the people who attended.

==Official censorship and rehabilitation==
===Media censorship===
The Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 eventually ended in the violent suppression of protesters on 4 June 1989, in which numerous civilians were killed. Because the protests had been sparked by the death of Hu Yaobang, the government determined that any public discussion of Hu and his legacy could destabilize China by renewing debate about the political reforms that Hu supported. Because of the public association with Hu and the Tiananmen Square protests, Hu Yaobang&#x27;s name became taboo on the mainland, and the Chinese government is careful to mention him in the media. In one example of government censorship, printed media which commemorated the anniversary of his death in 1994 were withdrawn from publication.

===Official rehabilitation===

Hu Jintao announced plans to rehabilitate Hu Yaobang in August 2005, with events organised for 20 November, the 90th anniversary of Hu&#x27;s birth. Ceremonies were planned in Beijing, where Hu died, in Hunan, where Hu was born, and in Jiujiang, where Hu was buried. Western observers noted that the move to rehabilitate Hu Yaobang may have been part of a broader political effort by Hu Jintao to gain support from reform-minded colleagues, who had always respected Hu Yaobang.

Some political analysts have argued that Hu Jintao&#x27;s administration wished to be associated with Hu Yaobang. Both Hu&#x27;s (no relation) rose to power through the Communist Youth League, and have been described as part of the same &quot;Youth League Clique&quot;. Hu Yaobang&#x27;s support was partially responsible for Hu Jintao&#x27;s rapid promotion during the 1980s.

Some observers noted that Hu Yaobang&#x27;s rehabilitation made it more likely that the Party would be willing to re-evaluate the 1989 Tiananmen protests, but other observers expressed skepticism. Memorials with the purpose of recognizing the date of someone&#x27;s birth or death are often signs of political trends within China, with some pointing to the prospect of further reform. Skeptics noted that Hu Jintao made a statement praising the governments of Cuba and North Korea (in spite of their economic &quot;flaws&quot;) shortly after announcing Hu Yaobang&#x27;s public commemoration, implying that it would be unlikely that the party would pursue a dramatic programme of political reform in the near future.

On 18 November 2005, the Communist Party officially celebrated the 90th anniversary of Hu Yaobang&#x27;s birth with activities at the People&#x27;s Hall (the date was changed to two days before it was officially scheduled). Around 350 people attended, including premier Wen Jiabao, vice president Zeng Qinghong, and numerous other Party officials, celebrities, and members of Hu Yaobang&#x27;s family. It was rumored that Hu Jintao wanted to attend, but was prevented from doing so by other senior members of the Party who still disliked Hu Yaobang. Wen was not given the opportunity to talk, and Zeng Qinghong was the most senior Party member to speak. In his speech, Zeng said that members should learn from Hu&#x27;s merits, especially his frankness and genuine concern for the Chinese people. Zeng stated that Hu had &quot;contributed all his life and built immortal merits for the liberation and happiness of the Chinese people ... His historic achievements and moral character will always be remembered by the Party and our people.&quot;

===In the media after 2005===
The official three-volume biography and a collection of Hu&#x27;s writings were slated for release in China. The project was originally begun by a group of Hu&#x27;s former aides, led by Zhang Liqun (who died in 2003). After the government learned of the project, it insisted on taking control of it. One of the main issues that government censors identified was the concern that details of Hu&#x27;s relationship with Deng Xiaoping (especially details of Hu&#x27;s removal from power after resisting orders to crack down on student demonstrators in 1987) would reflect poorly on Deng&#x27;s legacy. The authors of Hu&#x27;s biography subsequently rejected offers from the government to release a censored version. Only one volume (dealing with events up to the end of the Cultural Revolution) of the biography written by Hu&#x27;s former aides was eventually published, with the other two volumes held by the government and remaining unpublished.

Although magazines publishing commemorative articles were initially stopped from being released, the ban was lifted in 2005 and these magazines were publicly issued. &quot;Yanhuang Chunqiu&quot;, a reform-minded magazine, was allowed to publish a series of articles in 2005 commemorating the birthday of Hu Yaobang, but the government acted to limit the availability of the magazine. The issue commemorating Hu sold 50,000 copies, but the remaining 5,000 copies were destroyed by propaganda officials. This was the first time since his death that Hu&#x27;s name appeared publicly.

In April 2010 (the 21st anniversary of Hu&#x27;s death), Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao wrote an article in the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; titled &quot;Recalling Hu Yaobang when I return to Xingyi&quot;. Presented as an essay, it recollected an investigation of ordinary people&#x27;s lives by Hu Yaobang and Wen Jiabao in Xingyi County, Guizhou, in 1986. Wen, who worked with Hu from 1985 to 1987, praised Hu&#x27;s &quot;superior working style of being totally devoted to the suffering of the masses&quot;, and his &quot;lofty morality and openness [of character]&quot;. Wen&#x27;s essay elicited an enthusiastic reaction in Chinese-language websites, generating over 20,000 responses on Sina.com on the day the article appeared. The article was interpreted by observers familiar with the Chinese political system as a confirmation by Wen that he was a protégé of Hu, rather than Zhao Ziyang.

On 20 November 2015, the 100th Anniversary of the birth of Hu Yaobang, Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping held a high-profile commemoration ceremony for Hu Yaobang in Beijing. In contrast to the event held by the previous leadership ten years earlier, the 100th anniversary event was deliberately high-profile and attended by all members of the Politburo Standing Committee. Xi lavished Hu with praise for his accomplishments, and said that Hu &quot;dedicated his life to the party and to the people. His led a glorious life, a life of struggle ... his contributions will shine in history.&quot; Hu appeared as a character in the 2015 historical drama &quot;Deng Xiaoping at History&#x27;s Crossroads&quot;.

<text>The Sukhoi Su-27 (; NATO reporting name: Flanker) is a Soviet-origin twin-engine supersonic supermaneuverable fighter aircraft designed by Sukhoi. It was intended as a direct competitor for the large US fourth-generation jet fighters such as the Grumman F-14 Tomcat and McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle, with range, heavy aircraft ordnance, sophisticated avionics and high maneuverability. The Su-27 was designed for air superiority missions, and subsequent variants are able to perform almost all aerial warfare operations. It was designed with the Mikoyan MiG-29 as its complement.

The Su-27 entered service with the Soviet Air Forces in 1985. The primary role was long range air defence against American SAC Rockwell B-1B Lancer and Boeing B-52G and H Stratofortress bombers, protecting the Soviet coast from aircraft carriers and flying long range fighter escort for Soviet heavy bombers such as the Tupolev Tu-95, Tupolev Tu-22M and Tupolev Tu-160.

The Su-27 was developed into a family of aircraft; these include the Su-30, a two-seat, dual-role fighter for all-weather, air-to-air and air-to-surface deep interdiction missions, and the Su-33, a naval fleet defense interceptor for use from aircraft carriers. Further versions include the side-by-side two-seat Su-34 strike/fighter-bomber variant, and the Su-35 improved air superiority and multi-role fighter. A thrust-vectoring version was created, called the Su-37. The Shenyang J-11 is a Chinese license-built version of the Su-27.

== Development ==
In 1969, the Soviet Union learned of the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s &quot;F-X&quot; program, which resulted in the F-15 Eagle. The Soviet leadership soon realized that the new American fighter would represent a serious technological advantage over existing Soviet fighters. &quot;What was needed was a better-balanced fighter with both good agility and sophisticated systems.&quot; In response, the Soviet General Staff issued a requirement for a &quot;Perspektivnyy Frontovoy Istrebitel&quot; (&quot;PFI&quot;, literally &quot;Prospective Frontline Fighter&quot;, roughly &quot;Advanced Frontline Fighter&quot;). Specifications were extremely ambitious, calling for long-range, good short-field performance (including the ability to use austere runways), excellent agility, Mach 2+ speed, and heavy armament. The aerodynamic design for the new aircraft was largely carried out by TsAGI in collaboration with the Sukhoi design bureau.

When the specification proved too challenging and costly for a single aircraft in the number needed, the PFI specification was split into two: the &quot;LPFI&quot; (&quot;Lyogkyi PFI&quot;, Lightweight PFI) and the &quot;TPFI&quot; (&quot;Tyazholyi PFI&quot;, Heavy PFI). The LPFI program resulted in the Mikoyan MiG-29, a relatively short-range tactical fighter, while the TPFI program was assigned to Sukhoi OKB, which eventually produced the Su-27 and its various derivatives.

The Sukhoi design, which was altered progressively to reflect Soviet awareness of the F-15&#x27;s specifications, emerged as the &quot;T-10&quot; (Sukhoi&#x27;s 10th design), which first flew on 20 May 1977. The aircraft had a large wing, clipped, with two separate podded engines and a twin tail. The &#x27;tunnel&#x27; between the two engines, as on the F-14 Tomcat, acts both as an additional lifting surface and hides armament from radar.

The T-10 was influenced by the Sukhoi Aircraft Design Bureau (Su-ADB), Central Aero-Hydrodynamic Institute TsAGI and the Siberian Aviation Research Institute SibNIA in their development of a new aerodynamic scheme labelled the &#x27;integral scheme&#x27;, where the aircraft would have optimal performance under a longitudinal unstability of 3-5% mean aerodynamic chord while flying in subsonic regimes as well as fly by wire (FBW) for future heavy fighters. Stability problems present in the development of airframes under similar performance demands such as the YF-22 and JAS-39 Gripen were rectified during the FBW development process through limitation of normal load factor and angle of attack. Controlled high angle of attack maneuverability, known as supermaneuverability, was emphasized after a 1980s study by research teams from Su-ADB and TsAGI showing its effectiveness in close combat.

=== Air Force ===
The T-10 was spotted by Western observers initially in satellite photographs at Ramenskoye air base, where it was first called &quot;Ram-K&quot; and later assigned the NATO reporting name &#x27;Flanker-A&#x27;. The development of the T-10 was marked by considerable problems, leading to a fatal crash of the second prototype, the T-10-2 on 7 July 1978, due to shortcomings in the fly-by-wire control system. Extensive redesigns followed (T-10-3 through T-10-15) and a revised version of the T-10-7, now designated the &quot;T-10S&quot;, made its first flight on 20 April 1981. It also crashed due to control problems and was replaced by T-10-12 which became &quot;T-10S-2&quot;. This one also crashed on 23 December 1981 during a high-speed test, killing the pilot. Eventually the T-10-15 demonstrator, &quot;T-10S-3&quot;, evolved into the definitive Su-27 configuration.

The &quot;T-10S-3&quot; was modified and officially designated the &quot;P-42&quot;, setting a number of world records for time-to-height, beating those set in 1975 by a similarly modified F-15 called &quot;The Streak Eagle&quot;. The &quot;P-42&quot; &quot;Streak Flanker&quot; was stripped of all armament, radar and operational equipment. The fin tips, tail-boom and the wingtip launch rails were also removed. The composite radome was replaced by a lighter metal version. The aircraft was stripped of paint, polished and all drag-producing gaps and joints were sealed. The engines were modified to deliver an increase in thrust of , resulting in a thrust-to-weight ratio of almost 2:1 (for comparison with standard example see Specifications).
The production &quot;Su-27&quot; (sometimes &quot;Su-27S&quot;, NATO designation &#x27;Flanker-B&#x27;) began to enter VVS operational service in 1985, although manufacturing difficulties kept it from appearing in strength until 1990. The Su-27 served with both the V-PVO and Frontal Aviation. Operational conversion of units to the type occurred using the &quot;Su-27UB&quot; (Russian for &quot;Uchebno Boevoy&quot; - &quot;combat trainer&quot;, NATO designation &#x27;Flanker-C&#x27;) twin-seat trainer, with the pilots seated in tandem.

When the naval Flanker trainer was being conceived the Soviet Air Force was evaluating a replacement for the Su-24 &quot;Fencer&quot; strike aircraft, and it became evident to Soviet planners at the time that a replacement for the Su-24 would need to be capable of surviving engagements with the new American F-15 and F-16. The Sukhoi bureau concentrated on adaptations of the standard &quot;Su-27UB&quot; tandem-seat trainer. However, the Soviet Air Force favoured the crew station (side-by-side seating) approach used in the Su-24 as it worked better for the high workload and potentially long endurance strike roles. Therefore, the conceptual naval side-by-side seated trainer was used as the basis for development of the &quot;Su-27IB&quot; (Russian for &quot;Istrebityel Bombardirovshchik&quot; - &quot;fighter bomber&quot;) as an Su-24 replacement in 1983. The first production airframe was flown in early 1994 and renamed the &quot;Su-34&quot; (NATO reporting name &#x27;Fullback&#x27;).

=== Navy ===

Development of a version for the Soviet Navy designated &quot;Su-27K&quot; (from &quot;Korabyelny&quot; - &quot;shipborne&quot;, NATO designation &#x27;Flanker-D&#x27;) commenced not long after the development of the main land-based type. Some of the T-10 demonstrators were modified to test features of navalized variants for carrier operations. These modified demonstrators led to specific prototypes for the Soviet Navy, designated &quot;T-10K&quot;. The T-10Ks had canards, an arresting hook and carrier landing avionics as well as a retractable inflight refueling probe. They did not have the landing gear required for carrier landings or folding wings. The first T-10K flew in August 1987 flown by the famous Soviet test pilot Viktor Pugachev (who first demonstrated the Cobra maneuver using an Su-27 in 1989), performing test takeoffs from a land-based ski-jump carrier deck on the Black Sea coast at Saky in the Ukrainian SSR. The aircraft was lost in an accident in 1988.

At the time the naval Flanker was being developed the Soviets were building their first generation of aircraft carriers and had no experience with steam catapults and did not want to delay the introduction of the carriers. Thus it was decided to use a takeoff method that did not require catapults by building up full thrust against a blast deflector until the aircraft sheared restraints holding it down to the deck. The fighter would then accelerate up the deck onto a ski jump and become airborne.

The production &quot;Su-27K&quot; featured the required strengthened landing gear with a two-wheel nose gear assembly, folding stabilators and wings, outer ailerons that extended further with inner double slotted flaps and enlarged leading-edge slats for low-speed carrier approaches, modified leading edge root extension (LERX) with canards, a modified ejection seat angle, upgraded fly-by-wire, upgraded hydraulics, an arresting hook and retractable inflight refuelling probe with a pair of deployable floodlights in the nose to illuminate the tanker at night. The Su-27K began carrier trials in November 1989, again with Pugachev at the controls, onboard the first Soviet aircraft carrier, called &quot;Tbilisi&quot; at the time and formal carrier operations commenced in September 1991.

Development of the naval trainer, called the &quot;Su-27KUB&quot; (from &quot;Korabyelny Uchebno-Boyevoy&quot; - &quot;shipborne trainer-combat&quot;), began in 1989. The aim was to produce an airframe with dual roles for the Navy and Air Force suitable for a range of other missions such as reconnaissance, aerial refuelling, maritime strike, and jamming. This concept then evolved into the Su-27IB (Su-34 &quot;Fullback&quot;) for the Soviet Air Force. The naval trainer had a revised forward fuselage to accommodate a side-by-side cockpit seating arrangement with crew access via a ladder in the nose-wheel undercarriage and enlarged canards, stabilisers, fins and rudders. The wings had extra ordnance hard-points and the fold position was also moved further outboard. The inlets were fixed and did not feature foreign object damage suppression hardware. The central fuselage was strengthened to accommodate maximum gross weight and internal volume was increased by 30%. This first prototype, the T-10V-1, flew in April 1990 conducting aerial refuelling trials and simulated carrier landing approaches on the Tbilisi. The second prototype, the T-10V-2 was built in 1993 and had enlarged internal fuel tanks, enlarged spine, lengthened tail and tandem dual wheel main undercarriage.

=== Export and post-Soviet development ===
In 1991, the production facilities at Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Plant and Irkutsk developed export variants of the Su-27: the &quot;Su-27SK&quot; single seat fighter and &quot;Su-27UBK&quot; twin-seat trainer, (the &quot;K&quot; in both variants is Russian for &quot;Kommercheskiy&quot; - literally &quot;Commercial&quot;) which have been exported to China, Vietnam, Ethiopia and Indonesia.
After the collapse of the USSR in 1991, Russia, the successor state, started development of advanced variants of the Su-27 including the Su-30, Su-33, Su-34, Su-35, and Su-37.

Since 1998 the export &quot;Su-27SK&quot; has been produced as the Shenyang J-11 in China under licence. The first licensed-production plane, assembled in Shenyang from Russian supplied kits, was flight tested on 16 December 1998. These licence-built versions, which numbered 100, were designated J-11A. The next model, the J-11B made extensive use of Chinese developed systems within the &quot;Su-27SK&quot; airframe.

Starting in 2004, the Russian Air Force began a major update of the original Soviet Su-27 (&#x27;Flanker-B&#x27;) fleet. The upgraded variants were designated &quot;Su-27SM&quot; (Russian for &quot;Seriyniy Modernizovanniy&quot; - literally &quot;Serial Modernized&quot;). This included upgrades in air-to-air capability with the R-77 missile with an active radar homing head. The modernized Su-27SM fighters belong to the 4+ generation. The strike capability was enhanced with the addition of the Kh-29T/TE/L and Kh-31P/Kh-31A ASM and KAB-500KR/KAB-1500KR smart bombs. The avionics were also upgraded. The Russian Air Force is currently receiving aircraft modernized to the SM3 standard. The aircraft’s efficiency to hit air and ground targets has increased 2 and 3 times than in the basic Su-27 variant. Su-27SM3 has two additional stations under the wing and a much stronger airframe. The aircraft is equipped with new onboard radio-electronic systems and a wider range of applicable air weapons. The aircraft’s cockpit has multifunctional displays.

The Su-30 is a two-seat multi-role version developed from the &quot;Su-27UBK&quot; and was designed for export and evolved into two main variants. The export variant for China, the &quot;SU-30MKK&quot; (&#x27;Flanker-G&#x27;) which first flew in 1999. The other variant developed as the export version for India, the &quot;Su-30MKI&quot; (&#x27;Flanker-H&#x27;) was delivered in 2002 and has at least five other configurations.

The Su-33 is the Russian Navy version of the Soviet &quot;Su-27K&quot; which was redesignated by the Sukhoi Design Bureau after 1991. Both have the NATO designation &#x27;Flanker-D&#x27;.

The Su-34 is the Russian derivative of the Soviet-era &quot;Su-27IB&quot;, which evolved from the Soviet Navy &quot;Su-27KUB&quot; operational conversion trainer. It was previously referred to as the &quot;Su-32MF&quot;.

The newest and most advanced version of the Su-27 is the Su-35S (&quot;Serial&quot;). The Su-35 was previously referred to as the &quot;Su-27M&quot;, &quot;Su-27SM2&quot;, and &quot;Su-35BM&quot;.

The Su-37 is an advanced technology demonstrator derived from Su-35 prototypes, featuring thrust vectoring nozzles made of titanium rather than steel and an updated airframe containing a high proportion of carbon-fibre and Al-Li alloy. Only two examples were built and in 2002 one crashed, effectively ending the program. The Su-37 improvements did however make it into new Flanker variants such as the &quot;Su-35S&quot; and the &quot;Su-30MKI&quot;.

== Design ==
The Su-27&#x27;s basic design is aerodynamically similar to the MiG-29, but it is substantially larger. The wings are attached to the center of the fuselage at the leading edge extensions, featuring a semi-delta design, with the tips cropped for missile rails or ECM pods. The fighter is also an example of a tailed delta wing configuration, retaining conventional horizontal tailplanes.
The Su-27 had the Soviet Union&#x27;s first operational fly-by-wire control system, based on the Sukhoi OKB&#x27;s experience with the T-4 bomber project. Combined with relatively low wing loading and powerful basic flight controls, it makes for an exceptionally agile aircraft, controllable even at very low speeds and high angle of attack. In airshows the aircraft has demonstrated its maneuverability with a Cobra maneuver – or dynamic deceleration – briefly sustained level flight at a 120° angle of attack.
The naval version of the &#x27;Flanker&#x27;, the &quot;Su-27K&quot; (or Su-33), incorporates canards for additional lift, reducing takeoff distances. These canards have also been incorporated in some Su-30s, the Su-35, and the Su-37.

The Su-27 is equipped with a Phazotron N001 Myech coherent Pulse-Doppler radar with track while scan and look-down/shoot-down capability. The fighter also has an OLS-27 infrared search and track (IRST) system in the nose just forward of the cockpit with an range.

The Su-27 is armed with a single Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-30-1 cannon in the starboard wingroot, and has up to 10 hardpoints for missiles and other weapons. Its standard missile armament for air-to-air combat is a mixture of R-73 (AA-11 Archer) and R-27 (AA-10 &#x27;Alamo&#x27;) missiles, the latter including extended range and infrared homing models.
== Operational history ==

=== Soviet Union and Russia ===
The Soviet Air Force began receiving Su-27s in June 1985. The first frontline unit to receive the Su-27 was the 831st Fighter Aviation Regiment at Myrhorod Air Base, Ukrainian SSR, in November 1985. It officially entered service in August 1990.

On 13 September 1987, a fully armed Soviet Su-27, Red 36, intercepted a Norwegian Lockheed P-3 Orion maritime patrol aircraft flying over the Barents Sea. The Soviet fighter performed different close passes, colliding with the reconnaissance aircraft on the third pass. The Su-27 disengaged and both aircraft landed safely at their bases.

These aircraft were used by the Russian Air Force during the 1992–1993 war in Abkhazia against Georgian forces. One fighter, piloted by Major Vatslav Aleksandrovich Shipko (Вацлав Александрович Шипко) was reported shot down in friendly fire by an S-75M Dvina on 19 March 1993 while intercepting Georgian Su-25s performing close air support. The pilot was killed.

In the 2008 South Ossetia War, Russia used Su-27s to gain airspace control over Tskhinvali, the capital city of South Ossetia.

On 7 February 2013, two Su-27s briefly entered Japanese airspace off Rishiri Island near Hokkaido, flying south over the Sea of Japan before turning back to the north. Four Mitsubishi F-2 fighters were scrambled to visually confirm the Russian planes, warning them by radio to leave their airspace. A photo taken by a JASDF pilot of one of the two Su-27s was released by the Japan Ministry of Defense. Russia denied the incursion, saying the jets were making routine flights near the disputed Kuril Islands.
Russia plans to replace the Su-27 and the Mikoyan MiG-29 eventually with the Sukhoi Su-57 fifth-generation multi-role twin-engine fighter. 

A squadron of Su-27SM3s was deployed to Syria in November 2015 as part of the Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War.

A Russian Su-27 crashed over the Black Sea on 25 March 2020, in mysterious circumstances. The pilot was not found, after a large-scale rescue effort hampered by inclement weather involving four helicopters, 11 civilian and military vessels, and several drones. The plane&#x27;s last location was some 50 kilometers from the city of Feodosia.

=== China ===

China was the first foreign operator of Su-27 and the only country to acquire the fighter before the fall of the Soviet Union. The deal, known as the &#x27;906 Project&#x27; in China, marked a leap in Chinese aviation capability in the 1990s. Discussion of the aircraft purchase began in 1988 when the Soviet Union offered China fourth-generation fighters like MiG-29. However, the Chinese negotiator insisted on purchasing the Su-27, the most sophisticated fighter Soviets had at the time. The sales were approved in December 1990, with three fighters delivered to China before the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991. Russia completed the contract and allowed China to manufacture the Su-27 domestically, where the aircraft is designated as J-11.

The earliest batch of Su-27s was stationed at the Wuhu Air Base in the early 1990s. In the next two decades, 78 Flankers were delivered under three separate contracts by the Russian KnAAPO and IAPO plants. Delivery of the aircraft began in February 1991 and finished by September 2009. The first contract was for 20 Su-27SK and 4 Su-27UBK aircraft. In February 1991, a Su-27 performed a flight demonstration at Beijing&#x27;s Nanyuan Airport. Chinese Su-27 pilots described its performance as &quot;outstanding&quot; in all aspects and flight envelopes. The official induction to service with the PLAAF occurred shortly thereafter. China found some of the aircraft delivered were Su-27UBs that had been built in 1989 for the Soviet Union but never delivered. Russia delivered 2 more Su-27UBKs to China as a compensation.

Differences in the payment method delayed the signing of the second, identical contract. For the first batch, 70% of the payment had been made in barter transactions with light industrial goods and food. The Russian Federation argued that future transactions should be made in US dollars. In May 1995, Chinese Central Military Commission Vice Chairman Liu Huaqing visited Russia and agreed to the demand, on the condition that the production line of the Su-27 be imported. The contract was signed the same year. Delivery of the final aircraft from the second batch, which consisted of 16 Su-27SKs and 8 Su-27UBKs, occurred in July 1996. In preparation for the expanding Su-27 fleet, the PLAAF sought to augment its trainer fleet.

On 3 December 1999, a third contract was signed, this time for 28 Su-27UBKs. All 76 of the aircraft featured a strengthened airframe and landing gear – the result of the PLAAF&#x27;s demands for air-to-ground capability. As a result, the aircraft is capable of employing most of the conventional air-to-ground ordnance produced by Russia. Maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) increased to . As is common for Russian export fighters, the active jamming device was downgraded; Su-27&#x27;s L005 ECM pod was replaced with the L203/L204 pod. Furthermore, there were slight avionics differences between the batches. The first batch had N001E radar, while the later aircraft had N001P radar, capable of engaging two targets at the same time. Additionally, ground radar and navigational systems were upgraded. The aircraft are not capable of deploying the R-77 &quot;Adder&quot; missile due to a downgraded fire control system, except for the last batch of 28 Su-27UBKs.

At the 2009 Farnborough Airshow, Alexander Fomin- Deputy Director of Russia&#x27;s Federal Service for Military-Technical Co-operation confirmed the existence of an all-encompassing contract and ongoing licensed production of Su-27 variants by China. The aircraft was being produced as the Shenyang J-11.

=== Ethiopia ===
Ethiopian Su-27s shot down two Eritrean MiG-29s and damaged another one during the Eritrean-Ethiopian War in February 1999 and destroyed another two in May 2000. The Su-27s were also used in combat air patrol (CAP) missions, suppression of air defense, and providing escort for fighters on bombing and reconnaissance missions. The Su-27 has replaced the aging Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21, which was the main air superiority fighter of the ETAF between 1977 and 1999.
Ethiopian government used its Su-27s for bombing targets during the Tigray War. Ethiopian Su-27s were depicted armed with OFAB-250 unguided bombs and over the skies of Mekelle.
On 25 August 2022, Ethiopian authorities claimed an An-26 was intercepted and then shot down by an ETAF Su-27, scrambled to investigate the airspace violation incoming from Sudan.

=== Angola ===
The Su-27 entered Angolan service in mid-2000 during the Angolan Civil War. It is reported that one Su-27 in the process of landing, was shot down by 9K34 Strela-3 MANPADs fired by UNITA forces on 19 November 2000.

=== Indonesia ===

Four Indonesian Flanker-type fighters including Su-27s participated for the first time in the biennial Exercise Pitch Black exercise in Australia on 27 July 2012. Arriving at Darwin, Australia, the two Su-27s and two Sukhoi Su-30s were escorted by two Australian F/A-18 Hornets of No. 77 Squadron, Royal Australian Air Force. Exercise Pitch Black 12 was conducted from 27 July through 17 August 2012, and involved 2,200 personnel and up to 94 aircraft from Australia, Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, New Zealand and the United States.

=== Ukraine ===


The Ukrainian Air Force inherited about 66-70 Su-27 aircraft after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Lack of funds in addition to the Su-27&#x27;s high maintenance requirements led to a shortage of spare parts and inadequate servicing with approximately 34 in service as of 2019. Years of underfunding meant that the air force has not received a new Su-27 since 1991. Between 2007 and 2017, as many as 65 combat jets were sold abroad, including nine Su-27s. In 2009, amid declining relations with Russia, the Ukrainian Air Force began to have difficulty obtaining spare parts from Sukhoi. Only 19 Su-27s were serviceable at the time of the Russian annexation of Crimea and subsequent War in Donbas in 2014. Following the Russian invasion, Ukraine increased its military budget, allowing stored Su-27s to be returned to service.

The in Zaporizhzhia began modernizing the Su-27 to NATO standards in 2012, which involved a minor overhaul of the radar, navigation and communication equipment. Aircraft with this modification are designated Su-27P1M and Su-27UB1M. The Ministry of Defence accepted the project on 5 August 2014, and the first two aircraft were officially handed over to the 831st Tactical Aviation Brigade in October 2015. Despite the modernization, the avionics and missiles of the Ukrainian Su-27s were still &quot;two generations behind&quot; those of the Russians.

In 2014 during the Annexation of Crimea, a Ukrainian Air Force Su-27 was scrambled to intercept Russian fighter jets over Ukraine&#x27;s airspace over the Black Sea on 3 March. With no aerial opposition and other aircraft available for ground attack duties, Ukrainian Su-27s played only a small role in the war in Donbas until 24 February 2022. Ukrainian Su-27s were recorded performing low fly passes and were reported flying top cover, combat air patrols and eventual escort or intercept of civil aviation traffic over Eastern Ukraine. Videos taken of low-flying Su-27s involved in the operation revealed they were armed with R-27 and R-73 air-to-air missiles.

There were two fatal crashes involving Ukrainian Su-27s in 2018. On 16 October, a Ukrainian Su-27UB1M flown by Colonel Ivan Petrenko crashed during the Ukraine-USAF exercise &quot;Clear Sky 2018&quot; based at Starokostiantyniv Air Base. The second seat was occupied by Lieutenant Colonel Seth Nehring, a pilot of the 144th Fighter Wing of the California Air National Guard. Both pilots died in the crash, that happened about 5:00 p.m. local time in the Khmelnytskyi province of western Ukraine. On 15 December, an Su-27 crashed on final approach about from Ozerne Air Base in Zhytomyr Oblast, after performing a training flight. Major Fomenko Alexander Vasilyevich was killed.

On 29 May 2020, Ukrainian Su-27s took part in the Bomber Task Force in Europe with B-1B bombers for the first time in the Black Sea region. On 4 September 2020, three B-52 bombers from the 5th Bomb Wing, Minot Air Force Base, North Dakota, conducted vital integration training with Ukrainian MiG-29s and Su-27s inside Ukraine’s airspace.

====Russo-Ukrainian War====
=====Russian invasion of Ukraine=====
The Su-27 was used by both sides in the Russian invasion of Ukraine. On 24 February 2022, a Ukrainian Su-27 and a refueling vehicle were burned out by fire after a Russian attack on Ozerne Air Base in Zhytomyr District during the first day of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The next day, another Su-27 was shot down in Kyiv by a Russian S-400 system and was recorded by residents on their cell phones and published on Twitter; its pilot, Colonel Oleksandr Oksanchenko, was killed. A third Su-27 was reported lost by Ukrainian officials over Kropyvnytskyi, in central Ukraine; its pilot was killed.

On 7 May 2022, a pair of Ukrainian Su-27s conducted a high-speed, low-level bombing run on Russian-occupied Snake Island; the attack was captured on film by a Bayraktar TB2 drone.

On 7 June 2022, a Ukrainian Su-27, bort number &quot;38 blue&quot;, was shot down while flying at low altitude near Orikhiv in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. The aircraft was reportedly destroyed either by an enemy air-to-air missile or due to friendly fire.

On 21 August 2022, a Ukrainian Su-27 was reported lost in combat. The pilot died.

In September 2022, a Ukrainian Su-27 was spotted with American-made AGM-88 HARM anti-radiation missiles.

On 13 October 2022, one Ukrainian Su-27 from the 39th Tactical Aviation Brigade was lost during a combat mission in Poltava Oblast, the pilot died.

On 10 March 2023, a Russian Su-27 was damaged in a partisan attack on Uglovoye airfield in Primorsky Krai, Russia. The video of a burning airplane was posted by the Freedom of Russia Legion.

On 14 March 2023, a Russian Su-27 intercepted an American MQ-9 Reaper drone and performed several passes, dumping fuel onto it before colliding with it, causing the drone to crash into the Black Sea.

In August 2023, it was revealed that Ukrainian Su-27s had started carrying JDAM-ER guided bombs.

On 17 May 2024, a Ukrainian Su-27 was shot down in the vicinity of Metalivka, Chuhuiv Raion, during the Kharkiv offensive. The pilot, Lt Col Denys Vasyliuk, was killed. The aircraft was an upgraded Su-27UP2M, which was still undergoing tests prior to the Russian invasion.

=== Potential ===
: Korean People&#x27;s Army Air Force − According to Admiral Samuel Paparo, commander of the United States Indo-Pacific Command, North Korea is set to receive an unknown number of Su-27 and MiG-29 aircraft from Russia in exchange for Pyongyang sending troops for the war in Ukraine. &quot;The War Zone&quot; states that Russia is unlikely to transfer them in the short term at least.

=== Former ===
: Belarusian Air Force − Inherited 23-28 Su-27s from the former 61st Fighter Aviation Regiment of the Soviet Union. They had 22 in service as of December 2010. Nine Su-27s were sold to Angola in 1998. Belarus had operated 17 Su-27P and 4 Su-27UBM1 aircraft before their retirement in December 2012.
: Soviet Air Force − Passed to different successor nations in 1991.
: Soviet Air Defence Forces − Over 100 Su-27s in 1988, according to US intelligence.

=== Private ownership ===
According to the U.S. FAA there are two privately owned Su-27s in the U.S., as of 2015. Two Su-27UB from the Ukrainian Air Force were demilitarised and sold to Pride Aircraft of Rockford, Illinois. Pride Aircraft modified some of the aircraft to their own desires by remarking all cockpit controls in English and replacing much of the Russian avionics suite with Garmin, Bendix/King, and Collins avionics. The aircraft were both sold to private owners for approximately $5 million each. The United States Air Force bought the aircraft in 2011 and in 2023 one of them was preserved at the National Museum of the United States Air Force.

On 30 August 2010, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; claimed that a Western private training support company ECA Program placed a US$1.5 billion order with Belarusian state arms dealer BelTechExport for 15 unarmed Su-27s (with an option on 18 more) to organize a dissimilar air combat training school in the former NATO airbase in Keflavik, Iceland, with deliveries due by the end of 2012. A September 2010 media report by RIA Novosti, the state-owned news agency, questioned the existence of the agreement. No further developments on such a plan have been reported by 2014, while a plan for upgrading and putting the retired Belarusian Air Force Su-27 fleet back to service was reported in February 2014.

== Notable accidents ==
* 9 September 1990: A Soviet Su-27 crashed at the Salgareda airshow in 1990 after pulling a loop at too low an altitude. The Lithuanian pilot, Rimantas Stankevičius, and a spectator were killed.
* 12 December 1995: Two Su-27s and an Su-27UB of the Russian Knights flight demonstration team crashed into terrain outside of Cam Ranh, Vietnam, killing four team pilots. Six Su-27s and an Ilyushin Il-76 support aircraft were returning from Langkawi International Maritime and Aerospace Exhibition. The aircraft were flying in echelons right and left of the Il-76 on their way to Cam Ranh for refueling. During the landing approach, the Il-76 passed too close to the terrain and the three right-echelon Su-27s crashed. The other aircraft landed safely at Cam Ranh. The cause was controlled flight into terrain; contributing factors were pilot error, mountainous terrain and poor weather.
* 27 July 2002: A Ukrainian Su-27 crashed while performing an aerobatics presentation, killing 77 spectators in what is now considered the deadliest air show disaster in history. Both pilots ejected and suffered only minor injuries.
* 15 September 2005: Russian fighter Su-27 crashed near the city of Kaunas, Lithuania. The pilot ejected and was unhurt. The investigation attributed the incident to pilot error.
* 16 August 2009: While practicing for the 2009 MAKS Airshow, two Su-27s of the Russian Knights collided in mid-air above Zhukovsky Airfield, south-east of Moscow, killing the Knights&#x27; leader, Igor Tkachenko. One of the jets crashed into a house and started a fire. A probe into the crash was launched; according to the Russian Defense Ministry the accident may have been caused by a &quot;flying skill error&quot;.
* 30 August 2009: A Belarusian Su-27UBM (Number black 63) crashed while performing at the Radom Air Show.
* 14 March 2023: A Russian Su-27 flew near a USAF MQ-9 UAV operating in international airspace over the Black Sea, dumped fuel on it (presumably to try to set it alight), and finally collided with the propeller which caused the USAF operator to ditch the UAV into the sea.

<doc id="65593" wikidata="Q104555" url="?curid=65593" title="Ruler">
<text>A ruler, sometimes called a rule, scale or a line gauge or metre/meter stick, is an instrument used to make length measurements, whereby a length is read from a series of markings called &quot;rules&quot; along an edge of the device. Usually, the instrument is rigid and the edge itself is a straightedge (&quot;ruled straightedge&quot;), which additionally allows one to draw straighter lines.

==Variants==
Rulers have long been made from different materials and in multiple sizes. Historically, they were mainly wood but plastics have also been used. They can be created with length markings instead of being . Metal is also used for more durable rulers for use in the workshop; sometimes a metal edge is embedded into a wooden desk ruler to preserve the edge when used for straight-line cutting. in length, although some can go up to 100cm, it is useful for a ruler to be kept on a desk to help in drawing. Shorter rulers are convenient for keeping in a pocket. Longer rulers, e.g., , are necessary in some cases. Rigid wooden or plastic yardsticks, 1 yard long, and meter sticks, 1 meter long, are also used. Classically, long measuring rods were used for larger projects, now superseded by the tape measure, the surveyor&#x27;s wheel or laser rangefinders.

== Use in geometry ==
In geometry, straight lines between points may be drawn using a straightedge (ruler without any markings on it). Furthermore, it is also used to draw accurate graphs and tables.

A ruler and compass construction is a construction that uses a ruler and a compass. It is possible to bisect an angle into two equal parts with a ruler and compass. It can be proven, though, that it is impossible to divide an angle into three equal parts using only a compass and straightedge — the problem of angle trisection. However, if two marks be allowed on the ruler, the problem becomes solvable.

==History==

In the history of measurement many distance units have been used which were based on human body parts such as the cubit, hand and foot and these units varied in length by era and location. In the late 18th century the metric system came into use and has been adopted to varying degrees in almost all countries in the world. 

The oldest preserved measuring rod is a copper-alloy bar that dates from 2650 BC and was found by the German Assyriologist Eckhard Unger while excavating at the Sumerian city of Nippur (present-day Iraq). 

Rulers made of ivory were in use by the Indus Valley civilization period prior to 1500 BC. Excavations at Lothal (2400 BC) have yielded one such ruler calibrated to about . Ian Whitelaw holds that the Mohenjo-Daro ruler is divided into units corresponding to and these are marked out in decimal subdivisions with amazing accuracy, to within . Ancient bricks found throughout the region have dimensions that correspond to these units.

Anton Ullrich invented the folding ruler in 1851. Frank Hunt later made the flexible ruler in 1902.

==Curved and flexible rulers==
The equivalent of a ruler for drawing or reproducing a smooth curve, where it takes the form of a rigid template, is known as a French curve. A flexible device that can be bent to the desired shape is known as a flat spline, or (in its more modern incarnation) a &quot;flexible curve&quot;. Historically, a flexible lead rule used by masons that could be bent to the curves of a molding was known as a lesbian rule.

==Philosophy==
Ludwig Wittgenstein famously used rulers as an example in his discussion of language games in the &quot;Philosophical Investigations&quot; (1953). He pointed out that the standard meter bar in Paris was the criterion against which all other rulers were determined to be one meter long. However, there was no analytical way to demonstrate that the standard meter bar itself was one meter long. It could only be asserted as one meter as part of a language game.

<doc id="65608" wikidata="Q43337" url="?curid=65608" title="Xavier University – Ateneo de Cagayan">
<text>The Xavier University – Ateneo de Cagayan (; ), also known simply as the Ateneo de Cagayan, Xavier or XU is a private, Catholic, coeducational, basic and higher education institution. It is operated by the Philippine Province of the Society of Jesus in Cagayan de Oro, Misamis Oriental, Philippines. Founded in 1933 as the Ateneo de Cagayan, it became the first higher education institution in Mindanao to receive a university status a year before its sister school Ateneo de Manila. It was given its present name in honor of the Jesuit missionary St. Francis Xavier.

The university offers primary and secondary education as well as undergraduate and post-graduate education in humanities, social sciences, engineering, management and business. It offers professional degrees through graduate schools such as Xavier Ateneo College of Law and Jose P. Rizal School of Medicine.

Prominent figures such as the late President Carlos P. Garcia and late President Corazon Aquino were among the people who were conferred an honorary degree by the university. PDP-Laban President Jose Alvarez is a notable alumnus of the university. Former senator Miriam Defensor Santiago was among the distinguished politician who was conferred by the institution as well. The former Vice President Teofisto Guingona Jr. is among the notable alumnus of the university. Influential figures such as Governor Peter M. Unabia, Former Senator Aquilino Q. Pimentel, Jr., Congressman Zia Alonto Adiong, Congressman Rufus B. Rodriguez, and Congressman Yevgeny Vincente &quot;Bambi&quot; B. Emano are among the most prominent alumni of the university. Filipino song artist Arthur Nery and distinguished author Jonahmae P. Pacala, also known by her pseudonym Jonaxx, are also alumni of the institution.

The institution consecutively earned the spot in the Quacquarelli Symonds World University Rankings&#x27; top 10 ranking in the Philippines. It is regarded as one of the top-ranked private university in the country with a selective admission.

==History==
===Beginnings===
In 1933, an American Jesuit missionary Fr. James T. G. Hayes, S.J., founded Xavier University – Ateneo de Cagayan as the Ateneo de Cagayan. Fr. James T. G. Hayes, S.J., later became the first Bishop and Archbishop of Cagayan de Oro. The school was first located at Burgos Street by the former St. Augustine Parochial School, and began with 17 first-year students.

The city of Cagayan de Oro, then called Cagayan de Misamis, which had a population of around 50,000 years ago, was a major port town with fast-growing population. The school grew with the community, opening college courses in June 1938 and Grades 5 to 7 in June 1940, accommodating students from Mindanao and the Visayas.

===World War II and rebuilding===
Ateneo de Cagayan then moved to its present location along Corrales Avenue and grew into a college, offering courses in Liberal Arts, Education, and Commerce.

On December 9, 1941, with only 614 students, the school temporarily closed down on May 2, 1942. It housed the headquarters of the Imperial Japanese Army in Mindanao.

On September 9, 1944, U.S. Air Force bombings reduced most of Cagayan to rubble, along with the school. Then-rector Fr. Edward J. Haggerty, S.J., became chaplain to the advancing Visayas-Mindanao Force while serving as an advisor in Fertig&#x27;s guerrilla government. He and his successor, Fr. Andrew F. Cervini, S.J., rebuilt the school, and regular classes resumed by 1946.

After the eruption of Mt. Hibok-Hibok in Camiguin on August 30, 1947, the campus housed refugees inside the gymnasium and even sponsored a boxing match to raise funds for the survivors.

===University status===
Rector Fr. Francisco Z. Araneta, S.J., had vowed to St. Francis Xavier that if Ateneo de Cagayan was granted university status before its commencement exercises on March 22, 1958, he would rename it after the saint. An hour before the commencement exercises, then-Secretary of Education Manuel Lim sent a telegram stating that Ateneo de Cagayan now had university status.
On August 27, 1958, it was inaugurated as a university and officially became &quot;Xavier University – Ateneo de Cagayan&quot;. It became the first higher education institution in Mindanao to receive university status, a year before its sister school, the Ateneo de Manila. At the inauguration banquet, President Carlos P. Garcia received the first honorary degree conferred by the university.

==Campuses==

Xavier University – Ateneo de Cagayan operates on four campuses: 
* The eight-hectare main campus in the heart of Cagayan de Oro, where the undergraduate and graduate academic units are located;
* The 50-hectare Manresa Complex in front of SM City Cagayan de Oro, which is used as the experimental and demonstration farms and extension works of the College of Agriculture, as well as the headquarters of SEARSOLIN, an outreach unit of the university; it also houses the Jose Chavez Alvarez Technology Complex of the Andrew L. Gotianun Sr. Center for Integrated Technologies;
* The 13-hectare basic education campus in Pueblo de Oro where the grade school, junior high school, and senior high school departments are based, as well as the university&#x27;s sports complex; the grade school used to have another campus in Barangay Macasandig before it finally closed in late 2021; and
* The Maria Reyna Xavier University Hospital in Barangay Camaman-an (jointly run by Xavier, the Archdiocese of Cagayan de Oro, and the Sisters of Saint Paul of Chartres), which also serves as the training hospital for nursing and medicine students.

===&quot;Campus of the Future&quot; project===
In 2017, the institution proposed the ₱2.1 billion peso plan of the 21-hectare expansion project the &quot;Campus of the Future&quot; which would sell at least 4 hectares of its 6-hectare downtown campus and another 14-hectares of a 63-hectare agricultural property in Cagayan de Oro. “&quot;First-class education needs first-class building and campus design&quot;.” Xavier Ateneo President Fr. Mars P. Tan stated.

Cagayan de Oro Mayor Oscar Moreno also hailed the plan, saying the plan would “redefine” and change the landscape of Northern Mindanao&#x27;s capital city. However, there has been some opposition from alumni and retired faculty and staff, citing long-term traffic issues in the uptown area, as well as the heritage status of the main campus.

In line with this, the Provincial Superior of the Jesuits in the Philippines, Fr. Primitivo E. Viray, S.J., endorsed the plan to the Superior General of the Society of Jesus in Rome, the Very Rev. Arturo A. Sosa, S.J., whom gave the green-light to endorsed the plan to the Vatican for its approval.

In 2021, the Vatican has finally given its seal of approval for the &quot;Campus of the Future&quot; project of Xavier University – Ateneo de Cagayan. &quot;The long wait for the final decision only showed the amount of time devoted by the Church authorities to review and study the project.&quot; in a statement said.

==Governance==
The university is governed by a Board of Trustees, led by Francisco F. Guerra III as the chairman. Fr. Mars P. Tan, S.J., University President since July 31, 2020, is a member of the Board.

As one of six Jesuit colleges and universities in the Philippines, Xavier Ateneo also forms a consortium with the other two Jesuit universities in Mindanao, namely: Ateneo de Davao University and Ateneo de Zamboanga University.

==Academics==
In addition to the courses being offered by the university, there are programs specifically designed to train &quot;engaged citizens and effective leaders&quot;. These include a first-year course in Ignatian spirituality, social exposure and reflection as part of the course curriculum. A second-year course fulfills the requirement for community service experience, on a weekly basis. Also, at least four courses in theology and in philosophy are required, with Muslim students allowed to study their own religious tradition.

<doc id="65609" wikidata="Q752484" url="?curid=65609" title="Polruan">
<text>Polruan () is a coastal village in the parish of Lanteglos-by-Fowey in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. It is bounded on three sides by water: to the north by Pont Creek, to the west by the River Fowey and to the south by the English Channel and neighbouring village Bodinnick to the north, connected by a 4-mile walk along the hill tops. Polruan is very steep and well protected from the prevailing winds and Polruan Pool is a haven for small boats.

The population of Polruan was 534 in the 2021 census.

==History==
Polruan has never been a centre for fishing, although it is often mistakenly called a fishing village. In the 1851 census there were just four men giving their occupations as fishermen, the majority were linked to shipbuilding or were mariners. In the medieval period Polruan produced some very large ships, employed in the wine trade with Bordeaux. In 1343 five Polruan ships were in the King&#x27;s service. A century later the &quot;Edward of Polruan&quot; was accused of piracy and its size can be shown by the number of men it carried, 200 men &#x27;armed and arrayed for war.&#x27;

 St Ruan was the first to occupy the top of Polruan Hill the point where St Saviour&#x27;s ruin still stands today. The ruin of St Saviour&#x27;s church on the hill above Polruan dates to the 8th century. It was a landmark for shipping, and also, in times of war, a vantage point for observing the approach of enemy shipping to the strategically important Fowey harbour. The name Polruan derives from the Cornish for &quot;harbour of a man called Ruveun&quot;.

Polruan also has a blockhouse fortification built in the 14th century that guards the entrance to the river Fowey, one of a pair—its partner being situated on the Fowey side of the river. The Polruan blockhouse is well preserved due to the efforts of various enthusiastic councillors and conservationists on the Polruan side of the river, in contrast to the blockhouse in Fowey. Between the two blockhouses was strung a defensive chain to prevent enemy ships entering the harbour, the chain being lowered for friendly vessels. This was primarily used during the wars with the Dutch.

The Harbour Commissioners Yard at Brazen Island was a shipbuilding yard in the 19th century, one of several in Polruan building schooners, barquentines and ketches. Polruan was the major shipbuilding site in the harbour and the owners and the families of the mariners lived in the village. As wooden shipbuilding declined in late 19th century, Brazen Island became a sardine processing factory which also supplied electricity for the village. The gun battery at Peak Point held an anti-shipping gun of which the mounting pin can still be seen. The battery gave the name of Battery Park. The wall at Peak Field was used for rifle practice. Motor torpedo boats were repaired at Pont Creek during World War II. The overhanging trees hid the boats from surveillance aircraft. The remains of cradles for boat repair and some hull parts can still be seen preserved in the mud on the foreshore.

A cross known as Polruan or St Saviour&#x27;s Cross stands at the top of Fore Street. The latter name comes from the former chapel of St Saviour nearby.

==Education==
The main school serving the village is Polruan Primary Academy which is a mixed school of non-denominational religion. The primary school (which only has 25 pupils at most) was formerly the village girls&#x27; school, the boys&#x27; school being destroyed in World War 2 after a German bomber shed its unused payload. The site of the boys&#x27; school is now where the carpark is at the top of St Saviours Hill.

The nearest secondary school, Fowey River Academy, is in Fowey.

==Transport==
Polruan can be accessed in a number of ways. By car using the linking one road in and one road out, which is the usual way. There is a taxi service operating in the village which transports residents in and out of the village. The local bus service operates on different times during season, the service is run via Looe, Polperro, Lansallos and Greenbank.

Other transport includes the Polruan ferry, which crosses the river to and from Fowey every 15 minutes and operates every day of the year. There is also a passenger ferry to Mevagissey. Cars can be ferried to Fowey from Bodinnick which is 4 miles away. When the car ferry from Bodinnick is not running, Fowey and points westwards are reached by car via a car journey via Lostwithiel.

==Sport==
The history of the Troy class of boat has been set down by Marcus Lewis. Lewis also builds boats and has a small history of the Fowey River class of boat.

==Maritime links==
 The long legacy of shipbuilding continues today with Toms yard. Until recently the Fowey Harbour Pilots traditionally came from Polruan. Pilotage for commercial shipping was carried out from open boats with the Pilots boarding the ships via a pilot ladder. The Fowey Pilots Association describes the work of the pilots.

Polruan is one of a now increasing number of Cornish places to use lookouts to help marine craft in distress. Many lookout towers were demolished in the 1980s to save costs. Now, through the National Coastwatch Institution (NCI), a voluntary charity, many of the surviving old coastguard lookouts and towers are being re-staffed by qualified volunteers. The Old Coastguard Lookout at Polruan was among the first to be re-commissioned in this way. (The current His Majesty&#x27;s Coastguard headquarters for cliff rescue, including the equipment store, is on St Saviour&#x27;s Hill adjacent to the NCI Station, above the main village carpark. Exercises of the HM Coastguard continue.) The current Polruan NCI Station overlooks the Fowey estuary and also St Austell Bay beyond the village. It was constructed in the nineteenth century.

==People==
Calvin Dean, the actor from the film Tormented, grew up in Polruan. Daphne du Maurier once stayed in the village and based her first novel, &quot;The Loving Spirit&quot;, on the Slade family of shipbuilders and mariners. Peter Skellern, the singer was resident in the village. Actor Patrick Malahide, who amongst other roles, played Inspector Chisholm in the popular television series &quot;Minder&quot; is also another Polruan resident.
The illustrator Mabel Lucie Attwell lived in the village, as did the absurdist English playwright Norman F. Simpson. Raynor Winn, the author of &quot;The Salt Path&quot;, used to live in Polruan, which is the mid- and end-point of the 630-mile walk described in the book.

==Film and television==
The film &quot;Stolen Hours&quot; featuring Susan Hayward was filmed around Polruan. The latter part of the film follows an actress who comes to Polruan to live out the remainder of her life, following a brain tumour, with her surgeon husband. The 1963 film displays older shots of the village including use of the village shop, &quot;Headland House&quot;, and the clip of the children&#x27;s sports day which is filmed where Greenbank is now built. A local, Mrs Baker, was included in the filming of the egg and spoon race and calls... &quot;Let&#x27;s get shoes off!&quot;

An episode of &quot;The Inspector Lynley Mysteries&quot; was also partly filmed in Polruan.

<text>Tintagel () or Trevena (, meaning &quot;Village on a Mountain&quot;) is a civil parish and village situated on the Atlantic coast of Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. The village and nearby Tintagel Castle are associated with the legends surrounding King Arthur and in recent times have become a tourist attraction. It was claimed by Geoffrey of Monmouth that the castle was the place of Arthur&#x27;s conception.

Tintagel is used by the poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson in the poem &quot;Idylls of the King&quot; and Algernon Charles Swinburne&#x27;s &quot;Tristram of Lyonesse&quot;, and Thomas Hardy&#x27;s &quot;The Famous Tragedy of the Queen of Cornwall at Tintagel in Lyonnesse&quot;, is a play published in 1923, which perpetuates the same legend.

Tourists can visit King Arthur&#x27;s Great Halls at Trevena which is a substantial building of the early 1930s. The Artognou stone, which was discovered in 1998, has added to the legend, although historians do not believe the inscription refers to King Arthur.

==Toponymy==

Toponymists have had difficulty explaining the origin of &#x27;Tintagel&#x27;: the probability is that it is Norman French, as the Cornish of the 13th century would have lacked the soft &#x27;g&#x27; (&#x27;i/j&#x27; in the earliest forms: see also Tintagel Castle). If it is Cornish then &#x27;Dun&#x27; would mean &quot;Fort&quot;. Oliver Padel proposes &#x27;Dun&#x27; &#x27;-tagell&#x27; meaning &quot;narrow place&quot; in his book on place names. There is a possible cognate in the Channel Islands named &quot;Tente d&#x27;Agel&quot;, but that still leaves the question subject to doubt.
The name first occurs in Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; (c. 1136, in Latin) as &quot;Tintagol&quot;, implying pronunciation with a hard [g] sound as in modern English &quot;girl&quot;. But in Layamon&#x27;s &quot;Brut&quot; (MS Cotton Otho C.xi, f. 482), in early Middle English, the name is rendered as &quot;Tintaieol&quot;. The letter &quot;i&quot; in this spelling implies a soft consonant like modern English &quot;j&quot;; the second part of the name would be pronounced approximately as &quot;-ageul&quot; would be in modern French.

An oft-quoted Celtic etymology in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of English Place-Names&quot;, accepts the view of Padel (1985) that the name is from Cornish *&quot;din&quot; meaning &quot;fort&quot; and *&quot;tagell&quot; meaning &quot;neck, throat, constriction, narrow&quot; (Celtic *&quot;dūn&quot;, &quot;fort&quot; = Irish &quot;dún&quot;, &quot;fort&quot;, &quot;cf&quot;. Welsh &quot;dinas&quot;, &quot;city&quot;; *&quot;tagell&quot; = Welsh &quot;tagell&quot;, &quot;gill, wattle&quot;).

The modern-day village of Tintagel was always known as Trevena () until the Post Office started using &#x27;Tintagel&#x27; as the name in the mid-19th century. Until then, &#x27;Tintagel&#x27; had been restricted to the name of the headland and of the parish.

==Area and population==
Treknow is the largest of the other settlements in the Tintagel parish, which also include Bossiney, Truas, Trebarwith, Tregatta, Trenale, Trethevy, Treven, Trevillet, and Trewarmett. The population of the entire parish was 1,725 at the 2021 census, and 1,727 at the 2011 census, down from 1,820 people at the 2001 census, and the area of the parish is . (The population recorded in the 2011 census was 1,782 but this includes Knightsmill in the parish of St Teath.)

An electoral ward also exists extending inland to Otterham. The population of this ward at the same census was 3,990.

==History and government==

A small cliff castle was established at Bossiney in Norman times, probably before the Domesday Survey of 1086. In &quot;Domesday Book&quot;, there are certainly two manors in this parish (for a probable third see Trethevy).

Bossiney and Trevena were established as a borough in 1253 by Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall. Bossiney (which included Trevena) was held from the monks of Bodmin by the Earl of Cornwall: there was land for six ploughs and of pasture (before the Conquest it had been held from the monks by Alfwy). The monks of Bodmin held Treknow themselves: there was land for eight ploughs and of pasture. Tintagel was one of the 17 Antiqua maneria of the Duchy of Cornwall. The parish feast traditionally celebrated at Tintagel was 19 October, the feast day of St Denys, patron of the chapel at Trevena (the proper date is 9 October but the feast has moved forward due to the calendar reform of 1752). The market hall and the site of the fair were near the chapel. &quot;Tintagel (Trevena) declined towards the end of the medieval period for it was ill-equipped to take up fishing as an alternative occupation. Paradoxically it now enjoys a temporary prosperity as a result of tourist interest in the castle which was converted so romantically by Geoffrey of Monmouth into an ancient residence of King Arthur.&quot; (W. G. V. Balchin 1954)

The Tithe Commissioners&#x27; survey was carried out in 1840–41 and recorded the area of the parish as , of which arable and pasture land was . The land owned by the largest landowner, Lord Wharncliffe, amounted to , and there was of glebe land. Precise details of the size and tenure of every piece of land are given. Sidney Madge did research into the history of the parish and compiled a manuscript &quot;Records of Tintagel&quot; in 1945. The villages of Trevena and Bossiney were until the early 20th century separated by fields along Bossiney Road.

Trebarwith was the scene of the shipwreck of the &quot;Sarah Anderson&quot; in 1886 (all on board perished), but the most famous of the wrecks happened on 20 December 1893, at Lye Rock when the barque &quot;Iota&quot; was driven against the cliff. The crew were able to get onto the rock and apart from a youth of 14 were saved by four men (three of these from Tintagel: one of them, Charles Hambly, received a Vellum testimonial and three medals for bravery afterwards). The story is told in verse in &quot;Musings on Tintagel and its Heroes&quot; by Joseph Brown, 1897; the youth was buried in Tintagel Churchyard and the grave is marked by a wooden cross (his name is given in the bureaucratic Italian usage, surname first: Catanese Domenico). On 6 July 1979, Tintagel was briefly subject to national attention when an RAF Hawker Hunter fighter aircraft crashed into the village following an engine malfunction; the unusual incident caused significant damage and consternation, but no deaths.

The borough of Bossiney was given the right to send two MPs to Parliament c. 1552 and continued to do so until 1832 when its status as a borough was abolished. For the purposes of local government, Tintagel is currently a civil parish and councillors are elected every four years. The principal local authority in this area is Cornwall Council, but until March 2009 the parish was in the area of North Cornwall District Council. Parish council minutes can be found on Tintagel Web. From 1894 to 1974, the parish was in the Camelford Rural District.

==Arthurian legends==


As described in Geoffrey&#x27;s popular &quot;Historia&quot;, Gorlois, Duke of Cornwall, put his wife Igraine in &quot;Tintagol&quot; while he was at war (&quot;posuit eam in oppido Tintagol in littore maris&quot;: &quot;he put her in the &quot;oppidum&quot; Tintagol on the shore of the sea&quot;). Merlin disguised Uther Pendragon as Gorlois so that Uther could enter Tintagel and impregnate Igraine while pretending to be Gorlois; Uther and Igraine&#x27;s child was King Arthur. This motif became the standard origin story of Arthur in subsequent medieval chronicles and chivalric romances. Some events of the Tristan and Iseult legend are also set at Tintagel.

==Archaeology and architecture==
The Ravenna Cosmography, of around 700, makes reference to Purocoronavis (almost certainly a corruption of Durocornovium), &#x27;a fort or walled settlement of the Cornovii&#x27;: the location is unidentified, but Tintagel and Carn Brea have both been suggested. If this is correct then it would have been on the site of Tintagel Castle. Excavations around Tintagel Castle have supported the notion of trade goods there, with ships from along the Atlantic Coast and the Mediterranean Sea bringing pots carrying wine or oil, in the Early medieval period. The site appeared to be one of the places where a local king or warlord, perhaps of Dumnonia, and his entourage settled for a time, and traded with ships arriving from those far ports.

===Excavations===

Major excavations beginning with C. A. Ralegh Radford&#x27;s work in the 1930s on and around the site of the 12th-century castle have revealed that Tintagel headland was the site of either a high status Celtic monastery (according to Ralegh Radford) or a princely fortress as well as trading settlement dating to the 5th and 6th centuries (according to later excavators), in the period immediately following the withdrawal of the Romans from Britain. Finds of Mediterranean oil and wine jars show that Sub-Roman Britain was not the isolated outpost it was previously considered to be, for an extensive trade in high-value goods was taking place at the time with the Mediterranean region.

Finds from the excavations are preserved at the Royal Cornwall Museum in Truro. In 1998, excavations discovered the Artognou stone, which has added to Tintagel&#x27;s Arthurian lore, although historians do not believe the inscription refers to King Arthur. Two seasons of excavation work were undertaken in Tintagel churchyard in the early 1990s.

===Antiquities===
The largest of the Bronze Age barrows is at the highest point in the parish, Condolden, another is at Menadue, and there are a number of others along the cliffs. In the Iron Age there were probably fortifications at Willapark and Barras Head, and inland at Trenale Bury. Two of the Roman milestones found in Cornwall are at Tintagel (the earlier of the two is described under Trethevy: the later one was found in the walls of the churchyard in 1889 and is preserved in the church. The inscription can be read as &#x27;[I]mp C G Val Lic Licin&#x27; which would refer to the Emperor Licinius (d. 324).

There are many other relics of antiquity to be found here such as the so-called King Arthur&#x27;s Footprint on the Island and a carved rock from Starapark which has been placed outside the Sir James Smith&#x27;s School at Dark Lane, Camelford. Rodney Castleden has written about these as Bronze Age ritual objects. &quot;King Arthur&#x27;s Footprint&quot; is a hollow in the rock at the highest point of Tintagel Island&#x27;s southern side. It is not entirely natural, having been shaped by human hands at some stage. It may have been used for the inauguration of kings or chieftains as the site is known to have a long history stretching back to the Dark Ages. The name is probably a 19th-century invention by the castle guide.

Stone crosses, of which there are two, have both been moved from their original positions: the plainer of the two is Hendra cross (see Bossiney). Aelnat&#x27;s cross which was found at Trevillet and then moved to the Wharncliffe Arms Hotel at Trevena, is finely carved. The inscription can be read as &#x27;Aelnat fecit hanc crucem pro anima sua&#x27; (Ælnat made this cross for [the good of] his soul) – the back of the stone has the names of the four evangelists. The name of this man is Saxon, and together with Alfwy mentioned in 1086 he is the only Anglo-Saxon recorded in connection with the area. One of Thomas Hardy&#x27;s poems, &quot;By the runic stone&quot; (1917) was interpreted by Evelyn Hardy as referring to Aelnat&#x27;s cross.

===Notable secular buildings===
The village has the Tintagel Old Post Office, which dates from the 14th century. It became a post office during the 19th century, and is now listed Grade I and owned by the National Trust.

Tintagel Primary School was built at Treven in 1914 to replace the old church school (founded 1874) and has been extended since. Those who go on to a comprehensive school attend Sir James Smith&#x27;s School, Camelford. The Gift House was purchased by the Trustees of Tintagel Women&#x27;s Institute from Catherine Johns and not donated as previously thought. It adjoins the Old Post Office.

The former Vicarage was built in the early 17th century and substantial additions were made in the late 18th and mid-19th centuries. In the grounds is Fontevrault Chapel and a columbarium which is one of the best preserved in Cornwall. The site and glebe lands were the home of the vicars as early as the mid-13th century when the benefice came into the hands of the Abbey of Fontevraud in Anjou, France. In 2008, the Diocese of Truro decided to acquire new accommodation for future vicars and to sell the vicarage.

King Arthur&#x27;s Great Halls at Trevena is a substantial building of the early 1930s. It was built for custard powder manufacturer F. T. Glasscock as the headquarters of the &quot;Fellowship of the Knights of the Round Table&quot;, behind Trevena House. A variety of Cornish stones are used in the construction and the 73 stained glass windows illustrating the Arthurian tales are by Veronica Whall; there are several paintings of scenes from the life of King Arthur by William Hatherell. In 1927, the Order of the Fellowship of the Knights of the Round Table was formed in Britain by Frederick Thomas Glasscock (a retired London businessman, d. 1934) to promote Christian ideals and Arthurian notions of medieval chivalry. Glasscock was resident at Tintagel (in the house &quot;Eirenicon&quot; which he had built) and responsible for the building of King Arthur&#x27;s Hall (an extension of Trevena House which had been John Douglas Cook&#x27;s residence and had been built on the site of the former Town Hall and Market Hall). The hall is now used as a Masonic Hall, and is home to four Masonic bodies.

=== Hotels ===
The King Arthur&#x27;s Castle Hotel (now called Camelot Castle Hotel) opened in 1899; it was an enterprise of Sir Robert Harvey and the architect was Silvanus Trevail. It was originally intended as the terminus hotel for a planned branch railway line from Camelford that was never built. The hotel stands alone on land previously known as Firebeacon. The hotel was built in 1896. The front has battered walls, a central entrance tower rising to five storeys and projecting four-storey corner towers; the towers have machicolations and rise above the three storeys of the rest of the building. The Great Hall on the first floor is designed around a replica of the Winchester Round Table and has Romanesque arcades with Italian marble piers. In 2010, an exposé of the hotel&#x27;s business practices was broadcast by the BBC television programme &quot;Inside Out South West&quot;.

There were two hotels on Fore Street, Trevena: the Wharncliffe Hotel and the Tintagel Hotel. The Wharncliffe has now been converted into flats (next to the King Arthur&#x27;s Hall): the Aelnat Cross (Hiberno-Saxon) stands in the grounds. It is named after the Earl of Wharncliffe who was the largest landowner in the parish until his holdings were sold at the beginning of the 20th century. Opposite the Wharncliffe is the former Tintagel Hotel, once commonly known as Fry&#x27;s Hotel: this was the terminus for coaches in the days before the railway to Camelford Station and stands on the site of the medieval chapel of St Denys. Near Dunderhole Point on Glebe Cliff stands a building from the former slate quarry that has been used as Tintagel Youth Hostel (managed by YHA) for many years.

===Churches and chapels===

The Church of St Materiana (Tintagel Parish Church) has been Anglican since the English Reformation. It was originally built in Norman times. Writing in 1951, Nikolaus Pevsner was uncertain about the dating and suggests that the Norman work has some Saxon features while the tower may be 13th or 15th century in date. It stands on the cliffs between Trevena and Tintagel Castle and is listed Grade I. The first church on the site was probably in the 6th century, founded as a daughter church of Minster: these are the only churches dedicated to St Materiana though she is usually identified with Madryn, Princess of Gwent. The existing church may be late 11th or early 12th century: the tower is some three centuries later and the most significant change since then was the restoration in 1870 by James Piers St Aubyn. An area of the churchyard was excavated in 1990–91 by the Cornwall Archaeological Unit. There are modern stained glass windows, three modern copies of Old Master paintings, and a Roman milestone (described above under &quot;Antiquities&quot;). The parish war memorial stands at the western end of the churchyard and a modern churchyard cross (c. 1910) near the south entrance.

There was a Norman chapel of St Julitta at the castle, now in ruins, which was excavated in Ralegh Radford&#x27;s excavations. It is a simple rectangular building and the chancel is of a later date than the nave.

In the Middle Ages, there was also a chapel of St Denys at Trevena: the annual fair was therefore celebrated in the week of his feast day (19 October). From 1925 until 2008 part of the Vicarage outbuildings were also in use as a chapel (the Fontevrault Chapel). The name commemorates the abbey in France which held the patronage of Tintagel during the Middle Ages (the commune is now known as Fontevraud-l&#x27;Abbaye), founded by Robert of Arbrissel.
The Methodist Church has chapels at Trevena and Bossiney. Formerly there were more chapels of various Methodist sects (Wesleyans, Bible Christians), including at Trenale and Trewarmett: the Methodist Cemetery is at Trewarmett. Wesleyan Methodism in Tintagel began in 1807 at Trenale and over the next sixty years gained many adherents though divided among a number of sects (Wesleyan Methodist, Methodist Association, Bible Christian): chapels were built at Trevena in 1838 and Bossiney in 1860. In the 1830s and 1840s, the Camelford Wesleyan Methodist circuit, which included Tintagel, underwent a secession by more than half the members to the Wesleyan Methodist Association. The various Methodist churches were united again by the agreements of 1907 and 1932. Mary Toms, a Bible Christian from Tintagel, evangelised parts of the Isle of Wight.

St Paul&#x27;s Church, Tintagel has a thirty-thousand piece mosaic of the saint within its walls. Since January 2008, when the church celebrated its 40th anniversary, a modern-day version of Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s &quot;The Last Supper&quot; by local artist Nicholas St John Rosse has hung above the main altar in the church. It has made international headlines due to its use of modern clothing and local people as the apostles. People from many other countries also come to Tintagel to view the names of their babies who have been lost due to miscarriage, stillbirth or other cause. The names are recorded in the Miscarriage &amp; Infant Loss Memorial Book which is kept at the church.

At Trethevy is the Anglican St Piran&#x27;s Chapel and another Anglican chapel (the church of the Holy Family) is at Treknow.

===Quarrying===
The extensive Tintagel Slate Quarries are largely responsible for the jagged coastline south of Tintagel and stretch all the way to Trebarwith Strand. The quarries were worked from the fifteenth until the early twentieth centuries. The slate was mainly used for roofing and the remains of quarry buildings and machinery strong points can be seen from both sea level and the South West Coast Path. Tintagel&#x27;s youth hostel building formerly housed the office, powerhouse and smithy for Lambshouse quarry. A 19th century engine house still stands above the Prince of Wales quarry and Bowithick quarry is now a waste disposal facility. The only slate quarries in Tintagel that remain operational are Trevillet and Trebarwith Road Rustic Quarry.

==Geography and nature==
===Coastline===
The coastline around Tintagel is significant because it is composed of old Devonian slate; about a mile southwards from Tintagel towards Treknow the coastline was quarried extensively for this hard-wearing roofing surface. Quarries inland at Trebarwith and Trevillet continued to be worked until the mid-20th century. Apart from the island headlands on the coast include Willapark and Start Point.

The turquoise green water around this coast is caused by the slate/sand around Tintagel which contains elements of copper: strong sunlight turns the water a light turquoise green colour in warm weather. The rocks contain various metal ores in small amounts: a few of these were mined in the Victorian period.

Though very near the coast the hill of Condolden (or Kingsdown) is among the very few areas in Cornwall outside Bodmin Moor which exceeds 1000 feet. At Trethevy is the waterfall known as St Nectan&#x27;s Kieve in a wooded valley. The beach at Bossiney Haven is close by and Trebarwith Strand, just half an hour&#x27;s walk south of Tintagel, is one of Cornwall&#x27;s finer beaches, boasting clear seas, golden sands, and superb surf. There is also a small beach at Tintagel Haven immediately north of the castle, as well as a cave known as Merlin&#x27;s Cave under the castle. A stream called the Trerammett River flows from Treven to Tintagel Haven.

The cliffs from Backways Cove, south of Trebarwith Strand to Willapark just to the south of Boscastle are part of the Tintagel Cliffs SSSI (a Site of Special Scientific Interest), designated for both its maritime heaths and geological features. There are also four Geological Conservation Review sites.

Tintagel lies within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). National Trust properties include, besides the Old Post Office in Trevena (see above), fine stretches of the cliffs along the coast including Glebe Cliff, Barras Nose and Penhallick Point. The coastal footpaths include part of the South West Coast Path.

===Birds===
The birds of the coast are well worth observing: in 1935 an anonymous writer mentions Willapark as the scene of spectacular flocks of seabirds (eight species); inland he describes the crows (including the Cornish chough and the raven) and falcons which frequent the district. B. H. Ryves mentions the razorbill as numerous at Tintagel (perhaps the largest colony in the county) and summarises reports from earlier in the century. In 1991, a local bird keeper, Jon Hadwick, published &quot;Owl Light&quot; about his experiences keeping ten owls and a buzzard. In the early days of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds Charles Hambly (also known for saving shipwrecked sailors) was a correspondent for the Society. A hundred years later Harry Sandercock observed that even modern agricultural changes had not reduced the bird populations.

===Plants of the environs of Tintagel===
&quot;Within easy reach of Tintagel at least 385 varieties of flowers, 30 kinds of grasses, and 16 of ferns can be found ... a &#x27;happy hunting ground&#x27; for botanists&quot; and a list of thirty-nine of the rarest is given. (Contribution by E.M.S. to W. J. C. Armstrong&#x27;s &quot;Rambler&#x27;s Guide&quot;, 1935.)

==Social and cultural life==
Tintagel was the venue for the Gorsedh Kernow in 1964.

===Social and sporting activities and associations===
The Social Hall established by Mrs Ruth Homan and the Old School in Fore Street have been the chief meeting places during most of the 20th century. Both the Women&#x27;s Institute and the football and cricket teams are well-supported. Tintagel A.F.C. were champions of Cornwall in 1955–56 and have been in existence over a hundred years; goalkeeper Harry Cann also played for Plymouth Argyle F.C. Until the 1930s there were two golf courses and a few tennis courts: neither golf course reopened in the postwar period. Camelford Rugby Football Club was formed in 2008 and plays its home matches at Parc Tremain, Tintagel. Cornish wrestling tournaments, for prizes, have been held in Tintagel.

The Tintagel Orpheus Male Voice Choir was founded in 1926 by Jack Thomas, a Welshman who worked at Trevillet Quarry. The choir has rehearsed weekly, and performed frequently, ever since.

===Literary associations===
Tintagel is used as a locus for the Arthurian mythos by the poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson in the poem &quot;Idylls of the King&quot; and Algernon Charles Swinburne&#x27;s &quot;Tristram of Lyonesse&quot;, a literary version of the Tristan and Iseult legend. Thomas Hardy&#x27;s &quot;The Famous Tragedy of the Queen of Cornwall at Tintagel in Lyonnesse&quot;, a one-act play which was published in 1923, is another version of the same legend with events set at Tintagel (the book includes an imaginary drawing of Tintagel Castle at the period). Hardy and his first wife visited Tintagel on various occasions: she drew a sketch of the inside of the church as it was about 1867. It is very prominent in the books in Fay Sampson&#x27;s &quot;Daughter of Tintagel&quot; series of Arthurian novels (later retitled &quot;Morgan le Fay&quot;).

The novelist Dinah Craik visited Tintagel in 1883 and published an informative account of her journey through Cornwall the following year. William Howitt&#x27;s visit was quite different: his account is called &quot;A day-dream at Tintagel&quot; (in &quot;Visits to Remarkable Places&quot;). Relatively few works of fiction have Tintagel as a setting: these include Anthony Trollope&#x27;s short story &quot;Malachi&#x27;s Cove&quot; and the Charles and Alice Muriel Williamson&#x27;s epistolary novel &quot;Set in Silver&quot; published in 1909. Ernest George Henham was a novelist resident in Devon who used the pseudonym John Trevena for many of his books; it is probable that the surname he chose was derived from the original name for Tintagel, though his writings are concerned mainly with Devon. Tintagel features prominently in Edith Wharton&#x27;s final, unfinished novel, &quot;The Buccaneers&quot;, the protagonist of which, Nan St. George, meets her future husband, the Duke of Tintagel, while exploring the ruins of Tintagel Castle. Wharton styled the characters as Duke and Duchess of Tintagel, while Tintagel actually lies within the Duchy of Cornwall; in the novel, the Duke and Duchess live in a newer, fictional Tintagel Castle, built in approximately the late 18th century.

===Musical and film associations===
Arnold Bax was inspired to compose his symphonic poem &quot;Tintagel&quot; after a visit to the village. Edward Elgar also composed while on a visit to Tintagel.

The film &quot;Knights of the Round Table&quot; had some sequences filmed near Tintagel Castle with local people as extras: this was in 1953 though it was not released until 1954. Some other filming has been carried out in Tintagel, e.g. &quot;Malachi&#x27;s Cove&quot; at Trebarwith. The exterior of the Camelot Castle Hotel was used to portray Dr. Seward&#x27;s asylum in the 1979 film &quot;Dracula&quot;. The Youth Hostel doubled for the coastguard station in the 1981 BBC serial &quot;The Nightmare Man&quot;.

==Notable people==
The Earls and Dukes of Cornwall (to whom the castle belonged) were never resident at Tintagel though a few of them are known to have visited. From 1552 to 1832, Tintagel was a parliamentary borough (generally known as the Borough of Bossiney) sending two members to the House of Commons; these included Sir Francis Drake, Sir Simon Harcourt and James Stuart-Wortley, 1st Baron Wharncliffe. During the same period, there were also mayors of the borough of whom the best known is William Wade (fl. 1756–1786). Contemporaries of Mayor Wade were the Rev. Arthur Wade (vicar 1770–1810) and Charles Chilcott (d. 1815) (known for his gigantic stature). The Rev. R. B. Kinsman (vicar 1851–1894) was also honorary constable of the castle.

During the 19th century, Tintagel was visited by many writers, including Robert Stephen Hawker, Charles Dickens, Alfred Tennyson, Thomas Hardy, and the mystic philosopher Rudolf Steiner. It was also the occasional residence of John Douglas Cook, founder editor of the &quot;Saturday Review&quot; (d. 1868) who is buried at Tintagel. He bought Trevena House as an occasional residence: it later became the front part of King Arthur&#x27;s Hall (see ).

Henry George White, the village schoolmaster for many years, was also a prolific amateur painter. The Very Rev. Cliff Piper, Dean of Moray, Ross and Caithness was born at Tintagel.

<text>The Anglo–Dutch Wars () were mainly fought between the Dutch Republic and England (later Kingdom of Great Britain) on the offshore island of Great Britain in the mid-17th and late 18th century. The first three wars occurred in the second half of the 17th century over trade and colonies, while the fourth conflict was fought a century later. Almost all the battles were naval engagements.

The English had minor successes in the first war, while the Dutch were successful in the second and third. However, in the century between the third and fourth war, the English / British Royal Navy had become the most powerful maritime force in the world for the next three hundred years, while the Dutch navy had fallen to fourth position, behind the navies of France and Spain.

== Background ==

The English and the Dutch were both participants in the 16th century European religious conflicts during the Reformation period between the Roman Catholic House of Habsburg and the opposing Protestant states. At the same time, as the Age of Exploration dawned in the West, the Dutch and English both sought profits overseas in the New World of the recently discovered continents of the Americas.

=== Dutch Republic ===
In the early 1600s, the Dutch, while continuing to fight the Eighty Years&#x27; War (1566/68-1648), with the Habsburgs, also began to carry out long-distance exploration by sea. The Dutch innovation in the trading of shares in a joint-stock company allowed them to finance expeditions with stock subscriptions sold in the United Provinces of the Netherlands and in London. They founded colonies in North America, India, and the East Indies. They also enjoyed continued success in privateering – in 1628 Admiral Piet Heyn became the only commander to successfully capture a large Spanish treasure fleet. With the many long voyages by Dutch East Indiamen cargo vessels, their society built an officer class and institutional knowledge that would later be replicated in England, principally by the British East India Company.

By the middle of the 17th century, the Dutch joined the Portuguese and their Portuguese Empire as the main European traders in Asia. This coincided with the enormous growth of the Dutch merchant fleet, made possible by the cheap mass production of the fluyt sailing ship types. Soon the Dutch had one of Europe&#x27;s largest mercantile fleets, with more merchant ships than all other nations combined, and possessed a dominant position in the Baltic maritime trade of 1400-1800 in the Baltic Sea to the northeast.

In 1648 the Dutch concluded the Peace of Münster with the Kingdom of Spain. Due to the division of powers in the Dutch Republic, the army and navy were the main base of power of the Stadtholder, although the budget allocated to them was set by the States General. With the arrival of peace, the States General decided to decommission most of the Dutch military. This led to conflict between the major Dutch cities and the new Stadtholder, William II of Orange, bringing the internal controversies in the Republic to the brink of civil war. The Stadtholder&#x27;s unexpected death in 1650 only added to the political tensions.

=== England ===

==== Tudor dynasty====
In the 16th century, Queen Elizabeth I (a.k.a. Elizabeth the Great, 1533-1603, reigned 1558-1603), commissioned several privateers to carry out long-range attacks against the Spanish Empire&#x27;s global interests, exemplified by the attacks by Sir Francis Drake (c.1540-1596), William Parker, and other Elizabethan sea dogs on Spanish merchant shipping and colonial possessions. Partly to provide a pretext for ongoing hostilities against Spain, Queen Elizabeth assisted the Dutch Revolt (1581) against the Kingdom of Spain by signing the Treaty of Nonsuch in 1585 with the newly-established Dutch state / republic of the United Provinces.

==== Stuart ====

After the death of Elizabeth I, Anglo-Spanish relations began to improve under the new monarch of James the First, and the peace of the Treaty of London in 1604 ended most privateering actions, (until the outbreak of the next Anglo-Spanish War (1625-1630) during the larger continental Thirty Years&#x27; War of 1618-1648). Underfunding then led to neglect of the Royal Navy.

Later, Roman Catholic sympathiser King Charles I of England made a number of secret agreements with Spain, directed against Dutch sea power. He also embarked on a major programme of naval reconstruction, enforcing ship money to rebuild and expand the Royal Navy with financing the building of such prestige battle vessels as the . But fearful of endangering his relations with the powerful Dutch stadtholder Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange, his assistance to Spain was limited in practice to allowing Spanish troops on their way to Dunkirk to make use of English shipping. However, in 1639, when a large Spanish transport fleet sought refuge in The Downs anchorage off the town of Deal, Kent, King Charles chose not to protect it against a Dutch attack; the resulting Battle of the Downs undermined both Spanish sea power and Charles&#x27;s reputation in Spain.

Meanwhile, in the New World of the Americas, forces from the Dutch New Netherlands colony and the English Massachusetts Bay Colony contested over much of North America&#x27;s north-eastern seaboard.

==== Cromwell ====

The outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642 (to 1651), began a period in which the Kingdom of England&#x27;s naval position was severely weakened. Its navy was internally divided, though its officers tended to favour the parliamentary side; after the execution by public beheading of King Charles I in 1649, however, Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell (1599-1658, served 1653-1658), was able to unite his country into the republican Commonwealth of England. He then revamped the English navy by expanding the number of ships, promoting officers on merit rather than family connections, and cracking down on embezzlement by suppliers and dockyard staff, thereby positioning England to mount a global challenge to Dutch mercantile dominance.

The mood in England grew increasingly belligerent towards the Dutch. This partly stemmed from old perceived slights: the Dutch were considered to have shown themselves ungrateful for the aid they had received against the Spanish by growing stronger than their former English protectors; Dutch fishermen caught most of the herring off the English east coast in the North Sea; the Dutch East India Company had driven English traders out of the East Indies; and Dutch merchants vociferously appealed to the principle of free trade to circumvent taxation in English colonies. There were also new points of conflict: with the decline of Spanish power at the end of the Thirty Years&#x27; War in 1648, the colonial possessions of the Portuguese Empire (already in the midst of the Portuguese Restoration War, 1640-1668) and perhaps even those of the greater Spanish Empire itself were up for grabs.

Cromwell feared the influence of both the Orangist faction at home and English royalists exiled to the Republic; the Stadtholders had supported the Stuart monarchs—William II of Orange had married the daughter of Charles I of England in 1641—and they abhorred the trial and execution of Charles I.

Early in 1651 Cromwell tried to ease tensions by sending a delegation to The Hague proposing that the Dutch Republic join the Commonwealth and assist the English in conquering most of Spanish America for its extremely valuable resources. This attempt to draw the Dutch into a lopsided alliance with England in fact led to war: the ruling faction in the States of Holland was unable to formulate an answer to this unexpected offer and the pro-Stuart Orangists incited mobs to harass Cromwell&#x27;s envoys. When the delegation returned home, the Parliament of England decided to pursue a policy of confrontation.

== Wars ==

=== First war: 1652–1654 ===

As a result of Cromwell&#x27;s ambitious programme of naval expansion, at a time when the Dutch admiralties were selling off many of their own warships, the English came to possess a greater number of larger and more powerful purpose-built warships than their rivals across the North Sea did. However, the Dutch had many more merchant ships, together with lower freight rates, better financing and a wider range of manufactured goods to sell – although Dutch ships were blocked by the Spanish from operations in most of southern Europe, along the coasts of the 
Mediterranean Sea, giving the English an advantage there.

To protect English commercial interests in North America, in October 1651 the English Parliament passed the first of the Navigation Acts, which mandated that all goods imported into England must be carried by English ships or vessels from the exporting countries, thus excluding (mostly Dutch) middlemen. Agitation among the Dutch merchants as a result of the Navigation Acts was further increased by Admiral Sir George Ayscue&#x27;s (1616-1652) capture in early 1652 of 27 Dutch merchant ships illegally trading with the English still royalist colony of Barbados in the West Indies islands chain of the Americas, in contravention of an embargo imposed by the Parliamentarians. The Dutch responded to the growing tensions by enlisting large numbers of armed merchantmen into their navy. In 1652, Lord Protector Cromwell required all foreign warships in the North Sea or the English Channel to lower their colours when encountering English warships. On 29 May 1652, Lieutenant-Admiral Maarten Tromp (1598-1653), refused to lower the colours of his ships after encountering an English fleet led by General at Sea Robert Blake (1598-1657). This resulted in a skirmish, the Battle of Dover, off-shore of Dover, England in the English Channel in 1652, after which the Commonwealth of England then declared war on the Dutch Republic on 10 July.

After some inconclusive minor fights the English were successful in the first major battle, with Blake defeating the Dutch Vice-Admiral Witte de With (1599-1658), in the Battle of the Kentish Knock in October 1652. Believing that the war was all but over, the English divided their forces and in December were routed by the fleet of Lieutenant-Admiral Maarten Tromp at the Battle of Dungeness in the English Channel. The Dutch were also victorious in March 1653, at the Battle of Leghorn near Italy and had gained effective control of both the Mediterranean and the English Channel. Blake, recovering from an injury, rethought, together with Duke of Albemarle George Monck (1608-1670), the whole system of naval tactics, and after the winter of 1653 used the line of battle, first to drive the Dutch navy out of the English Channel in the Battle of Portland and then out of the North Sea in the Battle of the Gabbard. The Dutch were unable to effectively resist as the States General of the Netherlands had not in time heeded the warnings of their admirals that much larger warships were needed.

In the final Battle of Scheveningen on 10 August 1653, Tromp was killed, a blow to Dutch morale, but the English had to end their blockade of the Dutch coast. As both nations were by now exhausted and Cromwell had dissolved the aggressive warlike Rump Parliament, ongoing peace negotiations could be brought to fruition, albeit after many months of slow diplomatic exchanges. The war ended on 5 April 1654, with the signing of the Treaty of Westminster of 1654 (ratified by the States General on 8 May), but the commercial rivalry was not resolved, the English having failed to replace the Dutch as the world&#x27;s dominant trade nation. The treaty contained a secret annex, the Act of Seclusion, forbidding the infant Prince William III of Orange (future King William III of England) from becoming also the Dutch stadtholder of the province of Holland, which would prove to be a future cause of discontent. In 1653 the Dutch had started a major naval expansion programme of their own, building sixty larger vessels, partly closing the qualitative gap with the English naval fleet. Cromwell, having already started the Anglo-Spanish War against Spain in 1654 without Dutch help, during his rule then avoided a new conflict with the fellow Republic on the continent, even though the Dutch in the same time period defeated his Portuguese and Swedish allies.

=== Second war: 1665–1667 ===

After the English Restoration in 1660, newly-crowned King Charles II tried through diplomatic means to make his nephew, Prince William III of Orange, stadtholder of the Dutch Republic. At the same time, Charles promoted a series of mercantilist policies aimed at encountering Dutch mercantile dominance, which again led to a renewed deterioration in Anglo-Dutch relations. This subsequently led to a surge of anti-Dutch sentiment in England, the country being, as Samuel Pepys put it, &quot;mad for war&quot;. English merchants and chartered overseas mercantile trade companies—such as the East India Company, the Royal Adventurers Trading into Africa, and the Levant Company—calculated that global economic primacy could now be wrestled away from the Dutch. They reckoned that a combination of naval battles and irregular privateering missions would cripple the Dutch Republic and force the States General to agree to a more favourable peace. The plan was for English ships to be replenished, and sailors paid, with looted booty seized from captured Dutch merchant vessels returning from overseas.

In 1665 many Dutch merchantman ships were captured, and Dutch trade and industry were hurt. The English achieved several victories over the Dutch, such as taking the Dutch colony of New Netherland and seaport town of New Amsterdam (present day of later renamed New York) by an English fleet of King Charles&#x27; younger brother, the future King James II; but there were also several Dutch victories, such as the capture of the renewed Royal Navy flagship &quot;Prince Royal&quot; during the Four Days Battle at sea of 11 to 14 of June 1666-the subject of a famous painting by Willem van de Velde (1633-1707). Dutch maritime trade recovered from 1666, while the English war effort and economy suffered a downturn when London was ravaged by disease in the Great Plague during 1665-1666, and much of the capital of the City of London along the Thames River was burnt to the ground by the massive devastating infamous Great Fire of London of September 1666, (which was generally interpreted across the English Channel in the Dutch Republic as divine retribution for the earlier Holmes&#x27;s Bonfire raid in August 1666).

A surprise attack in June 1667, the raid on the Medway, on the English fleet in its home port arguably won the war for the Dutch; British historian C. R. Boxer described it as one of the &quot;most humiliating defeat suffered by British arms&quot;. A flotilla of ships led by Michiel de Ruyter (1607-1676), sailed westward up the Thames River and Thames Estuary, on a daring raid, broke through the defences guarding Chatham Harbour, set fire to several English warships moored there, and even towed away the and the , flagship and second largest warship of the Royal Navy. Also in June 1667, the Dutch sailed vessels on a raiding expedition from the Caribbean north into the Hampton Roads harbor at the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay in the Battle of the James River, near the modern-day Hampton and Norfolk seaports of the English Colony of Virginia, destroying an English ship in the harbour and bombarding its coastal protecting fort. The raid on the Medway led to widespread anger in England towards the government. This, together with the mounting costs of the war and the extravagant spending of the returned King Charles&#x27;s court, produced a rebellious atmosphere in London. Charles ordered the English envoys at Breda to sign a peace quickly with the Dutch, as he feared an open revolt at home against him.

=== Third war: 1672–1674 ===

Soon the Royal Navy was rebuilt. After the events of the previous war, English public opinion was unenthusiastic about starting a new one. However, as he was bound by the secret Treaty of Dover, Charles II was obliged to assist Louis XIV in his attack on the Dutch Republic in the Franco-Dutch War. When the Royal French Army was halted by the Hollandic Water Line (a defence system involving strategic flooding), an attempt was made to invade the Dutch Republic by sea. De Ruyter won a series of strategic victories against the Anglo-French fleet and prevented an invasion of the Dutch Republic. After these failures, the English parliament forced Charles to make peace.

=== Fourth war: 1780–1784 ===

In 1688, the Dutch feared that England might align with France in the upcoming Nine Years&#x27; War, potentially repeating the crisis of 1672. To prevent this, William of Orange, making use of an invitation from seven influential and discontented Englishmen, led a Dutch invasion force that landed at Torbay in Devon. From there, he marched on London and successfully deposed James II of England. While occupying London with his troops William was placed on the English throne, on the basis of the Bill of Rights, alongside his English wife Mary. His reign ended further Anglo-Dutch conflicts and both states joined forces to fight the expansionist policies of Louis XIV of France. Though remaining allies, England (and after 1707, Great Britain) quickly surpassed the Dutch in military and economic power. From roughly 1720 onwards, Dutch economic growth experienced a significant decline, and in 1780, the &quot;per capita&quot; gross national income of Britain surpassed their Dutch counterparts, leading to rising levels of resentment from the latter.

The Diplomatic Revolution brought this to light and during the following Seven Years&#x27; War the Dutch remained neutral. When Britain&#x27;s North American colonies revolted against British rule in 1776, the Dutch provided indirect support to the rebels, angering the British, who eventually declared war on the Dutch in 1780. By this point, the Dutch navy had severely weakened, possessing only 20 ships of the line. The conflict consisted mostly of a series of successful British operations against Dutch colonial interests, though one fleet action took place at the battle of Dogger Bank on 5 August 1781, which was indecisive. The war ended in a conclusive British victory and exposed the weakness of the political and economic foundations of the Dutch Republic, leading to instability and revolution.

=== Later wars ===
During the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, France reduced the Netherlands to a satellite state and finally annexed the country in 1810. In 1797 the Dutch fleet was defeated by the British in the Battle of Camperdown, but an Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland in 1799 was less successful. France still considered both the extant Dutch fleet and the large Dutch shipbuilding capacity very important assets. The Dutch navy was supposed to take part in the planned invasion of the United Kingdom. To this end a large flotilla of flat-bottomed boats was built in the Batavian Republic, that had to be transported over sea to Boulogne. This was successful, but after the Battle of Trafalgar France gave up its attempt to match the British fleet, despite a strong Dutch lobby to this effect.

Britain also invaded several Dutch colonies, firstly in the Americas - Essequibo was captured in 1803 and Suriname was taken the following year. Following their victory at Trafalgar, Britain was now able to strike Dutch colonies elsewhere at will. The Cape Colony was captured in Southern Africa in January 1806. The Dutch territories in the Caribbean were all taken by 1807 including the largest island, Curaçao. The Dutch East Indies was the only area left to be taken. Starting with the first Java campaign of 1806–1807 which saw the Royal Navy defeating the Dutch fleets to ensure British dominance in the region.

After the incorporation of the Netherlands in the French Empire in 1810, the British that year captured the Spice Islands during a six-month campaign. A year later saw the final conquest of the Dutch East Indies with the seizure of the whole of Java during a month-long campaign. With the signing of the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814, Britain returned all those colonies to the new Kingdom of the Netherlands, with the exception of the Cape, Ceylon, and part of Dutch Guyana. Some historians count the wars between Britain and the Batavian Republic and the Kingdom of Holland during the Napoleonic era as the Fifth and Sixth Anglo-Dutch wars.

<text>The Second Anglo-Dutch War, began on 4 March 1665, and concluded with the signing of the Treaty of Breda on 31 July 1667. It was one in a series of naval wars between England and the Dutch Republic, driven largely by commercial disputes.

Despite several major battles, neither side was able to score a decisive victory, and by the end of 1666 the war had reached stalemate. Peace talks made little progress until the Dutch Raid on the Medway in June 1667 forced Charles II to agree to the Treaty of Breda.

By eliminating a number of long-standing issues, the terms eventually made it possible for England and the Dutch Republic to unite against the expansionist policies pursued by Louis XIV of France. In the short-term however, Charles&#x27; desire to avenge this setback led to the Third Anglo-Dutch War in 1672.

== Background ==
Despite similar ideologies, commercial disputes and political differences between the Dutch Republic and Commonwealth of England led to the 1652 to 1654 First Anglo-Dutch War. The treaty that ended the war failed to address these issues, which included Dutch opposition to the 1651 Navigation Acts, and English objections to Dutch trading monopolies. Even when the two countries were at peace, competition for markets in the East Indies and elsewhere often resulted in conflict outside Europe. For various reasons, factions in both countries hampered efforts to reach resolution through diplomatic means.

From 1650 to 1672, Dutch politics was dominated by the States Party and their leader, Grand pensionary Johan de Witt. Despite suspicions about Charles II&#x27;s links to their Orangist opponents, de Witt viewed the 1660 Stuart Restoration as an opportunity to rebuild relationships. He hoped to negotiate overlapping defensive agreements with England and France to ensure peace, and continued Dutch economic dominance.

However, the English saw little benefit in preserving this system, and wanted concessions the Dutch were not prepared to grant. When merchants in the City of London demanded increased Protectionism, Charles II renewed the Navigation Acts in August 1660, then strengthened them further in 1663. Parliament claimed they were simply responding to measures taken by the Dutch East India Company, or VOC, to enforce its monopolies in Asia, and by the Dutch West India Company, or WIC, in West Africa.

For Charles, expanding the economy was another way to reduce his financial dependence on Parliament, preferably using royal monopolies or charters to do so. In 1660, he and his brother James founded the Royal African Company, or RAC, whose purpose was to challenge Dutch dominance of the Atlantic slave trade. Investors included senior politicians such as George Carteret, Shaftesbury and Arlington, creating a strong link between the RAC and government policy.

The Atlantic trade was a three way process, whereby slaves from West Africa were transported to Sugar plantations in the Caribbean, which in turn were supplied by colonies in North America. These links meant conflict in one region often led to fighting in all three. In August 1664, the English first occupied New Netherland, renamed New York City, then took WIC slaving posts in modern Guinea. When these were recaptured by a Dutch fleet under Michiel de Ruyter in early 1665, the RAC was forced into bankruptcy, and its influential investors saw war as the best way to recoup their losses.

In taking these actions, the Dutch were reassured by their 1662 defensive treaty with France, under which Louis XIV agreed to provide military support if they were attacked by England. In return, the Dutch undertook not to interfere with French actions in the Spanish Netherlands, but by 1664, many were concerned by the prospect of having an expansionist France as a neighbour, rather than a weakened Spain. Although it provided another reason to agree terms with England, negotiations made little progress. This was partially due to the complexity of the Dutch political system, which made it difficult to reach consensus between the different provinces and powerful trade groups like the VOC. It also reflected de Witt&#x27;s belief Parliament would not approve funds for an expensive naval war, a view shared by many English politicians, including Charles&#x27; chief minister Lord Clarendon.

For his part, Louis XIV feared an Anglo-Dutch conflict might draw in Spain or the Holy Roman Empire, and impede his efforts to acquire the Spanish Netherlands. He therefore tried to mediate between the two, or at least limit conflict to Africa and the Americas, which would not require France to become involved. Aware of his reluctance, Charles II saw no reason to make concessions, while Sir George Downing, his Ambassador in The Hague, claimed recent financial losses meant the Dutch could not afford a war. Other advisors argued the Franco-Dutch treaty only applied to defensive actions, so provoking the Dutch into declaring war would give Louis XIV the chance to remain neutral. Following English attacks on convoys off Cadiz and in the English Channel, the Dutch declared war on 4 March 1665.

===Opposing forces and tactics===
Some historians argue that just as the tactics used by 17th century armies were transformed by the Military Revolution, the Anglo-Dutch Wars marked a similar change in naval practice. The ships on either side have been described as the &quot;most advanced, complex, expensive and manpower-intensive weapons systems of their day&quot;. With the fleets involved increasing to over 100 ships per side, maximising firepower required greater levels of organisation, discipline and co-ordination. One solution to these problems was the Line of battle formation.

In 1664, the Royal Navy issued new &quot;Fighting Instructions&quot;, formalising the &quot;line of battle&quot; as standard practice. They also established a signalling system allowing commanders to control their fleets, something the Dutch then lacked. Over the course of the war, the formation was employed by both, although it better suited the heavier ships used by the Royal Navy, and its emphasis on gunnery to sink opponents. The Dutch preferred the use of boarding, with individual ships fighting one another.

Difficulties in communicating orders meant during combat many captains focused on avoiding collisions rather than engaging the enemy, making battles chaotic and often indecisive. In addition, both navies consisted of significant numbers of purpose-built warships, bulked out by private merchantmen. Although many of the latter were well-armed, they were often less capable of standing up to sustained fire. Dutch merchant ships were particularly vulnerable to the larger English warships.

Based on lessons learned from the First Anglo-Dutch War, post-1653 the Dutch navy was re-organised around sixty-four newly built and larger Ships of the line, each with between 40 and 60 guns. However, they remained inferior to English vessels such as , which carried over 100 guns. In 1664, it was decided to create a new core of even heavier ships, which were mostly still under construction when fighting began in 1665. Stronger finances allowed the Dutch to complete these plus another twenty during the war, compared to only a dozen built by England.

Although the Royal Navy was superior in ships and leadership at the beginning of the war, these advantages were gradually eroded by Parliament&#x27;s reluctance to fund it. Downing, and other observers who argued the Dutch could not afford a war, overlooked recent reforms that improved their credit, and made it relatively easy to raise money. In contrast, English expectations that profits from Dutch ships captured by privateers would cover costs proved unfounded. In December 1664, Parliament approved £2.5 million in taxes for the navy, but much of this was spent on essential repairs, or allegedly stolen by officials. To fund operations, Charles had to rely on short-term loans from the City of London, at ever increasing interest rates. By the end of 1666, lack of money led him to discharge most of the fleet, with disastrous results.

==War==
===Europe; 1665===
Both sides planned a short war, since the English could not afford a long one, while the Dutch wanted to minimise any potential economic damage. De Witt ordered his naval commander Jacob van Wassenaer to bring the English fleet to battle, although his ships were inferior in organisation, training, discipline and firepower. At the Battle of Lowestoft on 13 June 1665, the Dutch navy suffered the worst defeat in its history, losing some sixteen ships. Most of the fleet escaped, but over 30% of its personnel were killed or captured, with van Wassenaer himself among the dead.

Defeat led to an extensive overhaul of Dutch tactics and command structures, with several captains either executed for alleged cowardice, or dismissed. In July, Michiel de Ruyter became the new commander in chief, and followed the English in formalising the line battle formation. Dutch finances also received a boost when the VOC Spice Fleet returned home safely after the battle of Vågen. This was offset when the eastern province of Overijssel was over-run by troops from Münster under Christoph Bernhard von Galen, who was backed by English subsidies.

Münster&#x27;s invasion threatened to involve Germany in the fighting, and thus provide an excuse for Emperor Leopold to intervene. Concerned by this, Louis sent French soldiers to prevent supplies reaching von Galen&#x27;s troops. Reports Charles was negotiating an alliance with Spain meant he also stepped up attempts to mediate a settlement, but the English in general remained deeply suspicious of French intentions. Although the Dutch offered to renounce their territorial claims in North America, and cede three West African posts, success at Lowestoft prompted Charles to demand further concessions and a Dutch agreement to bear the costs of the war. In December 1665, Louis withdrew his ambassadors from London, signalling his intention to declare war.

Downing now contacted the Orangist party in Overijssel, which had suffered severely from von Galen&#x27;s invasion, asking that they demand the States General make peace with England. De Witt&#x27;s position was too strong for this to succeed, and on 11 December he declared the only acceptable peace terms were a return to the &quot;status quo ante bellum&quot;, or a quick end to hostilities under a &quot;uti possidetis&quot; clause.

===Europe; 1666===
On 16 January 1666, Louis declared war on England. In return for a large French subsidy, Denmark–Norway did the same in February, effectively closing the Baltic trade to English ships, and with it access to vital naval supplies. The payments promised to von Galen by Charles largely failed to materialise, and when Brandenburg-Prussia threatened to attack Münster, he made peace with the Republic at Cleves in April.

Anglo-Dutch negotiations had progressed far enough that de Witt invited Charles II to start formal negotiations. Talks made little progress, as both sides felt they were negotiating from a position of strength. Despite the French declaration of war, Charles knew Louis wanted to avoid being dragged into the conflict, and through informal correspondence was aware he considered Dutch demands excessive. By now, the French king had also concluded the Dutch would never voluntarily make the concessions he required in the Spanish Netherlands, and began planning the 1667 War of Devolution.

On the other hand, Dutch morale rose with the completion of thirty new warships, most carrying up to 72 guns, heavier than any available in early 1665. They were supposed to link up with a French naval force in the English Channel, giving them a significant numerical advantage. However, most of the French ships were based in the Mediterranean Sea, and despite leaving Toulon in April, delays meant they failed to arrive in time. One contemporary diplomat suggested the relatively new and inexperienced French navy did so deliberately, being &quot;dismayed by the difficulties of the enterprise&quot;.

Nevertheless, the threat of French intervention forced the English to send a detachment to block the Strait of Dover, leaving 60 ships facing a Dutch fleet of around 84. In the initial stages of the Four Days&#x27; Battle, fought from 11 to 15 June, the Dutch inflicted heavy damage on their opponents, before the return of the detached squadron forced them to withdraw. The English lost ten ships compared to only four Dutch, but any hope the Royal Navy was too damaged to renew hostilities soon proved incorrect.

After extensive repairs, the English fleet put to sea again and confronted the Dutch in the St. James&#x27;s Day Battle of 4 and 5 August. Generally considered an English victory, it ultimately had little strategic value. Although the Dutch suffered heavy casualties and many ships were badly damaged, their fleet remained intact, while lack of money meant the English could scarcely afford to pay their sailors or purchase supplies. A more significant economic loss occurred on 19 August, when up to 150 Dutch merchantmen sheltering in the Vlie estuary were destroyed in an action known as Holmes&#x27;s Bonfire.

Over a period of eighteen months from 1665 to 1666, the Great Plague of London killed more than a quarter of its population. In September 1666, the Fire of London destroyed much of the city, causing huge economic damage, and public opinion now turned against the war. Charles could no longer rely on London merchants to supply the loans needed to fund it, and the Navy Board was forced to discharge many sailors unpaid.

Parliament was recalled for the first time in a year, and approved new taxes of £1.8 million. However, their payment was subject to various conditions, and disputes over these meant delays in its collection. Lack of money made it almost impossible to plan naval operations for 1667.

===Europe; 1667===

By early 1667, lack of funds meant much of the Royal Navy was laid up at the naval base of Chatham. Only a small &quot;Flying Fleet&quot; was operational, leaving English merchant shipping vulnerable to Dutch attack. Since Charles refused to make the concessions to Parliament which would allow him to continue the war, his only option was to initiate peace talks, which began in March at Breda. As England was also now at war with France, Charles sent envoys to Paris for unofficial preliminary talks.

The deterioration of Franco-Dutch relations meant these talks produced a third option not considered by Clarendon: a secret alliance with France. In April, Charles concluded his first secret treaty with Louis, stipulating England would not oppose a French conquest of the Spanish Netherlands. In May, the French invaded, starting the War of Devolution. By stalling the talks at Breda, Charles hoped to gain concessions from the Dutch, using the French advance as leverage.

Aware of Charles&#x27;s general intentions, although not of the secret treaty, de Witt decided to attempt to end the war with a single stroke. The Dutch navy had made a special study of amphibious operations, with the Dutch Marine Corps established in 1665. After the Four Days&#x27; Battle, a marine contingent had been ready to land in Kent or Essex following a possible Dutch victory at sea. The Dutch fleet was, however, unable to force a safe passage into the Thames as navigational buoys had been removed and a strong English squadron was ready to dispute their passage. With no English ships available to oppose a similar attack, de Witt planned to land marines at Chatham and destroy the ships there.
In June, De Ruyter, with Cornelis de Witt supervising, launched the Dutch raid on the Medway at the mouth of the River Thames. After capturing the fort at Sheerness, the Dutch fleet went on to break through the massive chain protecting the entrance to the Medway and, on the 13th, attacked the laid up English fleet.

The raid had a substantial impact on English public opinion and remains one of the biggest disasters in Royal Navy history. Fifteen smaller ships were either destroyed or sunk as blockships by the English, with another three major warships burnt, &quot;Royal Oak&quot;, &quot;Loyal London&quot; and &quot;Royal James&quot;. , was taken to the Netherlands as a trophy, although the Dutch failed to inflict substantial damage on the Chatham dockyards. In response, Clarendon ordered his envoys at Breda to agree terms without further delay, as Charles feared open revolt.

=== War in the Caribbean ===
In early 1665 Michiel de Ruyter raided the Caribbean. In late 1665 an English force, mainly consisting of buccaneers under the command of Lieutenant-colonel Edward Morgan, the Deputy Governor of Jamaica, assisted by his nephew Thomas Morgan, quickly captured the Dutch islands of Sint Eustatius and Saba. After his uncle&#x27;s death in December 1665, Thomas Morgan was appointed as governor of these two islands. Also in late 1665, an English force from Jamaica and Barbados captured the Dutch possession of Tobago. The French declaration of war on the side of the Dutch altered the balance of power in the Caribbean and facilitated a Dutch counterattack. The first successes of the new allies were the French recapture of Tobago in August 1666, a joint Franco-Dutch recapture of Sint Eustatius in November 1666 and a French capture of the English island of Antigua in the same month. The arrival of a French squadron under Joseph-Antoine de La Barre in January 1667 allowed the French to occupy the English half of St Kitts and Montserrat, leaving only Nevis of the Leeward Islands in English hands, together with Jamaica and Barbados to the west.

A Dutch force under Admiral Abraham Crijnssen, organised by the province of Zeeland, not the States General, arrived at Cayenne in February 1667 and captured Suriname from the English in the same month. Crijnssen delayed in Suriname until April, then sailed to Tobago, which had been vacated by the French after expelling the English garrison, where he rebuilt the fort and left a small garrison. Although Crijnssen was instructed not to delay, it was not until early May that he and de La Barre combined forces, agreeing to a Franco-Dutch invasion of Nevis, which sailed on 17 May 1667. However, their attack was repelled in the Battle of Nevis on 17 May by a smaller English force. This confused naval action was the only one in this war where all three navies fought: it failed largely through de la Barre&#x27;s incompetence. After this failed attack, Crijnssen left in disgust and sailed to the north to attack the Virginia colony, while the French, under de la Barre, moved to Martinique. The Battle of Nevis restored English naval control in the Caribbean and allowed the early recapture of Antigua and Montserrat and an unsuccessful attack on St Kitts soon after.

In April, a new English squadron of nine warships and two fireships under the command of Rear-Admiral Sir John Harman sailed for the West Indies, reaching them in early June. Harman encountered the French with seven larger and 14 smaller warships and three fireships under la Barre anchored under the batteries of Fort St Pierre, Martinique. He attacked on 6 July and sunk, burnt or captured all but two of the French ships. With the French fleet neutralised, Harman then attacked the French at Cayenne on 15 September forcing its garrison to surrender. The English fleet then went on to recapture Fort Zeelandia in Suriname in October. News of these English victories only reached England in September, after the Treaty of Breda had been signed, and possessions captured after 31 July had to be returned. Crijnssen sailed back to the Caribbean only to find the French fleet destroyed and the English back in possession of Suriname.

==Aftermath==
=== Treaty of Breda ===
On 31 July 1667, what is generally known as the Treaty of Breda concluded peace between England and the Netherlands. Under normal cirumstances the Dutch victory in the Medway would probably have been followed by new demands, but the large scale French invasion of the Spanish Netherlands meant that the English came off lightly. Fears of growing French power meant that Johan de Witt and many of his fellow Dutch &quot;regenten&quot; preferred a quick end to the war with the English.

The treaty allowed the English to keep possession of New Netherland, while the Dutch kept control over Pulau Run, Fort Cormantin and the valuable sugar plantations of Suriname, while also regaining Tobago, St Eustatius, and its West African trading posts. This &quot;uti possidetis&quot; solution was later confirmed in the Treaty of Westminster. The Act of Navigation was modified in favour of the Dutch by England agreeing to treat Germany as part of the Netherlands&#x27; commercial hinterland, so that Dutch ships would now be allowed to carry German goods to English ports. The English were also forced to accept the Dutch &#x27;Free Ship, Free Goods&#x27; principle.

On the same date and also at Breda, a public treaty was concluded between England and France that stipulated the return to England of the former English part of St Christopher and the islands of Antigua and Montserrat, all of which the French had occupied in the war, and that England should surrender its claim to Acadia to France, although the extent of Acadia was not defined. This public treaty had been preceded by a secret treaty signed on 17 April in which, in addition to these exchanges of territory, Louis and Charles agreed not to enter into alliances opposed to the interests of the other, by which Louis secured the neutrality of England in the war he planned against Spain.

The order of priorities whereby the Dutch preferred to give up what would become a major part of the United States, and instead retain a tropical colony, would seem strange by present-day standards. However, in the 17th century tropical colonies producing agricultural products which could not be grown in Europe were deemed more valuable than ones with a climate similar to that of Europe where Europeans could settle in comfort.

The peace was generally seen as a personal triumph for Johan de Witt and an embarrassment to the Orangists, who seemed reluctant to support the war and eager to accept a disadvantageous early peace. The Republic was jubilant about the Dutch victory. De Witt used the occasion to induce four provinces to adopt the Perpetual Edict of 1667 abolishing the stadtholderate forever. However, De Witt also faced criticism. The war exposed a severe neglect of the Dutch army, which had struggled to repel the invasion of the Bishop of Münster. The situation only shifted in the Republic&#x27;s favor after the arrival of 6,000 French auxiliary troops. In addition, the diplomatic situation also seemed bleak for the Dutch. A French conquest of the Spanish Netherlands could only be stopped by entering an alliance with England.

The next year Johan de Witt entered the Triple Alliance of 1668 with England, although reluctantly, as he considered Charles II an untrustworthy ally. The Alliance between the Dutch Republic, England and Sweden was formed to mediate between France and Spain and forced Louis to temporarily abandon his plans for the conquest of the southern Netherlands. At first this seemed like another major diplomatic success for the Dutch, but de Witt&#x27;s fears of English treachery proved justified. Charles had only entered the Triple Alliance to break the Franco-Dutch one. Both humiliated monarchs intensified their secret cooperation through the Secret Treaty of Dover and would, joined by the bishop of Münster, attack the Dutch in 1672 in the Third Anglo-Dutch War. Initially the Dutch Republic seemed unable to counter this attack, and De Witt was scapegoated. He resigned and the young William III became stadtholder. That same year de Witt was assassinated.
