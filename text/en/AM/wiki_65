<text>The Arizona Complex League (ACL) is a rookie-level Minor League Baseball league that operates in and around Phoenix, Arizona, since 1988. Prior to 2021, it was known as the Arizona League (AZL). Along with the Florida Complex League (FCL), it forms the lowest rung on the North American minor-league ladder.

ACL teams play at the minor league spring training complexes of their parent Major League Baseball (MLB) clubs and are owned by those parent clubs. Admission is not charged and no concessions are operated at the teams&#x27; games. Every Cactus League team fields at least one team in the league. Night games are commonly played in the spring training stadium, although games may also be played at the team&#x27;s practice fields.

As of the 2021 season, there is no league limit to how many players can be on an active roster, but no team can have more than three players with four or more years of minor-league experience. Major-league players on rehabilitation assignments may also appear in the league.

==History==
===Arizona League===
The league began play in 1988 as the Arizona League (AZL) on an experimental basis with four teams playing a 60-game schedule—the teams were affiliated with the Milwaukee Brewers, Oakland Athletics, San Diego Padres, and a cooperative between the Boston Red Sox and Seattle Mariners. Games were scheduled in the morning in order to make sure the league did not compete with the Phoenix Firebirds of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League.

The Phoenix Diamondbacks debuted in 1996, the first affiliate of the Arizona Diamondbacks to start playing professional baseball, two years before their parent club joined Major League Baseball. A crowd of 6,124 attended the Diamondbacks&#x27; first game on June 25, 1996, a 15–7 loss to the Phoenix Athletics. A number of local dignitaries were at the game, including Buck Showalter and Jerry Colangelo.

The Colorado Rockies started their rookie league team a year before starting major league play as well in 1992, sharing a team with the Cubs. The team, composed of the Rockies&#x27; first-ever draft picks, received a different level of notoriety than the Diamondbacks for their first rookie league game: as the players wore either Rockies jerseys or Cubs jerseys, the team did not have their uniform pants ready at the start of the season, and had to borrow pants from the Cubs.

Between 1998 and 2000 an unaffiliated team composed of young players from the Mexican League played out of the Tucson Electric Park spring training complex, in part to add a fourth team to a southern division. Three Tucson-based teams (the Mexican All-Stars, the Diamondbacks, and the Rockies) would leave the league after the 2000 season, largely due to travel concerns, followed by the White Sox two years later. All three teams later relocated their spring training complexes to the Phoenix metropolitan area, and the Diamondbacks and White Sox reinstated their rookie league teams.

The start of the 2020 season was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic before ultimately being cancelled on June 30.

===Arizona Complex League===
Prior to the 2021 season, in continuation of MLB&#x27;s reorganization of the minor leagues, the two US-based complex leagues were renamed, with the Arizona League becoming the Arizona Complex League (ACL).

For 2021, the league consisted of 18 teams. In 2024, the schedule was changed from a late June to late August season to a season that stated in early May to late July season, meaning the league would no longer feature players drafted in the current year draft.

==Playoff procedure==
Prior to 1998, the league champion was the team with best record over the course of the season. Since 1998, the season has been split into two half-seasons. From 1998 to 2008, the teams with the best records in each half faced off to decide the league champion. If the same team won both halves, they were automatically crowned champions (only one team accomplished this, the 2005 Arizona League Giants).

In 2009, the league split into two divisions, an alignment that was used through the 2012 season. The two teams in each division with the best record in each half-season played off for the division championship, and the winners advanced to the final. If the same team won their division in both halves, they advanced directly to the final.

From 2013 to 2019, the six teams who won their division in the first and second half of the season qualified for the playoffs. If a team won both halves, the next best team in that division by overall record qualified for the playoffs. The top two teams by overall record received a bye to the semifinals. All playoff games were single elimination, with the exception of a best-of-3 final.

As of 2022, four teams—three division winners and one wild card team—qualify for the playoffs seeded by winning percentage regardless of division standing, with seeds 1 vs. 4 and 2 vs. 3 playing in a single-game semi-final. A best-of-three series between the two semi-final winners follows to determine the league champion.

==Current teams==
Teams in the league are not referred to by their home city, but simply by their parent club&#x27;s name. A prefix of ACL (previously AZL or Arizona League) is typically used to differentiate the team from its parent club and other farm teams with the same nickname. City names have been used previously instead of a prefix, such as with the Peoria Padres and Peoria Mariners. Franchises that field more than one team use differentiating suffixes, typically based on team colors (e.g. Blue and Gold). As of the 2024 season, no major league club fields more than one ACL team.

<text>The Florida Complex League (FCL) is a rookie-level Minor League Baseball league that operates in Florida, United States. Before 2021, it was known as the Gulf Coast League (GCL). Together with the Arizona Complex League (ACL), it forms the lowest rung on the North American minor-league ladder.

FCL teams play at the minor league spring training complexes of their parent Major League Baseball (MLB) clubs and are owned by those parent clubs. Admission is not charged to FCL games, and no concessions are sold. Every Grapefruit League team fields at least one team in the league. Night games are commonly played in the spring training stadium, although games may also be played at the team&#x27;s practice fields.

As of the 2021 season, there is no league limit to how many players can be on an active roster, but no team can have more than three players with four or more years of minor-league experience. Major-league players on rehabilitation assignments may also appear in the league.

== History ==
Complex-based baseball leagues, which played before sparse crowds and often scheduled morning games to avoid the summer heat and afternoon thunderstorms, were adopted after the drastic shrinking of minor league baseball during the 1950s and 1960s. MLB teams needed an entry level to professional baseball for 18- and 19-year-old players graduating from high schools or signed from Latin America. They replaced Class C and Class D leagues as the lowest rung on the minor league ladder.

The current league was founded in 1964 as the Sarasota Rookie League (SRL) with four teams playing in Sarasota. It was originally intended to be the Gulf Coast division of a statewide rookie league, with the eastern division Cocoa Rookie League based in Cocoa. However, the eastern and western teams never played each other. The SRL&#x27;s four teams consisted of squads sponsored by the Chicago White Sox, Milwaukee Braves, New York Yankees, and St. Louis Cardinals. The SRL Braves, managed by Paul Snyder, future Atlanta farm system director, won the championship with a 36–23 record.

* SRL Cardinals
* SRL White Sox
* SRL Yankees
The league added teams in Bradenton in 1965 and changed its name to the Florida Rookie League.
* FRL Astros
* FRL Braves
* FRL Cardinals
* FRL Twins
* FRL White Sox
* FRL Yankees
=== Gulf Coast League ===
The league adopted Gulf Coast League (GCL) naming for the 1966 season. It expanded to Florida&#x27;s east coast in the 1990s.

Historically, three separate leagues also used the Gulf Coast League name: a 1907–1908 Class D league, a 1926 Class D league and a 1950–1953 Class C (1950) and Class B League. 

The 1907 founding members were the Alexandria White Sox, Lafayette Browns, Lake Charles Creoles, Monroe Municipals, Opelousas Indians and Orange Hoo-Hoos. 

The 1926 Gulf Coast League was a four-team Class D level league. The league featured the Beeville Bees/Laredo Oilers (59–41), Corpus Christi Seahawks (43–58), Kingsville Jerseys/McAllen Palms/Mission Grapefruiters (46–52) and Victoria Rosebuds/Edinburg Bobcats (51–48) teams.

The 1950–1953 version of the Gulf Coast League featured the Brownsville Charros, Corpus Christi Aces, Galveston White Caps, Harlingen Capitals, Lake Charles Lakers, Laredo Apaches, Port Arthur Seahawks and Texas City Texans. The Crowley Millers, Jacksonville Jax, Lufkin/Leesville Angels played in the league in 1950. All three versions of the league operated around the Gulf coasts of Texas and Louisiana.

On June 21, 2016, the GCL hired Jen Pawol, the first female umpire in Minor League Baseball since 2007, and the first in the GCL since 1978. In 2017, the GCL hired another woman umpire, Emma Charlesworth-Seiler.

The start of the 2020 season was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic before ultimately being canceled on June 30.

=== Florida Complex League ===
Prior to the 2021 season, in continuation of MLB&#x27;s reorganization of the minor leagues, the two US-based complex leagues were renamed, with the Gulf Coast League becoming the Florida Complex League (FCL).

== League format ==
The league plays a 52- to 56-game season that traditionally began in mid-June and concluded in late August. Following the relocation of the Atlanta Braves spring training complex in 2019, teams in the league were divided into three divisions: , , and (down from four in 2018). Beginning with the 2024 season, both the Arizona Complex League and Florida Complex League seasons commence in early May and conclude in late July. 

As of 2022, four teams—three division winners and one wild card team—qualify for the playoffs seeded by winning percentage regardless of division standing, with seeds 1 vs. 4 and 2 vs. 3 playing in a single-game semi-final. A best-of-three series between the two semi-final winners follows to determine the league champion.

== Current teams ==
Teams in the league are not referred to by their home city, but simply by their parent club&#x27;s name. A prefix of FCL (previously GCL) is typically used to differentiate the team from its parent club and other farm teams with the same nickname. At times, a parent club has fielded two teams in the league at the same time, in which case a suffix has been added to each of those teams&#x27; names, such as a direction (e.g. East, West) or a color (e.g. Blue, Orange). Some teams share stadiums with their club&#x27;s Single-A affiliate in the Florida State League. Note that Single-A teams &quot;do&quot; use city names—for example the Tampa Tarpons, who also use the Yankees&#x27; spring training complex.

After the Houston Astros and Kansas City Royals each fielded two teams as late as 1981, no franchise did so until the New York Yankees in 2013. The Yankees were joined by the Detroit Tigers and Philadelphia Phillies in fielding two teams in 2016 and 2018, respectively. As of the 2024 season, no major league clubs field more than one team in the FCL.

<doc id="70884" wikidata="Q3240330" url="?curid=70884" title="Arizona Fall League">
<text>The Arizona Fall League (AFL) is an off-season baseball league owned and operated by Major League Baseball (MLB) which operates during autumn in Arizona, United States, at six different baseball complexes. Arizona Fall League rosters are filled by many of the top prospects in Minor League Baseball (MiLB) who are assigned by their parent clubs.

==Structure==

The six teams of the AFL are organized in two three-team divisions. Each AFL team is affiliated with five teams in Major League Baseball (MLB), and each MLB team provides seven players from their Minor League Baseball affiliates, yielding 35-man rosters. Specific players are invited (not assigned) to play in the AFL by their parent club. The league provides an environment for top prospects to advance their development, in a setting that MLB governs and monitors, as opposed to other offseason leagues (such as the Puerto Rican Winter League) located outside of the contiguous United States.

Player eligibility has changed over time; as of 2008, each MLB organization could only provide one player below the Double-A level, and before 2019 there were service-time limits for any players on the 40-man roster of an MLB team, but as of 2021 all players within an MLB organization are eligible. Free agents are not eligible. The seven players each MLB organization provides consist of four pitchers and three position players. Positional needs for each AFL team (e.g. catchers) are coordinated between player development directors of the affiliated MLB organizations via a &quot;position draft&quot;. An MLB organization can assign more than three position players; such players serve as a taxi squad for the AFL team and are limited to playing two games each week.

Play generally begins in early October (10/7 for 2024) and runs until mid-November, although play continued into early December for the first five seasons that the league operated. Each team plays approximately 30 games; schedule length has varied somewhat during the league&#x27;s history. Following the end of the league&#x27;s regular season, the two division winners meet in a championship game.

Players wear uniforms of their respective MLB parent club, along with an AFL team-specific hat. The league had its own team-specific uniforms before 1998 and in 2019. The manager, pitching coach, and hitting coach of each AFL team are provided by MLB organizations on a rotating basis.

Each team plays home games at its own ballpark, each of which currently has a seating capacity in excess of 10,000 spectators. For the 2019 season, only four venues were used due to ballpark renovation work.

The league has organized an annual all-star game since 2006. Initially known as the &quot;Rising Stars Showcase&quot;, it has been branded as the &quot;Fall Stars Game&quot; since at least 2013. Included in the 2022 season was the Homerun derby. Players for the game are selected by league staff, scouting and farm directors, and MLB.com writers.

==History==
The league&#x27;s inaugural season was 1992, during which each team played a 54-game schedule that ended in early December. The divisions and teams that season were:
* Northern division: Grand Canyon Rafters, Scottsdale Scorpions, Sun Cities Solar Sox
* Southern division: Chandler Diamondbacks, Phoenix Saguaros, Tucson Javelinas

The league&#x27;s first game was played on October 6, 1992, with the Grand Canyon Rafters defeating the Scottsdale Scorpions, 6–4.

Before the 1994 season, the Javelinas relocated from Tucson to Peoria, to limit travel distances to the Phoenix metropolitan area. All teams have been located in greater Phoenix since then.

Since 1995, when the Diamondbacks became the Desert Dogs, no team has changed its nickname. However, each team has changed its location at least once during its history. The most recent change was by the Desert Dogs, who moved from Phoenix to Glendale in 2013.
For the 1998 season, organizers rostered players onto each Arizona Fall League team from a single division in MLB:
* American League East – Grand Canyon Rafters
* American League Central – Phoenix Desert Dogs
* American League West – Peoria Javelinas

* National League East – Sun Cities Solar Sox
* National League Central – Maryvale Saguaros
* National League West – Scottsdale Scorpions
In 2007, the United States national baseball team and China national baseball team played several games against AFL teams; both teams were later competitors in baseball at the 2008 Summer Olympics. In 2019, the Mesa Solar Sox participated in the &quot;Vamos a Tucson&quot; Mexican Baseball Fiesta in early October, facing teams of the Mexican Pacific League.

In 2019, the league adopted a new logo. In 2020, the season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

A number of future MLB All-Stars have had stints in the Arizona Fall League; over 300, per the league&#x27;s website. These include David Wright (2003), Dustin Pedroia (2004), Andre Ethier (2005), Bryce Harper (2010–2011), Nolan Arenado (2011), Mike Trout (2011), Mookie Betts (2013), Aaron Judge (2014), Gleyber Torres (2016), and Ronald Acuña Jr. (2017). In 1994, Michael Jordan played for Scottsdale during his time away from the NBA. Similarly, former NFL quarterback Tim Tebow played for Scottsdale in 2016 during his foray into professional baseball.

==Current teams==
Each stadium hosts one or two of its MLB affiliates, denoted in bold, during spring training.

Each listed city is in Arizona. Team affiliations reflect the 2024 season.

==Results by season==
Results for each team since the league&#x27;s inaugural 1992 season are listed below. Teams are listed by their nicknames only, independent of location, as various team locations have changed over time. Tie games are not listed, as they are excluded from winning percentage calculations, which determine division standings. The best winning percentage for a season was by the Saguaros who went 26–10 (.722) in 2011, while the worst was by the Saguaros in 2002 with a record of 11–32 (.256).

Through 1997, teams were organized into Northern and Southern divisions. For the 1998 season, American and National divisions were designated. From 1999 to 2021, the divisions were named East and West, except for four seasons (2003–2005 and 2008) when American and National naming was again used.

As of the 2022 season, divisions have been eliminated. The top three teams in the final regular season standings qualify for the postseason. The second- and third-place teams meet in a play-in semi-final game, with the winner facing the first-place team in the championship game.

Division winners appear in bold type from 1992 to 2021; beginning with 2022, the top three teams that qualify for the postseason appear in bold type. Tie-breaking procedures (such as between the Saguaros and Javelinas in 2021 for the West division title) are unclear.

== Championship history ==
From 1992 to 2021, the first-place teams from both divisions met for the league championship. Originally a best-of-three series, it was played as a single game from 2001 to 2021.

As of the 2022 season, divisions have been eliminated. The top three teams in the final regular season standings qualify for the postseason. The second- and third-place teams meet in a play-in semi-final game, with the winner facing the first-place team in the championship game.

The Peoria Javelinas have won the most championships, seven. The most consecutive championships is five, accomplished by the Phoenix Desert Dogs during 2004–2008. No championship game was held in 2020, as the season was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

<doc id="70887" wikidata="Q5193646" url="?curid=70887" title="Culture of Sydney">
<text>The cultural life of Sydney is dynamic and multicultural. Many of the individual cultures that make up the Sydney mosaic are centred on the cultural, artistic, ethnic, linguistic and religious communities formed by waves of immigration. Sydney is a major global city with a vibrant scene of musical, theatrical, visual, literary and other artistic activity.

==History==
Sydney has a long rich cultural history. It is located in the traditional custodian lands of the Gadigal people who originally settled in the area at least 60,000 years ago. After the arrival of the First Fleet in 1788, a series of cultures emerged and adapted from European and American influences in needs of a modern-class city. New terrace houses began to develop from the 1830s, shaping the adaptation of Sydney&#x27;s cultural lifestyle.

Following the end of World War I, new forms of culture processed a mix of Sydney&#x27;s cultural diversity, on bases of ethnicity, age and gender.

Currently, Sydney has transformed into a modern complex cosmopolitan society. It endures a vibrant arts scene in distinction to multicultural heritage and provides dozens of institutions, including its world heritage-listed opera house.

Some sections of Sydney constitute the areas of European settlement, including Circular Quay and The Rocks, which exist as a remainder of a culture by brought by British convict settlers.

==Arts and entertainment==
===Performing arts ===

The Sydney Festival, held each year in January, is Sydney&#x27;s and Australia&#x27;s biggest performing arts festival, incorporating classical and contemporary music, theatre, visual arts, and new media.
The Sydney Theatre Company shows a regular roster of Australian (by authors such as noted playwright David Williamson), classic, and international plays. Their productions occasionally incorporate the return to the live stage of famous Australian screen actors such as Cate Blanchett, Hugo Weaving, Geoffrey Rush, etc. The Wharf Theatre, the Sydney Theatre, the Drama Theatre of the Opera House and the Belvoir Street Theatre (the home of Company B) are some of the main live theatre venues. The Bell Shakespeare Company, directed by John Bell, specialises in Shakespearean drama, with forays into modern plays such as Heiner Müller&#x27;s &#x27;Titus Andronicus&#x27;.

Sydney has several independent theatres for productions throughout the city centre including the Capitol Theatre (est. 1928, 2,000 seats), the Lyric Theatre (2,000 seats), the Theatre Royal (Est. 1827, 1,200 seats) and the State Theatre (est. 1929, 2,000 seats but stage not big enough for large productions).

From the 1940s to the 1970s the Sydney Push, an intellectual subculture of authors and activists questioning of authority, including Germaine Greer, was active.

The Sydney Dance Company under the leadership of Graeme Murphy has put on contemporary productions since the late 20th century. The Australian Ballet, whose headquarters are in Melbourne, performs regularly in Sydney.

Every May at the anniversary of the Concordia German Club, which was founded in 1883 and every Christmas the Concordia German Choir performs at the German Club in Tempe. The Choir specializes in German folk songs.

=== Music ===

&quot;&#x27;O! Sydney I Love You&quot;&#x27; was the winner of a song writing competition organized by &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper. Emily Harris studio dance recorded the song in 1927. &quot;Sydney&quot; was recorded by Maurice Chenoweth around the same time. &quot;My City of Sydney&quot; was performed by Tommy Leonetti on Channel 9 during the 1970s as the station shut down for the evening.

The Sydney Symphony is internationally renowned and regularly performs in the Concert Hall (2,600 seats) of the Sydney Opera House under Chief Conductor Vladimir Ashkenazy (until 2013) and, as of 2014, David Robertson. City Recital Hall is dedicated mainly to chamber music and chamber orchestra concerts, featuring many famous international artists as well as concert series by local groups such as the Australian Chamber Orchestra and Sydney&#x27;s foremost Baroque orchestra, the Australian Brandenburg Orchestra.

Opera Australia, as at 2015 the world&#x27;s third-busiest opera company, has its headquarters in Sydney and performs a busy program of mainly classical and occasionally contemporary operas at the Opera Theatre of the Sydney Opera House.

New experimental and avant-garde music is performed by Ensemble Offspring, Halcyon, The Noise and others, at the recently refurbished Carriageworks and many small inner-city cafes, warehouses, theatres etc. Liquid Architecture, What Is Music and The NOW now are annual festivals and ongoing series of contemporary music and sound art.

Jazz and alternative music (such as Sydney-based The Necks) are played at The Basement and Jazz at 72, and formerly at the now defunct Harbourside Brasserie. The Sound Lounge (SIMA), Jazzgroove, 505 and Red Rattler host regular jazz and alternative music events.

Many well-known Australian rock bands and solo artists began their careers in Sydney. Various Sydney inductees into the ARIA Hall of Fame include Johnny O&#x27;Keefe, Col Joye (&amp; The Joy Boys), Billy Thorpe (the original Aztecs formed in Sydney), The Easybeats, Sherbet, Richard Clapton, John Paul Young, AC/DC, Radio Birdman, Midnight Oil, Rose Tattoo, Mental As Anything, INXS, Icehouse and Divinyls.

Other notable acts include early rockers Lonnie Lee &amp; the Leemen, Dig Richards &amp; The R&#x27;Jays and Johnny Rebb &amp; The Rebels, surf group The Atlantics, beat groups Ray Brown &amp; The Whispers, The Missing Links and The Throb. The 1970s saw &quot;progressive&quot; acts like Tamam Shud, Tully and Blackfeather emerge, followed by glam groups Hush &amp; Ted Mulry Gang.

Sydney is famous for its alternative rock scene, with such names as The Celibate Rifles, indie rockers The Clouds, The Vines, Longreef and The Crystal Set, to electronic music pioneers Severed Heads, Single Gun Theory, The Lab, Itch-E and Scratch-E and local favourites Sneaky Sound System. Sydney is the original home of the now national alternative rock festival the Big Day Out, which began in Sydney in 1992 featuring local bands such as You Am I and The Clouds and international groups like Nirvana.

Other notable bands from the Sydney music scene are Angelspit, Wolfmother, Thy Art Is Murder, and 5 Seconds of Summer.

Sydney has a prominent indie or lo-fi scene which features many rising, internationally touring bands such as Royal Headache, Circle Pit, Electric Flu and Raw Prawn. While not as widespread as Melbourne&#x27;s &#x27;scene&#x27;, Sydney tends to have a mass of tight-knit groups of bands that will tour together, most of which are on the same record label(s).

===Film===

Sydney is Australia&#x27;s centre for commercial film and media. Many of the landmarks in Sydney have been referenced, shown and been the setting for countless films and television programs. Many films have been set in the city, including &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;, which was set in Sydney Harbour. The city was used as downtown &quot;Angel Grove&quot; in 20th Century Fox&#x27;s &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie&quot; &quot;(1995)&quot;. The Matrix was also filmed in Sydney.

The international Sydney Film Festival takes place each year in June at various venues in the CBD.

Other film festivals in Sydney include the renowned short film festivals Tropfest and Flickerfest.

=== Children&#x27;s entertainment ===
A large portion of Australia&#x27;s children&#x27;s entertainment originates in Sydney including highly successful musical groups The Wiggles and Hi-5 and television programs &quot;Play School&quot;, &quot;Bananas in Pyjamas&quot;, &quot;Saturday Disney&quot;, &quot;Skippy the Bush Kangaroo&quot;, &quot;Mr. Squiggle&quot; and many others.

== Museums ==

Sydney has been home to many visual artists, from the lush pastoralism of Lloyd Rees depictions of Sydney Harbour to Jeffrey Smart&#x27;s portraits of bleak urban alienation, from the psychedelic visions of Brett Whiteley to a plethora of contemporary artists.

Sydney has a range of museums including those based on visual art such as the Museum of Contemporary Art, the Art Gallery of New South Wales, Artspace, White Rabbit Gallery, Carriageworks, and the Brett Whiteley Studio; science and technology such as the Powerhouse Museum, Sydney Observatory, Sydney Tramway Museum, Australian National Maritime Museum and Australian Museum; and history such as the Museum of Sydney and Chau Chak Wing Museum.

The Art Gallery of New South Wales (AGNSW), alongside major collections of Australian colonial and 20th-century art and some works by European masters, has the largest and most important collection of Aboriginal art anywhere in the world. The Archibald Prize for portraiture (Australia&#x27;s most prestigious art prize), the Sulman Prize for subject/genre painting and the Wynne Prize for landscape painting are awarded each year by the trustees of the AGNSW.

The Museum of Contemporary Art (MCA) at West Circular Quay is Australia&#x27;s foremost contemporary art museum, featuring a mixture of exhibitions from the museum&#x27;s permanent collection and visiting shows by major international artists. The Biennale of Sydney is an important festival dedicated to the contemporary visual arts, held bi-annually at the MCA and at various other venues around the city and often spilling into the streets. Another visual arts festival held at the MCA each spring is Primavera, a festival focusing on young, up-and-coming Australian artists.

A huge wrap-around mural by renowned American artist Sol LeWitt can be seen in the foyer of Australia Square Tower on the corner of George, Bond and Pitt Streets. Outside the tower, facing George Street, there is a large abstract steel sculpture by American sculptor Alexander Calder.

There are many commercial galleries focusing mainly on cutting-edge contemporary art all around the inner city suburbs of Woollahra, Newtown, Surry Hills, Paddington, Darlinghurst, Camperdown etc.

Graffiti and street art thrive in Sydney. The Newtown, Surry Hills and Glebe areas in particular have many innovative examples of murals and other street art.

A recent addition is Art Month Sydney, a month-long festival of the visual arts held throughout March and the annual Art &amp; About Sydney Festival.

== Literature and libraries ==

The Sydney Writers&#x27; Festival based in Walsh Bay, is held each year in May, featuring readings and discussions by Australian and international writers. An array of novels have used Sydney as a setting, notably Ruth Park&#x27;s &quot;The Harp in the South&quot;, which charts the slums of 1930s–40s Sydney, Christina Stead&#x27;s &quot;Seven Poor Men of Sydney&quot; which addresses a similar theme of life in the poor neighbourhoods, and Elizabeth Harrower&#x27;s &quot;Down in the City&quot;–set in a King&#x27;s Cross apartment in the late 1950s. More contemporary examples include Melina Marchetta&#x27;s &quot;Looking for Alibrandi&quot;, J. M. Coetzee&#x27;s &quot;Diary of a Bad Year&quot;, Peter Carey&#x27;s &quot;30 Days in Sydney&quot;, Patrick White&#x27;s &quot;The Eye of the Storm&quot; and Kate Grenville&#x27;s &quot;The Secret River&quot;. Prolific writers from the city include Geraldine Brooks, Jackie French, Kathy Lette, Phillip Knightley and Richard Neville.

The largest library in Sydney is the State Library of New South Wales, which holds over 4.7 million items, including two million books, and hosts free exhibitions in its gallery spaces. Most local government areas within Sydney have local libraries including the City of Sydney Library with eight local branches, the Bankstown City Library, the Max Webber Library in Blacktown and many others.

== Tourism ==
Many of the tourist attractions are scattered all over the city, the most famous and visited being the Sydney Opera House and the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Other attractions include the Royal Botanical Gardens, the Art Gallery of New South Wales, the Museum of Contemporary Art, White Rabbit Gallery and Sydney Tower.

Sydney&#x27;s nightlife has declined since the introduction of lockout laws, which call for 1.30am lockouts and 3am last drinks. Prior to the introduction of the laws, Kings Cross was known as the city&#x27;s red-light district. There are huge celebrations for New Year&#x27;s Eve and Australia Day in Sydney, including a fireworks display that features the Harbour Bridge.

Many festivals are held in Sydney, including the Sydney Festival, a celebration of partly free performances throughout January; Vivid Sydney, a festival of light and music held annually in May–June; the Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras (see below); the annual Sydney Film Festival and many smaller festivals such as Tropfest.

There are also several music festivals including Big Day Out, Homebake, The Great Escape, and Stereosonic.

== Sport ==

Sport is an important part of the culture in Sydney. New South Wales has attracted many international multi-sport events including the 2000 Summer Olympics, held in Sydney. Sydney was also the host of the 1938 British Empire Games. The Olympic Stadium, now known as ANZ Stadium, is the scene of the annual NRL Grand Final. It also regularly hosts rugby league State of Origin as well as rugby union and soccer internationals. It hosted the final of the 2003 Rugby World Cup and the memorable soccer World Cup qualifier between Australia and Uruguay.

The Sydney Cricket Ground traditionally hosts the &#x27;New Year&#x27; cricket test match from 2–6 January each year. The annual Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race begins in Sydney Harbour on Boxing Day, whilst the climax of Australia&#x27;s touring car racing series is the Bathurst 1000, held at the Mount Panorama Circuit near the city of Bathurst in the Western Plains.

The Sydney Autumn Racing Carnival features the richest two-year-old horse race in the world, the Golden Slipper Stakes, which is run in April every year. The Medibank International tennis tournament is held in January prior to the Australian Open. The City to Surf foot race is held every August and is one of the largest timed foot races in the world.
===Rugby===
Rugby league football has a place with some Sydneysiders, as a sporting and a tradition within the city. This stems back from the earlier colonial days of the city where the city and its cultural were largely dictated by wealthy Englishmen whom traditionally played and were supporters of the Rugby code of football, which was largely advertised and passed on to the people of Sydney, including the working class who in back in England largely played soccer. The game quickly grew a working-class following, and has been a Sydney tradition ever since.

The headquarters of the Australian Rugby League and National Rugby League (NRL) are in Sydney, which is home to nine of the 16 NRL football clubs (Sydney Roosters, South Sydney Rabbitohs, Parramatta Eels, Cronulla Sharks, Wests Tigers, Penrith Panthers, Bulldogs and Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles), as well as being the northern home of the St George Illawarra Dragons, which is half-based in Wollongong.

Sydney has a local club rugby union competition (the Shute Shield), and a Super Rugby team the NSW Waratahs, who play their games in the city and represent the entire state of New South Wales. They were represented in the defunct Australian Rugby Championship by Sydney Fleet, Western Sydney Rams and Central Coast Rays. The National Rugby Championship has four NSW teams: Sydney Stars, Greater Sydney Rams, North Harbour Rays and NSW Country Eagles. The Australian Rugby Union headquarters are located in Sydney. The Waratahs play out of the Sydney Football Stadium, and when in Sydney the Wallabies play out of Stadium Australia.

===Australian rules football===

Australian rules football, commonly known as Australian Football League (AFL), is a developing game in most of NSW with increasing popularity. In Sydney, local competitions established in 1880 and again in 1903 competed with rugby union football and then rugby league football.

The AFL has two teams from Sydney, the Sydney Swans and the Greater Western Sydney Giants. Formerly South Melbourne, the Swans moved up to Sydney in 1982, after hitting financial trouble. The Swans have won two premierships since moving to Sydney (in 2005 and 2012). Attendance for Swans matches has slowly risen since their relocation. The Giants, based in Western Sydney and Canberra, joined the AFL in 2012. The inaugural AFL Women&#x27;s in 2017 included a GWS Giants team.
===Soccer===

Whilst having a strong sporting tradition in the field of Rugby League, Sydney also has a long and strong tradition in association football. Early football clubs in Sydney were relatively small, and did not have very large followings, and like the general population of Sydney in the late 1800s the clubs were largely English in nature, but when the Australian government began its immigration policy in years closely following World War II, many immigrants left Europe in search of new homes in Sydney, and Australia in general. These migrant groups who were subject to racism from the existing population took it upon themselves to found their own football clubs, celebrating their particular ethnic communities.

The three largest such clubs were founded by the three largest post war immigration groups respectively, they are: Marconi Stallions Football Club (Italian), Sydney Olympic Football Club (Greek), and Sydney United Football Club (Croatian). Along with these larger clubs, there are also many smaller clubs formed by ethnic groups, who also bare suburban names, such as Bankstown City Lions Football Club (Macedonian), Bonnyrigg White Eagles (Serbian), Parramatta Eagles (Maltese), and St. George Saints Football Club (Hungarian). These &quot;ethnic&quot; clubs soon began to dominate football in Sydney, drawing large crowd support from their given ethnic groups, and having their fair share of on field success too.

In 2005, a new club was founded in Sydney called Sydney FC, who were to be based in central Sydney as opposed to being based at a small suburban stadium, and were founded specifically to attract a multicultural following. They were entered in a new league to be known as the A-League, this would act as the show piece national football competition, contested by similarly formed clubs from other large cities around Australia. In the first 6 years of their existence, Sydney FC have been relatively successful building up a solid support base of around 10,000 members, and sometimes attracting crowds of up to 40,000.

===Cricket===
The NSW Blues are by far the most successful domestic cricket side in Australia having won the First-class competition 44 times and the One-Day Domestic cup nine times. They occasionally play first-class matches against touring International sides. The team&#x27;s main home ground is the Sydney Cricket Ground. In the Twenty20 Big Bash League and Women&#x27;s Big Bash League, the state is represented by the Sydney Sixers, playing at the Sydney Cricket Ground and the Sydney Thunder, playing at the Sydney Showground.

===Basketball and netball===
The Sydney Kings and Wollongong Hawks are the state&#x27;s representatives in the National Basketball League (NBL). These teams have all featured in the finals series since 2002–03, the Kings winning 3 consecutive premierships in 2002–03, 2003–04 &amp; 2004–05. There are 12 teams in the New South Wales conference of the Australian Basketball Association, the Waratah League. The Sydney Uni Flames play in the Women&#x27;s National Basketball League. Giants Netball were formed when the Greater Western Sydney Giants football club were given one of the three licenses for new teams for the first season of the Super Netball league in 2017.

== Communities and subcultures ==

=== Multicultural communities ===
Areas with a large proportion of people born overseas and with non-English speaking backgrounds include Auburn, Fairfield, Liverpool, and Bankstown. Generally Western European and North American born people have settled around the Lower North Shore, eastern suburbs and Sutherland Shire, the Portuguese in Surry Hills, Arab people around the Lakemba-Auburn region, Indo-Chinese in the south-western suburbs, South Asians around Parramatta and the south east, and North East Asians in major nodes such as Hurstville, Burwood, Ashfield, Strathfield, Chatswood, Eastwood, Campsie and Haymarket.

=== LGBT community ===
Sydney has a significant gay and lesbian community, centred on Oxford Street, and holds the annual 
The Sydney lesbian community, though still active around Oxford Street, is well established and visible in Newtown and Enmore in Sydney&#x27;s Inner West. There is also a history of lesbian community congregating in Leichhardt, and other inner west suburbs. The Qtopia Sydney museum, which is situated in the former Darlinghurst police station, hosts exhibits relating to Australian LGBT history and the AIDS epidemic.

There are two magazines available in Sydney and one website with detailed information on Sydney&#x27;s lesbian community and night-life. &quot;LOTL&quot; and &quot;Cherry&quot; magazines are free, monthly, Australia wide, publications which can be found around Oxford Street, Glebe and Newtown. The Sapphic Sydney website was a resource which detailed events and community groups as well as featuring a local business directory.

There is also a thriving independent queer publishing community in Sydney publishing magazines such as &quot;Slit&quot;, &quot;Dirty Queer&quot;, and &quot;Spunk&quot;.

<doc id="70889" wikidata="Q12418" url="?curid=70889" title="Mona Lisa">
<text>The Mona Lisa is a half-length portrait painting by Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci. Considered an archetypal masterpiece of the Italian Renaissance, it has been described as &quot;the best known, the most visited, the most written about, the most sung about, [and] the most parodied work of art in the world.&quot; The painting&#x27;s novel qualities include the subject&#x27;s enigmatic expression, monumentality of the composition, the subtle modelling of forms, and the atmospheric illusionism.

The painting has been traditionally considered to depict the Italian noblewoman Lisa del Giocondo. It is painted in oil on a white poplar panel. Leonardo never gave the painting to the Giocondo family. It was believed to have been painted between 1503 and 1506; however, Leonardo may have continued working on it as late as 1517. King Francis I of France acquired the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; after Leonardo&#x27;s death in 1519, and it is now the property of the French Republic. It has normally been on display at the Louvre in Paris since 1797.

The painting&#x27;s global fame and popularity partly stem from its 1911 theft by Vincenzo Peruggia, who attributed his actions to Italian patriotism—a belief it should belong to Italy. The theft and subsequent recovery in 1914 generated unprecedented publicity for an art theft, and led to the publication of many cultural depictions such as the 1915 opera &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;, two early 1930s films (&quot;The Theft of the Mona Lisa&quot; and &quot;Arsène Lupin&quot;), and the song &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; recorded by Nat King Cole—one of the most successful songs of the 1950s.

The &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; is one of the most valuable paintings in the world. It holds the Guinness World Record for the highest known painting insurance valuation in history at US$100 million in 1962, equivalent to $1 billion .

==Title and subject==
The title of the painting, which is known in English as &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;, is based on the presumption that it depicts Lisa del Giocondo, although her likeness is uncertain. Renaissance art historian Giorgio Vasari wrote that &quot;Leonardo undertook to paint, for Francesco del Giocondo, the portrait of Mona Lisa, his wife.&quot; in Italian is a polite form of address originating as —similar to &quot;Ma&#x27;am&quot;, &quot;Madam&quot;, or &quot;my lady&quot; in English. This became , and its contraction . The title of the painting is spelled in Italian as &quot;Monna Lisa&quot; (&quot;&quot; being a vulgarity in Italian), which is rare in English, where it is traditionally spelled &quot;Mona&quot;.

Lisa del Giocondo was a member of the Gherardini family of Florence and Tuscany, and the wife of wealthy Florentine silk merchant Francesco del Giocondo. The painting is thought to have been commissioned for their new home, and to celebrate the birth of their second son, Andrea. The Italian name for the painting, , means &quot;jocund&quot; (&quot;happy&quot; or &quot;jovial&quot;), or literally &quot;the jocund one&quot;, a pun on the feminine form of Lisa&#x27;s married name, Giocondo. In French, the title has the same meaning. Vasari&#x27;s account of the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; comes from his biography of Leonardo published in 1550, 31 years after the artist&#x27;s death. It has long been the best-known source of information on the provenance of the work and identity of the sitter. Leonardo&#x27;s assistant Salaì, at his death in 1524, owned a portrait which in his personal papers was named &quot;la Gioconda&quot;, a painting bequeathed to him by Leonardo.

That Leonardo painted such a work, and its date, were confirmed in 2005 when a scholar at Heidelberg University discovered a marginal note in a 1477 printing of a volume by ancient Roman philosopher Cicero. Dated October 1503, the note was written by Leonardo&#x27;s contemporary Agostino Vespucci. This note likens Leonardo to renowned Greek painter Apelles, who is mentioned in the text, and states that Leonardo was at that time working on a painting of Lisa del Giocondo. In response to the announcement of the discovery of this document, Vincent Delieuvin, the Louvre representative, stated &quot;Leonardo da Vinci was painting, in 1503, the portrait of a Florentine lady by the name of Lisa del Giocondo. About this we are now certain. Unfortunately, we cannot be absolutely certain that this portrait of Lisa del Giocondo is the painting of the Louvre.&quot;

The catalogue raisonné &quot;Leonardo da Vinci&quot; (2019) confirms that the painting probably depicts Lisa del Giocondo, with Isabella d&#x27;Este being the only plausible alternative. Scholars have developed several alternative views, arguing that Lisa del Giocondo was the subject of a different portrait, and identifying at least four other paintings referred to by Vasari as the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;. Several other people have been proposed as the subject of the painting, including Isabella of Aragon, Cecilia Gallerani, Costanza d&#x27;Avalos, Duchess of Francavilla, Pacifica Brandano/Brandino, Isabella Gualanda, Caterina Sforza, Bianca Giovanna Sforza, Salaì, and even Leonardo himself. Psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud theorized that Leonardo imparted an approving smile from his mother, Caterina, onto the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; and other works like &quot;The Baptism of Christ&quot;, &quot;Virgin of the Rocks&quot;, and &quot;The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne&quot;.

==Description==
The &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; bears a strong resemblance to many Renaissance depictions of the Virgin Mary, who was at that time seen as an ideal for womanhood. The woman sits markedly upright in a pozzetto armchair with her arms folded, a sign of her reserved posture. Her gaze is fixed on the observer. The woman appears alive to an unusual extent, which Leonardo achieved by his method of not drawing outlines. The soft blending (&quot;sfumato&quot;) creates an ambiguous mood &quot;mainly in two features: the corners of the mouth, and the corners of the eyes&quot;.

The depiction of the sitter in three-quarter profile is similar to late 15th-century works by Lorenzo di Credi and Agnolo di Domenico del Mazziere. Frank Zöllner notes that the sitter&#x27;s general position can be traced back to Flemish models and that &quot;in particular the vertical slices of columns at both sides of the panel had precedents in Flemish portraiture.&quot; Woods-Marsden cites Hans Memling&#x27;s portrait of Benedetto Portinari (1487) or Italian imitations such as Sebastiano Mainardi&#x27;s pendant portraits for the use of a &quot;loggia&quot;, which has the effect of mediating between the sitter and the distant landscape, a feature missing from Leonardo&#x27;s earlier portrait of &quot;Ginevra de&#x27; Benci&quot;.

The painting was one of the first Italian portraits to depict the sitter in front of an imaginary landscape, although some scholars favour a realistic description, and Leonardo was one of the first painters to use aerial perspective. The enigmatic woman is portrayed seated in what appears to be an open loggia with dark pillar bases on either side. Behind her, a vast landscape recedes to icy mountains, winding paths and a distant bridge, giving only the slightest indications of human presence. Leonardo chose to place the horizon line not at the neck, as he did with &quot;Ginevra de&#x27; Benci&quot;, but on a level with the eyes, thus linking the figure with the landscape and emphasizing the mysterious nature of the painting. The bridge in the background was identified by Silvano Vincenti as the four-arched Romito di Laterina bridge from Etruscan-Roman times near Laterina, Arezzo, over the Arno river. Other bridges with similar arches suggested as possible locations had more arches. Some observers find similarities with the Azzone Visconti Bridge.

&quot;Mona Lisa&quot; has no clearly visible eyebrows or eyelashes, although Vasari describes the eyebrows in detail. In 2007, French engineer Pascal Cotte announced that his ultra-high resolution scans of the painting provide evidence that &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; was originally painted with eyelashes and eyebrows but that these had gradually disappeared over time, perhaps as a result of overcleaning. Cotte discovered that the painting had been reworked several times, with changes made to the size of the face and the direction of gaze. He also found that in one layer the subject was depicted wearing numerous hairpins and a headdress adorned with pearls which was later scrubbed out and overpainted.

There has been much speculation regarding the painting&#x27;s sitter and landscape background. For example, Leonardo probably painted his sitter&#x27;s appearance faithfully since her beauty is not seen as being among the best, &quot;even when measured by late quattrocento (15th century) or even twenty-first century standards.&quot; Some historians in Eastern art, such as Yukio Yashiro, argue that the landscape in the background of the picture was influenced by Chinese paintings; this thesis has been contested for lack of clear evidence.

Research in 2003 by Professor Margaret Livingstone of Harvard University said that Mona Lisa&#x27;s smile disappears when observed with direct vision, known as foveal. Because of the way the human eye processes visual information, it is less suited to pick up shadows directly; however, peripheral vision can pick up shadows well. Research in 2008 by a geomorphology professor at Urbino University and an artist-photographer revealed that &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;s landscape was similar to some views in the Montefeltro region in the Italian provinces of Pesaro and Urbino, and Rimini. Research in 2023/2024 by geologist and art historian Ann Pizzorusso suggests that the landscape contains &quot;several recognisable features of Lecco, on the shores of Lake Como in the Lombardy region of northern Italy.&quot;

==History==
===Creation and date===
Of Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s works, the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; is the only portrait whose authenticity has never been seriously questioned, and one of four works—the others being &quot;Saint Jerome in the Wilderness&quot;, &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot; and &quot;The Last Supper&quot;—whose attribution has avoided controversy. He had begun working on a portrait of Lisa del Giocondo, the sitter for the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;, by October 1503. It is believed by some that the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; was begun in 1503 or 1504 in Florence. Although the Louvre states that it was &quot;doubtless painted between 1503 and 1506&quot;, art historian Martin Kemp says that there are some difficulties in confirming the dates with certainty. Alessandro Vezzosi believes that the painting is characteristic of Leonardo&#x27;s style in the final years of his life, post-1513. Other academics argue that, given the historical documentation, Leonardo would have painted the work from 1513. According to Vasari, &quot;after he had lingered over it four years, [he] left it unfinished&quot;. In 1516, Leonardo was invited by King Francis I to work at the Clos Lucé near the Château d&#x27;Amboise; it is believed that he took the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; with him and continued to work on it after he moved to France. Art historian Carmen C. Bambach has concluded that Leonardo probably continued refining the work until 1516 or 1517. Leonardo&#x27;s right hand was paralytic , which may indicate why he left the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; unfinished.
&quot;Circa&quot; 1505, Raphael executed a pen-and-ink sketch, in which the columns flanking the subject are more apparent. Experts universally agree that it is based on Leonardo&#x27;s portrait. Other later copies of the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;, such as those in the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design and The Walters Art Museum, also display large flanking columns. As a result, it was thought that the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; had been trimmed. By 1993, Frank Zöllner observed that the painting surface had never been trimmed; this was confirmed through a series of tests in 2004. In view of this, Vincent Delieuvin, curator of 16th-century Italian painting at the Louvre, states that the sketch and these other copies must have been inspired by another version, while Zöllner states that the sketch may be after another Leonardo portrait of the same subject.

The record of an October 1517 visit by Louis d&#x27;Aragon states that the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; was executed for the deceased Giuliano de&#x27; Medici, Leonardo&#x27;s steward at Belvedere, Vienna, between 1513 and 1516; this was likely an error. According to Vasari, the painting was created for the sitter&#x27;s husband, Francesco del Giocondo. A number of experts have argued that Leonardo made two versions (because of the uncertainty concerning its dating and commissioner, as well as its fate following Leonardo&#x27;s death in 1519, and the difference of details in Raphael&#x27;s sketch—which may be explained by the possibility that he made the sketch from memory). The hypothetical first portrait, displaying prominent columns, would have been commissioned by Giocondo , and left unfinished in Leonardo&#x27;s pupil and assistant Salaì&#x27;s possession until his death in 1524. The second, commissioned by Giuliano de&#x27; Medici , would have been sold by Salaì to Francis I in 1518, and is the one in the Louvre today. Others believe that there was only one true &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; but are divided as to the two aforementioned fates. At some point in the 16th century, a varnish was applied to the painting. It was kept at the Palace of Fontainebleau until Louis XIV moved it to the Palace of Versailles, where it remained until the French Revolution. In 1797, it went on permanent display at the Louvre.

===Refuge, theft, and vandalism===

After the French Revolution, the painting was moved to the Louvre but spent a brief period in the bedroom of Napoleon (d. 1821) in the Tuileries Palace. Although the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; was not widely known outside the art world, in the 1860s a portion of the French intelligentsia began to hail it as a masterwork of Renaissance painting. During the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871), the painting was moved from the Louvre to the Brest Arsenal. 

In 1911, the painting was still not popular among the lay-public. On 21 August 1911, the painting was stolen from the Louvre. The painting was first reported missing the next day by painter Louis Béroud. After some confusion as to whether the painting was being photographed somewhere, the Louvre was closed for a week for investigation. French poet Guillaume Apollinaire came under suspicion and was arrested and imprisoned. Apollinaire implicated his friend Pablo Picasso, who was brought in for questioning. Both were later exonerated. The real culprit was Louvre employee Vincenzo Peruggia, who had helped construct the painting&#x27;s glass case. He carried out the theft by entering the building during regular hours, hiding in a broom closet, and walking out with the painting hidden under his coat after the museum had closed.
Peruggia was an Italian patriot who believed that Leonardo&#x27;s painting should have been returned to an Italian museum. Peruggia may have been motivated by an associate whose copies of the original would significantly rise in value after the painting&#x27;s theft. After having kept the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; in his apartment for two years, Peruggia grew impatient and was caught when he attempted to sell it to Giovanni Poggi, director of the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. It was exhibited in the Uffizi Gallery for over two weeks and returned to the Louvre on 4 January 1914. Peruggia served six months in prison for the crime and was hailed for his patriotism in Italy. A year after the theft, &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; journalist Karl Decker wrote that he met an alleged accomplice named Eduardo de Valfierno, who claimed to have masterminded the theft. Forger Yves Chaudron was to have created six copies of the painting to sell in the US while concealing the location of the original. Decker published this account of the theft in 1932.

During World War II, it was again removed from the Louvre and taken first to the Château d&#x27;Amboise, then to the Loc-Dieu Abbey and Château de Chambord, then finally to the Musée Ingres in Montauban. Since the 1990s, the painting has been temporarily moved to accommodate renovations to the Louvre on three occasions: between 1992 and 1995, from 2001 to 2005, and again in 2019. A new queuing system introduced in 2019 reduces the amount of time museum visitors have to wait in line to see the painting. After going through the queue, a group has about 30 seconds to see the painting.

On 30 December 1956, Bolivian Ugo Ungaza Villegas threw a rock at the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; while it was on display at the Louvre. He did so with such force that it shattered the glass case and dislodged a speck of pigment near the left elbow. The painting was protected by glass because a few years earlier a man who claimed to be in love with the painting had cut it with a razor blade and tried to steal it. After this attack, Salvador Dalí wrote in 1963 an essay titled &quot;Why they attack the Mona Lisa&quot;, referencing earlier Freud theories.

Since the 1956 attack, bulletproof glass has been used to shield the painting from any further attacks, and in all subsequent cases the painting was undamaged. On 21 April 1974, while the painting was on display at the Tokyo National Museum, a woman sprayed it with red paint as a protest against that museum&#x27;s failure to provide access for disabled people. On 2 August 2009, a Russian woman, distraught over being denied French citizenship, threw a ceramic teacup purchased at the Louvre; the vessel shattered against the glass enclosure.

On 29 May 2022, a male activist, disguised as a woman in a wheelchair, threw cake at the protective glass covering the painting in an apparent attempt to raise awareness for climate change; the painting was not damaged. The man was arrested and placed in psychiatric care in the police headquarters, and an investigation was opened after the Louvre filed a complaint. On 28 January 2024, two attackers from the environmentalist group Riposte Alimentaire (Food Retaliation) threw soup at the painting&#x27;s protective glass, demanding the right to &quot;healthy and sustainable food&quot; and criticizing the contemporary state of agriculture; the painting was not damaged.

=== Modern analysis ===
In the early 21st century, French scientist Pascal Cotte hypothesized a hidden portrait underneath the surface of the painting. He analysed the painting in the Louvre with reflective light technology beginning in 2004, and produced circumstantial evidence for his theory. Cotte admits that his investigation was carried out only in support of his hypotheses and should not be considered as definitive proof. The underlying portrait appears to be of a sitter looking to the side, and lacks flanking columns, but it does not fit with historical descriptions of the painting. Both Vasari and Gian Paolo Lomazzo describe the subject as smiling, unlike the subject in Cotte&#x27;s supposed portrait. In 2020, Cotte published a study alleging that the painting has an underdrawing, transferred from a preparatory drawing via the &quot;spolvero&quot; technique.

==Conservation==

The &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; has survived for more than 500 years, and an international commission convened in 1952 noted that &quot;the picture is in a remarkable state of preservation.&quot; It has never been fully restored, so the current condition is partly due to a variety of conservation treatments the painting has undergone. A detailed analysis in 1933 by Madame de Gironde revealed that earlier restorers had &quot;acted with a great deal of restraint.&quot; Nevertheless, applications of varnish made to the painting had darkened even by the end of the 16th century, and an aggressive 1809 cleaning and revarnishing removed some of the uppermost portion of the paint layer, resulting in a washed-out appearance to the face of the figure. Despite the treatments, the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; has been well cared for throughout its history, and although the panel&#x27;s warping caused the curators &quot;some worry&quot;, the 2004–05 conservation team was optimistic about the future of the work.

===Poplar panel===
At some point, the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; was removed from its original frame. The unconstrained poplar panel warped freely with changes in humidity, and as a result, a crack developed near the top of the panel, extending down to the hairline of the figure. In the mid-18th century to early 19th century, two butterfly-shaped walnut braces were inserted into the back of the panel to a depth of about one third the thickness of the panel. This intervention was skilfully executed, and successfully stabilized the crack. Sometime between 1888 and 1905, or perhaps during the picture&#x27;s theft, the upper brace fell out. A later restorer glued and lined the resulting socket and crack with cloth. The picture is kept under strict, climate-controlled conditions in its bulletproof glass case. The humidity is maintained at 50% ±10%, and the temperature is maintained between and . To compensate for fluctuations in relative humidity, the case is supplemented with a bed of silica gel treated to provide 55% relative humidity.

===Frame===
Because the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;″s poplar support expands and contracts with changes in humidity, the picture has experienced some warping. In response to warping and swelling experienced during its storage during World War II, and to prepare the picture for an exhibit to honour the anniversary of Leonardo&#x27;s 500th birthday, the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; was fitted in 1951 with a flexible oak frame with beech crosspieces. This flexible frame, which is used in addition to the decorative frame, exerts pressure on the panel to keep it from warping further. In 1970, the beech crosspieces were switched to maple after it was found that the beechwood had been infested with insects. In 2004–05, a conservation and study team replaced the maple crosspieces with sycamore ones, and an additional metal crosspiece was added for scientific measurement of the panel&#x27;s warp. The &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; has had many different decorative frames in its history. In 1909, the art collector Comtesse de Béhague gave the portrait its current frame, a Renaissance-era work consistent with the historical period of the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;. The edges of the painting have been trimmed at least once in its history to fit the picture into various frames, albeit no part of the original paint layer has been trimmed.

===Cleaning and touch-up===
The first and most extensive recorded cleaning, revarnishing, and touch-up of the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; was an 1809 wash and revarnishing undertaken by Jean-Marie Hooghstoel, who was responsible for the restoration of paintings for the galleries of the Musée Napoléon. The work involved cleaning with spirits, touch-ups of colour, and revarnishing the painting. In 1906, Louvre restorer Eugène Denizard performed watercolour retouches on areas of the paint layer disturbed by the crack in the panel. Denizard also retouched the edges of the picture with varnish to mask areas that had been covered initially by an older frame. In 1913, when the painting was recovered after its theft, Denizard was again called upon to work on the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;. Denizard was directed to clean the picture without solvent and to lightly touch up several scratches on the painting with watercolour. In 1952, the varnish layer over the background in the painting was evened out. After the second 1956 attack, restorer Jean-Gabriel Goulinat was directed to touch up the damage to &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;″s left elbow with watercolour. In 1977, a new insect infestation was discovered in the back of the panel as a result of crosspieces installed to keep the painting from warping. This was treated on the spot with carbon tetrachloride, and later with an ethylene oxide treatment. In 1985, the spot was again treated with carbon tetrachloride as a preventive measure.

===Display===
On 6 April 2005—following a period of curatorial maintenance, recording, and analysis—the painting was moved to a new location within the museum&#x27;s Salle des États. It is displayed in a purpose-built, climate-controlled enclosure behind bulletproof glass. Since 2005, the painting has been illuminated by an LED lamp, and a new 20-watt LED lamp that was specially designed for this painting was installed in 2013. The lamp has a Colour Rendering Index of up to 98 and minimizes infrared and ultraviolet radiation, which could otherwise degrade the painting. The renovation of the gallery where the painting now resides was financed by the Japanese broadcaster Nippon Television. As of 2019, about 10.2 million people view the painting at the Louvre each year.

On the 500th anniversary of the master&#x27;s death, the Louvre held the largest ever single exhibit of Leonardo&#x27;s works from 24 October 2019 to 24 February 2020. The &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; was not included because it is in such great demand among visitors to the museum; the painting remained on display in its gallery. In 2024, it was decided to place the panel in a separate room. This change will require significant construction changes, including a new entrance to the Louvre and two rooms in the basement under the museum&#x27;s square courtyard. Due to the renovation, visitors will be able to pass directly to the painting, which will reduce queues at the Louvre.

==Legacy==

The &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; began influencing contemporary Florentine painting even before its completion. Raphael, who had been to Leonardo&#x27;s workshop several times, promptly used elements of the portrait&#x27;s composition and format in several of his works, such as &quot;Young Woman with Unicorn&quot; (), and &quot;Portrait of Maddalena Doni&quot; (). Later paintings by Raphael, such as (1515–16) and &quot;Portrait of Baldassare Castiglione&quot; (), continued to borrow from Leonardo&#x27;s painting. Zollner states that &quot;None of Leonardo&#x27;s works would exert more influence upon the evolution of the genre than the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;. It became the definitive example of the Renaissance portrait and perhaps for this reason is seen not just as the likeness of a real person, but also as the embodiment of an ideal.&quot;

Where earlier critics such as Vasari in the 16th century and André Félibien in the 17th praised the picture for its realism, by the mid-19th century, writers began to regard the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; as imbued with a sense of mystery and romance. In 1859, Théophile Gautier wrote that the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; was a &quot;sphinx of beauty who smiles so mysteriously&quot; and that &quot;Beneath the form expressed one feels a thought that is vague, infinite, inexpressible. One is moved, troubled ... repressed desires, hopes that drive one to despair, stir painfully.&quot; Walter Pater&#x27;s essay of 1869 described the sitter as &quot;older than the rocks among which she sits; like the vampire, she has been dead many times, and learned the secrets of the grave; and has been a diver in the deep seas, and keeps their fallen day about her.&quot;

By the early 20th century, some critics started to feel the painting had become a repository for subjective exegeses and theories. Upon the painting&#x27;s theft in 1911, Renaissance historian Bernard Berenson admitted that it had &quot;simply become an incubus, and [he] was glad to be rid of her.&quot; Jean Metzinger&#x27;s &quot;Le goûter (Tea Time)&quot; was exhibited at the 1911 Salon d&#x27;Automne and was sarcastically described as &quot;la Joconde à la cuiller&quot; (Mona Lisa with a spoon) by art critic Louis Vauxcelles on the front page of Gil Blas. André Salmon subsequently described the painting as &quot;The Mona Lisa of Cubism&quot;.

The avant-garde art world has made note of the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;″s undeniable popularity. Because of the painting&#x27;s overwhelming stature, Dadaists and Surrealists often produce modifications and caricatures. In 1883, &quot;Le rire,&quot; an image of a &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; smoking a pipe, by Sapeck (Eugène Bataille), was shown at the &quot;Incoherents&quot; show in Paris. In 1919, Marcel Duchamp, one of the most influential modern artists, created &quot;L.H.O.O.Q.&quot;, a &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; parody made by adorning a cheap reproduction with a moustache and goatee. Duchamp added an inscription, which when read out loud in French sounds like &quot;Elle a chaud au cul&quot; (meaning &quot;she has a hot ass&quot;), implying the woman in the painting is in a state of sexual excitement and intended as a Freudian joke. According to Rhonda R. Shearer, the apparent reproduction is in fact a copy partly modelled on Duchamp&#x27;s own face.

Salvador Dalí, famous for his surrealist work, painted &quot;Self portrait as Mona Lisa&quot; in 1954. Andy Warhol created serigraph prints of multiple &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;s, called &quot;Thirty Are Better than One&quot;, following the painting&#x27;s visit to the United States in 1963. The French urban artist known pseudonymously as Invader has created versions of the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; on city walls in Paris and Tokyo using a mosaic style. A 2014 &quot;New Yorker&quot; magazine cartoon parodies the supposed enigma of the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; smile in an animation showing progressively more maniacal smiles.

===Fame===
In the 21st century, the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; is considered the most famous painting in the world, a destination painting. Until the 20th century, it was one among many highly regarded artworks. Once part of King Francis I of France&#x27;s collection, the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; was among the first artworks to be exhibited in the Louvre, which became a national museum after the French Revolution. Leonardo began to be revered as a genius, and the painting&#x27;s popularity grew in the mid-19th century when French intelligentsia praised it as mysterious and a representation of the femme fatale. The Baedeker guide in 1878 called it &quot;the most celebrated work of Leonardo in the Louvre&quot;, but the painting was known more by the intelligentsia than the general public.

The 1911 theft of the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; and its subsequent return was reported worldwide, leading to a massive increase in public recognition of the painting. During the 20th century, it was an object for mass reproduction, merchandising, lampooning, and speculation, and was claimed to have been reproduced in &quot;300 paintings and 2,000 advertisements&quot;. The &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; was regarded as &quot;just another Leonardo until early last century, when the scandal of the painting&#x27;s theft from the Louvre and subsequent return kept a spotlight on it over several years.&quot;
From December 1962 to March 1963, the French government lent it to the United States to be displayed in New York City and Washington, D.C. It was shipped on the new ocean liner SS &quot;France&quot;. In New York, an estimated 1.7 million people queued &quot;in order to cast a glance at the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; for 20 seconds or so.&quot; While exhibited in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the painting was nearly drenched in water because of a faulty sprinkler; the painting&#x27;s bullet-proof glass case protected it. In 1974, the painting was exhibited in Tokyo and Moscow. In 2014, 9.3 million people visited the Louvre. Former director Henri Loyrette reckoned that &quot;80 percent of the people only want to see the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;.&quot;

===Financial worth===
Before the 1962–1963 tour, the painting was assessed for insurance at $100 million (equivalent to in ), making it, in practice, the most highly-valued painting in the world. The insurance was not purchased; instead, more was spent on security. In 2014, a France 24 article suggested that the painting could be sold to help ease the national debt, although it was observed that the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; and other such art works were prohibited from being sold by French heritage law, which states that, &quot;Collections held in museums that belong to public bodies are considered public property and cannot be otherwise.&quot;

==Early versions and copies==


===&quot;Prado Museum La Gioconda&quot;===
A version of &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; known as (&quot;Woman by Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s hand&quot;, Museo del Prado, Madrid) was for centuries considered to be a work by Leonardo. Since its restoration in 2012, it is now thought to have been executed by one of Leonardo&#x27;s pupils in his studio at the same time as &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; was being painted. The Prado&#x27;s conclusion that the painting is probably by Salaì (1480–1524) or by Melzi (1493–1572) has been called into question by others. The restored painting is from a slightly different perspective than the original &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;, leading to the speculation that it is part of the world&#x27;s first stereoscopic pair; however, a 2017 report demonstrated that this stereoscopic pair in fact gives no reliable stereoscopic depth.

===&quot;Isleworth Mona Lisa&quot;===
A version of the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; known as the &quot;Isleworth Mona Lisa&quot; was first bought by an English nobleman in 1778 and was rediscovered in 1913 by Hugh Blaker, an art connoisseur. The painting was presented to the media in 2012 by the Mona Lisa Foundation. It is a painting of the same subject as Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;. The current scholarly consensus on attribution is unclear. Some experts, including Frank Zöllner, Martin Kemp, and Luke Syson denied the attribution to Leonardo; professors such as Salvatore Lorusso, Andrea Natali, and John F Asmus supported it; others like Alessandro Vezzosi and Carlo Pedretti were uncertain.

===&quot;Hermitage Mona Lisa&quot;===

A version known as the &quot;Hermitage Mona Lisa&quot; is in the Hermitage Museum and it was made by an unknown 16th-century artist.

==&quot;Mona Lisa&quot; illusion==
If a person being photographed looks into the camera lens, the image produced provides an illusion that viewers perceive as the subject looking at them, irrespective of the photograph&#x27;s position. It is presumably for this reason that many people, while taking photographs, ask subjects to look at the camera rather than anywhere else. In psychology, this is known as the &quot;&quot;Mona Lisa&quot; illusion&quot;, which was named after the famous painting that also presents the same illusion.

<text>Otto Rank (; Austrian ; né Rosenfeld; 22 April 1884 – 31 October 1939) was an Austrian psychoanalyst, writer, and philosopher. Born in Vienna, he was one of Sigmund Freud&#x27;s closest colleagues for 20 years, a prolific writer on psychoanalytic themes, editor of the two leading analytic journals of the era, including &quot;Internationale Zeitschrift für Psychoanalyse&quot; (“International Journal of Psychoanalysis”), managing director of Freud&#x27;s publishing house, and a creative theorist and therapist. In 1926, Rank left Vienna for Paris and, for the remainder of his life, led a successful career as a lecturer, writer, and therapist in France and the United States.

== In the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society ==

Rank was born in 1884 as Otto Rosenfeld, the son of a Jewish craftsman in Vienna. In 1905, at the age of 21, he so impressed Freud with a study that he invited Rank to become Secretary of the emerging Vienna Psychoanalytic Society. 

Rank thus became the first paid member of the psychoanalytic movement, and Freud&#x27;s &quot;right-hand man&quot; for almost 20 years. Freud considered Rank, with whom he was more intimate intellectually than his own sons, to be the most brilliant of his Viennese disciples.

Encouraged and supported by Freud, Rank completed the &quot;Gymnasium&quot; or college-preparatory high school, attended the University of Vienna, and was awarded his PhD in literature in 1912. His thesis, on the Lohengrin saga, was published in 1911, the first Freudian doctoral dissertation to be published as a book.

Rank was one of Freud&#x27;s six collaborators brought together in a secret &quot;committee&quot; or &quot;ring&quot; to defend the psychoanalytic mainstream as disputes with Alfred Adler and Carl Jung developed. Rank was the most prolific author in the &quot;ring&quot; besides Freud himself, extending psychoanalytic theory to the study of legend, myth, art, creativity and &quot;The Double&quot; (&quot;Doppelgänger&quot;). 

He worked closely with Freud, contributing two chapters on myth and legend to Freud&#x27;s key monograph &quot;The Interpretation of Dreams&quot;. Rank&#x27;s name appeared underneath Freud&#x27;s on the title page of Freud&#x27;s greatest work from 1914 until 1930. Between 1915 and 1918, Rank served as Secretary of the International Psychoanalytical Association which Freud had founded in 1910. Everyone in the small psychoanalytic world understood how much Freud respected Rank and his prolific creativity in expanding psychoanalytic theory. Freud announced to his inner circle, full of jealous rivals, that Rank was &quot;my heir.&quot;

In 1924, Rank published &quot;Das Trauma der Geburt&quot; (translated into English as &quot;The Trauma of Birth&quot; in 1929), exploring how art, myth, religion, philosophy and therapy were illuminated by separation anxiety in the &quot;phase before the development of the Oedipus complex.&quot; But there was no such phase in Freud&#x27;s theories. The Oedipus complex, Freud explained, was the nucleus of the neurosis and the foundational source of all art, myth, religion, philosophy, therapy – indeed of all human culture and civilization. It was the first time that anyone in the inner circle had dared to suggest that the Oedipus complex might not be the supreme causal factor in psychoanalysis. Rank coined the term &quot;pre-Oedipal&quot; in a public psychoanalytic forum in 1925. In a 1930 self-analysis of his own writings, Rank observes that &quot;the pre-Oedipal super-ego has since been overemphasized by Melanie Klein, without any reference to me.&quot;

After some hesitation, Freud distanced himself from &quot;The Trauma of Birth,&quot; signaling to other members of his inner circle that Rank was perilously close to anti-Oedipal heresy. &quot;I am boiling with rage,&quot; Freud told Sándor Ferenczi, then Rank&#x27;s best friend (Kramer, 2015). Confronted with Freud&#x27;s decisive opposition, Rank resigned in protest from his positions as Vice-President of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society, director of Freud&#x27;s publishing house, and co-editor of &quot;Imago&quot; and &quot;Zeitschrift&quot;. 

Ferenczi, with whom Rank had collaborated from 1920 through 1924 on new experiential, object-relational and &quot;here-and-now&quot; approaches to therapy, vacillated on the significance of Rank&#x27;s pre-Oedipal theory but not on Rank&#x27;s objections to classical analytic technique.

The recommendation in Freud&#x27;s technical papers for analysts to be emotionless, according to Ferenczi and Rank (1924), had led to &quot;an unnatural elimination of all human factors in the analysis&quot; (pp. 40–41), and to &quot;a theorizing of experience [&quot;Erlebnis&quot;]&quot; (p. 41): the feeling experience of the intersubjective relationship, two first-person experiences, within the analytic situation. 

According to Sandor Rado, an influential analyst in New York who helped found the psychoanalytic center at Columbia University, &quot;The characteristic of that time was a neglect of a human being&#x27;s emotional life ... Everybody was looking for oral, pregenital, and genital components in motivation. But that some people are happy, others unhappy, some afraid, or full of anger, and some loving and affectionate – read the case histories to find how such differences between people were then absent from the literature.&quot; (Roazen &amp; Swerdloff, 1995, pp. 82–83)

All emotional experience by human beings was being reduced by analysis to a derivative, no matter how disguised, of libido. For Freud, emotion was always sexual, derived from a dangerous Id that must be surgically uprooted: &quot;Where Id was [&quot;Wo es war&quot;],&quot; Freud said famously, &quot;there ego shall be [&quot;soll ich werden&quot;]&quot; (S.E., 22:80).

&quot;Libido,&quot; according to Freud&#x27;s 1921 work on &quot;Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego&quot; (S.E., 18: 90), &quot;is an expression taken from the theory of the emotions.&quot; Emotion is the cause of neurotic disorder. Increases in emotion, according to Freud, are unpleasurable. Cure, for Freud, means analyzing, &quot;working through&quot; and eventually uprooting the emotions of the patient, &quot;like the draining of the Zuyder Zee&quot; (Freud, S.E., 22:80). The analyst makes the unconscious conscious by providing cognitive insight to the patient, thereby subduing the pressing drive for the irrational, for emotions – for the Id – to emerge from the patient&#x27;s unconscious (Kramer, 2019, pp. 45–48).
In a 1927 lecture, Rank (1996) observes that &quot;surgical therapy is uprooting and isolates the individual emotionally, as it tries to deny the emotional life&quot; (p. 169), the same attack he and Ferenczi had leveled against psychoanalytic practice in their joint work. Reducing all emotional experience—all feeling, loving, thinking, and willing—to sex was one of Freud&#x27;s biggest mistakes, according to Rank, who first pointed out this confusion in the mid-twenties. Emotions, said Rank, are relationships. Denial of the emotional life leads to denial of the will, the creative life, as well as denial of the interpersonal relationship in the analytic situation (Rank, 1929–31).

For Freud, said Rank in &quot;Will Therapy&quot; (1929–31), &quot;the emotional life develops from the sexual sphere, therefore his sexualization in reality means emotionalization&quot; (p. 165), two experiences that psychoanalysts continued to conflate for half a century after Freud&#x27;s death. Psychoanalysis had no theory of emotional experience and, by extension, no theory of emotional intelligence. Weinstein (2001) identified over two dozen articles in the major psychoanalytic journals criticizing the incomplete and confused theory of emotions in psychoanalysis. comments persisted through to the 1990s&quot; (Weinstein, 2001, p. 40).

&quot;The emotional impoverishment of psychoanalysis,&quot; wrote Ernest Becker (1973) in &quot;The Denial of Death&quot;, which was strongly influenced by Rank&#x27;s ideas, &quot;must extend also to many analysts themselves and to psychiatrists who come under its ideology. This fact helps explain the terrible deadness of emotion that one experiences in psychiatric settings, the heavy weight of the character armor erected against the world&quot; (p. 195n).

Written privately in 1932, Ferenczi&#x27;s &quot;Clinical Diary&quot; identified the &quot;personal causes for the erroneous development of psychoanalysis&quot; (Ferenczi, 1995, p. 184). 

According to Ferenczi, &quot;… One learned from [Freud] and from his kind of technique various things that made one&#x27;s life and work more comfortable: the calm, unemotional reserve; the unruffled assurance that one knows better; and the theories, the seeking and finding of the causes of failure in the patient instead of partly in ourselves … and finally the pessimistic view, shared only with a few, that neurotics are a rabble [&quot;Gesindel&quot;], good only to support us financially and to allow us to learn from their cases: psychoanalysis as a therapy may be worthless&quot; (Ferenczi, 1995, pp. 185–186).

After Freud turned against Rank, Ferenczi publicly rejected &quot;The Trauma of Birth&quot;, shunning Rank during a chance meeting in 1926 at Penn Station in New York. &quot;He was my best friend and he refused to speak to me,&quot; Rank said (Taft, 1958, p. xvi).

Ferenczi&#x27;s rupture with Rank cut short radical innovations in practice, and left no one in the inner circle who would champion relational, pre-Oedipal or &quot;here-and-now&quot; psychotherapy. Classical psychoanalysis, along the lines of Freud&#x27;s 1911–15 technical writings, would now be entrenched in training institutes around the world. The attack leveled in 1924 by Ferenczi and Rank on the increasing &quot;fanaticism for interpretation&quot; and the &quot;unnatural elimination of all human factors&quot; from the practice of analysis would be forgotten (Kramer, 2019, p. 19).

Relational, expressive and &quot;here-and-now&quot; therapy would not be acceptable to most members of the American Psychoanalytic Association or the International Psychoanalytic Association for half a century. &quot;[T]hose who had the misfortune to be analyzed by [Rank] were required to undergo a &quot;second&quot; analysis in order to qualify&quot; for membership in the American Psychoanalytic Association (Lieberman, 1985, p. 293).

== Post-Vienna life and work ==
In May 1926, having made the feeling relationship in the &quot;here-and-now&quot; central to his practice of psychotherapy, Rank moved to Paris where he became a psychotherapist for artists such as Henry Miller and Anaïs Nin and lectured at the Sorbonne (Lieberman, 1985).

Nin was transformed by her therapy with Rank. On her second visit to Rank, she reflects on her desire to be &quot;re-born,&quot; feelingly, as a woman and artist. Rank, she observes, helped her move back and forth between what she could verbalize in her journals and what remained unarticulated. She discovered the quality and depth of her feelings in the wordless transitions between what she could say and what she could not say. &quot;As he talked, I thought of my difficulties with writing, my struggles to articulate feelings not easily expressed. Of my struggles to find a language for intuition, feeling, instincts which are, in themselves, elusive, subtle, and wordless&quot; (Nin, 1966, p. 276).

According to Rank, all feelings are grounded in the present. In &quot;Will Therapy,&quot; published in German in 1929–31, Rank uses the term &quot;here and now&quot; for the first time in the psychotherapeutic literature: &quot;Freud made the repression historical, that is, misplaced it into the childhood of the individual and then wanted to release it from there, while as a matter of fact the same tendency is working here and now&quot; (Rank, 1929–31, p. 39). 

Instead of the word &quot;Verdrängung&quot; (&quot;repression&quot;), which laid stress on unconscious repression of the past, Rank preferred to use the word &quot;Verleugnung&quot; (&quot;denial&quot;), which focused instead on the emotional will to remain ill in the present: &quot;The neurotic lives too much in the past [and] to that extent he actually does not live. He suffers … because he clings to [the past], wants to cling to it, in order to protect himself from experience [&quot;Erlebnis&quot;], the emotional surrender to the present&quot; (Rank, 1929–31, p. 27).

In France and later in America, Rank enjoyed great success as a therapist and writer from 1926 to 1939. Traveling frequently between France and America, Rank lectured at universities such as Harvard, Yale, Stanford, and University of Pennsylvania on relational, experiential and &quot;here-and-now&quot; psychotherapy, art, the creative will, and &quot;neurosis as a failure in creativity&quot; (Rank, 1996).

Just as Erik Erikson was the first analyst to focus on identity and adulthood, Rank was the first to propose that separation from outworn thoughts, feelings and behaviors is the quintessence of psychological growth and development. In the late 1920s, after he left Freud&#x27;s inner circle, Rank explored how human beings can learn to assert their will within relationships, and advocated a maximum degree of individuation (or &quot;difference&quot;) within a maximum degree of connectedness (or &quot;likeness&quot;). Human beings need to experience &quot;both&quot; separation and union, without endlessly vacillating between the two poles.

Foreshadowing the central themes of Piaget, Kohlberg, McClelland, Erikson and Robert Kegan, Rank was the first to propose that human development is a lifelong construction, which requires continual negotiation and renegotiation of the dual yearnings for individuation and connection, the will to separate and the will to unite. Decades before Ronald Fairbairn, now credited by many as the inventor in the 1940s of modern object-relations theory, Rank&#x27;s 1926 lecture on &quot;The Genesis of the Object Relation&quot; marks the first complete statement of this theory (Rank, 1996, pp. 140–149). 

By 1926, Rank was persona non grata in the official psychoanalytic world. There is little reason to believe, therefore, that any of the other writers credited with helping to invent object relations theory (Melanie Klein or Donald Winnicott, for example) ever read the German text of this lecture, published as &quot;Zur Genese der Object-beziehung&quot; in Vol. 1 of Rank&#x27;s &quot;Genetische Psychologie&quot; (1927, pp. 110–122).

Rank died in New York City in 1939 from a kidney infection, one month after Freud&#x27;s physician-assisted suicide on the Jewish Day of Atonement. &quot;Komisch&quot; (strange, odd, comical), Rank said on his deathbed (Lieberman, 1985, p. 389).

== Influence ==
Rollo May, a pioneer of existential psychotherapy in the United States, was deeply influenced by Rank&#x27;s post-Freudian lectures and writings and always considered Rank to be the most important precursor of existential therapy. Shortly before his death, Rollo May wrote the foreword to Robert Kramer&#x27;s edited collection of Rank&#x27;s American lectures. &quot;I have long considered Otto Rank to be the great unacknowledged genius in Freud&#x27;s circle,&quot; said May (Rank, 1996, p. xi).

In 1924, Jessie Taft, an early feminist philosopher, social worker, and student of George H. Mead, met Otto Rank. After becoming his patient, she was inspired to develop &quot;relationship therapy&quot; and eventually, the &quot;functional model of social work&quot; at the Pennsylvania School of Social Work, both explicitly based on Rank&#x27;s ideas. Taft (1958) wrote the first biography of Rank and had a profound understanding of his thinking on how the creative will emerges from the empathic relationship between client and social worker.

In addition, it was Jessie Taft and Frederick Allen&#x27;s work at the Philadelphia Child Guidance Clinic that introduced Carl Rogers, then a psychologist in the Child Study Department of the Rochester Society for the Prevention of Cruelty Children, to &quot;relationship therapy&quot; as the practical application of Rank&#x27;s ideas.

In 1936 Carl Rogers, influenced by social workers on his staff trained at the University of Pennsylvania School of Social Work, invited Otto Rank to give a series of lectures in New York on Rank&#x27;s post-Freudian models of experiential and relational therapy. Rogers was transformed by these lectures and always credited Rank with having profoundly shaped &quot;client-centered&quot; therapy and the entire profession of counseling. 

The New York writer Paul Goodman, who was co-founder with Fritz Perls of the Gestalt method of psychotherapy that makes Otto Rank&#x27;s &quot;here-and-now&quot; central to its approach, described Rank&#x27;s post-Freudian ideas on art and creativity as &quot;beyond praise&quot; in &quot;Gestalt Therapy&quot; (Perls, Goodman and Hefferline, 1951, p. 395). Erving Polster, another well-known Gestalt therapist, was also strongly influenced by Rank&#x27;s practice of focusing on the &quot;here-and-now&quot;: &quot;Rank brought the human relationship directly into his office. He influenced analysts to take seriously the actual present interaction between therapist and patient, rather than maintain the fixed, distant, &#x27;as though&#x27; relationship that had given previous analysts an emotional buffer for examining the intensities of therapeutic sensation and wish. Rank&#x27;s contributions opened the way for &quot;encounter&quot; to become accepted as a deep therapeutic agent&quot; (Polster, 1968, p. 6).

Rank also affected the practice of action-oriented and reflective therapies such as dramatic role-playing and psychodrama. &quot;Although there is no evidence of a direct influence, Rank&#x27;s ideas found new life in the work of such action psychotherapists as Moreno, who developed a psychodrama technique of doubling ... and Landy [director of the drama therapy program at New York University], who attempted to conceptualize balance as an integration of role and counterrole&quot; (Landy, 2008, p. 29).

== Summary of main ideas ==
Rank was the first to see therapy as a learning and unlearning experience focusing on feelings. The therapeutic relationship allows the patient to: (1) learn more creative ways of thinking, feeling and being in the here-and-now; and (2) unlearn self-destructive ways of thinking, feeling and being in the here-and-now. Patterns of self-destruction (&quot;neurosis&quot;) represent a failure of creativity and not, as Freud assumed, a retreat from sexuality.

Rank&#x27;s psychoanalysis of creativity has recently been applied to action learning, an inquiry-based process of group problem solving, team building, leader development and organizational learning (Kramer 2007; 2008). Transformative action learning, synthesized by Robert Kramer from Rank&#x27;s writings on art and spirituality, involves real people, working on real problems in real time. Once a safe container is created by a learning coach, questions allow group members to &quot;step out of the frame of the prevailing ideology,&quot; as Rank wrote in &quot;Art and Artist&quot; (1932/1989, p. 70), reflect on their assumptions and beliefs, and reframe their choices. The process of &quot;stepping out&quot; of a frame, out of a form of knowing – a prevailing ideology – is analogous to the work of artists as they struggle to give birth to fresh ways of seeing the world, perspectives that allow them to see aspects of the world that no artists, including themselves, have ever seen before. The heart of transformative action learning, as developed by Kramer, is asking powerful questions to promote the unlearning or letting go of taken-for-granted assumptions and beliefs.

The most creative artists, such as Rembrandt, Michelangelo and Leonardo, know how to separate even from their own greatest public successes, from earlier artistic incarnations of themselves. Their &quot;greatness consists precisely in this reaching out beyond themselves, beyond the ideology which they have themselves fostered,&quot; according to &quot;Art and Artist&quot; (Rank, 1932/1989, p. 368). Through the lens of Otto Rank&#x27;s work on understanding art and artists, transformative action learning can be seen as the never-completed process of learning how to &quot;step out of the frame&quot; of any mindset, whether one&#x27;s own or the culture&#x27;s – in other words, of learning how to unlearn. (Kramer, 2012).

Comparing the process of unlearning to the &quot;breaking out&quot; process of birth, Rank was the first psychologist to suggest that a continual capacity to separate from &quot;internal mental objects&quot; – from internalized institutions, beliefs and neuroses; from the restrictions of culture, social conformity and received wisdom – is the sine qua non for lifelong creativity.

In a 1938 lecture at the University of Minnesota, Rank said: &quot;Life in itself is a mere succession of separations. Beginning with birth, going through several weaning periods and the development of the individual personality, and finally culminating in death – which represents the final separation. At birth, the individual experiences the first shock of separation, which throughout his life he strives to overcome. In the process of adaptation, man persistently separates from his old self, or at least from those segments off his old self that are now outlived. Like a child who has outgrown a toy, he discards the old parts of himself for which he has no further use ….The ego continually breaks away from its worn-out parts, which were of value in the past but have no value in the present. The neurotic [who cannot unlearn, and, therefore, lacks creativity] is unable to accomplish this normal detachment process … Owing to fear and guilt generated in the assertion of his own autonomy, he is unable to free himself, and instead remains suspended upon some primitive level of his evolution&quot; (Rank, 1996, p. 270).

Reframing &quot;resistance&quot; as a creative function, not as opposition to interpretations offered by the psychoanalyst, Rank defined counterwill in the therapeutic relationship as a positive trait that defends the integrity of the self and helps in individuation, unlearning and the discovery of willing.

According to Rank (1932/1989), unlearning or breaking out of our shell from the inside is &quot;a separation [that] is so hard, not only because it involves persons and ideas that one reveres, but because the victory is always, at bottom, and in some form, won over a part of one&#x27;s ego&quot; (p. 375).

In the organizational context, learning how to unlearn is vital because what we assume to be true has merged into our identity. We refer to the identity of an individual as a &quot;mindset.&quot; We refer to the identity of an organizational group as a &quot;culture.&quot; Action learners learn how to question, probe and separate from, both kinds of identity—i.e., their &quot;individual&quot; selves and their &quot;social&quot; selves. By opening themselves to critical inquiry, they begin to learn how to emancipate themselves from what they &quot;know&quot; – they learn how to unlearn.

In 1974, the cultural anthropologist Ernest Becker won the Pulitzer Prize for &quot;The Denial of Death&quot; (1973), which was based on Rank&#x27;s post-Freudian writings, especially &quot;Will Therapy&quot; (1929–1931), &quot;Psychology and the Soul&quot; (1930) and &quot;Art and Artist&quot; (1932/1989). Becker&#x27;s posthumously published book, &quot;Escape from Evil&quot; (1975) was devoted in large measure to exploring Rank&#x27;s psychoanalysis rooted in the idea of history as a succession of immortality ideologies. 

Through the influence of Ernest Becker&#x27;s writings, Rank&#x27;s dialectic between &quot;life fear and death fear&quot; has been tested experimentally in Terror Management Theory by Skidmore College psychology professor Sheldon Solomon, University of Arizona psychology professor Jeff Greenberg, and University of Colorado at Colorado Springs psychology professor Tom Pyszczynski.

The American priest and theologian, Matthew Fox, founder of Creation Spirituality and Wisdom University, considers Rank to be one of the most important psychologists of the 20th century.

Stanislav Grof, a founder of transpersonal psychology, based much of his work in prenatal and perinatal psychology on Rank&#x27;s &quot;The Trauma of Birth&quot; (Kripal, 2007, pp. 249–269).

In 2008, the philosopher Maxine Sheets-Johnstone published &quot;The Roots of Morality&quot; (Pennsylvania State University Press). She compares Rank&#x27;s thought favorably to that of René Descartes, Martin Heidegger and Jacques Derrida: &quot;Because immortality ideologies were originally recognized and in fact so named by Rank, a close examination of his writings on the subject is not only apposite but is itself philosophically rewarding ... Rank was a Freudian dissident who, in introducing the concept of immortality ideologies, traced out historical and psychological roots of &#x27;soul-belief&#x27; (&quot;Seelenglaube&quot;)... [My chapter] points up the extraordinary cogency of Rank&#x27;s distinction between the rational and the irrational to the question of the human need for immortality ideologies&quot; (Sheets-Johnstone, 2008, p. 64). Sheets-Johnstone concludes her book on a note reminiscent of Rank&#x27;s plea for the human value of mutual love over arid intellectual insight: &quot;Surely it is time for &quot;Homo sapiens sapiens&quot; to turn away from the pursuit of domination over all and to begin cultivating and developing its sapiential wisdom in the pursuit of caring, nurturing and strengthening that most precious muscle which is its heart&quot; (ibid., pp. 405–06).

<text>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is an executive department of the United States federal government that aims to meet the needs of commercial farming and livestock food production, promotes agricultural trade and production, works to assure food safety, protects natural resources, fosters rural communities and works to end hunger in the United States and internationally. It is headed by the secretary of agriculture, who reports directly to the president of the United States and is a member of the president&#x27;s Cabinet. The current secretary is Brooke Rollins, who has served since February 13, 2025.

Approximately 71% of the USDA&#x27;s $213 billion budget goes towards nutrition assistance programs administered by the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS). The largest component of the FNS budget is the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly known as the &#x27;Food Stamp&#x27; program), which is the cornerstone of USDA&#x27;s nutrition assistance. The United States Forest Service is the largest agency within the department, which administers national forests and national grasslands that together comprise about 25% of federal lands.

==Overview==
The USDA is divided into eight distinct mission areas, each of which have at least one agency dedicated to the theme of the mission area:

Farm Production and Conservation (FPAC)
* FPAC Business Center
* Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)
* Risk Management Agency (RMA)
* Farm Service Agency (FSA)

Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services (FNCS)
* Food and Nutrition Service (FNS)

Food Safety (FS)
* Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS)

Marketing and Regulatory Programs (MRP)
* Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS)
* Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)

Natural Resources and the Environment (NRE)
* Forest Service (FS)

Research, Education, and Economics (REE)
* National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS)
* National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA)
* Agricultural Research Service (ARS)
* Economic Research Service (ERS)

Rural Development (RD)
* Rural Utilities Service (RUS)
* Rural Housing Service (RHS)
* Rural Business-Cooperative Service (RBS)

Trade and Foreign Agriculture Affairs (TFAA)
* Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS)

Many of the programs concerned with the distribution of food and nutrition to people of the United States and providing nourishment as well as nutrition education to those in need are run by the Food and Nutrition Service. Activities in this program include the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides healthy food to over 40 million low-income and homeless people each month. USDA is a member of the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness, where it is committed to working with other agencies to ensure these mainstream benefits have been accessed by those experiencing homelessness.

The USDA also is concerned with assisting farmers and food producers with the sale of crops and food on both the domestic and world markets. It plays a role in overseas aid programs by providing surplus foods to developing countries. This aid can go through USAID, foreign governments, international bodies such as World Food Program, or approved nonprofits. The Agricultural Act of 1949, section 416 (b) and Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954, also known as Food for Peace, provides the legal basis of such actions. The USDA is a partner of the World Cocoa Foundation.

==History==
The standard history is Gladys L. Baker, ed., &quot;Century of Service: The first 100 years of the United States Department of Agriculture&quot; (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1963).

===Origins in the Patent Office===
Early in its history, the American economy was largely agrarian. Officials in the federal government had long sought new and improved varieties of seeds, plants and animals for import into the United States. In 1829, by request of James Smithson out of a desire to further promulgate and diffuse scientific knowledge amongst the American people, the Smithsonian Institution was established, though it did not incorporate agriculture. In 1837, Henry Leavitt Ellsworth became Commissioner of Patents in the Department of State. He began collecting and distributing new varieties of seeds and plants through members of the Congress and local agricultural societies. In 1839, Congress established the Agricultural Division within the Patent Office and allotted $1,000 for &quot;the collection of agricultural statistics and other agricultural purposes.&quot; Ellsworth&#x27;s interest in aiding agriculture was evident in his annual reports that called for a public depository to preserve and distribute the various new seeds and plants, a clerk to collect agricultural statistics, the preparation of statewide reports about crops in different regions, and the application of chemistry to agriculture. Ellsworth was called the &quot;Father of the Department of Agriculture.&quot;

In 1849, the Patent Office was transferred to the newly created Department of the Interior. In the ensuing years, agitation for a separate bureau within the department or a separate department devoted to agriculture kept recurring.

===History===
On May 15, 1862, Abraham Lincoln established the independent Department of Agriculture through the Morrill Act to be headed by a commissioner without Cabinet status. Staffed by only eight employees, the department was charged with conducting research and development related to &quot;agriculture, rural development, aquaculture and human nutrition in the most general and comprehensive sense of those terms&quot;. Agriculturalist Isaac Newton was appointed to be the first commissioner. Lincoln called it the &quot;people&#x27;s department&quot;, since over half of the nation, at the time, was directly or indirectly involved in agriculture or agribusiness.

In 1868, the department moved into the new Department of Agriculture Building in Washington, designed by famed D.C. architect Adolf Cluss. Located on the National Mall between 12th Street and 14th SW, the department had offices for its staff and the entire width of the Mall up to B Street NW to plant and experiment with plants.

In the 1880s, varied advocacy groups were lobbying for Cabinet representation. Business interests sought a Department of Commerce and Industry, and farmers tried to raise the Department of Agriculture to Cabinet rank. In 1887, the House of Representatives and Senate passed separate bills giving Cabinet status to the Department of Agriculture and Labor, but the bill was defeated in conference committee after farm interests objected to the addition of labor. Finally, in 1889 the Department of Agriculture was given cabinet-level status.

In 1887, the Hatch Act provided for the federal funding of agricultural experiment stations in each state. The Smith-Lever Act of 1914 then funded cooperative extension services in each state to teach agriculture, home economics, and other subjects to the public. With these and similar provisions, the USDA reached out to every county of every state.

===New Deal era===
By the year 1933, the department was well established in Washington and very well known in rural America. In the agricultural field the picture was different. Statisticians created a comprehensive data-gathering arm in the Division of Crop and Livestock Estimates. Secretary Henry Wallace, a statistician, further strengthened the expertise by introducing sampling techniques. Professional economists ran a strong Bureau of Agricultural Economics. Most important was the agricultural experiment station system, a network of state partners in the land-grant colleges, which in turn operated a large field service in direct contact with farmers in practically every rural county. The department worked smoothly with a nationwide, well-organized pressure group, the American Farm Bureau Federation. It represented the largest commercial growers before Congress.

As late as the Great Depression, farm work occupied a fourth of Americans. Indeed, many young people who moved to the cities in the prosperous 1920s returned to the family farm after the depression caused unemployment after 1929. The USDA helped ensure that food continued to be produced and distributed to those who needed it, assisted with loans for small landowners, and provided technical advice. Its Bureau of Home Economics, established in 1923, published shopping advice and recipes to stretch family budgets and make food go farther. In the late 1940s, the Pollinating Insect Research unit was established as a part of the alfalfa seed production unit to study bees and other pollinators to improve pollination management.

=== Modern times ===
On August 27, 2018, the USDA announced it would be providing U.S. farmers with a farm aid package totaling $4.7 billion in direct payments to American farmers. This package is meant to offset the losses farmers are expected to incur from retaliatory tariffs placed on American exports during the first Trump tariffs.

On 7 February 2022, the USDA announced the Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities, a $1 billion program that will test and verify the benefits of climate-friendly agricultural practices.

In October 2022, the USDA announced a $1.3 billion debt relief program for about 36,000 farmers who had fallen behind on loan payments or facing foreclosures. The provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 set aside $3.1 billion to help such farmers with high-risk operations caused by USDA-backed loans.

In February of 2025, the Trump administration fired multiple probationary employees in the USDA, including multiple researchers in the post-doctoral research fellowship in the Agricultural Research Service, a division dedicated to using science to protect the nation&#x27;s food supply. The USDA said in a statement on February 14, 2025 that it is implementing &quot;an aggressive plan to optimize its workforce by eliminating positions that are no longer necessary.&quot; However, a few days later they made another statement stating they had fired people in &quot;several positions supporting&quot; highly pathogenic avian influenza, and was &quot;working to swiftly rectify the situation and rescind&quot; the termination letters given to these people.

==Organization and Component Staff Level==

==Discrimination==

Allegations have been made that throughout the agency&#x27;s history its personnel have discriminated against farmers of various backgrounds, denying them loans and access to other programs well into the 1990s. The effect of this discrimination caused a reduction in the number of African American farmers in the United States. Though African American farmers have been the most hit by discriminatory actions by the USDA, women, Native Americans, Hispanics, and other minorities have experienced discrimination in a variety of forms at the hands of the USDA. The majority of these discriminatory actions have occurred through the Farm Service Agency, which oversees loan and assistance programs to farmers.

In response to the Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling of unconstitutionality of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, Congress enacted the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act of 1936, which established the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) which provided service to private landowners and encouraged subsidies that would relieve soil from excessive farming. The SCS in its early days were hesitant, especially in Southern jurisdictions, to hire Black conservationists. Rather than reaching out to Black students in universities for interviews and job opportunities, students had to reach out for the few opportunities granted to Black conservationists.

As part of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the USDA formally ended racial segregation among its staff. In the 1999 &quot;Pigford v. Glickman&quot; class-action lawsuit brought by African American farmers, the USDA agreed to a billion-dollar settlement due to its patterns of discrimination in the granting of loans and subsidies to black farmers. In 2011, a second round of payouts, &quot;Pigford II,&quot; was appropriated by Congress for $1.25 billion, although this payout, far too late to support the many who desperately needed financial assistance during 1999 lawsuit, only comes out to around $250,000 per farmer.

A March 17, 2006 letter from the GAO about the Pigford Settlement indicated that &quot;the court noted that USDA disbanded its Office of Civil Rights in 1983, and stopped responding to claims of discrimination.&quot;

===&quot;Pigford v. Glickman&quot;===
Following long-standing concerns, black farmers joined a class action discrimination suit against the USDA filed in federal court in 1997. An attorney called it &quot;the most organized, largest civil rights case in the history of the country.&quot; Also in 1997, black farmers from at least five states held protests in front of the USDA headquarters in Washington, D.C. Protests in front of the USDA were a strategy employed in later years as the black farmers sought to keep national attention focused on the plight of the black farmers. Representatives of the National Black Farmers Association met with President Bill Clinton and other administration officials at the White House. And NBFA&#x27;s president testified before the United States House Committee on Agriculture.

In &quot;Pigford v. Glickman&quot;, U.S. Federal District Court Judge Paul L. Friedman approved the settlement and consent decree on April 14, 1999. The settlement recognized discrimination against 22,363 black farmers, but the NBFA would later call the agreement incomplete because more than 70,000 were excluded. Nevertheless, the settlement was deemed to be the largest-ever civil rights class action settlement in American history. Lawyers estimated the value of the settlement to be more than $2 billion. Some farmers would have their debts forgiven. Judge Friedman appointed a monitor to oversee the settlement. Farmers in Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Georgia were among those affected by the settlement.

The NBFA&#x27;s president was invited to testify before congress on this matter numerous times following the settlement, including before the United States Senate Committee on Agriculture on September 12, 2000, when he testified that many farmers had not yet received payments and others were left out of the settlement. It was later revealed that one DoJ staff &quot;general attorney&quot; was unlicensed while she was handling black farmers&#x27; cases. NBFA called for all those cases to be reheard. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; reported in 2004 that the result of such longstanding USDA discrimination was that black farmers had been forced out of business at a rate three times faster than white farmers. In 1920, 1 in 7 U.S. farmers was African-American, and by 2004 the number was 1 in 100. USDA spokesman Ed Loyd, when acknowledging that the USDA loan process was unfair to minority farmers, had claimed it was hard to determine the effect on such farmers.

In 2006 the Government Accountability Office (GAO) issued a report highly critical of the USDA in its handling of the black farmers cases. NBFA continued to lobby Congress to provide relief. NBFA&#x27;s John Boyd (farmer) secured congressional support for legislation that would provide $100 million in funds to settle late-filer cases. In 2006 a bill was introduced into the House of Representatives and later the Senate by Senator George Felix Allen. In 2007 Boyd testified before the United States House Committee on the Judiciary about this legislation. As the organization was making headway by gathering Congressional supporters in 2007 it was revealed that some USDA Farm Services Agency employees were engaged in activities aimed at blocking Congressional legislation that would aid the black farmers. Barack Obama, then a U.S. Senator, lent his support to the black farmers&#x27; issues in 2007. A bill co-sponsored by Obama passed the Senate in 2007.

In early June 2008 hundreds of black farmers, denied a chance to have their cases heard in the &quot;Pigford&quot; settlement, filed a new lawsuit against USDA. The Senate and House versions of the black farmers bill, reopening black farmers discrimination cases, became law in June 2008. Some news reports said that the new law could affect up to 74,000 black farmers. In October 2008, the GAO issued a report criticizing the USDA&#x27;s handling of discrimination complaints. The GAO recommended an oversight review board to examine civil rights complaints.

After numerous public rallies and an intensive NBFA member lobbying effort, Congress approved and Obama signed into law in December 2010 legislation that set aside $1.15 billion to resolve the outstanding black farmers&#x27; cases. NBFA&#x27;s John W. Boyd Jr., attended the bill-signing ceremony at the White House. As of 2013, 90,000 African-American, Hispanic, female and Native American farmers had filed claims. It was reported that some had been found fraudulent, or transparently bogus. In Maple Hill, North Carolina by 2013, the number of successful claimants was four times the number of farms with 1 out of 9 African-Americans being paid, while &quot;claimants were not required [by the USDA] to present documentary evidence that they had been unfairly treated or had even tried to farm.&quot; Lack of documentation is an issue complicated by the USDA practice of discarding denied applications after three years.

=== Keepseagle v. Vilsack ===
In 1999, Native American farmers, discriminated in a similar fashion to black farmers, filed a class-action lawsuit against the USDA alleging loan discrimination under the ECOA and the APA. This case relied heavily on its predecessor, Pigford v. Glickman, in terms of the reasoning it set forth in the lawsuit. Eventually, a settlement was reached between the plaintiffs and the USDA to the amount of up to $760 million, awardable through individual damages claims. These claims could be used for monetary relief, debt relief, and/or tax relief. The filing period began June 29, 2011 and lasted 180 days. Track A claimants would be eligible for up to $50,000, whereas Track B claimants would be eligible for up to $250,000 with a higher standard of proof.

=== Garcia v. Vilsack ===
In 2000, similar to Pigford v. Glickman, a class-action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on behalf of Hispanic farmers alleging that the USDA discriminated against them in terms of credit transactions and disaster benefits, in direct violation of ECOA. As per the settlement, $1.33 billion is available for compensation in awards of up to $50,000 or $250,000, while an additional $160 million is available in debt relief.

=== &quot;Love v. Vilsack&quot; ===
In 2001, similar to Garcia v. Vilsack, a class-action lawsuit was filed in the same court alleging discrimination on the basis of gender. A Congressional response to the lawsuit resulted in the passing of the Equality for Women Farmers Act, which created a system that would allow for allegations of gender discrimination to be heard against the USDA and enable claims for damages.

== Environmental justice initiatives ==
In their 2012 environmental justice strategy, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) stated an ongoing desire to integrate environmental justice into its core mission and operations. In 2011, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack emphasized the USDA&#x27;s focus on EJ in rural communities around the United States, as well as connecting with Indigenous Tribes and ensuring they understand and receive their environmental rights. USDA does fund programs with social and environmental equity goals; however, it has no staff dedicated solely to EJ.

=== Background ===
On February 16, 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898, &quot;Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations.&quot; Executive Order 12898 requires that achieving EJ must be part of each federal agency&#x27;s mission. Under Executive Order 12898 federal agencies must:

# enforce all health and environmental statutes in areas with minority and low-income populations;
# ensure public participation;
# improve research and data collection relating to the health and environment of minority and low-income populations; and
# identify differential patterns of consumption of natural resources among minority and low-income populations.
The Executive Order also created an Interagency Working Group (IWG) consisting of 11 heads of departments and agencies.

==== 2012 Environmental Justice Strategy ====
On February 7, 2012, the USDA released a final Environmental Justice Strategic Plan identifying new and updated goals and performance measures beyond what USDA identified in a 1995 EJ strategy that was adopted in response to E.O. 12898. Generally, USDA believes its existing technical and financial assistance programs provide solutions to environmental inequity, such as its initiatives on education, food deserts, and economic development in impacted communities.

Natural Resources and Environment Under Secretary Harris Sherman is the political appointee generally responsible for USDA&#x27;s EJ strategy, with Patrick Holmes, a senior staffer to the Under Secretary, playing a coordinating role. USDA has no staff dedicated solely to EJ.

=== EJ Initiatives in Tribal Communities ===

==== Tribal development ====
USDA has had a role in implementing Michelle Obama&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Move&quot; campaign in tribal areas by increasing Bureau of Indian Education schools&#x27; participation in federal nutrition programs, by developing community gardens on tribal lands, and developing tribal food policy councils.

More than $6.2 billion in Rural Development funding has been allocated for community infrastructure in Indian country and is distributed via 47 state offices that altogether cover the entire continental United States, Hawaii, and Alaska. Such funding has been used for a variety of reasons:

===== Rural housing=====

*single-family housing direct loans
*loan guarantees loans for very-low-income homeowners
*financing for affordable rental housing
*financing for farm laborers and their families

===== Community facilities=====

*child and senior care centers
*emergency services
*healthcare institutions
*educational institutions
*tribal administration buildings

===== Business and cooperative programs=====

*increased access to broadband connections
*tribal workplace development and employment opportunities
*sustainable renewable energy development
*regional food systems
*financing and technical assistance for entrepreneurs, including loans and lending
*increased access to capital through Tribal CDFIs

===== Utilities=====

*increased access to 21st century telecommunications services
*reliable and affordable water and wastewater systems
*financing electric systems
*integrating electric smart-grid technologies

==== Tribal relations ====
In 1997, the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) published a resource guide aimed at helping USFS officials with developing and maintaining relations with different tribal governments. To that end, and in coordination with the Forest Service&#x27;s 4*point American Indian/Alaska Native policy, the resource guide discusses how to:

# Maintain a governmental relationship with Federally Recognized tribal governments.
# Implement Forest Service programs and activities honoring Indian treaty rights, and fulfill legally mandated trust responsibilities to the extent that they are determine applicable to National Forest System lands.
# Administer programs and activities to address and be sensitive to traditional Native religious beliefs and practices.
# Provide research, transfer of technology, and technical assistance to Indian governments.
The USFS works to maintain good governmental relationships through regular intergovernmental meetings, acknowledgement of pre*existing tribal sovereignty, and a better general understanding of tribal government, which varies from tribe to tribe. Indian treaty rights and trust responsibilities are honored through visits to tribal neighbors, discussions of mutual interest, and attempts to honor and accommodate the legal positions of Indians and the federal government. Addressing and demonstrating sensitivity to Native religious beliefs and practices includes walking through Native lands and acknowledging cultural needs when implementing USFS activities. Providing research, technology, and assistance to Indian governments is shown through collaboration of ecological studies and sharing of various environmental technologies, as well as the inclusion of traditional Native practices in contemporary operations of the USFS.

The Intertribal Technical Assistance Network works to improve access of tribal governments, communities and individuals to USDA technical assistance programs.

==== Tribal Services/Cooperatives ====
The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service provides APHIS Veterinary Services, which serve the tribal community by promoting and fostering safe animal trade and care. This includes prevention of pests and disease from herd and fisheries as well as surveys for diseases on or near Native American lands that can affect traditionally hunted wildlife. The APHIS also provides Wildlife Services, which help with wildlife damage on Native lands. This includes emergency trainings, outreach, consultation, internship opportunities for students, and general education on damage reduction, livestock protection, and disease monitoring.

Meanwhile, the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) is exploring a program to use meat from bisons raised on tribal land to supply AMS food distribution programs to tribes.

=== Other EJ Initiatives ===

==== Technical and financial assistance ====
The NRCS Strike Force Initiative has identified impoverished counties in Mississippi, Georgia and Arkansas to receive increased outreach and training regarding USDA assistance programs. USDA credits this increased outreach with generating a 196 percent increase in contracts, representing more than 250,000 acres of farmland, in its Environmental Quality Incentives Program. In 2001, NRCS funded and published a study, &quot;Environmental Justice: Perceptions of Issues, Awareness and Assistance,&quot; focused on rural, Southern &quot;Black Belt&quot; counties and analyzing how the NRCS workforce could more effectively integrate environmental justice into impacted communities.

The Farm Services Agency in 2011 devoted $100,000 of its Socially Disadvantaged Farmers and Ranchers program budget to improving its outreach to counties with persistent poverty. USDA&#x27;s Risk Management Agency has initiated education and outreach to low-income farmers regarding use of biological controls, rather than pesticides, for pest control. The Rural Utilities Service administers water and wastewater loans, including SEARCH Grants that are targeted to financially distressed, small rural communities and other opportunities specifically for Alaskan Native villages.

==== Mapping ====
USFS has established several Urban Field Stations, to research urban natural resources&#x27; structure, function, stewardship, and benefits. By mapping urban tree coverage, the agency hopes to identify and prioritize EJ communities for urban forest projects.

Another initiative highlighted by the agency is the Food and Nutrition Service and Economic Research Service&#x27;s Food Desert Locator. The Locator provides a spatial view of food deserts, defined as a low-income census tract where a substantial number or share of residents has low access to a supermarket or large grocery store. The mapped deserts can be used to direct agency resources to increase access to fresh fruits and vegetables and other food assistance programs.

==Meat and poultry hotline==
The USDA Meat and Poultry hotline is a toll-free user assistance hotline for consumers to answer inquiries about the safe storage, handling, and preparation of meat, poultry, and egg products that can be reached at 1-888-MPHotline (1-888-674-6854). The Hotline also responds to other issues related to the mission of USDA&#x27;s Food Safety and Inspection Service(FSIS), which is to ensure that commercial supply of meat, poultry, and egg products is safe, wholesome, and correctly labeled and packaged. The hotline operates year-round on weekdays excluding federal holidays (except Thanksgiving) from 10 AM to 6 PM PT. Food safety specialists with home economics, nutrition, and food technology backgrounds staff it. The hotline began on July 1, 1985, and has answered over 2 million calls to date in 2024. The hotline added Spanish support in 2002 and added two hours in April 2017. The hotline can help detect public health threats and has been attributed with increasing American&#x27;s awareness of foodborne bacteria and how to avoid them.

The USDA also offers online text support via &quot;Ask Karen.&quot;

== Other ==

=== Private sector relationships ===

Part of the USDA&#x27;s functions includes promoting the economic development of the agricultural sector. In their 2022 strategic plan, they pledged:To maintain a competitive agricultural sector, USDA will support farmers and ranchers’ ability to start and maintain profitable businesses as well as offer financial support to producers affected by natural disasters. Furthermore, USDA’s research agencies will continue to introduce high-performance plants, animals, and integrated management options that increase the efficiency of farming practices. Lastly, USDA will also provide tools to producers so that they are well-positioned to secure a share of a growing market for agricultural products.The USDA formalized a relationship with the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) in 2018. GFSI is a private organization where members of the Consumer Goods Forum have control over benchmarking requirements in recognition of private standards for food safety. In August 2018, USDA achieved Technical Equivalence against Version 7.1 of the GFSI Benchmarking Requirements for their Harmonized GAP Plus + certification programme, where Technical Equivalence is limited to government-owned food safety certification programmes. This is misaligned with U.S. Government Policy and OMB Circular No. A-119 which instructs its agencies to adopt voluntary consensus standards before relying upon industry standards (private standards) or developing government standards.

Harmonized GAP Plus+ Standard (V. 3.0) was published in February 2021 with reference to GFSI Guidance Document Version 2020, Part III, ignoring reference to international standards and technical specifications ISO 22000 and ISO T/S 22002-3 Prerequisite Programmes for Farming. The USDA exception to OMB Circular No. A-119 might be attributed to lobbying and influence of Consumer Goods Forum members in Washington, D.C. In November 2021, GFSI announced its Technical Equivalence was under strategic review explaining the assessment has raised concerns across many stakeholders.

==== Dairy ====

The USDA monitors American dairy production and markets, for which it has a Dairy Board and a marketing branch known as Dairy Management Incorporated (DMI). Furthermore, the USDA collaborates with United Dairy Industry Association (UDIA), the National Fluid Milk Processor Promotion Board for market information on the industry.

=== COVID-19 relief ===
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress allocated funding to the USDA to address the disturbances rippling through the agricultural sector. On April 17, 2020, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue announced the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program:

This provided $16 billion for farmers and ranchers, and $3 billion to purchase surplus produce, dairy, and meat from farmers for distribution to charitable organizations. As part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES) and the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA), USDA has up to an additional $873.3 million available in Section 32 funding to purchase a variety of agricultural products for distribution to food banks, $850 million for food bank administrative costs and USDA food purchases.

<text>The United States Department of the Interior (DOI) is an executive department of the U.S. federal government responsible for the management and conservation of most federal lands and natural resources. It also administers programs relating to Native Americans, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, territorial affairs, and insular areas of the United States, as well as programs related to historic preservation. About 75% of federal public land is managed by the department, with most of the remainder managed by the Department of Agriculture&#x27;s Forest Service. The department was created on March 3, 1849. It is headquartered at the Main Interior Building, located at 1849 C Street NW in Washington, D.C.

The department is headed by the secretary of the interior, who reports directly to the president of the United States and is a member of the president&#x27;s Cabinet. The current interior secretary is Doug Burgum, who was sworn in on February 1, 2025.

As of mid-2004, the department managed 507 million acres (2,050,000 km2) of surface land, or about one-fifth of the land in the United States. It manages 476 dams and 348 reservoirs through the Bureau of Reclamation, national parks, monuments, historical sites, etc. through the National Park Service, and 544 national wildlife refuges through the Fish and Wildlife Service. The largest land management agency is the Bureau of Land Management, managing about one-eighth of the land in the United States.

Despite its name, the Department of the Interior has a different role from that of the interior ministries of other nations, which are usually responsible for police matters and internal security. In the United States, national security and immigration functions are performed by the Department of Homeland Security primarily and the Department of Justice secondarily. The Department of the Interior has often been humorously called &quot;the Department of Everything Else&quot; because of its broad range of responsibilities.

==History==
===Formation of the department===
A department for domestic concern was first considered by the 1st United States Congress in 1789, but those duties were placed in the Department of State. The idea of a separate domestic department continued to percolate for a half-century and was supported by presidents from James Madison to James Polk. The 1846–48 Mexican–American War gave the proposal new steam as the responsibilities of the federal government grew. Polk&#x27;s secretary of the treasury, Robert J. Walker, became a vocal champion of creating the new department.

In 1849, Walker stated in his annual report that several federal offices were placed in departments with which they had little to do. He noted that the United States General Land Office had little to do with the Treasury and also highlighted the Indian Affairs office, part of the Department of War, and the Patent Office, part of the Department of State. Walker argued that these and other bureaus should be brought together in a new Department of the Interior. A bill authorizing its creation of the department passed the House of Representatives on February 15, 1849, and spent just over two weeks in the Senate. The department was established on March 3, 1849 (), the eve of President Zachary Taylor&#x27;s inauguration, when the Senate voted 31 to 25 to create the department. Its passage was delayed by Democrats in Congress who were reluctant to create more patronage posts for the incoming Whig administration to fill. The first secretary of the interior was Thomas Ewing.

Several of the domestic concerns the department originally dealt with were gradually transferred to other departments. For example, the Department of Interior was responsible for water pollution control prior to the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency. Other agencies became separate departments, such as the Bureau of Agriculture, which later became the Department of Agriculture. However, land and natural resource management, American Indian affairs, wildlife conservation, and territorial affairs remain the responsibilities of the Department of the Interior.

=== Controversies ===
Secretary of the Interior Albert B. Fall was implicated in the Teapot Dome scandal of 1921. He was convicted of bribery in 1929, and served one year in prison, for his part in the controversy. A major factor in the scandal was a transfer of certain oil leases from the jurisdiction of the Department of the Navy to that of the Department of the Interior, at Fall&#x27;s behest.

Secretary of the Interior James G. Watt faced criticism for his alleged hostility to environmentalism, for his support of the development and use of federal lands by foresting, ranching, and other commercial interests, and for banning the Beach Boys from playing a 1983 Independence Day concert on the National Mall out of concerns of attracting &quot;an undesirable element&quot;. His 1983 resignation was prompted by a speech in which he said about his staff: &quot;I have a black, a woman, two Jews and a cripple. And we have talent.&quot;

Under the Administration of President George W. Bush, the Interior Department&#x27;s maintenance backlog climbed from $5 billion to $8.7 billion, despite Bush&#x27;s campaign pledges to eliminate it completely. Of the agency under Bush&#x27;s leadership, Interior Department Inspector General Earl Devaney has cited a &quot;culture of fear&quot; and of &quot;ethical failure.&quot; Devaney has also said, &quot;Simply stated, short of a crime, anything goes at the highest levels of the Department of Interior.&quot;

Launched in June of 2021, the Federal Indian Boarding School Initiative intended to investigate federal Indian boarding school policies and multi-generational impacts of trauma on American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian children. Released in two volumes, the three year investigation produced the first report in May 2022 and the second and final volume in June 2024. The final report details the severe trauma and cultural disruption inflicted on Native American communities through these schools, which operated from the late 19th century to the mid-20th century. It highlights the systemic abuse and neglect endured by students, finding 973 children died at the schools and calls for accountability and measures to address the ongoing impact on Native American families and communities to include working closely with tribal nations on the identification and repatriation of the remains.

==American Indians==
Within the Interior Department, the Bureau of Indian Affairs handles some federal relations with American Indians, while others are handled by the Office of Special Trustee. The current acting assistant secretary for Indian affairs is Bryan Newland, an enrolled member of the Bay Mills Indian Community.

The department has been the subject of disputes over proper accounting for American Indian Trusts set up to track the income and distribution of monies that are generated by the trust and specific American Indian lands, which the government leases for fees to companies that extract oil, timber, minerals, and other resources. Several cases have sought an accounting of such funds from departments within the Interior and Treasury (such as the Minerals Management Service), in what has been a 15-year-old lawsuit. Some American Indian nations have also sued the government over water-rights issues and their treaties with the US. In 2010 Congress passed the Claims Settlement Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-291), which provided $3.4 billion for the settlement of the &quot;Cobell v. Salazar&quot; class-action trust case and four American Indian water rights cases.

On March 16, 2021, Deb Haaland, serving at that time as a member of Congress for New Mexico, took the oath of office as secretary, becoming the first American Indian to lead an executive department, and the third woman to lead the department.

<text>An audio tape recorder, also known as a tape deck, tape player or tape machine or simply a tape recorder, is a sound recording and reproduction device that records and plays back sounds usually using magnetic tape for storage. In its present-day form, it records a fluctuating signal by moving the tape across a tape head that polarizes the magnetic domains in the tape in proportion to the audio signal. Tape-recording devices include the reel-to-reel tape deck and the cassette deck, which uses a cassette for storage.

The use of magnetic tape for sound recording originated around 1930 in Germany as paper tape with oxide lacquered to it. Prior to the development of magnetic tape, magnetic wire recorders had successfully demonstrated the concept of magnetic recording, but they never offered audio quality comparable to the other recording and broadcast standards of the time. This German invention was the start of a long string of innovations that have led to present-day magnetic tape recordings.

Magnetic tape revolutionized both the radio broadcast and music recording industries. It gave artists and producers the power to record and re-record audio with minimal loss in quality as well as edit and rearrange recordings with ease. The alternative recording technologies of the era, transcription discs and wire recorders, could not provide anywhere near this level of quality and functionality.

Since some early refinements improved the fidelity of the reproduced sound, magnetic tape has been the highest quality analog recording medium available. As of the first decade of the 21st century, analog magnetic tape has been largely replaced by digital recording technologies.

==History==

=== Wax strip recorder ===
The earliest known audio tape recorder was a non-magnetic, non-electric version invented by Alexander Graham Bell&#x27;s Volta Laboratory and patented in 1886 (). It employed a strip of wax-covered paper that was coated by dipping it in a solution of beeswax and paraffin and then had one side scraped clean, with the other side allowed to harden. The machine was of sturdy wood and metal construction and hand-powered by means of a knob fastened to a flywheel. The wax strip passed from one eight-inch reel around the periphery of a pulley (with guide flanges) mounted above the V-pulleys on the main vertical shaft, where it came in contact with either its recording or playback stylus. The tape was then taken up on the other reel. The sharp recording stylus, actuated by a vibrating mica diaphragm, cut the wax from the strip. In playback mode, a dull, loosely mounted stylus, attached to a rubber diaphragm, carried the reproduced sounds through an ear tube to its listener. Both recording and playback styluses, mounted alternately on the same two posts, could be adjusted vertically so that several recordings could be cut on the same strip.

While the machine was never developed commercially, it somewhat resembled the modern magnetic tape recorder in its design. The tapes and machine created by Bell&#x27;s associates, examined at one of the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s museums, became brittle, and the heavy paper reels warped. The machine&#x27;s playback head was also missing. Otherwise, with some reconditioning, they could be placed into working condition.

The waxed tape recording medium was later refined by Edison&#x27;s wax cylinder, and became the first widespread sound recording technology, used for both entertainment and office dictation. However, recordings on wax cylinders were unable to be easily duplicated, making them both costly and time consuming for large-scale production. Wax cylinders were also unable to record more than 2 minutes of audio, a problem solved by gramophone discs.

=== Celluloid strip recorder ===

Franklin C. Goodale adapted movie film for analog audio recording. He received a patent for his invention in 1909. The celluloid film was inscribed and played back with a stylus, in a manner similar to the wax cylinders of Edison&#x27;s gramophone. The patent description states that the machine could store six records on the same strip of film, side by side, and it was possible to switch between them. In 1912, a similar process was used for the Hiller talking clock.

=== Photoelectric paper tape recorder ===
In 1932, after six years of developmental work, including a patent application in 1931, Merle Duston, a Detroit radio engineer, created a tape recorder capable of recording both sounds and voice that used a low-cost chemically treated paper tape. During the recording process, the tape moved through a pair of electrodes which immediately imprinted the modulated sound signals as visible black stripes into the paper tape&#x27;s surface. The audio signal could be immediately replayed from the same recorder unit, which also contained photoelectric sensors, somewhat similar to the various sound-on-film technologies of the era.

=== Magnetic recording ===
Magnetic recording was conceived as early as 1878 by the American engineer Oberlin Smith and demonstrated in practice in 1898 by Danish engineer Valdemar Poulsen. Analog magnetic wire recording, and its successor, magnetic tape recording, involve the use of a magnetizable medium which moves with a constant speed past a recording head. An electrical signal, which is analogous to the sound that is to be recorded, is fed to the recording head, inducing a pattern of magnetization similar to the signal. A playback head can then pick up the changes in magnetic field from the tape and convert it into an electrical signal to be amplified and played back through a loudspeaker.

=== Wire recorders ===
The first wire recorder was the Telegraphone invented by Valdemar Poulsen in the late 1890s. Wire recorders for law and office dictation and telephone recording were made almost continuously by various companies (mainly the American Telegraphone Company) through the 1920s and 1930s. These devices were mostly sold as consumer technologies after World War II.

Widespread use of wire recording occurred within the decades spanning from 1940 until 1960, following the development of inexpensive designs licensed internationally by the Brush Development Company of Cleveland, Ohio and the Armour Research Foundation of the Armour Institute of Technology (later Illinois Institute of Technology). These two organizations licensed dozens of manufacturers in the U.S., Japan, and Europe. Wire was also used as a recording medium in black box voice recorders for aviation in the 1950s.

Consumer wire recorders were marketed for home entertainment or as an inexpensive substitute for commercial office dictation recorders, but the development of consumer magnetic tape recorders starting in 1946, with the BK 401 Soundmirror, using paper-based tape, gradually drove wire recorders from the market, being &quot;pretty much out of the picture&quot; by 1952.

=== Early steel tape recorders ===

In 1924 a German engineer, Kurt Stille, developed the Poulsen wire recorder as a dictating machine. The following year a fellow German, Louis Blattner, working in Britain, licensed Stille&#x27;s device and started work on a machine which would instead record on a magnetic steel tape, which he called the Blattnerphone. The tape was 6 mm wide and 0.08 mm thick, traveling at 5 feet per second; the recording time was 20 minutes.

The BBC installed a Blattnerphone at Avenue House in September 1930 for tests, and used it to record King George V&#x27;s speech at the opening of the India Round Table Conference on 12 November 1930. Though not considered suitable for music the machine continued in use and was moved to Broadcasting House in March 1932, a second machine also being installed. In September 1932, a new model was installed, using 3 mm tape with a recording time of 32 minutes.

In 1933, the Marconi Company purchased the rights to the Blattnerphone, and newly developed Marconi-Stille recorders were installed in the BBC&#x27;s Maida Vale Studios in March 1935. The quality and reliability were slightly improved, though it still tended to be obvious that one was listening to a recording. A reservoir system containing a loop of tape helped to stabilize the speed. The tape was 3 mm wide and traveled at 1.5  meters/second.

They were not easy to handle. The reels were heavy and expensive and the steel tape has been described as being like a traveling razor blade. The tape was liable to snap, particularly at joints, which at 1.5  meters/second could rapidly cover the floor with loops of the sharp-edged tape. Rewinding was done at twice the speed of the recording.

Despite these drawbacks, the ability to make replayable recordings proved useful, and even with subsequent methods coming into use (direct-cut discs and Philips-Miller optical film the Marconi-Stilles remained in use until the late 1940s.
=== Modern tape recorders ===

Magnetic tape recording as we know it today was developed in Germany during the 1930s at BASF (then part of the chemical giant IG Farben) and AEG in cooperation with the state radio RRG. This was based on Fritz Pfleumer&#x27;s 1928 invention of paper tape with oxide powder lacquered onto it. The first practical tape recorder from AEG was the Magnetophon K1, demonstrated in Berlin, Germany in 1935. of AEG built the recorders and developed a ring-shaped recording and playback head. It replaced the needle-shaped head which tended to shred the tape. Friedrich Matthias of IG Farben/BASF developed the recording tape, including the oxide, the binder, and the backing material. Walter Weber, working for at the RRG, discovered the AC biasing technique, which radically improved sound quality.

During World War II, the Allies noticed that certain German officials were making radio broadcasts from multiple time zones almost simultaneously. Analysts such as Richard H. Ranger believed that the broadcasts had to be transcriptions, but their audio quality was indistinguishable from that of a live broadcast and their duration was far longer than was possible even with 16 rpm transcription discs. In the final stages of the war in Europe, the Allies&#x27; capture of a number of German Magnetophon recorders from Radio Luxembourg aroused great interest. These recorders incorporated all the key technological features of modern analog magnetic recording and were the basis for future developments in the field.

== Commercialization ==
=== American developments ===
Development of magnetic tape recorders in the late 1940s and early 1950s is associated with the Brush Development Company and its licensee, Ampex. The equally important development of the magnetic tape medium itself was led by Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing (3M) corporation.
In 1938, S.J. Begun left Germany and joined the Brush Development Company in the United States, where work continued but attracted little attention until the late 1940s when the company released the very first consumer tape recorder in 1946: the Soundmirror BK 401. Several other models were quickly released in the following years. Tapes were initially made of paper coated with magnetite powder. In 1947/48 Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Company (3M) replaced the paper backing with cellulose acetate or polyester, and coated it first with black oxide, and later, to improve signal-to-noise ratio and improve overall superior quality, with red oxide (gamma ferric oxide).

American audio engineer John T. Mullin and entertainer Bing Crosby were key players in the commercial development of magnetic tape. Mullin served in the U.S. Army Signal Corps and was posted to Paris in the final months of WWII. His unit was assigned to find out everything they could about German radio and electronics, including the investigation of claims that the Germans had been experimenting with high-energy directed radio beams as a means of disabling the electrical systems of aircraft. Mullin&#x27;s unit soon amassed a collection of hundreds of low-quality magnetic dictating machines, but it was a chance visit to a studio at Bad Nauheim near Frankfurt while investigating radio beam rumors, that yielded the real prize.

Mullin was given two suitcase-sized AEG &#x27;Magnetophon&#x27; high-fidelity recorders and fifty reels of recording tape. He had them shipped home and over the next two years he worked on the machines constantly, modifying them and improving their performance. His major aim was to interest Hollywood studios in using magnetic tape for movie soundtrack recording.

Mullin gave two public demonstrations of his machines, and they caused a sensation among American audio professionals; many listeners literally could not believe that what they heard was not a live performance. By luck, Mullin&#x27;s second demonstration was held at MGM Studios in Hollywood and in the audience that day was Bing Crosby&#x27;s technical director, Murdo Mackenzie. He arranged for Mullin to meet Crosby and in June 1947 he gave Crosby a private demonstration of his magnetic tape recorders.

Bing Crosby, a top movie and singing star, was stunned by the amazing sound quality and instantly saw the huge commercial potential of the new machines. Live music was the standard for American radio at the time and the major radio networks didn&#x27;t permit the use of disc recording in many programs because of their comparatively poor sound quality. Crosby disliked the regimentation of live broadcasts 39 weeks a year, preferring the recording studio&#x27;s relaxed atmosphere and ability to retain the best parts of a performance. He asked NBC to let him pre-record his 1944–45 series on transcription discs, but the network refused, so Crosby withdrew from live radio for a year. ABC agreed to let him use transcription discs for the 1946–47 season, but listeners complained about the sound quality.

Crosby realised that Mullin&#x27;s tape recorder technology would enable him to pre-record his radio show with high sound quality and that these tapes could be replayed many times with no appreciable loss of quality. Mullin was asked to tape one show as a test and was subsequently hired as Crosby&#x27;s chief engineer to pre-record the rest of the series.

Crosby&#x27;s season premier on 1 October 1947 was the first magnetic tape broadcast in America. He became the first major American music star to use tape to pre-record radio broadcasts, and the first to master commercial recordings on tape. The taped Crosby radio shows were painstakingly edited through tape-splicing to give them a pace and flow that was wholly unprecedented in radio. Soon other radio performers were demanding the ability to pre-record their broadcasts with the high quality of tape, and the recording ban was lifted.

Crosby invested $50,000 of his own money into the Californian electronics company Ampex, and the six-man concern (headed by Alexander M. Poniatoff, whose initials became part of the company name) soon became the world leader in the development of tape recording, with its Model 200 tape deck, released in 1948 and developed from Mullin&#x27;s modified Magnetophons.

===Tape recording at the BBC===
The BBC acquired some Magnetophon machines in 1946 on an experimental basis, and they were used in the early stages of the new Third Programme to record and play back performances of operas from Germany. Delivery of tape was preferred as live relays over landlines were unreliable in the immediate post-war period. These machines were used until 1952, though most of the work continued to be done using the established media.

In 1948, a new British model became available from EMI: the BTR1. Though in many ways clumsy, its quality was good, and as it wasn&#x27;t possible to obtain any more Magnetophons it was an obvious choice.

In the early 1950s, the EMI BTR 2 became available; a much-improved machine and generally liked. The machines were responsive, could run up to speed quite quickly, had light-touch operating buttons, forward-facing heads (The BTR 1s had rear-facing heads which made editing difficult), and were quick and easy to do fine editing. It became the standard in recording rooms for many years and was in use until the end of the 1960s.

In 1963, the Beatles were allowed to enhance their recordings at the BBC by overdubbing. The BBC didn&#x27;t have any multi-track equipment; Overdubbing was accomplished by copying onto another tape.

The tape speed was eventually standardized at 15 ips for almost all work at Broadcasting House, and at 15 ips for music and 7½ ips for speech at Bush House.

Broadcasting House also used the EMI TR90 and a Philips machine which was lightweight but very easy and quick to use. Bush House used several Leevers-Rich models.

The Studer range of machines had become the studio recording industry standard by the 1970s, gradually replacing the aging BTR2s in recording rooms and studios. By the mid-2000s tape was pretty well out of use and had been replaced by digital playout systems.

=== Standardized products ===
The typical professional audio tape recorder of the early 1950s used wide tape on reels, with a capacity of . Typical speeds were initially yielding 30 minutes&#x27; recording time on a reel. Early professional machines used single-sided reels but double-sided reels soon became popular, particularly for domestic use. Tape reels were made from metal or transparent plastic.

Standard tape speeds varied by factors of two: 15 and were used for professional audio recording; for home audiophile prerecorded tapes; for audiophile and consumer recordings (typically on reels). and occasionally even were used for voice, dictation, and applications where very long recording times were needed, such as logging police and fire department calls.

The 8-track tape standard, developed by Bill Lear in the mid-1960s, popularized consumer audio playback in automobiles in the USA. Eventually, this standard was replaced by the smaller and more reliable Compact Cassette, which was launched earlier in 1963.
Philips&#x27;s development of the Compact Cassette in 1963 and Sony&#x27;s development of the Walkman in 1979 led to widespread consumer use of magnetic audio tape. In 1990, the Compact Cassette was the dominant format in mass-market recorded music. The development of Dolby noise reduction technology in the 1960s brought audiophile-quality recording to the Compact Cassette also contributing to its popularity.

== Later developments ==
Since their first introduction, analog tape recorders have experienced a long series of progressive developments resulting in increased sound quality, convenience, and versatility.

* Two-track and, later, multi-track heads permitted discrete recording and playback of individual sound sources, such as two channels for stereophonic sound, or different microphones during live recording. The more versatile machines could be switched to record on some tracks while playing back others, permitting additional tracks to be recorded in synchronization with previously recorded material such as a rhythm track.
* Use of separate heads for recording and playback (three heads total, counting the erase head) enabled monitoring of the recorded signal a fraction of a second after recording. Mixing the playback signal back into the record input also created a primitive echo generator. The use of separate record and play heads allowed each head to be optimized for its purpose rather than the compromise design required for a combined record/play head. The result was an improved signal-to-noise plus an extended frequency response.
* Dynamic range compression during recording and expansion during playback expanded the available dynamic range and improved the signal-to-noise ratio. dbx and Dolby Laboratories introduced add-on products in this area, originally for studio use, and later in versions for the consumer market. In particular, Dolby B noise reduction became very common in all but the least expensive cassette tape recorders.

* Computer-controlled analog tape recorders were introduced by Oscar Bonello in Argentina. The mechanical transport used three DC motors and introduced two new advances: automated microprocessor transport control and automatic adjustment of bias and frequency response. In 30 seconds the recorder adjusted its bias for minimum THD and best frequency response to match the brand and batch of magnetic tape used. The microprocessor control of transport allowed fast location to any point on the tape.

==Operation==
=== Electrical ===
Due to electromagnetism, electric current flowing in the coils of the tape head creates a fluctuating magnetic field. This causes the magnetic material on the tape, which is moving past and in contact with the head, to align in a manner proportional to the original signal. The signal can be reproduced by running the tape back across the tape head, where the reverse process occurs – the magnetic imprint on the tape induces a small current in the read head which approximates the original signal and is then amplified for playback. Many tape recorders are capable of recording and playing back simultaneously by means of separate record and playback heads.

=== Mechanical ===
Modern professional recorders usually use a three-motor scheme. One motor with a constant rotational speed drives the capstan. Usually combined with a rubber pinch roller, it ensures that the tape speed does not fluctuate. The other two motors, which are called torque motors, apply equal and opposite torques to the supply and take-up reels during recording and playback functions and maintain the tape&#x27;s tension. During fast winding operations, the pinch roller is disengaged and the take-up reel motor produces more torque than the supply motor. The cheapest models use a single motor for all required functions; the motor drives the capstan directly and the supply and take-up reels are loosely coupled to the capstan motor with slipping belts, gears, or clutches. There are also variants with two motors, one motor being used for the capstan and one for driving the reels for playback, rewind, and fast forward.

== Limitations ==
The storage of an analog signal on tape works well but is not perfect. In particular, the granular nature of the magnetic material adds high-frequency noise to the signal, generally referred to as tape hiss. Also, the magnetic characteristics of tape are not linear. They exhibit a characteristic hysteresis curve, which causes unwanted distortion of the signal. Some of this distortion is overcome by using inaudible high-frequency AC bias when recording. The amount of bias needs careful adjustment for best results as different tape material requires differing amounts of bias. Most recorders have a switch to select this. Additionally, systems such as Dolby noise reduction systems have been devised to ameliorate some noise and distortion problems.

Variations in tape speed cause wow and flutter. Flutter can be reduced by using dual capstans. The higher the flutter the more noise that can be heard causing the quality of the recording to be worse. Higher tape speeds used in professional recorders are prone to cause &quot;head bumps&quot;, which are fluctuations in low-frequency response.

== Tape recorder variety ==

There is a wide variety of tape recorders in existence, from small hand-held devices to large multitrack machines. A machine with built-in speakers and audio power amplification to drive them is usually called a &quot;tape recorder&quot; or – if it has no record functionality – a &quot;tape player&quot;, while one that requires external amplification for playback is usually called a &quot;tape deck&quot; (regardless of whether it can record).

Multitrack technology enabled the development of modern art music and one such artist, Brian Eno, described the tape recorder as &quot;an automatic musical collage device.&quot;

== Uses ==
Magnetic tape brought about sweeping changes in both radio and the recording industry. Sound could be recorded, erased and re-recorded on the same tape many times, sounds could be duplicated from tape to tape with only minor loss of quality, and recordings could now be very precisely edited by physically cutting the tape and rejoining it. In August 1948, Los Angeles-based Capitol Records became the first recording company to use the new process.

Within a few years of the introduction of the first commercial tape recorder, the Ampex 200 model, launched in 1948, the invention of the first multitrack tape recorder, brought about another technical revolution in the recording industry. Tape made possible the first sound recordings totally created by electronic means, opening the way for the bold sonic experiments of the Musique Concrète school and avant-garde composers like Karlheinz Stockhausen, which in turn led to the innovative pop music studio-as-an-instrument recordings of artists such as Frank Zappa, the Beatles, and the Beach Boys. Philips advertised their reel-to-reel recorders as an audial family album and pushed families to purchase these recorders to capture and relive memories forever. But the use for recording music slowly but steadily rose as the main function for the tape recorder.

Tape enabled the radio industry for the first time to pre-record many sections of program content such as advertising, which formerly had to be presented live, and it also enabled the creation and duplication of complex, high-fidelity, long-duration recordings of entire programs. It also, for the first time, allowed broadcasters, regulators and other interested parties to undertake comprehensive logging of radio broadcasts for legislative and commercial purposes, leading to the growth of the modern media monitoring industry.

Innovations, like multitrack recording and tape echo, enabled radio programs and advertisements to be pre-produced to a level of complexity and sophistication that was previously unattainable and tape also led to significant changes to the pacing of program content, thanks to the introduction of the endless tape cartridge.

While they are primarily used for sound recording, tape machines were also important for data storage before the advent of floppy disks and CDs, and are still used today, although primarily to provide backup.

== Tape speeds ==
Professional decks will use higher tape speeds, with 15 and 30 inches per second being most common, while lower tape speeds are usually used for smaller recorders and cassette players, in order to save space where fidelity is not as critical as in professional recorders. By providing a range of tape speeds, users can trade-off recording time against recording quality with higher tape speeds providing greater frequency response.

There are many tape speeds in use in all sorts of tape recorders. Speed may be expressed in centimeters per second (cm/s) or in inches per second (in/s).

<text>The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is one of the executive departments of the U.S. federal government. It administers federal housing and urban development laws. It is headed by the secretary of housing and urban development, who reports directly to the president of the United States and is a member of the president&#x27;s Cabinet.

Although its beginnings were in the House and Home Financing Agency, it was founded as a Cabinet department in 1965, as part of the &quot;Great Society&quot; program of President Lyndon B. Johnson, to develop and execute policies on housing and metropolises.

==History==
The idea of a department of Urban Affairs was proposed in a 1957 report to President Dwight D. Eisenhower, led by New York governor Nelson A. Rockefeller. The idea of a department of Housing and Urban Affairs was taken up by President John F. Kennedy, with Pennsylvania Senator and Kennedy ally Joseph S. Clark Jr. listing it as one of the top seven legislative priorities for the administration in internal documents.

The department was established on September 9, 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act into law. It stipulated that the department was to be created no later than November 8, sixty days following the date of enactment. The actual implementation was postponed until January 14, 1966, following the completion of a special study group report on the federal role in solving urban problems.

HUD is administered by the U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Its headquarters is located in the Robert C. Weaver Federal Building. Some important milestones for HUD&#x27;s development include:

The United States Congress enacted the Inspector General Act of 1978 to ensure integrity and efficiency in government. The Inspector General is appointed by the President and subject to Senate confirmation. He or she is responsible for conducting and supervising audits, investigations, and inspections relating to the programs and operations of HUD. The OIG is to examine, evaluate and, where necessary, critique these operations and activities, recommending ways for the department to carry out its responsibilities in the most effective, efficient, and economical manner possible.

The mission of the Office of Inspector General (OIG) is to:
* Promote the integrity, efficiency, and effectiveness of HUD programs and operations to assist the department in meeting its mission
* Detect and prevent waste, fraud, and abuse
* Seek administrative sanctions, civil recoveries, and/or criminal prosecution of those responsible for waste, fraud and abuse in HUD programs and operations

The OIG accomplishes its mission by conducting investigations pertinent to its activities; by keeping Congress, the Secretary, and the public fully informed of its activities, and by working with staff (in this case of HUD) in achieving success of its objectives and goals.
The Honorable Rae Oliver Davis, who was appointed on January 23, 2019, is the current Inspector General.

===Budget and staffing===
The Department of Housing and Urban Development was authorized a budget for Fiscal Year 2015 of $48.3 billion. The budget authorization is broken down as outlined in the following chart.

==Criticisms==
A scandal arose in the 1990s when at least 700 houses were sold for profit by real estate speculators taking the loans; at least 19 were arrested. The scandal devastated the Brooklyn and Harlem housing market, with $70 million in HUD loans going into default. Critics said that the department&#x27;s lax oversight of their program allowed the fraud to occur. In 1997, the HUD Inspector General issued a report saying: &quot;The program design encourages risky property deals, land sale, and refinance schemes, overstated property appraisals, and phony or excessive fees.&quot;
In June 1993, HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros admitted that &quot;HUD has in many cases exacerbated the declining quality of life in America.&quot; In 1996, Vice President Al Gore, referring to public housing projects, declared that, &quot;These crime-infested monuments to a failed policy are killing the neighborhoods around them&quot;.

HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing Roberta Achtenberg has been quoted as saying &quot;HUD walks a tightrope between free speech and fair housing. We are ever mindful of the need to maintain the proper balance between these rights.&quot; Libertarian critic James Bovard commented that, &quot;The more aggressive HUD becomes, the fewer free speech rights Americans have. Many words and phrases are now effectively forbidden in real estate ads... Apparently, there are two separate versions of the Bill of Rights -- one for private citizens and the other for federal bureaucrats and politicians&quot;.

In 2006, &quot;The Village Voice&quot; named HUD &quot;New York City&#x27;s worst landlord&quot; and &quot;the #1 worst in the United States&quot; based upon decrepit conditions of buildings and questionable eviction practices.

In September 2010, HUD started auctioning off delinquent home mortgage loans, defined as at least 90 days past due, to the highest bidder. It sold 2,000 loans in six national auctions. In 2012, this sale was massively increased under a &quot;Distressed Asset Stabilization Program&quot; (DASP), and the 100,000 loans sold as of 2014 have netted $8.8 billion for the FHA, rebuilding cash reserves that had been depleted by loan defaults. The second stated and eponymous objective is to stabilize communities, by requiring purchasers to service the loans in a manner that stabilizes the surrounding communities by getting the loans to re-perform, renting the home to the borrower, gifting the property to a land bank or paying off the loans in full. An audit published August 2014 found &quot;only about 11 percent of the loans sold through DASP [were] considered &#x27;re-performing&#x27;&quot;. &quot;Rather than defaulting—[FHA] keeps many of the properties they’re tied to from going through the typical foreclosure process. As a result, the FHA might actually be diverting housing stock from first-time homebuyers, the very group it was formed to serve...&quot;

<text>The United States Department of Education is a cabinet-level department of the United States government. It began operating on May 4, 1980, having been created after the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare was split into the Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services by the Department of Education Organization Act, which President Jimmy Carter signed into law on October 17, 1979.

The Department of Education is administered by the United States secretary of education. It has 4,400 employees – the smallest staff of the Cabinet agencies – and a 2024 budget of $238 billion, up from $14 billion when it was established in 1979. The 2023 budget was $274 billion, which included funding for children with disabilities (IDEA), pandemic recovery, early childhood education, Pell Grants, Title I, work assistance, among other programs. This budget was down from $637.7 billion in 2022. Its official abbreviation is ED (&quot;DOE&quot; refers to the United States Department of Energy) but is also abbreviated informally as &quot;DoEd&quot;.

In February 2025, it was implied that President Donald Trump would prepare an executive order to effectively abolish or curtail the department. Elon Musk, the head of the department of government efficiency, DOGE, has publicly stated that the department no longer &quot;exists&quot;.

Unlike the systems of many other countries, education in the United States is organized at a subnational level by each of the fifty states. Under the 10th Amendment, the federal government and Department of Education should not be involved in determining curricula or educational standards or establishing schools or colleges. The Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) oversees schools located on American military bases and the Department of the Interior&#x27;s Bureau of Indian Education supports tribally controlled schools. The quality of higher education institutions and their degrees are maintained through an informal private process known as accreditation, over which the Department of Education has no direct public jurisdictional control.

The department identifies four key functions:

* Establishing policies on federal financial aid for education and distributing as well as monitoring those funds.
* Collecting data on America&#x27;s schools and disseminating research.
* Focusing national attention on key issues in education, and makes recommendations for education reform.
* Prohibiting discrimination and ensuring equal access to education.

The Department of Education is a member of the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness and works with federal partners to ensure proper education for homeless and runaway youth in the United States.

==Organization==

==Budget==
For 2006, the ED discretionary budget was $56 billion and the mandatory budget contained $23 billion. In 2009 it received additional ARRA funding of $102 billion. In 2011, the discretionary budget was $70 billion.

== History ==
===Early history===
The department&#x27;s origin goes back to 1867, when President Andrew Johnson signed legislation for a Department of Education. It was seen as a way to collect information and statistics about the nation&#x27;s schools and provide advice to schools in the same way the Department of Agriculture helped farmers. The department was originally proposed by Henry Barnard and leaders of the National Teachers Association, renamed the National Education Association. Barnard served as the first commissioner of education. He resigned when the office was reconfigured as a bureau in the Department of Interior, known as the United States Office of Education due to concerns it would have too much control over local schools.

Over the years, the office remained relatively small, operating under different titles and housed in various agencies, including the United States Department of the Interior and the former United States Department of Health Education and Welfare (DHEW), now the United States Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). In 1920, an unsuccessful attempt at creating a Department of Education, headed by a secretary of education, came with the Smith–Towner Bill.

In 1939, the organization, then a bureau, was transferred to the Federal Security Agency, where it was renamed as the Office of Education. After World War II, President Dwight D. Eisenhower promulgated &quot;Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1953.&quot; The Federal Security Agency was abolished and most of its functions were transferred to the newly formed DHEW.

=== Promotion to department ===
In 1979, President Carter advocated for creating a cabinet-level Department of Education. Carter&#x27;s plan was to transfer most of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare&#x27;s education-related functions to the Department of Education. Carter also planned to transfer the education-related functions of the departments of Defense, Justice, Housing and Urban Development, and Agriculture, as well as a few other federal entities. Among the federal education-related programs that were not proposed to be transferred were Headstart, the Department of Agriculture&#x27;s school lunch and nutrition programs, the Department of the Interior&#x27;s Native Americans&#x27; education programs, and the Department of Labor&#x27;s education and training programs.

Upgrading Education to cabinet-level status in 1979 was opposed by many in the Republican Party, who saw the department as unconstitutional, arguing that the Constitution does not mention &quot;education&quot;, and deemed it an unnecessary and illegal federal bureaucratic intrusion into local affairs. However, many see the department as constitutional under the Commerce Clause, and that the funding role of the department is constitutional under the Taxing and Spending Clause. The National Education Association supported the bill, while the American Federation of Teachers opposed it.

In 1979, the Office of Education had 3,000 employees and an annual budget of $12 billion. Congress appropriated to the Department of Education an annual budget of $14 billion and 17,000 employees when establishing the Department of Education. During the 1980 presidential campaign, Gov. Reagan called for the total elimination of the U.S. Department of Education, severe curtailment of bilingual education, and massive cutbacks in the federal role in education. Once in office, President Reagan significantly reduced its budget, but in 1988, perhaps to reduce conflict with Congress, he decided to change his mind and ask for an increase from $18.4 billion to $20.3 billion.

===Late 20th century===
The 1980 Republican Party platform called for the elimination of the Department of Education created under Carter, and President Ronald Reagan promised during the 1980 presidential election to eliminate it as a cabinet post, but he was not able to do so with a Democratic House of Representatives. In the 1982 State of the Union Address, he pledged: &quot;The budget plan I submit to you on Feb. 8 will realize major savings by dismantling the Department of Education.&quot;

In 1984, the GOP dropped the call for elimination from its platform. With the election of President George H. W. Bush in 1988, the Republican position evolved in almost lockstep with that of the Democrats, with Goals 2000 a virtual joint effort.

In 1994, after the Newt Gingrich-led &quot;revolution&quot; took control of both houses of Congress, federal control of and spending on education soared. That trend continued unabated despite the fact that the Republican Party made abolition of the department a cornerstone of 1996 platform and campaign promises, calling it an inappropriate federal intrusion into local, state, and family affairs. The GOP platform read: &quot;The Federal government has no constitutional authority to be involved in school curricula or to control jobs in the market place. This is why we will abolish the Department of Education, end federal meddling in our schools, and promote family choice at all levels of learning.&quot;

In 2000, the Republican Liberty Caucus passed a resolution to abolish the Department of Education.

=== 21st century ===
Abolition of the organization was not pursued under the George W. Bush administration, which made reform of federal education a key priority of the president&#x27;s first term. In 2008 and 2012, presidential candidate Ron Paul campaigned in part on an opposition to the department.

Under President George W. Bush, the department primarily focused on elementary and secondary education, expanding its reach through the No Child Left Behind Act. The department&#x27;s budget increased by $14 billion between 2002 and 2004, from $46 billion to $60 billion.

In March 2007, President George W. Bush signed into law , which designates the ED Headquarters building as the Lyndon Baines Johnson Department of Education Building.

In December 2015, President Barack Obama instituted the Every Student Succeeds Act, which reauthorized the Elementary Secondary Education Act. &quot;In December 2015, the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) was signed into law, reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) and replacing the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB). ESEA, the federal law that authorizes federal funding for K-12 schools, represents the nation&#x27;s commitment to equal educational opportunity for all students and has influenced the education of millions of children.&quot;

== Current Issues ==
In 2025, 47th President Donald Trump nominated Linda McMahon as Secretary of Education. Trump emphasized that McMahon&#x27;s primary objective would be to dismantle the Department of Education, stating, &quot;I want her to put herself out of a job.&quot; While the administration is preparing an executive order to initiate the department&#x27;s closure, legal experts note that abolishing a federal department requires congressional approval. NBC News said, &quot;Given their narrow majority, Republicans would need Democratic support to do that, which would make it unlikely for such a bill to pass.&quot; 

A Florida newspaper gave the following reasons for Trump&#x27;s initiative:
*Donald Trump has expressed a desire to eliminate the Department of Education, claiming it has been overtaken by &quot;radicals, zealots, and Marxists.&quot;
*He argues that the agency wastes taxpayer money and oversteps by involving the federal government in local education decisions, The Associated Press reported. 
*Trump&#x27;s push for the department&#x27;s closure is rooted in its perceived role in promoting liberal ideologies in schools.

President Trump is opposed in this by educators such as Derek W. Black, who believes the federal government has historically played an important role in American education.

The position of the National Education Association (NEA), representing 2.8 million American teachers, is that
*Stripping the department of its resources and mission would be catastrophic for the millions of students in low-income communities who need educational services and support. 
*Civil rights protections against discrimination based on race, gender, and disability would also be gutted.

<doc id="70922" wikidata="Q592576" url="?curid=70922" title="United States Department of Veterans Affairs">
<text>The United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is a Cabinet-level executive branch department of the federal government charged with providing lifelong healthcare services to eligible military veterans at the 170 VA medical centers and outpatient clinics located throughout the country. Non-healthcare benefits include disability compensation, vocational rehabilitation, education assistance, home loans, and life insurance. The VA also provides burial and memorial benefits to eligible veterans and family members at 135 national cemeteries.

While veterans&#x27; benefits have been provided by the federal government since the American Revolutionary War, a veteran-specific federal agency was not established until 1930, as the Veterans&#x27; Administration. In 1982, its mission was expanded to include caring for civilians and people who were not veterans in case of a national emergency. In 1989, the Veterans&#x27; Administration became a cabinet-level Department of Veterans Affairs. The president appoints the secretary of veterans affairs, who is also a cabinet member, to lead the agency.

 the VA employed 412,892 people at hundreds of Veterans Affairs medical facilities, clinics, benefits offices, and cemeteries. In fiscal year 2016 net program costs for the department were $273 billion, which includes the VBA Actuarial Cost of $106.5 billion for compensation benefits. The long-term &quot;actuarial accrued liability&quot; (total estimated future payments for veterans and their family members) is $2.491 trillion for compensation benefits; $59.6 billion for education benefits; and $4.6 billion for burial benefits.

==History==
The history and evolution of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs are inextricably intertwined and dependent on the history of America&#x27;s wars, as wounded former soldiers and other US military veterans are the population the VA cares for. The list of wars involving the United States from the American Revolutionary War to the present totals ninety-nine wars. The majority of the United States military casualties of war, however, occurred in the following eight wars: American Revolutionary War (est. 8,000), American Civil War (218,222), World War I (53,402), World War II (291,567), Korean War (33,686), Vietnam War (47,424), Iraq War (3,836), and the War in Afghanistan (1,833). It is these wars that have primarily driven the mission and evolution of the VA. The VA maintains a detailed list of war wounded, as it is this population that comprises the VA care system.

===Origins===
The Continental Congress of 1776 encouraged enlistments during the American Revolutionary War by providing pensions for soldiers who were disabled. Three weeks after passing the law compensating the injured, the Continental Congress in September 1776 also approved a resolution awarding grants of public land to all who served in the Continental Army for the duration of the conflict. Direct medical and hospital care given to veterans in the early days of the U.S. was provided by the individual states and communities. In 1811, the first domiciliary and medical facility for veterans was authorized by the federal government but not opened until 1834. In the 19th century, the nation&#x27;s veterans assistance program was expanded to include benefits and pensions not only for veterans but also their widows and dependents.

Prior to the end of the American Civil War in 1865, Delphine Baker, a volunteer nurse during the war, rallied support to petition the federal government to create a national home for Civil War veterans, based on the U.S. Soldiers Home in Washington, D.C. and the Naval Asylum in Philadelphia for U.S. active-duty veterans. The bill establishing the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers was passed on March 3, 1865. The very next day, President Abraham Lincoln vouched for the mission of the future facilities in his second inaugural address: With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation&#x27;s wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan—to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and a lasting peace, among ourselves, and with all nations.The middle section of that quote would later form the guiding principle for the future Department of Veterans Affairs.

While domiciliary care for Civil War veterans was managed by the National Home system at 11 various campuses, the pension benefits was split amongst various agencies in the federal government. Throughout the mid-to-late 19th Century, the Bureau of Pensions managed financial benefits to veterans, widows and dependent children. With the completion of the Civil War and an expansion of eligibility in 1890, pension numbers soared, from 303,000 to 966,000 in 1893. Eventually the workforce had to be housed in a new purpose-built home, the Pension Bureau building, which housed the organization from 1885 to 1926.

Furthermore, many state veterans&#x27; homes were established. Since domiciliary care was available at all state veterans homes, incidental medical and hospital treatment was provided for all injuries and diseases, whether or not of service origin. Indigent and disabled veterans of the Civil War, Indian Wars, Spanish–American War, and Mexican Border periods, as well as discharged regular members of the Armed Forces, were cared for at these homes.

===Veterans&#x27; Bureau===
The United States&#x27; entrance into World War I in 1917 caused a massive increase in veterans, overwhelming the federal system. When the Republican nominee for president Warren G. Harding accepted his party&#x27;s nomination to the 1920 presidential election, he issued a promise to the more than four million Americans who served in the war: It is not only a duty, it is a privilege to see that the sacrifices made shall be requited, and that those still suffering from casualties and disabilities shall be abundantly aided and restored to the highest capabilities of citizenship and enjoyment.At the time of the election, dissatisfaction with the benefits programs for World War I veterans ran rampant throughout the country. To receive benefits, veterans had to navigate through three different federal agencies: the Bureau of War Risk Insurance (BWRI) for insurance and compensation, the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) for medical and hospital care, and the Federal Board for Vocational Education for rehabilitation, education, and job training. Veterans from previous conflicts continued to rely on the Bureau of Pensions and National Homes for Disabled Volunteer Service for their compensation and medical care respectively.

After winning the election, President Harding appointed a committee in April 1921 to identify a solution. On August 8, 1921, Harding signed Public Law 67-47, popularly known as the Sweet Act, which established the Veterans&#x27; Bureau, which absorbed the War Risk Bureau and the Rehabilitation Division of the Federal Board for Vocational Education. In 1922, it gained a large number of veterans&#x27; hospital facilities from the Public Health Service, most of which had been recently established on former U.S. Army bases.

Charles Forbes led the fledgling agency through its initial two years, before resigning in 1923. His replacement, former brigadier general Frank T. Hines took on director of the Veterans&#x27; Bureau. By the 1920s, the various benefits were administered by three different federal agencies: the Veterans&#x27; Bureau, the Bureau of Pensions, and the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers.

The United States final federal consolidation of veteran government entities came on July 21, 1930, when President Herbert Hoover signed Executive Order 5398, merging all three agencies into the Veterans&#x27; Administration. Hines, who had remained in charge of the Veterans&#x27; Bureau for seven years, was named the first administrator of Veterans Affairs, a job he held until 1945 when he was replaced by General Omar Bradley.

===World War II===
The close of World War II resulted in not only a vast increase in the veteran population but also a large number of new benefits enacted by Congress for veterans of the war. In addition, during the late 1940s, the VA had to contend with aging World War I veterans. During that time, &quot;the clientele of the VA increased almost fivefold with an addition of nearly 16,000,000 World War II veterans and approximately 4,000,000 World War I veterans.&quot; Prior to World War II, in response to scandals at the Veterans Bureau, programs that cared for veterans were centralized in Washington, D.C. This centralization caused delays and bottlenecks as the agency tried to serve World War II veterans. As a result, the VA went through a decentralization process, giving more authority to the field offices.

The World War II GI Bill was signed into law on June 22, 1944, by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. &quot;The United States government began serious consolidated services to veterans in 1930. The GI Bill of Rights, which was passed in 1944, had more effect on the American way of life than any other legislation—with the possible exception of the Homestead Act.&quot;

Further educational assistance acts were passed for the benefit of veterans of the Korean War.

===Promotion to Department of Veterans Affairs===
The Department of Veterans Affairs Act of 1988 () changed the former Veterans&#x27; Administration, an independent government agency established in 1930 into a Cabinet-level Department of Veterans Affairs. It was signed into law by President Ronald Reagan on October 25, 1988, but came into effect under the term of his successor, George H. W. Bush, on March 15, 1989.

The reform period of 1995 to 2000 saw the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) dramatically improve care access, quality, and efficiency. This was achieved by leveraging its national integrated electronic health information system (VistA) and in so doing, implementing universal primary care, which increased patients treated by 24%, had a 48% increase in ambulatory care visits, and decreased staffing by 12%. By 2000, the VHA had 10,000 fewer employees than in 1995 and a 104% increase in patients treated since 1995, and had managed to maintain the same cost per patient-day, while all other facilities&#x27; costs had risen by over 30% to 40% during the same period.

Authored by Senator Jim Webb, the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008 doubled the GI Bill&#x27;s college benefits and provided a 13-week extension to federal unemployment benefits. The new GI Bill more than doubled the value of the benefit from $40,000 to about $90,000. In-state public universities are essentially covered to provide full scholarships for veterans under the new education package. For those veterans who served at least three years, a monthly housing stipend was also added to the law. Congress and President Barack Obama extended the new GI Bill in August 2009 at a cost of roughly $70 billion over the next decade. The Department of Defense (DoD) allows individuals who, on or after August 1, 2009, have served at least six years in the Armed Forces and who agree to serve at least another four years in the U.S. Armed Forces to transfer unused entitlement to their surviving spouse. Service members reaching 10-year anniversaries could choose to transfer the benefit to any dependents, such as their spouse or children.

In May 2014, critics of the VA system reported problems with scheduling timely access to medical care. In May 2014, a retired doctor said that veterans died because of delays in getting care at the Phoenix, Arizona, Veterans Health Administration facilities. An investigation of delays in treatment in the Veterans Health Administration system conducted by the Veterans Affairs Inspector General of 3,409 veteran patients found that there were 28 instances of clinically significant delays in care associated with access or scheduling. Of these 28 patients, six were deceased. The same OIG report stated that the Office of Investigations had opened investigations at 93 sites of care in response to allegations of wait time manipulations, and found that wait time manipulations were prevalent throughout the VHA. On May 30, 2014, Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki resigned from office due to the fallout from the scandal, saying he could not explain the lack of integrity among some leaders in VA healthcare facilities. &quot;That breach of integrity is irresponsible, it is indefensible, and unacceptable to me. I said when this situation began weeks to months ago that I thought the problem was limited and isolated because I believed that. I no longer believe it. It is systemic. I was too trusting of some and I accepted as accurate reports that I now know to have been misleading with regard to patient wait-times,&quot; Shinseki said in a statement.

In September 2017, the VA declared its intent to abolish a 1960s conflict of interest rule prohibiting employees from owning stock in, performing service for, or doing any work at for-profit colleges; arguing that, for example, the rule prohibits VA doctors from teaching veterans at for-profit universities with special advantages for veterans. In 2018, the VA instead established a process for employees to seek waivers of the policy based on individual circumstances.
In 2023, the VA adopted a new mission statement: “To fulfill President Lincoln&#x27;s promise to care for those who have served in our nation&#x27;s military and for their families, caregivers, and survivors.” The VA&#x27;s previous mission statement, established in 1959, was, “To fulfill President Lincoln&#x27;s promise ‘to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan’ by serving and honoring the men and women who are America&#x27;s veterans.”

==Functions==
The VA&#x27;s primary function is to support veterans in their time after service by providing benefits and support.

Providing care for non-veteran civilian or military patients in case hospitals overflowed in a crisis was added as a role by Congress in 1982, and became known as the VA&#x27;s &quot;fourth mission&quot; (besides the three missions of serving veterans through care, research, and training). It can provide medical services (reimbursed from other federal agencies) to the general public for major disasters and emergencies declared by the president of the United States, and when the secretary of health and human services activates the National Disaster Medical System. During disasters and health emergencies, requests for VA assistance are made by state governors to the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the Department of Health and Human Services, which then relay approved requests to the VA. The VA is also allowed to provide paid medical care on an emergency basis to non-veterans. On March 27, 2020, the VA made public its COVID-19 response plan within its medical facilities to protect veterans, their families, and staff.

One initiative in the department is to prevent and end veterans&#x27; homelessness. The VA works with the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness to address these issues. The USICH identified ending veterans&#x27; homelessness by 2015 as a primary goal in its proposal &quot;Opening Doors: Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness&quot;, released in 2010; amendments to the 2010 version made in 2015 include a preface written by U.S. Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez that cites a 33% reduction in veteran homelessness since the creation of the &quot;Opening Doors&quot; initiative. The prominent role of the Department of Veterans Affairs and its joined up approach to veteran welfare are such that they have been deemed to distinguish the US response to veteran homelessness internationally.

The General Services Administration (GSA) has delegated authority to the VA to procure medical supplies under the VA Federal Supply Schedules Program for both the VA itself and other government agencies.

==Organization==
The Department of Veterans Affairs is headed by the secretary of veterans affairs, appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the Senate.

The secretary of veterans affairs is Doug Collins who was selected by President Donald Trump and on February 5, 2025, Collins was sworn into office by associate justice Clarence Thomas as the 12th Secretary of Veterans Affairs. The deputy secretary of veterans affairs position is currently vacant with the retirement of Thomas G. Bowman on June 15, 2018. The third listed executive on the VA&#x27;s official web site is its chief of staff (currently Pamela J. Powers); the chief of staff position does not require Senate confirmation. In addition to secretary and deputy secretary, the VA has ten more positions requiring presidential appointment and Senate approval.

The department has three main subdivisions, known as administrations, each headed by an undersecretary:

*Veterans Health Administration (VHA): responsible for providing health care in all its forms, as well as for biomedical research (under the Office of Research and Development), Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs), Regional Medical Centers (VAMC), and Readjustment Counseling Services (RCS) Vet Centers.
*Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA): responsible for initial veteran registration, eligibility determination, and five key lines of business (benefits and entitlements): Home Loan Guarantee, Insurance, Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment, Education (GI Bill), and Compensation &amp; Pension
*National Cemetery Administration: responsible for providing burial and memorial benefits, as well as for maintenance of VA cemeteries

There are assistant secretaries of veteran affairs for: Congressional and Legislative Affairs; Policy and Planning; Human Resources and Administration; and Operations, Security and Preparedness. Other Senate-approved presidential nominees at the VA include the Chief Financial Officer; Chairman of the Board of Veterans&#x27; Appeals; General Counsel; and Inspector General.

The VA employs 377,805 people, of whom 338,205 are nonseasonal full-time employees. The American Federation of Government Employees represents 230,000 VA employees, with VA matters addressed in detail by the &quot;National VA Council&quot;.

===Veterans Benefits Administration===

The VA, through its Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), provides a variety of services for veterans, including disability compensation, pension, education, home loans, life insurance, vocational, rehabilitation, survivors&#x27; benefits, health care, and burial benefits.

The Department of Labor (DOL) provides job development and job training opportunities for disabled and other veterans through contacts with employers and local agencies.

===National Cemetery Administration===

In 1973, the Department of Veterans Affairs assumed responsibility for the National Cemetery System (NCS), with the exception of Arlington National Cemetery, which was transferred from the Department of the Army. This was made official by Public Law 93-43, also known as the National Cemeteries Act of 1973.

Five years later, Congress established the State Cemetery Grants Program under Public Law 95-476. The National Cemetery Administration now administers this program, which provides assistance to states and U.S. territories in establishing, expanding, and improving veterans cemeteries.

The National Cemetery Administration (NCA) is a division of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) responsible for providing burial and memorial benefits to eligible veterans and their families. Its primary mission is to honor veterans and their service to the nation by ensuring they receive dignified and respectful interments in national cemeteries.

Key responsibilities of the NCA include:

# Operation and Maintenance: The NCA manages and maintains national cemeteries across the United States, ensuring they are well-kept and respectful places of remembrance.
# Burial Services: The administration provides burial options, including in-ground casket burials, columbarium niches for cremated remains, and in some cases, private family plots.
# Headstones and Markers: The NCA furnishes headstones, markers, and medallions for the graves of eligible veterans, regardless of whether they are buried in a national cemetery, a state veterans cemetery, or a private cemetery.
# Memorial Programs: The NCA administers programs such as the Presidential Memorial Certificate program, which provides certificates bearing the President&#x27;s signature to honor the memory of deceased veterans.
# Expansion and Development: The NCA is involved in the planning and development of new national cemeteries to ensure that burial options remain available to veterans and their families in various regions of the country. The NCA&#x27;s overarching goal is to provide a final resting place that honors the service and sacrifice of veterans, ensuring their legacy is preserved for future generations.

===Center for Women Veterans===
The Center for Women Veterans (CWA) was established within the Department of Veterans Affairs by Public Law 103-446 in November 1994. The center&#x27;s mission is to:

*Monitor and coordinate the VA&#x27;s delivery of health care, benefits, and programs for women veterans
*Advocate for cultural transformation (within VA and in the general public) in recognizing the service and contributions of women veterans and women in the military
*Raise awareness of the responsibility to treat women veterans with dignity and respect.

Center for Women Veterans activities include monitoring and coordinating delivery of benefits and services to women veterans; coordinating with Federal, state, and local agencies and organizations and non-government partners which serve women veterans; serving as a resource and referral center for women veterans, their families, and their advocates; educating VA staff on women&#x27; military contributions; ensuring that outreach materials portray and target women veterans; promoting recognition of women veterans&#x27; service with activities and special events; and coordinating meetings of the Advisory Committee on Women Veterans. CWA has held summits and forums for female veterans and created social media campaigns and exhibits to highlight women&#x27;s military service. CWA offers a Women Veterans Call Center (1-855-829-6636) to assist female U.S. military veterans with VA services and resources. In 2018, the Center for Women Veterans launched the &quot;I Am Not Invisible&quot; photography project, featuring individual portraits, to highlight and represent the contributions, needs, and experiences of America&#x27;s two million women veterans.

==Costs for care==
The VA categorizes veterans into eight priority groups and several additional subgroups, based on factors such as service-connected disabilities, and their income and assets (adjusted to local cost of living).

Veterans with a 50% or higher service-connected disability as determined by a VA regional office &quot;rating board&quot; (e.g., losing a limb in battle, PTSD, etc.) are provided comprehensive care and medication at no charge. Veterans with lesser qualifying factors who exceed a pre-defined income threshold have to make co-payments for care for non-service-connected ailments and prescription medication. VA dental and nursing home care benefits are more restricted.
Reservists and National Guard personnel who served stateside in peacetime settings or have no service-related disabilities generally do not qualify for VA health benefits.

The VA&#x27;s budget has been pushed to the limit in recent years by the War on Terrorism. In December 2004, it was widely reported that VA&#x27;s funding crisis had become so severe that it could no longer provide disability ratings to veterans in a timely fashion. This is a problem because until veterans are fully transitioned from the active-duty TRICARE healthcare system to VA, they are on their own with regard to many healthcare costs.

The VA&#x27;s backlog of pending disability claims under review (a process known as &quot;adjudication&quot;) peaked at 421,000 in 2001, and bottomed out at 254,000 in 2003, but crept back up to 340,000 in 2005.

These numbers are released every Monday.

No copayment is required for VA services for veterans with military-related medical conditions. VA-recognized service-connected disabilities include problems that started or were aggravated due to military service. Veteran service organizations such as the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, and Disabled American Veterans, as well as state-operated Veterans Affairs offices and County Veteran Service Officers (CVSO), have been known to assist veterans in the process of getting care from the VA.

In his budget proposal for fiscal year 2009, President George W. Bush requested $38.7 billion—or 86.5% of the total Veterans Affairs budget—for veteran medical care alone.

In the 2011 Costs of War report from Brown University, researchers projected that the cost of caring for veterans of the War on Terror would peak 30–40 years after the end of combat operations. They also predicted that medical and disability costs would ultimately total between $600 billion and $1 trillion for the hundreds of thousands treated by the Department of Veterans Affairs.

==Freedom of Information Act processing performance==
In a 2015 Center for Effective Government analysis of 15 federal agencies which receive the most Freedom of Information Act (United States) (FOIA) requests (using 2012 and 2013 data, the most recent years available), the VA earned a D by scoring 64 out of a possible 100 points, i.e. did not earn a satisfactory overall grade, for facilitating FOIA requests.

<doc id="70924" wikidata="Q2427900" url="?curid=70924" title="Music technology (electronic and digital)">
<text>Digital music technology encompasses the use of digital instruments to produce, perform or record music. These instruments vary, including computers, electronic effects units, software, and digital audio equipment. Digital music technology is used in performance, playback, recording, composition, mixing, analysis and editing of music, by professions in all parts of the music industry.

==History==
In the late 19th century, Thaddeus Cahill introduced the Telharmonium, which is commonly considered the first electromechanical musical instrument. In the early 20th century, Leon Theremin created the Theremin, an early electronic instrument played without physical contact, creating a new form of sound creation.

In the mid-20th century, sampling emerged, with artists like Pierre Schaeffer and Karlheinz Stockhausen manipulating recorded sounds on tape to create entirely new compositions. This laid the foundation for future electronic music production techniques.

In the 1960s, the Moog synthesizer, invented by Robert Moog, popularized analog synthesis. Musician Wendy Carlos demonstrated Robert&#x27;s invention with the album &quot;Switched-On Bach&quot;, which consisted of works composed by Johann Sebastian Bach interpreted with the Moog synthesizer. Meanwhile, tape-based studios, like the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, were at the forefront of electronic sound design.

The 1980s saw a major shift towards digital technology with the development of the Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) standard. This allowed electronic instruments to communicate with computers and each other, transforming music production. Digital synthesizers, such as the Yamaha DX7, became widely popular.

The 1990s and 2000s witnessed the explosive growth of electronic dance music and its various subgenres, driven by the accessibility of digital music production tools and the rise of computer-based software synthesizers.

==Education==

===Professional training===

Courses in music technology are offered at many different universities as part of degree programs focusing on performance, composition, music research at the undergraduate and graduate level. The study of music technology is usually concerned with the creative use of technology for creating new sounds, performing, recording, programming sequencers or other music-related electronic devices, and manipulating, mixing and reproducing music. Music technology programs train students for careers in &quot;...sound engineering, computer music, audio-visual production and post-production, mastering, scoring for film and multimedia, audio for games, software development, and multimedia production.&quot; Those wishing to develop new music technologies often train to become an audio engineer working in research and development. Due to the increasing role of interdisciplinary work in music technology, individuals developing new music technologies may also have backgrounds or training in electrical engineering, computer programming, computer hardware design, acoustics, record producing or other fields.

===Use of music technology in education===
Digital music technologies are widely used to assist in music education for training students in the home, elementary school, middle school, high school, college and university music programs. Electronic keyboard labs are used for cost-effective beginner group piano instruction in high schools, colleges, and universities. Courses in music notation software and basic manipulation of audio and MIDI can be part of a student&#x27;s core requirements for a music degree. Mobile and desktop applications are available to aid the study of music theory and ear training. Some digital pianos provide interactive lessons and games using the built-in features of the instrument to teach music fundamentals.

==== Analog Synthesizers ====
Classic analog synthesizers include the Moog Minimoog, ARP Odyssey, Yamaha CS-80, Korg MS-20, Sequential Circuits Prophet-5, Roland TB-303, Roland Alpha Juno. One of the most iconic synthesizers is the Roland TB-303, was widely used in acid house music.

=== Digital synthesizer history ===
Classic digital synthesizers include the Fairlight CMI, PPG Wave, Nord Modular and Korg M1.

=== Computer music history ===
==== Max Mathews ====

Computer and synthesizer technology joining together changed the way music is made and is one of the fastest-changing aspects of music technology today. Max Mathews, an acoustic researcher at Bell Telephone Laboratories&#x27; Acoustic and Behavioural Research Department, is responsible for some of the first digital music technology in the 1950s. Mathews also pioneered a cornerstone of music technology; analog-to-digital conversion.

At Bell Laboratories, Matthews conducted research to improve the telecommunications quality for long-distance phone calls. Owing to long-distance and low-bandwidth, audio quality over phone calls across the United States was poor. Thus, Matthews devised a method in which sound was synthesized via computer on the distant end rather than transmitted. Matthews was an amateur violinist, and during a conversation with his superior, John Pierce at Bell Labs, Pierce posed the idea of synthesizing music through a computer. Since Matthews had already synthesized speech, he agreed and wrote a series of programs known as MUSIC. MUSIC consisted of two files: an orchestra file containing data telling the computer how to synthesize sound, and a score file instructing the program what notes to play using the instruments defined in the orchestra file. Matthews wrote five iterations of MUSIC, calling them MUSIC I-V respectively. Subsequently, as the program was adapted and expanded to run on various platforms, its name changed to reflect its new changes. This series of programs became known as the MUSIC-N paradigm. The concept of the MUSIC now exists in the form of Csound.

Later Max Matthews worked as an advisor to IRCAMin the late 1980s. There, he taught Miller Puckette, a researcher. Puckette developed a program in which music could be programmed graphically. The program could transmit and receive MIDI messages to generate interactive music in real-time. Inspired by Matthews, Puckette named the program Max. Later, a researcher named David Zicarelli visited IRCAM, saw the capabilities of Max and felt it could be developed further. He took a copy of Max with him when he left and eventually added capabilities to process audio signals. Zicarelli named this new part of the program MSP after Miller Puckette. Zicarelli developed the commercial version of MaxMSP and sold it at his company, Cycling &#x27;74, beginning in 1997. The company has since been acquired by Ableton.

==== Later history ====
The first generation of professional commercially available computer music instruments, or workstations as some companies later called them, were very sophisticated elaborate systems that cost a great deal of money when they first appeared. They ranged from $25,000 to $200,000. The two most popular were the Fairlight, and the Synclavier.

It was not until the advent of MIDI that general-purpose computers started to play a role in music production. Following the widespread adoption of MIDI, computer-based MIDI editors and sequencers were developed. MIDI-to-CV/Gate converters were then used to enable analog synthesizers to be controlled by a MIDI sequencer.

=== MIDI history ===
At the NAMM Show of 1983 in Los Angeles, MIDI was released. A demonstration at the convention showed two previously incompatible analog synthesizers, the Prophet 600 and Roland Jupiter-6, communicating with each other, enabling a player to play one keyboard while getting the output from both of them. This was a massive breakthrough in the 1980s, as it allowed synths to be accurately layered in live shows and studio recordings. MIDI enables different electronic instruments and electronic music devices to communicate with each other and with computers. The advent of MIDI spurred a rapid expansion of the sales and production of electronic instruments and music software.

In 1985, several of the top keyboard manufacturers created the MIDI Manufacturers Association (MMA). This newly founded association standardized the MIDI protocol by generating and disseminating all the documents about it. With the development of the MIDI File Format Specification by Opcode, every music software company&#x27;s MIDI sequencer software could read and write each other&#x27;s files.

Since the 1980s, personal computers developed and became the ideal system for utilizing the vast potential of MIDI. This has created a large consumer market for software such as MIDI-equipped electronic keyboards, MIDI sequencers and digital audio workstations. With universal MIDI protocols, electronic keyboards, sequencers, and drum machines can all be connected together.

=== Vocal synthesis history until 1980s ===
====VODER on Bell Lab.====

Coinciding with the history of computer music is the history of vocal synthesis. Prior to Max Matthews synthesizing speech with a computer, analog devices were used to recreate speech. In the 1930s, an engineer named Holmer Dudley invented the VODER (Voice Operated Demonstrator), an electro-mechanical device which generated a sawtooth wave and white-noise. Various parts of the frequency spectrum of the waveforms could be filtered to generate the sounds of speech. Pitch was modulated via a bar on a wrist strap worn by the operator. In the 1940s Dudley, invented the VOCODER (Voice Operated Coder). Rather than synthesizing speech from scratch, this machine operated by accepting incoming speech and breaking it into its spectral components. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, bands and solo artists began using the VOCODER to blend speech with notes played on a synthesizer.

====Singing Kelly-Lochbaum Vocal Tract on Bell Lab.====

Meanwhile, at Bell Laboratories, Max Matthews worked with researchers Kelly and Lochbaum to develop a model of the vocal tract to study how its prosperities contributed to speech generation. Using the model of the vocal tract, —a method in which a computer estimates the formants and spectral content of each word based on information about the vocal model, including various applied filters representing the vocal tract—to make a computer (an IBM 704) sing for the first time in 1962. The computer performed a rendition of &quot;Daisy Bell&quot;.

====CHANT on IRCAM====
At IRCAM in France, researchers developed software called CHANT (French for &quot;sing&quot;), the first version of which ran between 1979 and 1983. CHANT was based FOF () synthesis, in which the peak frequencies of a sound are created and shaped using granular synthesis—as opposed to filtering frequencies to create speech.

====Concatenation synthesis using MIDI====
Through the 1980s and 1990s as MIDI devices became commercially available, speech was generated by mapping MIDI data to samples of the components of speech stored in sample libraries.

=== Vocal synthesis after 2010s ===
In the 2010s, Singing synthesis technology has taken advantage of the recent advances in artificial intelligence—deep listening and machine learning to better represent the nuances of the human voice. New high fidelity sample libraries combined with digital audio workstations facilitate editing in fine detail, such as shifting of formats, adjustment of vibrato, and adjustments to vowels and consonants. Sample libraries for various languages and various accents are available. With today&#x27;s advancements in vocal synthesis, artists sometimes use sample libraries in lieu of backing singers.

==Synthesizers and drum machines==
===Synthesizers===
A synthesizer is an electronic musical instrument that generates electric signals that are converted to sound through instrument amplifiers and loudspeakers or headphones. Synthesizers may either imitate existing sounds (instruments, vocal, natural sounds, etc.), or generate new electronic timbres or sounds that did not exist before. They are often played with an electronic musical keyboard, but they can be controlled via a variety of other input devices, including music sequencers, instrument controllers, fingerboards, guitar synthesizers, wind controllers, and electronic drums. Synthesizers without built-in controllers are often called sound modules, and are controlled using a controller device.

Synthesizers use various methods to generate a signal. Among the most popular waveform synthesis techniques are subtractive synthesis, additive synthesis, wavetable synthesis, frequency modulation synthesis, phase distortion synthesis, physical modeling synthesis and sample-based synthesis. Other less common synthesis types include subharmonic synthesis, a form of additive synthesis via subharmonics (used by Mixtur-Trautonium), and granular synthesis, sample-based synthesis based on grains of sound, generally resulting in soundscapes or clouds. In the 2010s, synthesizers are used in many genres of pop, rock and dance music. Contemporary classical music composers from the 20th and 21st century write compositions for synthesizer.

===Drum machines===
A drum machine is an electronic musical instrument designed to imitate the sound of drums, cymbals, other percussion instruments, and often basslines. Drum machines either play back prerecorded samples of drums and cymbals or synthesized re-creations of drum/cymbal sounds in a rhythm and tempo that is programmed by a musician. Drum machines are most commonly associated with electronic dance music genres such as house music, but are also used in many other genres. They are also used when session drummers are not available or if the production cannot afford the cost of a professional drummer. In the 2010s, most modern drum machines are sequencers with a sample playback (rompler) or synthesizer component that specializes in the reproduction of drum timbres. Though features vary from model to model, many modern drum machines can also produce unique sounds, and allow the user to compose unique drum beats and patterns.

Electro-mechanical drum machines were first developed in 1949, with the invention of the Chamberlin Rhythmate. Transistorized electronic drum machines Seeburg Select-A-Rhythm appeared in 1964.

Classic drum machines include the Korg Mini Pops 120, PAiA Programmable Drum Set, Roland CR-78, LinnDrum, Roland TR-909, Oberheim DMX, E-MU SP-12, Alesis HR-16, and Elektron SPS1 Machinedrum (in chronological order).

====Drum machines in Japan====

In the late 1970s and 1980s, Japanese manufacturers, including Roland and Korg, assumed pivotal roles in the transformation of the musical landscape. Roland&#x27;s TR-808 and TR-909 significantly changed the landscape of rhythm production. shaping genres like hip-hop and electronic dance music. Korg&#x27;s KPR-77 and DDD-1 also made an impact. These drum machines were known for their distinctive sound and affordability. Over time, Japanese companies continued to innovate, producing increasingly sophisticated and user-friendly drum machines, such as the Roland TR-8 and Korg Volca Beats. These instruments continue to influence contemporary music production and remain integral to the electronic music landscape worldwide.Sly and the Family Stone&#x27;s 1971 album &quot;There&#x27;s a Riot Goin&#x27; On&quot; helped to popularize the sound of early drum machines, along with Timmy Thomas&#x27; 1972 R&amp;B hit &quot;Why Can&#x27;t We Live Together&quot; and George McCrae&#x27;s 1974 disco hit &quot;Rock Your Baby&quot; which used early Roland rhythm machines.

Early drum machines sounded drastically different than the drum machines that gained their peak popularity in the 1980s and defined an entire decade of pop music. The most iconic drum machine was the Roland TR-808, widely used in hip hop and dance music.

==Sampling technology after 1980s==
Digital sampling technology, introduced in the 1970s, Devices that use sampling, record a sound digitally (often a musical instrument, such as a piano or flute being played), and replay it when a key or pad on a controller device (e.g., an electronic keyboard, electronic drum pad, etc.) is pressed or triggered. Samplers can alter the sound using various audio effects and audio processing. Sampling has its roots in France with the sound experiments carried out by musique concrète practitioners.

In the 1980s, when the technology was still in its infancy, digital samplers cost tens of thousands of dollars and they were only used by the top recording studios and musicians. These were out of the price range of most musicians. Early samplers include the 8-bit Electronic Music Studios MUSYS-3 circa 1970, Computer Music Melodian in 1976, Fairlight CMI in 1979, Emulator I in 1981, Synclavier II Sample-to-Memory (STM) option circa 1980, Ensoniq Mirage in 1984, and Akai S612 in 1985. The latter&#x27;s successor, the Emulator II (released in 1984), listed for $8,000. Samplers were released during this period with high price tags, such as the K2000 and K2500.

Some important hardware samplers include the Kurzweil K250, Akai MPC60, Ensoniq Mirage, Ensoniq ASR-10, Akai S1000, E-mu Emulator, and Fairlight CMI.

One of the biggest uses of sampling technology was by hip-hop music DJs and performers in the 1980s. Before affordable sampling technology was readily available, DJs would use a technique pioneered by Grandmaster Flash to manually repeat certain parts in a song by juggling between two separate turntables. This can be considered as an early precursor of sampling. In turn, this turntablism technique originates from Jamaican dub music in the 1960s and was introduced to American hip hop in the 1970s.

In the 2000s, most professional recording studios use digital technologies. In recent years, many samplers have only included digital technology. This new generation of digital samplers are capable of reproducing and manipulating sounds. Digital sampling plays an integral part in some genres of music, such as hip-hop and trap. Advanced sample libraries have made complete performances of orchestral compositions possible that sound similar to a live performance. Modern sound libraries allow musicians to have the ability to use the sounds of almost any instrument in their productions.

===Sampling technology in Japan===
Early samplers include the 12-bit Toshiba in 1981.

The first affordable sampler in Japan was the Ensoniq Mirage in 1984. Also the AKAI S612 became available in 1985, retailed for US$895. Other companies soon released affordable samplers, including Oberheim DPX-1 in 1987, and more by Korg, Casio, Yamaha, and Roland. Some important hardware samplers in Japan include the Akai Z4/Z8, Roland V-Synth, Casio FZ-1.

==MIDI==

MIDI has been the musical instrument industry standard interface since the 1980s through to the present day. It dates back to June 1981, when Roland Corporation founder Ikutaro Kakehashi proposed the concept of standardization between different manufacturers&#x27; instruments as well as computers, to Oberheim Electronics founder Tom Oberheim and Sequential Circuits president Dave Smith. In October 1981, Kakehashi, Oberheim and Smith discussed the concept with representatives from Yamaha, Korg and Kawai. In 1983, the MIDI standard was unveiled by Kakehashi and Smith.

Some universally accepted varieties of MIDI software applications include music instruction software, MIDI sequencing software, music notation software, hard disk recording/editing software, patch editor/sound library software, computer-assisted composition software, and virtual instruments. Current developments in computer hardware and specialized software continue to expand MIDI applications.

==Computers in music technology after 1980s==
Following the widespread adoption of MIDI, computer-based MIDI editors and sequencers were developed. MIDI-to-CV/Gate converters were then used to enable analogue synthesizers to be controlled by a MIDI sequencer.

Reduced prices in personal computers caused the masses to turn away from the more expensive workstations. Advancements in technology have increased the speed of hardware processing and the capacity of memory units. Software developers write new, more powerful programs for sequencing, recording, notating, and mastering music.

Digital audio workstation software, such as Pro Tools, Logic, and many others, have gained popularity among the vast array of contemporary music technology in recent years. Such programs allow the user to record acoustic sounds with a microphone or software instrument, which may then be layered and organized along a timeline and edited on a flat-panel display of a computer. Recorded segments can be copied and duplicated ad infinitum, without any loss of fidelity or added noise (a major contrast from analog recording, in which every copy leads to a loss of fidelity and added noise). Digital music can be edited and processed using a multitude of audio effects. Contemporary classical music sometimes uses computer-generated sounds—either pre-recorded or generated and manipulated live—in conjunction or juxtaposed on classical acoustic instruments like the cello or violin. Music is scored with commercially available notation software.

In addition to the digital audio workstations and music notation software, which facilitate the creation of fixed media (material that does not change each time it is performed), software facilitating interactive or generative music continues to emerge. Composition based on conditions or rules (algorithmic composition) has given rise to software which can automatically generate music based on input conditions or rules. Thus, the resulting music evolves each time conditions change. Examples of this technology include software designed for writing music for video games—where music evolves as a player advances through a level or when certain characters appear—or music generated from artificial intelligence trained to convert biometrics like EEG or ECG readings into music. Because this music is based on user interaction, it will be different each time it is heard. Other examples of generative music technology include the use of sensors connected to computer and artificial intelligence to generate music based on captured data, such as environmental factors, the movements of dancers, or physical inputs from a digital device such as a mouse or game controller. Software applications offering capabilities for generative and interactive music include SuperCollider, MaxMSP/Jitter, and Processing. Interactive music is made possible through physical computing, where the data from the physical world affects a computer&#x27;s output and vice versa.

<text>Robbinson Lantz Crosby (August 4, 1959 – June 6, 2002) was an American guitarist who was a member of glam metal band Ratt, earning several platinum albums in the US in the 1980s. Crosby died in 2002 from a heroin overdose.

==Early life==

In the late 1970s, Crosby played in several San Diego bands. From 1977–78 he played in Phenomenon, recording a single &quot;The Final Word,&quot; which was written by Crosby. It was released in 1980. Phenomenon also featured future Warrior member Parramore McCarty. While playing with Phenomenon, he took lessons from Thom Beebe, described as &quot;a monster player in the Blackmore vein.&quot; After Phenomenon folded, Crosby and the drummer from Phenomenon began playing with Metropolis from 1978–1979, playing popular Judas Priest and Robin Trower songs on the La Jolla Beach Circuit. Metropolis didn&#x27;t last long, and, in 1979, Crosby teamed up with former members of Phenomenon and Metropolis to create a new band, Secret Service. Crosby moved to Manhattan Beach, California, in 1979, living with his girlfriend Tawny Kitaen. The band was short lived and, in 1980, Crosby was in a band Aircraft. The same year he also recorded a live demo with the band Aircraft, which also featured Rob Lamothe, later in Riverdogs with Dio/Whitesnake/Def Leppard guitarist Vivian Campbell. In 1981, Aircraft changed its name to Mac Meda, which Crosby&#x27;s brother-in-law managed. They recorded six songs on Vulture record label sometime in 1981, but the songs didn&#x27;t help them launch a career. However, the move to the Los Angeles area provided Mac Meda with access to a vibrant club scene, which they soon became a part of, even playing the famed Troubadour (West Hollywood, California) on May 7, 1981.

===With Ratt===
Crosby was one of the original members of the San Diego rock band Mickey Ratt, later to be rechristened simply &quot;Ratt&quot;. He would end up co-writing many of Ratt&#x27;s songs, including &quot;Round and Round&quot;, &quot;Wanted Man&quot; and &quot;Lay It Down&quot;. The album &quot;Out of the Cellar&quot; went to triple platinum based on &quot;Round and Round&quot;.

Crosby was dating actress Tawny Kitaen at the time he joined Ratt, and she appears on the album covers of both the &quot;Ratt EP&quot; (1983) and &quot;Out of the Cellar&quot; (1984). Crosby and Kitaen broke up in 1984 after a six-year relationship.

In the coming years, Crosby would buy a home in the Hollywood Hills of Los Angeles. He married Playboy Playmate Laurie Carr in 1987; they divorced in 1991. They had no children.

Crosby&#x27;s solos were blues-based, as he drew inspiration from Jimi Hendrix, which gave Ratt melodic flavors. His style was at odds with shredding style of fellow Ratt guitarist Warren DeMartini, but their two styles also complemented each other, differentiating Ratt from other west coast glam rock bands. Feeling &quot;overshadowed&quot; by DeMartini, Crosby began &quot;self-medicating with drugs and alcohol,&quot; which led to a crippling heroin addiction.

As Ratt stepped in the studio in 1990, Crosby entered rehab. According to Crosby&#x27;s brother-in-law, the guitarist was also addicted to cocaine and &quot;other stuff&quot; and was repeatedly in and out of rehab.

===After Ratt===
Crosby eventually left Ratt. Prior to leaving, Crosby worked as a producer for metal band Lillian Axe.

In a June 1999 interview for a Ratt episode of VH1&#x27;s &quot;Behind the Music&quot;, Crosby talked about how drug addiction and his HIV status changed his life. &quot;What has drug addiction done for me?&quot; he asked. &quot;It&#x27;s cost me my career, my fortune, basically my sex life when I found out I was HIV positive.&quot;

In 2001, Crosby publicly stated that he had AIDS and had been HIV-positive since 1994. He had also been in and out of the hospital for eight years dealing with back problems and health issues associated with HIV. To occupy his time he became a Little League coach, and also worked on a guitar fan/collector project, which was to create a limited-edition run of Jackson King V &quot;Big Red&quot; replica guitars.

Crosby also attempted various musical projects, first (post-Ratt) re-uniting with Perry McCarty, Krys Baratto, Dino Guerrero and Mark Lewis as an updated version of Secret Service, a moniker used by McCarty and Crosby previously for their pre-Ratt San Diego band. Later moving to El Paso in 1996, he briefly played with the Country/Western group War Party. One of his last projects was with former collaborator and ex-Ratt bassist Juan Croucier.

==Death==
Crosby died at his home in Los Angeles on June 6, 2002. Although his death was reported to be from complications from AIDS, he actually died of a heroin overdose (although he had also previously tested positive for HIV). According to an autopsy report after his death, Crosby was and weighed .

<text>Toastmasters International (TI) is a US-headquartered nonprofit educational organization that operates clubs worldwide for the purpose of helping people develop communication, public speaking, and leadership skills.

==History==
On 24 March 1905, Dr. Ralph C. Smedley, a 1903 graduate from Illinois Wesleyan University, who was also the educational director for Bloomington YMCA in Illinois, started a club in a dinner meeting, to train young boys and men in speech, to face an audience, and to express their thoughts. He envisioned it as a weekly social club, with training programs for short speeches, debates, and work in chairmanship. The members took turn to speak in 5 to 6 minutes while the elder men served as speech evaluators. George Sutton, General Secretary of YMCA, named the club &quot;a Toastmasters Club&quot;. Smedley later noticed a significant improvement in his members&#x27; speeches and leadership abilities. When YMCA transferred Smedley to another city named Freeport in Illinois, he decided to expand his club to the new city.

The organization grew out of a single club founded by Smedley on October 22, 1924, at the YMCA in Santa Ana, California, United States. It originated as a set of classes with the aim of improving the communication skills of the young men under his charge. Toastmasters International was incorporated under Californian law on December 19, 1932.

The first international chapter was established in Vancouver, Canada, in 1932. The organization began admitting women in 1973.

In 1999, Toastmasters International (TI) had 170,000 members spanning 68 countries. By 2016, TI had 16,000 clubs worldwide.

==Toastmasters club structure==
Toastmasters International uses a local club-based structure, with an average club size of around 22 members. Meetings are held every week or every other week and usually in the evening, although some clubs meet in the morning or afternoon. Each club operates as a separate entity with a set of requirements leading to chartered status for them to be recognised as official Toastmasters clubs. The chartered status allows clubs to use the names, promotional material and program of Toastmasters International.

Every meeting is based on a set of organized speeches. Speakers are given feedback, often by a more experienced member, who then gives an impromptu speech with constructive feedback based on their performance.

Part of the meetings is devoted to Table Topics, which are impromptu speeches that are assigned on the spot by a Topicsmaster. The goal of this is to think on one&#x27;s feet with minimal preparation. In some clubs, attendees are then asked to vote on who they thought gave the best speech.

==Education programs==
Toastmasters International places a large emphasis on building the public speaking and leadership skills of its members. The current education system Pathways consists of eleven differing paths suited to their needs and requirements, based around &quot;Public Speaking&quot;, &quot;Interpersonal Communication&quot;, &quot;Management&quot;, &quot;Strategic Leadership&quot;, and &quot;Confidence&quot;. Each path consists of 14 projects. Content consists of online and print materials, it being the first time in the organization’s history to provide modern technology in its programme. Content is available in English, and as of 2023, translations are available in 10 languages. Speechcraft is a 4- to 8-week program with materials hosted online and is conducted by experienced Toastmasters members for non-members. To develop leadership skills, members lead at the club, area, or district levels, focus on content development, and participate in speech contests.

==Public speaking championship==
Toastmasters runs an international public speaking championship formally known as the Toastmasters International World Champion of Public Speaking, which is held annually at its International Convention in August. It started in 1938 and involves over 33,000 participants in 141 countries, making it the world&#x27;s largest oratory contest. There is a six-month process of elimination to reach the semifinals; in 2018, there were 106 participants who made it that far. There are ten places in the final, and speeches are judged on content, gestures, organization, and style.

<doc id="70933" wikidata="Q1470670" url="?curid=70933" title="Sécurité">
<text>Sécurité (; French: &quot;sécurité&quot;) (often repeated thrice, &quot;Sécurité, sécurité, sécurité&quot;) is a procedure word used in the maritime radio service that warns the crew that the following message is important safety information. The most common use of this is by coast radio stations before the broadcast of navigational warnings and meteorological information.

Navigational warnings are issued regularly and usually give information about people or vessels in distress and objects or events that can be an immediate danger to people at sea and how they are navigating. In the United States, MARAD (Marine Administration) sends out infrequent advisories about potential global political climate dangers. There are four types of navigational warnings, which are categorized by their location. These areas are NAVAREA IV, HYDROLANT, NAVAREA XII, and HYDROPAC.
Meteorological information is information that is about the marine atmosphere. These meteorological advisories include the development of weather systems such as and not limited to, rain squalls, big tidal drops, major current shifts, lightning storms, hurricane and tsunami warnings, high winds, and cyclones.

It is normal practice to broadcast the Sécurité call itself on a distress and listening frequency such as VHF Channel 16 or MF 2182 kHz, and then change frequency to a working channel for the body of the messages. An equivalent Morse code signal is TTT, with each letter sent distinctly.

Although mostly used by coast radio stations, there is nothing to stop individual craft broadcasting their own Sécurité messages where appropriate, for example, a yacht becalmed (rendered motionless for lack of wind), or any vessel adrift or unable to manoeuvre near other craft or shipping lanes.

==Mayday, pan-pan, sécurité==
Of the three distress and urgency calls, Sécurité is the least urgent.

Sécurité: A radio call that usually issues navigational warnings, meteorological warnings, and any other warning needing to be issued that may concern the safety of life at sea, yet may not be particularly life-threatening. 

Pan-pan: This is the second most important call. This call is made when there is an emergency aboard a vessel, yet there is not immediate danger to life, or the safety of the vessel itself. This includes, but is not limited to injuries on deck, imminent collision that has not yet occurred, or being unsure of vessel&#x27;s position.

Mayday: This is the most important call that can be made, due to the fact that it directly concerns a threat to life or the vessel. Some instances when this call would be made are, but not limited to death, collision, and fire at sea. When the Mayday call is made, the vessel is requiring immediate assistance.

==Example usage==
 Third on the list of calls, a Safety or Sécurité call takes priority of all communications besides distress and urgency. The DSC safety alert should not be acknowledged by voice, but merely listened to and noted. The proper etiquette for sending a safety alert is as follows: first, the DSC safety alert must be sent on Channel 16 VHF or at 2182 kHz instead of using a working channel or frequency. Second, the targeted group must be selected, if necessary. This can be all ships, ships of a specific geographic area, or an individual ship. Lastly, the call should be made. GMDSS protocol requires that the safety call must be spoken to attract attention of the selected vessels. Procedure for the call is:

Without a break, continue on to the safety message:

<doc id="70935" wikidata="Q221911" url="?curid=70935" title="Parliamentary procedure">
<text>Parliamentary procedures are the accepted rules, ethics, and customs governing meetings of an assembly or organization. Their object is to allow orderly deliberation upon questions of interest to the organization and thus to arrive at the sense or the will of the majority of the assembly upon these questions. Self-governing organizations follow parliamentary procedure to debate and reach group decisions, usually by vote, with the least possible friction.

In the United Kingdom, Canada, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and other English-speaking countries, parliamentary procedure is often called &quot;chairmanship&quot;, &quot;chairing&quot;, the &quot;law of meetings&quot;, &quot;procedure at meetings&quot;, the &quot;conduct of meetings&quot;, or the &quot;standing orders&quot;. Erskine May&#x27;s &quot;Parliamentary Practice&quot; is used and often referred to as &quot;Erskine May&quot; in the United Kingdom, and influential in other countries that use the Westminster system. In the United States, terms used are &quot;parliamentary law&quot;, &quot;parliamentary practice&quot;, &quot;legislative procedure&quot;, &quot;rules of order&quot;, or &quot;Robert&#x27;s rules of order&quot;.

Rules of order consist of rules written by the body itself (often referred to as bylaws), usually supplemented by a published parliamentary authority adopted by the body. Typically, national, state, or provincial, and other full-scale legislative assemblies have extensive internally-written rules of order, whereas non-legislative bodies write and adopt a limited set of specific rules as the need arises.

==History==

The term &quot;parliamentary procedure&quot; gets its name from its use in the parliamentary system of government.

In the 16th and 17th century, the parliaments of England began adopting rules of order. In the 1560s, Sir Thomas Smyth began the process of writing down accepted procedures and published a book about them for the House of Commons in 1583. Early rules included:
* One subject should be discussed at a time (adopted 1581)
* Personal attacks are to be avoided in debate (1604)
* Debate must be limited to the merits of the question (1610)
* Division of a question into parts to be voted on separately (1640)

===Westminster procedures===
The Westminster parliamentary procedures are followed in several Commonwealth countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, and South Africa, as well as in the Republic of Ireland.

In Canada, for example, the House of Commons uses &quot;House of Commons Procedure and Practice&quot; as its primary procedural authority. Others include Arthur Beauchesne&#x27;s &quot;Parliamentary Rules and Forms of the House of Commons of Canada&quot;, Sir John George Bourinot&#x27;s &quot;Parliamentary Procedure and Practice in the Dominion of Canada&quot;, and Erskine May&#x27;s &quot;The Law, Privileges, Proceedings and Usage of Parliament&quot; from Britain.

===American procedures===
The rules of the United States Congress were developed from parliamentary procedures used in Britain. Many nations&#x27; legislatures follow American parliamentary procedure, including Indonesia, the Philippines, Mexico and South Korea.

===Other===
The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (1957) states that each of the European Parliament, Council of the European Union, and European Commission adopt their own rules. For the Parliament, these are the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament.

The procedures of the Diet of Japan moved away from the British parliamentary model, when in Occupied Japan, there were efforts to align Japanese parliamentary procedures with American congressional practices. In Japan, informal negotiations are more important than formal procedures.

In Italy, written rules govern the Houses of the Parliament. The Constitutional Court judges the limits beyond which these regulations cannot go, exceeding the parliamentary or political function (judgement n. 120 of 2014) and on their bad application when a law is passed.

==Parliamentary authority usage patterns==

Parliamentary procedure is based on the principles of allowing the majority to make decisions effectively and efficiently (majority rule), while ensuring fairness towards the minority and giving each member or delegate the right to voice an opinion. Voting determines the will of the assembly. While each assembly may create their own set of rules, these sets tend to be more alike than different. A common practice is to adopt a standard reference book on parliamentary procedure and modify it through special rules of order that supersede the adopted authority.

A parliamentary structure conducts business through motions, which cause actions. Members bring business before the assembly by introducing main motions. &quot;Members use subsidiary motions to alter a main motion, or delay or hasten its consideration.&quot; Parliamentary procedure also allows for rules in regards to nomination, voting, debate, disciplinary action, appeals, and the drafting of organization charters, constitutions, and bylaws.

===Organizations and civic groups===
In the US &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order Newly Revised&quot; aspires to be a comprehensive guide, based on the original 1876 version written primarily to help guide voluntary associations in their operations of governance: &quot;New editions have marked the growth of parliamentary procedure as cases occurring in assemblies have pointed to a need for further rules or additional interpretations to go by.&quot; &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order The Modern Edition&quot; and &quot;The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure&quot; aspire to be concise. &quot;This book is a basic reference book but does not claim to be comprehensive. For most organization and for most meetings, it will prove very adequate.&quot; &quot;Alice Sturgis believed that confusing or unnecessary motions and terminology should be eliminated. Her goal was to make the process simpler, fairer, and easier to understand, and The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure did just that ...&quot;

A common text in use in the UK, particularly within trade unions, is Walter Citrine&#x27;s &quot;ABC of Chairmanship&quot;.

In English-speaking Canada, popular authorities include Kerr &amp; King&#x27;s &quot;Procedures for Meeting and Organizations&quot;. The Conservative Party of Canada uses &quot;Wainberg&#x27;s Society meetings including rules of order&quot; to run its internal affairs.

In French-speaking Canada, commonly used rules of order for ordinary societies include Victor Morin&#x27;s (commonly known as the ) and the .

===Legislatures===
Legislative assemblies in all countries, because of their nature, tend to have a specialized set of rules that differ from parliamentary procedure used by clubs and organizations.

In the United Kingdom, Erskine May&#x27;s &quot;Parliamentary Practice&quot; (frequently updated; originally &quot;Treatise on the Law, Privileges, Proceedings and Usage of Parliament&quot;; often referred to simply as &quot;Erskine May&quot;) is the accepted authority on the powers and procedures of the Westminster parliament. There are also the Standing Orders for each House.

Of the 99 state legislative chambers in the United States (two for each state except Nebraska, which has a unicameral legislature), &quot;Mason&#x27;s Manual of Legislative Procedure&quot; governs parliamentary procedures in 70; &quot;Jefferson&#x27;s Manual&quot; governs 13, and &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order&quot; governs four. The United States Senate follows the Standing Rules of the United States Senate, while the United States House of Representatives follows &quot;Jefferson&#x27;s Manual&quot;.

&quot;Mason&#x27;s Manual&quot;, originally written by constitutional scholar and former California Senate staff member Paul Mason in 1935, and since his death revised and published by the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL), governs legislative procedures in instances where the state constitution, state statutes, and the chamber&#x27;s rules are silent.

According to the NCSL, one of the many reasons that most state legislatures use &quot;Mason&#x27;s Manual&quot; instead of &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order&quot; is that &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules&quot; applies best to private organizations and civic groups that do not meet in daily public sessions. &quot;Mason&#x27;s Manual&quot;, however, is geared specifically toward state legislative bodies.

==Parliamentarians in the United States==
In the United States, individuals who are proficient in parliamentary procedure are called parliamentarians (in countries with parliamentary governments the term refers to a member of Parliament).

Several organizations offer certification programs for parliamentarians, including the National Association of Parliamentarians and American Institute of Parliamentarians. Agriculture teachers who coach teams in the parliamentary procedure contest of the National FFA Organization (formerly Future Farmers of America) can earn the title Accredited Parliamentarian. Parliamentarians perform an important role in many meetings, including counseling organizations on parliamentary law, holding elections, or writing amendments to the constitution and bylaws of an organization.

<doc id="70938" wikidata="Q16296" url="?curid=70938" title="Patrick Stewart">
<text>Sir Patrick Stewart (born 13 July 1940) is an English actor. With a career spanning over seven decades of stage and screen, he has received various accolades, including two Laurence Olivier Awards and a Grammy Award, as well as nominations for a Tony Award, three Golden Globe Awards, four Emmy Awards, and three Screen Actors Guild Awards. He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1996 and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for services to drama in 2010.

In 1966, Stewart became a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company. He made his Broadway theatre debut in 1971 in a production of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. In 1979, he received the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his performance in &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; in the West End. His first television role was in &quot;Coronation Street&quot; in 1967. His first major screen roles were in &quot;Fall of Eagles&quot; (1974), &quot;I, Claudius&quot; (1976) and &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot; (1979). In 2008 he reprised his role as King Claudius in &quot;Hamlet&quot; and received his second Olivier Award and his first Tony Award nomination for respectively the West End and Broadway theatre productions.

Stewart gained international stardom for his leading role as Captain Jean-Luc Picard in &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; (1987–1994), a role he reprised in a series of films and &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot; (2020–2023). He starred as Captain Ahab in the USA miniseries &quot;Moby Dick&quot; (1998), Ebenezer Scrooge in TNT television film &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; (1999) and King Henry II in the Showtime made-for-television film &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot; (2003). He also became known for his comedic appearances on sitcoms &quot;Frasier&quot; and &quot;Extras&quot; for which he received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series nomination. He also starred as the lead of &quot;Blunt Talk&quot; (2015–2016). He voices CIA executive Avery Bullock on &quot;American Dad!&quot;. 

Stewart&#x27;s first film role was in Trevor Nunn&#x27;s &quot;Hedda&quot; (1975) followed by roles in John Boorman&#x27;s &quot;Excalibur&quot; (1981) and David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot; (1984). He gained further stardom when he portrayed Professor Charles Xavier in the &quot;X-Men&quot; film series (2000–2014), reprising the role in &quot;Logan&quot; (2017) and &quot;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&quot; (2022). He has acted in films including &quot;L.A. Story&quot; (1991), &quot;Robin Hood: Men in Tights&quot; (1993), &quot;Jeffrey&quot; (1995) and &quot;The Kid Who Would Be King&quot; (2019). He has also voiced roles in &quot;The Pagemaster&quot; (1994), &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot; (1998), &quot;Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius&quot; (2001), &quot;Chicken Little&quot; (2005), &quot;Gnomeo &amp; Juliet&quot; (2011) and &quot;Ted&quot; (2012). 
==Early life and education ==
Patrick Stewart was born in Mirfield in the West Riding of Yorkshire on 13 July 1940, the son of Gladys (née Barrowclough), a weaver and textile worker, and Alfred Stewart (1905–1980), a regimental sergeant major in the British Army Parachute Regiment during the Second World War who later worked as a general labourer and postman. He has two older brothers named Geoffrey (born 1925) and Trevor (born 1935). He spent much of his childhood in a poor household in Mirfield, where he experienced domestic violence at the hands of his father. As a result of wartime service during the Dunkirk evacuation, his father suffered from combat fatigue, which is now known as PTSD. Stewart said in 2008, &quot;My father was a very potent individual, a very powerful man, who got what he wanted. It was said that when he strode onto the parade ground, birds stopped singing. It was many, many years before I realised how my father inserted himself into my work. I&#x27;ve grown a moustache for &quot;Macbeth&quot;. My father didn&#x27;t have one, but when I looked in the mirror just before I went on stage I saw my father&#x27;s face staring straight back at me.&quot;

Stewart attended Crowlees Junior and Infant School, a Church of England–affiliated school in Mirfield. He later attributed his acting career to his English teacher there, Cecil Dormand, who &quot;put a copy of Shakespeare in [Stewart&#x27;s] hand&quot; and told him to get up and perform. He entered Mirfield Secondary Modern School in 1951, aged 11, and continued to study drama there. Around the same time, he met and befriended fellow actor Brian Blessed on a drama course in Mytholmroyd. At the age of 15, he left school and increased his participation in local theatre. He supported himself with work as a newspaper reporter and obituary writer for the local newspaper, but quit after one year when his boss gave him an ultimatum to choose acting or journalism. According to one of his brothers, Stewart would attend theatre rehearsals when he was supposed to be in work and then invent the stories he was reporting on, or persuade other reporters to cover for him. Stewart got a job in a furniture store, that not only allowed him to attend rehearsals with little scheduling conflict, but he also found that his thespian talent was applicable, resulting him in becoming productive in sales while practising his acting technique by tailoring his sales pitch for each customer. He also trained in boxing. He has said that acting served as a means of self-expression in his youth. Stewart and Blessed later received grants to attend the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School. Stewart was the first person who was neither a graduate of Oxford nor Cambridge to receive a grant from West Riding Council.

==Career==
===Early acting career (1959–1987)===
Stewart&#x27;s first professional stage appearance was on 19 May 1959 at the Theatre Royal, Bristol (for the Bristol Old Vic Company), playing Cutpurse (a thief among the audience for the play-within-a-play) in &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot;, directed by John Hale. Following a period with Manchester&#x27;s Library Theatre, Stewart became a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1966, remaining with them until 1982. He was an associate artist of the company in 1967. He appeared with actors such as Ben Kingsley and Ian Richardson. In January 1967, he made his debut TV appearance on &quot;Coronation Street&quot; as a fire officer. In 1969, he had a brief TV cameo role as Horatio, opposite Ian Richardson&#x27;s Hamlet, in a performance of the gravedigger scene as part of episode six of Sir Kenneth Clark&#x27;s &quot;Civilisation&quot; television series. During the early 1970s, UCSB professor Homer Swander recruited him to help teach American university students about Shakespeare, which led to his breakthrough into Hollywood. He made his Broadway debut as Snout in Peter Brook&#x27;s legendary 1970 production of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream,&quot; then moved to the Royal National Theatre in the early 1980s. 

Over the years, Stewart took roles in many major television series without ever becoming a household name. He appeared as Vladimir Lenin in &quot;Fall of Eagles&quot;; Sejanus in &quot;I, Claudius&quot;; Karla in &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot; and &quot;Smiley&#x27;s People&quot;; Claudius in a 1980 BBC adaptation of &quot;Hamlet&quot;. He took the romantic male lead in the 1975 BBC adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell&#x27;s &quot;North and South&quot;. He also took the lead, as psychiatric consultant Dr Edward Roebuck, in BBC&#x27;s &quot;Maybury&quot; in 1981. He continued to play minor roles in films, such as King Leondegrance in John Boorman&#x27;s &quot;Excalibur&quot; (1981), the character Gurney Halleck in David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot; (1984), Dr. Armstrong in Tobe Hooper&#x27;s &quot;Lifeforce&quot; (1985) and Henry Grey in &quot;Lady Jane&quot; (1986), the story of English Queen Lady Jane Grey.

Stewart preferred classical theatre to other genres, asking &quot;Doctor Who&quot; actress Lalla Ward why she would work in science fiction or on television. In 1987, he nonetheless agreed to work in Hollywood on a revival of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, after Robert H. Justman saw him while attending a literary reading at UCLA. Stewart knew nothing about the cultural influence of Star Trek or its iconic status in American culture. He was reluctant to sign the standard contract of six years, but did so as he, his agent, and others with whom Stewart consulted, all believed the new show would quickly fail, and that he would return to his London stage career after making some money. Regardless, Stewart&#x27;s trusted colleague, Ian McKellen, was particularly vocal in advising Stewart not to throw away his theatrical career for this foray into television, which Stewart had to disregard considering the opportunity. While in Hollywood, he spent 18 months using the professional name &quot;Patrick Hewes Stewart&quot; while negotiating the rights to his original name from an American actor who had already registered it with the Screen Actors Guild.

===Film and TV career (1987–present)===
====&quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;====

When Stewart was picked for the role of Captain Jean-Luc Picard in &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; (1987–1994), the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called him an &quot;unknown British Shakespearean actor&quot;. Still living out of his suitcase because of his scepticism that the show would succeed, he was unprepared for the long schedule of television production that began at 4:45 am each day. He initially experienced difficulty fitting in with his less-disciplined castmates. In interviews, he recalled with embarrassment a time when he scolded the main cast for being unprofessional in his opinion, by saying &quot;We&#x27;re not here... to have fun!&quot; Furthermore, Stewart has stated that his &quot;spirits used to sink&quot; whenever he was required to memorise and recite technobabble. He eventually came to better understand the cultural differences between the stage and television and relaxed to a degree at work, and his favourite technical line became &quot;spacetime continuum&quot;. 

Stewart remained close friends with his fellow &quot;Star Trek&quot; actors and became their advocate with the producers when necessary. Marina Sirtis credited Stewart with &quot;at least 50%, if not more&quot; of the show&#x27;s success because others imitated his professionalism and dedication to acting. Jonathan Frakes said that, with some shows he&#x27;d been on, there were actors who showed up without having read the script, but Stewart had &quot;set such a high bar for preparation. We all came to work in the morning completely prepared. We knew our lines and had broken down the script&quot;.

Stewart unexpectedly became wealthy because of the show&#x27;s success. In 1992, during a break in filming, Stewart calculated that he earned more during that break than from 10 weeks of &quot;Woolf&quot; in London. From 1994 to 2002, he also portrayed Picard in the films &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot; (1994), &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot; (1996), &quot;Star Trek: Insurrection&quot; (1998) and &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot; (2002); and in &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;″s pilot episode &quot;Emissary&quot;, and received a 1995 Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for &quot;Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series&quot;.

When asked in 2011 for the highlight of his career, he chose &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, because &quot;it changed everything [for me].&quot; He has also said he is very proud of his work on &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; for its social messages and educational impact on young viewers. When questioned about his role&#x27;s significance compared to his distinguished Shakespearean career, he said, &quot;The fact is all of those years in Royal Shakespeare Company—playing all those kings, emperors, princes and tragic heroes—were nothing but preparation for sitting in the captain&#x27;s chair of the Enterprise.&quot; The accolades he has received include the readers of &quot;TV Guide&quot; in 1992 choosing him with Cindy Crawford, of whom he had never heard, as television&#x27;s &quot;most bodacious&quot; man and woman. In an interview with Michael Parkinson, he expressed gratitude for Gene Roddenberry&#x27;s response to a reporter who said, &quot;Surely they would have cured baldness by the 24th century,&quot; to which Roddenberry replied, &quot;In the 24th century, they wouldn&#x27;t care.&quot;


On 4 August 2018, CBS and Stewart jointly announced that he would reprise his role as Jean-Luc Picard in a new &quot;Star Trek&quot; series. In a prepared statement, Stewart said he and the new show&#x27;s producers would &quot;endeavour to bring a fresh, unexpected and pertinent story to life once more.&quot;

====&quot;X-Men&quot; film series====
The success of the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; TV and film franchises typecast Stewart as Picard and obtaining other roles became difficult. He also found returning to the stage difficult because of his long absence. He commented that he would never have joined &quot;The Next Generation&quot; had he known that it would air for seven years: &quot;No, no. NO. And looking back now it still frightens me a little bit to think that so much of my life was totally devoted to Star Trek and almost nothing else.&quot;
However, in the late 1990s he accepted a key role in the big-budget &quot;X-Men&quot; film series, as Professor Charles Xavier, founder and mentor of the superhero team, a role similar in many ways to Picard. He was initially reluctant to sign on to another movie franchise, but his interest in working with director Bryan Singer persuaded him. In addition, Stewart was joined by Ian McKellen, who had by then conceded that his friend had made a prudent choice performing in popular screen science fiction, who played Xavier&#x27;s friend and ideological nemesis, the supervillain Magneto. Stewart has played the role in seven feature films (&quot;X-Men&quot;, &quot;X2&quot;, &quot;X-Men: The Last Stand&quot;, &quot;X-Men Origins: Wolverine&quot;, &quot;The Wolverine&quot;, &quot;X-Men: Days of Future Past&quot; and &quot;Logan&quot;) and voiced the role in several video games (&quot;X-Men Legends&quot;, &quot;X-Men Legends II&quot;, and &quot;X-Men: Next Dimension&quot;). Stewart announced that he would be leaving the &quot;X-Men&quot; film franchise after &quot;Logan&quot;.

In 2022, Stewart portrayed Professor Xavier of Earth-838 in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.&quot;

====Documentaries====
In 2011, Stewart appeared in the feature-length documentary &quot;The Captains&quot; alongside William Shatner (who played &quot;Star Trek&quot; Captain James Kirk) – Shatner also wrote and directed the film. In the film, Shatner interviews actors who have portrayed captains within the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. The film pays a great deal of attention to Shatner&#x27;s interviews with Stewart at his home in Oxfordshire, as well as at a &quot;Star Trek&quot; Convention in Las Vegas, Nevada; Stewart reveals the fear and personal failings that came along with his tenure as a Starfleet captain, and also the great triumphs he believes accompanied his role as Picard. In 2016, he narrated &quot;Connected Universe&quot;, a crowdfunded documentary film directed by Malcolm Carter on the ideas of self-styled physicist Nassim Haramein.

====Other film and television====

Stewart&#x27;s other film and television roles include the flamboyantly gay Sterling in the 1995 film &quot;Jeffrey&quot; and King Henry II in &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot;, for which he received a Golden Globe Award nomination for his performance and an Emmy Award nomination for executive-producing the film. He portrayed Captain Ahab in the 1998 made-for-television film version of &quot;Moby Dick&quot;, receiving an Emmy Award nomination and Golden Globe Award nomination for his performance. He starred in the 1998 film &quot;Safe House&quot;. He also starred as Scrooge in a 1999 television film version of Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, receiving a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for his performance.

In late 2003, during the 11th and final season of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Frasier&quot;, Stewart appeared on the show as a gay Seattle socialite and opera director, who mistakes Frasier for a potential lover. In July 2003, he appeared in Series 2 (Episode 09) of &quot;Top Gear&quot; in the Star in a Reasonably-Priced Car segment, achieving a time of 1:50 in the Liana. In 2005, he was cast as Professor Ian Hood in an ITV thriller 4-episode series &quot;Eleventh Hour&quot;, created by Stephen Gallagher. The first episode was broadcast on 19 January 2006. He also, in 2005, played Captain Nemo in a two-part adaptation of &quot;The Mysterious Island&quot;. Stewart also appeared as a nudity-obsessed caricature of himself in Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant&#x27;s television series &quot;Extras&quot;. He played John Bosley in the 2019 action comedy film &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, released on 15 November.

He also was a voice actor on the animated films &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot;, &quot;Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius&quot;, &quot;Chicken Little&quot;, &quot;The Pagemaster&quot;, &quot;The Emoji Movie&quot;, &quot;Dragon Rider&quot;, the English dubbings of the Japanese anime films &quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind&quot;, by Hayao Miyazaki, and &quot;Steamboy&quot;, by Katsuhiro Otomo. He supported his home town of Dewsbury in West Yorkshire by lending his voice to a series of videos on the town in 1999. He voiced the pig Napoleon in a made-for-TV film adaptation of George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Animal Farm&quot; and guest starred in the &quot;Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Homer the Great&quot; as Number One. Stewart also recorded a narration planned for the prologue and epilogue for Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; but the final movie used another voice (the original narration appears only on the first edition of the film&#x27;s soundtrack). He plays a recurring role as CIA Deputy Director Avery Bullock, lending his likeness as well as his voice on the animated series &quot;American Dad!&quot;. He has also made several guest appearances on &quot;Family Guy&quot; in various roles. Stewart also appears as narrator in Seth MacFarlane&#x27;s 2012 film directorial debut, &quot;Ted&quot;. In 2006, Stewart voiced Bambi&#x27;s father, the Great Prince of the Forest, in Disney&#x27;s direct-to-video sequel &quot;Bambi II&quot;.

===Theatre (1990–present)===
After &quot;The Next Generation&quot; began, Stewart soon found that he missed acting on the stage. Although he remained associated with the Royal Shakespeare Company, the lengthy filming for the series had prevented him from participating in most other works, leaving a &quot;gaping hole&quot; of many years in his CV as a Shakespearean actor, causing him to miss opportunities to play such notable roles as Hamlet, Romeo, and Richard III. Instead, Stewart began writing one-man shows that he performed in California universities and acting schools. One of these—a version of Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; in which he portrayed all 40-plus characters—became ideal for him as an actor as well, because of its limited performing schedule.
In 1991, Stewart performed it on Broadway, receiving a nomination for that year&#x27;s Drama Desk Award for Outstanding One-Person Show. He staged encore Broadway performances in 1992 and 1994, with the 1993 run held in London and the 1996 production in Los Angeles. Stewart brought the show back to Broadway in 2001, with all proceeds going to charity – and the show of 28 December&#x27;s revenue, specifically, going to the 11 September campaign of the Actors Fund of America. A 23-day run re-opened in London&#x27;s West End in December 2005. For his performances in this play, Stewart has received the Drama Desk Award for Best Solo Performance in 1992 and the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Entertainment for Solo Performance in 1994. He was also the co-producer of the show, through the company he set up for the purpose: Camm Lane Productions, a reference to his birthplace in Camm Lane, Mirfield.
Shakespeare roles during this period included Prospero in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;, on Broadway in 1995, a role he would reprise in Rupert Goold&#x27;s 2006 production of &quot;The Tempest&quot; as part of the Royal Shakespeare Company&#x27;s Complete Works Festival. In 1997, he took the role of Othello with the Shakespeare Theatre Company (Washington, D.C.) in a &quot;photo negative&quot; production of a white &quot;Othello&quot; with an otherwise all-black cast. Stewart had wanted to play the title role since the age of 14, so he and director Jude Kelly inverted the play so Othello became a comment on a white man entering a black society.

He played Antony again opposite Harriet Walter&#x27;s Cleopatra in &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; at the Novello Theatre in London in 2007 to excellent reviews. During this period, Stewart also addressed the Durham Union Society on his life in film and theatre. When Stewart began playing Macbeth in the West End in 2007, some said that he was too old for the role; he and the show again received excellent reviews, with one critic calling Stewart &quot;one of our finest Shakespearean actors&quot;. He was named as the next Cameron Mackintosh Visiting Professor of Contemporary Theatre based at St Catherine&#x27;s College, Oxford in January 2007. In 2008, Stewart played King Claudius in &quot;Hamlet&quot; alongside David Tennant. He won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Supporting Actor for the part. When collecting his award, he dedicated the award &quot;in part&quot; to Tennant and Tennant&#x27;s understudy Edward Bennett, after Tennant&#x27;s back injury and subsequent absence from four weeks of &quot;Hamlet&quot; disqualified him from an Olivier nomination.

In 2009, Stewart appeared alongside Ian McKellen as the lead duo of Vladimir (Didi) and Estragon (Gogo), in &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;. Stewart had previously appeared only once alongside McKellen on stage, but the pair had developed a close friendship while waiting around on set filming the &quot;X-Men&quot; films. Stewart stated that performing in this play was the fulfilment of a 50-year ambition, having seen Peter O&#x27;Toole appear in it at the Bristol Old Vic while Stewart was just 17. Reviewers stated that his interpretation captured well the balance between humour and despair that characterises the work. 

In 2014, Stewart and McKellen appeared on Broadway with two alternating productions, &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; and &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot;. To promote the plays, Stewart and McKellen, acted on Stewart&#x27;s wife&#x27;s suggestion to tour New York City in a Twitter campaign in which the actors would take playful photographs of themselves visiting various tourist locations on their days off while wearing their &quot;Godot&quot; characters&#x27; bowler hats. Although the plays&#x27; marketing department disapproved of the idea, the actors proceeded with the inexpensive publicity campaign, which proved a major success. Furthermore, this campaign changed Stewart&#x27;s image as a serious actor by emphasising his sense of humour, which led to frequent guest appearances in various comedy programs.

Stewart has been a prolific actor in performances by the Royal Shakespeare Company, appearing in more than 60 productions. His first appearance was in 1966 in &quot;The Investigation&quot; and in the years that followed he became a core member of the company, taking on three or four major roles each season. On 18 November 2012, Stewart appeared on stage at St Martin&#x27;s Theatre in the West End for a 60th anniversary performance of Agatha Christie&#x27;s &quot;The Mousetrap&quot;, the world&#x27;s longest-running play.

===Voice work===

Known for his strong and authoritative voice, Stewart has lent his voice to a number of projects. He has narrated recordings of Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot; (winning a Grammy), Vivaldi&#x27;s &quot;The Four Seasons&quot; (which had also been narrated by William Shatner), C. S. Lewis&#x27;s &quot;The Last Battle&quot; (conclusion of the series &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;), Rick Wakeman&#x27;s &quot;Return to the Centre of the Earth&quot;; as well as numerous TV programmes such as &quot;High Spirits with Shirley Ghostman&quot;. Stewart provided the narration for &quot;Nine Worlds&quot;, an astronomical tour of the Solar System and nature documentaries such as &quot;The Secret of Life on Earth&quot; and &quot;Mountain Gorilla&quot;. He is heard as the voice of the Magic Mirror in Disneyland&#x27;s live show, &quot;Snow White – An Enchanting Musical&quot;. He also was the narrator for the American release of &quot;&quot;. He is narrator for two fulldome video shows produced and distributed by Loch Ness Productions, called &quot;MarsQuest&quot; and &quot;The Voyager Encounters&quot;.

He lent his voice to the Activision-produced &quot;Star Trek&quot; computer games &quot;Star Trek: Armada&quot;, &quot;Armada II&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: Starfleet Command III&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: Invasion&quot;, &quot;Bridge Commander&quot;, and &quot;Elite Force II&quot;, all reprising his role as Picard. Stewart reprised his role as Picard in &quot;Star Trek: Legacy&quot; for both PC and Xbox 360, along with the four other major Starfleet captains from the different Star Trek series.

In addition to voicing his characters from &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;X-Men&quot; in several related computer and video games, Stewart worked as a voice actor on games unrelated to both franchises, such as &quot;&quot;, &quot;Forgotten Realms: Demon Stone&quot;, &quot;Lands of Lore: The Throne of Chaos&quot; and &quot;The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion&quot; for which in 2006 he won a Spike TV Video Game Award for his work as Emperor Uriel Septim. He also lent his voice to several editions of the &quot;Compton&#x27;s Interactive Encyclopedia&quot;.

His voice talents also appeared in a number of commercials including the UK TV adverts for the relaunch of TSB Bank, Domestos bleach and Moneysupermarket.com, an advertisement for Shell fuel and an American advertisement for the prescription drug Crestor. He also voiced the UK and Australian TV advertisements for the PAL version of &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot;.

Stewart used his voice for Pontiac and Porsche cars and MasterCard Gold commercials in 1996, and Goodyear Assurance Tyres in 2004. He also did voice-overs for RCA televisions. He provided the voice of Max Winters in &quot;TMNT&quot; in March 2007. In 2008, he was also the voice of television advertisements for Currys and Stella Artois beer. Currently, he is heard during National Car Rental television spots.

He voiced the narrator of the Electronic Arts computer game, &quot;The Sims Medieval&quot;, for the game&#x27;s cinematic introduction and trailer released on 22 March 2011. He also voiced the story plaques and trailer of the MMOG &quot;LEGO Universe&quot; and the narrator of &quot;My Memory Of Us&quot;.

==Acting credits==
==Awards and honours==
In 2004, Stewart was appointed chancellor of the University of Huddersfield and subsequently as a professor of performing arts in July 2008. In these roles, Stewart has regularly attended graduation ceremonies in the UK and Hong Kong and teaches master classes for drama students. He stepped down from the chancellorship in July 2015, and was named chancellor emeritus in the installation ceremony for his successor, Prince Andrew, Duke of York. In August 2016 a building at the university was renamed the &quot;Sir Patrick Stewart Building&quot;.
On 16 December 1996, Patrick Stewart received a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7021 Hollywood Blvd. In 1993, &quot;TV Guide&quot; named him the Best Dramatic Television Actor of the 1980s. Stewart was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2001 New Year Honours for services to acting and the cinema and a Knight Bachelor in the 2010 New Year Honours for services to drama. Stewart&#x27;s knighthood was conferred by Queen Elizabeth II at an investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace on 2 June 2010. Stewart carried the Olympic torch in July 2012 as part of the official relay for the 2012 London Summer Olympics and stated it was an experience he &quot;will never forget&quot;, adding that it was better than any movie premiere. In a 2018 poll for Yorkshire Day, Stewart was ranked the third greatest Yorkshireman ever behind Monty Python comedian Michael Palin and fellow actor Sean Bean. 

In July 2001, Stewart received an honorary fellowship from the University of Wales, Cardiff. In 2011, he received an honorary doctorate of letters (D.Litt.) from the University of East Anglia. In July 2014, he received a D.Litt. from the University of Leeds. In May 2015, Stewart received an honorary doctorate (Dr.h.c.) from the Vrije Universiteit Brussel. He is an emeritus fellow of St Catherine&#x27;s College, Oxford.

From 2017 until 2021, Stewart shared with Hugh Jackman the Guinness World Record for the longest career as a live-action Marvel Comics superhero for his portrayal of Professor X; they were subsequently eclipsed by Tobey Maguire and Willem Dafoe. In 2022, Stewart retook the record by appearing as the character in &quot;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&quot;, but was once again eclipsed by Wesley Snipes in 2024.

==Charity work and activism==
In 2006, Stewart made a short video against domestic violence for Amnesty International, in which he recollected his father&#x27;s physical attacks on his mother and the effect it had on him as a child. He said, &quot;The physical harm ... [was] a shocking pain. But there are other aspects of violence which have more lasting impact psychologically on family members. It is destructive and tainting. As a child witnessing these events, one cannot simply help somehow feeling responsible for them; for the pain, and the screaming, and the misery.&quot; In the same year, he gave his name to a scholarship at the University of Huddersfield, where he was Chancellor (2004–2015), to fund post-graduate study into domestic violence. Stewart&#x27;s childhood experience also led him to become a patron of Refuge, a UK charity for abused women.

In 2009, Stewart gave a speech at the launch of &quot;Created Equal,&quot; a book about women&#x27;s rights, talking again about his personal experiences with domestic violence and the impacts they had on him. He said, &quot;Violence is a choice, and it&#x27;s a choice a man makes ... the lasting impact on my mother ... and indeed on myself ... was extreme. Overcoming the lessons of that male stereotype that I was being shown was a struggle.&quot; He now hopes to set an example of &quot;what it has been like to be in an environment of such violence and that it can pass and that one can survive it and even though sometimes still a struggle.&quot; Additionally, in October 2011, he presented a BBC Lifeline Appeal on behalf of Refuge, discussing his own experience of domestic violence and interviewing a woman whose daughter was murdered by her ex-husband.

Stewart has supported the armed forces charity Combat Stress since learning about his father&#x27;s post-traumatic stress disorder when researching his family genealogy for the documentary series &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; He is a patron of the United Nations Association – UK, and delivered a speech at UNA-UK&#x27;s UN Forum 2012 on Saturday 14 July 2012, speaking of his father&#x27;s experiences in the Second World War, and how he believed the UN was the best legacy of that period.

On 15 April 2018 Stewart attended the launch event of the People&#x27;s Vote, a campaign group calling for a public vote on the final Brexit deal between the UK and the European Union.

In 2019, he acted as an International Rescue Committee spokesperson.

Stewart is an avid advocate for pit bulls. He has fostered several dogs through Wags and Walks, a dog rescue in Los Angeles, and was honoured at the rescue&#x27;s annual gala in 2018. He partnered with the ASPCA in 2017 for their National Dog Fighting Awareness Day Campaign. He frequently tweets pictures of himself with his foster dogs. In 2021, the ASPCA gave him their Pit Bull Advocate &amp; Protector Award.

==Personal life==

===Relationships and children===
Stewart married his first wife, Sheila Falconer, in 1966; they divorced in 1990. Together, they have a son, Daniel, and a daughter, Sophia. Daniel is also an actor, and appeared alongside his father in the film &quot;Death Train&quot;, the sitcom &quot;Blunt Talk&quot;, and the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;The Inner Light&quot;, playing his son in the latter.

In 1997, Stewart became engaged to American producer Wendy Neuss, one of the producers of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;. They married on 25 August 2000 and divorced three years later. Four months before his divorce from Neuss, Stewart co-starred with English actress Lisa Dillon in a production of &quot;The Master Builder&quot;, and the two were romantically involved until 2007.

In 2008, Stewart began dating American singer and songwriter Sunny Ozell, whom he met while performing in &quot;Macbeth&quot; at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. He purchased a home in Brooklyn&#x27;s Park Slope neighbourhood in August 2012, and subsequently began living there with Ozell. In March 2013, it was reported that they were engaged, and they married in September 2013 with Ian McKellen officiating. In 2020, Stewart revealed that his marriage to Ozell in Nevada had not been legally binding because McKellen&#x27;s marriage credentials were not valid in Nevada. The couple subsequently held an impromptu and official second ceremony with McKellen at a Mexican restaurant in Los Angeles shortly after the Nevada ceremony.

===Beliefs, causes, and interests===
Stewart has stated that his politics are rooted in a belief in &quot;fairness&quot; and &quot;equality&quot;. He considers himself a socialist and is a member of the Labour Party. He stated, &quot;My father was a very strong trade unionist and those fundamental issues of Labour were ingrained into me.&quot; He was critical of the Iraq War and UK government legislation in the area of civil liberties, in particular its plans to extend detention without charge to 42 days for terrorist suspects. He signed an open letter of objection to this proposal in March 2008. In August 2018 he was widely misquoted by the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; among others, who announced that he had left Labour owing to concerns over the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn. He posted on Twitter to confirm that he had been misquoted and denied that he had left the party. 

Stewart is an atheist and a patron of Humanists UK. He also identifies as a feminist. He has publicly advocated the right to assisted suicide. In January 2011, he became a patron of Dignity in Dying and campaigns for an assisted dying law in the UK.

In August 2014, Stewart was one of 200 public figures who signed a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September&#x27;s referendum on that issue. In 2016, Stewart was among more than 280 figures from the arts world who backed a vote to remain in the EU in the referendum on that issue.

On 2 March 2017, Stewart said he was going to apply for US citizenship to oppose the Trump administration. However, in an interview by the Press Association at the British Film Institute Luminous Fundraising Gala on 3 October 2017, he said that he hoped the US would pass stronger gun laws, but did not mention any intention of becoming an American citizen in furtherance of that hope.

Stewart is a lifelong supporter of his local football club Huddersfield Town A.F.C. He was at Wembley Stadium in 2017 when the club won promotion to the top division for the first time since 1972. Since 2010, he has been president of Huddersfield Town Academy, the club&#x27;s project for identifying and developing young talent.

In an interview with &quot;American Theatre&quot;, he said, &quot;From time to time, I have fantasies of becoming a concert pianist. I&#x27;ve been lucky enough through the years to work very closely with the great Emanuel Ax. I&#x27;ve said to him that if I could switch places with anyone it would be with him.&quot;

In 2015, Stewart defended the Belfast-based Christian bakers who were penalised for discrimination after refusing to bake a cake with words reading, &quot;Support Gay Marriage&quot;. Stewart, on his Facebook profile, said that while he was still opposed to organised religion, &quot;It was not because it was a gay couple that they objected, it was not because they were celebrating some sort of marriage or an agreement between them. It was the actual words on the cake they objected to. Because they found the words offensive. I would support their rights to say &#x27;No, this is personally offensive to my beliefs, I will not do it.&#x27;&quot; The Christian bakers ultimately won in a landmark Supreme Court decision for the United Kingdom, almost simultaneously with a similar case in the United States.

Stewart is an avid car enthusiast and is regularly seen at Silverstone during British Grand Prix weekends. He conducted the podium interview with the top three finishers in the 2017 Canadian Grand Prix. On a 2003 appearance on &quot;Top Gear&quot;, he set a lap time of 1 minute and 50 seconds on the &quot;Star in a Reasonably Priced Car&quot; feature. He holds a Motorsport UK competition licence and competed in the 2012 Silverstone Classic Celebrity Challenge race, finishing ninth, 3 m 02.808 s behind winner Kelvin Fletcher. In 2012, Stewart met his racing hero Stirling Moss for the BBC Two documentary &quot;Racing Legends&quot;.

Stewart is a fan of the animated television series &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;.

<text>Year 477 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of [[Gaius Horatius Pulvillus|Pulvillus]] and [[Agrippa Menenius Lanatus (consul 503 BC)|Lanatus]] (or, less frequently, year 277 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 477 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

<doc id="70947" wikidata="Q235238" url="?curid=70947" title="Henry the Young King">
<text>Henry the Young King (28 February 1155 – 11 June 1183) was the eldest son of Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine to survive childhood. In 1170, he became titular King of England, Duke of Normandy, Count of Anjou and Maine. Henry the Young King was the only English king since the Norman Conquest to be crowned during his father&#x27;s reign, but he was frustrated by his father&#x27;s refusal to grant him meaningful autonomous power. He died aged 28, six years before his father, during the course of a campaign in Limousin against his father and his brother Richard.

== Early life ==
Little is known of the young Henry before the events associated with his marriage and coronation. His mother&#x27;s children by her first marriage to Louis VII of France were Marie and Alix. He had one elder brother, William (d. 1156), and his younger siblings included Matilda, Richard, Geoffrey, Eleanor, Joan and John.

In June 1170, the fifteen-year-old Henry was crowned king during his father&#x27;s lifetime, a traditional practice of the French Capetian dynasty which held formal overlordship of Henry II&#x27;s continental domains. King Stephen had previously attempted to have his son Eustace crowned as early as 1143 but was unable to secure papal support. On the latter&#x27;s death in 1153, Stephen did not even attempt to have his second son William acknowledged as heir.

He was known in his own lifetime as &quot;Henry the Young King&quot; to distinguish him from his father. As he was not a reigning king, he is not counted in the numerical succession of kings of England. According to one of Thomas Becket&#x27;s correspondents, Henry was knighted by his father before the coronation, but the &quot;History of William Marshal&quot; asserts that the king was knighted by Marshal in the course of the rebellion of 1173.

== Tournament hero and celebrity ==
Henry did not appear to have been very interested in the day-to-day business of government, which distinguished him from his father and younger brothers. His father, however, is reputed to have failed to delegate authority to his son, retaining power in England. The majority opinion amongst historians is that of W. L. Warren: &quot;The Young Henry was the only member of the family who was popular in his own day ... also the only one who gave no evidence of political sagacity, military skill, or even ordinary intelligence...&quot;, and elaborated in a later book, &quot;He was gracious, benign, affable, courteous, the soul of liberality and generosity. Unfortunately, he was also shallow, vain, careless, empty-headed, incompetent, improvident, and irresponsible.&quot;

The Young King&#x27;s contemporary reputation, however, was positive. Likely this was due to the enthusiastic tournament culture of his time. In the &quot;History of William Marshal&quot;, the biography of the knight assigned to him as a tutor in 1170 and his tournament team leader until 1182, he is described as a constant competitor at tournaments across northern and central France between 1175 and 1182. With his cousins Counts Philip I of Flanders and Baldwin V of Hainaut, he was a key patron of the sport. He brought 200 knights to the tournament of Lagny-sur-Marne in November 1179, paying each 20 shillings a day.

Though he lacked political weight, his patronage brought him celebrity status throughout western Europe. The baron and troubadour Bertran de Born knew him, stating: 
There was a perception amongst his contemporaries, and the next generation, that his death in 1183 marked a decline both in the tournament and knightly endeavour. His one-time chaplain, Gervase of Tilbury, remarked on his passing: &quot;Assuredly, as he was a solace to the world while he lived, so it was a blow to all chivalry when he died in the very glow of youth.&quot;

The traditional view of Young Henry propagated into the modern era by Warren, has, however, been challenged in recent years. Matthew Strickland has argued in his compendium of the Young King&#x27;s life and career that he was, in fact, an able and likeable individual who merely grew frustrated at his father&#x27;s refusal to grant him any domains or responsibilities of his own.

== Political career ==
The young Henry played an important part in the politics of his father&#x27;s reign. On 2 November 1160, he was betrothed to Margaret of France, daughter of Louis VII of France and his second wife, Constance of Castile, when he was five years of age and she was at least two. The marriage was an attempt to finally settle the struggle between the counts of Anjou and the French kings over possession of the frontier district of the Norman Vexin, which Louis VII had acquired from Henry&#x27;s grandfather, Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou, in around 1144. By the terms of the settlement, Margaret would bring the castles of the Norman Vexin to her new husband. However, the marriage was pushed through by Henry II when Young Henry and Margaret were small children so that he could seize the castles. A bitter border war followed between the kings.

Henry II had toyed with the idea of having Young Henry crowned king as early as 1162 and even procured a papal bull from Alexander III ordering Archbishop Roger of York to crown Young Henry whenever required. Thomas Becket, newly ordained as Archbishop of Canterbury, had been ordered to prepare for the coronation of Young Henry and the pipe rolls for 1162 record the allocation of funds for the commissioning of a golden circlet. This was not to be, however; Barlow suggests that the southern prelates dissuaded King Henry II from using the papal bull as the Archbishopric of Canterbury was now occupied. This greatly upset Roger of York, who wrote to Rome asking for confirmation of his right to crown kings; while ultimately unsuccessful, Roger&#x27;s delays derailed Henry&#x27;s plans and the Young King would not be crowned until 1170.

Young Henry was finally crowned on Saturday 14 June 1170 on the feast of St Basil at Westminster Abbey, in the presence of most of the Anglo-Norman nobility and the overwhelming majority of the non-vacant English bishoprics. Matthew Strickland notes that the exiled Thomas Becket had few supporters left in the upper ranks of the English church after six years of dispute with Henry II.

It was almost certainly a calculated insult to Louis VII that Margaret of France was not crowned alongside her husband in 1170. Robert of Torigny argues she simply arrived from Normandy too late to participate, but other sources reveal she was deliberately delayed at Caen. Warren believes that this was an ultimately fruitful attempt to prevent Louis VII from dissuading Thomas Becket from accepting his latest overtures. Whatever the case, Louis was so enraged by this that he launched an immediate attack on the Norman border, forcing Henry to return to the duchy personally to oversee its defences. Mediation by Count Theobald of Blois, however, led to a meeting between the two monarchs at Vendôme and, following subsequent meetings at La Ferté and Fréteval, Henry was able to placate King Louis.

Young Henry and Margaret were formally married on 27 August 1172 at Winchester Cathedral, when Henry, aged seventeen, was crowned King of England a second time, this time together with Margaret, by Rotrou, the Archbishop of Rouen.

Young Henry fell out with his father in 1173. Contemporary chroniclers allege that this was owing to the young man&#x27;s frustration that his father had given him no realm to rule, and his feeling starved of funds. The rebellion seems, however, to have drawn strength from much deeper discontent with his father&#x27;s rule, and a formidable party of Anglo-Norman, Norman, Angevin, Poitevin and Breton magnates joined him. The revolt of 1173–1174 came close to toppling the king; he was narrowly saved by the loyalty of a party of nobles with holdings on the English side of the Channel and by the defeat and capture of William I, the King of Scotland. Young Henry sought a reconciliation after the capture of his mother, Eleanor of Aquitaine, and the failure of the rebellion. His funds were much increased by the terms of the settlement and he apparently devoted most of the next seven years to the amusement of the tournament.

In November 1179, he represented his father at the coronation of Philip Augustus as associate king of France at Reims. He acted as Steward of France and carried the crown in the coronation procession. Later, he played a leading role in the celebratory tournament held at Lagny-sur-Marne, to which he brought a retinue of over 500 knights at huge expense.

The Young Henry&#x27;s affairs took a turn for the worse in 1182. He fell out with William Marshal, the leader of his tournament &quot;mesnée&quot;. The unknown author of &quot;L&#x27;Histoire de Guillaume le Maréchal&quot; suggests that Marshal&#x27;s disgrace was because he had been falsely accused of a clandestine affair with Queen Margaret. David Crouch, one of the Marshal&#x27;s principal modern biographers, argues that the charge against William was actually one of &quot;lèse-majesté&quot;, brought on by Marshal&#x27;s own arrogance and greed. By this account, the charge of adultery was only introduced in the &quot;History of William Marshal&quot; as a distraction from the real charges, of which he was most probably guilty. Though the Young King sent his wife early in 1183 to the French court, it was done most likely to keep her safe in the impending war with his brother, Richard, rather than because she was in disgrace.

Margaret gave birth to a baby boy named William, who may have been born prematurely on 19 June 1177, and died only three days later.

== Death and burial ==
Henry the Young King died, aged 28, in the summer of 1183, during the course of a campaign in Limousin against his father and his brother Richard. He had just finished pillaging local monasteries to raise money to pay his mercenaries. He contracted dysentery at the beginning of June. Weakening fast, he was taken to Martel in Quercy. It was clear to his household that he was dying on 7 June, when he was confessed and received the last rites. 

As a token of his penitence for his war against his father, he prostrated himself naked on the floor before a crucifix. He made a testament and, since he had taken a crusader&#x27;s vow, he gave his cloak to his friend William Marshal, with the plea that he should take the cloak (presumably with the crusader&#x27;s cross stitched to it) to the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. 

On his deathbed, he reportedly asked to be reconciled to his father, but King Henry, fearing a trick, refused to see him. He died on 11 June, clasping a ring his father had sent instead as a sign of his forgiveness. After his death, his father is said to have exclaimed: &quot;He cost me much, but I wish he had lived to cost me more.&quot;

After Henry&#x27;s death, there was an attempt by his mother and a faction of his friends to promote his sainthood. Thomas of Earley, Archdeacon of Wells, published a sermon not long afterward detailing miraculous events attending the cortège that took his body north to Normandy. Henry had left orders that his entrails and other body parts should be buried at the abbey of Charroux, but the rest of his body should rest in Rouen Cathedral. 

However, during the funeral procession, a member of Henry&#x27;s household was seized by his mercenary captains for debts the late king had owed them. The knights accompanying his corpse were so penniless they had to be fed by charity at the monastery of Vigeois. There were large and emotional gatherings wherever his body rested. 

At Le Mans, the local bishop halted the procession and ordered the body buried in his cathedral, perhaps to help defuse the civil unrest Henry&#x27;s death had caused. The dean of Rouen recovered the body from the chapter of Le Mans a month later by a lawsuit so that the Young Henry could be buried in Normandy as he had desired in his testament. 

Henry&#x27;s remains are in Rouen Cathedral, where his tomb is on the opposite side of the altar from the tomb of the heart of his younger brother, Richard I of England, with whom he was perpetually quarrelling. The tomb of the Archbishop of Rouen, who had married him to Margaret, lies nearby in the ambulatory. His brothers Richard and John each later became King of England.

== Appearance and character ==
The physical appearance of Henry at his coronation in 1170 is given in a contemporary court poem written in Latin. It describes the fifteen-year-old prince as being very handsome, &quot;tall but well proportioned, broad-shouldered with a long and elegant neck, pale and freckled skin, bright and wide blue eyes, and a thick mop of reddish-gold hair&quot;.

Henry and Richard were &quot;both tall in stature, rather above the middle size, and of commanding aspect. In courage and magnanimity, they were nearly equal; but in the character of their virtues, there was great disparity... [Henry] was admirable for gentleness and liberality... had a commendable suavity... commended for his easy temper... remarkable for his clemency... the vile and undeserving found their refuge in [Henry]... was the shield of bad men... was bent on martial sports... bestowed his favours on foreigners... [Henry&#x27;s] ambition magnanimously compassed the world.&quot;

Another description says &quot;He was tall in stature and distinguished in appearance; his face expressed merriment and mature judgment in good measure; fair among the children of men, he was courteous and cheerful. Gracious to all, he was loved by all; amiable to all, he was incapable of making an enemy. He was matchless in warfare, and as he outstripped them all in valour, cordiality, and the outstanding graciousness of his manners, his true generosity, and true integrity...&quot;

== Cultural depictions ==
* Henry was portrayed by Riggs O&#x27;Hara in the 1964 film &quot;Becket&quot;.
* He was also portrayed by Alan Cox (as a young boy), Dominic Savage (as a teenager) and Kevin McNally (as an adult) in the 1978 BBC TV series &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Crown&quot;, which dramatised the reigns of his father and brothers.

<doc id="70948" wikidata="Q206297" url="?curid=70948" title="Colorado Avalanche">
<text>The Colorado Avalanche (colloquially known as the Avs) are a professional ice hockey team based in Denver. The Avalanche compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Central Division in the Western Conference. The team plays its home games at Ball Arena, which it shares with the National Basketball Association&#x27;s (NBA) Denver Nuggets and Colorado Mammoth of the National Lacrosse League (NLL).

Founded in 1972 as the Quebec Nordiques, the team was one of the charter franchises of the World Hockey Association (WHA). The franchise joined the NHL in 1979 as a result of the NHL–WHA merger. Following the 1994–95 season, they were sold to the COMSAT Entertainment Group and moved to Denver.

During their first season in Denver, the Avalanche won the Pacific Division and went on to sweep the Florida Panthers in the 1996 Stanley Cup Finals. The 1996 Avalanche became the first Denver-based team in the four major North American professional sports leagues to win a league championship. They were also the second major North American sports team to win a championship a year after moving, joining the National Football League (NFL)&#x27;s 1937 Washington Redskins. In the 2001 Stanley Cup Finals, the Avalanche defeated the New Jersey Devils in seven games to win their second championship. In the 2022 Stanley Cup Finals, the Avalanche defeated the Tampa Bay Lightning in six games to win their third championship. As a result, they remain the only active NHL team that has won all of its appearances in the Stanley Cup Finals.

The Avalanche have won twelve division titles since moving to Denver (and set the league record for most consecutive division titles at nine in a row from 1995 to 2003; one in Quebec, the rest in Colorado), and qualified for the playoffs in each of their first ten seasons after the move; this streak ended in 2007.

==History==

===Quebec Nordiques (1972–1995)===

The Quebec Nordiques were one of the World Hockey Association&#x27;s (WHA) original teams when the league began play in 1972. Though first awarded to a group in San Francisco, the team was subsequently sold and moved to Quebec City prior to the start of the league&#x27;s opening. During their seven WHA seasons, the Nordiques won the Avco World Trophy once, in 1977, and lost the finals once, in 1975. In 1979, the franchise entered the NHL, along with the WHA&#x27;s Edmonton Oilers, Hartford Whalers, and Winnipeg Jets.
After making the postseason for seven consecutive years, from 1981 to 1987, the Nordiques started to decline. From 1987–88 to 1991–92, the team finished last in their division every season, with three of those finishes landing them last in the league. This included a dreadful 12-win season in 1989–90 that is still the worst in franchise history. As a result, the team earned three consecutive first overall draft picks, used to select Mats Sundin (1989), Owen Nolan (1990), and Eric Lindros (1991). Lindros made it clear he did not wish to play for the Nordiques, to the extent he did not wear the team&#x27;s jersey for the press photographs, only holding it when it was presented to him. On advice from his mother, he refused to sign a contract and began a holdout that lasted over a year. On June 30, 1992, he was traded to the Philadelphia Flyers in exchange for five players, the rights to Swedish prospect Peter Forsberg, two first-round draft picks, and US$15 million. The Eric Lindros trade turned the moribund Nordiques into a Stanley Cup contender almost overnight, and is seen in hindsight as one of the most one-sided deals in sports history. In the first season after the trade, 1992–93, the Nordiques reached the playoffs for the first time in six years. Two years later, they won the Northeast Division and had the second best regular season record during the lockout-shortened season.

While the team experienced on-ice success, it spent most of its first 23 years struggling financially. Quebec City was by far the smallest market in the NHL, and the changing financial environment in the NHL made things even more difficult. In 1995, team owner Marcel Aubut asked for a bailout from Quebec&#x27;s provincial government as well as a new publicly funded arena. The bailout fell through, and Aubut subsequently began talks with COMSAT Entertainment Group in Denver, which already owned the Denver Nuggets. In May 1995, COMSAT announced an agreement in principle to purchase the team. The deal became official on July 1, 1995, and 12,000 season tickets were sold in the 37 days after the announcement of the move.

COMSAT considered several names for the team, including &quot;Extreme,&quot; &quot;Blizzards,&quot; and &quot;Black Bears.&quot; It also debated whether to brand the team as a Denver team or as a regional franchise representing either Colorado or the entire Rocky Mountain region. Initially, COMSAT filed for copyright protection for &quot;Black Bears&quot;, but reportedly decided to name the team Rocky Mountain Extreme. When &quot;The Denver Post&quot; leaked the intended name, fan reaction was so negative that COMSAT reconsidered and chose the name Colorado Avalanche. The new name was revealed on August 10, 1995. With the move, the newly relocated team transferred to the Pacific Division of the Western Conference.

===Colorado Avalanche (1995–present)===

====Early success (1995–2001)====

After purchasing the team, COMSAT organized its Denver sports franchises under a separate subsidiary, Ascent Entertainment Group Inc., which went public in 1995. COMSAT retained an 80% controlling interest, with the other 20% available on NASDAQ. The Avalanche played their first game in the McNichols Sports Arena in Denver on October 6, 1995, winning 3–2 against the Detroit Red Wings. It marked a return of the NHL to Denver after an absence of 13 years, when the Colorado Rockies (not to be confused with the Major League Baseball team of the same name) moved to New Jersey to become the New Jersey Devils. Valeri Kamensky scored the first goal as the Avalanche, as well as the game-winning goal in the final minutes. Led on the ice by captain Joe Sakic, forward Peter Forsberg, and defenseman Adam Foote and with Pierre Lacroix as the general manager and Marc Crawford as the head coach, the Avalanche became stronger when All-Star Montreal Canadiens goaltender Patrick Roy joined the team. Roy joined the Avalanche on December 6, 1995, together with ex-Montreal captain Mike Keane in a trade for Jocelyn Thibault, Martin Rucinsky, and Andrei Kovalenko.

=====1995–96 Stanley Cup champions=====
The Avalanche finished the regular season with a 47–25–10 record for 104 points, won the Pacific Division, and finished second in the Western Conference. Colorado progressed to the playoffs, defeating the Vancouver Canucks, Chicago Blackhawks, and the Presidents&#x27; Trophy-winning Detroit Red Wings in the conference finals, all in six games. In the Stanley Cup Finals, the Avalanche met the Florida Panthers, who were also in their first Finals. The Avalanche swept the series 4–0. In Game 4, during the third overtime and after more than 100 minutes of play with no goals, defenseman Uwe Krupp scored to claim the franchise&#x27;s first Stanley Cup. Joe Sakic was the playoff&#x27;s scoring leader with 34 points (18 goals and 16 assists), winning the Conn Smythe Trophy. The 1995–96 Cup was the first major professional championship won by a Denver team. The Avalanche are the only team in NHL history to win the Stanley Cup their first season after a move, and only the second team to win a championship their first season after a move in any of the four major North American sports leagues, following the NFL&#x27;s Washington Commanders. They also became the second team from the WHA to win the Cup. With the Cup win, Russians Alexei Gusarov and Valeri Kamensky, and Swede Peter Forsberg became members of the Triple Gold Club, the exclusive group of ice hockey players who have won Olympic gold, World Championship gold, and the Stanley Cup.

In 1996–97, Colorado won the Pacific Division again as well as the Presidents&#x27; Trophy for finishing the regular season with the best record in the NHL, at 49–24–9 for 107 points. The team was also the NHL&#x27;s best scoring with an average of 3.38 goals scored per game. The Avalanche met the two lowest scorers of the Western Conference in the first two rounds of the playoffs, the Chicago Blackhawks and the Edmonton Oilers, defeating them in six and five games, respectively. During a rematch of the previous year conference finals, the Avalanche lost to the Detroit Red Wings in six games. Detroit went on to sweep the Stanley Cup Finals just as the Avalanche had done the year before. Sandis Ozolinsh was elected for the NHL&#x27;s first All-Star team at the end of the season.
As a free agent during the summer of 1997, Joe Sakic signed a three-year, $21 million offer sheet with the New York Rangers. Under the collective agreement in place at the time between the NHL and NHL Players&#x27; Association (NHLPA), the Avalanche had one week to match the Rangers&#x27; offer or let go of Sakic. Colorado would match the offer, which instigated a salary raise for NHL players.

The Avalanche sent 9 players representing seven countries, as well as head coach Marc Crawford representing Canada, to the 1998 Winter Olympics ice hockey tournament in Nagano, Japan. Alexei Gusarov and Valeri Kamensky won the silver medal with Russia, and Jari Kurri won bronze with Finland.

In the following season, Colorado won the Pacific Division with a 39–26–17 record for 95 points. The team lost in the conference quarterfinals against the Edmonton Oilers in seven games, having led the series 3–1. Peter Forsberg was the NHL&#x27;s second-highest scorer in the regular season with 91 points (25 goals and 66 assists) and was elected for the NHL&#x27;s First All-Star Team. After the end of the season, head coach Marc Crawford rejected the team&#x27;s offer of a two-year contract. Bob Hartley was hired to the head coach position in June 1998.

In 1998–99, with the addition of the Nashville Predators, the NHL realigned their divisions, moving the Avalanche to the new Northwest Division. Despite a slow 2–6–1 start, Colorado finished with a 44–28–10 record for 98 points, won the Division and finished second in the Western Conference. Between January 10 and February 7, the Avalanche had their longest ever winning streak with 12 games. Following the Columbine High School massacre, Colorado postponed their first two playoff games to a later date; they would wear patches in honor of the Columbine victims on their jerseys during the playoffs. The series was altered to a 2–3–2 format as a result of the tragedy. After defeating both the San Jose Sharks and the Detroit Red Wings in six games in the first two rounds, Colorado met the Presidents&#x27; Trophy-winning Dallas Stars in the conference finals, where they lost in seven games. Forsberg, the playoffs&#x27; leading scorer with 24 points (8 goals and 16 assists), was again elected to the NHL&#x27;s First All-Star team, and Chris Drury won the Calder Memorial Trophy for the best rookie of the season. Both Drury and Hejduk were elected to the NHL All-Rookie Team at the end of the season.
It was in the 1999–2000 season that the Colorado Avalanche played their first game in the new Pepsi Center, which cost US$160 million. Milan Hejduk scored the first goal of a 2–1 victory against the Boston Bruins on October 13, 1999. The Avalanche finished the season with a 42–28–11–1 record for 96 points, winning the Division. Before the playoffs, the Avalanche strengthened their defense for a run towards the Stanley Cup by acquiring Hockey Hall of Fame defenseman Ray Bourque and forward Dave Andreychuk. Bourque, who had been a Bruin since 1979, requested a trade to a contender for a chance to win the Stanley Cup. However, Colorado lost in the conference finals against the Dallas Stars in seven games after defeating the Phoenix Coyotes and Detroit Red Wings in five games.

The Avalanche&#x27;s success came amid considerable turmoil in the front office. COMSAT&#x27;s diversification into sports ownership was proving a drain on the company. Cost overruns associated with the construction of Pepsi Center had shareholders up in arms. Finally, in 1997, COMSAT agreed in principle to sell Ascent to Liberty Media. However, Liberty was not interested in sports ownership at the time (though it has since purchased Major League Baseball&#x27;s Atlanta Braves), and made the deal contingent upon Ascent selling both the Avalanche and Nuggets.

After almost two years, Ascent sold the teams to Wal-Mart heirs Bill and Nancy Laurie for $400 million. However, a group of Ascent shareholders sued, claiming the sale price was several million dollars too low. Ascent then agreed to sell the teams to Denver banking tycoon Donald Sturm for $461 million.

A new wrinkle appeared when the City of Denver refused to transfer the parcel of land on which Pepsi Center stood unless Sturm promised to keep the Avalanche and Nuggets in Denver for at least 25 years. Sturm had made his bid in his own name, and the city wanted to protect taxpayers in the event Sturm either died or sold the teams. While Sturm was willing to make a long-term commitment to the city, he was not willing to be held responsible if he died or sold the teams. After negotiations fell apart, Liberty bought all of Ascent, but kept the Nuggets and Avalanche on the market.

Finally, in July 2000, the teams and the Pepsi Center were bought by real estate entrepreneur Stan Kroenke, and brother-in-law to the Lauries, in a $450 million deal, with Liberty retaining a 6.5% interest. As part of the deal, Kroenke placed the teams into a trust that would ensure they stay in Denver until at least 2025. After the deal, Kroenke organized his sports assets under Kroenke Sports Enterprises.

=====2000–01 Stanley Cup champions=====
The 2000–01 season was the best season the team has ever had due to phenomenal play by the all-time leading scorer in Avalanche history, Joe Sakic. The Avalanche won the Division and captured their second Presidents&#x27; Trophy after having finished the regular season with 52–16–10–4 for 118 points. Sakic finished the regular season with 118 points (54 goals and 64 assists), only three behind Jaromir Jagr&#x27;s 121 points. On February 4, 2001, the Avalanche hosted the 51st NHL All-Star Game. Patrick Roy, Ray Bourque, and Joe Sakic played for the North American team, who won 14–12 against the World team, which featured Milan Hejduk and Peter Forsberg. All but Hejduk were part of the starting lineups. Before the playoffs, the Avalanche acquired star defenseman Rob Blake and center Steven Reinprecht from the Los Angeles Kings in exchange for Adam Deadmarsh, Aaron Miller, and their first-round 2001 draft pick.
In the playoffs, Colorado swept their conference quarterfinals against the Vancouver Canucks. In the conference semifinals, the Avalanche defeated the Los Angeles Kings in seven games, after having wasted a 3–1 lead. After the last game of the series, Peter Forsberg underwent surgery to remove a ruptured spleen and it was announced he would not play until the following season. The injury was a huge upset for the team—former NHL goaltender Darren Pang considered it &quot;devastating... to the Colorado Avalanche&quot;. The team would overcome Forsberg&#x27;s injury; in the conference finals, Colorado defeated the St. Louis Blues 4–1 and progressed to the Stanley Cup Finals, where they faced the defending champion New Jersey Devils. The Avalanche came back from a 3–2 series deficit and won the series 4–3, marking the second year in a row that the defending champions lost in the Finals, as the Devils themselves defeated the Dallas Stars in 2000. After being handed the Cup from NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman, captain Joe Sakic immediately turned and gave it to Ray Bourque, capping off Bourque&#x27;s 22-year career with his only championship. Sakic was the playoffs&#x27; leading scorer with 26 points (13 goals and 13 assists). He won the Hart Memorial Trophy, given to the NHL&#x27;s most valuable player during the regular season; the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy, awarded to the player that has shown the best sportsmanship and gentlemanly conduct combined with performance in play; the Lester B. Pearson Award; and shared the NHL Plus/Minus Award with Patrik Elias of the Devils. Patrick Roy won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the MVP of the playoffs. Shjon Podein was awarded the King Clancy Memorial Trophy for significant humanitarian contributions to his community, namely his work on charitable organizations and his own children foundation. Ray Bourque and Joe Sakic were elected to the NHL&#x27;s First All-Star Team. Rob Blake was elected to the Second All-Star Team.

====Remaining competitive (2001–2010)====
In the 2001–02 season, Colorado finished the regular season with 99 points from a 45–28–8–1 record, winning the Northwest Division. Colorado had the league&#x27;s lowest goals conceded: 169, an average of 2.06 per game. The NHL season was interrupted for the 2002 Winter Olympics, in Salt Lake City. The Avalanche had nine players representing six countries. Canada won the ice hockey tournament, with Rob Blake, Adam Foote, and Joe Sakic won gold medals. American Chris Drury took home a silver medal. With the win, Blake and Sakic became members of the Triple Gold Club. The Avalanche advanced through the first two rounds of the playoffs, winning 4–3 against the Los Angeles Kings and 4–3 against the San Jose Sharks. Patrick Roy had a shutout on the decisive game of each series. The Avalanche made the conference finals for the fourth consecutive season (and sixth overall in the last seven seasons), meeting the Detroit Red Wings in the playoffs for the fifth time in seven years. Colorado had a 3–2 lead after five games, but lost Game 6 at home, 2–0, and Game 7 in Detroit, 7–0. As in 1997, Detroit went on to win the Stanley Cup. Peter Forsberg was the playoffs&#x27; leading scorer with 27 points (9 goals, 18 assists). Roy won the William M. Jennings Trophy, given to the goaltenders of the team with fewest goals scored against. Roy and Sakic were both elected to the NHL&#x27;s First All-Star Team, with Rob Blake elected to the Second All-Star Team.

The following season, 2002–03, saw the Avalanche claim the NHL record for most consecutive division titles, nine, breaking the Montreal Canadiens&#x27; streak of eight titles from 1974 to 1982. The division title came after a bad start by the team, that led to the exit of head coach Bob Hartley in December. General manager Pierre Lacroix promoted assistant coach Tony Granato, who had only three months of coaching experience as an assistant, to the head coach position. The team&#x27;s playoff spot seemed in doubt at one point, but the Avalanche managed to finish with 105 points, ahead of the Vancouver Canucks by one. The race to the title was exciting, namely the second-to-last game of the season, as the Avalanche needed to win the game to stay in the race, and Milan Hejduk scored with ten seconds left in overtime to defeat the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. The title was guaranteed in the final day of the regular season, when the Avalanche defeated the St. Louis Blues 5–2 and the Vancouver Canucks lost against the Los Angeles Kings 2–0. In the conference quarterfinals, the Avalanche blew a 3–1 series lead over the Minnesota Wild, losing in overtime in Game 7. Peter Forsberg won the Art Ross Trophy for the leading scorer of the regular season, which he finished with 106 points (29 goals, 77 assists). Forsberg also won the Hart Memorial Trophy for the regular season&#x27;s most valuable player, and shared the NHL Plus/Minus Award with teammate Hejduk. Hejduk scored 50 goals to win the Maurice &quot;Rocket&quot; Richard Trophy, awarded annually to the leading goal scorer in the NHL. Forsberg was elected to the NHL&#x27;s First All-Star Team; Hejduk was elected to the Second All-Star Team.

Patrick Roy retired after that season, and the team signed star wingers Paul Kariya from the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, and Teemu Selanne from the San Jose Sharks. Both struggled during their first season with the team—Kariya spent most of the 2003–04 season injured and Selanne scored only 32 points (16 goals and 16 assists) in 78 games. There were doubts if goaltender David Aebischer could perform at the top level the team was used to while having Roy. Having &quot;nine elite players&quot;, &quot;the most talented top six forwards on one team since the days of the Edmonton Oilers&quot; was not good enough as the franchise failed to win the Northwest Division title, ending the NHL record streak. The 40–22–13–7 record was good enough for 100 points, one less than the Northwest Division champion Vancouver Canucks. This ended a streak of nine consecutive division titles dating to the team&#x27;s last year in Quebec.

During a game against Vancouver on March 8, 2004, Canucks player Todd Bertuzzi punched Colorado&#x27;s Steve Moore from behind, leaving Moore unconscious. It was said to be retaliation for a hit Moore had delivered to Canucks captain Markus Naslund the month before. Moore sustained three fractured neck vertebrae, among other injuries caused by the hit and subsequent pile up, ending his career. Bertuzzi was away from professional hockey for 17 months as a result of suspensions. In Denver, after the Moore hit, it became tradition for the home fans to boo Todd Bertuzzi every time he gained possession of the puck, whenever his team faced the Avalanche at Pepsi Center.

In the 2004 playoffs, Colorado won the conference quarterfinals against the Dallas Stars in five games, but lost in the conference semifinals against the Sharks in six games. Joe Sakic was, once again, elected to the 2004 All-star team, winning the NHL/Sheraton Road Performer Award, and became the first Avalanche player ever to be chosen as game MVP, when he scored a hat-trick. In July 2004, Joel Quenneville was hired for the position of head coach, replacing Tony Granato, who became his assistant.

The 2004–05 NHL season was canceled because of an unresolved lockout. During the lockout, many Avalanche players played in European leagues. David Aebischer returned home with Alex Tanguay to play for Swiss club HC Lugano; Milan Hejduk and Peter Forsberg returned to their former teams in their native countries, HC Pardubice and Modo Hockey. Nine other players from the roster played in Europe during the lockout.

After the 2004–05 lockout and implementation of a salary cap, the Avalanche were forced to release some of their top players. Peter Forsberg and Adam Foote were lost in free agency to save room in the cap for Joe Sakic and Rob Blake. Although the salary cap was a blow to one of the highest spenders of the league, the team finished the 2005–06 regular season with a 43–30–9 record for 95 points, good enough to finish second in the Division, seven behind the Calgary Flames and tied with the Edmonton Oilers. The season paused in February for the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy. The Avalanche sent a league-leading 11 players from eight countries. Finnish Antti Laaksonen earned the silver medal, while Ossi Vaananen ended up not playing because of an injury; Czech Milan Hejduk won a bronze medal. In the conference quarterfinals, Colorado defeated Dallas Stars team that had the second-best record in the conference, in five games. The team was swept in the conference semifinals by the Anaheim Ducks.

The next day, Pierre Lacroix resigned after service as GM since 1994 and François Giguère was hired as his replacement. Lacroix remained president of the franchise until spring 2013, when the team owner&#x27;s son, Josh Kroenke, took over as team president and governor. Pierre Lacroix remained an advisor to the team until his death in 2020 from COVID-19.

By the beginning of the 2006–07 season, Joe Sakic and Milan Hejduk were the only two remaining members from the 2000–01 Stanley Cup-winning squad, with Sakic being the only one from the team&#x27;s days in Quebec, though Hejduk &quot;was&quot; drafted by the Nordiques. Paul Stastny, son of Nordiques legend Peter Stastny, also provided a link to the franchise&#x27;s past. Before the previous season&#x27;s playoffs, in a move reminiscent of Patrick Roy&#x27;s trade, the Avalanche traded Aebischer to the Montreal Canadiens for the Vezina Trophy-winning Jose Theodore. However, the move would not turn out to be as successful when Theodore posted a 13–15–1 record in 2006–07, with an .891 save percentage, and 3.26 goals against average (GAA). His US$6 million salary became a heavy burden for the Avalanche in the salary cap era. That same season saw an 11-year sell-out streak of 487 home games ended on October 16, 2006, in a home game against the Chicago Blackhawks, that saw the Pepsi Center under capacity by 326 seats. The sell-out streak was an all-time NHL record for the longest consecutive attendance sell-outs at home games with 487; and began on November 9, 1995, on the Avalanche&#x27;s eighth regular season home game during the 1995–96 season at the McNichols Sports Arena. The record has since been broken by the Pittsburgh Penguins, who saw their own streak end in October 2021 at 633 games.

The Avalanche missed the playoffs for the 2006–07 season, missing it for the first time since 1993–94, when they were still in Quebec. The team had a 15–2–2 run in the last 19 games of the season to keep their playoffs hopes alive until the penultimate day of the season. A 4–2 loss against the Nashville Predators on April 7, with former player Peter Forsberg assisting the game-winning goal scored by another former player, Paul Kariya, eliminated Colorado from the playoff race. As consolation, the team won the last game of the season against the Calgary Flames the following day and finished fourth in the Northwest Division and ninth in the Western Conference with a 44–31–7 record for 95 points, one less than eighth-seeded Calgary. Nonetheless, the result was greater than expected by hockey pundits; &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; previewed before the start of the season that the Avalanche would finish 13th in the Western Conference. During that last game of the season, Joe Sakic scored a goal and two assists and became the second-oldest player in NHL history to reach 100 points, behind only Gordie Howe, who had 103 points at age 40 in the 1968–69 season. During the season, Paul Stastny set an NHL record for longest point streak by a rookie, with 20 games, three more than the previous record, held by Teemu Selanne and Karlis Skrastins set a new NHL record for the longest game streak by a defenseman, with 495 games. Until the Avalanche&#x27;s 2006–07 season, no team in the history of the NHL had ever made it to 95 points without earning a spot in the playoffs. In the Eastern Conference, three teams progressed to the playoffs with fewer than 95 points: the New York Rangers (94), the Tampa Bay Lightning (93) and the New York Islanders (92).
For the 2007–08 season, the Avalanche signed two free agents: defenseman Scott Hannan and left winger Ryan Smyth. These acquisitions filled the team&#x27;s needs and were expected to help make an impact in the playoffs. On February 25, 2008, unrestricted free agent Peter Forsberg signed with the Avalanche for the remainder of the 2007–08 season. A day later, at the trade deadline, they re-acquired defenseman Adam Foote from the Columbus Blue Jackets as well as Ruslan Salei from the Florida Panthers. In the conference quarterfinals, Colorado defeated the Minnesota Wild in six games. In the conference semifinals, however, the Avalanche were swept by the eventual Stanley Cup champion Detroit Red Wings.

On May 9, 2008, the Avalanche announced that Joel Quenneville would not return to coach the team next season. Two weeks later, Tony Granato was named head coach of the Avalanche for the second time.

The 2008–09 season was the worst season the Avalanche had since moving to Denver. Posting a record of 32–45–5, finishing 15th in the Western Conference (28th overall), and recording the fewest points since their days in Quebec during the 1979–80 season. The Avalanche missed the postseason for the second time in three seasons. It would be the first time in Avalanche history the team&#x27;s top scorer would score less than 70 points on the season, as Milan Hejduk and Ryan Smyth would register only 59 points each. On April 13, 2009, just one day after the end of the season, the Avalanche relieved Francois Giguere of his general manager duties. Colorado would go on to receive the highest draft pick in Avalanche history, third overall. That pick turned out to be Brampton Battalion star Matt Duchene.
In the 2009 off-season, the Avalanche named Greg Sherman the new general manager and Joe Sacco the new head coach. The following month, top scorer Ryan Smyth was traded to the Los Angeles Kings and Joe Sakic, the only team captain the Avalanche had ever known, retired after 21 seasons in the NHL. The Avalanche named Adam Foote as his replacement. Sakic&#x27;s jersey retirement ceremony took place on October 1, 2009, before the season opener at home against the San Jose Sharks where the Avalanche won 5–2. The Avalanche started the season off strong until the Olympic break. Three Avalanche team members played in Vancouver: Paul Stastny for the United States, Ruslan Salei for Belarus and Peter Budaj for Slovakia. Following the Winter Olympics, the Avalanche struggled but eventually clinched a playoff spot with 95 points on the season, a 26-point improvement from the previous year&#x27;s effort, and good enough for eighth place in the Western Conference. The Avalanche fell in the conference quarterfinals to the top-seeded San Jose Sharks in six games.

Stan Kroenke purchased full ownership in the NFL&#x27;s St. Louis Rams in 2010. Since the NFL does not allow its owners to hold majority control of major-league teams in other NFL cities, Kroenke turned over day-to-day control of the Nuggets and Avalanche to his son, Josh, toward the end of 2010. Kroenke had to sell his controlling interest in both teams by 2014.

In 2010, the Avalanche made it to the playoffs but lost in the conference quarterfinals 4–2 against San Jose. Joe Sacco finished third in Jack Adams Trophy voting that season.

====Decline (2010–2017)====
In the 2010–11 season, the Avalanche saw their worst season yet since moving to Denver. They only had 68 points in the standings and had winless streaks after the All-Star break. They finished 29th in the 30-team NHL, besting only their division mates, the Edmonton Oilers. Matt Duchene set a franchise record as the youngest scoring leader in Quebec/Colorado history with 67 points, sharing the club goals-leader title with David Jones. Former Avalanche player Peter Forsberg attempted a comeback in the NHL with Colorado mid-season. However, after two games, no points and compiling a plus-minus rating of −4, Forsberg announced his retirement from professional hockey. Captain Adam Foote also retired after the final game of the season.
In the off-season, Colorado had two first-round picks. Present at the draft, former Avalanche great Joe Sakic served his first duties as new alternate governor and adviser of hockey operations of the club. With their first pick, second overall, they selected Gabriel Landeskog, the young captain of the Ontario Hockey League&#x27;s Kitchener Rangers. Second, they selected defenseman Duncan Siemens 11th overall, a pick acquired from the St. Louis Blues in the controversial trade that sent power-forward Chris Stewart, long time top prospect Kevin Shattenkirk and a second-round pick to the Blues in exchange for their first-round pick, veteran Jay McClement and 2006 former first overall pick, Erik Johnson. A complete overhaul at the goal-tending position sent Peter Budaj to the Montreal Canadiens and Brian Elliott to St. Louis, Elliott having been acquired from the Ottawa Senators for Craig Anderson during the team&#x27;s downward spiral the season previous. Goaltender Semyon Varlamov was dealt to Colorado from the Washington Capitals in exchange for a first and second pick, while veteran netminder and former Conn Smythe Trophy winner Jean-Sébastien Giguère was signed as a free agent in hopes to mentor the young Varlamov. Duncan Siemens was sent back to his major junior team, the Saskatoon Blades in camp, while Gabriel Landeskog made the opening night roster against the Red Wings on October 8, 2011, at Pepsi Center. Adam Deadmarsh was promoted from video/developmental coach to offensive assistant coach after Steve Konowalchuk accepted a job as head coach in the minor league.

Peter Forsberg&#x27;s number 21 became the fourth jersey number retired by the Avalanche on opening night, a contest Colorado would lose to Detroit 3–0. Colorado redeemed themselves in game two of the season on October 10, 2011, against the 2011 Stanley Cup champion Boston Bruins. Varlamov negated all 30 shots registered by Boston and posted the fifth shutout of his career and first win as an Avalanche in the regular season. Milan Hejduk scored the game-winning goal and first goal of the season for the club in a 1–0 victory over the defending champions. In April 2012, the Avalanche were eliminated from playoff contention and finished 11th place in the Western Conference. Despite a 20-point improvement from last season&#x27;s efforts, the team failed to reach the playoffs for the second-straight year, the first time the club history since their move to Denver. Head coach Joe Sacco signed a two-year contract extension shortly after the end of the season. Stand out rookie Gabriel Landeskog overtook Matt Duchene as the youngest in franchise history to lead the team in goals, scoring 22 in 82 games.

Having resigned most of their free agents, the club wouldn&#x27;t see much change in the 2012 off-season, with the exception of losing unrestricted free agents Peter Mueller, Jay McClement and Kevin Porter. Colorado would add Greg Zanon, John Mitchell and high scoring winger P. A. Parenteau to its roster. Gabriel Landeskog, the Avalanche&#x27;s lone representative at the 2012 NHL Awards, won the Calder Memorial Trophy, joining Chris Drury, Peter Forsberg and Peter Stastny for earning top rookie honors for the Avalanche.

On September 4, 2012, Gabriel Landeskog was named the fourth captain of the Avalanche. Milan Hejduk relinquished the captaincy a week earlier. At 19 years and 286 days old, Landeskog became the youngest captain in NHL history at that time, being 11 days younger than when Sidney Crosby was named captain of the Pittsburgh Penguins at 19 years and 297 days.

After a disappointing 2012–13 season which saw the Colorado Avalanche finish 15th in the Conference and 29th overall in the League, it was announced on April 28, 2013, that head coach Joe Sacco had been relieved of his duties. On May 10, it was announced that former long-time Avalanche captain and Hockey Hall of Famer Joe Sakic would be named Executive Vice President of hockey operations, overseeing all matters involving hockey personnel. It was also announced that Josh Kroenke, son of owner Stan Kroenke, was named President of the Avalanche, succeeding Pierre Lacroix. On May 23, Patrick Roy returned to the Avalanche as head coach and Vice President of hockey operations. Although Sherman retained his role as general manager, he was largely reduced to an advisory role. Roy and Sakic shared most of the duties held by a general manager on most other NHL teams, though Sakic had the final say on hockey matters. The Avalanche held the top overall pick in the 2013 NHL draft, which they used to draft Nathan Mackinnon, who had previously played against the team that Patrick Roy had coached in the QMJHL.

Under Roy, in 2013–14, the Avalanche returned to the playoffs, finishing first in the Central Division and second in the Western Conference, but would lose a seven-game series to the Minnesota Wild in the first round. Nonetheless, for his outstanding job as a first-year coach, Roy won the Jack Adams Award for the NHL&#x27;s top coaching honors.

Just prior to the start of the 2014–15 season, Sakic was given the title of general manager while Sherman was demoted to assistant GM, formalizing the &quot;de facto&quot; arrangement that had been in place since 2013. Despite the front office changes, the Avalanche failed to qualify for the 2015 playoffs after finishing with a record of 39–31–12, resulting in a seventh-place finish in the Central Division.

After failing to qualify for the playoffs again following the 2015–16 season, Roy resigned his posts on August 11, 2016.

Following the departure of Roy, the Avalanche hired Jared Bednar from the Calder Cup champions, the Lake Erie Monsters of the American Hockey League (AHL), as head coach. Bednar walked into a difficult situation. He was hired just a month before the opening of training camp, and thus had nowhere near enough time to install his own system. He was also unable to bring his own staff, having to make do with holdovers from Roy&#x27;s staff. On December 10, 2016, the Avalanche allowed ten goals in a 10–1 loss to the Canadiens. The Avalanche closed out their season with a record of 22–56–4 and 48 points, the worst record in the league and the franchise&#x27;s worst since moving to Denver (only the 1989–90 and 1990–91 Nordiques finished with fewer points). It was also the worst record of any team in the NHL since the Atlanta Thrashers finished with a record of 14–61–7 and 39 points in the 1999–2000 season (which was their first season in the league) and one of the worst for a non-expansion team since 1967. During the 2017 NHL draft, Colorado held the fourth overall pick, which they used to draft defenseman Cale Makar.

====Return to prominence, third Presidents&#x27; Trophy and third Stanley Cup (2017–present)====

After much speculation about wanting out of Colorado, the Avalanche traded Duchene to the Ottawa Senators in a three-team trade on November 5, 2017. From Ottawa, the Avalanche acquired Andrew Hammond, Shane Bowers, a 2018 first-round pick and a 2019 third-round pick. Additionally, the Avalanche acquired Samuel Girard, Vladislav Kamenev and a 2018 second-round pick from the Predators. The Avalanche had a ten-game win streak from January 2 to 22. During that stretch, the Avalanche outscored their opponents 41–16. Offensively, the Avalanche were led by Nathan MacKinnon and Mikko Rantanen. MacKinnon finished fifth in league scoring with 97 points, while Rantanen scored 84 points in his sophomore season. The Avalanche qualified for the playoffs in their final game of the regular season, defeating the Blues, who they were battling with for the final wild-card spot, 5–2. The team finished with 95 points, a 47-point increase from their previous season. The Avalanche matched up with the Presidents&#x27; Trophy-winning Nashville Predators in the first round. After finding themselves down 3–1, the Avalanche rallied to win Game 5 2–1 after scoring two goals late in the third period. With Varlamov and Jonathan Bernier both out with injuries, Hammond started the game, making a career-high 44 saves. However, the Predators blanked the Avalanche 5–0 in Game 6 to win the series.

On November 18, 2018, the Avalanche earned its 1,000th win in team history, defeating the Ducks in overtime. On May 2, 2019, it was announced that the City of Denver and KSE reached an agreement to keep both the Avalanche and Nuggets in the city until 2040. The Avalanche returned to the playoffs in the 2019 season, finishing again in the final wild-card spot. However, the Avalanche were able to defeat the Calgary Flames in five games, with rookie Cale Makar scoring in his first career game during game 3. The Avalanche would then get eliminated in game 7 of the second round by the San Jose Sharks. 

During the 2019 off-season, the Avalanche traded long time defenseman Tyson Barrie to the Toronto Maple Leafs along with Alexander Kerfoot and a sixth-round pick in exchange for Nazem Kadri, Calle Rosen, and a third-round pick. The Avalanche improved their record significantly and were sitting at second in their division when the COVID-19 pandemic paused the 2019–20 season in March 2020. When the NHL resumed their season in September, the Avalanche defeated the Arizona Coyotes in the first round, before being eliminated in game 7 by the Dallas Stars in second round.

Following the 2020 playoffs, the Avalanche acquired Devon Toews from the New York Islanders in exchange for second-round picks in the 2021 and 2022. The Avalanche continued to improve and finished the regular season with the Presidents&#x27; Trophy. The Avalanche started the postseason with six straight wins, including a sweep over the St. Louis Blues in the first round and a 7–1 in game 1 of the second round against the Vegas Golden Knights. However, despite the Avalanche building a 2–0 series lead over Vegas, they failed to win another game of the series and were eliminated in six games. This loss marked their third straight second round exit.
During the 2021 off-season, goaltender Philipp Grubauer left during free agency and signed a contract with the Seattle Kraken. To address the need for a goaltender, the Avalanche traded Conor Timmins and a 2022 first-round pick in exchange for Darcy Kuemper. In the 2021–22 season, the Avalanche finished with 119 points, clinching the playoffs for the fifth straight time. They began the playoffs with a sweep over the Nashville Predators before defeating the St. Louis Blues in six games to advance to the conference finals for the first time in 20 years. The Avalanche then swept the Edmonton Oilers to reach the Stanley Cup Finals. On June 26, 2022, the Avalanche won their third Stanley Cup in franchise history, defeating the two-time defending champion Tampa Bay Lightning in six games. Following their victory, the Avalanche had finished the postseason 16–4, which tied for the best postseason record since 1988. Cale Makar was named the winner of the Conn Smythe and Norris Memorial Trophies, following his exceptional regular season and playoff performances.

In the following season, the Avalanche finished as division champions, but were upset by the Seattle Kraken in seven games in the first round of the 2023 playoffs. In the 2023–24 season, the Avalanche finished third in the Central Division. They eliminated the Winnipeg Jets in five games in the opening round of the 2024 playoffs, and then lost to the Dallas Stars in six games in the second round.

==Team information==

===Logo===

The Colorado Avalanche logo is composed by a burgundy letter A with snow wrapped around, similar to an avalanche. There is a hockey puck in the lower–right end of the snow and a steel blue oval on the background.

The team&#x27;s original alternate logo was the foot of a Yeti and was seen on the shoulders of the Avalanche&#x27;s home and away jerseys. The logo was used on their jerseys since 1995; however, prior to the start of the 2015 NHL entry draft, the club unveiled a new alternate logo. The new logo features the insignia taken from the Colorado state flag and re-colored to match the team&#x27;s color scheme. The logo was featured on a patch located on the shoulders of the team&#x27;s uniforms, along with a 20th-anniversary logo, for the 2015–16 season.

===Jerseys===
The team colors are burgundy, steel blue, black, silver, and white. For the 2007–08 season, the NHL introduced the new-look &quot;Reebok EDGE&quot; jerseys. The Avalanche debuted their new version of the Reebok EDGE jerseys on September 12, 2007, at an Avalanche press conference. The design is similar to the previous jerseys, with some added piping.

The road jersey from 1995 to 2003 was predominantly burgundy and steel blue in color. Along the jersey, there are two black and white zigzag lines, one on the shoulders, and the other near the belly. Between them, the jersey is burgundy; outside those lines it is steel blue. Similar lines exist around the neck. The Avalanche logo is in the center of the jersey. On top of the shoulders, there is an alternate logo, one on each side. The away jersey is similar but with different colors. The burgundy part on the home jersey is white on the away jersey, the steel blue part is burgundy, and the black and white lines became gray and steel blue. In 2003, the NHL switched home and road jerseys, with colors being worn at home and white jerseys on the road.

The Avalanche introduced a third jersey during the 2001–02 season. It is predominantly burgundy. &quot;Colorado&quot; is spelled in a diagonal across the jersey where the logo is on the other jerseys. From the belly down, three large horizontal stripes, the first and the last being black and the middle one being white. In the middle of the arms, there are five stripes, black, white, and burgundy from the outside inside on both sides. On the shoulders is the primary &quot;A&quot; logo. The third jersey was not worn by the Avalanche for the 2007–08 or the 2008–09 seasons after the NHL switched to the Reebok EDGE jerseys.

In the 2009–10 season, the Avalanche introduced a new third jersey that was worn for the first time during the November 14, 2009, home game against the Vancouver Canucks. It is similar to the club&#x27;s previous third jersey, but is primarily steel blue instead of burgundy and features burgundy patches on the shoulders with the &quot;A&quot; logo inside. It also does not have horizontal striping on the bottom. On the arms, there are five stripes, burgundy, white, and black from the outside inside on both sides. They are closer to the elbows than the stripes on the previous third jerseys.

Prior to the 2015–16 season, the Avalanche modified their existing uniform set by replacing the yeti foot shoulder logo in favor of the burgundy and black &quot;C&quot; logo. A new third jersey was also unveiled, featuring navy (instead of steel blue) as the dominant color, and a minimalized, recolored version of the Rockies logo in front.

The &quot;C&quot; logo also served as the main crest of the Avalanche&#x27;s 2016 Stadium Series uniforms, which featured a white base, enlarged lettering and numbers, and steel blue, silver, and burgundy sleeve stripes.

Before the 2017–18 season, the Avalanche unveiled new uniforms as part of the switch to Adidas. The look was inspired from the original uniforms they wore from 1995 to 2007, save for the bold silver border that pays homage to Colorado&#x27;s silver mining industry. There were no third jerseys used during that season, but for the 2018–19 season, the Avalanche would wear their 2015–2017 navy uniforms as their alternates. The navy uniforms are currently used in regular season home games against Central Division opponents (though during the 2020–21 season, they only wore them against the Minnesota Wild and St. Louis Blues as both Central Division teams were briefly realigned with the Avalanche on the West Division, and made an exception in the 2021 and 2022 home openers by wearing burgundy uniforms against the Chicago Blackhawks, as well as the November 21, 2022, home game against the Dallas Stars by wearing the &quot;Reverse Retro&quot; uniforms), which the Avalanche dub as &quot;Division Rivalry Nights&quot;.

As part of the 2020 Stadium Series, the Avalanche unveiled special edition uniforms inspired by Colorado&#x27;s majestic landscape and the Cadet Chapel of the United States Air Force Academy. The uniforms bore a steel blue top and burgundy bottom, with white accents forming the shape of an &quot;A&quot; in front and the middle stripe at the back.

Before the 2020–21 season, the Avalanche unveiled a &quot;Reverse Retro&quot; alternate uniform. The design was taken from the classic Quebec Nordiques uniforms but recolored to match the Avalanche&#x27;s current color scheme. The Avalanche also revealed a new color scheme for their pants and helmets, with black replaced by steel blue. The following season, the road white uniforms were tweaked to feature burgundy player names and steel blue numbers with burgundy trim, thus eliminating black from the color scheme.

A second &quot;Reverse Retro&quot; uniform (branded as Reverse Retro 2.0) was unveiled in the 2022–23 season, utilizing the 1995–2007 white uniform template but recolored to the blue, red and gold colors originally used by the NHL&#x27;s Rockies and is found on the Colorado state flag. The &quot;C&quot; alternate logo replaced the primary in front.

===Broadcasters===

==Rivalries==

===Detroit Red Wings===

In 1996, the Colorado Avalanche met the Detroit Red Wings in the conference finals and upset the Red Wings 4–2. During Game 6, Red Wings player Kris Draper was checked into the boards face-first by Avalanche player Claude Lemieux. As a result, Draper had to undergo facial reconstructive surgery and had to have his jaw wired shut for five weeks. The incident marked the beginning of a rivalry often considered one of the most intense in NHL history by the press and fans.

In the following season, in the last regular season meeting between the Avalanche and the Red Wings on March 26, 1997, a brawl known as the Brawl in Hockeytown broke out. The game ended with nine fights, 11 goals, 39 penalties, 148 penalty minutes, one hat-trick (by Valeri Kamensky) and a goaltender fight between Stanley Cup champion Patrick Roy and Mike Vernon. Claude Lemieux was one of the players singled out by the Red Wings players. The Red Wings ended up winning the game in overtime 6–5. The teams met again in the conference finals that season, with the Red Wings emerging victorious and going on to win the Stanley Cup.

The rivalry between the Avalanche and the Red Wings was at its peak from 1996 to 2002. During those seven seasons the two teams played five postseason series against each other in the Stanley Cup playoffs, with the Avalanche winning three of the series (1995–96, 4–2; 1998–99, 4–2; 1999–2000, 4–1) and the Red Wings winning two of them (1996–97, 4–2; 2001–02, 4–3). During this time frame, these two teams combined for a total of five Stanley Cup championships in seven years, the Avalanche winning twice (1995–96 and 2000–01) and the Red Wings winning three times (1996–97, 1997–98 and 2001–02). After 2002, the rivalry between the two teams began to cool down, and the two teams would not meet again in the playoffs until 2008, when the Red Wings swept the Avalanche in the conference semifinals and went on to win the Stanley Cup. The Red Wings moved to the Eastern Conference in 2013–14 season as part of the realignment which makes the two rivals only see each other twice a year.

<doc id="70949" wikidata="Q229807" url="?curid=70949" title="Berengaria of Navarre">
<text>Berengaria of Navarre (, , ; 1165–1170 – 23 December 1230) was Queen of England as the wife of Richard I of England. She was the eldest daughter of Sancho VI of Navarre and Sancha of Castile. As is the case with many of the medieval English queens, little is known of her life.

Traditionally known as &quot;the only English queen never to set foot in the country&quot;, she may in fact have visited England after her husband&#x27;s death, but did not do so before, nor did she see much of Richard during her marriage, which was childless. She did (unusually for the wife of a crusader) accompany him on the start of the Third Crusade, but mostly lived in his French possessions, where she gave generously to the church, despite difficulties in collecting the pension she was due from Richard&#x27;s brother and successor John after she became a widow.

==Early years==
In 1185, Berengaria was given the fief of Monreal in Navarre by her father. Eleanor of Aquitaine promoted the engagement of Berengaria to her son Richard the Lionheart. An alliance with Navarre meant protection for the southern borders of Eleanor&#x27;s Duchy of Aquitaine and helped create better relations with neighbouring Castile, whose queen was Richard&#x27;s sister Eleanor. Also, Navarre had assimilated the troubadour culture of Aquitaine and Berengaria&#x27;s reputation was unbesmirched. It seems that Berengaria and Richard did in fact meet once, years before their marriage, and writers have claimed that there was an attraction between them at that time.

In 1190, Eleanor met King Sancho VI in Pamplona, and he hosted a banquet in the Royal Palace of Olite in her honour. The betrothal could not be celebrated openly, for Richard had been betrothed for many years to Alys, half-sister of King Philip II of France. Richard terminated his betrothal to Alys in 1190 while at Messina. It has been suggested that Alys had become the mistress of Richard&#x27;s own father, Henry II of England, and possibly the mother of an illegitimate child; a marriage between Richard and Alys therefore would have been technically impossible for religious reasons of affinity.

==Marriage==
Richard had Berengaria brought to him by his mother Eleanor of Aquitaine. Because Richard was already on the Third Crusade, having wasted no time in setting off after his coronation, the two women had a long and difficult journey to catch up with him. They arrived at Messina in Sicily in 1191 during Lent (when the marriage could not take place) and were joined by Richard&#x27;s sister Joan, the widowed queen of Sicily. Berengaria was left in Joan&#x27;s custody. En route to the Holy Land, the ship carrying Berengaria and Joan ran aground off the coast of Cyprus, and they were threatened by the island&#x27;s ruler, Isaac Comnenus. Richard came to their rescue, captured the island, and overthrew Comnenus. Berengaria married Richard the Lionheart on 12 May 1191 in the Chapel of St. George at Limassol on Cyprus and was crowned the same day by the archbishop of Bordeaux and the bishops of Évreux and Bayonne.

==Queen consort==

Whether the marriage was ever even consummated is a matter for conjecture. In any case, Richard certainly took his new wife with him for the first part of the Third Crusade. This was unusual (although Richard&#x27;s mother and Berengaria&#x27;s predecessor, Eleanor of Aquitaine, had, when queen of France, been with her husband throughout the Second Crusade). Berengaria returned well before Richard left the Holy Land; on his return to Europe, he was captured and imprisoned. Berengaria remained in Europe, based at Beaufort-en-Vallée, attempting to raise money for his ransom. 

After his release, Richard returned to England and was not joined by his wife. Richard then set about reclaiming the territories in France that had been lost by his brother John or taken by King Philip II. His focus was on his kingdom, not his queen. He was ordered by Pope Celestine III to reunite with Queen Berengaria and to show fidelity to her in the future. Richard, now mostly spending his time in France, obeyed and took Berengaria to church every week thereafter. When he died in 1199, she was distressed, perhaps more so at deliberately being overlooked as queen of England and Cyprus. Some historians believe that Berengaria honestly loved her husband, and Richard&#x27;s feelings for her were merely formal because the marriage was a political rather than a romantic union.

==Queen dowager==
Berengaria never visited England during King Richard&#x27;s lifetime, and Richard spent less than six months in England while they were married. There is evidence, however, that she may have done so in the years following his death, since she is believed to have been present at the translation of St Thomas Becket&#x27;s remains at Canterbury in 1220. The traditional description of her as &quot;the only English queen never to set foot in the country&quot; still would be true because she did not visit England during the time she was Richard&#x27;s consort. She certainly sent envoys to England several times, mainly to inquire about the pension she was due as dowager queen and Richard&#x27;s widow, which King John failed to pay. Although Queen Eleanor intervened and Pope Innocent III threatened him with an interdict if he did not pay Berengaria what was due, King John still owed her more than £4000 when he died. During the reign of his son Henry III of England, however, her payments were made.

=== Lady of Le Mans ===
Berengaria became the Lady (Lord) of Le Mans, one of her dower properties, where she eventually settled. She founded L&#x27;Épau Abbey in Le Mans in 1229, where she was buried. In 1240, Archbishop Rodrigo Jimenez de Rada of Toledo wrote of Berengaria that she lived &quot;as a most praiseworthy widow and stayed for the most part in the city of Le Mans, which she held as part of her marriage dower, devoting herself to almsgiving, prayer and good works, witnessing as an example to all women of chastity and religion and in the same city she came to the end of her days with a happy death.&quot; A skeleton thought to be hers was rediscovered in 1960 during the restoration of the abbey. These remains are preserved beneath the stone effigy of the queen, which is now to be found in the chapter house of the abbey.

==Historical significance==

Historian Ann Trindade says about Berengaria that she &quot;is remembered as a benefactor of several…religious congregations and institutions and was regarded as a model of piety.&quot; She also states that “Berengaria’s life illustrates very clearly the constraints under which medieval women, even aristocratic ones, were obliged to live.” Berengaria&#x27;s struggles are a good example of what many women faced in the thirteenth century, and “those long years of widowhood reveal, on the basis of record, a strong courageous woman, independent, solitary, battling against difficult political and economic circumstances, with little interest in the trappings of courtly existence, sustained by her faith in Christianity and her loyalty to the See of St Peter, not afraid to assert her rights against powerful enemies, both lay and clerical.”

==In the media==
In the 1923 film &quot;Richard the Lion-Hearted&quot;, Queen Berengaria is played by Kathleen Clifford. The 1935 film &quot;The Crusades&quot;, starring Loretta Young and Henry Wilcoxon, tells a fictionalised story of Richard and Berengaria&#x27;s marriage. The 1954 historical drama film &quot;King Richard and the Crusaders&quot;, starring George Sanders and Paula Raymond, shows Richard and Berengaria as married and on the Third Crusade. The 1960s British television series &quot;Richard the Lionheart&quot; features their marriage prominently, with Berengaria played by Sheila Whittingham. All versions were highly romanticised and are not reliable sources of information about the queen. 
Berengaria was played by Laila Taher in the 1963 film &quot;Saladin&quot;. She was played by Zoë Wanamaker in the BBC 13-part drama &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Crown&quot; (1978).

<text>Cloves are the aromatic flower buds of a tree in the family Myrtaceae, Syzygium aromaticum (). They are native to the Maluku Islands, or Moluccas, in Indonesia, and are commonly used as a spice, flavoring, or fragrance in consumer products, such as toothpaste, soaps, or cosmetics. Cloves are available throughout the year owing to different harvest seasons across various countries.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;clove&quot;, first used in English in the 15th century, derives via Middle English , Anglo-French &quot;clowes de gilofre&quot; and Old French , from the Latin word &#x27; &quot;nail&quot;. The related English word &quot;gillyflower&quot;, originally meaning &quot;clove&quot;, derives via said Old French and Latin &#x27;, from the Greek &quot;clove&quot;, literally &quot;nut leaf&quot;.

==Description==
The clove tree is an evergreen that grows up to tall, with large leaves and crimson flowers grouped in terminal clusters. The flower buds initially have a pale hue, gradually turn green, then transition to a bright red when ready for harvest. Cloves are harvested at long, and consist of a long calyx that terminates in four spreading sepals, and four unopened petals that form a small central ball.

Clove &quot;stalks&quot; are slender stems of the inflorescence axis that show opposite decussate branching. Externally, they are brownish, rough, and irregularly wrinkled longitudinally with short fracture and dry, woody texture. &quot;Mother cloves (anthophylli)&quot; are the ripe fruits of cloves that are ovoid, brown berries, unilocular and one-seeded. 
&quot;Blown cloves&quot; are expanded flowers from which both corollae and stamens have been detached. &quot;Exhausted cloves&quot; have most or all the oil removed by distillation. They yield no oil and are darker in color.

== Uses ==
Cloves are used in the cuisine of Asian, African, Mediterranean, and the Near and Middle East countries, lending flavor to meats (such as baked ham), curries, and marinades, as well as fruit (such as apples, pears, and rhubarb). Cloves may be used to give aromatic and flavor qualities to hot beverages, often combined with other ingredients such as lemon and sugar. They are a common element in spice blends (as part of the Malay &quot;rempah empat beradik&quot; –&quot;four sibling spices&quot;– besides cinnamon, cardamom and star anise for example), including pumpkin pie spice and speculaas spices. 

In Mexican cuisine, cloves are best known as &quot;clavos de olor&quot;, and often accompany cumin and cinnamon. They are also used in Peruvian cuisine, in a wide variety of dishes such as &quot;carapulcra&quot; and &quot;arroz con leche&quot;. 

A major component of clove&#x27;s taste is imparted by the chemical eugenol, and the quantity of the spice required is typically small. It pairs well with cinnamon, allspice, vanilla, red wine, basil, onion, citrus peel, star anise, and peppercorns.

=== Non-culinary uses ===
It is often added to betel quids to enhance aroma while chewing. The spice is used in a type of cigarette called &quot;kretek&quot; in Indonesia. Clove cigarettes were smoked throughout Europe, Asia, and the United States. Clove cigarettes are currently classified in the United States as cigars, the result of a ban on flavored cigarettes in September 2009.

Clove essential oil may be used to inhibit mold growth on various types of foods. In addition to these non-culinary uses of clove, it can be used to protect wood in a system for cultural heritage conservation, and showed the efficacy of clove essential oil to be higher than a boron-based wood preservative. Cloves can be used to make a fragrant pomander when combined with an orange. When given as a gift in Victorian England, such a pomander indicated warmth of feeling.

=== Adverse effects and potential uses===
The use of clove for any medicinal purpose has not been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, and its use may cause adverse effects if taken orally by people with liver disease, blood clotting and immune system disorders, or food allergies.

Cloves are used in traditional medicine as an essential oil, which is intended to be an anodyne (analgesic) mainly for dental emergencies. There is evidence that clove oil containing eugenol is effective for toothache pain and other types of pain. Clove essential oil may prevent the growth of &quot;Enterococcus faecalis&quot; bacteria which may be present in an unsuccessful root canal treatment. 

One review reported the efficacy of eugenol combined with zinc oxide as an analgesic for alveolar osteitis. Studies to determine its effectiveness for fever reduction, as a mosquito repellent, and to prevent premature ejaculation have been inconclusive. It remains unproven whether blood sugar levels are reduced by cloves or clove oil. The essential oil may be used in aromatherapy.

== History ==

Until the colonial era, cloves only grew on a few islands in the Moluccas (historically called the Spice Islands), including Bacan, Makian, Moti, Ternate, and Tidore.

Cloves were first traded by the Austronesian peoples in the Austronesian maritime trade network (which began around 1500 BC, later becoming the Maritime Silk Road and part of the Spice Trade). The first notable example of modern clove farming developed on the east coast of Madagascar, and is cultivated in three separate ways, a monoculture, agricultural parklands, and agroforestry systems.

Archaeologist Giorgio Buccellati found cloves in Terqa, Syria, in a burned-down house which was dated to 1720 BC during the kingdom of Khana. This was the first evidence of cloves being used in the west before Roman times. The discovery was first reported in 1978. They reached Rome by the first century AD.

Other archeological finds of cloves include: At the Batujaya site a single clove was found in a waterlogged layer dating to between the 100s BC to 200s BC corresponding to the Buni culture phase of this site. A study at the site of Óc Eo in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam found starch grains of cloves on stone implements used in food processing. This site was occupied from the first to eighth century BC, and was a trading center for the kingdom of Funnan. Two cloves were found during archaeological excavations at the Sri Lankan city of Mantai dated to around 900–1100 AD.

Cloves are mentioned in the &quot;Ramayana&quot;. Cloves are also mentioned in the &quot;Charaka Samhita&quot;. One of the earliest examples of literary evidence of cloves in China is from the book the &quot;Han Guan Yi&quot; (Etiquettes of the Officialdom of the Han Dynasty, dating to around 200 BC). The book states a rule that ministers should suck cloves to sweeten their breath before speaking to the emperor. From Chinese records during the Song Dynasty (960 to 1279 AD) cloves were primarily imported by private ventures, called Merchant Shipping Offices, who bought goods from middlemen in the Austronesian polities of Java, Srivijaya, Champa, and Butuan. During the Yuan dynasty (1271 to 1368 AD) Chinese merchants began sending ships directly to the Moluccas to trade for cloves, and other spices.

In the Western Classical literature cloves are mentioned by Pliny the Elders&#x27; &quot;Natural History&quot;. Dioscorides mentions cloves in his book &quot;De materia medica&quot;. The &quot;Liber Pontifcalis&quot; records an endowment made by Passinopolis under Pope Sylvester I. This endowment included an Egyptian estate, its annual revenues, 150 libra (around 50 kg or 108 lb) of cloves, and other amounts of spices and papyrus. Cosmas Indicopleustis in his book &quot;Topographia Christiana&quot; outlined his travels to Sri Lanka, and recounted that the Indians said that cloves, among other products, came in from unspecified places along sea trade routes.

Cloves were also present in records in China, Sri Lanka, Southern India, Persia, and Oman by around the third century to second century BC. These mentions of &quot;cloves&quot; reported in China, South Asia, and the Middle East come from before the establishment of Southeast Asian maritime trade. But all of these are misidentifications that referred to other plants (like cassia buds, cinnamon, or nutmeg); or are imports from Maritime Southeast Asia mistakenly identified as being natively produced in these regions.

Archaeologists recovered the earliest known example of macro-botanical cloves in northwest Europe from the wreck of the Danish-Norwegian flagship, Gribshunden. The ship sank near Ronneby, Sweden in June 1495 while King Hans was sailing to political summit at Kalmar, Sweden. Exotic luxuries including cloves, ginger, peppercorns, and saffron would have impressed the noblemen and high church officials at the summit.

Cloves have been documented in the burial practices of Europeans from the late middle ages into the early modern period. During renovations on the Grote Kerk of Breda a tomb was rediscovered that was used between 1475 and 1526 AD by eight members of the house of Nassau. These burials had to be moved, but before being re-interred these burials were studied for botanical remains. The burial of Cimberga van Baden contained pollen from cloves. The Dutch Physician Pieter Van Foreest wrote down multiple recipes for embalming some of which included cloves. One of these recipes he wrote down was that used by his fellow physicians Spierinck and Goethals. An embalming jar associated with Vittoria della Rovere also contained clove pollen. This probably came from her ingestion of clove oil as a medicine in her final days. When burials needed to be moved from the church of Saint Germain in Flers, France they were also studied for botanical remains. The body and coffin of Philippe René de la Motte Ango, count of Flers who was buried in 1737 AD contained whole cloves.

During the colonial era, cloves were traded like oil, with an enforced limit on exportation. As the Dutch East India Company consolidated its control of the spice trade in the 17th century, they sought to gain a monopoly in cloves as they had in nutmeg. However, &quot;unlike nutmeg and mace, which were limited to the minute Bandas, clove trees grew all over the Moluccas, and the trade in cloves was beyond the limited policing powers of the corporation&quot;. One clove tree named &quot;Afo&quot; that experts believe is the oldest in the world on Ternate may be 350–400 years old. Tourists are told that seedlings from this very tree were stolen by a Frenchman named Pierre Poivre in 1770, transferred to the Isle de France (Mauritius), and then later to Zanzibar, which was once the world&#x27;s largest producer of cloves.

Current leaders in clove production are Indonesia, Madagascar, Tanzania, Sri Lanka, and Comoros. Indonesia is the largest clove producer, but only about 10-15% of its cloves production is exported, and domestic shortfalls must sometimes be filled with imports from Madagascar. The modern province of Maluku remains the largest source of cloves in Indonesia with around 15% of national production, although provinces comprising the island of Sulawesi produced over 40% collectively.

== Phytochemicals ==
Eugenol comprises 72–90% of the essential oil extracted from cloves, and is the compound most responsible for clove aroma. Complete extraction occurs at 80 minutes in pressurized water at . Ultrasound-assisted and microwave-assisted extraction methods provide more rapid extraction rates with lower energy costs.

Other phytochemicals of clove oil include acetyl eugenol, beta-caryophyllene, vanillin, crategolic acid, tannins, such as bicornin, gallotannic acid, methyl salicylate, the flavonoids eugenin, kaempferol, rhamnetin, and eugenitin, triterpenoids such as oleanolic acid, stigmasterol, and campesterol and several sesquiterpenes. Although eugenol has not been classified for its potential toxicity, it was shown to be toxic to test organisms in concentrations of 50, 75, and 100 mg per liter.

<text>Santa Ana (Spanish for ) is a city in and the county seat of Orange County, California, United States. Located in the Greater Los Angeles region of Southern California, the city&#x27;s population was 310,227 at the 2020 census. As of 2023, Santa Ana is the third most populous city in Orange County (after Anaheim and Irvine), the 14th-most populous city in California, and the 65th most populous city in the United States. Santa Ana is a major regional economic and cultural hub for the Orange Coast.

In 1810, the Spanish governor of California granted Rancho Santiago de Santa Ana to José Antonio Yorba. Following the Mexican War of Independence, the Yorba family rancho was enlarged, becoming one of the largest and most valuable in the region and home to a diverse Californio community. Following the American Conquest of California, the rancho was sold to the Sepúlveda family, who subsequently lost their land claim. In 1869, William H. Spurgeon then purchased the rancho and formally founded the modern city of Santa Ana.

Approximately four-fifths Hispanic or Latino, Santa Ana has been characterized by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as the &quot;face of a new California, a state where Latinos have more influence in everyday life—electorally, culturally and demographically—than almost anywhere else in the country.&quot;

==History==

Members of the Tongva and Juaneño/Luiseño are indigenous to the area. The Tongva called the Santa Ana area &quot;Hotuuk.&quot; The village of Pajbenga was located at modern day Santa Ana along the Santa Ana River.

===Spanish and Mexican eras===
After the 1769 expedition of Gaspar de Portolá out of Mexico City, then capital of New Spain, Friar Junípero Serra named the area Vallejo de Santa Ana (Valley of Saint Anne, or Santa Ana Valley). On November 1, 1776, Mission San Juan Capistrano was established within this valley.

In 1810, the first year of the Mexican War of Independence, Jose Antonio Yorba, a sergeant of the Spanish army, was granted land that he called Rancho Santiago de Santa Ana. Yorba&#x27;s rancho included the lands where the cities of Olive, Orange, Irvine, Yorba Linda, Villa Park, Santa Ana, Tustin, Costa Mesa and unincorporated El Modena, and Santa Ana Heights, are today. This rancho was the only land grant in Orange County granted under Spanish Rule. Surrounding land grants in Orange County were granted after Mexican Independence by the new government.

After the Mexican-American War ended in 1848, Alta California became part of the United States and American settlers arrived in this area.

===Post-Conquest era===
Santa Ana was listed as a township of Los Angeles County in the 1860 and 1870 census, with an area encompassing most of what is now northern and central Orange County. It had a population of 756 in 1860 and 880 in 1870. The Anaheim district was enumerated separately from Santa Ana in 1870.

Claimed in 1869 by Kentuckian William H. Spurgeon on land obtained from the descendants of Jose Antonio Yorba, Santa Ana was incorporated as a city in 1886 with a population of 2000 and in 1889 became the seat of the newly formed Orange County.

In 1877, the Southern Pacific Railroad built a branch line from Los Angeles to Santa Ana, which offered free right of way, land for a depot, and $10,000 in cash to the railroad in exchange for terminating the line in Santa Ana and not neighboring Tustin. In 1887, the California Central Railway (which became a subsidiary of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway the following year) broke the Southern Pacific&#x27;s local monopoly on rail travel, offering service between Los Angeles and San Diego by way of Santa Ana as a major intermediate station.

In 1890, whites made up 71 percent of the city&#x27;s population, most of whom migrated to Santa Ana from confederate states following the American Civil War in search of real estate ventures and other economic opportunities.

===20th century===

By 1905, the Los Angeles Interurban Railway, a predecessor to the Pacific Electric Railway, extended from Los Angeles to Santa Ana, running along Fourth Street downtown. Firestone Boulevard, the first direct automobile route between Los Angeles and Santa Ana, opened in 1935; it was enlarged into the Santa Ana Freeway in 1953. The Pacific Electric Santa Ana Line ran from 1905 to 1958.

Santa Ana was the home of the original Glenn L. Martin aviation company, founded in 1912 before merging with the Wright Company in 1916. Later, Glenn Luther Martin created a second company of the same name in Cleveland, Ohio which eventually merged with the Lockheed Corporation to form the largest defense contractor in the world, Lockheed Martin.

Although there was a significant wave of Mexican migration to the city following the 1910 Mexican Revolution, the city remained majority white in 1939.

During World War II, the Santa Ana Army Air Base was built as a training center for the United States Army Air Forces. The base was responsible for continued population growth in Santa Ana and the rest of Orange County as many veterans moved to the area to raise families after the end of the war.

Santa Ana was at the center of Orange County&#x27;s economic boom in the 1950s with its agricultural and defense industries. However, most of this prosperity was only experienced by the city&#x27;s white residents, while Latinos did not similarly benefit. Instead, economic inequality between the two groups rapidly increased during this time.

In 1958, the Honer Plaza and Bullock&#x27;s Fashion Square malls opened and would supplant Downtown Santa Ana, with its department stores such as Rankin&#x27;s, Ward&#x27;s, Penney&#x27;s and Buffums. Fashion Square was completely renovated and became MainPlace Mall in 1987.

=== &quot;Latino&quot; city ===
By the 1970s, Santa Ana was becoming an increasingly Latino city, with white flight to surrounding suburbs coinciding with the city&#x27;s downtown becoming increasingly frequented by Latinos. This changed perceptions of the city and its economic value, with property values dropping significantly by 1974, while surrounding cities of Laguna Beach, Newport Beach, and Villa Park increased in value.

Santa Ana entered the 1980s as a city of equal numbers of whites and Latinos. What had been the white commercial center of the city, Fourth Street, was now a street of Latino businesses and character. Latino immigrant and working-class families could now be found in every neighborhood of the city, rather than in just a few ethnic enclaves, as they were previously. &quot;Santa Ana&quot; became more often referred to as &quot;Santana&quot; and &quot;Fourth Street&quot; as &quot;La Cuatro.&quot;

Having been a charter city since November 11, 1952, the citizens of Santa Ana amended the charter in November 1988 to provide for the direct election of the Mayor who until that point had been appointed from the council membership. Miguel A. Pulido was the first mayor of Latino descent in the city&#x27;s history and the first Mayor directly elected by the voters.

Since the 1980s, Santa Ana has been characterized by an effort to revitalize the downtown area which had declined in influence, even as it had become a dynamic commercial and entertainment center for working-class Latinos. The Santa Ana Artist&#x27;s Village was created around Cal State Fullerton&#x27;s Grand Central Art Center to attract artists and young professionals to live-work lofts and new businesses. The process continued into 2009 with the reopening of the historic Yost Theater.

In the 2010s, gentrification became a larger concern of Santa Ana residents, with its roots starting in the 1990s. Despite strong Latino political representation, gentrification efforts have increasingly displaced the Mexican immigrant presence in the downtown area of the city in favor of outsiders. Primarily Spanish-speaking businesses that served immigrant populations have been demolished in favor of arts projects to draw in outside investment, which bring clientele who further question why Spanish-speaking businesses are present, leading to a cycle of displacement.

Residents formed a social movement to address lead concentrations in lower-income areas of the city. A 2020 study found that areas of Santa Ana with a median income below $50,000 had five times higher lead concentrations than higher-income areas of the city, which is particularly a concern for children. Residents continue to advocate for environmental justice in the city.

==Geography==

Santa Ana is nested on flat, low-lying plains with little land elevation change. Running through the west end of the city is the mostly channelized Santa Ana River, which is also largely seasonal due to the construction of the Prado Dam and Seven Oaks Dam. The river caused several severe floods in the 20th century, and is a continued threat despite the existence of the dams.

===Cityscape===
Now fully developed, Santa Ana has several distinct districts. The core of the city is the downtown area, which contains both retail and housing, as well as the Santa Ana Civic Center, which is a dense campus of administrative buildings for both the city and the county of Orange. The civic center is also home to the Ronald Reagan Federal Building and Courthouse. Several historic homes dating from the late 1800s can be found as well, and their preservation is a key issue as development of the downtown area continues.

North of downtown is the &quot;Midtown&quot; district along Main St., home to entertainment destinations such as the Bowers Museum, MainPlace Mall, and the Discovery Science Center.

Near the intersection of the Santa Ana Freeway and the Costa Mesa Freeway is the newly designated &quot;Metro East&quot; area, which the city council has envisioned as a secondary mixed-use development district. Currently the area is occupied by several office towers, but little retail or housing. Also on the east side of the city is the Santa Ana Zoo, notable for its collection of monkeys and species from South and Central America.

The southeast end of the city is part of the South Coast Metro area, which is shared with the city of Costa Mesa. South Coast Plaza, a major shopping center, is the primary destination of this area, which also contains several high-rise office and apartment buildings. Yokohama Tire Corporation&#x27;s United States headquarters are located at 1 MacArthur Place in the South Coast Metro area of Santa Ana, and Banc of California&#x27;s headquarters relocated from the neighboring city of Irvine.

===Climate===
Santa Ana experiences a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen: BSh), with hot, dry summers and mild winters with moderate rainfall. Rainfall averages about per year, most of which falls from November through April. There are an average of 35 days with measurable precipitation annually.

<text>Maui (; Hawaiian: ) is the second largest island in the Hawaiian archipelago, at 727.2 square miles (1,883 km2). It is the 17th-largest in the United States. Maui is one of Maui County&#x27;s five islands, along with Molokai, Lānai, Kahoolawe, and Molokini.

In 2020, Maui had a population of 168,307, the third-highest of the Hawaiian Islands, behind Oahu and Hawaii Island. Kahului is the largest census-designated place (CDP) on the island, with a 2020 population of 28,219. It is Maui&#x27;s commercial and financial hub. Wailuku is the county seat and was the third-largest CDP . Other significant populated areas include Kīhei (including Wailea and Makena in the Kihei Town CDP), Lāhainā (including Kāanapali and Kapalua in the Lāhainā Town CDP), and Upcountry Maui (including Makawao, Pukalani, Kula, and Ulupalakua), although Lāhainā was mostly destroyed by fire in 2023.

Once part of Maui Nui, Maui is dominated by two volcanic features: Haleakalā in the southeast, and the West Maui Mountains in the northwest. The two are connected by an isthmus about six miles wide that gives the island its nickname, the Valley Isle.

Maui has a significant tourism industry, with nearly three million visitors in 2022. A 2023 report based on 2017 data concluded that nearly 40% of Maui County&#x27;s economy was tourism-related. Popular tourist destinations include the resorts in the Kāanapali, Kapalua, and Kihei/Wailea/Makena areas; Hāna and the Hana Highway; Iao Valley; Haleakalā National Park; and its many beaches.
==Etymology==
Native Hawaiian tradition gives the origin of the island&#x27;s name in the legend of Hawaiiloa, the navigator credited with discovering the Hawaiian Islands. According to that tradition, Hawaiiloa named the island after his son, who in turn was named for the demigod Māui. Maui&#x27;s previous name was Ihikapalaumaewa. Maui Island is also called the &quot;Valley Isle&quot; for the large isthmus connecting its northwestern and southeastern volcanic masses.

==Geology ==

Like all other Hawaiian Islands, Maui was formed from the volcanism associated with the Hawaii hotspot.

The islands&#x27; volcanic cones are formed from basalt, a dark, iron-rich/silica-poor rock, which poured out of thousands of vents as fluid lava over millions of years. Some of its volcanoes were close enough to each other that lava flows on their flanks overlapped, merging into a single island. Maui is one such &quot;volcanic doublet,&quot; formed from two shield volcanoes that overlapped to form Maui.

The older, western volcano has eroded considerably, forming the peaks of the West Maui Mountains (in Hawaiian, Mauna Kahalawai). Puʻu Kukui is the highest, at . The larger, younger volcano to the east, Haleakalā, rises to above sea level, and measures from seafloor to summit. The eastern flanks of both volcanoes are cut by deeply incised valleys and steep-sided ravines that run downslope to the rocky, windswept shoreline. The isthmus was formed by sandy erosional deposits.

Maui&#x27;s last eruption (originating in Haleakalā&#x27;s Southwest Rift Zone) likely occurred between 1480 and 1600; the resulting lava flows are located at Cape Kīnau between Āhihi Bay and La Perouse Bay. Haleakalā is dormant, but not extinct.

Maui is part of a much larger unit, Maui Nui, that includes the islands of Lānai, Kahoolawe, Molokai, and the now submerged Penguin Bank. During periods of reduced sea level, including as recently as 200,000 years ago, the channels between them become exposed and join the island into a single landmass.

== Climate ==
The climate is characterized by a two-season year, tropical and uniform temperatures at any given elevation, geographic differences in rainfall, high relative humidity, extensive cloud formations (except on the leeward coasts and at the highest elevations), and dominant trade wind flow (especially at lower elevations).

Maui has a range of climatic conditions and weather patterns:

* Half of the land is within of the coast, creating a strong marine influence.
* Macro weather patterns are typically determined by elevation and orientation towards the trade winds (the prevailing air flow from the northeast).
* Maui&#x27;s rugged, irregular topography drives variations in conditions. Air swept inland on the trade winds is redirected by the mountains, valleys, and vast open slopes. This three-dimensional flow of air produces variations in wind speed, cloud formation, and rainfall.

Maui displays diverse climatic conditions, each of which is specific to a sub-region. These sub-regions are defined by major physiographic features (such as mountains and valleys) and by location on the windward or leeward side.

Maui&#x27;s daytime temperatures average between and year round, while evening temperatures are about cooler in the more humid windward areas, about cooler in the drier leeward areas, and cooler still in higher elevations.

An exception to the normal pattern is the occasional winter Kona storm that brings rainfall to the South and West areas accompanied by high southwesterly winds (opposite of the prevailing trade wind direction).

=== Microclimates ===

Maui has examples of all microclimates, each typical to specific locations.
* Windward lowlands – Below on north-to-northeast sides. Roughly perpendicular to the trade winds. Moderately rainy; frequent trade wind-induced showers. Skies are often cloudy to partly cloudy. Air temperatures are relatively more uniform (and mild).
* Leeward lowlands – Daytime temperatures are higher and nighttime temperatures are lower than in windward locations. Dry weather is prevalent, except for sporadic showers that drift over the mountains to windward and during short-duration storms.
* Interior lowlands – Intermediate conditions, often sharing characteristics of other lowland sub-regions. Occasional intense afternoon showers from clouds that form due to local daytime heating.
* Leeward side high-altitude mountain slopes with high rainfall – Extensive cloud cover and rainfall all year long. Mild temperatures are prevalent, but humidity is higher than in any other sub-region.
* Leeward side lower mountain slopes – Rainfall is higher than on leeward lowlands but much less than at similar altitudes on the windward side; however, maximum rainfall usually occurs leeward of the crests of lower mountains. Temperatures are higher than on the rainy slopes of the windward sides of mountains; cloud cover is almost as extensive.
* High mountains – Above about on Haleakalā, rainfall decreases rapidly with elevation. Relative humidity may be ten percent or less. The state&#x27;s lowest temperatures are experienced in this region: air temperatures below freezing are common.

 These microclimates help to define the major regions: Central Maui; leeward South Maui and West Maui; windward North Shore and East Maui; and Upcountry.

* Central Maui consists primarily of Kahului and Wailuku, and occupies the flat isthmus between the West Maui Mountains and Haleakalā. Kahului is the center of the island and tends to keep steady, high temperatures throughout the year. The Kahului microclimate can be muggy, but usually feels relatively dry and is often breezy. The Wailuku area is closer to the West Maui Mountain range. There, rainfall is greater throughout the year and humidity is higher.
* South Maui (Kihei, Wailea, and Makena) and West Maui (Lahaina, Kaanapali, and Kapalua) are both on the leeward side. These areas are typically drier, with higher daytime temperatures (up to ), and the least amount of rainfall. (An exception is the high-altitude, unpopulated West Maui summit, which boasts up to of rainfall per year on its north and east side.)

* The North Shore (Paia and Haiku) and East Maui (Keanae, Hana, and Kipahulu) are both on the windward side. Facing the prevailing, northeast trade winds, these areas have heavier rainfall levels, which increase considerably at higher elevations.
* Upcountry Maui is the name for the sloping area on the western face of Haleakalā, including the towns of Makawao, Pukalani, and Kula. This area ranges from to , and the climate tends toward mild heat (between and ) during the day and cool evenings. The higher the elevation, the cooler the evenings: during Maui&#x27;s winter, Upper Kula can be as cold as in the early morning hours and the Haleakalā summit can dip below freezing and become covered in snow.

=== Rainfall ===
Showers are common; while some of these are heavy, the majority are light and brief. Thunder and lightning are rare, even during intense storms. Throughout the lowlands, summer trade winds produce a drier season. Annual rainfall averages in leeward coastal areas, such as the shoreline from Maalaea Bay to Kaupo. At the other extreme, the average exceeds along the lower windward slopes of Haleakalā, particularly along Hāna Highway. Big Bog, a spot on the edge of Haleakalā National Park overlooking Hana at about elevation had an estimated mean annual rainfall of over the 30-year period of 1978 to 2007. If the islands of Hawaii did not exist, the average annual rainfall on the same patch of water would be about . Instead, the mountainous topography induces an average of about .In the lowlands, rainfall is most likely to occur during night or morning hours, and least likely in mid-afternoon. The most pronounced daily variations in rainfall occur during the summer because summer rainfall generally consists of night-time trade wind showers. Winter rainfall in the lowlands is the result of storm activity, which is as likely to occur in the daytime as at night. Rainfall variability is far greater during the winter when occasional storms contribute appreciably to rainfall totals. Such wide swings in rainfall produce occasional droughts, sometimes causing economic losses. These occur when winter rains fail to produce sufficient significant rain, impacting normally dry areas outside the trade winds that depend on them the most. The winter of 2011–2012 produced extreme drought on the leeward sides Maui, and some other islands.

===Natural history===
Maui is home to a large rainforest on the northeastern flanks of Haleakalā, which serves as the drainage basin for that side.

Maui is home to many coral reefs. However, many have been damaged by pollution, run-off, and tourism, although sea turtles, dolphins, and Hawaii&#x27;s celebrated tropical fish remain abundant. Leeward Maui once boasted a dry cloud forest, but this was destroyed by human activities over the last three hundred years.

===Wildlife===
Maui is the leading whale-watching center in the Hawaiian Islands for the humpback whales who winter in Maui County&#x27;s sheltered Auau Channel. These mammals migrate approximately from Alaskan waters each autumn and spend November–April mating and birthing in the warm waters. They are typically sighted in pods: small groups of several adults, or groups of a mother, her calf, and a few suitors. Humpbacks are an endangered species protected by U.S. federal and Hawaii state law. An estimated 21,000-26,000 humpbacks live in North Pacific waters. Although they face many dangers, due to pollution, commercial vessels, and military sonar testing, their numbers have increased rapidly in recent years, estimated at 7% growth per year.

Birdlife lacks the concentration of endemic species found in some other Hawaiian islands. As recently as 200,000 years ago Maui was part of Maui Nui, thus reducing the odds that birds or other species would be endemic to any single one of these. Although Molokai had several endemic bird species, in modern times Maui Nui&#x27;s other islands host little endemic birdlife. During and after the Maui Nui period, Maui hosted a species of moa-nalo (also found on Molokai, Lānai, and Kahoolawe), a species of harrier (the wood harrier, shared with Molokai), an undescribed sea eagle (Maui only), and three species of ground-dwelling flightless ibis (&quot;Apteribis sp.&quot;), plus other species. Today, Maui&#x27;s most notable surviving endemic birds are probably the ʻAkohekohe (&quot;Palmeria dolei&quot;) and the Maui parrotbill (&quot;Pseudonestor xanthophrys&quot;), also known as &quot;Kiwikiu&quot;, both of which are critically endangered and only found in an alpine forest on the windward slopes of Haleakalā.

Conservation efforts have examined how to mitigate female parrotbill mortality since that is s a key driving factor driving population decline. The parrotbill lacks resistance to mosquito-born diseases, particularly avian malaria, so only forests above 1500 meters of elevation provide refuge. The habitat was undergoing restoration in east Maui as of 2018. As Maui&#x27;s human population grew, previously undeveloped areas that provided a refuge decreased in size. More than 250 species of local flora are federally listed as endangered or threatened. Birds found on other islands as well as Maui include the ʻIʻiwi (&quot;Drepanis coccinea&quot;], ʻApapane (&quot;Himatione sanguinea&quot;), Hawaiʻi ʻAmakihi (&quot;Chlorodrepanis virens),&quot; as Maui ʻAlauahio (&quot;Paroreomyza montana&quot;) well as the Nene (&quot;Branta sandvicensis&quot;, Hawaii&#x27;s state bird), Hawaiian coot (&quot;Fulica alai&quot;), Hawaiian stilt (&quot;Himantopus mexicanus knudseni&quot;).

In 2024, Haleakalā National Park began to employ the incompatible insect technique to reduce the park&#x27;s mosquito population.

Maui is also home to the Hawaiian hoary bat, Hawaii&#x27;s only native terrestrial mammal. Marine mammals notably include spinner, bottlenose, and spotted dolphins.

==History==

Polynesians from Tahiti were Maui&#x27;s original inhabitants. They introduced the kapu system, a strict social order that affected all aspects of life and became the core of Hawaiian culture. Modern Hawaiian history began in the mid-18th century. Kamehameha I, king Hawaiʻi island, invaded Maui in 1790 and fought the inconclusive Battle of Kepaniwai. He returned to Hawaiʻi to battle a rival, subduing Maui a few years later.

=== European Contact ===
On November 26, 1778, explorer James Cook became the first European to see Maui. Cook never set foot on the island, because he was unable to find a suitable landing. The first European to come ashore was French admiral Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse, who landed on the shores of what became La Perouse Bay on May 29, 1786. More Europeans followed: traders, whalers, loggers (e.g., of sandalwood) and missionaries. The latter began to arrive from New England in 1823, settling in Lahaina, at that time Hawaii&#x27;s capitol. Missionaries taught reading and writing, devised the Hawaiian alphabet in order to translate a Bible into Hawaiian, operated a printing press in Lahaina, and began recording the islands&#x27; history, which had been transmitted only orally. The missionaries both altered and preserved the native culture. The religious work altered the culture while the literacy efforts preserved history and language. Missionaries started the first school in Lahaina, Lahainaluna Mission School, which opened in 1831 and still exists.

=== Whaling ===

At the height of the whaling era (1843–1860), Lahaina was a major center. In one season over 400 ships visited with up to 100 anchored at one time in Lāhainā Roads. Ships tended to stay for weeks rather than days, fostering extended drinking and the rise of prostitution, against which the missionaries battled. Whaling declined steeply at the end of the 19th century as petroleum replaced whale oil.

Along with the rest of Hawaii, Maui was part of the Hawaiian Kingdom, the Republic of Hawaii, Hawaiian territory, and the state of Hawaii.

In 1937, Vibora Luviminda trade union conducted the final ethnic strike action in the Hawaiian Islands against four Maui sugarcane plantations, demanding higher wages and the dismissal of five foremen. Manuel Fagel and nine other strike leaders were arrested, and charged with kidnapping a worker. Fagel spent four months in jail while the strike continued. Eventually, Vibora Luviminda made its point and the workers won a 15% increase in wages after 85 days on strike, but no written contract was signed.

=== World War II ===
Maui was involved in the Pacific Theater of World War II as a staging center, training base, and rest and relaxation site. At the peak in 1943–1944, more than 100,000 soldiers were based there. The main base of the 4th Marine Division was in Haiku. Beaches were used to practice landings and train in marine demolition and sabotage.

== Development ==

The island experienced rapid population growth through 2007. At the time, Kīhei was one of the most rapidly growing towns in the United States. The island attracted many retirees, with accompanying service providers. Population growth produced strains, including traffic, housing cost/availability, and access to water.

In the 2000s, controversies raged over whether to allow continued real-estate development. Vacation rentals in residential neighborhoods became a flashpoint - many were unpermitted, and were later closed after enforcement escalated. The Hawaii Superferry briefly offered interisland service, before it was banned for not having completed an EIS.

In 2016, Maui residents convinced officials to switch to organic pesticides for highway applications after they learned that label requirements for glyphosate formulations had not been followed.

=== Water supply ===

The new millennium brought droughts, increasing pressure on the Īao aquifer, with withdrawals rising above 18 million U.S. gallons (68,000 m3) per day. Recent estimates indicate that Maui has a potential supply of potable water around 476 million U.S. gallons (1,800,000 m3) per day, virtually all of which drains into the ocean.

Water for agriculture comes mostly from East Maui streams, routed through a network of tunnels and ditches dug by Chinese laborers in the 19th century.

In 2006, Paia petitioned the county to avoid mixing in treated water from wells known to be contaminated with 1,2-dibromoethane and 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane from former pineapple cultivation. Agriculture companies were released from liability for these chemicals. In 2009, the Office of Hawaiian Affairs and others successfully argued in court that sugar companies should reduce the amount of water they take from four streams.

==Economy==
Tourism is Maui&#x27;s major industry. Other large sectors include development, retail, business services, health care, and government. Maui has a growing presence in agriculture and information technology.

Unemployment tends to be well below the US average, e.g., 1.7% in December 2006, rising to only 9% in March 2009 before falling to 2.1% in January, 2018. The 2023 fires upended that norm, raising unemployment above the Hawaii and US figures.

===Agriculture===
Maui&#x27;s primary agriculture products are corn and other seeds, fruits, cattle, wine, and vegetables. Specific products include coffee, macadamia nuts, papaya, flowers and fresh pineapple. In 1974, Emil Tedeschi of the Napa Valley winegrower family of Calistoga, California, established the first Hawaiian commercial winery, the Tedeschi Winery (later Maui Wine) at Ulupalakua Ranch, initially focused on pineapple wine.

Historically, Maui&#x27;s primary products were sugar and pineapple. Maui Land &amp; Pineapple Company and Hawaiian Commercial and Sugar Company (HC&amp;S, a subsidiary of Alexander and Baldwin Company) dominated agricultural activity. In 2016, sugar production ended. Haliimaile Pineapple Co. grows pineapple on former Maui Land &amp; Pineapple Co. land.

In November 2014, a Maui County referendum enacted a moratorium on genetically engineered crops. Shortly thereafter Monsanto and other agribusinesses obtained a court injunction suspending the moratorium.

In 2018, Canadian pension fund Public Sector Pension Investment Board purchased A&amp;B&#x27;s Maui farmlands (41,000 acres) and contracted with Mahi Pono, a subsidiary of Trinitas Partners to return these fallow lands to agriculture. Mahi Pono also has a controlling interest in Maui Cattle Company.

===Information technology===
Most technology organizations that are located on the island occupy the Maui Research &amp; Technology Park which is located in Kihei. This includes the Maui Research and Technology Center and the Pacific Disaster Center. It is a program of the High Technology Development Corporation, an agency of the State of Hawaii, whose focus is to facilitate the growth of Hawaii&#x27;s commercial high-technology sector.

===Astrophysics===
Maui is an important center for advanced astronomical research. The Haleakalā Observatory was Hawaii&#x27;s first astronomical research and development facility, operating at the Maui Space Surveillance Site (MSSS) electro-optical facility. &quot;At the 10,023-foot summit of the long-dormant volcano Haleakalā, operational satellite tracking facilities are co-located with a research and development facility providing data acquisition and communication support. The high elevation, dry climate, and freedom from light pollution offer virtually year-round observation of satellites, missiles, man-made orbital debris, and astronomical objects.&quot;

==Sports==
===Snorkeling/diving===

Snorkeling and diving are popular activities on Maui, with over 30 beaches and bays and at Molokini. Maui&#x27;s trade winds tend to come from the northeast, making the most popular places to snorkel on the sheltered south and west shores. Maui&#x27;s ocean water is especially clear due in part to its isolation in the Central Pacific.

===Windsurfing===
Maui is a well-known destination for windsurfing. Kanaha Beach Park is a very well-known windsurfing spot and may have stand-up paddle boarders or surfers if there are waves and no wind. Windsurfing has evolved on Maui since the early 1980s when it was recognized as an ideal location to test equipment and publicize the sport.

===Surfing===
Surfing is one of Hawaii&#x27;s most popular sports. Ho&#x27;okipa Beach Park is one of Maui&#x27;s most famous surfing and windsurfing spots. Other frequently surfed areas include Slaughterhouse Beach, Honolua Bay, Pe&#x27;ahi (Jaws), and Fleming Beach. The north side absorbs the most swell during the winter season and the south and west in the summertime. Due to island blocking, summer south swells tend to be weak and rare. Standup paddleboarding is popular across Maui.

===Kitesurfing===
Kitesurfing is popular, particularly at Kanaha Beach Park.

=== Wing foiling ===
Wing foiling is the newest way to ride the wind, and is particularly practiced at Kahului Harbor.

==Tourism==
The main tourist attractions are Hāna and Haleakalā National Park. Hāna Highway runs along the east coast, crossing many streams and passing black sand beaches and waterfalls. Haleakalā National Park is home to Haleakalā, a dormant volcano. Another attraction is the Maui Ocean Center aquarium in Ma&#x27;alaea.

However, visitors spend most of their time at and around the resorts in West Maui (Kāanapali, Nāpili-Honokōwai, Kahana, Napili, Kapalua) and South Maui (Kīhei, Wailea-Mākena). Cruise ships dock at Kahului Harbor. Smaller ports at Lahaina Harbor (temporarily closed) and Maalaea Harbor (located between Lahaina and Kihei). The town of Lahaina was a popular attraction until the 2023 fires, but is closed indefinitely.

While winning travel industry awards as &quot;Best Island In The World&quot; in recent years some locals and environmentalists criticized what the saw as overdevelopment. Activist groups such as Save Makena have taken the government to court to protect local citizens&#x27; rights.

==Transport==

The Maui Bus is a county-funded program that provides transportation around the island for nominal fares.

===Airports===

Three airports provide air service to Maui:

* Hana Airport provides regional service to eastern Maui.
* Kahului Airport in central Maui is the primary commercial airport.
* Kapalua Airport provides regional service to western Maui.

==Healthcare==
Malama I Ke Ola Health Center and Maui Memorial Medical Center (MMMC) are the only acute care hospital in Maui County. Kula Hospital is a critical access hospital located on the southern half in the rural town of Kula. Kula Hospital is an MMMC affiliate. Although not technically a hospital or emergency room, Hana Health Clinic (or Hana Medical Center), works in cooperation with American Medical Response and MMMC to stabilize and transport patients with emergent medical conditions. These facilities operate 24/7.

==International relations==
Maui is twinned with:

* Funchal, Madeira, Portugal
* Arequipa, Perú
* Quezon City, Philippines, since 6 March 1970

<doc id="70961" wikidata="Q201026" url="?curid=70961" title="Kauai">
<text>Kauai (), anglicized as Kauai ( or ), is one of the main Hawaiian Islands. 

It has an area of 562.3 square miles (1,456.4 km2), making it the fourth-largest of the islands and the 21st-largest island in the United States. Kauaʻi lies 73 miles (117 km) northwest of Oʻahu, across the Kauaʻi Channel. The island&#x27;s 2020 population was 73,298.

Styling itself the &quot;Garden Isle&quot;, Kauaʻi is the site of Waimea Canyon State Park and Nā Pali Coast State Park. It forms the bulk of Kauai County, which also includes the small nearby islands of Kaʻula, Lehua, and Niʻihau.

==Etymology and language==
Hawaiian narrative derives the name&#x27;s origin from the legend of Hawaiʻiloa, the Polynesian navigator credited with discovering the Hawaiian Islands. The story relates that he named the island after a favorite son; a possible translation of Kauaʻi is &quot;place around the neck&quot;, describing how a father would carry his child. Another possible translation is &quot;food season&quot;.

Kauaʻi was known for its distinct dialect of the Hawaiian language, which still survives on Niʻihau. While the dominant dialect is based on that of Hawaiʻi island, which has no sound, the Kauaʻi dialect had this sound. This happened because the Kauaʻi dialect had retained the old Polynesian sound, replaced in the &quot;standard&quot; Hawaiʻi dialect by . This difference applies to all words with these sounds, so the Kauaian name for Kauaʻi was pronounced &quot;Tauaʻi&quot;, and Kapaʻa was pronounced &quot;Tapaʻa&quot;.

==History==
===Settlement===
It is uncertain when humans discovered the Hawaiian islands. Early archaeological studies suggested that Polynesian explorers from the Marquesas Islands or Society Islands may have arrived as early as 600 C.E., possibly with a second wave arriving from Tahiti around 1100 CE. Later analyses suggest that the first settlers arrived around 900–1200 C.E.

===Arrival of James Cook===

In January 1778, British navigator James Cook made the first recorded contact between any European and the indigenous people of the Hawaiian Islands when he arrived at Kauai by accident while crossing the Pacific during his third voyage of exploration. The British immediately observed similarities in language and culture between the Kauaians and the parts of Polynesia with which they were already familiar, such as Tahiti. After some Kauaians were persuaded to board his ship, Cook later wrote:

Later, while investigating a location for the ships to anchor, a shore party was mobbed by a crowd, a shot was fired, and one Kauaian was killed. The next day, January 20, 1778, the two ships anchored in Waimea Bay on the southwest coast, where the expedition spent days obtaining fresh water and trading for fresh food. The local people especially valued iron: even small amounts, such as a single nail, could be traded for plentiful food supplies. Within two weeks, Cook left the vicinity of the Hawaiian Islands to continue his original mission.

===Cession to the Kingdom of Hawaii ===
At the time of Cook&#x27;s visit, the Hawaiian islands comprised several kingdoms. By 1795, the king of Hawaii Island, Kamehameha I, had established the Kingdom of Hawaii, uniting most of the islands, but Kauai remained independent. Kamehameha tried to conquer Kauai in 1796, but stormy seas caused the attack from Oahu to be canceled and he was afterward distracted by events elsewhere. By 1803, Kauai was ruled by Kaumualiʻi, who maintained his independence from the Kingdom of Hawaii. A second invasion of Kauai from Oahu was planned but this too was canceled after an epidemic broke out among Kamehameha&#x27;s forces. In 1810, a diplomatic agreement was reached whereby Kaumualiʻi agreed to be Kamehameha&#x27;s vassal, and to cede Kauai to the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi upon his death by making Kamehameha&#x27;s son his heir.

===Schäffer affair===

The Schäffer affair was a diplomatic episode instigated in 1815 by Georg Anton Schäffer, a German working with the Russian American Company. While at Kauai in 1816, Schäffer involved Kaumualiʻi in &quot;a treasonable design&quot; whereby Kauai would accept the protection of the Russian Empire in exchange for exclusive trading privileges. In 1817, a fort was built at Waimea and a Russian flag raised over it. But on Kamehameha&#x27;s orders, and persuaded by other foreign traders, Kaumualiʻi abandoned his relationship with Schäffer and forced the Russians to leave Kauai.

=== Plantations ===
From the 1830s till the mid-20th century, plantations of sugarcane were Kauaʻi&#x27;s most important industry. In 1835, the first sugarcane plantation was founded on Kauaʻi, and for the next century the industry dominated Hawaiʻi&#x27;s economy. Kauaʻi&#x27;s last sugarcane plantation, the 118-year-old Gay &amp; Robinson Plantation, stopped planting sugar in 2008.

===Old Sugar Mill of Koloa===

In 1835, Old Koloa Town opened a sugar mill. From 1906 to 1934 the office of County Clerk was held by John Mahiʻai Kāneakua, who had been active in attempts to restore Queen Liliuokalani to the throne after the U.S. takeover of Hawaiʻi in 1893.

===Valdemar Knudsen===
Valdemar Emil Knudsen was a Norwegian who arrived on Kauai in 1857. Knudsen, or &quot;Kanuka&quot;, originally managed Grove Farm in Koloa. He later sought a warmer land and purchased the leases to Mana and Kekaha, where he became a successful sugarcane plantation owner. He settled in Waiawa, between Mana and Kekaha, immediately across the channel from Niʻihau Island. His son, Eric Alfred Knudsen, was born in Waiawa.

Knudsen was appointed land administrator by King Kamehameha for an area covering 400 km2, and was given the title &quot;konohiki&quot; as well as a position as a noble under the king. Knudsen, who spoke fluent Hawaiian, later became an elected representative and an influential politician.

Knudsen lends his name to the Knudsen Gap, a narrow pass between Hã’upu Ridge and the Kahili Ridge. Its primary function was as a sugar farm.

==Geography==

The five-million-year-old island, the oldest of the main islands (Niʻihau is older), was formed volcanically as the Pacific Plate passed over the Hawaii hotspot. It consists of an eroded shield volcano with a diameter summit caldera and two flanking calderas. Rejuvenation of the volcano 0.6–1.40 million years ago left lava flows and cones over the eastern two-thirds of the island.

Kauaʻi&#x27;s highest peak is Kawaikini, at . The second-highest is Mount Waiʻaleʻale, near the center of the island, above sea level. One of the wettest spots on earth, with an annual average rainfall of , is on the east side of Mount Waiʻaleʻale. The rain has eroded deep valleys in the central mountains, carving out canyons with many scenic waterfalls. On the west side of the island, Waimea town is at the mouth of the Waimea River, whose flow formed Waimea Canyon, one of the world&#x27;s most scenic canyons, which is part of Waimea Canyon State Park. At deep, Waimea Canyon is often called &quot;The Grand Canyon of the Pacific&quot;. Kokeo Point lies on the island&#x27;s south side. The Na Pali Coast is an isolated center for recreation, including kayaking along the beaches and hiking on the trail along the coastal cliffs. The headlands Kamala Point, Kawai Point, Kawelikoa Point, Kuahonu Point, Paoa Point, and Molehu Point are on the southeast of the island; Makaokahaʻi Point and Weli Point are in the south.
===Climate===
Kauaʻi&#x27;s climate is tropical, with generally humid and stable conditions year-round, although infrequent storms cause severe flooding. At the lower elevations, the annual precipitation varies from an average of about on the windward (northeastern) shore to less than on the (southwestern) leeward side of the island. The average temperature in Lihu&#x27;e, the county seat, ranges from in February to in August and September. 

Kauaʻi&#x27;s mountainous regions offer cooler temperatures in contrast to the warm coastal areas. At Kōkeʻe State Park, ASL, day temperatures vary from an average of in January to in July. In the winter, temperatures have been known to drop down to the 30s and 40s at the park, which holds an unofficial record low of , recorded in February 1986 at Kanaloahuluhulu Meadow.

Precipitation in Kauaʻi&#x27;s mountainous regions averages annually. About southeast of Kōkeʻe state park, at an elevation of , is the Mt. Waiʻaleʻale rain gauge. Mt. Waiʻaleʻale is often cited as the wettest spot on earth, although this has been disputed. Based on data for the period from 1931 through 1960, the average yearly precipitation was (U.S. Environmental Science Services Administration, 1968). Between 1949 and 2004, the average yearly precipitation at Mt. Waiʻaleʻale was .

Kauaʻi also holds a record in hourly precipitation. During a storm on January 24–25, 1956, a rain gauge at Kauaʻi&#x27;s former Kilauea Sugar Plantation recorded a record of precipitation in just 60 minutes. The value for one hour is an underestimate, since the rain gauge overflowed, which may have resulted in an error by as much as . An accurate measurement may have exceeded Holt, Missouri&#x27;s world-record rainfall of in 42 minutes on June 22, 1947.

===Time zone===
Hawaii Standard Time (UTC−10:00) is observed on Kauaʻi year-round. When mainland states are on daylight saving time, for example, the time on Kauaʻi is three hours behind the West Coast of the United States and six hours behind the East Coast.

Tourism is Kauaʻi&#x27;s largest industry. In 2007, 1,271,000 people visited. The two largest groups were from the continental United States (84% of all visitors) and Japan (3%). As of 2003, approximately 27,000 jobs existed on Kauaʻi. The largest sector was accommodation/food services (26%, 6,800 jobs), followed by government (15%) and retail (14.5%), with agriculture accounting for 2.9% (780 jobs) and educational services providing 0.7% (183 jobs). The visitors&#x27; industry accounted for one third of Kauaʻi&#x27;s income. Employment is dominated by small businesses, with 87% of all non-farm businesses having fewer than 20 employees. As of 2003, Kauaʻi&#x27;s poverty rate was 10.5%, compared to the mainland at 10.7%.

As of 2014, the median home price was about $400,000.

Land in Kauaʻi is very fertile; farmers raise many varieties of fruit and other crops. Guava, coffee, sugarcane, mango, banana, papaya, avocado, star fruit, kava, noni and pineapple are all cultivated on the island, but most agricultural land is used for raising cattle. 

Kauaʻi is home to the U.S. Navy&#x27;s &quot;Barking Sands&quot; Pacific Missile Range Facility, on the western shore. 

MF and HF (&quot;shortwave&quot;) radio station WWVH, sister station to WWV and low frequency WWVB in Fort Collins, Colorado, is on the west coast of Kauaʻi, about south of Barking Sands. WWVH, WWV and WWVB are operated by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology, broadcasting standard time and frequency information to the public.

==Energy==

Kauaʻi Island Utility Cooperative (KIUC) is a not-for-profit electric utility cooperative headquartered in Līhuʻe, which provides electricity for the island. It has 24,000 member-owners who elect a nine-member board of directors.

In the 1970s, Kauaʻi burned sugarcane waste to supply most of its electricity.

By 2008, transition of energy sources and growth in generating capacity had occurred, with most of Kauaʻi&#x27;s electricity produced by imported liquid petroleum. In 2006 and 2007, the inputs cost $69.3 million and $83 million, respectively. By 2011, 92% of KIUC&#x27;s power came from diesel.

By 2017, KIUC&#x27;s fuel mix was 56% fossil fuels, 9% hydroelectric, 12% biomass and 23% solar. KIUC integrated large-scale solar into its grid so that, during sunny daylight hours, 97% or more of its generation came from renewable sources. KIUC offers $1,000 rebates to residential customers who have solar water heating systems installed on their homes.

In 2017, KIUC opened a Tesla Energy 13 MW / 52 MWh battery next to the 12 MW Kapaia solar plant for 13.9¢/kWh. In December 2018, KIUC opened an AES Distributed Energy project for 20 MW solar with 20 MW / 100 MWh batteries priced at 11.1¢/kWh.

==Towns and communities==

Līhuʻe, on the island&#x27;s southeastern coast, is the seat of Kauaʻi County and the island&#x27;s second-largest town. Kapaʻa, on the &quot;Coconut Coast&quot; (site of an old coconut plantation) about north of Līhuʻe, has a population of over 10,000, or about 50% greater than Līhuʻe. Princeville, on the island&#x27;s north side, was once the capital of Kauaʻi.

Communities on Kauaʻi range in population from the roughly 10,000 people in Kapaʻa to tiny hamlets. Below are the larger or more notable of those from the northernmost end of Hawaii Route 560 to the western terminus of Hawaii Route 50:

<text>Hawai&#x27;i is the largest island in the United States, located in the state of Hawaii, the southernmost state in the union. It is the southeasternmost of the Hawaiian Islands, a chain of volcanic islands in the North Pacific Ocean. With an area of , it has 63% of the Hawaiian archipelago&#x27;s combined landmass. However, it has only 13% of the archipelago&#x27;s population. The island of Hawaiʻi is the third largest island in Polynesia, behind the North and South Islands of New Zealand.

The island is often referred to as the Island of Hawai&#x27;i or Hawai&#x27;i Island to distinguish it from the state. It is also referred to as The Big Island, due to its size relative to the other islands. In Hawaiian, the island is sometimes called &quot;Moku o Keawe&quot;. The word &quot;keawe&quot; has several meanings. One definition, &quot;southern cross&quot;, is said to be the name of an ancient chief. Another definition is &quot;the bearer&quot; (ke-a-we).

Hawai&#x27;i County is the local administrative unit. As of the 2020 census, the population was 200,629. The county seat and largest city is Hilo. Hawaiʻi County has no incorporated cities.

== History ==

Hawaiʻi is allegedly named after Hawaiʻiloa, a legendary Polynesian navigator who is said to have discovered the island. Other accounts attribute the name to the legendary realm of Hawaiki, a place from which some Polynesians are said to have originated, the place where they transition to in the afterlife, or the realm of the gods and goddesses. The indigenous Hawaiian name of the island was originally rendered and published as &quot;Owyhee&quot; or &quot;Owhyhee&quot;.

It is uncertain when Hawaiʻi was first discovered by humans. Early archaeological studies suggested that Polynesian explorers from the Marquesas Islands or Society Islands may have arrived in the Hawaiian islands as early as the 3rd century CE, possibly with a second wave arriving from Tahiti around 1100 CE. However, more recent analyses suggest that the first settlers arrived around 900–1200 CE.

Oral tradition holds one of the most famous &quot;aliʻinui&quot; of Hawaiʻi to be ʻUmi-a-Līloa, who united the island by force. He was the illegitimate son of Līloa, aliʻinui of Hawaiʻi who ruled from Waipiʻo Valley in the Hāmākua district. When Līloa died, the island passed to ʻUmi&#x27;s half-brother Hakau. However, ʻUmi attacked and killed Hakau along with the &quot;aliʻi (nobles)&quot; who served him, winning control of Hāmākua. He then proceeded to conquer the rebelling districts of Hilo, Puna, Kaʻū, and Kona. He placed the seat of his new government in Kailua in the Kona district.

In 1779, Captain James Cook made his second voyage to the Hawaiian islands, anchoring in Kealakekua Bay on the island of Hawaiʻi. He spent several weeks there, meeting and trading with locals and readying his ships for a planned trip to the Arctic. The Hawaiians received him hospitably, considering him to be an incarnation of the god Lono. Early in 1780, Cook departed. However, his ships were damaged in a storm immediately after setting sail, and he was forced to return to Kealakekua after only a week at sea. During this second anchoring, an altercation between the Europeans and the Hawaiians turned violent, resulting in the death of multiple people on both sides, including Cook himself. Peaceful relations were eventually restored with the crew of his ships, who departed for good later that month.

In 1780 CE, the island of Hawaiʻi was controlled by the &quot;aliʻinui&quot; Kalaniʻōpuʻu, a descendant of ʻUmi-a-Līloa. On his death in 1782, he designated his son Kīwalaʻō as his heir. However, a feud between Kīwalaʻō and Kalaniʻōpuʻu&#x27;s nephew Paiʻea Kamehameha soon escalated into a civil war. Kīwalaʻō was killed in the Battle of Mokuʻōhai later that same year, leaving control of the island divided between Kamehameha in the west, Kīwalaʻō&#x27;s uncle and advisor Keawemaʻuhili in the northeast, and Kīwalaʻō&#x27;s half-brother Keōua Kūʻahuʻula in the south. The three chiefs, aided by Western ships and weapons, fought to a standstill for eight years until 1790, when Keōua defeated and killed Keawemaʻuhili. In 1791 Kamehameha&#x27;s men killed Keōua at a diplomatic meeting, leaving control of Hawaiʻi to Kamehameha.

Kamehameha went on to conquer the rest of the Hawaiian islands, consolidating his control in 1810 with the peaceful surrender of Kaumualiʻi, king of Kauai. He gave his new kingdom, and by extension the island chain itself, the name of his native island – the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi.

In 1822, missionary William Ellis arrived and was one of a party that completed a tour of the island, descriptions of which were later published in his journal.

In July, 1898, Hawaiʻi and all the Hawaiian islands were annexed by the United States, becoming the Territory of Hawaii. In 1905, the passage of the County Act established the County of Hawaiʻi, providing the island with local government for the first time since 1810.

== Geology and geography ==

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (20.8%) is water. The county&#x27;s land area comprises 62.7 percent of the state&#x27;s land area. It is the highest percentage by any county in the United States. Delaware&#x27;s Sussex County comes in second at 48.0 percent, while Rhode Island&#x27;s Providence County is third at 39.6 percent.

At its greatest dimension, the island is across. Measured from its sea floor base to its highest peak, Mauna Kea at is the world&#x27;s tallest mountain, taller than even Mount Everest, since the base of Mount Everest is above sea level.

The most southern point of Hawaiʻi, Ka Lae, is the southernmost point of the United States. The nearest landfall to the south is the Line Islands. To the northwest of the island of Hawaiʻi is the island of Maui, whose Haleakalā volcano is visible from Hawaiʻi Island across the ʻAlenuihāhā Channel.

=== Volcanism ===


The island of Hawaiʻi is built from five separate shield volcanoes that erupted somewhat sequentially, one overlapping the other. These are (from oldest to youngest):
*Kohala – extinct
*Mauna Kea – dormant
*Hualālai – active
*Mauna Loa – active, partly within Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park
*Kīlauea – active, part of Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park

Geological evidence from exposures of old surfaces on the south and west flanks of Mauna Loa led to the proposal that two ancient volcanic shields (named Nīnole and Kulani) were all but buried by the younger Mauna Loa. Geologists now consider these &quot;outcrops&quot; to be part of Mauna Loa.

Based on geochemical (including trace elements) and isotope differences in their eruptive products, Hawaiian volcanoes fall into two families. The differences are believed due to their separate magma systems. Hualālai and Mauna Loa are members of one family, while Kohala, Mauna Kea, and Kilauea are members of the other.

Because Mauna Loa and Kīlauea are active volcanoes, the island is growing. Between January 1983 and September 2002, lava flows added to the island. Lava flowing from Kīlauea destroyed several towns, including Kapoho in 1960 and again in 2018, and Kalapana and Kaimū in 1990. In 1987 lava filled in &quot;Queen&#x27;s Bath&quot;, a large, L-shaped, freshwater pool in the Kalapana area. Another 875 acres were added between May and July 2018 by the 2018 lower Puna eruption, with &quot;Fissure 8&quot; located within Leilani Estates subdivision being a primary source of the lava. A lake known as &quot;Green Lake&quot; was covered by lava in that eruption as well as Ahalanui Beach Park and part of Isaac Hale Beach Park, the latter of which was inundated with black sand, rendering its boatramp unusable. Mauna Loa erupted briefly in 2022, 38 years after the prior activity.

Some geologists also count two undersea volcanoes in the base of the island. Māhukona off the northwest corner of the island has eroded below the ocean surface. Kamaʻehuakanaloa (formerly Lōʻihi) is under water southeast of Hawaiʻi. It is an erupting seamount that has grown to reach below the ocean surface, and it is forecast to break the surface in 10,000 to 100,000 years.

=== Great Crack ===

The Great Crack is an , and fissure in the island, in the district of Kaʻū. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the Great Crack is the result of crustal dilation from magmatic intrusions into the southwest rift zone of Kīlauea. While neither the earthquake of 1868 nor that of 1975 caused a measurable change in the Great Crack, lava welled out of its lower in 1823.

Trails, rock walls, and archaeological sites from as old as the 12th century exist near the Great Crack. In August 2018, the National Park Service purchased nearly of private land adjacent to Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park, claiming that the area had important geological features to be studied and preserved.

=== Hilina Slump ===

The Hilina Slump is a section of the south slope of Kīlauea that is moving away from the island. Between 1990 and 1993, Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements showed a southward displacement of about per year. Undersea measurements show a &quot;bench&quot; that has formed a buttress and that this buttress may tend to reduce the likelihood of catastrophic detachment.

=== Earthquakes and tsunamis ===
On 2 April 1868, an earthquake with a magnitude estimated between 7.25 and 7.9 rocked the southeast coast of Hawaiʻi. This was the most destructive earthquake in the Hawaiʻi&#x27;s recorded history. It triggered a landslide on Mauna Loa, north of Pāhala, killing 31 people. A tsunami claimed 46 more lives. The villages of Punaluʻu, Nīnole, Kawaʻa, Honuʻapo, and Keauhou were severely damaged. The tsunami reportedly rolled over the tops of the coconut trees up to high, and it reached inland a distance of a quarter of a mile (400 meters) in some places.

On 29 November 1975, a section of the Hilina Slump dropped and slid toward the ocean. This movement caused a 7.2 magnitude earthquake and a tsunami. Oceanfront property was washed off its foundations in Punaluʻu. Two deaths were reported at Halape, and 19 other people were injured.

The island suffered damage from a tsunami caused by earthquakes in Alaska on 1 April 1946, and in Chile on 23 May 1960. Downtown Hilo was damaged by both tsunamis, with many lives lost. Just north of Hilo, Laupāhoehoe lost 16 schoolchildren and five teachers in the tsunami of 1946.

In March 2011, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake off the east coast of Japan again created a tsunami that caused minor damage in Hawaiʻi. The estimated damage to public buildings was about US$3 million. In the Kona area this tsunami washed a house into Kealakekua Bay, destroyed a yacht club and tour boat offices in Keauhou Bay, caused extensive damage in Kailua-Kona, flooded the ground floor of the King Kamehameha Hotel, and temporarily closed the Kona Village Resort.

In early May 2018, hundreds of small earthquakes were detected on Kīlauea&#x27;s East Rift Zone, leading officials to issue evacuation warnings. On 3 May 2018, the volcano erupted in Puna after a 5.0 earthquake earlier in the day, causing evacuations of Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens subdivisions. A seemingly related 5.3 magnitude quake and a subsequent 6.9 magnitude earthquake occurred on 4 May.

=== Volcanic fog ===

Vog (volcanic fog) can envelop the island of Hawaiʻi when Kīlauea is active. Since the termination of volcanic activity in September 2018, vog has largely disappeared on the west side of the island. The gas plumes created a blanket of vog that the trade winds mostly deflect toward the Kona coast. Vog can damage the health of plants, humans, and other animals. Most of the aerosols are acidic and of a size where they can remain in the lungs to damage them. Flu-like symptoms and general lethargy are reported, and are especially pronounced in people with respiratory conditions.

=== National protected areas ===
The island hosts many specialized ecosystems/microclimates, including many protected by federal designation:
*Ala Kahakai National Historic Trail
*Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge
*Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park
*Kaloko-Honokōhau National Historical Park
*Kohala Historical Sites State Monument (Mookini Heiau)
*Kona Forest National Wildlife Refuge
*Puʻuhonua o Hōnaunau National Historical Park
*Puʻukoholā Heiau National Historic Site

== Economy ==
Sugarcane was the backbone of the island economy for more than a century. In the mid-20th century, sugarcane plantations began to downsize, and in 1995 the island&#x27;s last plantation closed.

Most of the island&#x27;s economy depends on tourism, centered primarily in resort areas on the western coast of the island in the North Kona and South Kohala districts. Sustainable tourism is increasing.

Diversified agriculture is a growth sector. Major crops include macadamia nuts, papaya, flowers, tropical and temperate vegetables, aquaculture, and coffee beans. The island&#x27;s orchid production is the state&#x27;s largest. The island is home to one of the United States&#x27; largest cattle ranches: Parker Ranch, on in Waimea.

The island is known for astronomy, with numerous telescopes positioned on the summit of Mauna Kea at the Mauna Kea Observatories, where atmospheric clarity is excellent and little light pollution intrudes. Astronomy has become somewhat controversial, given accusations of mismanagement by the observatory manager, the University of Hawaiʻi. The proposed addition of the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) generated protests that stalled the project and led to the transfer of management responsibility to a Governor-appointed body.

NELHA (Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii Authority), a state developed site, is a green economic development ocean science and technology park on the west side of the island. It provides resources and facilities for energy and ocean-related research, education, and commercial activities in an environmentally sound and culturally sensitive manner. Business tenants on this coastal site include microalgae farms, aquaculture, solar technology and marine biotech. Tenants have access to three sets of pipelines delivering deep-sea water from a depth of up to , as well as pristine sea surface water and almost constant sunshine. A 2012 study by the University of Hawaiʻi Economic Research Organization reported that the total economic impact of activities at NELHA was $87.7 million and created 583 jobs.

<doc id="70963" wikidata="Q810169" url="?curid=70963" title="Basil Valentine">
<text>Basil Valentine is the Anglicised version of the name Basilius Valentinus, ostensibly a 15th-century alchemist, possibly Canon of the Benedictine Priory of Saint Peter in Erfurt, Germany but more likely a pseudonym used by one or several 16th-century German authors.

According to John Maxson Stillman, who wrote on the history of chemistry, there is no evidence of such a name on the rolls in Germany or Rome and no mention of this name before 1600. His putative history, like his imaginary portrait, appears to be of later creation than the writings themselves.

During the 18th century it was suggested that the author of the works attributed to Basil Valentine was Johann Thölde, a salt manufacturer in Germany who lived roughly 1565–1624. Modern scholarship now suggests that one author was Thölde, but that others were involved. Thölde published the first five books under Valentine&#x27;s name.

Whoever he was, Basil Valentine had considerable knowledge of chemistry. He demonstrated that ammonia could be obtained by the action of alkali on sal-ammoniac (ammonium chloride), described the production of hydrochloric acid by acidifying brine of common salt (sodium chloride), and created ethyl chloride and oil of vitriol (sulfuric acid), among other achievements.

==&quot;The Twelve Keys of Basil Valentine&quot;==
&quot;The Twelve Keys of Basil Valentine&quot; is a widely reproduced alchemical book attributed to Valentine, first published in 1599 by Johann Thölde. It contains two parts, the second of which houses the twelve keys. These were accompanied by woodcut engravings from later publications in the early seventeenth century.

==Selected publications==
Numerous publications on alchemy in Latin and German were published under the name Basil Valentine. They have been translated into many European languages, including English, French, Russian and others. The following list is roughly organized in order of translation or publication date.
