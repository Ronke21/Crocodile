<text>Anton Webern (; 3 December 1883 – 15 September 1945) was an Austrian composer, conductor, and musicologist. His music was among the most radical of its milieu in its concision and use of then novel atonal and twelve-tone techniques. His approach was typically rigorous, inspired by his studies of the Franco-Flemish School under Guido Adler and by Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s emphasis on structure in teaching composition from the music of Johann Sebastian Bach, the First Viennese School, and Johannes Brahms. Webern, Schoenberg, and their colleague Alban Berg were at the core of what became known as the Second Viennese School.

Webern was arguably the first and certainly the last of the three to write music in a style that was both expressionist and aphoristic, reflecting his instincts and the idiosyncrasy of his compositional process. He treated themes of loss, love, nature, and spirituality, working from his experiences. Unhappily peripatetic and typically assigned light music or operetta in his early conducting career, he aspired to conduct what was seen as more respectable, serious music at home in Vienna. Following Schoenberg&#x27;s guidance, Webern attempted to write music of greater length during and after World War I, relying partly on the structural support of texts in many .

He rose as a choirmaster and conductor in Red Vienna with the support of David Josef Bach, championing Gustav Mahler&#x27;s music at home and abroad. With a publication contract through Emil Hertzka at Universal Edition and Schoenberg based in Berlin, Webern began writing music of increasing confidence, independence, and scale using twelve-tone technique. He maintained his &quot;path to the new music&quot; while marginalized as a &quot;cultural Bolshevist&quot; in Fascist Austria and Nazi Germany, enjoying mostly international recognition and relying more on teaching for income. Struggling to reconcile his loyalties to his divided friends and family, he adopted an optimistic outlook on the future under Nazi rule that wore on him as it proved wrong, and he repeatedly considered emigrating.

A soldier shot and killed Webern in an apparent accident shortly after World War II in Mittersill. His music was then celebrated by composers who took it as a point of departure in a phenomenon known as post-Webernism, closely linking his legacy to serialism. Musicians and scholars like Pierre Boulez, Robert Craft, and Hans and Rosaleen Moldenhauer studied and organized performances of his music, establishing it as modernist repertoire. Broader understanding of his expressive agenda, performance practice, and complex sociocultural and political contexts lagged. An historical edition of his music is currently in progress.

== Biography ==

=== 1883–1908: Upbringing between late Imperial Vienna and countryside ===
====Bucolic &quot;Heimat&quot;====
Webern was born in Vienna, Austria-Hungary. He was the only surviving son of Carl von Webern, a descendant of , high-ranking civil servant, mining engineer, and owner of the Lamprechtsberg copper mine in the Koralpe. Much of Webern&#x27;s early youth was in Graz (1890–1894) and Klagenfurt (1894–1902), though his father&#x27;s work briefly took the family to Olmütz and back to Vienna.

His mother Amalie (née Geer) was a pianist and accomplished singer. She taught Webern piano and sang opera with him. He received first drums, then a trumpet, and later a violin as Christmas gifts. With his sisters Rosa and Maria, Webern danced to music and ice-skated the to the Wörthersee. Edwin Komauer taught him cello, and the family played chamber music, including that of Mozart, Schubert, and Beethoven. Webern learned to play Bach&#x27;s cello suites and may have studied Bach&#x27;s polyphony under Komauer.

The extended Webern family spent summers, holidays, and vacations at their country estate, the Preglhof. The children played outside in the forest and on a high meadow with pasture grazed by herded cattle and with a church-and-mountain view; they bathed in a pond (where Webern once saved Rosa from drowning). He drove horses to Bleiburg and fought a wildfire encroaching on the estate. These experiences and reading Peter Rosegger&#x27;s shaped Webern&#x27;s distinct and lasting sense of &quot;Heimat&quot;.

====University====
After a trip to Bayreuth, Webern studied musicology at the University of Vienna (1902–1906) with Guido Adler, a friend of Mahler, composition student of Bruckner, and devoted Wagnerian who had been in contact with both Wagner and Liszt. He quickly joined the Wagner Society, meeting popular conductors and musicians. Egon Wellesz recalled he and Webern analyzed Beethoven&#x27;s late quartets at the piano in Adler&#x27;s seminars. Webern learned the historical development of musical styles and techniques, editing the second volume of Heinrich Isaac&#x27;s &quot;Choralis Constantinus&quot; as his doctoral thesis. Hans and Rosaleen Moldenhauer noted Webern&#x27;s scholarly engagement with Isaac&#x27;s music as a formative experience for Webern the composer. Webern especially praised Isaac&#x27;s voice leading or &quot;subtle organization in the interplay of parts&quot;:

Webern studied art history and philosophy under professors Max Dvořák, , and Franz Wickhoff, joining the Albrecht Dürer Gesellschaft in 1903. His cousin , an art historian studying in Graz, may have led him to the work of Arnold Böcklin and Giovanni Segantini, which he admired along with that of Ferdinand Hodler and Moritz von Schwind. Webern idolized Segantini&#x27;s landscapes on a par with Beethoven&#x27;s music, diarying in 1904:

Webern also studied nationalism and Catholic liturgy, shaped by his mostly provincial Catholic upbringing, which provided little exposure to the relatively cosmopolitan people of Vienna. At the time, antisemitism was resurgent in Austria, fueled by Catholic resentment after Jewish emancipation in the 1867 December Constitution. Webern first viewed his Jewish peers as ostentatious and unfriendly, but his attitude shifted by 1902. He quickly and durably made many close friends, most of them Jewish; Kathryn Bailey Puffett wrote that this likely shaped his views.

====Schoenberg and his circle====
In 1904, Webern approached Hans Pfitzner for composition lessons but left angrily when Pfitzner criticized Mahler and Richard Strauss. Adler admired Schoenberg&#x27;s work and may have sent Webern to him for composition lessons. Thus Webern met Berg, another Schoenberg pupil, and Schoenberg&#x27;s brother-in-law Alexander Zemlinsky, through whom Webern may have worked as an assistant coach at the in Vienna (1906–1909). Schoenberg, Berg, and Webern became devoted, lifelong friends with similar musical trajectories. Adler, Heinrich Jalowetz, and Webern played Schoenberg&#x27;s quartets under the composer, accompanying Marie Gutheil-Schoder in rehearsals for Op. 10.

Also through Schoenberg, who painted and had a 1910 solo exhibition at &#x27;s bookstore, Webern met Gustav Klimt, Oskar Kokoschka, Max Oppenheimer (with whom he corresponded on terms), Egon Schiele, and Emil Stumpp. In 1920, Webern wrote Berg about the &quot;indescribable impression&quot; Klimt&#x27;s work made on him, &quot;that of a luminous, tender, heavenly realm&quot;. He also met Karl Kraus, whose lyrics he later set, but only to completion in Op. 13/i.

===1908–1918: Early adulthood in Austria-Hungary and German Empire===

====Marriage====
Webern married Wilhelmine &quot;Minna&quot; Mörtl in a 1911 civil ceremony in Danzig. She had become pregnant in 1910 and feared disapproval, as they were cousins. Thus the Catholic Church only solemnized their lasting union in 1915, after three children.

They met in 1902, later hiking along the Kamp from Rosenburg-Mold to Allentsteig in 1905. He wooed her with John Ruskin essays (in German translation), dedicating his Langsamer Satz to her. Webern diaried about their time together &quot;with obvious literary aspirations&quot;:

====Early conducting career====
Webern conducted and coached singers and choirs mostly in operetta, musical theater, light music, and some opera in his early career. Operetta was in its Viennese Silver Age. Much of this music was regarded as low- or middlebrow; Kraus, Theodor Adorno, and Ernst Krenek found it &quot;uppity&quot; in its pretensions. In 1924 Ernst Décsey recalled he once found operetta, with its &quot;old laziness and unbearable musical blandness&quot;, beneath him. J. P. Hodin contextualized the opposition of the &quot;youthful intelligentsia&quot; to operetta with a quote from Hermann Bahr&#x27;s 1907 essay &quot;Wien&quot;:

&quot;What benefit ... if all operettas ... were destroyed&quot;, Webern told Diez in 1908. But in 1912, he told Berg that Zeller&#x27;s &quot;Vogelhändler&quot; was &quot;quite nice&quot; and Schoenberg that J. Strauss II&#x27;s &quot;Nacht in Venedig&quot; was &quot;such fine, delicate music. I now believe ... Strauss is a master.&quot; A summer 1908 engagement with Bad Ischl&#x27;s was &quot;hell&quot;. Webern walked out on an engagement in Innsbruck (1909), writing in distress to Schoenberg: Webern wrote Zemlinsky seeking work at the Berlin or Vienna Volksoper instead. He started at Bad Teplitz&#x27;s Civic Theater in early 1910, where the local news reported his &quot;sensitive, devoted guidance&quot; as conductor of Fall&#x27;s &quot;Geschiedene Frau&quot;, but he quit within months due to disagreements. His repertoire likely included Fall&#x27;s &quot;Dollarprinzessin&quot;, Lehár&#x27;s &quot;Graf von Luxemburg&quot;, O. Straus&#x27;s &quot;Walzertraum&quot;, J. Strauss II&#x27;s &quot;Fledermaus&quot;, and Schumann&#x27;s &quot;Manfred&quot;. There were only 22 musicians in the orchestra, too few to perform Puccini&#x27;s operas, he noted.

Webern then summered at the Preglhof, composing his Op. 7 and planning an opera. In September, he attended the Munich premiere of Mahler&#x27;s &quot;Symphony of a Thousand&quot; and visited with his idol, who gave Webern a sketch of &quot;&quot;. Webern then worked with Jalowetz as assistant conductor in Danzig (1910–1911), where he first saw the &quot;almost frightening&quot; ocean. He conducted von Flotow&#x27;s &quot;Wintermärchen&quot;, George&#x27;s &quot;Försterchristl&quot;, Jones&#x27; &quot;Geisha&quot;, Lehár&#x27;s &quot;Lustige Witwe&quot;, Lortzing&#x27;s &quot;Waffenschmied&quot;, Offenbach&#x27;s &quot;Belle Hélène&quot;, and J. Strauss II&#x27;s &quot;Zigeunerbaron&quot;. He particularly enjoyed Offenbach&#x27;s &quot;Contes d&#x27;Hoffmann&quot; and Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Barbiere di Siviglia&quot;, but only Jalowetz was allowed to conduct this more established repertoire.

Webern soon expressed homesickness to Berg; he could not bear the separation from Schoenberg and their world in Vienna. He returned after resigning in spring 1911, and the three were pallbearers at Mahler&#x27;s funeral in May 1911. Then in summer 1911, a neighbor&#x27;s antisemitic abuse and aggression caused Schoenberg to quit work, abandon Vienna, and go with his family to stay with Zemlinsky on the . Webern and others fundraised for Schoenberg&#x27;s return, circulating more than one hundred leaflets with forty-eight signatories, including G. Adler, H. Bahr, Klimt, Kraus, and R. Strauss, among others. But Schoenberg was resolved to move to Berlin, and not for the first or last time, convinced of Vienna&#x27;s fundamental hostility.

Webern soon joined him (1910–1912), finishing no new music in his devoted work on Schoenberg&#x27;s behalf, which entailed many editing and writing projects. He gradually became tired, unhappy, and homesick. He tried to persuade Schoenberg to return home to Vienna, continuing the fundraising campaign and lobbying for a position there for Schoenberg, but Schoenberg could not bear to return to the due to his prior experiences in Vienna. At the same time, Webern began a cycle of repeatedly quitting and being taken back by Zemlinsky at the (1911–1918).

He had a short-lived conducting post in Stettin (1912–1913), which, as all the others, kept him from composing and alienated him. On the verge of a breakdown, he wrote Berg shortly after arriving (Jul. 1912):

====&quot;Old song&quot; of &quot;lost paradise&quot;====
Webern&#x27;s father sold the Preglhof in 1912, and Webern mourned it as a &quot;lost paradise&quot;. He revisited it and the family grave in nearby Schwabegg his entire life, associating these places with the memory of his mother, whose 1906 loss profoundly affected him. In July 1912, he confided in Schoenberg: 

Shortly after the anniversary of his mother&#x27;s death, he wrote Schoenberg in September 1912:

For Christmas in 1912, Webern gifted Schoenberg Rosegger&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (&quot;Forest Homeland&quot;), from which Julian Johnson highlighted: Rosegger&#x27;s account of his mother&#x27;s death at the book&#x27;s end (&quot;An meine Mutter&quot;) resonated with Webern, who connected it to his Op. 6 orchestral pieces. In a January 1913 letter to Schoenberg, Webern revealed that these pieces were a kind of program music, each reflecting details and emotions tied to his mother&#x27;s death. He had written Berg in July 1912, &quot;my compositions ... relate to the death of my mother&quot;, specifying in addition the &quot;Passacaglia, [String] Quartet, most [early] songs, ... second Quartet, ... second [orchestral pieces, Op. 10] (with some exceptions)&quot;. 

Johnson contended that Webern understood his cultural origins with a maternal view of nature and , which became central themes in his music and thought. He noted that Webern&#x27;s deeply personal idea of a maternal homeland—built from memories of pilgrimages to his mother&#x27;s grave, the &quot;mild&quot;, &quot;lost paradise&quot; of home, and the &quot;warmth&quot; of her memory—reflected his sense of loss and his yearning for return. Drawing loosely on V. Kofi Agawu&#x27;s semiotic approach to classical music, specifically his idea of musical topics, Johnson held that all of Webern&#x27;s music, though rarely directly representational, was enriched by its associative references and more specific musical and extra-musical meanings. In this he claimed to echo Craft, Jalowetz, Krenek, the Moldenhauers, and Webern himself.

In particular, Webern associated nature with his personal (often youthful and spiritual) experiences, forming a topical nexus that recurred in his diaries, letters, and music, sometimes explicitly in sketches and set texts. He frequented the surrounding mountains, summering in resort towns like Mürzzuschlag and backpacking (sometimes summiting) the Gaisstein, Grossglockner, Hochschober, Hochschwab, and Schneealpe (among others) throughout his life. The alpine climate and föhn, glaciers, pine trees, and springs &quot;crystal clear down to the bottom&quot; fascinated him. He treasured this time &quot;up there, in the heights&quot;, where &quot;one should stay&quot;.

He collected and organized &quot;mysterious&quot; alpine herbs and cemetery flowers in pressed albums, and he tended gardens at his father&#x27;s home in Klagenfurt and later at his own homes in the Mödling District (first in Mödling, then in Maria Enzersdorf). Karl Amadeus Hartmann remembered that Webern gardened &quot;as a devotion&quot; to Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphosis of Plants&quot;, and Johnson drew a parallel between Webern&#x27;s gardening and composing, emphasizing his connection to nature and his structured, methodical approach in both pursuits. Johnson noted that gardens and cemeteries are alike in being cultivated, closed spaces of rebirth and quiet reflection.

These habits and preoccupations endured in Webern&#x27;s life and . In 1933, Joseph Hueber recalled Webern stopped in a fragrant meadow, dug his hands into the soil, and breathed in the flowers and grass before rising to ask: &quot;Do you sense &#x27;Him&#x27; ... as strongly as I, &#x27;Him, Pan&#x27;?&quot; In 1934, Webern&#x27;s lyricist and collaborator Hildegard Jone described his work as &quot;filled ... with the endless love and delicacy of the memory of ... childhood&quot;. Webern told her, &quot;through my work, all that is past becomes like a childhood&quot;.

====Psychotherapy====
In 1912–1913, Webern had a breakdown and saw Alfred Adler, who noted his idealism and perfectionism. There were many factors involved. Webern had little time (mostly summers) to compose. There were conflicts at work (e.g., he emphasized that a director called him a &quot;little man&quot;). His ambivalence toward sales-oriented popular music theater contributed (&quot;I ... stir the sauce&quot;, he wrote). &quot;It appears ... improbable that I should remain with the theatre. It is ... terrible. ... I can hardly ... adjust to being away from home&quot;, he had written Schoenberg in 1910. Miserably ill and alienated, he first had sought medical advice and taken rest at a sanatorium in . Adler later evaluated his symptoms as psychogenic responses to unmet expectations. Webern wrote Schoenberg that Adler&#x27;s psychoanalysis was helpful and insightful.

====World War I====
As World War I broke out and nationalist fervor swept Europe, Webern found it &quot;inconceivable&quot;, he wrote Schoenberg in August 1914, &quot;that the German Reich, and we along with it, should perish.&quot; Yielding in his distrust of Protestant Germany, he compared Catholic France to &quot;cannibals&quot; and expressed pan-German patriotism amid wartime propaganda. He cited his &quot;faith in the German spirit&quot; as having &quot;created, almost exclusively, the culture of mankind&quot;. Despite his high regard of French classical music, especially Debussy&#x27;s, Webern revered the tradition as centered on counterpoint and form, and as mainly German since Bach.

Webern served intermittently for nearly two years. The war cost him professional opportunities, much of his social life, and the necessary leisure time to compose (he completed only nine ). Moving frequently and tiring, he began to despair, explaining to Schoenberg in November 1916 that the reality of war was &quot;Old Testament&quot; and &quot;&#x27;Eye for eye&#x27;&quot;, &quot;as if Christ had never existed&quot;. Webern was discharged in December 1916 for myopia, which had disqualified him from frontline service.

His 1917 show that he reflected on his patriotism and processed his sorrow. He treated the loss of life and, with the 1916 death of Franz Joseph I of Austria, the end of an era. In &quot;Fahr hin, o Seel&#x27;&quot;, he selected a lament sung at a funeral in a Rosegger novel. In &quot;Wiese im Park&quot;, he selected a text from Kraus recognizing that the day was &quot;dead&quot;, (&quot;and everything ... so old&quot;). Webern also set several disturbing poems of Georg Trakl, not all of which he could finish. With uninterrupted contrapuntal density, by turns muscular and murmured, he word painted Trakl&#x27;s &quot;great cities&quot; and &quot;dying peoples&quot;, &quot;leafless trees&quot;, &quot;violent alarm&quot;, and &quot;falling stars&quot; in &quot;Abendland III&quot;.

====Austrian defeat and socioeconomic strain====
During and after the end of the war, Webern, like other Austrians, contended with food shortages, insufficient heating, socioeconomic volatility, and geopolitical disaster in defeat. He had considered retreating to the countryside and purchasing a farm since 1917, specifically as an asset better than war bonds at shielding his family&#x27;s wealth from inflation. (In the end, he lost all that remained of his family&#x27;s wealth to hyperinflation by 1924.) He proposed to Schoenberg that they might be smallholders together.

Despite Schoenberg&#x27;s and his father&#x27;s advice that he not quit conducting, Webern followed to Schoenberg to Mödling in early 1918, hoping to be reunited with his mentor and to compose more. But Webern&#x27;s finances were so poor that he soon explored a &quot;voluntary exile&quot; to Prague again. Nonetheless, he continued to raise funds, including his own, for Schoenberg, with whom he spent every day.

Yet soon after he arrived, Webern broke his friendship with Schoenberg. The break was multifactorial but involved Webern&#x27;s dissatisfaction with his career and financial turmoil. Berg learned of the Weberns&#x27; ill temperaments and &quot;latent antisemitism&quot; from Schoenberg, and noted that Schoenberg &quot;wouldn&#x27;t explain&quot; further than &quot;&#x27;Webern wants to go to Prague again&#x27;&quot;. Bailey Puffett argued that Webern&#x27;s actions in and after the 1930s suggested that he was not antisemitic, at least in his maturity. She noted that Webern later wrote Schoenberg that he felt &quot;a sense of the most vehement aversion&quot; against German-speaking people who were.

After meeting with Webern, Berg saw &quot;the matter in a different light&quot;, considering Webern &quot;by and large innocent&quot; in light of what Webern said was Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;kick in the teeth&quot;: after laying plans for a New Music society, Schoenberg angrily called Webern &quot;secretive and deceitful&quot; upon learning that Webern was instead considering Prague again. They reconciled in October 1918, not long before Webern&#x27;s father died in 1919. Webern was changed by these events; he slowly began to grow more independent of Schoenberg, who was like a father to him. For his part, Schoenberg was not infrequently dubious of Webern, who he still considered his closest friend.

===1918–1933: Rise in (Interwar Vienna)===

====Society for Private Musical Performances====
Webern stayed in Vienna and worked with Berg, Schoenberg, and Erwin Stein at the Society for Private Musical Performances (1918–1921), promoting new music through performances and contests. Music included that of Bartók, Berg, Busoni, Debussy, Korngold, Mahler, Novák, Ravel, Reger, Satie, Strauss, Stravinsky, and Webern himself. Webern wrote Berg about Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;indescribably touching&quot; &quot;Berceuses du chat&quot; and &quot;glorious&quot; &quot;Pribaoutki&quot;, which Schoenberg conducted at a sold-out 1919 Society concert. There was perhaps some shared influence among Schoenberg, Stravinsky, and Webern at this time. The Society dissolved amid hyperinflation in 1921, having boasted some 320 members and sponsored more than a hundred concerts.

====Mature conducting career====
Webern obtained work as music director of the 1921, having made an excellent impression as the vocal coach Schoenberg recommended for their 1920 performance of &quot;Gurre-Lieder&quot;. They nearly abandoned this project before Webern stepped in. He led them in performances of Brahms, Mahler, Reger, and Schumann, among others. But low salary, mandatory touring, and challenges to Webern&#x27;s thorough rehearsals prompted him to resign in 1922. He was also chorusmaster of the Mödling (1922–1926) until he resigned in controversy over hiring a Jewish soprano, Greta Wilheim, as a stand-in soloist for Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Mirjams Siegesgesang&quot;.

From 1922, Webern led the mixed-voice amateur and through David Josef Bach, Director of the . Webern won DJ Bach&#x27;s confidence with a 1922 performance of Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 3 that established his reputation, prompting Berg to praise him as &quot;the greatest conductor since Mahler himself&quot;. Webern&#x27;s Mahler interpretations continued to be widely celebrated. From 1927, RAVAG aired twenty-two of Webern&#x27;s performances.

He premiered Berg&#x27;s Chamber Concerto with soloists Rudolf Kolisch and Eduard Steuermann in 1927 and led Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Les Noces&quot; with Erich Leinsdorf among the pianists in 1933. Armand Machabey noted Webern&#x27;s regional reputation as a conductor of for his meticulous approach to then contemporary music, comparing him to Willem Mengelberg in &quot;Le Ménestrel&quot; (1930). Some on the left, notably in &quot;Der Kampf&quot; (1929), criticized Webern&#x27;s programming as more ambitious and bourgeois than popular and proletarian. And Webern seemed uneasy in his dependence on the Social Democrats for conducting work, perhaps on religious grounds, Krenek speculated. But Walter Kolneder wrote that &quot;Artistic work for and with workers was [from] a ... Christian standpoint which Webern took very seriously&quot;.

====Relative success in a destabilizing society====
Webern&#x27;s finances were often precarious, even in his years of relative success. Relief came from family, friends, patrons, and prizes. He twice received the . To compose more, he sought income while trying not to overcommit himself as a conductor. He contracted with Universal Edition only after 1919, reaching better terms in 1927, but he was not very ambitious or astute in business. Even with a doctorate and Guido Adler&#x27;s respect, he never secured a remunerative university position, whereas in 1925 Schoenberg was invited to the Prussian Academy of Arts, ending their seven years together in Mödling.

Social Democrat–Christian Social relations polarized and radicalized amid the . Webern and others signed an &quot;Announcement of Intellectual Vienna&quot; published on the front page of the Social Democrats&#x27; daily &quot;Arbeiter-Zeitung&quot; days before the 1927 Austrian legislative election. On Election Day in &quot;&quot;, Ignaz Seipel of the officially applied the term &quot;Red Vienna&quot; pejoratively, attacking Vienna&#x27;s educational and cultural institutions. Social unrest escalated to the July Revolt of 1927 and beyond. Webern&#x27;s nostalgia for social order intensified with increasing civil disorder. In 1928 friends fundraised for him, partly to fund a rest cure at the for his exhaustion and (possibly psychosomatic) gastrointestinal complaints.

In 1928, Berg celebrated the &quot;lasting works&quot; and successes of composers &quot;whose point of departure was ... late Mahler, Reger, and Debussy and whose temporary end point is in ... Schoenberg&quot; in their rise from &quot;pitiful &#x27;cliques&#x27;&quot; to a large, diverse, international, and &quot;irresistible movement&quot;. But they were soon marginalized and ostracized in Central Europe with few exceptions, and in 1929 Webern wrote Schoenberg that &quot;it is getting worse and worse here&quot;. He declined a RAVAG executive role, citing time constraints and fearing further affiliation with the Social Democrats.

Webern&#x27;s music was performed and publicized more widely starting in the latter half of the 1920s. Yet he found no great success as Berg enjoyed with &quot;Wozzeck&quot; nor as Schoenberg did, to a lesser extent, with &quot;Pierrot lunaire&quot; or in time with &quot;Verklärte Nacht&quot;. His Symphony, Op. 21, was performed as a chamber piece in New York by the League of Composers (1929) and separately in London at the 1931 International Society for Contemporary Music (ISCM) Festival. Louis Krasner sensed some resentment, noting that Webern had &quot;very little&quot;. Krenek&#x27;s impression was that Webern resented his financial hardships and lack of wider recognition.

===1933–1938: Perseverance in (Austrofascist Vienna)===

====Marginalization at home====
Financial crises, complex social and political movements, pervasive antisemitism, culture wars, and renewed military conflicts continued to shape Webern&#x27;s world, profoundly circumscribing his life. Shortly after Webern conducted the Brecht–Eisler &quot;Solidaritätslied&quot; in 1933, Engelbert Dollfuss saw the passed, and choir singers&#x27; homes were raided. In the 1934 Austrian Civil War, Austrofascists executed, exiled, and imprisoned Social Democrats, outlawed their party, and abolished cultural institutions.

Stigmatized by his decade-long association with Social Democrats, Webern lost a promising domestic conducting career, which might have been better recorded. He eventually abandoned efforts with what remained of the workers&#x27; choir in the form of the much constrained in 1935, instead working as a UE editor and board member and president (1933–1938, 1945).

Amid wars and crises, antisemitism had grown to epidemic proportions by the late 1920s. Vienna&#x27;s modern and popular culture, including the music of Webern, Schoenberg, and Berg, was of a typically Jewish milieu. It was derided as Jewish in a pejorative sense, marking it as foreign by contrast to the conservatism and traditionalism of the Austrian countryside. Webern&#x27;s admission to the Prussian Academy of Arts was withdrawn as Adolf Hitler rose in Germany, and an Austrian named Berg and Webern as Jewish composers on in 1933. In the late 1930s, they were exhibited for their in Nazi Germany and then at the Vienna Künstlerhaus in Nazi Austria.

Webern delivered an eight-lecture series &quot;&quot; at &#x27;s and her physician husband Rudolf Kurzman&#x27;s home (Feb.–Apr. 1933). He attacked fascist cultural policy, asking &quot;What will come of our struggle?&quot; He observed that &quot;&#x27;cultural Bolshevism&#x27; is the name given to everything that is going on around Schoenberg, Berg, and myself (Krenek too)&quot; and warned, &quot;Imagine what will be destroyed, wiped out, by this hate of culture!&quot; He lectured more at the Kurzmann-Leuchter home, privately in 1934–1935 on Beethoven&#x27;s piano sonatas to about 40 attendees and later in 1937–1938.

Persevering, Webern wrote Krenek that &quot;art has its own laws ... if one wants to achieve something in it, only these laws and nothing else can have validity&quot;; upon completing Op. 26 (1935), he wrote DJ Bach, &quot;I hope it is so good that (if people ever get to know it) they will declare me ready for a concentration camp or an insane asylum!&quot; The Vienna Philharmonic nearly refused to play Berg&#x27;s Violin Concerto (1936). Peter Stadlen&#x27;s 1937 Op. 27 premieres were the last Viennese Webern performances until after World War II. The critical success of Hermann Scherchen&#x27;s 1938 ISCM London Op. 26 premiere encouraged Webern to write more cantatas and reassured him after a cellist quit Op. 20 mid-performance, declaring it unplayable.

====Besieged milieu and political uncertainty====
Webern&#x27;s milieu comprised increasingly vast differences. Like most Austrians, he and his family were Catholic, though not church regulars; Webern was perhaps devout if unorthodox. They became politically divided. His friends (e.g., then Zionist Schoenberg, left-leaning Berg) were of a mostly Jewish milieu from late Imperial to &quot;red&quot; (Social Democratic) Vienna. Alma Mahler, Krenek, , and Stein preferred or supported the &quot;lesser evil&quot; of the Austrofascists (or aligned Italian fascists) the Nazis. Presuming power would moderate Hitler, Webern mediated among friends with an optimistic or self-soothing complacency, exasperating those who were at risk.

Webern found himself surrounded mostly by one side as Schoenberg immigrated to the US (1933), Rudolf Ploderer died by suicide (1933), Berg died (1935), and DJ Bach, among others (e.g., Greissle, Jalowetz, Krenek, Reich, Steuermann, Wellesz), fled or worse. Webern immediately considered following Schoenberg to the US, which Schoenberg discouraged despite seeking opportunities there for Webern. Schoenberg knew that Webern was deeply attached to home, and he told Webern that conditions in the US were poor, mentioning the ongoing Great Depression.

Webern&#x27;s views of National Socialism have been variously described. His published items reflected his audience or context. Secondary literature reflected limited evidence or ideological orientations and admitted uncertainty. Julie Brown noted hesitancy to approach the topic and echoed the Moldenhauers, considering the issue &quot;vexed&quot; and Webern a &quot;political enigma&quot;. Bailey Puffett considered Webern&#x27;s politics &quot;somewhat vague&quot; and his situation &quot;complex&quot;, noting that he seemed to avoid definitive political association as a practical strategy. Webern&#x27;s apparent sympathies with some of the Nazis&#x27; program later became a sensation in his reception, but the matter was often oversimplified or decontextualized and rested on limited evidence (mostly letters), Johnson wrote, sometimes with the larger aim of politicizing Webern&#x27;s music and his musical language.

Krasner and the Moldenhauers surmised Webern&#x27;s cognitive dissonance, finding him &quot;idealistic and rather naive&quot;. In 1943 Kurt List described Webern as &quot;utterly ignorant&quot; and &quot;perpetual[ly] confus[ed]&quot; about politics, &quot;a ready prey to the personal influence of family and friends&quot;. Johnson described him as &quot;personally shy, a man of private feeling and essentially apolitical&quot;, and as &quot;prone to identify with Nazi politics as ... other ... Austrians&quot;. Webern may have believed that the Nazis shared his own ideals, Johnson wrote, explaining that &quot;it is possible that ... naiveté, ... ignorance and ... adherence to his own beliefs allowed Webern to see in Nazi ideology only ... elements ... he wanted to find&quot;.

====Visiting conducting career====
Webern conducted nine concerts as a BBC Symphony visiting conductor (1929–1936). A talkie on his first London visit inspired him to ask Steuermann about writing film music, and Steuermann wrote his relatives in the film industry, Salka Viertel and Berthold Viertel, for their suggestions. For the BBC, Webern selected then little-known Mahler (including both nocturnes from the Symphony No. 7 in 1934). He insisted on rehearsing at the piano with vocalists and was criticized for coaching musical phrasing.

In Barcelona, he withdrew from the 1936 world premiere of Berg&#x27;s Violin Concerto, grief-stricken after Berg&#x27;s death and overwhelmed by difficulties. There Krasner recalled, The two then played the concerto in London with BBC musicians, who rehearsed before Webern conducted. Kenneth Anthony Wright noted Webern&#x27;s &quot;funny little explanations of the varying dynamics and flexibility of tempo&quot;, but &quot;every syllable and every gesture of Webern was understood and lovingly heeded&quot;, Krasner recalled. The musicians &quot;all admired and respected Webern&quot;, according to Sidonie Goossens. But Felix Aprahamian, Benjamin Britten, and Berthold Goldschmidt criticized Webern&#x27;s conducting, and BBC management did not invite him back after 1936.

===1938–1939: Inner emigration in Nazi Germany===

====Anschluss====
Krasner&#x27;s last visit with Webern was interrupted by Kurt Schuschnigg&#x27;s broadcast speech that the Anschluss was imminent. Krasner had been playing some of Schoenberg&#x27;s Violin Concerto for Webern and trying to convince him to write a sonata for solo violin. When Webern turned on the radio and heard this speech, he urged Krasner to flee. Because Webern&#x27;s family included Nazis, Krasner wondered whether Webern had already known that the Anschluss was planned for that day. He also wondered whether Webern&#x27;s warning had been solely for his safety or whether it had also been to save Webern the embarrassment of the violinist&#x27;s presence in the event of celebration at the Webern home.

Much of Austria did celebrate. But Webern made only a terse note of the Anschluss in his notebook without registering any clear emotion. In fact, he wrote Jone and her husband Josef Humplik asking not to be disturbed as he was &quot;totally immersed&quot; in work on Op. 28. Thus, Bailey Puffett suggested that Webern may have received Krasner&#x27;s visit as a distraction.

By now, Hartmut Krones wrote, Webern likely realized his error in anticipating the Nazis&#x27; self-moderation. Bailey Puffett proposed that Krasner, with the benefit of hindsight from the perspective of his 1987 account, may have resented Webern for &quot;refusing to see the reality of Hitler&#x27;s antisemitism&quot;, at least until after 1936. That year, Webern had insisted that Krasner and he travel through Nazi Germany to stop at a Munich train station café, where Krasner said &quot;anything untoward was the least likely to happen&quot;, in an attempt to demonstrate the lack of danger.

Support for the Anschluss rested on antisemitism, economic prospects, and the idea of a Greater Germany. Under some duress, Theodor Innitzer ushered in Catholic support. The Austrian Nazis and Social Democrats, both outlawed, were linked in opposition to the Austrofascists. Karl Renner supported unification as a matter of self-determination before the years (1933–1938) of and Nazi soft power, and he and others now supported (or accepted as inevitable) the 1938 Anschluss. Otto Bauer, in exile, expressed some acceptance with profound resignation and misgivings, having worked toward Austria&#x27;s German incorporation since Provisional National Assembly&#x27;s 1918 vote. Webern had long shared in common pan-German sentiments, especially during wartime. He also likely hoped to conduct again, securing a firmer future for his family under a new regime proclaiming itself &quot;socialist&quot; no less than nationalist. According to what Josef Polnauer, a fellow early Schoenberg pupil, historian, and librarian, told the Moldenhauers, Webern&#x27;s optimism was not dispelled until 1941.

Krasner emphasized Webern&#x27;s &quot;naiveté&quot; but acknowledged that he himself had been &quot;foolhardy&quot; as to the danger of antisemitism, recalling &quot;read[ing] in the papers ... denials&quot; and &quot;want[ing] to see for myself&quot; in 1938. Consensus had emerged on the center, left, and in some mainstream Jewish organizations that antisemitism was only a means to political power since its 1890s definition as the &quot;socialism of fools&quot;. The Frankfurt School first treated it within the rubric of class conflict (Adorno began to consider it otherwise in his 1939 &quot;Fragments on Wagner&quot;), and Franz Neumann briefly contended that the Nazis would &quot;never allow a complete extermination of the Jews&quot; in his 1942 &quot;&quot; (before revisions in 1944).

====Kristallnacht and recoil====
 shocked Webern, who thought that reports of Nazi atrocities were politicized, unreliable propaganda. He visited and aided Jewish colleagues DJ Bach, , Polnauer, and Hugo Winter. For Jokl, a former Berg pupil, Webern wrote a recommendation letter to facilitate emigration. When that failed, Webern served as his godfather in a 1939 baptism. Polnauer, whose emigration Mark Brunswick, Schoenberg, and Webern were unable to secure, managed to survive the Holocaust as an albino; he later edited a 1959 UE publication of Webern&#x27;s correspondence from this time with Humplik and Jone. Webern moved Humplik&#x27;s 1929 gift of a Mahler bust to his bedroom, having told in 1936 or 1937 that Mahler&#x27;s time would come within a German and DJ Bach that &quot;not all Germans are Nazis&quot;.

With &quot;almost all his friends and old pupils ... gone&quot;, Webern found himself increasingly alone, and his financial situation was poor. He talked to Polnauer about emigrating but was reluctant to leave home and family. He entered a period of &quot;inward emigration&quot; and focused on composition, writing to artist Franz Rederer in 1939, &quot;We live completely withdrawn. I work a lot.&quot; He corresponded extensively to maintain relationships, imploring his student George Robert to play Schoenberg in New York and expressing his loneliness and isolation to Schoenberg. Then war limited postal service, disrupting their direct correspondence completely by 1941.

===1939–1945: Hope and disillusionment during World War II===

====Swiss and &quot;Reich&quot; prospects====
Webern&#x27;s mature music was performed mostly outside the , where only his tonal music and arrangements were allowed as works not in the style of a . His arrangement of two of Schubert&#x27;s &quot;German Dances&quot; was performed in Leipzig and broadcast in the and Fascist Italy (1941). His Passacaglia was considered for a Viennese contemporary music festival in 1942, Karl Böhm or Wilhelm Furtwängler conducting, but this did not happen. Hans Rosbaud likely performed it in occupied Strasbourg that year, and Luigi Dallapiccola sought to have it performed in Venice in 1943. Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt planned Webern&#x27;s arrangement of the six-voice ricercar from Bach&#x27;s &quot;Musical Offering&quot; at the in 1943, but war intervened.

Supported by IGNM-Sektion Basel, the Orchester Musikkollegium Winterthur, and Werner Reinhart, Webern attended three Swiss concerts, his last trips outside the . In 1940, Erich Schmid conducted Op. 1 in Winterthur; soprano Marguerite Gradmann-Lüscher sang Op. 4 and most of Op. 12 (not No. 3) at the Musik-Akademie der Stadt Basel, Schmid accompanying. In Feb. 1943, Scherchen gave the world premiere of Op. 30 at the . Webern intimated to Willi Reich that he might immigrate there, joking (Oct. 1939) &quot;Anything of the sort did seem quite out of the question for me!&quot; But Webern failed to find employment, even as a formality, likely due to anti-German sentiment in the context of Swiss neutrality and refugee laws.

In the &quot;Reich&quot;, he met with former Society violist Othmar Steinbauer about a formal teaching role in Vienna in early 1940, but nothing materialized. He lectured at the homes of Erwin Ratz and &#x27;s widow Margaret (1940–1942). Many private pupils came to him between 1940 and 1943, even from afar, among them briefly Hartmann. Hartmann, who opposed the Nazis, remembered that Webern counseled him to respect authority, at least publicly, for the sake of order.

====Wartime hopes and reality====
Sharing in wartime public sentiment at the height of Hitler&#x27;s popularity (spring 1940), Webern expressed high hopes, crediting him as &quot;unique&quot; and &quot;singular&quot; for &quot;the new state for which the seed was laid twenty years ago&quot;. These were patriotic letters to Joseph Hueber, an active soldier, baritone, close friend, and mountaineering companion who often sent Webern gifts. Indeed, Hueber had just sent Webern &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;.

Unaware of Stefan George&#x27;s aversion to the Nazis, Webern reread &quot;&quot; and marveled suggestively at the wartime leader envisioned therein, but &quot;I am not taking a position!&quot; he wrote active soldier, singer, and onetime Social Democrat, Hans Humpelstetter. For Johnson, &quot;Webern&#x27;s own image of a was never of this world; if his politics were ultimately complicitous it was largely because his utopian apoliticism played so easily into ... the status quo.&quot;

By Aug. 1940, Webern depended financially on his children. He sought wartime emergency relief funds from and the (1940–1944), which he received despite indicating non-membership in the Nazi Party on an application. Whether Webern ever joined the party was unknown. This represented his only income after 1942. He nearly exhausted his savings by 1944.

His 1943–1945 letters were strewn with references to bombings, death, destruction, privation, and the disintegration of local order, but several grandchildren were born. In Dec. 1943, aged 60, he wrote from a barrack that he was working 6 am–5 pm as an air-raid protection police officer, conscripted into the war effort. He corresponded with Willi Reich about IGNM-Sektion Basel&#x27;s concert marking his sixtieth, in which Paul Baumgartner played Op. 27, Walter Kägi Op. 7, and August Wenzinger Op. 11. Gradmann-Lüscher sang both Opp. 3 and the world premiere of 23. For Schoenberg&#x27;s 70th birthday (1944), Webern asked Reich to convey &quot;my most heartfelt remembrances, ... longing! ... hopes for a happy future!&quot; In Feb. 1945, Webern&#x27;s only son Peter, intermittently conscripted since 1940, was killed in an air attack; airstrike sirens interrupted the family&#x27;s mourning at the funeral.

====Refuge and death in Mittersill====
The Weberns assisted Schoenberg&#x27;s first son Görgi during the war; with the Red Army&#x27;s April 1945 arrival imminent, they gave him their Mödling apartment, the property and childhood home of Webern&#x27;s son-in-law Benno Mattl. Görgi later told Krasner that Webern &quot;felt he&#x27;d betrayed his best friends.&quot; The Weberns fled west, resorting to traveling partly on foot to Mittersill to rejoin their family of &quot;17 persons pressed together in the smallest possible space&quot;.

On the night of 15 Sept. 1945, Webern was outside smoking when he was shot and killed by a US soldier in an apparent accident. He had been following Thomas Mann&#x27;s work, which the Nazis had burned, noting in 1944 that Mann had finished &quot;Joseph and His Brothers&quot;. In his last notebook entry, Webern quoted Rainer Maria Rilke: &quot;Who speaks of victory? To endure is everything.&quot;

Webern&#x27;s wife Minna suffered final years of grief, poverty, and loneliness as friends and family continued emigrating. She wished Webern lived to see more success. With the abolition of policies, solicited her for hidden manuscripts; thus Opp. 17, 24–25, and 29–31 were published. She worked to get Webern&#x27;s 1907 Piano Quintet published via Kurt List.

In 1947 she wrote Diez, now in the US, that by 1945 Webern was &quot;firmly resolved to go to England&quot;. Likewise, in 1946 she wrote DJ Bach in London: &quot;How difficult the last eight years had been for him. ... [H]e had only the one wish: to flee from this country. But one was caught, without a will of one&#x27;s own. ... It was close to the limit of endurance what we had to suffer.&quot; Minna died in 1949.

== Music ==

Webern&#x27;s music was generally concise, organic, and parsimonious, with very small motifs, palindromes, and parameterization on both the micro- and macro-scale. His idiosyncratic approach reflected affinities with Schoenberg, Mahler, Guido Adler and early music; interest in esotericism and ; and thorough perfectionism. He engaged with the work of Goethe, Bach, and the Franco-Flemish School in addition to that of Wolf, Brahms, Wagner, Liszt, Schumann, Beethoven, Schubert (&quot;so genuinely Viennese&quot;), and Mozart. Stylistic shifts were not neatly coterminous with gradually developed technical devices, particularly in the case of his mid-period .

His music was also characteristically linear and song-like. Much of it (and Berg&#x27;s and Schoenberg&#x27;s) was for singing. Johnson described the song-like gestures of Op. 11/i. In Webern&#x27;s mid-period , some heard instrumentalizing of the voice (often in relation to the clarinet) representing yet some continuity with . Lukas Näf described one of Webern&#x27;s signature hairpins (on the Op. 21/i mm. 8–9 bass clarinet note) as a &quot;messa di voce&quot; requiring some &quot;rubato&quot; to execute faithfully. Adventurous textures and timbres, and melodies of wide leaps and sometimes extreme ranges and registers were typical.

For Johnson, Webern&#x27;s &quot;rubato&quot; compressed Mahler&#x27;s &quot;&#x27;surging and ebbing&#x27;&quot; tempi; this and Webern&#x27;s dynamics indicated a &quot;vestigial lyrical subjectivity.&quot; Webern often set carefully chosen lyric poetry. He related his music not only to nostalgia for the lost family and home of his youth, but also to his Alpinism and fascination with plant aromatics and morphology. He was compared to Mahler in his orchestration and semantic preoccupations (e.g., memory, landscapes, nature, loss, often Catholic mysticism). In Jone, who he met with her husband Humplik via the , Webern found a lyricist who shared his esoteric, natural, and spiritual interests. She provided texts for his late vocal works.

Webern&#x27;s and Schoenberg&#x27;s music distinctively prioritized minor seconds, major sevenths, and minor ninths as noted in 1934 by microtonalist Alois Hába. The Kholopov siblings noted the semitone&#x27;s unifying role by axial inversional symmetry and octave equivalence as interval class 1 (ic1), approaching Allen Forte&#x27;s generalized pitch-class set analysis. Webern&#x27;s consistent use of ic1 in cells and sets, often expressed as a wide interval musically, was well noted. Symmetric pitch-interval practices varied in rigor and use by others (e.g., Berg, Schoenberg, Bartók, Debussy, Stravinsky; more nascently Mahler, Brahms, Bruckner, Liszt, Wagner). Berg and Webern took symmetric approaches to elements of music beyond pitch. Webern later linked pitches and other parameters in schemes (e.g., fixed or &quot;frozen&quot; register).

Relatively few of Webern&#x27;s works were published in his lifetime. Amid fascism and Emil Hertzka&#x27;s passing, this included late as well as early works (in addition to others without opus numbers). His rediscovery prompted many publications, but some early works were unknown until after the work of the Moldenhauers well into the 1980s, obscuring formative facets of his musical identity. Thus when Boulez first oversaw a project to record Webern&#x27;s music, the results fit on three CDs and the second time, six. A historical edition of his music has remained in progress.

=== 1899–1908: Formative juvenilia and emergence from study ===

Webern published little juvenilia; like Brahms, he was meticulous and self-conscious, revising extensively. His earliest works were mostly &quot;Lieder&quot; on works of Richard Dehmel, Gustav Falke, and Theodor Storm. He set seven Ferdinand Avenarius poems on the &quot;changing moods&quot; of life and nature (1899–1904). Schubert, Schumann, and Wolf were important models. With its brief, potent expressivity and utopianization of the natural world, the (German) Romantic &quot;Lied&quot; had a lasting influence on Webern&#x27;s musical aesthetic. He never abandoned its lyricism, intimacy, and wistful or nostalgic topics, though his music became more abstract, idealized, and introverted.

Webern memorialized the Preglhof in a diary poem &quot;An der Preglhof&quot; and in the tone poem &quot;Im Sommerwind&quot; (1904), both after Bruno Wille&#x27;s idyll. In Webern&#x27;s &quot;Sommerwind&quot;, Derrick Puffett found affinities with Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Alpensinfonie&quot;, Charpentier&#x27;s &quot;Louise&quot;, and Delius&#x27;s &quot;&quot;.

At the Pregholf in summer 1905, Webern wrote his tripartite, single-movement string quartet in a highly modified sonata form, likely responding to Schoenberg&#x27;s Op. 7. He quoted Jakob Böhme in the preface and mentioned the panels of Segantini&#x27;s as &quot;&quot; in sketches. Sebastian Wedler argued that this quartet bore the influence of Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Also Sprach Zarathustra&quot; in its germinal three-note motive, opening fugato of its third (development) section, and Nietzschean reading (via eternal recurrence) of Segantini&#x27;s triptych. In its opening harmonies, Allen Forte and Heinz-Klaus Metzger noted Webern&#x27;s anticipation of Schoenberg&#x27;s atonality in Op. 10.

In 1906, Schoenberg assigned Webern Bach chorales to harmonize and figure; Webern completed eighteen in a highly chromatic idiom. Then the Passacaglia, Op. 1 (1908) was his graduation piece, and the Op. 2 choral canons soon followed. The passacaglia&#x27;s chromatic harmonic language and less conventional orchestration distinguished it from prior works; its form foreshadowed those of his later works. Conducting the 1911 Danzig premiere of Op. 1 at the Friedrich-Wilhelm-, he paired it with Debussy&#x27;s 1894 &quot;Prélude à l&#x27;après-midi d&#x27;un faune&quot;, Ludwig Thuille&#x27;s 1896 &quot;Romantische Ouvertüre&quot;, and Mahler&#x27;s 1901–1904 &quot;Kindertotenlieder&quot; in a poorly attended concert. The &quot;&quot; critic derided Op. 1 as an &quot;insane experiment&quot;.

In 1908 Webern also began an opera on Maeterlinck&#x27;s &#x27;, of which only unfinished sketches remained, and in 1912 he wrote Berg that he had finished one or more scenes for another planned but unrealized opera, &quot;Die sieben Prinzessinnen&quot;, on Maeterlinck&#x27;s &#x27;. He had been an opera enthusiast from his student days. Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot; enraptured him twice in Dec. 1908 Berlin and again in 1911 Vienna. As a vocal coach and opera conductor, he knew the repertoire &quot;perfectly ... every cut, ... unmarked cadenza, and in the comic operas every theatrical joke&quot;. He &quot;adored&quot; Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Il Seraglio&quot; and revered Strauss, predicting &quot;Salome&quot; would last. When in high spirits, Webern would sing bits of Lortzing&#x27;s &quot;Zar und Zimmermann&quot;, a personal favorite. He expressed interest (to Max Deutsch) in writing an opera pending a good text and adequate time; in 1930, he asked Jone for &quot;opera texts, or rather dramatic texts&quot;, planning cantatas instead.

=== 1908–1914: Atonality and aphorisms ===
Webern&#x27;s music, like Schoenberg&#x27;s, was freely atonal after Op. 2. Some of their and Berg&#x27;s music from this time was published in &quot;Der Blaue Reiter&quot;. Schoenberg and Webern were so mutually influential, the former later joked, &quot;I haven&#x27;t the slightest idea who I am&quot;. In Op. 5/iii, Webern borrowed from Schoenberg&#x27;s Op. 10/ii. In Op. 5/iv, he borrowed from Schoenberg&#x27;s Op. 10/iv setting of &quot;Ich fühle luft von anderen planeten&quot;.

The first of Webern&#x27;s innovative and increasingly extremely aphoristic Opp. 5–11 (1909–1914) radically influenced Schoenberg&#x27;s Opp. 11/iii and 16–17 (and Berg&#x27;s Opp. 4–5). Here, considered, Webern did not seek &quot;the new ... in [music of] the past but in the future&quot;. In writing the Op. 9 bagatelles, Webern reflected in 1932, &quot;I had the feeling that when the twelve notes had all been played the piece was over.&quot; &quot;[H]aving freed music from the shackles of tonality,&quot; Schoenberg wrote, he and his pupils believed &quot;music could renounce motivic features&quot;. This &quot;intuitive aesthetic&quot; arguably proved to be aspirational insofar as motives persisted in their music.

Two enduring topics emerged in Webern&#x27;s work: familial (especially maternal) loss and memory, often involving some religious experience; and abstracted landscapes idealized as spiritual, even pantheistic, (e.g., the Preglhof, the Eastern Alps). Webern explored these ideas explicitly in his stage play &quot;Tot&quot; (&quot;Dead&quot;, Oct. 1913), which comprises six tableaux vivants set in the Alps, over the course of which a mother and father reflect on and come to terms with the loss of their son. He drew so heavily from Swedenborg&#x27;s theological doctrine of correspondences, quoting from &quot;Vera Christiana Religio&quot; at length, that Schoenberg considered the play unoriginal.

It is known that Webern sublimated these concerns into his music, particularly in the case of his Op. 6. Confiding in Berg and Schoenberg, Webern told the latter some about the programmatic narrative for that music in Jan. 1913, as Schoenberg prepared to premiere it at what would become the that March:

As Webern&#x27;s music took on the character of such static dramaticovisual scenes, his pieces frequently culminated in the accumulation and amalgamation (often the developing variation) of compositional material. Fragmented melodies frequently began and ended on weak beats, settled into or emerged from ostinati, and were dynamically and texturally faded, mixed, or contrasted. Tonality became less directional, functional, or narrative than tenuous, spatial, or symbolic as fit Webern&#x27;s topics and literary settings. Stein thought that &quot;his compositions should be understood as musical visions&quot;. Oliver Korte traced Webern&#x27;s to Mahler&#x27;s &quot;suspensions&quot;.

Expanding on Mahler&#x27;s orchestration, Webern linked colorful, novel, fragile, and intimate sounds, often nearly silent at , to lyrical topics: solo violin to female voice; closed or open voicings, sometimes , to dark or light respectively; compressed range to absence, emptiness, or loneliness; registral expansion to fulfillment, (spiritual) presence, or transcendence; celesta, harp, and glockenspiel to the celestial or ethereal; and trumpet, harp, and string harmonics to angels or heaven.

With elements of , neoclassicism, and ironic Romanticism in &quot;Pierrot lunaire&quot;, Op. 21 (1912), Schoenberg began to distance himself from Webern&#x27;s and latterly Berg&#x27;s aphoristic expressionism, which provoked the . Alma recalled Schoenberg telling her and Franz Werfel &quot;how much he was suffering under the dangerous influence of Webern&quot;, drawing on &quot;all his strength to extricate himself from it&quot;.

=== 1914–1924: Mid-period &quot;Lieder&quot; ===
During and after World War I (1914–1926) Webern worked on some fifty-six songs. He finished thirty-two, ordered into sets (in ways that do not always align with their chronology) as Opp. 12–19. Schoenberg&#x27;s recent vocal music had been motivated by the idea that &quot;absolute purity&quot; in composition couldn&#x27;t be sustained, and Webern took Schoenberg&#x27;s advice to write songs as a means of composing something more substantial than aphorisms, often making earnest settings of folk, lyric, or spiritual texts. The first of these mid-period was an unfinished setting of a passage (&quot;In einer lichten Rose ...&quot;) from Dante&#x27;s &quot;Paradiso&quot;, Canto XXXI.

By comparison to melodic &quot;atomization&quot; in Op. 11, Walter Kolneder noted relatively &quot;long arcs&quot; melodic writing in Op. 12 and polyphonic part writing to &quot;control the ... expression&quot; in Opp. 12–16 more generally. &quot;How much I owe to your &quot;Pierrot&quot;&quot;, Webern told Schoenberg after setting Trakl&#x27;s &quot;Abendland III&quot; (Op. 14/iv), in which, distinctly, there was no silence until a pause at the concluding gesture. The contrapuntal procedures and nonstandard ensemble of &quot;Pierrot&quot; are both evident in Webern&#x27;s Opp. 14–16.

Schoenberg &quot;yearn[ed] for a style for large forms ... to give personal things an objective, general form.&quot; Berg, Webern, and he had indulged their shared interest in Swedenborgian mysticism and Theosophy since 1906, reading Balzac&#x27;s &quot;Louis Lambert&quot; and &quot;Séraphîta&quot; and Strindberg&#x27;s &quot;Till Damaskus&quot; and &quot;Jacob lutte&quot;. Gabriel, protagonist of Schoenberg&#x27;s semi-autobiographical &quot;Die Jakobsleiter&quot; (1914–1922, rev. 1944) described a journey: &quot;whether right, whether left, forwards or backwards, uphill or down – one must keep on going without asking what lies ahead or behind&quot;, which Webern interpreted as a conceptual metaphor for (twelve-tone) pitch space. Schoenberg later reflected on &quot;how enthusiastic we were about this.&quot;

On the journey to composition with twelve tones, Webern revised many of his mid-period in the years after their apparent composition but before publication, increasingly prioritizing clarity of pitch relations, even against timbral effects, as Anne C. Shreffler and Felix Meyer described. His and Schoenberg&#x27;s music had long been marked by its contrapuntal rigor, formal schemes, systematic pitch organization, and rich motivic design, all of which they found in the music of Brahms before them. Webern had written music preoccupied with the idea of dodecaphony since at least the total chromaticism of his Op. 9 bagatelles (1911) and Op. 11 cello pieces (1914).

There are twelve-tone sets with repeated notes at the start of Op. 12/i and in some bars of Op. 12/iv, in addition to many ten- and eleven-tone sets throughout Op. 12. Webern wrote to Jalowetz in 1922 about Schoenberg&#x27;s lectures on &quot;a new type of motivic work&quot;, one that &quot;unfolds the entire development of, if I may say so, our technique (harmony, etc)&quot;. It was &quot;almost everything that has occupied me for about ten years&quot;, Webern continued. He regarded Schoenberg&#x27;s transformation of twelve-tone rows as the &quot;solution&quot; to their compositional concerns. In Op. 15/iv (1922), Webern first used a tone row (in the voice&#x27;s opening twelve notes), charted the four basic row forms, and integrated tri- and tetrachords into the harmonic and melodic texture. He systematically used twelve-tone technique for the first time in Op. 16/iv–v (1924).

=== 1924–1945: Formal coherence and expansion ===

With Schoenberg leaving Mödling in 1925 and this compositional approach at his disposal, Webern obtained more artistic autonomy and aspired to write in larger forms, expanding on the extreme concentration of expression and material in his earlier music. Until the &quot;Kinderstück&quot; for piano (1924, intended as one of a set), &quot;Klavierstück&quot; (1925), and &quot;Satz&quot; for string trio (1925), Webern had finished nothing but since a 1914 cello sonata. The 1926–1927 String Trio, Op. 20, was his first large-scale non-vocal work in more than a decade. For its 1927 publication, Webern helped Stein write an introduction emphasizing continuity with tradition:

Schoenberg exploited combinatorial properties of particular tone rows, but Webern focused on prior aspects of a row&#x27;s internal organization. He exploited small, invariant pitch subsets (or partitions) symmetrically derived via inversion, retrograde, or both (retrograde inversion). He understood his compositional (and precompositional) work with reference to ideas about growth, morphology, and unity that he found represented in Goethe&#x27;s &quot;&quot; and in Goethean science more generally.

Webern&#x27;s large-scale, non-vocal music in more traditional genres, written from 1926 to 1940, has been celebrated as his most rigorous and abstract music. Yet he always wrote his music and tried his new compositional procedures with concern for (or at least some latent reference to) expressivity and representation. In sketches for his Op. 22 quartet, Webern conceived of his themes in programmatic association with his experiences—as an &quot;outlook into the highest region&quot; or a &quot;coolness of early spring (Anninger, first flora, primroses, anemones, pasqueflowers)&quot;, for example. Studying his compositional materials and sketches, Bailey Puffett wrote, While writing the Concerto for Nine Instruments, Op. 24, Webern was inspired by the Sator square, which is like a twelve-tone matrix. He concluded his &quot;&quot; with this magic square.

In Webern&#x27;s late cantatas and songs, George Rochberg observed, &quot;the principles of &#x27;the structural spatial dimension&#x27; ... join[ed] forces with lyrico-dramatic demands&quot;. Specifically in his cantatas, Bailey Puffett wrote, Webern synthesized the rigorous style of his mature instrumental works with the word painting of his &quot;Lieder&quot; on an orchestral scale. Webern qualified the apparent connection between his cantatas and Bach&#x27;s as general and referred to connections between the second cantata and the music of the Franco-Flemish School. His textures became somewhat denser yet more homophonic at the surface through nonetheless contrapuntal polyphonic means. In Op. 31/i he alternated lines and points, culminating twice in twelve-note simultaneities.

At his death he left sketches for the movement of an apparent third cantata (1944–1945), first planned as a concerto, setting &quot;Das Sonnenlicht spricht&quot; from Jone&#x27;s &quot;Lumen&quot; cycle.

=== Arrangements and orchestrations ===

In his youth (1903), Webern orchestrated five or more Schubert for an appropriately Schubertian orchestra (strings and pairs of flutes, oboes, clarinets, bassoons, and horns). Among these were &quot;Der Vollmond Strahlt auf Bergeshöhn&quot; (the Romanze from &quot;Rosamunde&quot;), &quot;Tränenregen&quot; (from &quot;Die schöne Müllerin&quot;), &quot;Der Wegweiser&quot; (from &quot;Winterreise&quot;), &quot;Du bist die Ruh&quot;, and &quot;Ihr Bild&quot;.

After attending Hugo Wolf&#x27;s funeral and memorial concert (1903), he arranged three for a larger orchestra, adding brass, harp, and percussion to the Schubertian orchestra. He chose &quot;Lebe wohl&quot;, &quot;Der Knabe und das Immlein&quot;, and &quot;Denk es, o Seele&quot;, of which only the latter was finished or wholly survived.

For Schoenberg&#x27;s Society for Private Musical Performances in 1921, Webern arranged, among other music, the 1888 &quot;Schatz-Walzer&quot; (&quot;Treasure Waltz&quot;) of Johann Strauss II&#x27;s &quot;Der Zigeunerbaron&quot; (&quot;The Gypsy Baron&quot;) for string quartet, harmonium, and piano.

In 1924 Webern arranged Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Arbeiterchor&quot; (&quot;Workers&#x27; Chorus&quot;, c. 1847–1848) for bass solo, mixed chorus, and large orchestra; thus Liszt&#x27;s work was finally premièred when Webern conducted the first full-length concert of the Austrian Association of Workers Choir (13 and 14 March 1925). A review in the &quot;Wiener Zeitung&quot; (28 March 1925) read &quot;neu in jedem Sinne, frisch, unverbraucht, durch ihn zieht die Jugend, die Freude&quot; (&quot;new in every respect, fresh, vital, pervaded by youth and joy&quot;). The text (in English translation) read in part: &quot;Let us have the adorned spades and scoops,/Come along all, who wield a sword or pen,/Come here ye, industrious, brave and strong/All who create things great or small.&quot;

In orchestrating the six-voice ricercar from Bach&#x27;s &quot;Musical Offering&quot;, Webern timbrally defined the internal organization (or latent subsets) of the Bach&#x27;s subject. Joseph N. Straus argued that Webern (and other modernists) effectively recomposed earlier music, &quot;projecting motivic density&quot; onto tradition. After more conservatively orchestrating two of Schubert&#x27;s 1824 &quot;Six German Dances&quot; on UE commission in 1931, he wrote Schoenberg:

== Reception, influence, and legacy ==

Webern&#x27;s music was generally considered difficult by performers and inaccessible by listeners alike. &quot;To the limited extent that it was regarded&quot;, Milton Babbitt observed, it represented &quot;the ultimate in hermetic, specialized, and idiosyncratic composition&quot;.

Composers and performers first tended to take Webern&#x27;s work, with its residual post-Romanticism and initial expressionism, in mostly formalist directions with a certain literalism, departing from Webern&#x27;s own practices and preferences in extrapolating from elements of his late style. This became known as post-Webernism. A richer, more historically informed understanding of Webern&#x27;s music and his performance practice began to emerge in the latter half of the 20th century as scholars, especially the Moldenhauers, sought and archived sketches, letters, lectures, recordings, and other articles of Webern&#x27;s (and others&#x27;) estates.

In the immediate aftermath of World War II, Webern&#x27;s marginalization under &quot;Gleichschaltung&quot; was appreciated, but his pan-Germanism, politics, and social attitudes (especially regarding antisemitism) were not as known or often mooted. For many, like Stravinsky, Webern never compromised his artistic identity and values, but for others the matter was less simple.

=== Performance practice ===

Webern notated articulations, dynamics, , and other musical expressions, coaching performers to adhere to these instructions but urging them to maximize expressivity through musical phrasing. This was supported by personal accounts, correspondence, and extant recordings of Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Deutsche Tänze&quot; (arr. Webern) and Berg&#x27;s Violin Concerto under Webern&#x27;s direction. Ian Pace considered Peter Stadlen&#x27;s account of Webern&#x27;s coaching for Op. 27 as indicating Webern&#x27;s &quot;desire for an extremely flexible, highly diaphanous, and almost expressively overloaded approach&quot;.

This aspect of Webern&#x27;s work was often overlooked in his immediate post-war reception, which was roughly coterminous with the early music revival. Stravinsky engaged with Webern and Renaissance music in his later music; his amanuensis Craft performed Webern as well as Monteverdi, Schütz, Gabrieli, and Tallis. Many musicians performed &quot;music that is at the same time old and new&quot;, as Nicholas Cook and Anthony Pople glossed it and as Richard Taruskin addressed. J. Peter Burkholder noted early and new music audience overlap.

Felix Galimir of the Galimir Quartet told &quot;The New York Times&quot; (1981): &quot;Berg asked for enormous correctness in the performance of his music. But the moment this was achieved, he asked for a very Romanticized treatment. Webern, you know, was also terribly Romantic—as a person, and when he conducted. Everything was almost over-sentimentalized. It was entirely different from what we have been led to believe today. His music should be played very freely, very emotionally.&quot;

===Contemporaries===

==== Artists ====

Many artists portrayed Webern (often from life) in their work. Kokoschka (1912), Schiele (1917 and 1918), (1920 and 1924), and Rederer (1934) made drawings of him. Oppenheimer (1908), Kokoschka (1914), and (1934) painted him. Stumpp made two lithographs of him (1927). Humplik twice sculpted him (1927 and 1928). Jone variously portrayed him (1943 lithograph, several posthumous drawings, 1945 oil painting). Rederer made a large woodcut of him (1964).

==== Musicians ====
Schoenberg admired Webern&#x27;s concision, writing in the foreword to Op. 9 upon its 1924 publication: &quot;to express a novel in a single gesture, joy in a single breath—such concentration can only be present in proportion to the absence of self-indulgence&quot;. But Berg joked about Webern&#x27;s brevity. Hendrik Andriessen found Webern&#x27;s music &quot;pitiful&quot; in this regard. In their second (1925) &quot;Abbruch&quot; self-parody, &quot;&quot; editors jested that &quot;Webern&#x27;s&quot; (Mahler&#x27;s) &quot;extensive&quot; &quot;Symphony of a Thousand&quot; had to be abbreviated.

Felix Khuner remembered Webern was &quot;just as revolutionary&quot; as Schoenberg. In 1927, Hans Mersmann wrote that &quot;Webern&#x27;s music shows the frontiers and ... limits of a development which tried to outgrow Schoenberg&#x27;s work.&quot;

Identifying with Webern as a &quot;solitary soul&quot; amid 1940s wartime fascism, Dallapiccola independently and somewhat singularly found inspiration especially in Webern&#x27;s lesser-known mid-period &quot;Lieder&quot;, blending its ethereal qualities and Viennese expressionism with . Stunned by Webern&#x27;s Op. 24 at its 1935 ISCM festival world première under Jalowetz in Prague, Dallapiccola&#x27;s impression was of unsurpassable &quot;aesthetic and stylistic unity&quot;. He dedicated &quot;Sex carmina alcaei&quot; &quot;with humility and devotion&quot; to Webern, who he met in 1942 through Schlee, coming away surprised at Webern&#x27;s emphasis on &quot;our great Central European tradition.&quot; Dallapiccola&#x27;s 1953 &quot;Goethe-lieder&quot; especially recall Webern&#x27;s Op. 16 in style.

In 1947, Schoenberg remembered and stood firm with Berg and Webern despite rumors of the latter&#x27;s having &quot;fallen into the Nazi trap&quot;: &quot;... [F]orget all that might have ... divided us. For there remains for our future what could only have begun to be realized posthumously: One will have to consider us three—Berg, Schoenberg, and Webern—as a unity, a oneness, because we believed in ideals ... with intensity and selfless devotion; nor would we ever have been deterred from them, even if those who tried might have succeeded in confounding us.&quot; For Krasner this put &quot;&#x27;Vienna&#x27;s Three Modern Classicists&#x27; into historical perspective&quot;. He summarized it as &quot;what bound us together was our idealism.&quot;

===1947–1950s: (Re)discovery and post-Webernism===

After World War II, there was unprecedented engagement with Webern&#x27;s music. It came to represent a universally or generally valid, systematic, and compellingly logical model of new composition, especially at the . René Leibowitz performed, promulgated, and published &quot;Schoenberg et son école&quot;; Adorno, Herbert Eimert, Scherchen, and others contributed. Composers and students listened in a quasi-religious trance to Peter Stadlen&#x27;s 1948 Op. 27 performance.

Webern&#x27;s gradual innovations in schematic organization of pitch, rhythm, register, timbre, dynamics, articulation, and melodic contour; his generalization of imitative techniques such as canon and fugue; and his inclination toward athematicism, abstraction, and lyricism variously informed and oriented European and Canadian, typically serial or avant-garde composers (e.g., Messiaen, Boulez, Stockhausen, Luigi Nono, Pousseur, Ligeti, Sylvano Bussotti, Bruno Maderna, Bernd Alois Zimmermann, Barbara Pentland). Eimert and Stockhausen devoted a special issue of &quot;die Reihe&quot; to Webern&#x27;s in 1955. UE published his lectures in 1960.

In the US, Babbitt and initially Rochberg found more in Schoenberg&#x27;s twelve-tone practice. Elliott Carter&#x27;s and Aaron Copland&#x27;s critical ambivalence was marked by a certain enthusiasm and fascination nonetheless. Craft fruitfully reintroduced Stravinsky to Webern&#x27;s music, without which Stravinsky&#x27;s late works would have taken different shape. Stravinsky staked his contract with Columbia Records to see Webern&#x27;s then known music first both recorded and widely distributed. Stravinsky lauded Webern&#x27;s &quot;not yet canonized art&quot; in 1959.

Among the New York School, John Cage and Morton Feldman first met in Carnegie Hall&#x27;s lobby, ecstatic after a performance of Op. 21 by Dimitri Mitropoulos and the New York Philharmonic. They cited the effect of its &quot;sound&quot; on their music. They later sung the praises of Christian Wolff as &quot;our Webern&quot;.

Gottfried Michael Koenig suggested some early interest in Webern&#x27;s music may have been that its concision and apparent simplicity facilitated didactic musical analysis. criticized serial approaches to Webern&#x27;s music as reductive, narrowly focused more on Webern&#x27;s procedures than his music while neglecting timbre in their typical selection of Opp. 27–28. Webern&#x27;s music sounded like &quot;a Mondrian canvas&quot;, &quot;crude and unfinished&quot;, to Karel Goeyvaerts. Wolf-Eberhard von Lewinski criticized some Darmstadt music as &quot;acoustically absurd [if] visually amusing&quot; (&quot;&quot;, 1959); a &quot;Der Kurier&quot; article of his was headlined &quot;Meager modern music—only interesting to look at&quot;.

===1950s onward: Beyond (late) Webern===

Through late 1950s onward, Webern&#x27;s work reached musicians as far removed as Frank Zappa, yet many post-war European musicians and scholars had already begun to look beyond as much as &quot;back&quot; at Webern in his context. Nono advocated for a more humanistic understanding of Webern&#x27;s music.

Adorno lectured that in the prevailing climate &quot;artists like Berg or Webern would hardly be able to make it&quot; (&quot;The Aging of the New Music&quot;, 1954). Against the &quot;static idea of music&quot; and &quot;total rationalization&quot; of the &quot;pointillist constructivists,&quot; he advocated for more subjectivity, citing &quot;Über das Geistige in der Kunst&quot; (1911), in which Wassily Kandinsky wrote: &quot;Schoenberg&#x27;s [expressionist] music leads us to where musical experience is a matter not of the ear, but of the soul—and from this point begins the music of the future.&quot;

In the 1960s, many began to describe Webern and his like as a &quot;dead end&quot;. Rochberg felt &quot;Webern&#x27;s music leaves his followers no new, unexplored territory.&quot; Stravinsky judged Webern &quot;too original ... too purely himself. ... [T]he entire world had to imitate him [and] fail; of course it will blame Webern&quot;; he blamed post-Webernism: &quot;[T]he music now being charged to his name can neither diminish his strength nor stale his perfection.&quot;

In &quot;Votre Faust&quot; (1960–1968), Pousseur quoted and his protagonist Henri analyzed Webern&#x27;s Op. 31. Yet there were already several elements of late or postmodernism (e.g., eclecticism of historical styles, mobile form, polyvalent roles). This coincided with a wider rapprochement with Berg, whose example Pousseur cited, from whose music he also quoted, and whose writings he translated into French in the 1950s. Boulez was &quot;thrilled&quot; by Berg&#x27;s &quot;universe ... never completed, always in expansion—a world so ... inexhaustible,&quot; referring to the rigorously organized, only partly twelve-tone Chamber Concerto.

Engaging with Webern&#x27;s atonal works by some contrast to earlier post-Webernism, both Ferneyhough and Lachenmann expanded upon and went further than Webern in attention to the smallest of details and the use of ever more radically extended techniques. Ferneyhough&#x27;s 1967 Sonatas for string quartet included atonal sections much in the style of Webern&#x27;s Op. 9, yet more intensely sustained. In a comparison to his own 1969 &quot;Air&quot;, Lachenmann wrote of &quot;a melody made of a &quot;single&quot; note ... in the viola part&quot; of Webern&#x27;s Op. 10/iv (mm. 2–4) amid &quot;the mere ruins of the traditional linguistic context,&quot; observing that &quot;the pure tone, now living in tonal exile, has in this new context no aesthetic advantage over pure noise&quot; (&quot;Hearing [Hören] is Defenseless—without Listening [Hören]&quot;, 1985).

===Eastern Europe===
In Eastern Europe, the Second Viennese School&#x27;s music represented a professionally dangerous but sometimes exciting or inspiring alternative to socialist realism. Their influence on composers behind the Iron Curtain was mediated by anti-fascist and -German sentiment as well as anti-formalist cultural policies and Cold War separation. Ligeti lamented the separation and left in 1956, noting that &quot;after Bartók hardly any grass could grow&quot;.

====Eastern Bloc====
Webern&#x27;s influence predominated after the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, bearing on Pál Kadosa, Endre Szervánszky, and György Kurtág. Among Czechs, attended the and wrote music with serial techniques in the late 1960s. He returned to tonality in Brno and was rewarded. Marek Kopelent discovered the Second Viennese as an editor and was particularly taken by Webern. Kopelent was blacklisted for his music and despaired, unable to attend international performances of his work.

====Soviet Russia====
Official Soviet Russian condemnation eased in the post-Stalinist Khrushchev Thaw with the rehabilitation of some affected by the Zhdanov Doctrine. Sheet music and recordings entered via journalists, friends, family (e.g., from Nicolas to Sergei Slonimsky), and especially composers and musicians (e.g., , Gérard Frémy, Alexei Lubimov, Maria Yudina), who traveled more. Stationed in Zossen as a military band arranger (1955–1958), Yuri Kholopov risked arrest for obtaining scores in West Berlin and from the Leipzig office of Schott Music.

Philip Herschkowitz, poverty-stricken, taught privately in Moscow with cautious emphasis on Beethoven and the tradition from which Webern emerged. His pupil Nikolai Karetnikov taped Glenn Gould&#x27;s 1957 Moscow Conservatory performance of Webern&#x27;s Op. 27. In practice like that of Webern, Karetnikov derived the tone row of his Symphony No. 4 from motives as small as two notes related by semitone.

In &quot;Soviet Music&quot;, Marcel Rubin criticized &quot;Webern and His Followers&quot; (1959), by contrast to Berg and Schoenberg, for going too far. Alfred Schnittke complained in an open letter (1961) of composers&#x27; restricted education. Through Grigory Shneyerson&#x27;s anti-formalist &quot;On Music Living and Dead&quot; (1960) and Johannes Paul Thilman&#x27;s anti-modernist &quot;On the Dodecaphonic Method of Composition&quot; (1958), many (e.g., Eduard Artemyev, Victor Ekimovsky, Vladimir Martynov, Boris Tischenko) ironically learned more about what had been and even was still forbidden. Kruschchev warned, &quot;dodecaphonic music, music of noises ... this cacophonic music we totally reject. Our people cannot include such trash&quot;.

Through Andrei Volkonsky, Lydia Davydova recalled, Schoenberg&#x27;s and Webern&#x27;s music came to Russia alongside Renaissance and early Baroque music. Tischenko remembered that in the 1960s, Volkonsky &quot;was the first swallow of the avant-garde. [T]hose who came after him ... already followed in his tracks. I consider [him] the discoverer.&quot; Edison Denisov described the 1960s as his &quot;second conservatory&quot;, crediting Volkonsky not only for introducing Webern, but also Gesualdo.

This tolerance did not survive the Brezhnev Stagnation. Volkonsky emigrated in 1973, Herschkowitz in 1987, and of Khrennikov&#x27;s Seven (1979), Denisov, Elena Firsova, Sofia Gubaidulina, Dmitri Smirnov, and Viktor Suslin eventually emigrated.

===Dance===
Many choreographers set Webern&#x27;s music to dance. Martha Graham and George Balanchine choreographed several works in &quot;Episodes I&quot; and &quot;II&quot; respectively (1959) as a New York City Ballet &quot;novelty&quot;. John Cranko set &quot;Opus 1&quot; (1965) to Webern&#x27;s Passacaglia, Op. 1. Rudi van Dantzig choreographed Webern&#x27;s music in &quot;Ogenblikken&quot; (1968) and &quot;Antwoord gevend&quot; (1980); Glen Tetley in &quot;Praeludium&quot; (1978) and &quot;Contredanses&quot; (1979); Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker alongside that of Beethoven and Schnittke in &quot;Erts&quot; (1992); and Trisha Brown in &quot;Twelve Ton Rose&quot; (1996). Jiří Kylián set only Webern&#x27;s music in &quot;No More Play&quot; (1988) and &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; (1990), more often pairing it with that of other composers in several ballets (1984–1995).

===Since the 1980s: Reappraisals and historiography===
Webern&#x27;s legacy, bitterly contested in the &quot;serial wars&quot;, remained subject to polemic vicissitudes. Musicologists quarreled amid the &quot;Restoration of the 1980s&quot;, as Martin Kaltenecker termed a paradigm shift from structure to perception within musicological discourse. Charles Rosen scorned &quot;historical criticism ... avoiding any serious engagement with a work or style ... one happens not to like&quot;. Andreas Holzer warned of &quot;post-factual tendencies&quot;. Pamela M. Potter advised considering &quot;the complexity of ... day-to-day existence&quot; under Nazism, partly in considering the relevance of composers&#x27; politics to their canonic status. Meanwhile Allen Forte and Bailey Puffett formally analyzed Webern&#x27;s atonal and twelve-tone respectively.

Tim Page noted less formalist readings of Webern&#x27;s work at his 1983 birth centenary. The occasion &quot;went almost unmarked&quot;, Glenn Watkins observed, &quot;a fate hardly imaginable for Berg [on his] 1985 [centenary]&quot;. After Webern&#x27;s mid-century &quot;meteoric ascension and ultimate canonization&quot;, Watkins described &quot;quick shifts of interest&quot; tapering to neglect. Webern&#x27;s music was established but infrequent in standard (repeating) orchestral repertoire. His was played at the Venice Festival of Contemporary Music (1983), Juilliard (1995), and the Vienna Festival (2004), echoing six international festivals in his name (1962–1978). In some obscurity (1941 or 1942), Webern had been quietly sure that &quot;in the future even the postman will whistle my melodies!&quot; But many did not acquire such an aesthetic taste. He remained polarizing and provocative.

Noting this aspect of his reception, Johnson described Webern&#x27;s &quot;almost unique position in the canon of Western composers&quot;. Christian Thorau argued Webern&#x27;s innovations impeded his &quot;&quot;. By contrast to the &quot;concert canon&quot;, Shreffler considered Webern&#x27;s better standing in a &quot;separate canon&quot; of technical and formal innovation. Burkholder argued that music of the &quot;historicist tradition&quot;, including Webern&#x27;s, was secure in &quot;a musical museum&quot;, &quot;for that is what the concert hall has become&quot;. Mark Berry described Webern, already among Boulez&#x27;s &quot;big five&quot;, as one of five &quot;canonical pillars of classic historical early twentieth-century modernism&quot;. David H. Miller suggested Webern &quot;achieved a certain kind of acceptance and canonization&quot;.

Taruskin prioritized audience reception, not &quot;musical utopianism&quot;. He excoriated the Second Viennese School&#x27;s &quot;idiosyncratic view of the past&quot;, linking Webern and Adler to Eduard Hanslick and &quot;neo-Hegelian&quot; Franz Brendel; he criticized historical determinism, &quot;the natural ally of totalitarian politics.&quot; Martin Scherzinger noted that Taruskin&#x27;s criticisms sought &quot;active complicity with undesirable politics&quot;. Noted for his polemicism and revisionism, Taruskin described his &quot;dubious reputation&quot; on Webern and New Music and was praised and criticized by many. For Franklin Cox, Taruskin was an unreliable historian who opposed the Second Viennese School&#x27;s &quot;progressivist historicist&quot; emancipation of the dissonance with a &quot;reactionary historicist&quot; ideology of &quot;tonal restoration&quot;.

Pascal Decroupet observed an unquestioned &quot;canon of polarizations&quot; in prior histories. Johnson noted the &quot;co-existence and interaction of diverse stylistic practices&quot; with &quot;remarkable similarities&quot;, challenging &quot;conservative and progressive&quot; campism and decentering musicology&#x27;s technical periodizations via the of global modernity. Thus he ventured continuity between the &quot;broken homeland&quot; of Webern&#x27;s Opp. 12–18 and the &quot;broken pastoral&quot; of Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot; and Vaughan Williams&#x27; &quot;Pastoral&quot; Symphony; between Webern&#x27;s &quot;evanescent images of musical fullness&quot; and the brief, fragmentary nature of Chopin&#x27;s Op. 28, which Schumann likened to &quot;ruins&quot;. Building on Shreffler&#x27;s and Felix Meyer&#x27;s sketch studies as institutions like the acquired and made the Moldenhauers&#x27; estate accessible, Johnson worked toward a hermeneutics of Webern&#x27;s (and Mahler&#x27;s) music.

<doc id="65677" wikidata="Q36790" url="?curid=65677" title="Sumerian language">
<text>Sumerian () was the language of ancient Sumer. It is one of the oldest attested languages, dating back to at least 2900 BC. It is a local language isolate that was spoken in ancient Mesopotamia, in the area that is modern-day Iraq.

Akkadian, a Semitic language, gradually replaced Sumerian as the primary spoken language in the area (the exact date is debated), but Sumerian continued to be used as a sacred, ceremonial, literary, and scientific language in Akkadian-speaking Mesopotamian states such as Assyria and Babylonia until the 1st century AD. Thereafter, it seems to have fallen into obscurity until the 19th century, when Assyriologists began deciphering the cuneiform inscriptions and excavated tablets that had been left by its speakers.

In spite of its extinction, Sumerian exerted a significant impact on the languages of the area. The cuneiform script, originally used for Sumerian, was widely adopted by numerous regional languages such as Akkadian, Elamite, Eblaite, Hittite, Hurrian, Luwian and Urartian; it similarly inspired the Old Persian alphabet which was used to write the eponymous language. The impact was perhaps the greatest on Akkadian, whose grammar and vocabulary were significantly influenced by Sumerian.

==Stages==
The history of written Sumerian can be divided into several periods:

*Proto-literate period – c. 3100 BC to c. 3000 BC
*Archaic Sumerian – to 
*Old or Classical Sumerian – to 
*Old Akkadian Sumerian – c. 2350 – 2200 BC
*Neo-Sumerian – to , further divided into:
**Early Neo-Sumerian (Lagash II period) – c. 2200 BC to c. 2100 BC
**Late Neo-Sumerian (Ur III period) – c. 2100 BC to c. 2000 BC
*Old Babylonian Sumerian – c. 2000 BC to c. 1600 BC
*Post-Old Babylonian Sumerian – after .

The pictographic writing system used during the &quot;Proto-literate period&quot; (3200 BC – 3000 BC), corresponding to the Uruk III and Uruk IV periods in archeology, was still so rudimentary that there remains some scholarly disagreement about whether the language written with it is Sumerian at all, although it has been argued that there are some, albeit still very rare, cases of phonetic indicators and spelling that show this to be the case. The texts from this period are mostly administrative; there are also a number of sign lists, which were apparently used for the training of scribes.

The next period, &quot;Archaic Sumerian&quot; (3000 BC – 2500 BC), is the first stage of inscriptions that indicate grammatical elements, so the identification of the language is certain. It includes some administrative texts and sign lists from Ur (c. 2800 BC). Texts from Shuruppak and Abu Salabikh from 2600 to 2500 BC (the so-called Fara period or Early Dynastic Period IIIa) are the first to span a greater variety of genres, including not only administrative texts and sign lists, but also incantations, legal and literary texts (including proverbs and early versions of the famous works &quot;The Instructions of Shuruppak&quot; and &quot;The Kesh temple hymn&quot;). However, the spelling of grammatical elements remains optional, making the interpretation and linguistic analysis of these texts difficult.

The &quot;Old Sumerian period&quot; (2500-2350 BC) is the first one from which well-understood texts survive. It corresponds mostly to the last part of the Early Dynastic period (ED IIIb) and specifically to the First Dynasty of Lagash, from where the overwhelming majority of surviving texts come. The sources include important royal inscriptions with historical content as well as extensive administrative records. Sometimes included in the Old Sumerian stage is also the &quot;Old Akkadian&quot; period (c. 2350 BC – c. 2200 BC), during which Mesopotamia, including Sumer, was united under the rule of the Akkadian Empire. At this time Akkadian functioned as the primary official language, but texts in Sumerian (primarily administrative) did continue to be produced as well.

The first phase of the &quot;Neo-Sumerian period&quot; corresponds to the time of Gutian rule in Mesopotamia; the most important sources come from the autonomous Second Dynasty of Lagash, especially from the rule of Gudea, which has produced extensive royal inscriptions. The second phase corresponds to the unification of Mesopotamia under the Third Dynasty of Ur, which oversaw a &quot;renaissance&quot; in the use of Sumerian throughout Mesopotamia, using it as its sole official written language. There is a wealth of texts greater than from any preceding time – besides the extremely detailed and meticulous administrative records, there are numerous royal inscriptions, legal documents, letters and incantations. In spite of the dominant position of written Sumerian during the Ur III dynasty, it is controversial to what extent it was actually spoken or had already gone extinct in most parts of its empire. Some facts have been interpreted as suggesting that many scribes and even the royal court actually used Akkadian as their main spoken and native language. On the other hand, evidence has been adduced to the effect that Sumerian continued to be spoken natively and even remained dominant as an everyday language in Southern Babylonia, including Nippur and the area to its south.

By the &quot;Old Babylonian period&quot; (c. 2000 – c. 1600 BC), Akkadian had clearly supplanted Sumerian as a spoken language in nearly all of its original territory, whereas Sumerian continued its existence as a liturgical and classical language for religious, artistic and scholarly purposes. In addition, it has been argued that Sumerian persisted as a spoken language at least in a small part of Southern Mesopotamia (Nippur and its surroundings) at least until about 1900 BC and possibly until as late as 1700 BC. Nonetheless, it seems clear that by far the majority of scribes writing in Sumerian in this point were not native speakers and errors resulting from their Akkadian mother tongue become apparent. For this reason, this period as well as the remaining time during which Sumerian was written are sometimes referred to as the &quot;Post-Sumerian&quot; period. The written language of administration, law and royal inscriptions continued to be Sumerian in the undoubtedly Semitic-speaking successor states of Ur III during the so-called Isin-Larsa period (c. 2000 BC – c. 1750 BC). The Old Babylonian Empire, however, mostly used Akkadian in inscriptions, sometimes adding Sumerian versions.

The Old Babylonian period, especially its early part, has produced extremely numerous and varied Sumerian literary texts: myths, epics, hymns, prayers, wisdom literature and letters. In fact, nearly all preserved Sumerian religious and wisdom literature and the overwhelming majority of surviving manuscripts of Sumerian literary texts in general can be dated to that time, and it is often seen as the &quot;classical age&quot; of Sumerian literature. Conversely, far more literary texts on tablets surviving from the Old Babylonian period are in Sumerian than in Akkadian, even though that time is viewed as the classical period of Babylonian culture and language. However, it has sometimes been suggested that many or most of these &quot;Old Babylonian Sumerian&quot; texts may be copies of works that were originally composed in the preceding Ur III period or earlier, and some copies or fragments of known compositions or literary genres have indeed been found in tablets of Neo-Sumerian and Old Sumerian provenance. In addition, some of the first bilingual Sumerian-Akkadian lexical lists are preserved from that time (although the lists were still usually monolingual and Akkadian translations did not become common until the late Middle Babylonian period) and there are also grammatical texts - essentially bilingual paradigms listing Sumerian grammatical forms and their postulated Akkadian equivalents.

After the Old Babylonian period or, according to some, as early as 1700 BC, the active use of Sumerian declined. Scribes did continue to produce texts in Sumerian at a more modest scale, but generally with interlinear Akkadian translations and only part of the literature known in the Old Babylonian period continued to be copied after its end around 1600 BC. During the Middle Babylonian period, approximately from 1600 to 1000 BC, the Kassite rulers continued to use Sumerian in many of their inscriptions, but Akkadian seems to have taken the place of Sumerian as the primary language of texts used for the training of scribes and their Sumerian itself acquires an increasingly artificial and Akkadian-influenced form. In some cases a text may not even have been meant to be read in Sumerian; instead, it may have functioned as a prestigious way of &quot;encoding&quot; Akkadian via Sumerograms (cf. Japanese kanbun). Nonetheless, the study of Sumerian and copying of Sumerian texts remained an integral part of scribal education and literary culture of Mesopotamia and surrounding societies influenced by it and it retained that role until the eclipse of the tradition of cuneiform literacy itself in the beginning of the Common Era. The most popular genres for Sumerian texts after the Old Babylonian period were incantations, liturgical texts and proverbs; among longer texts, the classics &quot;Lugal-e&quot; and &quot;An-gim&quot; were most commonly copied.

Of the 29 royal inscriptions of the late second millennium BC 2nd dynasty of Isin about half were in Sumerian, described as &quot;hypersophisticated classroom Sumerian&quot;.

==Classification==
Sumerian is a language isolate. At one time it was widely held to be an Indo-European language, but that view has been almost universally rejected. Since decipherment began in the early 20th century, scholars have tried to relate Sumerian to a wide variety of languages. Because of its prestige as the first attested written language, proposals for linguistic affinity often have a nationalistic flavour. Attempts have been made without success to link Sumerian with a range of widely disparate groups such as Indo-European, Austroasiatic, Dravidian, Uralic,). Sino-Tibetan, and Turkic (the last being promoted by Turkish nationalists as part of the Sun language theory). Additionally, long-range proposals have attempted to include Sumerian in broad macrofamilies, often including other notable isolates like Basque or small families like Koreanic. Such proposals enjoy virtually no support among modern linguists, Sumerologists, and Assyriologists, and are typically seen as fringe theories due to their unverifiability.

It has also been suggested that the Sumerian language descended from a late prehistoric creole language (Høyrup 1992). However, no conclusive evidence beyond a handful of typological features can be found to support Høyrup&#x27;s view. A more widespread hypothesis posits a Proto-Euphratean language family that preceded Sumerian in Mesopotamia and exerted an areal influence on it, especially in the form of polysyllabic words that appear &quot;un-Sumerian&quot;—making them suspect of being loanwords—and are not traceable to any other known language family. There is little speculation as to the affinities of this hypothetical substratum language, or these languages, and it is thus best treated as unclassified. Other researchers disagree with the assumption of a single substratum language and argue that several languages are involved. A related proposal by Gordon Whittaker is that the language of the proto-literary texts from the Late Uruk period ( 3350–3100 BC) is really an early extinct branch of Indo-European language which he terms &quot;Euphratic&quot; which somehow emerged long prior to the accepted timeline for the spread of Indo-European into West Asia, though this is rejected by mainstream opinion which accepts Sumerian as a language isolate.

==Writing system==

===Development===

Pictographic proto-writing was used starting in c. 3300 BC. It is unclear what underlying language it encoded, if any. By c. 2800 BC, some tablets began using syllabic elements that clearly indicated a relation to the Sumerian language. Around 2600 BC, cuneiform symbols were developed using a wedge-shaped stylus to impress the shapes into wet clay. This &quot;cuneiform&quot; (&quot;wedge-shaped&quot;) mode of writing co-existed with the proto-cuneiform archaic mode. Deimel (1922) lists 870 signs used in the Early Dynastic IIIa period (26th century). In the same period the large set of logographic signs had been simplified into a logosyllabic script comprising several hundred signs. Rosengarten (1967) lists 468 signs used in Sumerian (pre-Sargonian) Lagash.

The cuneiform script was adapted to Akkadian writing beginning in the mid-third millennium. Over the long period of bi-lingual overlap of active Sumerian and Akkadian usage the two languages influenced each other, as reflected in numerous loanwords and even word order changes.

===Transliteration===
Depending on the context, a cuneiform sign can be read either as one of several possible logograms, each of which corresponds to a word in the Sumerian spoken language, as a phonetic syllable (V, VC, CV, or CVC), or as a determinative (a marker of semantic category, such as occupation or place). (See the article Cuneiform.) Some Sumerian logograms were written with multiple cuneiform signs. These logograms are called &quot;diri&quot;-spellings, after the logogram 𒋛𒀀 &quot;DIRI&quot; which is written with the signs 𒋛 &quot;SI&quot; and 𒀀 &quot;A&quot;. The text transliteration of a tablet will show just the logogram, such as the word &quot;dirig&quot;, not the separate component signs.

Not all epigraphists are equally reliable, and before publication of an important treatment of a text, scholars will often arrange to collate the published transliteration against the actual tablet, to see if any signs, especially broken or damaged signs, should be represented differently.

Our knowledge of the readings of Sumerian signs is based, to a great extent, on lexical lists made for Akkadian speakers, where they are expressed by means of syllabic signs. The established readings were originally based on lexical lists from the Neo-Babylonian Period, which were found in the 19th century; in the 20th century, earlier lists from the Old Babylonian Period were published and some researchers in the 21st century have switched to using readings from them. There is also variation in the degree to which so-called &quot;Auslauts&quot; or &quot;amissable consonants&quot; (morpheme-final consonants that stopped being pronounced at one point or another in the history of Sumerian) are reflected in the transliterations. This article generally used the versions with expressed Auslauts.

==Historiography==
The key to reading logosyllabic cuneiform came from the Behistun inscription, a trilingual cuneiform inscription written in Old Persian, Elamite and Akkadian. (In a similar manner, the key to understanding Egyptian hieroglyphs was the bilingual [Greek and Egyptian with the Egyptian text in two scripts] Rosetta stone and Jean-François Champollion&#x27;s transcription in 1822.)

In 1838 Henry Rawlinson, building on the 1802 work of Georg Friedrich Grotefend, was able to decipher the Old Persian section of the Behistun inscriptions, using his knowledge of modern Persian. When he recovered the rest of the text in 1843, he and others were gradually able to translate the Elamite and Akkadian sections of it, starting with the 37 signs he had deciphered for the Old Persian. Meanwhile, many more cuneiform texts were coming to light from archaeological excavations, mostly in the Semitic Akkadian language, which were duly deciphered.

By 1850, however, Edward Hincks came to suspect a non-Semitic origin for cuneiform. Semitic languages are structured according to consonantal forms, whereas cuneiform, when functioning phonetically, was a syllabary, binding consonants to particular vowels. Furthermore, no Semitic words could be found to explain the syllabic values given to particular signs. Julius Oppert suggested that a non-Semitic language had preceded Akkadian in Mesopotamia, and that speakers of this language had developed the cuneiform script.

In 1855 Rawlinson announced the discovery of non-Semitic inscriptions at the southern Babylonian sites of Nippur, Larsa, and Uruk.

In 1856, Hincks argued that the untranslated language was agglutinative in character. The language was called &quot;Scythic&quot; by some, and, confusingly, &quot;Akkadian&quot; by others. In 1869, Oppert proposed the name &quot;Sumerian&quot;, based on the known title &quot;King of Sumer and Akkad&quot;, reasoning that if Akkad signified the Semitic portion of the kingdom, Sumer might describe the non-Semitic annex.

Credit for being first to scientifically treat a bilingual Sumerian-Akkadian text belongs to Paul Haupt, who published &quot;Die sumerischen Familiengesetze&quot; (The Sumerian family laws) in 1879.

Ernest de Sarzec began excavating the Sumerian site of Tello (ancient Girsu, capital of the state of Lagash) in 1877, and published the first part of &quot;Découvertes en Chaldée&quot; with transcriptions of Sumerian tablets in 1884. The University of Pennsylvania began excavating Sumerian Nippur in 1888.

&quot;A Classified List of Sumerian Ideographs&quot; by R. Brünnow appeared in 1889.

The bewildering number and variety of phonetic values that signs could have in Sumerian led to a detour in understanding the language – a Paris-based orientalist, Joseph Halévy, argued from 1874 onward that Sumerian was not a natural language, but rather a secret code (a cryptolect), and for over a decade the leading Assyriologists battled over this issue. For a dozen years, starting in 1885, Friedrich Delitzsch accepted Halévy&#x27;s arguments, not renouncing Halévy until 1897.

François Thureau-Dangin working at the Louvre in Paris also made significant contributions to deciphering Sumerian with publications from 1898 to 1938, such as his 1905 publication of &quot;Les inscriptions de Sumer et d&#x27;Akkad&quot;. Charles Fossey at the Collège de France in Paris was another prolific and reliable scholar. His pioneering &quot;Contribution au Dictionnaire sumérien–assyrien&quot;, Paris 1905–1907, turns out to provide the foundation for P. Anton Deimel&#x27;s 1934 &quot;Sumerisch-Akkadisches Glossar&quot; (vol. III of Deimel&#x27;s 4-volume &quot;Sumerisches Lexikon&quot;).

In 1908, Stephen Herbert Langdon summarized the rapid expansion in knowledge of Sumerian and Akkadian vocabulary in the pages of &quot;Babyloniaca&quot;, a journal edited by Charles Virolleaud, in an article &quot;Sumerian-Assyrian Vocabularies&quot;, which reviewed a valuable new book on rare logograms by Bruno Meissner. Subsequent scholars have found Langdon&#x27;s work, including his tablet transcriptions, to be not entirely reliable.

In 1944, the Sumerologist Samuel Noah Kramer provided a detailed and readable summary of the decipherment of Sumerian in his &quot;Sumerian Mythology&quot;.

Friedrich Delitzsch published a learned Sumerian dictionary and grammar in the form of his &quot;Sumerisches Glossar&quot; and &quot;Grundzüge der sumerischen Grammatik&quot;, both appearing in 1914. Delitzsch&#x27;s student, Arno Poebel, published a grammar with the same title, &quot;Grundzüge der sumerischen Grammatik&quot;, in 1923, and for 50 years it would be the standard for students studying Sumerian. Another highly influential figure in Sumerology during much of the 20th century was Adam Falkenstein, who produced a grammar of the language of Gudea&#x27;s inscriptions. Poebel&#x27;s grammar was finally superseded in 1984 on the publication of &quot;The Sumerian Language: An Introduction to its History and Grammatical Structure&quot;, by Marie-Louise Thomsen. While there are various points in Sumerian grammar on which Thomsen&#x27;s views are not shared by most Sumerologists today, Thomsen&#x27;s grammar (often with express mention of the critiques put forward by Pascal Attinger in his 1993 &quot;Eléments de linguistique sumérienne: La construction de du11/e/di &#x27;dire&quot;) is the starting point of most recent academic discussions of Sumerian grammar.

More recent monograph-length grammars of Sumerian include Dietz Otto Edzard&#x27;s 2003 &quot;Sumerian Grammar&quot; and Bram Jagersma&#x27;s 2010 &quot;A Descriptive Grammar of Sumerian&quot; (currently digital, but soon to be printed in revised form by Oxford University Press). Piotr Michalowski&#x27;s essay (entitled, simply, &quot;Sumerian&quot;) in the 2004 &quot;The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the World&#x27;s Ancient Languages&quot; has also been recognized as a good modern grammatical sketch.

There is relatively little consensus, even among reasonable Sumerologists, in comparison to the state of most modern or classical languages. Verbal morphology, in particular, is hotly disputed. In addition to the general grammars, there are many monographs and articles about particular areas of Sumerian grammar, without which a survey of the field could not be considered complete.

The primary institutional lexical effort in Sumerian is the Pennsylvania Sumerian Dictionary project, begun in 1974. In 2004, the PSD was released on the Web as the ePSD. The project is currently supervised by Steve Tinney. It has not been updated online since 2006, but Tinney and colleagues are working on a new edition of the ePSD, a working draft of which is available online.

==Phonology==

Assumed phonological and morphological forms will be between slashes // and curly brackets {}, respectively, with plain text used for the standard Assyriological transcription of Sumerian. Most of the following examples are unattested. Note also that, not unlike most other pre-modern orthographies, Sumerian cuneiform spelling is highly variable, so the transcriptions and the cuneiform examples will generally show only one or at most a few common graphic forms out of many that may occur. Spelling practices have also changed significantly in the course of the history of Sumerian: the examples in the article will use the most phonetically explicit spellings attested, which usually means Old Babylonian or Ur III period spellings. except where an authentic example from another period is used.
Modern knowledge of Sumerian phonology is flawed and incomplete because of the lack of speakers, the transmission through the filter of Akkadian phonology and the difficulties posed by the cuneiform script. As I. M. Diakonoff observes, &quot;when we try to find out the morphophonological structure of the Sumerian language, we must constantly bear in mind that we are not dealing with a language directly but are reconstructing it from a very imperfect mnemonic writing system which had not been basically aimed at the rendering of morphophonemics&quot;.

=== Consonants ===
Early Sumerian is conjectured to have had at least the consonants listed in the table below. The consonants in parentheses are reconstructed by some scholars based on indirect evidence; if they existed, they were lost around the Ur III period in the late 3rd millennium BC.

* a simple distribution of six stop consonants in three places of articulation, originally distinguished by aspiration. In the late 3rd millennium BC, the unaspirated stops are thought to have become voiced in most positions (although not word-finally), whereas the voiceless aspirated stops maintained their aspiration.
** &quot;p&quot; (voiceless aspirated bilabial plosive),
** &quot;t&quot; (voiceless aspirated alveolar plosive),
** &quot;k&quot; (voiceless aspirated velar plosive),
*** As a rule, the voiceless aspirated consonants (&quot;p&quot;, &quot;t&quot; and &quot;k&quot;) did not occur word-finally.
** &quot;b&quot; (voiceless unaspirated bilabial plosive), later voiced;
** &quot;d&quot; (voiceless unaspirated alveolar plosive), later voiced;
** &quot;g&quot; (voiceless unaspirated velar plosive), later voiced.
* a phoneme usually represented by &quot;ř&quot; (sometimes written &quot;dr&quot;), which became or in northern and southern dialects, respectively, after the Old Akkadian period. It was first reconstructed as a voiced alveolar tap , but Bram Jagersma argues that it was a voiceless aspirated alveolar affricate because of its reflection in loanwords in Akkadian, among other reasons, and this view is accepted by Gábor Zólyomi (2017: 28). Other suggestions that have been made is that &quot;ř&quot; was a &quot;voiceless&quot; alveolar tap.
* a simple distribution of three nasal consonants in similar distribution to the stops:
** &quot;m&quot; (bilabial nasal),
** &quot;n&quot; (alveolar nasal),
** &quot;g̃&quot; (frequently printed &quot;ĝ&quot; due to typesetting constraints, increasingly transcribed as &quot;ŋ&quot;) (likely a velar nasal, as in &quot;sing&quot;, it has also been argued to be a labiovelar nasal or a nasalized labiovelar).
* a set of three sibilants:
** &quot;s&quot;, likely a voiceless alveolar fricative,
** &quot;z&quot;, likely a voiceless unaspirated alveolar affricate, , as shown by Akkadian loans from = to Sumerian . In early Sumerian, this would have been the unaspirated counterpart to &quot;ř&quot;. Like the stop series &quot;b&quot;, &quot;d&quot; and &quot;g&quot;, it is thought to have become voiced /dz/ in some positions in the late 3rd millennium.
** &quot;š&quot; (generally described as a voiceless postalveolar fricative, , as in &quot;ship&quot;
* &quot;ḫ&quot; (a velar fricative, , sometimes written &lt;h&gt;)
* two liquid consonants:
** &quot;l&quot; (a lateral consonant)
** &quot;r&quot; (a rhotic consonant), which Jagersma argues was realized as a tap because of various evidence suggesting its phonetic similarity to and .

The existence of various other consonants has been hypothesized based on graphic alternations and loans, though none have found wide acceptance. For example, Diakonoff lists evidence for two lateral phonemes, two rhotics, two back fricatives, and two g-sounds (excluding the velar nasal), and assumes a phonemic difference between consonants that are dropped word-finally (such as the &quot;g&quot; in 𒍠 &quot;zag&quot; &gt; &quot;za3&quot;) and consonants that remain (such as the &quot;g&quot; in 𒆷𒀝 &quot;lag&quot;). Other &quot;hidden&quot; consonant phonemes that have been suggested include semivowels such as and , and a glottal fricative or a glottal stop that could explain the absence of vowel contraction in some words—though objections have been raised against that as well. A recent descriptive grammar by Bram Jagersma includes , , and as unwritten consonants, with the glottal stop even serving as the first-person pronominal prefix. However, these unwritten consonants had been lost by the Ur III period according to Jagersma.

Very often, a word-final consonant was not expressed in writing—and was possibly omitted in pronunciation—so it surfaced only when followed by a vowel: for example the of the genitive case ending &quot;-ak&quot; does not appear in 𒂍𒈗𒆷 &quot;e2 lugal-la&quot; &quot;the king&#x27;s house&quot;, but it becomes obvious in 𒂍𒈗𒆷𒄰 &quot;e2 lugal-la-kam&quot; &quot;(it) is the king&#x27;s house&quot; (compare liaison in French). Jagersma believes that the lack of expression of word-final consonants was originally mostly a graphic convention, but that in the late 3rd millennium voiceless aspirated stops and affricates (, , and were, indeed, gradually lost in syllable-final position, as were the unaspirated stops and .

=== Vowels ===
The vowels that are clearly distinguished by the cuneiform script are , , , and . Various researchers have posited the existence of more vowel phonemes such as and even and , which would have been concealed by the transmission through Akkadian, as that language does not distinguish them. That would explain the seeming existence of numerous homophones in transliterated Sumerian, as well as some details of the phenomena mentioned in the next paragraph. These hypotheses are not yet generally accepted. Phonemic vowel length has also been posited by many scholars based on vowel length in Sumerian loanwords in Akkadian, occasional so-called &quot;plene&quot; spellings with extra vowel signs, and some internal evidence from alternations. However, scholars who believe in the existence of phonemic vowel length do not consider it possible to reconstruct the length of the vowels in most Sumerian words.

During the Old Sumerian period, the southern dialects (those used in the cities of Lagash, Umma, Ur and Uruk), which also provide the overwhelming majority of material from that stage, exhibited a vowel harmony rule based on vowel height or advanced tongue root. Essentially, prefixes containing /e/ or /i/ appear to alternate between /e/ in front of syllables containing open vowels and /i/ in front of syllables containing close vowels; e.g. 𒂊𒁽 &quot;e-kaš4&quot; &quot;he runs&quot;, but 𒉌𒁺 &quot;i3-gub&quot; &quot;he stands&quot;. Certain verbs with stem vowels spelt with /u/ and /e/, however, seem to take prefixes with a vowel quality opposite to the one that would have been expected according to this rule, which has been variously interpreted as an indication either of the existence of additional vowel phonemes in Sumerian or simply of incorrectly reconstructed readings of individual lexemes. The 3rd person plural dimensional prefix 𒉈 &quot;-ne-&quot; is also unaffected, which Jagersma believes to be caused by the length of its vowel. In addition, some have argued for a second vowel harmony rule.

There also appear to be many cases of partial or complete assimilation of the vowel of certain prefixes and suffixes to one in the adjacent syllable reflected in writing in some of the later periods, and there is a noticeable, albeit not absolute, tendency for disyllabic stems to have the same vowel in both syllables. These patterns, too, are interpreted as evidence for a richer vowel inventory by some researchers. For example, we find forms like 𒂵𒁽 &quot;ga-kaš4&quot; &quot;let me run&quot;, but, from the Neo-Sumerian period onwards, occasional spellings like 𒄘𒈬𒊏𒀊𒋧 &quot;gu2-mu-ra-ab-šum2&quot; &quot;let me give it to you&quot;. According to Jagersma, these assimilations are limited to open syllables and, as with vowel harmony, Jagersma interprets their absence as the result of vowel length or of stress in at least some cases. There is evidence of various cases of elision of vowels, apparently in unstressed syllables; in particular an initial vowel in a word of more than two syllables seems to have been elided in many cases. What appears to be vowel contraction in hiatus (*/aa/, */ia/, */ua/ &gt; &quot;a&quot;, */ae/ &gt; &quot;a&quot;, */ie/ &gt; &quot;i&quot; or &quot;e&quot;, */ue/ &gt; &quot;u&quot; or &quot;e&quot;, etc.) is also very common. There is some uncertainty and variance of opinion as to whether the result in each specific case is a long vowel or whether a vowel is simply replaced/deleted.

Syllables could have any of the following structures: V, CV, VC, CVC. More complex syllables, if Sumerian had them, are not expressed as such by the cuneiform script.

=== Stress ===
Sumerian stress is usually presumed to have been dynamic, since it seems to have caused vowel elisions on many occasions. Opinions vary on its placement. As argued by Bram Jagersma and confirmed by other scholars, the adaptation of Akkadian words of Sumerian origin seems to suggest that Sumerian stress tended to be on the last syllable of the word, at least in its citation form. The treatment of forms with grammatical morphemes is less clear. Many cases of apheresis in forms with enclitics have been interpreted as entailing that the same rule was true of the phonological word on many occasions, i.e. that the stress could be shifted onto the enclitics; however, the fact that many of these same enclitics have allomorphs with apocopated final vowels (e.g. /‑še/ ~ /-š/) suggests that they were, on the contrary, unstressed when these allomorphs arose. It has also been conjectured that the frequent assimilation of the vowels of non-final syllables to the vowel of the final syllable of the word may be due to stress on it. However, a number of &quot;suffixes&quot; and &quot;enclitics&quot; consisting of /e/ or beginning in /e/ are also assimilated and reduced.

In earlier scholarship, somewhat different views were expressed and attempts were made to formulate detailed rules for the effect of grammatical morphemes and compounding on stress, but with inconclusive results. Based predominantly on patterns of vowel elision, Adam Falkenstein argued that stress in monomorphemic words tended to be on the first syllable, and that the same applied without exception to reduplicated stems, but that the stress shifted onto the last syllable in a first member of a compound or idiomatic phrase, onto the syllable preceding a (final) suffix/enclitic, and onto the first syllable of the possessive enclitic /-ani/. In his view, single verbal prefixes were unstressed, but longer sequences of verbal prefixes attracted the stress to their first syllable. Jagersma has objected that many of Falkenstein&#x27;s examples of elision are medial and so, while the stress was obviously not on the medial syllable in question, the examples do not show where it &quot;was&quot;.

Joachim Krecher attempted to find more clues in texts written phonetically by assuming that geminations, plene spellings and unexpected &quot;stronger&quot; consonant qualities were clues to stress placement. Using this method, he confirmed Falkenstein&#x27;s views that reduplicated forms were stressed on the first syllable and that there was generally stress on the syllable preceding a (final) suffix/enclitic, on the penultimate syllable of a polysyllabic enclitic such as -/ani/, -/zunene/ etc., on the last syllable of the first member of a compound, and on the first syllable in a sequence of verbal prefixes. However, he found that single verbal prefixes received the stress just as prefix sequences did, and that in most of the above cases, another stress often seemed to be present as well: on the stem to which the suffixes/enclitics were added, on the second compound member in compounds, and possibly on the verbal stem that prefixes were added to or on following syllables. He also did not agree that the stress of monomorphemic words was typically initial and believed to have found evidence of words with initial as well as with final stress; in fact, he did not even exclude the possibility that stress was normally stem-final.

Pascal Attinger has partly concurred with Krecher, but doubts that the stress was &quot;always&quot; on the syllable preceding a suffix/enclitic and argues that in a prefix sequence, the stressed syllable wasn&#x27;t the first one, but rather the last one if heavy and the next-to-the-last one in other cases. Attinger has also remarked that the patterns observed may be the result of Akkadian influence - either due to linguistic convergence while Sumerian was still a living language or, since the data comes from the Old Babylonian period, a feature of Sumerian as pronounced by native speakers of Akkadian. The latter has also been pointed out by Jagersma, who is, in addition, sceptical about the very assumptions underlying the method used by Krecher to establish the place of stress.

===Orthography===

Sumerian writing expressed pronunciation only roughly. It was often morphophonemic, so much of the allomorphic variation could be ignored. Especially in earlier Sumerian, coda consonants were also often ignored in spelling; e.g. /mung̃areš/ &#x27;they put it here&#x27; could be written 𒈬𒃻𒌷 &quot;mu-g̃ar-re2&quot;. The use of VC signs for that purpose, producing more elaborate spellings such as 𒈬𒌦𒃻𒌷𒌍 &quot;mu-un-g̃ar-re2-eš3&quot;, became more common only in the Neo-Sumerian and especially in the Old Babylonian period.

Conversely, an intervocalic consonant, especially at the end of a morpheme followed by a vowel-initial morpheme, was usually &quot;repeated&quot; by the use of a CV sign for the same consonant; e.g. 𒊬 &quot;sar&quot; &quot;write&quot; - 𒊬𒊏 &quot;sar-ra&quot; &quot;written&quot;. This results in orthographic gemination that is usually reflected in Sumerological transliteration, but does not actually designate any phonological phenomenon such as length. It is also relevant in this context that, as explained above, many morpheme-final consonants seem to have been elided unless followed by a vowel at various stages in the history of Sumerian. These are traditionally termed s in Sumerology and may or may not be expressed in transliteration: e.g. the logogram 𒊮 for /šag/ &gt; /ša(g)/ &quot;heart&quot; may be transliterated as &quot;šag4&quot; or as &quot;ša3&quot;. Thus, when the following consonant appears in front of a vowel, it can be said to be expressed &quot;only&quot; by the next sign: for example, 𒊮𒂵 &quot;šag4-ga&quot; &quot;in the heart&quot; can also be interpreted as &quot;ša3-ga&quot;.

Of course, when a CVC sound sequence is expressed by a sequence of signs with the sound values CV-VC, that does not necessarily indicate a long vowel or a sequence of identical vowels either. To mark such a thing, so-called &quot;plene&quot; writings with an &quot;additional&quot; vowel sign repeating the preceding vowel were used, although that never came to be done systematically. A typical plene writing involved a sequence such as (C)V-V(-VC/CV), e.g. 𒂼𒀀 &quot;ama-a&quot; for /amaa/ &lt; {ama-e} &quot;the mother (ergative case)&quot;).

Sumerian texts vary in the degree to which they use logograms or opt for syllabic (phonetic) spellings instead: e.g. the word 𒃻 g̃ar &quot;put&quot; may also be written phonetically as 𒂷𒅈 &quot;g̃a2-ar&quot;. They also vary in the degree to which allomorphic variation was expressed, e.g. 𒁀𒄄𒌍 &quot;ba-gi4-eš or 𒁀𒄄𒅖 &quot;ba-gi4-iš for &quot;they returned&quot;. While early Sumerian writing was highly logographic, there was a tendency towards more phonetic spelling in the Neo-Sumerian period. Consistent syllabic spelling was employed when writing down the Emesal dialect (since the usual logograms would have been read in Emegir by default), for the purpose of teaching the language and often in recording incantations.

As already mentioned, texts written in the Archaic Sumerian period are difficult to interpret, because they often omit grammatical elements and determinatives. In addition, many literary-mythological texts from that period use a special orthographic style called UD.GAL.NUN, which seems to be based on substitution of certain signs or groups of signs for others. For example, the three signs 𒌓 UD, 𒃲 GAL and 𒉣 NUN, which the system is named for, are substituted for 𒀭 AN, 𒂗 EN, and 𒆤 LIL2 respectively, producing the name of the god &quot;den-lil2&quot;. The motivation for this practice is mysterious; it has been suggested that it was a kind of cryptography. Texts written in UD.GAL.NUN are still understood very poorly and only partially.

==Grammar==

Ever since its decipherment, research of Sumerian has been made difficult by the relative sparseness of linguistic data, the apparent lack of a closely related language, and the features of the writing system. A further oft-mentioned and paradoxical problem for the study of Sumerian is that the most numerous and varied texts written in the most phonetically explicit and precise orthography are only dated to periods when the scribes themselves were no longer native speakers and often demonstrably had less-than-perfect command of the language they were writing in; conversely, for much of the time during which Sumerian was still a living language, the surviving sources are few, unvaried and/or written in an orthography that is more difficult to interpret.

Typologically, Sumerian is classified as an agglutinative, ergative (consistently so in its nominal morphology and split ergative in its verbal morphology), and subject-object-verb language.

===Nominal morphology===

==== Noun phrases ====
The Sumerian noun is typically a one or two-syllable root ( &quot;eye&quot;, &quot;house, household&quot;, 𒎏 &quot;lady&quot;), although there are also some roots with three syllables like &quot;market&quot;. There are two semantically predictable grammatical genders, which have traditionally been called animate and inanimate, although these names do not express their membership exactly, as explained below.

The adjectives and other modifiers follow the noun ( &quot;great king&quot;). The noun itself is not inflected; rather, grammatical markers attach to the noun phrase as a whole, in a certain order. Typically, that order would be:

An example may be: 

The possessive, plural and case markers are traditionally referred to as &quot;suffixes&quot;, but have recently also been described as enclitics or postpositions.

===== Gender =====
The two genders have been variously called animate and inanimate, human and non-human, or personal/person and impersonal/non-person. Their assignment is semantically predictable: the first gender includes humans and gods, while the second one includes animals, plants, non-living objects, abstract concepts, and groups of humans. Since the second gender includes animals, the use of the terms animate and inanimate is somewhat misleading and conventional, but it is most common in the literature, so it will be maintained in this article.

There are some minor deviations from the gender assignment rules, for example:

* The word for &quot;statue&quot; may be treated as animate.

* Words for slaves such as &quot;slave woman&quot; and &quot;head&quot;, used in its secondary sense of &quot;slave&quot;, may be treated as inanimate.

* In fable-like contexts, which occur frequently in Sumerian proverbs, animals are usually treated as animate.

===== Number =====
The plural marker proper is (𒂊)𒉈 /-(e)ne/. It is used only with nouns of the animate gender and its use is optional. It is often omitted when other parts of the clause indicate the plurality of the referent. Thus, it is not used if the noun is modified by a numeral (&quot;𒇽&quot;𒁹𒁹𒁹 &quot;lu2 eš5&quot; &quot;three men&quot;). It has also been observed that until the Ur III period, the marker generally isn&#x27;t used in a noun phrase in the absolutive case, unless this is necessary for disambiguation. Instead, the plurality of the absolutive participant is commonly expressed only by the form of the verb in the clause: e.g. &quot;𒇽𒁀𒀄𒀄𒌍 lu2 ba-zaḫ3-zaḫ3-eš &quot;the men ran away&quot;, 𒇽𒈬𒅇𒆪𒁉𒌍 &quot;lu2 mu-u3-dab5-be2-eš &quot;I caught the men&quot;. The plural marker is not used when referring to a group of people, because a group of people is treated as inanimate; e.g. 𒀳 &quot;engar&quot; &quot;farmer&quot; with no plural marker may refer to &quot;(the group of) farmers&quot;.

As the following example shows, the marker is appended to the end of the phrase, even after a relative clause:

Likewise, the plural marker is usually (albeit not always) added only once when a whole series of coordinated nouns have plural reference:

Another way in which a kind of plurality is expressed is by means of reduplication of the noun: 𒀭𒀭 &quot;dig̃ir-dig̃ir&quot; &quot;gods&quot;, 𒌈𒌈 &quot;ib2-ib2&quot; &quot;hips&quot;. However, this construction is usually considered to have a more specialized meaning, variously interpreted as totality (&quot;all the gods&quot;, &quot;both of my hips&quot;) or distribution/separateness (&quot;each of the gods taken separately&quot;). An especially frequently occurring reduplicated word, 𒆳𒆳 &quot;kur-kur&quot; &quot;foreign lands&quot;, may have simply plural meaning, and in very late usage, the meaning of the reduplication in general might be simple plurality.

At least a few adjectives (notably 𒃲 &quot;gal&quot; &quot;great&quot; and 𒌉 &quot;tur&quot; &quot;small&quot;) are also reduplicated when the noun they modify has plural reference: 𒀀𒃲𒃲 &quot;a gal-gal&quot; &quot;the great waters&quot;. In that case, the noun itself is not reduplicated. This is sometimes interpreted as an expression of simple plurality, while a minority view is that the meaning of these forms is not purely plural, but rather the same as that of noun reduplication.

Two other ways of expressing plurality are characteristic only of very late Sumerian usage and have made their way into Sumerograms used in writing Akkadian and other languages. One is used with inanimate nouns and consists of the modification of the noun with the adjective 𒄭𒀀 &quot;ḫi-a&quot; &quot;various&quot; (lit. &quot;mixed&quot;), e.g. 𒇻𒄭𒀀 &quot;udu ḫi-a&quot; &quot;sheep&quot;. The other is adding the 3rd person plural form of the enclitic copula 𒈨𒌍 &quot;-me-eš&quot; to a noun (𒈗𒈨𒌍 &quot;lugal-me-eš&quot; &quot;kings&quot;, originally &quot;they (who) are kings&quot;).

===== Case =====

====== Case markers ======
The generally recognized case markers are:
The final vowels of most of the above markers are subject to loss if they are attached to vowel-final words.

In addition, there are the enclitic particles 𒈾𒀭𒈾 &quot;na-an-na&quot; meaning &quot;without&quot; and (𒀀)𒅗𒉆 &quot;(-a)-ka-nam&quot; -/akanam/ (in earlier Sumerian) or (𒀀)𒆤𒌍 &quot;(-a)-ke4-eš2&quot; -/akeš/ &quot;because of&quot; (in later Sumerian).

Note that these nominal cases enter interact with the so-called &quot;dimensional prefixes&quot; of the verb that the noun modifies, producing additional meanings. While the dative and directive are in complementary distribution in the noun, they can nevertheless be distinguished when the verbal prefixes are taken into account. Likewise, whereas the meanings &quot;in(to)&quot; and &quot;on(to)&quot; are expressed by the same nominal case, they can be disambiguated by the verbal prefixes. This is explained in more detail in the section on &quot;Dimensional prefixes.&quot;

Additional spatial or temporal meanings can be expressed by genitive phrases like &quot;at the head of&quot; = &quot;above&quot;, &quot;at the face of&quot; = &quot;in front of&quot;, &quot;at the outer side of&quot; = &quot;because of&quot;, etc.:

The embedded structure of the noun phrase can be further illustrated with the following phrase:

Here, the first genitive morpheme (&quot;-a(k)&quot;) subordinates 𒋠 &quot;siki&quot; &quot;wool&quot; to 𒇻 &quot;udu&quot; &quot;sheep&quot;, and the second subordinates 𒇻𒋠 &quot;udu siki-(a)k&quot; &quot;sheep of wool&quot; (or &quot;woolly sheep&quot;) to 𒉺𒇻 &quot;sipad&quot; &quot;shepherd&quot;.

====== Case usage ======
The uses of the ergative and absolutive case are those typical of ergative languages. The subject of an intransitive verb such as &quot;come&quot; is in the same case as the object of a transitive verb such as &quot;build&quot;, namely the so-called &quot;absolutive&quot; case. In contrast, the subject of a transitive verb has a different case, which is termed &quot;ergative&quot;. This can be illustrated with the following examples:

In contrast with the verbal morphology, Sumerian nominal morphology consistently follows this ergative principle regardless of tense/aspect, person and mood.

Besides the general meanings of the case forms outlined above, there are many lexically determined and more or less unpredictable uses of specific cases, often governed by a certain verb in a certain sense:

* The comitative is used to express:
** &quot;to run away&quot; (e.g. 𒀄 &quot;zaḫ3&quot;) or to &quot;take away&quot; (e.g. 𒋼𒀀 &quot;kar&quot;) &quot;from&quot; somebody; 
** 𒍪 &quot;zu&quot; &quot;to know/learn something &quot;from&quot; somebody&quot;;
** 𒁲 &quot;sa2&quot; &quot;to be equal &quot;to&quot; somebody&quot; (but the same verb uses the directive in the phrasal verb &quot;si&quot; ...&quot;sa2&quot; &quot;be/put something in order&quot;, see &quot;Phrasal verbs&quot;);
** the meaning &quot;ago&quot; in the construction 𒈬𒁕...𒋫 &quot;mu-da X-ta&quot; &quot;X years ago&quot; (lit. &quot;since X with the years&quot;)
* The directive is used to express:
** the objects of 𒍏 &quot;dab6&quot; &quot;surround&quot;, 𒊏 &quot;raḫ2&quot; &quot;hit&quot;, 𒋛 &quot;si&quot; &quot;fill&quot;, 𒋳 &quot;tag&quot; &quot;touch&quot;
** &quot;𒈭 daḫ&quot; &quot;add something &quot;to&quot; something&quot; 
** 𒄄 &quot;gi4&quot; in the sense &quot;bring back something &quot;to&quot; something&quot;
** 𒍑 &quot;us2&quot; &quot;be next &quot;to&quot; something, follow something&quot;
** 𒅗 &quot;dug4&quot; &quot;say something &quot;about&quot;/&quot;concerning&quot; something&quot; ({b-i-dug} &quot;say something &quot;about this&quot;&quot; often seems to have very vague reference, approaching the meaning &quot;say something &quot;then&quot;&quot;)
* The locative with a directive verbal prefix, expressing &quot;on(to)&quot;, is used to express:
** 𒆕 &quot;řu2&quot; &quot;hold on &quot;to&quot; something&quot;
** 𒄷𒈿 &quot;sa4&quot; &quot;give (as a name)&quot; &quot;to&quot; somebody/something
** &quot;𒁺 tum2&quot; &quot;be fit &quot;for&quot; something&quot;
* 𒉚 sa&quot;10&quot; &quot;to barter&quot; governs, in the sense to &quot;to buy&quot;, the terminative to introduce the seller &quot;from&quot; whom something is bought, but in another construction it uses the locative for the thing something is bartered &quot;for;&quot;
* 𒋾 &quot;ti&quot; &quot;to approach&quot; governs the dative.

For the government of phrasal verbs, see the relevant section.

==== Pronouns ====
The attested personal pronouns are:

The stem vowels of &quot;𒂷&quot;(&quot;𒂊&quot;) &quot;g̃e26(-e)&quot; and &quot;𒂊 ze2&quot; are assimilated to a following case suffix containing /a/ and then have the forms &quot;𒂷 g̃a-&quot; and 𒍝 &quot;za-;&quot; e.g. 𒍝𒊏 &quot;za-ra&quot; &#x27;to you (sg.)&#x27;.

As far as demonstrative pronouns are concerned, Sumerian most commonly uses the enclitic &quot;𒁉 -bi&quot; to express the meaning &quot;this&quot;. There are rare instances of other demonstrative enclitics such as 𒂊 &quot;-e&quot; &quot;this&quot;, 𒊺 &quot;-še&quot; &quot;that&quot; and 𒊑 &quot;-re&quot; &quot;that&quot;. The difference between the three has been explained in terms of increasing distance from the speaker or as a difference between proximity to the speaker, proximity to the listener and distance from both, akin to the Japanese or Latin three-term demonstrative system. The independent demonstrative pronouns are 𒉈𒂗/𒉈𒂊 &quot;ne-e&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) &quot;this (thing)&quot; and 𒄯 &quot;ur5&quot; &quot;that (thing)&quot;; &quot;-ne(n)&quot; might also be used as another enclitic. &quot;Now&quot; is 𒉌𒉈𒂠 &quot;i3-ne-eš2&quot; or 𒀀𒁕𒀠 &quot;a-da-al&quot;. For &quot;then&quot; and &quot;there&quot;, the declined noun phrases 𒌓𒁀 &quot;ud-ba&quot; &quot;at that time&quot; and 𒆠𒁀 &quot;ki-ba&quot; &quot;at that place&quot; are used; &quot;so&quot; is 𒄯𒁶 &quot;ur5&quot;-&quot;gen7&quot;, lit. &quot;like that&quot;.

The interrogative pronouns are 𒀀𒁀 &quot;a-ba&quot; &quot;who&quot; and 𒀀𒈾 &quot;a-na&quot; &quot;what&quot; (also used as &quot;whoever&quot; and &quot;whatever&quot; when introducing dependent clauses). The stem for &quot;where&quot; is 𒈨 &quot;me-&quot; (used in the locative, terminative and ablative to express &quot;where&quot;, &quot;whither&quot; and &quot;whence&quot;, respectively) . &quot;When&quot; is 𒇷/𒂗 &quot;en3&quot;/&quot;en&quot;, but also the stem 𒈨(𒂊)𒈾 &quot;me-(e)-na&quot; is attested for &quot;when&quot; (in the emphatic form &quot;me-na-am3&quot; and in the terminative &quot;me-na-še3&quot; &quot;until when?&quot;, &quot;how long?&quot;). &quot;How&quot; and &quot;why&quot; are expressed by 𒀀𒈾𒀸 &quot;a-na-aš&quot; (lit. &quot;what for?&quot;) and 𒀀𒁶 &quot;a&quot;-&quot;gen7&quot; &quot;how&quot; (an equative case form, perhaps &quot;like what?&quot;). The expected form 𒀀𒈾𒁶 &quot;a-na-gen7&quot; is used in Old Babylonian.

An indefinite pronoun is 𒈾𒈨 &quot;na-me&quot; &quot;any&quot;, which is only attested in attributive function until the Old Babylonian period, but may also stand alone in the sense &quot;anyone, anything&quot; in late texts. It can be added to nouns to produce further expressions with pronominal meaning such as 𒇽𒈾𒈨 &quot;lu2 na-me&quot; &quot;anyone&quot;, 𒃻𒈾𒈨 &quot;nig̃2 na-me&quot; &quot;anything&quot;, 𒆠𒈾𒈨 &quot;ki na-me&quot; &quot;anywhere&quot;, 𒌓𒈾𒈨 &quot;ud4 na-me&quot; &quot;ever, any time&quot;. The nouns 𒇽 &quot;lu2&quot; &quot;man&quot; and 𒃻 &quot;nig̃2&quot; &quot;thing&quot; are also used for &quot;someone, anyone&quot; and &quot;something, anything&quot;. With negation, all of these expressions naturally acquire the meanings &quot;nobody&quot;, &quot;nothing&quot;, &quot;nowhere&quot; and &quot;never&quot;.

The reflexive pronoun is 𒅎(𒋼) &quot;ni2&quot;(&quot;-te&quot;) &quot;self&quot;, which generally occurs with possessive pronouns attached: 𒅎&quot;𒈬 ni2-g̃u10&quot; &quot;my-self&quot;, etc. The longer form appears in the third person animate (𒅎𒋼𒉌 &quot;ni2-te-ni&quot; &quot;him/herself&quot;, 𒅎𒋼𒉈𒉈 &quot;ni2-te-ne-ne&quot; &quot;themselves&quot;)&quot;.&quot;

==== Adjectives ====
It is controversial whether Sumerian has adjectives at all, since nearly all stems with adjectival meaning are also attested as verb stems and may be conjugated as verbs: 𒈤 &quot;maḫ&quot; &quot;great&quot; &gt; 𒎏𒀠𒈤 &quot;nin al-maḫ&quot; &quot;the lady is great&quot;. Jagersma believes that there is a distinction in that the few true adjectives cannot be negated, and a few stems are different depending on the part of speech: 𒃲 &quot;gal&quot; &quot;big&quot;, but 𒄖𒌌 &quot;gu-ul&quot; &quot;be big&quot;. Furthermore, stems with adjective-like meaning sometimes occur with the nominalizing suffix /-a/, but their behaviour varies in this respect. Some stems appear to require the suffix always: e.g. 𒆗𒂵 &quot;kalag-ga&quot; &quot;mighty&quot;, 𒊷𒂵 &quot;sag9-ga&quot; &quot;beautiful&quot;, 𒁍𒁕 &quot;gid2-da&quot; &quot;long&quot; (these are verbs with adjectival meaning according to Jagersma). Some never take the suffix: e.g. 𒃲 &quot;gal&quot; &quot;big&quot;, 𒌉 &quot;tur&quot; &quot;small&quot; and 𒈤 &quot;maḫ&quot; &quot;great&quot; (these are genuine adjectives according to Jagersma). Finally, some alternate: 𒍣 &quot;zid&quot; &quot;right&quot; often occurs as 𒍣𒁕 &quot;zid-da&quot; (these are pairs of adjectives and verbs derived from them, respectively, according to Jagersma). In the latter case, attempts have been made to find a difference of meaning between the forms with and without &quot;-a&quot;; it has been suggested that the form with &quot;-a&quot; expresses a kind of determination, e.g. &quot;zid&quot; &quot;righteous, true&quot; vs &quot;zid-da&quot; &quot;right (not left)&quot;, or restrictiveness, e.g. 𒂍𒉋 &quot;e2 gibil&quot; &quot;a new house&quot; vs 𒂍𒉋𒆷 &quot;e2 gibil-la&quot; &quot;the new house (as contrasted with the old one)&quot;, &quot;a/the newer (kind of) house&quot; or &quot;the newest house&quot;, as well as nominalization, e.g. &quot;tur-ra&quot; &quot;a/the small one&quot; or &quot;a small thing&quot;. Other scholars have remained sceptical about the posited contrasts.

A few adjectives, like 𒃲 &quot;gal&quot; &quot;big&quot; and 𒌉 &quot;tur&quot; &quot;small&quot; appear to &quot;agree in number&quot; with a preceding noun in the plural by reduplication; with some other adjectives, the meaning seems to be &quot;each of them ADJ&quot;. The colour term 𒌓(𒌓) &quot;bar6&quot;-&quot;bar6&quot; / &quot;babbar&quot; &quot;white&quot; appears to have always been reduplicated, and the same may be true of 𒈪 &quot;gig2&quot; (actually &quot;giggig&quot;) &quot;black&quot;.

To express the comparative or superlative degree, various constructions with the word 𒋛𒀀 &quot;dirig&quot; &quot;exceed&quot;/&quot;excess&quot; are used: X + locative + &quot;dirig-ga&quot; &quot;which exceeds (all) X&quot;, &quot;dirig&quot; + X + genitive + terminative &quot;exceeding X&quot;, lit. &quot;to the excess of X&quot;.

==== Adverbs and adverbial expressions ====
Most commonly, adverbial meanings are expressed by noun phrases in a certain case, e.g. 𒌓 &quot;ud-ba&quot; &quot;then&quot;, lit. &quot;at that time&quot;.

There are two main ways to form an adverb of manner:

* There is a dedicated adverbiative suffix 𒂠 &quot;-eš2&quot;, which can be used to derive adverbs from both adjectives and nouns: 𒍣𒉈𒂠 &quot;zid-de3-eš2&quot; &quot;rightly&quot;, &quot;in the right way&quot;, 𒆰𒂠 &quot;numun-eš2&quot; &#x27;as seeds&#x27;, &#x27;in the manner of seeds&#x27;.
* the enclitic 𒁉 &quot;-bi&quot; can be added to an adjectival stem: 𒉋𒁉 &quot;gibil-bi&quot; &quot;newly&quot;. This, too, is interpreted by Jagersma as a deadjectival noun with a possessive clitic in the directive case: {gibil.∅.bi-e}, lit. &quot;at its newness&quot;.

For pronominal adverbs, see the section on Pronouns.

====Numerals====
Sumerian has a combination decimal and sexagesimal system (for example, 600 is &#x27;ten sixties&#x27;), so that the Sumerian lexical numeral system is sexagesimal with 10 as a subbase. The cardinal numerals and ways of forming composite numbers are as follows:

Ordinal numerals are formed with the suffix 𒄰𒈠 &quot;-kam-ma&quot; in Old Sumerian and 𒄰(𒈠) &quot;-kam(-ma)&quot; (with the final vowel still surfacing in front of enclitics) in subsequent periods. However, a cardinal numeral may also have ordinal meaning sometimes.

The syntax of numerals has some peculiarities. Besides just being placed after a noun like other modifiers (𒌉𒐈 &quot;dumu eš5&quot; &quot;three children&quot; - which may, however, also be written 𒐈𒌉 &quot;3 dumu&quot;), the numeral may be reinforced by the copula (𒌉𒐈𒀀𒀭 &quot;dumu eš5&quot;-&quot;am3&quot;, lit. &quot;the children, being three&quot;. Finally, there is a third construction in which the possessive pronoun 𒁉 -&quot;bi&quot; is added after the numeral, which gives the whole phrase a definite meaning: 𒌉𒐈𒀀𒁉 &quot;dumu eš5&quot;-&quot;a-bi&quot;: &quot;&quot;the&quot; three children&quot; (lit. &quot;children - the three of them&quot;). The numerals 𒈫 &quot;min&quot; &quot;two&quot; and 𒐈 &quot;eš5&quot; &quot;three&quot; are also supplied with the nominalizing marker &quot;-a&quot; before the pronoun, as the above example shows.

Fractions are formed with the phrase 𒅆...N...𒅅 &quot;igi-&quot;N-&quot;g̃al2&quot; : &quot;one-Nth&quot;; where 𒅅 &quot;g̃al2&quot; may be omitted. &quot;One-half&quot;, however, is 𒋗𒊒𒀀 &quot;šu-ru-a&quot;, later 𒋗𒊑𒀀 &quot;šu-ri-a.&quot; Another way of expressing fractions was originally limited to weight measures, specifically fractions of the mina (𒈠𒈾 &quot;ma-na&quot;): 𒑚 &quot;šuššana&quot; &quot;one-third&quot; (literarlly &quot;two-sixths&quot;), 𒑛 &quot;šanabi&quot; &quot;two-thirds&quot; (the former two words are of Akkadian origins), 𒑜 &quot;gig̃usila&quot; or 𒇲𒌋𒂆 &quot;la2 gig̃4 u&quot; &quot;five-sixths&quot; (literally &quot;ten shekels split off (from the mina)&quot; or &quot;(a mina) minus ten shekels&quot;, respectively), 𒂆 &quot;gig̃4&quot; &quot;one-sixtieth&quot;, lit. &quot;a shekel&quot; (since a shekel is one-sixtieth of a mina). Smaller fractions are formed by combining these: e.g. one-fifth is &quot;𒌋𒁹𒁹𒂆&quot; &quot;12×1/60 = 1/5&quot;, and two-fifths are 𒑚𒇹𒂆 &quot;1/3 + (4 × 1/60) = 5/15 + 1/15 = 6/15 = 2/5&quot;.

===Verbal morphology===

==== General ====
The Sumerian finite verb distinguishes a number of moods and agrees (more or less consistently) with the subject and the object in person, number and gender. The verb chain may also incorporate pronominal references to the verb&#x27;s other modifiers, which has also traditionally been described as &quot;agreement&quot;, although, in fact, such a reference &quot;and&quot; the presence of an actual modifier in the clause need not co-occur: not only 𒂍𒂠𒌈𒌈𒅆𒁺𒌦 e2-še3 ib2-ši-du-un&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m going to the house&quot;, but also 𒂍𒂠𒉌𒁺𒌦 e2-še3 i3-du-un&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m going to the house&quot; and simply 𒌈𒅆𒁺𒌦 &quot;ib2-ši-du-un&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m going to it&quot; are possible. Hence, the term &quot;cross-reference&quot; instead of &quot;agreement&quot; has been proposed. This article will predominantly use the term &quot;agreement&quot;.

The Sumerian verb also makes a binary distinction according to a category that some regard as tense (past vs present-future), others as aspect (perfective vs imperfective), and that will be designated as TA (tense/aspect) in the following. The two members of the opposition entail different conjugation patterns and, at least for many verbs, different stems; they are theory-neutrally referred to with the Akkadian grammatical terms for the two respective forms – &quot;ḫamṭu&quot; &quot;quick&quot; and &quot;marû&quot; &quot;slow, fat&quot;. Finally, opinions differ on whether the verb has a passive or a middle voice and how it is expressed.

It is often pointed out that a Sumerian verb does not seem to be strictly limited to only transitive or only intransitive usage: e.g. the verb 𒆭 &quot;kur9&quot; can mean both &quot;enter&quot; and &quot;insert / bring in&quot;, and the verb 𒌣 &quot;de2&quot; can mean both &quot;flow out&quot; and &quot;pour out&quot;. This depends simply on whether an ergative participant causing the event is explicitly mentioned (in the clause and in the agreement markers on the verb). Some have even concluded that instead of speaking about intransitive and transitive &quot;verbs&quot;, it may be better to speak only of intransitive and transitive &quot;constructions&quot; in Sumerian.

The verbal root is almost always a monosyllable and, together with various affixes, forms a so-called verbal chain which is described as a sequence of about 15 slots, though the precise models differ. The finite verb has both prefixes and suffixes, while the non-finite verb may only have suffixes. Broadly, the prefixes have been divided in three groups that occur in the following order: &quot;modal prefixes&quot;, &quot;conjugation prefixes&quot;, and &quot;pronominal and dimensional&quot; prefixes. The suffixes are a future or imperfective marker /-ed-/, pronominal suffixes, and an /-a/ ending that nominalizes the whole verb chain. The overall structure can be summarized as follows:

Examples using most of the above slots may be:

More than one dimensional prefix may occur within the verb chain. If so, the prefixes are placed in a specific order, which is shown the section &quot;Dimensional prefixes&quot; below. The &quot;conjugation prefixes&quot; appear to be mutually exclusive to a great extent, since the &quot;finite&quot; prefixes /i/~/e/- and /a/- do not appear before [mu]-, /ba/- and the sequence -/b/-+-/i/-, nor does the realization [mu] appear before /ba-/ or /b-i/. However, it is commonly assumed that the spellings &quot;im-, im-ma-&quot; and &quot;im-mi-&quot; are equivalent to {i-} + {-mu-}, {i-} + {-mu-} + {-ba-} and {i-} + {-mu-} + {-bi-}, respectively. According to Jagersma, the reason for the restrictions is that the &quot;finite&quot; prefixes /i/~/e/- and /a/- have been elided prehistorically in open syllables, in front of prefixes of the shape CV (consonant-vowel). The exception is the position in front of the locative prefix -/ni/-, the second person dative 𒊏 /-r-a/ and the second person directive 𒊑 /-r-i/, where the dominant dialect of the Old Babylonian period retains them.

==== Modal prefixes ====
The modal prefixes express modality. Some of them are generally combined with certain TAs; in other cases, the meaning of a modal prefix can depend on the TA.
* /Ø-/ is the prefix of the simple indicative mood; in other words, the indicative is unmarked. 
E.g.: 𒅔𒅥 &quot;in-gu7&quot; {Ø-i-n-gu} &quot;He ate it.&quot;
* 𒉡 &quot;nu-&quot; and 𒆷 &quot;la-&quot;, 𒇷 &quot;li-&quot; (𒉌 &quot;li2-&quot; in Ur III spelling) have negative meaning and can be translated as &quot;not&quot;. The allomorphs /la-/ and /li-/ are used before the &quot;conjugation prefixes&quot; 𒁀 &quot;ba-&quot; and 𒉈 &quot;bi2-&quot;, respectively. A following vowel /i/ or /e/ is contracted with the preceding /u/ of &quot;nu-&quot; with compensatory lengthening (which is often graphically unexpressed): compare 𒉌𒁺 &quot;i3-du&quot; &quot;he is walking&quot;, but /nu-i-du/ &gt; /nuː-du/ 𒉡𒅇𒁺 &quot;nu&quot;(-&quot;u3&quot;)&quot;-du&quot; &quot;he isn&#x27;t walking&quot;. If followed by a consonant, on the other hand, the vowel of &quot;nu-&quot; appears to have been assimilated to the vowel of the following syllable, because it occasionally appears written as 𒈾 /na-/ in front of a syllable containing /a/. 
E.g.: 𒉡𒌦𒅥 nu(-&quot;u3&quot;)&quot;-un-gu7&quot; {nu-i-n-gu} &quot;He didn&#x27;t eat it.&quot;
* 𒄩 &quot;ḫa- / 𒃶 ḫe2-&quot; has either precative/optative meaning (&quot;let him do X&quot;, &quot;may you do X&quot;) or affirmative meaning (&quot;he does this indeed&quot;), partly depending on the type of verb. If the verbal form denotes a transitive action, precative meaning is expressed with the &quot;marû&quot; form, and affirmative with the &quot;ḫamṭu&quot; form. In contrast, if the verbal form is intransitive or stative, the TA used is always &quot;ḫamṭu&quot;. Occasionally the precative/optative form is also used in a conditional sense of &quot;if&quot; or &quot;when&quot;. According to Jagersma, the base form is 𒄩 &quot;ḫa-&quot;, but in open syllables the prefix merges with a following conjugation prefix &quot;i3-&quot; into 𒃶 &quot;ḫe2-&quot;. Beginning in the later Old Akkadian period, the spelling also shows assimilation of the vowel of the prefix to 𒃶 &quot;ḫe2-&quot; in front of a syllable containing /e/; in the Ur III period, there is a tendency to generalize the variant 𒃶 &quot;ḫe2-&quot;, but in addition further assimilation to 𒄷 &quot;ḫu-&quot; in front of /u/ is attested and graphic expressions of the latter become common in the Old Babylonian period. Other scholars have contended that &quot;𒃶 ḫe2-&quot; was the only allomorph in the Archaic Sumerian period and many have viewed it as the main form of the morpheme.
E.g.: 𒃶𒅁𒅥𒂊 ḫe2-eb-gu7-e&quot; {ḫa-ib-gu7-e} &quot;let him eat it!&quot;; 𒄩𒀭𒅥 ḫa-an-gu7&quot; &quot;He ate it indeed.&quot;
* 𒂵 &quot;ga-&quot; has cohortative meaning and can be translated as &quot;let me/us do X&quot; or &quot;I will do X&quot;. Occasional phonetic spellings show that its vowel is assimilated to following vowels, producing the allomorphs written 𒄄 &quot;gi4&quot;- and 𒄘 &quot;gu2&quot;-. It is only used with &quot;ḫamṭu&quot; stems, but nevertheless uses personal prefixes to express objects, which is otherwise characteristic of the &quot;marû&quot; conjugation: 𒂵𒉌𒌈𒃻 &quot;ga-ni-ib2&quot;-&quot;g̃ar&quot; &quot;let me put it there!&quot;. The plural number of the subject was not specially marked until the Old Babylonian period, during which the 1st person plural suffix began to be added: 𒂵𒉌𒌈𒃻𒊑𒂗𒉈𒂗 &quot;ga-ni-ib2-g̃ar-re-en-de3-en&quot; &quot;let us put it there!&quot;.
E.g.: 𒂵𒀊𒅥 &quot;ga-ab-gu7&quot; &quot;Let me eat it!&quot;
* 𒅇 &quot;u3-&quot; has prospective meaning (&quot;after/when/if&quot;) and is also used as a mild imperative &quot;Please do X&quot;. It is only used with &quot;ḫamṭu&quot; forms. In open syllables, the vowel of the prefix is assimilated to &quot;i3&quot;- and &quot;a-&quot; in front of syllables containing these vowels. The prefix acquires an additional /l/ when located immediately before the stem, resulting in the allomorph 𒅇𒌌 &quot;u3&quot;-&quot;ul-&quot;.
E.g.: 𒌦𒅥 &quot;un-gu&quot;&quot;7&quot; &quot;If/when he eats it...&quot;
* 𒈾 &quot;na-&quot; has prohibitive / negative optative meaning (&quot;Do not do it!&quot;/&quot;He must not do it!&quot;/&quot;May he not do it!&quot;) or affirmative meaning (&quot;he did it indeed&quot;), depending on the TA of verb: it almost always expresses negative meaning with the &quot;marû&quot; TA and affirmative meaning with the &quot;ḫamṭu&quot; TA. In its negative usage, it can be said to function as the negation of the precative/optative &quot;ḫa-&quot;. In affirmative usage, it has been said to signal an emphatic assertion, but some have also claimed that it expresses reported speech (either &quot;traditional orally transmitted knowledge&quot; or someone else&#x27;s words) or that it introduces following events/states to which it is logically connected (&quot;as X happened (&quot;na-&quot;), so/then/therefore Y happened&quot;). According to Jagersma and others, &quot;negative &quot;na-&quot;&quot; and &quot;affirmative &quot;na-&quot;&quot; are actually two different prefixes, since &quot;negative &quot;na-&quot;&quot; has the allomorph /nan-/ before a single consonant (written 𒈾𒀭 &quot;na-an-&quot; or, in front of the labial consonants /b/ and /m/, &quot;𒉆 nam-&quot;), whereas &quot;affirmative &quot;na-&quot;&quot; does not.
E.g.: 𒈾𒀊𒅥𒂊 na-ab-gu7-e&quot; &quot;He must not eat it!&quot;; 𒈾𒀭𒅥 na-an-gu7&quot; &quot;He ate it indeed.&quot;
* 𒁀𒊏 &quot;ba-ra-&quot; has emphatic negative meaning (&quot;He certainly does/will not do it&quot;) or vetitive meaning (&quot;He should not do it!&quot;), although some consider the latter usage rare or non-existent. It can often function as the negation of cohortative &quot;ga-&quot; and of affirmative &quot;ḫa-&quot;. It is combined with the &quot;marû&quot; TA if the verb denies an action (always present or future), and with the &quot;ḫamṭu&quot; TA if it denies a state (past, present or future) or an action (always in the past). The vetitive meaning requires it to be combined with the &quot;marû&quot; TA, at least if the action is transitive.
E.g.: 𒁀𒊏𒀊𒅥𒂗 ba-ra-ab-gu7-en&quot; &quot;I certainly will not eat it!&quot;; 𒁀𒊏𒀭𒅥 ba-ra-an-gu7&quot; &quot;He certainly didn&#x27;t eat it.&quot;
* 𒉡𒍑 &quot;nu-uš-&quot; is a rare prefix that has been interpreted as having &quot;frustrative&quot; meaning, i.e. as expressing an unrealizable wish (&quot;If only he would do it!&quot;). It occurs both with &quot;ḫamṭu&quot; and with &quot;marû.&quot;
E.g.: 𒉡𒍑𒌈𒅥𒂊 nu&quot;-&quot;uš-&quot;ib2-gu7-e &quot;&quot;If only he would eat it!&quot;
* &quot;𒅆 ši-&quot;, earlier 𒂠 &quot;še3-&quot;, is a rare prefix, with unclear and disputed meaning, which has been variously described as affirmative (&quot;he does it indeed&quot;), contrapunctive (&quot;correspondingly&quot;, &quot;on his part&quot;), as &quot;reconfirming something that already ha(s) been stated or ha(s) occurred&quot;, or as &quot;so&quot;, &quot;therefore&quot;. It occurs both with &quot;ḫamṭu&quot; and with &quot;marû.&quot; In Southern Old Sumerian, the vowel alternated between /e/ before open vowels and /i/ before close ones in accordance with the vowel harmony rule of that dialect; later, it displays assimilation of the vowel in an open syllable, depending on the vowel of the following syllable, to /ša-/ (𒊭 &quot;ša-&quot; / 𒁺 &quot;ša4-&quot;) and (first attested in Old Babylonian) to 𒋗 &quot;šu-&quot;.
E.g.: 𒅆𒅔𒅥 &quot;ši-in-gu7&quot; &quot;So/correspondingly/accordingly(?), he ate it.&quot;

Although the modal prefixes are traditionally grouped together in one slot in the verbal chain, their behaviour suggests a certain difference in status: only &quot;nu-&quot; and &quot;ḫa-&quot; exhibit morphophonemic evidence of co-occurring with a following finite &quot;conjugation prefix&quot;, while the others do not and hence seem to be mutually exclusive with it. For this reason, Jagersma separates the first two as &quot;proclitics&quot; and groups the others together with the finite prefix as (non-proclitic) &quot;preformatives&quot;.

==== &quot;Conjugation prefixes&quot; ====
The meaning, structure, identity and even the number of the various &quot;conjugation prefixes&quot; have always been a subject of disagreements. The term &quot;conjugation prefix&quot; simply alludes to the fact that a Sumerian finite verb in the indicative mood must (nearly) always contain one of them. &quot;Which&quot; of these prefixes is used seems to have, more often than not, no effect on its translation into European languages. Proposed explanations of the choice of conjugation prefix usually revolve around the subtleties of spatial grammar, information structure (focus), verb valency, and, most recently, voice.&quot;&quot; The following description primarily follows the analysis of Jagersma (2010), largely seconded by Zólyomi (2017) and Sallaberger (2023), in its specifics; nonetheless, most of the interpretations in it are held widely, if not universally.

* &quot;𒉌 i3-&quot; (Southern Old Sumerian &quot;variant: 𒂊 e-&quot; in front of open vowels), sometimes described as a finite prefix, appears to have a neutral finite meaning. As mentioned above, it generally does not occur in front of a prefix or prefix sequence of the shape CV except, in Old Babylonian Sumerian, in front of the locative prefix 𒉌 -/ni/-, the second person dative 𒊏 -/r-a/- and the second person directive 𒊑 -/r-i/-.&quot;
E.g.: 𒅔𒁺 &quot;in-ře6&quot; {Ø-i-n-ře} &quot;He brought (it).&quot;
* &quot;𒀀 a-&quot;, with the variant &quot;𒀠 al-&quot; used in front of the stem, the other finite prefix, is rare in most Sumerian texts outside of the imperative form, but when it occurs, it usually has stative meaning. It is common in the Northern Old Sumerian dialect, where it can also have a passive meaning. According to Jagersma, it was used in the South as well during the Old Sumerian period, but only in subordinate clauses, where it regularly characterized not only stative verbs in &quot;ḫamṭu&quot;, but also verbs in &quot;marû&quot;; in the Neo-Sumerian period, only the pre-stem form &quot;al-&quot; was still used and it no longer occurred with &quot;marû&quot; forms. Like &quot;i3-&quot;, the prefix &quot;a-&quot; does not occur in front of a CV sequence except, in Old Babylonian Sumerian, in front of the locative prefix &quot;𒉌&quot; -/ni/-, the second person dative 𒊏 -/r-a/- and the second person directive 𒊑 -/r-i/-&quot;.&quot;
E.g.: 𒀠𒁺 &quot;al-ře6&quot; &quot;It is/was brought.&quot;
* 𒈬 &quot;mu-&quot; is most commonly considered to be a ventive prefix, expressing movement towards the speaker or proximity to the speaker; in particular, it is an obligatory part of the 1st person dative form 𒈠 &quot;ma-&quot; (&quot;mu- + -a-&quot;). However, many of its occurrences appear to express more subtle and abstract nuances or general senses, which different scholars have sought to pinpoint. They have often been derived from &quot;abstract nearness to the speaker&quot; or &quot;involvement of the speaker&quot;. It has been suggested, variously, that &quot;mu-&quot; may be adding nuances of emotional closeness or alignment of the speaker with the agent or other participants of the event, topicality, foregrounding of the event as something essential to the message with a focus on a person, movement or action directed towards an entity with higher social status, prototypical transitivity with its close association with &quot;control, agency, and animacy&quot; as well as focus or emphasis on the role of the agent, telicity as such or that it is attracted by personal dative prefixes in general, as is the Akkadian ventive.
E.g. 𒈬𒌦𒁺 &quot;mu-un-ře6&quot; &quot;He brought it here.&quot; 
* 𒅎 &quot;im-&quot; and &quot;𒀀𒀭am3-&quot; are widely seen as being formally related to &quot;mu-&quot; and as also having ventive meaning; according to Jagersma, they consist of an allomorph of &quot;mu-&quot;, namely -/m/-, and the preceding prefixes &quot;𒉌 i3-&quot; and &quot;𒀀 a-&quot;. In his analysis, these combinations occur in front of a CV sequence, where the vowel &quot;-u-&quot; of &quot;mu-&quot; is lost, whereas the historically preceding finite prefix is preserved: */i-mu-ši-g̃en/ &gt; 𒅎𒅆𒁺 &quot;im-ši-g̃en&quot; &quot;he came for it&quot;. In Zólyomi&#x27;s slightly different analysis, which is supported by Sallaberger, there may also be a -/b/- in the underlying form, which also elicits the allomorph -/m/-: *{i-mu-b-ši-g̃en} &gt; /i-m-b-ši-g̃en/ &gt; /i-m-ši-g̃en/. The vowel of the finite prefix undergoes compensatory lengthening immediately before the stem */i-mu-g̃en/ &gt; 𒉌𒅎𒁺 &quot;i3-im-g̃en&quot; &quot;he came&quot;.
E.g. 𒅎𒁺𒈬 &quot;im-tum3-mu&quot; {i-mu-b-tum-e} &quot;He will bring it here.&quot;
* The vowel of &quot;mu-&quot; is &quot;not&quot; elided in front of the locative prefix &quot;𒉌 -ni-&quot;, the second person dative 𒊏 /-r-a/ and the second person directive 𒊑 /-r-i/. It may, however, be assimilated to the vowel of the following syllable. This produces two allomorphs:
** 𒈪 &quot;mi-&quot; in the sequences 𒈪&quot;𒉌 mi-ni-&quot; and 𒈪𒊑 &quot;mi-ri-&quot;.
E.g. 𒈪𒉌𒅔𒁺 &quot;mi-ni-in-ře6&quot; &quot;He brought it in here.&quot;
** 𒈠 &quot;ma-&quot; in the sequence 𒈠𒊏 &quot;ma-ra-&quot;.
E.g. 𒈠𒊏𒀭𒁺 &quot;ma-ra-an-ře6&quot; &quot;He brought (it) here to you.&quot;
* 𒉈 &quot;bi2-&quot; (Old Sumerian Lagaš spelling: 𒁉 &quot;bi-&quot; or &quot;be2-&quot; in front of open vowels; Old Sumerian Ur spelling: 𒉿 &quot;be6-&quot;) is usually seen as a sequence of the personal prefix -/b/- and the directive prefix -/i/- or -/e/-.
E.g. 𒉈𒅔𒁺 &quot;bi2-in-ře6&quot; &quot;He made it (the ox, the group of workers) bring (it).&quot;
* 𒁀 &quot;ba-&quot; can be analysed as a sequence of the personal prefix /b/- and the dative prefix -/a/-. However, it has been argued that, in spite of this origin, /ba-/ now occupies a slot of its own before the first pronominal prefix and the dimensional prefixes. In accordance with its assumed origin as &quot;b-a-&quot;, it has often been observed that &quot;ba-&quot; appears to have the meaning of a &quot;3rd person inanimate dative&quot;: &quot;for it&quot;, &quot;to it&quot;. However, this explains only some of its occurrences. A number of other apparent meanings and uses of &quot;ba-&quot; have been noted, and most of these are subsumed by Jagersma under the overarching function of a middle voice marker. They include:
*# a reflexive indirect object (to do something &quot;for oneself&quot;);
*# separation and movement &quot;away&quot; from the centre of attention towards a distant goal, especially with motion verbs;
*# a change of state;
*# the passive voice, i.e. occurrence with normally transitive verbs when their agent is not mentioned (the latter not in Northern Sumerian according to Jagersma). Some researchers also view it more generally as expressing focus or emphasis on the patient/goal and relatively low transitivity (and thereby as the polar opposite of &quot;mu-&quot; as they understand it).
E.g. 𒁀𒀭𒁺 ba-an-ře6&quot; &quot;He brought it to it&quot; / &quot;He took it for himself&quot; / &quot;He took it away&quot;; 𒁀𒁺 ba-ře6&quot; &quot;It was brought.&quot; 
* 𒅎𒈪 &quot;im-mi-&quot; (Southern Old Sumerian &quot;𒉌𒈪 i3-mi&quot; or, in front of open vowels, 𒂊𒈨 &quot;e-me-&quot;) and 𒅎𒈠 &quot;im-ma-&quot; (Southern Old Sumerian 𒂊𒈠 &quot;e-ma-&quot;) are generally seen as closely related to one another and &quot;im-mi-&quot; is widely considered to contain the directive prefix &quot;-i~e-&quot;. One common analysis is that &quot;im-mi-&quot; and &quot;im-ma-&quot; represent sequences of &quot;im-&quot; and &quot;bi2-&quot; and &quot;ba-&quot;, respectively, where the consonant /b/ has undergone assimilation to the preceding /m/. Accordingly, their meaning is considered to be simply a combination of the ventive meaning of &quot;im-&quot; and the meanings of &quot;bi2-&quot; and &quot;ba-&quot;, on which see above. This is the analysis espoused by Jagersma and Zólyomi and it is reflected in the schemes and examples in this article. Alternatively, some authors regard &quot;im-ma-&quot; as a prefix in its own right, and it has sometimes been ascribed a middle voice meaning distinct from the more passive nuance of &quot;ba-&quot;.
E.g. 𒅎𒈪𒅔𒁺 im-mi-in-ře6&quot; &quot;He made it (the ox, the group of workers) bring it here&quot;; 𒅎𒈠𒁺 im-ma&quot;-&quot;ře6&quot; &quot;It was brought here.&quot; 
* &quot;𒀀𒀭𒈪 am3-mi-&quot; and &quot;𒀀𒀭𒈠 am3-ma-&quot; are typically analysed along the same lines as &quot;im-mi-&quot; and &quot;im-ma-&quot;, but with a preceding &quot;am-&quot; (from &quot;a-&quot;) instead of &quot;im-&quot; (from &quot;i-&quot;); on the meaning of these see above.

The rare prefix -/nga/- means &#x27;also&#x27;, &#x27;equally&#x27; (often written without the initial /n/, especially in earlier periods). It is of crucial importance for the ordering of the &quot;conjugation prefixes&quot;, because it is usually placed between the conjugation prefix /i/- and the pronominal prefix, e.g. 𒅔𒂵𒀭𒍪 &quot;in-ga-an-zu&quot; &#x27;he, too, knows it&#x27;, but it precedes the conjugation prefix /mu/-: 𒈾𒂵𒈬𒍪 &quot;na-ga-mu-zu&quot; &#x27;he also understood it&#x27;. This suggests that these two conjugation prefixes must belong to different slots.

Although a conjugation prefix is almost always present, Sumerian until the Old Babylonian period allows a finite verb to begin directly with the locative prefix -/ni/-, the second person singular dative -/r-a/-, or the second person directive -/r-i/- (see below), because the prefixes &quot;i3-&quot;/&quot;e-&quot; and &quot;a-&quot; are apparently elided in front of them.

==== Pronominal and dimensional prefixes ====
The &quot;dimensional prefixes&quot; of the verb chain basically correspond to, and often repeat, the case markers of the noun phrase. Like the case markers of the noun phrase, the first dimensional prefix is normally attached to a preceding &quot;head&quot; – a &quot;pronominal prefix&quot;, which expresses the person, gender and number of its referent. The first dimensional prefix may be followed by up to two other dimensional prefixes, but unlike the first one, these prefixes never have an explicit &quot;head&quot; and cannot refer to animate nouns. The other slot where a pronominal prefix can occur is immediately before the stem, where it can have a different allomorph and expresses the person, gender and absolutive or the ergative participant (the transitive subject, the intransitive subject or the direct object), depending on the TA and other factors, as explained below.

There is some variation in the extent to which the verb of a clause that contains a noun in a given case also contains the corresponding pronominal and dimensional prefixes in the verb. The ergative participant is always expressed in the verb, as is, generally, the absolutive one (with some vacillation for the third person singular inanimate in transitive forms, as explained below); the dative, comitative, the locative and directive participant (used in a local meaning) also tend to be expressed relatively consistently; with the ablative and terminative, on the other hand, there is considerable variability. There are some cases, specified below, where the meanings of the cases in the noun phrase and in the verb diverge, so a noun case enclitic may not be reflected in the verb or, conversely, a verb may have a prefix that has no specific reference in the clause or in reality.

===== Pronominal prefixes =====
The forms of the pronominal prefixes are the following:
Confusingly, the subject and object prefixes (/-n-/, /-b-/, /-e-/, /-V-/) are not commonly spelled out in early texts, as both coda consonants and vowel length are often ignored in them. The &quot;full&quot; spellings do become more usual during the Third Dynasty of Ur (in the Neo-Sumerian period) and especially during the Old Babylonian period. Thus, in earlier texts, one finds 𒈬𒀝 &quot;mu-ak&quot; and 𒉌𒀝 &quot;i3-ak&quot; (𒂊𒀝 &quot;e-ak&quot; in Southern Sumerian) instead of 𒈬𒌦𒀝 &quot;mu-un-ak&quot; and 𒅔𒀝 &quot;in-ak&quot; for {mu-n-ak} and {i-n-ak} &quot;he/she made&quot;, and also 𒈬𒀝 &quot;mu-ak&quot; instead of Neo-Sumerian 𒈬(𒅇)𒀝 &quot;mu(&quot;-&quot;u3)-ak&quot; or Old Babylonian 𒈬𒂊𒀝 &quot;mu-e-ak&quot; &quot;you made&quot;. Vowel length never came to be expressed systematically, so the 1st person prefix was often graphically -∅- during the entire existence of Sumerian.

===== Dimensional prefixes =====
The generally recognized dimensional prefixes are shown in the table below; if several occur within the same verb complex, they are placed in the order they are listed in. 
The ablative does not co-occur with the terminative, and the directive does not co-occur with the locative, so these pairs may be argued to share the same slot. Accordingly, the template can be said to include the following dimensional slots: dative - comitative - ablative/terminative - directive/locative.

A major exception from the general system of personal and dimensional prefixes is the very frequent prefix 𒉌 &quot;-ni-&quot; &quot;(in) there&quot;, which corresponds to a noun phrase in the locative, but doesn&#x27;t seem to be preceded by any pronominal prefix and has demonstrative meaning by itself. This prefix is not to be confused with the homographic sequence 𒉌 &quot;-ni-&quot; which corresponds to an animate noun phrase in the directive. In the latter case, &quot;ni&quot; is analysed as a combination of pronominal /-nn-/ and directive /-i-/ (roughly: &quot;at him/her&quot;, &quot;on him/her&quot;, etc.), whereas in the former, &quot;ni&quot; is unanalysable.

An example of a verb chain where several dimensional slots are occupied can be:

The comitative prefix &quot;-da-&quot; can, in addition, express the meaning &quot;to be able to&quot;. In that case, there is a preceding pronominal prefix agreeing with the subject of the action: e.g. {nu-mu-e-da-n-dab-en} &quot;you cannot catch him&quot; (lit. &quot;you won&#x27;t catch him with yourself&quot;). The directive has the meaning &quot;on(to)&quot; when the verb is combined with a noun in the locative case: e.g. {banšur-a ninda b-i-b-g̃a-g̃a-en} &quot;I will put bread on the table&quot;.

===== Differences and combinations between dimensional prefixes and noun case markers=====

While the meanings of the prefixes are generally the same as those of the corresponding nominal case markers, there are some differences:
* The prefixes, unlike noun phrases in the corresponding cases, normally refer only to participants with a strong relationship to the action or state expressed by the verb (e.g. a temporal meaning like &quot;since X&quot; may be expressed by means of a noun phrase with a &quot;-ta&quot; case marker, but that normally wouldn&#x27;t be cross-referenced with a &quot;-ta&quot; prefix on the verb).
* The use of dimensional prefixes is sometimes more closely connected to special meanings of specific verbs and to lexical idiosyncrasies. For instance, the verb 𒇯𒁺 &quot;ed3&quot; has the meaning &quot;go up&quot; with the directive prefix, but &quot;go down&quot; with the ablative one, the verb 𒉚 &quot;sa10&quot; means &quot;sell&quot; with the ablative prefix and &quot;buy&quot; with the terminative, the verb 𒌓𒁺 &quot;ed2&quot; &quot;leave, go out&quot; always has the ablative prefix, and the phrasal verb 𒅗 ... 𒄄 &quot;inim ... gi4&quot; &quot;answer&quot; (lit. &quot;return a word&quot;) always includes the locative. In general, verbs having a place-related meaning such as 𒁄 &quot;bala&quot; &quot;cross&quot;, 𒅅 &quot;g̃al2&quot; &quot;be (somewhere), 𒃻 &quot;g̃ar&quot; &quot;put&quot;, 𒁺 &quot;gub&quot; &quot;stand&quot;, 𒆭 &quot;kur9&quot; &quot;enter&quot;, 𒋛 &quot;sig9&quot; &quot;put&quot; and 𒆪 &quot;tuš&quot; &quot;sit&quot; generally occur with a dimensional prefix specifying a location. Thus, a verb may, albeit rarely, contain a dimensional prefix that simply modifies its meaning and has no reference. In such cases, it has no preceding pronominal prefix, even if it is the first dimensional prefix: e.g. 𒁀𒊏𒀭𒉚 &quot;ba-ra-an-sa10&quot; {ba-ta-n-sa} &quot;he sold it&quot;.
* The directive may be replaced by the dative when its slot is occupied by the locative or when it would have had animate reference, but there is a preceding prefix, which makes any further prefixes with animate reference illicit.
At the systemic level, there are some asymmetries between the nominal case markers and the verbal dimensional prefixes: they partly make different distinctions, and the nominal case marking is influenced by animacy. Because of these mismatches, different meanings are expressed by combinations of matching or non-matching noun cases and verb prefixes. The combinations may be summarized as follows:

In some cases, there are also mismatches between nominal and verbal markers when exact correspondences would have been possible; these may serve to express additional shades of meaning. A dative noun case marker and terminative dimensional prefix may co-occur in the Ur III period. In general, from that time on, the choice of noun cases begins to be influenced by the government of corresponding Akkadian verbs, while the verbs themselves retain their older prefixes. According to Foxvog, /-ni-/ can resume non-locative cases such as the terminative and the dative.

A peculiar pattern of agreement occurs in what has been referred to as an &quot;external possession construction&quot;, in which a modifier of the verb refers to a certain object, almost always a body part, but it is emphasised that the action affects the &quot;possessor&quot; of that object (cf. English &quot;he hit &quot;me&quot; on the head&quot;). In that case, the verb may agree with the possessor with the directive prefix, while not agreeing with the object itself: thus, &quot;he put barley in your hand&quot; may be expressed by {šu-z(u).a še i-r-i-n-g̃ar}, lit. &quot;he put barley at you, in your hand&quot;. Alternatively, it may agree with both the possessor and the object: the possessor is then referred to by the dative prefix: {šu-z(u)-a še (i-)r-a-ni-n-g̃ar}, lit. &quot;he put barley to you, in there, in your hand&quot;.

====== Use of the ventive as a 1st person marker ======
When the dimensional prefix is dative -/a/-, the personal prefix of the 1st person appears to be absent, but the 1st person reference is expressed by the choice of the ventive conjugation prefix /mu/-&quot;.&quot; The sequence that expresses the 1st person dative is then: /mu-/ + /-a-/ → 𒈠 &quot;ma-&quot;. When the intended meaning is that of the directive -/i/~/e/- (&quot;on me&quot;, &quot;in contact with me&quot;, etc.), it seems that the ventive conjugation prefix 𒈬 &quot;mu-&quot; alone serves to express it.

====== Syncope of /i/ in -/ni/- and -/bi/- ======
Two special phenomena occur if there is no absolutive–ergative pronominal prefix in the pre-stem position.

1. The sequences 𒉌 -/ni/- (locative {-ni-} and personal + directive {-nn-i-}) and 𒉈 /bi/- (personal + directive {b-i-}) acquire the forms -/n/- and -/b/- (coinciding with the &quot;absolutive–ergative&quot; pronominal prefixes) before the stem if there isn&#x27;t already an absolutive–ergative pronominal prefix in pre-stem position. This is typically the case when the verb is used intransitively. For example, the normal appearance of &quot;-ni-&quot; is seen in:

* {mu-ni-n-kur} &quot;he brought (it) in&quot; (lit. &#x27;caused (it) to go in)&#x27; &gt; /muninkur/, written 𒈬𒉌𒆭 &quot;mu-ni-kur9&quot; in early texts, later 𒈬𒉌𒅔𒆭 &quot;mu-ni-in-kur9&quot;.

In contrast, in an intransitive form, we find a syncopated realization:

* {mu-ni-kur} &quot;he went in&quot; &gt; /muːnkur/, written 𒈬𒆭 &quot;mu-kur9&quot; in early texts, later 𒈬𒌦𒆭 &quot;mu-un-kur9&quot;.

The preceding vowel undergoes compensatory lengthening, which is sometimes indicated by its doubling in the spelling:

* {i-ni-kur} &gt; &quot;i3-in-kur9&quot; 𒉌𒅔𒆭 &quot;he went in&quot;.

Likewise, the normal realisation of &quot;bi-&quot; is seen in:

* {i-b-i-n-si} &gt; &quot;bi2-in-si&quot; 𒉈𒅔𒋛 &quot;he loaded (it) on it&quot;.

This is to be contrasted with the syncopated version in an intransitive form:

* {i-b-i-si} &gt; &quot;i3-ib2-si&quot; 𒉌𒌈𒋛 &quot;(it) was loaded on it&quot;.

The same phonological pattern is claimed to account for the alternation between the forms of the ventive prefix. The standard appearance is seen in:

{i-mu-n-ak} &gt; &quot;mu-un-ak&quot; 𒈬𒌦𒀝 &quot;he did it here&quot;.

In an intransitive form, however, we find:

{i-mu-g̃en} &gt; &quot;i3-im-g̃en 𒉌𒅎𒁺&quot; &quot;he came here&quot;.

====== Expression of the directive by a pre-stem personal prefix ======
A superficially very similar, but distinct phenomenon is that if there isn&#x27;t already an absolutive–ergative pronominal prefix in pre-stem position, the personal prefix of the directive participant does not receive the dimensional prefix -/i/~/e/- at all and is moved to the pre-stem position. For example, the normal position of the directive participant is seen in:

* {b-i-n-ak} &quot;bi2-in-ak&quot; 𒉈𒅔𒀝 &quot;he applied (it) to it&quot; (said of oil).

In contrast, in an intransitive form, we find:

* {ba-b-ak} &quot;ba-ab-ak&quot; 𒁀𒀊𒀝 &quot;it was applied to it&quot;.

In the same way, the normal position is seen in:

* {b-i-n-us} &quot;bi2-in-us2&quot; 𒉈𒅔𒍑 ≈ &quot;he adjoined (it) to it&quot;.

This can be contrasted with an intransitive form:

* {i-b-us} &quot;ib2-us2&quot; 𒌈𒍑 ≈ &quot;(it) was adjoined to it&quot;.

====== Absence of {-b-} ======
In some cases, the 3rd person inanimate prefix &quot;-b-&quot; appears to be unexpectedly absent.

* &quot;-b-&quot; as the head of a dimensional prefix isn&#x27;t used after the &quot;conjugation prefix&quot; &quot;ba-&quot;: thus *𒁀𒀊𒅆𒌈𒄄𒄄 ba-ab-ši-ib2-gi4-gi4&quot; &quot;he will return it to it (for himself)&quot; is impossible. This restriction does not, however, apply for &quot;-b-&quot; as a subject/object prefix immediately before the stem: thus, 𒁀𒀊𒄄𒄄 ba-ab-gi4-gi4&quot; &quot;he will return it (for himself)&quot; is possible. In some schemes, this is formalized as the placement of the initial pronominal prefix &quot;b-&quot; in the same slot as &quot;ba-&quot; and not in the following slot, where all the other initial pronominal prefixes such as &quot;-n-&quot; are located.
* &quot;-b-&quot; also regularly &quot;fails&quot; to appear after the ventive &quot;conjugation prefix&quot; &quot;mu-&quot;: instead of expected *𒈬𒌒𒅆𒁺 &quot;mu-ub-ši-g̃en&quot;, the meaning &quot;he came for it&quot; is expressed by 𒅎𒅆𒁺 &quot;im-ši-g̃en.&quot; Similarly, instead of *𒈬𒌒𒂷𒂷 &quot;mu-ub-g̃a2-g̃a2&quot; for &quot;he is placing it here&quot;, we find 𒉌𒅎𒂷𒂷 &quot;i3-im-g̃a2-g̃a2&quot;. While some believe that /b/ in this case is truly omitted, others assume that such forms in fact contain an assimilated sequence -/mb/- &gt; -/mm/- &gt; -/m/-, just like the forms &quot;im-mi-&quot; and &quot;im-ma-&quot;, so that the above realisations actually stand for {i-m-b-ši-g̃en} and {i-m-b-g̃a-g̃a}.
* For another case of absence of &quot;-b-&quot;, see the footnote on -&quot;b&quot;- as a marker of the transitive object in the table in the section on &quot;Pronominal agreement in conjugation&quot;.

==== Pronominal suffixes ====
The pronominal suffixes are as follows:

The initial vowel in all of the above suffixes can be assimilated to the vowel of the verb root; more specifically, it can become /u/ or /i/ if the vowel of the verb root is /u/ or /i/, respectively. It can also undergo contraction with an immediately preceding vowel. Pre-Ur III texts also spell the first- and second-person suffix -/en/ as -/e/, making it coincide with the third person in the &quot;marû&quot; form.

==== Pronominal agreement with subjects and direct objects ====
Sumerian verbal agreement follows a nominative–accusative pattern in the 1st and 2nd persons of the &quot;marû&quot; tense-aspect, but an ergative–absolutive pattern in most other forms of the indicative mood. Because of this presence of both patterns, Sumerian is considered a language with split ergativity. The general principle is that in the &quot;ḫamṭu&quot; TA, the transitive subject is expressed by the prefix, and the direct object by the suffix, and in the &quot;marû&quot; TA it is the other way round. For example, {i-b-dab-en} can be a &quot;ḫamṭu&quot; form meaning &quot;it caught me&quot;, where {-b-} expresses the subject &quot;it&quot; and {-en} expresses the object &quot;I&quot;. However, it can also be a &quot;marû&quot; form meaning &quot;I will catch it&quot;, where {-en} expresses the subject &quot;I&quot; and {-b-} expresses the object &quot;it&quot;. As for the intransitive subject, it is expressed, in both TAs, by the suffixes. For example, {i-kaš-en} is &quot;I ran&quot;, and {i-kaš-ed-en} can be &quot;I will run&quot;. This means that the intransitive subject is treated like the object in &quot;ḫamṭu&quot; (which makes the &quot;ḫamṭu&quot; pattern ergative) and like the subject in &quot;marû&quot; (which makes the &quot;marû&quot; pattern nominative-accusative).

There are two exceptions from the above generalization:

1. A transitive subject of the &quot;third&quot; person in &quot;marû&quot; uses unique suffixes that are &quot;not&quot; the same as those of the intransitive subject and the &quot;ḫamṭu&quot; direct object. For example, while &quot;they ran&quot; can be {i-kaš-eš}, just as &quot;it caught them&quot; can be {i-b-dab-eš}, the corresponding form for &quot;they will catch it&quot; would be {i-b-dab-ene}. This pattern can be described as a case of tripartite alignment.

2. A plural transitive subject in the &quot;ḫamṭu&quot; TA is expressed not only by the prefix, but also by the suffix: e.g. {i-n-dab-eš} can mean &quot;they caught (it)&quot;. Specifically, the prefix expresses only the person, while the suffix expresses both the person and the number of the subject.

Note that the prefixes of the plural transitive subject are identical to those of the singular – -/V/-, -/e/-, -/n/- – as opposed to the special plural forms &quot;-me-&quot;, &quot;-e-ne-&quot;, &quot;-ne-&quot; found in non-pre-stem position.

The use of the personal affixes for subjects and direct objects can be summarized as follows:
Examples for TA and pronominal agreement: (&quot;ḫamṭu&quot; is rendered with past tense, &quot;marû&quot; with present):

* {i-gub-en} (𒉌𒁺𒁉𒂗): &quot;I stood&quot; or &quot;I stand&quot;
* {i-n-gub-en} (𒅔𒁺𒁉𒂗): &quot;he placed me&quot; or &quot;I place him&quot;
* {i-sug-enden} (𒉌𒁻𒂗𒉈𒂗): &quot;we stood/stand&quot;
* {i-n-dim-enden} (𒅔𒁶𒂗𒉈𒂗): &quot;he created us&quot; or &quot;we create him&quot;
* {mu-V-dim-enden} (𒈬𒁶𒂗𒉈𒂗): &quot;we created [someone or something]&quot;
* {i-b-gub-e} (𒌈𒁺𒁉) &quot;he places it&quot;
* {i-b-dim-ene} (𒌈𒁶𒈨&quot;𒉈&quot;): &quot;they create it&quot;
* {i-n-dim-eš} (𒅔𒁶𒈨𒌍): &quot;they created [someone or something]&quot; or &quot;he created them&quot;
* {i-sug-eš} (𒉌𒁻𒄀𒌍): &quot;they stood&quot; or &quot;they stand&quot;.

==== Stem ====
The verbal stem itself can also express grammatical distinctions within the categories number and tense-aspect. In a number of verbs, this involves suppletion or morphonological alternations that are not fully predictable.

1. With respect to number, plurality can be expressed by &quot;complete&quot; reduplication of the &quot;ḫamṭu&quot; stem (e.g. 𒆭𒆭 &quot;kur9-kur9&quot; &quot;enter (pl.)&quot; or by a suppletive stem (e.g. 𒁺 &quot;gub&quot; &quot;stand (sing.)&quot; - 𒁻 &quot;sug2&quot; &quot;stand (pl.)&quot;. The traditional view is that both of these morphological means express plurality of the absolutive participant in Sumerian. However, it has often been pointed out that complete reduplication of the verb in Sumerian can also express &quot;plurality of the action itself&quot; intensity or iterativity, and that it is not obligatory in the presence of plural participants, but rather seems to expressly emphasize the plurality. According to some researchers, the predominant meaning of the suppletive plural stem is, indeed, plurality of the most affected participants, whereas the predominant meaning of complete reduplication is plurality of events (because they occur at multiple times or locations). However, even with suppletive plural stems, the singular may occur with a plural participant, presumably because the event is perceived as a single one.

2. With respect to tense-aspect marking, verbs are divided in four types; &quot;ḫamṭu&quot; is always the unmarked TA.

* The stems of the 1st type, regular verbs, are analysed in two ways: some scholars believe that they do not express TA at all, while others claim that they express &quot;marû&quot; TA by adding a suffix -/e/ as in 𒁶𒂊 &quot;dim2-e&quot; vs 𒁶 &quot;dim2&quot; &quot;make&quot;. This -/e/ would, however, nowhere be distinguishable from the first vowel of the pronominal suffixes except for intransitive &quot;marû&quot; 3rd person singular; in that last form, the first analysis attributes the -/e/ to the presence of the -/e(d)/ suffix described below. The glosses in this article assume the first analysis.
* The 2nd type expresses &quot;marû&quot; by &quot;partial&quot; reduplication of the stem, e.g. 𒆭 &quot;kur9&quot; vs 𒆭𒆭 &quot;ku4-ku4&quot; &quot;enter&quot;. Usually, as in this example, this &quot;marû&quot; reduplication follows the pattern C1V1-C1V1 (C1 = 1st consonant of the root, V = 1st vowel of the root). In a few cases, the template is instead C1V1C1C2V1. 
* The 3rd type expresses &quot;marû&quot; by adding a consonant, e.g. &quot;te&quot; vs &quot;teg̃3&quot; &quot;approach&quot; (both written 𒋼). A number of scholars do not recognise the existence of such a class or consider it dubious.
* The 4th type uses a suppletive stem, e.g. 𒅗 &quot;dug4&quot; vs 𒂊 &quot;e&quot; &quot;do, say&quot;. Thus, as many as four different suppletive stems can exist, as in the admittedly extreme case of the verb &quot;to go&quot;: 𒁺 &quot;g̃en&quot; (&quot;to go&quot;, &quot;ḫamṭu&quot; sing.), 𒁺 &quot;du&quot; (&quot;marû&quot; sing.), (𒂊)𒁻 (&quot;e-&quot;)&quot;re7&quot; (&quot;ḫamṭu&quot; plur.), 𒁻 &quot;sub2&quot; (&quot;marû&quot; plur.).
The following tables show some of the most frequent stem alternations.


==== The modal or imperfective suffix -/ed/ ====
Before the pronominal suffixes, a suffix -/ed/ or -/d/ can be inserted (the /d/ is only realized if other vowels follow, in which case the /e/ in turn may be elided): e.g. 𒉌𒀄(𒂊)𒉈𒂗 &quot;i3-zaḫ3(-e)-de3-en&quot; {i-zaḫ-ed-en} &quot;I will/must escape&quot;, 𒉌𒀄𒂊 &quot;i3-zaḫ3-e&quot; {i-zaḫ-ed} &quot;he will/must escape&quot;. This suffix is considered to account for occurrences of &quot;-e&quot; in the third-person singular &quot;marû&quot; of intransitive forms by those who do not accept the theory that &quot;-e&quot; itself is a &quot;marû&quot; stem formant.

The function of the suffix is somewhat controversial. Some view it as having a primarily modal meaning of &quot;must&quot; or &quot;can&quot; or future meaning. Others believe that it primarily signals simply the imperfective status of a verb form, i.e. a &quot;marû&quot; form, although its presence is obligatory only in intransitive &quot;marû&quot; forms and in non-finite forms. In intransitive forms, it thus helps to distinguish &quot;marû&quot; from &quot;ḫamṭu&quot;; for instance, in the above example, 𒉌𒀄𒂗 &quot;i3-zaḫ3-en&quot; alone, without -/ed/-, could have been interpreted as a &quot;ḫamṭu&quot; form &quot;I escaped&quot;. In contrast, in the analysis of scholars who do not believe that -/ed/- is obligatory in &quot;marû&quot;, many intransitive forms like &quot;i3-zaḫ3-en&quot; can be both &quot;ḫamṭu&quot; and &quot;marû&quot;.

The vowel /e/ of this suffix undergoes the same allophonic changes as the initial /e/ of the person suffixes. It is regularly assimilated to /u/ in front of stems containing the vowel /u/ and a following labial consonant, /r/ or /l/, e.g. 𒋧𒈬𒁕 &quot;šum2-mu(-d)&quot; (&lt; {šum-ed}). It is also assimilated and contracted with immediately preceding vowels, e.g. 𒄄 &quot;gi4-gi4&quot; /gi-gi-i(d)/ &lt; {gi-gi-ed} &quot;which will/should return&quot;. The verb 𒁺 &quot;du&quot; &quot;go&quot; never takes the suffix.

==== Use of the tense-aspect forms ====
Jagersma systematizes the use of the tense-aspect forms in the following patterns:
* &quot;ḫamṭu&quot; is used to express completed (perfective) actions in the past, but also states (past &quot;or&quot; present) and timeless truths. It is also used in conditional clauses with the conjunction 𒋗𒃻𒌉𒇲𒁉 &quot;tukumbi&quot; &#x27;if&#x27;.
* &quot;marû&quot; is used to express actions in the present and future, but also non-completed (imperfective) actions in the past (like the English past progressive tense), and, rarely, actions in the past that are still relevant or operative (like the English present perfect tense). It is also used in conditional clauses with the conjunction 𒌓𒁕 &quot;ud-da&quot; &#x27;if&#x27;. Verba dicendi introducing direct speech are also placed in &quot;marû&quot;.

In addition, different moods often require either a &quot;ḫamṭu&quot; or a &quot;marû&quot; stem and either a &quot;ḫamṭu&quot; or a &quot;marû&quot; agreement pattern depending on various conditions, as specified in the relevant sections above and below.

In more general terms, modern scholars usually state that the difference between the two forms is primarily one of aspect: &quot;ḫamṭu&quot; expresses perfective aspect, i.e. a completed action, or sometimes possibly punctual aspect, whereas &quot;marû&quot; expresses imperfective aspect, i.e. a non-completed action, or sometimes possibly durative aspect. In contrast, the &quot;time&quot; at which the action takes place or at which it is completed or non-completed is not specified and may be either past, present or future. This contrasts with the earlier view, prevalent in the first half of the 20th century, according to which the difference was one of tense: &quot;ḫamṭu&quot; was thought to express the past (preterite) tense, and &quot;marû&quot; was considered to express present-future tense, while the use of &quot;marû&quot; with past-tense reference was viewed as a stylistic device (cf. the so-called historical present use in other languages). Indeed it has been pointed out that a translation of &quot;ḫamṭu&quot; with past tense and &quot;marû&quot; with present or future tense does work well most of the time; this may correspond to the cases in which the action was viewed by Sumerian speakers as completed or non-completed &quot;with respect to the present moment&quot;.

==== The imperative mood ====
The imperative mood construction is produced with a &quot;ḫamṭu&quot; stem, but using the &quot;marû&quot; agreement pattern, by turning all prefixes into suffixes. In the plural, the second person plural ending is attached in a form that differs slightly from the indicative: it is /-(n)zen/, with the -/n/- appearing only after vowels. The stem is singular even in the plural imperative. Compare the following indicative-imperative pairs: 

This may be compared with the French pair &quot;vous le lui donnez&quot;, but &quot;donnez-le-lui!&quot;

In addition, the prefix 𒉌 &quot;i3-&quot; is replaced by /-a/: 𒉌𒁺 i3-g̃en&quot; &quot;he went&quot;, but 𒁺𒈾 &quot;g̃en-na &quot;go!&quot;, 𒅔𒈾𒀊𒁉 &quot;in-na-ab-be2&quot; &quot;he will say it to him&quot;, but 𒅗𒂵𒀭𒈾(𒀊) &quot;dug4-ga-an-na(-ab)&quot; &#x27;say it to him!&#x27;. However, the vowel /e/ and possibly /i/ occasionally also occur if no further prefixes follow, perhaps as a characteristic of southern dialects. The ventive prefix &quot;mu-&quot;, if not followed by others, has the form 𒌝 &quot;-um&quot; in the imperative: 𒁺𒌝 &quot;ře6-um&quot; &#x27;bring it here!&#x27; In Old Babylonian texts, the reduced form -/u/ and the more regular -/am/ {-a-m} are also found: 𒂷𒉡 &quot;g̃e26-nu&quot;, 𒁺𒀀𒀭 &quot;g̃en-am3&quot;, both &quot;come here!&quot;

==== Participles ====
Sumerian participles can function both as verbal adjectives and as verbal nouns. As verbal adjectives, they can describe any participant involved in the action or state expressed by the verb: for instance, 𒋧𒈠 &quot;šum2-ma&quot; may mean either &quot;(which was) given (to someone)&quot;, &quot;who was given (something)&quot; or &quot;who gave&quot;. As verbal nouns, they denote the action or state itself, so 𒋧𒈠 &quot;šum2-ma&quot; may also mean &#x27;(the act of) giving&#x27; or &#x27;the fact that X gave Y&#x27;. Participles are formed in the following ways:

* The bare &quot;ḫamṭu&quot; stem can function as a participle. It usually expresses timeless truths: 𒋧 &quot;šum2&quot; may be a person who regularly/constantly gives, something regularly given, or the regular act of giving.
* Another way to form participles is by means of adding the nominalizing marker -/a/ to the &quot;ḫamṭu&quot; stem: 𒋧𒈠 &quot;šum2-ma&quot; &quot;given&quot;. The verb form constructed in this way characterizes an entity with a specific action or state in the past or a state in the present (𒋾𒆷 &quot;til3-la&quot; &quot;alive&quot;). The verbs 𒌇 &quot;tuku&quot; &quot;have&quot; and 𒍪 &quot;zu&quot; &quot;know&quot; usually omit the ending -/a/, as does the verb 𒀝 &quot;ak&quot; &quot;do&quot;. According to Jagersma, the nominalizing marker had the effect of geminating the preceding consonant (e.g. /šumːa/), which is evident from Akkadian loanwords, and this effect was due to its original form being /ʔa/ with a glottal stop that later assimilated to preceding consonants (/šumʔa/ &gt; šumːa).
* The &quot;marû&quot; stem can be combined with the suffix -/ed/ to form another participle, which often has a future and modal meaning similar to the Latin gerundive, e.g. 𒁶𒈨 &quot;dim2-me(-d)&quot; &quot;which will/should be made&quot;. Adding a locative-terminative marker /-e/ after the /-ed/ yields a form with a meaning similar to the Latin &quot;ad&quot; + gerund (acc.) construction: 𒁶(𒈨)𒉈 &quot;dim2(-me)-de3&quot; = &quot;(in order) to make&quot;. A similar meaning can be expressed by adding the locative marker: 𒁶(𒈨)𒁕 &quot;dim2(-me)-da&quot; = &quot;(for it) to be made&quot;. The main difference is that in the construction with &quot;-&quot;(&quot;ed&quot;)-&quot;e&quot;, the subject of the intended action is the same as the subject of the main clause, while it is different in the construction with &quot;-&quot;(&quot;ed&quot;)-&quot;a&quot;. The analysis of this participle is controversial along the same lines as that of the meaning of the suffix &quot;-ed&quot; in finite forms (see above). Some Sumerologists describe its meaning as primarily modal and distinguish it from a separate imperfective participle that consists of the &quot;marû&quot; stem alone, e.g. 𒁶𒈨 &quot;dim2-me&quot; &#x27;which is/was making&#x27;, 𒄄𒄄 &quot;gi4-gi4&quot; &quot;returning&quot;. Others believe that it this is also the normal &quot;marû&quot; participle and that it has, in addition, the imperfective meanings &quot;which is/was cutting&quot; and &quot;which is/was being cut&quot;. Besides the allomorphy of the suffix -/ed/ already treated above, the verb 𒅗 &quot;dug4&quot; &quot;do, say&quot; has a suppletive participial stem in this form: 𒁲 &quot;di(-d)&quot;.
* The &quot;marû&quot; stem can also occur with the suffix -/a/. Nonetheless, according to Jagersma, this form is rare outside the combination with a following possessive pronominal marker to express temporal meaning, as explained in the &quot;Syntax&quot; section: e.g. 𒁶(𒈨)𒁕𒉌 &quot;dim2(-me)-da-ni&quot; &quot;when he makes (something)&quot;.

==== Copula verb ====
The copula verb /me/ &quot;to be&quot; is mostly used in an enclitic form. Its conjugation is as follows: 

In addition, the initial vowel of the form &quot;-am3&quot; is reduced to -/m/ after enclitics ending in a vowel: 𒂍𒈬𒌝 &quot;e2&quot;-&quot;g̃u10&quot;-&quot;um&quot; &quot;it is my house&quot;. Like other final consonants, the &quot;-m&quot; may not be expressed in early spelling.

These enclitic forms are used instead of a simple sequence of finite prefix, root and personal suffix &quot;*i3-me-en&quot;, &quot;*i-me&quot; etc. For more complex forms, the independent copula form is used: 𒉌𒈨𒀀 &quot;i3-me-a&quot; &quot;that he is&quot;, 𒉡𒅇𒈨𒂗 &quot;nu-u3-me-en&quot; &quot;I am not&quot;. Unlike the enclitic, it typically uses the normal stem 𒈨 -&quot;me&quot;- in the 3rd person singular (𒁀𒊏𒈨 &quot;ba-ra-me&quot; &quot;should not be&quot;), except for the form prefixed with &quot;ḫa-&quot;, which is 𒃶𒅎 &quot;ḫe2-em&quot; or 𒃶𒀀𒀭 &quot;ḫe2-am3&quot;.

For a negative equivalent of the copula in the 3rd person, it seems that the word 𒉡 &quot;nu&quot; &quot;not&quot; alone instead of &quot;*nu-um&quot; is used predicatively (e.g. 𒍏𒉡 &quot;urud nu&quot; &quot;it is not copper&quot;) although the form 𒉡(𒌦)𒂵𒀀𒀭 &quot;nu-(un)-ga-am3&quot; &quot;it is also not ...&quot; is attested. A different word is used to express existence or being present/located somewhere: &quot;𒅅 g̃al2&quot;.

A peculiar feature of the copula is that it seems to form a relative clause without the nominalizing suffix /-a/ and thus uses the finite form: thus, instead of 𒉌𒈨𒀀 &quot;i3-me-a&quot;, simply 𒀀𒀭 -&quot;am3&quot; is used: 𒆬𒃻𒂵𒊏𒉌𒅎𒈠𒀭𒋧 &quot;kug nig̃2-gur11-ra-ni-im ma-an-šum2&quot; &quot;he gave me silver (which) was his property&quot;, which appears to say &quot;The silver was his property, he gave it to me&quot;. In the negative, the full form 𒉡𒈨𒀀 &quot;nu-me-a&quot; &quot;which is not&quot; is used, and likewise in non-relative functions.

==== Passive voice ====
Some scholars believe that it is possible to speak of a passive voice in Sumerian. Jagersma (2010) distinguishes three attested passive constructions. In each case, the ergative participant and the corresponding agreement marker on the verb are removed, so that the verb is inflected intransitively, but there may also be some additional cues to ensure a passive interpretation. The passive may be formed:

# By simply eliminating the agent of a transitive verb and the corresponding agreement marker: {engar-e e i-n-řu} &quot;the farmer built the house&quot; &gt; † {e i-řu} &quot;the house was built&quot;. As a dynamic passive, in reference to the event itself, this construction is obsolete in &quot;ḫamṭu&quot; by the time of the earliest records according to Jagersma&quot;.&quot; However, it is still used with modal prefixes and in &quot;marû&quot;: e.g. {e ḫa-i-řu} &quot;May the house be built!&quot; Moreover, it continues to be used as a stative passive in Southern Sumerian, so {e i-řu} can mean &quot;the house is built (i.e. complete)&quot;.
# With the prefix 𒁀 &quot;ba-&quot;, e.g. {e ba-řu}. This is only found in Southern Sumerian and expresses only a dynamic passive, i.e. it refers to the event itself: &quot;The house was (came to be) built&quot;.
# With the prefix {a-}, e.g. {e al-řu}. This is only found in Northern Sumerian and can have both a stative and a dynamic sense: &quot;The house is built (complete)&quot; or &quot;The house was (came to be) built&quot;.
The agent is never expressed in the passive clause in Sumerian.

While the existence of such intransitive constructions of normally transitive verbs is widely recognized, some other scholars have disputed the view that these constructions should be called &quot;passives&quot;. They prefer to speak of one-participant or agentless constructions and to limit themselves to the observation that the prefixes &quot;ba-&quot; and &quot;a-&quot; tend to be preferred with such constructions, apparently as a secondary effect of another, more subtle feature of their meaning. Concerning the history of the constructions, it has been claimed that the passive(-like) use of &quot;ba-&quot; does not appear before the Ur III period; Jagersma, on the contrary, states that it is attested already in the Old Sumerian period, although it becomes especially frequent in Ur III times.

A different construction has been posited and labelled &quot;Sumerian passive voice&quot; by a significant number of scholars. According to them, too, a passive is formed by removing the ergative participant and the verbal marker that agrees with it, but the verb is &quot;not&quot; inflected as an intransitive one: instead, it has a personal prefix, which refers to the &quot;logical object&quot;: {e i-b-řu} or {e ba-b-řu} &quot;the house is being built&quot;. The stem is always &quot;ḫamṭu&quot;. Some consider this construction to have only the function and meaning of a &quot;marû&quot; form&quot;&quot;, while others consider the tense-aspect opposition to be neutralized in it. The personal prefix is nearly always -&quot;b&quot;- in identified cases; views differ on whether it agrees in gender with an animate logical object, appearing as &quot;-n-&quot;, or whether it remains &quot;-b-&quot;. Critics have argued that most alleged examples of the construction are actually instances of the pre-stem personal prefix referring to the directive participant in an intransitive verb, at least before the Old Babylonian period. Pascal Attinger considers it plausible that the original construction was indeed a directive one, whereas its new passive function as described by him arose via a reinterpretation in the Old Babylonian period; Walther Sallaberger, on the contrary, believes this kind of passive to be characteristic of Neo-Sumerian and to have been lost in Old Babylonian. A further possibility is that at least some of these cases actually have an impersonal 3rd person inanimate subject: &quot;&#x27;it&#x27; has / they have built the house&quot;.

==== Causative construction ====
Sumerian doesn&#x27;t have dedicated causative morphology. Causativity is expressed syntactically in two ways, depending on the transitivity of the verb.

# An intransitive verb is made transitive and thus acquires causative meaning merely by adding an ergative participant and the appropriate agreement marker: {gud i-gub} &quot;the ox stood&quot; - {engar-e gud i-n-gub} &quot;the farmer made the ox stand&quot;. 
# A transitive verb is made causative by placing the ergative participant in the directive: {engar-e gud-e u b-i-n-gu} &quot;the farmer made the ox eat grass&quot;. For animates, as usual, the directive case marker is replaced by the dative one: {engar-e dumu-ra ninda i-nn-i-n-gu} &quot;the farmer made the child eat bread&quot;. A further example can be {dig̃ir-e engar-ra gud i-nn-i-n-gub}: &quot;the god made the farmer make the ox stand&quot;.
# The causative constructions can in turn be passivized using the prefix &quot;ba-&quot;: {gud ba-gub} &quot;the ox was caused to stand&quot;, {gud-e u ba-b-gu} &quot;the ox was caused to eat grass&quot; (lit. &quot;grass was caused to be eaten by the ox&quot;), {dumu-ra ninda ba-n-gu} &quot;the child was caused to eat bread&quot;.
In Old Babylonian Sumerian, new causative markers have been claimed to have arisen under the influence of Akkadian; this is explained in the section on Interference from Akkadian and other late phenomena.

==== Phrasal verbs ====
A specific problem of Sumerian syntax is posed by the numerous phrasal verbs (traditionally called &quot;compound verbs&quot; in Sumerology in spite of the fact that they are not compounds, but idiomatic combinations). They usually involve a noun immediately before the verb, forming a lexical/idiomatic unit: e.g. 𒅆...𒂃 &quot;igi ...du8&quot;, lit. &quot;open the eye&quot; = &quot;see, look&quot;. Their case government and agreement patterns vary depending on the specific verb. The component noun is usually in the absolutive case, but may be in the directive. If the phrasal verb takes another noun as a &quot;logical object&quot;, the verbal infix is typically the directive, while the noun case is most commonly either the directive (dative if animate), which otherwise has the meaning &quot;at / with respect to&quot;, or the locative (dative if animate), which otherwise has the meaning &quot;on&quot;:

* Directive: 
** 𒅆...𒂃 &quot;igi ...du8&quot; ({NOUN-e igi ...-e~i-...du}), lit. &quot;open the eye at something&quot; &gt; &quot;see&quot;
** 𒆥...𒀝 &quot;kig̃2 ...ak&quot;, lit. &quot;do work with respect to something&quot; &gt; &quot;work (on) something&quot;
** &quot;𒋗𒋳...𒅗 šu-tag ...dug4&quot;, lit. &quot;do hand-touching with respect to something&quot; &gt; &quot;decorate&quot;
** 𒊓...𒅗 &quot;sa2 dug4&quot;, lit. &quot;do equal with respect to something&quot; &gt; &quot;reach&quot;
** 𒄑...&quot;𒋳 g̃eš ...tag&quot;, lit. &quot;make wood touch &#x27;at&#x27; something&quot; &gt; &quot;sacrifice something&quot;.
** 𒋛...𒁲 &quot;si ...sa2&quot; ({NOUN-e si ...-e~i-...sa}), lit. &quot;make the horns(?) equal with respect to something&quot; &gt; &quot;put something in order&quot;; likewise used intransitively: {NOUN-e si b-i-sa}, lit. &quot;the horns (?) are equal with respect to something&quot; &gt; &quot;something is in order&quot;.
* Locative &quot;on&quot;: 
** 𒅗...𒃻 &quot;inim&quot; ...&quot;g̃ar&quot; ({NOUN-a inim ...-e~i-...g̃ar}), lit. &quot;place a word on something&quot; &gt; &quot;claim, place a claim on&quot;
** 𒋗...𒁇 &quot;šu ...bar&quot;, lit. &quot;open / remove the hand on something&quot; &gt; &quot;release&quot;
** &quot;𒈬...𒄷𒈿 mu ...sa4&quot;, lit. &quot;call a name on someone&quot; &gt; &quot;to name&quot;
** &quot;𒉆...𒋻 nam ...tar&quot;, lit. &quot;cut a fate upon someone&quot; &gt; &quot;determine the fate of someone&quot;
** &quot;𒀠...𒆕 al ...řu2&quot;, lit. &quot;raise the hoe upon something&quot; &gt; &quot;dig&quot;
** 𒇷...&quot;𒋻 en3 ...tar&quot;, lit. &quot;cut a question(?) on something&quot; &gt; &quot;investigate&quot;

Less commonly, the case of the logical object and the pronominal infix may be:

* Dative (directive if inanimate): 
** 𒆠...𒉘 &quot;ki&quot; ...&quot;ag̃2&quot; ({NOUN-ra ki ...ag̃}) lit. &quot;to measure out a place for someone&quot; = &quot;to love someone&quot;
** &quot;𒅗 ...𒌣 gu3 ...de2&quot;, lit. &quot;to pour out the voice for someone&quot; = &quot;to call for someone&quot;
** &quot;𒀀 ...𒊒 a ...ru&quot;, lit. &quot;to eject water for someone&quot; = &quot;to dedicate something to someone&quot;
* Terminative: 𒅆 ...𒁇 &quot;igi ...bar&quot; (NOUN-še igi ...bar) lit. &quot;bring out the eye towards something&quot; = &quot;see, look&quot;
* Comitative: 𒀉 ...𒉘 &quot;a2&quot; ...&quot;ag̃2&quot; ({NOUN-da a ...ag̃}) lit. &quot;measure out power (?) with someone&quot; = &quot;to give orders to someone&quot;
* Locative &quot;in&quot;:
** 𒋗... 𒁍 &quot;šu ...gid2&quot; ({NOUN-a šu ... gid}), lit. &quot;stretch out the hand into something&quot; = &quot;to perform extispicy on&quot;
** 𒋗... 𒁄 &quot;šu&quot; ...&quot;bala&quot;, lit. &quot;let one&#x27;s hand go across in something&quot; = &quot;alter&quot;

Another possibility is for the component noun to be in the dative (directive if inanimate), while the object is in the absolutive:

* 𒋗...𒋾 &quot;šu ...ti&quot; ({šu-e NOUN &quot;...&quot;ti}) lit. &quot;make something come close to the hand&quot; = &quot;to receive something&quot; (&quot;&quot;from&quot; someone&quot; is expressed by the terminative: {NOUN&quot;2&quot;-še šu-e NOUN&quot;1 ...&quot;ti})

=== Syntax ===

==== General features ====
The basic word order is subject–object–verb; verb finality is only violated in rare instances, in poetry. The moving of a constituent towards the beginning of the phrase may be a way to highlight it, as may the addition of the copula to it. Modifiers (adjectives, genitive phrases etc.) are normally placed after the noun: 𒂍𒉋 &quot;e2 gibil&quot; &quot;a new house&quot; 𒂍𒈗𒆷 &quot;e2 lugal-la&quot; &quot;the house of the owner&quot;. However, the so-called anticipatory genitive (𒂍𒀀𒈗𒉈 &quot;e2-a lugal-bi&quot; &quot;the owner of the house&quot;, lit. &quot;of the house, its owner&quot;) is common and may signal the possessor&#x27;s topicality. There are no adpositions, but noun phrases in a certain case may resemble prepositions and have a similar function:

* 𒊮...𒀀𒅗 &quot;šag4 X-a-ka&quot;, lit. &quot;in the heart of X&quot; = &quot;inside/among X&quot;.
* 𒅆 ... 𒀀𒂠 &quot;igi X-a-še3&quot;, lit. &quot;for the eyes of X&quot; = &quot;in front of X&quot;.
* 𒂕...𒀀𒅗 &quot;egir X-a-ka&quot;, lit. &quot;at the back of X&quot; = &quot;behind/after X&quot;.
* 𒀀𒅗...𒀀𒅗 X &quot;ugu2 X-a-ka&quot;, lit. &quot;on the skull of X&quot; = &quot;on top of X&quot;, &quot;concerning X&quot;
* 𒁇...𒀀𒅗 &quot;bar X-a-ka&quot;, lit. &quot;outside of X&quot; = &quot;because of X&quot; (in Old Sumerian).
* 𒈬/𒉆 ... 𒀀𒂠 &quot;mu&quot;/&quot;nam X-a-še3&quot;, lit. &quot;for the name/fate of X&quot; = &quot;because of X&quot; (in Neo-Sumerian).

==== Subordinate clauses ====
There are various ways to express subordination. Many of them include the nominalization of a finite verb with the suffix -/a/, which is also used to form participles, as shown above. Like the participles, this nominalized clause can either modify a noun, as adjectives do, or refer to the event itself, as nouns do. It usually functions as a relative clause, corresponding to an English clause with &quot;which ...&quot; or &quot;who ...&quot;, as in the following example:

Like the participles, the relative clauses can describe any participant involved in the action or state expressed by the verb, and the specific participant is determined by context: e.g. 𒈬𒌦𒈾𒀭𒋧𒈠 {mu-nna-n-šum-a} can be &quot;which he gave to him&quot;, &quot;who gave (something) to him&quot;, etc. The nominalized clause can also be a complement clause, corresponding to an English clause with &quot;that ...&quot;, e.g. &quot;e2 in-řu2-a&quot; (&quot;in-zu&quot;) &quot;(he knows) that he built the house&quot;. Like a noun, it can be followed by case morphemes:

* In the locative case (with added 𒀀 &quot;-a&quot;), it means &quot;when&quot;: &quot;e2 in-řu2-a-a&quot; &quot;when he built the house&quot; (more literally &quot;&quot;in&quot; his building of the house&quot;), although this is more common in Old Sumerian. 
* In the ablative case (with added 𒋫 &quot;-ta&quot;), it means &quot;after&quot; or &quot;since&quot;: &quot;e2 in-řu2-a-ta&quot; &quot;after he built the house&quot;; the particle 𒊑 &quot;-ri&quot; may express the same meaning as 𒋫 &quot;-ta&quot;. 
* In the terminative case (with added 𒂠 -&quot;še3&quot;), it has a meaning close to &quot;before&quot; or &quot;as to the fact that&quot;: &quot;e2 nu-řu2-a-še3&quot; &quot;while he had not yet built the house&quot;.
* In the equative case (with added 𒁶 -&quot;gen7&quot;), it can mean &quot;as (if)&quot;, &quot;as (when)&quot;, &quot;when&quot; or &quot;because&quot;: &quot;e2 in-řu2-a-gen7&quot; &quot;as he built the house&quot;. 
* It can also host the enclitics -/akanam/ and -/akeš/ &quot;because&quot;: &quot;e2 in-řu2-a-ka-nam&quot; &quot;because he built the house&quot;.
* More surprisingly, it can add both the genitive and the locative morpheme with a meaning close to &quot;when&quot;, possibly &quot;as soon as&quot;: (&quot;e2 in-řu2-a&quot;-(a-)ka) &quot;as soon as he built the house&quot;.

The nominalized clause can directly modify a noun expressing time such as 𒌓 &quot;ud&quot; &quot;day, time&quot;, 𒈬 &quot;mu&quot; &quot;year&quot; and 𒌗 &quot;itid&quot; &quot;month&quot;, and this in turn can then stand in the locative and ablative in the same meanings as the clauses themselves: &quot;ud e2 in-řu2-a-a/ta&quot; &quot;when/after he built the house&quot;. In this case, the particle &quot;-bi&quot; sometimes precedes the case morpheme: &quot;ud e2 in-řu2-a-ba&quot;; the basic meaning is still of &quot;when&quot;.

The nominalized clause can also be included in the various &quot;prepositional constructions&quot; mentioned above:

* bar e2 in-řu2-a-ka &quot;because he built the house&quot; (in Old Sumerian)
* mu X-a-še3 &quot;because he built the house&quot; (in Neo-Sumerian), 
* egir e2 in-řu2-a-ka &quot;after he built the house&quot;.

The structure is shown more clearly in the following example:

Several clauses can be nominalized by a single {-a} enclitic: {kaʾa ba-zaḫ engar-e nu-i-b-dab-a b-i-n-dug} &quot;he said that the fox had escaped and the farmer had not caught it&quot;.

Participles can function in a very similar way to the nominalized clauses and be combined with the same kinds of adjuncts. One peculiarity is that, unlike nominalized clauses, they may also express the agent as a possessor, in the genitive case: 𒂍𒆕𒀀𒈗𒆷 &quot;e2 řu2-a lugal-la&quot; &quot;the house built by the king&quot;. However, when the head noun (&quot;e2&quot;) is specified as here, a more common construction uses the ergative: 𒂍𒈗𒂊𒆕𒀀 &quot;e2 lugal-e řu2-a.&quot;

A special subordinating construction with the temporal meaning of an English &quot;when&quot;-clause is the so-called &quot;pronominal conjugation&quot;, which contains a verb nominalized with -/a/ and following possessive pronominal markers referring to the subject (transitive or intransitive). In the 3rd person, the form appears to end in the possessive pronominal marker alone: 𒆭𒊏𒉌 &quot;kur9-ra-ni &quot;when he entered&quot;, lit. &quot;his entering&quot;, etc. It has been suggested that these forms actually also contain a final directive marker &quot;-e&quot;; in this example, the analysis would be {kur-a-ni-e}, &quot;at his entering&quot;. Similarly, in Old Babylonian Sumerian, one sometimes finds the locative or ablative markers after the possessive (&quot;kur9-ra-na, kur9-ra-ni-ta). In contrast, in the 1st and 2nd persons, the 1st and 2nd person pronouns are followed by the syllable 𒉈 &quot;-ne&quot;: 𒍣𒂵𒈬𒉈 &quot;zig3-ga-g̃u10-ne&quot; &quot;as I rose&quot;). The verb itself may be in &quot;ḫamṭu&quot;, as in the above examples, or in &quot;marû&quot; followed by the modal/imperfective suffix -/ed/-: 𒍣𒍣𒁕𒈬𒉈 &quot;zi-zi-da&quot;-&quot;g̃u10-ne&quot; &quot;when I rise&quot;. The same construction is used with the word 𒀸 &quot;dili&quot; &quot;alone&quot;: 𒀸𒈬𒉈 &quot;dili-g̃u10-ne&quot; &quot;I alone&quot;, etc.

Subordinating conjunctions such as 𒌓𒁕 &quot;ud-da&quot; &quot;when, if&quot;, 𒋗𒃻𒌉𒇲𒁉 &quot;tukum-bi&quot; &quot;if&quot; and 𒂗𒈾 &quot;en-na&quot; &quot;until&quot; also exist.

==== Coordination ====
Coordinating conjunctions are rarely used. The most common way to express the sense of &quot;and&quot; is by simple juxtaposition. Nominal phrases may be conjoined, perhaps emphatically, by adding 𒁉 -&quot;bi&quot; to the second one: 𒀭𒂗𒆤𒀭𒎏𒆤𒉌 &quot;en-lil2 nin-lil2-bi&quot; &quot;both Enlil and Ninlil&quot;; sometimes the enclitic is further reinforced by 𒁕 &quot;-da&quot; &quot;with&quot;. More surprisingly, 𒋫 &quot;-ta&quot; &quot;from&quot; is also sometimes used in the sense of &quot;and&quot;. The word 𒅇 &quot;u3&quot; &quot;and&quot; was borrowed from Akkadian in the Old Akkadian period and occurs mostly in relatively colloquial texts; Old Babylonian Sumerian also borrowed from Akkadian the enclitic 𒈠 &quot;-ma&quot; &quot;and&quot;. There is no conjunction &quot;or&quot; and its sense can also be expressed by simple juxtaposition; a more explicit and emphatic alternative is the repetition of 𒃶𒅎 &quot;ḫe2-em&quot;, &quot;let it be&quot;: 𒇻𒃶𒅎𒈧𒃶𒅎 &quot;udu ḫe2-em maš ḫe2-em&quot; &quot;(be it) a sheep or a goat&quot;&quot;.&quot;

==== Other issues ====
A quotative particle -/(e)še/ or -/ši/ &quot;saying&quot;, variously spelt 𒂠 -&quot;eše2&quot;, 𒅆 -&quot;ši&quot; or 𒀪𒊺 -&quot;e-še&quot;, has been identified. Its use is not obligatory and it is attested only or almost only in texts from the Old Babylonian period or later. Another, rarely attested, particle, 𒄑(𒊺)𒂗 -&quot;g̃eš(-še)-en&quot;, apparently expresses irrealis modality: &quot;were it that ...&quot;.

Highlighting uses of the copula somewhat similar to English cleft constructions are present: 𒈗𒀀𒀭𒉌𒁺 &quot;lugal-am3 i3-g̃en&quot; &quot;It is the king who came&quot;, 𒀀𒈾𒀸𒀀𒀭𒉌𒁺 &quot;a-na-aš&quot;-&quot;am3 i3-g̃en&quot; &quot;Why is it that he came?&quot;, 𒉌𒁺𒈾𒀀𒀭 &quot;i3-g̃en&quot; &quot;It is the case that he came&quot;.

Sumerian generally links a nominal predicate to the subject using the copula verb, like English. However, it does use zero-copula constructions in some contexts. In interrogative sentences, the 3rd person copula is omitted: 𒀀𒈾𒈬𒍪 &quot;a-na mu-zu&quot; &quot;What is your name?&quot;, 𒉈𒂗𒈬𒍪 &quot;ne-en mu-zu&quot; &quot;Is this your name?&quot;. Sumerian proper names that consist of entire sentences normally lack a copula as well, e.g. 𒀀𒁀𒀭𒌓𒁶 &quot;a-ba dutu-gen7&quot; &quot;Who is like Utu?&quot; As explained above, negative sentences also omit the copula in *&quot;nu-am3&quot;/&quot;nu-um &quot;&quot;isn&#x27;t&quot; and use simply 𒉡 &quot;nu&quot; instead.

&quot;Yes/no&quot;-interrogative sentences appear to have been marked only by intonation and possibly by resulting lengthening of final vowels. There is no wh-movement to the beginning of the clause, but the interrogative words are placed immediately before the verb: e.g. 𒈗𒂊𒀀𒈾𒈬𒌦𒀝 &quot;lugal-e a-na mu-un-ak&quot; &quot;What did the king do?&quot;, 𒂍𒀀𒁀𒀀𒅔𒆕 &quot;e2 a-ba-a in-řu3&quot; &quot;Who built the temple?&quot; Two exceptions from this are that the constituent noun of a phrasal verb is normally closer to the verb, and that an interrogative word emphasized with a copula such as 𒀀𒈾𒀸𒀀𒀭 &quot;a-na-aš-am3&quot; &quot;why is it that ...?&quot; is placed at the beginning of the clause. In addition, as already mentioned, interrogative sentences omit the copula where a declarative would have used it.

=== Word formation ===
Derivation by affixation is largely non-existent. An exception may be a few nouns ending in -/u/ denoting the object of a corresponding verb: 𒊬𒊒 &quot;sar-ru&quot; &quot;document&quot; &lt; 𒊬 &quot;sar&quot; &quot;write&quot;. Compounding, on the other hand, is common in nouns. Compounds are normally left-headed. The dependent may be:

* Another noun: 𒂍 &quot;e2&quot; &quot;house&quot; + 𒈬 &quot;muḫaldim&quot; &quot;cook&quot; &gt; 𒂍𒈬 &quot;e2&quot;-&quot;muḫaldim&quot; &quot;kitchen&quot;
* An adjective: 𒌨 &quot;ur&quot; &quot;dog&quot; + 𒈤&quot;maḫ&quot; &quot;great&quot; &gt; 𒌨𒈤 &quot;ur-maḫ&quot; &quot;lion&quot;
* A participle (consisting of the bare verb stem): 𒃻 &quot;nig̃2&quot; &quot;thing&quot; + 𒁀 &quot;ba&quot; &quot;give(n)&quot; &gt; 𒃻𒁀 &quot;nig̃2-ba&quot; &quot;present&quot;, 
* A participle with a dependent word: 𒃻 &quot;nig̃2&quot; &quot;thing&quot; &quot;+ 𒍣 zi&quot; &quot;breath&quot; &quot;+ 𒅅 g̃al2&quot; &quot;be there&quot; &gt; 𒃻𒍣𒅅 &quot;nig̃2-zi-g̃al2&quot; &quot;living thing&quot;

An older obsolete pattern was right-headed instead:

* &quot;𒂍 e2&quot; &quot;house&quot; &quot;+ 𒊮 šag4&quot; &quot;heart&quot; &quot;&gt; 𒂍𒊮 e2&quot;-&quot;šag4&quot; &quot;innermost part of a house&quot; 
* 𒃲 &quot;gal&quot; &quot;big&quot; + 𒈜 &quot;nar&quot; &quot;musician&quot; &gt; 𒃲𒈜 &quot;gal-nar&quot; &quot;chief musician&quot;

A participle may be the head of the compound, preceded by a dependent:

* 𒁾 &quot;dub&quot; &quot;clay tablet&quot; + &quot;𒊬 sar&quot; &quot;write&quot; &gt; 𒁾&quot;𒊬 dub-sar&quot; &quot;scribe&quot;
* 𒋗 &quot;šu&quot; &quot;hand&quot; + 𒋳 &quot;tag&quot; &quot;touch&quot; &gt; 𒋗𒋳 &quot;šu-tag&quot; &quot;decoration&quot; (corresponding to the phrasal verb 𒋗...𒋳 &quot;šu...tag&quot; &quot;decorate&quot;)

There are a few cases of nominalized finite verbs, too: 𒁀𒍗 &quot;ba-uš4&quot; &quot;(who) has died&quot; &gt; &quot;dead&quot;

Abstract nouns are formed as compounds headed by the word 𒉆 &quot;nam-&quot; &quot;fate, status&quot;: 𒌉 &quot;dumu&quot; &quot;child&quot; &gt; 𒉆𒌉 &quot;nam-dumu&quot; &quot;childhood&quot;, 𒋻 &quot;tar&quot; &quot;cut, decide&quot; &gt; 𒉆𒋻 &quot;nam-tar&quot; &quot;fate&quot;. Nouns that express the object of an action or an object possessing a characteristic are formed as compounds headed by the word 𒃻 &quot;nig̃2&quot; &quot;thing&quot;: 𒅥 &quot;gu4&quot; &quot;eat&quot; &gt; 𒃻𒅥 &quot;nig̃2&quot;-&quot;gu7&quot; &quot;food&quot;, 𒄭 &quot;good, sweet&quot; &gt; 𒃻𒄭 &quot;nig̃2-dug&quot; &quot;something sweet&quot;. The meaning may also be abstract: 𒋛...𒁲 &quot;si...sa2&quot; &quot;straighten, put in order&quot; &gt; &quot;nig̃2-si-sa2&quot; &quot;justice&quot;. A small number of terms of professions are derived with the preposed element 𒉡 &quot;nu-&quot;: 𒄑𒊬 &quot;g̃eškiri6&quot; &quot;garden&quot; &quot;&gt; 𒉡𒄑𒊬 nu-g̃eškiri6-(k)&quot; &quot;gardener&quot;.

Apparent coordinative compounds also exist, e.g. 𒀭𒆠 &quot;an-ki&quot; &quot;the universe&quot;, lit. &quot;heaven and earth&quot;.

A noun can be formed from an adjective by conversion: for example, 𒂼 &quot;dag̃al&quot; &quot;wide&quot; also means &quot;width&quot;.

On verbs acquiring the properties of adjectives and nouns (agent nouns and action nouns), see the section on &quot;Participles&quot;.

While new verbs cannot be derived, verbal meanings may be expressed by phrasal verbs (see above); in particular, new phrasal verbs are often formed on the basis of nouns by making them the object of the verbs 𒅗 &quot;dug4&quot; &quot;do&quot; or 𒀝 &quot;ak&quot; &quot;make&quot;: 𒀀...𒅗 &quot;a ...dug4&quot;, lit. &quot;to do water&quot; &gt; &quot;to irrigate&quot;, 𒄑𒂵...𒍮 &quot;g̃ešga-rig2 ...ak&quot;, lit. &quot;to do the comb&quot; &gt; &quot;to comb&quot;.

==Dialects==
The standard variety of Sumerian was (: ). A notable variety or sociolect was (: ), possibly to be interpreted as &quot;fine tongue&quot; or &quot;high-pitched voice&quot;. Other apparent terms for registers or dialects were &quot;eme-galam&quot; &quot;high tongue&quot;, &quot;eme-si-sa2&quot; &quot;straight tongue&quot;, &quot;eme-te-na2&quot; &quot;oblique[?] tongue&quot;, &quot;emesukudda&quot;, &quot;emesuha&quot;, &quot;emesidi&quot; and &quot;emeku&quot;. Recently, a regional differentiation into a Northern and a Southern Sumerian dialect area has been posited.

=== Emesal ===
&quot;Emesal&quot; is used exclusively by female characters in some literary texts. In addition, it is dominant in certain genres of cult songs such as the hymns sung by Gala priests. It has been argued that it might have been a female language variety of the kind that exists or has existed in some cultures, such as among the Chukchis and the Garifuna. Alternatively, it has been contended that it must have been originally a regional dialect, since instances of apparent Emesal-like forms are attested in the area of late 3rd millennium Lagash, and some loanwords into Akkadian appear to come from Emesal rather than Emegir. Apart from such isolated glosses, Emesal is first attested in writing in the early Old Babylonian period. It is typically written with syllable signs rather than logograms. A text is often not written consistently in Emesal, but contains apparent Emegir forms as well.

The special features of &quot;Emesal&quot; are mostly phonological and lexical. In terms of phonology, the following are some of the most common sound correspondences:

There are also specifically Emesal lexemes that do not seem to be cognate with their Emegir counterparts, for example:

In grammar, both the cohortative prefix 𒂵 &quot;ga-&quot; and the precative prefix 𒄩 &quot;ḫa-&quot; are replaced by the morpheme 𒁕 &quot;da-&quot; (with the allomorphs 𒉈 &quot;de3&quot;- and 𒂅 &quot;du5&quot;- conditioned by context in the same way as that of the corresponding Emegir prefixes).

=== Southern and Northern Sumerian ===
Bram Jagersma and Gábor Zólyomi distinguish two regional dialects of Sumerian: the Southern Sumerian dialect of Lagash, Umma, Ur and Uruk, which eventually formed the basis for the common standard of the Neo-Sumerian (Ur III) period, and the Northern Sumerian dialect as seen in texts from Nippur, Adab, Isin and Shuruppak (although eventually texts in the standard variety begin to be produced in that area as well). The differences that he finds between the two varieties are:
* In Southern Sumerian, the conjugation prefix 𒉌 /i/- alternated with 𒂊 /e/- in accordance with vowel harmony during the Old Sumerian period, while Northern Sumerian only had /i/-. Later Southern Sumerian generalized /i/- as well.
* In Southern Sumerian, the conjugation prefix expressing the passive was 𒁀 &quot;ba-&quot;, while in Northern Sumerian, it was 𒀀 &quot;a-&quot;.
* In Southern Sumerian after the Old Akkadian period, the conjugation prefix 𒀀 &quot;a-&quot;, which had originally existed in both dialects, disappears entirely apart from the variant 𒀠 &quot;al-&quot;, which only appears in subordinate clauses.
* In Southern Sumerian, the Old Sumerian phoneme &quot;ř&quot; merged with &quot;r&quot;, while in Northern Sumerian, it merged with &quot;d&quot;.

=== Old Babylonian Sumerian ===
The dominant Sumerian variety of the Old Babylonian period, in turn, reflected a different regional dialect from the standard Neo-Sumerian of the Ur III period:
* Neo-Sumerian elides the conjugation prefixes 𒉌 /i/- and 𒀀 /a/- in front of the prefixes 𒉌-/ni/-, 𒊏 -/ra/- and 𒊑 -/ri/-, while Old Babylonian Sumerian retains them.
* The original sequence 𒈬𒂊 &quot;mu-e-&quot;, consisting of the ventive conjugation prefix 𒈬 &quot;mu-&quot; and the 2nd person prefix 𒂊 &quot;-e-&quot;, is contracted into 𒈬 /muː/ in the Ur III standard, but into 𒈨 /meː/ in the most common Old Babylonian variety.
* In general, Old Babylonian Sumerian preserved many features of Northern Sumerian, in contrast to the decidedly Southern character of the Ur III standard. This is doubtlessly connected to the fact that the centre of power in Babylonia moved to the north. In particular, it uses spellings that show that its reflex of the Old Sumerian &quot;ř&quot; phoneme is /d/.

== Interference from Akkadian and other late phenomena ==
In the Old Babylonian period and after it, the Sumerian used by scribes was influenced by their mother tongue, Akkadian, and sometimes more generally by imperfect acquisition of the language. As a result, various deviations from its original structure occur in texts or copies of texts from these times. The following effects have been found in the Old Babylonian period:

* confusion of the animate and inanimate gender, resulting in use of incorrect gender pronouns;
* occasional use of the animate plural &quot;-ene&quot; with inanimates;
* occasional use of the directive case marker -/e/ with animates;
* changes in the use of the nominal case markers so as to parallel the use of Akkadian prepositions, whereas the verbal case markers remain unchanged, resulting in mismatches between nominal and verbal case;
* generalized use of terminative -/še/ to express direction, displacing locative -/a/ as the expression of illative and sublative meanings (&quot;into&quot; and &quot;onto&quot;) and directive -/e/ as the expression of achieving contiguity with something;
* treatment of the prefix sequences /b/-/i/- and /n/-/i/-, which originally could mark the causee in transitive verbs, as causative markers even with intransitive verbs;
* dropping of final -/m/ in the copula -/am/ and sometimes its replacement with -/e/;
* occurrence of -/e/ as a &quot;marû&quot; 3rd person singular marker even in intransitive verbs;
* occurrence of -/n/- as a transitive subject prefix in forms with a &quot;1st&quot; (and, rarely, also 2nd) person ergative participant;
* occurrence of pre-stem pronominal prefixes in ḫamṭu referring to an &quot;intransitive&quot; subject;
* occasional incorporation of the constituent noun of the phrasal verb into the verb stem: e.g. &quot;ki-ag̃2&quot; or &quot;ki ...ki-ag̃2&quot; instead of &quot;ki ...ag̃2&quot; &quot;to love&quot;;
* confusion of the locative case (-/a/) and the directive case (-/e/), as well as the various prefix-case combinations;
* occasional use of the ergative/directive ending -/e/ instead of the genitive case marker -/a(k)/.

For Middle Babylonian and later texts, additional deviations have been noted:

* loss of the contrast between the phonemes &quot;g&quot; (/g/) and &quot;g̃&quot; (/ŋ/), with the latter merging into the former, and use of the signs for &quot;g&quot; also for words with original &quot;g̃&quot;
* omission of the ergative marker -/e/ and apparent loss of the notion of an ergative case;
* use of 𒆤 &quot;-ke4&quot;, originally expressing a sequence of the genitive marker -/ak/ and the ergative marker -/e/, simply as a marker of the genitive, equivalent to -/a(k)/ alone;
* use of the ablative -/ta/ instead of the locative -/a/;
* omission of the genitive marker -/a(k)/;&quot;&quot;
* use of infrequent words, sometimes inappropriately, apparently extracted from lexical lists.&quot;&quot;
* use of Emesal forms in non-Emesal contexts: e.g. /umun/ &quot;lord&quot; and /gašan/ &quot;lady&quot; (instead of 𒂗 &quot;en&quot; and 𒎏 &quot;nin&quot;), moreover written with the innovated logograms 𒌋 and 𒃽, respectively.

==Syllabary==
The table below shows signs used for simple syllables of the form CV or VC. As used for the Sumerian language, the cuneiform script was in principle capable of distinguishing at least 16 consonants, transliterated as
as well as four vowel qualities, &quot;a, e, i, u&quot;.

==Sample text==
===Inscription by Entemena of Lagaš===

This text was inscribed on a small clay cone . It recounts the beginning of a war between the city-states of Lagaš and Umma during the Early Dynastic III period, one of the earliest border conflicts recorded. (RIME 1.09.05.01)

<text>Car Wars is a vehicle combat simulation game developed by Steve Jackson Games. It was first published in 1980. Players control armed vehicles in a post-apocalyptic future.

==Game play==
In &quot;Car Wars&quot;, players assume control of one or more cars or other powered vehicles, from motorcycles to semi trucks. Optional rules include piloting helicopters, ultralights, balloons, boats, submarines, and tanks. The vehicles are typically outfitted with weapons (such as missiles and machine guns), components (like heavy-duty fire-proof wheels, and nitro injectors), and defensive elements (armor plating and radar tracking systems). Within any number of settings, the players then direct their vehicles in combat.

The published games use cardstock counters to represent vehicles in a simulated battle upon printed battlemaps. While the game rules allow for any scale, most editions of the game were published to use a 1-inch = 15-feet scale (1:180 scale), although the Fifth Edition switched to 1-inch = 5-feet (1:60 scale). At this larger scale, players can use miniature toy vehicles such as Hot Wheels or Matchbox cars, S gauge model railroading scenery, or 28mm-30mm scale wargaming miniatures.

&quot;Car Wars&quot; had many scenarios available and the system allowed players to make their own. Common scenarios include a harrowing gauntlet and competition in an arena to win a virtual cash prize with which to upgrade their cars. Many game sessions consist of players taking their cars through many successive arena-style scenarios, upgrading their cars between each round. At the height of the game&#x27;s popularity, many gaming conventions and gaming clubs sponsored &quot;Car Wars&quot; tournaments where finalist players could win real world prizes.

&quot;Car Wars&quot; uses standard dice to determine the outcomes of weapon fire, damage and vehicle control during the game. It is played in turns, each turn representing one second of real time. Each turn was initially divided into ten phases (first edition) then five (revised edition) and in the last edition three. All action in &quot;Car Wars&quot; is simultaneous. Players do not roll for initiative as is common in other combat games, instead each phase a vehicle moves a distance determined by the vehicle&#x27;s speed. Players may fire weapons on any phase as long as they have line-of-sight with a target of their choosing. As part of movement players may attempt turns and other maneuvers of increasing difficulty. The more maneuvers one attempts in a turn and the more difficult they are, the more likely it is that a player&#x27;s car will skid or crash. After all phases of movement and combat are resolved, a new turn begins. Typically, a game is over after a few turns, which represents a combat of a few seconds, but because every action in the game must be resolved a typical game takes a few hours to play.

While the core of the original &quot;Car Wars&quot; was a boardgame, the supplements allowed it to be extended into a larger game with light role-playing elements.
Other expansions such as rule-additions,
mini-scenarios
and dual-statted products like &quot;Autoduel Champions&quot; (for use with &quot;Car Wars&quot; or &quot;Champions&quot;)
published in game magazines expanded the game even further.

==Publication history==
&quot;Car Wars&quot; was first published in a small ziplock-bag format in 1980, and cited Alan Dean Foster&#x27;s short story, &quot;Why Johnny Can&#x27;t Speed&quot;, as a primary inspiration. (Later editions also cited Harlan Ellison&#x27;s short story &quot;Along the Scenic Route&quot; and the movie Death Race 2000.) The game won the Charles S. Roberts Award (Origins Award) for &quot;Best Science Fiction Boardgame of 1981&quot;
and was named to the &quot;Games&quot; magazine Games 100 list in 1985.

As the game became more popular, there were a series of increasingly more expensive and elaborate editions. &quot;Car Wars&quot; also served as the inspiration for the 1985 video game &quot;Autoduel&quot;, published by Origin Systems.
Steve Jackson continues to express an interest in developing video games based on the &quot;Car Wars&quot; concept.

The game&#x27;s popularity waned during the 1990s, and in response to slipping sales, Steve Jackson Games ceased support for &quot;Car Wars&quot;. The last official &quot;Cars Wars&quot; material for the original game appeared in &quot;Pyramid&quot; magazine (an article introducing High Torque Motors, by Robert Deis).

Autoduel America, the setting for &quot;Car Wars&quot;, was developed for role-playing games (RPGs) using Steve Jackson Games&#x27; &quot;GURPS&quot; system (called &quot;GURPS Autoduel&quot;). That &quot;GURPS&quot; worldbook has seen two editions. A series of expansions for both the &quot;GURPS&quot; version and boardgame, &quot;The AADA Road Atlas and Survival Guide&quot;, were published in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

In 2002, Steve Jackson Games released an entirely new version of &quot;Car Wars&quot;. Redesigned for a new audience, it was called version 5.0. The new game&#x27;s unusual marketing, scattering the game across several redundant products, met with mixed responses and the game&#x27;s popularity has continued to wane. The 2002 products are still in print.

In October 2009, Steve Jackson Games made the &quot;Car Wars Compendium: Second Edition (Fifth Printing)&quot; available as a PDF from the e23 online store.

&quot;Car Wars&quot; (both boardgame and RPG version) was translated into French by Croc.

&quot;Car Wars: The Card Game&quot; was released in 1991 (with a 2nd edition in 2001), designed by Creede and Sharleen Lambard, and published by Steve Jackson Games.

===Main editions===
The first four editions use a ground scale of 1-inch = 15-feet. &quot;Aeroduel&quot; introduced an air-to-air scale of ¼-inch = 15-feet. The &quot;Fifth Edition&quot; uses a revised scale of 3-inches = 15-feet.

==Background story==
&quot;Car Wars&quot; is set 50 years after the publication dates of the various books. In this alternative future, natural resources are severely depleted and the United States government nationalized oil production. This eventually led to a second American civil war, ending with the secession of the &quot;Free Oil States&quot;, Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana. Following famine in various parts of the world, there are limited nuclear exchanges between the USSR and the US, but anti-missile systems limit the resulting damage. After these wars, there are years of worldwide economic crisis, and related global unrest, during which &quot;death sports&quot; become a popular form of entertainment. This post-apocalyptic setting has drawn comparisons between &quot;Car Wars&quot; and the &quot;Mad Max&quot; movies.

As things began to recover, the organized sport of &quot;autodueling&quot; was born as a form of armed demolition derbies. The American Autoduel Association (AADA) was formed, to sponsor sporting events and up-and-coming autoduelists. In this future, technology has allowed for new vehicle designs, miniaturized weapon systems, and replacements for internal combustion engines. Furthermore, human cloning (together with techniques for storing memories), has made death only a minor setback for autoduelists who can afford the procedure. &quot;Car Wars&quot; is a game designed for simulating these autoduels between competing players.

==Clubs and organizations==
The American Autoduel Association (AADA) was a worldwide group of players. It was started by Steve Jackson Games who supported the club with a quarterly magazine called &quot;Autoduel Quarterly&quot;. This contained campaign ideas, vehicles, &quot;mock&quot; advertisements, and new weapons and accessories, as well as questions and answers. Subscribers would receive a bonus in the form of an extra cutout or cartoon on the protective mailing cover. Local clubs could also pay a yearly membership fee to be considered &quot;official.&quot;

The AADA served as a structured clearinghouse for common rules and guidelines to be followed during &#x27;official&#x27; events. World Championships were held each year at the Origins Game Fair.

The AADA is no longer an official club as recognized by Steve Jackson Games. There are still several local clubs that claim to be AADA affiliated, and there are even web sites where interested parties can enjoy PBEM games. One site has a &quot;Car Wars&quot; podcast.

The official &quot;Car Wars&quot; site notes plans to relaunch the AADA and start a new periodical called &quot;Autoduel Times&quot;.
No date is given for this project.

===Uncle Albert&#x27;s Auto Stop &amp; Gunnery Shop 2035 Catalog===

Uncle Albert&#x27;s Auto Stop &amp; Gunnery Shop 2035 Catalog is a supplement published by Steve Jackson Games in 1985 for the vehicle combat simulation game &quot;Car Wars&quot;.

&quot;Uncle Albert&#x27;s Auto Stop &amp; Gunnery Shop 2035 Catalog&quot; was the first of six &quot;Car Wars&quot; expansions published by Steve Jackson Games between 1985 and 1992. Each supplement featured new cars and armament compiled from past issues of &quot;Autoduel Quarterly&quot;. This book is written in the style of a catalog that includes over 120 items, complete with prices, sizes, descriptions, and everything else needed to use these items during a game of &quot;Car Wars&quot;.

Craig Sheeley reviewed &quot;Uncle Albert&#x27;s Auto Stop &amp; Gunnery Shop 2035 Catalog&quot; in &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; No. 76. Sheeley commented that &quot;Some of us like complexity. Some of us like to build our own vehicles, and outfit them with dozens of options. Some of us like the monster that &quot;Car Wars&quot; has become [...] If you are one of these &quot;Car Wars&quot; players, this supplement will prove to be invaluable, as it is an almost complete listing of the options in &quot;Car Wars&quot;.&quot;

Mike Eckenfels recalled this supplement with fondness, saying, &quot;If the ‘basic’ Car Wars rules just didn’t have enough creative ways to destroy, maim, and otherwise disassemble, the &quot;Uncle Albert&quot; catalogs certainly helped pad those needs, and then some [...] There’s a lot of &quot;Car Wars&quot; goodness in the pages of this one catalog, alone, to really get you going.&quot; Eckenfels noted that &quot;Some accessories actually have in-game use while others have more of an RPG element to it (or are just nice to have to brag about around the table, because apparently wasting pretend money in a fictional game on things that don’t actually have a practical use in-game are... bragable, I guess).&quot; He concluded, &quot;this was a nice little addition to the Car Wars universe back in the day.&quot;

==Other products==
In addition to the spin-off video game, &quot;Autoduel&quot;, Marvel Comics published &quot;Car Warriors&quot;, a 1991 four-issue comic book miniseries set in the &quot;Car Wars&quot; world.

There were also a series of six gamebooks based in the &quot;Car Wars&quot; universe, where a player could make choices for the protagonist to affect the outcome of the story. The Car Wars Adventure Gamebooks were titled: &quot;Battle Road&quot;, &quot;Fuel&#x27;s Gold&quot;, &quot;Dueltrack&quot;, &quot;Badlands Run&quot;, &quot;Green Circle Blues&quot;, and &quot;Mean Streets&quot;.

A trilogy of novels was published by Tor Books: &quot;The Square Deal&quot; by David Drake in 1992, &quot;Double Jeopardy: Car Warriors 2&quot; by Aaron Alston in 1994, and &quot;Back from Hell&quot; by Mick Farren in 1999.

In 1995 VictorMaxx technologies announced plans for a series of gaming centers based on &quot;Car Wars&quot;, with a prototype site to debut in Chicago in 1996.

==Reception==
In Issue 36 of &quot;Phoenix&quot; (March–April 1982), John Lambshead reviewed the first edition of &quot;Car Wars&quot; and thought it was &quot;quite decently presented.&quot; However, Lambshead found the simultaneous move system &quot;excruciatingly tedious&quot;, and the combat system complex. He wondered who the audience for this game was, since it was too complex to be a &quot;fun&quot; game, but &quot;On the other hand, who wants to expend so much effort simply to drive an armoured beach buggy around.&quot; He concluded that &quot;a combination of intelligence and immaturity is required for a full appreciation of &quot;Car Wars&quot;.&quot;

The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; described the game as &quot;vicious combat takes place on the highways and waters of a future that is not a kinder, gentler America&quot;.

In a retrospective review of &quot;Car Wars&quot; in &quot;Black Gate&quot;, Ty Johnston said &quot;If you ever wanted to take part in the fast-driving, hard-hitting action of the &quot;Mad Max&quot; universe where guns and cars ruled the roads, and the plains and the deserts and the ... etc., then you would do well to buckle in and pick up one of the versions of &quot;Car Wars&quot; which has been made available over the years.&quot;

<doc id="65681" wikidata="Q1358845" url="?curid=65681" title="Polytonality">
<text>Polytonality (also polyharmony) is the musical use of more than one key simultaneously. Bitonality is the use of only two different keys at the same time. Polyvalence or polyvalency is the use of more than one harmonic function, from the same key, at the same time.
Some examples of bitonality superimpose fully harmonized sections of music in different keys.

==History==
===In traditional music===
Lithuanian traditional singing style sutartines is based on polytonality. A typical sutartines song is based on a six-bar melody, where the first three bars contain melody based on the notes of the triad of a major key (for example, in G major), and the next three bars is based on another key, always a major second higher or lower (for example, in A major). This six-bar melody is performed as a canon, and repetition starts from the fourth bar. As a result, parts are constantly singing in different tonality (key) simultaneously (in G and in A). As a traditional style, sutartines disappeared in Lithuanian villages by the first decades of the 20th century, but later became a national musical symbol of Lithuanian music.

Tribes throughout India—including the Kuravan of Kerala, the Jaunsari of Uttar Pradesh, the Gond, the Santal, and the Munda—also use bitonality, in responsorial song.

===In classical music===

In J. S. Bach&#x27;s &quot;Clavier-Übung III&quot;, there is a two-part passage where, according to Scholes: &quot;It will be seen that this is a canon at the fourth below; as it is a strict canon, all the intervals of the leading &#x27;voice&#x27; are exactly imitated by the following &#x27;voice&#x27;, and since the key of the leading part is D minor modulating to G minor, that of the following part is necessarily A minor modulating to D minor. Here, then, we have a case of polytonality, but Bach has so adjusted his progressions (by the choice at the critical moment of notes common to two keys) that while the right hand is doubtless quite under the impression that the piece is in D minor, etc., and the left hand that it is in A minor, etc., the listener feels that the whole thing is homogeneous in key, though rather fluctuating from moment to moment. In other words, Bach is trying to make the best of both worlds—the homotonal one of his own day and (prophetically) the polytonal one of a couple of centuries later.&quot;

Another early use of polytonality occurs in the classical period in the finale of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&#x27;s composition &quot;A Musical Joke&quot;, which he deliberately ends with the violins, violas and horns playing in four discordant keys simultaneously. However, it was not featured prominently in non-programmatic contexts until the twentieth century, particularly in the work of Charles Ives (&quot;Psalm 67&quot;, c. 1898–1902), Béla Bartók (&quot;Fourteen Bagatelles,&quot; Op. 6, 1908), and Stravinsky (&quot;Petrushka&quot;, 1911). Ives claimed that he learned the technique of polytonality from his father, who taught him to sing popular songs in one key while harmonizing them in another.

Although it is only used in one section and intended to represent drunken soldiers, there is an early example of polytonality in Heinrich Ignaz Franz Biber&#x27;s short composition &quot;Battalia&quot;, written in 1673.

Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; is widely credited with popularizing bitonality, and contemporary writers such as Casella (1924) describe him as the progenitor of the technique: &quot;the first work presenting polytonality in typical completeness—not merely in the guise of a more or less happy &#x27;experiment&#x27;, but responding throughout to the demands of expression—is beyond all question the grandiose &quot;Le Sacre du Printemps&quot; of Stravinsky (1913)&quot;.

Bartók&#x27;s &quot;Playsong&quot; demonstrates easily perceivable bitonality through &quot;the harmonic motion of each key ... [being] relatively uncomplicated and very diatonic&quot;. Here, the &quot;duality of key&quot; featured is A minor and C minor.

Other polytonal composers influenced by Stravinsky include those in the French group, Les Six, particularly Darius Milhaud, as well as Americans such as Aaron Copland.

Benjamin Britten used bi- and polytonality in his operas, as well as enharmonic relationships, for example to signify the conflict between Claggart (F minor) and Billy (E major) in &quot;Billy Budd&quot; (note the shared enharmonically equivalent G/A) or to express the main character&#x27;s &quot;maladjustment&quot; in &quot;Peter Grimes&quot;.

==Polytonality and polychords==

Polytonality requires the presentation of simultaneous key-centers. The term &quot;polychord&quot; describes chords that can be constructed by superimposing multiple familiar tonal sonorities. For example, familiar ninth, eleventh, and thirteenth chords can be built from or decomposed into separate chords:

Thus polychords do not necessarily suggest polytonality, but they may not be explained as a single tertian chord. The Petrushka chord is an example of a polychord. This is the norm in jazz, for example, which makes frequent use of &quot;extended&quot; and polychordal harmonies without any intended suggestion of &quot;multiple keys.&quot;

===Polyvalency===
The following passage, taken from Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Sonata in E, Op. 81a (&quot;Les Adieux&quot;), suggests clashes between tonic and dominant harmonies in the same key.

Leeuw points to Beethoven&#x27;s use of the clash between tonic and dominant, such as in his Third Symphony, as polyvalency rather than bitonality, with polyvalency being, &quot;the telescoping of diverse functions that should really occur &quot;in succession&quot; to one another&quot;.


===Polymodality===
Passages of music, such as Poulenc&#x27;s &quot;Trois mouvements perpétuels&quot;, I., may be misinterpreted as polytonal rather than polymodal. In this case, two scales are recognizable but are assimilated through the common tonic (B).

===Polyscalarity===

Polyscalarity is defined as &quot;the simultaneous use of musical objects &quot;which clearly suggest different source-collections&quot;. Specifically about Stravinsky&#x27;s music, Tymoczko uses the term polyscalarity out of deference to terminological sensibilities. In other words, the term is meant to avoid any implication that the listener can perceive two keys at once. Though Tymoczko believes that polytonality is perceivable, he believes polyscalarity is better suited to describe Stravinsky&#x27;s music. This term is also used as a response to Van den Toorn&#x27;s analysis against polytonality. Van den Toorn, in an attempt to dismiss polytonal analysis used a monoscalar approach to analyze the music with the octatonic scale. However, Tymoczko states that this was problematic in that it does not resolve all instances of multiple interactions between scales and chords. Moreover, Tymoczko quotes Stravinsky&#x27;s claim that the music of &quot;Petrouchka&quot;″s second tableau was conceived &quot;in two keys&quot;. Polyscalarity is then a term encompassing multiscalar superimpositions and cases which give a different explanation than the octatonic scale.

==Challenges==

Some music theorists, including Milton Babbitt and Paul Hindemith have questioned whether polytonality is a useful or meaningful notion or &quot;viable auditory possibility&quot;. Babbitt called polytonality a &quot;self-contradictory expression which, if it is to possess any meaning at all, can only be used as a label to designate a certain degree of expansion of the individual elements of a well-defined harmonic or voice-leading unit&quot;. Other theorists to question or reject polytonality include Allen Forte and Benjamin Boretz, who hold that the notion involves logical incoherence.

Other theorists, such as Dmitri Tymoczko, respond that the notion of &quot;tonality&quot; is a psychological, not a logical notion. Furthermore, Tymoczko argues that two separate key-areas can, at least at a rudimentary level, be heard at the same time: for example, when listening to two different pieces played by two different instruments in two areas of a room.

===Octatonicism===

Some critics of the notion of polytonality, such as Pieter van den Toorn, argue that the octatonic scale accounts in concrete pitch-relational terms for the qualities of &quot;clashing&quot;, &quot;opposition&quot;, &quot;stasis&quot;, &quot;polarity&quot;, and &quot;superimposition&quot; found in Stravinsky&#x27;s music and, far from negating them, explains these qualities on a deeper level. For example, the passage from &quot;Petrushka&quot;, cited above, uses only notes drawn from the C octatonic collection C–C–D–E–F–G–A–A.

<doc id="65683" wikidata="Q1259359" url="?curid=65683" title="Drive-by shooting">
<text>A drive-by shooting is a type of assault that usually involves the perpetrator(s) firing a weapon from within a motor vehicle and then fleeing. Drive-by shootings allow the perpetrators to quickly strike their targets and flee the scene before law enforcement is able to respond. A drive-by shooting&#x27;s prerequisites include access to a vehicle and a gun. The protection, anonymity, sense of power, and ease of escape provided by the getaway vehicle lead some perpetrators to feel safe expressing their hostility toward others.

==Historical conception==

The invention of the drive-by shooting is attributed to Nestor Makhno, commander of the Revolutionary Insurgent Army of Ukraine at the beginning of the 20th century. He combined horse and carriage with a machine gun in order to quickly assault targets then flee before they could properly react. It was called a Tachanka.

Motor vehicles offer similar concealment for transport of weapons to crime scenes in situations like the 2015 San Bernardino attack, and can simultaneously serve as getaway vehicles. Using a vehicle allows the shooter to approach the intended target without being noticed and then to speed away before anyone reacts. Besides gang-related attacks, drive-by shootings may result from road rage or personal disputes between neighbors, acquaintances, or strangers unrelated to gang membership.

==United States==
There is no national data on the volume of drive-by shootings. National statistical databases such as the Uniform Crime Reports record the shooting outcome rather than the method. Non-gang-related drive-by shootings are not well researched, but journalistic accounts and police reports suggest that these constitute a significant proportion of the drive-by shootings to which police respond. Drive-by shootings that occur as an extreme form of road rage appear to be rather unpredictable in terms of the times and locations, but often occur in reaction to seemingly trivial events, although the underlying motivation usually appears to be a series of unrelated stressors in the perpetrator&#x27;s life. A drive-by shooting&#x27;s prerequisites include access to a vehicle and a gun. Recent legislation has focused on transfer of guns rather than vehicles, so those who carry out drive-by shootings may use their own vehicle or one that has been borrowed, rented, or stolen.

The primary motivations for a gang-involved drive-by include intimidation, terrorisation, and assassination of rival street gang members. Such shootings are associated with gang violence in urban areas of the United States but also occur in other contexts. The tactic is also called simply a &quot;drive-by&quot;.

===History===
Motorcycle ride-by killings were a common form of murder used by drug lord Griselda Blanco during her years controlling the Miami cocaine trade routes in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Blanco herself died by this method after having been shot twice in the head by a motorcyclist in a drive-by shooting in Medellín, Colombia. Drive-by shootings are also included in the Ku Klux Klan&#x27;s &quot;modus operandi&quot;.

Chicago Prohibition-era gangster and North Side Gang boss Bugs Moran was considered a &quot;pioneer&quot; of the drive-by shooting, with the Tommy gun being the weapon of choice. The notoriously vicious gang performed multiple shootings against their rivals, including the South Side gang led by Al Capone and the Genna brothers. Other Irish American gangs, such as the Saltis-McErlane Gang, the Sheldon Gang, and the Southside O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s, also executed drive-bys on one another in the Chicago area. Al Capone also had a Cadillac painted in Chicago police colors (police lights included) with armored rear windshield and a small hatch to fire machine guns with the car moving. 

During the Second Philadelphia Mafia War, two warring factions fought for control of the family; one led by former alleged boss, John Stanfa; and the &quot;Young Turks&quot; led by up-and-coming gangster Joey Merlino. On 5 August 1993, Merlino survived a drive-by shooting assassination attempt by two Stanfa gunmen, taking four bullets in the leg and buttocks, while his friend and associate Michael Ciancaglini was shot in the chest and killed. On 31 August 1993, a drive by shooting was performed on Stanfa and his son while they were driving on the Schuylkill Expressway. Stanfa escaped uninjured and his son survived being shot in the jaw.

In 1992, the Mexican Mafia prison gang announced an edict prohibiting Sureno gangs from committing drive-by shootings, in order to avoid police crackdowns throughout neighborhoods in southern California. Those who broke the edict were to be greenlighted for assault or even death in the California prison system.

Numerous hip hop artists have been targeted in drive-bys; prominent rappers who were killed in such incidents include Tupac Shakur, The Notorious B.I.G., Big L, and Mac Dre. Other rappers, such as Obie Trice and 50 Cent have survived being assaulted in drive-by shootings.

In 2015, Jorja Leap, an UCLA anthropologist studying gang culture, pointed out how drive-by shooting tactics are being replaced by the &quot;walk-up shooting&quot; method, because murders have become more targeted and while driving, there is low accuracy in aiming.

==Italy==
In Italy, the circulation of firearms is low compared to that in the United States, and just over a million civilians own a firearm license, so face-to-face shooting or threats with firearms are rare. Drive-by shootings, on the other hand, are common, especially in professional criminal contexts, as the statistical incidence says that almost all assaults with firearms are carried out from cars, motorcycles, or scooters. These kinds of vehicles are used since they provide better mobility in the narrow city districts. From the 1970s into the 21st century, Cosa Nostra and the Camorra have both been known to perform drive-by shootings during clan or mafia wars, or to assassinate targets. One notable example of such, is Carabiniere general Carlo Alberto dalla Chiesa, who was killed with an AK-47 in a drive by shooting in September 1982 in Palermo.

One of the most striking episodes of a drive-by shooting in Italy was the Macerata shooting, conducted against six Africans by a far-right extremist, Luca Traini, using an Alfa Romeo 147. However, the attack caused no deaths.

==Syrian and Iraqi civil wars==
In the first decade of the 21st century, drive-by shootings were also used for assassinations by militants in Iraq, including that of Waldemar Milewicz and Hatem Kamil, and in Syria.

<text>The Mini (developed as ADO15) is a small, two-door, four-seat car produced by the British Motor Corporation (BMC) and its successors, from 1959 until 2000. Minus a brief hiatus, original Minis were built for four decades and sold during five, from the last year of the 1950s into the last year of the 20th century, over a single generation, as fastbacks, estates, and convertibles.

The original Mini is considered an icon of 1960s British popular culture. Its space-saving transverse engine and front-wheel drive layout – allowing 80% of the area of the car&#x27;s floorpan to be used for passengers and luggage – influenced a generation of car makers. In 1999, the Mini was voted the second-most influential car of the 20th century, behind the Ford Model T, and ahead of the Citroën DS and Volkswagen Beetle. The front-wheel-drive, transverse-engine layout were used in many other &quot;supermini&quot; style car designs such as Honda N360 (1967), Nissan Cherry (1970), and Fiat 127 (1971). The layout was also adapted for larger subcompact designs.

This distinctive two-door car was designed for BMC by Sir Alec Issigonis. It was manufactured at the Longbridge plant in Birmingham, England located next to BMC&#x27;s headquarters and at the former Morris Motors plant at Cowley near Oxford, in the Victoria Park/Zetland British Motor Corporation (Australia) factory in Sydney, Australia, and later also in Spain (Authi), Belgium, Italy (Innocenti), Chile, Malta, Portugal, South Africa, Uruguay, Venezuela, and Yugoslavia (IMV).

The Italian version of the Mini was produced by Innocenti in Milan and it was sold under the &quot;Innocenti Mini&quot; marque. Innocenti was also producing Lambretta scooters at that time.

The Mini Mark I had three major UK updates: the Mark II, the Clubman, and the Mark III. Within these was a series of variations, including an estate car, a pick-up, a van, and the Mini Moke, a jeep-like buggy.

The performance versions, the Mini Cooper and Cooper &quot;S&quot;, were successful as both race and rally cars, winning the Monte Carlo Rally in 1964, 1965, and 1967. In 1966, the first-placed Mini (along with nine other cars) was disqualified after the finish, under a controversial decision that the car&#x27;s headlights were against the rules.

In August 1959, the Mini was marketed under the Austin and Morris names, as the Austin Seven and Morris Mini-Minor. The Austin Seven was renamed Austin Mini in January 1962 and Mini became a marque in its own right in 1969. In 1980, it once again became the Austin Mini, and in 1988, just &quot;Mini&quot; (although the &quot;Rover&quot; badge was applied on some models exported to Japan).

BMW acquired the Rover Group (formerly British Leyland) in 1994, and sold the greater part of it in 2000, but retained the rights to build cars using the Mini name. Retrospectively, the car is known as the &quot;Classic Mini&quot; to distinguish it from the modern, BMW-influenced MINI family of vehicles produced since 2000.

==Design and development==
The Mini came about because of a fuel shortage caused by the 1956 Suez Crisis. Petrol was once again rationed in the UK, sales of large cars slumped, and the market for German bubble cars boomed, even in countries such as the United Kingdom, where imported cars were still a rarity.

Leonard Lord, the head of BMC, reportedly detested these cars so much that he vowed to rid the streets of them and design a &#x27;proper miniature car&#x27;. He laid down some basic design requirements – the car should be contained within a box that measured ; and the passenger accommodation should occupy of the length; and the engine, for reasons of cost, should be an existing unit.

Alec Issigonis, who had been working for Alvis, had been recruited back to BMC in 1955 with a brief from Lord to design a range of technically advanced family cars in the same innovative spirit as his earlier Morris Minor to complement BMC&#x27;s existing conventional models. Issigonis had set out design projects for three cars – large and small family cars and a very small economy car. His initial work was on the largest car, designated XC9001, with the smallest car, XC9003, having the lowest priority despite it being Issigonis&#x27; greatest personal interest. With Lord&#x27;s dictum to produce a bubble car competitor and his revised design requirements being laid down in October 1956, work on XC9001 stopped and XC9003 became the priority. In addition to Issigonis, the team that developed the Mini included John Sheppard (who had worked with Issigonis at Alvis), Jack Daniels (who had worked with Issigonis on the Morris Minor), Chris Kingham (also from Alvis), Charles Griffin (from Cowley), Vic Everton (from the body—jig shop), Ron Dovey (who built the bodies), Dick Gallimore (who laid out the experimental bodies), and George Cooper (whose job was to check the layouts). Together, by July 1957, they had designed and built the original XC9003 prototype, which was affectionately named the &quot;Orange Box&quot; because of its colour. Leonard Lord approved the car for production on 19 July and XC9003 became project ADO15.

The ADO15 used a conventional BMC A-Series four-cylinder, water-cooled engine, but departed from tradition by mounting it transversely, with the engine-oil lubricated, four-speed transmission in the sump, and by employing front-wheel drive. Drive was taken down to the transmission via a conventional clutch coupled to a set of primary gears on the end of the crankshaft which gave rise to the characteristic transmission &quot;whine&quot; for which the Mini became famous. Almost all small front-wheel drive cars developed since have used a similar configuration, except with the transmission separately enclosed rather than using the engine oil and mounted directly onto the end of the crankshaft, but with unequal length driveshafts. The radiator was mounted at the left side of the car so that the engine-mounted fan could be retained, but with reversed pitch so that it blew air into the natural low pressure area under the front wing. This location saved vehicle length, but had the disadvantage of feeding the radiator with air that had been heated by passing over the engine. It also exposed the entire ignition system to the direct entry of rainwater through the grille. Early prototypes used the existing 948-cc A-Series unit, but this provided the ADO15 with performance far greater than its price and purpose required – a top speed of about . The engine was reduced to a new 848-cc capacity with a shorter stroke. This reduced power from 37 to 33 bhp and caused a significant drop in torque, so provided more realistic performance, especially when the ADO15 body was widened by 2 inches (5.08 cm) over the XC9003 prototype, which blunted the car&#x27;s top speed while improving its stability and roadholding. Even so, the ADO15 had a top speed of , which was better than many other economy cars of the time.

The suspension system, designed by Issigonis&#x27;s friend Alex Moulton at Moulton Developments Limited, used compact rubber cones instead of conventional springs. This space-saving design also featured rising progressive-rate springing of the cones, and provided some natural damping, in addition to the normal dampers. Built into the subframes, the rubber cone system gave a raw and bumpy ride accentuated by the woven-webbing seats, but the rigidity of the rubber cones, together with the wheels&#x27; positioning at the corners of the car, gave the Mini go kart-like handling.
Initially, an interconnected fluid system was planned, similar to the one that Alec Issigonis and Alex Moulton were working on in the mid-1950s at Alvis. They had assessed the mechanically interconnected Citroën 2CV suspension at that time (according to an interview by Moulton with &quot;Car Magazine&quot; in the late 1990s), which inspired the design of the hydrolastic suspension system for the Mini and Morris/Austin 1100, to try to keep the benefits of the 2CV system (ride comfort, body levelling, keeping the roadwheel under good control and the tyres in contact with the road), but with added roll stiffness that the 2CV lacked. The short development time of the car meant this was not ready in time for the Mini&#x27;s launch. The system intended for the Mini was further developed and the hydrolastic system was first used on the Morris 1100, launched in 1962; the Mini gained the system later in 1964. As launched, the Mini had simpler suspension made from conical springs of solid rubber. These were compact, saving on intrusion into the cabin space, and required no maintenance. The conical shape gave the springs a progressive action, becoming stiffer at greater degrees of compression. This gave the ADO15 a smooth ride over small bumps, but minimised roll and pitch on more uneven surfaces. It also allowed the springs to cope with the huge variance in load between an unladen car (about 600 kg or 1300 lb) and a fully laden one (just over 1000 kg or 2240 lb, or a 70% increase).

Ten-inch (254 mm) wheels were specified, so new tyres had to be developed, the initial contract going to Dunlop. Issigonis went to Dunlop stating that he wanted even smaller, wheels (even though he had already settled on 10-inch). An agreement was made on the 10-inch size, after Dunlop rejected the eight-inch proposition.

Many features were designed into the ADO15&#x27;s interior to maximise its passenger and luggage space on top of the major savings allowed by the transverse engine and 10-inch wheels. Sliding windows allowed single-skin doors to be fitted, improving elbow room and reducing costs. A bracing bar was fitted across the door frame to brace the single skin and this was later adapted into a large storage bin on each door. Issigonis later said that he had sized the bins to carry the ingredients of his favourite drink, a dry martini in the correct proportions (one bottle of vermouth and 2 of Gordon&#x27;s Gin). Similar bins were provided outboard of the rear seats, also serving a dual function of bracing the single-skin body panel. Small items could also be stowed under the rear seats, and early Minis were sold with optional wicker baskets specially shaped to slot under the seats. The fixed rear parcel shelf contributed to the rigidity of the body shell, although it did preclude fitting the ADO15 with a hatchback. The boot lid was hinged at the bottom so that the car could be driven with it open to increase luggage space. On early cars, the number plate, together with its light, was hinged at the top so that it could swing down to remain visible when the boot lid was open. This feature was later discontinued after it was discovered that exhaust gases could leak into the cockpit when the boot was open.

The Mini was designed as a monocoque shell with welded seams visible on the outside of the car running down the A and C pillars, and between the body and the floor pan. Those that ran from the base of the A-pillar to the wheel well were described as &#x27;everted&#x27; (lit., &#x27;turned outward&#x27;) to provide more room for the front seat occupants. To further simplify construction, the hinges for the doors and boot lid were mounted externally. This also saved a small amount of cabin space. It also made the ADO15 very easy to assemble from complete knock-down kits in overseas markets with only basic industry. Cars could be assembled with minimal use of jigs as the external seams made the panels largely &#x27;self-aligning&#x27;. They also allowed panels to be stacked flat on top of one other for easy shipping. As originally built, all the structural body panels were welded to the top of the single floor pressing, but this caused major problems with water entering the cabin and was quickly changed in the first months of production.

Early prototypes were fully unitary in construction, but the cars broke apart under the high loads from the large lever ratios used with the rubber cone suspension. The design was changed to use steel subframes to carry the drivetrain and suspension for the front and rear. This also simplified production, as both subframes could be built up independently and then mated to the already-completed bodyshell. It also opened up the possibility of easily producing variants on the ADO15 as a body of any shape or design could be used provided it could accommodate the subframes.

In 1959, BMC and Alec Issigonis won the Dewar Trophy, for the design and production of the Mini.

The Mini shape had become so well known that by the 1990s, Rover Group – the heirs to BMC – were able to register its design as a trademark in its own right.
==Mark I: 1959–1967==
The production version of the Mini was demonstrated to the press in April 1959, and by August, several thousand cars had been produced ready for the first sales. The Mini was officially announced to the public on 26 August 1959. Some 2,000 cars had already been sent abroad and were displayed that day in almost 100 countries. The key dimensions were:
* wheelbase: 
*front track: 
*rear track: 
*length: 
*width: 
*height: 
*unladen weight: (approx).

The first example, a Morris Mini-Minor with the registration 621 AOK, is on display at the Heritage Motor Centre in Warwickshire. Another early example from 1959 is on display at the National Motor Museum in Hampshire.

The Mini was marketed under BMC&#x27;s two main brand names, Austin and Morris, until 1969, when it became a marque in its own right. The Morris version was known to all as &quot;the Mini&quot; or the &quot;Morris Mini-Minor&quot;. This seems to have been a play on words: the Morris Minor was a larger, well known, and successful car that continued in production, and &quot;minor&quot; is Latin for &quot;lesser&quot;, so an abbreviation of the Latin word for &quot;least&quot; – &quot;minimus&quot; – was used for the new even smaller car. One name proposed for the almost identical Austin version was Austin Newmarket, but it was sold as the Austin Seven (sometimes written as &quot;SE7EN&quot; in early publicity material – with the &#x27;7&#x27; using the letter V rotated anticlockwise so it approximated the number 7), which recalled the popular small Austin 7 of the 1920s and 1930s.

Until 1962, the cars appeared in North America and France as the Austin 850 and Morris 850, and in Denmark as the Austin Partner (until 1964) and Morris Mascot (until 1981). It was introduced in Australia as Morris 850 only (not &quot;Austin&quot;), and then later as Morris Cooper and Morris Cooper S versions, as well. The Morris name Mini (Mini-Minor) was first used for Austin&#x27;s version by BMC in 1961 when the Austin Seven was rebranded as the Austin Mini, somewhat to the surprise of the Sharp&#x27;s Commercials car company (later known as Bond Cars), who had been using the name Minicar for their three-wheeled vehicles since 1949. However, legal action was somehow averted, and BMC used the name &quot;Mini&quot; thereafter.

In 1964, the suspension of the cars was replaced by another Moulton design, the hydrolastic system. The new suspension gave a softer ride, but it also increased weight and production cost. In 1971, the original rubber suspension reappeared and was retained for the remaining life of the Mini.

From October 1965, the option of the unique Automotive Products designed four-speed automatic transmission became available. Cars fitted with this became the Mini-Matic.

Slow at the outset, Mark I sales strengthened across most of the model lines in the 1960s, and production totalled 1,190,000. Ford purchased a Mini and dismantled it to see if they could offer an alternative. Ford determined that the BMC must have been losing around £30 per car, so decided to produce a larger car – the Cortina, launched in 1962 – as its competitor in the budget market. BMC insisted that the way company overheads were shared out, the Mini always made money. Larger profits came from the popular De Luxe models and from optional extras such as seat belts, door mirrors, a heater, and a radio, which would be considered necessities on modern cars, as well as the various Cooper and Cooper S models.

The Mini entered into popular culture in the 1960s with well-publicised purchases by film and music stars.

The Cooper S version was also used by some British police forces as both a uniform and plainclothes car.


==Mark II: 1967–1970==

The Mark II Mini was launched at the 1967 British Motor Show, and featured a redesigned grille, a larger rear window and numerous cosmetic changes. A total of 429,000 Mk II Minis were produced.

A variety of Mini types were made in Pamplona, Spain, by the Authi company from 1968 onwards, mostly under the Morris name. In 1969, a fibreglass version of the Mini Mark II was developed for British Leyland&#x27;s Chilean subsidiary (British Leyland Automotores de Chile, S.A., originally the independent assembler EMSSA). The bodyshell mould was created by the Peel Engineering Company. Production began in 1970 and continued for a few years; these fibreglass Minis can be recognised by the missing body seams and by larger panel gaps. The Chilean market was never very large and the Arica plant was closed in 1974. The reason for the fibreglass body was to enable Leyland to meet very strict requirements for local sourcing, increasing to 70.22% in 1971.

==Mark III: 1969–1976==
The Mark III Mini had a modified bodyshell with enough alterations to see the factory code change from ADO15 to ADO20 (which it shared with the Clubman). The most obvious changes were larger doors with concealed hinges. Customer demand led to the sliding windows being replaced with winding windows, although all Australian-manufactured Mark I Minis had adopted this feature in 1965 (with opening quarterlight windows). The suspension reverted from hydrolastic to rubber cones as a cost-saving measure. (The 1275 GT and Clubman retained the hydrolastic system until June 1971, when they, too, switched to the rubber cone suspension of the original Minis.)

In 1969, the simple name Mini completely replaced the separate Austin and Morris brands. In April 1974, a heater became standard equipment on the entry-level Mini 850, as well, having by then already been included in the standard specification of the other models for some time.

In the late 1970s, Innocenti introduced the Innocenti 90 and 120, Bertone-designed hatchbacks based on the Mini platform. Bertone also created a Mini Cooper equivalent, christened the Innocenti De Tomaso, that sported a 1275-cc engine similar to the MG Metro engine, but with an 11-stud head, a special inlet manifold, and used the &quot;A&quot; clutch instead of the &quot;Verto&quot; type. It also used homokinetic shafts instead of rubber couplings.

The Mini was still popular in the UK, but appeared increasingly outdated in the face of newer and more practical rivals. Since the late 1960s, plans had been in place for a newer and more practical supermini to replace it, though the Mini was still the only car of this size built by British Leyland for the home market.

==Mark IV: 1976–1983==
The Mark IV was introduced in 1976, though by this stage British Leyland was working on a new small car which was widely expected to replace the Mini before much longer. It had a front rubber-mounted subframe with single tower bolts and the rear frame had some larger bushings introduced, all intended to improve the car&#x27;s mechanical refinement and to reduce noise levels. Twin column stalks for indicators and wipers were introduced, as were larger foot pedals. From 1977 onwards, the rear light clusters included reversing lights.

In July 1979 the lower end of the Mini range was altered. The basic Mini 850 (which had featured in various forms since the original launch 20 years before) was withdrawn. Its place was taken by two models at slightly lower and slightly higher price points. The new base model was the Mini City, with black-painted bumpers, an untrimmed lower facia rail, part-fabric seats and wing mirror and sun visor only on the driver&#x27;s side, plus unique &#x27;City&#x27; body graphics and boot badge. Above the City was the new 850 SDL (Super Deluxe), which had the same specification as the standard Mini 1000 but with the smaller engine.
For August 1979 the Mini&#x27;s 20th anniversary was marked by the introduction of the first true limited-edition Mini, which was the Mini 1100 Special. This was a 5,000-car run with the 1098cc engine, broadly to the specification already in production for the European market as a standard model with the same name. However this was the first time a UK-market &#x27;round-nose&#x27; (i.e. non-Clubman) Mini had been available with the 1098cc engine, and the UK limited edition was also fitted with unique Exacton alloy wheels – the first time these were fitted to a factory-produced Mini – and plastic wheelarch extensions. Inside was the 1275GT&#x27;s three-dial instrument cluster and a leather-rimmed wheel with a rectangular centre from the Innocenti Mini hatchback.

The 1100 Special and 850 City models were phased out by 1980, and during the same year the engine was upgraded to the improved A-Plus unit from the new Metro in 998cc form, which was now the only engine available in the Mini. This was then followed by a number of incremental developments.

In 1978, the Mini was one of the key cars made available to disabled motorists under the new Motability scheme.

Reports of the Mini&#x27;s imminent demise surfaced again in 1980 with the launch of the Austin Mini-Metro (badging with the word &quot;mini&quot; in all lowercase). Faced with competition from a new wave of modern superminis like the Ford Fiesta, Renault 5, and Volkswagen Polo, the Mini was beginning to fall out of favour in many export markets, with the South African, Australian, and New Zealand markets all stopping production around this time. Buyers of small cars now wanted modern and practical designs, usually with a hatchback. The Metro was therefore in essence, the Mini mechanicals repackaged into a larger hatchback bodyshell.

Although the Mini continued to be produced after the Metro&#x27;s launch, production volumes were reduced as British Leyland and its successor Rover Group concentrated on the Metro as its key supermini. The original Mini&#x27;s last year in the top ten of the UK&#x27;s top selling cars was 1981, as it came ninth and the Metro was fifth. The arrival of the Metro also had production of the larger Allegro pruned back before it was finally discontinued in 1982. In 1982, BL made 56,297 Minis and over 175,000 Metros. Due to their common powertrain package, the Mini received many mechanical upgrades in the early 1980s which were shared with the Metro, such as the A-Plus engine, 12-inch wheels with front disc brakes, improved soundproofing and quieter, stronger transmissions. This not only modernised the Mini but, because many of its major subassemblies were now shared with the Metro, made it very cost-effective to produce despite falling sales volumes.

==Mark V: 1984–1990==

All cars had brake discs and plastic wheel arches (Mini Special arches), but retained the same Mark IV body shell shape.

The Mini&#x27;s 25th anniversary fell in 1984 and British Leyland produced a &#x27;Mini 25&#x27; limited-edition model, both to mark the occasion and to publicise the recent upgrades to the model. This marked the start of a turnaround in the Mini&#x27;s fortunes. Basic models such as the City and the City E (using the economy-tuned drivetrain from the Metro HLE) filled in the bottom of the Austin-Rover range and still found buyers who wanted a compact city car that was easy to park and cheap to run. Low purchase and running costs also made the Mini continually popular as a first car for younger drivers, and Austin-Rover introduced a steady stream of limited editions with bright paint colours, body graphics, and trim to appeal to this market. The Mini was also becoming prized as a characterful and nostalgic car in its own right, and the London Collection of limited-edition models was more upmarket and luxurious and named after affluent or fashionable parts of London.

These marketing strategies proved very successful; Mini production actually had modest increases through the mid-1980s, from 34,974 Minis in 1984 to 35,280 in 1985 and 39,800 in 1986. In 1990, the Mini Cooper was relaunched - 20 years after the demise of the original model - which saw Mini production pass 40,000. Once again, it featured the long-running 1275-cc engine which had featured on the original Mini Cooper S.

In 1988, Austin Rover decided to keep the Mini in production for as long as it was viable to do so, putting an end to reports that it would be discontinued by 1991, by which time the original Metro would also be replaced.

==Mark VI: 1990–1996==
With the larger Metro being redesigned in 1990 to take the new K-Series engine, the Mini became the sole recipient of the classic A-Series engine with transmission-in-sump layout. The engine mounting points were moved forward to take 1275-cc power units, and includes the later Horizontal Integral Float version of the SU carb, and also the single-point fuel-injection version, which came out in November 1991. The 998-cc power units were discontinued. Early, carburetted Coopers had a catalytic converter and produce at 5500 rpm. Power crept up to at 5700 rpm for the fuel injected model. An internal bonnet release was fitted from 1992. By 1991, the Cooper represented forty percent of Mini sales in the home market; the main export market was Japan. Production ended in August 1996 as the Mark VII replaced it.

In the summer of 1991, 21 years after the fibreglass Mini built in Chile was produced, another fibreglass bodied Mini again entered production. This time, it was built in Venezuela and sold as the Mini Cord. The producer, Facorca, intended to sell the car in the Caribbean and Central America, and also had plans for Brazilian assembly.

==Mark VII: 1996–2000==
This was the final version, twin point injection with front-mounted radiator. Full-width dashboard replaces the original shelf, internal bonnet release. Introduction of airbag on driver&#x27;s side. The basic Mini was the 1.3i, the other model in the range being the Mini Cooper. The end of production in October 2000 not only signalled the end of original Mini production after 41 years, but also brought about the demise of the 1275-cc engine which had powered the Mini and numerous other BL/BMC/ARG cars for more than 35 years. The Metro had ceased production two and a half years earlier, meaning the Mini outlived the car that was supposed to replace it.


==Variants==
The popularity of the original Mini spawned many models that targeted different markets.

===Wolseley Hornet and Riley Elf (1961–1969)===
Released in 1961 as more luxurious versions of the Mini, both the Wolseley Hornet and the Riley Elf had longer, slightly finned rear wings and larger boots that gave the cars a more conventional three-box design.
The wheelbase of the Elf and Hornet remained at , whereas the overall length was increased to . This resulted in a dry weight of / (rubber/hydrolastic suspension) for the Elf and / for the Hornet.
Front-end treatment, which incorporated each marque&#x27;s traditional upright grille design (the Hornet&#x27;s grille with a lit &quot;Wolseley&quot; badge), also contributed to a less utilitarian appearance. The cars had larger-diameter chrome hubcaps than the Austin and Morris Minis, and additional chrome accents, bumper overriders and wood-veneer dashboards. The Riley was the more expensive of the two cars. The name &quot;Wolseley Hornet&quot; was first used on 1930s saloon, coupé, sports and racing cars, while the name &quot;Elf&quot; recalled the Riley Sprite and Imp sports cars, also of the 1930s (Riley&#x27;s first choice of name &quot;Imp&quot; could not be used as Hillman had registered it). The full-width dashboard was a differentiator between the Elf and Hornet. This dashboard was the idea of Christopher Milner the Sales Manager for Riley.
Both the Riley Elf&#x27;s and Wolseley Hornet&#x27;s bodies were built at Fisher &amp; Ludlow under their &quot;Fisholow&quot; brandname. Plates in the engine compartment on the right side fitch plate bear evidence of this speciality.
Very early Mark I versions of both cars (e.g. press photo of 445MWL) had no overriders on the bumpers and a single piece front wing (A-panel and wing in one piece, no outside seam below scuttle panel) that was soon given up again, allegedly due to cost. The Elf&#x27;s and Hornet&#x27;s special bumper overriders first appeared in 1962.
Early production Mark I&#x27;s also had a combination of leather and cloth seats (Elf R-A2S1-101 to FR2333, Hornet W-A2S1-101 to FW2105) whereas all later models had full leather seats. Mark I models were equipped with single leading shoe brakes on the front.
In 1966 the Heinz food company commissioned, from Crayford Convertibles (Crayford Engineering), 57 convertible Hornets to be given as prizes in a UK competition. Many are still on the road as of 2020.

Both the Elf and the Hornet went through three engine versions. Initially, they used the engine (engine type 8WR) with a single HS2 carburettor, changing to a single HS2 carburettor version of the Cooper&#x27;s power unit (engine type 9WR) in the Mark II in 1963. This increased the car&#x27;s top speed from . Therefore, Mark II cars also came with increased braking power in the form of front drum brakes with twin leading shoes to cope with the increased power output. Both Mark I and Mark II featured four-speed gearboxes (three synchromesh gears) with the original, long gear lever, a.k.a. &quot;magic wand&quot; type. Automatic gearboxes became available on the Mark II in 1965 as an option. The Mark III facelift of 1966 brought wind-up windows and fresh-air fascia vents. Concealed door hinges were introduced two years before these were seen on the mainstream Mini. The gear selecting mechanism was updated to the &quot;Cooper&quot; type, (which also gave a welcome increase in engine location due to the remote housing extension being directly bolted onto the back of the differential housing) as seen on Mini 1000 cars of the time. The 850s retained the &quot;magic wand&quot;. Automatic gearboxes were available to the Mark III in 1967 again. Full-four synchromesh gearing was eventually introduced during 1968. 30,912 Riley Elfs and 28,455 Wolseley Hornets were built. Production of both models ceased in late 1969.

=== Morris Mini Traveller and Austin Mini Countryman (1960–1969)===
These models were two-door estate cars with double &quot;barn-style&quot; rear doors. Both were built on a slightly longer chassis of compared to for the saloon.

The early Morris Mini Traveller and Austin Mini Countryman cars had an internal fuel tank located on the left hand side of the rear load area. This is identifiable by the fuel filler cap being on the left hand side of the car just below the rear window.
In October 1961 the fuel tank was relocated to the underneath of the car and the filler cap was moved to low down on the right hand side of the car – the same configuration that was already in use on the Mini Van.

From the start of production both models had a decorative, non-structural, ash wood trim on the rear body, in the style of a pre-war shooting-brake. This gave the car a similar appearance to the larger Morris Minor Traveller and gave rise to these cars simply being called a woodie. It is a popular misconception that the difference between the Traveller and the Countryman is the wood trim, or that only wood-fitted models in the Austin and Morris ranges were respectively called Countryman and Traveller, with the plain versions simply being Estates, but neither of these is the case. An all steel version of both the Traveller and the Countryman without the wood trim was launched for export markets in April 1961 and for the home market in October 1962 at a lower cost than the versions with the wood trim. Estate versions of the Mini were then produced in both Austin Countryman and Morris Traveller variants, both available with or without the wooden framing. Some of these models also had front and rear folding seats that folded out flat in order to make a sleeping platform.

In October 1967 the Mk2 version was launched with the same changes as the saloon.

Approximately 108,000 Austin Mini Countrymans and 99,000 Morris Mini Travellers were built. Variations of this model were also built in South Africa, by Innocenti in Italy and by Industria de Montagem de Automoveis in Portugal.

The Mini Traveller and Countryman Register was created in 2009 to help locate and preserve the remaining Mini Traveller and Countryman cars.
===Mini Van (1960–1983)===
The Mini Van was a commercial panel van (in US English, a sedan delivery) rated at ¼-ton load capacity. Built on the longer Traveller chassis but without side windows, it proved popular in the 1960s UK as a cheaper alternative to the car: it was classed as a commercial vehicle and as such carried no sales tax. A set of simple stamped steel slots served in place of a more costly chrome grille. The Mini Van was renamed as the Mini 95 in 1978, the number representing the gross vehicle weight of 0.95 tons. 521,494 were built.

An Estate Van version with rear side windows was built in the late 1970&#x27;s by IMA, the British Leyland factory in Portugal. It comes with a single rear window and single rear door, hinged at the top, that opens upwards for rear access. 
===Mini Moke (1964–1989)===

A utility vehicle intended for the British Army was built with a twin-engined 4-wheel-drive. Although the 4WD Moke could climb a 1:2 gradient, it lacked enough ground clearance for military use. The single-engined front-wheel-drive Moke enjoyed some popularity in civilian production. About 50,000 were made in total, from 1964 to 1968 in the UK, 1966 to 1982 in Australia and 1983 to 1989 in Portugal. The Moke was marketed in holiday locations such as Barbados and Macau, where they were also used as police cars. &quot;Moke&quot; is archaic British slang for a donkey.
===Mini Pick-up (1961–1983)===

A pick-up truck (technically a coupé utility by definition), in total length was built on the longer Mini Van platform, with an open-top rear cargo area and a tailgate. The factory specified the weight of the pick-up as less than with a full tank of fuel.

As with the van, the pick-up had stamped metal slots for airflow into the engine compartment. The Pickup was basic, although the factory brochure described a &quot;fully equipped Mini Pick-up is also available which includes a recirculatory heater&quot;. Passenger-side sun visor, seat belts, laminated windscreen, tilt tubes and cover were also available at extra cost.
Like the van, the pick-up was renamed as the Mini 95 in 1978.

A total of 58,179 Mini pick-up models were built.
===Morris Mini K (March 1969 – August 1971, Australia only)===

Built in the Australian British Motor Corporation factory at Zetland, New South Wales, using 80% local content, the Morris Mini K was advertised as the &quot;great leap forward&quot;. The Mini K (&#x27;K&#x27; standing for Kangaroo) had a 1098 cc engine and was the last round-nosed model to be produced in Australia, originally priced at A$1780. The Mini K was offered in 2-door saloon and 2-door van body styles. It was distinctive in having wind-up windows and a swivelling quarterlight in Mk.I-style externally hinged doors. A small round sticker with a kangaroo logo was placed on the triangular panel between the door and the front body seam. The &quot;Kangaroo&quot; name was supposedly coined because it is claimed that a kangaroo can go all day without drinking which the advertisers used to emphasise the frugal fuel consumption and, possibly, larger fuel tank.
=== Mini Beach (1961–1962) ===

The Mini Beach cars were built by the British Motor Corporation for hotels and high end customers as a promotional tool from 1961 to 1962. Approximately 15 Beach Minis were built out of 20 planned by BMC back in the day, making it among the rarest factory Minis and wildly valuable today. One sold through Bonhams for $181,500 in 2014, and another changed hands on Bring a Trailer in 2019 for the remarkable sum of $230,000. Original Beach Minis were powered by the early Mini&#x27;s 848cc A-series motor. The Mini Beach cars were built by hand in house at Longbridge&#x27;s Experimental Department. They had no doors, no B-pillars, and a spot-welded roof. The seats were similar to a Fiat 500 Jolly and originally made of wicker. An extremely rare booted concept version was made to look more balanced, but few survive today.
== Mini Cooper and Cooper S: 1961–1971; 1990–2000==
Issigonis&#x27; friend John Cooper, owner of the Cooper Car Company and designer and builder of Formula One cars, saw the potential of the Mini for competition. Issigonis was initially reluctant to see the Mini in the role of a performance car, but after John Cooper appealed to BMC management, the two men collaborated to create the Mini Cooper. The Austin Mini Cooper and Morris Mini Cooper debuted in September 1961.

The engine from the Morris Mini-Minor was given a longer stroke to increase capacity to increasing power from . The car featured a race-tuned engine, twin SU carburettors, a closer-ratio gearbox and front disc brakes, uncommon at the time in a small car. One thousand units of this version were commissioned by management, intended for and designed to meet the homologation rules of Group 2 rally racing. The 997 cc engine was replaced by a shorter stroke 998 cc unit in 1964. In 1962, Rhodesian John Love became the first non-British racing driver to win the British Saloon Car Championship driving a Mini Cooper.

A more powerful Mini Cooper, dubbed the &quot;S&quot;, was developed in tandem and released in 1963. Featuring a 1071 cc engine with a 70.61 mm bore and nitrided steel crankshaft and strengthened bottom end to allow further tuning; and larger servo-assisted disc brakes, 4,030 Cooper S cars were produced and sold until the model was updated in August 1964. Cooper also produced two S models specifically for circuit racing in the under 1,000 cc and under 1,300 cc classes respectively, rated at and a , both had a bore and both were also offered to the public. From 1966 onwards Cooper S models featured twin fuel tanks as standard. The smaller-engine model was not well received, and only 963 had been built when the model was discontinued in 1965. The 1,275 cc Cooper S models continued in production until 1971.

Sales of the Mini Cooper were: 64,000 Mark I Coopers with 997 cc or 998 cc engines; 19,000 Mark I Cooper S with 970 cc, 1,071 cc or 1,275 cc engines; 16,000 Mark II Coopers with 998 cc engines; 6,300 Mark II Cooper S with 1,275 cc engines. There were no Mark III Coopers and 1,570 Mark III Cooper S.

An agreement between BMC and Innocenti was announced in 1959 to assemble BMC-manufactured cars for the Italian market. The first Mini Coopers assembled in Milan from imported knock-down kits with sales of the Innocenti Mini Cooper 1300 beginning in March 1966. It was licensed in 1973 to Spain&#x27;s Authi (Automoviles de Turismo Hispano-Ingleses), which began to produce the Authi Mini Cooper 1300. The Cooper name was discontinued from the UK Mini range at this time.

A new Mini Cooper named the RSP (Rover Special Products) was briefly relaunched in 1990–91, with slightly lower performance than the 1960s Cooper. It proved popular and a new Cooper-marked Mini went into full production in late 1991. To meet emission standards, Coopers from 1992 on were fitted with a fuel-injected version of the 1,275 cc engine, and in 1997 a multi-point fuel-injected engine was introduced, along with a front-mounted radiator and various safety improvements. &quot;I love my Mini Cooper,&quot; remarked Madonna in 2003. &quot;I was too scared to drive a big car in London.&quot;


==Mini Clubman and 1275 GT: 1969–1980==
In 1969, under the ownership of British Leyland, the Mini was given a facelift by stylist Roy Haynes, who had previously worked for Ford. The restyled version was called the Mini Clubman, and has a squarer front, protruding some 10 cm / 4in further forward, using the same indicator/sidelight assembly as the Austin Maxi. The Mini Clubman was intended to replace the upmarket Riley and Wolseley versions. At launch all Clubmans were powered by the 998cc engine as already used in the Mini 1000, with 38 bhp. A more sporting model with the 1275cc single-carburettor 59 bhp engine, dubbed the 1275 GT, was slated as the replacement for the 998 cc Mini Cooper (the 1,275 cc Mini Cooper S continued alongside the 1275 GT for two years until 1971). The Clubman Estate replaced the Countryman and Traveller. The original &quot;round-front&quot; design Mini remained in production alongside the Clubman and 1275 GT in 850 and 1000 forms as lower-priced models in the new Mini range.
Production of the Clubman and 1275 GT got off to a slow start because the cars incorporated &quot;lots of production changes&quot; including the relocation of tooling from the manufacturer&#x27;s Cowley plant to the Longbridge plant: very few cars were handed over to customers before the early months of 1970.

Early domestic market Clubmans were still delivered on cross-ply tyres despite the fact that by 1970 radials had become the norm for the car&#x27;s mainstream competitors. By 1973 new Minis were, by default, being shipped with radial tyres, though cross-plies could be specified by special order, giving British buyers a price saving of £8.
The 1275 GT is often incorrectly described as the &quot;Mini Clubman 1275 GT&quot;. The official name was always just the &quot;Mini 1275 GT&quot;, and it was a separate, distinct model from the Clubman (although it shared the same frontal treatment as the Mini Clubman, and was launched at the same time).

In 1971, the 1,275 cc Mini Cooper S was discontinued in the UK, leaving the Mini 1275 GT as the only sporting Mini on sale for the rest of the decade. Innocenti in Italy, however, continued making their own version of the Mini Cooper for some time. While the UK-built 1275 GT was not nearly as quick as a 1275 Mini Cooper S, it was cheaper to buy, run, and insure. It was the first Mini to be equipped with a tachometer. It also featured a standard-fit close-ratio gearbox, and initially had 10-inch (25.4 cm) Rostyle wheels covering the 7.5-inch (19.05 cm) Cooper S type disc brakes, and a boot board; both were dropped in 1974. Performance of the 1275GT was lively for the time, achieving 0– in 12.9 seconds, and the excellent mid-range torque offered a time in top gear of only nine seconds. The bluff front, however, meant that the model struggled to reach .

From 1975 the standard Clubman and Clubman Estate received the 1098cc engine (as also fitted to the Austin Allegro) with 45 bhp, although Clubmans with the AP automatic transmission retained the less powerful 998cc power unit.

Throughout the 1970s, British Leyland continued to produce the classic 1959 &quot;round-front&quot; design, alongside the newer Clubman and 1275 GT models. The long-nose Clubman and 1275 GT offered better crash safety, were better equipped, and had better under-bonnet access, but they were more expensive and aerodynamically inferior to the original 1959 design. The Mini Clubman and 1275 GT were replaced in 1980 by the new hatchback Austin Metro, while production of the original &quot;round-front&quot; Mini design continued for another 20 years. At the end of Clubman and 1275 GT production, 275,583 Clubman saloons, 197,606 Clubman Estates and 110,673 1275 GTs had been made.
===Australia ===

For the Australian market, all Minis including the Van gained the Clubman front in 1971 although the car was still basically a Mk I behind the A-Pillar. The Australian van thus became the only Clubman Van produced anywhere in the world. From mid-1971 to the end of 1972, a Clubman GT version of the saloon was produced. This was essentially a Cooper S in Clubman body, equipped with the same disc brakes, twin fuel tanks, and twin-carburettor Cooper S 1,275 cc engine. Australian Clubman saloons were marketed under the Morris Mini Clubman name when introduced in August 1971, and as the Leyland Mini, without the Clubman name, from February 1973. 

To end Mini production in Australia, a limited-edition runout model was produced – the 1275LS. Fitted with a pollution control 1,275 cc engine sourced from Europe, the LS had a single carburettor and disc brakes. Production of this model commenced in July 1978 and concluded in October 1978 with an approximate total of 810 vehicles produced.
==End of production==
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s the British market received numerous &quot;special editions&quot; of the Mini, which shifted the car from a mass-market item into a fashionable icon. It was this image that perhaps helped the Mini become such an asset for BMW, which later bought the remnants of BMC as the Rover Group. It was even more popular in Japan, which took the lion&#x27;s share of the circa 40,000 Minis produced annually in the early 1990s. It was seen there as a retro-cool icon, and inspired many imitators. The ERA Mini Turbo was particularly popular with Japanese buyers.

In 1994, under Bernd Pischetsrieder, a first cousin once removed of Issigonis, BMW took control of the Rover Group, which included the Mini, fitting an airbag to comply with European legislation.
By March 2000, Rover was still suffering massive losses, and BMW decided to dispose of most of the companies. The sell-off was completed in May that year. MG and Rover went to Phoenix, a new British consortium; and Land Rover was sold to Ford Motor Company. BMW retained the Mini name and the planned new model, granting Rover temporary rights to the brand and allowing it to manufacture and sell the run-out model of the old Mini. By April 2000, the range consisted of four versions: the Mini Classic Seven, the Mini Classic Cooper, the Mini Classic Cooper Sport and—for overseas European markets—the Mini Knightsbridge. The last Mini (a red Cooper Sport) was built on 4 October 2000 and presented to the British Motor Industry Heritage Trust in December of that year. A total of 5,387,862 cars had been manufactured, nearly 1.6 million of which were sold in the UK, although the majority of these were sold at least 20 years before the Mini&#x27;s demise, meaning that the majority of those sold had been scrapped before the end of the original Mini&#x27;s production life.

After the last of the Mini production had been sold, the &#x27;Mini&#x27; name passed to BMW ownership. Mini Hatch, the new model made by BMW, is technically unrelated to the old car but retains the classic transverse four-cylinder, front-wheel-drive configuration and &quot;bulldog&quot; stance of the original.

The last Mini to leave the Longbridge plant did so in 2012, when a 1970s 1275GT which was used by staff to travel around the car plant was recovered from the disused tunnels under the plant. The car was damaged by a storage container falling on it and had been left without an engine or gearbox for around 30 years before being recovered during work to infill the tunnels. This car was sold at auction in July 2013 for £1400.

==Limited editions==

From the Mark IV onward, many special limited-production editions of the Mini were offered. These included models that were created to commemorate racing victories or to celebrate an anniversary of the Mini marque. Limited editions generally came equipped with a unique combination of interior and exterior trim and special decals. Examples include Mini 1100 Special, Mini 1000 Special HL (only available in silver colour with black vinyl roof, black cloth upholstery seats with head restraints and walnut interior trim, for Portugal market only), Mini Rio, Mini Mayfair, Mini Park Lane, Mini Cooper RSP, Mini Flame, Mini Red Hot, Mini Jet Black, Mini Racing, Mini Thirty (30) which 3000 examples were produced, 2000 in Red and 1000 in Black and the Mini Monza. There was also a version inspired by &quot;The Italian Job&quot;, a 1969 film famous for having a trio of Minis in its epic closing car chase.

==Concepts and unproduced prototypes==

From 1967 to 1979, Issigonis had been designing a replacement for the Mini in the form of an experimental model called the 9X. It was even shorter () and yet still a bit roomier. Designed as a hatchback, and Issigonis designed an all new engine, 50% more powerful than the Mini&#x27;s, but due to politicking inside British Leyland (which had now been formed by the merger of BMC&#x27;s parent company British Motor Holdings and the Leyland Motor Corporation), the car always fell victim to other priorities.

A number of prototypes produced for vehicles based on the Mini but which never saw production are held and sometimes displayed at the British Heritage Motor Centre museum at Gaydon, Warwickshire. These included the Twini, a re-engineered four-wheel-drive Moke with two engines—one at the front and another at the back; the Austin Ant, a second attempt to produce a four-wheel-drive vehicle, this time using a transfer case; and a two-seater convertible MG edition of the Mini known as ADO34, cancelled due to it being perceived as competition for the MG Midget.

In 1992, a project considering possible improvements to the Mini was started. Codenamed &quot;Minki&quot; (&quot;Mini&quot; plus K-Series engine), it included a redesigned dashboard, a two-piece rear door or tailgate instead of a boot, fold down rear seats, Hydragas suspension and a 3-cylinder version of the K-Series engine with a 5-speed gearbox. However, the project was cancelled by management within Rover, who decided that the cost of engineering the changes, and achieving compliance with modern crash testing standards, was too great for the production volumes that could be expected of an updated Mini.

In 1995 the idea to update the Mini again surfaced but this time with BMW management. As part of the process of deciding how to replace the Mini, a vehicle representing what the current Mini could have become, if it had been developed further over its production history, was commissioned. This resulted in the &quot;Minki-II&quot;, designed to house the 1.4L MPI K-Series engine with an extensive redesign inside, but without the original Minki&#x27;s tailgate. The car had to be widened by 50mm and lengthened by 50mm to accommodate the new engine and gearbox, with Hydragas suspension and dashboard from a Rover 100. The Minki-II was used for Hydragas development work, this suspension being considered at the time for the R59 project, later to become the Mini Hatch.

==Kit cars and customisation==
The cheapness and availability of used Minis make it a candidate for body replacement. There are over 120 Mini-based kit cars from various small companies and individual enthusiasts.

The Outspan Orange is probably one of the most unusual. It was designed and built by Brian Waite Enterprises of Bodiam, East Sussex in 1972 to promote fruit. Several still survive.

==Motorsport==
BMC operated a Competition Department at Abingdon, Oxfordshire, under the control of Stuart Turner, which built specially prepared Minis (mostly based on Cooper and Cooper S versions) to compete in international rallies and other motorsport. This department played a key role in ensuring the Mini&#x27;s huge success in motorsport throughout the 1960s, in particular, winning the Monte Carlo Rally in 1964, 1965 and 1967, the 1000 Lakes Rally in 1965, 1966 and 1967, and dominating all of the first 9 positions in the 1966 Gallaher 500 at Bathurst.

The car also won the 1961, 1962, 1969, 1978 and 1979 British Saloon Car Championship season, as well as the British Rally Championship in 1962, 1963 and 1970, the European Rally Championship in 1965 and 1966, and won the Finnish Rally Championship in 1965 and 1966. Minis also won the 1965 Lowood 4 Hour endurance race, and the final Finnish Grand Prix in 1963. The Cooper S also had some success in the European Touring Car Championship, winning in 1964 and 1968, the Guia Race of Macau (a 1-2-3 finish in 1965, a 1–2 finish in 1970 and a win in 1972), and the Australian Touring Car Championship, winning its class in 1962, 1963, 1964, 1966, 1967 and 1968. A further title was the 1971 Sun-7 Chesterfield Series. The Mini also achieved class wins at the 1963 Armstrong 500, repeating this feat every year until 1969, and having class wins at the 1964, 1965 and 1971 Sandown 250, and Six Hour Le Mans in 1963, 1964, 1965, 1966, 1967, 1968, 1969, 1970 and 1972, as well as the 1971 Phillip Island 500K. The car also won the Welsh Sports and Saloon Car Championship in 1998. Mini Leyland came 4th place in the under-2-litre category in the 1966, 1967 and 1969 Trans-Am seasons, improving to 3rd in 1970.

The Mini Cooper S won the Monte Carlo Rally in 1964, 1965 and 1967. Minis initially placed first, second and third in the 1966 rally as well, but were disqualified after a controversial decision by the judges. The disqualification related to the use of a variable resistance headlamp dimming circuit in place of a dual-filament lamp. Fourth placed Roger Clark&#x27;s Ford Cortina was disqualified for the same reason, along with six other cars. The fifth car past the finishing line, a Citroën DS, a model that had won the race previously, was awarded first place – the DS had similar headlamps, but these were standard production equipment on the car – in line with the letter of the rules. The driver of the Citroën, Pauli Toivonen, felt that he had not really &quot;won&quot; the rally. BMC probably received more publicity from the disqualification than they would have gained from a victory.


In rallycross, the Mini finished on the podium in the first ever race, at Lydden Hill Race Circuit in February 1967, winning races in the FIA European Rallycross Championship in 1974 and 1975. The car competed as late as the 1979 Australian Rallycross Championship.

&quot;The Se7ens&quot; is the UK&#x27;s longest running one make motor racing championship, having been introduced in 1966. As of 2014, classic Minis are still raced, with other one make races in the UK, Europe and Asia, and in classic events such as the Goodwood Members Meeting. In 2012 a Mini broke the land speed record. A Mini was used to set a record at the Chateau Impney Hill Climb.

==Awards==
BMC and Issigonis were awarded the Dewar Trophy by the Royal Automobile Club (RAC) for the innovative design and production of the Mini.

The Mini has won many other awards over the years, including second place in 1999&#x27;s &quot;Global&quot; Car of the Century award, behind only the Model T Ford. In the same competition, run by the prestigious Global Automotive Elections Foundation, the Mini was selected &quot;European Car of the Century&quot;. &quot;Grassroots Motorsports&quot; awarded Mini with the Editors&#x27; Choice award in 2002. The Mini also received awards for &quot;Car of the Century&quot; (&quot;Autocar&quot; magazine 1995) and &quot;Number One Classic Car of All Time&quot; (&quot;Classic &amp; Sports Car&quot; magazine 1996).

In the end 5.3 million Minis were sold, making it the most popular British car ever made.

==Sales==

At its peak, the Mini was a strong seller in most of the countries where it was sold, with the United Kingdom inevitably receiving the highest volumes. The 1,000,000th Mini came off the production line in 1965, with the 2,000,000th in 1969. The 3,000,000th Mini came off the production line in 1972, with the 4,000,000th in 1976.

It dominated the mini-car market until the arrival of the Hillman Imp in 1963. It outsold the Imp. Competition arrived with the more modern and practical Vauxhall Chevette of 1975, but the Mini continued to sell well until its &quot;replacement&quot;—the Metro—arrived in 1980. By this time, the Mini&#x27;s design had been overtaken by numerous more modern and practical vehicles.

Although the Metro did not replace the Mini, production figures for the Mini dipped during the 1980s, and interest in the design was not revived until the reintroduction of the Mini Cooper in 1990. This helped sales of the Mini through the 1990s, to the end of production on 4 October 2000.

A total of 1,581,887 Minis were sold in the UK after its launch in 1959. The last new one to be registered was sold in 2004, some four years after the end of production.

The highest price ever paid for a Mini was at a Bonhams auction in 2007, when a works rally-prepared Mini (DJB 93B) sold for £100,500 ($196,980).

===United States and Canada===
Between 1960 and 1967, BMC exported approximately 10,000 left-hand drive BMC Minis to the United States. Sales were discontinued when stricter federal safety standards were imposed in 1968 and the arrival of the larger and more profitable Austin America. Mini sales fell in the 1967 calendar year and the US importer was expecting the forthcoming Austin America to find a larger market. The America was also withdrawn in 1972 due to slow sales and the introduction of bumper-height standards. Mini sales continued in Canada until 1980. MkIII variants, as with their UK counterparts remained badged as a &quot;Mini&quot; (no distinction between Austin or Morris), and in 1976 with the takeover of British Leyland, became British Leyland Minis (MkIV). Leyland Minis also were subject to stricter government regulation with high bumpers, large turn indicators, warning buzzers and lights for seat belts and also a fitting of air pollution pumps which required a specially designed radiator.

Today the US government exempts cars older than 25 years from all import laws, so older Minis can be freely imported. The Canadian government applies a similar rule after 15 years.

==Safety record==

Issigonis designed the Mini with an emphasis on active safety. Asked about the crashworthiness of the Mini, he said: &quot;I make my cars with such good brakes, such good steering, that if people get into a crash it&#x27;s their own fault&quot; and &quot;I don&#x27;t design my cars to have accidents&quot;.

In July 1965 BMC announced that following &quot;comments by safety experts&quot; about the Mini&#x27;s external door handles, these would be modified on new cars so that the gap between the handle and the door panel would be effectively closed.

Nicholas Faith states in his book that Murray Mackay, one of the UK&#x27;s leading motor vehicle crash and safety researchers, was critical of the pre-1967 Mini&#x27;s passive safety features, including the protruding filler cap, the door latch, and the vulnerability of the passenger space to engine intrusion.

The Mini was withdrawn from the American market because it could not meet the 1968 US safety regulations and emission standards, and although often updated, not sufficiently to comply with US regulations. It continued to be sold in Canada until 1980.

The Mini was modified during its production to improve its safety. In 1974 a prototype Mini experimental safety vehicle was built, the Mini Clubman SRV4. It featured a longer crumple zone, a &quot;pedestrian friendly&quot; front-end, run-flat tyres, strengthened door sills, extra internal padding and recessed door handles, the latter having been used earlier on Australian-built Minis owing to local laws. Jack Daniels, one of the original Issigonis team, is stated to have been working on further safety improvements for the Mini when he retired in 1977. Several times it was thought that safety regulations would stop Mini production. Safety improved in 1996, with the introduction of airbags and side-impact bars. The Mini, challenged by increasingly demanding European safety and pollution standards, was planned by British Aerospace to be taken out of production in 1996, but BMW chose to invest to keep the Mini legal until the launch of a new model.

In January 2007 &quot;Which?&quot; magazine listed the Mini City in its &quot;Ten worst cars for safety (since 1983)&quot; list, alongside other economical, lightweight, fuel-efficient cars like the Hyundai Pony 1.2L, Fiat Panda 900 Super, Suzuki Alto GL, Daihatsu Domino, Citroën AX 11 RE, Yugo 45 and 55, Peugeot 205 GL, and the Citroën 2CV6.

A UK Department for Transport statistics publication, presenting estimates of the risk of driver injury in two-car injury collisions, based on reported road accident data, estimated that the 1990–2000 Mini was one of two small cars (the other being the Hyundai Atoz), which, with an estimated 84% of drivers likely to be injured, presented the greatest risk of driver injury; the average risk for the small car category was 76%.

==50th anniversary==
Several key events marked the 50th anniversary of the Mini in 2009. On 13 January 2009, the Royal Mail released a limited edition of stamps entitled &quot;British Design Classics&quot;, featuring an original, egg-shell blue, MK1 Mini, registration XAA 274. On 17 May, a world record parade of 1,450 Minis congregated at Crystal Palace as part of a London to Brighton run. The following week, 10,000 Minis and 25,000 people attended an anniversary party at Silverstone Circuit on the border of Buckinghamshire and Northamptonshire.

Between 7 and 10 August 2009 approximately 4000 minis from around the world congregated at Longbridge Birmingham to celebrate the 50th anniversary. On 26 August 2009, smallcarBIGCITY launched in London to provide sightseeing tours of the capital in a fleet of restored Mini Coopers.

== In popular culture==
In the British sitcom &quot;Mr. Bean&quot;, the eponymous title character drives a citron green 1977 British Leyland Mini 1000 Mark 4 with a matte black bonnet. In the pilot episode, he drives an orange 1969 BMC Morris Mini 1000 Mark 2.

<text>The Volkswagen Beetle, officially the Volkswagen Type 1, is a small family car produced by the German company Volkswagen from 1938 to 2003. One of the most iconic cars in automotive history, the Beetle is noted for its distinctive shape. Its production period of 65 years is the longest of any single generation of automobile, and its total production of over 21.5 million is the most of any car of a single platform.

The Beetle was conceived in the early 1930s. The leader of Nazi Germany, Adolf Hitler, decided there was a need for a &quot;people&#x27;s car&quot;—an inexpensive, simple, mass-produced car—to serve Germany&#x27;s new road network, the &quot;Reichsautobahn&quot;. The German engineer Ferdinand Porsche and his design team began developing and designing the car in the early 1930s, but the fundamental design concept can be attributed to Béla Barényi in 1925, predating Porsche&#x27;s claims by almost ten years. The result was the Volkswagen Type 1 and the introduction of the Volkswagen brand. Volkswagen initially slated production for the late 1930s, but the outbreak of war in 1939 meant that production was delayed until the war had ended. The car was originally called the Volkswagen Type 1 and marketed simply as the Volkswagen. It was not until 1968 that it was officially named the &quot;Beetle&quot;.

Volkswagen implemented designations for the Beetle in the 1960s, including 1200, 1300, 1500, 1600, 1302, and 1303. Volkswagen introduced a series of large luxury models throughout the 1960s and 1970s—comprising the Type 3, Type 4 and the K70—to supplement the Beetle, but none of these models achieved the level of success that it did. Rapidly changing consumer preferences toward front-wheel drive compact hatchbacks in Europe prompted Volkswagen&#x27;s gradual shift away from rear-wheel drive, starting with the Golf in 1974. In the late 1970s and &#x27;80s, Japanese automakers began to dominate the market, which contributed to the Beetle&#x27;s declining popularity.

Over its lifespan, the Beetle&#x27;s design remained consistent, yet Volkswagen implemented over 78,000 incremental updates. These modifications were often subtle, involving minor alterations to its exterior, interior, colours, and lighting. Some more noteworthy changes included the introduction of new engines, models and systems, such as improved technology or comfort.

== History ==
=== KdF-Wagen ===
In May 1934, at a meeting at Berlin&#x27;s Kaiserhof Hotel, the leader of Nazi Germany, Adolf Hitler, insisted on the development of a vehicle that could accommodate two adults and three children while not using more than sevenlitres of fuel per 100 km (33.6 mpg US/40.4 mpg UK). All components were designed for a quick and inexpensive part exchange. As Hitler explained, the reason for choosing an air-cooled engine was the lack of a garage for every country doctor. On 22 June 1934, Ferdinand Porsche received a development contract from the &quot;Verband der Automobilindustrie&quot; (German Association of the Automotive Industry) for the prototype of an inexpensive and economical passenger car after Hitler decided there was a need for a &quot;people&#x27;s car&quot;—a car affordable and practical enough for lower-class people to own—to serve the country&#x27;s new road network, the &quot;Reichsautobahn&quot;. Although the Volkswagen Beetle was primarily the conception of Porsche and Hitler, the idea of a &quot;people&#x27;s car&quot; is much older than Nazism and has existed since the introduction of automotive mass-production.

Originally designated as the Type 60 by Porsche, the Beetle project involved a team of designers and engineers comprising Erwin Komenda, who specialised in the bodywork; Josef Kales, responsible for the engine design; Karl Rabe, serving as the chief engineer; and Josef Mickl and Franz Xaver Reimspiess, the latter credited for devising the iconic Volkswagen badge. The project saw significant milestones in October 1935 with the completion of the first two Type-60 prototypes, identified as cars V1 (sedan) and V2 (convertible), denoted with a &quot;V&quot; (for &quot;Versuchs&quot; – &quot;prototype&quot;) signifying their status as a test car. The testing of three additional V3 prototypes began on 11 July 1936, the first of which was driven to Obersalzberg and inspected by Hitler. Two V3s were delivered to Berlin in August for examination by other Nazi Party officials, who showed great interest in them. By June 1936, the V3s underwent over of testing across various terrains. A series of thirty W30 development models, commissioned by Porsche and manufactured by Daimler-Benz, underwent testing in early April 1937, covering a total distance of over . All vehicles featured the characteristic rounded design and included air-cooled, rear-mounted engines. A further batch of 44 &quot;VW38&quot; pre-production cars produced in 1938 introduced split rear windows, and subsequently, Volkswagen introduced fifty &quot;VW39&quot; cars, completed in July 1939.

&quot;Kraft durch Freude&quot; (Strength Through Joy, a political organisation aimed at providing the populace with leisure activities) was in charge of this project. Robert Ley, the Nazi official heading &quot;Kraft durch Freude&quot; (KdF), announced in 1938 that every German would own a Volkswagen within ten years. However, there were challenges. Gasoline prices in Germany were high due to taxes, making it expensive for private car ownership. Gasoline was also primarily used for the military in the Nazi regime. Despite that, the Nazi leaders saw the mass-produced car as a way to promote their system. It symbolised a shift from cars being a privilege for the wealthy to a dream that lower-class Germans could now fulfil. Hitler was particularly enthusiastic about it because the car could easily be adapted for military use.

The &quot;KdF-Wagen&quot; was not series-produced before the Second World War because the Volkswagen plant at Fallersleben (now Wolfsburg), founded in May 1938, was not yet finished. During the war, other German manufacturers were concurrently producing military vehicles and armaments, so the series production of the then-called Volkswagen car could not begin until peacetime; nevertheless, 210 &quot;KdF-Wagens&quot; were manufactured by the end of the war in May 1945. Following the cessation of hostilities the British occupying forces brought the factory into operation and by the close of 1945, 1,785 Volkswagens had been built, delivered to the occupying powers and the postal service.

=== Design ===
The Beetle featured a rear-located, air-cooled four-cylinder, boxer engine and rear-wheel drive in a two-door bodywork featuring a flat front windscreen, accommodating four passengers and providing luggage storage under the front bonnet and behind the rear seat, it had a drag coefficient of 0.48. The bodywork attached with eighteen bolts to the Beetle&#x27;s nearly flat platform chassis featured a central structural tunnel. The front and rear suspension incorporated torsion bars and a front stabiliser bar, providing independent suspension at all wheels, albeit the front axle was designed with double longitudinal trailing arms, whereas the rear axle was a swing axle. Light alloy forms the Beetle&#x27;s engine, transmission, and cylinder heads.

German-Bohemian Ferdinand Porsche (1875–1951) and his team were generally known as the original designers of the Volkswagen. However, there has been debate over whether he was the original designer. Rumours circulated, suggesting that other designers, such as Béla Barényi, Paul Jaray, Josef Ganz and Hans Ledwinka, may have influenced its design.

;Béla Barényi
In 1925, Austro-Hungarian automotive engineer Béla Barényi designed a car similarly shaped to the Beetle, more than five years before Porsche unveiled his initial &quot;People&#x27;s Car&quot; design. Through a court ruling in 1953, Barényi successfully asserted his authorship and associated claims. He explained that he had previously elucidated the concept of the Beetle, which was already formulated in the 1920s, to Porsche in great detail. However, this concept was not protected sufficiently by patents. Key elements of this concept included the air-cooled four-cylinder boxer engine at the rear, the transmission positioned in front of the rear axle, and the distinctive roundish shape. Dieter Landenberger, the head of Porsche&#x27;s historical archive, later affirmed that Barényi played a &quot;decisive role in the authorship of the later VW Beetle&quot;. Since then, he has been known for conceiving the original car design.

;Paul Jaray
Many assume that Paul Jaray shaped the car&#x27;s body design through his aerodynamics calculations. According to a November 2021 update of research mentioned in the fifteenth report by the German newspaper &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot;, Jaray&#x27;s findings influenced the design of &quot;Hitler&#x27;s streamlined KdF car&quot;, later known as the &#x27;beetle&#x27;, which became the best-selling car globally post-war. Jaray&#x27;s research results in fluid mechanics for ground-bound vehicles extended beyond the VW Beetle, impacting the Tatra 77 and other vehicles. His initial patents and publications date back to the early 1920s. The engineer Christian Binnebesel scientifically presented Jaray&#x27;s significant contribution to streamline form in his 2008 dissertation.

;Josef Ganz
Josef Ganz&#x27;s potential early contributions to the original Beetle&#x27;s development remained controversial for years and lacked clear clarification. Research suggests that his idea and the concept of a compact car played a significant role in the VW Beetle&#x27;s development and its prototypes. Ganz personally drove a Hanomag Kommissbrot and a swing-axle Tatra—both featuring elements such as a central tubular frame, independent wheel suspension, and a rear/mid-engine design. Ganz incorporated these technical features into his proposed vehicle designs. Hitler reportedly saw cars designed by Josef Ganz at the 1933 Berlin Auto Show. The Standard Superior, designed by Ganz for the Standard vehicle factory, featured an implied teardrop-shaped body on a central tubular frame with a rear swing axle, yet the engine was transversely installed in front of the axle, not longitudinally as a rear engine.

;Hans Ledwinka
The Austrian automobile designer Hans Ledwinka, whom Porsche was a contemporary, worked at the Czechoslovakian company Tatra. In 1931, Tatra built the V570 prototype, which featured an air-cooled flat-twin engine mounted at the rear. Hitler and Porsche both were influenced by the Tatras. Hitler, an avid automotive enthusiast, rode in Tatras multiple times during political tours of Czechoslovakia and had frequent dinners with Ledwinka. Following one such tour, Hitler remarked to Porsche, &quot;This is the car for my roads&quot;. From 1933 onwards, Ledwinka and Porsche met regularly to discuss their designs, and Porsche admitted, &quot;Well, sometimes I looked over his shoulder, and sometimes he looked over mine&quot; while designing the Volkswagen. The Tatra 97 of 1936 had a 1,749 cc, rear-located, rear-wheel drive, air-cooled four-cylinder boxer engine. It accommodated five passengers in its compact four-door body, which provided luggage storage under the front bonnet and behind the rear seats.

Just before the outbreak of World War II, Tatra filed numerous legal claims against VW for patent infringement. Tatra launched a lawsuit, halted only by Germany&#x27;s invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1938, leading to the Nazi administration of the Tatra factory in October. Hitler instructed Tatra to focus exclusively on heavy trucks and diesel engines, discontinuing all car models except the V8-engined Tatra 87. The issue resurfaced post-World War II, and in 1965, Volkswagen paid Ringhoffer-Tatra 1,000,000 Deutsche Marks in an out-of-court settlement.

=== World War II and military production: 1938–1945 ===

The name &quot;Volkswagen&quot; was officially substituted by the term KdF (&quot;Kraft durch Freude&quot;; German for &#x27;Strength Through Joy&#x27;) derived from the Nazi organisation once Hitler ceremoniously laid the foundation stone for the Volkswagen factory on 26 May 1938. As part of this organisation, Volkswagen urged workers to &quot;save five marks a week and get your car&quot;. Before the completion of the KdF factory, many Germans had already signed up for a savings plan to buy a car. At that time, Germany had fewer cars than other European countries. In 1930, there were only about 500,000 registered cars in Germany, while France and Great Britain had over 1 million each, and the USA had more than 26 million. However, the onset of the Second World War hindered the distribution of the cars, and there was a lack of time for series production. With the Volkswagen facility dedicated solely to wartime requirements, the over 330,000 KdF savers could not acquire their vehicles. Following the war, numerous KdF savers pressed for the receipt of a Volkswagen. When their request was denied, the VW saver initiative ensued, spanning several years.

During the war, the factory predominantly built the &quot;Kübelwagen&quot; (Type 82), the &quot;Schwimmwagen&quot; (Type 166) and numerous other light utility vehicles. These vehicles were derived mechanically from the Type 1 and used by the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;. These vehicles, including several hundred &quot;Kommandeurswagen&quot; (Type 87), featured a Type 1 Beetle body mounted on the robust chassis of the four-wheel-drive Type 86 &quot;Kübelwagen&quot; prototype. The &quot;Kommandeurswagen&quot; included a portal axle, a &quot;Schwimmwagen&quot; drivetrain, wider fenders, and oversized Kronprinz all-terrain tyres, reminiscent of the later Baja Bugs. The production of the &quot;Kommandeurswagen&quot; persisted until 1944 when the production at the plant halted due to the extensive damage inflicted by the Allied air raids. Due to gasoline shortages late in the war, a few &quot;Holzbrenner&quot; (wood-burner) Beetles were built fueled with wood logs.

Planned for September 1939, &quot;Kraft durch Freude&quot; arranged an event to showcase Germany&#x27;s Autobahn highway system and to promote the purported beginning of the production of the &quot;KdF-Wagen&quot;, involving a 1,500-kilometre(930mi) journey from Berlin to Rome. Erwin Komenda supervised the development process, while Karl Froelich was responsible for creating official plans that they subsequently used to form a wooden scale model. The model was wind tunnel tested at Stuttgart University by Josef Mickl. Dubbed the &quot;Berlin-Rome car&quot;, Porsche AG&#x27;s engineers designed the Type 60 K 10, officially known as the Porsche 64. Although the engineers produced three vehicles, they never made it to the race due to the outbreak of war before the scheduled date; two of them disappeared during the conflict. Austrian Otto Mathé acquired the third Berlin-Rome car and raced it throughout the 1950s, becoming the fastest in its class during the 1950 Alpine Cup. He continued to use it until his death in 1995.
=== Post-war production and success: 1945–1970 ===

Following the war, the Beetle experienced a significant growth in success. On 11 April 1945, Fallersleben, where 17,000 people lived, was officially designated &quot;Wolfsburg&quot;. Official series manufacture of the saloon began on 27 December 1945; Volkswagen made fifty-five vehicles by the end of the year. The Volkswagen facility, initially slated for dismantling and transportation to Britain under American control in 1945, faced a lack of interest from British car manufacturers; an official report included the phrase, &quot;The vehicle does not meet the fundamental technical requirement of a motor-car [...] it is quite unattractive to the average buyer [...] To build the car commercially would be a completely uneconomic enterprise.&quot; Instead, the factory remained operational by producing cars for the British Army. Allied dismantling policy changed from late 1946 to mid-1947. During this period, heavy industry in Germany continued until 1951. In March 1947, Herbert Hoover helped change policy by stating:

Major Ivan Hirst (1916–2000), a British Army officer, has been widely acknowledged for the reopening of the factory. Hirst was ordered to take control of the heavily bombed factory, which the Americans had captured. Recognising the scarcity of occupations in Germany and the shortage of vehicles in the British Army, Hirst persuaded the British military to order 20,000 cars, stating that it &quot;was the limit set by the availability of materials&quot;. By March 1946, production capacity was rated at approximately 1,000 units per month. Based on an eight-hour shift in mid-1946, production was around 2,500 per month. At the time, about 1,800 machine tools were in operation, of which 200 were used exclusively for the key components.

Once Heinrich Nordhoff assumed management at Volkswagenwerk, manufacturing capacity increased significantly. Production in 1946 and 1947 was rated at 9,878 and 8,973 examples, respectively, but in Nordhoff&#x27;s first year, 1948, manufacture doubled to approximately 19,244 units. On 6 August 1955, the millionth example was assembled and by 1959, production capacity was rated at 700,000 units per year. By mid-1948, the Forces of Occupation received 20,991 cars, leaving less than 10,000 for export or domestic consumption. The number of employees increased from 6,033 by the end of 1945 to almost 57,000 in 1957. After the war, over 10,000 apartments were built to house the workers in Wolfsburg, which then had a population of nearly 60,000. In 1959, Volkswagen invested more than DM500million to increase daily production by 1,000, reaching a final target of 3,000 per day. During 1960, the company occasionally increased production by around 100; by the end of 1960, Volkswagen planned to produce 4,000 examples daily. Nordhoff stated, &quot;Then we believe we shall have reached a balance between supply and demand so that we can finally deliver Volkswagens to customers without a waiting period&quot;.

By the early 1960s, the Wolfsburg facility was massive. It accommodated about 10,000 production machines and covered in roofed area, more than the combined residential area in Wolfsburg. Daily production increased to approximately 5,091, and the plant employed over 43,500 workers. By 1962, Nordhoff had spent over DM675million in expanding the factory. At that time, Volkswagen sales constituted 34.5percent of the total West German automotive market and 42.3percent of sub- commercial vehicle market there. Nordhoff&#x27;s recurring encouragement proved to be highly effective. He consistently urged the team to work harder, reduce expenses and avoid complacency and corporate inefficiencies. In January 1960, Nordhoff quoted:

The Emden facility represented an expenditure exceeding DM154.4million, with Beetle operations beginning there on 1 December 1964. By late 1965, Volkswagen&#x27;s annual production exceeded 1,600,000 units, averaging 6,800 units per day. Volkswagen&#x27;s share of all cars produced in West Germany reached 48.6 percent, representing a 3.3% increase from the previous year. When including Audis produced at Ingolstadt, the combined output from Volkswagen and its Auto-Union company constituted 50.4% of all West German cars produced that year. In 1968, the Type 1 was officially given the name &quot;Beetle&quot; (from &quot;der Käfer&quot;, German for beetle).

=== Decline and end of West German production: 1970–1990 ===

While it was largely successful in the 1960s, recording its highest sales growth in North America from 1960 to 1965, the Beetle started facing competition from more contemporary designs worldwide in the 1970s. The decade started out well for Volkswagen, which sold 569,000 Beetles in 1970. In 1970, fifteen Volkswagen dealerships in Washington convened to implement the Volkswagen American Dealers Association, which was made to preserve a free market of imported international automobiles through political pressure and lobbying. On 17 February 1972, the world car production record was broken by the Beetle, with a total of 15,007,034 units produced worldwide, thereby surpassing the production figure that had been held by the American Ford Model T for nearly fifty years. Volkswagen donated the car to the Smithsonian Institution for permanent exhibition in its industrial history section. By 1973, over 16million Beetles had been manufactured. On 1 July 1974, the final Beetle was produced at the Wolfsburg plant after 11,916,519 examples were made there. Following its discontinuation, Volkswagen ceased the ongoing development of the Beetle in Germany. On 19 January 1978, the last Beetle sedan manufactured in Europe rolled off the production line at the Emden plant with the chassis number 1182034030. After its discontinuation in Germany, production of the Volkswagen Beetle continued in Australia, Mexico and Nigeria.

In the 1960s and &#x27;70s, Volkswagen augmented its product portfolio with several models to supplement the Type 1—the Type 3, the Type 4 and the NSU-based K70 sedan. None of these models achieved the level of success of the Beetle. The overdependence on a singular model, which was experiencing a decline in popularity, meant that Volkswagen was in a financial crisis and needed German government funding to produce the Beetle&#x27;s replacement. Consequently, the company introduced a new generation of water-cooled, front-engined, front-wheel-drive models, including the Golf, the Passat, the Polo and the Scirocco, all of which were styled by the Italian automotive designer Giorgetto Giugiaro. By 1979, the Golf constituted over 50 per cent of Volkswagen sales, and it eventually became Volkswagen&#x27;s most successful model since the Beetle. As opposed to the Beetle, the Golf was substantially redesigned over its lifetime, with only a few components carried over between generations. On 10 January 1980, the final Beetle convertible of 330,281 rolled off the production line at the Karmann facility in Osnabrück. It was the most successful convertible for a long time and was replaced by the first Golf cabriolet in 1979.

The number of Beetle units sold by Volkswagen was at its lowest in the 1980s. The Beetle faced competition from Japanese automakers such as Toyota and Honda, whose cars were uprated in reliability and performance. The closure of Volkswagen&#x27;s Pennsylvania factory was due to high costs, subpar quality, and poor sales. In the United States, Volkswagen introduced the Rabbit and Corrado, both of which had little success. The overall sales suffered a significant downturn, leading to the loss of many dealerships for the company.

=== New Beetle and end of production: 1990–2003 ===
In 1991, the planning of a new car began once J Mays and Freeman Thomas returned to California to open Volkswagen&#x27;s Design Centre at Simi Valley. Recognising that Japanese manufacturers dominated the market in the 1970s and &#x27;80s, Volkswagen needed to introduce a vehicle to regain popularity. Before this, the company began the development of a city car, codenamed &quot;Chico&quot;, in which they invested millions of Deutsche Marks. In 1993, the brand stated that the Chico was intended to begin production in 1995. However, this plan was abandoned once Volkswagen realised that the project was commercially infeasible. Mays and Thomas recognised the difficulties faced by the brand and suggested the need for a vehicle that included the recognisable design of the Beetle as a potential solution to improve customer appeal. During development, this car was known as the &quot;Concept One&quot; project. The prototype version of the project was revealed at the 1994 Detroit Motor Show, and a red convertible variant of the model was showcased at the 1995 Geneva Motor Show.

It took a year for Volkswagen to officially confirm the production of the concept in its final form, which was slated for completion by the end of the century. To help gauge public demand of the forthcoming automobile in the United States, Volkswagen implemented a free-access telephone line to allow members to express their thoughts on the car. The line quickly became inundated with calls, with many saying, &quot;You build it, I&#x27;ll buy it!&quot; Work on the Concept One continued, with further redesigns on its front fascia. To reduce production investments and expenses, Volkswagen initially planned to use the platform of the Polo. However, in 1995, at the Tokyo Motor Show, the company unveiled another prototype, sharing its wheelbase and its broader range of engine options with the Golf. Simultaneously, Volkswagen announced that it would be named the &quot;New Beetle&quot;. After over six years of planning and development, Volkswagen introduced the New Beetle in 1997.

On 30 July 2003 at 9:05 a.m., at the Puebla plant in Mexico, Volkswagen produced the final Type 1, after 21,529,464 examples were produced globally during its tenure. Its production span of 65 years is the longest of any single generation of automobile, and its total production of over 21.5million is the most of any car of a single platform. To celebrate the occasion, Volkswagen marketed a series of 3,000 Beetles as &quot;Última Edición&quot; (Final Edition).

== Models and history of design ==
While the design of the Beetle changed little over its lifespan, Volkswagen implemented over 78,000 incremental updates. Typically subtle, these alterations usually involved minor updates to the exterior, interior, colours and lighting. More noteworthy changes have comprised new engines, models and systems, such as updated dashboards and hydraulic braking.

=== Initial and successful models: 1946–1974 ===
The Type 11 standard limousine, initially designated as the Type 60 before 1946, received the dub &quot;Pretzel Beetle&quot; due to its distinctive oval-shaped, vertically divided rear window. On 1 July 1949, the Volkswagen lineup was expanded to include the &quot;export&quot; model featuring enhanced interiors, chrome bumpers, and trim. It was offered in a variety of colours to distinguish it from the preceding &quot;Standard&quot; model. Starting in 1950, an optional sunroof with a textile cover could be added at an extra cost. By March of the same year, the export model began to be equipped with a hydraulic brake system, which became a standard feature from April onwards. In 1952, the equipment was enhanced with the addition of vent windows in the doors, and the wheels were reduced to a diameter of from the previous . On 10 March 1953, the split rear window was replaced with a one-piece rear window. Starting in 1954, the Type 122 engine had a cylinder bore, increased by , and an engine displacement of , surpassing the previous . This engine produced , a improvement over its predecessor. In 1955, the traditional VW semaphore turn signals were replaced by conventional flashing directional indicator lamps for North America, followed by their worldwide replacement in 1961. In 1958, the Beetle received a revised instrument panel, and a larger rectangular rear window replaced the previous oval design.
In 1960, Volkswagen introduced a series of technical alterations. The front indicators were relocated to the front bonnet within chrome housings, and the rear indicators were integrated into the tail lamps. In January, the valve-clearing adjusting nut was slightly enlarged and resistor-type ignition leads were adopted. In March, Volkswagen made several modifications to its front trailing arm and the steering damper. In May 1960, Volkswagen added plastic warm air ducts to decrease noise.

In the mid-1960s, the traditional labels &quot;standard&quot; and &quot;export&quot; for the Beetle&#x27;s model variants were superseded by numerical designations, approximately correlating with the engine displacements. In the October 1961 issue of &quot;Motor Trend&quot;, Don Werner noted, &quot;Five years ago, out of every ten imported cars sold, six were Volkswagens. [The] latest figures show the ratio is now down to about every four [Volkswagens] out of every ten. If the current VW starts to slip, the new [Type 3]—soon to be introduced—probably will be imported to justify the [company&#x27;s] more than 600 [Volkswagen] dealerships and the $100million investment in facilities&quot;. He continued by expressing that the Type 3 had failed to leave a positive impression on industry executives in both Europe and North America. The new engine essentially possessed identical specifications to the previous model; it was a horizontally opposed, overhead valve, four-cylinder air-cooled engine. It generated at 3,900rpm and produced at 2,000rpm.

The 1961 Beetle introduced a fully-synchronised four-speed manual transmission, replacing the former non-synchronised first gear. The Volkswagen facility implemented 27 alterations to the new model, some of which were minor. Noteworthy changes comprised an automatic choke, an anti-icing carburettor heater, a redesigned fuel tank that increased boot capacity, an external gas tank vent to prevent odours in the car, standard windshield wipers and a new ignition switch. Stylistic improvements included new paint colours and interior design options, a coloured steering wheel, a speedometer. On 30 July 1962, Volkswagen made several updates for the 1963 model year, including the incorporation of an air filter into the oil filter, the introduction of larger-diameter cylinder head induction ports and the adoption of plastic for the headliner and window guides. Volkswagen replaced the Wolfsburg crest on the hood, which had been present since 1951, with the company&#x27;s lettering. A heating system was also introduced. In 1965, the 1200A designation was introduced for the standard Beetle with the engine.

Volkswagen introduced the 1300 in August 1965, equipped with a 1.3-litre engine producing . Although featuring an identical design, the increase was achieved through the adoption of the crankshaft from the Type 3. This extended the stroke from to , resulting in an engine displacement of . 1965 also marked the Beetle&#x27;s most extensive design change when its body stampings were extensively revised. It allowed for significantly larger windows, a departure from previous designs. The windshield increased by 11% in area and adopted a slight curvature, replacing its flat configuration. Door windows also expanded by 6%, with a slight backward canting of door vent window edges. Rear side windows increased by 17.5%, and the rear window by 19.5%.

In 1967, updates comprised shortened front and rear bonnets, box-profile bumpers with a railway rails design that were installed at a higher position, vertically oriented scattering discs for the headlights and larger rear lights with an iron design. Volkswagen introduced an external fuel filler flap, eliminating the need to open the front bonnet for refuelling. In September 1967, the 1500 Beetle was introduced. Its engine displacement was approximately , its power output was and featured a three-speed semi-automatic transmission. In 1968, the 1200 received fully independent suspension, some stylistic improvements and an external fuel cap. The 1300 transitioned from six-volt to twelve-volt electrics and received dual circuit braking and a fuel gauge. The 1500 also received these alterations, as well as carburettor enhancements. In 1969, the 1200 received twelve-volt electrics, hazard warning lamps and a locking fuel cap. The 1300 was available with a semi-automatic transmission and radial-ply tyres. In 1970, the 1500 received a new carburettor and dual circuit braking, and Volkswagen discontinued the 1500.

In 1971, the 1200 received a larger windscreen, while the 1300 received a power increase to and larger brakes, effectively replacing the 1500. Volkswagen replaced the 1300 with the 1300A &quot;economy version&quot; in 1973 for the 1974 model year, possessing the same specifications as the 1300 but maintaining the same overall design as the 1200.
=== Mid-life and declining models: 1970–1986 ===
The VW 1302, introduced in August 1970, featured a redesigned front end. It incorporated a new front axle featuring MacPherson suspension struts, wishbones and a stabiliser. The enlargement of the front trunk became possible as a result. Unlike its predecessor, the spare wheel was no longer positioned diagonally at the front under the hood but instead rested horizontally under a cover in the trunk area. The company initially intended to designate the car as the &quot;1301&quot;, but a trademark already held by the French company Simca compelled Volkswagen to use &quot;1302&quot; instead. Volkswagen produced the more powerful 1302S alongside the 1302. The latter has an engine displacement of , while the former has a capacity of . In English-speaking countries, the name &quot;Super Beetle&quot;—alongside &quot;1600&quot;—was included on the written description but not the engine cover.

The 1302 possessed the same output as the 1300, whereas the 1302S saw an increase to . This was facilitated by a twin-port cylinder head, enabling the engines to breathe more effortlessly. The British automotive magazine &quot;Autocar&quot; expressed disappointment in its power increase, noting, &quot;Even with 14 [percent] more power, the total output of 50bhp is very modest for the size of the engine&quot;. The Super Beetle had a increase in wheelbase, but the extra space was in front of the windshield. For 1971, the overall length increased by , doubling the front trunk capacity and adding of luggage space. Volkswagen also implemented a new fresh-air ventilation system, drawing its air from the rear quarter panels.

In August 1972, the 1303 range superseded the 1302 model, which featured a curved windshield. This design change elicited mixed opinions; some favoured it, while others expressed dissatisfaction. Despite the effort to infuse the Beetle with a modernised design, this did not resonate with consumers, resulting in declining Beetle sales. In 1975, the 1303 and 1303S received rack and pinion steering, but in July of that year, Volkswagen discontinued both of them. The long-serving 1200 was renamed the &quot;1200L&quot; in 1976, with the additional deluxe features incorporated into the car&#x27;s interior. In July 1984, Volkswagen eliminated the engine lid louvres.

=== Final models: 1986–2003 ===
Starting in 1986, for the 1987 model year, the sole model available was the single-carburettor version with . From late 1992 for the 1993 model year, Volkswagen standardised catalytic converters, the Bosch Digifant engine management system, a lambda probe and electric ignition. This fuel-injection system proved much more straightforward and reliable than previous injection systems used on German-assembled Volkswagens since 1967. Vehicles with these modifications can be identified externally by the reintroduced louvred engine lid, heavier and larger bumper bars, four-stud wheels with twenty ventilation holes and a &quot;1600i&quot; badge on the engine lid. The 1993 model also featured a third-generation Golf-style steering wheel and front seats, a protection alarm, handbrake and engine compartment lamps and an optional ZF limited-slip differential. The engine received hydraulic tappets, a full-flow oil filter, a 6.6:1 compression ratio—allowing for the use of unleaded fuel—and an electric fuel pump. A standard version was also released in 1993, featuring painted bumper bars and many minor removals.

From 1997, front disc brakes and an immobiliser became available, and the De Luxe model featured small traffic indicator side lamps ahead of the top door hinge. The steering wheel&#x27;s centre boss was restyled to resemble that of the contemporary Golf and Polo. In 1998, Volkswagen removed the small through-flow ventilation slots behind the rear side windows and standardised front disc brakes. Furthermore, Volkswagen included a security alarm as standard and removed the &quot;1600i&quot; inscription from the engine lid.

== Markets and assembly ==
Over its 65-year tenure, Volkswagen produced the Volkswagen Type 1 in numerous locations worldwide. The following list encompasses all the locations in which it was manufactured.

=== Specific markets ===
==== Brazil ====
Official exportation of the Beetle to the Brazilian market began on 23 March 1953, with its parts imported from Germany. For the local market, the Type 1 was officially known &quot;Volkswagen Fusca&quot;. In January 1959, Volkswagen shifted assembly to the new São Bernardo do Campo plant, initially maintaining 60percent of its German parts. However, by the mid-1960s, the cars had about 99.93percent Brazilian-made components. Production persisted until 1986, after over 3.3million examples were produced there, and resumed in 1992, extending until 1996.

==== Mexico ====

The production of the Beetle was possible through agreements with companies like Chrysler in Mexico and the Studebaker-Packard Corporation, which assembled cars imported in complete knock-down form. The Beetle was introduced to the Mexican market in 1954, and began official production ten years later. The local market referred to the Beetle as the &quot;Vocho&quot;. The introduction of a new taxi regulation in Mexico City, requiring only four-door vehicles to be permitted to prevent robberies, influenced Volkswagen&#x27;s decision to the end of the production of the Beetle in 2003.

==== Australia ====
Formal introduction of the Volkswagen Beetle to the Australian market took place in 1953, followed by local assembly operations at the Clayton, Victoria facility in the subsequent year. The establishment of Volkswagen Australia Ltd took place in 1957, and by 1960, locally manufactured body panels were integrated for the first time. Despite the introduction of larger windows for the European Type One body in 1965, Volkswagen Australia opted to maintain production of the smaller-windowed bodies with features tailored for Australian models. This decision was influenced by the constraints of the market size and the expenses associated with retooling. By this juncture, Australian content had surged to nearly 95percent. The final Australian-assembled Beetle rolled off the production line in July 1976.

== Retrofit program ==
Volkswagen entered into partnership with eClassics, enabling Beetle owners to electrify their vehicles. The electric conversion kit includes a battery with a capacity of 36.8 kWh, providing an estimated range of . The converted Beetle can achieve a top speed of , and an hour of charging can store sufficient energy for a journey exceeding .

<text>A science-fiction fanzine is an amateur or semi-professional magazine published by members of science-fiction fandom, from the 1930s to the present day. They were one of the earliest forms of fanzine, within one of which the term &quot;fanzine&quot; was coined, and at one time constituted the primary type of science-fictional fannish activity (&quot;fanac&quot;).

==Origins and history==

The first science-fiction fanzine, &quot;The Comet&quot;, was published in 1930 by the Science Correspondence Club in Chicago. The term &quot;fanzine&quot; was coined by Russ Chauvenet in the October 1940 issue of his fanzine &quot;Detours&quot;. &quot;Fanzines&quot; were distinguished from &quot;prozines&quot;, that is, all professional magazines. Prior to that, the fan publications were known as &quot;fanmags&quot; or &quot;letterzines&quot;.

Traditionally, science-fiction fanzines were (and many still are) available for &quot;the usual&quot;, meaning that a sample issue will be mailed on request; to receive further issues, a reader sends a &quot;letter of comment&quot; (LoC) about the fanzine to the editor. The LoC might be published in the next issue: some fanzines consisted almost exclusively of letter columns, where discussions were conducted in much the same way as they are in internet newsgroups and mailing lists, though at a relatively slow pace.

Since 1955, the annual Worldcon has awarded Hugo Awards for Best Fanzine; awards for Best Fan Writer and Best Fan Artist were added in 1967 and have continued since then.

==Semiprozines==

During the 1970s and 1980s, some fanzines—especially sercon (serious and constructive) zines devoted to science fiction and fantasy criticism, and newszines such as &quot;Locus&quot;—became more professional journals, produced by desktop publishing programs and offset printing. These new magazines were labeled &quot;semiprozines&quot;, and were eventually sold rather than traded, and paid their contributors. Some semiprozines publish original fiction. The Hugo Awards recognized semiprozines as a separate category from fanzines in 1984 after &quot;Locus&quot; won the award for best fanzine several years running (See Hugo Award for Best Semiprozine). Well-known semiprozines include &quot;Locus&quot;, &quot;Ansible&quot;, &quot;The New York Review of Science Fiction&quot;, and &quot;Interzone&quot;.

==APAs==

Amateur press associations (APAs) publish fanzines made up of the contributions of the individual members collected into an assemblage or bundle called an apazine.

The first science-fiction APA was the Fantasy Amateur Press Association (FAPA) formed by a group of science-fiction fans in 1937. Some APAs are still active as hardcopy publications, and some are published as virtual &quot;e-zines&quot;, distributed on the internet.

==Other types of fanzines==

The term &quot;fanzine&quot; is also used to refer to fan-created magazines concerning other topics: the earliest rock-and-roll fanzines were edited by science-fiction fans. A significant part of modern computer/Web/Internet slang, abbreviations, etc. is derived from the jargon of the fanzine fans. See fanzine, fanspeak.

The fanzine movement is now well represented on the Web; see webzine.

== Conventions ==
Fanzine readers and producers naturally gather at science fiction conventions, but there are also small conventions dedicated to fanzines. The first fanzine-only annual convention was Autoclave, held by a Detroit-based fan group for several years in the 1970s. In 1984, the first Corflu was held in Berkeley, California. A second convention, Ditto, started in Toronto in 1988. Both of these conventions continue to take place each year.

<doc id="65689" wikidata="Q293455" url="?curid=65689" title="Óscar Romero">
<text>Óscar Arnulfo Romero y Galdámez (15 August 1917 – 24 March 1980) was a prelate of the Catholic Church in El Salvador. He served as Auxiliary Bishop of the Archdiocese of San Salvador, the Titular Bishop of Tambeae, as Bishop of Santiago de María, and finally as the fourth Archbishop of San Salvador. As archbishop, Romero spoke out against social injustice and violence amid the escalating conflict between the military government and left-wing insurgents that led to the Salvadoran Civil War. In 1980, Romero was shot by an assassin while celebrating Mass. Though no one was ever convicted for the crime, investigations by the UN-created Truth Commission for El Salvador concluded that Major Roberto D&#x27;Aubuisson, a death squad leader and later founder of the right-wing Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA) political party, had ordered the killing.

In 1997, Pope John Paul II bestowed upon Romero the title of Servant of God, and a cause for his beatification was opened by the church. The cause stalled but was reopened by Pope Benedict XVI in 2012. Romero was declared a martyr by Pope Francis on 3 February 2015, paving the way for his beatification on 23 May 2015. During Romero&#x27;s beatification, Pope Francis declared that his &quot;ministry was distinguished by his particular attention to the most poor and marginalized.&quot; Pope Francis canonized Romero on 14 October 2018.

Seen as a social conservative at the time of his appointment as archbishop in 1977, Romero was deeply affected by the murder of his friend and fellow priest Rutilio Grande and thereafter became an outspoken critic of the military government of El Salvador. Hailed by supporters of liberation theology, Romero, according to his biographer, &quot;was not interested in liberation theology&quot; but faithfully adhered to Catholic teachings on liberation and a preferential option for the poor, desiring a social revolution based on interior reform. Up to the end of his life, his spiritual life drew much from the spirituality of Opus Dei.

In 2010, the United Nations General Assembly proclaimed 24 March as the &quot;International Day for the Right to the Truth Concerning Gross Human Rights Violations and for the Dignity of Victims&quot; in recognition of Romero&#x27;s role in defence of human rights. Romero actively denounced violations of the human rights of the most vulnerable people and defended the principles of protecting lives, promoting human dignity and opposing all forms of violence. Archbishop José Luis Escobar Alas, one of Romero&#x27;s successors as Archbishop of San Salvador, asked Pope Francis to proclaim Romero a Doctor of the Church, which is an acknowledgement from the church that his religious teachings were orthodox and had a significant impact on its philosophy and theology.

Latin American church groups often proclaim Romero an unofficial patron saint of the Americas and El Salvador; Catholics in El Salvador often refer to him as &quot;San Romero&quot;, as well as &quot;Monseñor Romero&quot;. Outside of Catholicism, Romero is honoured by other Christian denominations, including the Church of England and Anglican Communion, through the Calendar in Common Worship, as well as in at least one Lutheran liturgical calendar. Romero is also one of the ten 20th-century martyrs depicted in statues above the Great West Door of Westminster Abbey in London.

==Early life==

Óscar Romero was born on 15 August 1917 to Santos Romero and Guadalupe de Jesús Galdámez in Ciudad Barrios in the San Miguel department of El Salvador. On 11 May 1919, at the age of one, Romero was baptized into the Catholic Church by the priest Cecilio Morales.

Romero entered the local public school, which offered only grades one through three. When finished with public school, Romero was privately tutored by a teacher, Anita Iglesias, until the age of thirteen. During this time Romero&#x27;s father trained him in carpentry. Romero showed exceptional proficiency as an apprentice. His father wanted to offer his son the skill of a trade, because in El Salvador studies seldom led to employment, however, Romero broached the idea of studying for the priesthood, which did not surprise those who knew him.

==Priesthood==
Romero entered the minor seminary in San Miguel at the age of thirteen. He left the seminary for three months to return home when his mother became ill after the birth of her eighth child; during this time he worked with two of his brothers in a gold mine near Ciudad Barrios. After graduation, he enrolled in the national seminary in San Salvador. He completed his studies at the Gregorian University in Rome, where he received a Licentiate in Theology &quot;cum laude&quot; in 1941, but had to wait a year to be ordained because he was younger than the required age. He was ordained in Rome on 4 April 1942. His family could not attend his ordination because of travel restrictions due to World War II. Romero remained in Italy to obtain a doctoral degree in theology, specializing in ascetical theology and Christian perfection according to Luis de la Puente. Before finishing, in 1943 at the age of 26, he was summoned back home from Italy by his bishop. He traveled home with a good friend, Father Valladares, who was also doing doctoral work in Rome. On the route home, they made stops in Spain and Cuba, where they were detained by the Cuban police, likely for having come from Fascist Italy, and were placed in a series of internment camps. After several months in prison, Valladares became sick and Redemptorist priests helped to have the two transferred to a hospital. From the hospital they were released from Cuban custody and sailed on to Mexico, then traveled overland to El Salvador.

Romero was first assigned to serve as a parish priest in Anamorós, but then moved to San Miguel where he worked for over 20 years. He promoted various apostolic groups, started an Alcoholics Anonymous group, helped in the construction of San Miguel&#x27;s cathedral, and supported devotion to Our Lady of Peace. He was later appointed rector of the inter-diocesan seminary in San Salvador. Emotionally and physically exhausted by his work in San Miguel, Romero took a retreat in January 1966 where he visited a priest for confession and a psychiatrist. He was diagnosed by the psychiatrist as having obsessive-compulsive personality disorder and by priests with scrupulosity.

In 1966, he was chosen to be Secretary of the Bishops Conference for El Salvador. He also became the director of the archdiocesan newspaper &quot;Orientación&quot;, which became fairly conservative while he was editor, defending the traditional Magisterium of the Catholic Church.

==Bishop and Archbishop==
On 25 April 1970, Romero was appointed an auxiliary bishop for the Archdiocese of San Salvador and as the titular bishop of Tambeae. He was consecrated on 21 June by Girolamo Prigione, titular Archbishop of Lauriacum. On 15 October 1974, he was appointed Bishop of the Diocese of Santiago de María, a poor, rural region.

On 3 February 1977, Romero was appointed Archbishop of San Salvador, assuming the position on 22 February. While this appointment was welcomed by the government, many priests were disappointed, especially those openly supportive of Marxist ideology. The progressive priests feared that his conservative reputation would negatively affect liberation theology&#x27;s commitment to the poor.

On 12 March 1977, Rutilio Grande, a Jesuit priest and personal friend of Romero who had been creating self-reliance groups among the poor, was assassinated. His death had a profound impact on Romero, who later stated: &quot;When I looked at Rutilio lying there dead I thought, &#x27;If they have killed him for doing what he did, then I too have to walk the same path.&#x27;&quot; Romero urged the government to investigate, but they ignored his request. Furthermore, the censored press remained silent.

Tension was noted by the closure of schools and the lack of Catholic priests invited to participate in government. In response to Grande&#x27;s murder, Romero revealed an activism that had not been evident earlier, speaking out against poverty, social injustice, assassinations and torture.

On 15 October 1979, the Revolutionary Government Junta (JRG) came to power amidst a wave of human rights abuses by paramilitary right-wing groups and the government, in an escalation of violence that would become the Salvadoran Civil War. Romero criticized the United States for giving military aid to the new government and wrote an open letter to President Jimmy Carter in February 1980, warning that increased US military aid would &quot;undoubtedly sharpen the injustice and the political repression inflicted on the organized people, whose struggle has often been for their most basic human rights.&quot; This letter was then sent, via telegram, from the U.S. embassy in El Salvador to Washington D.C. Carter did not directly respond to the letter; instead, Cyrus Vance, the Secretary of State, wrote a telegram back to the U.S. embassy. The telegram carried a very contradictory message, both stating that the United States will not interfere but will respond to the Revolutionary Government Junta&#x27;s requests. It is unknown if Archbishop Romero received the telegram.

On 11 May 1979, Romero met with Pope John Paul II and unsuccessfully attempted to obtain a Vatican condemnation of the Salvadoran military regime for committing human rights violations and its support of death squads, and expressed his frustration in working with clergy who cooperated with the government. He was encouraged by Pope John Paul II to maintain episcopal unity as a top priority.

As a result of his humanitarian efforts, Romero began to be noticed internationally. In February 1980, he was given an honorary doctorate by the Catholic University of Louvain.

===Statements on persecution of the church===
Romero denounced the persecution of members of the Catholic Church who had worked on behalf of the poor:

===Popular radio sermons===
By the time of his death, Romero had gained an enormous following among Salvadorans. He did this largely through broadcasting his weekly sermons across El Salvador on the church&#x27;s station, YSAX, &quot;except when it was bombed off the air.&quot; In these sermons, he listed disappearances, tortures, murders, and much more each Sunday. This was followed by an hour-long speech on the radio the following day. On the importance of these broadcasts, one writer noted that &quot;the archbishop&#x27;s Sunday sermon was the main source in El Salvador about what was happening. It was estimated to have the largest listenership of any programme in the country.&quot; According to listener surveys, 73% of the rural population and 47% of the urban listened regularly. Similarly, his diocesan weekly paper &quot;Orientación&quot; carried lists of cases of torture and repression every week.

==Theology==
According to Jesús Delgado, his biographer and postulator of the cause for his canonization, Romero agreed with the Catholic vision of liberation theology and not with the materialist vision: &quot;A journalist once asked him: &#x27;Do you agree with Liberation Theology&#x27; And Romero answered: &quot;Yes, of course. However, there are two theologies of liberation. One is that which sees liberation only as material liberation. The other is that of Paul VI. I am with Paul VI.&quot; Delgado said that Romero did not read the books on liberation theology which he received, and he gave the lowest priority to liberation theology among the topics that he studied.

Romero preached that &quot;the most profound social revolution is the serious, supernatural, interior reform of a Christian.&quot; He also emphasized: &quot;The liberation of Christ and of His Church is not reduced to the dimension of a purely temporal project. It does not reduce its objectives to an anthropocentric perspective: to a material well-being or only to initiatives of a political or social, economic or cultural order. Much less can it be a liberation that supports or is supported by violence.&quot; Romero expressed several times his disapproval of divisiveness in the church. In a sermon preached on 11 November 1979 he said: &quot;the other day, one of the persons who proclaims liberation in a political sense was asked: &#x27;For you, what is the meaning of the Church&#x27;?&quot; He said that the activist &quot;answered with these scandalous words: &#x27;There are two churches, the church of the rich and the church of the poor. We believe in the church of the poor but not in the church of the rich.&#x27;&quot; Romero declared, &quot;Clearly these words are a form of demagogy and I will never admit a division of the Church.&quot; He added, &quot;There is only one Church, the Church that Christ preached, the Church to which we should give our whole hearts. There is only one Church, a Church that adores the living God and knows how to give relative value to the goods of this earth.&quot;

===Spiritual life===

Romero noted in his diary on 4 February 1943: &quot;In recent days the Lord has inspired in me a great desire for holiness. I have been thinking of how far a soul can ascend if it lets itself be possessed entirely by God.&quot; Commenting on this passage, James R. Brockman, Romero&#x27;s biographer and author of &quot;Romero: A Life&quot;, said that &quot;All the evidence available indicates that he continued on his quest for holiness until the end of his life. But he also matured in that quest.&quot;

According to Brockman, Romero&#x27;s spiritual journey had some of these characteristics:

* love for the Church of Rome, shown by his episcopal motto, &quot;to be of one mind with the Church,&quot; a phrase he took from St. Ignatius&#x27; &quot;Spiritual Exercises&quot;;
* a tendency to make a very deep examination of conscience;
* an emphasis on sincere piety;
* mortification and penance through his duties;
* providing protection for his chastity;
* spiritual direction;
* &quot;being one with the Church incarnated in this people which stands in need of liberation&quot;;
* eagerness for contemplative prayer and finding God in others;
* fidelity to the will of God;
* self-offering to Jesus Christ.

Romero was a strong advocate of the spiritual charism of Opus Dei. He received weekly spiritual direction from a priest of the Opus Dei movement. In 1975 he wrote in support of the cause of canonization of Opus Dei&#x27;s founder, &quot;Personally, I owe deep gratitude to the priests involved with the Work, to whom I have entrusted with much satisfaction the spiritual direction of my own life and that of other priests.&quot;

==Assassination==
On 23 March 1980, Archbishop Romero delivered a sermon in which he called on Salvadoran soldiers, as Christians, to obey God&#x27;s higher order and to stop carrying out the government&#x27;s repression and violations of basic human rights.

Romero spent 24 March in a recollection organized by Opus Dei, a monthly gathering of priest friends led by Fernando Sáenz Lacalle. On that day they reflected on the priesthood. That evening, Romero celebrated Mass at a small chapel at Hospital de la Divina Providencia (Divine Providence Hospital), a church-run hospital specializing in oncology and care for the terminally ill. Romero finished his sermon, stepped away from the lectern, and took a few steps to stand at the center of the altar.

As Romero finished speaking, a red car came to a stop on the street in front of the chapel. A gunman emerged from the vehicle, stepped to the door of the chapel, and fired one, or possibly two, shots. Romero was struck in the heart, and the vehicle sped off. He died at the Chapel of Hospital de la Divina Providencia in San Salvador.

=== Funeral ===
Romero was buried in the Metropolitan Cathedral of San Salvador. The Funeral Mass on 30 March 1980 in San Salvador was attended by more than 250,000 mourners from all over the world. Viewing this attendance as a protest, Jesuit priest John Dear has said, &quot;Romero&#x27;s funeral was the largest demonstration in Salvadoran history, some say in the history of Latin America.&quot;

At the funeral, Cardinal Ernesto Corripio y Ahumada, speaking as the personal delegate of Pope John Paul II, eulogized Romero as a &quot;beloved, peacemaking man of God,&quot; and stated that &quot;his blood will give fruit to brotherhood, love and peace.&quot;

==== Massacre at Romero&#x27;s funeral ====
During the ceremony, smoke bombs exploded on the streets near the cathedral and subsequently, there were rifle shots that came from surrounding buildings, including the National Palace. Many people were killed by gunfire and in the stampede of people running away from the explosions and gunfire. Official sources reported 31 overall casualties, while journalists claimed that between 30 and 50 died. Some witnesses claimed it was government security forces who threw bombs into the crowd, and army sharpshooters, dressed as civilians, who fired into the chaos from the balcony or roof of the National Palace. However, there are contradictory accounts about the course of the events and one historian, Roberto Morozzo della Rocca, stated that &quot;probably, one will never know the truth about the interrupted funeral.&quot;

As the gunfire continued, Romero&#x27;s body was buried in a crypt beneath the sanctuary. Even after the burial, people continued to line up to pay homage to the assassinated prelate.

===International reaction===
====Ireland====
All sections of Irish political and religious life condemned his assassination, with the Minister for Foreign Affairs Brian Lenihan &quot;expressing shock and revulsion at the murder of Dr Romero&quot;, while the leader of the Trócaire charity, Bishop Eamon Casey, revealed that he had received a letter from Romero that very day. The previous October, parliamentarians had given their support to the nomination of Romero for the Nobel Peace Prize. In March each year since the 1980s, the Irish–El Salvador Support Committee holds a mass in honour of Romero.

====United Kingdom====
In October 1978, 119 British parliamentarians had nominated Romero for the Nobel Prize for Peace. In this they were supported by 26 members of the United States Congress. When news of the assassination was reported in March 1980, the new Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie, was about to be enthroned in Canterbury Cathedral. On hearing of Romero&#x27;s death, one writer observed that Runcie &quot;departed from the ancient traditions to decry the murder of Archbishop Óscar Romero in El Salvador.&quot;

====United States====
===== Public reaction =====
The United States public&#x27;s reaction to Archbishop Romero&#x27;s death was symbolized through the &quot;martyrdom of Romero&quot; as an inspiration to end US military aid to El Salvador. In December 1980 the International Longshoremen&#x27;s and Warehousemen&#x27;s Union refused to deliver military equipment destined for the Salvadoran government. The leader of the union, Jim Herman, was known as a supporter of Romero and denounced his death. On 24 March 1984 a protest was held in Los Angeles, California where around 3,000 people, organized by 20 November Coalition, protested US intervention in El Salvador, using the anniversary of the Archbishop&#x27;s death and his face as a symbol. On 24 March 1990, 10,000 people marched in front of the White House to denounce the military aid that was still flowing from the United States to the Salvadoran government. Protestors carried a bust of the archbishop and quoted some of his speeches, in addition to the event being held on the anniversary of his death. Noted figures Ed Asner and Jennifer Casolo participated in the event.

===== Government response =====
On 25 March 1980, US Secretary of State Cyrus Vance revealed that the White House would continue to fund the Salvadoran government and provide it military aid, in spite of the pleas of Romero and his death immediately prior to this announcement. On 31 March 1983, Roberto D&#x27;Aubuisson was allowed entry to the United States by the State Department after deeming him not barred from entry any longer. When asked about D&#x27;Aubuisson&#x27;s association with the assassination of Romero, the Department of State responded that &quot;the allegations have not been substantiated.&quot; In November 1993, documents by the Department of State, Department of Defense, and the Central Intelligence Agency were released after pressure by Congress increased. The 12,000 documents revealed that the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush knew of the assassinations conducted by D&#x27;Aubuisson, including that of Romero, yet still worked with him despite this.

=== Investigations into the assassination ===
No one has ever been prosecuted for the assassination or confessed to it to police. Immediately following the assassination, José Napoleón Duarte, the newly appointed foreign minister of El Salvador, actively promulgated a &quot;blame on both sides&quot; propaganda trope in order to provide cover for the lack of official inquiry into the assassination plot.

Subsequent investigations by the United Nations and other international bodies have established that the four assassins were members of a death squad led by D&#x27;Aubuisson. Revelations of the D&#x27;Aubuisson plot came to light in 1984 when US ambassador Robert White testified before the United States Congress that &quot;there was sufficient evidence&quot; to convict D&#x27;Aubuisson of planning and ordering Romero&#x27;s assassination. In 1993, an official United Nations report identified D&#x27;Aubuisson as the man who ordered the killing. D&#x27;Aubuisson had strong connections to the Nicaraguan National Guard and to its offshoot the Fifteenth of September Legion and had also planned to overthrow the government in a coup. Later, he founded the political party Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA) and organized death squads that systematically carried out politically motivated assassinations and other human rights abuses in El Salvador. Álvaro Rafael Saravia, a former captain in the Salvadoran Air Force, was chief of security for D&#x27;Aubuisson and an active member of these death squads. In 2003 a United States human rights organization, the Center for Justice and Accountability, filed a civil action against Saravia. In 2004, he was found liable by a US District Court under the Alien Tort Claims Act (ATCA) (28 U.S.C. § 1350) for aiding, conspiring, and participating in the assassination of Romero. Saravia was ordered to pay $10 million for extrajudicial killing and crimes against humanity pursuant to the ATCA; he has since gone into hiding. On 24 March 2010–the thirtieth anniversary of Romero&#x27;s death–Salvadoran President Mauricio Funes offered an official state apology for Romero&#x27;s assassination. Speaking before Romero&#x27;s family, representatives of the Catholic Church, diplomats, and government officials, Funes said those involved in the assassination &quot;unfortunately acted with the protection, collaboration, or participation of state agents.&quot;

A 2000 article by Tom Gibb, then a correspondent with &quot;The Guardian&quot; and later with the BBC, attributes the murder to a detective of the Salvadoran National Police named Óscar Pérez Linares, acting on the orders of D&#x27;Aubuisson. The article cites an anonymous former death squad member who claimed he had been assigned to guard a house in San Salvador used by a unit of three counter-guerrilla operatives directed by D&#x27;Aubuisson. The guard, whom Gibb identified as &quot;Jorge,&quot; purported to have witnessed Linares fraternizing with the group, which was nicknamed the &quot;Little Angels,&quot; and to have heard them praise Linares for the killing. The article furthermore attributes full knowledge of the assassination to the CIA as far back as 1983. The article reports that both Linares and the Little Angels commander, who Jorge identified as &quot;El Negro Mario,&quot; were killed by a CIA-trained Salvadoran special police unit in 1986; the unit had been assigned to investigate the murders. In 1983, U.S. Lt. Col. Oliver North, an aide to then-Vice President George H.W. Bush, is alleged to have personally requested the Salvadoran military to &quot;remove&quot; Linares and several others from their service. Three years later they were pursued and extrajudicially killed – Linares after being found in neighbouring Guatemala. The article cites another source in the Salvadoran military as saying &quot;they knew far too much to live&quot;.

In a 2010 article for the Salvadoran online newspaper &quot;El Faro&quot;, Saravia was interviewed from a mountain hideout. He named D&#x27;Aubuisson as giving the assassination order to him over the phone, and said that he and his cohorts drove the assassin to the chapel and paid him 1,000 Salvadoran colónes after the event.

In April 2017, however, in the wake of the overruling of a civil war amnesty law the previous year, a judge in El Salvador, Rigoberto Chicas, allowed the case against the escaped Saravia&#x27;s alleged role in the murder of Romero to be reopened. On 23 October 2018, days after Romero&#x27;s canonization, Judge Chicas issued a new arrest warrant for him, and Interpol and the National Police are charged with finding his hideout and apprehending him. As both D&#x27;Aubuisson and Linares had already died, they could not be prosecuted.

===International recognition===

During his first visit to El Salvador in 1983, Pope John Paul II entered the cathedral in San Salvador and prayed at Romero&#x27;s tomb, despite opposition from the government and from some within the church who strongly opposed liberation theology. Afterwards, the Pope praised Romero as a &quot;zealous and venerated pastor who tried to stop violence.&quot; John Paul II also asked for dialogue between the government and opposition to end El Salvador&#x27;s civil war.

On 7 May 2000, in Rome&#x27;s Colosseum during the Jubilee Year celebrations, Pope John Paul II commemorated 20th-century martyrs. Of the several categories of martyrs, the seventh consisted of Christians who were killed for defending their brethren in the Americas. Despite the opposition of some social conservatives within the church, John Paul II insisted that Romero be included. He asked the organizers of the event to proclaim Romero &quot;that great witness of the Gospel.&quot;

On 21 December 2010, the United Nations General Assembly proclaimed 24 March as the International Day for the Right to the Truth concerning Gross Human Rights Violations and for the Dignity of Victims which recognizes, in particular, the important work and values of Romero.

On 22 March 2011, U.S. President Barack Obama visited Romero&#x27;s tomb during an official visit to El Salvador. Irish President Michael D. Higgins visited the cathedral and tomb of Romero on 25 October 2013 during a state visit to El Salvador. Famed linguist Noam Chomsky speaks highly of Romero&#x27;s social work, and refers often to his murder. In 2014, El Salvador&#x27;s main international airport was named after him, becoming Monseñor Óscar Arnulfo Romero y Galdámez International Airport, and later, San Óscar Arnulfo Romero y Galdámez International Airport in 2018 after his canonization.

Romero is remembered in the Church of England and in the Episcopal Church on 24 March.

==Sainthood==

===Process for beatification===
Romero&#x27;s sainthood cause at the Vatican was opened in 1993, but the Catholic News Service reported that it &quot;was delayed for years as the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith studied his writings, amid wider debate over whether he had been killed for his faith or for political reasons.&quot;

In March 2005, Vincenzo Paglia, the Vatican official in charge of the process, announced that Romero&#x27;s cause had cleared a theological audit by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, at the time headed by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (later elected Pope Benedict XVI) and that beatification could follow within six months. Pope John Paul II died within weeks of those remarks. Predictably, the transition of the new pontiff slowed down the work of canonizations and beatifications. Pope Benedict instituted changes that had the overall effect of reining in the Vatican&#x27;s so-called &quot;factory of saints.&quot; In an October 2005 interview, Cardinal José Saraiva Martins, the Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, was asked if Paglia&#x27;s predictions of a clearance for Romero&#x27;s beatification remained on track. Saraiva responded, &quot;Not as far as I know today,&quot; In November 2005, the Jesuit magazine &quot;La Civiltà Cattolica&quot; signaled that Romero&#x27;s beatification was still &quot;years away.&quot;

Although Benedict XVI had always been a fierce critic of liberation theology, Paglia reported in December 2012 that the Pope had informed him of the decision to &quot;unblock&quot; the cause and allow it to move forward. However, no progress was made before Benedict&#x27;s resignation in February 2013. Pope Francis was elected in March 2013, and in September 2013, Archbishop Gerhard Ludwig Müller, Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, stated that the Vatican doctrinal office has been &quot;given the green light&quot; to pursue sainthood for Romero.

===Beatification===
On 18 August 2014, Pope Francis said that &quot;[t]he process [of beatification of Romero] was at the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, blocked for &#x27;prudential reasons&#x27;, so they said. Now it is unblocked.&quot; Francis stated, &quot;There are no doctrinal problems and it is very important that [the beatification] is done quickly.&quot; The beatification signaled Francis&#x27; affirmation of Romero&#x27;s work with the poor and as a major change in the direction of the church since he was elected.

In January 2015, an advisory panel to the Roman Curia&#x27;s Congregation for the Causes of Saints voted unanimously to recognize Romero as a martyr, and the cardinals who were voting members of the Congregation unanimously recommended to Francis that he be beatified as a martyr (a martyr can be beatified without recognition of a miracle). Archbishop Vincenzo Paglia, the postulator (chief promoter) of the causes of saints, said that Romero&#x27;s assassination at the altar was intended &quot;to strike the Church that flowed from the Second Vatican Council&quot; and that the motive for his murder &quot;was not caused by motives that were simply political, but by hatred for a faith that, imbued with charity, would not be silent in the face of the injustices that relentlessly and cruelly slaughtered the poor and their defenders.&quot; On 3 February 2015, Francis received Cardinal Angelo Amato, Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, in a private audience, and authorized Amato to promulgate (officially authorize) Romero&#x27;s decree of martyrdom, meaning it had gained the Congregation&#x27;s voting members and the Pope&#x27;s approval. This cleared the way for the Pope to later set a date for his beatification.

The beatification of Romero was held in San Salvador on 23 May 2015 in the Plaza Salvador del Mundo under the Monumento al Divino Salvador del Mundo. Amato presided over the ceremony on behalf of Francis, who in a letter to the Archbishop of San Salvador José Luis Escobar Alas marked the occasion by calling Romero &quot;a voice that continues to resonate.&quot; An estimated 250,000 people attended the service, many watching on large television screens set up in the streets around the plaza.

===Canonization===
Three miracles were submitted to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome in October 2016 that could have led to Romero&#x27;s canonization. But each of these miracles was rejected after being investigated. A fourth (concerning the pregnant woman Cecilia Maribel Flores) was investigated in a diocesan process in San Salvador that was opened on 31 January 2017 and which concluded its initial investigation on 28 February before documentation was submitted to Rome via the apostolic nunciature. The CCS validated this on 7 April. On 11 August, Paglia celebrated the Romero Centenary Mass in St George&#x27;s Cathedral, Southwark, in London, where the cross and relics of Romero are preserved. Subsequently, medical experts issued unanimous approval to the presented miracle on 26 October with theologians also confirming their approval on 14 December. The CCS members likewise approved the case on 6 February 2018. Pope Francis approved this miracle on 6 March 2018, allowing for Romero to be canonized and the date was announced at a consistory of cardinals held on 19 May. The canonization was celebrated in Rome&#x27;s Saint Peter&#x27;s Square on 14 October 2018.

Previously, there had been hopes that Romero would be canonized during a possible papal visit to El Salvador on 15 August 2017 – the centennial of the late bishop&#x27;s birth – or that he could be canonized in Panama during World Youth Day in 2019.

Romero was the first Salvadoran to be raised to the altars; the first martyred archbishop of America, the first to be declared a martyr after the Second Vatican Council; and the first native saint of Central America, (Peter of Saint Joseph de Betancur, who did all his work for which he was canonized in the city of Santiago de los Caballeros of Guatemala, was from Tenerife, Spain,) Romero had already been included on the Anglican Church&#x27;s list of official saints and on the Lutheran Church&#x27;s liturgical calendar.

===Television and film===
* The opening scene in the otherwise fictional spy film S.A.S. à San Salvador (1983) shows a car carrying thugs through San Salvador and stopping at a church inside which the main villain assassinates Óscar Romero.
* Oliver Stone&#x27;s 1986 film &quot;Salvador&quot; depicts a fictionalized version of the assassination of Romero (played by José Carlos Ruiz) in a pivotal scene. Romero&#x27;s assassination (with René Enríquez as Romero) was also featured in the 1983 television film &quot;Choices of the Heart&quot; about the life and death of American Catholic missionary Jean Donovan. 
* The Archbishop&#x27;s life is the basis of the 1989 film &quot;Romero&quot;, directed by John Duigan and starring Raul Julia as Romero. It was produced by Paulist Productions (a film company run by the Paulist Fathers, a Roman Catholic society of priests). Timed for release ten years after Romero&#x27;s death, it was the first Hollywood feature film ever to be financed by the order. The film received respectful, if less-than-enthusiastic, reviews. Roger Ebert typified the critics who acknowledged that &quot;The film has a good heart, and the Julia performance is an interesting one, restrained and considered. ...The film&#x27;s weakness is a certain implacable predictability.&quot;

* In 2005, while at the UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism, Daniel Freed, an independent documentary filmmaker and frequent contributor to PBS and CNBC, made a 30-minute film entitled &quot;The Murder of Monseñor&quot; which not only documented Romero&#x27;s assassination but also told the story of how Álvaro Rafael Saravia – whom a US District court found, in 2004, had personally organized the assassination – moved to the United States and lived for 25 years as a used car salesman in Modesto, California, until he became aware of the pending legal action against him in 2003 and disappeared, leaving behind his drivers license and social security card, as well as his credit cards and his dog. In 2016 a 1993 law protecting the actions of the military during the Civil War was overruled by a Salvadoran high court and on 23 October 2018, another court ordered the arrest of Saravia.
* &quot;The Daily Show&quot; episode on 17 March 2010 showed clips from the Texas State Board of Education in which &quot;a panel of experts&quot; recommended including Romero in the state&#x27;s history books, but an amendment proposed by Patricia Hardy to exclude Romero was passed on 10 March 2010. The clip of Ms. Hardy shows her arguing against including Romero because &quot;I guarantee you most of you did not know who Oscar Romero was. ...I just happen to think it&#x27;s not [important].&quot;
* A film about the Archbishop, &quot;Monseñor, the Last Journey of Óscar Romero&quot;, with the priest Robert Pelton serving as executive producer, had its United States premiere in 2010. This film won the Latin American Studies Association (LASA) Award for Merit in film, in competition with 25 other films. Pelton was invited to show the film throughout Cuba. It was sponsored by ecclesial and human rights groups from Latin America and from North America. Alma Guillermoprieto in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; describes the film as a &quot;hagiography,&quot; and as &quot;an astonishing compilation of footage&quot; of the final three years of his life.

===Visual arts===
* St. James the Greater Catholic Church in Charles Town, West Virginia is the first known Catholic Church in the United States to venerate St. Oscar Romero with a stained glass window in its building.

<doc id="65692" wikidata="Q1207416" url="?curid=65692" title="Operational definition">
<text>An operational definition specifies concrete, replicable procedures designed to represent a construct. In the words of American psychologist S.S. Stevens (1935), &quot;An operation is the performance which we execute in order to make known a concept.&quot; For example, an operational definition of &quot;fear&quot; (the construct) often includes measurable physiologic responses that occur in response to a perceived threat. Thus, &quot;fear&quot; might be operationally defined as specified changes in heart rate, electrodermal activity, pupil dilation, and blood pressure.

== Overview ==
An operational definition is designed to model or represent a concept or theoretical definition, also known as a construct. Scientists should describe the operations (procedures, actions, or processes) that define the concept with enough specificity such that other investigators can replicate their research.

Operational definitions are also used to define system states in terms of a specific, publicly accessible process of preparation or validation testing. For example, 100 degrees Celsius may be operationally defined as the process of heating water at sea level until it is observed to boil.

A cake can be operationally defined by a cake recipe.

== Application ==
Despite the controversial philosophical origins of the concept, particularly its close association with logical positivism, operational definitions have undisputed practical applications. This is especially so in the social and medical sciences, where operational definitions of key terms are used to preserve the unambiguous empirical testability of hypothesis and theory. Operational definitions are also important in the physical sciences.

=== Philosophy ===
The &quot;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot; entry on scientific realism, written by Richard Boyd, indicates that the modern concept owes its origin in part to Percy Williams Bridgman, who felt that the expression of scientific concepts was often abstract and unclear. Inspired by Ernst Mach, in 1914 Bridgman attempted to redefine unobservable entities concretely in terms of the physical and mental operations used to measure them. Accordingly, the definition of each unobservable entity was uniquely identified with the instrumentation used to define it. From the beginning objections were raised to this approach, in large part around the inflexibility. As Boyd notes, &quot;In actual, and apparently reliable, scientific practice, changes in the instrumentation associated with theoretical terms are routine. and apparently crucial to the progress of science. According to a &#x27;pure&#x27; operationalist conception, these sorts of modifications would not be methodologically acceptable, since &quot;each&quot; definition must be considered to identify a &quot;unique&quot; &#x27;object&#x27; (or class of objects).&quot;

=== Science ===
The special theory of relativity can be viewed as the introduction of operational definitions for simultaneity of events and of distance, that is, as providing the operations needed to define these terms.

In quantum mechanics the notion of operational definitions is closely related to the idea of observables, that is, definitions based upon what can be measured.

Operational definitions are often most challenging in the fields of psychology and psychiatry, where intuitive concepts, such as intelligence need to be operationally defined before they become amenable to scientific investigation, for example, through processes such as IQ tests.

=== Business ===
On October 15, 1970, the West Gate Bridge in Melbourne, Australia collapsed, killing 35 construction workers. The subsequent enquiry found that the failure arose because engineers had specified the supply of a quantity of &quot;flat steel plate.&quot; The word &quot;flat&quot; in this context lacked an operational definition, so there was no test for accepting or rejecting a particular shipment or for controlling quality.

In his managerial and statistical writings, W. Edwards Deming placed great importance on the value of using operational definitions in all agreements in business.

=== General process ===
Operational, in a process context, also can denote a working method or a philosophy that focuses principally on cause and effect relationships (or stimulus/response, behavior, etc.) of specific interest to a particular domain at a particular point in time. As a working method, it does not consider issues related to a domain that are more general, such as the ontological, etc.

=== In computing ===
Science uses computing. Computing uses science. We have seen the development of computer science. There are not many who can bridge all three of these. One effect is that, when results are obtained using a computer, the results can be impossible to replicate if the code is poorly documented, contains errors, or if parts are omitted entirely.

Many times, issues are related to persistence and clarity of use of variables, functions, and so forth. Also, systems dependence is an issue. In brief, length (as a standard) has matter as its definitional basis. What pray tell can be used when standards are to be computationally framed?

Hence, operational definition can be used within the realm of the interactions of humans with advanced computational systems. In this sense, one area of discourse deals with computational thinking in, and with how it might influence, the sciences. To quote the American Scientist:
* The computer revolution has profoundly affected how we think about science, experimentation, and research.

One referenced project pulled together fluid experts, including some who were expert in the numeric modeling related to computational fluid dynamics, in a team with computer scientists. Essentially, it turned out that the computer guys did not know enough to weigh in as much as they would have liked. Thus, their role, to their chagrin, many times was &quot;mere&quot; programmer.

Some knowledge-based engineering projects experienced similarly that there is a trade-off between trying to teach programming to a domain expert versus getting a programmer to understand the intricacies of a domain. That, of course, depends upon the domain. In short, any team member has to decide which side of the coin to spend one&#x27;s time.

The International Society for Technology in Education has a brochure detailing an &quot;operational definition&quot; of computational thinking. At the same time, the ISTE made an attempt at defining related skills.

A recognized skill is tolerance for ambiguity and being able to handle open-ended problems. For instance, a knowledge-based engineering system can enhance its operational aspect and thereby its stability through more involvement by the subject-matter expert, thereby opening up issues of limits that are related to being human. As in, many times, computational results have to be taken at face value due to several factors (hence the duck test&#x27;s necessity arises) that even an expert cannot overcome. The end proof may be the final results (reasonable facsimile by simulation or artifact, working design, etc.) that are not guaranteed to be repeatable, may have been costly to attain (time and money), and so forth.

In advanced modeling, with the requisite computational support such as knowledge-based engineering, mappings must be maintained between a real-world object, its abstracted counterparts as defined by the domain and its experts, and the computer models. Mismatches between domain models and their computational mirrors can raise issues apropos this topic. Techniques that allow the flexible modeling required for many hard problems must resolve issues of identity, type, etc. which then lead to methods, such as duck typing. Many domains, with a numerical focus, use limit theory, of various sorts, to overcome the duck test necessity with varying degrees of success. Yet, with that, issues still remain as representational frameworks bear heavily on what we can know.

In arguing for an object-based methodology, Peter Wegner suggested that &quot;positivist scientific philosophies, such as operationalism in physics and behaviorism in psychology&quot; were powerfully applied in the early part of the 20th century. However, computation has changed the landscape. He notes that we need to distinguish four levels of &quot;irreversible physical and computational abstraction&quot; (Platonic abstraction, computational approximation, functional abstraction, and value computation). Then, we must rely on interactive methods, that have behavior as their focus (see duck test).

== Examples ==

=== Temperature ===
The thermodynamic definition of temperature, due to Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot, refers to heat &quot;flowing&quot; between &quot;infinite reservoirs&quot;. This is all highly abstract and unsuited for the day-to-day world of science and trade. In order to make the idea concrete, temperature is defined in terms of operations with the gas thermometer. However, these are sophisticated and delicate instruments, only adapted to the national standardization laboratory.

For day-to-day use, the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS) is used, defining temperature in terms of characteristics of the several specific sensor types required to cover the full range. One such is the electrical resistance of a thermistor, with specified construction, calibrated against operationally defined fixed points.

=== Electric current ===
Electric current is defined in terms of the force between two infinite parallel conductors, separated by a specified distance. This definition is too abstract for practical measurement, so a device known as a current balance is used to define the ampere operationally.

=== Mechanical hardness ===
Unlike temperature and electric current, there is no abstract physical concept of the hardness of a material. It is a slightly vague, subjective idea, somewhat like the idea of intelligence. In fact, it leads to three more specific ideas:

# Scratch hardness measured on Mohs&#x27; scale;
# Indentation hardness; and
# Rebound, or dynamic, hardness measured with a Shore scleroscope.

Of these, indentation hardness itself leads to many operational definitions, the most important of which are:

# Brinell hardness test – using a 10 mm steel ball;
# Vickers hardness test – using a pyramidal diamond indenter; and
# Rockwell hardness test – using a diamond cone indenter.

In all these, a process is defined for loading the indenter, measuring the resulting indentation, and calculating a hardness number. Each of these three sequences of measurement operations produces numbers that are consistent with our subjective idea of hardness. The harder the material to our informal perception, the greater the number it will achieve on our respective hardness scales. Furthermore, experimental results obtained using these measurement methods has shown that the hardness number can be used to predict the stress required to permanently deform steel, a characteristic that fits in well with our idea of resistance to permanent deformation. However, there is not always a simple relationship between the various hardness scales. Vickers and Rockwell hardness numbers exhibit qualitatively different behaviour when used to describe some materials and phenomena.

=== The constellation Virgo ===

The constellation Virgo is a specific constellation of stars in the sky, hence the process of forming Virgo cannot be an operational definition, since it is historical and not repeatable. Nevertheless, the process whereby we locate Virgo in the sky &quot;is&quot; repeatable, so in this way, Virgo is operationally defined. In fact, Virgo can have any number of definitions (although we can never prove that we are talking about the &quot;same&quot; Virgo), and any number may be operational.

=== Academic discipline ===
New academic disciplines appear in response to interdisciplinary activity at universities. An academic suggested that a subject matter area becomes a discipline when there are more than a dozen university departments using the same name for roughly the same subject matter.

<doc id="65693" wikidata="Q12435" url="?curid=65693" title="Hancock, Michigan">
<text>Hancock is a city in the Upper Peninsula of the U.S. state of Michigan. The population of Hancock was 4,501 at the 2020 United States census. The city is located within Houghton County, and is situated upon the Keweenaw Waterway, a channel of Lake Superior that cuts across the Keweenaw Peninsula. Hancock is located across the Keweenaw Waterway from the city of Houghton, and is connected to that city by the Portage Lake Lift Bridge. The city is located within Michigan&#x27;s Copper Country region.

Hancock is considered a &quot;cultural capital&quot; for Finnish Americans. The city is home to the Finnish American Heritage Center, and was home to Finlandia University from 1896 to 2023. Some street name signs in Hancock are bilingual, reading in both English and Finnish.

The Weather Channel has consistently ranked Hancock as the third-snowiest city in the U.S.

==History==
Hancock is located within Ojibwa (Chippewa) homelands and ceded-territory established by the Treaty of 1842. The founding of the settlement of Hancock began during the summers of 1847 and 1848, when a small group of prospectors laboring on a rugged hillside (later named Quincy Hill) discovered a sequence of prehistoric Ojibwe copper mining pits, stretching out for 100 feet along the local amygdaloid lode. Upon inspecting one, they realized that the Native Americans were able to take copper in small quantities through these pits. The discovery formed the basis upon which the Quincy Mining Company was created in October 1848, under a special charter granted by the legislature.

The earliest building in what is now the City of Hancock was a log cabin erected in 1846 on the site of the Ruggles Mining Claim, halfway up atop the hillside; it is no longer standing as the site has been taken up by the Houghton County Garage buildings. It was owned by Christopher Columbus (C.C.) Douglass, who came to live there in 1852. The Quincy Mining Company founded Hancock in 1859 after purchasing the land from Douglass and building an office and mine on the site. The city was named after John Hancock, a signer of the Declaration of Independence.

Hancock&#x27;s first store was built by the Leopold brothers in 1858; the store also housed the first post office. Samuel W. Hill, an agent for the Quincy Mining Company, platted the Village of Hancock in 1859. On 20 August 1860, Bishop Frederic Baraga and Reverend Edward Jacker selected lots nine and ten of block eight in the village for the purpose of constructing a church. It was on the northeast corner of what is now Quincy and Ravine Streets. The Quincy Mining Company donated this ground, but for some reason the official paperwork didn&#x27;t go through for it until 2 July 1875.

In Hancock&#x27;s earliest days, the village had been within the borders of what is now the Portage Charter Township, but on 1 April 1861 the area was set off and organized into a new township called Hancock Township. The Portage Stamp Mill was also founded nearby at Portage Lake in 1861. In 1860, the Keweenaw Waterway was dredged, widening the then-Portage River to allow more aquatic transportation to Hancock and neighboring Houghton. The waterway was initially opened to ships in 1859.

Also in 1859 was the debut of the Hancock Mine, later called the Sumner Mine before being renamed the Hancock Mine once more. The mine was on Quincy Hill near both Summit and Franklin Streets in an area that is now part of Finlandia Campus.

On 10 March 1863, the Village of Hancock was officially organized and the first officers were elected in the office of William Lapp, the justice of the peace and a pioneer lawyer. Hervey Coke Parke was elected as the first village president. This is considered the founding date of Hancock.

M.J. McGurrin opened the village&#x27;s first drugstore in 1865. There were also a few small grocery stores where James Artman sold handmade harnesses. The population of the town may have been about 400, mostly miners who had occupied smaller houses near the vicinity of their workplace, the mines.

On 11 April 1869, Hancock was struck by the worst fire in the community&#x27;s history when a stovepipe in a local saloon where the post office is now exploded and engulfed the building in flames. It soon spread across the village with the help of a strong west wind. The fire destroyed some 150 buildings, including every store in the village and almost all other businesses, the wooden bridges that had stretched across the ravines, and 120 homes. At the time, Hancock had no fire department or fire equipment. This short-lived fire obliterated three-fourths of Hancock. It took two years to rebuild. Famously, Mary Chase Perry Stratton, the founder of the Pewabic Pottery, survived the 1869 fire without injuries.

On 1 March 1871, in response to the devastating fire of 1869, the Hancock Fire Department was officially organized. In an 1883 publication the fire chief, Archibald J. Scott, stated that the fire department had 2,500 ft of hose on hand and that the water supply was ample.

In 1872 the Hancock and Calumet Railroad (H&amp;C RR) and the Mineral Range Railroad (MRRR) began their operations. The MRRR provided passenger and freight service between Houghton, Hancock, Dollar Bay and Calumet. The Mineral Range&#x27;s yards were along Portage Lake near Tezcuco Street. In 1877, Gustave Diemal, an immigrant from Germany and the 1870 sheriff-elect of Keweenaw County, arrived in Hancock and opened a jewelry and watchmakers shop.

In 1876, Alfred Elieser Backman arrived in Hancock and served as Copper Country&#x27;s first pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland. He found a divided community of Finnish Lutherans: some were faithful followers of the Church of Finland, and others Laestadian. Backman later found the situation too unstable and was replaced by Juho Kustaa Nikander, who arrived in January 1885. By 1889, four pastors from the Church of Finland were serving Finnish communities in the Upper Peninsula: Nikander, Jacob Juhonpoika Hoikka (who had served as Nikander&#x27;s co-pastor), Kaarlo L. Tolonen of Ishpeming, and Johan W. Eloheimo of Calumet. The four pastors met often and eventually founded the Suomi Synod on 25 March 1890, though they had conceived the idea as early as November 1889.

Suomi College was founded in September 1896 by Nikander, and on 21 January 1900, it completed its first building, now affectionately called &quot;Old Main&quot; on Quincy Street. As many as 2,000 people traveled to Hancock to see the laying of the cornerstone. Like a large handful of historic buildings in the city, it is made of Jacobsville Sandstone and built in the Richardsonian Romanesque style. For eight years, Nikander, who served as the college&#x27;s first president, resided in Old Main. Also in 1900, the Book Concern of Suomi College was established as the publishing house of the Finnish Evangelical Lutheran Church of America.

In 1898, the Quincy Smelter was constructed in nearby Ripley, Franklin Township, to serve the industrious Quincy Mine. The smelter was built on a site formerly held by the Pewabic Mining Company, which the Quincy had absorbed in 1891. In 1893 both the H&amp;C RR and the MRRR were administered by the Duluth, South Shore and Atlantic Railroad (DSA).

On 28 August 1896 the Finnish Evangelical Lutheran Church of Hancock was struck by lightning, which killed the assistant pastor and then-recently appointed Suomi College instructor Jooseppi Riippa after he had just dismissed 50 children because of the severe weather.

The Houghton County Street Railway Company (renamed in 1908 the Houghton County Traction Company) also offered street car service from Houghton through Hancock to Calumet, Laurium, Mohawk, Hubbell, and Lake Linden, beginning in 1902. In fall of 1902 the Kerredge Theatre was completed by William and Ray Kerredge in response to the wildly popular Calumet Theatre. Hancock was officially incorporated as a city on 10 March 1903 and subsequently divided into four wards. The then-incumbent village president Archibald J. Scott was elected the city&#x27;s first mayor.

After having broken ground for the construction process in August 1903, on 5 June 1904 the St. Joseph&#x27;s Medical Center was dedicated in a public ceremony. Built with brick and local Jacobsville sandstone, the new complex was five stories high and of Renaissance style architecture. The entryway was completed at a cost of $78 000 plus $21,396 for necessary equipment. In 1906, the Scott Hotel on East Quincy Street was completed. A year later, the Copper Country Limited line of both the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad and the Duluth, South Shore and Atlantic Railway, began operations. The line went to Calumet in the north, through Hancock, connecting the Keweenaw to Chicago, Illinois, where it began.

In 1906, the Scott Hotel, adjacent to the previously erected Kerredge Theater, was built and named after the prominent city businessman and mayor Archibald J. Scott. The Scott Hotel was constructed as a symbol of Hancock&#x27;s size and importance. In 1906, the Hancock Mine expanded its operations and sank the No. 2 vertical shaft. In 1913, the Scott Hotel was host to the high-profile kidnapping, shooting, and beating of Western Federation of Miners President Charles Moyer and his bodyguard Charles Tanner at the hands of members of the local Citizens&#x27; Alliance in the Keweenaw and Houghton County Sheriff&#x27;s Department. This was in response to his pleas to Governor Woodbridge N. Ferris and President Woodrow Wilson for proper investigations into the Italian Hall Disaster. The kidnapping, beating, and subsequent &quot;deportation&quot; to Chicago by officials of the area has cemented its place in local memory.

Before World War I, around the time of the tempestuous Copper Country Strike of 1913–14, the city population had dropped from its all-time high of 8,981 to 7,527, as many families moved away with the heads of their households to seek a means of living in the factories of Lower Michigan and Wisconsin or in other copper mines in Montana.

Hancock received its second hospital in March 1917, a Finnish hospital called &quot;Suomalainen Sairaala&quot;. It was also called the Hancock Bethany Hospital, and later known as Dr. Henry Holm&#x27;s Hospital. In 1917 the old First Congregational Church of Hancock, on the corner of Quincy and Tezcuco Streets, burned down. In 1921, the new First Congregational Church of Hancock was completed, though services had begun after breaking ground in 1919.

Misfortune came to Hancock after the financial crash in 1929 as mines began to close for lack of a profitable market. Copper at the time sold for only five cents a pound. The Quincy Mine closed in 1931, and neighboring mines closed the next year. By 1934, one third of the families in Houghton County were seeking aid through relief programs. The Quincy Mine resumed its operations in 1937, but discontinued them in 1946, one week after Japan surrendered in 1945, ending World War II.

By 1949 the facilities of St. Joseph&#x27;s Hospital were no longer adequate to meet the needs of the population, and through funds from the Hill-Burton Act and lavish contributions of hospital benefactors, the new St. Joseph&#x27;s Hospital facility on Michigan Street was assembled. The new building was dedicated on 29 July 1951 by Bishop Thomas L. Noa of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Marquette. The first patients moved in on 27 August 1951.

On 29 May 1959 the historic Kerredge Theater, the counterpart to The Calumet Theatre, burned to the ground. Joint preparations with Houghton were carried out in 1963 to install a sewage disposal plant to prevent the contamination of Portage Lake.

During the United States Bicentennial in 1976, then-Finnish President Urho Kekkonen visited the Hancock area and entirely filled the Michigan Technological University ice arena when he gave his official address to the local Finnish-American community. In 1990, a rundown former Catholic church on Quincy Street was renovated extensively with traditional Finnish architectural styles and officially became the Finnish-American Heritage Center.

In 2023, Finlandia University, which had been in operation since 1896, closed.

==Geography==

The City of Hancock is further north than Montreal in Quebec, Canada. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and is water. Hancock is connected to Houghton by the Portage Lake Lift Bridge, which crosses the dredged Keweenaw Waterway. The Keweenaw Waterway effectively slices the Keweenaw in two. Both Houghton and Hancock are on 500-foot bluffs.

The city is bounded on the south by the Portage Canal, parts of Quincy, Hancock and Franklin Townships; on the east by West Ripley; and on the north by Quincy and Hancock Townships. Other communities that share a border with Hancock include Ripley and Arcadian Location.

===Climate===
Hancock has a humid continental climate, with long and snowy winters and much lake effect snow. It is the third-snowiest city in the United States, the snowiest city in the Midwestern United States, and the snowiest city in the Eastern United States, with snowfall averaging per year. The city is along the Keweenaw Peninsula. In 1978–79, a whopping of snow fell in Hancock. Accumulating snow has been known to fall as late as early June here.

== Attractions ==

=== Historic sites ===

* The 1899 historic, NRHP-listed and Michigan State Historic Site Hancock Town Hall and Fire Hall on Quincy Street is certainly a local landmark of sorts. The red block used to construct the building is Jacobsville Sandstone, a locally quarried stone from the town of Jacobsville.

==People and culture==

=== Finnish-American culture ===
Hancock has been called &quot;the focal point of Finns in the United States.&quot; Many Finns settled in Hancock because the forests, the lakes, and the clear blue skies reminded them of home. In Hancock, about 40% of the population claimed Finnish ancestry in the most recent federal census. Since 1983, Hancock has had an active Finnish Theme Committee entrusted with preserving the region&#x27;s Finnish heritage. In recognition of the large number of Finns in the area, some street signs in Hancock are written in both English and Finnish.

=== Festivals ===

Hancock hosts an annual midwinter festival called Heikinpäivä (&quot;Henry&#x27;s Day&quot;) on 19 January, celebrating the feast day of Saint Henrik of Uppsala, the patron saint of Finland, and Heikki Lunta. Heikinpäivä includes a traditional wife-carrying competition. Every June, Hancock and Houghton host a festival known as Bridgefest to commemorate the building of the Portage Lake Lift Bridge, which united both the communities of Copper Island and those in the southern portions of the Keweenaw Peninsula. Also held in June is the Keweenaw Chain Drive Festival. The Keweenaw Trail Running Festival takes place each July.

==Education==
===Public education===
Elementary-school students attend the Gordon Barkell Elementary School (formerly Hancock Elementary School), middle school students Hancock Middle School and high-school students Hancock Central High School. Hancock Central High and Hancock Middle School are now connected.

===Higher education===
Hancock is the home of Finlandia University (formerly Suomi College). Suomi College was founded in 1896 by the Finnish Evangelical Lutheran Church of America. In the 1880s large numbers of Finns immigrated to Hancock to labor in the copper and lumber industries. One immigrant, mission pastor J. K. Nikander of the Finnish Evangelical Lutheran Church of America, headquartered in Hancock, wanted to ensure seminary training in America. He had observed that Swedish and Finnish immigrants along the Delaware River did not train new ministers, and he feared a loss of Finnish identity. In 1896 Nikander founded Suomi College. The college&#x27;s role was to preserve Finnish culture, train Lutheran ministers and teach English. During the 1920s Suomi became a liberal arts college. In 1958 the seminary separated from the college. Four years later the Finnish Evangelical Lutheran Church of America merged with other mainstream Lutheran churches. The cornerstone of Old Main, the first building erected at Suomi College, was laid on May 30, 1898. Jacobsville sandstone, quarried at the Portage Entry of the Keweenaw waterway, was brought there by barge, cut, and used to construct Old Main. Dedicated on January 21, 1900, it contained a dormitory, kitchen, laundry, classrooms, offices, library, chapel, and lounge. The college quickly outgrew this building, and in 1901 a frame structure, housing a gym, meeting hall, and music center was erected on an adjacent lot. The frame building was demolished when Nikander Hall, named for Suomi&#x27;s founder, was constructed in 1939. The hall was designed by the architectural firm of Saarinen and Swanson, which employed the world-renowned Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen.

Several parts of the campus of Michigan Technological University are also in Hancock, including a former MTU &quot;underground classroom&quot; in the Quincy Mine.

<doc id="65696" wikidata="Q1679999" url="?curid=65696" title="James Bacque">
<text>James Watson Bacque (19 May 1929 – 13 September 2019) was a Canadian writer, publisher, and book editor. He was born in Toronto, Ontario.

==Early life==
Bacque was educated at Upper Canada College in Toronto and then the University of Toronto, where he studied history and philosophy, graduating in 1952 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. He was a member of Seaton&#x27;s House, one of the school&#x27;s boarding houses.

==Fiction writing==
Bacque was a mainstream fiction writer and essayist before turning his attention, in 1989, to the fate of German soldiers held as POWs by the Allies after World War II. His recent works include &quot;Dear Enemy&quot; (2000), with Richard Matthias Mueller, essays on Germany &quot;Then and Now&quot;. Bacque had just completed a comic drama for the stage entitled &quot;Conrad&quot;, about a media mogul in prison, which was scheduled for production on 2 October 2009 at the George Ignatieff Theatre in Toronto. Bacque&#x27;s latest book, &quot;Putting On Conrad&quot;, about the experiences of producers trying to put on his play in the face of libel chill, is an amusing satire on Canada&#x27;s literary establishment.

==&quot;Other Losses&quot;==

In &quot;Other Losses&quot; (1989), Bacque claimed that Allied Supreme Commander Dwight Eisenhower&#x27;s policies caused the death of 790,000 German captives in internment camps through disease, starvation and cold from 1944 to 1949. In similar French camps some 250,000 more are said to have perished. The International Committee of the Red Cross was refused entry to the camps, Switzerland was deprived of its status as &quot;protecting power&quot; and POWs were reclassified as &quot;Disarmed Enemy Forces&quot; to circumvent recognition under the Geneva Convention. Bacque argued that this alleged mass murder was a direct result of the policies of the western Allies, who, with the Soviets, ruled as the Military Occupation Government over partitioned Germany from May 1945 until 1949. He laid the blame on Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, saying Germans were kept on starvation rations even though there was enough food in the world to avert the lethal shortage in Germany in 1945–1946.

===Academic criticism===

Academic reviewers question three major aspects of Bacque&#x27;s work: his claims that there was no post-war food shortage in other European countries; Bacque&#x27;s estimate of the number of German deaths; and the allegation that Eisenhower was deliberately vindictive.
Bacque&#x27;s critics note many of the German soldiers were sick and wounded at the time of their surrender, and say his work does not place the plight of the German prisoners within the context of the grim situation in Western Europe in 1945 and 1946.

Writing in the &quot;Canadian Historical Review&quot;, David Stafford called the book &quot;a classic example of a worthwhile investigation marred by polemic and overstatement.&quot; R.J. Rummell, a scholar of 20th-century atrocities, has written that &quot;Bacque misread, misinterpreted, or ignored the relevant documents and that his mortality statistics are simply impossible.&quot; More recently, writing in the &quot;Encyclopedia of Prisoners of War and Internment&quot;, S. P. MacKenzie states, &quot;That German prisoners were treated very badly in the months immediately after the war […] is beyond dispute. All in all, however, Bacque&#x27;s thesis and mortality figures cannot be taken as accurate&quot;.

Eisenhower biographer Stephen Ambrose, who helped edit &quot;Other Losses&quot;, wrote &quot;I quarrel with many of your interpretations, [but] I am not arguing with the basic truth of your discovery&quot; and acknowledged that Bacque had made a &quot;major historical discovery&quot;, in the sense that very little attention had hitherto been paid to the treatment of German POWs in Allied hands. He acknowledged he did not now support Bacque&#x27;s conclusions, but said at the American Military Institute&#x27;s Annual Meeting in March 1990:

However, in a 1991 &quot;New York Times&quot; book review, Ambrose claimed:

A book-length disputation of Bacque&#x27;s work, entitled &quot;Eisenhower and the German POWs&quot;, appeared in 1992, featuring essays by British, American, and German historians.

Despite the criticisms of Bacque&#x27;s methodology, Stephen Ambrose and Brian Loring Villa, the authors of the chapter on German POW deaths, conceded the Allies were motivated in their treatment of captured Germans by disgust and revenge for German atrocities. They did, however, argue Bacque&#x27;s casualty figures are far too high, and that policy was set by Allied politicians, not by Eisenhower.

Stephen Ambrose said, &quot;we as Americans can&#x27;t duck the fact that terrible things happened. And they happened at the end of a war we fought for decency and freedom, and they are not excusable.&quot;

Jonathan Osmond, writing in the &quot;Journal of the Royal Institute of International Affairs&quot;, said:

Osmond also called the book &quot;emotive and journalistic&quot;.

One of the historians in support of Bacque was Colonel Ernest F. Fisher, 101st Airborne Division, who in 1945 took part in investigations into allegations of misconduct by U.S. troops in Germany and later became a Senior Historian with the United States Army. In the foreword to the book he states:

==&quot;Crimes and Mercies&quot;==
In a subsequent book, &quot;Crimes And Mercies&quot; (1997), Bacque claimed that Allied policies led to the premature deaths of 5.7 million civilians among the indigenous population of East and West Germany (in excess of recorded mortality) between censuses in October 1946 and September 1950, 2.5 million ethnic German refugees from Eastern Europe and 1.1 million German POWs due to Allied starvation and expulsion policies in the five years following World War II. 

The book also details the charity work conducted by the Allies, primarily Canada and the United States, crediting it with saving or improving the lives of up to 500 million people around the world in the post war period. This work was led by Herbert Hoover at the behest of President Truman, and by the Canadian Prime Minister, Mackenzie King, together with Norman Robertson and Mitchell Sharp. This was the largest relief program ever organized, and expressed the ideals of many of the allied combatants.

Bacque&#x27;s figures for prisoners of war and expellees are in excess of those accepted by historians, and his claim of 5.7 million unrecorded civilian deaths in East and West Germany between 1946 and 1950 censuses has no correspondence at all in historical literature. A review of &quot;Crimes and Mercies&quot; by German historian Bernd Greiner considers the aforementioned 5.7 million claim to have no substance, contextualizes Bacque&#x27;s book with attempts of the extreme right to gain mainstream acceptance, and expresses surprise at historians&#x27; passivity in the face of such tendencies (&quot;Es ist mehr als erstaunlich, wie Wolfgang Wippermann unlängst zu Recht anmerkte, daß die seriösen Fachhistoriker diesem Treiben noch immer ungerührt zusehen.&quot;). A panel of scholars gathered at the annual German Studies Association meeting in Salt Lake City in October 1999 and found the charges of &quot;Crimes and Mercies&quot; even more extravagant than those proffered in &quot;Other Losses&quot;. The panel&#x27;s papers were never published, however, since the participants thought that the business of refuting Bacque&#x27;s claims again and again and in detail gives more credence to his wild conspiracy history, and trying to revive the debate was yet another attempt by him to gain acceptability in the scholarly community.

According to the German Federal Archives in 1956, more than 2 million refugees/expellees from the eastern territories of the former German Reich in its 1937 borders and from ethnic German minorities outside Germany&#x27;s 1937 borders perished during and after the war. However, this order of magnitude is under considerable dispute by historians.

<doc id="65698" wikidata="Q1635737" url="?curid=65698" title="Mel scale">
<text>The mel scale (after the word &quot;melody&quot;) is a perceptual scale of pitches judged by listeners to be equal in distance from one another. The reference point between this scale and normal frequency measurement is defined by assigning a perceptual pitch of 1000 mels to a 1000 Hz tone, 40 dB above the listener&#x27;s threshold. Above about 500 Hz, increasingly large intervals are judged by listeners to produce equal pitch increments.

==Formula==
A formula (O&#x27;Shaughnessy 1987) to convert &quot;f&quot; hertz into &quot;m&quot; mels is
formula_1
==History and other formulas==

The formula from O&#x27;Shaughnessy&#x27;s book can be expressed with different logarithmic bases:
formula_2

The corresponding inverse expressions are
formula_3

There were published curves and tables on psychophysical pitch scales since Steinberg&#x27;s 1937 
curves based on just-noticeable differences of pitch. More curves soon followed in Fletcher and Munson&#x27;s 1937 
and Fletcher&#x27;s 1938
and Stevens&#x27; 1937 and Stevens and Volkmann&#x27;s 1940
papers using a variety of experimental methods and analysis approaches.

In 1949 Koenig published an approximation based on separate linear and logarithmic segments, with a break at 1000 Hz.

Gunnar Fant proposed the current popular linear/logarithmic formula in 1949, but with the 1000 Hz corner frequency.

An alternate expression of the formula, not depending on choice of logarithm base, is noted in Fant (1968):
formula_4

In 1976, Makhoul and Cosell published the now-popular version with the 700 Hz corner frequency.
As Ganchev et al. have observed, &quot;The formulae [with 700], when compared to [Fant&#x27;s with 1000], provide a closer approximation of the Mel scale for frequencies below 1000 Hz, at the price of higher inaccuracy for frequencies higher than 1000 Hz.&quot; Above 7 kHz, however, the situation is reversed, and the 700 Hz version again fits better.

Data by which some of these formulas are motivated are tabulated in Beranek (1949), as measured from the curves of Stevens and Volkmann:

A formula with a break frequency of 625 Hz is given by Lindsay &amp; Norman (1977); the formula does not appear in their 1972 first edition:
formula_5

For direct comparison with other formulae, this is equivalent to
formula_6

Most mel-scale formulas give exactly 1000 mels at 1000 Hz. The break frequency (e.g. 700 Hz, 1000 Hz, or 625 Hz) is the only free parameter in the usual form of the formula. Some non-mel auditory-frequency-scale formulas use the same form but with much lower break frequency, not necessarily mapping to 1000 at 1000 Hz; for example the ERB-rate scale of Glasberg and Moore (1990) uses a break point of 228.8 Hz, and the cochlear frequency–place map of Greenwood (1990) uses 165.3 Hz.

Other functional forms for the mel scale have been explored by Umesh et al.; they point out that the traditional formulas with a logarithmic region and a linear region do not fit the data from Stevens and Volkmann&#x27;s curves as well as some other forms, based on the following data table of measurements that they made from those curves:

Slaney&#x27;s MATLAB Auditory Toolbox agrees with Umesh et al. and uses the following two-piece fit, though notably not using the &quot;1000 mels at 1000 Hz&quot; convention:
formula_7

== Applications ==
The first version of Google&#x27;s Lyra codec uses &quot;log mel spectrograms&quot; as the feature-extraction step. The transmitted data is a vector-quantized form of the spectrogram, which is then synthesized back to speech by a neural network. Use of the mel scale is believed to weigh the data in a way appropriate to human perception. MelGAN takes a similar approach.

==Criticism==
Stevens&#x27; student Donald D. Greenwood, who had worked on the mel scale experiments in 1956, considers the scale biased by experimental flaws. In 2009 he posted to a mailing list:

<doc id="65704" wikidata="Q1365870" url="?curid=65704" title="Stanley Smith Stevens">
<text>Stanley Smith Stevens (November 4, 1906 – January 18, 1973) was an American psychologist who founded Harvard&#x27;s Psycho-Acoustic Laboratory, studying psychoacoustics, and he is credited with the introduction of Stevens&#x27;s power law. Stevens authored a milestone textbook, the 1400+ page &quot;Handbook of Experimental Psychology&quot; (1951). He was also one of the founding organizers of the Psychonomic Society. In 1946 he introduced a theory of levels of measurement widely used by scientists but whose use in some areas of statistics has been criticized. In addition, Stevens played a key role in the development of the use of operational definitions in psychology.

A &quot;Review of General Psychology&quot; survey, published in 2002, ranked Stevens as the 52nd most cited psychologist of the 20th century. He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the United States National Academy of Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society.

==Life==
Stevens was born in Ogden, Utah, to Stanley and Adeline (Smith) Stevens and educated in Latter-day Saint-affiliated schools in Salt Lake City, Utah. He spent much of his childhood in the polygamous household of his maternal grandfather Orson Smith. At the death of his parents in 1924, he spent the next 3 years on an LDS mission in Switzerland and Belgium. He attended the University of Utah from 1927 to 1929 and Stanford University for the next two years, graduating with an A.B. in psychology in 1931.

Shortly after arriving in Massachusetts to begin a Ph.D., he left the LDS church, but continued to struggle with conflicting ideas of faith and science. After two years of graduate study, he received his Ph.D. in psychology from Harvard University, where he served under Edwin Boring as assistant in psychology, from 1932 to 1934.

The following year he spent studying physiology under Hallowell Davis at Harvard Medical School, and in 1935 served as a research fellow in physics at Harvard for a year. In 1936, Stevens accepted a position as an instructor in experimental psychology at Harvard University.

He married Maxine Leonard in 1930 and had a son, Peter Smith Stevens, in 1936. He married Geraldine Stone, who had worked in the Psycho-Acoustic Laboratory from its inception, in 1963.

==Science of Science discussion group==
Stevens played a key role in organising the Science of Science discussion group in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which met on eight occasions from October 1940 to mid-1941. Stevens, who was noted for the clarity of his scientific writing, attracted to the group a number of participants whose aim was the &quot;debabelisation of science&quot;. The group was also influenced by the 5th Congress of the Unity of Science, which had been held at Harvard University in September 1939 and featured a number of well-known scientists from different disciplines.

==Work==
Stevens&#x27; experimental and theoretical work lay primarily in the fields of psychophysics and psychoacoustics. One of his most influential contributions was his definition of a measurement scale defined by four types: Nominal, Ordinal, Interval, and Ratio. (see Level of measurement) He is the author of the operational theory of measurement, which “...in the broadest sense, is defined as the assignment of numerals to objects or events according to rules.” In fact, the definition paraphrased Campbell&#x27;s note from the Final Report of the so-called Ferguson&#x27;s committee (joint committee of sections A, Mathematical and Physical Sciences, and J, Psychology, of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, held 1932–1940). Stevens just omitted or extended some of Campbell&#x27;s assumptions. While Campbell considered additivity to be a necessary condition, Stevens considered any rule to fit the definition. His goal was to overcome the committee&#x27;s conclusion concerning the possibility of measurement in psychology.

<doc id="65707" wikidata="Q373557" url="?curid=65707" title="Aerobatics">
<text>Aerobatics is the practice of flying maneuvers involving aircraft attitudes that are not used in conventional passenger-carrying flights. The term is a portmanteau of &quot;aeroplane&quot; and &quot;acrobatics&quot;. Aerobatics are performed in aeroplanes and gliders for training, recreation, entertainment, and sport. Additionally, some helicopters, such as the MBB Bo 105, are capable of limited aerobatic manoeuvres. An example of a fully aerobatic helicopter, capable of performing loops and rolls, is the Westland Lynx.

Most aerobatic manoeuvres involve rotation of the aircraft about its longitudinal (roll) axis or lateral (pitch) axis. Other maneuvers, such as a spin, displace the aircraft about its vertical (yaw) axis. Manoeuvres are often combined to form a complete aerobatic sequence for entertainment or competition. Aerobatic flying requires a broader set of piloting skills and exposes the aircraft to greater structural stress than for normal flight. In some countries, the pilot must wear a parachute when performing aerobatics.

Aerobatic training enhances a pilot&#x27;s ability to recover from unusual flight conditions, and thus is an element of many flight safety training programs for pilots. While many pilots fly aerobatics for recreation, some choose to fly in aerobatic competitions, a judged sport.

==Overview==
In the early days of flying, some pilots used their aircraft as part of a flying circus to entertain. Maneuvers were flown for artistic reasons or to draw gasps from onlookers. In due course some of these maneuvers were found to allow aircraft to gain tactical advantage during aerial combat or dogfights between fighter aircraft.

Aerobatic aircraft fall into two categories—specialist aerobatic, and aerobatic capable. Specialist designs such as the Pitts Special, the Extra 200 and 300, and the Sukhoi Su-26M and Sukhoi Su-29 aim for ultimate aerobatic performance. This comes at the expense of general purpose use such as touring, or ease of non aerobatic handling such as landing. At a more basic level, &quot;aerobatic capable&quot; aircraft, such as the Cessna 152 Aerobat or the R2160 Acrobin, can be dual purpose—equipped to carrying passengers and luggage, as well as being capable of basic aerobatic figures.

&quot;Flight formation aerobatics&quot; are flown by teams of up to sixteen aircraft, although most teams fly between four and ten aircraft. Some are state funded to reflect pride in the armed forces while others are commercially sponsored. Coloured smoke trails may be emitted to emphasise the patterns flown and/or the colours of a national flag.

Aerobatic maneuvers flown in a jet-powered aircraft are limited in scope as they cannot take advantage of the gyroscopic forces that a propeller driven aircraft can exploit. Jet-powered aircraft also tend to fly much faster, which increases the size of the figures and the length of time the pilot has to withstand increased g-forces. Jet aerobatic teams often fly in formations, which further restricts the maneuvers that can be safely flown.
Aerobatics done at low levels and for an audience is called &quot;stunt flying&quot;. To enhance the show effect of aerobatic manoeuvres, smoke is sometimes generated; the smoke allows viewers to see the path travelled by the aircraft. Due to safety concerns, the smoke is not a result of combustion but is produced by the vaporization of fog oil into a fine aerosol, achieved either by injecting the oil into the hot engine exhaust or by the use of a dedicated device that can be fitted in any position on the aircraft. The first military aerobatic team to use smoke at will during displays was Fleet Air Arm 702 Squadron &quot;The Black Cats&quot; at the Farnborough Airshow in September 1957.

===Training===
Aerobatics are taught to military fighter pilots as a means of developing flying skills and for tactical use in combat. Many aerobatic manoeuvres were indeed developed in military conflicts, e.g. the Immelmann turn or Split S.

Aerobatics and formation flying is not limited solely to fixed-wing aircraft; the British Army, Royal Navy, Spanish Air Force and the Indian Air Force, among others, have helicopter display teams.

All aerobatic manoeuvres demand training and practice to avoid accidents. Accidents due to aerobatic manoeuvres are very rare in competition aerobatics; most of them happen when performing formation flying or stunt flying at very low levels at airshows or air racing. Low-level aerobatics are extremely demanding and airshow pilots must demonstrate their ability before being allowed to gradually reduce the height at which they may fly their show.

In the EU, flying aerobatics requires special training and a rating. In Canada, no licence is required to perform aerobatics, but to carry passengers during aerobatics a pilot must have at least 10 hours dual flight instruction of aerobatic manoeuvres, or 20 hours of total aerobatic experience.

===Competition===
Aerobatic flying competitions are a worldwide phenomenon, rather like the Olympic games, and are governed by the FAI Aerobatics Commission (CIVA)

Competitions start at Primary, or Graduate level (in UK &quot;Beginners&quot;) and proceed in complexity through Sportsman (in UK &quot;Standard&quot;), Intermediate and Advanced, with Unlimited being the top competition level. Experienced aerobatic pilots have been measured to pull ±5 g for short periods while unlimited pilots can perform more extreme maneuvers and experience higher g levels -possibly up to +8/−6 g. The limits for positive g are higher than for negative g and this is due to the ability to limit blood pooling for positive g maneuvers, but it is generally accepted that +9 g for more than a few seconds will lead to loss of consciousness (also known as GLOC).

===Performance===
Aerobatics are most likely to be seen at public airshows in the form of stunt flying. Aerobatic competitions usually do not attract large crowds of spectators since the manoeuvers are flown at safe altitudes to avoid accidents.

<text>Düsseldorf is the capital city of North Rhine-Westphalia, the most populous state of Germany. It is the second-largest city in the state after Cologne and the seventh-largest city in Germany, with a 2022 population of 629,047.

The Düssel, from which the city and the borough of Düsseltal take their name, divides into four separate branches within the city, each with its own mouth into the Rhine (Lower Rhine). Most of Düsseldorf lies on the right bank of the Rhine, and the city has grown together with Neuss, Ratingen, Meerbusch, Erkrath and Monheim am Rhein. Düsseldorf is the central city of the metropolitan region Rhine-Ruhr, the second biggest metropolitan region by GDP in the European Union, that stretches from Bonn via Cologne and Düsseldorf to the Ruhr (from Duisburg via Essen to Dortmund).

The &quot;-dorf&quot; suffix means &quot;village&quot; in German (English cognate: &quot;thorp&quot;); its use is unusual for a settlement as large as Düsseldorf. Linguistically, Düsseldorf is the largest city in the German part of the Low Franconian area, dialects that are closely related to Dutch. 

Düsseldorf is an international business and financial centre, renowned for its fashion and trade fairs, and is headquarters to one Fortune Global 500 and two DAX companies. Messe Düsseldorf organises nearly one fifth of premier trade shows. Düsseldorf Airport is Germany&#x27;s fourth-busiest airport, serving as the most important international airport for the population of the densely populated Ruhr, Germany&#x27;s largest urban area.

As second largest city of the Rhineland, Düsseldorf holds Rhenish Carnival celebrations every year in February/March, the Düsseldorf carnival celebrations being the third most popular in Germany after those held in Cologne and Mainz.

There are 22 institutions of higher education in the city including the Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf, the university of applied sciences (Hochschule Düsseldorf), the academy of arts (Kunstakademie Düsseldorf, whose members include Joseph Beuys, Emanuel Leutze, August Macke, Gerhard Richter, Sigmar Polke, and Andreas Gursky), and the university of music (Robert-Schumann-Musikhochschule Düsseldorf). The city is also known for its influence on electronic/experimental music (Kraftwerk) and its Japanese community. Düsseldorf is classified as a GaWC Beta+ world city. Mercer&#x27;s 2023 Quality of Living survey ranked Düsseldorf the tenth most livable city in the world.

 northwest of Cologne It is administrative and cultural centre of area Rhine-Ruhr.

==History==
===Early development===
When the Roman Empire was strengthening its position throughout Europe, a few Germanic tribes clung on in marshy territory off the eastern banks of the Rhine. In the 7th and 8th centuries, the odd farming or fishing settlement could be found at the point where the small river Düssel flows into the Rhine. It was from such settlements that the city of Düsseldorf grew.


The first written mention of Düsseldorf (then called &quot;Dusseldorp&quot; in the local Low Rhenish dialect) dates back to 1135. Under Emperor Friedrich Barbarossa the small town of Kaiserswerth to the north of Düsseldorf became a well-fortified outpost, where soldiers kept a watchful eye on every movement on the Rhine. Kaiserswerth eventually became a suburb of Düsseldorf in 1929. 

In 1186, Düsseldorf came under the rule of the Counts of Berg. 14 August 1288 is one of the most important dates in the history of Düsseldorf, the day the sovereign Count Adolf VIII of Berg granted town privileges to the village on the banks of the Düssel. Before this, a bloody struggle for power had taken place between the Archbishop of Cologne and his allies arrayed against the count of Berg and other local powers, culminating in the Battle of Worringen. The Archbishop of Cologne&#x27;s forces were wiped out by the forces of the count of Berg, who were supported by citizens and farmers of Cologne and Düsseldorf, paving the way for Düsseldorf&#x27;s elevation to city status, which is commemorated today by a monument on the Burgplatz. 

After this battle the relationship between Cologne and Düsseldorf deteriorated, because they were commercial rivals; it is often said that there is a kind of hostility between the citizens of Cologne and Düsseldorf. Today, it finds its expression mainly in a humorous form (especially during the Rhineland &quot;Karneval&quot;) and in sports.

The custom of turning cartwheels is credited to the children of Düsseldorf. There are variations of the origin of the cartwheeling children. Today the symbol (Der Radschläger) represents the story and every year the Düsseldorfers celebrate by having a cartwheeling contest. 

A market square sprang up on the banks of the Rhine and the square was protected by city walls on all four sides. In 1380, the dukes of Berg moved their seat to the town and Düsseldorf was made regional capital of the Duchy of Berg. During the following centuries several famous landmarks were built, including the . In 1609, the ducal line of the United Duchies of Jülich-Cleves-Berg died out, and after a violent struggle over succession, Jülich and Berg fell to the Wittelsbach Counts of Palatinate-Neuburg, who made Düsseldorf their main domicile, even after they inherited the Electorate of the Palatinate, in 1685, becoming now Prince-electors as Electors Palatine.

Under the art-loving Johann Wilhelm II (r. 1690–1716), a vast art gallery, with a huge selection of paintings and sculptures, was housed in the &quot;Stadtschloss&quot; (city castle). After his death, the city fell on hard times again, especially after Elector Charles Theodore inherited Bavaria and moved the electoral court to Munich. With him he took the art collection, which became part of what is now the Alte Pinakothek in Munich. 

Destruction and poverty struck Düsseldorf after the Napoleonic Wars. Napoleon made Berg a Grand Duchy and Düsseldorf its capital. Johann Devaranne, a leader of Solingen&#x27;s resistance to Napoleon&#x27;s conscription decrees, was executed here in 1813. 

After Napoleon&#x27;s defeat, the whole Rhineland including Berg was given to the Kingdom of Prussia in 1815. The Rhine Province&#x27;s parliament was established in Düsseldorf. By the mid-19th century, Düsseldorf enjoyed a revival thanks to the Industrial Revolution as the city boasted 100,000 inhabitants by 1882; the figure doubled in 1892.

===World War I===
During World War I the Royal Naval Air Service (RNS) undertook the first Entente strategic bombing missions on 22 September 1914, when it bombed the Zeppelin bases in Düsseldorf.

===Weimar Republic===
In 1920, Düsseldorf became the centre of the General Strike that grew out of the resistance to the Kapp Putsch. On 15 April 1920, 45 delegates of the German Miners Union were murdered by the Freikorps.

===World War II===

During World War II, Düsseldorf was the location of a Nazi prison with several forced labour subcamps, five subcamps of the Buchenwald concentration camp for mostly Polish and Soviet prisoners, but also French, Dutch, Belgian, Czech, Italian, Yugoslav, and a camp for Sinti and Romani people (see &quot;Romani Holocaust&quot;). The Rabbi of the Düsseldorf Jewish Community fled to the Netherlands and died in KZ Auschwitz in 1943. 

The city was a target of strategic bombing during World War II, particularly during the RAF bombing campaign in 1943 when over 700 bombers were used in a single night. Raids continued late into the war. As part of the campaign against German oil facilities, the RAF raid of 20–21 February, 1945 on the Rhenania Ossag refinery in the Reisholz district of the city halted oil production there. 

The Allied ground advance into Germany reached Düsseldorf in mid-April 1945. The United States 97th Infantry Division easily captured the city on 18 April 1945, after the local German Resistance group launched Aktion Rheinland.

===German Federal Republic===
In 1946, Düsseldorf was made capital of the new federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The city&#x27;s reconstruction proceeded at a frantic pace and the economic transformation guided Düsseldorf&#x27;s economic growth.

==Geography==

===Physical geography===
Düsseldorf lies at the centre of the Lower Rhine basin, where the delta of the Düssel flows into the Rhine. The city lies on the east side of the Rhine, except District 4 (Oberkassel, Niederkassel, Heerdt and Lörick). Across the Rhine, the city of Neuss stands on the delta of the Erft. Düsseldorf lies southwest of the Ruhr urban area, and in the middle of the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region.

Düsseldorf is built entirely on alluvium, mud, sand, clay and occasionally gravel. The highest point in Düsseldorf is the top of Sandberg in the far eastern part of the city (Hubbelrath borough) at . The lowest point is at the far northern end in Wittlaer borough where the Schwarzbach enters the Rhine, with an average elevation of .

===Adjacent cities and districts===
The following districts and cities border Düsseldorf (clockwise starting from the north): the City of Duisburg, the District of Mettmann (Ratingen, Mettmann, Erkrath, Hilden, Langenfeld, and Monheim), and the District of Neuss (Dormagen, Neuss, and Meerbusch).

===Climate===
The city has an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;, mild in relation to East Germany). Like the rest of the lower Rhineland, Düsseldorf experiences moderate winters with little snowfall and mild to warm summers. The average annual temperature is with an average yearly precipitation of . The dominant wind direction is from the west with velocities in the range of 3 to 4 m/s (7–9 mph), with gusts of 3.5 −4.8 m/s (8–10.7 mph). The wind is calm (defined as being under 2 m/s or 4.5 mph) about 35% of the time, more frequently at night and in the winter.

==Demographics==


With a population of 653,253 within the city boundaries (31 December 2022), Düsseldorf is Germany&#x27;s sixth largest city. Its population surpassed the threshold of 100,000 inhabitants during the height of industrialisation in 1882, and peaked at just over 705,000 in 1962. The city then began to lose residents, with many moving into neighbouring municipalities. However, since the late 1990s, the city&#x27;s population has been slowly rising again.

A total of 109,883 (18%) of Düsseldorf&#x27;s population are foreigners (as of 31 December 2008), the majority of whom come from within Europe (81,742). The largest national minorities are Turks, Greeks, and Poles. Düsseldorf and its surroundings have the third-largest Japanese community in Europe and the largest in Germany (about 11,000 people). 

By 2019, the foreign population of Düsseldorf would grow to 152,255, or 23.6% of the population. As of 2019, 272,982 people, or 42.6% of residents had a migration background.

Düsseldorf has the third-largest Jewish community in Germany, with about 7,000 members.

==Government==
===Boroughs===
Since 1975, Düsseldorf is divided into ten administrative boroughs. Each borough (&quot;Stadtbezirk&quot;) has its own elected borough council (Bezirksvertretung) and its own borough mayor (Bezirksvorsteher). The borough councils are advisory only. Each borough is further subdivided into quarters (&quot;Stadtteile&quot;). There are 50 quarters in Düsseldorf.

===Mayor===
The current mayor of Düsseldorf is Stephan Keller of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), who was elected in 2020.

The city of Düsseldorf is a member of the German North Rhine-Westphalia District, Municipality and City Friends of Pedestrians and Cyclists Working Group, who bestowed upon Düsseldorf the title of &quot;Friend of Cyclists City&quot; in 2007, although the city still has a few gaps in the network of cycle paths in the eyes of many of its citizens.

==Culture and recreation==

Elector Jan Wellem and his wife Anna Maria Luisa de&#x27; Medici of Tuscany, were patrons of Düsseldorf&#x27;s first significant cultural activities in the 17th and 18th centuries. Heinrich Heine, whose 200th birthday was celebrated in 1997 and who originally had a proposed memorial in the city dedicated to him; Clara and Robert Schumann; and Felix Mendelssohn, are the most prominent artists related to the city, which is home to a distinguished Academy of Fine Arts.

The Düsseldorf cultural scene comprises traditional and avant-garde, classical and popular. The world-famous state art collection of North Rhine-Westphalia, the highly acclaimed Deutsche Oper am Rhein (opera), and the Düsseldorfer Schauspielhaus (theatre), artistic home of Gustaf Gründgens, are major elements of Düsseldorf&#x27;s reputation as a centre of the fine arts.

===Beer===

Düsseldorf is well known for its Altbier, a hoppy beer which translates as &quot;old [style] beer&quot;, a reference to the pre-lager brewing method of using a warm top-fermenting yeast like British pale ales. Over time the Alt yeast adjusted to lower temperatures, and the Alt brewers would store or lager the beer after fermentation, leading to a cleaner, crisper beer. The name &quot;altbier&quot; first appeared in the 19th century to differentiate the beers of Düsseldorf from the new pale lager that was gaining a hold on Germany.

Brewers in Düsseldorf used the pale malts that were used for the modern pale lagers, but retained the old (&quot;alt&quot;) method of using warm fermenting yeasts. The first brewery to use the name Alt was Schumacher, which opened in 1838. The founder, Mathias Schumacher, allowed the beer to mature in cool conditions in wooden casks for longer than normal, and laid the foundation for the modern alt – amber coloured and lagered. The result is a pale beer that has some of the lean dryness of a lager but with fruity notes as well.

There are five pub-breweries in Düsseldorf which brew Altbier on the premises: Füchschen, Schumacher, Schlüssel, Uerige and Brauerei Kürzer. Four of the five are in the historic centre of Düsseldorf (Altstadt); the other (Schumacher), between the Altstadt and Düsseldorf Central railway station (Hauptbahnhof), also maintains an establishment in the Altstadt, Im Goldenen Kessel, across the street from Schlüssel.

Each (except Brauerei Kürzer) produces a special, secret, seasonal &quot;Sticke&quot; version in small quantities, though the names vary: Schlüssel spells it &quot;Stike&quot;, without the &quot;c&quot;, while Schumacher calls its special beer &quot;Latzenbier&quot;, meaning &quot;slat beer&quot;, possibly because the kegs from which it was poured had been stored on raised shelves. Füchschen&#x27;s seasonal is its Weihnachtsbier (Christmas beer), available in bottles starting mid-November, and served in the brewpub on Christmas Eve.

===Music and nightlife===

Düsseldorf has been home to a number of influential music artists and bands, particularly in the electronic and krautrock genres, with Kraftwerk being the most prominent example. As one source describes, &quot;This is the place where Neu! conceived the motorik beat, Harmonia dreamed up ambient, Die Krupps expanded the idea of industrial, and where those brilliant mensch-maschines Kraftwerk, declared: &#x27;We are the robots&#x27;.&quot;

Since the 1950s the &quot;Kom(m)ödchen&quot; has been one of the most prominent political cabarets of Germany. The city&#x27;s best-known contribution to the culture of modern popular music is the influential avant-garde electronic band Kraftwerk. Formed by two Düsseldorf-born musicians, Kraftwerk is internationally known as the most significant band in the history of post-war German music and as pioneers in electronic music. 

Other influential musical groups originating from Düsseldorf include Neu!, formed in 1971 by Klaus Dinger and Michael Rother, after their split from Kraftwerk, and La Düsseldorf, also formed by Dinger in 1976 shortly after Neu! disbanded. Both groups had a significant influence on a variety of subsequent rock, post-punk, and electronic music artists.

Internationally known power metal band Warlock was formed in Düsseldorf in 1982. Its frontwoman, Doro Pesch, has had a successful solo career in Europe and Asia since Warlock ended. The punk band Die Toten Hosen, the electronic act D.A.F., as well as the electronic/industrial pioneers Die Krupps, all originated in Düsseldorf. 

Düsseldorf appears in several songs, including &quot;Düsseldorf&quot; by the British indie band Teleman and &quot;Wärst du doch in Düsseldorf geblieben&quot; by Danish singer Dorthe Kollo.

=== Fashion ===
Düsseldorf has been the fashion capital of Germany for decades; it is also a major cultural center for the art scene. Berlin, Germany&#x27;s &#x27;fashion capital&#x27; until 1945, lost its position because of its special location within the Soviet occupation zone. After the monetary reform of June 20, 1948, fashionable clothes trends gained importance. Igedo organised fashion shows staged in Düsseldorf starting in March 1949.

There are a number of schools dedicated to fashion design in Düsseldorf, among them &quot;Akademie Mode &amp; Design&quot; (de), &quot;Design Department&quot;, and &quot;Mode Design College&quot;.

===Carnival===
One of the biggest cultural events in Düsseldorf is the &quot;Karneval&quot; (also referred to as the &quot;fifth season&quot;) which starts every year on 11 November at 11:11 a.m., and reaches its climax on &quot;Rosenmontag&quot; (Rose Monday), featuring a huge parade through the streets of Düsseldorf. &quot;Karneval&quot; ends on &quot;Aschermittwoch&quot; (Ash Wednesday).

===Düsseldorf&#x27;s cartwheeler===

The &quot;Düsseldorfer Radschläger&quot; (&quot;boy who does cartwheels&quot;) is said to be the city&#x27;s oldest tradition. The symbol of the cartwheeler can be found on souvenirs and various things in Düsseldorf have cartwheelers to thank for their names.

==== Legends of its origin and history ====

The tradition cannot be linked to one specific historical event. Instead, there are several stories surrounding the beginnings of the Düsseldorf cartwheelers. Probably the most well known version is the Battle of Worringen. In the battle of 1288, Count Adolf devastatingly defeated the Archbishop of Cologne. As a consequence of this victory, Düsseldorf obtained town privileges. Inhabitants, especially children, ran joyfully on the streets and performed cartwheels.

Another story talks about a wedding procession during which one of the wheels of the wedding carriage broke. In order to fend off the threat of bad luck, a boy supposedly jumped up to the carriage, took hold of the wheel and thus became a living part of the wheel. Whether the story is about the marriage of Jan Wellem and Anna Maria Luisa de&#x27; Medici or the wedding of Margravine Jakobea of Baden and Johann Wilhelm is debatable.

Another story gives an account of the wedding between Margrave Jacobe von Baden and Johann Wilhelm in 1585. According to legend, she felt miserable about her marriage, but the cartwheelers who displayed their skills next to her carriage were able to make her smile. Numerous travelers were attracted to the city by great exhibitions – the forerunner of today&#x27;s fairs – between the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. During this time the children who did cartwheels found out that it was a profitable source of income. The bourgeoisie accepted this in good humour as a symbolic act of local patriotism. In the beginning the lads shouted &quot;för eene Penning schlage ich das Rad&quot; (a cartwheel for a penny). 

The Jan Wellem monument returned to Düsseldorf at the end of the Second World War. The procession was accompanied by torches, fanfares and cartwheeling boys.

=====Cartwheelers in the cityscape=====
Cartwheelers can be found at several fountains within the city and near many small landmarks. The most famous is Cartwheeler&#x27;s Fountain in &quot;Burgplatz&quot; (de) with an inscription of a quote by Hans Müller-Schlösser: &quot;Radschläger wolle mer blieve, wie jeck et de Minschen och drieve&quot; (We will always remain cartwheelers, however crazy it drives people.) The fountain was designed by Alfred Zschorsch in 1954 and donated by &quot;Heimatverein Düsseldorfer Jonges&quot;, which is a club devoted to the maintenance of local and regional traditions. There are other cartwheelers that decorate storm drains and the door knocker on the Church of Lambertus, designed by Friedrich Becker. He created the cartwheeler in front of the Schadow Arcades.

The tradition has been kept alive by the &quot;Alde Düsseldorfer Bürgergesellschaft von 1920 e. V.&quot;, a society founded in 1920, which organized the first cartwheeler competition on 17 October 1937. This event has been held annually since 1971 in cooperation with the &quot;Stadtsparkasse&quot; (a local bank). Formerly held in the &quot;Königsallee&quot;, it has taken place since 2006 on the &quot;Rheinwerft&quot;, near the old part of town. This is a fixed date in the city&#x27;s calendar of events. About 500 boys regularly participate in the event and girls have also taken part since 1971. In an art project &quot;Radschläger-Kunst&quot; (Cartwheeler Art) launched in 2001, over 100 cartwheeler sculptures were designed by various artists. The door knocker on the Church of Lambertus served as a model for the sculptures that are high, wide and deep. They were positioned around the city centre. Some of the sculptures have been auctioned off to companies and private owners.

=== Christmas market ===
Every Christmas, the city of Düsseldorf uses the city centre to host one of the largest Christmas gatherings in Germany. The Christmas festival occurs every year from 17 November until 23 December. This Christmas festival is responsible for a large portion of tourism every year as many people from nearby areas come to the city to drink mulled wine and hot chocolate and watch craftsmen blow glass and create art. The event takes place among many small wooden buildings all clustered in the middle of the city for all the citizens to enjoy. The event, to many visitors, has an old European feel, but is very lively.

===Cuisine===

Traditional meals in the region are Rheinischer Sauerbraten (a beef roast and sometimes horse marinated for a few days in vinegar and spices served with gravy and raisins) and Heaven and Earth (Himmel und Äd; black pudding with stewed apples mixed with mashed potatoes). In winter the people like to eat Muscheln Rheinischer Art (Rhenish-style mussels) as well as Reibekuchen (fried potato pancake served with apple sauce). Also a special meal: Düsseldorfer Senfrostbraten (Steaks roasted with Düsseldorf mustard on top).

Düsseldorf is known for its strong Dijon-like mustard served in a traditional pot called &quot;Mostertpöttche&quot;, which was immortalised in a still life by Vincent van Gogh in 1884.

The Rhine Metropolis is one of the most diverse areas in terms of culinary diversity. Düsseldorf, with the third largest Japanese community in Europe, not only provides a wide range of cuisine but also has a solid foundation of authentic Asian food in the city. Düsseldorf&#x27;s exceptional cuisine has been recognized by the worldwide leading travel guide Lonely Planet. Along with a broad range of diverse cultural cuisine, Düsseldorf is also home to various Michelin starred restaurants that are world renowned.

Local specialties include:

Halve Hahn – this dish is made from a half a double rye roll, which is another of the specialties of Düsseldorf, buttered, with a thick slice of aged Gouda cheese, onions, mustard, ground paprika and sour pickles.

Himmel un Aad – a dish of mashed potatoes and apples along with slices of blutwurst. Caramelized onions are usually served with this meal.

Reibekuchen is another famous dish from Düsseldorf; this dish is usually drizzled with Rübensyrup (beet syrup) and is served on pumpernickel slices along with applesauce.

===Literature===
The &quot;Förderpreis für Literatur der Landeshauptstadt Düsseldorf&quot; is a German Literary award donated by the City of Düsseldorf in Northrhine-Westphalia. The Prize for Literature in support of the City of Düsseldorf is awarded since 1972 by the Council of the City due to the decisions of the courts.

The &quot;Förderpreis für Literatur der Landeshauptstadt Düsseldorf&quot; is given once a year to artists and groups, especially to the areas of poetry, writing, review and translation.

===Rivalry with Cologne===

Düsseldorf and Cologne have had a &quot;fierce regional rivalry&quot;. The rivalry includes carnival parades, football, ice hockey and beer. People in Cologne prefer Kölsch while people in Düsseldorf prefer Altbier. Some Waiters and patrons will &quot;scorn&quot; and make a &quot;mockery&quot; of people who order Alt beer in Cologne and Kölsch in Düsseldorf. The rivalry has been described as a &quot;love-hate relationship&quot;.

<text>The Battle of Nanking (or Nanjing) was fought in early December 1937 during the Second Sino-Japanese War between the Chinese National Revolutionary Army and the Imperial Japanese Army for control of Nanjing (), the capital of the Republic of China.

Following the outbreak of war between Japan and China in July 1937, the Japanese and Chinese forces engaged in the vicious three-month Battle of Shanghai, where both sides suffered heavy casualties. The Japanese eventually won the battle, forcing the Chinese army into a withdrawal. Capitalizing on their victory, the Japanese officially authorized a campaign to capture Nanjing. The task of occupying Nanjing was given to General Iwane Matsui, the commander of Japan&#x27;s Central China Area Army, who believed that the capture of Nanjing would force China to surrender and thus end the war. Chinese leader Chiang Kai-shek ultimately decided to defend the city and appointed Tang Shengzhi to command the Nanjing Garrison Force, a hastily assembled army of local conscripts and the remnants of the Chinese units who had fought in Shanghai.

In a five-week campaign between November 11 and December 9, the Japanese army marched from Shanghai to Nanjing at a rapid pace, pursuing the retreating Chinese army and overcoming all Chinese resistance in its way. The campaign was marked by tremendous brutality and destruction, with increasing levels of atrocities committed by Japanese forces against the local population, while Chinese forces implemented scorched earth tactics to slow the Japanese advances.

Nevertheless, by December 9 the Japanese had reached the last line of defense, the Fukuo Line, behind which lay Nanjing&#x27;s fortified walls. On December 10 Matsui ordered an all-out attack on Nanjing, and after two days of intense fighting Chiang decided to abandon the city. Before fleeing, Tang ordered his men to launch a concerted breakout of the Japanese siege, but by this time Nanjing was largely surrounded and its defenses were at the breaking point. Most of Tang&#x27;s troops collapsed in a disorganized rout. While some units were able to escape, many more were caught in the death trap the city had become. By December 13, Nanjing had fallen to the Japanese.

Following the capture of the city, Japanese forces massacred Chinese prisoners of war, murdered civilians, and committed acts of looting, torture, and rape in the Nanjing Massacre. Though Japan&#x27;s victory excited and emboldened them, the subsequent massacre tarnished their reputation in the eyes of the world. Contrary to Matsui&#x27;s expectations, China did not surrender and the Second Sino-Japanese War continued for another eight years, leading to an eventual Chinese victory.

==Background==
===Japan&#x27;s decision to capture Nanjing===
The conflict which would become known as the Second Sino-Japanese War started on July 7, 1937, with a skirmish at Marco Polo Bridge which escalated rapidly into a full-scale war in northern China between the armies of China and Japan. China, however, wanted to avoid a decisive confrontation in the north and so instead opened a second front by attacking Japanese units in Shanghai in central China. The Japanese responded by dispatching the Shanghai Expeditionary Army (SEA), commanded by General Iwane Matsui, to drive the Chinese Army from Shanghai. Intense fighting in Shanghai forced Japan&#x27;s Army General Staff, which was in charge of military operations, to repeatedly reinforce the SEA, and finally on November 9 an entirely new army, the 10th Army commanded by Lieutenant General Heisuke Yanagawa, was also landed at Hangzhou Bay just south of Shanghai.

Although the arrival of the 10th Army succeeded at forcing the Chinese Army to retreat from Shanghai, the Japanese Army General Staff had decided to adopt a policy of non-expansion of hostilities with the aim of ending the war. On November 7 its &quot;de facto&quot; leader Deputy Chief of Staff Hayao Tada laid down an &quot;operation restriction line&quot; preventing its forces from leaving the vicinity of Shanghai, or more specifically from going west of the Chinese cities of Suzhou and Jiaxing. The city of Nanjing is roughly west of Shanghai.

However, a major rift of opinion existed between the Japanese government and its two field armies, the SEA and 10th Army, which as of November were both nominally under the control of the Central China Area Army led by SEA commander Matsui. Matsui made clear to his superiors even before he left for Shanghai that he wanted to march on Nanjing. He was convinced that the conquest of the Chinese capital city of Nanjing would provoke the fall of the entire Nationalist Government of China and thus hand Japan a quick and complete victory in its war on China. Yanagawa was likewise eager to conquer Nanjing and both men chafed under the operation restriction line that had been imposed on them by the Army General Staff.

On November 19 Yanagawa ordered his 10th Army to pursue retreating Chinese forces across the operation restriction line to Nanjing, a flagrant act of insubordination. When Tada discovered this the next day he ordered Yanagawa to stop immediately, but was ignored. Matsui made some effort to restrain Yanagawa, but also told him that he could send some advance units beyond the line. In fact, Matsui was highly sympathetic with Yanagawa&#x27;s actions and a few days later on November 22 Matsui issued an urgent telegram to the Army General Staff insisting that &quot;To resolve this crisis in a prompt manner we need to take advantage of the enemy&#x27;s present declining fortunes and conquer Nanking ... By staying behind the operation restriction line at this point we are not only letting our chance to advance slip by, but it is also having the effect of encouraging the enemy to replenish their fighting strength and recover their fighting spirit and there is a risk that it will become harder to completely break their will to make war.&quot;

Meanwhile, as more and more Japanese units continued to slip past the operation restriction line, Tada was also coming under pressure from within the Army General Staff. Many of Tada&#x27;s colleagues and subordinates, including the powerful Chief of the General Staff Operations Division Sadamu Shimomura, had come around to Matsui&#x27;s viewpoint and wanted Tada to approve an attack on Nanjing. On November 24 Tada finally relented and abolished the operation restriction line &quot;owing to circumstances beyond our control&quot;, and then several days later he reluctantly approved the operation to capture Nanjing. Tada flew to Shanghai in person on December 1 to deliver the order, though by then his own armies in the field were already well on their way to Nanjing.

===China&#x27;s decision to defend Nanjing===
On November 15, near the end of the Battle of Shanghai, Chiang Kai-shek convened a meeting of the Military Affairs Commission&#x27;s Supreme National Defense Council to undertake strategic planning, including a decision on what to do in case of a Japanese attack on Nanjing. Here Chiang insisted fervently on mounting a sustained defense of Nanjing. Chiang argued, just as he had during the Battle of Shanghai, that China would be more likely to receive aid from the great powers, possibly at the ongoing Nine Power Treaty Conference, if it could prove on the battlefield its will and capacity to resist the Japanese. He also noted that holding onto Nanjing would strengthen China&#x27;s hand in peace talks which he wanted the German ambassador Oskar Trautmann to mediate.

Chiang ran into stiff opposition from his officers, including the powerful Chief of Staff of the Military Affairs Commission He Yingqin, the Deputy Chief of Staff Bai Chongxi, the head of the Fifth War Zone Li Zongren, and his German advisor Alexander von Falkenhausen. They argued that the Chinese Army needed more time to recover from its losses at Shanghai, and pointed out that Nanjing was highly indefensible topographically. The mostly gently sloping terrain in front of Nanjing would make it easy for the attackers to advance on the city, while the Yangtze River behind Nanjing would cut off the defenders&#x27; retreat.

Chiang, however, had become increasingly agitated over the course of the Battle of Shanghai, even angrily declaring that he would stay behind in Nanjing alone and command its defense personally. But just when Chiang believed himself completely isolated, General Tang Shengzhi, an ambitious senior member of the Military Affairs Commission, spoke out in defense of Chiang&#x27;s position, although accounts vary on whether Tang vociferously jumped to Chiang&#x27;s aid or only reluctantly did so. Seizing the opportunity Tang had given him, Chiang responded by organizing the Nanjing Garrison Force on November 20 and officially making Tang its commander on November 25. The orders Tang received from Chiang on November 30 were to &quot;defend the established defense lines at any cost and destroy the enemy&#x27;s besieging force&quot;.

Though both men publicly declared that they would defend Nanjing &quot;to the last man&quot;, they were aware of their precarious situation. On the same day that the Garrison Force was established Chiang officially moved the capital of China from Nanjing to Chongqing deep in China&#x27;s interior. Further, both Chiang and Tang would at times give contradictory instructions to their subordinates on whether their mission was to defend Nanjing to the death or merely delay the Japanese advance.

==Prelude==
===China&#x27;s defense preparations===

Following the Manchurian Incident of 1931, the Chinese government began a fast track national defense program with massive construction of primary and auxiliary air force bases around the capital of Nanjing including Jurong Airbase, completed in 1934, from which to facilitate aerial defense as well as launching counter-strikes against enemy incursions; on August 15, 1937, the IJN launched the first of many heavy &quot;schnellbomber&quot; (fast bomber) raids against Jurong Airbase using the advanced G3Ms based upon Giulio Douhet&#x27;s blitz-attack concept in an attempt to neutralize the Chinese Air Force fighters guarding the capital city, but was severely repulsed by the unexpected heavy resistance and performance of the Chinese fighter pilots stationed at Jurong, and suffering almost 50% loss rate.

On November 20 the Chinese Army and teams of conscripted laborers began to hurriedly bolster Nanjing&#x27;s defenses both inside and outside the city. Nanjing itself was surrounded by formidable stone walls stretching almost around the entire city. The walls, which had been constructed hundreds of years earlier during the Ming Dynasty, rose up to in height, were thick, and had been studded with machine gun emplacements. By December 6 all the gates into the city had been closed and then barricaded with an additional layer of sandbags and concrete thick.

Outside the walls a series of semicircular defense lines were constructed in the path of the Japanese advance, most notably an outer one about from the city and an inner one directly outside the city known as the Fukuo Line, or multiple positions line. The Fukuo Line, a sprawling network of trenches, moats, barbed wire, mine fields, gun emplacements, and pillboxes, was to be the final defense line outside Nanjing&#x27;s city walls. There were also two key high points of land on the Fukuo Line, the peaks of Zijinshan to the northeast and the plateau of Yuhuatai to the south, where fortification was especially dense. In order to deny the Japanese invaders any shelter or supplies in this area, Tang adopted a strategy of scorched earth on December 7, ordering all homes and structures in the path of the Japanese within one to of the city to be incinerated, as well as all homes and structures near roadways within of the city.

===China&#x27;s forces===
The defending army, the Nanjing Garrison Force, was on paper a formidable army of thirteen divisions, including three elite German-trained divisions plus the super-elite Training Brigade. The reality was that nearly all of these units, save for the 2nd Army Group, had been severely mauled from the combat in Shanghai. By the time they reached Nanjing they were physically exhausted, low on equipment, and badly depleted in total troop strength. In order to replenish some of these units, 16,000 young men and teenagers from Nanjing and the rural villages surrounding it were speedily pressed into service as new recruits.

The German trained units, the 36th, 87th and 88th Divisions, had each taken heavy casualties in Shanghai and saw their elite quality drop as a result. As of December, each division consisted of between 6,000 and 7,000 troops, of which roughly half were raw recruits. In addition to these units, the defenders of Nanjing and the outside defensive lines were composed of four Guangdong (Cantonese) divisions in the 66th and 83rd Corps, five divisions and two brigades from Sichuan in the 23rd Group Army, and two divisions from the NRA Central Army in the 74th Corps. Additional units were provided in by the Nanjing Gendarmerie and Nanjing Capital Garrison. However, most of these units had also suffered very high losses from the months of fighting in and around Shanghai. The 66th Corps had been reduced to half its original size, and its two divisions had to be reorganized into regiments. An additional 16,000-18,000 fresh soldiers were brought in from Hankou in the ranks of the 2nd Army, with 80% of their strength composed of recent recruits. However, due to the unexpected rapidity of the Japanese advance, most of these new conscripts received only rudimentary training on how to fire their guns on their way to or upon their arrival at the frontlines.

No definitive statistics exist on how many soldiers the Nanjing Garrison Force had managed to cobble together by the time of the battle. Ikuhiko Hata estimates 100,000, and Tokushi Kasahara who argues in favor of about 150,000. The most reliable estimates are those of David Askew, who estimates via a unit-by-unit analysis a strength of 73,790 to 81,500 Chinese defenders in the city of Nanjing itself. These numbers are backed up by the Nanking Garrison staff officer T&#x27;an Tao-p&#x27;ing, who records a garrison of 81,000 soldiers, a number which Masahiro Yamamoto argues to be one of the most probable figures.

===Japanese mass bombings===
Even before the conclusion of the battle of Shanghai, Japan&#x27;s Navy Air Service was launching frequent air raids on the city, eventually totaling 50 raids according to the Navy&#x27;s own records. The Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service had struck Nanjing for the first time on August 15 with Mitsubishi G3M medium-heavy bombers, but suffered heavy losses in face of the aerial defense from Chinese Air Force Boeing P-26/281 Peashooter and Hawk II/Hawk III fighters based primarily at Jurong Airbase for the defense of Nanjing. It wasn&#x27;t until after the introduction of the advanced Mitsubishi A5M fighter did the Japanese begin to turn the tide in air-to-air combat, and proceed with bombing both military and civilian targets day and night with increasing impunity as the Chinese Air Force losses mounted through continuous attrition; the Chinese did not have the aircraft industry nor comprehensive training regimen to replace men and machines to contend against the ever-growing and ever-improving Japanese war machine.

However, experienced veteran fighter pilots of the Chinese Air Force still proved a danger against Japanese air power; combat aces Col. Gao Zhihang, Maj. John Wong Pan-yang and Capt. Liu Cuigang whom were outnumbered by the superior A5Ms entering Nanjing on October 12, shot down four A5M fighters that day, including Shotai leader W.O. Torakuma who was downed by Chinese fighter ace Col. Gao. Both Col. Gao and Capt. Liu died in non-aerial combat incidents by the following month as they were preparing to receive improved fighter aircraft design in the Polikarpov I-16s.

=== Evacuation of Nanjing ===
In the face of Japanese terror bombing and the ongoing advance of the Imperial Japanese Army, the large majority of Nanjing&#x27;s citizens fled the city, which by early December Nanjing&#x27;s population had dropped from its former total of more than one million to less than 500,000, a figure which included Chinese refugees from rural villages burned down by their own government&#x27;s scorched earth policies. Most of those still in the city were very poor and had nowhere else to go. Foreign residents of Nanjing were also repeatedly asked to leave the city which was becoming more and more chaotic under the strain of bombings, fires, looting by criminals, and electrical outages, but those few foreigners brave enough to stay behind strived to find a way to help the Chinese civilians who had been unable to leave. In late-November a group of them led by German citizen John Rabe established the Nanking Safety Zone in the center of the city, a self-proclaimed demilitarized zone where civilian refugees could congregate in order to hopefully escape the fighting. The safety zone was recognized by the Chinese government, and on December 8 Tang Shengzhi demanded that all civilians evacuate there.

Among those Chinese who did manage to escape Nanjing were Chiang Kai-shek and his wife Soong Mei-ling, who had flown out of Nanjing on a private plane just before the crack of dawn on December 7. The mayor of Nanjing and most of the municipal government left the same day, entrusting management of the city to the Nanjing Garrison Force.

== Japanese advance on Nanjing (November 11 – December 4) ==
By the start of December, Japan&#x27;s Central China Area Army had swollen in strength to over 160,000 men, though only about 70,000 of these would ultimately participate in the fighting. The plan of attack against Nanjing was a pincer movement which the Japanese called &quot;encirclement and annihilation&quot;. The two prongs of the Central China Area Army&#x27;s pincer were the Shanghai Expeditionary Army (SEA) advancing on Nanjing from its eastern side and the 10th Army advancing from its southern side. To the north and west of Nanjing lay the Yangtze River, but the Japanese planned to plug this possible escape route as well both by dispatching a squadron of ships up the river and by deploying two special detachments to circle around behind the city. The Kunisaki Detachment was to cross the Yangtze in the south with the ultimate aim of occupying Pukou on the river bank west of Nanjing while the Yamada Detachment was to be sent on the far north route with the ultimate aim of taking Mufushan just north of Nanjing.

=== Fighting retreat of the Chinese Army, breaching the Wufu line ===
As of 11 November, all elements of the Chinese army in the Lower Yangtze Theatre were falling back after the Battle of Shanghai. Unlike previous instances during the Shanghai campaign where Chinese retreats were conducted with discipline, the Chinese retreat from Shanghai was poorly coordinated and disorganized, in part due to the sheer size of the operation and lack of prior planning. The orders to retreat had been passed top-down in a haphazard manner, and the Chinese army frequently bogged down under its own weight or became congested at bottlenecks like bridges. Making matters worse were Japanese aircraft constantly harassing the Chinese columns, adding to the growing casualties and mayhem. Despite their losses, the Chinese army managed to escape destruction by the Japanese forces, who were attempting to encircle them in the last few days of the combat in Shanghai.

On 12 November, the Japanese forces deployed in Shanghai were ordered to pursue the retreating Chinese forces. With most Chinese troops melting away into the retreat, many cities and towns were quickly captured by the Japanese, including Jiading, Taicang and Jiashan. Japanese troops from the freshly deployed Tenth Army, consisting of the 6th, 18th, 114th divisions and the Kunisaki Detachment, were eager for combat. However, many of the other Japanese units were exhausted from the fighting in Shanghai, and were slower to follow through with their orders.

Despite the Chinese retreat, the Japanese encountered strong resistance at the Wufu defensive line between Fushan and Lake Tai, which had been nicknamed a &quot;new Hindenburg line&quot; in Chinese propaganda. At Changshu, Japanese forces had to fight slowly through an interlocking system of concrete pillboxes manned by Chinese soldiers fighting to the death, all whilst Chinese artillery bombarded them with accurate fire. The Japanese 9th Division was faced with a similar challenge in Suzhou: contrary to propaganda accounts of the city falling without a fight, Japanese soldiers had to fight through a series of pillboxes in front of the city before painstakingly eliminating pockets of resistance in street fighting. These operations were concluded by 19 November, with some 1,000 Chinese soldiers killed in Suzhou and another 100 artillery pieces captured, according to Japanese records.

By late November, the Japanese army was advancing rapidly around Lake Tai en route to Nanjing. The Chinese, in order to counter these advances, deployed some five divisions of the Sichuanese 23rd Group Army from warlord Liu Xiang&#x27;s forces to the southern end of the lake near Guangde, and two more divisions (the 103rd and 112th) to the river fortress Jiangyin near the lake&#x27;s northern end, which had been the site of a naval battle in August.

=== Battles of Lake Tai and Guangde ===

On November 25, the Japanese 18th Division attacked the town of Sian near Guangde. The Chinese defenders, underequipped and inexperienced troops from the 145th Division, were overwhelmed by Japanese airpower and tanks and hastily fell back. A counterattack on Sian from the 146th Division was repelled by Japanese armor.

On the southwestern edge of Lake Tai, the Sichuanese 144th Division from the 23rd Group Army had dug into a position where the local terrain formed a narrow funnel in the local road. When faced with the advance of the Japanese 114th Division, the Chinese ambushed the Japanese with hidden mountain guns, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese. However, fearing the loss of their artillery from retaliatory enemy attacks, the Chinese officers withdrew their artillery in the heat of battle. As a result, the Chinese infantry were slowly pushed back, and finally broke into a retreat towards Guangde when Japanese troops flanked their positions on the lake&#x27;s shores via stolen civilian motor boats.

The last days of November saw the five Sichuanese divisions fight fiercely in the vicinity of Guangde, but their defense was hindered by divided leadership and a lack of radio communications. The Japanese overwhelmed the Chinese defenders with artillery, and finally forced the 23rd Group Army back on November 30. Sichuanese division commander Rao Guohua, unable to bear the defeat, shot himself the day after the retreat. The 23rd Group Army suffered heavy casualties in this battle, with at least 4,454 killed, wounded, or missing.

=== Battle of Jiangyin ===
On November 29, the Japanese 13th Division attacked the walled town of Jiangyin near the Yangtze River after a two-day artillery bombardment. They were confronted by some 10,000 troops from the Chinese 112th and 103rd Divisions, which were composed of a mix of Manchurian veteran exiles and Sichuanese recruits, respectively. Despite encountering ambushes and difficult terrain in the form of 33 hills around the city, the Japanese were able to advance under the cover of land and naval artillery from their ships on the Yangtze. Chinese coastal batteries mounted on Jiangyin&#x27;s walls retaliated against the Japanese ships, causing damage to several Japanese vessels. To even the odds, Chinese raiders organized suicide mission to infiltrate Japanese lines at night and destroy enemy tanks with explosives. The hills around Jiangyin were the site of vicious fighting, with Mount Ding changing hands several times, resulting in Chinese company commander Xia Min&#x27;an being killed in action.

The Japanese eventually managed to overcome the Chinese defenses through a combination of artillery, aircraft and tanks. The Chinese began a withdrawal on December 1, but poor communication resulted in the 112th Division leaving too soon, resulting in a chaotic retreat for the 103rd Division. Both divisions had suffered heavy losses in the fighting, and only a portion of their original strength (estimated to be between 1,000 and 2,000 men for the 103rd Division) made it back to Nanjing.

During the rest of their advance, the Japanese overcame resistance from the already battered Chinese forces who were being pursued by the Japanese from Shanghai in a &quot;running battle&quot;. Here the Japanese were aided by their complete air supremacy, abundance of tanks, the improvised and hastily constructed nature of the Chinese defenses, and also by the Chinese strategy of concentrating their defending forces on small patches of relatively high ground which made them easy to outflank and surround. Tillman Durdin reported in one case where Japanese troops surrounded some 300 Chinese soldiers from the 83rd Corps on a cone-shaped peak: &quot;The Japanese set a ring of fire around the peak. The fire, feeding on trees and grass, gradually crept nearer and nearer to the top, forcing the Chinese upward until, huddled together, they were mercilessly machine-gunned to death.&quot;

=== Japanese atrocities on the way to Nanjing ===
General Matsui, along with the Army General Staff, had originally envisaged making a slow and steady march on Nanjing, but his subordinates had disobeyed and instead raced each other to the city. The capture of Guangde had occurred three days before it was even supposed to start its planned advance, and the SEA had captured Danyang on December 2 more than five days ahead of schedule. On average, the Japanese units were advancing on Nanjing at the breakneck pace of up to per day. In order to achieve such speeds, the Japanese soldiers carried little with them except weaponry and ammunition. Because they were marching well ahead of most of their supply lines, Japanese troops usually looted from Chinese civilians along the way, which was almost always accompanied by extreme violence. As a Japanese journalist in the 10th Army recorded, &quot;The reason that the [10th Army] is advancing to Nanjing quite rapidly is due to the tacit consent among the officers and men that they could loot and rape as they wish.&quot;

The Japanese advance on Nanjing was marked by a trail of arson, rape and murder. The 170 miles between Shanghai and Nanjing were left &quot;a nightmarish zone of death and destruction.&quot; Japanese planes strafed unarmed farmers and refugees &quot;for fun&quot;. Civilians were subjected to extreme violence and brutality in a foreshadowing of the Nanjing Massacre. For example, the Nanqiantou hamlet was set on fire, with many of its inhabitants locked within the burning houses. Two women, one of them pregnant, were raped repeatedly. Afterwards, the soldiers &quot;cut open the belly of the pregnant woman and gouged out the fetus.&quot; A crying two-year-old boy was wrestled from his mother&#x27;s arms and thrown into the flames, while the hysterically sobbing mother and remaining villagers were bayoneted, disemboweled, and thrown into a nearby creek. Many Chinese civilians committed suicide, such as two girls who deliberately drowned themselves near Pinghu.

Many cities and towns were subject to destruction and looting by the advancing Japanese, including but not limited to Suzhou, Taicang and Jiading. When massacring villages, Japanese forces usually executed the men immediately, while the women and children were raped and tortured first before being murdered. One atrocity of note was the killing contest between two Japanese officers, where both men held a competition to see who could behead 100 Chinese captives the first. The atrocity was conducted twice with the second round raising the goal to 150 captives, and was reported on by Japanese newspapers.

In a continuation of their practices from Shanghai, the Japanese troops executed all Chinese soldiers they captured on their way to Nanjing. Prisoners of war were shot, beheaded, bayonetted and burned to death. In addition, since thousands of Chinese soldiers had dispersed into the countryside, the Japanese implemented &quot;mopping-up operations&quot; in the countryside to deny the Chinese shelter, where all buildings without any immediate value to the Japanese army were burned down, and their inhabitants slaughtered.

== Battle for Nanjing&#x27;s outer line of defense (December 5–9) ==
=== Battles of Chunhua and the Two Peaks ===
On December 5, Chiang Kai-shek paid a visit to a defensive encampment near Jurong to boost the morale of his men but was forced to leave when the Imperial Japanese Army began their attack on the battlefield. On that day the rapidly moving forward contingents of the SEA occupied Jurong and then arrived near Chunhua(zhen), a town 15 miles southeast of Nanjing and a key point of the capital&#x27;s outer line of defense which would put Japanese artillery in range of the city. Chunhua was defended by China&#x27;s 51st Division of the 74th Corps, veterans of the fighting from Shanghai. Despite facing difficulties in using the fortifications around the town due to a lack of keys, the 51st Division had managed to establish a three-line defense with pillboxes, hidden machine gun nests, two rows of barbed wire and an anti-tank ditch.

Battle had already begun on 4 December, when 500 soldiers from the Japanese 9th division attacked Chinese forward positions in Shuhu, a small town several miles away from Chunhua. The Chinese company in Shuhu held out for two days, and at one point deployed a tank platoon against the Japanese infantry, losing 3 armored vehicles in exchange for 40 Japanese casualties. By 6 December, the defenders abandoned their positions, and some 30 survivors fought their way out of Shuhu.

The Japanese pushed to Chunhua, but were faced with heavy resistance by the 51st Division, who inflicted heavy casualties on the Japanese in preplanned kill zones with machine guns and artillery attacks. Nevertheless, Japanese artillery strikes enabled their infantry to capture the first defensive line, while a well-timed attack by six Japanese bombers enabled a deeper breakthrough. The Japanese left flank managed to penetrate behind Chunhua on December 7, but the final breakthrough came on December 8 when an entire regiment of the 9th Division that had lagged behind entered the fray. The Chinese defenders, who had endured incessant shelling for days and suffered more than 1,500 casualties, finally cracked under the renewed Japanese assault and withdrew. In the five-day battle at Chunhua Town, the 51st division suffered more than 2000 casualties including 2 regiment commanders and 4 battalion commanders.

The SEA also took the fortress at Zhenjiang and the spa town of Tangshuizhen the same day. Meanwhile, on the south side of the same defense line, armored vehicles of Japan&#x27;s 10th Army charged the Chinese positions at Jiangjunshan (General&#x27;s Peak) and Niushoushan (Ox Head Peak) defended by China&#x27;s 58th Division of the 74th Corps. The Chinese defenders had dug in on the high ground, and possessed mountain guns powerful enough to destroy Japanese armor. Multiple Japanese tanks were destroyed, and in some cases, valiant Chinese soldiers armed with hammers jumped onto the vehicles and banged repeatedly on their roofs shouting &quot;Get out of there!&quot; Gradually, through its coordinated use of armor, artillery and infantry, the Japanese managed to slowly dislodge the Chinese defenders. On December 9, after darkness fell on the battlefield, the 58th Division was finally overwhelmed and withdrew, having suffered, according to its own records, 800 casualties. By this point, the 58th division had suffered more than 1,700 casualties including 2 regimental adjutants and 5 battalion commanders.

=== Defensive stand of the 2nd Army and the Battle for Old Tiger&#x27;s Cave ===
On December 6, the Japanese 16th Division attacked Chinese positions 14 miles east of Nanjing. The Chinese defenders were composed of fresh troops from the 2nd Army, and had dug in onto a ridgeline to meet the Japanese assault. Japanese aircraft and artillery shelled the Chinese defenses relentlessly, inflicting extensive damage and confusion. The Chinese defenders were also hampered by their own inexperience, with some soldiers forgetting to ignite the fuses of their hand grenades before throwing them. Only a cadre of experienced officers and NCO&#x27;s prevented a total collapse, and enabled the 2nd Army to hold an organized defense for three days until December 9, when they were forced back to Qixia. The fighting had resulted in 3,919 killed and 1,099 wounded for the two divisions of the 2nd Army, an almost four-to-one death-injury ratio. Additionally, the special service company of the 2nd Army suffered 47 killed and 13 wounded.

Meanwhile, the 16th division had also begun probing Chinese positions around Purple Mountain, which was manned by China&#x27;s elite Training Brigade. The Japanese first attacked the Old Tiger&#x27;s Cave on a hill east of Purple Mountain, which was defended by the Training Brigade&#x27;s 5th Regiment. After shelling the peak on December 8, Japanese infantry attacked up the hill&#x27;s slopes, but were cut down by accurate and concentrated fire. On December 9, the Japanese attacked again using smokescreens and air bombardment, but the assault was stopped again when a neighboring Chinese unit counterattacked on the Japanese right flank. However, the 5th Regiment had also suffered heavy casualties in the fighting, losing more than half their men including their commander. In addition, the hill was very exposed and hard to resupply, so the Training Brigade ultimately abandoned the Old Man&#x27;s Cave and retreated to better positions on the Purple Mountain itself.

By December 9, Japan&#x27;s forces had reached Nanjing&#x27;s last line of defense, the daunting Fukuo Line. The stage was set for the final stage of the campaign: the battle for Nanjing itself.

==Final Battle for Nanjing City (December 9–13)==
=== Opening shots ===

In the dawn of December 9, Japanese soldiers from the 36th Infantry Regiment engaged a battalion of the elite Training Division outside the Nanjing city wall near the Guanghua gate (Gate of Enlightenment). The Chinese withdrew into the wall after half had become casualties. When the Japanese attempted to follow, the Chinese exposed their positions with electrical lights and attacked with small-arms fire, forcing the Japanese back.

The Japanese then wheeled up two mountain guns and began shelling the gate, while Japanese aircraft launched several raids in the area, resulting in over 100 Chinese casualties. The Chinese reinforced the gate with troops from the Nanjing Gendarmerie Military Police and a battalion from the elite 88th Division, the latter of which suffered some 300 casualties in further fighting. The Japanese sent engineers to blow holes in the gate, but after three attempts failed to inflict significant damage. Additional Japanese soldiers rushed the gate in support, but most were cut down by Chinese gunfire. At one point, several Chinese defenders launched a raid to burn down a flour mill outside the wall to deny the Japanese an observation point, which they succeeded in accomplishing. Chinese stragglers outside the city wall also attacked the Japanese in the rear, targeting and killing several messengers in the Japanese communication network. By nightfall, the first battle had ended with a stalemate between both sides.

=== Japanese requests for a Chinese surrender ===
At this point General Matsui had a &quot;summons to surrender&quot; drawn up which requested the Chinese to send military envoys to Nanjing&#x27;s Zhongshan Gate to discuss terms for the peaceful occupation of the city, and he then had a Mitsubishi Ki-21 scatter thousands of copies of the message over the city. On December 10 a group of Matsui&#x27;s senior staff officers waited to see if the gate would be opened, but Tang Shengzhi had no intention of responding.

Later that day Tang proclaimed to his men that, &quot;Our army has entered into the final battle to defend Nanjing on the Fukuo Line. Each unit shall firmly defend its post with the resolve to either live or die with it. You&#x27;re not allowed to retreat on your own, causing defense to collapse.&quot; To enforce his orders, Tang deployed the elite 36th division near the Xiaguan docks to ward off any retreat attempts across the Yangtze River, and sent many of the larger vessels away to Hankou. The American journalist F. Tillman Durdin, who was reporting on site during the battle, saw one small group of Chinese soldiers set up a barricade, assemble in a solemn semicircle, and promise each other that they would die together where they stood.
=== Assault on Nanjing ===
At 1:00 pm on December 10, General Matsui ordered all units to launch a full-scale attack on Nanjing. The 16th division immediately assaulted China&#x27;s super-elite Training Brigade on the peaks of Purple Mountain, (Zijinshan), which dominate Nanjing&#x27;s northeast horizon. Clambering up the ridges of the mountain, the men of the SEA had to painstakingly wrest control of each Chinese encampment one by one in bloody infantry charges. Advancing along the south side of Zijinshan was no easier as General Matsui had forbidden his men from using artillery there due to his deep conviction that no damage should come to its two famous historical sites, Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum and Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum.

Also on Nanjing&#x27;s eastern side but further south, other units of the SEA faced the difficult task of fording the large moat standing between them and three of the city gates, Zhongshan Gate, Guanghua Gate, and Tongji Gate, though the speed of Japan&#x27;s earlier advance played in their favor as key Chinese units slated to be deployed here were not yet in position.

=== Attacking the Gate of Enlightenment ===
That evening, Japanese engineers and artillerymen closing in on Guanghua Gate managed to blow a hole in the wall. Two Japanese companies of the 36th Regiment immediately launched a daring attack through the gap and planted a Japanese flag on a portion of the gate, but were immediately pinned down by a series of determined Chinese counterattacks.

The Chinese brought up reinforcements from the 83rd Corps and the elite 87th Division, including artillery, tanks and armored cars. The Chinese attacked the Japanese foothold with a pincer movement, inflicting serious losses on the Japanese, who deployed a third company to reinforce their bridgehead. Chinese soldiers atop the city wall attacked the Japanese from above, hurling down hand grenades and even flaming, gasoline-soaked lumber onto the Japanese defenders, which was only saved from annihilation by timely bursts of concentrated artillery fire from the rest of their division. One of the companies had lost eighty of its eighty-eight men as well as its leader, battalion commander Major Ito. The Chinese for their part had lost several officers and over 30 men killed in its counterattacks.

=== The 88th Division at Yuhuatai Plateau and Zhonghua Gate ===

At the same time, the Japanese 6th Division was storming Yuhuatai, a rugged plateau situated directly in front of Zhonghua Gate on Nanjing&#x27;s southern side. The 6th division&#x27;s progress was slow and casualties were heavy, as Yuhuatai was built like a fortress of interlocking fortifications and trenches, fortified with dense tangles of barbed wire, antitank ditches and concrete pillboxes. Making matters worse was the presence of the German-trained 88th Division, who were apt to counterattack, forcing some Japanese units to spend more time defending than attacking. The Chinese defenders, recognizing the importance of Yuhaitai, had deployed the 527th and 528th Regiment, providing tactical artillery support with two artillery companies. Behind Yuhuatai was Nanjing&#x27;s Zhonghua Gate, which the 88th Division had stationed its barely trained new recruits atop.

The Japanese attacked the 88th division on December 10, but suffered heavy casualties, as they had to fight through hilly terrain covered in barbed wire barricades and tactically placed machine gun nests. Chinese defenders often fought to the last man, with Japanese soldiers noticing that many Chinese pillboxes had been chained from the outside to prevent their occupants from fleeing. The Japanese also encountered problems with advancing too fast at times and bypassing surviving Chinese soldiers, who would then open fire into their flanks and rear. The 88th division also encountered many difficulties for their part, as half of those fighting in the division&#x27;s ranks were raw recruits, and nearly all of its trained officer corps had been wiped out from the fighting in Shanghai. Furthermore, Chinese artillery crews were reluctant to provide effective artillery support, citing a fear of exposing their positions to return fire.

On December 11, the Japanese, frustrated by the lack of progress near the Gate of Enlightenment, attacked the Zhonghua Gate. Japanese aircraft routed Chinese forces in front of the gate, forcing them inside with the Japanese on their heels. When some 300 Japanese soldiers managed to breach the wall, the Chinese mobilized all available forces and forced them out. By the end of the night, the 88th Division had been forced to fall back in front of the city wall, with many of its surviving troops suffering from severe fatigue. The Japanese made an attempt to infiltrate a &quot;suicide squadron&quot; bearing explosive picric acid up to the Zhonghua Gate to blow a hole in it, but it got lost in the morning fog and failed to reach the wall.

On the morning of December 12, the Japanese began to bombard Zhonghua Gate with field artillery and tank fire. Chinese troops who remained posted outside the gate attempted to retreat back inside the city wall, but almost all were killed before they could make it. By noon, Yuhuatai had been overrun and virtually every man of the 88th division defending it had been killed, including three of their four regimental commanders and both of their brigade commanders, but in the process the Japanese had suffered heavy casualties of their own, some 2,240 losses including 566 dead according to their own records.

At noon on December 12 a squad of six Japanese soldiers made it across the moat in a small boat, and attempted to scale the wall at Zhonghua Gate with a bamboo ladder, but were killed by machine gun fire before they reached the wall.

=== Breaching the Nanjing city wall ===
Back at Guanghua Gate, the Japanese attempted to relieve their beleaguered comrades trapped inside, and after two attempts managed to link up with their forces inside. What followed was an artillery duel between both sides, which lasted the entirety of December 12. During the duel, a stray shell severed the telephone line of the Chinese 87th Division, severing their communications to the rear.

Burdened with the fog of war, commanders of the 87th Division were alarmed upon noticing their comrades in the Guangdong 83rd Corps abandoning their positions, but did not immediately retreat due to their prior orders and because Nanjing had become considered a home amongst many soldiers in the division. After some deliberation through the night, the 87th Division, having already suffered 3,000 casualties, abandoned their positions on the Gate of Enlightenment at 2am on December 13 to retreat to the Xiaguan wharfs, leaving some 400 of the most severely wounded who could not walk behind in the city.

The Japanese, having noticed the diminishing Chinese resistance, scaled the city gate at around 4am and found it almost deserted. They killed whatever few Chinese soldiers remained in the area and raised the Rising Sun flag to cheers of &quot;Banzai!&quot; For their bloody efforts, the 36th Regiment had suffered some 275 killed and 546 wounded, per its own records.

Back near Zhonghua Gate, two Japanese regiments had become pinned down by Chinese gunfire and mortars atop the gate. To conceal their movements, a Japanese team set a fire in front of the gate to create a smokescreen, and by 5:00 pm more and more Japanese troops were crossing the moat and swarming Zhonghua Gate by fording makeshift bridges so rickety their engineers had to hold them aloft with their own bodies. Japanese artillery suppressed the Chinese defenders from atop the Yuhaitai heights, and fired so many rounds into the city wall that part of it finally crumbled. The Japanese seized the gate through this opening, and with artillery support beat back all Chinese counterattacks, securing the Zhonghua Gate by nightfall. Meanwhile, just west of Zhonghua Gate, other soldiers also of Japan&#x27;s 10th Army had punched a hole through Chinese lines in the wetlands south of Shuixi Gate and were launching a violent drive on that gate with the support of a fleet of tanks.

At the height of the battle, Tang Shengzhi complained to Chiang that, &quot;Our casualties are naturally heavy and we are fighting against metal with merely flesh and blood&quot;, but what the Chinese lacked in equipment they made up for in the sheer ferocity with which they fought, partially due to strict orders that no man or unit was to retreat one step without permission. Over the course of the battle, roughly 1,000 Chinese soldiers were shot dead by other members of their own army for attempting to retreat.

=== Attacks on the USS Panay and British vessels ===
In the morning of December 12, the American gunboat &quot;USS Panay&quot; was escorting three Standard Oil river tankers on the Yangtze River away from the battle zone. The ship was clearly marked by two large American flags painted on canvas awnings, as well as another cloth flag flying from the bow. 

The &quot;Panay&quot; was about twenty-eight miles upstream from Nanjing when Japanese naval aircraft led by Lt. Shigeharu Murata (who would later lead torpedo bomber squadrons against Pearl Harbor) attacked and bombed the gunboat. The first bomb hit disabled the &quot;Panay&#x27;s&quot; forward gun and snapped its foremast. Several A4Ns also machine-gunned the ship. After twenty minutes of continuous bombing and strafing, the &quot;Panay&quot; had caught fire and was listing to starboard, having been crippled by two bomb hits. The three other river tankers had been beached on the riverbanks. 

The crew and civilians aboard the &quot;Panay&quot;, the vast majority of them injured in the attack, evacuated the sinking ship in two boats. Two newsreel cameramen on board the &quot;Panay&quot; were able to film parts of the attack, at one point capturing footage of Japanese aircraft passing so close to the ship that the pilots&#x27; faces were visible. 

The crew and passengers hid in the reeds of a nearby island, and witnessed a passing Japanese motorboat machine-gun the sinking ship and board it briefly before departing; the American flag had still been flying from the bow at that time. At 3:54pm, the Panay rolled over to starboard and sank. The survivors then made their way to a nearby village, where some of the injured succumbed to their wounds. Two crewmen and a civilian had been killed in the attack, and another forty-three crew and five civilians wounded. 

In addition&quot;,&quot; the &quot;Panay&#x27;s&quot; three consorts, the Standard Oil Company river tankers &quot;Mei Ping, Mei Hsia,&quot; and &quot;Mei An,&quot; had also been struck and severely damaged. The trio of ships had been evacuating about eight hundred Chinese employees of Standard Oil and their families on board, and presumably suffered high losses during the Japanese raid. 

The pilots responsible for the Panay attack would also bomb the British vessel &quot;SS&quot; &quot;Wantung&quot; later that same day. 

An Imperial Army officer in the vicinity, Col. Kingoro Hashimoto, a founder of one of the right-wing secret societies in Japan, also ordered firing on the &quot;Panay&quot; as it was sinking, in additional to several British vessels whose identities he knew, including the &quot;SS Scarab&quot; and &quot;HMS Cricket&quot;. 

Upon receiving complaints that the vessels had clearly displayed the British flag, Hashimoto replied &quot;I do not recognize any flag but my own.&quot; Hashimoto also issued orders for his troops and artillery to fire on all ships on the Yangtze &quot;regardless of nationality.&quot; 

=== Collapse of the Nanjing Garrison Force ===
Backin in Nanjing, the Japanese had gained the upper hand over the hard-pressed and surrounded Chinese defenders. On December 12 the 16th division captured the second peak of Zijinshan, and from this vantage point unleashed a torrent of artillery fire at Zhongshan Gate where a large portion of the wall suddenly gave way. After sunset, the fires that blazed out of control on Zijinshan were visible even from Zhonghua Gate in the south, which had been completely occupied by Japan&#x27;s 6th and 114th division on the night of December 12 to 13. 

Unbeknownst to the Japanese, Chiang had already ordered Tang to abandon the defense. In spite of his earlier promise about holding out in Nanjing to the bitter end, Chiang telegraphed an order to Tang on December 11 to abandon the city. Tang prepared to do so the next day on December 12, but startled by Japan&#x27;s intensified onslaught he made a frantic last-minute bid to conclude a temporary ceasefire with the Japanese through German citizens John Rabe and Eduard Sperling. Only when it became clear that the negotiations could not be completed in time did Tang finally finish drawing up a plan calling for all his units to launch a coordinated breakout of the Japanese encirclement. They were to commence the breakout under cover of darkness at 11:00 pm that night and then muster in Anhui. Just after 5:00 pm on December 12, Tang arranged for this plan to be transmitted to all units, and then he crossed the Yangtze River, escaping through the city of Pukou on the opposite bank of the river less than twenty-four hours before it was occupied by Japan&#x27;s Kunisaki Detachment.

By the time Tang slipped out of the city, however, the entire Nanjing Garrison Force was rapidly disintegrating with some units in open retreat. Furthermore, contact had already been lost with many units (such as the 87th division) who never received Tang&#x27;s message, and thus continued to hold their positions as ordered. However even those that did receive Tang&#x27;s orders faced tremendous difficulties at slipping through the Japanese lines.

=== Unit-by-unit breakout attempts ===
In accordance with Tang&#x27;s orders, the Guangdong 66th Corps under Ye Zhao and elements of the 83rd Corps under Deng Longguang gathered their remaining forces to break through the Japanese lines using a gap in the east, an extremely difficult task given the circumstances. Upon exiting the Taiping Gate, the troops of the Guangdong Army had to navigate both Chinese and Japanese minefields, then move through the countryside using pre-planned escape routes. Despite avoiding roads and Japanese armored patrols, the Guangdong troops were forced to fight through multiple attacks by Japanese units, and suffered many casualties including two divisional chiefs of staff in combat. After a three-day trek through the devastated countryside, the survivors of the two corps regrouped in Ningguo south of Nanjing, before being sent further south. Of the 12,500 men in the two corps at the start of the battle, only some 3,000 or 4,000 of them made it out of Nanjing. According to Ye Zhao, the 159th and 160th divisions of his 66th Corps still had more than 7,800 officers and soldiers after breaking out of the capital.

One of the units that did manage to escape Nanjing intact was China&#x27;s 2nd Army led by Xu Yuanquan, situated just north of Nanjing. Though Xu never received Tang&#x27;s order to abandon the defense, on the night of December 12 he had heard that Nanjing had been captured, and so decided to withdraw on his own accord. Having obtained some 20 private vessels ahead of time, the 2nd Army managed to evacuate 11,851 officers and soldiers, save for the 5,078 casualties already lost in battle, across the Yangtze River just before Japanese naval units blockaded the way.

In addition, some 5,000 men and officers of the 74th Corps were also successfully evacuated across the river, as they had secured a boat for themselves in time. According to the battle report of the 51st division, the division suffered 4,070 killed and 3,785 wounded in Nanjing.

Other units were less fortunate. Near dawn on December 13, a different part of the 74th Corps was destroyed in its attempt to break through Japanese lines along the Yangtze River south of Nanjing. After breaking out, the 103rd division only had 500 troops left. The 112th division was in a worse condition, with only dozens of troops left after crossing the Yangtze River. The regular police which participated in the battle with more than 6,000 men had only 840 who broke out of the city, with the remaining 5,160 presumed dead.

Due to the chaotic nature of the evacuation in the city, only between 3,000 and 4,000 men of the 36th Division and 2,400 men from the Gendarmerie MP units managed to cross the Yangtze as planned, roughly half their strength. According to its own battle report, the 78th Corps (consisting of the 36th division and a supplementary brigade) participated in the battle with 11,967 troops and suffered 228 killed, 285 wounded, and 6,673 missing. By the end of December, the 78th Corps had taken in 4,937 officers and soldiers. Some of its soldiers would gradually return in early 1938, as the number of missing in the statistics of casualties of the 78th Corps for the Shanghai-Nanjing Campaign was at 5,964 missing. The Gendarmerie Military Police participated in the battle with 5,452 officers and soldiers, and suffered 794 killed, 56 wounded, and 2,184 missing. According to the casualty survey compiled by the Gendarmerie Headquarters on 1 July 1939, 3,097 of its men were killed and 14 badly wounded in the battle of Nanjing. 

Due to their heavy losses from combat and proximity to the frontline, only between one and two thousand troops from the 88th Division escaped over the river, as did another thousand troops from the Training Division. The 87th Division, which arrived at the Xiaguan wharves far too late with some 3,000 men, only had 300 survivors.

Sun Yuanliang, commander of the 72nd Corps and 88th division, claimed in his memoir to have led 600 of his men to reach Wuhan in late March 1938. Deputy commander Zhou Zhenqiang recalled the Training Division taking in 4,000 officers and soldiers after crossing the river. Yu Jishi reported taking in 500 troops and 400 rifles from the 87th division. 

During the battle of Nanjing, the Zhenjiang and Jiangning Fortresses exchanged fire with the Imperial Japanese Navy until December 12, breaking out on December 13 after suffering heavy losses from combined assaults of infantry, aircraft, and naval guns. All of the artillery guns and most of their equipment were destroyed or abandoned, and more than 1,000 of the defenders were killed, wounded, or went missing.
Perhaps the worst moments of the rout were in the city&#x27;s northwest suburbs and the Xiaguan harbor itself. Near the Yijiang Gate, a massive crowd of fleeing Chinese soldiers and civilians from the south side of Nanjing, who were fleeing in panicked disarray from the advance of the Japanese, were funneled violently through the exit. However, only half of the gate was open, and combined with the crowd&#x27;s density and disorganized movements, a deadly bottleneck formed that resulted in hundreds of people being crushed or trampled to death, including Colonel Xie Chengrui of the Training Division. Adding to the mayhem were barrier troops of the 36th Division posted atop the gate, who had not received word of Tang&#x27;s orders and mistaken members of the crowd for deserters. Errors in communication resulted in those soldiers opening fire on parts of the crowd. So violent was the clash that a tank charged the barrier troops at around 9:00 pm, crushing many people until it was destroyed by a grenade.

Those who made it to Xiaguan were faced with &quot;unimaginable chaos&quot;, because there was a severe shortage of boats as a consequence of Tang&#x27;s earlier orders, and much of the harbor had been set aflame by Japanese bombardment. As a result, the crowd would frequently fight to clamber aboard what few craft were available, resulting in some becoming so overloaded that they sank midway across the 2 km stretch. Those who rigged improvised rafts rarely made it across the river, as their makeshift vessels frequently broke apart in the water. Many Chinese soldiers who couldn&#x27;t get on a boat took to the Yangtze&#x27;s rough and frigid waters while clinging to logs, furniture and pieces of scrap lumber, though most were quickly swallowed up by the river, or froze to death beforehand due to the icy waters from the winter cold. By the afternoon of December 13, the Japanese had virtually completed their encirclement of Nanjing, and patrols and sailors on naval vessels began shooting at soldiers and civilians crossing the Yangtze from both sides of the river. Others who saw this turned back to the city in despair.

Many of these tens of thousands of Chinese soldiers who could not escape the city responded by casting off their uniforms and weaponry, switching to civilian clothes often by stealing them from passersby, and then desperately seeking sanctuary in the Nanking Safety Zone by mingling with civilians.

The American journalist F. Tillman Durdin &quot;witnessed the wholesale undressing of an army that was almost comic&quot;. &quot;Arms were discarded along with uniforms, and the streets became covered with guns, grenades, swords, knapsacks, coats, shoes and helmets ... In front of the Ministry of Communications and for two blocks further on, trucks, artillery, busses, staff cars, wagons, machine-guns, and small arms became piled up as in a junk yard.&quot;

==The Nanjing Massacre==

=== &quot;Mopping-up operations&quot;: the mass execution of prisoners ===
By the late morning December 13, all major gates to the city had been captured by the Japanese. The fighting in Nanjing did not end on the night of December 12–13, when the Japanese Army took the remaining gates and entered the city. During their mopping-up operations in the city the Japanese continued for several more days to beat back sporadic resistance from remnant Chinese forces. Though Mufushan, just north of Nanjing, was taken by Japan&#x27;s Yamada Detachment without much bloodshed on the morning of December 14, pockets of resistance outside Nanjing persisted for several more days.

Months of fighting had taught the Chinese defenders to expect no mercy if captured by Japanese forces, and many who remained in the city were frantically seeking a way out before it was too late. For some units like those in the Guangdong Army, there were detailed plans establishing a route out of Nanjing. As a result, there were hundreds, or perhaps thousands, of Chinese stragglers who managed to slip through Japanese lines, in groups or individually. However, these plans were only good for those who got word of them, with most being intercepted by Japanese troops or remaining in the city, meeting almost certain death.

Meanwhile, the Japanese units in Nanjing, under the pretense of rooting out military opposition, began conducting thorough searches of every building in Nanjing for Chinese soldiers, and made frequent incursions into the Nanking Safety Zone in search of them. Japanese units attempted to identify former soldiers by checking if they had marks on their shoulders from wearing a backpack or carrying a rifle. However, the criteria used were often arbitrary as was the case with one Japanese company which apprehended all men with &quot;shoe sores, callouses on the face, extremely good posture, and/or sharp-looking eyes&quot; and for this reason many civilians were taken at the same time. According to George Fitch, head of Nanjing&#x27;s YMCA, &quot;rickshaw coolies, carpenters, and other laborers are frequently taken.&quot; Chinese police officers and firefighters were also targeted, with even street sweepers and Buddhist burial workers from the Red Swastika Society being marched away on suspicion of being soldiers.

Chinese prisoners who were rounded up were summarily executed en masse as part of an event that came to be known as the Nanjing Massacre, which the foreign residents and journalists in Nanjing made known internationally within days of the city&#x27;s fall. 

The massacres were organized to kill as many people within a short timeframe, which usually meant rows of unarmed prisoners being mowed down by machine gun fire before being finished off with bayonets or revolvers. In one instance, Japanese troops from the Yamada Detachment and the 65th Infantry Regiment systemically led 17,000 to 20,000 Chinese prisoners to the banks of the Yangtze River near Mufushan and machine gunned them to death. They then disposed of the corpses by burning or flushing them downstream. 

In many other instances, prisoners were decapitated, used for bayonet practice, or tied together, doused in gasoline and set on fire. Wounded Chinese soldiers who remaining in the city were killed in their hospital beds, bayonetted, clubbed, or dragged outside and burned alive. The massacres were usually conducted on the banks of the Yangtze River to facilitate the mass disposal of corpses.

The rounding-up and mass killings of male civilians and genuine POWs were referred to euphemistically as &quot;mopping-up operations&quot; in Japanese communiqués, in a manner &quot;just like the Germans were to talk about &#x27;processing&#x27; or &#x27;handling&#x27; Jews.&quot; The number of prisoners of war executed is disputed, as numerous male civilians were falsely accused of being former soldiers and summarily executed. The International Military Tribunal in Tokyo, using the thorough records of the Safety Zone Committee, found that some 20,000 male civilians were killed on false grounds of being soldiers, whilst another 30,000 genuine former combatants were unlawfully executed and their bodies disposed of in the river. Other estimates vary: Colonel Uemura Toshimichi wrote in his war diary that somewhere between 40,000 and 50,000 Chinese prisoners were executed, but makes no distinction between soldiers or male civilians. Zhaiwei Sun estimates between 36,500 and 40,000 Chinese prisoners of war were executed after capture.

=== The Rape of Nanjing ===

In conjunction with the mass executions of young men, the Japanese also committed numerous acts of murder, torture, rape, looting, and arson during their occupation of Nanjing.

According to the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, the total number of civilians and prisoners of war murdered in Nanjing and its vicinity during the first six weeks of the Japanese occupation was over 200,000 while at least 20,000 women were raped, including infants and the elderly. Recent research estimates up to 80,000 women and children were victimized, as many victims were immediately murdered by Japanese soldiers after their rape. Estimates for the total death toll of the Nanjing Massacre vary widely, from 40,000 at the least to 430,000 at the greatest.

By December 30, most Japanese soldiers had left Nanjing, though units of the Shanghai Expeditionary Army stayed on to occupy the city. The Nanjing Self-Government Committee, a new municipal authority formed from local Chinese collaborators, was inaugurated on January 1, 1938, but it was not until February 25 that all restrictions on the free movement of civilians into and out of the city were lifted.

==Casualties==
The capture of Nanjing had been quicker and easier than the Japanese had foreseen. Excluding the Yamada Detachment, they lost only 1,558 soldiers in battle, plus 4,619 wounded. Recent research however, suggests higher Japanese losses in the five week-long campaign to take Nanjing. According to Benjamin Lai, casualties for the IJA over the entire month-long campaign are estimated at 26,000 killed and wounded, with 18,000 casualties for the X Corps alone between 6 November and 17 December. An additional 624 killed and 876 wounded for the Japanese Navy makes a total of 27,500 Japanese casualties for the month long campaign.

Chinese casualties were undoubtedly significantly higher, though no precise figures exist on how many Chinese were killed in action. The Japanese claimed to have killed up to 84,000 Chinese soldiers during the Nanjing campaign, whereas a contemporary Chinese source claimed that their army suffered 20,000 casualties in the fighting. Masahiro Yamamoto noted that the Japanese usually inflated their opponent&#x27;s body counts while the Chinese had reason to downplay the scale of their loss. Ikuhiko Hata estimates that 50,000 Chinese soldiers were killed in combat during the entire battle whereas Jay Taylor puts the number at 70,000, and states that proportionate to the size of the force committed, such losses were greater than those suffered in the Battle of Shanghai. On the other hand, Chinese scholar Sun Zhaiwei estimates Chinese combat losses at 6,000 to 10,000 men. New York Times correspondent Tillman Durdin estimated some 33,000 Chinese soldiers had died in the city of Nanjing, including 20,000 who had been executed unlawfully as prisoners of war.

The number of Chinese soldiers wounded in action also lacks precise figures, but was undoubtedly also very high. Towards the end of November, wounded soldiers were arriving in Nanjing from the front line at a rate of 2,000 to 3,000 men per day, double the rate of the attrition in Shanghai. Many of these wounded soldiers would not receive adequate treatment due to the poor state of China&#x27;s medical services, and also because Nanjing&#x27;s hospitals were unable to treat so many patients at once. As a result, many injured soldiers were neglected and often succumbed to their wounds, a number estimated by Masahiro Yamamoto to be 9,000 total. Despite the efforts of hospital staff to evacuate as many wounded soldiers as possible during the last days of the battle, many, perhaps the majority of wounded Chinese soldiers were left behind in Nanjing at the mercy of the Japanese. Most, if not all of them, would be executed.

==Aftermath ==

News of the massacre was tightly censored in Japan, where Nanjing&#x27;s capture provoked a frenzy of excitement among the citizenry. Mass celebrations of every sort, either spontaneous or government-sponsored, took place throughout the country, including a number of resplendent lantern parades which were still vividly remembered by onlookers several decades later. F. Tillman Durdin noted even before Nanjing had fallen that &quot;Events in the field have renewed the belief of the Japanese people in the invincibility of their arms.&quot;

An official report of the Nationalist Government argued that an excess of untrained and inexperienced troops was a major cause of the defeat, but at the time Tang Shengzhi was made to bear much of the blame and later historians have also criticized him. Japanese historian Tokushi Kasahara, for instance, has characterized his battlefield leadership as incompetent, arguing that an orderly withdrawal from Nanjing may have been possible if Tang had carried it out on December 11 or if he had not fled his post well in advance of most of his beleaguered units. However, Chiang&#x27;s very decision to defend Nanjing is also controversial. Masahiro Yamamoto believes that Chiang chose &quot;almost entirely out of emotion&quot; to fight a battle he knew he could only lose, and fellow historian Frederick Fu Liu concurs that the decision is often regarded as one of &quot;the greatest strategical mistakes of the Sino-Japanese war&quot;. Still, the historian Jay Taylor notes that Chiang was convinced that to run from his capital city &quot;without a serious fight ... would forever be regarded as a cowardly decision&quot;.

In spite of its military accomplishment, Japan&#x27;s international reputation was blackened by the Nanjing Massacre, as well as by a series of international incidents that occurred during and after the battle. Most notable among them were the shelling by Japanese artillery of the British steamship &quot;Ladybird&quot; on the Yangtze River on December 12, and the sinking by Japanese aircraft of the American gunboat &quot;Panay&quot; not far downstream on the same day. The Allison Incident, the slapping of an American consul by a Japanese soldier, further increased tensions with the United States.

Furthermore, the loss of Nanjing did not force China to capitulate as Japan&#x27;s leaders had predicted. Even so, buoyed by their victory, the Japanese government replaced the lenient terms for peace which they had relayed to the mediator Ambassador Trautmann prior to the battle with an extremely harsh set of demands that were ultimately rejected by China. On December 17 in a fiery speech entitled, &quot;A Message to the People Upon Our Withdrawal from Nanjing&quot;, Chiang Kai-shek defiantly declared that,The outcome of this war will not be decided at Nanking or in any other big city; it will be decided in the countryside of our vast country and by the inflexible will of our people ... In the end we will wear the enemy down. In time the enemy&#x27;s military might will count for nothing. I can assure you that the final victory will be ours.The Second Sino-Japanese War was to drag on for another eight years and ultimately end with Japan&#x27;s surrender in 1945.
