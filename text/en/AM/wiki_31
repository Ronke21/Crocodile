<text>An arc lamp or arc light is a lamp that produces light by an electric arc (also called a voltaic arc).

The carbon arc light, which consists of an arc between carbon electrodes in air, invented by Humphry Davy in the first decade of the 1800s, was the first practical electric light. It was widely used starting in the 1870s for street and large building lighting until it was superseded by the incandescent light in the early 20th century. It continued in use in more specialized applications where a high intensity point light source was needed, such as searchlights and movie projectors until after World War II. The carbon arc lamp is now obsolete for most of these purposes, but it is still used as a source of high intensity ultraviolet light.

The term is now used for gas discharge lamps, which produce light by an arc between metal electrodes through a gas in a glass bulb. The common fluorescent lamp is a low-pressure mercury arc lamp. The xenon arc lamp, which produces a high intensity white light, is now used in many of the applications which formerly used the carbon arc, such as movie projectors and searchlights.

== Operation ==

An &quot;arc&quot; is the discharge that occurs when a gas is ionized. A high voltage is pulsed across the lamp to &quot;ignite&quot; or &quot;strike&quot; the arc, after which the discharge can be maintained at a lower voltage. The &quot;strike&quot; requires an electrical circuit with an &quot;igniter&quot; and a ballast. The ballast is wired in series with the lamp and performs two functions.

First, when the power is first switched on, the igniter/starter (which is wired in parallel across the lamp) sets up a small current through the ballast and starter. This creates a small magnetic field within the ballast windings. A moment later the starter interrupts the current flow from the ballast, which has a high inductance and therefore tries to maintain the current flow (the ballast opposes any change in current through it); it cannot, as there is no longer a &#x27;circuit&#x27;. As a result, a high voltage appears across the ballast momentarily, to which the lamp is connected; therefore the lamp receives this high voltage across it which &#x27;strikes&#x27; the arc within the tube/lamp. The circuit will repeat this action until the lamp is ionized enough to sustain the arc.

When the lamp sustains the arc, the ballast performs its second function, to limit the current to that needed to operate the lamp. The lamp, ballast, and igniter are rating-matched to each other; these parts must be replaced with the same rating as the failed component or the lamp will not work.

The colour of the light emitted by the lamp changes as its electrical characteristics change with temperature and time. Lightning is a similar principle where the atmosphere is ionized by the high potential difference (voltage) between earth and storm clouds.
The temperature of the arc in an arc lamp can reach several thousand degrees Celsius. The outer glass envelope can reach 500 degrees Celsius, therefore before servicing one must ensure the bulb has cooled sufficiently to handle. Often, if these types of lamps are turned off or lose their power supply, one cannot restrike the lamp again for several minutes (called cold restrike lamps). However, some lamps (mainly fluorescent tubes/energy saving lamps) can be restruck as soon as they are turned off (called hot restrike lamps).

The Vortek water-wall plasma arc lamp, invented in 1975 by David Camm and Roy Nodwell at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada, made the Guinness Book of World Records in 1986 and 1993 as the most powerful continuously burning light source at over 300Â kW or 1.2 million candle power.

== Carbon arc lamp ==



In a carbon arc lamp, the electrodes are carbon rods in free air. To ignite the lamp, the rods are touched together, thus allowing a relatively low voltage to strike the arc. The rods are then slowly drawn apart, and electric current heats and maintains an arc across the gap. The tips of the carbon rods are heated and the carbon vaporizes. The rods are slowly burnt away in use, and the distance between them needs to be regularly adjusted in order to maintain the arc.

Many ingenious mechanisms were invented to control the distance automatically, mostly based on solenoids. In one of the simplest mechanically-regulated forms (which was soon superseded by more smoothly acting devices) the electrodes are mounted vertically. The current supplying the arc is passed in series through a solenoid attached to the top electrode. If the points of the electrodes are touching (as in start up) the resistance falls, the current increases and the increased pull from the solenoid draws the points apart. If the arc starts to fail the current drops and the points close again.

The Yablochkov candle is a simple arc lamp without a regulator, but it has the drawback that the arc cannot be restarted (single use) and a limited lifetime of only a few hours.

===Spectrum===
The spectrum emitted by a carbon-arc lamp is the closest to that of sunlight of any lamp. One of the first electric lights, their harsh, intense output usually limited their use to lighting large areas. Although invisible wavelengths were unknown at the time of their invention, unenclosed lamps were soon discovered to produce large amounts of infrared and harmful ultraviolet-radiation not found in sunlight. If the arc was encased in a glass globe, it was found that many of these invisible rays could be blocked. However, carbon-arcs were soon displaced by safer, more efficient, versatile, and easier to maintain incandescent and gas-discharge lamps. Carbon-arc lamps are still used where a close approximation of sunlight is needed, for testing materials, paints, and coatings for wear, fading, or deterioration, or, for example, spacecraft materials that are to be exposed to sunlight at orbits closer than Earth&#x27;s.

The arc consists of pure carbon-vapor heated to a plasma state. However, the arc contributes very little of the light output, and is considered non-luminous, as most of its emission occurs in spectral lines in the violet and UV portions of the spectrum. Most of the carbon spectra occurs in a very broad line centered at 389 nm (UV-A, just outside the visual spectrum), and a very narrow line at 250 nm (UV-B), plus some other less-powerful lines in the UV-C. 

Most of the visible and IR radiation is produced from incandescence created at the positive electrode, or anode. Unlike the tungsten anodes found in other arc lamps, which remain relatively cool, carbon produces much higher resistance and the electrons are forced to enter the anode at the hottest point, generating tremendous amounts of heat that vaporizes the carbon and creates a pit in the anode&#x27;s surface. This pit is heated from 6000 to 6500 degrees Fahrenheit (3300 to 3600 degrees Celsius, just below its melting point), causing it to glow very brightly with incandescence. Due to this, the electrodes were often placed at right angles from each other with the anode facing outward to keep from blocking its light output. Since carbon has the highest melting point of any element, it is the only lamp whose blackbody radiation is capable of nearly matching the Sun&#x27;s temperature of 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit (5500 degrees Celsius), especially when filters are used to remove most of the IR and UV light.

== History ==
The concept of carbon-arc lighting was first demonstrated by Humphry Davy in the early 19th century, but sources disagree about the year he first demonstrated it; 1802, 1805, 1807 and 1809 are all mentioned. Davy used charcoal sticks and a two-thousand-cell battery to create an arc across a gap. He mounted his electrodes horizontally and noted that, because of the strong convection flow of air, the arc formed the shape of an arch. He coined the term &quot;arch lamp&quot;, which was contracted to &quot;arc lamp&quot; when the devices came into common usage.

In the late nineteenth century, electric arc lighting was in wide use for public lighting. The tendency of electric arcs to flicker and hiss was a major problem. In 1895, Hertha Ayrton wrote a series of articles for &quot;The Electrician&quot;, explaining that these phenomena were the result of oxygen coming into contact with the carbon rods used to create the arc. In 1899, she was the first woman ever to read her own paper before the Institution of Electrical Engineers (IEE). Her paper was &quot;The Hissing of the Electric Arc&quot;.

The arc lamp provided one of the first commercial uses for electricity, a phenomenon previously confined to experiment, the telegraph, and entertainment.

=== Carbon-arc lighting in the U.S. ===

In the United States, there were attempts to produce arc lamps commercially after 1850, but the lack of a constant electricity supply thwarted efforts. Thus electrical engineers began focusing on the problem of improving Faraday&#x27;s dynamo. The concept was improved upon by a number of people including and Charles F. Brush. It was not until the 1870s that lamps such as the Yablochkov candle were more commonly seen. In 1877, the Franklin Institute conducted a comparative test of dynamo systems. The one developed by Brush performed best, and Brush immediately applied his improved dynamo to arc-lighting, an early application being Public Square in Cleveland, Ohio, on April 29, 1879. Despite this, Wabash, Indiana claims to be the first city ever to be lit with &quot;Brush Lights&quot;. Four of these lights became active there on March 31, 1880. Wabash was a small enough city to be lit entirely by 4 lights, whereas the installation at Cleveland&#x27;s Public Square only lit a portion of that larger city. In 1880, Brush established the Brush Electric Company.

The harsh and brilliant light was found most suitable for public areas, such as Cleveland&#x27;s Public Square, being around 200 times more powerful than contemporary filament lamps.

The usage of Brush electric arc lights spread quickly. &quot;Scientific American&quot; reported in 1881 that the system was being used in:
800 lights in rolling mills, steel works, shops, 1,240 lights in woolen, cotton, linen, silk, and other factories, 425 lights in large stores, hotels, churches, 250 lights in parks, docks, and summer resorts, 275 lights in railroad depots and shops, 130 lights in mines, smelting works, 380 lights in factories and establishments of various kinds, 1,500 lights in lighting stations, for city lighting, 1,200 lights in England and other foreign countries.
A total of over 6,000 lights which are actually sold.

There were three major advances in the 1880s: FrantiÅ¡ek KÅiÅ¾Ã­k invented in 1880 a mechanism to allow the automatic adjustment of the electrodes. The arcs were enclosed in a small tube to slow the carbon consumption (increasing the life span to around 100 hours). &quot;Flame arc lamps&quot; were introduced where the carbon rods had metal salts (usually magnesium, strontium, barium, or calcium fluorides) added to increase light output and produce different colours.

In the U.S., patent protection of arc-lighting systems and improved dynamos proved difficult and as a result the arc-lighting industry became highly competitive. Brush&#x27;s principal competition was from the team of Elihu Thomson and Edwin J. Houston. These two had formed the American Electric Corporation in 1880, but it was soon bought up by Charles A. Coffin, moved to Lynn, Massachusetts, and renamed the Thomson-Houston Electric Company. Thomson remained, though, the principal inventive genius behind the company patenting improvements to the lighting system. Under the leadership of Thomson-Houston&#x27;s patent attorney, Frederick P. Fish, the company protected its new patent rights. Coffin&#x27;s management also led the company towards an aggressive policy of buy-outs and mergers with competitors. Both strategies reduced competition in the electrical lighting manufacturing industry. By 1890, the Thomson-Houston company was the dominant electrical manufacturing company in the U.S. 

Around the turn of the century arc-lighting systems were in decline, but Thomson-Houston controlled key patents to urban lighting systems. This control slowed the expansion of incandescent lighting systems being developed by Thomas Edison&#x27;s Edison General Electric Company. Conversely, Edison&#x27;s control of direct current distribution and generating machinery patents blocked further expansion of Thomson-Houston. The roadblock to expansion was removed when the two companies merged in 1892 to form the General Electric Company.

Arc lamps were used in some early motion-picture studios to illuminate interior shots. One problem was that they produce such a high level of ultra-violet light that many actors needed to wear sunglasses when off camera to relieve sore eyes resulting from the ultra-violet light. The problem was solved by adding a sheet of ordinary window glass in front of the lamp, blocking the ultra-violet. By the dawn of the &quot;talkies&quot;, arc lamps had been replaced in film studios with other types of lights. In 1915, Elmer Ambrose Sperry began manufacturing his invention of a high-intensity carbon arc searchlight. These were used aboard warships of all navies during the 20th century for signaling and illuminating enemies. In the 1920s, carbon arc lamps were sold as family health products, a substitute for natural sunlight.

Arc lamps were superseded by filament lamps in most roles, remaining in only certain niche applications such as cinema projection, spotlights, and searchlights. In the 1950s and 1960s the high-power D.C. for the carbon-arc lamp of an outdoor drive-in projector would typically be supplied by a motor-generator combo (AC motor powering a DC generator). Even in these applications conventional carbon-arc lamps were mostly pushed into obsolescence by xenon arc lamps, but were still being manufactured as spotlights at least as late as 1982 and are still manufactured for at least one purpose â simulating sunlight in &quot;accelerated aging&quot; machines intended to estimate how fast a material is likely to be degraded by environmental exposure.

Carbon arc lighting left its imprint on other film projection practices. The practice of shipping and projecting motion pictures on 2,000-foot reels, and employing &quot;changeovers&quot; between two projectors, was due to the carbon rods used in projector lamphouses having a lifespan of roughly 22 minutes (which corresponds to the amount of film in said reels when projected at 24 frames/second). The projectionist would watch the rod burn down by eye (though a peephole like a welder&#x27;s glass) and replace the carbon rod when changing film reels. The two-projector changeover setup largely disappeared in the 1970s with the advent of xenon projector lamps, being replaced with single-projector platter systems, though films would continue to be shipped to cinemas on 2,000-foot reels.

<text>Space tourism is human space travel for recreational purposes. There are several different types of space tourism, including orbital, suborbital and lunar space tourism. Tourists are motivated by the possibility of viewing Earth from space, feeling weightlessness, experiencing extremely high speed and something unusual, and contributing to science. 

Space tourism started in April 2001, when American businessman and engineer Dennis Tito became the first ever space tourist to travel to space aboard a Soyuz-TM32 spacecraft. During the period from 2001 to 2009, seven space tourists made eight space flights aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft to the International Space Station, brokered by American company Space Adventures in conjunction with Roscosmos and RSC Energia. Iranian-American businesswoman Anousheh Ansari became the first ever female space tourist in September 2006. The publicized price was in the range of US$20â25 million per trip. Some space tourists have signed contracts with third parties to conduct certain research activities while in orbit. By 2007, space tourism was thought to be one of the earliest markets that would emerge for commercial spaceflight.

Space tourists need to be in good physical form before going to space. In particular, they have to train for fast acceleration or g-forces in a centrifuge and weightlessness by flying in a high-altitude jet plane doing parabolic arcs. They may have to learn how to operate and even fix parts of the spaceship using simulators.

Russia halted orbital space tourism in 2010 due to the increase in the International Space Station crew size, using the seats for expedition crews that would previously have been sold to paying spaceflight participants. Orbital tourist flights were set to resume in 2015 but the planned flight was postponed indefinitely. Russian orbital tourism eventually resumed with the launch of Soyuz MS-20 in 2021.

On June 7, 2019, NASA announced that starting in 2020, the organization aims to start allowing private astronauts to go on the International Space Station, with the use of the SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft and the Boeing Starliner spacecraft for public astronauts, which is planned to be priced at 35,000 USD per day for one astronaut, and an estimated 50 million USD for the ride there and back.

Work also continues towards developing suborbital space tourism vehicles. This is being done by aerospace companies like Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic. SpaceX announced in 2018 that they are planning on sending space tourists, including Yusaku Maezawa, on a free-return trajectory around the Moon on the Starship, however the project was cancelled on June 1st 2024.

==Precursors==

The Soviet space program was successful in broadening the pool of cosmonauts. The Soviet Intercosmos program included cosmonauts selected from Warsaw Pact member countries (Czechoslovakia, Poland, East Germany, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania) and later from allies of the USSR (Cuba, Mongolia, Vietnam) and non-aligned countries (India, Syria, Afghanistan). Most of these cosmonauts received full training for their missions and were treated as equals, but were generally given shorter flights than Soviet cosmonauts. The European Space Agency (ESA) also took advantage of the program.

The US Space Shuttle program included payload specialist positions which were usually filled by representatives of companies or institutions managing a specific payload on that mission. These payload specialists did not receive the same training as professional NASA astronauts and were not employed by NASA. In 1983, Ulf Merbold from the ESA and Byron Lichtenberg from MIT (engineer and Air Force fighter pilot) were the first payload specialists to fly on the Space Shuttle, on mission STS-9.

In 1984, Charles D. Walker became the first non-government astronaut to fly, with his employer McDonnell Douglas paying US$40,000 () for his flight. During the 1970s, Shuttle prime contractor Rockwell International studied a $200â300Â million removable cabin that could fit into the Shuttle&#x27;s cargo bay. The cabin could carry up to 74 passengers into orbit for up to three days. Space Habitation Design Associates proposed, in 1983, a cabin for 72 passengers in the bay. Passengers were located in six sections, each with windows and its own loading ramp, and with seats in different configurations for launch and landing. Another proposal was based on the Spacelab habitation modules, which provided 32 seats in the payload bay in addition to those in the cockpit area. A 1985 presentation to the National Space Society stated that, although flying tourists in the cabin would cost $1 million to $1.5Â million per passenger without government subsidy, within 15 years, 30,000 people a year would pay US$25,000 () each to fly in space on new spacecraft. The presentation also forecast flights to lunar orbit within 30 years and visits to the lunar surface within 50 years.

As the shuttle program expanded in the early 1980s, NASA began a Space Flight Participant program to allow citizens without scientific or governmental roles to fly. Christa McAuliffe was chosen as the first Teacher in Space in July 1985 from 11,400 applicants. 1,700 applied for the Journalist in Space program. An Artist in Space program was considered, and NASA expected that after McAuliffe&#x27;s flight two to three civilians a year would fly on the shuttle. After McAuliffe was killed in the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster in January 1986, the programs were canceled. McAuliffe&#x27;s backup, Barbara Morgan, eventually got hired in 1998 as a professional astronaut and flew on STS-118 as a mission specialist. A second journalist-in-space program, in which NASA green-lighted Miles O&#x27;Brien to fly on the Space Shuttle, was scheduled to be announced in 2003. That program was canceled in the wake of the &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster on STS-107 and subsequent emphasis on finishing the International Space Station before retiring the Space Shuttle.

Initially, senior figures at NASA strongly opposed space tourism on principle; from the beginning of the ISS expeditions, NASA stated it was not interested in accommodating paying guests. The Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics Committee on Science of the House of Representatives held in June 2001 revealed the shifting attitude of NASA towards paying space tourists wanting to travel to the ISS in its statement on the hearing&#x27;s purpose: &quot;Review the issues and opportunities for flying nonprofessional astronauts in space, the appropriate government role for supporting the nascent space tourism industry, use of the Shuttle and Space Station for Tourism, safety and training criteria for space tourists, and the potential commercial market for space tourism.&quot; The subcommittee report was interested in evaluating Dennis Tito&#x27;s extensive training and his experience in space as a nonprofessional astronaut.

With the realities of the post-Perestroika economy in Russia, its space industry was especially starved for cash. The Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS) offered to pay for one of its reporters to fly on a mission. Toyohiro Akiyama was flown in 1990 to &quot;Mir&quot; with the eighth crew and returned a week later with the seventh crew. Cost estimates vary from $10Â million up to $37Â million. Akiyama gave a daily TV broadcast from orbit and also performed scientific experiments for Russian and Japanese companies.

In 1991, British chemist Helen Sharman was selected from a pool of 13,000 applicants to be the first Briton in space. The program was known as Project Juno and was a cooperative arrangement between the Soviet Union and a group of British companies. The Project Juno consortium failed to raise the funds required, and the program was almost canceled. Reportedly Mikhail Gorbachev ordered it to proceed under Soviet expense in the interests of international relations, but in the absence of Western underwriting, less expensive experiments were substituted for those in the original plans. Sharman flew aboard Soyuz TM-12 to &quot;Mir&quot; and returned aboard Soyuz TM-11.

In April 1999, the Russian space agency announced that 51-year-old British billionaire Peter Llewellyn would be sent to the aging Mir space station in return for a payment of $100 million by Llewellyn. Llewellyn, however, denied agreeing to pay that sum, his refusal to pay which prompted his flight&#x27;s cancellation a month later.

== Sub-orbital space tourism ==
=== Successful projects ===
* Scaled Composites won the $10Â million X Prize in October 2004 with SpaceShipOne, as the first private company to reach and surpass an altitude of twice within two weeks. The altitude is beyond the KÃ¡rmÃ¡n Line, the arbitrarily-defined boundary of space. The first flight was flown by Michael Melvill in June 2004, to a height of , making him the first commercial astronaut. The prize-winning flight was flown by Brian Binnie, which reached a height of , breaking the X-15 record. There were no space tourists on the flights even though the vehicle has seats for three passengers. Instead there was additional weight to make up for the weight of passengers.
* In 2005, Virgin Galactic was founded as a joint venture between Scaled Composites and Richard Branson&#x27;s Virgin Group. Eventually Virgin Group owned the entire project. Virgin Galactic began building SpaceShipTwo-class spaceplanes. The first of these spaceplanes, VSS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, was intended to commence its first commercial flights in 2015, and tickets were on sale at a price of $200,000 (later raised to $250,000). However, the company suffered a considerable setback when the &quot;Enterprise&quot; broke up over the Mojave Desert during a test flight in October 2014. Over 700 tickets had been sold prior to the accident. A second spaceplane, VSS &quot;Unity&quot;, completed a successful test flight with four passengers on July 11, 2021 to an altitude of nearly 90 km (56 mi). Galactic 01 became the company&#x27;s first commercial spaceflight on June 29, 2023.
* Blue Origin developed the New Shepard reusable suborbital launch system specifically to enable short-duration space tourism. Blue Origin plans to ferry a maximum of six persons on a brief journey to space on board the New Shepard. The capsule is attached to the top portion of an 18-meter (59-foot) rocket. The rocket successfully launched with four passengers on July 20, 2021, and reached an altitude of . Blue Origin&#x27;s 10th human flight lifted off on the morning of February 25, 2025. Six paying passengers, including a Spanish TV host, and several investors, experienced weightlessness during the 10-12-minute flight and can see Earth against the blackness of space.

=== Canceled projects ===
* Armadillo Aerospace was developing a two-seat vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) rocket called Hyperion, which will be marketed by Space Adventures. Hyperion uses a capsule similar in shape to the Gemini capsule. The vehicle will use a parachute for descent but will probably use retrorockets for final touchdown, according to remarks made by Armadillo Aerospace at the Next Generation Suborbital Researchers Conference in February 2012. The assets of Armadillo Aerospace were sold to Exos Aerospace and while SARGE is continuing to be developed, it is unclear whether Hyperion is still being developed.
* XCOR Aerospace was developing a suborbital vehicle called Lynx until development was halted in May 2016. The Lynx would take off from a runway under rocket power. Unlike SpaceShipOne and SpaceShipTwo, Lynx would not require a mothership. Lynx was designed for rapid turnaround, which would enable it to fly up to four times per day. Because of this rapid flight rate, Lynx had fewer seats than SpaceShipTwo, carrying only one pilot and one spaceflight participant on each flight. XCOR expected to roll out the first Lynx prototype and begin flight tests in 2015, but as of late 2017, XCOR was unable to complete their prototype development and filed for bankruptcy.
** Citizens in Space, formerly the Teacher in Space Project, is a project of the United States Rocket Academy. Citizens in Space combines citizen science with citizen space exploration. The goal is to fly citizen-science experiments and citizen explorers (who travel free) who will act as payload operators on suborbital space missions. By 2012, Citizens in Space had acquired a contract for 10 suborbital flights with XCOR Aerospace and expected to acquire additional flights from XCOR and other suborbital spaceflight providers in the future. In 2012, Citizens in Space reported they had begun training three citizen astronaut candidates and would select seven additional candidates over the next 12 to 14 months.
** Space Expedition Corporation was preparing to use the Lynx for &quot;Space Expedition CuraÃ§ao&quot;, a commercial flight from Hato Airport on CuraÃ§ao, and planned to start commercial flights in 2014. The costs were $95,000 each.
** Axe Apollo Space Academy promotion by Unilever which planned to provide 23 people suborbital spaceflights on board the Lynx.
* EADS Astrium, a subsidiary of European aerospace giant EADS, announced its space tourism project in June 2007.

== Orbital space tourism ==
As of 2021, Space Adventures and SpaceX are the only companies to have coordinated tourism flights to Earth&#x27;s orbit. Virginia-based Space Adventures has worked with Russia to use its Soyuz spacecraft to fly ultra-wealthy individuals to the International Space Station. The tourists included entrepreneur and space investor Anousheh Ansari and Cirque du Soleil co-founder Guy LalibertÃ©. Those missions were priced at around $20 million each. The space industry could soon be headed for a tourism revolution if SpaceX and Boeing make good on their plans to take tourists to orbit.

=== Successful projects ===
At the end of the 1990s, MirCorp, a private venture that was by then in charge of the space station, began seeking potential space tourists to visit &quot;Mir&quot; in order to offset some of its maintenance costs. Dennis Tito, an American businessman and former JPL scientist, became their first candidate. When the decision was made to de-orbit &quot;Mir&quot;, Tito managed to switch his trip to the International Space Station (ISS) aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft through a deal between MirCorp and US-based Space Adventures, Ltd. Dennis Tito visited the ISS for seven days in AprilâMay 2001, becoming the world&#x27;s first &quot;fee-paying&quot; space tourist. Tito paid a reported $20 million for his trip.

Tito was followed in April 2002 by South African Mark Shuttleworth (Soyuz TM-34). In February 2003, the Space Shuttle Columbia disintegrated on re-entry into the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, killing all seven astronauts aboard. After this disaster, space tourism on the Russian Soyuz program was temporarily put on hold, because Soyuz vehicles became the only available transport to the ISS. After the Shuttle&#x27;s return to service in July 2005, space tourism was resumed. The third was Gregory Olsen in October 2005 (Soyuz TMA-7). In September 2006, an Iranian American businesswoman named Anousheh Ansari became the fourth space tourist (Soyuz TMA-9).) In April 2007, Charles Simonyi, an American businessman of Hungarian descent, joined their ranks (Soyuz TMA-10). Simonyi became the first repeat space tourist, paying again to fly on Soyuz TMA-14 in March 2009. British-American Richard Garriott became the next space tourist in October 2008 aboard Soyuz TMA-13. Canadian Guy LalibertÃ© visited the ISS in September 2009 aboard Soyuz TMA-16, becoming the last visiting tourist until Japanese nationals Yusaku Maezawa and Yozo Hirano aboard Soyuz MS-20 in December 2021. Originally the third member aboard Soyuz TMA-18M would have been the British singer Sarah Brightman as a space tourist, but on May 13, 2015, she announced she had withdrawn from training.

Since the Space Shuttle was retired in 2011, Soyuz once again became the only means of accessing the ISS, and so tourism was once again put on hold. On June 7, 2019, NASA announced a plan to open the ISS to space tourism again.

On September 16, 2021, the Inspiration4 mission launched from the Kennedy Space Center on a SpaceX Falcon 9 and spent almost three days in orbit aboard the Crew Dragon &quot;Resilience&quot;, becoming the first all-civilian crew to fly an orbital space mission.

On September 12, 2024, Jared Isaacman and Sarah Gillis performed the first commercial spacewalk during the &quot;Polaris Dawn&quot; spaceflight operated by SpaceX.

=== Ongoing projects ===
* Axiom Space uses Crew Dragon flights contracted with SpaceX to send crews to the International Space Station. Mission 1 flew in April 2022, Mission 2 flew in May 2023 and Mission 3 flew in January 2024. A fourth mission is planned for October 2024. Through these missions, NASA hopes to create a non-NASA market for human spaceflight to enable cost-sharing on future commercial space stations.
* The Boeing Starliner capsule is being developed as part of the NASA&#x27;s Commercial Crew Program. Part of the agreement with NASA allows Boeing to sell seats for space tourists. Boeing proposed including one seat per flight for a spaceflight participant at a price that would be competitive with what Roscosmos charges tourists.
* The Polaris Program: The commander and financier of the Inspiration4 mission, Jared Isaacman, announced plans for a three-mission program called Polaris in February 2022. The first mission, Polaris Dawn, launched four private astronauts in a Crew Dragon spacecraft to earth orbit. Polaris Dawn was a free-flyer mission in which the spacecraft did not perform any rendezvous maneuvers, instead setting the all-time earth orbit altitude record at 1,400Â km, surpassing the 1,373Â km record set by Gemini XI. Polaris Dawn also included the first private extravehicular activity (EVA). The last Polaris program mission is planned to be the first crewed flight of the in-development Starship launch system.

=== Canceled projects ===
* In 2004, Bigelow Aerospace established a competition called America&#x27;s Space Prize, which offered a $50Â million prize to the first US company to create a reusable spacecraft capable of carrying passengers to a Nautilus space station. The prize expired in January 2010 without anyone making a serious effort to win it.
* The Space Island Group proposed having 20,000 people on their &quot;space island&quot; by 2020.
* A United States startup firm, Orion Span announced during the early part of 2018 that it planned to launch and position a luxury space hotel in orbit within several years. Aurora Space Station, the name of the hotel, would have offered guests (at most six individuals) 12 days of staying in a pill-shaped space hotel for $9.5Â million. The hotel&#x27;s cabins would have measured approximately 12.9 metres (43 feet) by 4.8 metres (14 feet) in width.
* Space Adventures Crew Dragon mission: Space Adventures and SpaceX planned to send up to four tourists to low Earth orbit for a few days in late 2021 or early 2022. In October 2021, Space Adventures stated that the mission contract had expired, though the possibility of a future partnership with SpaceX was left open.

== Tourism beyond Earth orbit ==

=== Ongoing projects ===
* A mission with a similar flight profile is planned to have the same flight profile as the now cancelled Dearmoon project, with Dennis Tito and his wife Akiko Tito as two of the passengers.
* Space Adventures Ltd. have announced that they are working on DSE-Alpha, a circumlunar mission to the Moon, with the price per passenger being $100,000,000.

=== Cancelled projects ===
* Excalibur Almaz proposed to take three tourists in a flyby around the Moon, using modified Almaz space station modules, in a low-energy trajectory flyby around the Moon. The trip would last around 6 months. However, their equipment was never launched and is to be converted into an educational exhibit.
* The Golden Spike Company was an American space transport startup active from 2010 to 2013. The company held the objective to offer private commercial space transportation services to the surface of the Moon. The company&#x27;s website was quietly taken offline in September 2015.
* The Inspiration Mars Foundation is an American nonprofit organization founded by Dennis Tito that proposed to launch a crewed mission to flyby Mars in January 2018, or 2021 if they missed the first deadline. Their website became defunct by late 2015 but it is archived by the Internet Archive. The Foundation&#x27;s future plans are unclear.
* Bigelow Aerospace planned to extend their successes with the &quot;Genesis&quot; modules by launching the B330, an expandable habitation module with 330 cubic meters of internal space, aboard a Vulcan rocket. The Vulcan was contracted to boost BA 330 to low lunar orbit by the end of 2022.
* In February 2017, Elon Musk announced that substantial deposits from two individuals had been received by SpaceX for a Moon loop flight using a free return trajectory and that this could happen as soon as late 2018. Musk said that the cost of the mission would be &quot;comparable&quot; to that of sending an astronaut to the International Space Station, about US$70Â million in 2017. In February 2018, Musk announced that the Falcon Heavy rocket would not be used for crewed missions. The proposal changed in 2018 to use the Starship launch system instead. In September 2018, Musk revealed the passenger for the trip, Yusaku Maezawa during a livestream. Yusaku Maezawa described the plan for his trip in further detail, dubbed the #dearMoon project, intended to take 6â8 artists with him on the journey to inspire the artists to create new art.

==Legality==
Under the Outer Space Treaty signed in 1967, the launch operator&#x27;s nationality and the launch site&#x27;s location determine which country is responsible for any damages occurred from a launch.

After valuable resources were detected on the Moon, private companies began to formulate methods to extract the resources. Article II of the Outer Space Treaty dictates that &quot;outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means&quot;. However, countries have the right to freely explore the Moon and any resources collected are property of that country when they return.

===United States===
In December 2005, the US government released a set of proposed rules for space tourism. These included screening procedures and training for emergency situations, but not health requirements.

In 1984, the U.S. Congress passed the Commercial Space Launch Act, which, among other things, encourages space commercialization (51 U.S.C. Â§ 20102(c)).

Under current US law, any company proposing to launch paying passengers from American soil on a suborbital rocket must receive a license from the Federal Aviation Administration&#x27;s Office of Commercial Space Transportation (FAA/AST). The licensing process focuses on public safety and safety of property, and the details can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 14, Chapter III. This is in accordance with the Commercial Space Launch Amendments Act passed by Congress in 2004, which required that NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration to allow paying passengers fly on suborbital launch vehicles at their own risk.

In March 2010, the New Mexico legislature passed the Spaceflight Informed Consent Act. The SICA gives legal protection to companies who provide private space flights in the case of accidental harm or death to individuals. Participants sign an Informed Consent waiver, dictating that spaceflight operators cannot be held liable in the &quot;death of a participant resulting from the inherent risks of space flight activities&quot;. Operators are however not covered in the case of gross negligence or willful misconduct.

In December 2021, the FAA announced that starting in 2022, it would recognize on its official website those who travel to space. &quot;Any individual who is on an FAA-licensed or permitted launch and reaches 50 statute miles above the surface of the Earth will be listed on the site.&quot; The announcement ended the Commercial Space Astronaut Wings program, under which the FAA had offered commercial astronaut wings to individuals on private spacecraft who made it above 50 miles (80 kilometers) in altitude above Earth since 2004.

===Legal issues and challenges===
With the increasing advent of sub-orbital flights, there are growing concerns that the present international framework is insufficient to address the significant issues raised by space tourism. The concerns relate to commercial Liability, insurance, consumer protection, passenger safety, environmental impact, and emergency response.

==List of space tourism trips==
The following list notes each trip taken by an individual for whom a fee was paid (by themselves or another party) to go above the KÃ¡rmÃ¡n Line, the internationally recognized boundary of space at 100 km, or above the US definition of the boundary of space at 50 miles (80 km). It also includes future trips which are paid for and scheduled.

==Criticism of the term &quot;space tourist&quot;==
Many private space travelers have objected to the term &quot;space tourist&quot;, often pointing out that their role went beyond that of an observer, since they also carried out scientific experiments in the course of their journey. Richard Garriott additionally emphasized that his training was identical to the requirements of non-Russian Soyuz crew members, and that teachers and other non-professional astronauts chosen to fly with NASA are called astronauts. He has said that if the distinction has to be made, he would rather be called &quot;private astronaut&quot; than &quot;tourist&quot;. Mark Shuttleworth described himself as a &quot;pioneer of commercial space travel&quot;. Gregory Olsen prefers &quot;private researcher&quot;, and Anousheh Ansari prefers the term &quot;private space explorer&quot;. Other advocates of private spaceflight object to the term on similar grounds. Rick Tumlinson of the Space Frontier Foundation, for example, has said: &quot;I hate the word tourist, and I always will ... &#x27;Tourist&#x27; is somebody in a flowered shirt with three cameras around his neck.&quot; Russian cosmonaut Maksim Surayev told the press in 2009 not to describe Guy LalibertÃ© as a tourist: &quot;It&#x27;s become fashionable to speak of space tourists. He is not a tourist but a participant in the mission.&quot;

&quot;Spaceflight participant&quot; is the official term used by NASA and the Russian Federal Space Agency to distinguish between private space travelers and career astronauts. Tito, Shuttleworth, Olsen, Ansari, and Simonyi were designated as such during their respective space flights. NASA also lists Christa McAuliffe as a spaceflight participant (although she did not pay a fee), apparently due to her non-technical duties aboard the STS-51-L flight.

The US Federal Aviation Administration awards the title of &quot;commercial astronaut&quot; to trained crew members of privately funded spacecraft.

==Attitudes towards space tourism==
A 2018 survey from the PEW Research Center identifies the top three motivations for a customer to purchase a flight into space as:
* To experience something unique ( e.g. pioneering, one of a kind)
* To see the view of Earth from space
* To learn more about the world
The PEW study also found that only 43% of Americans would be definitely or probably interested in going into space. NASA astronaut Megan McArthur has a message to space tourists: spaceflight is uncomfortable and risky, and takes grit.

A web-based survey suggested that over 70% of those surveyed wanted less than or equal to two weeks in space; in addition, 88% wanted to spacewalk, of whom 14% would pay a 50% premium for the experience, and 21% wanted a hotel or space station.

The concept has met with some criticism; GÃ¼nter Verheugen, vice-president of the European Commission, said of the EADS Astrium Space Tourism Project: &quot;It&#x27;s only for the super-rich, which is against my social convictions&quot;.

On October 14, 2021, Prince William suggested that entrepreneurs should focus on saving Earth rather than engaging in space tourism and also warned about a rise in &quot;climate anxiety&quot; among younger generations.

===Environmental effects===

A 2010 study published in &quot;Geophysical Research Letters&quot; raised concerns that the growing commercial spaceflight industry could accelerate global warming. The study, funded by NASA and The Aerospace Corporation, simulated the impact of 1,000 suborbital launches of hybrid rockets from a single location, calculating that this would release a total of 600 tonnes of black carbon into the stratosphere. They found that the resultant layer of soot particles remained relatively localized, with only 20% of the carbon straying into the southern hemisphere, thus creating a strong hemispherical asymmetry. This unbalance would cause the temperature to decrease by about in the tropics and subtropics, whereas the temperature at the poles would increase by between . The ozone layer would also be affected, with the tropics losing up to 1.7% of ozone cover, and the polar regions gaining 5â6%. The researchers stressed that these results should not be taken as &quot;a precise forecast of the climate response to a specific launch rate of a specific rocket type&quot;, but as a demonstration of the sensitivity of the atmosphere to the large-scale disruption that commercial space tourism could bring.

A 2022 study estimated the air pollution impacts on climate change and the ozone layer from rocket launches and re-entry of reusable components and debris in 2019 and from a theoretical future space industry extrapolated from the &quot;billionaire space race&quot;. It concludes that substantial effects from routine space tourism should &quot;motivate regulation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1029/2021EF002612&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education and advocacy===
Several organizations have been formed to promote the space tourism industry, including the Space Tourism Society, Space Future, and HobbySpace. &quot;UniGalactic Space Travel Magazine&quot; is a bi-monthly educational publication covering space tourism and space exploration developments in companies like SpaceX, Orbital Sciences, Virgin Galactic and organizations like NASA.

Classes in space tourism are currently taught at the Rochester Institute of Technology in New York, and Keio University in Japan. Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Florida launched a worldwide space tourism course in 2017.

===Economic potential===
A 2010 report from the Federal Aviation Administration, titled &quot;The Economic Impact of Commercial Space Transportation on the U.S. Economy in 2009&quot;, cites studies done by Futron, an aerospace and technology-consulting firm, which predict that space tourism could become a billion-dollar market within 20 years. Eight tourists reached orbit between 2001 and 2009. In 2011 Space Adventures suggested that this number could reach 140 by 2020, but with commercial crewed rockets only just beginning to enter service, such numbers have yet to be achieved.

According to a 2022 report by Research and Markets, titled &quot;Global Space Tourism Market,&quot; the global space tourism industry is projected to reach 8.67 billion USD by 2030, with an estimated compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37.1% between 2022 and 2030.

<text>Hair: The American Tribal Love-Rock Musical is a rock musical with a book and lyrics by Gerome Ragni and James Rado and music by Galt MacDermot. The work reflects the creators&#x27; observations of the hippie counterculture and sexual revolution of the late 1960s, and several of its songs became anthems of the anti-Vietnam War movement. The musical&#x27;s profanity, its depiction of the use of illegal drugs, its treatment of sexuality, its irreverence for the American flag, and its nude scene caused controversy. The work broke new ground in musical theatre by defining the genre of &quot;rock musical&quot;, using a racially integrated cast, and inviting the audience onstage for a &quot;Be-In&quot; finale.

&quot;Hair&quot; tells the story of the &quot;tribe&quot;, a group of politically active, long-haired hippies of the &quot;Age of Aquarius&quot; living a bohemian life in New York City and fighting against conscription into the Vietnam War. Claude, his friend Berger, their roommate Sheila and their friends struggle to balance their young lives, loves and the sexual revolution, with their rebellion against the war and their conservative parents and society. Ultimately, Claude must decide whether to resist the draft as his friends have done, or to serve in Vietnam, compromising his pacifist principles and risking his life.

After an off-Broadway debut on October 17, 1967, at Joseph Papp&#x27;s Public Theater, and a run at the Cheetah nightclub from December 1967 through January 1968, the show opened on Broadway in April 1968 and ran for 1,750Â performances. Simultaneous productions in cities across the United States and Europe followed shortly thereafter, including a successful London production that ran for 1,997Â performances. Since then, productions have been staged around the world, spawning dozens of recordings of the musical, including the 3 million-selling original Broadway cast recording. Some of the songs from its score became Top 10 hits, and a feature film adaptation was released in 1979. A Broadway revival opened in 2009, earning strong reviews and winning the Tony Award and Drama Desk Award for Best Revival of a Musical. In 2008, Richard Zoglin wrote in &quot;Time&quot; that &quot;Today &quot;Hair&quot; seems, if anything, more daring than ever.&quot;

== History ==
Actors James Rado and Gerome Ragni began writing &quot;Hair&quot; together in late 1964. The main characters were autobiographical, with Rado&#x27;s Claude being a pensive romantic and Ragni&#x27;s Berger an extrovert. Their close relationship, including its volatility, was reflected in the musical. Rado explained, &quot;We were great friends. It was a passionate kind of relationship that we directed into creativity, into writing, into creating this piece. We put the drama between us on stage.&quot;

Rado described the inspiration for &quot;Hair&quot; as a combination of some characters we met in the streets, people we knew and our own imaginations. We knew this group of kids in the East Village who were dropping out and dodging the draft, and there were also lots of articles in the press about how kids were being kicked out of school for growing their hair long. He recalled, &quot;There was so much excitement in the streets and the parks and the hippie areas, and we thought if we could transmit this excitement to the stage it would be wonderful.Â ... We hung out with them and went to their Be-Ins [and] let our hair grow.&quot; Many cast members (Shelley Plimpton in particular) were recruited off the street. Rado said, &quot;It was very important historically, and if we hadn&#x27;t written it, there&#x27;d not be any examples. You could read about it and see film clips, but you&#x27;d never &quot;experience&quot; it. We thought, &#x27;This is happening in the streets&#x27;, and we wanted to bring it to the stage.&quot; According to Rado&#x27;s obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the title was inspired by &quot;a painting of a tuft of hair by the Pop artist Jim Dine. Its title was &#x27;Hair&#x27;.&quot;

Rado and Ragni came from different artistic backgrounds. In college, Rado wrote musical revues and aspired to be a Broadway composer in the Rodgers and Hammerstein tradition. He went on to study acting with Lee Strasberg. Ragni was a member of The Open Theater, one of several groups that were developing experimental theatre techniques, including non-traditional theater roles, blurring the lines between playwright, director and actor. By 1967, theaters such as The Living Theatre, La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club and The Open Theatre were devising plays from improvisational scenes crafted in the rehearsal space, rather than following a traditional script. Ragni introduced Rado to the modern theatre styles and methods being developed at The Open Theater. In 1966, while the two were developing &quot;Hair&quot;, Ragni performed in The Open Theater&#x27;s production of Megan Terry&#x27;s play &quot;Viet Rock&quot;, about young men being deployed to the Vietnam War. &quot;Viet Rock&quot; employed the improvisational exercises being used in the experimental theatre scene: scenes were connected in &quot;prelogical ways&quot;, where a scene could be built from a tangent from the previous scene, in counterpoint to it, or connected psychologically. Actors switched roles in the middle of a show, in mid-scene, or played actors. Terry wrote, &quot;The ... transformations should be abrupt and total.&quot; &quot;Hair&quot; was designed in much the same way; the actors assume several different characters throughout the course of the piece, and, as in Claude&#x27;s psychedelic trip in Act 2, sometimes during the same scene. As in &quot;Viet Rock&quot;, also, the actors frequently break the &quot;fourth wall&quot; to interact with the audience.

Rado and Ragni brought their drafts of the show to producer Eric Blau who, through common friend Nat Shapiro, connected the two with Canadian composer Galt MacDermot. MacDermot won two Grammy Awards for Best Instrumental Composition and Best Original Jazz Composition in 1961 for his &quot;African Waltz&quot; (recorded by Cannonball Adderley). The composer&#x27;s lifestyle was in marked contrast to his co-creators: &quot;I had short hair, a wife, and, at that point, four children, and I lived on Staten Island.&quot; &quot;I never even heard of a hippie.&quot; But he shared their enthusiasm to do a rock and roll show. &quot;We work independently&quot;, explained MacDermot in May 1968. &quot;I prefer it that way. They hand me the material. I set it to music.&quot; MacDermot wrote the first score in three weeks, starting with the songs &quot;I Got Life&quot;, &quot;Ain&#x27;t Got No&quot;, &quot;Where Do I Go&quot; and the title song. He first wrote &quot;Aquarius&quot; as an unconventional art piece, but later rewrote it into an uplifting anthem.

=== Off-Broadway productions ===
The creators pitched the show to Broadway producers and received many rejections. Eventually Joe Papp, who ran the New York Shakespeare Festival, decided he wanted &quot;Hair&quot; to open the new Public Theater (still under construction) in New York City&#x27;s East Village. The musical was the first work by living authors that Papp produced. The director, Gerald Freedman, the theater&#x27;s associate artistic director, decided that Rado, at 35, was too old to play Claude, although he agreed to cast the 32-year-old Ragni as Berger. The production did not go smoothly: The rehearsal and casting process was confused, the material itself incomprehensible to many of the theater&#x27;s staff. [Freedman] withdrew in frustration during the final week of rehearsals and offered his resignation. Papp accepted it, and the choreographer Anna Sokolow took over the show.Â ... After a disastrous final dress rehearsal, Papp wired Mr. Freedman in Washington, where he&#x27;d fled: &#x27;Please come back.&#x27; Mr. Freedman did.

&quot;Hair&quot; premiered off-Broadway at the Public on October 17, 1967, and ran for six weeks. The lead roles were played by Walker Daniels as Claude, Ragni as Berger, Jill O&#x27;Hara as Sheila, Steve Dean as Woof, Arnold Wilkerson as Hud, Sally Eaton as Jeanie and Shelley Plimpton as Crissy. Set design was by Ming Cho Lee, costume design by Theoni Aldredge, and, although Anna Sokolow began rehearsals as choreographer, Freedman received choreographer credit. Although the production had a &quot;tepid critical reception&quot;, it was popular with audiences. A cast album was released in 1967.

Chicago businessman Michael Butler was planning to run for the U.S. Senate on an anti-war platform. After seeing an ad for &quot;Hair&quot; in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that led him to believe the show was about Native Americans, he watched the Public&#x27;s production several times and joined forces with Joe Papp to reproduce the show at another New York venue after the close of its run at the Public. Papp and Butler first moved the show to The Cheetah discothÃ¨que in midtown, where it opened on December 22, 1967, and ran for 45 performances. There was no nudity in either the Public Theater or Cheetah production.

=== Revision for Broadway ===
&quot;Hair&quot; underwent a thorough overhaul between its closing at the Cheetah in January 1968 and its Broadway opening three months later. The off-Broadway book, already light on plot, was loosened even further and made more realistic. were added, including &quot;Let the Sun Shine In&quot;, to make the ending more uplifting.

Before the move to Broadway, the creative team hired director Tom O&#x27;Horgan, who had built a reputation directing experimental theater at La MaMa E.T.C. He had been the authors&#x27; first choice to direct the Public Theater production, but he was in Europe at the time. &quot;Newsweek&quot; described O&#x27;Horgan&#x27;s directing style as &quot;sensual, savage, and thoroughly musicalÂ ... [he] disintegrates verbal structure and often breaks up and distributes narrative and even character among different actors.Â ... He enjoys sensory bombardment.&quot; O&#x27;Horgan and the writers rearranged scenes to increase the experimental aspects. In rehearsals, O&#x27;Horgan used techniques passed down by Viola Spolin and Paul Sills involving role playing and improvisational &quot;games&quot;, many of which were incorporated into the Broadway script. O&#x27;Horgan and new choreographer Julie Arenal encouraged freedom and spontaneity in their actors, introducing &quot;an organic, expansive style of staging&quot; that had never been seen before on Broadway. The inspiration to include nudity came when the authors saw an anti-war demonstration in Central Park where two men stripped naked as an expression of defiance and freedom. O&#x27;Horgan had used nudity in many of the plays he directed, and he helped integrate the idea into the fabric of the show.

Papp declined to pursue a Broadway production, so Butler produced the show himself. For a time it seemed that he would be unable to secure a Broadway theater, as the Shuberts, Nederlanders and other theater owners deemed the material too controversial. However, Butler had family connections and knew important people; he persuaded Biltmore Theatre owner David Cogan to make his venue available. The stage design was completely open, with no curtain and the fly area and grid exposed to the audience. The proscenium arch was outlined with climb-ready scaffolding. The spare set was painted in shades of grey, with street graffiti stenciled on the stage. The stage was raked, and a tower of abstract scaffolding upstage at the rear merged a Native American totem pole and a modern sculpture of a crucifix-shaped tree. This scaffolding was decorated with found objects that the cast gathered from the streets of New York, including a life-size papier-mÃ¢chÃ© bus driver, the head of Jesus, and a neon marquee of the Waverly movie theater in Greenwich Village. The costumes were based on hippie street clothes, made more theatrical with enhanced color and texture. Some of these included mixed parts of military uniforms, bell bottom jeans with Ukrainian embroidery, tie dyed T-shirts and a red, white and blue fringed coat.

== Synopsis ==
=== Act I ===
Claude sits center stage as the &quot;tribe&quot; mingles with the audience. Tribe members Sheila, a New York University student and political activist, and Berger, an irreverent free spirit, cut a lock of Claude&#x27;s hair and burn it. After the tribe converges in slow-motion toward the stage, they begin their celebration as children of the Age of Aquarius (&quot;Aquarius&quot;). Berger removes his trousers to reveal a loincloth. Interacting with the audience, he introduces himself as a &quot;psychedelic teddy bear ... looking for my Donna&quot; (&quot;Donna&quot;).

The tribe recites a list of pharmaceuticals, legal and illegal (&quot;Hashish&quot;). Woof, a gentle soul, extols sexual practices (&quot;Sodomy&quot;). He loves plants, his family and the audience, telling the audience, &quot;We are all one.&quot; Hud, a militant African-American, is carried in upside-down on a pole. He declares himself &quot;president of the United States of Love&quot; (&quot;Colored Spade&quot;). In a fake English accent, Claude says that he is &quot;the most beautiful beast in the forest&quot; from &quot;Manchester, England&quot;. A tribe member reminds him that he&#x27;s from Flushing, New York (&quot;Manchester England&quot;). Hud, Woof and Berger declare their color (&quot;I&#x27;m Black&quot;), while Claude counters that he is &quot;invisible&quot;. The tribe rattles off a list of things they lack (&quot;Ain&#x27;t Got No&quot;). African-American tribe members list street signs in symbolic sequence (&quot;Dead End&quot;). Sheila is carried onstage (&quot;I Believe in Love&quot;) and leads the tribe in a protest chant. Jeanie, an eccentric young woman, appears wearing a gas mask because of pollution (&quot;Air&quot;). She is pregnant and in love with Claude, wishing it was Claude&#x27;s baby, as she was &quot;knocked up by some crazy speed freak&quot;. The tribe link LBJ, FBI, CIA and LSD (&quot;Initials&quot;). Members of the tribe appear dressed as Claude&#x27;s parents, berating him for transgressions: he does not have a job, and he collects &quot;mountains of paper&quot; clippings and notes. They say they will not give him any more money, and &quot;the army&#x27;ll make a man out of you&quot;, presenting him with his draft notice. In defiance, Claude leads the tribe in celebrating their vitality (&quot;I Got Life&quot;).

Berger hands out imaginary pills to the tribe members, saying the pills are for high-profile people such as Richard Nixon, the Pope, and &quot;Alabama Wallace&quot;. He relates how he was expelled from high school. Three tribe members dress up as principals in Hitler mustaches and swastika armbands, mocking the American education system. Berger and the tribe defy them, singing &quot;Going Down&quot;. Claude returns from passing his draft board physical. He pretends to burn his Vietnam War draft card, which Berger reveals as a library card. Claude agonizes about what to do about being drafted. Two tribe members dressed as tourists arrive to ask the tribe why they have long hair. Claude and Berger lead the tribe in explaining the significance (&quot;Hair&quot;). The woman states that kids should &quot;be free, no guilt&quot; and should &quot;do whatever you want, just so long as you don&#x27;t hurt anyone.&quot; She observes that long hair is natural (&quot;My Conviction&quot;). She opens her coat to reveal that she&#x27;s a man in drag. As the couple leaves, the tribe calls her Margaret Mead.

Sheila gives Berger a yellow shirt. He goofs around and tears it in two. Sheila laments that Berger cares more about the &quot;bleeding crowd&quot; than about her (&quot;Easy to Be Hard&quot;). Jeanie summarizes everyone&#x27;s romantic entanglements: &quot;I&#x27;m hung up on Claude, Sheila&#x27;s hung up on Berger, Berger is hung up everywhere. Claude is hung up on a cross over Sheila and Berger.&quot; Berger, Woof and another tribe member pay satiric tribute to the American flag as they fold it (&quot;Don&#x27;t Put it Down&quot;). The tribe joins the audience, inviting them to a Be-In. After young and innocent Crissy describes &quot;Frank Mills&quot;, a boy she&#x27;s looking for, the tribe participates in the &quot;Be-In&quot;. The men burn their draft cards. Claude puts his card in the fire, changes his mind and pulls it out. He asks, &quot;where is the something, where is the someone, that tells me why I live and die?&quot; (&quot;Where Do I Go&quot;). The tribe appears naked, intoning &quot;beads, flowers, freedom, happiness.&quot;

=== Act II ===
Some tribe members have the &quot;Electric Blues&quot;. The tribe enters worshiping in an attempt to summon Claude (&quot;Oh Great God of Power&quot;). Claude returns from the induction center, and tribe members act out an imagined conversation from Claude&#x27;s draft interview, with Hud saying &quot;the draft is white people sending black people to make war on the yellow people to defend the land they stole from the red people&quot;. Claude gives Woof a Mick Jagger poster; Woof is excited about the gift, as he is infatuated with Jagger. Three white women of the tribe tell why they like &quot;Black Boys&quot; (&quot;black boys are delicious&quot;), and three black women of the tribe, dressed like The Supremes, explain why they like &quot;White Boys&quot; (&quot;white boys are so pretty&quot;).

Berger gives a joint to Claude that is laced with a hallucinogen. Claude starts to trip as the tribe acts out his visions (&quot;Walking in Space&quot;). He hallucinates that he is skydiving from a plane into the jungles of Vietnam. Berger appears as General George Washington and is told to retreat because of an Indian attack. The Indians shoot all of Washington&#x27;s men. General Ulysses S. Grant appears and begins a roll call: Abraham Lincoln (played by a black female tribe member), John Wilkes Booth, Calvin Coolidge, Clark Gable, Scarlett O&#x27;Hara, Aretha Franklin, Colonel George Custer. They all dance a minuet until African witch doctors kill them, except for Lincoln, who says, &quot;I&#x27;m one of you&quot;. After the Africans sing his praises, Lincoln recites an alternate version of the Gettysburg Address (&quot;Abie Baby&quot;). Booth shoots Lincoln, but Lincoln says to him, &quot;Shit! I&#x27;m not dyin&#x27; for no white man&quot;. As the visions continue, Buddhist monks enter. One pours a can of gasoline over another monk, who is set afire (reminiscent of the self-immolation of ThÃ­ch Quáº£ng Äá»©c) and runs off screaming. Three Catholic nuns strangle the three remaining Buddhist monks. Three astronauts shoot the nuns with ray guns. Three Chinese people stab the astronauts. Three Native Americans kill the Chinese with bows and tomahawks. Three Green Berets kill the Native Americans with machine guns and then kill each other. A sergeant appears with two parents holding a suit on a hanger, talking to the suit as if it were their son of whom they are very proud. The bodies rise and play like children. The playing escalates to violence until they are all dead again. They rise again and comment about the casualties in Vietnam: &quot;It&#x27;s a dirty little war&quot; (&quot;Three-Five-Zero-Zero&quot;). At the end of the sequence, two tribe members sing, over the dead bodies, Shakespeare&#x27;s paean to the nobility of Man (&quot;What A Piece of Work Is Man&quot;).

After the trip, Claude says &quot;I can&#x27;t take this moment to moment living on the streets. ... I want to be ... invisible&quot;. As they &quot;look at the Moon&quot;, Sheila and the others enjoy a light moment (&quot;Good Morning Starshine&quot;). The tribe pays tribute to an old mattress (&quot;The Bed&quot;). Claude leaves as the tribe enters wrapped in blankets during a snowstorm. They begin a protest chant and then call for Claude. Claude enters dressed in a military uniform, his hair short, but the tribe does not see him because he is an invisible spirit. Claude says, &quot;like it or not, they got me.&quot; The tribe sings &quot;Flesh Failures&quot;. They move in front of Claude and launch into &quot;Let the Sun Shine In&quot;; as they exit, Claude is left lying in the center. During the curtain call, the tribe reprises &quot;Let the Sun Shine In&quot; and brings audience members on stage to dance.

(Note: &quot;This plot summary is based on the original Broadway script. The script has varied in subsequent productions.&quot;)

==Principal casts==

== Early productions ==

=== Broadway ===
&quot;Hair&quot; opened on Broadway at the Biltmore Theatre on April 29, 1968. The production was directed by O&#x27;Horgan and choreographed by Arenal, with designs by Robin Wagner (set), Nancy Potts (costumes), and Jules Fisher (lighting). The original Broadway cast included Rado and Ragni as Claude and Berger, Lynn Kellogg as Sheila, Lamont Washington as Hud, Eaton, Plimpton and Dyson reprising their off-Broadway roles as Jeanie, Crissy and the &quot;Aquarius&quot; soloist, Melba Moore as Dionne, Steve Curry as Woof, and Paul Jabara and Diane Keaton in the ensemble (both Moore and Keaton later played Sheila). Other replacements during the original Broadway run were Ben Vereen, Keith Carradine, Barry McGuire, Ted Lange, Meat Loaf, La La Brooks, Mary Seymour (of Musique), Joe Butler, Peppy Castro (of the Blues Magoos), Robin McNamara, Eddie Rambeau, Vicki Sue Robinson, Beverly Bremers, Bert Sommer, Dale Soules and Kim Milford. It was the first Broadway show to have a regular ticket price of $50, with 12 of the seats at this price for sale to large corporations from July 1968. The top price when it opened was $11.

The &quot;Hair&quot; team soon became embroiled in a lawsuit with the organizers of the Tony Awards. After assuring producer Michael Butler that commencing previews by April 3, 1968, would assure eligibility for the 1968 Tonys, the New York Theatre League ruled &quot;Hair&quot; ineligible, moving the cutoff date to March 19. The producers sued but were unable to force the League to reconsider. At the 1969 Tonys, &quot;Hair&quot; was nominated for Best Musical and Best Director but lost to &quot;1776&quot; in both categories. The production ran for four years and 1,750Â performances, closing on July 1, 1972.

=== Early regional productions ===
The West Coast version played at the Aquarius Theater in Los Angeles beginning about six months after the Broadway opening and running for an unprecedented two years. The Los Angeles tribe included Rado, Ragni, Vereen (who played Hud and then replaced Ragni), Ted Neeley (who replaced Rado), Willie Weatherly (who played Berger and Claude), Meat Loaf, Gloria Jones, TÃ¡ta Vega, Jobriath, Jennifer Warnes and Dobie Gray.

There were soon nine simultaneous productions in U.S. cities, followed by national tours. The performers in these included Joe Mantegna, AndrÃ© DeShields, Charlotte Crossley and Alaina Reed (Chicago), David Lasley, David Patrick Kelly, Meat Loaf, and Shaun Murphy (Detroit), Kenny Ortega and Arnold McCuller (tour), Bob Bingham (Seattle) and Philip Michael Thomas (San Francisco). The creative team from Broadway worked on &quot;Hair&quot; in Los Angeles, Chicago and San Francisco, as the Broadway staging served as a rough template for these and other early regional productions. In Los Angeles, Tom Smothers was co-producer. Regional casts consisted mostly of local actors, although a few Broadway cast members reprised their roles. O&#x27;Horgan or the authors sometimes took new ideas and improvisations from a regional show and brought them back to New York, such as when live chickens were tossed onto the stage in Los Angeles.

It was rare for so many productions to run simultaneously during an initial Broadway run. Butler, who had declared that &quot;Hair&quot; is &quot;the strongest anti-war statement ever written&quot;, said the reason that he opened so many productions was to influence public opinion against the Vietnam War and end it as soon as possible.

=== West End ===
&quot;Hair&quot; opened at the Shaftesbury Theatre in London on September 27, 1968, led by the same creative team as the Broadway production. The opening night was delayed until the abolition of theatre censorship in England under the Theatres Act 1968 so that the show could include nudity and profanity. As with other early productions, the London show added local allusions and other minor departures from the Broadway version.

The original London tribe included Sonja Kristina, Peter Straker, Paul Nicholas, Melba Moore, Annabel Leventon, Elaine Paige, Paul Korda, Marsha Hunt, Floella Benjamin, Alex Harvey, Oliver Tobias, Richard O&#x27;Brien and Tim Curry. This was Curry&#x27;s first full-time theatrical acting role, where he met future &quot;Rocky Horror Show&quot; collaborator O&#x27;Brien. &quot;Hair&quot;â³s engagement in London surpassed the Broadway production, running for 1,997 performances until the roof of the theatre collapsed in July 1973.

=== Early international productions ===
Bertrand Castelli, Butler&#x27;s partner and executive producer of the Broadway show, led the foreign-language productions. Castelli was a writer/producer known in Paris art circles. Butler described him as a &quot;crazy showman ... the guy with the business suit and beads&quot;. Castelli decided to do the show in the local language of each country at a time when Broadway shows were always done in English. The translations followed the original script closely, and the Broadway stagings were used. Each script contained local references. Castelli produced companies in France, Germany, Mexico and other countries, sometimes also directing the productions. The first European production, after London, opened in Stockholm, Sweden, on September 20, 1968, with a cast including Ulf Brunnberg and Bill ÃhrstrÃ¶m, produced and directed by Pierre FrÃ¤nckel and choreographed by Arenal. It ran for 134 performances until March 1969.

A German production, directed by Castelli, opened a month later in Munich; the tribe included Donna Summer, Liz Mitchell and Donna Wyant. A Paris production opened on June 1, 1969. The original Australian production debuted in Sydney on June 6, 1969, produced by Harry M. Miller and directed by Jim Sharman, who also designed the production. The tribe included Keith Glass and then Reg Livermore as Berger, John Waters as Claude and Sharon Redd as The Magician. Redd was one of six African-Americans brought to Australia to provide a racially integrated tribe. The production broke local box-office records and ran for two years, but because of some of the language in the show, the cast album was banned in Queensland and New Zealand. The production transferred to Melbourne in 1971 and then had a national tour. It marked the theatrical debut of Marcia Hines. In Mexico the production was banned by the government after one night in Acapulco. 18-year-old SÃ´nia Braga appeared in the 1969 Brazilian production.

A production in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, in 1969, was the first &quot;Hair&quot; to be produced in a communist country. The show, translated into Serbian, was directed by Mira TrailoviÄ at the Atelje 212 theatre. It featured Dragan NikoliÄ, Branko MiliÄeviÄ, Seka SabliÄ and DuÅ¡an PreleviÄ. Over four years, the production played 250 performances and was attended by president Tito. Local references in the script included barbs aimed at Mao Zedong as well as Albania, Yugoslavia&#x27;s traditional rival.

By 1970, &quot;Hair&quot; was a huge financial success, and nineteen productions had been staged outside of North America, including in Scandinavia, South America, Italy, Israel, Japan, Canada, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Austria. According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, the productions took in almost $1Â million every ten days, and royalties were being collected for 300 different recordings of the show&#x27;s songs, making it &quot;the most successful score in history as well as the most performed score ever written for the Broadway stage.&quot;

== Themes ==
&quot;Hair&quot; explores many themes of the hippie movement of the 1960s. Theatre writer Scott Miller stated:

[Youth protests in the 1960s concerned]: racism, environmental destruction, poverty, sexism and sexual repression, violence at home and the war in Vietnam, depersonalization from new technologies, and corruption in politics. ... [T]he hippies had great respect for America and believed that they were the true patriots. ... [Long] hair was the hippies&#x27; flag â their ... symbol not only of rebellion but also of ... the rejection of discrimination and restrictive gender roles. ... Drab work clothes (jeans, work shirts, pea coats) were a rejection of materialism. Clothing from ... the Third World and native Americans represented their awareness of the global community and their rejection of U.S. imperialism and selfishness. ... [N]atural fabrics were a rejection of synthetics, a return to natural things. ... [O]ld World War II or Civil War jackets [co-opted] the symbols of war into their newfound philosophy of nonviolence.

=== Race and the tribe ===
Extending the precedents set by &quot;Show Boat&quot; (1927) and &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; (1935), &quot;Hair&quot; opened the Broadway musical to racial integration; fully one-third of the cast was African American. Except for satirically in skits, the roles for the black tribe members portrayed them as equals, breaking from traditional roles for black people in entertainment as slaves or servants. An &quot;Ebony&quot; article declared that the show was the biggest outlet for black actors in the history of the U.S. stage. Several songs and scenes from the show address racial issues. &quot;Colored Spade&quot;, introducing the character Hud, a militant black male, is a long list of racial slurs (&quot;jungle bunny ... little black sambo&quot;). &quot;Dead End&quot;, sung by black tribe members, is a list of street signs that symbolize black frustration and alienation. &quot;Black Boys/White Boys&quot; is an exuberant acknowledgement of interracial sexual attraction; the U.S. Supreme Court had not struck down laws banning interracial marriage until 1967. &quot;Abie Baby&quot; is part of the Act 2 &quot;trip&quot; sequence: four African witch doctors, who have just killed various American historical, cultural and fictional characters, sing the praises of Abraham Lincoln, portrayed by a black female tribe member, whom they decide not to kill. The first part of the song contains stereotypical language that black characters used in old movies, like &quot;I&#x27;s finished ... pluckin&#x27; y&#x27;all&#x27;s chickens&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;s free now thanks to y&#x27;all, Master Lincoln&quot;. The Lincoln character recites a modernized version of the Gettysburg Address, while a white female tribe member polishes Lincoln&#x27;s shoes with her blond hair.

The many references to Native Americans throughout the script are part of the anti-consumerist, naturalist focus of the hippie movement and of &quot;Hair&quot;. The characters are referred to as the &quot;tribe&quot;, borrowing the term for Native American communities. The cast of each production chooses a tribal name. Miller wrote: &quot;The practice is not just cosmetic ... the entire cast must work together, must like each other. ... All the sense of family, of belonging, of responsibility and loyalty inherent in the word &#x27;tribe&#x27; has to be felt by the cast.&quot; To enhance this feeling, O&#x27;Horgan put the cast through sensitivity exercises based on trust, touching, listening and intensive examination that broke down barriers between the cast and crew and encouraged bonding.

=== Nudity, sexual freedom and drug use ===
The brief nude scene at the end of Act I was a subject of controversy and notoriety. &quot;Much has been written about that scene ... most of it silly,&quot; wrote Gene Lees in &quot;High Fidelity&quot;. During &quot;Where Do I Go?&quot;, those choosing to participate in the scene removed their clothes behind a scrim. At the musical cue, &quot;they [stood] naked and motionless, their bodies bathed&quot; in dim projections of floral patterns, chanting. It lasted twenty seconds. The scene prompted threats of censorship and even violent reactions in some places. It also became fodder for pop-culture jokes. Jack Benny quipped at a London preview, &quot;Did you happen to notice if any of them were Jewish?&quot; Groucho Marx joked, &quot;I was gonna go see it ... [To save the $11 ticket price,] I went into my bathroom, took off all my clothes, and looked at myself in the full-length mirror.&quot;

The nudity was optional for the performers. The French cast was &quot;the nudest&quot; of the foreign groups, while the London cast &quot;found nudity the hardest to achieve&quot;. In Copenhagen, the tribe thought the nudity too tame and decided to walk naked in the aisle during the show&#x27;s prelude. In some early performances, the Germans played their scene behind a big sheet labeled &quot;CENSORED&quot;. Miller writes, &quot;nudity was a big part of the hippie culture, both as a rejection of the sexual repression of their parents and also as a statement about naturalism, spirituality, honesty, openness, and freedom. The naked body was beautiful, something to be celebrated and appreciated. ... They saw their bodies and their sexuality as gifts&quot;. According to Melba Moore, &quot;It doesn&#x27;t mean anything except what you want it to mean. ... It&#x27;s like so much else people get uptight about.&quot; Donna Summer, who was in the German production, said that &quot;it was not meant to be sexual. ... We stood naked to comment on the fact that society makes more of nudity than killing.&quot;

&quot;Hair&quot; glorifies sexual freedom in various ways. In addition to acceptance of interracial attraction, the characters&#x27; free love lifestyle acts as a sexually and politically charged updating of &quot;La bohÃ¨me&quot;; as Rado explained, &quot;The love element of the peace movement was palpable.&quot; In the song &quot;Sodomy&quot;, Woof exhorts everyone to &quot;join the holy orgy Kama Sutra&quot;. Toward the end of Act 2, the tribe members reveal their free love tendencies when they banter about who will sleep with whom that night.

Illegal drugs taken by the characters include a hallucinogen during the trip sequence. The song &quot;Walking in Space&quot; begins the sequence, declaring &quot;how dare they try to end this beauty ... in this dive we rediscover sensation ... our eyes are open, wide, wide, wide&quot;. Similarly, in &quot;Donna&quot;, Berger sings, &quot;I&#x27;m evolving through the drugs that you put down.&quot; Generally, the tribe favors hallucinogenic or &quot;mind expanding&quot; drugs, such as LSD and marijuana.

=== Pacifism and environmentalism ===
The opposition to the war that pervades the show is unified by the plot thread that progresses through the book â Claude&#x27;s moral dilemma over whether to burn his draft card. Pacifism is explored throughout the extended trip sequence in Act 2. The lyrics to &quot;Three-Five-Zero-Zero&quot;, sung during that sequence, evoke the horrors of war (&quot;ripped open by metal explosion&quot;). The song is based on Allen Ginsberg&#x27;s 1966 poem, &quot;Wichita Vortex Sutra&quot;, in which General Maxwell Taylor proudly reports to the press the number of enemy soldiers killed in one month, repeating it digit by digit, for effect: &quot;Three-Five-Zero-Zero&quot;. The song begins with images of death and dying and turns into a manic dance number, echoing Maxwell&#x27;s glee at reporting the enemy casualties. The song also raises the issue of the disproportionate loss and disparate treatment of black servicemen in &quot;decorations, promotion and duty assignments&quot; in the Vietnam War, with the repeated phrase &quot;Prisoners in niggertown/ It&#x27;s a dirty little war&quot;.

&quot;Don&#x27;t Put It Down&quot; satirizes the unexamined patriotism of people who are &quot;crazy for the American flag&quot;. &quot;Be In (Hare Krishna)&quot; praises the peace movement and events like the San Francisco and Central Park Be-Ins. Throughout the show, the tribe chants popular protest slogans like &quot;What do we want? Peace!Â  â When do we want it? Now!&quot; and &quot;Do not enter the induction center&quot;. The upbeat song, &quot;Let the Sun Shine In&quot;, is a call to action, to reject the darkness of war and change the world for the better.

&quot;Hair&quot; also satirizes pollution. Jeanie appears wearing a gas mask and then sings the song &quot;Air&quot;: &quot;Welcome, sulfur dioxide. Hello carbon monoxide. The air ... is everywhere&quot;, suggesting that pollution will eventually kill her: &quot;vapor and fume at the stone of my tomb, breathing like a sullen perfume&quot;. In a comic, pro-green vein, Woof introduces himself by explaining that he &quot;grows things&quot;, and Berger weaves nature imagery into the title song.

=== Religion and astrology ===
Religion, particularly Catholicism, appears both overtly and symbolically throughout the piece, and it is often the brunt of a joke. Berger sings of looking for &quot;my Donna&quot;, giving it the double meaning of a woman he is searching for and the Madonna. During &quot;Sodomy&quot;, a hymn-like paean to all that is &quot;dirty&quot; about sex, the cast strikes evocative religious positions: the PietÃ  and Christ on the cross. Before the song, Woof recites a modified rosary. In Act II, when Berger gives imaginary pills to famous figures, he offers &quot;a pill for the Pope&quot;. In &quot;Going Down&quot;, after being kicked out of school, Berger compares himself to Lucifer: &quot;Just like the angel that fell / Banished forever to hell / Today have I been expelled / From high school heaven.&quot; Claude becomes a classic Christ figure at various points. In Act I, Claude says, &quot;I am the Son of God. I shall vanish and be forgotten&quot;, then gives benediction to the tribe and the audience. He suffers from indecision, and, in his Gethsemane at the end of Act I, he asks &quot;Where Do I Go?&quot;. The textual alludes to Claude being on a cross, and, in the end, he is chosen to give his life for the others. Berger is a John the Baptist figure, preparing the way for Claude.

Songs like &quot;Good Morning, Starshine&quot; and &quot;Aquarius&quot; reflect the 1960s cultural interest in astrological and cosmic concepts. &quot;Aquarius&quot; was written after Rado researched his own astrological sign. The company&#x27;s astrologer, Maria Crummere, was consulted about casting: Sheila was usually played by a Libra or Capricorn and Berger by a Leo. Crummere was also consulted on when the show would open on Broadway and in other cities. &quot;Playbill&quot; reported that she chose April 29, 1968, for the Broadway premiere. The 29th was auspicious ... because the moon was high, indicating that people would attend in masses. The position of the &#x27;history makers&#x27; (Pluto, Uranus, Jupiter) in the 10th house made the show unique, powerful and a money-maker. And that Neptune was on the ascendancy foretold that &quot;Hair&quot; would develop a reputation involving sex. In Mexico, where Crummere did not pick the opening date, the show was closed by the government after one night. She disliked the date of the Boston opening (where the producers were sued over the show&#x27;s content), saying, &quot;Jupiter will be in opposition to naughty Saturn, and the show opens the very day of the sun&#x27;s eclipse. Terrible&quot;.

=== Literary themes and symbolism ===
&quot;Hair&quot; makes many references to Shakespeare&#x27;s plays and, at times, takes lyrical material directly from Shakespeare. For example, the lyrics to the song &quot;What a Piece of Work Is Man&quot; are from &quot;Hamlet&quot; (II:Â sceneÂ 2), and portions of &quot;Flesh Failures&quot; (&quot;the rest is silence&quot;) are from Hamlet&#x27;s final lines. In &quot;Flesh Failures/Let the Sun Shine In&quot;, the lyrics &quot;Eyes, look your last!/ Arms, take your last embrace! And lips, O you/ The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss&quot; are from &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (V: iii). According to Miller, the &quot;Romeo&quot; suicide imagery makes the point that, with our complicity in war, we are killing ourselves. Claude&#x27;s indecision, especially his resistance to burning his draft card, which ultimately causes his demise, parallels &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;the melancholy hippie&quot;. This symbolism is carried into the last scene, where Claude appears as a ghostly spirit among his friends wearing an army uniform in an ironic echo of an earlier scene, where he says, &quot;I know what I want to be ... invisible&quot;. Public Theater Artistic Director Oskar Eustis said: Both [&quot;Hair&quot; and &quot;Hamlet&quot;] center on idealistic brilliant men as they struggle to find their place in a world marred by war, violence, and venal politics. They see both the luminous possibilities and the harshest realities of being human. In the end, unable to effectively combat the evil around them, they tragically succumb.

Other literary references include the song &quot;Three-Five-Zero-Zero&quot;, based on Ginsberg&#x27;s poem &quot;Wichita Vortex Sutra&quot;, and, in the psychedelic drug trip sequence, the portrayal of Scarlett O&#x27;Hara, from &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, and activist African-American poet LeRoi Jones.

== Music ==

After studying the music of the Bantu at Cape Town University, MacDermot incorporated African rhythms into the score of &quot;Hair&quot;. He listened to &quot;what [the Bantu] called quaylas ... [which have a] very characteristic beat, very similar to rock. Much deeper though. ... &quot;Hair&quot; is very African â a lot of [the] rhythms, not the tunes so much.&quot; Quaylas stress beats on unexpected syllables, and this influence can be heard in songs like &quot;What a Piece of Work Is Man&quot; and &quot;Ain&#x27;t Got No Grass&quot;. MacDermot said, &quot;My idea was to make a total funk show. They said they wanted rock &amp; roll â but to me that translated to &#x27;funk&#x27;.&quot; Funk influence is evident throughout the score, notably in songs like &quot;Colored Spade&quot; and &quot;Walking in Space&quot;. MacDermot said, however, that the songs &quot;can&#x27;t all be the same. You&#x27;ve got to get different styles.Â ... I like to think they&#x27;re all a little different&quot;. The music in &quot;Hair&quot; varies from the rockabilly sensibilities of &quot;Don&#x27;t Put it Down&quot; to the folk rock rhythms of &quot;Frank Mills&quot; and &quot;What a Piece of Work is Man&quot;, to rhythm and blues in &quot;Easy to Be Hard&quot; and protest rock anthems, such as &quot;Ain&#x27;t Got No&quot; and &quot;The Flesh Failures&quot;. The acid rock of &quot;Walking in Space&quot; and &quot;Aquarius&quot; are balanced by the mainstream pop of &quot;Good Morning Starshine&quot;. Miller ties the music of &quot;Hair&quot; to the hippies&#x27; political themes: The hippiesÂ ... were determined to create art of the people and their chosen art form, rock/folk music was by its definition, populist.Â ... [T]he hippies&#x27; music was often very angry, its anger directed at those who would prostitute the Constitution, who would sell America out, who would betray what America stood for; in other words, directed at their parents and the government.

The music did not resonate with everyone. Leonard Bernstein remarked &quot;the songs are just laundry lists&quot; and walked out of the production. Richard Rodgers could only hear the beat and called it &quot;one-third music&quot;. John Fogerty said, &quot;&quot;Hair&quot; is such a watered down version of what is really going on that I can&#x27;t get behind it at all.&quot; Gene Lees, writing for &quot;High Fidelity&quot;, stated that John Lennon found the show &quot;dull&quot;, and he wrote, &quot;I do not know any musician who thinks it&#x27;s good.&quot; Theatre historian John Kenrick countered:
&quot;[&quot;Hair&#x27;s&quot;] explosion of revolutionary proclamations, profanity and hard rock shook the musical theatre to its roots.Â ... Most people in the theatre business [and] Tony voters tried to ignore &quot;Hair&#x27;s&quot; importance, shutting it out from any honors. However, some now insisted it was time for a change. &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Clive Barnes gushed that &quot;Hair&quot; was &#x27;the first Broadway musical in some time to have the authentic voice of today rather than the day before yesterday&#x27;.&quot;

=== Songs ===
The score had many more songs than typical Broadway shows of the day. Most had about six to ten songs per act; &quot;Hair&quot;&#x27;s total is in the thirties. This list reflects the songs most often included during the original Broadway run.

The show was under almost perpetual re-write. ThirteenÂ songs were added between the production at the Public Theater and Broadway. Others were cut; &quot;What a piece of work is a man&quot; and &quot;Hashish&quot; were originally spoken but musicalized for Broadway. Subsequent productions have included or cut others.

=== Recordings ===
The first recording in 1967 featured the off-Broadway cast. The original Broadway cast recording received a Grammy Award in 1969 for Best Score from an Original Cast Show Album and sold nearly 3Â million copies in the U.S. by December 1969. It charted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, the last Broadway cast album to do so (as of 2024), and stayed at No. 1 for 13 weeks in 1969. The album peaked at number 2 in Australia in 1970. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The cast album of &quot;Hair&quot; wasÂ ... a must-have for the middle classes. Its exotic orange-and-green cover art imprinted itself instantly and indelibly on the psyche.Â ... [It] became a pop-rock classic [with] an appeal that transcends particular tastes for genre or period.&quot; In 2019, the Library of Congress added the original Broadway cast album to the National Recording Registry.

A 1969 studio album, &quot;DisinHAIRited&quot;, contains 19 songs written for the show but not included in previous recordings, a few of which were never included in stage productions. Some were cut between the Public and Broadway productions or were left off the original cast albums due to space. Productions in England, Germany, France, Sweden, Japan, Israel, the Netherlands, Australia and elsewhere released cast albums, Such broad attention was paid to the recordings of &quot;Hair&quot; that, after an unprecedented bidding war, ABC Records was willing to pay a record amount for MacDermot&#x27;s next Broadway adaptation, &quot;Two Gentlemen of Verona&quot;. The 2009 revival recording debuted at on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Top Cast Album&quot; chart and at in the Top 200, making it the highest debuting album in Ghostlight Records history. The 1993 London revival cast album contains new music incorporated into the standard rental version.

More than 1,000 performances of individual songs from &quot;Hair&quot; have been recorded. The 5th Dimension&#x27;s release of &quot;Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In&quot; in 1969 won Record of the Year in 1970 and topped the charts for sixÂ weeks. The Cowsills&#x27;s recording of the title song &quot;Hair&quot; climbed to on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, while Oliver&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning Starshine&quot; reached . Three Dog Night&#x27;s &quot;Easy to Be Hard&quot; went to . Nina Simone&#x27;s 1968 medley of &quot;Ain&#x27;t Got No, I Got Life&quot; reached the top 5 on the UK singles chart. ASCAP confirmed that &quot;Aquarius&quot; was the most frequently played song on U.S. radio and television in 1970. Among other artists recording &quot;Hair&quot; songs are Shirley Bassey, Barbra Streisand and Diana Ross. &quot;Good Morning Starshine&quot; was sung on a 1969 episode of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; by Bob McGrath, and versions have been recorded by artists such as Sarah Brightman, Petula Clark, Strawberry Alarm Clock. Liza Minnelli and The Lemonheads recorded &quot;Frank Mills&quot;, and Andrea McArdle, Jennifer Warnes, and SÃ©rgio Mendes each made versions of &quot;Easy to Be Hard&quot;. Run DMC sampled &quot;Where Do I Go&quot; for their 1993 single &quot;Down with the King&quot; which went to on the &quot;Billboard&quot; rap chart and reached the top 25 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. &quot;Hair&quot; helped launch the recording careers of Meat Loaf, Dobie Gray, Jennifer Warnes, Jobriath, Bert Sommer, Ronnie Dyson, Donna Summer and Melba Moore. In 2004 &quot;Aquarius&quot;, from the 1979 film version, was numberÂ 33 on AFI&#x27;s 100 Years ... 100 Songs.

== Early critical reception ==
Reception of &quot;Hair&quot;â³s Broadway premiere was overwhelmingly positive. Clive Barnes wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;I think it is simply that it is so likable. So new, so fresh, and so unassuming, even in its pretensions.&quot; John J. O&#x27;Connor of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; said the show was &quot;exuberantly defiant and the production explodes into every nook and cranny of the Biltmore Theater&quot;. Richard Watts Jr. of the &quot;New York Post&quot; wrote that &quot;it has a surprising if perhaps unintentional charm, its high spirits are contagious, and its young zestfulness makes it difficult to resist.&quot; Allan Jeffreys of ABC TV said the actors were &quot;the most talented hippies you&#x27;ll ever seeÂ ... directed in a wonderfully wild fashion by Tom O&#x27;Horgan.&quot; Leonard Probst of NBC said &quot;Hair&quot; is the only new concept in musicals on Broadway in years and it&#x27;s more fun than any other this season&quot;. John Wingate of WOR TV praised MacDermot&#x27;s &quot;dynamic score&quot; that &quot;blasts and soars&quot;, and Len Harris of CBS said &quot;I&#x27;ve finally found the best musical of the Broadway seasonÂ ... it&#x27;s that sloppy, vulgar, terrific tribal love rock musical &quot;Hair&quot;.&quot;

A dissenting review in &quot;Variety&quot; called the show &quot;loony&quot; and &quot;without a story, form, music, dancing, beauty or artistry.Â ... It&#x27;s impossible to tell whether [the cast has] talent. Maybe talent is irrelevant in this new kind of show business.&quot; Jack Kroll in &quot;Newsweek&quot; wrote, &quot;There is no denying the sheer kinetic drive of this new &quot;Hair&quot;Â ... there is something hard, grabby, slightly corrupt about O&#x27;Horgan&#x27;s virtuosity, like Busby Berkeley gone bitchy.&quot; A reviewer from &quot;Time&quot; wrote that although the show &quot;thrums with vitality, [it is] crippled by being a bookless musical and, like a boneless fish, it drifts when it should swim.&quot;

Among positive reviewers when &quot;Hair&quot; opened in London was Irving Wardle of &quot;The Times&quot;, who wrote, &quot;Its honesty and passion give it the quality of a true theatrical celebration â the joyous sound of a group of people telling the world exactly what they feel.&quot; In the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, B. A. Young agreed that &quot;Hair&quot; was &quot;not only a wildly enjoyable evening, but a thoroughly moral one.&quot; However, in his final review before retiring, 78-year-old W. A. Darlington of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; wrote that he had &quot;tried hard&quot;, but found the evening &quot;a complete boreÂ â noisy, ugly and quite desperately funny&quot;. Of such critiques, Miller wrote in 2001, &quot;some people can&#x27;t see past the appearance of chaos and randomness to the brilliant construction and sophisticated imagery underneath.&quot; He notes, &quot;Not only did many of the lyrics not rhyme, but many of the songs didn&#x27;t really have endings, just a slowing down and stopping, so the audience didn&#x27;t know when to applaud.Â ... The show rejected every convention of Broadway [and] of traditional theatre.&quot;

== Social change ==
&quot;Hair&quot; challenged many of the norms of Western society in 1968. The name itself was a reaction to the restrictions of civilization and consumerism and a preference for naturalism. Rado recalled that long hair &quot;was a visible form of awareness in the consciousness expansion. The longer the hair got, the more expansive the mind was. Long hair was shocking, and it was a revolutionary act to grow long hair. It was kind of a flag, really.&quot;

The musical caused controversy. It was the first time a Broadway show had seen totally naked performers, and the show was charged with the desecration of the American flag and the use of obscene language. These controversies, and the anti-Vietnam War theme, attracted occasional threats and violence during the show&#x27;s early years and became the basis for legal actions. Two cases eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court. In Indiana cities, the producers were either refused booking, had difficulty securing a theater, or the production was picketed by church groups. Productions in the U.S. were frequently confronted with the closure of theaters by the fire marshal. Chattanooga&#x27;s 1972 refusal to allow &quot;Hair&quot; to play at the city-owned Memorial Auditorium was later found by the Supreme Court to be an unlawful prior restraint.

Legal challenges against the Boston production were appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Chief of the Licensing Bureau said, &quot;anyone who desecrates the flag should be whipped on Boston Common.&quot; Although the scene was removed before opening, the District Attorney&#x27;s alleged that &quot;lewd and lascivious&quot; actions were taking place onstage. &quot;Hair&quot; obtained an injunction from the Superior Court against criminal prosecution, and the D.A. appealed to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. At the request of both parties, several of the justices viewed the production; the court ruled that &quot;the cast [must] be clothed to a reasonable extent.&quot; The cast defiantly played the scene nude later that night, stating that the ruling was vague as to when it would take effect. The next day, the production closed. After a Federal appellate bench reversed the Massachusetts court&#x27;s ruling, the D.A. appealed the case to the U.S. Supreme Court. In a 4â4 decision, the Court upheld the reversal, allowing &quot;Hair&quot; to re-open.

A 1969 Acapulco, Mexico, production played for oneÂ night. The theater, located across the street from a popular local bordello, was padlocked by the government, which said the production was &quot;detrimental to the morals of youth.&quot; The cast was arrested and agreed to leave the country, but because of legal complications they went into hiding. They were expelled from Mexico days later. In Bergen, Norway, citizens formed a human barricade to try to prevent the performance. In St. Paul, Minnesota, a protesting clergyman released mice in the lobby hoping to frighten the audience. Jim Lovell and Jack Swigert, after dubbing Apollo 13&#x27;s lunar module &quot;Aquarius&quot; after the song, walked out of the production at the Biltmore in protest of perceived anti-Americanism and disrespect of the flag. In April 1971, aÂ bomb was thrown at &quot;Hair&quot; â³s theater in Cleveland, Ohio, bouncing off the marquee; the blast shattered windows in the building and nearby storefronts. The same month, the families of a cast member and the stage manager died in a fire in the Cleveland hotel where members of the show&#x27;s troupe were staying. The Sydney, Australia, production&#x27;s opening night was interrupted by aÂ bombÂ scare in 1969.

&quot;Hair&quot; effectively marked the end of stage censorship in the United Kingdom. London&#x27;s stage censor, the Lord Chamberlain, refused to license the musical, and the opening was delayed until Parliament passed a bill stripping his licensing power. San Francisco&#x27;s large hippie population considered the show an extension of their street activities, blurring the barrier between art and life by frequently meditating with the cast and joining them onstage during the show. 18-year-old Princess Anne danced onstage in London. In Munich, authorities threatened to close the production if the nude scene remained, but after a &quot;Hair&quot; spokesman declared that his relatives had been marched nude into Auschwitz, the authorities relented. The Paris production encountered little controversy, nudity being common on stage in Paris. Even in Paris there was occasional opposition, however, such as when a member of the Salvation Army used a portable loudspeaker to exhort the audience to halt the presentation.

== Subsequent productions ==

=== 1970s to 1990s ===
The first college production took place in 1970 at Memphis State University, Tennessee, directed by Keith Kennedy. The cast participated in the Atlanta International Pop Festival in 1970. WMC-TV produced a 1971 documentary chronicling the production.

A Broadway revival of &quot;Hair&quot; in 1977 ran for 43Â performances at the Biltmore Theater. It was produced by Michael Butler and, directed by O&#x27;Horgan. The cast included Ellen Foley, Annie Golden, Loretta Devine, Cleavant Derricks and Kristen Vigard. Reviews were generally negative, and critics accused the musical of &quot;showing its gray&quot;. A 1985 production in Montreal was reportedly the 70th professional production. A 20th-anniversary benefit concert was held in May 1988 at the United Nations General Assembly. The event was sponsored by First Lady Nancy Reagan and introduced by Barbara Walters. Rado, Ragni and MacDermot reunited to write nine new songs for the concert. The cast of 163 included former stars from productions around the globe, Moore, Vereen, Williams and Summer, as well as guest performers Bea Arthur, Frank Stallone and Dr. Ruth Westheimer. Ticket prices ranged from $250 to $5,000, and the proceeds went to the United States Committee for UNICEF and the Creo Society&#x27;s Fund for Children with AIDS. In November 1988, Butler produced &quot;Hair&quot; at Chicago&#x27;s Vic Theater. The production was well received and ran until February 1989. 

From 1990 to 1991, Pink Lace Productions ran a U.S. national tour of &quot;Hair&quot;. A 1990 &quot;bus and truck&quot; production toured Europe for over 3Â years. Even after Ragni died in 1991, MacDermot and Rado continued to write new songs for revivals through the 1990s. &quot;Hair Sarajevo, AD 1992&quot; was staged during the siege of Sarajevo as an appeal for peace. Rado directed a US national 25th-anniversary tour in 1994 featuring actor Luther Creek; MacDermot returned to oversee the music. Rado also directed various European productions from 1995 to 1999. A production ran in Australia in 1992, and a London revival starring John Barrowman and Paul Hipp opened at the Old Vic in 1993, directed by Michael Bogdanov. A &quot;Guardian&quot; review suggested that its failure stemmed from a cast of &quot;Thatcher&#x27;s children who didn&#x27;t really get it&quot;. South African productions began only after the eradication of apartheid. In 1996, Butler staged a revival in Chicago, concurrent with the 1996 Democratic National Convention, echoing the last time the DNC was in Chicago: 1968. A 30th-anniversary Off-off Broadway production was staged at Third Eye Repertory, directed by Shawn Rozsa.

=== 2000s and 2010s ===
In 2001, Reprise Theatre Company in Los Angeles performed &quot;Hair&quot; at the Wadsworth Theatre, starring Steven Weber as Berger, Sam Harris as Claude and Jennifer Leigh Warren as Sheila. &quot;Encores!&quot; presented a 2001 production at City Center, starring Luther Creek, Idina Menzel and Tom Plotkin, with MacDermot playing the keyboards. An Actors&#x27; Fund benefit of the show was performed for oneÂ night at the New Amsterdam Theater in New York City in 2004 a starry cast.

In 2005, a London production opened at the Gate Theatre, directed by Daniel Kramer. Rado approved an updating of the musical&#x27;s script to place it in the context of the Iraq War. In Kramer&#x27;s modernized interpretation, the nudity that called to mind images from Abu Ghraib. In 2006, Rado collaborated with director Robert Prior for a CanStage production in Toronto. A revival produced by Pieter Toerien toured South Africa in 2007, directed by Paul Warwick Griffin. Butler produced &quot;Hair&quot; at the MET Theatre in Los Angeles from September through December 2007, directed and choreographed by Bo Crowell, with musical direction from Christian Nesmith. It won the LA Weekly Theater Award for Musical of the Year.
For threeÂ nights in September 2007, Joe&#x27;s Pub and the Public Theater presented a 40th-anniversary production at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park. This concert version, directed by Diane Paulus, featured MacDermot on the keyboards and starred Jonathan Groff as Claude, Karen Olivo as Sheila and Will Swenson as Berger. Actors from the original Broadway production joined the cast on stage during the encore of &quot;Let the Sun Shine In&quot;. Demand for the show was extraordinary. The Public presented a fully staged production of &quot;Hair&quot; at the Delacorte from July to September 2008. Paulus again directed, with choreography by Karole Armitage. Groff and Swenson returned as Claude and Berger, with others from the concert cast. Caren Lyn Manuel played Sheila, and Christopher J. Hanke replaced Groff as Claude on August 17. Reviews were generally positive, with Ben Brantley of &quot;The New York Times&quot; writing that &quot;this production establishes the show as more than a vivacious period piece&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; magazine wrote: &quot;&quot;Hair&quot; ... has been reinvigorated and reclaimed as one of the great milestones in musical-theatre history. ... Today &quot;Hair&quot; seems, if anything, more daring than ever.&quot;

==== 2009 Broadway revival and 2010 U.S. national tour ====
The Public Theater production transferred to Broadway at the Al Hirschfeld Theatre, beginning previews on March 6, 2009, with an official opening on March 31, 2009. Paulus and Armitage again directed and choreographed, and most of the cast returned from the production in the park. A pre-performance ticket lottery was held nightly for $25 box-seat tickets. The opening cast included Gavin Creel as Claude, Swenson as Berger, Caissie Levy as Sheila, Megan Lawrence as Mother and Sasha Allen as Dionne. Designers included Scott Pask (sets), Michael McDonald (costumes), Kevin Adams (lighting), and Acme Sound Partners (sound). Critical response was almost uniformly positive. The &quot;New York Daily News&quot; review praised the direction, &quot;colorfully kinetic&quot; choreography and technical features, commenting that &quot;as a smile-inducing celebration of life and freedom, [&quot;Hair&quot; is] highly communicable&quot; and warning: &quot;If you&#x27;re seated on the aisle, count on [the cast] to be in your face or your lap&quot;. The &quot;New York Post&quot; wrote of the &quot;triumphant&quot; production: These days, the nation is fixated less on war and more on the economy. As a result, the scenes that resonate most are the ones in which the kids exultantly reject the rat race.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; enthused, &quot;Paulus and her prodigiously talented cast ... cut right to the 1967 rock musical&#x27;s heart, generating tremendous energy. ... If this explosive production doesn&#x27;t stir something in you ... check your pulse.&quot; &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; dissented, saying the revival &quot;felt canned&quot; and &quot;overblown&quot; and &quot;feels unbearably naive and unforgivably glib&quot;. Ben Brantley, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, reflected the majority:

The Public Theater struggled to raise the budget for the Broadway transfer. Paulus helped keep costs low by using an inexpensive set, and the show sold well. On April 30, 2009, on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, the cast recreated a performance on the same stage at the Ed Sullivan Theater by the original tribe. The production won the Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical, and the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Revival of a Musical By August, the revival had recouped its $5,760,000 investment, becoming one of the fastest-recouping musicals in Broadway history. Its cast album was nominated for the 2010 Grammy Award for Best Musical Show Album. When the Broadway cast transferred to London for the 2010 West-End revival, a mostly new tribe took over on Broadway on March 9, 2010, including Ace Young as Berger, Diana DeGarmo as Sheila, Kyle Riabko as Claude, Annaleigh Ashford as Jeanie, and Vanessa Ray as Chrissie. Rachel Bay Jones later played Mother and other roles. Sales decreased, and the revival closed on June 27, 2010, after 29 previews and 519 regular performances.

A U.S. national tour of the production began on October 21, 2010, starring Steel Burkhardt as Berger, Paris Remillard as Claude and Caren Lyn Tackett as Sheila. The tour received mostly positive reviews. The show returned to Broadway at the St. James Theatre from July 5 through September 10, 2011. After that stop, the tour resumed. The tour ended on January 29, 2012.

==== 2010 West End revival ====
The 2009 Broadway production was duplicated at the Gielgud Theatre in London&#x27;s West End. Previews began on April 1, 2010, with an official opening on April 14. The producers were the Public Theater, together with Cameron Mackintosh and Broadway Across America. Nearly all of the New York cast relocated, but Luther Creek played Woof. The revival closed on September 4, 2010.

A review by Michael Billington of &quot;The Guardian&quot; described it as &quot;a vibrant, joyous piece of living theatre&quot;, writing, &quot;it celebrates a period when the joy of life was pitted against the forces of intolerance and the death-dealing might of the militaryâindustrial complex.&quot; Charles Spencer in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; agreed: &quot;This is a timely and irresistibly vital revival of the greatest of all rock musicals.&quot; Michael Coveney of &quot;The Independent&quot; wrote that &quot;Hair&quot; is &quot;one of the great musicals of all time, and a phenomenon that, I&#x27;m relieved to discover, stands up as a period piece&quot;. In &quot;The Times&quot;, Benedict Nightingale commented that &quot;it&#x27;s exhilarating, as well as oddly poignant, when a multihued cast ... race downstage while delivering that tuneful salute to an age of Aquarius that still refuses to dawn.&quot;

====2014âpresent====
In August 2014, &quot;Hair&quot; returned for a three-night engagement at the Hollywood Bowl. Directed by Adam Shankman, the cast included Kristen Bell as Sheila, Hunter Parrish as Claude, Benjamin Walker as Berger, Amber Riley as Dionne, Jenna Ushkowitz as Jeanie, Sarah Hyland as Crissy, Mario as Hud, and Beverly D&#x27;Angelo and Kevin Chamberlin as Claude&#x27;s parents.

A 2016 production in Manchester, England, at the Hope Mill Theatre, directed by Jonathan O&#x27;Boyle, starring Robert Metson as Claude, Laura Johnson as Sheila and Ryan Anderson as Berger, earned positive reviews. In 2017, the musical&#x27;s 50th anniversary, the staging was repeated Off West End at The Vaults theatre in London, with Metson and Johnson repeating their roles and Andy Coxon as Berger. The production won the WhatsOnStage Award for Best Off-West End Production. A UK national tour of the production began in March 2019, starring Jake Quickenden as Berger, Daisy Wood-Davis as Sheila, Paul Wilkins as Claude and Marcus Collins as Hud.

=== International success ===

&quot;Hair&quot; has been performed in most countries. After the Berlin Wall fell, the show traveled for the first time to Poland, Lebanon, the Czech Republic and Sarajevo (featured on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Nightline&quot;, when Phil Alden Robinson visited in 1996 and discovered a production of &quot;Hair&quot; there in the midst of the war). In 1999, Butler and director Bo Crowell helped produce &quot;Hair&quot; in Russia at the Stas Namin Theatre in Moscow&#x27;s Gorky Park. The production caused a similar reaction as the original did 30Â years earlier because Russian soldiers were fighting in Chechnya at the time.

Rado wrote in 2003 that the only places where the show had not been performed were &quot;China, India, Vietnam, the Arctic and Antarctic continents as well as most African countries.&quot; Since then, an Indian production has been mounted.

== Adaptations ==
=== Film ===

A musical film adaptation was released in 1979. Directed by MiloÅ¡ Forman with choreography by Twyla Tharp and a screenplay by Michael Weller, the film stars John Savage, Treat Williams and Beverly D&#x27;Angelo, with Golden, Moore, Dyson, Foley, Dorsey Wright, Don Dacus, Nell Carter and Cheryl Barnes. It was nominated for two Golden Globes: Best Motion Picture â Musical or Comedy, and New Star of the Year in a Motion Picture (for Williams), and Forman was nominated for a CÃ©sar Award.

Several songs were deleted, and the film&#x27;s more conventionally romantic storyline departs greatly from the musical. Claude is rewritten as an innocent draftee from Oklahoma, newly arrived in New York to join the military, and Sheila is a high-society debutante who catches his eye. The friendly tribe adopts the farm boy in Central Park and, led by Berger, tries to facilitate the romance. During Claude&#x27;s basic training, they bring Sheila for a tryst with Claude, substituting Berger in his barracks wearing Claude&#x27;s dogtags. A mistake leads Berger to be taken to Vietnam in Claude&#x27;s place, where he is killed. While the film received generally positive reviews, Ragni and Rado said its comic portrayal of the tribe failed to capture the essence of &quot;Hair&quot; by portraying hippies as &quot;oddballs&quot; without any connection to the peace movement.

== Popular culture ==

&quot;The New York Times&quot; noted in 2007 that &quot;&quot;Hair&quot; was one of the last Broadway musicals to saturate the culture as shows from the golden age once regularly did.&quot; Songs from the musical have been featured in films and television episodes. For example, in the 2005 film &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;, the character Willy Wonka welcomed the children with lyrics from &quot;Good Morning Starshine&quot;. &quot;Aquarius&quot; was performed in the final episode of &quot;Laverne and Shirley&quot; in 1983, where the character Carmine moves to New York City and auditions for &quot;Hair&quot;. &quot;Aquarius/Let the Sun Shine In&quot; was also performed in the final scene in the film &quot;The 40-Year-Old Virgin&quot;, and Three Dog Night&#x27;s recording of &quot;Easy to Be Hard&quot; was featured in David Fincher&#x27;s film &quot;Zodiac&quot;. On &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;The Springfield Files&quot;, townspeople sing &quot;Good Morning Starshine&quot;. The episode &quot;Hairography&quot; of &quot;Glee&quot; includes a mash-up of the songs &quot;Hair&quot; and &quot;Crazy in Love&quot; by BeyoncÃ©. &quot;Head of the Class&quot; featured a two-part episode in 1990, titled &quot;Hair to Eternity&quot;, in which the head of the English department is determined to disrupt the school&#x27;s performance of &quot;Hair&quot;.

&quot;Hair&quot; continues to be a popular choice for high-school, university, and amateur productions. In 2002, Peter Jennings featured a Boulder, Colorado, high-school production in his ABC documentary series &quot;In Search of America&quot;. A 2006 community theater production in Red Bank, New Jersey, was singled out by Butler as &quot;one of the best &quot;Hair&quot;s I have seen in a long time.&quot; A production by Mountain Play ran at the 4,000-seat Cushing Memorial Amphitheatre in Mount Tamalpais State Park in Mill Valley, California, in 2007.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Hair&quot; was Broadway&#x27;s &quot;first fully realized&quot; concept musical, a form that dominated the musical theatre of the seventies. While the development of the concept musical was an unexpected consequence of &quot;Hair&quot; tenure on Broadway, the expected rock music revolution on Broadway turned out to be less than complete.

MacDermot followed &quot;Hair&quot; with three successive rock scores: &quot;Two Gentlemen of Verona&quot; (1971); &quot;Dude&quot; (1972), a second collaboration with Ragni; and &quot;Via Galactica&quot; (1972). While &quot;Two Gentlemen of Verona&quot; found receptive audiences and a Tony for Best Musical, &quot;Dude&quot; failed after just sixteenÂ performances, and &quot;Via Galactica&quot; flopped after a month. According to Horn, these and other such &quot;failures may have been the result of producers simply relying on the label &#x27;rock musical&#x27; to attract audiences without regard to the quality of the material presented&quot;. By the late 1970s, the genre had played itself out. Audience tastes in the 1980s turned to megamusicals with pop scores. Some later rock musicals, such as &quot;Rent&quot; (1996) and &quot;Spring Awakening&quot; (2006), as well as jukebox musicals featuring rock music, like &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; (2002) and &quot;Rock of Ages&quot; (2009), have found success. But the rock musical did not quickly come to dominate the musical theatre stage after &quot;Hair&quot;. Critic Clive Barnes commented: &quot;No major rock musician ever did a rock score for Broadway. ... &quot;Tommy&quot; ... was never conceived as a Broadway show. ... And one can see why. There&#x27;s so much more money in records and rock concerts.&quot; The continued popularity of &quot;Hair&quot; in the 21st century is seen in its number ten ranking in a 2006 BBC Radio 2 listener poll of the &quot;[United Kingdom]&#x27;s Number One Essential Musicals&quot;.

On the other hand, &quot;Hair&quot; had a profound effect not only on what was acceptable on Broadway, but as part of the very social movements that it celebrated. For example, in 1970, Butler, Castelli and the various &quot;Hair&quot; casts contributed to fundraising for the World Assembly of Youth. The Assembly enabled 750 young representatives from around the world to meet in New York in July 1970 to discuss social issues. For about a week, cast members worldwide collected donations at every show for the fund. &quot;Hair&quot; raised around $250,000 and ended up being the principal financier of the Assembly. Cast and crew also contributed a day&#x27;s pay, and Butler contributed a day&#x27;s profits from these productions. Moreover, as Ellen Stewart, founder of La MaMa E. T. C., noted:

<text>Squaring the square is the problem of tiling an integral square using only other integral squares. (An integral square is a square whose sides have integer length.) The name was coined in a humorous analogy with squaring the circle. Squaring the square is an easy task unless additional conditions are set. The most studied restriction is that the squaring be perfect, meaning the sizes of the smaller squares are all different. A related problem is squaring the plane, which can be done even with the restriction that each natural number occurs exactly once as a size of a square in the tiling. The order of a squared square is its number of constituent squares.

== Perfect squared squares ==
A &quot;perfect&quot; squared square is a square such that each of the smaller squares has a different size.

Perfect squared squares were studied by R. L. Brooks, C. A. B. Smith, A. H. Stone and W. T. Tutte (writing under the collective pseudonym &quot;Blanche Descartes&quot;) at Cambridge University between 1936 and 1938. They transformed the square tiling into an equivalent electrical circuit â they called it a &quot;Smith diagram&quot; â by considering the squares as resistors that connected to their neighbors at their top and bottom edges, and then applied Kirchhoff&#x27;s circuit laws and circuit decomposition techniques to that circuit. The first perfect squared squares they found were of order 69.

The first perfect squared square to be published, a compound one of side 4205 and order 55, was found by Roland Sprague in 1939.

Martin Gardner published an extensive article written by W. T. Tutte about the early history of squaring the square in his &quot;Mathematical Games&quot; column of November 1958.

== Simple squared squares ==

A &quot;simple&quot; squared square is one where no subset of more than one of the squares forms a rectangle or square. When a squared square has a square or rectangular subset, it is &quot;compound&quot;.

In 1978, discovered a simple perfect squared square of side 112 with the smallest number of squares using a computer search. His tiling uses 21 squares, and has been proved to be minimal. This squared square forms the logo of the Trinity Mathematical Society. It also appears on the cover of the Journal of Combinatorial Theory.

Duijvestijn also found two simple perfect squared squares of sides 110 but each comprising 22 squares. Theophilus Harding Willcocks, an amateur mathematician and fairy chess composer, found another. In 1999, I. Gambini proved that these three are the smallest perfect squared squares in terms of side length.

The perfect compound squared square with the fewest squares was discovered by T.H. Willcocks in 1946 and has 24 squares; however, it was not until 1982 that Duijvestijn, Pasquale Joseph Federico and P. Leeuw mathematically proved it to be the lowest-order example.

== Mrs. Perkins&#x27;s quilt ==

When the constraint of all the squares being different sizes is relaxed, a squared square such that the side lengths of the smaller squares do not have a common divisor larger than 1 is called a &quot;Mrs. Perkins&#x27;s quilt&quot;. In other words, the greatest common divisor of all the smaller side lengths should be 1. The Mrs. Perkins&#x27;s quilt problem asks for a Mrs. Perkins&#x27;s quilt with the fewest pieces for a given formula_1 square. The number of pieces required is at least formula_2, and at most formula_3. Computer searches have found exact solutions for small values of formula_4 (small enough to need up to 18 pieces). For formula_5 the number of pieces required is:
== No more than two different sizes ==

For any integer formula_4 other than 2, 3, and 5, it is possible to dissect a square into formula_4 squares of one or two different sizes.

== Squaring the plane ==
In 1975, Solomon Golomb raised the question whether the whole plane can be tiled by squares, one of each integer edge-length, which he called the heterogeneous tiling conjecture. This problem was later publicized by Martin Gardner in his Scientific American column and appeared in several books, but it defied solution for over 30 years.

In &quot;Tilings and patterns&quot;, published in 1987, Branko GrÃ¼nbaum and G. C. Shephard describe a way of tiling of the plane by integral squares by recursively taking any perfect squared square and enlarging it so that the formerly smallest tile has the size of the original squared square, then replacing this tile with a copy of the original squared square. The recursive scaling process increases the sizes of the squares exponentially â skipping most integers â a feature which they note was true of all perfect integral tilings of the plane known at that time.

In 2008 James Henle and Frederick Henle proved Golomb&#x27;s heterogeneous tiling conjecture: there exists a tiling of the plane by squares, one of each integer size. Their proof is constructive and proceeds by &quot;puffing up&quot; an L-shaped region formed by two side-by-side and horizontally flush squares of different sizes to a perfect tiling of a larger rectangular region, then adjoining the square of the smallest size not yet used to get another, larger L-shaped region. The squares added during the puffing up procedure have sizes that have not yet appeared in the construction and the procedure is set up so that the resulting rectangular regions are expanding in all four directions, which leads to a tiling of the whole plane.

== Cubing the cube ==

Cubing the cube is the analogue in three dimensions of squaring the square: that is, given a cube &quot;C&quot;, the problem of dividing it into finitely many smaller cubes, no two congruent.

Unlike the case of squaring the square, a hard yet solvable problem, there is no perfect cubed cube and, more generally, no dissection of a rectangular cuboid &quot;C&quot; into a finite number of unequal cubes.

To prove this, we start with the following claim: for any perfect dissection of a &quot;rectangle&quot; in squares, the smallest square in this dissection does not lie on an edge of the rectangle. Indeed, each corner square has a smaller adjacent edge square, and the smallest edge square is adjacent to smaller squares not on the edge.

Now suppose that there is a perfect dissection of a rectangular cuboid in cubes. Make a face of &quot;C&quot; its horizontal base. The base is divided into a perfect squared rectangle &quot;R&quot; by the cubes which rest on it. The smallest square &quot;s&quot;1 in &quot;R&quot; is surrounded by &quot;larger&quot;, and therefore &quot;higher&quot;, cubes. Hence the upper face of the cube on &quot;s&quot;1 is divided into a perfect squared square by the cubes which rest on it. Let &quot;s&quot;2 be the smallest square in this dissection. By the claim above, this is surrounded on all 4 sides by squares which are larger than &quot;s&quot;2 and therefore higher.

The sequence of squares &quot;s&quot;1, &quot;s&quot;2, ... is infinite and the corresponding cubes are infinite in number. This contradicts our original supposition.

If a 4-dimensional hypercube could be perfectly hypercubed then its &#x27;faces&#x27; would be perfect cubed cubes; this is impossible. Similarly, there is no solution for all cubes of higher dimensions.

<text>The Internet Chess Club (ICC) is a commercial Internet chess server devoted to the play and discussion of chess and chess variants. ICC had over 30,000 subscribing members in 2005. It was the first Internet chess server and was the largest pay to play chess server in 2005.

==History==
The first Internet chess server (ICS), programmed by Michael Moore and Richard Nash, was launched on 15 January 1992. Players logged in by telnet, and the board was displayed as ASCII text. Bugs in the server software allowed illegal moves, false checkmates etc. Over time more and more features were added to ICS, such as Elo ratings and a choice of graphical interfaces. The playing pool grew steadily, many of the server bugs were fixed, and players began to have higher expectations for stability.

Later on in 1992, Daniel Sleator (darooha) volunteered to take over as head programmer, and began a large overhaul of the server code. He addressed, among other issues, the frequent complaint that players would lose blitz games on time due to Internet lag. In 1994, he copyrighted the code, and began receiving purchase offers from companies wanting to commercialize the server. On 1 March 1995, Sleator announced his intentions to commercialize ICS, renaming it the Internet Chess Club, or ICC, and charging a yearly membership fee. The membership is free for players with a Grandmaster or International Master title.

Some programmers who had worked on the original ICS became unhappy with what they saw as the commoditization of their project. Led by Chris Petroff, they formed the Free Internet Chess Server (FICS), which to this day continues to allow everyone to access all features for free.

On 29 May 2007, the World Chess Network was bought by the Internet Chess Club. It was then merged with Chess Live, another Internet chess server acquired by Internet Chess Club from GamesParlor. The result of the acquisition and merger was the formation of World Chess Live, a new Internet chess server that merged features of both services. World Chess Live merged into, and become part of, the Internet Chess Club on 19 March 2012. For some years, the Spanish on-line chess portal JaqueMate.org had technological support provided by ICC. The portal closed on 30 April 2013 with members transferred to ICC.

==Services available==
ICC&#x27;s core service is the facility to play chess games (and a number of chess variants) against other members and computers coupled with a rating system. ICC also offers many different types of tournaments. ICC recently partnered with the United States Chess Federation (USCF) to provide USCF rated online quick and blitz tournaments (these online ratings are separate from the USCF over-the-board quick and blitz rating systems apart from the initial seeding of the online quick and blitz ratings for unrated players). Members can also watch live broadcasts of tournaments with grandmaster commentary on Chess.FM, watch games involving titled players being played on ICC and challenge grandmasters in simultaneous exhibitions. The site also offers access to libraries of games, recorded lectures and private lessons (at additional cost).

==Criticism==
The commercialisation of ICC was extensively criticised by users, particularly that Daniel Sleator was charging a subscription to use a system that had been developed by others. Following complaints by students, they were offered a 50% discount.

The security of the system was criticised in December 2005 with claims that communications between ICC and users could easily be read and that the timestamping could be defeated.

==Internet Computer Chess Tournament==
The Internet Computer Chess Tournament (CCT) was a chess tournament for computer chess programs held from 2000 to 2011. It was organised annually by the Internet Chess Club. The format was a Swiss system varying between 7 and 9 game rounds, with time controls (from CCT7 onwards) of 50 minutes and 3 second increments. The tournament was set to be completed in one weekend.

<text>Primo Conti (16 October 1900 â 12 November 1988) was an Italian futurist artist.

Conti was born in Florence. Between the ages of 8 and 9, he showed precocious talent in the fields of music, poetry and painting. In 1913 he met the Futurists.

His attraction to the latest innovations was expressed in almost completely Futurist forms in his drawings, while he developed a unique style in his painting that was a mixture of Art Nouveau, Fauvism, Expressionism and Orphism. It was not until 1917, after meeting with Giacomo Balla in Rome, and with Filippo Tommaso Marinetti in Naples (who later enthusiastically praised Conti&#x27;s book &quot;Imbottigliature&quot; which was about to be printed) that Conti became part of the Futurist movement. His contribution to the movement was not only his literary works but also the paintings and drawings he produced between 1917 and 1919âthe years in which his work was taking on the metaphysical style.

The 1920s were a complex period for Conti. He explored Mannerism, Exoticism, Pittura Metafisica, and great historical and religious painting, covering a vast area that can be compared with his keen interest in the theatrical and literary world of Luigi Pirandello, Massimo Bontempelli and Enrico Pea, which led him to found the Viareggio Prize in 1929.
The 1930s brought a series of alternating events that created problems in his private life and led to his celebrative paintings. The decade also saw his enforced adhesion to Fascism (joining the Partito Nazionale Fascista), and his inner rebellion against it which transpired from his refusal to join Margherita Sarfatti&#x27;s Novecento Italiano group and from other episodes when he stepped out of line. New prospects were only opened up to him when he became involved in designing stage sets for the opera house with the foundation of the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino.

By the 1940s, long before the official rediscovery (20 years later) of the Futurist movement, Conti was again working on Futurist subjects and experiments. From 1948 to 1963 he followed the rules of the Order of the Franciscans, though he still continued to paint.

Many of his works are housed in the Museo Primo Conti (Primo Conti Foundation Museum ) in the Villa le Coste at Fiesole (near Florence).

<doc id="67911" wikidata="Q1427965" url="?curid=67911" title="Busy beaver">
<text>In theoretical computer science, the busy beaver game aims to find a terminating program of a given size that (depending on definition) either produces the most output possible, or runs for the longest number of steps. Since an endlessly looping program producing infinite output or running for infinite time is easily conceived, such programs are excluded from the game. Rather than traditional programming languages, the programs used in the game are n-state Turing machines, one of the first mathematical models of computation.

Turing machines consist of an infinite tape, and a finite set of states which serve as the program&#x27;s &quot;source code&quot;. Producing the most output is defined as writing the largest number of 1s on the tape, also referred to as achieving the highest score, and running for the longest time is defined as taking the longest number of steps to halt. The &quot;n-&quot;state busy beaver game consists of finding the longest-running or highest-scoring Turing machine which has &quot;n&quot; states and eventually halts. Such machines are assumed to start on a blank tape, and the tape is assumed to contain only zeros and ones (a binary Turing machine). The objective of the game is to program a set of transitions between states aiming for the highest score or longest running time while making sure the machine will halt eventually.

An n&quot;-th busy beaver,BB-&quot;n or simply &quot;busy beaver&quot; is a Turing machine that wins the &quot;n&quot;-state busy beaver game. Depending on definition, it either attains the highest score, or runs for the longest time, among all other possible &quot;n&quot;-state competing Turing machines. The functions determining the highest score or longest running time of the &quot;n&quot;-state busy beavers by each definition are Î£(n) and S(n) respectively.

Deciding the running time or score of the &quot;n&quot;th Busy Beaver is incomputable. In fact, both the functions Î£(n) and S(n) eventually become larger than any computable function. This has implications in computability theory, the halting problem, and complexity theory. The concept of a busy beaver was first introduced by Tibor RadÃ³ in his 1962 paper, &quot;On Non-Computable Functions&quot;. One of the most interesting aspects of the busy beaver game is that, if it were possible to compute the functions Î£(n) and S(n) for all &quot;n&quot;, then this would resolve all mathematical conjectures which can be encoded in the form &quot;does &lt;this Turing machine&gt; halt&quot;. For example, a 27-state Turing machine could check Goldbach&#x27;s conjecture for each number and halt on a counterexample: if this machine had not halted after running for S(27) steps, then it must run forever, resolving the conjecture. Many other problems, including the Riemann hypothesis (744 states) and the consistency of ZF set theory (745 states), can be expressed in a similar form, where at most a countably infinite number of cases need to be checked.

==Technical definition==
The &quot;n&quot;-state busy beaver game (or BB-&quot;n&quot; game), introduced in Tibor RadÃ³&#x27;s 1962 paper, involves a class of Turing machines, each member of which is required to meet the following design specifications:

*The machine has &quot;n&quot; &quot;operational&quot; states plus a Halt state, where &quot;n&quot; is a positive integer, and one of the &quot;n&quot; states is distinguished as the starting state. (Typically, the states are labelled by 1, 2, ..., &quot;n&quot;, with state 1 as the starting state, or by &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, ..., with state &quot;A&quot; as the starting state.)
*The machine uses a single two-way infinite (or unbounded) tape.
*The tape alphabet is {0, 1}, with 0 serving as the blank symbol.
*The machine&#x27;s &quot;transition function&quot; takes two inputs:
:#the current non-Halt state,
:#the symbol in the current tape cell,
:and produces three outputs:
:#a symbol to write over the symbol in the current tape cell (it may be the same symbol as the symbol overwritten),
:#a direction to move (left or right; that is, shift to the tape cell one place to the left or right of the current cell), and
:#a state to transition into (which may be the Halt state).
&quot;Running&quot; the machine consists of starting in the starting state, with the current tape cell being any cell of a blank (all-0) tape, and then iterating the transition function until the Halt state is entered (if ever). If, and only if, the machine eventually halts, then the number of 1s finally remaining on the tape is called the machine&#x27;s &quot;score&quot;. The &quot;n&quot;-state busy beaver (BB-&quot;n&quot;) game is therefore a contest, depending on definition to find such an &quot;n&quot;-state Turing machine having the largest possible score or running time.

=== Example ===

The rules for one 1-state Turing machine might be:
* In state 1, if the current symbol is 0, write a 1, move one space to the right, and transition to state 1
* In state 1, if the current symbol is 1, write a 0, move one space to the right, and transition to HALT

This Turing machine would move to the right, swapping the value of all the bits it passes. Since the starting tape is all 0s, it would make an unending string of ones. This machine would not be a busy beaver contender because it runs forever on a blank tape.

== Functions ==
In his original 1962 paper, RadÃ³ defined two functions related to the busy beaver game: the score function Î£(n) and the shifts function S(n). Both take a number of Turing machine states formula_1 and output the maximum score attainable by a Turing machine of that number of states by some measure. The score function Î£(n) gives the maximum number of 1s an formula_1-state Turing machine can output before halting, while the shifts function S(n) gives the maximum number of shifts (or equivalently steps, because each step includes a shift) that an formula_1-state Turing machine can undergo before halting. He proved that both of these functions were noncomputable, because they each grew faster than any computable function. The function BB(n) has been defined to be either of these functions, so that notation is not used in this article.

A number of other uncomputable functions can also be defined based on measuring the performance of Turing machines in other ways than time or maximal number of ones. For example:
* The function formula_4 is defined to be the maximum number of &quot;contiguous&quot; ones a halting Turing machine can write on a blank tape. In other words, this is the largest unary number a Turing machine of &quot;n&quot; states can write on a tape.
* The function formula_5 is defined to be the maximal number of tape squares a halting Turing machine can &quot;read&quot; (i.e., visit) before halting. This includes the starting square, but not a square that the machine only reaches after the halt transition (if the halt transition is annotated with a move direction), because that square does not influence the machine&#x27;s behaviour. This is the maximal space complexity of an &quot;n&quot;-state Turing machine.
These four functions together stand in the relation formula_6. More functions can also be defined by operating the game on different computing machines, such as 3-symbol Turing machines, non-deterministic Turing machines, the lambda calculus or even arbitrary programming languages.

===Score function Î£===

The score function quantifies the maximum score attainable by a busy beaver on a given measure. This is a noncomputable function, because it grows asymptotically faster than any computable function.

The score function, formula_7, is defined so that Î£(&quot;n&quot;) is the maximum attainable score (the maximum number of 1s finally on the tape) among all halting 2-symbol &quot;n&quot;-state Turing machines of the above-described type, when started on a blank tape.

It is clear that Î£ is a well-defined function: for every &quot;n&quot;, there are at most finitely many &quot;n&quot;-state Turing machines as above, up to isomorphism, hence at most finitely many possible running times.

According to the score-based definition, any &quot;n&quot;-state 2-symbol Turing machine &quot;M&quot; for which (i.e., which attains the maximum score) is called a busy beaver. For each &quot;n&quot;, there exist at least 4(&quot;n&quot; â 1)! &quot;n&quot;-state busy beavers. (Given any &quot;n&quot;-state busy beaver, another is obtained by merely changing the shift direction in a halting transition, a third by reversing &quot;all&quot; shift directions uniformly, and a fourth by reversing the halt direction of the all-swapped busy beaver. Furthermore, a permutation of all states except Start and Halt produces a machine that attains the same score. Theoretically, there could be more than one kind of transition leading to the halting state, but in practice it would be wasteful, because there is only one sequence of state transitions producing the sought-after result.)

==== Non-computability ====
RadÃ³&#x27;s 1962 paper proved that if formula_8 is any computable function, then Î£(&quot;n&quot;) &gt; &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) for all sufficiently large &quot;n&quot;, and hence that Î£ is not a computable function.

Moreover, this implies that it is undecidable by a general algorithm whether an arbitrary Turing machine is a busy beaver. (Such an algorithm cannot exist, because its existence would allow Î£ to be computed, which is a proven impossibility. In particular, such an algorithm could be used to construct another algorithm that would compute Î£ as follows: for any given &quot;n&quot;, each of the finitely many &quot;n&quot;-state 2-symbol Turing machines would be tested until an &quot;n&quot;-state busy beaver is found; this busy beaver machine would then be simulated to determine its score, which is by definition Î£(&quot;n&quot;).)

Even though Î£(&quot;n&quot;) is an uncomputable function, there are some small &quot;n&quot; for which it is possible to obtain its values and prove that they are correct. It is not hard to show that Î£(0) = 0, Î£(1) = 1, Î£(2) = 4, and with progressively more difficulty it can be shown that Î£(3) = 6, Î£(4) = 13 and Î£(5) = 4098 . Î£(&quot;n&quot;) has not yet been determined for any instance of &quot;n&quot; &gt; 5, although lower bounds have been established (see the Known values section below).

====Complexity and unprovability of Î£====

A variant of Kolmogorov complexity is defined as follows: The &quot;complexity&quot; of a number &quot;n&quot; is the smallest number of states needed for a BB-class Turing machine that halts with a single block of &quot;n&quot; consecutive 1s on an initially blank tape. The corresponding variant of Chaitin&#x27;s incompleteness theorem states that, in the context of a given axiomatic system for the natural numbers, there exists a number &quot;k&quot; such that no specific number can be proven to have complexity greater than &quot;k&quot;, and hence that no specific upper bound can be proven for Î£(&quot;k&quot;) (the latter is because &quot;the complexity of &quot;n&quot; is greater than &quot;k&quot;&quot; would be proven if were proven). As mentioned in the cited reference, for any axiomatic system of &quot;ordinary mathematics&quot; the least value &quot;k&quot; for which this is true is far less than 10â10; consequently, in the context of ordinary mathematics, neither the value nor any upper-bound of Î£(10â10) can be proven. (GÃ¶del&#x27;s first incompleteness theorem is illustrated by this result: in an axiomatic system of ordinary mathematics, there is a true-but-unprovable sentence of the form , and there are infinitely many true-but-unprovable sentences of the form .)

===Maximum shifts function &quot;S&quot;===
In addition to the function Î£, RadÃ³ [1962] introduced another extreme function for Turing machines, the maximum shifts function, &quot;S&quot;, defined as follows:

* = the number of shifts &quot;M&quot; makes before halting, for any ,
* = the largest number of shifts made by any halting &quot;n&quot;-state 2-symbol Turing machine.

Because normal Turing machines are required to have a shift in each and every transition or &quot;step&quot; (including any transition to a Halt state), the max-shifts function is at the same time a max-steps function.

RadÃ³ showed that &quot;S&quot; is noncomputable for the same reason that Î£ is noncomputable â it grows faster than any computable function. He proved this simply by noting that for each &quot;n&quot;, &quot;S&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) â¥ Î£(&quot;n&quot;). Each shift may write a 0 or a 1 on the tape, while Î£ counts a subset of the shifts that wrote a 1, namely the ones that hadn&#x27;t been overwritten by the time the Turing machine halted; consequently, &quot;S&quot; grows at least as fast as Î£, which had already been proved to grow faster than any computable function.

The following connection between Î£ and &quot;S&quot; was used by Lin &amp; RadÃ³ [&quot;Computer Studies of Turing Machine Problems&quot;, 1965] to prove that Î£(3) = 6 and that S(3)=21: For a given &quot;n&quot;, if &quot;S&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is known then all &quot;n&quot;-state Turing machines can (in principle) be run for up to &quot;S&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) steps, at which point any machine that hasn&#x27;t yet halted will never halt. At that point, by observing which machines have halted with the most 1s on the tape (i.e., the busy beavers), one obtains from their tapes the value of Î£(&quot;n&quot;). The approach used by Lin &amp; RadÃ³ for the case of &quot;n&quot; = 3 was to conjecture that &quot;S&quot;(3) = 21 (after unsuccessfully conjecturing 18), then to simulate all the essentially different 3-state machines (82,944 machines, equal to 23) for up to 21 steps. They found 26,073 machines that halted, including one that halted only after 21 steps. By analyzing the behavior of the machines that had not halted within 21 steps, they succeeded in showing that none of those machines would ever halt, most of them following a certain pattern. This proved the conjecture that &quot;S&quot;(3) = 21, and also determined that Î£(3) = 6, which was attained by several machines, all halting after 11 to 14 steps.

In 2016, Adam Yedidia and Scott Aaronson obtained the first (explicit) upper bound on the minimum &quot;n&quot; for which S(&quot;n&quot;) is unprovable in ZFC. To do so they constructed a 7910-state Turing machine whose behavior cannot be proven based on the usual axioms of set theory (ZermeloâFraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice), under reasonable consistency hypotheses (stationary Ramsey property). Stefan O&#x27;Rear then reduced it to 1919 states, with the dependency on the stationary Ramsey property eliminated, and later to 748 states. In July 2023, Riebel reduced it to 745 states.

===Proof for uncomputability of &quot;S&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) and Î£(&quot;n&quot;)===

Suppose that &quot;S&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is a computable function and let &quot;EvalS&quot; denote a TM, evaluating &quot;S&quot;(&quot;n&quot;). Given a tape with &quot;n&quot; 1s it will produce &quot;S&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) 1s on the tape and then halt. Let &quot;Clean&quot; denote a Turing machine cleaning the sequence of 1s initially written on the tape. Let &quot;Double&quot; denote a Turing machine evaluating function &quot;n&quot; + &quot;n&quot;. Given a tape with &quot;n&quot; 1s it will produce 2&quot;n&quot; 1s on the tape and then halt. 
Let us create the composition &quot;Double&quot; | &quot;EvalS&quot; | &quot;Clean&quot; and let &quot;n&quot;0 be the number of states of this machine. Let &quot;Create_n0&quot; denote a Turing machine creating &quot;n&quot;0 1s on an initially blank tape. This machine may be constructed in a trivial manner to have &quot;n&quot;0 states (the state &quot;i&quot; writes 1, moves the head right and switches to state &quot;i&quot; + 1, except the state &quot;n&quot;0, which halts). Let &quot;N&quot; denote the sum &quot;n&quot;0 + &quot;n&quot;0.

Let &quot;BadS&quot; denote the composition &quot;Create_n0&quot; | &quot;Double&quot; | &quot;EvalS&quot; | &quot;Clean&quot;. Notice that this machine has &quot;N&quot; states. Starting with an initially blank tape it first creates a sequence of &quot;n&quot;0 1s and then doubles it, producing a sequence of &quot;N&quot; 1s. Then &quot;BadS&quot; will produce &quot;S&quot;(&quot;N&quot;) 1s on tape, and at last it will clear all 1s and then halt. But the phase of cleaning will continue at least &quot;S&quot;(&quot;N&quot;) steps, so the time of working of &quot;BadS&quot; is strictly greater than &quot;S&quot;(&quot;N&quot;), which contradicts to the definition of the function &quot;S&quot;(&quot;n&quot;).

The uncomputability of Î£(&quot;n&quot;) may be proved in a similar way. In the above proof, one must exchange the machine &quot;EvalS&quot; with &quot;EvalÎ£&quot; and &quot;Clean&quot; with &quot;Increment&quot; â a simple TM, searching for a first 0 on the tape and replacing it with 1.

The uncomputability of &quot;S&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) can also be established by reference to the blank tape halting problem. The blank tape halting problem is the problem of deciding for any Turing machine whether or not it will halt when started on an empty tape. The blank tape halting problem is equivalent to the standard halting problem and so it is also uncomputable. If &quot;S&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) was computable, then we could solve the blank tape halting problem simply by running any given Turing machine with &quot;n&quot; states for &quot;S&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) steps; if it has still not halted, it never will. So, since the blank tape halting problem is not computable, it follows that &quot;S&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) must likewise be uncomputable.

=== Uncomputability of space(n) and num(n) ===
Both formula_5 and formula_4 functions are uncomputable. This can be shown for formula_5 by noting that every tape square a Turing machine writes a one to, it must also visit: in other words, formula_12. The formula_4 function can be shown to be incomputable by proving, for example, that formula_14: this can be done by designing an &quot;(3n+3)&quot;-state Turing machine which simulates the &quot;n&quot;-state space champion, and then uses it to write at least formula_5 contiguous ones to the tape.

== Generalizations ==
Analogs of the shift function can be simply defined in any programming language, given that the programs can be described by bit-strings, and a program&#x27;s number of steps can be counted. For example, the busy beaver game can also be generalized to two dimensions using Turing machines on two-dimensional tapes, or to Turing machines that are allowed to stay in the same place as well as move to the left and right. Alternatively a &quot;busy beaver function&quot; for diverse models of computation can be defined with Kolmogorov complexity. This is done by taking formula_16 to be the largest integer formula_17 such that formula_18, where formula_19 is the length of the shortest program in formula_20 that outputs formula_17: formula_16 is thereby the largest integer a program with length formula_1 or less can output in formula_20.

The longest running 6-state, 2-symbol machine which has the additional property of reversing the tape value at each step produces 1s after steps. So for the Reversal Turing Machine (RTM) class, &quot;S&quot;RTM(6) â¥ and Î£RTM(6) â¥ . Likewise we could define an analog to the Î£ function for register machines as the largest number which can be present in any register on halting, for a given number of instructions.

=== Different numbers of symbols ===
A simple generalization is the extension to Turing machines with &quot;m&quot; symbols instead of just 2 (0 and 1). For example a trinary Turing machine with &quot;m&quot; = 3 symbols would have the symbols 0, 1, and 2. The generalization to Turing machines with &quot;n&quot; states and &quot;m&quot; symbols defines the following generalized busy beaver functions:
# Î£(&quot;n&quot;, &quot;m&quot;): the largest number of non-zeros printable by an &quot;n&quot;-state, &quot;m&quot;-symbol machine started on an initially blank tape before halting, and
# &quot;S&quot;(&quot;n&quot;, &quot;m&quot;): the largest number of steps taken by an &quot;n&quot;-state, &quot;m&quot;-symbol machine started on an initially blank tape before halting.

For example, the longest-running 3-state 3-symbol machine found so far runs steps before halting.

=== Nondeterministic Turing machines ===
The problem can be extended to nondeterministic Turing machines by looking for the system with the most states across all branches or the branch with the longest number of steps. The question of whether a given NDTM will halt is still computationally irreducible, and the computation required to find an NDTM busy beaver is significantly greater than the deterministic case, since there are multiple branches that need to be considered. For a 2-state, 2-color system with &quot;p&quot; cases or rules, the table to the right gives the maximum number of steps before halting and maximum number of unique states created by the NDTM.

==Applications==

=== Open mathematical problems ===
In addition to posing a rather challenging mathematical game, the busy beaver functions Î£(n) and &quot;S&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) offer an entirely new approach to solving pure mathematics problems. Many open problems in mathematics could in theory, but not in practice, be solved in a systematic way given the value of &quot;S&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) for a sufficiently large &quot;n&quot;. Theoretically speaking, the value of S(n) encodes the answer to all mathematical conjectures that can be checked in infinite time by a Turing machine with less than or equal to &quot;n&quot; states.

Consider any formula_25 conjecture: any conjecture that could be disproven via a counterexample among a countable number of cases (e.g. Goldbach&#x27;s conjecture). Write a computer program that sequentially tests this conjecture for increasing values. In the case of Goldbach&#x27;s conjecture, we would consider every even number â¥ 4 sequentially and test whether or not it is the sum of two prime numbers. Suppose this program is simulated on an &quot;n&quot;-state Turing machine. If it finds a counterexample (an even number â¥ 4 that is not the sum of two primes in our example), it halts and indicates that. However, if the conjecture is true, then our program will never halt. (This program halts &quot;only&quot; if it finds a counterexample.)

Now, this program is simulated by an &quot;n&quot;-state Turing machine, so if we know &quot;S&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) we can decide (in a finite amount of time) whether or not it will ever halt by simply running the machine that many steps. And if, after &quot;S&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) steps, the machine does not halt, we know that it never will and thus that there are no counterexamples to the given conjecture (i.e., no even numbers that are not the sum of two primes). This would prove the conjecture to be true. Thus specific values (or upper bounds) for &quot;S&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) could be, in theory, used to systematically solve many open problems in mathematics.

However, current results on the busy beaver problem suggest that this will not be practical for two reasons:
* It is extremely hard to prove values for the busy beaver function (and the max shift function). Every known exact value of &quot;S&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) was proven by enumerating every &quot;n&quot;-state Turing machine and proving whether or not each halts. One would have to calculate &quot;S&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) by some less direct method for it to actually be useful.
* The values of S(n) and the other busy beaver functions get very large, very quickly. While the value of S(5) is only around 47 million, the value of S(6) is more than 10â15, which is equal to formula_26 with a stack of 15 tens. This number has 10â14 digits and is unreasonable to use in a computation. The value of S(27), which is the number of steps the current program for the Goldbach conjecture would need to be run to give a conclusive answer, is incomprehensibly huge, and not remotely possible to write down, much less run a machine for, in the observable universe.

==== Consistency of theories ====
Another property of S(n) is that no arithmetically sound, computably axiomatized theory can prove all of the function&#x27;s values. Specifically, given a computable and arithmetically sound theory formula_27, there is a number formula_28 such that for all formula_29, no statement of the form formula_30 can be proved in formula_27. This implies that for each theory there is a specific largest value of S(n) that it can prove. This is true because for every such formula_27, a Turing machine with formula_28 states can be designed to enumerate every possible proof in formula_27. If the theory is inconsistent, then all false statements are provable, and the Turing machine can be given the condition to halt if and only if it finds a proof of, for example, formula_35. Any theory that proves the value of formula_36 proves its own consistency, violating GÃ¶del&#x27;s second incompleteness theorem. This can be used to place various theories on a scale, for example the various large cardinal axioms in ZFC: if each theory formula_27 is assigned as its number formula_28, theories with larger values of formula_28 prove the consistency of those below them, placing all such theories on a countably infinite scale.

==== Notable examples ====
* A 745-state binary Turing machine has been constructed that halts if and only if ZFC is inconsistent.

* A 744-state Turing machine has been constructed that halts if, and only if, the Riemann hypothesis is false.

* A 43-state Turing machine was constructed that halts if, and only if, Goldbach&#x27;s conjecture is false. This was further reduced to 25-state machine, and later formally proved and verified in the Lean 4 theorem proving language.

* A 15-state Turing machine has been constructed that halts if and only if the following conjecture formulated by Paul ErdÅs in 1979 is false: for all &quot;n&quot; &gt; 8 there is at least one digit 2 in the base 3 representation of 2&quot;n&quot;.

=== Universal Turing machines ===
Exploring the relationship between computational universality and the dynamic behavior of Busy Beaver Turing machines, a conjecture was proposed in 2012 suggesting that Busy Beaver machines were natural candidates for Turing universality as they display complex characteristics, known for (1) their maximal computational complexity within size constraints, (2) their ability to perform non-trivial calculations before halting, and (3) the difficulty in finding and proving these machines; these features suggest that Busy Beaver machines possess the necessary complexity for universality.

== Known results ==
=== Lower bounds ===

==== Green machines ====
In 1964 Milton Green developed a lower bound for the 1s-counting variant of the Busy Beaver function that was published in the proceedings of the 1964 IEEE symposium on switching circuit theory and logical design. Heiner Marxen and JÃ¼rgen Buntrock described it as &quot;a non-trivial (not primitive recursive) lower bound&quot;. This lower bound can be calculated but is too complex to state as a single expression in terms of &quot;n&quot;. This was done with a set of Turing machines, each of which demonstrated the lower bound for a certain &quot;n&quot;. When &quot;n&quot;=8 the method gives
: formula_40.

In contrast, the best current (as of 2024) lower bound on formula_41 is formula_42, where each formula_43 is Knuth&#x27;s up-arrow notation. This represents formula_26, an exponentiated chain of 15 tens equal to formula_45. The value of formula_46 is probably much larger still than that.

Specifically, the lower bound was shown with a series of recursive Turing machines, each of which was made of a smaller one with two additional states that repeatedly applied the smaller machine to the input tape. Defining the value of the N-state busy-beaver competitor on a tape containing formula_17 ones to be formula_48 (the ultimate output of each machine being its value on formula_49, because a blank tape has 0 ones), the recursion relations are as follows: a
: formula_50
: formula_51
: formula_52
This leads to two formulas, for odd and even numbers, for calculating the lower bound given by the Nth machine, formula_53:
: formula_54 for odd N
: formula_55 for even N
The lower bound BB(N) can also be related to the Ackermann function. It can be shown that:
: formula_56

==== Relationships between Busy beaver functions ====
Trivially, S(n) â¥ Î£(n) because a machine that writes Î£(n) ones must take at least Î£(n) steps to do so. It is possible to give a number of upper bounds on the time S(n) with the number of ones Î£(n):
* formula_57 Â  (Rado)
* formula_58 Â  (Buro)
* formula_59 Â  (Julstrom and Zwick)
By defining num(n) to be the maximum number of ones an &quot;n&quot;-state Turing machine is allowed to output contiguously, rather than in any position (the largest unary number it can output), it is possible to show:
: formula_60
: formula_61
: formula_62 Â  (Ben-Amram, et al., 1996)

Ben-Amram and Petersen, 2002, also give an asymptotically improved bound on S(n). There exists a constant &quot;c&quot;, such that for all :

:formula_63

===Exact values and lower and upper bounds===
The following table lists the exact values and some known lower bounds for &quot;S&quot;(&quot;n&quot;), Î£(&quot;n&quot;), and several other busy beaver functions. In this table, 2-symbol Turing machines are used. Entries listed as &quot;?&quot; are at least as large as other entries to the left (because all n-state machines are also (n+1) state machines), and no larger than entries above them (because S(n) â¥ space(n) â¥ Î£(n) â¥ num(n)). So, space(6) is known to be greater than 10â15, as space(n) â¥ Î£(n) and Î£(6) &gt; 10â15. is an upper bound for space(5), because S(5) = () and S(n) â¥ space(n). 4098 is an upper bound for num(5), because Î£(5) = 4098 () and Î£(n) â¥ num(n). The last entry listed as &quot;?&quot; is num(6), because Î£(6) &gt; 10â15, but Î£(n) â¥ num(n).

The 5-state busy beaver was discovered by Heiner Marxen and JÃ¼rgen Buntrock in 1989, but only proved to be the winning fifth busy beaver â stylized as BB(5) â in 2024 using a proof in Coq.

=== List of busy beavers ===
These are tables of rules for Turing machines that generate Î£(1) and &quot;S&quot;(1), Î£(2) and &quot;S&quot;(2), Î£(3) (but not &quot;S&quot;(3)), Î£(4) and &quot;S&quot;(4), Î£(5) and &quot;S&quot;(5), and the best known lower bound for Î£(6) and &quot;S&quot;(6).

In the tables, columns represent the current state and rows represent the current symbol read from the tape. Each table entry is a string of three characters, indicating the symbol to write onto the tape, the direction to move, and the new state (in that order). The halt state is shown as H.

Each machine begins in state A with an infinite tape that contains all 0s. Thus, the initial symbol read from the tape is a 0.

Result key: (starts at the position , halts at the position )

Result: 0 0 0 (1 step, one &quot;1&quot; total)

Result: 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 (6 steps, four &quot;1&quot;s total)


Result: 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 (14 steps, six &quot;1&quot;s total).

This is one of several nonequivalent machines giving six 1s. Unlike the previous machines, this one is a busy beaver for Î£, but not for &quot;S&quot;. (&quot;S&quot;(3) = 21, and the machine obtains only five 1s.)


Result: 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 (107 steps, thirteen &quot;1&quot;s total)

Result: 4098 &quot;1&quot;s with 8191 &quot;0&quot;s interspersed in 47,176,870 steps.

Note in the image to the right how this solution is similar qualitatively to the evolution of some cellular automata. 

Result: 1 1 1 1 ... 1 1 1 (&quot;10&quot; followed by more than 10ââ15 contiguous &quot;1&quot;s in more than 10ââ15 steps, where 10ââ15=1010..10, an exponential tower of 15 tens).

==Visualizations==

In the following table, the rules for each busy beaver (maximizing Î£) are represented visually, with orange squares corresponding to a &quot;1&quot; on the tape, and white corresponding to &quot;0&quot;. The position of the head is indicated by the black ovoid, with the orientation of the head representing the state. Individual tapes are laid out horizontally, with time progressing from top to bottom. The halt state is represented by a rule which maps one state to itself (head doesn&#x27;t move).

He uses a computer program to prove that all but 27 machines which run over 107 steps are variants of Christmas Trees and Counters which can be proven to run infinitely. The last 27 machines (referred to as holdouts) are proven by personal inspection by Brady himself not to halt.
*: Machlin and Stout describe the busy beaver problem and many techniques used for finding busy beavers (which they apply to Turing Machines with 4-states and 2-symbols, thus verifying Brady&#x27;s proof). They suggest how to estimate a variant of Chaitin&#x27;s halting probability (Î©).
*: Marxen and Buntrock demonstrate that Î£(5)Â â¥Â 4098 and &quot;S&quot;(5)Â â¥Â  and describe in detail the method they used to find these machines and prove many others will never halt.
*: Green recursively constructs machines for any number of states and provides the recursive function that computes their score (computes Ï), thus providing a lower bound for Î£. This function&#x27;s growth is comparable to that of Ackermann&#x27;s function.
*: Busy beaver programs are described by Alexander Dewdney in &quot;Scientific American&quot;, August 1984, pages 19â23, also March 1985 p.Â 23 and April 1985 p. 30.
* 
*: Wherein Brady (of 4-state fame) describes some history of the beast and calls its pursuit &quot;The Busy Beaver Game&quot;. He describes other games (e.g. cellular automata and Conway&#x27;s Game of Life). Of particular interest is &quot;The Busy Beaver Game in Two Dimensions&quot; (p.Â 247). With 19 references.
*: Cf Chapter 9, Turing Machines. A difficult book, meant for electrical engineers and technical specialists. Discusses recursion, partial-recursion with reference to Turing Machines, halting problem. A reference in Booth attributes busy beaver to Rado. Booth also defines Rado&#x27;s busy beaver problem in &quot;home problems&quot; 3, 4, 5, 6 of Chapter 9, p.Â 396. Problem 3 is to &quot;show that the busy beaver problem is unsolvable... for all values of n.&quot;
*: Bounds between functions Î£ and &quot;S&quot;.
*: Improved bounds.
*: This article contains a complete classification of the 2-state, 3-symbol Turing machines, and thus a proof for the (2, 3) busy beaver: Î£(2, 3) = 9 and S(2, 3) = 38.
* 
*: This is the description of ideas, of the algorithms and their implementation, with the description of the experiments examining 5-state and 6-state Turing machines by parallel run on 31 4-core computer and finally the best results for 6-state TM.

<doc id="67915" wikidata="Q236259" url="?curid=67915" title="Plautia Urgulanilla">
<text>Plautia Urgulanilla was the first wife of the future Roman Emperor Claudius. They were married circa 9 AD, when he was 18 years old. Suetonius writes that they were divorced in 24 AD on the grounds of her scandalous love affairs and the suspicion of murder. 

== Family ==
Urgulanilla was a member of the Plautia gens. She was of Etruscan descent.

Her father was Marcus Plautius Silvanus, the consul for the year 2 BC, and a decorated general, honoured with triumphal ornaments for his successes in the Bellum Batonianum or Great Illyrian Revolt in 12 AD. He had served beside Tiberius. Her paternal grandmother was Urgulania, after whom Urgulanilla was named; her maternal grandmother was also a close friend of the Empress Livia Drusilla.

Her mother was named Lartia and was the daughter of Gnaeus Lartius.

Urgulanilla had three attested siblings:

* Marcus Plautius Silvanus, mentioned above. It is probable that he adopted Tiberius Plautius Silvanus Aelianus, who was consul in 45 AD and in 74 AD.
* Aulus Plautius Urgulanius, who died at the age of nine.
* Publius Plautius Pulcher, friend and companion of his nephew Claudius Drusus. Quaestor to Tiberius, and augur; governor of Sicilia. He was made a patrician by Claudius.

Through her family Urgulanilla was well-connected, but her marriage to Claudius was not a splendid match for a member of the imperial family; rather, it came about as consequence of the unfortunate fates of the other candidates. Claudius broke off his first engagement after Julia the Younger, the mother of his fiancÃ©e Aemilia Lepida, fell into disgrace, and his second fiancÃ©e Livia Medullina died on their wedding day.

Claudius and Urgulanilla were married circa 9 AD.

Urgulanilla had two attested children: 
* A son with Claudius, named Claudius Drusus, whose betrothal to a daughter of Sejanus instilled great expectations in the prefect, left unfulfilled when Drusus died in early childhood after he tossed a pear into his mouth and choked to death.
* A daughter, Claudia, who was born five months after her divorce from Claudius. Claudius claimed that she had been fathered by his freedman Boter and thus repudiated the child and he had her laid at Urgulanilla&#x27;s doorstep. She is sometimes confused with her younger half-sister Claudia Antonia

== Murder of Apronia ==
The murder in which Urgulanilla is supposed to have participated was that of her sister-in-law, Apronia, who was the second wife of Urgulanilla&#x27;s brother, Marcus Plautius Silvanus. However, none of the existing ancient writings makes clear how she was involved, and the details provided by Tacitus seem to imply she could not have been personally involved at all. Plautius Silvanus was first married to Fabia Numantina; however, at some time before 24 AD, they had divorced, and he had married Apronia, a daughter of Lucius Apronius. In 24 AD, Plautius Silvanus was accused of murdering Apronia &quot;for reasons not ascertained&quot; by throwing her out of a window in that year. Silvanus responded by claiming that he was asleep when the event had occurred, and was totally unaware of the circumstances leading to her death, saying that she had perhaps committed suicide. The murder was investigated by the Emperor Tiberius who, having investigated the couple&#x27;s bedroom, discovered proof of a scuffle, and therefore referred the case to the Senate for trial, thus implying that he believed Silvanus to be guilty. However, Silvanus&#x27; grandmother, Urgulania, sent him a dagger, encouraging him to commit suicide, which he duly did. Shortly after the murder of Apronia, Fabia Numantina was &quot;charged with having caused her husband&#x27;s insanity by magical incantations and potions&quot; but was acquitted.

==In fiction==
Urgulanilla appears as a significant character in &quot;I, Claudius&quot; by Robert Graves. She was played by Jennifer Croxton in the BBC TV adaptation.

<text>Strategic Air Command is a 1955 American military aviation war drama film starring James Stewart and June Allyson, directed by Anthony Mann, and released by Paramount Pictures. It was the first of four Hollywood films that depicted the role of the Strategic Air Command in the Cold War era.

&quot;Strategic Air Command&quot; was the second film released in Paramount&#x27;s new widescreen format, VistaVision, in color by Technicolor and Perspecta pseudo-stereo sound. It would also be Stewart and Mann&#x27;s eighth and final collaboration and the last of three films that paired Jimmy Stewart and June Allyson, the others being &quot;The Stratton Story&quot; and &quot;The Glenn Miller Story&quot;.
==Plot==
In 1951, Robert &quot;Dutch&quot; Holland is a professional baseball player with the St. Louis Cardinals. A B-29 bomber pilot during World War II, Holland retains a commission as a lieutenant colonel in the United States Air Force Reserve, but is on inactive, non-drilling status. During spring training at Al Lang Field in St. Petersburg, Florida, he is recalled to active duty for 21 months. He reports to his posting at Carswell Air Force Base, a bomber base in Fort Worth, Texas, to qualify in the Convair B-36. He arrives in a civilian business suit, for which he is rebuked by General Hawkes, the commander of SAC, and replies that his uniforms are &quot;the wrong color&quot; (implying he has been inactive at least since the Air Force replaced the brown United States Army Air Forces uniform with a distinctive blue service dress uniform, which had occurred three years earlier in 1949). The General&#x27;s character is clearly patterned after the real SAC commander of the time, General Curtis LeMay.

Holland is given a staff job with the bombardment wing at Carswell that involves a lot of flying. He soon has a B-36 crew of his own, selecting a former World War II colleague as his flight engineer, and becomes enamored with both flying and the role of SAC in deterring war. He is joined by his wife, Sally, who had not bargained on being an Air Force wife, and who struggles with his repeated absences and the dangers of flying. On any given night, Holland might find his aircraft on airborne alert far from the continental United States, in secret, only telling his wife when he returns days later. Even so, Sally tells Dutch that she is happy as long as they can be together, no matter what he decides to do with his life.

The B-36 is a complex aircraft when introduced, but improvements are under constant development. One challenge was leakage from the fuel tanks, but a new fix is introduced to permanently resolve the issue. On their next flight, Holland&#x27;s crew has to fly their B-36 from Carswell AFB to Thule Air Base, Greenland. The fix does not work and one of the engines bursts into flame, causing the entire left wing to catch fire. The crew is forced to abandon the aircraft and bail out over the ice and snow of Greenland before arriving at Thule while Holland and his radar navigator stay on board for a forced landing, which causes Holland to injure his right shoulder.

Holland becomes a favorite of General Hawkes, and he is rewarded with a revised assignment flying the new Boeing B-47 Stratojet at MacDill Air Force Base, Tampa, Florida, across the bay from St. Petersburg where his old baseball team continues to conduct its spring training. Promoted to &quot;full bird&quot; colonel and made deputy wing commander of his B-47 wing at MacDill AFB, Dutch decides, to Sally&#x27;s displeasure, to remain in the Air Force, rather than return to baseball at the end of his active duty obligation.

On a full B-47 wing deployment exercise that involves flying nonstop from MacDill to Yokota Air Base in Japan, the crew encounter severe wind and storms. Low on fuel, they divert to Kadena Air Base, Okinawa. As they prepare to land, Holland realizes that his shoulder injury from the B-36 crash was worse than he thought, and his arm is almost immobile. He is unable to operate the engine power levers (throttles) during final landing phase, and he has to rely on his co-pilot to do so, while Holland works the flight controls with his left arm and both feet.

This injury not only bars Holland from further flying and causes the Air Force to medically discharge him, but also appears to threaten his baseball career. General Hawkes suggests that he would make an excellent team manager.

==Production==

In real life, during World War II, Stewart had been a B-17 instructor pilot, a B-24 squadron commander, and a bomb group operations officer, completing 20 combat missions. At the time of filming, Stewart, much like the character he portrays, was also a colonel in the Air Force Reserve, serving with the Strategic Air Command when on duty and at the time was qualified as a pilot on the B-47, although much of the B-47 flying was performed by his friend and fellow Air Force pilot, Maj. (later Col.) A.W. Blizzard, Jr. Stewart&#x27;s military service and lifelong interest in aviation greatly influenced the making of the film. He pushed for an authentic but sympathetic portrayal of the Strategic Air Command, which led Paramount to put together a strong cast of Hollywood veterans and production people including June Allyson, Frank Lovejoy, director Anthony Mann, and the top stunt pilot of the day, Paul Mantz. The film accurately portrays (from the perspective of the 1951 starting point of the script) the duties and responsibilities of an Air Force strategic bomber pilot, and the demands such service places on family life.

Mann later said the film &quot;was to promote the Air Force and the idea of SAC which in 
itself had its own restrictions, just being a military subject. Therefore, the co-operation of the Air Force was vital, and we were held within the bounds of what they 
wanted. The story itself was restricted and the whole concept of its shooting was confined to what they would let me show, which is perfectly all right. I went into it 
purely as a service to the Air Force, and as Jimmy Stewart was of the Force, we accepted this handicap and just tried to make an exciting film, not out of the characters which were paper-mache, but out of the B-36 and B-47 - we tried to dramatic them as our two 
great characters.&quot;

The film includes dramatic aerial photography, credited to Thomas Tutwiler, for which it was awarded a special citation by the American National Board of Review. It is also the only motion picture to highlight the Convair B-36 (depicted in the theatrical release poster), the largest mass-produced piston-powered aircraft ever built, and the first bomber for the hydrogen bomb. The propeller-driven B-36 was then near the end of its service life and was about to be replaced by the jet-powered B-47 Stratojet, followed by the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress. The aerial footage was accompanied by a dramatic and soaring musical score composed by Victor Young.

The film was made with the full cooperation of the U.S. Air Force, and it was filmed partly on location at MacDill Air Force Base, Tampa, Florida; Lowry Air Force Base, Colorado, and Carswell Air Force Base, Texas.

The baseball scenes were filmed with the cooperation of the St. Louis Cardinals at their spring training home of Al Lang Field in St. Petersburg, Florida, just across Tampa Bay from MacDill AFB.

Stewart&#x27;s character is based on the real-life military career and an actual mission flown by Brigadier General Clifford Schoeffler, who crashed during an Arctic B-36 mission and survived. Brigadier General Schoeffler was on site at Carswell Air Force Base during the filming of &quot;Strategic Air Command&quot; as a consultant.

Some commentators have speculated that the plot was inspired by Boston Red Sox legend Ted Williams, a World War II veteran, who was recalled for Korean War service as a U.S. Marine Corps aviator, at the height of his baseball career.

==Reception==
The Storz Mansion in Omaha, Nebraska, was the scene of opulent parties celebrating the film. Its premiere was held in Omaha, the home of Offutt AFB and of SAC Headquarters. The premiere party was held at the Mansion, with guests that included Stewart and Allyson, as well as the Strategic Air Command commander, General Curtis LeMay.

Shot in the new VistaVision process, the film was the sixth highest-grossing film of 1955. Critics were lukewarm about the performances of all except for Stewart, who was called &quot;capable&quot;, &quot;charming&quot;, and &quot;competent&quot;. 
Public reaction centered on the spectacular aerial footage, so much so that the B-36 and B-47 aircraft were arguably the real stars of the film. Its release led to a 25 percent increase in Air Force enlistments.

&quot;Strategic Air Command&quot; was followed by two additional military aviation films that were also supportive of SAC&#x27;s mission, &quot;Bombers B-52&quot; (1957), and &quot;A Gathering of Eagles&quot; (1963).

The B-47 cockpit used in the film is now on display at the March Field Air Museum at March Air Reserve Base (former March AFB) in Riverside, California.

<doc id="67918" wikidata="Q3309852" url="?curid=67918" title="Genital modification and mutilation">
<text>Genital modifications are forms of body modifications applied to the human sexual organs, including invasive modifications performed through genital cutting or surgery. The term genital enhancement seem to be generally used for genital modifications that modify the external aspect, the way the patient wants it. The term genital mutilation is used for genital modifications that drastically diminish the recipient&#x27;s quality of life and result in adverse health outcomes, whether physical or mental.

== Reasons ==
=== Body modification ===
==== Voluntary ====

Many types of genital modification are performed at the behest of the individual, for personal, sexual, aesthetic or cultural reasons.

Social acceptance for male intimate cosmetic surgery seem to have happened around the 2010s, decades after other types of cosmetic surgeries.

Penile subincision, or splitting of the underside of the penis, is widespread in the traditional cultures of Indigenous Australians. This procedure has taken root in Western body modification culture, the modern primitives. Meatotomy is a form that involves splitting of the glans penis alone, while bisection is a more extreme form that splits the penis entirely in half.
Genital piercings and genital tattooing may be performed for aesthetic reasons, but piercings can have the benefit of increasing sexual pleasure for the pierced individual or their sex partners.

Similarly, pearling involves surgical insertion of small, inert spheres under the skin along the shaft of the penis for the purpose of providing sexual stimulation to the walls of the vagina. Similar to tattooing, genital scarification is primarily done for aesthetic reasons by adding decorative scars to the skin. The genital decoration by scars is an ancient tradition in many cultures, both for men and women.

Clitoris enlargement may be achieved temporarily through the use of a clitoral pump, or it may be achieved permanently through the application or injection of testosterone. Penis enlargement is a term for various techniques used to attempt to increase the size of the penis, though the safety and efficacy of these techniques are debated.

=====Gender-affirming surgery=====

People who are transgender may undergo gender-affirming surgery to alter their genitals to match their gender identity. Not all transgender people elect to have these surgeries.

Some of the surgical procedures are vaginoplasty (creation of a vagina) and vulvoplasty (creation of a vulva) for trans women and metoidioplasty (elongation of the clitoris), phalloplasty (creation of a penis), and scrotoplasty (creation of a scrotum) for trans men. Trans women may also benefit from hair removal and facial feminization surgery, while some trans men may have liposuction to remove fat deposits around their hips and thighs. Hijra, a third gender found in the Indian subcontinent, may opt to undergo castration. In some cases, a child&#x27;s gender may be reassigned due to genital injury, including David Reimer, who was the subject of John Money&#x27;s John/Joan case.

=====Nontherapeutic=====
The following types of unvoluntary genital cutting or surgery can be done on children, for nontherapeutic (medically unncessary) reasons: clitoral reduction surgeries on children with CAH, hypospadias surgeries, removal of internal gonads and penile circumcision. In some societies, other types of endosex girl genital cutting happen.
They can be done for psychosocial, cultural, subjective-aesthetic, or prophylactic perceived benefits, as judged by doctors or parents.

======Opposition======

====== Intersex ======

Intersex children and children with ambiguous genitalia may be subjected to surgeries to &quot;normalize&quot; the appearance of their genitalia.

These surgeries are usually performed for cosmetic benefit rather than for therapeutic reasons. Most surgeries involving children with ambiguous genitalia are sexually damaging and may render them infertile. For example, in cases involving male children with micropenis, doctors may recommend the child be reassigned as female. The Intersex Society of North America objects to elective surgeries performed on people without their informed consent on grounds that such surgeries subject patients to unnecessary harm and risk.

====As sexual violence====

Genital mutilation is common in some situations of war or armed conflict, with perpetrators using violence against the genitals of men, women, and non-binary people. These different forms of sexual violence can terrorize targeted individuals and communities, prevent individuals from reproducing, and cause tremendous pain and psychological anguish for victims.

===As treatment===
If the genitals become diseased, as in the case of cancer, sometimes the diseased areas are surgically removed. Females may undergo vaginectomy or vulvectomy (to the vagina and vulva, respectively), while males may undergo penectomy or orchiectomy (removal of the penis and testicles, respectively). Reconstructive surgery may be performed to restore what was lost, often with techniques similar to those used in gender-affirming surgery.

During childbirth, an episiotomy (cutting part of the tissue between the vagina and the anus) is sometimes performed to increase the amount of space through which the baby may emerge.

Hymenotomy is the surgical perforation of an imperforate hymen. It may be performed to allow menstruation to occur. An adult individual may opt for increasing the size of her hymenal opening, or removal of the hymen altogether, to facilitate sexual penetration of her vagina.

===Self-inflicted===

A person may engage in self-inflicted genital injury or mutilation such as castration, penectomy, or clitoridectomy. The motivation behind such actions vary widely; it may be done due personal crisis related to gender identity, mental illness, self-mutilation, body dysmorphia, or social reasons.

==Female==
===Female genital mutilation===
Female genital mutilation (FGM), also known as female genital cutting (FGC), female circumcision, or female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C), refers to &quot;all procedures involving partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other surgery of the female genital organs whether for cultural, religious or other non-therapeutic reasons.&quot; It is not the same as the procedures used in gender-affirming surgery or the genital modification of intersex persons.

It is practised in several parts of the world, but the practice is concentrated more heavily in Africa, parts of the Middle East, and some other parts of Asia. Over 125 million women and girls have experienced FGM in the 29 countries in which it is concentrated. Over eight million have been infibulated, a practice found largely in Djibouti, Eritrea, Somalia and Sudan. Infibulation, the most extreme form of FGM (known as Type III), consists of the removal of the inner and outer labia and closure of the vulva, while a small hole is left for the passage of urine and menstrual blood; afterwards the vagina will be opened after the wedding for sexual intercourse and childbirth (see episiotomy). In the past several decades, efforts have been made by global health organizations, such as the WHO, to end the practice. FGM is condemned by international human rights organizations. The Istanbul Convention prohibits FGM (Article 38).

FGM is considered a form of violence against women by the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women, which was adopted by the United Nations in 1993; it states: &quot;Article Two: Violence against women shall be understood to encompass, but not be limited to, the following: (a) Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family, including ... female genital mutilation ...&quot;. However, because of its importance in traditional life, it continues to be practised in many societies.

===Hymenorrhaphy===

Hymenorrhaphy refers to the practice of thickening the hymen, or, in some cases, implanting a capsule of red liquid within the newly created vaginal tissue. This new hymen is created to cause physical resistance, blood, or the appearance of blood, at the time that the individual&#x27;s new husband inserts his penis into her vagina. This is done in cultures where a high value is placed on female virginity at the time of marriage. In these cultures, a woman may be punished, perhaps violently, if the community leaders deem that she was not a virgin when her marriage was consummated. Individuals who are victims of rape, who were virginal at the time of their rape, may elect for hymenorrhaphy.

===Labia stretching===
Labia stretching is the act of elongating the &quot;labia minora&quot; through manual manipulation (pulling) or physical equipment (such as weights). It is a familial cultural practice in Rwanda, common in Sub-Saharan Africa, and a body modification practice elsewhere. It is performed for sexual enhancement of both partners, aesthetics, symmetry and gratification.

===Vulvoplasty and vaginoplasty===

Cosmetic surgery of female genitalia, known as &quot;elective genitoplasty&quot;, has become pejoratively known as &quot;designer vagina&quot;. In May 2007, an article published in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; strongly criticised this craze, citing its popularity being rooted in commercial and media influences. Similar concerns have been expressed in Australia.

Some women undergo vaginoplasty or vulvoplasty procedures to alter the shape of their vulvas to meet personal or societal aesthetic standards. The surgery itself is controversial, and critics refer to the procedures as &quot;designer vagina&quot;.

In the article Designer Vaginas by Simone Weil Davis, she talks about the modification of woman&#x27;s vagina and the outside influences women are pressured with, which can cause them to feel shame towards their labia minora. She states that the media, such as pornography, creates an unhealthy view of what a &quot;good looking vagina&quot; is and how women feel that their privates are inferior and are therefore pressured to act upon that mindset. These insecurities are forced upon women by their partners and other women as well. Also leading to a surge of these types of procedures is increased interest in non-surgical genital alterations, such as Brazilian waxing, that make the vulva more visible to judgment. The incentive to participate in vulvo- and vaginoplasty may also come about in an effort to manage women&#x27;s physical attributes and their sexual behavior, treating their vagina as something needing to be managed or controlled and ultimately deemed &quot;acceptable&quot;.

=== Clitoral enlargement methods ===
=== Clitoral hood reduction ===
Clitoral hood reduction is a form of hoodplasty. When performed with the consent of the adult individual, it can be considered an elective plastic surgery procedure for reducing the size and the area of the clitoral hood (prepuce) in order to further expose the glans of the clitoris; the therapeutic goal is thought to improve the sexual functioning of the woman, and the aesthetic appeal of her vulva. The reduction of the clitoral prepuce tissues usually is a sub-ordinate surgery within a labiaplasty procedure for reducing the labia minora; and occasionally within a vaginoplasty procedure. When these procedures are performed on individuals without their consent, they are considered a form of female genital mutilation.

==Male==
===Castration===

Castration in the genital modification and mutilation context is the removal of the testicles. Occasionally the term is also used to refer to penis removal, but that is less common. Castration has been performed in many cultures throughout history, but is now rare. It should not be confused with chemical castration.

The removal of one testicle (sometimes referred to as &quot;unilateral castration&quot;) is usually done in the modern world only for medical reasons.

===Circumcision===

Circumcision is the removal of the foreskin, the double-layered fold of skin, mucosal and muscular tissue at the distal end of the human penis. Around half of all circumcisions worldwide are performed for reasons of preventive healthcare; half for religious or cultural reasons. Circumcision involves either a conventional &quot;cut and stitch&quot; surgical procedure or use of a circumcision instrument or device. Complications are rare. Modern proponents say that circumcision reduces the risks of a range of infections and diseases and confers sexual benefits. Opponents, particularly of routine neonatal circumcision, question its preventive efficacy and object to subjecting non-consenting newborn males to a procedure that is potentially harmful, in their view, with little to no benefit, as well as violating their human rights and possibly negatively impacting their sex life. There is a consensus among the world&#x27;s major medical organizations and in the academic literature that circumcision is an efficacious intervention for HIV prevention in high-risk populations if carried out by medical professionals under safe conditions. They hold variant perspectives on the prophylactic efficacy of the elective circumcision of minors in developed nations.

===Foreskin restoration===
Foreskin restoration is the partial recreation of the foreskin after its removal by circumcision.

Surgical restoration involves grafting skin taken from the scrotum onto a portion of the penile shaft. Nonsurgical methods involve tissue expansion by stretching the penile skin forward over the glans penis with the aid of tension. Nonsurgical restoration is the preferred method as it is less costly and typically yields better results than surgical restoration. A foreskin restoration device may be of help to men pursuing nonsurgical foreskin restoration. While restoration cannot recreate the nerves or tissues lost to circumcision, it can recreate the appearance and some of the function of a natural foreskin.

===Infibulation===
&quot;Infibulation&quot; literally means &quot;to close with a clasp or a pin.â The word is used to include suturing of the foreskin over the head of the penis.

Early Greek infibulation consisted of tying the most distal portion of the foreskin with to conceal the glans. The kynodesme was also used by the Etruscans and Romans (ligatura praeputii), but the Romans preferred to apply a gold, silver, or bronze ring (&quot;annulus&quot;), a metal clasp (&quot;fibula&quot;) or pin.

In modern times, male infibulation may be performed for personal preferences or as part of BDSM.

===Emasculation===
Emasculation is the removal of both the penis and the testicles, the external male sex organs. It differs from castration, which is the removal of the testicles only, although the terms are sometimes used interchangeably.

Genital nullification is a procedure practiced in a body modification subculture made up mostly of men who have had their genitals surgically removed. Those undergoing the procedure often go by the name of nullos, and are not necessarily transgender or nonbinary; some identify as eunuchs. The term &quot;nullo&quot; is short for &quot;genital nullification&quot;. Though the procedure is mostly sought by men, female genital mutilation may be referred to as clitoral nullification.

In modern-day South Asia, some members of hijra communities reportedly undergo emasculation. It is called &quot;nirwaan&quot; and seen as a rite of passage.

It was part of the eunuch-making of the Chinese court, and it was widespread in the Arab slave trade. A castrated slave was worth more, and this offset the losses from death.

===Pearling===

Pearling or genital beading is a form of body modification, the practice of permanently inserting small beads made of various materials beneath the skin of the genitalsâof the labia, or of the shaft or foreskin of the penis. As well as being an aesthetic practice, this is usually intended to enhance the sexual pleasure of the receptive partner(s) during vaginal or anal intercourse.

===Penectomy===

Penectomy involves the partial or total amputation of the penis. Sometimes, the removal of the entire penis was done in conjunction with castration, or incorrectly referred to as castration. Removing the penis was often performed on eunuchs and high ranking men who would frequently be in contact with women, such as those belonging to a harem. The hijra of India may remove their penis as an expression of their gender identity. In the medical field, removal of the penis may be performed for reasons of gangrene or cancer.

In the ulwaluko circumcision ceremony, which is performed by spear, accidental penectomy is a serious risk.

Penis removal for purposes of assault or revenge is overwhelmingly a female-on-male crime, particularly in Thailand. In the United States In 1907 Bertha Boronda sliced off her husband&#x27;s penis with a straight razor. Lorena Bobbit infamously removed her husband&#x27;s penis in 1993. In the latter case, the use of microsurgery was able to reattach Bobbitt&#x27;s penis.

===Penis enlargement===
===Penis reduction===
===Penile subincision===

Penile subincision is a form of genital modification involves a urethrotomy and vertically slitting the underside of the penis from the meatus towards to the base. It was performed by people of some cultures, such as the Indigenous Australians, the Arrente, the Luritja, the Samburu, the Samoans, and the Native Hawaiians. It may also be performed for personal preference. Penile subincision may leave a man with an increased risk of sexually transmitted diseases, issues with fertility (due to lack of control over what direction the sperm goes after ejaculation), and may require a man to sit down while urinating. When the surgery is not performed in a hospital or by a licensed medical professional, complications such as infection, exsanguination, or permanent damage are major concerns.

=== Penile superincision ===

A rectal slit (also known as superincision) is an incision made along the upper length of the foreskin with the intention to expose the glans penis without removing skin or tissue.

The practice appears to have occurred in Ancient Egypt, though not commonly:
It may be performed as a part of traditional customs, such as those in the Pacific Islands and the Philippines. In the medical field, it may be performed for as an alternative to circumcision when circumcision is undesired or impractical. It remains a rare surgery and practice overall.

<text>Ketchup or catsup () is a table condiment with a sweet and sour flavor. &quot;Ketchup&quot; now typically refers to tomato ketchup, although early recipes for different varieties of ketchup contained mushrooms, oysters, mussels, egg whites, grapes, or walnuts, among other ingredients. 

Tomato ketchup is made from tomatoes, sugar, and vinegar, with seasonings and spices. The spices and flavors vary but commonly include onions, allspice, coriander, cloves, cumin, garlic, mustard and sometimes include celery, cinnamon, or ginger. The market leader in the United States (60% market share) and the United Kingdom (82%) is Heinz Tomato Ketchup. Tomato ketchup is often used as a condiment for dishes that are usually served hot and are fried or greasy: french fries and other potato dishes, hamburgers, hot dogs, chicken tenders, hot sandwiches, meat pies, cooked eggs, and grilled or fried meat. Ketchup is sometimes used as the basis for, or as one ingredient in, other sauces and dressings, and the flavor may be replicated as an additive flavoring for snacks, such as potato chips.

==History==

===Mushroom ketchup===
In the United Kingdom, ketchup was historically prepared with mushrooms as a primary ingredient, rather than tomatoes. In the United States, mushroom ketchup dates back to at least 1770, and was prepared by British colonists in the Thirteen Colonies.

===Tomato ketchup===
Many variations of ketchup were created, but the tomato-based version did not appear until around a century after other types. An early recipe for &quot;Tomato Catsup&quot; from 1817 includes anchovies:
# Gather a gallon of fine, red, and full ripe tomatas; mash them with one pound of salt. 
# Let them rest for three days, press off the juice, and to each quart add a quarter of a pound of anchovies, two ounces of shallots, and an ounce of ground black pepper.
# Boil up together for half an hour, strain through a sieve, and put to it the following spices; a quarter of an ounce of mace, the same of allspice and ginger, half an ounce of nutmeg, a drachm of coriander seed, and half a drachm of cochineal. 
# Pound all together; let them simmer gently for twenty minutes, and strain through a bag: when cold, bottle it, adding to each bottle a wineglass of brandy. It will keep for seven years.

By the mid-1850s, the anchovies had been dropped.

The term ketchup first appeared in 1682. Ketchup recipes began to appear in British and then American cookbooks in the 18th century. James Mease published the first known tomato ketchup recipe in 1812. In 1824, a ketchup recipe using tomatoes appeared in &quot;The Virginia Housewife&quot; (an influential 19th-century cookbook written by Mary Randolph, Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s cousin). Tomato ketchup was sold locally by farmers. Jonas Yerkes is credited as the first American to sell it in a bottle. By 1837, he had produced and distributed the condiment nationally. Shortly thereafter, other companies followed suit. F. &amp; J. Heinz launched their tomato ketchup in 1876. American cooks also began to sweeten ketchup in the 19th century. The &quot;Webster&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; of 1913 defined &quot;catsup&quot; as: &quot;table sauce made from mushrooms, tomatoes, walnuts, etc. [Also written as ketchup].&quot; As the century progressed, tomato ketchup began its ascent in popularity in the United States. Tomato ketchup was popular long before fresh tomatoes were. People were less hesitant to eat tomatoes as part of a highly processed product that had been cooked and infused with vinegar and spices. 

Heinz Tomato Ketchup was advertised: &quot;Blessed relief for Mother and the other women in the household!&quot;, a slogan which alluded to the lengthy process required to produce tomato ketchup in the home. With industrial ketchup production and a need for better preservation there was a great increase of sugar in ketchup, leading to the typically sweet and sour formula of today. In Australia, it was not until the late 19th century that sugar was added to &quot;tomato sauce&quot;, initially in small quantities, but today it contains just as much as American ketchup and only differed in the proportions of tomatoes, salt and vinegar in early recipes. While ketchup and tomato sauce are both sold in Australia, American ketchup is sweeter and thicker whereas Australian tomato sauce is more sour and runny.

Modern ketchup emerged in the early years of the 20th century, out of a debate over the use of sodium benzoate as a preservative in condiments. Harvey W. Wiley, the &quot;father&quot; of the US Food and Drug Administration, challenged the safety of benzoate which was banned in the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act.
In response, entrepreneurs including Henry J. Heinz, pursued an alternative recipe that eliminated the need for that preservative. Katherine Bitting, a bacteriologist working for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, carried out research in 1909 that proved increasing the sugar and vinegar content of the product would prevent spoilage without use of artificial preservatives. She was assisted by her husband, Arvil Bitting, an official at that agency.

Prior to Heinz (and his fellow innovators), commercial tomato ketchups of that time were watery and thin, in part because they used unripe tomatoes, which were low in pectin. They had less vinegar than modern ketchups; by pickling ripe tomatoes, the need for benzoate was eliminated without spoilage or degradation in flavor. But the changes driven by the desire to eliminate benzoate also produced changes that some experts (such as Andrew F. Smith) believe were key to the establishment of tomato ketchup as the dominant American condiment.

===Later innovations===

In fast food outlets, ketchup is often dispensed in small sachets or tubs. Diners tear the side or top of ketchup packets and squeeze ketchup out of them or peel the foil lid off tubs for dipping. In 2011, Heinz began offering a new measured-portion package, called the &quot;Dip and Squeeze&quot; packet, which can be opened in either way.

Some fast food outlets previously dispensed ketchup from hand-operated pumps into paper cups. This method has made a comeback in the first decades of the 21st century, as cost and environmental concerns over the increasing use of individual plastic ketchup tubs were taken into account. 

In October 2000, Heinz introduced colored ketchup products called EZ Squirt, which eventually included green (2000), purple (2001), mystery (pink, orange, or teal, 2002), and blue (2003). These products were made by adding food coloring to the traditional ketchup. By January 2006, these products were discontinued.

==Terminology==
The term used for the sauce varies. &quot;Ketchup&quot; is the dominant term in American English and Canadian English, although &quot;catsup&quot; is commonly used in some southern US states and Mexico.

In Canada and the US as well as some parts of the UK, &quot;tomato sauce&quot; is not a synonym for ketchup but is a sauce made from tomatoes and commonly used in making sauce for pasta.

==Etymology==

The etymology of the word &quot;ketchup&quot; is unclear; there are multiple competing theories:

===Amoy theory===
A popular folk etymology is that the word came from the Amoy (Xiamen) region of China into English, as a borrowed word (, Cantonese, meaning &quot;tomato sauce&quot;; the character means &#x27;eggplant&#x27;; &quot;tomato&quot; in Chinese is , so the phrase literally translates to &quot;foreign eggplant sauce&quot;). 

Another theory among academics is that the word derives from one of two words from Hokkien of the Fujian region of coastal southern China: (in the Amoy / Xiamen dialect and Quanzhou dialect) or (in the Zhangzhou dialect). Both of these pronunciations of the same word (, / ) come from the Quanzhou dialect, Amoy dialect, and Zhangzhou dialect of Hokkien, respectively, where it meant the brine of pickled fish or shellfish (, &#x27;pickled food&#x27; (usually seafood) + , &#x27;juice&#x27;). There are citations of in the &quot;Chinese-English Dictionary of the Vernacular or Spoken Language of Amoy&quot; (1873) by Carstairs Douglas, defined as &quot;brine of pickled fish or shell-fish.&quot;

===Malay theory===
&quot;Ketchup&quot; may have entered the English language from the Malay word (, sometimes spelled or ). Originally meaning &quot;soy sauce&quot;, the word itself derives from Chinese.

In Indonesian cuisine, which is similar to Malay, the term refers to fermented savory sauces. Two main types are well known in their cuisine: , which translates to &quot;salty &quot; in Indonesian (a salty soy sauce) and or &quot;sweet &quot; in Indonesian. is a sweet soy sauce that is a mixture of soy sauce with brown sugar, molasses, garlic, ginger, anise, coriander and a bay leaf reduced over medium heat until rather syrupy. A third type, , meaning &quot;fish &quot; is fish sauce similar to the Thai &quot;nam pla&quot; or the Philippine &quot;patis&quot;. It is not, however, soy-based.

===European-Arabic theory===
American anthropologist E.Â N. Anderson relies on Elizabeth David to claim that &quot;ketchup&quot; is a cognate of the French , meaning &quot;food in sauce&quot;. The word also exists in Spanish and Portuguese forms as &quot;escabeche&quot;, &quot;a sauce for pickling&quot;, which culinary historian Karen Hess traced back to Arabic , or &quot;pickling with vinegar&quot;. The term was anglicized to &quot;caveach&quot;, a word first attested in the late 17th century, at the same time as &quot;ketchup&quot;.

===Early uses in English===

The word entered the English language in Britain during the late 17th century, appearing in print as &quot;catchup&quot; (1690) and later as &quot;ketchup&quot; (1711). The following is a list of early quotations collected by the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;.

== Composition ==
U.S. Heinz tomato ketchup&#x27;s ingredients (listed from highest to lowest percentage weight) are: tomato concentrate from red ripe tomatoes, distilled vinegar, high-fructose corn syrup, corn syrup, salt, spice, onion powder, and natural flavoring.

===&quot;Fancy&quot; ketchup===
Some ketchup in the U.S. is labeled &quot;Fancy&quot;, a USDA grade related to specific gravity. Fancy ketchup has a higher tomato solid concentration than other USDA grades.
==Nutrition==
The following table compares the nutritional value of ketchup with raw ripe tomatoes and salsa, based on information from the USDA Food Nutrient Database.
==Viscosity==

Commercial tomato ketchup has an additive, usually xanthan gum, which gives the condiment a non-Newtonian, pseudoplastic or &quot;shear thinning&quot; propertyâmore commonly known as thixotropy. This increases the viscosity of the ketchup considerably with a relatively small amount addedâusually 0.5%âwhich can make it difficult to pour from a container. However, the shear thinning property of the gum ensures that when a force is applied to the ketchup, it will lower the viscosity, enabling the sauce to flow. A common method of getting ketchup out of the bottle involves inverting the bottle and shaking it or hitting the bottom with the heel of the hand, which causes the ketchup to flow rapidly. Ketchup in plastic bottles can be additionally manipulated by squeezing the bottle, which also decreases the viscosity of the ketchup inside. Another technique involves inverting the bottle and forcefully tapping its upper neck with two fingers (index and middle finger together). Specifically, with a Heinz ketchup glass bottle, one taps the 57 circle on the neck. This helps the ketchup flow by applying the correct shearing force. These techniques work because of how pseudoplastic fluids behave: their viscosity (resistance to flow) decreases with increasing shear rate. The faster the ketchup is sheared (by shaking or tapping the bottle), the more fluid it becomes. After the shear is removed, the ketchup thickens to its original viscosity.

Ketchup is a non-Newtonian fluid, meaning that its viscosity changes under stress and is not constant. It is a shear thinning fluid, which means its viscosity decreases with increased shear stress. The equation used to designate a non-Newtonian fluid is as follows: formula_1. This equation represents apparent viscosity where apparent viscosity is the shear stress divided by shear rate. Viscosity is dependent on stress. This is apparent when you shake a bottle of tomato sauce/ketchup so it becomes liquid enough to squirt out. Its viscosity decreases with stress.

The molecular composition of ketchup is what creates its pseudoplastic characteristics. Small polysaccharides, sugars, acids, and water make up the majority of the metastable ketchup product, and these small structures are able to move more easily throughout a matrix because of their low mass. While exposed to shear stress, the molecules within the suspension are able to respond quickly and create an alignment within the product. The bonds between the molecules are mostly hydrogen bonds, ionic interactions, and electrostatic interactions, all of which can be broken when subject to stress. Hydrogen bonds are constantly rearranging within a product due to their need to be in the lowest energy state, which further confirms that the bonds between the molecules will be easily disrupted. This alignment only lasts for as long as shear stress is applied. The molecules return to their original disorganized state once the shear stress dissipates.

In 2017, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology reported the development of a bottle coating that allowed all the product to slip out without leaving a residue.

In 2022, researchers at the University of Oxford found that splatter from a near-empty bottle can be prevented by squeezing more slowly and doubling the diameter of the nozzle.

== Separation ==
Ketchup is one of the many products that are leachable, meaning that the water within the product migrates together as the larger molecules within the product sediment, ultimately causing water to separate out. This forms a layer of water on top of the ketchup due to the molecular instability within the product. This instability is caused by interactions between hydrophobic molecules and charged molecules within the ketchup suspension.

Pectin is a polysaccharide within tomatoes that has the ability to bind to itself and to other molecules, especially water, around it. This enables it to create a gel-like matrix, dependent on the amount within the solution. Water is a large part of ketchup, due to it being 80% of the composition of distilled vinegar. In order for the water within the ketchup to be at the lowest possible energy state, all of the hydrogen bonds that are able to be made within the matrix must be made. The water bound to the polysaccharide moves more slowly within the matrix, which is unfavorable with respect to entropy. The increased order within the polysaccharide-water complex gives rise to a high-energy state, in which the water will want to be relieved. This concept implies that water will more favorably bind with itself because of the increased disorder between water molecules. This is partially the cause for water leaching out of solution when left undisturbed for a short period of time.

<text>East Sussex is a ceremonial county in South East England. It is bordered by Kent to the northeast, West Sussex to the west, Surrey to the northwest, and the English Channel to the south. The largest settlement is the city of Brighton and Hove, and the county town is Lewes. The county has an area of and a population of 822,947. The latter is largely concentrated along the coast, where the largest settlements are located: Brighton and Hove (277,105), Eastbourne (99,180), and Hastings (91,490). The centre and north of the county are largely rural, and the largest settlement is Crowborough (21,990). For local government purposes, East Sussex comprises a non-metropolitan county, with five districts, and the unitary authority of Brighton and Hove. East Sussex and West Sussex historically formed a single county, Sussex.

The northeast of East Sussex is part of the Weald, a sandstone anticline that was once an extensive woodland. The highest point in this area is Crowborough Hill (), part of the High Weald uplands. The south-west of the county is part of the South Downs, a rolling chalk escarpment that stretches west into West Sussex and Hampshire. Ditchling Beacon () is the highest point. Where the downs reach the sea, they form high cliffs such as the Seven Sisters, where eroded dry valleys create an undulating skyline. The county does not contain large rivers, but its largest are the Rother, which forms part of the boundary with Kent, the Cuckmere, and the Ouse, which rises in West Sussex and flows through Lewes before reaching the English Channel at Newhaven.

==History==
East Sussex is part of the historic county of Sussex, which has its roots in the ancient kingdom of the South Saxons, who established themselves there in the 5th century AD, after the departure of the Romans. Archaeological remains are plentiful, especially in the upland areas. The area&#x27;s position on the coast has also meant that there were many invaders, including the Romans and later the Normans, following the defeat of the English army by William the Conqueror at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Earlier industries included fishing, iron-making, and the wool trade, all of which have declined or been lost completely.

==Governance==

Sussex was historically sub-divided into six rapes. From the 12th century the three eastern rapes together and the three western rapes together had separate quarter sessions, with the county town of the three eastern rapes being Lewes. This situation was formalised by Parliament in 1865, and the two parts were made into administrative counties, each with its own elected county council in 1889 under the Local Government Act 1888. In East Sussex there were also three self-administered county boroughs: Brighton, Eastbourne and Hastings.

Upon its foundation, East Sussex included the south of Tunbridge Wells and the south of Lamberhurst; by the Local Government Act 1894 these areas were transferred to Kent.

In 1974 East Sussex was made a non-metropolitan and ceremonial county, and the three county boroughs became districts within the county. At the same time the western boundary was altered, so that the Mid Sussex region (including Burgess Hill and Haywards Heath) was transferred to the non metropolitan county of West Sussex. In 1997, Brighton and Hove became a self-administered unitary authority; it was granted city status in 2000, whilst remaining part of the ceremonial county of East Sussex.

The area of East Sussex County Council&#x27;s jurisdiction is divided into five local government districts. Three are large rural districts (from west to east): Lewes, Wealden, and Rother. Eastbourne and Hastings are mainly urban areas. The rural districts are further subdivided into civil parishes.

==Geography==

===Geology===

Geologically, East Sussex is part of southern anticline of the Weald: the South Downs, a range of moderate chalk hills which run across the southern part of the county from west to east and mirrored in Kent by the North Downs. To the north lie parallel valleys and ridges, the highest of which is the Weald itself (the Hastings beds and Wealden Clay). The sandstones and clays meet the sea at Hastings; the Downs, at Beachy Head. The area contains significant reserves of shale oil, totalling 4.4 billion barrels of oil in the Wealden basin according to a 2014 study, which then Business and Energy Minister Michael Fallon said &quot;will bring jobs and business opportunities&quot; and significantly help with UK energy self-sufficiency. Fracking in the area is required to achieve these objectives, which has been opposed by environmental groups.
===Climate===
East Sussex, like most counties by the south coast, has an annual average total of around 1,750 hours of sunshine per year. This is much higher than the UK&#x27;s average of about 1,340 hours of sunshine a year.

===Relief and drainage===
The relief of the county reflects the geology.

The chalk uplands of the South Downs occupies the coastal strip between Brighton and Eastbourne. There are two river gaps: the Rivers Ouse and Cuckmere. The Seven Sisters, where the Downs meet the sea, are the remnants of dry valleys cut into the chalk; they end at Beachy Head, 530Â feet (162Â m) above sea level. To the east of Beachy Head lie the marshlands of the Pevensey Levels, formerly flooded by the sea but now enclosed within a deposited beach. At Bexhill the land begins to rise again where the sands and clays of the Weald meet the sea; these culminate in the sandstone cliffs east of Hastings. Further east are the Pett Levels, more marshland, beyond which is the estuary of the River Rother. On the far side of the estuary are the dunes of Camber Sands. The highest point in the county is Ditchling Beacon on the South Downs, which has a maximum elevation of and is classed as a Marilyn.

The Weald occupies the northern borderlands of the county. Between the Downs and Weald is a narrow stretch of lower lying land; many of the rivers and streams occupying this area originate in the Weald. The High Weald is heavily wooded in contrast to the South Downs; the Low Weald less so. Part of the Weald is the Ashdown Forest.

===Settlements===

The location of settlements in East Sussex has been determined both by its history and its geography. The original towns and villages tended to be where its economy lay: fishing along the coast and agriculture and iron mining on the Weald. Industry today tends to be geared towards tourism, particularly along the coastal strip where towns such as Bexhill-on-Sea, Eastbourne, and Hastings are located. Newhaven and Rye are ports, although the latter is also of historical importance. Peacehaven and Seaford serve as dormitory towns. Away from the coast are former market towns such as Hailsham, Heathfield and Uckfield; Crowborough is a centre for the Ashdown Forest. Lewes, the County town of East Sussex; Battle, with its Norman Conquest beginnings, and Wadhurst are the other three towns of significance.

==Economy and demography==

This is a chart of trend of regional gross value added of the non-metropolitan county of East Sussex (Brighton &amp; Hove has a separate table) at current basic prices published (pp.Â 240â253) by &quot;Office for National Statistics&quot; with figures in millions of pounds.

===Economic activities===
Measured by the number of registered companies, East Sussex is not a major manufacturing or industrial area of the United Kingdom. Of the companies registered, the leading category in 2023 was &quot;construction&quot;, followed by &quot;real estate activities&quot;. An important contribution to the county&#x27;s economy comes from the fact that many residents of Brighton and Hove, Eastbourne and Hastings commute to London or work remotely for companies outside the county.

There were 1,720 agricultural holdings in East Sussex (excluding Brighton and Hove) in 2022, with a total farmed area of 108,825 hectares. They employed just over 4000 people and, in 2020, produced a gross value added of Â£66 million. Livestock grazing accounts for almost 40% of the farmed area, with there being approximately six times as many sheep as cattle. Fishing is limited but there are still fishing fleets, notably at Rye and Hastings, although the number of boats is much reduced. Historically, the fisheries were of great importance.

==Landmarks==
The Seven Sisters Park is part of the South Downs National Park. Beachy Head is one of the most famed local attractions, along with the flats along Normans Bay.

Apart from the physical landmarks such as the Downs and the Weald, East Sussex has a great many landmarks of historical interest. There are castles at Bodiam, Herstmonceux, Lewes and Pevensey; and defence works such as the Martello towers and Eastbourne Redoubt. Battle Abbey, built to commemorate the Battle of Hastings; Bateman&#x27;s, home of Rudyard Kipling; Hammerwood Park, one of the first examples of Greek Revival architecture in the UK; and the University of Sussex buildings at Falmer are among interesting buildings. Bexhill-on-Sea is also home to the De La Warr Pavilion. East Sussex also includes two chalk hill figures, being the Litlington White Horse and the Long Man of Wilmington, which are both situated in the Sussex Downs.
==Transport==

===Roads===
East Sussex has no motorways, and even dual carriageways are sparse in the county. The main roads through the county are those part of the radial pattern from London: the A21 from Kent to Hastings; the A22 from Surrey to Eastbourne; and the A23 from Gatwick to Brighton. Cross-country routes include the A26 which carries traffic from Newhaven and Lewes north into Kent; and the south coast trunk route, which starts in Folkestone (Kent) as the A259 trunk road, and traverses the south coast to Eastbourne, where it becomes the A27 trunk road and heads westwards towards Chichester in West Sussex and ultimately to Honiton in Devon. All the main roads suffer from congestion and traffic problems: the A27 which connects Eastbourne to Portsmouth is one of the busiest trunk roads in the UK.

Bus routes serve all the main areas of settlement and many of the villages in the county.

===Railways===
The railways serve the main towns in a similar fashion to the roads. Until the closures of many branch railways in the 20th century, rural East Sussex was well-served by rail: few such branch lines escaped the Beeching cuts so that today only main-line services remain. They include the East Coastway Line (including the Marshlink Line); the Hastings line; and the Uckfield branch of the Oxted Line. There are three heritage railways: the Kent and East Sussex Railway operates from Tenterden in Kent to Bodiam; the Bluebell Railway from Sheffield Park to East Grinstead; and the Lavender Line Steam Railway is a one-mile line at Isfield, near Uckfield.

Trains in the county are operated by Southern, Southeastern, Thameslink and Great Western Railway. Southern is the key operator for the county, operating services along the West Coastway and East Coastway routes, as well as trains from Brighton, Eastbourne, Seaford and Hastings to London Victoria, and to a lesser extent London Bridge, which is also where trains to/from Uckfield go. Southeastern operate trains from London Charing Cross to Hastings. Thameslink operate trains from Brighton to Bedford.

===Airports===
There are no airports offering scheduled flights in East Sussex. London&#x27;s second airport, Gatwick Airport, is a short distance from East Sussex and easily accessible by road and rail from most of the county. Despite its name, Brighton City Airport, the former Shoreham Airport, is in West Sussex. Three airports service small private planes, helicopters and flying schools: Spilsted Farm near Hastings; Kittyhawk Aerodrome near Lewes; and Deanland Airfield, also near Lewes.

===Ferries===
A ferry operates from Newhaven to Dieppe in France twice daily in the off-season and three times daily in the summer. Both vehicles and foot passengers are accepted.

===Footpaths===

Among the long-distance footpaths in East Sussex are the South Downs Way; 1066 Country Walk, High Weald Landscape Trail, Saxon Shore Way, Sussex Border Path, Sussex Ouse Valley Way, Vanguard Way, Wealdway and The Monarch&#x27;s Way.

==Education==
The Universities of Sussex and Brighton are based in East Sussex, with facilities in Brighton, Falmer and Hastings.

Over 150 primary schools serve the area; many of them small and local in scope.

State and independent secondary schools include Lewes Old Grammar School, which celebrated its 500th anniversary in 2012. Overall, more than 50 serve East Sussex, including further education colleges in larger towns.

A number of independent boarding schools that also cater to day students are located in the county, including Brighton College and Roedean. The Pestalozzi Children&#x27;s Village, an international foundation, is located at Sedlescombe.

==Culture==

East Sussex has many theatres and performance venues, including the Theatre Royal in Brighton and the Brighton Dome, the Attenborough Centre for the Creative Arts at the University of Sussex, the Royal Hippodrome Theatre and Devonshire Park Theatre in Eastbourne, and the White Rock Theatre in Hastings. The annual Glyndebourne Festival Opera takes place at Glyndebourne near Lewes. The Brighton Festival is a large multi-arts festival held every May.

There is a wide range of museums and art galleries in East Sussex. Notable amongst these are the Brighton Museum &amp; Art Gallery; the Hove Museum of Creativity; the Hastings Museum and Art Gallery; Hastings Contemporary; Charleston Farmhouse near Lewes, with an exhibition devoted to the artistic work of the Bloomsbury Group; the De La Warr Pavilion in Bexhill-on-Sea, which houses a contemporary art gallery; and the Towner Eastbourne gallery, which celebrated its centenary in 2023 and hosted the award ceremony for the Turner Prize on 5 December of that year.

==Tourism==

The coastal towns of Brighton and Hove, Bexhill-on-Sea, Hastings and Eastbourne attract many day trippers during the summer to visit the beaches. Brighton and Hove have a range of attractions including the Royal Pavilion. Beginning in 1787, it was built in three stages as a seaside retreat for George, Prince of Wales, who became King George IV in 1820. A more recent attraction is the Brighton i360, a 162 m observation tower on the seafront, which opened on 4 August 2016 to provide extensive views over Brighton and Hove, the South Downs and the English Channel. The tower has never achieved forecast visitor numbers and in June 2023 the company operating it owed Brighton and Hove Council Â£48 million.

Brighton Palace Pier, Eastbourne Pier and Hastings Pier serve as entertainment centres that attract many visitors. Several other piers built in the heyday of day tripper visits by train no longer exist, notably St Leonards Pier, in St Leonards-on-Sea, and the West Pier in Brighton, parts of which can still be seen in the sea opposite the Brighton i360. Originally, the profits from the i360 were seen as a potential source of funds to rebuild the West Pier, but that now seems unlikely.
Other important tourist attractions within East Sussex include Ashdown Forest, Drusillas Zoo Park near Alfriston and Michelham Priory. The county has two narrow-gauge railways, the Hastings Miniature Railway, which is powered by a steam locomotive, and Volk&#x27;s Electric Railway, which runs from Brighton&#x27;s Palace Pier to Brighton Marina along the seafront. Volk&#x27;s is the oldest operational electric railway in the world. There are also several castles that attract many visitors, as indicated in the Landmarks section above.

Annual events also promote tourism to the county. Brighton Pride is one of the UK&#x27;s largest and oldest pride parades and other pride events take place at Eastbourne and Hastings. The London to Brighton Veteran Car Run is the world&#x27;s longest-running motoring event. To qualify, cars must have been built before 1905. It is also the world&#x27;s largest gathering of veteran cars. The race finishes on Madeira Drive in Brighton.

For visitors who wish to explore East Sussex by car, there are many interesting and attractive towns and villages, such as Alfriston; Battle, site of the Battle of Hastings; Ditchling; Herstmonceux, with the castle of the same name; Lewes; Rottingdean; and Rye.

==Traditions==
The Lewes Bonfire is a set of bonfire celebrations held on Guy Fawkes Night, which both celebrates the uncovering of the Gunpowder Plot in 1605 and commemorates the memory of the seventeen Protestant martyrs from Mayfield burned at the stake between 1555 and 1557. It has a history of religious antagonism and anti-popery, including the burning of an effigy of the Pope. The event attracts tens of thousands of spectators every year. There are also many other bonfire societies in East Sussex.

==Sport==
===Football===

Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C. is the most successful club in East Sussex, playing in the Premier League in 2024â25 and also competing in the 2023â24 UEFA Europa League. It has appeared once in the FA Cup final, in 1983, losing to Manchester United after a replay. It is the only fully professional men&#x27;s team in the county. The oldest club in East Sussex is Eastbourne Town F.C., which was founded in 1881. Lewes F.C. is a semi-professional football club. The men&#x27;s first team is in the Isthmian League Premier Division. It also has a successful women&#x27;s team, which in 2023â24 was competing in the second-tier Women&#x27;s Championship against teams supported by much larger clubs, including some with their men&#x27;s team in the Premier League.

===Cricket===
Cricket had its origins in the counties of Kent, Surrey and Sussex. There is no team representing East Sussex. It combines with West Sussex as the Sussex County Cricket Club, playing first-team matches at the County Ground in Hove and reserve-team matches in both East and West Sussex. There are around 25 local clubs playing the game in East Sussex.

===Rugby===
There are around 15 rugby clubs in East Sussex, with many of them fielding several teams including women&#x27;s and girls&#x27; teams. Seaford Rugby Club claims the distinction of playing its home games below sea level.

===Cycling===
The fourth stage of the 1994 Tour de France ended in Brighton after departing from Dover. The route included a climb over Ditchling Beacon. The hilly nature of the Downs presents a good challenge for cyclists and there are at least eight cycling clubs in East Sussex.

===Golf===
There are 42 golf courses in East Sussex, many on downland. Four of these (2 in Brighton and Hove, one in Eastbourne and one in Crowborough) are public courses; the remainder private, semi-private or resorts.

===Other sports===
Other popular sports include sailing, bowls, stoolball, and tennis.

<doc id="67930" wikidata="Q246884" url="?curid=67930" title="Lewes">
<text>Lewes () is the county town of East Sussex, England. The town is the administrative centre of the wider district of the same name. It lies on the River Ouse at the point where the river cuts through the South Downs.

A traditional market town and centre of communications, in 1264 it was the site of the Battle of Lewes. The town&#x27;s landmarks include Lewes Castle, Lewes Priory, Bull House (the former home of Thomas Paine), Southover Grange and public gardens, and a 16th-century timber-framed Wealden hall house known as Anne of Cleves House. Other notable features of the area include the Glyndebourne festival, the Lewes Bonfire celebrations and the Lewes Pound.

==Etymology==
The place-name &quot;Lewes&quot; is first attested in an Anglo-Saxon charter circa 961 AD, where it appears as &quot;LÃ¦we&quot;. It appears as &quot;Lewes&quot; in the Domesday Book of 1086. The addition of the &lt;-s&gt; suffix seems to have been part of a broader trend of Anglo-Norman scribes pluralising Anglo-Saxon place-names (a famous example being their rendering of &quot;Lunden&quot; as &quot;Londres&quot;, hence the modern French name for London).

The traditional derivation of &quot;LÃ¦we&quot;, first posited by the Tudor antiquarian Laurence Nowell, derives it from the Old English word &quot;hlÃ¦w&quot;, meaning &quot;hill&quot; or &quot;barrow&quot;, presumably referring to School Hill (on which the historic centre of Lewes stands) or to one of the five ancient burial mounds, all now levelled, in the vicinity of St John sub Castro.

However, this etymology has been challenged by the Swedish philologist Rune Forsberg on the grounds that the loss of the initial in &quot;hlÃ¦w&quot; would be unlikely phonologically in this context. He suggested that the name &quot;LÃ¦we&quot; instead derives from the rare Old English word &quot;lÇ£w&quot; (&quot;wound, incision&quot;), and reflects the fact that from the top of School Hill Lewes overlooks the narrow, steep-sided &quot;gash&quot; where the River Ouse cuts through the line of the South Downs. This theory was endorsed in 2011 by &quot;A Dictionary of British Place Names&quot;.

A third possibility has been advanced by Richard Coates, who has argued that &quot;LÃ¦we&quot; derives from &quot;lexowia&quot;, an Old English word meaning &quot;hillside, slope&quot; (of which there is no shortage in the Lewes area). This unusual word was borrowed into Old English from Old Welsh, the Modern Welsh spelling being &quot;llechwedd&quot;.
==History==
===Pre-Saxon===
The immense strategic value of the site, which is able to command traffic between the Channel coast and the Sussex interior, was recognised as early as the Iron Age, when a hill-fort was built on Mount Caburn, the steep-sided hill that overlooks the Ouse (and the modern town of Lewes) from the east.

During the Roman period, there was an aristocratic villa at Beddingham, at the foot of Mount Caburn, and there have been several finds of Roman coins and pottery sherds in Lewes itself. The Victorian historian Thomas Walker Horsfield therefore reckoned that there must have been a Roman settlement on the site, and he identified it with the otherwise unlocatable town of &quot;Mutuantonis&quot;. Another antiquarian, John Elliot, even suggested that central Lewes&#x27;s distinctive network of twittens was based on the layout of a Roman legionary fortress; however modern historians are rather more cautious about the possibility of a Roman Lewes, as there is as yet no archaeological evidence for a built-up area dating back to the Roman period.

===Anglo-Saxon and Anglo-Norman===
The earliest phase of Anglo-Saxon settlement in Sussex was concentrated between the Rivers Ouse and Cuckmere, and Anglo-Saxon finds begin to appear in Lewes from the sixth century. The town of Lewes was probably founded around this time, and it may have been one of the most important settlements in the Kingdom of Sussex, along with Chichester and Hastings, though the evidence for this early period is very sketchy.
By the ninth century, the Kingdom of Sussex had been annexed to the Kingdom of Wessex, and in 838 Ecgberht, King of Wessex donated the estate of Malling, on the opposite side of the Ouse from Lewes, to the Archbishop of Canterbury. As a result, the Parish of Malling became a &#x27;peculiar&#x27;, which means that the parish was directly subject to the Archbishop of Canterbury rather than the Bishop of Chichester like every other parish in Sussex. Malling would retain this anomalous status until as late as 1845.

Information about Lewes becomes much more plentiful from the reign of Alfred the Great onward, as it was one of the towns which he fortified as part of the network of &quot;burhs&quot; he established in response to the Viking raids. The peace and stability brought by Alfred and his successors evidently stimulated economic activity in the area, for in the late Anglo-Saxon period Lewes seems to have been a thriving boom town â during the reign of Alfred&#x27;s grandson Ãthelstan it was assigned two royal moneyers, more than any other mint in Sussex, and according to Domesday Book it generated Â£26 of revenue for the Crown in 1065, almost twice the amount of any other town in the county, and comprised 127 households.

After the Norman Conquest, William the Conqueror rewarded his retainer William de Warenne by making him Earl of Surrey and granting him the Rape of Lewes, a strip of land stretching along the Ouse valley from the coast to the Surrey boundary. De Warenne constructed Lewes Castle within the walls of the Saxon &quot;burh&quot;, while his wife Gundreda founded the Priory of St Pancras, a Cluniac monastic house, in about 1081.

===Battle of Lewes===
During the Second Barons&#x27; War, King Henry III was ambushed at Lewes by a force of rebel barons led by Simon de Montfort. Henry marched out to fight de Montfort, leading to a pitched battle on the hills above the town (roughly in the area of modern Landport Bottom). The king&#x27;s son Prince Edward, commanding the right wing of the royal army, succeeded in driving off some of the baronial forces, but he got carried away with the pursuit, which took him as far as Offham. In Edward&#x27;s absence the remainder of the royal army was attacked by de Montfort and Gilbert de Clare and decisively defeated. The king&#x27;s brother Richard of Cornwall was captured, and the king himself was forced to sign the Mise of Lewes, a document which does not survive but was probably aimed at forcing Henry to uphold the Provisions of Oxford. Despite this uncertainty about its consequences, the battle is often seen as an important milestone in the development of English democracy.
===Late Mediaeval and Early Modern===
The de Warenne family died out with Earl John in 1347, whereupon lordship of the Rape of Lewes passed to his sororal nephew Richard Fitzalan, 4th Earl of Arundel. Fitzalan preferred to reside at Arundel Castle rather than at Lewes, and the town therefore lost the prestige and economic advantages associated with being the seat of an important magnate. This was only the beginning of a series of misfortunes that struck Lewes, for in 1348 the Black Death arrived in England and later on in the century the Hundred Years War led to a series of French and Castilian raids on Sussex, which badly disrupted trade. On one occasion in 1377 the Prior of St Pancras, John de Charlieu, was abducted by the raiders and held to ransom. Furthermore, after the main branch of the Fitzalan family died out in 1439, the Rape of Lewes was subsequently partitioned between the three sororal nephews of the last earl, namely John Mowbray, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, Edward Neville, 3rd Baron Bergavenny, and Edmund Lenthall. As a result of this dismemberment the district became even more neglected by its lords, although feudal politics was starting to become less important anyway due to the centralising reforms of the Yorkist and Tudor kings.

The English Reformation was begun by one of these Tudor monarchs, Henry VIII, and as part of this process the monasteries of England were dissolved; Lewes Priory was consequently demolished in 1538 and its property seized by the Crown. Henry&#x27;s daughter Mary I reversed the religious policy of England, and during the resulting Marian Persecutions of 1555â1557, Lewes was the site of the execution of seventeen Protestant martyrs, most of them actually from the Weald rather than Lewes itself, who were burned at the stake in front of the Star Inn (now the site of Lewes Town Hall). Commemoration of the martyrs is one of the main purposes of Lewes Bonfire, and a stone memorial to the martyrs was unveiled on Cliffe Hill in 1901.

Lewesian politics was dominated by a strongly Puritan faction in the reign of Charles I, and during the English Civil War it was one of the most important Parliamentarian strongholds in Sussex. As such it became the target of a royalist attack in December 1642, but the royalist army was intercepted and defeated at the Battle of Muster Green by Parliamentarian forces commanded by Herbert Morley, one of the two Members of Parliament (MPs) for Lewes.

Lewes recovered relatively quickly after the Civil War, and prospered during the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It had always been one of the principal market towns of Sussex, as well as an important port, and by the end of the Georgian era it also had well-developed textiles, iron, brewing, and shipbuilding industries.
===Modern===
The severe winter of 1836â7 led to a large build-up of snow on Cliffe Hill, whose sheer western face directly overlooks the town. On Tuesday 27 December 1836 this snow cornice collapsed, and the resulting Lewes avalanche was the deadliest ever recorded in Britain. The avalanche struck the cottages on Boulters Row (now part of South Street), burying fifteen people, of whom eight died. A pub in South Street is named &quot;The Snowdrop&quot; in memory of the event.

In 1846, the town became a railway junction, with lines constructed from the north, south and east to two railway stations. The development of Newhaven ended Lewes&#x27;s period as a major port. During the Crimean War, some 300 Finns who had served in the Russian army during the Ãland War and been captured at Bomarsund were imprisoned in the naval prison at Lewes. Lewes became a borough in 1881. Lewes Town Hall opened in 1893 in premises converted from the former Star Inn and in 1913 Council Offices were added in Arts-and-Crafts style.

Lewes Victoria Hospital opened in 1909 in its current premises, as Victoria Hospital and Infirmary, having previously been on School Hill where it opened as the Lewes Dispensary and Infirmary in 1855.

In October 2000, the town suffered major flooding during an intense period of severe weather throughout the United Kingdom. The commercial centre of the town and many residential areas were devastated. In a government report into the nationwide flooding, Lewes was officially noted the most severely affected location. As a result of the devastation, the Lewes Flood Action group formed, to press for better flood protection measures.

==Governance and politics==

===Local government===
There are three tiers of local government covering Lewes, at parish (town), district and county level: Lewes Town Council, Lewes District Council and East Sussex County Council. The town council is based at Lewes Town Hall on the High Street. The county council has its headquarters at County Hall on St Anne&#x27;s Crescent in the town, which is also used by Lewes District Council as its meeting place.

Lewes was an ancient borough, although the structure of its early government is obscure. For much of the Middle Ages the town was run by a closed aristocratic organisation known as the &quot;Fellowship of the Twelve&quot;, which was gradually eclipsed by a body known as the jury in the seventeenth century, presided over by a constable. The limitations of the town&#x27;s administration were recognised in 1806 when separate improvement commissioners were established to pave, light and repair the streets and provide a watch. When local government in towns was reformed across the country in the 1830s, Lewes was one of the boroughs left unreformed, and so it continued to be run by its jury and improvement commissioners. The situation was finally regularised in 1881 when the town was made a municipal borough. The town was then run by a corporate body formally called the &quot;mayor, aldermen and burgesses of the borough of Lewes&quot;, informally known as the corporation or town council. The last constable became the first mayor.

In 1890, the town council acquired the former Star Inn at 189 High Street, parts of which date back to the fourteenth century, and the adjoining corn exchange. The buildings were converted and extended to become the town hall, including a new frontage to High Street, which was completed in 1893. The municipal borough of Lewes was abolished in 1974 when the larger Lewes District was established. A successor parish was created covering the area of the former borough, with the parish council taking the name Lewes Town Council.

Following the 2023 election the composition of the town council was:
The next election is due in 2027.

Since 2010, the town has been included within the South Downs National Park. The National Park Authority has therefore taken over some functions from the local councils, notably relating to town planning.

There are also a number of local political groups without council representation. The far-left group Lewes Maoist Action has operated in the town since 2013, frequently handing out leaflets at the train station and running a cake stall at weekends outside Lewes Castle. In 2020, the group claims to have infiltrated the council and Harvey&#x27;s brewery, although they have never contested a local or parliamentary election.

===Constituency===
Lewes gives its name to the Lewes parliamentary constituency. The constituency was held by the Conservatives from the 1870s until 1997, when it was won by Liberal Democrat Norman Baker. He held the seat for 18 years until defeated in 2015 by Conservative Maria Caulfield, who retained her seat in the 2017 and 2019 general elections. As of July 2024, Liberal Democrat James MacCleary is the MP.

==Geography==

Lewes is situated on the Greenwich or Prime Meridian, in a gap in the South Downs, cut through by the River Ouse, and near its confluence with the Winterbourne Stream. It is approximately seven miles north of Newhaven, and an equal distance north-east of Brighton.

The South Downs rise above the river on both banks. The High Street, and earliest settlement, occupies the west bank, climbing steeply up from the bridge taking its ancient route along the ridge; the summit on that side, distant is known as Mount Harry. On the east bank there is a large chalk cliff, Cliffe Hill that can be seen for many miles, part of the group of hills including Mount Caburn, Malling Down (where there are a few houses in a wooded area on the hillside, in a development known as Cuilfail) and Golf Hill (home to the Lewes Golf Club). The two banks of the river are joined by Willey&#x27;s Bridge (a footbridge), the Phoenix Causeway (a recent concrete road bridge, named after the old Phoenix Ironworks) and Cliffe Bridge (an 18th-century replacement of the mediaeval crossing, widened in the 1930s and now semi-pedestrianised).

The High Street runs from Eastgate to West-Out, forming the spine of the ancient town. Cliffe Hill gives its name to the one-time village of Cliffe, now part of the town. The southern part of the town, Southover, came into being as a village adjacent to the Priory, south of the Winterbourne Stream. At the north of the town&#x27;s original wall boundary is the St John&#x27;s or Pells area, home to several 19th-century streets and the Pells Pond. The Pells Pool, built in 1860, is the oldest freshwater &quot;lido&quot; in England. The Phoenix Industrial Estate lies along the west bank of the river and contains a number of light industrial and creative industry uses, as well as car parks and a fire station. A potential regeneration project (formerly &quot;The North Street Quarter&quot;, renamed &quot;The Phoenix Project&quot; by the Lewes-based eco-development company Human Nature which took on ownership of the land in December 2020) for the area would be the largest in Lewes since the South Malling residential area was developed in the 1950s and 1960s and in the South Downs since it became a National Park.

Malling lies to the east of the river and had 18th- and 19th-century houses and two notable breweries. Road engineering and local planning policy in the 1970s cleared many older buildings here to allow the flow of traffic; the main road route east from the town now goes along Little East Street, across the Phoenix Bridge and through the Cuilfail Tunnel to join the A27.

The town boundaries were enlarged twice (from the original town walls), in 1881 and 1934. They now include the more modern housing estates of Wallands, South Malling (the west part of which is a previously separate village with a church dedicated to St Michael), Nevill, Lansdown and Cranedown on the Kingston Road.

Countryside walks can be taken starting from several points in Lewes. One can walk on Mount Caburn to the village of Glynde starting in Cliffe, traverse the Lewes Brooks (an RSPB reserve) from Southover, walk to Kingston near Lewes also from Southover, head up Landport Bottom to Mount Harry and Black Cap along the edge of the old Lewes Racecourse, or wander up along the Ouse to Hamsey Place from the Pells. The South Downs Way crosses the Ouse just south of Lewes at Southease and hikers often stop off at the town. A new route reaching the town at the Railway Land â the Egrets Way â initially conceived in 2011 by the Ouse Valley Cycle Network, has been designed as a network of walking and cycling paths linking Lewes and Newhaven with the villages in between.

===Natural sites===

Three Sites of Special Scientific Interest lie within the parish: Lewes Downs, Lewes Brooks and Southerham Works Pit. Lewes Downs is a site of biological interest, an isolated area of the South Downs. Lewes Brooks, also of biological importance, is part of the floodplain of the River Ouse, providing a habitat for many invertebrates such as water beetles and snails. Southerham Works Pit is of geological interest, a disused chalk pit displaying a wide variety of fossilised fish remains. The Railway Land nature reserve is on the east side of the town next to the Ouse, and contains an area of woodland and marshes, which now includes the Heart of Reeds, a sculpted reed bed designed by local land artist Chris Drury. The Winterbourne stream, a tributary of the Ouse, flows through it. This stream flows most winters and dries up in the summer, hence its name. It continues through Lewes going through the Grange Gardens and often travelling underground. The Heart of Reeds is one of the sites in East Sussex and Kent home to the marsh frog, an introduced species. It is popular with pond-dippers and walkers. A centre for the study of environmental change is due to be built at the entrance to the nature reserve.

On 21 August 1864, Lewes experienced an earthquake measuring 3.1 on the Richter magnitude scale.
===Climate===
Climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round. The KÃ¶ppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is &quot;Cfb&quot; (Marine West Coast Climate/Oceanic climate).
==Religious buildings==
===Church of England===
* St Michael&#x27;s is located at the top of the High Street and like St Peter&#x27;s in nearby Southease it has a round tower (with a shingled spire). Its length runs along the street rather than away from it and the cemetery is separated from the High Street by stone walls with iron railings on top. Next to it is a building which is used upstairs as a Sunday school.
* Further west is St Anne&#x27;s, a quiet church surrounded by its graveyard, which gives its name to the street it is on.
* St John sub Castro (Latin for St John-under-the-Castle) is the northernmost church in the old town. The surrounding town quarter is called St John&#x27;s. The church&#x27;s boundaries are actually protected on one side by the Town Walls, although originally St John&#x27;s was a small Saxon building. It was destroyed in the 19th century but the main door was kept and used as an east door for the large new church, built in 1839 by George Cheeseman in flint and brick. In the graveyard there is a memorial to the Finnish prisoners kept in the old naval prison in the 19th century. St John&#x27;s Church Hall is a couple of streets away in Talbot Terrace.
* In Cliffe there is St Thomas Ã  Becket&#x27;s, where the Orthodox Community also worship.
* In Southover, St John the Baptist&#x27;s is located on Southover High Street. The nave incorporates the hospitium of the Priory of St Pancras. Neighbouring it is Church End and down the road at St James Street cul-de-sac, the Church Hall. In its grounds is the Southover War Memorial, which is distinct from the main Lewes War Memorial.
* St. Michael, South Malling, dates from 1628.

====Deconsecrated====
* All Saints&#x27; is next to the site of a Priory of Grey Friars (Franciscan friars) the only relic of which is an archway at the end of the church boundary wall, which is on the line of the town wall. The medieval tower survives, abutting a later brick nave by Amon Wilds (1806) and 19th-century Gothic-style chancel. This church is now deconsecrated and serves as a community arts space, managed by the Town Council.

===Roman Catholic===
The Roman Catholic church is dedicated to St. Pancras in memory of the Priory and is a red-brick building over the street from St Anne&#x27;s.

=== Non-conformist ===
* Lewes Friends Meeting House (finished 1784) is a Quaker meeting house next to the former All Saints&#x27; Church (now an arts centre) on Friar&#x27;s Walk.
* The Jireh Chapel, off Malling Street, is a Grade I listed building, being a rare survivor of its type dating from 1805. It now houses the Lewes Free Presbyterian Church.
* Westgate Chapel is a 16th-century building located built on the original 13th century town wall foundations and a yard at the top of the High Street (Grade 2* listed). So called because of its position at the old West Gate of the town wall, the Chapel was in use during the 17th century and became a licensed place of worship named as Westgate Meeting on 5 November 1700 and recorded as Independent. Its liberal stance allowed it to become a Unitarian led church by 1820 (when the congregation of Southover General Baptist Chapel re-joined) It is now an Independent chapel.
* Eastgate Chapel is a very different building; a neo-Norman design of 1843 in dark flint, it originally had a pepper-pot dome but this was removed in favour of a traditional spire in case traffic vibrations below made it fall off. A modern extension has been added to the church.
* Christ Church, a modern (1953) building, serves a united congregation of United Reformed Church and Methodist worshippers.
* Southover General Baptist Chapel was built in Eastport Lane in 1741. The congregation&#x27;s views moved towards Unitarianism, and in the 19th century they re-joined Westgate Chapel having earlier split from there. The building has been a house since 1972, but had various religious and secular uses before that.

==Demography==

In 2001 the service industries were by far the biggest employers in Lewes: over 60% of the population working in that sector. A little over 10% are employed in manufacturing, mostly in the smaller industrial units.

The town is a net daytime exporter of employees with a significant community working in London and Brighton whilst it draws in employees of the numerous local government and public service functions on which its local economy is strongly dependent.

An important part of the town&#x27;s economy is based on tourism, because of the town&#x27;s many historic attractions and its location.

As referenced in the governance section, the town is also where three tiers of local government have their headquarters, and the head office of Sussex Police is also in Lewes.

==Lewes Bonfire==

The town&#x27;s most important annual event is the Lewes Bonfire celebrations on 5 November, Guy Fawkes Night. In Lewes this event not only marks the date of the uncovering of the Gunpowder Plot in 1605, but also commemorates the memory of the seventeen Lewes Martyrs, Protestants burnt at the stake for their faith during the Marian Persecutions. The celebrations, which controversially involve burning an effigy of Pope Paul V, who was pope during the Gunpowder Plot, are the largest and most famous Bonfire Night celebrations in the country.

==Economy==

The Lewes Chamber of Commerce represents the traders and businesses of the town. The town has been identified as unusually diversified with numerous specialist, independent retailers, counter to national trends toward &#x27;chain&#x27; retailers and large corporate retail outlets.

Lewes Farmers&#x27; Market, one of the first in the UK, was started in the 1990s by Common Cause Co-operative Ltd and is a popular re-invention of Lewes as a market town. The Farmers&#x27; Market takes place in pedestrianised Cliffe High Street on the first and third Saturdays of every month, with local food producers coming to sell their wares under covered market stalls. A weekly food market in the Lewes Market Tower was established in July 2010 by Transition Town Lewes to allow traders to sell local produce. Occasionally French traders from the twin town of Blois attend, vending on Cliffe Bridge.

From 1794 beers, wines and spirits were distributed from Lewes under the &quot;Harveys&quot; name, and the town is today the site of Harvey &amp; Son&#x27;s brewery celebrated as one of the finest ale producers in England.

In September 2008, Lewes launched its own currency, the Lewes Pound, in an effort to increase trade within the town. One Lewes Pound is equal to Â£1. Like the similar local currency in Totnes, the initiative is part of the Transition Towns movement. The Lewes Pound and the Transition Towns movement have received criticism for a failure to address the needs of the wider Lewes population, especially lower socio-economic groups. Such local currency initiatives have been more widely criticised in light of limited success stimulating new spending in local economies and as an unrealistic strategy to reduce carbon emissions. The Lewes Pound can be exchanged for the same amount of pounds sterling in several shops in Lewes and can be spent in a wide range of local businesses. Many of the notes were sold on eBay at a higher amount. Early numbers and sequenced notes fetched very high prices from foreign collectors.

==Landmarks==
The town is the location of several significant historic buildings, including Lewes Castle, the remains of Lewes Priory, Bull House (the former home of Thomas Paine), Southover Grange and public gardens, and a 16th-century timber-framed Wealden hall house known as Anne of Cleves House because it was given to her as part of her divorce settlement from Henry VIII, though she never lived there. Anne of Cleves House and the castle are owned and maintained by the Sussex Archaeological Society (whose headquarters are in Lewes). The Round House, a secluded former windmill in Pipe Passage, was owned by the writer Virginia Woolf.

The steep and cobbled Keere Street is home to many historic buildings, including a timber framed antiquarian bookshop. The gardens of the buildings on the east side of the street border the old Town Walls. The Prince Regent once drove his carriage down the street, and a sign at the bottom commemorates this event.
The ancient street pattern survives extensively as do a high proportion of the medieval building plots and oak framed houses, albeit often masked with later facades. The 18th-century frontages are notable and include several, like Bartholomew House at the Castle Gate, that are clad in mathematical tiles which mimic fine brick construction. Numerous streets of 18th- and 19th-century cottages have survived cycles of slum clearance as models of attractive town housing.

At the highest point of the old town the Portland stone and Coade stone facade of the Crown Court (1808â12, by John Johnson), the brick Market Tower and florid Lewes War Memorial mark the historic centre, although trade has tended to concentrate on the lower land in modern times. At the lowest part of the town, by the river, Harvey &amp; Son&#x27;s Brewery, &#x27;The Cathedral of Lewes&#x27; is an unspoilt 19th-century tower brewery and is the only one of the town&#x27;s five original major breweries still in use. Nearby Fitzroy House is a George Gilbert Scott designed building, constructed as a library in memory of Lewes MP Henry FitzRoy in 1862 and now a private residence. The railway station is the other important monument of the industrial era.
Southover Grange is a grade II*listed Tudor manor house built in 1572 with Caen limestone taken from the ruins of Lewes Priory. The house and its gardens were bought by Lewes District Council and opened to the public in 1945. The house is now owned by East Sussex County Council, and it is currently being refurbished into a wedding venue, registry office and community facility. The east wing is leased to an art shop and the Window cafÃ© (open in spring and summer). The Grange gardens are divided by the Winterbourne stream and contain formal bedding displays, a wildflower area, a knot garden and some notable trees, including a large Magnolia grandiflora, a mulberry tree dating perhaps to the 17th century and a tulip tree planted by Queen Elizabeth II. The gardens are open to the public during daylight hours all year round.
Pelham House dates back to the 16th century and features architecture of all subsequent eras and a private landscaped garden facing the Downs. It now serves as an independent hotel. The Shelleys, also now a hotel, is likewise of some antiquity with a private garden and family associations with Percy Shelley.

The centre of Lewes is notable for a consistently high calibre of regional vernacular architecture and variety of historic construction materials and techniques. A comprehensive survey of all historical plaques was conducted in 2013 by a local civic society, the Friends of Lewes.

A distinctive feature of the centre of Lewes is the network of alleyways or &#x27;twittens&#x27; which run northâsouth on either side of the High Street and date back to Anglo-Saxon times. According to the Dictionary of the Sussex dialect and collection of provincialisms in use in the county of Sussex published in Lewes in 1875. &quot;Twitten is a narrow path between two walls or hedges, especially on hills. For example, small passageways leading between two buildings to courtyards, streets, or open areas behind&quot;. Some twittens (e.g. Broomans Lane, Church Twitten, Green Lane, Paine&#x27;s Twitten) remain flint-wall-lined pedestrian thoroughfares, others (e.g. Watergate Lane, St Andrew&#x27;s Lane and renamed Station Street (formerly St Mary&#x27;s Lane)) are now narrow usually one-way roads. The most notable of all Lewes&#x27; twittens is Keere Street. A weekly Sunday morning run up and down all the twittens on the south side of the High Street â the so-called Twitten Run â has operated in the town since November 2015.

==Public sculpture==

===Historic===

With Eric Gill&#x27;s move to Ditchling, the artistic community there gave rise to other sculptors in the Lewes district such as his nephew John Skelton and Joseph Cribb. Skelton&#x27;s studio in Streat has continued as an educational and artist&#x27;s workshop since his death in 1999. Eric Gill and Jacob Epstein conceived &quot;a great scheme for doing some colossal figures together&quot; around 1910 for a modern Stonehenge on 6 acres of land at Asheham House, Beddingham, south-east of Lewes. William Rothenstein agreed to buy the lease but the scheme failed.

Edward Perry Warren first saw Lewes House in 1889 and with his partner John Marshall they were prodigious collectors of fine antique sculpture there. Eric Gill was introduced to Warren by Roger Fry and the stone carving Ecstasy purchased, which is now in the Tate Gallery collection. William Rothenstein suggested that Warren might like to acquire Rodin&#x27;s new sculpture &quot;The Kiss&quot; and after several visits, in 1904 the Lewes &quot;Kiss&quot; arrived at Lewes House. In 1906 Rodin requested that Warren lend &quot;The Kiss&quot; to an important exhibition in Regent Street, London. This made it famous in Britain for the first time. &quot;The Kiss&quot; was returned to the stables at Lewes House, where it remained until 1914 until offered to Lewes Town Council. It was placed in the Town Hall, at the South End of the Assembly Room on 2 December 1914. Early in 1915, &quot;The Kiss&quot; was wrapped in canvas and marked off with a guard rail. The Town Council returned the statue, saying only that the room did &#x27;not lend itself to such a noble piece of statuary.&#x27; On 26 February 1917, &quot;The Kiss&quot; was once more taken to the stable block where it was to remain until Warren&#x27;s death in 1928. After a short period on loan to Cheltenham, &quot;The Kiss&quot; was purchased in 1953 by public subscription and is now one of the Tate&#x27;s most popular attractions.

It returned on loan to Lewes in 1999 for the exhibition &quot;Rodin in Lewes&quot;.

===Present day===
&quot;The Helmet&quot; (1964), by Enzo Plazzotta, stands in the grounds of Lewes Priory. The &quot;Cuilfail Spiral&quot; (1983) by Peter Randall-Page sits on the roundabout at the north end of the Cuilfail Tunnel; made of 7 pieces of Portland limestone. The &quot;Magnus Inscription&quot; (c. 1200) sits in the East wall of St John Sub Castro on the Junction of Abinger Place and Lancaster Street. The &quot;Janus Head&quot; (1997) by John Skelton and &quot;Lewes Group&quot; (2010) by Jon Edgar sit in Southover Grange Gardens. &quot;Sculpture to Thomas Paine&quot; by Marcus Cornish commissioned as a private donation was unveiled in July 2010 outside the new Lewes Library in Styles Field.

==Transport==
Lewes, from its inception, has been an important transport hub. Its site as a bridging point was probably originally a ford: today the main routes avoid the town centre. The A27 trunk road taking traffic along the south coast between Eastbourne and Southampton passes to the south of the town. The A26 from Maidstone to Newhaven; and the A275 (the London road) both come in from the north. The Brighton &amp; Hove bus company and Compass Travel serve the town. The bus station was closed for a while but reopened in late 2008.

Lewes railway station was originally the junction for six routes. The town still enjoys hourly fast trains from London. The two erstwhile rural rail routes to the north, linking to East Grinstead and Uckfield respectively, are both now closed, but the East Coastway Line, connecting Brighton with Eastbourne and Hastings, and the branch to Seaford remain.

The Vanguard Way, a long-distance footpath from London to Newhaven, passes through countryside east of the town. The South Downs Way also passes close to Lewes, crossing the Ouse at Southease, some four miles south of the town. The Greenwich Meridian Trail, a long-distance path that follows the Greenwich Meridian from Peacehaven in East Sussex to Sand le Mere in East Yorkshire passes through the middle of the town. A festival celebrating and encouraging walking and cycling, the Lewes Hike and Bike Festival, was created in 2012 but only ran for three years. The Eastbourne and Lewes Walking Festival was created in 2018 to promote walking in the local urban and rural South Downs area.

==Lewes in literature==

With a number of authors having lived in or near Lewes, it features, explicitly or disguised, in a number of books.

Possibly the earliest substantial reference in fiction is in &quot;The Wanderer: Or, Female Difficulties&quot;, an 1814 novel by Fanny Burney, in which the heroine spends time in Lewes and Brighton.

Eve Garnett lived in Lewes and her &quot;The Family from One End Street&quot; series of children&#x27;s stories are set in &#x27;Otwell-on-the-Ouse&#x27;. Matthew de Abaitua&#x27;s dystopian novel &quot;If Then&quot; is set in a fictionalised Lewes. There are strong parallels with Lewes in the setting of Cliffe House which appears in a story called &quot;Bloody Baudelaire&quot;, by R. B. Russell.

&quot;The Collector&quot; by John Fowles is set near Lewes with the characters visiting the town, and the Roy Grace crime series by Peter James (writer) based in Brighton has scenes set in Sussex Police HQ based in Lewes. Graham Greene&#x27;s first novel &quot;The Man Within&quot; has scenes set in Lewes at the Lewes assizes.

Three novels by William Nicholson (writer) â &quot;The Secret Intensity of Everyday Life&quot;, &quot;All the Hopeful Lovers&quot; and &quot;Golden Hour&quot; â are based in Lewes and surrounding villages. &quot;Three Round Towers&quot; and &quot;Retribution&quot; by Beverley Elphick are set in and around Lewes at the end of the 18th century.

Other writers to have set works of fiction in Lewes include Andrew Soutar, Judith Glover, and primatologist Alison Jolly who wrote a series of books for children.

The personal diaries of Lewes-based writer Alice Dudeney who wrote popular fiction in the first half of the 20th century were published in 1998 as &quot;A Lewes Diary: 1916â1944&quot; describing her life in Lewes with Henry Dudeney before and during the interwar years.

Lewes also features in a range of works of other non-fiction, but notable examples would include &quot;To The River&quot; by Olivia Laing which follows her walk along the River Ouse and &quot;The Old Ways&quot; by Robert Macfarlane (writer) features walks on the South Downs close to Lewes.

In 2015, American writer Joseph Cannizzo Jr. published a collection of poetry about Lewes entitled &quot;When in Lewes&quot;, () following a brief stay in the town.

==Media==
The &quot;Sussex Express&quot; newspaper (formally the &quot;Sussex Express and County Herald&quot;) was established in 1837 in Lewes as the &quot;Sussex Agricultural Express&quot; and merged with the Sussex County Herald in 1938. Now headquartered in Horsham, it serves Lewes and much of East Sussex. It has four editions and includes extensive coverage of the local sports scene.

Between April and September members play on a flat lawn green with six rinks and inside the clubhouse on short mat for the winter season. Lewes Golf Club is set on downland above Cliffe Hill on the east-side of Lewes, where the sport has been played since 1896.

The town is also home to Lewes Bridge View which has adult teams competing in the Mid Sussex Football League and Lewes and District Sunday League. In 2016 Lewes Bridge View Juniors joined in partnership with Lewes FC to form Lewes FC Juniors â running Under 8s to Under 16s, with boys and girls teams.

Lewes Racecourse, located immediately to the west of the town on the slopes of the Downs, operated for 200 years until it closed in 1964. Racehorse training continued at Lewes until 2020 when the area&#x27;s last trainer, Suzy Smith, moved her base from Lewes to Angmering. Race days are held at nearby Plumpton Racecourse.

There are a number of Service Clubs in Lewes, including Lewes Lions Club which is a member of Lions Clubs International.

Since the 1960s, the Lewes Rotary Club has hosted its distinctive annual skittles tournament in the gardens of Southover Grange in June each year.

==Notable people==

Among the many notable former residents of Lewes is Thomas Paine (1737â1809), who was employed as an excise officer in the town for a time from 1768 to 1774 when he emigrated to the American colonies. The Paine association sits at the centre of a radical tradition that is represented today by writers working in the town.

The sciences and natural enquiry are represented by Gideon Mantell who is credited with the first discovery and identification of fossilised dinosaur (iguanodon) teeth. Lewes doctor Richard Russell popularised the resort of Brighton. Thomas Frewen, who practised in Lewes, was one of the earliest doctors to adopt the practice of inoculation against smallpox.

Lewes is the birthplace of 16th-century madrigalist Nicholas Yonge. In the 1960s it was home to Charlie Watts of the Rolling Stones, as it is now to other musicians, including Herbie Flowers, Arthur Brown and Tim Rice-Oxley from Keane.

Daisy Ashford lived from 1889 to 1896 at Southdown House, 44 St Anne&#x27;s Crescent, where she wrote &quot;The Young Visiters&quot;. Edward Perry Warren, an eccentric American collector, lived in Lewes House. In 1919 Virginia Woolf briefly owned â but never lived in â the Round House, a windmill in Pipe Passage, before moving to her final home, Monk&#x27;s House in Rodmell. Diarist John Evelyn spent his boyhood at Southover Grange.

John Maynard Smith (1920â2004), evolutionary biologist and population geneticist, died in Lewes.

==Crime==
The town is the police and judicial centre for all of Sussex and is home to Sussex Police, East Sussex Fire &amp; Rescue Service, Lewes Crown Court and HMP Lewes.

The fact that Lewes has a Crown Court, and a prison, is reflected by the fact that many notorious people have been connected with the town. During the 1916 Easter Rising in Ireland several prominent figures involved in it were in Lewes Prison, including Ãamon de Valera (1882â1975); Thomas Ashe (1885â1917); Frank Lawless (1871â1922); and Harry Boland (1887â1922). Others have included George Witton (1874â1942) involved in shooting prisoners during the Boer War.

Lewes assizes saw many important trials. In 1949 serial killer John George Haigh was sentenced to death. In 1956 suspected serial killer John Bodkin Adams had his committal hearing in Lewes before being sent to the Old Bailey, London for trial. He was subsequently tried and convicted in Lewes in 1957 for fraud, lying on cremation forms and obstructing a police search. An early case was that of Percy Lefroy Mapleton (1860â1881) hanged for murder and the subject of the first composite picture on a wanted poster.
==Twin towns==
* Waldshut-Tiengen, Germany
* Blois, France
Lewes has been twinned with Waldshut-Tiengen since 1974 and with Blois since 1963, although informal links between these two towns began in 1947.

<text>CassiniâHuygens ( ), commonly called Cassini, was a space-research mission by NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Italian Space Agency (ASI) to send a space probe to study the planet Saturn and its system, including its rings and natural satellites. The Flagship-class robotic spacecraft comprised both NASA&#x27;s &quot;Cassini&quot; space probe and ESA&#x27;s &quot;Huygens&quot; lander, which landed on Saturn&#x27;s largest moon, Titan. &quot;Cassini&quot; was the fourth space probe to visit Saturn and the first to enter its orbit, where it stayed from 2004 to 2017. The two craft took their names from the astronomers Giovanni Cassini and Christiaan Huygens.

Launched aboard a Titan IVB/Centaur on October 15, 1997, &quot;Cassini&quot; was active in space for nearly 20 years, spending its final 13 years orbiting Saturn and studying the planet and its system after entering orbit on July 1, 2004.

The voyage to Saturn included flybys of Venus (April 1998 and July 1999), Earth (August 1999), the asteroid 2685 Masursky, and Jupiter (December 2000). The mission ended on September 15, 2017, when &quot;Cassini&quot;â³s trajectory took it into Saturn&#x27;s upper atmosphere and it burned up in order to prevent any risk of contaminating Saturn&#x27;s moons, which might have offered habitable environments to stowaway terrestrial microbes on the spacecraft. The mission was successful beyond expectations â NASA&#x27;s Planetary Science Division Director, Jim Green, described &quot;Cassini-Huygens&quot; as a &quot;mission of firsts&quot; that has revolutionized human understanding of the Saturn system, including its moons and rings, and our understanding of where life might be found in the Solar System.

&quot;Cassini&quot;â³s planners originally scheduled a mission of four years, from June 2004 to May 2008. The mission was extended for another two years until September 2010, branded the &quot;Cassini Equinox Mission&quot;. The mission was extended a second and final time with the &quot;Cassini Solstice Mission&quot;, lasting another seven years until September 15, 2017, on which date &quot;Cassini&quot; was de-orbited to burn up in Saturn&#x27;s upper atmosphere.

The &quot;Huygens&quot; module traveled with &quot;Cassini&quot; until its separation from the probe on December 25, 2004; Huygens landed by parachute on Titan on January 14, 2005. The separation was facilitated by the SED (Spin/Eject device), which provided a relative separation speed of and a spin rate of 7.5 rpm. It returned data to Earth for around 90 minutes, using the orbiter as a relay. This was the first landing ever accomplished in the outer Solar System and the first landing on a moon other than Earth&#x27;s Moon.

At the end of its mission, the &quot;Cassini&quot; spacecraft executed its &quot;Grand Finale&quot;: a number of risky passes through the gaps between Saturn and its inner rings.
This phase aimed to maximize &quot;Cassini&quot; scientific outcome before the spacecraft was intentionally destroyed to prevent potential contamination of Saturn&#x27;s moons if &quot;Cassini&quot; were to unintentionally crash into them when maneuvering the probe was no longer possible due to power loss or other communication issues at the end of its operational lifespan. The atmospheric entry of &quot;Cassini&quot; ended the mission, but analysis of the returned data will continue for many years.

== Overview ==
Scientists and individuals from 27 countries made up the joint team responsible for designing, building, flying and collecting data from the &quot;Cassini&quot; orbiter and the &quot;Huygens&quot; probe.

NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in the United States, where the orbiter was assembled, managed the mission. The European Space Research and Technology Centre developed &quot;Huygens&quot;. The centre&#x27;s prime contractor, AÃ©rospatiale of France (part of Thales Alenia Space from 2005), assembled the probe with equipment and instruments supplied by many European countries (including &quot;Huygens&quot;â³ batteries and two scientific instruments from the United States). The Italian Space Agency (ASI) provided the &quot;Cassini&quot; orbiter&#x27;s high-gain radio antenna, with the incorporation of a low-gain antenna (to ensure telecommunications with the Earth for the entire duration of the mission), a compact and lightweight radar, which also used the high-gain antenna and served as a synthetic-aperture radar, a radar altimeter, a radiometer, the radio science subsystem (RSS), and the visible-channel portion VIMS-V of VIMS spectrometer.

NASA provided the VIMS infrared counterpart, as well as the Main Electronic Assembly, which included electronic sub-assemblies provided by CNES of France.

On April 16, 2008, NASA announced a two-year extension of the funding for ground operations of this mission, at which point it was renamed the &quot;Cassini&quot; Equinox Mission.
It was extended again in February 2010 as the &quot;Cassini&quot; Solstice Mission.

== Naming ==
The mission consisted of two main elements: the ASI/NASA &quot;Cassini&quot; orbiter, named for the Italian astronomer Giovanni Domenico Cassini, discoverer of Saturn&#x27;s ring divisions and four of its satellites; and the ESA-developed &quot;Huygens&quot; probe, named for the Dutch astronomer, mathematician and physicist Christiaan Huygens, discoverer of Titan.

The mission was commonly called Saturn Orbiter Titan Probe (SOTP) during gestation, both as a Mariner Mark II mission and generically.

&quot;Cassini-Huygens&quot; was a &quot;Flagship&quot;-class mission to the outer planets. The other planetary flagships include &quot;Galileo&quot;, Voyager, and Viking.

== Objectives ==
&quot;Cassini&quot; had several objectives, including:
* Determining the three-dimensional structure and dynamic behavior of the rings of Saturn.
* Determining the composition of the satellite surfaces and the geological history of each object.
* Determining the nature and origin of the dark material on Iapetus&#x27;s leading hemisphere.
* Measuring the three-dimensional structure and dynamic behavior of the magnetosphere.
* Studying the dynamic behavior of Saturn&#x27;s atmosphere at cloud level.
* Studying the time variability of Titan&#x27;s clouds and hazes.
* Characterizing Titan&#x27;s surface on a regional scale.

&quot;CassiniâHuygens&quot; was launched on October 15, 1997, from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station&#x27;s Space Launch ComplexÂ 40 using a U.S.Â Air Force Titan IVB/Centaur rocket. The complete launcher was made up of a two-stage Titan IV booster rocket, two strap-on solid rocket engines, the Centaur upper stage, and a payload enclosure, or fairing.

The total cost of this scientific exploration mission was about US$3.26Â billion, including $1.4Â billion for pre-launch development, $704 million for mission operations, $54Â million for tracking and $422Â million for the launch vehicle. The United States contributed $2.6Â billion (80%), the ESA $500Â million (15%), and the ASI $160Â million (5%). However, these figures are from the press kit which was prepared in October 2000. They do not include inflation over the course of a very long mission, nor do they include the cost of the extended missions.

The primary mission for &quot;Cassini&quot; was completed on July 30, 2008. The mission was extended to June 2010 (&quot;Cassini&quot; Equinox Mission). This studied the Saturn system in detail during the planet&#x27;s equinox, which happened in August 2009.

On February 3, 2010, NASA announced another extension for &quot;Cassini&quot;, lasting 6Â years until 2017, ending at the time of summer solstice in Saturn&#x27;s northern hemisphere (&quot;Cassini&quot; Solstice Mission). The extension enabled another 155Â revolutions around the planet, 54Â flybys of Titan and 11Â flybys of Enceladus.
In 2017, an encounter with Titan changed its orbit in such a way that, at closest approach to Saturn, it was only above the planet&#x27;s cloudtops, below the inner edge of the D ring. This sequence of &quot;proximal orbits&quot; ended when its final encounter with Titan sent the probe into Saturn&#x27;s atmosphere to be destroyed.

== History ==
&quot;CassiniâHuygens&quot;â³s origins date to 1982, when the European Science Foundation and the American National Academy of Sciences formed a working group to investigate future cooperative missions. Two European scientists suggested a paired Saturn Orbiter and Titan Probe as a possible joint mission. In 1983, NASA&#x27;s &quot;Solar System Exploration Committee&quot; recommended the same Orbiter and Probe pair as a core NASA project. NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) performed a joint study of the potential mission from 1984 to 1985. ESA continued with its own study in 1986, while the American astronaut Sally Ride, in her influential 1987 report &quot;NASA Leadership and America&#x27;s Future in Space&quot;, also examined and approved of the &quot;Cassini&quot; mission.

While Ride&#x27;s report described the Saturn orbiter and probe as a NASA solo mission, in 1988 the Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications of NASA, Len Fisk, returned to the idea of a joint NASA and ESA mission. He wrote to his counterpart at ESA, Roger Bonnet, strongly suggesting that ESA choose the &quot;Cassini&quot; mission from the three candidates at hand and promising that NASA would commit to the mission as soon as ESA did.

At the time, NASA was becoming more sensitive to the strain that had developed between the American and European space programs as a result of European perceptions that NASA had not treated it like an equal during previous collaborations. NASA officials and advisers involved in promoting and planning &quot;CassiniâHuygens&quot; attempted to correct this trend by stressing their desire to evenly share any scientific and technology benefits resulting from the mission. In part, this newfound spirit of cooperation with Europe was driven by a sense of competition with the Soviet Union, which had begun to cooperate more closely with Europe as ESA drew further away from NASA. Late in 1988, ESA chose CassiniâHuygens as its next major mission and the following year the program received major funding in the US.

The collaboration not only improved relations between the two space programs but also helped &quot;CassiniâHuygens&quot; survive congressional budget cuts in the United States. &quot;CassiniâHuygens&quot; came under fire politically in both 1992 and 1994, but NASA successfully persuaded the United States Congress that it would be unwise to halt the project after ESA had already poured funds into development because frustration on broken space exploration promises might spill over into other areas of foreign relations. The project proceeded politically smoothly after 1994, although citizens&#x27; groups concerned about the potential environmental impact a launch failure might have (because of its plutonium power source) attempted to derail it through protests and lawsuits until and past its 1997 launch.

== Spacecraft design ==


The spacecraft was planned to be the second three-axis stabilized, RTG-powered Mariner Mark II, a class of spacecraft developed for missions beyond the orbit of Mars, after the Comet Rendezvous Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) mission, but budget cuts and project rescopings forced NASA to terminate CRAF development to save &quot;Cassini&quot;. As a result, &quot;Cassini&quot; became more specialized. The Mariner MarkÂ II series was cancelled.

The combined orbiter and probe was at the time the third-largest uncrewed interplanetary spacecraft ever successfully launched, behind the Phobos 1 and 2 Mars probes, as well as being among the most complex; NASA&#x27;s &quot;Europa Clipper&quot; became the new third-largest probe upon its launch in 2024. The orbiter had a mass of , the probe including of probe support equipment left on the orbiter. With the launch vehicle adapter and of propellants at launch, the spacecraft had a mass of .

The &quot;Cassini&quot; spacecraft was high and wide. Its bus was a dodecagonal prism atop a conical frustum connecting it to a cylinder containing the propellant tanks, to which the RTGs and &quot;Huygens&quot; were attached. Spacecraft complexity was increased by its trajectory (flight path) to Saturn, and by the ambitious science at its destination. &quot;Cassini&quot; had 1,630 interconnected electronic components, 22,000 wire connections, and of cabling. The core control computer CPU was a redundant system using the MIL-STD-1750A instruction set architecture. The main propulsion system consisted of one prime and one backup R-4D bipropellant rocket engine. The thrust of each engine was and the total spacecraft delta-v was . Smaller monopropellant rockets provided attitude control.

&quot;Cassini&quot; was powered by of nuclear fuel, mainly plutonium dioxide (containing of pure plutonium). The heat from the material&#x27;s radioactive decay was turned into electricity. &quot;Huygens&quot; was supported by &quot;Cassini&quot; during cruise, but used chemical batteries when independent.

The probe contained a DVD with more than 616,400 signatures from citizens in 81 countries, collected in a public campaign.

Until September 2017 the &quot;Cassini&quot; probe continued orbiting Saturn at a distance of between from the Earth. It took 68 to 84 minutes for radio signals to travel from Earth to the spacecraft, and vice versa. Thus ground controllers could not give &quot;real-time&quot; instructions for daily operations or for unexpected events. Even if response were immediate, more than two hours would have passed between the occurrence of a problem and the reception of the engineers&#x27; response by the satellite.

=== Description ===
&quot;Cassini&quot;â³s instrumentation consisted of: a synthetic aperture radar mapper, a charge-coupled device imaging system, a visible/infrared mapping spectrometer, a composite infrared spectrometer, a cosmic dust analyzer, a radio and plasma wave experiment, a plasma spectrometer, an ultraviolet imaging spectrograph, a magnetospheric imaging instrument, a magnetometer and an ion/neutral mass spectrometer. Telemetry from the communications antenna and other special transmitters (an S-band transmitter and a dual-frequency Ka-band system) was also used to make observations of the atmospheres of Titan and Saturn and to measure the gravity fields of the planet and its satellites.












== Plutonium power source ==

Because of Saturn&#x27;s distance from the Sun, solar arrays were not feasible as power sources for this space probe. To generate enough power, such arrays would have been too large and too heavy. Instead, the &quot;Cassini&quot; orbiter was powered by three GPHS-RTG radioisotope thermoelectric generators, which use heat from the decay of about of plutonium-238 (in the form of plutonium dioxide) to generate direct current electricity via thermoelectrics.
The RTGs on the &quot;Cassini&quot; mission have the same design as those used on the &quot;New Horizons&quot;, &quot;Galileo&quot;, and &quot;Ulysses&quot; space probes, and they were designed to have very long operational lifetimes.
At the end of the nominal 11-year &quot;Cassini&quot; mission, they were still able to produce 600 to 700 watts of electrical power. (Leftover hardware from the &quot;Cassini&quot; RTG Program was modified and used to power the &quot;New Horizons&quot; mission to Pluto and the Kuiper belt, which was designed and launched later.)

Power distribution was accomplished by 192 solid-state power switches, which also functioned as circuit breakers in the event of an overload condition. The switches used MOSFETs that featured better efficiency and a longer lifetime as compared to conventional switches, while at the same time eliminating transients. However, these solid-state circuit breakers were prone to erroneous tripping (presumably from cosmic rays), requiring them to reset and causing losses in experimental data.
To gain momentum while already in flight, the trajectory of the &quot;Cassini&quot; mission included several gravitational slingshot maneuvers: two fly-by passes of Venus, one more of the Earth, and then one of the planet Jupiter. The terrestrial flyby was the final instance when the probe posed any conceivable danger to human beings. The maneuver was successful, with &quot;Cassini&quot; passing by above the Earth on August 18, 1999.
Had there been any malfunction causing the probe to collide with the Earth, NASA&#x27;s complete environmental impact study estimated that, in the worst case (with an acute angle of entry in which &quot;Cassini&quot; would gradually burn up), a significant fraction of the 33Â kg of nuclear fuel inside the RTGs would have been dispersed into the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere so that up to five billion people (i.e. almost the entire terrestrial population) could have been exposed, causing up to an estimated 5,000 additional cancer deaths over the subsequent decades (0.0005 per cent, i.e. a fraction 0.000005, of a billion cancer deaths expected anyway from other causes; the product is incorrectly calculated elsewhere as 500,000 deaths). However, the chance of this happening were estimated to be less than one in one million, i.e. a chance of one person dying (assuming 5,000 deaths) as less than 1 in 200.

NASA&#x27;s risk analysis to use plutonium was publicly criticized by Michio Kaku on the grounds that casualties, property damage, and lawsuits resulting from a possible accident, as well as the potential use of other energy sources, such as solar and fuel cells, were underestimated.

== Telemetry ==
The &quot;Cassini&quot; spacecraft was capable of transmitting in several different telemetry formats. The telemetry subsystem is perhaps the most important subsystem, because without it there could be no data return.

The telemetry was developed from the ground up, due to the spacecraft using a more modern set of computers than previous missions. Therefore, &quot;Cassini&quot; was the first spacecraft to adopt mini-packets to reduce the complexity of the Telemetry Dictionary, and the software development process led to the creation of a Telemetry Manager for the mission.

There were around 1088 channels (in 67 mini-packets) assembled in the &quot;Cassini&quot; Telemetry Dictionary. Out of these 67 lower complexity mini-packets, 6 mini-packets contained the subsystem covariance and Kalman gain elements (161 measurements), not used during normal mission operations. This left 947 measurements in 61 mini-packets.

A total of seven telemetry maps corresponding to 7 AACS telemetry modes were constructed. These modes are: (1) Record; (2) Nominal Cruise; (3) Medium Slow Cruise; (4) Slow Cruise; (5) Orbital Ops; (6) Av; (7) ATE (Attitude Estimator) Calibration. These 7 maps cover all spacecraft telemetry modes.

== &quot;Huygens&quot; probe ==
The &quot;Huygens&quot; probe, supplied by the European Space Agency (ESA) and named after the 17thÂ century Dutch astronomer who first discovered Titan, Christiaan Huygens, scrutinized the clouds, atmosphere, and surface of Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan in its descent on January 15, 2005. It was designed to enter and brake in Titan&#x27;s atmosphere and parachute a fully instrumented robotic laboratory down to the surface.

The probe system consisted of the probe itself which descended to Titan, and the probe support equipment (PSE) which remained attached to the orbiting spacecraft. The PSE includes electronics that track the probe, recover the data gathered during its descent, and process and deliver the data to the orbiter that transmits it to Earth. The core control computer CPU was a redundant MIL-STD-1750A control system.

The data were transmitted by a radio link between &quot;Huygens&quot; and &quot;Cassini&quot; provided by Probe Data Relay Subsystem (PDRS). As the probe&#x27;s mission could not be telecommanded from Earth because of the great distance, it was automatically managed by the Command Data Management Subsystem (CDMS). The PDRS and CDMS were provided by the Italian Space Agency (ASI).

After &quot;Cassini&quot; launch, it was discovered that data sent from the &quot;Huygens&quot; probe to &quot;Cassini&quot; orbiter (and then re-transmitted to Earth) would be largely unreadable. The cause was that the bandwidth of signal processing electronics was too narrow and the anticipated Doppler shift between the lander and the mother craft would put the signals out of the system&#x27;s range. Thus, &quot;Cassini&quot; receiver would be unable to receive the data from &quot;Huygens&quot; during its descent to Titan.

A work-around was found to recover the mission. The trajectory of &quot;Cassini&quot; was altered to reduce the line of sight velocity and therefore the doppler shift. &quot;Cassini&quot;&#x27;s subsequent trajectory was identical to the previously planned one, although the change replaced two orbits prior to the &quot;Huygens&quot; mission with three, shorter orbits.
== Selected events and discoveries ==


=== Venus and Earth fly-bys and the cruise to Jupiter ===
The &quot;Cassini&quot; space probe performed two gravitational-assist flybys of Venus on April 26, 1998, and June 24, 1999. These flybys provided the space probe with enough momentum to travel all the way out to the asteroid belt, while the Sun&#x27;s gravity pulled the space probe back into the inner Solar System.

On August 18, 1999, at 03:28Â UTC, the craft made a gravitational-assist flyby of the Earth. One hour and 20Â minutes before closest approach, &quot;Cassini&quot; made its closest approach to the Earth&#x27;s Moon at 377,000 kilometers, and it took a series of calibration photos.

On January 23, 2000, &quot;Cassini&quot; performed a flyby of the asteroid 2685 Masursky at around 10:00 UTC. It took photos in the period five to seven hours before the flyby at a distance of and a diameter of was estimated for the asteroid.

=== Jupiter flyby ===
&quot;Cassini&quot; made its closest approach to Jupiter on December 30, 2000, at 9.7 million kilometers, and made many scientific measurements. About 26,000 images of Jupiter, its faint rings, and its moons were taken during the six-month flyby. It produced the most detailed global color portrait of the planet yet (see image at right), in which the smallest visible features are approximately across.
A major finding of the flyby, announced on March 6, 2003, was of Jupiter&#x27;s atmospheric circulation. Dark &quot;belts&quot; alternate with light &quot;zones&quot; in the atmosphere, and scientists had long considered the zones, with their pale clouds, to be areas of upwelling air, partly because many clouds on Earth form where air is rising. But analysis of &quot;Cassini&quot; imagery showed that individual storm cells of upwelling bright-white clouds, too small to see from Earth, pop up almost without exception in the dark belts. According to Anthony Del Genio of NASA&#x27;s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, &quot;the belts must be the areas of net-rising atmospheric motion on Jupiter, [so] the net motion in the zones has to be sinking&quot;.

Other atmospheric observations included a swirling dark oval of high atmospheric haze, about the size of the Great Red Spot, near Jupiter&#x27;s north pole. Infrared imagery revealed aspects of circulation near the poles, with bands of globe-encircling winds, with adjacent bands moving in opposite directions.

The same announcement also discussed the nature of Jupiter&#x27;s rings. Light scattering by particles in the rings showed the particles were irregularly shaped (rather than spherical) and likely originate as ejecta from micrometeorite impacts on Jupiter&#x27;s moons, probably Metis and Adrastea.

=== Tests of general relativity ===

On October 10, 2003, the mission&#x27;s science team announced the results of tests of Albert Einstein&#x27;s general theory of relativity, performed by using radio waves transmitted from the &quot;Cassini&quot; space probe. The radio scientists measured a frequency shift in the radio waves to and from the spacecraft, as they passed close to the Sun. According to the general theory of relativity, a massive object like the Sun causes space-time to curve, causing a beam of radiowaves travelling out of its gravitational well to decrease in frequency and radiowaves travelling into the gravitational well to increase in frequency, referred to as gravitational redshift / blueshift.

Although some measurable deviations from the values calculated using the general theory of relativity are predicted by some unusual cosmological models, no such deviations were found by this experiment. Previous tests using radiowaves transmitted by the &quot;Viking&quot; and &quot;Voyager&quot; space probes were in agreement with the calculated values from general relativity to within an accuracy of one part in one thousand. The more refined measurements from the &quot;Cassini&quot; space probe experiment improved this accuracy to about one part in 51,000. The data firmly support Einstein&#x27;s general theory of relativity.

=== New moons of Saturn ===

In total, the &quot;Cassini&quot; mission discovered seven new moons orbiting Saturn. Using images taken by &quot;Cassini&quot;, researchers discovered Methone, Pallene and Polydeuces in 2004, although later analysis revealed that Voyager 2 had photographed Pallene in its 1981 flyby of the ringed planet.
On May 1, 2005, a new moon was discovered by &quot;Cassini&quot; in the Keeler gap. It was given the designation S/2005Â SÂ 1 before being named Daphnis. A fifth new moon was discovered by &quot;Cassini&quot; on May 30, 2007, and was provisionally labeled S/2007 S 4. It is now known as Anthe. A press release on February 3, 2009, showed a sixth new moon found by &quot;Cassini&quot;. The moon is approximately in diameter within the G-ring of the ring system of Saturn, and is now named Aegaeon (formerly S/2008 S 1). A press release on November 2, 2009, mentions the seventh new moon found by &quot;Cassini&quot; on July 26, 2009. It is presently labeled S/2009 S 1 and is approximately in diameter in the B-ring system.

On April 14, 2014, NASA scientists reported the possible beginning of a new moon in Saturn&#x27;s A Ring.

=== Phoebe flyby ===
On June 11, 2004, &quot;Cassini&quot; flew by the moon Phoebe. This was the first opportunity for close-up studies of this moon (Voyager 2 performed a distant flyby in 1981 but returned no detailed images). It also was &quot;Cassini&#x27;s&quot; only possible flyby for Phoebe due to the mechanics of the available orbits around Saturn.

The first close-up images were received on June 12, 2004, and mission scientists immediately realized that the surface of Phoebe looks different from asteroids visited by spacecraft. Parts of the heavily cratered surface look very bright in those pictures, and it is currently believed that a large amount of water ice exists under its immediate surface.

=== Saturn rotation ===
In an announcement on June 28, 2004, &quot;Cassini&quot; program scientists described the measurement of the rotational period of Saturn. Because there are no fixed features on the surface that can be used to obtain this period, the repetition of radio emissions was used. This new data agreed with the latest values measured from Earth, and constituted a puzzle to the scientists. It turns out that the radio rotational period had changed since it was first measured in 1980 by &quot;Voyager 1&quot;, and it was now 6 minutes longer. This, however, does not indicate a change in the overall spin of the planet. It is thought to be due to variations in the upper atmosphere and ionosphere at the latitudes which are magnetically connected to the radio source region.

In 2019 NASA announced Saturn&#x27;s rotational period as 10 hours, 33 minutes, 38 seconds, calculated using Saturnian ring seismology. Vibrations from Saturn&#x27;s interior cause oscillations in its gravitational field. This energy is absorbed by ring particles in specific locations, where it accumulates until it is released in a wave. Scientists used data from more than 20 of these waves to construct a family of models of Saturn&#x27;s interior, providing basis for calculating its rotational period.

=== Orbiting Saturn ===

On July 1, 2004, the spacecraft flew through the gap between the F and G rings and achieved orbit, after a seven-year voyage. It was the first spacecraft to orbit Saturn.

The Saturn Orbital Insertion (SOI) maneuver performed by &quot;Cassini&quot; was complex, requiring the craft to orient its High-Gain Antenna away from Earth and along its flight path, to shield its instruments from particles in Saturn&#x27;s rings. Once the craft crossed the ring plane, it had to rotate again to point its engine along its flight path, and then the engine fired to decelerate the craft by 622Â m/s to allow Saturn to capture it. &quot;Cassini&quot; was captured by Saturn&#x27;s gravity at around 8:54Â pm Pacific Daylight Time on June 30, 2004. During the maneuver &quot;Cassini&quot; passed within of Saturn&#x27;s cloud tops.

When Cassini was in Saturnian orbit, departure from the Saturn system was evaluated in 2008 during end of mission planning.

=== Titan flybys ===
&quot;Cassini&quot; had its first flyby of Saturn&#x27;s largest moon, Titan, on July 2, 2004, a day after orbit insertion, when it approached to within of Titan. Images taken through special filters (able to see through the moon&#x27;s global haze) showed south polar clouds thought to be composed of methane and surface features with widely differing brightness. On October 27, 2004, the spacecraft executed the first of the 45 planned close flybys of Titan when it passed a mere above the moon. Almost four gigabits of data were collected and transmitted to Earth, including the first radar images of the moon&#x27;s haze-enshrouded surface. It revealed the surface of Titan (at least the area covered by radar) to be relatively level, with topography reaching no more than about in altitude. The flyby provided a remarkable increase in imaging resolution over previous coverage. Images with up to 100 times better resolution were taken and are typical of resolutions planned for subsequent Titan flybys. Cassini collected pictures of Titan and the lakes of methane were similar to the lakes of water on Earth.

=== &quot;Huygens&quot; lands on Titan ===
&quot;Cassini&quot; released the &quot;Huygens&quot; probe on December 25, 2004, by means of a spring and spiral rails intended to rotate the probe for greater stability. It entered the atmosphere of Titan on January 14, 2005, and after a two-and-a-half-hour descent landed on solid ground. Although &quot;Cassini&quot; successfully relayed 350 of the pictures that it received from &quot;Huygens&quot; of its descent and landing site, a malfunction in one of the communications channels resulted in the loss of a further 350 pictures.

=== Enceladus flybys ===

During the first two close flybys of the moon Enceladus in 2005, &quot;Cassini&quot; discovered a deflection in the local magnetic field that is characteristic for the existence of a thin but significant atmosphere. Other measurements obtained at that time point to ionized water vapor as its main constituent. &quot;Cassini&quot; also observed water ice geysers erupting from the south pole of Enceladus, which gives more credibility to the idea that Enceladus is supplying the particles of Saturn&#x27;s E ring. Mission scientists began to suspect that there may be pockets of liquid water near the surface of the moon that fuel the eruptions.

On March 12, 2008, &quot;Cassini&quot; made a close fly-by of Enceladus, passing within 50Â km of the moon&#x27;s surface. The spacecraft passed through the plumes extending from its southern geysers, detecting water, carbon dioxide and various hydrocarbons with its mass spectrometer, while also mapping surface features that are at much higher temperature than their surroundings with the infrared spectrometer. &quot;Cassini&quot; was unable to collect data with its cosmic dust analyzer due to an unknown software malfunction.

On November 21, 2009, &quot;Cassini&quot; made its eighth flyby of Enceladus, this time with a different geometry, approaching within of the surface. The Composite Infrared Spectrograph (CIRS) instrument produced a map of thermal emissions from the Baghdad Sulcus &#x27;tiger stripe&#x27;. The data returned helped create a detailed and high resolution mosaic image of the southern part of the moon&#x27;s Saturn-facing hemisphere.

On April 3, 2014, nearly ten years after &quot;Cassini&quot; entered Saturn&#x27;s orbit, NASA reported evidence of a large salty internal ocean of liquid water in Enceladus. The presence of an internal salty ocean in contact with the moon&#x27;s rocky core, places Enceladus &quot;among the most likely places in the Solar System to host alien microbial life&quot;. On June 30, 2014, NASA celebrated ten years of &quot;Cassini&quot; exploring Saturn and its moons, highlighting the discovery of water activity on Enceladus among other findings.

In September 2015, NASA announced that gravitational and imaging data from &quot;Cassini&quot; were used to analyze the librations of Enceladus&#x27; orbit and determined that the moon&#x27;s surface is not rigidly joined to its core, concluding that the underground ocean must therefore be global in extent.

On October 28, 2015, &quot;Cassini&quot; performed a close flyby of Enceladus, coming within of the surface, and passing through the icy plume above the south pole.

On December 14, 2023, astronomers reported the first time discovery, in the plumes of Enceladus, of hydrogen cyanide, a possible chemical essential for life as we know it, as well as other organic molecules, some of which are yet to be better identified and understood. According to the researchers, &quot;these [newly discovered] compounds could potentially support extant microbial communities or drive complex organic synthesis leading to the origin of life&quot;.

=== Radio occultations of Saturn&#x27;s rings ===
In May 2005, &quot;Cassini&quot; began a series of radio occultation experiments, to measure the size-distribution of particles in Saturn&#x27;s rings, and measure the atmosphere of Saturn itself. For over four months, the craft completed orbits designed for this purpose. During these experiments, it flew behind the ring plane of Saturn, as seen from Earth, and transmitted radio waves through the particles. The radio signals received on Earth were analyzed, for frequency, phase, and power shift of the signal to determine the structure of the rings.


=== Spokes in rings verified ===
In images captured September 5, 2005, &quot;Cassini&quot; detected spokes in Saturn&#x27;s rings, previously seen only by the visual observer Stephen James O&#x27;Meara in 1977 and then confirmed by the Voyager space probes in the early 1980s.

=== Lakes of Titan ===


Radar images obtained on July 21, 2006, appear to show lakes of liquid hydrocarbon (such as methane and ethane) in Titan&#x27;s northern latitudes. This is the first discovery of currently existing lakes anywhere besides on Earth. The lakes range in size from one to one-hundred kilometers across.

On March 13, 2007, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory announced that it had found strong evidence of seas of methane and ethane in the northern hemisphere of Titan. At least one of these is larger than any of the Great Lakes in North America.

=== Saturn hurricane ===
In November 2006, scientists discovered a storm at the south pole of Saturn with a distinct eyewall. This is characteristic of a hurricane on Earth and had never been seen on another planet before. Unlike a terrestrial hurricane, the storm appears to be stationary at the pole. The storm is across, and high, with winds blowing at .

=== Iapetus flyby ===
On September 10, 2007, &quot;Cassini&quot; completed its flyby of the strange, two-toned, walnut-shaped moon, Iapetus. Images were taken from above the surface. As it was sending the images back to Earth, it was hit by a cosmic ray that forced it to temporarily enter safe mode. All of the data from the flyby were recovered.

=== Mission extension ===

On April 15, 2008, &quot;Cassini&quot; received funding for a 27-month extended mission. It consisted of 60 more orbits of Saturn, with 21 more close Titan flybys, seven of Enceladus, six of Mimas, eight of Tethys, and one targeted flyby each of Dione, Rhea, and Helene. The extended mission began on July 1, 2008, and was renamed the Cassini Equinox Mission as the mission coincided with Saturn&#x27;s equinox.

=== Second mission extension ===
A proposal was submitted to NASA for a second mission extension (September 2010 â May 2017), provisionally named the extended-extended mission or XXM. This ($60M pa) was approved in February 2010 and renamed the Cassini Solstice Mission. It included &quot;Cassini&quot; orbiting Saturn 155 more times, conducting 54 additional flybys of Titan and 11 more of Enceladus.

=== Great Storm of 2010 and aftermath ===

On October 25, 2012, &quot;Cassini&quot; witnessed the aftermath of the massive Great White Spot storm that recurs roughly every 30 years on Saturn. Data from the composite infrared spectrometer (CIRS) instrument indicated a powerful discharge from the storm that caused a temperature spike in the stratosphere of Saturn above normal. Simultaneously, a huge increase in ethylene gas was detected by NASA researchers at Goddard Research Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. Ethylene is a colorless gas that is highly uncommon on Saturn and is produced both naturally and through man-made sources on Earth. The storm that produced this discharge was first observed by the spacecraft on December 5, 2010, in Saturn&#x27;s northern hemisphere. The storm is the first of its kind to be observed by a spacecraft in orbit around Saturn as well as the first to be observed at thermal infrared wavelengths, allowing scientists to observe the temperature of Saturn&#x27;s atmosphere and track phenomena that are invisible to the naked eye. The spike of ethylene gas that was produced by the storm reached levels that were 100 times more than those thought possible for Saturn. Scientists have also determined that the storm witnessed was the largest, hottest stratospheric vortex ever detected in the Solar System, initially being larger than Jupiter&#x27;s Great Red Spot.

=== Venus transit ===
On December 21, 2012, &quot;Cassini&quot; observed a transit of Venus across the Sun. The VIMS instrument analyzed sunlight passing through the Venusian atmosphere. VIMS previously observed the transit of exoplanet HD 189733 b.

=== &quot;The Day the Earth Smiled&quot; ===

On July 19, 2013, the probe was pointed towards Earth to capture an image of the Earth and the Moon, as part of a natural light, multi-image portrait of the entire Saturn system. The event was unique as it was the first time NASA informed the public that a long-distance photo was being taken in advance. The imaging team said they wanted people to smile and wave to the skies, with &quot;Cassini&quot; scientist Carolyn Porco describing the moment as a chance to &quot;celebrate life on the Pale Blue Dot&quot;.

=== Rhea flyby ===
On February 10, 2015, the &quot;Cassini&quot; spacecraft visited Rhea more closely, coming within . The spacecraft observed the moon with its cameras producing some of the highest resolution color images yet of Rhea.

=== Hyperion flyby ===
&quot;Cassini&quot; performed its latest flyby of Saturn&#x27;s moon Hyperion on May 31, 2015, at a distance of about .

=== Dione flyby ===
&quot;Cassini&quot; performed its last flyby of Saturn&#x27;s moon Dione on August 17, 2015, at a distance of about . A previous flyby was performed on June 16.

=== Hexagon changes color ===

Between 2012 and 2016, the persistent hexagonal cloud pattern at Saturn&#x27;s north pole changed from a mostly blue color to more of a golden color. One theory for this is a seasonal change: extended exposure to sunlight may be creating haze as the pole swivels toward the Sun. It was previously noted that there was less blue color overall on Saturn between 2004 and 2008.

== Grand Finale and destruction ==
&quot;Cassini&quot; end involved a series of close Saturn passes, approaching within the rings, then an entry into Saturn&#x27;s atmosphere on September 15, 2017, to destroy the spacecraft. This method was chosen to ensure protection and prevent biological contamination to any of the moons of Saturn thought to offer potential habitability.

In 2008 a number of options were evaluated to achieve this goal, each with varying funding, scientific, and technical challenges. A short period Saturn impact for an end of mission was rated &quot;excellent&quot; with the reasons &quot;D-ring option satisfies unachieved AO goals; cheap and easily achievable&quot; while collision with an icy moon was rated &quot;good&quot; for being &quot;cheap and achievable anywhere/time&quot;.

There were problems in 2013â14 about NASA receiving U.S. government funding for the Grand Finale. The two phases of the Grand Finale ended up being the equivalent of having two separate &quot;Discovery&quot;-class missions in that the Grand Finale was completely different from the main &quot;Cassini&quot; regular mission. The U.S. government in late 2014 approved the Grand Finale at the cost of $200 million. This was far cheaper than building two new probes in separate &quot;Discovery&quot;-class missions.

On November 29, 2016, the spacecraft performed a Titan flyby that took it to the gateway of F-ring orbits: This was the start of the Grand Finale phase culminating in its impact with the planet. A final Titan flyby on April 22, 2017, changed the orbit again to fly through the gap between Saturn and its inner ring days later on April 26. &quot;Cassini&quot; passed about above Saturn&#x27;s cloud layer and from the visible edge of the inner ring; it successfully took images of Saturn&#x27;s atmosphere and began returning data the next day. After a further 22 orbits through the gap, the mission was ended with a dive into Saturn&#x27;s atmosphere on September 15; signal was lost at 11:55:46 UTC on September 15, 2017, just 30 seconds later than predicted. It is estimated that the spacecraft burned up about 45 seconds after the last transmission.

In September 2018, NASA won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Interactive Program for its presentation of the &quot;Cassini&quot; mission&#x27;s Grand Finale at Saturn.

In December 2018, Netflix aired &quot;NASA&#x27;s Cassini Mission&quot; on their series &quot;7 Days Out&quot; documenting the final days of work on the &quot;Cassini&quot; mission before the spacecraft crashed into Saturn to complete its Grand Finale.

In January 2019, new research using data collected during &quot;Cassini&quot; Grand Finale phase was published:

* The final close passes by the rings and planet enabled scientists to measure the length of a day on Saturn: 10 hours, 33 minutes and 38 seconds.
* Saturn&#x27;s rings are relatively new, 10 to 100 million years old.

=== Missions ===
The spacecraft operation was organized around a series of missions. Each is structured according to a certain amount of funding, goals, etc. At least 260 scientists from 17 countries have worked on the &quot;CassiniâHuygens&quot; mission; in addition thousands of people overall worked to design, manufacture, and launch the mission.
* Prime Mission, July 2004 through June 2008.
* &quot;Cassini&quot; Equinox Mission was a two-year mission extension which ran from July 2008 through September 2010.
* &quot;Cassini&quot; Solstice Mission ran from October 2010 through April 2017. (Also known as the XXM mission.)
* Grand Finale (spacecraft directed into Saturn), April 2017 to September 15, 2017.

<text>David Paul Scofield (21 January 1922 â 19 March 2008) was an English actor. During a six-decade career, Scofield achieved the Triple Crown of Acting, winning an Academy Award, Emmy, and Tony for his work. Scofield established a reputation as one of the greatest Shakespearean performers. He declined the honour of a knighthood, but was appointed CBE in 1956 and became a CH in 2001.

Scofield received the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play for portraying Sir Thomas More in the Broadway production of &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot; (1962). Four years later, he won the Academy Award for Best Actor when he reprised the role in the 1966 film adaptation, making him one of eleven to receive a Tony and Academy Award for the same role. He received the Primetime Emmy Award for &quot;Male of the Species&quot; (1969).

Scofield garnered acclaim for his roles in films such as &quot;The Train&quot; (1964), &quot;King Lear&quot; (1971), &quot;A Delicate Balance&quot; (1973), &quot;Henry V&quot; (1989), and &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1990). He portrayed Mark Van Doren in the historical drama &quot;Quiz Show&quot; (1994), for which he earned a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. For his role as Thomas Danforth in the film adaptation of &quot;The Crucible&quot; (1996) he received the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role.

==Early life and education==
Paul Scofield was born on 21 January 1922 in Edgbaston, Birmingham, Warwickshire, England, the son of Mary and Edward Harry Scofield. When Scofield was a few weeks old, his family moved to Hurstpierpoint, Sussex, where his father became headmaster at the Hurstpierpoint Church of England School. Scofield told his biographer, Garry O&#x27;Connor, that his upbringing was divided. His father was an Anglican and his mother a Roman Catholic. Baptised into his mother&#x27;s faith, Scofield said, &quot;some days we were little Protestants and, on others, we were all devout little Catholics.&quot; He added, &quot;A lack of direction in spiritual matters is still with me.&quot;

Scofield recalled: &quot;I was a dunce at school. But at the age of twelve I went to Varndean School at Brighton where I discovered Shakespeare. They did one of his plays every year, and I lived just for that.&quot; In 1961, Scofield wrote, &quot;I don&#x27;t have a psychological approach to acting; fundamentally, I have an intuitive approach. For me, the totally intellectual approach is never satisfactory. What matters to me is whether I like the play, for one thing, and, for another, whether I can recognize and identify myself with the character I&#x27;m to play.&quot; In 1939, Scofield left school at the age of seventeen and began training at the Croydon Repertory Theatre. Shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War, Scofield arrived for a physical examination and was ruled unfit for service in the British Army. He later recalled, &quot;They found I had crossed toes. I was unable to wear boots. I was deeply ashamed.&quot;

==Career==
===1940â1959: Rise to prominence===
Scofield began his stage career in 1940 with a debut performance in American playwright Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;Desire Under the Elms&quot; at the Westminster Theatre, and was soon being compared to Laurence Olivier. He played at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre. From there he went to the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in Stratford, where he starred in Walter Nugent Monck&#x27;s 1947 revival of &quot;Pericles, Prince of Tyre&quot;.

In 1948, Scofield appeared as Hamlet at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in Stratford alongside a then unknown Claire Bloom as Ophelia. Scofield&#x27;s performance was so highly praised that it caused him to be dubbed, &quot;The Hamlet of his generation.&quot; He was also Bassanio in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; with Bloom as an Attendee. J.C. Trewin commented, &quot;He is simply a timeless Hamlet... None could forget Scofield&#x27;s pathos, the face folded in grief, at, &#x27;When you are desirous to be blessed, I&#x27;ll blessing beg of you.&#x27; We have known many correct, almost formal Hamlets, aloof from Elsinore. Scofield was ever a prisoner within its bounds: the world had many confines, wards, and dungeons, Denmark being one of the worst.&quot;

John Harrison, Director of the Leeds Playhouse, later recalled of Scofield&#x27;s Hamlet, &quot;&#x27;Get thee to a nunnery,&#x27; so often delivered with rage or scorn, he says so gently. You have visions of quiet and prayer. A future for Ophelia.&quot; In her later book, &quot;Leaving a Doll&#x27;s House: A Memoir&quot;, Claire Bloom recalls that during the production she had a very serious crush on Scofield. As Scofield &quot;was happily married and the father of a son&quot;, Bloom hoped only &quot;to be flirted with and taken some notice of.&quot; But Scofield never so much as glanced at Bloom or any of the other pretty actresses in the cast. Unusually, the production had two Hamlets: Scofield and Robert Helpmann took turns playing the title role and Bloom later recalled, &quot;I could never make up my mind which of my two Hamlets I found the more devastating: the openly homosexual, charismatic Helpmann, or the charming, shy young man from Sussex.&quot;

Scofield&#x27;s versatility at the height of his career is exemplified by his starring roles in theatrical productions as diverse as the musical &quot;Expresso Bongo&quot; (1958) and Peter Brook&#x27;s celebrated production of &quot;King Lear&quot; (1962). Brook wrote in his memoir, &quot;Threads of Time&quot;, &quot;The door at the back of the set opened, and a small man entered. He was wearing a black suit, steel-rimmed glasses and holding a suitcase. For a moment we wondered who this stranger was and why he was wandering onto our stage. Then we realised that it was Paul, transformed. His tall body had shrunk; he had become insignificant. The new character now possessed him entirely.&quot;

===1960â1979: &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot; and acclaim===

One of the highlights of Scofield&#x27;s career in modern theatre is the role of Sir Thomas More in Robert Bolt&#x27;s &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot;, which opened in July 1960. Scofield later referred to the part as the only time &quot;my intuition for the part has failed me.&quot; Theatre reviewers published very harsh criticism of Scofield&#x27;s performance at first, which forced him to &quot;start from scratch and just work on facts, making myself totally faithful to what was on the page&quot;. After realizing &quot;I had to find the way the man would feel; then I was able to find the way he should sound&quot;, and the vital importance of conveying complete sincerity and humility when &quot;playing a man of spiritual depth&quot;, Scofield successfully developed a means of performing as Thomas More through trial and error.

Austrian-American filmmaker Fred Zinnemann later recalled of seeing the play onstage, &quot;It dealt with the sixteenth-century English statesman Thomas More, beheaded on the orders of his King, Henry VIII, for refusing to sanction his marriage to Anne Boleyn. With Paul Scofield in the lead, the play was a powerful emotional experience. It dramatized the nation&#x27;s unquestioning submission to the absolute power of the king, in stark contrast to More, whose last words before the execution were, &#x27;I die the Kings good servant, but God&#x27;s first.&#x27;&quot;

When Fred Zinnemann was first approached about directing the 1966 film adaptation of &quot;A Man For All Seasons&quot; by Columbia Pictures executive Mike Frankovich in 1965 and enthusiastically agreed, the studio did not wish to cast Scofield as the lead. Preferring a more internationally bankable cast, the studio desired either Laurence Olivier or Richard Burton as Thomas More, Alec Guinness as Cardinal Wolsey, and Peter O&#x27;Toole as King Henry VIII. Both Zinnemann and screenwriter Robert Bolt disagreed, however, but still went through the motions of meeting with Olivier and then informing him politely that he had not been chosen. Scofield, who was cast after Columbia grudgingly &quot;fell in with Zinnemann&#x27;s wishes&quot;, later recalled, &quot;I was surprised and honoured to be chosen for the film, being almost unknown in the movie world... My own task was unaltered except that I now focused on my thoughts on to a camera instead of an audience.&quot;

Even though defying the studio&#x27;s casting wishes forced him to film &quot;A Man For All Seasons&quot; on a shoestring budget, Fred Zinnemann felt very differently about Scofield and later recalled of the film shoot, &quot;For the first few days the crew did their usual work very well, the way they would have done any job, but on the third day, when Scofield made his speech about the majesty of the law, they were suddenly mesmerized by the magic of those words and they remained that way throughout the rest of the filming. So totally did Paul convey the scope of More&#x27;s character that for months afterwards I couldn&#x27;t help but look at him in awe, as a saint rather than an actor.&quot;
In 1964, Scofield acted in the John Frankenheimer war film &quot;The Train&quot; alongside Burt Lancaster. The film is set in August 1944 during World War II, it pits French Resistance-member Paul Labiche (Lancaster) against German Colonel Franz von Waldheim (Scofield), who is attempting to move stolen art masterpieces by train to Germany. The film received positive acclaim and was ranked as one of the best films by the National Board of Review. 

Writing in 1961, Scofield explained, &quot;Output in the theatre requires greater energy than anything else I know. Doubt of one&#x27;s energy is the worst of all. One&#x27;s output in the theatre requires energy of a sort that is never a factor in family life. Family energy generates itself. Social life outside the family can be exhausting. I don&#x27;t care much for social life with people in the theatre. I&#x27;m rather good at being with people when I want to make the effort, but I&#x27;m bad at listening to people when I know what they&#x27;re going to say. It isn&#x27;t very interesting, and on the whole it&#x27;s very draining. The interesting thing in the theatre is the work and working with people. I usually like the people in the work, but I can&#x27;t go on with them outside the work as long as most actors can. And when I&#x27;m working on a part I&#x27;m thinking about it all the time, going over all the possibilities in my mind. I like to be alone when I&#x27;m working.&quot;

In a career devoted chiefly to the classical theatre, Scofield starred in many Shakespeare plays and played the title role in Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Volpone&quot; in Peter Hall&#x27;s production for the Royal National Theatre (1977). In a 1994 interview, Scofield explained, &quot;One of the great strengths of the theatre is that it is ephemeral. It does exist only in what you remember and you can&#x27;t check up on it afterwards and think, &#x27;That&#x27;s not as good as I remember.&#x27; If any performance I&#x27;ve ever given stays in someone&#x27;s mind that&#x27;s so much more exciting than being able to put it on the video and play it again. It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t want to take risks - the opposite is true, in fact. But the more you know about acting, the more you&#x27;re aware of the pitfalls and the more nerve-racking it becomes. When I was young, I wasn&#x27;t nervous at all. Even doing &quot;Hamlet&quot;, I just had a go.&quot;

Scofield also appeared as Charles Dyer in Dyer&#x27;s play &quot;Staircase&quot;, staged by the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1966; Laurie in John Osborne&#x27;s &quot;A Hotel in Amsterdam&quot; (1968); and Antonio Salieri in the original stage production of Peter Shaffer&#x27;s &quot;Amadeus&quot; (1979). He was subsequently the voice of the Dragon in another play by Robert Bolt, a children&#x27;s drama &quot;The Thwarting of Baron Bolligrew&quot;. &quot;Expresso Bongo&quot;, &quot;Staircase&quot; and &quot;Amadeus&quot; were filmed with other actors, but Scofield starred in the screen version of &quot;King Lear&quot; (1971). Other major screen roles include the art-obsessed Wehrmacht Colonel von Waldheim in &quot;The Train&quot; (1964), Strether in a 1977 TV adaptation of Henry James&#x27;s novel &quot;The Ambassadors&quot;, and Tobias in Edward Albee&#x27;s &quot;A Delicate Balance&quot; (1973).

===1980â1999===
Scofield was cast in the lead role of Sir Randolph Nettleby in the 1985 film &quot;The Shooting Party&quot;, but was forced to withdraw due to an injury he suffered on set. According to the DVD extras documentary for the film, Scofield and the other male lead actors were to come into shot on a horse-drawn shooting brake driven by the renowned film horse-master George Mossman as the first shot of the first day of filming. As they turned the first corner, the plank that Mossman was standing on broke in two and he was hurled forward and down, falling between the sets of wheels and taking the reins with him. He was struck by a horse&#x27;s hoof and concussed. The horses shied and broke into a gallop. Actor Rupert Frazer admitted that he was the first to jump off, landing safely, but bruised. Out of control, the horses turned to the right when confronted by a stone wall, causing the shooting brake to roll completely, catapulting the actors into a pile of scaffolding that had been stacked next to the wall. Robert Hardy stood up and realised to his amazement that he was unhurt. He looked across to see Edward Fox stand up, &quot;turn completely green and collapse in a heap&quot;, having broken five ribs and his shoulder blade. He noticed that Scofield was lying very still on the ground &quot;and I saw that his shin-bone was sticking out through his trousers&quot;. As the film takes place in October during the partridge-shooting season, the filmmakers had to make a choice whether to delay filming for a year or re-cast. The &quot;Shooting Party&quot; schedule was ultimately changed to allow James Mason to take over the part of Sir Randolph Nettleby six weeks later. Scofield&#x27;s broken leg also deprived him of the part of O&#x27;Brien in &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four,&quot; in which he was replaced by Richard Burton.

Helen Mirren, who appeared with Scofield in the 1989 film &quot;When the Whales Came&quot;, said, &quot;He aspires to the soul rather than the character. He has no sense of personal ambition. He&#x27;s one of our great, great actors. We&#x27;re lucky to have him.&quot; Scofield also portrayed the Ghost in Franco Zeffirelli&#x27;s 1990 film adaptation of &quot;Hamlet&quot; alongside Mel Gibson in the title role. Despite being an A-list actor at the time, Gibson, who had grown up idolising Scofield, compared the experience of performing Shakespeare alongside him to being, &quot;thrown into the ring with Mike Tyson&quot;. Scofield, on the other hand, never felt similarly intimidated and later recalled about working with Gibson, &quot;Not the actor you&#x27;d think would make an ideal Hamlet, but he had enormous integrity and intelligence.&quot; Scofield portrayed Professor Moroi in the film of JÃ¡nos NyÃ­ri&#x27;s &quot;If Winter Comes&quot; (1980), for BBC Television; poet Mark Van Doren in Robert Redford&#x27;s film &quot;Quiz Show&quot; (1994), and Deputy Governor Thomas Danforth in Nicholas Hytner&#x27;s film adaptation (1996) of Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;The Crucible&quot;.

== Personal life and death ==

Paul Scofield married actress Joy Mary Parker on 15 May 1943. They had met while he played Hamlet to her Ophelia. Scofield later said &quot;Joy and I simply decided to be married. We were both of age and were determined. Any doubts from our families were overruled, and they were the usual ones â too young, etc. We had a week out at the end of &quot;The Moon Is Down&quot; tour, married during that week, and went straight into the Whitehall Theatre.&quot;

Paul and Joy Scofield had two children: Martin (born 1945) who became a senior lecturer in English and American literature at the University of Kent and Sarah (born 1951). When asked by Garry O&#x27;Connor how he wished to be remembered, Scofield responded &quot;If you have a family, that is how to be remembered.&quot; When O&#x27;Connor asked about his seventieth birthday, Scofield replied, &quot;Birthdays are a bore, really. It&#x27;s true, I do like my fallow times... I hate missing anything that might be happening outside on a summer evening, something in the garden.&quot; Filmmaker Michael Winner accordingly described Paul and Joy Scofield as &quot;one of the few very happily married couples I&#x27;ve ever met.&quot;

Scofield died from leukaemia on 19 March 2008 at the age of 86 at the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton, East Sussex, England. His memorial service was held at Westminster Abbey on the first anniversary of his death. His wife Joy died four years later on 7 November 2012, aged 90.

==Awards and honours==
Scofield was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1956 New Year Honours. When Scofield was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot;, he declined to travel to Los Angeles to attend the ceremony. When Scofield won the award, his leading lady Wendy Hiller, whom Fred Zinnemann had cast as Lady Alice More for being, &quot;particularly marvelous at doing a &#x27;slow burn&#x27;&quot;, went up on stage to receive the Award Statue on Scofield&#x27;s behalf. According to his biographer Garry O&#x27;Connor, Scofield always kept his Oscar Statue, &quot;put... away in the corner of his workroom&quot;. Scofield explained, &quot;Although it was nice to get, it&#x27;s not decorative, really. I suppose that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t display it. But if anyone wants to see it I&#x27;ll get it out.&quot;

Scofield was subsequently nominated as Best Supporting Actor for &quot;Quiz Show&quot;. His many theatrical accolades include a 1962 Tony Award for &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot;. In 1969, Scofield became the sixth performer to win the Triple Crown of Acting, winning an Emmy Award for Outstanding Single Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role for &quot;Male of the Species&quot;. He accomplished this in only seven years (1962â1969), which is still a record. He was also one of only eleven actors to win both the Tony and the Oscar for the same role on stage and film, for &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot;. Scofield declined the honour of a knighthood on three occasions, but was appointed CBE in 1956 and became a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in 2001. In 1972, the Hamburg-based Alfred Toepfer Foundation awarded Scofield its annual Shakespeare Prize. In 2002 he was awarded the honorary degree of D. Litt by the University of Oxford.

When asked the reason for his decision to decline the knighthood, Scofield responded, &quot;I have every respect for people who are offered [a knighthood] and accept it gratefully. It is just not an aspect of life that I would want.&quot; Gary O&#x27;Connor described being knighted as, &quot;The kind of honour from which [Scofield] instinctively recoiled. Never the actor before the part he plays.&quot; In 2004, a poll of actors of the Royal Shakespeare Company, including Ian McKellen, Donald Sinden, Janet Suzman, Ian Richardson, Antony Sher and Corin Redgrave, acclaimed Scofield&#x27;s Lear as the greatest Shakespearean performance ever. Scofield appeared in many radio dramas for BBC Radio 4, including in later years plays by Peter Tinniswood: &quot;On the Train to Chemnitz&quot; (2001) and &quot;Anton in Eastbourne&quot; (2002). The latter was Tinniswood&#x27;s last work and was written especially for Scofield, an admirer of Anton Chekhov. He was awarded the 2002 Sam Wanamaker Prize.

<text>The politics of the Netherlands Antilles, a former constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, existed in a framework of a parliamentary representative democratic country, in which the prime minister was the head of government, and of a multi-party system. Executive power was exercised by the government. Federal legislative power was vested in both the government and parliament. The Judiciary was independent of the executive and the legislature. The Netherlands Antilles had full autonomy on most matters. Exceptions were defence, foreign affairs, and the Supreme Court.

Executive power rested with a governor, and a prime minister headed an eight-member Cabinet. The governor was appointed for a six-year term by the monarch, and the prime minister and deputy prime minister were elected by the Staten for four-year terms. The legislature or Staten elected by direct, popular vote to serve four-year terms.

The judicial system, which had mainly been derived from the Dutch system, operated independently of the legislature and the executive. Jurisdiction, including appeal, lied with the Common Court of Justice of the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba and the Supreme Court of Justice in the Netherlands.

The Netherlands Antilles were disbanded on 10 October 2010.

==Executive branch==

The Governor was appointed by the monarch for a six-year term.&lt;br&gt;
The Council of Ministers was elected by the Staten.

==Legislative branch==
Unicameral Estates of the Netherlands Antilles (22 seats; members were elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms)

==Political parties and elections==

Political parties were indigenous to each island.

==Judicial branch==
Joint High Court of Justice, judges appointed by the monarch

==Administrative divisions==
The Antilles were divided into five insular territories: CuraÃ§ao, Bonaire, Sint Maarten, Saba, Sint Eustatius. On 10 October 2010 the Netherlands Antilles were disbanded.

<doc id="67955" wikidata="Q56158" url="?curid=67955" title="Georges Bizet">
<text>Georges Bizet (; 25 October 18383Â June 1875) was a French composer of the Romantic era. Best known for his operas in a career cut short by his early death, Bizet achieved few successes before his final work, &quot;Carmen&quot;, which has become one of the most popular and frequently performed works in the entire opera repertoire.

During a brilliant student career at the Conservatoire de Paris, Bizet won many prizes, including the prestigious Prix de Rome in 1857. He was recognised as an outstanding pianist, though he chose not to capitalise on this skill and rarely performed in public. Returning to Paris after almost three years in Italy, he found that the main Parisian opera theatres preferred the established classical repertoire to the works of newcomers. His keyboard and orchestral compositions were likewise largely ignored; as a result, his career stalled, and he earned his living mainly by arranging and transcribing the music of others. Restless for success, he began many theatrical projects during the 1860s, most of which were abandoned. Neither of his two operas that reached the stage in this timeâ&quot;Les pÃªcheurs de perles&quot; and &quot;La jolie fille de Perth&quot;âwere immediately successful.

After the Franco-Prussian War of 1870â1871, during which Bizet served in the National Guard, he had little success with his one-act opera &quot;Djamileh&quot;, though an orchestral suite derived from his incidental music to Alphonse Daudet&#x27;s play &quot;L&#x27;ArlÃ©sienne&quot; was instantly popular. The production of his final opera, &quot;Carmen&quot;, was delayed because of fears that its themes of betrayal and murder would offend audiences. After its premiere on 3 March 1875, Bizet was convinced that the work was a failure; he died of a heart attack three months later, unaware that it would prove a spectacular and enduring success.

Bizet&#x27;s marriage to GeneviÃ¨ve HalÃ©vy was intermittently happy and produced one son. After his death, his work, apart from &quot;Carmen&quot;, was generally neglected. Manuscripts were given away or lost, and published versions of his works were frequently revised and adapted by other hands. He founded no school and had no obvious disciples or successors. After years of neglect, his works began to be performed more frequently in the 20th century. Later commentators have acclaimed him as a composer of brilliance and originality whose premature death was a significant loss to French musical theatre.

==Life==
===Early years===
====Family background and childhood====
Georges Bizet was born in Paris on 25 October 1838. He was registered as Alexandre CÃ©sar LÃ©opold, but baptised as &quot;Georges&quot; on 16 March 1840, and was known by this name for the rest of his life. His father, Adolphe Bizet, had been a hairdresser and wigmaker before becoming a singing teacher despite his lack of formal training. He also composed a few works, including at least one published song. In 1837, Adolphe married AimÃ©e Delsarte, against the wishes of her family who considered him a poor prospect; the Delsartes, though impoverished, were a cultured and highly musical family. AimÃ©e was an accomplished pianist, while her brother FranÃ§ois Delsarte was a distinguished singer and teacher who performed at the courts of both Louis Philippe and Napoleon III. FranÃ§ois Delsarte&#x27;s wife Rosine, a musical prodigy, had been an assistant professor of solfÃ¨ge at the Conservatoire de Paris at the age of 13. At least one author has suggested that AimÃ©e was from a Jewish family, but this is not substantiated in any of Georges&#x27; official biographies.

Georges, an only child, showed early aptitude for music and quickly picked up the basics of musical notation from his mother, who probably gave him his first piano lessons. By listening at the door of the room where Adolphe conducted his classes, Georges learned to sing difficult songs accurately from memory and developed an ability to identify and analyse complex chordal structures. This precocity convinced his ambitious parents that he was ready to begin studying at the Conservatoire even though he was still only nine years old (the minimum entry age was 10). Georges was interviewed by Joseph Meifred, the horn virtuoso who was a member of the Conservatoire&#x27;s Committee of Studies. Meifred was so struck by the boy&#x27;s demonstration of his skills that he waived the age rule and offered to take him as soon as a place became available.

====Conservatoire====

Bizet was admitted to the Conservatoire on 9 October 1848, two weeks before his 10th birthday. He made an early impression; within six months he had won first prize in solfÃ¨ge, a feat that impressed Pierre-Joseph-Guillaume Zimmerman, the Conservatoire&#x27;s former professor of piano. Zimmerman gave Bizet private lessons in counterpoint and fugue, which continued until the old man&#x27;s death in 1853. Through these classes, Bizet met Zimmerman&#x27;s son-in-law, the composer Charles Gounod, who became a lasting influence on the young pupil&#x27;s musical styleâalthough their relationship was often strained in later years. He also met another of Gounod&#x27;s young students, the 13-year-old Camille Saint-SaÃ«ns, who remained a firm friend of Bizet&#x27;s. Under the tuition of Antoine FranÃ§ois Marmontel, the Conservatoire&#x27;s professor of piano, Bizet&#x27;s pianism developed rapidly; he won the Conservatoire&#x27;s second prize for piano in 1851, and first prize the following year. Bizet would later write to Marmontel: &quot;In your class one learns something besides the piano; one becomes a musician&quot;.

Bizet&#x27;s first preserved compositions, two wordless songs for soprano, date from around 1850. In 1853, he joined Fromental HalÃ©vy&#x27;s composition class and began to produce works of increasing sophistication and quality. Two of his songs, &quot;Petite Marguerite&quot; and &quot;La Rose et l&#x27;abeille&quot;, were published in 1854. In 1855, he wrote an ambitious overture for a large orchestra, and prepared four-hand piano versions of two of Gounod&#x27;s works: the opera &quot;La nonne sanglante&quot; and the Symphony in D. Bizet&#x27;s work on the Gounod symphony inspired him, shortly after his seventeenth birthday, to write his own symphony, which bore a close resemblance to Gounod&#x27;sânote for note in some passages. Bizet never published the symphony, which came to light again only in 1933, and was finally performed in 1935.

In 1856, Bizet competed for the prestigious Prix de Rome. His entry was not successful, but nor were any of the others; the musician&#x27;s prize was not awarded that year. After this rebuff, Bizet entered an opera competition which Jacques Offenbach had organised for young composers, with a prize of 1,200 francs. The challenge was to set the one-act libretto of &quot;Le docteur Miracle&quot; by LÃ©on Battu and Ludovic HalÃ©vy. The prize was awarded jointly to Bizet and Charles Lecocq, a compromise which years later Lecocq criticised on the grounds of the jury&#x27;s manipulation by Fromental HalÃ©vy in favour of Bizet. As a result of his success, Bizet became a regular guest at Offenbach&#x27;s Friday evening parties, where among other musicians he met the aged Gioachino Rossini, who presented the young man with a signed photograph. Bizet was a great admirer of Rossini&#x27;s music, and wrote not long after their first meeting that &quot;Rossini is the greatest of them all, because like Mozart, he has all the virtues&quot;.

For his 1857 Prix de Rome entry, Bizet, with Gounod&#x27;s enthusiastic approval, chose to set the cantata &quot;Clovis et Clotilde&quot; by AmÃ©dÃ©e Burion. Bizet was awarded the prize after a ballot of the members of the AcadÃ©mie des Beaux-Arts overturned the judges&#x27; initial decision, which was in favour of the oboist Charles Colin. Under the terms of the award, Bizet received a financial grant for five years, the first two to be spent in Rome, the third in Germany and the final two in Paris. The only other requirement was the submission each year of an &quot;envoi&quot;, a piece of original work to the satisfaction of the AcadÃ©mie. Before his departure for Rome in December 1857, Bizet&#x27;s prize cantata was performed at the AcadÃ©mie to an enthusiastic reception.

===Rome, 1858â1860===

On 27 January 1858, Bizet arrived at the Villa Medici, a 16th-century palace that since 1803 had housed the French AcadÃ©mie in Rome and which he described in a letter home as &quot;paradise&quot;. Under its director, the painter Jean-Victor Schnetz, the villa provided an ideal environment in which Bizet and his fellow-laureates could pursue their artistic endeavours. Bizet relished the convivial atmosphere, and quickly involved himself in the distractions of its social life; in his first six months in Rome, his only composition was a &quot;Te Deum&quot; written for the Rodrigues Prize, a competition for a new religious work open to Prix de Rome winners. This piece failed to impress the judges, who awarded the prize to Adrien Barthe, the only other entrant. Bizet was discouraged to the extent that he vowed to write no more religious music. His &quot;Te Deum&quot; remained forgotten and unpublished until 1971.

Through the winter of 1858â59, Bizet worked on his first envoi, an opera buffa setting of Carlo Cambiaggio&#x27;s libretto &quot;Don Procopio&quot;. Under the terms of his prize, Bizet&#x27;s first envoi was supposed to be a mass, but after his &quot;Te Deum&quot; experience, he was averse to writing religious music. He was apprehensive about how this breach of the rules would be received at the AcadÃ©mie, but their response to &quot;Don Procopio&quot; was initially positive, with praise for the composer&#x27;s &quot;easy and brilliant touch&quot; and &quot;youthful and bold style&quot;.

For his second envoi, not wishing to test the AcadÃ©mie&#x27;s tolerance too far, Bizet proposed to submit a quasi-religious work in the form of a secular mass on a text by Horace. This work, entitled &quot;Carmen Saeculare&quot;, was intended as a song to Apollo and Diana. No trace exists, and it is unlikely that Bizet ever started it. A tendency to conceive ambitious projects, only to quickly abandon them, became a feature of Bizet&#x27;s Rome years; in addition to &quot;Carmen Saeculare&quot;, he considered and discarded at least five opera projects, two attempts at a symphony, and a symphonic ode on the theme of Ulysses and Circe. After &quot;Don Procopio&quot;, Bizet completed only one further work in Rome, the symphonic poem &quot;Vasco da Gama&quot;. This replaced &quot;Carmen Saeculare&quot; as his second envoi, and was well received by the AcadÃ©mie, though swiftly forgotten thereafter.

In the summer of 1859, Bizet and several companions travelled in the mountains and forests around Anagni and Frosinone. They also visited a convict settlement at Anzio; Bizet sent an enthusiastic letter to Marmontel, recounting his experiences. In August, he made an extended journey south to Naples and Pompeii, where he was unimpressed with the former but delighted with the latter: &quot;Here you live with the ancients; you see their temples, their theatres, their houses in which you find their furniture, their kitchen utensils...&quot; Bizet began sketching a symphony based on his Italian experiences, but made little immediate headway; the project, which became his &quot;Roma&quot; symphony, was not finished until 1868. On his return to Rome, Bizet successfully requested permission to extend his stay in Italy into a third year, rather than going to Germany, so that he could complete &quot;an important work&quot; (which has not been identified). In September 1860, while visiting Venice with his friend and fellow-laureate Ernest Guiraud, Bizet received news that his mother was gravely ill in Paris, and made his way home.

===Emergent composer===

====Paris, 1860â1863====

Back in Paris with two years of his grant remaining, Bizet was temporarily secure financially and could ignore for the moment the difficulties that other young composers faced in the city. The two state-subsidised opera houses, the OpÃ©ra and the OpÃ©ra-Comique, each presented traditional repertoires that tended to stifle and frustrate new homegrown talent; only eight of the 54 Prix de Rome laureates between 1830 and 1860 had had works staged at the OpÃ©ra. Although French composers were better represented at the OpÃ©ra-Comique, the style and character of productions had remained largely unchanged since the 1830s. A number of smaller theatres catered for operetta, a field in which Offenbach was then paramount, while the ThÃ©Ã¢tre Italien specialised in second-rate Italian opera. The best prospect for aspirant opera composers was the ThÃ©Ã¢tre Lyrique company which, despite repeated financial crises, operated intermittently in various premises under its resourceful manager LÃ©on Carvalho. This company had staged the first performances of Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; and his &quot;RomÃ©o et Juliette&quot;, and of a shortened version of Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Les Troyens&quot;.

On 13 March 1861, Bizet attended the Paris premiere of Wagner&#x27;s opera &quot;TannhÃ¤user&quot;, a performance greeted by audience riots that were stage-managed by the influential Jockey-Club de Paris. Despite this distraction, Bizet revised his opinions of Wagner&#x27;s music, which he had previously dismissed as merely eccentric. He now declared Wagner &quot;above and beyond all living composers&quot;. Thereafter, accusations of &quot;Wagnerism&quot; were often laid against Bizet, throughout his compositional career.

As a pianist, Bizet had showed considerable skill from his earliest years. A contemporary asserted that he could have assured a future on the concert platform, but chose to conceal his talent &quot;as though it were a vice&quot;. In May 1861 Bizet gave a rare demonstration of his virtuoso skills when, at a dinner party at which Liszt was present, he astonished everyone by playing on sight, flawlessly, one of the maestro&#x27;s most difficult pieces. Liszt commented: &quot;I thought there were only two men able to surmount the difficultiesÂ ... there are three, andÂ ... the youngest is perhaps the boldest and most brilliant.&quot;
Bizet&#x27;s third envoi was delayed for nearly a year by the prolonged illness and death, in September 1861, of his mother. He eventually submitted a trio of orchestral works: an overture entitled &quot;La Chasse d&#x27;Ossian&quot;, a scherzo and a funeral march. The overture has been lost; the scherzo was later absorbed into the &quot;Roma&quot; symphony, and the funeral march music was adapted and used in a later opera. Bizet&#x27;s fourth and final envoi, which occupied him for much of 1862, was a one-act opera, &quot;La guzla de l&#x27;Ã©mir&quot;. As a state-subsidised theatre, the OpÃ©ra-Comique was obliged from time to time to stage the works of Prix de Rome laureates, and &quot;La guzla&quot; duly went into rehearsal in 1863. However, in April Bizet received an offer, which originated from Count Walewski, to compose the music for a three-act opera. This was &quot;Les pÃªcheurs de perles&quot;, based on a libretto by Michel CarrÃ© and EugÃ¨ne Cormon. Because a condition of this offer was that the opera should be the composer&#x27;s first publicly staged work, Bizet hurriedly withdrew &quot;La guzla&quot; from production and incorporated parts of its music into the new opera. The first performance of &quot;Les pÃªcheurs de perles&quot;, by the ThÃ©Ã¢tre Lyrique company, was on 30 September 1863. Critical opinion was generally hostile, though Berlioz praised the work, writing that it &quot;does M. Bizet the greatest honour&quot;. Public reaction was lukewarm, and the opera&#x27;s run ended after 18 performances. It was not performed again until 1886.

In 1862, Bizet had fathered a child with the family&#x27;s housekeeper, Marie Reiter. The boy was brought up to believe that he was Adolphe Bizet&#x27;s child; only on her deathbed in 1913 did Reiter reveal her son&#x27;s true paternity.

====Years of struggle====

When his Prix de Rome grant expired, Bizet found he could not make a living from writing music. He accepted piano pupils and some composition students, two of whom, Edmond Galabert and Paul Lacombe, became his close friends. He also worked as an accompanist at rehearsals and auditions for various staged works, including Berlioz&#x27;s oratorio &quot;L&#x27;enfance du Christ&quot; and Gounod&#x27;s opera &quot;Mireille&quot;. However, his main work in this period was as an arranger of others&#x27; works. He made piano transcriptions for hundreds of operas and other pieces and prepared vocal scores and orchestral arrangements for all kinds of music. He was also, briefly, a music critic for &quot;La Revue Nationale et ÃtrangÃ¨re&quot;, under the assumed name of &quot;Gaston de Betzi&quot;. Bizet&#x27;s single contribution in this capacity appeared on 3 August 1867, after which he quarrelled with the magazine&#x27;s new editor and resigned.

Since 1862, Bizet had been working intermittently on &quot;Ivan IV&quot;, an opera based on the life of Ivan the Terrible. Carvalho failed to deliver on his promise to produce it, so in December 1865, Bizet offered it to the OpÃ©ra, which rejected it; the work remained unperformed until 1946. In July 1866, Bizet signed another contract with Carvalho, for &quot;La jolie fille de Perth&quot;, the libretto for which, by Jules-Henri Vernoy de Saint-Georges after Sir Walter Scott, is described by Bizet&#x27;s biographer Winton Dean as &quot;the worst Bizet was ever called upon to set&quot;. Problems over the casting and other issues delayed its premiere for a year before it was finally performed by the ThÃ©Ã¢tre Lyrique on 26 December 1867. Its press reception was more favourable than that for any of Bizet&#x27;s other operas; &quot;Le MÃ©nestral&#x27;s&quot; critic hailed the second act as &quot;a masterpiece from beginning to end&quot;. Despite the opera&#x27;s success, Carvalho&#x27;s financial difficulties meant a run of only 18 performances.

While &quot;La jolie fille&quot; was in rehearsal, Bizet worked with three other composers, each of whom contributed a single act to a four-act operetta &quot;Marlbrough s&#x27;en va-t-en guerre&quot;. When the work was performed at the ThÃ©Ã¢tre de l&#x27;AthÃ©nÃ©e on 13 December 1867, it was a great success, and the &quot;Revue et Gazette Musicale&#x27;s&quot; critic lavished particular praise on Bizet&#x27;s act: &quot;Nothing could be more stylish, smarter and, at the same time, more distinguished&quot;. Bizet also found time to finish his long-gestating &quot;Roma&quot; symphony and wrote numerous keyboard works and songs. Nevertheless, this period of Bizet&#x27;s life was marked by significant disappointments. At least two projected operas were abandoned with little or no work done. Several competition entries, including a cantata and a hymn composed for the Paris Exhibition of 1867, were unsuccessful. &quot;La Coupe du Roi de ThulÃ©&quot;, his entry for an opera competition, was not placed in the first five; from the fragments of this score that survive, analysts have discerned pre-echoes of &quot;Carmen&quot;. On 28 February 1869, the &quot;Roma&quot; symphony was performed at the Cirque NapolÃ©on, under Jules Pasdeloup. Afterwards, Bizet informed Galabert that on the basis of proportionate applause, hisses, and catcalls, the work was a success.

===Marriage===

Not long after Fromental HalÃ©vy&#x27;s death in 1862, Bizet had been approached on behalf of Mme. HalÃ©vy about completing his old tutor&#x27;s unfinished opera &quot;NoÃ©&quot;. Although no action was taken at that time, Bizet remained on friendly terms with the HalÃ©vy family. Fromental had left two daughters; the elder, Esther, died in 1864, an event which so traumatised Mme. HalÃ©vy that she could not tolerate the company of her younger daughter GeneviÃ¨ve, who from the age of 15 lived with other family members. It is unclear when GeneviÃ¨ve and Bizet became emotionally attached, but in October 1867, he informed Galabert: &quot;I have met an adorable girl whom I love! In two years she will be my wife!&quot; The pair became engaged, although the HalÃ©vy family initially disallowed the match. According to Bizet they considered him an unsuitable catch: &quot;penniless, left-wing, anti-religious and Bohemian&quot;, which Dean observes are odd grounds of objection from &quot;a family bristling with artists and eccentrics&quot;. By summer 1869, their objections had been overcome, and the wedding took place on 3 June 1869. Ludovic HalÃ©vy wrote in his journal: &quot;Bizet has spirit and talent. He &quot;should&quot; succeed&quot;.

As a belated homage to his late father-in-law, Bizet took up the &quot;NoÃ©&quot; manuscript and completed it. Parts of his moribund &quot;Vasco da Gama&quot; and &quot;Ivan IV&quot; were incorporated into the score, but a projected production at the ThÃ©Ã¢tre Lyrique failed to materialise when Carvalho&#x27;s company finally went bankrupt, and &quot;NoÃ©&quot; remained unperformed until 1885. Bizet&#x27;s marriage was initially happy, but was affected by GeneviÃ¨ve&#x27;s nervous instability (inherited from both her parents), her difficult relations with her mother and by Mme. HalÃ©vy&#x27;s interference in the couple&#x27;s affairs. Despite this, Bizet kept on good terms with his mother-in-law and maintained an extensive correspondence with her. In the year following the marriage, he considered plans for at least half a dozen new operas and began to sketch the music for two of them: &quot;Clarissa Harlowe&quot; based on Samuel Richardson&#x27;s novel &quot;Clarissa&quot;, and &quot;GrisÃ©lidis&quot; with a libretto from Victorien Sardou. However, his progress on these projects was brought to a halt in July 1870, with the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War.

===War and upheaval===

After a series of perceived provocations from Prussia, culminating in the offer of the Spanish crown to the Prussian Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern, the French Emperor Napoleon III declared war on 15 July 1870. Initially, this step was supported by an outbreak of patriotic fervour and confident expectations of victory. Bizet, along with other composers and artists, joined the National Guard and began training. He was critical of the antiquated equipment with which he was supposed to fight; his unit&#x27;s guns, he said, were more dangerous to themselves than to the enemy. The national mood was soon depressed by news of successive reverses; at Sedan on 2 September, the French armies suffered an overwhelming defeat; Napoleon was captured and deposed, and the Second Empire came to a sudden end.

Bizet greeted with enthusiasm the proclamation in Paris of the Third Republic. The new government did not sue for peace, and by 17 September, the Prussian armies had surrounded Paris. Unlike Gounod, who fled to England, Bizet rejected opportunities to leave the besieged city: &quot;I can&#x27;t leave Paris! It&#x27;s impossible! It would be quite simply an act of cowardice&quot;, he wrote to Mme HalÃ©vy. Life in the city became frugal and harsh, although, by October, there were efforts to re-establish normality. Pasdeloup resumed his regular Sunday concerts, and on 5 November, the OpÃ©ra reopened with excerpts from works by Gluck, Rossini, and Meyerbeer.

An armistice was signed on 26 January 1871, but the departure of the Prussian troops from Paris in March presaged a period of confusion and civil disturbance. Following an uprising, the city&#x27;s municipal authority was taken over by dissidents who established the Paris Commune. Bizet decided that he was no longer safe in the city, and he and GeneviÃ¨ve escaped to CompiÃ¨gne. Later, they moved to Le VÃ©sinet where they sat out the two months of the Commune, within hearing distance of the gunfire that resounded as government troops gradually crushed the uprising: &quot;The cannons are rumbling with unbelievable violence&quot;, Bizet wrote to his mother-in-law on 12 May.

===Late career===

====&quot;Djamileh&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;ArlÃ©sienne&quot; and &quot;Don Rodrigue&quot;====
As life in Paris returned to normal, in June 1871, Bizet&#x27;s appointment as chorus-master at the OpÃ©ra was seemingly confirmed by its director, Ãmile Perrin. Bizet was due to begin his duties in October, but on 1 November, the post was assumed by Hector Salomon. In her biography of Bizet, Mina Curtiss surmises that he either resigned or refused to take up the position as a protest against what he thought was the director&#x27;s unjustified closing of Ernest Reyer&#x27;s opera &quot;Erostrate&quot; after only two performances. Bizet resumed work on &quot;Clarissa Harlowe&quot; and &quot;GrisÃ©lidis&quot;, but plans for the latter to be staged at the OpÃ©ra-Comique fell through, and neither work was finished; only fragments of their music survive. Bizet&#x27;s other completed works in 1871 were the piano duet entitled &quot;Jeux d&#x27;enfants&quot;, and a one-act opera, &quot;Djamileh&quot;, which opened at the OpÃ©ra-Comique in May 1872. It was poorly staged and incompetently sung; at one point the leading singer missed 32 bars of music. It closed after 11 performances, not to be heard again until 1938. On 10 July GeneviÃ¨ve gave birth to the couple&#x27;s only child, a son, Jacques.
Bizet&#x27;s next major assignment came from Carvalho, who was now managing Paris&#x27; Vaudeville theatre and wanted incidental music for Alphonse Daudet&#x27;s play &quot;L&#x27;ArlÃ©sienne&quot;. When the play opened on 1 October, the music was dismissed by critics as too complex for popular taste. However, encouraged by Reyer and Massenet, Bizet fashioned a four-movement suite from the music, which was performed under Pasdeloup on 10 November to an enthusiastic reception. In the winter of 1872â73, Bizet supervised preparations for a revival of the still-absent Gounod&#x27;s &quot;RomÃ©o et Juliette&quot; at the OpÃ©ra-Comique. Relations between the two had been cool for some years, but Bizet responded positively to his former mentor&#x27;s request for help, writing: &quot;You were the beginning of my life as an artist. I spring from you&quot;.

In June 1872, Bizet informed Galabert: &quot;I have just been ordered to compose three acts for the OpÃ©ra-Comique. [Henri] Meilhac and [Ludovic] HalÃ©vy are doing my piece&quot;. The subject chosen for this project was Prosper MÃ©rimÃ©e&#x27;s short novel, &quot;Carmen&quot;. Bizet began the music in the summer of 1873, but the OpÃ©ra-Comique&#x27;s management was concerned about the suitability of this risquÃ© story for a theatre that generally provided wholesome entertainment, and work was suspended. Bizet then began composing &quot;Don Rodrigue&quot;, an adaptation of the El Cid story by Louis Gallet and Ãdouard Blau. He played a piano version to a select audience that included the OpÃ©ra&#x27;s principal baritone Jean-Baptiste Faure, hoping that the singer&#x27;s approval might influence the directors of the OpÃ©ra to stage the work. However, on the night of 28â29 October, the OpÃ©ra burned to the ground; the directors, amid other pressing concerns, set &quot;Don Rodrigue&quot; aside. It was never completed; Bizet later adapted a theme from its final act as the basis of his 1875 overture, &quot;Patrie&quot;.

====&quot;Carmen&quot;====
Adolphe de Leuven, the co-director of the OpÃ©ra-Comique most bitterly opposed to the &quot;Carmen&quot; project, resigned early in 1874, removing the main barrier to the work&#x27;s production. Bizet finished the score during the summer and was pleased with the outcome: &quot;I have written a work that is all clarity and vivacity, full of colour and melody&quot;. The renowned mezzo-soprano CÃ©lestine Galli-MariÃ© (known professionally as &quot;Galli-MariÃ©&quot;) was engaged to sing the title role. According to Dean, she was as delighted by the part as Bizet was by her suitability for it. There were rumours that he and the singer pursued a brief affair; his relations with GeneviÃ¨ve were strained at this time, and they lived apart for several months.

When rehearsals began in October 1874, the orchestra had difficulties with the score, finding some parts unplayable. The chorus likewise declared some of their music impossible to sing and were dismayed that they had to act as individuals, smoking and fighting onstage rather than merely standing in line. Bizet also had to counter further attempts at the OpÃ©ra-Comique to modify parts of the action which they deemed improper. Only when the leading singers threatened to withdraw from the production did the management give way. Resolving these issues delayed the first night until 3 March 1875 on which morning, by chance, Bizet&#x27;s appointment as a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour was announced.

Among leading musical figures at the premiere were Jules Massenet, Camille Saint-SaÃ«ns, and Charles Gounod. GeneviÃ¨ve, suffering from an abscess in her right eye, was unable to be present. The opera&#x27;s first performance extended to four-and-a-half hours; the final act did not begin until after midnight. Afterwards, Massenet and Saint-SaÃ«ns were congratulatory, Gounod less so. According to one account, he accused Bizet of plagiarism: &quot;Georges has robbed me! Take the Spanish airs and mine out of the score and there remains nothing to Bizet&#x27;s credit but the sauce that masks the fish&quot;. Much of the press comment was negative, expressing consternation that the heroine was an amoral seductress rather than a woman of virtue. Galli-MariÃ©&#x27;s performance was described by one critic as &quot;the very incarnation of vice&quot;. Others complained of a lack of melody and made unfavourable comparisons with the traditional OpÃ©ra-Comique fare of Auber and Boieldieu. LÃ©on Escudier in &quot;L&#x27;Art Musical&quot; called the music &quot;dull and obscureÂ ... the ear grows weary of waiting for the cadence that never comes&quot;. There was, however, praise from the poet ThÃ©odore de Banville, who applauded Bizet for presenting a drama with real men and women instead of the usual OpÃ©ra-Comique &quot;puppets&quot;. The public&#x27;s reaction was lukewarm, and Bizet soon became convinced of its failure: &quot;I foresee a definite and hopeless flop&quot;.

===Illness and death===
For most of his life, Bizet had suffered from a recurrent throat complaint. A heavy smoker, he may have further undermined his health by overwork during the mid-1860s, when he toiled over publishers&#x27; transcriptions for up to 16 hours a day. In 1868, he informed Galabert that he had been very ill with abscesses in the windpipe: &quot;I suffered like a dog&quot;. In 1871, and again in 1874, while completing &quot;Carmen&quot;, he had been disabled by severe bouts of what he described as &quot;throat angina&quot;, and suffered a further attack in late March 1875. At that time, depressed by the evident failure of &quot;Carmen&quot;, Bizet was slow to recover and fell ill again in May. At the end of the month, he went to his holiday home at Bougival and, feeling a little better, went for a swim in the Seine. On the next day, 1 June, he was afflicted by high fever and pain, which was followed by an apparent heart attack. He seemed temporarily to recover, but in the early hours of 3 June, his wedding anniversary, he suffered a fatal second attack. He was 36 years old.

The suddenness of Bizet&#x27;s death, and awareness of his depressed mental state, fuelled rumours of suicide. Although the exact cause of death was never settled with certainty, physicians eventually determined the cause as &quot;a cardiac complication of acute articular rheumatism&quot;. News of the death stunned the Paris musical world, and because Galli-MariÃ© was too upset to appear, that evening&#x27;s performance of &quot;Carmen&quot; was cancelled and replaced with Boieldieu&#x27;s &quot;La dame blanche&quot;.

More than 4,000 people were present at the funeral on 5 June, at the Ãglise de la Sainte-TrinitÃ©, just to the north of the OpÃ©ra. Adolphe Bizet led the mourners, who included Gounod, Thomas, Ludovic HalÃ©vy, LÃ©on HalÃ©vy and Massenet. An orchestra, under Jules Pasdeloup, played &quot;Patrie&quot;, and the organist improvised a fantasy on themes from &quot;Carmen&quot;. At the burial which followed at the PÃ¨re Lachaise Cemetery, Gounod gave the eulogy. He said that Bizet had been struck down just as he was becoming recognised as a true artist. Towards the end of his address, Gounod broke down and was unable to deliver his peroration. After a special performance of &quot;Carmen&quot; at the OpÃ©ra-Comique that night, the press, which had almost universally condemned the piece three months earlier, now declared Bizet a master.

==Music==
===Early works===
Bizet&#x27;s earliest compositions, chiefly songs and keyboard pieces written as exercises, give early indications of his emergent power and his gifts as a melodist. Dean sees evidence in the piano work &quot;Romance sans parole&quot;, written before 1854, of &quot;the conjunction of melody, rhythm and accompaniment&quot; that is characteristic of Bizet&#x27;s mature works. Bizet&#x27;s first orchestral piece was an overture written in 1855 in the manner of Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Guillaume Tell&quot;. Critics have found it unremarkable, but the Symphony in C of the same year has been warmly praised by later commentators who have made favourable comparisons with Mozart and Schubert. In Dean&#x27;s view, the symphony has &quot;few rivals and perhaps no superior in the work of any composer of such youth&quot;. The critic Ernest Newman suggests that Bizet may at this time have thought that his future lay in the field of instrumental music, before an &quot;inner voice&quot; (and the realities of the French musical world) turned him towards the stage.

===Orchestral, piano and vocal works===

After his early Symphony in C, Bizet&#x27;s purely orchestral output is sparse. The &quot;Roma&quot; symphony over which he laboured for more than eight years compares poorly, in Dean&#x27;s view, with its juvenile predecessor. The work, says Dean, owes something to Gounod and contains passages that recall Weber and Mendelssohn. However, Dean contends that the work suffers from poor organisation and an excess of pretentious music; he calls it a &quot;misfire&quot;. Bizet&#x27;s other mature orchestral work, the overture &quot;Patrie&quot;, is similarly dismissed: &quot;an awful warning of the danger of confusing art with patriotism&quot;.

The musicologist Hugh Macdonald argues that Bizet&#x27;s best orchestral music is found in the suites that he derived from the 12-movement &quot;Jeux dâenfants&quot; for piano four-hands (1871) and the &quot;musique de scÃ¨ne&quot; for Daudet&#x27;s play &quot;LâArlÃ©sienne&quot; (1872): &quot;Jeux&quot; resulted in the &quot;Petite suite&quot; of 1873, which has five movements &quot;(MarcheâBerceuseâImpromptuâDuoâGalop)&quot;, while the &quot;musique de scÃ¨ne&quot; resulted in two suites, one from the year of the premiere compiled by Bizet &quot;(PrÃ©ludeâMenuetâAdagiettoâCarillon)&quot; and the other from 1879 compiled posthumously by Guiraud &quot;(PastoraleâIntermezzoâMenuetâFarandole)&quot;. According to Macdonald, in all three Bizet demonstrates a maturity of style that, had he lived longer, might have been the basis for future great orchestral works.

Bizet&#x27;s piano works have not entered the concert pianist&#x27;s repertoire and are generally too difficult for amateurs to attempt. The exception is the above-described &quot;Jeux dâenfants&quot; duet suite; here Bizet avoids the virtuoso passages that so dominate his solo music. The early solo pieces bear the influence of Chopin; later works, such as the &quot;Variations chromatiques&quot; or the &quot;Chasse fantastique&quot;, owe more to Liszt.

Most of Bizet&#x27;s songs were written in the period 1866â68. Dean defines the main weaknesses in these songs as an unimaginative repetition of the same music for each verse, and a tendency to write for the orchestra rather than the voice. Much of Bizet&#x27;s larger-scale vocal music is lost; the early &quot;Te Deum&quot;, which survives in full, is rejected by Dean as &quot;a wretched work [that] merely illustrates Bizet&#x27;s unfitness to write religious music.&quot;

===Dramatic works===

Bizet&#x27;s early one-act opera &quot;Le docteur Miracle&quot; provides the first clear signs of his promise in this genre, its sparkling music including, according to Dean, &quot;many happy touches of parody, scoring and comic characterisation&quot;. Newman perceives evidence of Bizet&#x27;s later achievements in many of his earliest works: &quot;[A]gain and again we light upon some touch or other in them that only a musician with a dramatic root of the matter in him could have achieved.&quot; Until &quot;Carmen&quot;, however, Bizet was not essentially an innovator in the musical theatre. He wrote most of his operas in the traditions of Italian and French opera established by such as Donizetti, Rossini, Berlioz, Gounod, and Thomas. Macdonald suggests that, technically, he surpassed all of these, with a feeling for the human voice that compares with that of Mozart.

In &quot;Don Procopio&quot;, Bizet followed the stock devices of Italian opera as typified by Donizetti in &quot;Don Pasquale&quot;, a work which it closely resembles. However, the familiar idiom is interspersed with original touches in which Bizet&#x27;s fingerprints emerge unmistakably. In his first significant opera, &quot;Les pÃªcheurs de perles&quot;, Bizet was hampered by a dull libretto and a laborious plot; nevertheless, the music in Dean&#x27;s view rises at times &quot;far above the level of contemporary French opera&quot;. Its many original flourishes include the introduction to the cavatina&quot; Comme autrefois dans la nuit sombre&quot; played by two French horns over a cello background, an effect which in the words of analyst HervÃ© Lacombe, &quot;resonates in the memory like a fanfare lost in a distant forest&quot;. While the music of &quot;Les pÃªcheurs&quot; is atmospheric and deeply evocative of the opera&#x27;s Eastern setting, in &quot;La jolie fille de Perth&quot;, Bizet made no attempt to introduce Scottish colour or mood, though the scoring includes highly imaginative touches such as a separate band of woodwind and strings during the opera&#x27;s Act III seduction scene.

From Bizet&#x27;s unfinished works, Macdonald highlights &quot;La coupe du roi de ThulÃ©&quot; as giving clear signs of the power that would reach a pinnacle in &quot;Carmen&quot; and suggests that had &quot;Clarissa Harlowe&quot; and &quot;GrisÃ©lidis&quot; been completed, Bizet&#x27;s legacy would have been &quot;infinitely richer&quot;. As Bizet moved away from the accepted musical conventions of French opera, he encountered critical hostility. In the case of &quot;Djamileh&quot;, the accusation of &quot;Wagnerism&quot; was raised again, as audiences struggled to understand the score&#x27;s originality; many found the music pretentious and monotonous, lacking in both rhythm and melody. By contrast, modern critical opinion as expressed by Macdonald is that &quot;Djamileh&quot; is &quot;a truly enchanting piece, full of inventive touches, especially of chromatic colour.&quot;

Ralph P. Locke, in his study of &quot;Carmen&#x27;s&quot; origins, draws attention to Bizet&#x27;s successful evocation of Andalusian Spain. Grout, in his &quot;History of Western Music&quot;, praises the music&#x27;s extraordinary rhythmic and melodic vitality, and Bizet&#x27;s ability to obtain the maximum dramatic effect in the most economical fashion. Among the opera&#x27;s early champions were Tchaikovsky, Brahms, and particularly Wagner, who commented: &quot;Here, thank God, at last for a change is somebody with ideas in his head.&quot; Another champion of the work was Friedrich Nietzsche, who claimed to know it by heart; &quot;It is music that makes no pretensions to depth, but it is delightful in its simplicity, so unaffected and sincere&quot;. By broad consent, &quot;Carmen&quot; represents the fulfilment of Bizet&#x27;s development as a master of music drama and the culmination of the genre of opÃ©ra comique.

==Legacy==
After Bizet&#x27;s death, many of his manuscripts were lost; works were revised by other hands and published in these unauthorised versions so that it is often difficult to establish what is authentic Bizet. Even &quot;Carmen&quot; was altered into grand opera format by the replacement of its dialogue with recitatives written by Guiraud, and by other amendments to the score. The music world did not immediately acknowledge Bizet as a master and, apart from &quot;Carmen&quot; and the &quot;L&#x27;ArlÃ©sienne&quot; suite, few of his works were performed in the years immediately following his death. However, the 20th century saw increased interest. &quot;Don Procopio&quot; was revived in Monte Carlo in 1906; an Italian version of &quot;Les pÃªcheurs de perles&quot; was performed at the Metropolitan Opera in New York on 13 November 1916, with Caruso in the leading tenor role, and it has since become a staple at many opera houses. After its first performance in Switzerland in 1935, the Symphony in C entered the concert repertory and has been recorded by, among many others, Sir Thomas Beecham. Excerpts from &quot;La coupe du roi de ThulÃ©&quot;, edited by Winton Dean, were broadcast by the BBC on 12 July 1955, and &quot;Le docteur Miracle&quot; was revived in London on 8 December 1957 by the Park Lane Group. &quot;Vasco da Gama&quot; and &quot;Ivan IV&quot; have been recorded, as have numerous songs and the complete piano music. &quot;Carmen&quot;, after its lukewarm initial Paris run of 45 performances, became a worldwide popular success after performances in Vienna (1875) and London (1878). It has been hailed as the first opera of the verismo school, in which sordid and brutal subjects are emphasised, with art reflecting lifeâ&quot;not idealised life but life as actually lived&quot;.

The music critic Harold C. Schonberg surmises that, had Bizet lived, he might have revolutionised French opera; as it is, verismo was taken up mainly by Italians, notably Puccini who, according to Dean, developed the idea &quot;till it became threadbare&quot;. Bizet founded no specific school, though Dean names Chabrier and Ravel as composers influenced by him. Dean also suggests that a fascination with Bizet&#x27;s tragic heroesâFrÃ©dÃ©ri in &quot;L&#x27;ArlÃ©sienne&quot;, JosÃ© in &quot;Carmen&quot;âis reflected in Tchaikovsky&#x27;s late symphonies, particularly the B minor &quot;Pathetique&quot;. Macdonald writes that Bizet&#x27;s legacy is limited by the shortness of his life and by the false starts and lack of focus that persisted until his final five years. &quot;The spectacle of great works unwritten either because Bizet had other distractions, or because no one asked him to write them, or because of his premature death, is infinitely dispiriting, yet the brilliance and the individuality of his best music is unmistakable. It has greatly enriched a period of French music already rich in composers of talent and distinction.&quot;

In Bizet&#x27;s family circle, his father Adolphe died in 1886. Bizet&#x27;s son Jacques killed himself in 1922 after an unhappy love affair. Jean Reiter, Bizet&#x27;s elder son, had a successful career as press director of &quot;Le Temps&quot;, became an Officer of the Legion of Honour, and died in 1939 at the age of 77. In 1886, GeneviÃ¨ve married Ãmile Straus, a rich lawyer; she became a famous Parisian society hostess and a close friend of, among others, Marcel Proust. She showed little interest in her first husband&#x27;s musical legacy, made no effort to catalogue Bizet&#x27;s manuscripts and gave many away as souvenirs. She died in 1926; in her will, she established a fund for a Georges Bizet prize, to be awarded annually to a composer under 40 who had &quot;produced a remarkable work within the previous five years&quot;. Winners of the prize include Tony Aubin, Jean-Michel Damase, Henri Dutilleux, and Jean Martinon.

<doc id="67958" wikidata="Q1278" url="?curid=67958" title="Copernicium">
<text>Copernicium is a synthetic chemical element; it has symbol Cn and atomic number 112. Its known isotopes are extremely radioactive, and have only been created in a laboratory. The most stable known isotope, copernicium-285, has a half-life of approximately 30 seconds. Copernicium was first created in February 1996 by the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research near Darmstadt, Germany. It was named after the astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus on his 537th anniversary.

In the periodic table of the elements, copernicium is a d-block transactinide element and a group 12 element. During reactions with gold, it has been shown to be an extremely volatile element, so much so that it is possibly a gas or a volatile liquid at standard temperature and pressure.

Copernicium is calculated to have several properties that differ from its lighter homologues in group 12, zinc, cadmium and mercury; due to relativistic effects, it may give up its 6d electrons instead of its 7s ones, and it may have more similarities to the noble gases such as radon rather than its group 12 homologues. Calculations indicate that copernicium may show the oxidation state +4, while mercury shows it in only one compound of disputed existence and zinc and cadmium do not show it at all. It has also been predicted to be more difficult to oxidize copernicium from its neutral state than the other group 12 elements. Predictions vary on whether solid copernicium would be a metal, semiconductor, or insulator. Copernicium is one of the heaviest elements whose chemical properties have been experimentally investigated.

==Introduction==
==History==

===Discovery===
Copernicium was first created on 9 February 1996, at the Gesellschaft fÃ¼r Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Darmstadt, Germany, by Sigurd Hofmann, Victor Ninov et al. This element was created by firing accelerated zinc-70 nuclei at a target made of lead-208 nuclei in a heavy ion accelerator. A single atom of copernicium was produced with a mass number of 277. (A second was originally reported, but was found to have been based on data fabricated by Ninov, and was thus retracted.)

:Pb + Zn â Cn* â Cn + n

In May 2000, the GSI successfully repeated the experiment to synthesize a further atom of copernicium-277.
This reaction was repeated at RIKEN using the Search for a Super-Heavy Element Using a Gas-Filled Recoil Separator set-up in 2004 and 2013 to synthesize three further atoms and confirm the decay data reported by the GSI team. This reaction had also previously been tried in 1971 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia to aim for 276Cn (produced in the 2n channel), but without success.

The IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party (JWP) assessed the claim of copernicium&#x27;s discovery by the GSI team in 2001 and 2003. In both cases, they found that there was insufficient evidence to support their claim. This was primarily related to the contradicting decay data for the known nuclide rutherfordium-261. However, between 2001 and 2005, the GSI team studied the reaction 248Cm(26Mg,5n)269Hs, and were able to confirm the decay data for hassium-269 and rutherfordium-261. It was found that the existing data on rutherfordium-261 was for an isomer, now designated rutherfordium-261m.

In May 2009, the JWP reported on the claims of discovery of elementÂ 112 again and officially recognized the GSI team as the discoverers of element 112. This decision was based on the confirmation of the decay properties of daughter nuclei as well as the confirmatory experiments at RIKEN.

Work had also been done at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia from 1998 to synthesise the heavier isotope 283Cn in the hot fusion reaction 238U(48Ca,3n)283Cn; most observed atoms of 283Cn decayed by spontaneous fission, although an alpha decay branch to 279Ds was detected. While initial experiments aimed to assign the produced nuclide with its observed long half-life of 3Â minutes based on its chemical behaviour, this was found to be not mercury-like as would have been expected (copernicium being under mercury in the periodic table), and indeed now it appears that the long-lived activity might not have been from 283Cn at all, but its electron capture daughter 283Rg instead, with a shorter 4-second half-life associated with 283Cn. (Another possibility is assignment to a metastable isomeric state, 283mCn.) While later cross-bombardments in the 242Pu+48Ca and 245Cm+48Ca reactions succeeded in confirming the properties of 283Cn and its parents 287Fl and 291Lv, and played a major role in the acceptance of the discoveries of flerovium and livermorium (elements 114 and 116) by the JWP in 2011, this work originated subsequent to the GSI&#x27;s work on 277Cn and priority was assigned to the GSI.

===Naming===

Using Mendeleev&#x27;s nomenclature for unnamed and undiscovered elements, copernicium should be known as &quot;eka-mercury&quot;. In 1979, IUPAC published recommendations according to which the element was to be called &quot;ununbium&quot; (with the corresponding symbol of &quot;Uub&quot;), a systematic element name as a placeholder, until the element was discovered (and the discovery then confirmed) and a permanent name was decided on. Although widely used in the chemical community on all levels, from chemistry classrooms to advanced textbooks, the recommendations were mostly ignored among scientists in the field, who either called it &quot;element 112&quot;, with the symbol of &quot;E112&quot;, &quot;(112)&quot;, or even simply &quot;112&quot;.

After acknowledging the GSI team&#x27;s discovery, the IUPAC asked them to suggest a permanent name for element 112. On 14 July 2009, they proposed &quot;copernicium&quot; with the element symbol Cp, after Nicolaus Copernicus &quot;to honor an outstanding scientist, who changed our view of the world&quot;.

During the standard six-month discussion period among the scientific community about the naming,
it was pointed out that the symbol &quot;Cp&quot; was previously associated with the name &quot;cassiopeium&quot; (cassiopium), now known as lutetium (Lu). Moreover, Cp is frequently used today to mean the cyclopentadienyl ligand (C5H5). Primarily because cassiopeium (Cp) was (until 1949) accepted by IUPAC as an alternative allowed name for lutetium, the IUPAC disallowed the use of Cp as a future symbol, prompting the GSI team to put forward the symbol Cn as an alternative. On 19 February 2010, the 537th anniversary of Copernicus&#x27; birth, IUPAC officially accepted the proposed name and symbol.
==Isotopes==
Copernicium has no stable or naturally occurring isotopes. Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory, either by fusing two atoms or by observing the decay of heavier elements. Eight different isotopes have been reported with mass numbers 277 and 280â286, and one unconfirmed metastable isomer in 285Cn has been reported. Most of these decay predominantly through alpha decay, but some undergo spontaneous fission, and copernicium-283 may have an electron capture branch.

The isotope copernicium-283 was instrumental in the confirmation of the discoveries of the elements flerovium and livermorium.

===Half-lives===
All confirmed copernicium isotopes are extremely unstable and radioactive; in general, heavier isotopes are more stable than the lighter, and isotopes with an odd neutron number have relatively longer half-lives due to additional hindrance against spontaneous fission. The most stable known isotope, 285Cn, has a half-life of 30Â seconds; 283Cn has a half-life of 4Â seconds, and the unconfirmed 285mCn and 286Cn have half-lives of about 15 and 8.45Â seconds respectively. Other isotopes have half-lives shorter than oneÂ second. 281Cn and 284Cn both have half-lives on the order of 0.1Â seconds, and the remaining isotopes have half-lives shorter than one millisecond. It is predicted that the heavy isotopes 291Cn and 293Cn may have half-lives longer than a few decades, for they are predicted to lie near the center of the theoretical island of stability, and may have been produced in the r-process and be detectable in cosmic rays, though they would be about 10â12 times as abundant as lead.

The lightest isotopes of copernicium have been synthesized by direct fusion between two lighter nuclei and as decay products (except for 277Cn, which is not known to be a decay product), while the heavier isotopes are only known to be produced by decay of heavier nuclei. The heaviest isotope produced by direct fusion is 283Cn; the three heavier isotopes, 284Cn, 285Cn, and 286Cn, have only been observed as decay products of elements with larger atomic numbers.

In 1999, American scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, announced that they had succeeded in synthesizing three atoms of 293Og. These parent nuclei were reported to have successively emitted three alpha particles to form copernicium-281 nuclei, which were claimed to have undergone alpha decay, emitting alpha particles with decay energy 10.68Â MeV and half-life 0.90Â ms, but their claim was retracted in 2001 as it had been based on data fabricated by Ninov. This isotope was truly produced in 2010 by the same team; the new data contradicted the previous fabricated data.

The missing isotopes 278Cn and 279Cn are too heavy to be produced by cold fusion and too light to be produced by hot fusion. They might be filled from above by decay of heavier elements produced by hot fusion, and indeed 280Cn and 281Cn were produced this way. The isotopes 286Cn and 287Cn could be produced by charged-particle evaporation, in the reaction 244Pu(48Ca,Î±&quot;x&quot;n) with &quot;x&quot; equalling 1 or 2.

==Predicted properties==
Very few properties of copernicium or its compounds have been measured; this is due to its extremely limited and expensive production and the fact that copernicium (and its parents) decays very quickly. A few singular chemical properties have been measured, as well as the boiling point, but properties of the copernicium metal remain generally unknown and for the most part, only predictions are available.

===Chemical===
Copernicium is the tenth and last member of the 6d series and is the heaviest group 12 element in the periodic table, below zinc, cadmium and mercury. It is predicted to differ significantly from the lighter groupÂ 12 elements. The valence s-subshells of the group 12 elements and period 7 elements are expected to be relativistically contracted most strongly at copernicium. This and the closed-shell configuration of copernicium result in it probably being a very noble metal. A standard reduction potential of +2.1Â V is predicted for the Cn2+/Cn couple. Copernicium&#x27;s predicted first ionization energy of 1155Â kJ/mol almost matches that of the noble gas xenon at 1170.4Â kJ/mol. Copernicium&#x27;s metallic bonds should also be very weak, possibly making it extremely volatile like the noble gases, and potentially making it gaseous at room temperature. However, it should be able to form metalâmetal bonds with copper, palladium, platinum, silver, and gold; these bonds are predicted to be only about 15â20Â kJ/mol weaker than the analogous bonds with mercury. In opposition to the earlier suggestion, ab initio calculations at the high level of accuracy predicted that the chemistry of singly-valent copernicium resembles that of mercury rather than that of the noble gases. The latter result can be explained by the huge spinâorbit interaction which significantly lowers the energy of the vacant 7p1/2 state of copernicium.

Once copernicium is ionized, its chemistry may present several differences from those of zinc, cadmium, and mercury. Due to the stabilization of 7s electronic orbitals and destabilization of 6d ones caused by relativistic effects, Cn2+ is likely to have a [Rn]5f146d87s2 electronic configuration, using the 6d orbitals before the 7s one, unlike its homologues. The fact that the 6d electrons participate more readily in chemical bonding means that once copernicium is ionized, it may behave more like a transition metal than its lighter homologues, especially in the possible +4 oxidation state. In aqueous solutions, copernicium may form the +2 and perhaps +4 oxidation states. The diatomic ion , featuring mercury in the +1 oxidation state, is well-known, but the ion is predicted to be unstable or even non-existent. Copernicium(II) fluoride, CnF2, should be more unstable than the analogous mercury compound, mercury(II) fluoride (HgF2), and may even decompose spontaneously into its constituent elements. As the most electronegative reactive element, fluorine may be the only element able to oxidise copernicium even further to the +4 and even +6 oxidation states in CnF4 and CnF6; the latter may require matrix-isolation conditions to be detected, as in the disputed detection of HgF4. CnF4 should be more stable than CnF2. In polar solvents, copernicium is predicted to preferentially form the and anions rather than the analogous neutral fluorides (CnF4 and CnF2, respectively), although the analogous bromide or iodide ions may be more stable towards hydrolysis in aqueous solution. The anions and should also be able to exist in aqueous solution. The formation of thermodynamically stable copernicium(II) and (IV) fluorides would be analogous to the chemistry of xenon. Analogous to mercury(II) cyanide (Hg(CN)2), copernicium is expected to form a stable cyanide, Cn(CN)2.

===Physical and atomic===
Copernicium should be a dense metal, with a density of 14.0Â g/cm3 in the liquid state at 300Â K; this is similar to the known density of mercury, which is 13.534Â g/cm3. (Solid copernicium at the same temperature should have a higher density of 14.7Â g/cm3.) This results from the effects of copernicium&#x27;s higher atomic weight being cancelled out by its larger interatomic distances compared to mercury. Some calculations predicted copernicium to be a gas at room temperature due to its closed-shell electron configuration, which would make it the first gaseous metal in the periodic table. A 2019 calculation agrees with these predictions on the role of relativistic effects, suggesting that copernicium will be a volatile liquid bound by dispersion forces under standard conditions. Its melting point is estimated at and its boiling point at , the latter in agreement with the experimentally estimated value of . The atomic radius of copernicium is expected to be around 147Â pm. Due to the relativistic stabilization of the 7s orbital and destabilization of the 6d orbital, the Cn+ and Cn2+ ions are predicted to give up 6d electrons instead of 7s electrons, which is the opposite of the behavior of its lighter homologues.

In addition to the relativistic contraction and binding of the 7s subshell, the 6d5/2 orbital is expected to be destabilized due to spinâorbit coupling, making it behave similarly to the 7s orbital in terms of size, shape, and energy. Predictions of the expected band structure of copernicium are varied. Calculations in 2007 expected that copernicium may be a semiconductor with a band gap of around 0.2Â eV, crystallizing in the hexagonal close-packed crystal structure. However, calculations in 2017 and 2018 suggested that copernicium should be a noble metal at standard conditions with a body-centered cubic crystal structure: it should hence have no band gap, like mercury, although the density of states at the Fermi level is expected to be lower for copernicium than for mercury. 2019 calculations then suggested that in fact copernicium has a large band gap of 6.4 Â± 0.2Â eV, which should be similar to that of the noble gas radon (predicted as 7.1Â eV) and would make it an insulator; bulk copernicium is predicted by these calculations to be bound mostly by dispersion forces, like the noble gases. Like mercury, radon, and flerovium, but not oganesson (eka-radon), copernicium is calculated to have no electron affinity.

==Experimental atomic gas phase chemistry==
Interest in copernicium&#x27;s chemistry was sparked by predictions that it would have the largest relativistic effects in the whole of periodÂ 7 and groupÂ 12, and indeed among all 118 known elements. Copernicium is expected to have the ground state electron configuration [Rn] 5f14 6d10 7s2 and thus should belong to groupÂ 12 of the periodic table, according to the Aufbau principle. As such, it should behave as the heavier homologue of mercury and form strong binary compounds with noble metals like gold. Experiments probing the reactivity of copernicium have focused on the adsorption of atoms of elementÂ 112 onto a gold surface held at varying temperatures, in order to calculate an adsorption enthalpy. Owing to relativistic stabilization of the 7s electrons, copernicium shows radon-like properties. Experiments were performed with the simultaneous formation of mercury and radon radioisotopes, allowing a comparison of adsorption characteristics.

The first chemical experiments on copernicium were conducted using the 238U(48Ca,3n)283Cn reaction. Detection was by spontaneous fission of the claimed parent isotope with half-life of 5Â minutes. Analysis of the data indicated that copernicium was more volatile than mercury and had noble gas properties. However, the confusion regarding the synthesis of copernicium-283 has cast some doubt on these experimental results. Given this uncertainty, between AprilâMay 2006 at the JINR, a FLNRâPSI team conducted experiments probing the synthesis of this isotope as a daughter in the nuclear reaction 242Pu(48Ca,3n)287Fl. (The 242Pu + 48Ca fusion reaction has a slightly larger cross-section than the 238U + 48Ca reaction, so that the best way to produce copernicium for chemical experimentation is as an overshoot product as the daughter of flerovium.) In this experiment, two atoms of copernicium-283 were unambiguously identified and the adsorption properties were interpreted to show that copernicium is a more volatile homologue of mercury, due to formation of a weak metal-metal bond with gold. This agrees with general indications from some relativistic calculations that copernicium is &quot;more or less&quot; homologous to mercury. However, it was pointed out in 2019 that this result may simply be due to strong dispersion interactions.

In April 2007, this experiment was repeated and a further three atoms of copernicium-283 were positively identified. The adsorption property was confirmed and indicated that copernicium has adsorption properties in agreement with being the heaviest member of group 12. These experiments also allowed the first experimental estimation of copernicium&#x27;s boiling point: 84Â Â°C, so that it may be a gas at standard conditions.

Because the lighter group 12 elements often occur as chalcogenide ores, experiments were conducted in 2015 to deposit copernicium atoms on a selenium surface to form copernicium selenide, CnSe. Reaction of copernicium atoms with trigonal selenium to form a selenide was observed, with -Î&quot;H&quot;adsCn(t-Se) &gt; 48Â kJ/mol, with the kinetic hindrance towards selenide formation being lower for copernicium than for mercury. This was unexpected as the stability of the group 12 selenides tends to decrease down the group from ZnSe to HgSe.

<text>King Wallis Vidor ( ; February 8, 1894 â November 1, 1982) was an American film director, film producer, and screenwriter whose 67-year film-making career successfully spanned the silent and sound eras. His works are distinguished by a vivid, humane, and sympathetic depiction of contemporary social issues. Considered an director, Vidor approached multiple genres and allowed the subject matter to determine the style, often pressing the limits of film-making conventions.

His most acclaimed and successful film in the silent era was &quot;The Big Parade&quot; (1925). Vidor&#x27;s sound films of the 1940s and early 1950s arguably represent his richest output. Among his finest works are &quot;Northwest Passage&quot; (1940), &quot;Comrade X&quot; (1940), &quot;An American Romance&quot; (1944), and &quot;Duel in the Sun&quot; (1946). His dramatic depictions of the American western landscape endow nature with a sinister force where his characters struggle for survival and redemption.

Vidor&#x27;s earlier films tend to identify with the common people in a collective struggle, whereas his later works place individualists at the center of his narratives.

He was considered an &quot;actors&#x27; director&quot;: many of his players received Academy Award nominations or awards, among them Wallace Beery, Robert Donat, Barbara Stanwyck, Jennifer Jones, Anne Shirley, and Lillian Gish.

Vidor was nominated five times by the Academy Awards for Best Director. In 1979, he was awarded an Honorary Academy Award for his &quot;incomparable achievements as a cinematic creator and innovator.&quot; Additionally, he won eight national and international film awards during his career, including the Screen Directors Guild Lifetime Achievement Award in 1957.

In 1962, he was head of the jury at the 12th Berlin International Film Festival. In 1969, he was a member of the jury at the 6th Moscow International Film Festival.

==Early life and career==
Vidor was born into a well-to-do family in Galveston, Texas, the son of Kate (nÃ©e Wallis) and Charles Shelton Vidor, a lumber importer and mill owner. His grandfather, KÃ¡roly Charles Vidor, was a refugee of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, who settled in Galveston in the early 1850s. Vidor&#x27;s mother, Kate Wallis, of Scotch-English descent, was a relative of the second wife of noted frontiersman and politician Davy Crockett. The &quot;King&quot; in King Vidor is no sobriquet, but his given name in honor of his mother&#x27;s favorite brother, King Wallis.

At the age of six, Vidor witnessed the devastation of the Galveston Hurricane of 1900. Based on that formative experience, he published a historical memoir of the disaster titled &quot;Southern Storm&quot; for the May 1935 issue of &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine. In an interview with the Directors Guild of America (DGA) in 1980 Vidor recalled the horrors of the hurricane&#x27;s effects:

Near the end of production for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&#x27;s &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, Vidor was called in to direct the remaining scenes set in Kansas. His contributions include the cyclone sequence and the musical number, &quot;Over the Rainbow.&quot;

Vidor was introduced to Mary Baker Eddy&#x27;s Christian Science by his mother at a very early age. Vidor would endow his films with the moral precepts of the faith, a &quot;blend of pragmatic self-help and religious mysticism.&quot;

Vidor attended grade school at the Peacock Military Academy, located in San Antonio, Texas.

==Amateur apprenticeship in Galveston==
As a boy, Vidor engaged in photographing and developing portraits of his relatives with a Box Brownie camera.

At the age of sixteen Vidor dropped out of a private high school in Maryland and returned to Galveston to work as a nickelodeon ticket taker and projectionist. As an 18-year-old amateur newsreel cameraman Vidor began to acquire skills as a film documentarian. His first movie was based on footage taken of a local hurricane (not to be confused with the 1900 Galveston hurricane). He sold footage from a Houston army parade to a newsreel outfit (titled &quot;The Grand Military Parade&quot;) and made his first fictional movie, a semi-docucomedy concerning a local automobile race, &quot;In Tow&quot; (1913).

==Hotex Motion Picture Company==
Vidor, in a partnership with vaudevillian and movie entrepreneur Edward Sedgwick formed the Hotex Motion Picture Company in 1914 (&quot;HO&quot; for Houston, &quot;TEX&quot; for Texas) to produce low-budget one- or two-reelers. The enterprise garnered a national press release in Moving Picture World announcing its formation. Only still photos survive from these comedy-adventures, for which Hotex failed to collect any royalties.

In 1915, newlyweds Vidor and actress Florence Arto Vidor along with business partner Sedgwick, moved to California in search of employment in the emerging Hollywood movie industry, arriving on the West Coast virtually penniless.

==Hollywood apprenticeship: 1915â1918==
Based on a screen test arranged by Texas actress Corinne Griffith and shot by Charles Rosher in Hollywood, Florence Vidor procured a contract with Vitagraph Studios, marking the start of her successful movie career. Vidor obtained minor roles acting at Vitagraph and Inceville studios (the spy drama &quot;The Intrigue&quot; (1916) survives, in which he plays a chauffeur). As a low-level office clerk at Universal, he was fired for trying to present his own scripts under the pseudonym &quot;Charles K. Wallis&quot;, but soon was rehired by the studio as a writer of shorts.

===Judge Willis Brown series===
Beginning in 1915, Vidor served as screenwriter and director on a series of shorts about the rehabilitation of juvenile delinquents by social reformer Judge Willis Brown. Written and produced by Brown, Vidor filmed ten of the 20-film series, a project in which Vidor declared he had &quot;deeply believed&quot;. A single reel from &quot;Bud&#x27;s Recruit&quot; is known to survive, the earliest extant footage from Vidor&#x27;s film directing career.

===Brentwood Film Corporation and the &quot;Preachment&quot; films, 1918â1919===
In 1918, at the age of 24, Vidor directed his first Hollywood feature, &quot;The Turn in the Road&quot; (1919), a film presentation of a Christian Science evangelical tract sponsored by a group of doctors and dentists affiliated as the independent Brentwood Film Corporation. Vidor recalls of his first foray into Hollywood film-making:

Vidor would make three more films for the Brentwood Corporation, all of which featured as yet unknown comedienne Zasu Pitts, who the director had discovered on a Hollywood streetcar. The films &quot;Better Times&quot;, &quot;The Other Half&quot;, and &quot;Poor Relations&quot;, all completed in 1919, also featured future film director David Butler and starred Vidor&#x27;s then wife Florence Arto Vidor (married in 1915), a rising actor in Hollywood pictures. Vidor ended his association with the Brentwood group in 1920.

===&quot;Vidor Village&quot; and First National Exhibitors, 1920â1925===

King Vidor next embarked on a major project in collaboration with a New York-based film exhibitor First National. In a bid to compete with the increasingly dominant Hollywood studios, First National advanced Vidor funding to build a small film production facility in Santa Monica, California, dubbed &quot;Vidor Village&quot;. King Vidor issued a founding statement entitled &quot;Creed and Pledge&quot; that set forth moral anodynes for film-making, inspired by his Christian Science sympathies.

His &quot;manifesto&quot; was carried in &quot;Variety&quot; magazine&#x27;s January 1920 issue.

The first production from Vidor Village was his &quot;The Jack Knife Man&quot; (1920), a bleak and bitter story of an orphaned boy raised by an impoverished yet kindly hermit, performed by former stage actor Fred Turner. The recluse achieves financial success and is ultimately rewarded with the affection of a hard-nosed but soft-hearted widow, played by Lillian Leighton. Redolent with the precepts of the &quot;Creed and Pledge&quot;, the film&#x27;s &quot;relentless realism&quot; did not please the executives at First National. They demanded entertainment that would garner a mass share of box-office receipts so as to fill their theaters.

As film critic and biographer John Baxter observed: &quot;[t]his experience had a fundamental effect on Vidor&#x27;s attitude toward film-making.&quot; Under pressure &quot;as the studio system began to harden into place&quot;, the 26-year-old Vidor began to craft his films to conform to prevailing standards of the period. His 1920 film &quot;The Family Honor&quot; exemplifies this shift towards romantic comedies and away from the ideals that had informed &quot;The Jack Knife Man&quot;.

Vidor&#x27;s &quot;The Sky Pilot&quot; (1921) was a big-budget western-comedy shot on location in the high Sierra Nevada of California. John Bowers stars as the intrepid preacher and Colleen Moore (soon to be famous as the quintessential Hollywood &quot;flapper&quot;) as the girl he loved and rescued from a deadly cattle stampede. The natural landscapes serve as an essential dramatic component in the film, as they would in subsequent Vidor movies. The cost overruns cut into First National profits, and they declined to fund any further Vidor projects.

Vidor and Moore would begin a three-year romance on the set of &quot;The Sky Pilot&quot; that became &quot;a Hollywood legend&quot;. The couple would resume their relationship after 40 years (in 1963), remaining close until Vidor&#x27;s death in 1982.

&quot;Love Never Dies&quot; (1921) is a &quot;rural love story&quot; with a spectacular disaster scene depicting a locomotive and box cars derailing and plunging into a river below. The dramatic presentation of rivers served as a standard motif in Vidor films. Impressed with this Vidor sequence, producer Thomas H. Ince helped to finance the picture.

In 1922, Vidor produced and directed films that served as vehicles for his spouse, Florence Vidor, notable only for their &quot;artificiality&quot;. These works conformed to the comedies of manners and romantic melodramas that were typical of his contemporary, Cecil B. DeMille at Famous PlayersâLasky studios. Later, Vidor admitted to being overawed by DeMille&#x27;s talents. Florence Vidor, in her later career, frequently starred in DeMille productions.

Vidor&#x27;s next picture, &quot;Conquering the Woman&quot;, was an unabashed imitation of DeMille&#x27;s outstanding drama &quot;Male and Female&quot; (1919), starring Gloria Swanson. Vidor followed up with &quot;Woman, Wake Up&quot; and &quot;The Real Adventure&quot; (both 1922) and each depicting a female struggling successfully to assert herself in a male dominated world. As such, these may be considered as early examples of feminist-oriented cinema, but with entirely conventional endings.

By the early 1920s, Florence Vidor had emerged as a major film star in her own right and wished to pursue her career independent of her spouse. The couple divorced in 1926, and shortly thereafter Florence married violinist Jascha Heifetz. Vidor would soon marry model and future film actress Eleanor Boardman.

Vidor Village went bankrupt in 1922 and Vidor, now without a studio, offered his services to the top executives in the film industry.

==Metro and &quot;Peg o&#x27; My Heart&quot; (1922)==
Film producer Louis B. Mayer engaged Vidor to direct Broadway actress Laurette Taylor in a film version of her famous juvenile role as Peg O&#x27;Connell in &quot;Peg o&#x27; My Heart&quot;, written by her husband J. Hartley Manners. Despite viewing screen tests supplied by director D. W. Griffth, Vidor was anxious that the aging Taylor (born 1884) would not be convincing as her 18-year-old stage character on screen. Biographer Marguerite Courtney describes their first encounter:

The process of adapting the stage version to film was nevertheless fraught with difficulties, complicated by a romantic attachment between director and star. The final product proved cinematically &quot;lifeless&quot;.

Pleased with &quot;Peg o&#x27; My Heart&quot; box-office receipts, Mayer matched Vidor and Taylor again, resulting in a second feature film success, &quot;Happiness&quot; (1923) also written by Manners, with Taylor playing a charming Pollyanna-like character. The film would mark Vidor&#x27;s final collaboration with the couple.

Next, Vidor was entrusted to direct Mayer&#x27;s top female star Clara Kimball Young in &quot;The Woman of Bronze&quot;, a 1923 melodrama that resembled the formulaic films he had created with Florence Vidor at Vidor Village.

== Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM): 1923â1944 ==

=== Silent era: 1923â1928 ===

Vidor&#x27;s yeoman service to Louis B. Mayer secured him entrÃ©e into Goldwyn Pictures in 1923, a holding soon to be amalgamated with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Samuel Goldwyn and other film producers of the early 1920s favored &quot;literary&quot; texts as the basis for movie screenplays. Parvenu-rich movie executives wished to provide a patina of class or &quot;tone&quot; to an industry often regarded as vulgar and cash-driven.

Vidor was content to adapt these &quot;prestigious properties&quot; so securing his reputation as a reliable studio asset. His work during this period did not rise to the level of his later work, but a few films stand out. &quot;Wild Oranges&quot; (1924), from a story by Joseph Hergesheimer, is notable as a harbinger of his best work in the sound era. The natural features of the coastal regions of Georgia are endowed with sinister and homicidal potential, where a fugitive arrives to terrorize rural residents. As such, the film exhibits Vidor&#x27;s trademark use of nature to symbolize aspects of the human conflict.

==== Vidor and the John Gilbert collaborations: 1925â1926 ====

Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&#x27;s cast of rising movie stars included soon-to-be matinee idol John Gilbert. Vidor directed him in &quot;His Hour&quot; (1924), based on an Elinor Glyn &quot;febrile romance&quot;, and is one of the few films from Vidor&#x27;s output of that period to survive. Gilbert, as the Russian nobleman Prince Gritzko, was so ardently performed as co-star Aileen Pringle&#x27;s seducer that one scene was deleted.

Vidor&#x27;s typically &quot;routine&quot; movies of this period include &quot;Wine of Youth&quot; (1924) and &quot;Proud Flesh&quot; (1925) emphasize the &quot;time-honored virtues&quot; of familial and matrimonial loyalty, even among the liberated Jazz Age flappers.
King Vidor&#x27;s tenure as a studio stringer was at an end. His next feature would transform his career and have a resounding impact on the late silent film era: &quot;The Big Parade&quot;.

== A silent-era magnum opus: &quot;The Big Parade&quot;: 1925 ==

In 1925 Vidor directed &quot;The Big Parade&quot;, among the most acclaimed films of the silent era, and a tremendous commercial success. &quot;The Big Parade&quot;, a war romance starring John Gilbert, established Vidor as one of MGM&#x27;s top studio directors for the next decade. The film would influence contemporary directors G. W. Pabst in &quot;Westfront 1918&quot; and Lewis Milestone in &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot;, both 1930. Producer Irving Thalberg arranged for Vidor to film two more Gilbert vehicles: &quot;La BohÃ¨me&quot; and &quot;Bardelys the Magnificent&quot;, both released in 1926. In &quot;La BohÃ¨me&quot;, a film of &quot;great and enduring merit&quot;, leading lady Lillian Gish exerted considerable control over the film&#x27;s production. &quot;Bardelys the Magnificent,&quot; a picaresque swashbuckler mimicked the films of Douglas Fairbanks. Vidor would spoof the movie on his own &quot;Show People&quot; (1928) with comedienne Marion Davies.

Vidor&#x27;s next film would be a startling departure from romantic entertainment to an exposure of the &quot;cruel deception of the American dream&quot;.

=== &quot;The Crowd&quot; (1928) and cinematic populism ===
In the late 1920s European films, especially from German directors, exerted a strong influence on filmmakers internationally. Vidor&#x27;s &quot;The Crowd &quot; resonates with these populist films, a &quot;pitiless study&quot; of a young working man&#x27;s descent into isolation and loss of morale who is ultimately crushed by the urban &quot;assembly line&quot;, while his wife struggles to maintain some order in their relationship. Though the most uncharacteristic of Vidor&#x27;s pictures, it was his personal favorite: the picture, he said &quot;came out of my guts.&quot;

Employing relatively unknown actors, the film had modest box office success, but was widely praised by critics. In 1928, Vidor received an Oscar nomination, and his first for Best Director. M-G-M executives, who had been content to allow Vidor an &quot;experimental&quot; film found that bleak social outlook of &quot;The Crowd&quot; troubling â reflected in their one-year delay in releasing the film. &quot;The Crowd&quot; has since been recognized as one of the &quot;masterpieces&quot; of the late silent era.

=== The Marion Davies comedies, 1928â1930 ===

Cosmopolitan Pictures, a subsidiary of M-G-M studios and controlled by influential newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst, insisted that Vidor direct Marion Davies â Hearst&#x27;s longtime mistress â in these Cosmopolitan-supervised films, to which Vidor acquiesced. Though not identified as a director of comedies, Vidor filmed three &quot;&quot;screwball&quot;-like comedies that revealed Davies talents with her &quot;drive-you-to-distraction persona&quot;.

&quot;The Patsy&quot;, a comedy of manners, brought Marie Dressler and Dell Henderson, veterans of Mack Sennett &quot;slapstick&quot; era out of retirement to play Davies&#x27; farcical upper-class parents. Davies performs a number of amusing celebrity imitations she was known for at social gatherings at Hearst&#x27;s San Simeon estate, including Gloria Swanson, Lillian Gish, Pola Negri and Mae Murray.
The scenario for &quot;Show People&quot; (1928) was inspired by the glamorous Gloria Swanson, who began her film career in slapstick. Davis&#x27; character Peggy Pepper, a mere comic, is elevated to the high-style star Patricia Pepoire. Vidor spoofs his own recently completed &quot;Bardelys the Magnificent&quot; (1926), an over-the-top swashbuckling costume drama featuring romantic icon John Gilbert. Some of the best-known film stars of the silent era appeared in cameos, as well as Vidor himself. &quot;Show People&quot; remains the enduring picture of the VidorâDavies collaborations.
Vidor&#x27;s third and final film with Davies was his second sound film (after &quot;Hallelujah&quot; (1929)): &quot;Not So Dumb&quot; (1930), adapted from the 1921 Broadway comedy &quot;Dulcy&quot; by George S. Kaufman. The limitations of early sound, despite recent innovations, interfered with the continuity of Davies&#x27; performance that had enlivened her earlier silent comedies with Vidor.

=== Early sound era: 1929â1937 ===
In early 1928, Vidor and his spouse Eleanor Boardman were visiting France in the company of Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald. There Vidor mixed with literary expatriates, among them James Joyce and Ernest Hemingway. Vidor was shaken by news that US film studios and theaters were converting to sound technology and he returned quickly to Hollywood, concerned about the impact on silent cinema. Adjusting to the advent of sound, Vidor enthusiastically embarked upon his long-desired project of making a picture about rural black American life incorporating a musical soundtrack. He quickly completed writing the scenario for &quot;Hallelujah&quot; and began recruiting an all African-American cast.

M-G-M studios had not yet decided which emerging sound technology they would invest in, Vitaphone or Movietone, a decision that would determine what camera system Vidor would use. Vidor circumvented the dilemma by appealing directly to President of Lowe&#x27;s Inc. Nicholas Schenck, who authorized Vidor to begin shooting outdoor location sequences without sound and with the caveat that Vidor waive his $100,000 salary.

==== &quot;Hallelujah&quot; (1929) ====
Vidor&#x27;s first sound film &quot;Hallelujah&quot; (1929) combines a dramatic rural tragedy with a documentary-like depiction of black agrarian community of sharecroppers in the South. Daniel L. Haynes as Zeke, Nina Mae McKinney as Chick and William Fontaine as Hot Shot developed a love-triangle that leads to a revenge murder. A quasi-musical, Vidor&#x27;s innovative integration of sound into the scenes, including jazz and gospel adds immensely to the cinematic effect.

Vidor, a third-generation Texan, encountered black workers employed at his father&#x27;s sawmills when he was a child, and there he became familiar with their spirituals. As an adult, he was not immune to the racial prejudices common among whites in the South of the 1920s. His paternalistic claim to know the character of the &quot;real negro&quot; is reflected in his portrayal of some rural black characters as &quot;childishly simple, lecherously promiscuous, fanatically superstitious, and shiftless&quot;. Vidor, nonetheless, avoids reducing his characters to Uncle Tom stereotypes and his treatment bears no resemblance to the overt racism in D. W. Griffith&#x27;s &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; (1915).

The black sharecroppers resemble more the poor white agrarian entrepreneurs Vidor praised in his 1934 &quot;Our Daily Bread&quot;, emphasizing the class, rather than race, of his subjects. The film emerges as a human tragedy in which elemental forces of sexual desire and revenge contrast with family affection and community solidarity and redemption.

&quot;Hallelujah&quot; enjoyed an overwhelmingly positive response in the United States and internationally, praising Vidor&#x27;s stature as a film artist and as a humane social commentator. Vidor was nominated for Best Director at the Academy Awards of 1929.

==== M-G-M 1930â1931: &quot;Billy the Kid&quot; and &quot;The Champ&quot; ====
Filmed just before passage of the Production Code of 1933, Vidor&#x27;s &quot;Billy the Kid&quot; is free of the fixed moral dualities that came to typify subsequent Good Guy vs. Bad Guy Westerns in Hollywood. Starring former football champion Johnny Mack Brown as Billy and Wallace Beery as his nemesis Sheriff Pat Garrett, the protagonists display a gratuitous violence that anticipates Vidor&#x27;s 1946 masterpiece &quot;Duel in the Sun&quot; (1946). Homicidal behavior resonates with the brutal and deadly desert landscape, Hemingwayesque in its brevity and realism. Studio executives were concerned that the excessive violence would alienate audiences, though the Prohibition era in the United States was saturated with news of the gangster-related killings.
Shot partially in the new 70 mm Grandeur system, the film was conceived by producers to be an epic, but few cinemas were equipped to handle the new wide-screen technology. The film did poorly at the box-office.

Upon his return to M-G-M after his sojourn to complete &quot;Street Scene&quot; for Samuel Goldwyn, Vidor embarked on his second picture starring actor Wallace Beery, this time with child actor Jackie Cooper in &quot;The Champ&quot;. Based on a story by Francis Marion, Vidor adapts a standard plot about a socially and economically impaired parent who relinquishes a child to insure his/her escape from squalid conditions to achieve an upwardly mobile future. The film is a descendant of director Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s &quot;The Kid&quot; (1921), as well as Vidor&#x27;s own early silent shorts for Judge Willis Brown. Vidor owed M-G-M a more conventional and &quot;fool-proof&quot; production after executives allowed him to make the more experimental &quot;Street Scene&quot; in 1931. The Champ would prove to be a successful vehicle for Berry and propel him to top-rank among M-G-M movie stars.

==== &quot;Bird of Paradise&quot; and RKO Pictures : Sojourn in Hawaii, 1932 ====

After finishing the sentimental vehicle starring Wallace Beery, in &quot;The Champ&quot;, Vidor was loaned to Radio-Keith-Orpheum (RKO) to make a &quot;South Seas&quot; romance for producer David Selznick filmed in the US territory of Hawaii. Starring Dolores del RÃ­o and Joel McCrea, the tropical location and mixed-race love theme in &quot;Bird of Paradise&quot; included nudity and sexual eroticism.

During production Vidor began an affair with script assistant Elizabeth Hill that led to a series of highly productive screenplay collaborations and their marriage in 1937. Vidor divorced his wife, actress Eleanor Boardman shortly after &quot;Bird of Paradise&quot; was completed.

==== Great Depression: 1933â1934 ====
&quot;The Stranger&#x27;s Return&quot; (1933) and &quot;Our Daily Bread&quot; (1934) are Depression era films that present protagonists who flee the social and economic perils of urban America, plagued by high unemployment and labor unrest to seek a lost rural identity or make a new start in the agrarian countryside. Vidor&#x27;s expressed enthusiasm for the New Deal and Franklin Delano Roosevelt&#x27;s exhortation in his first inaugural in 1933 for a shift of labor from industry to agriculture.

In &quot;The Stranger&#x27;s Return&quot;, a city girl (Miriam Hopkins) abandons her life in a great metropolis to visit her grandfather (Lionel Barrymore) in Iowa, the aging patriarch of a working farm. Her arrival upsets the schemes of parasitic relatives to seize the property in anticipation of Grandpa Storr&#x27;s passing. The scenario presents the farm as &quot;bountiful&quot;, even in the midst of the Dust Bowl where banks seized tens-of-thousands of independent family farms in the Midwest and drove millions into low wage seasonal agricultural labor. The picture is a paean to family &quot;blood&quot; ties and rural generational continuity, manifested in the granddaughter&#x27;s commitment (though raised in New York City) to inherit the family farm and honor its agrarian heritage.

Vidor continued his &quot;back to the land&quot; theme in his 1934 &quot;Our Daily Bread&quot;. The picture is the second film of a trilogy he referred to as &quot;War, Wheat and Steel&quot;. His 1925 film &quot;The Big Parade&quot; was &quot;war&quot; and his 1944 &quot;An American Romance&quot; was &quot;steel&quot;. &quot;Our Daily Bread&quot; â &quot;wheat&quot; â is a sequel to his silent masterpiece &quot;The Crowd&quot; (1928).

&quot;Our Daily Bread&quot; is a deeply personal and politically controversial work that Vidor financed himself when M-G-M executives declined to back the production. M-G-M was uncomfortable with its characterization of big business, and particularity banking institutions, as corrupt.
A struggling Depression-era couple from the city inherit a derelict farm, and in an effort to make it a productive enterprise, they establish a cooperative in alliance with unemployed locals who possess various talents and commitments. The film raises questions as to the legitimacy of the American system of democracy and to government imposed social programs.

The picture garnered a mixed response among social and film critics, some regarding it as a socialistic condemnation of capitalism and others as tending towards fascism â a measure of Vidor&#x27;s own ambivalence in organizing his social outlook artistically.

=== The Goldwyn films: 1931â1937 ===

&quot;Street Scene&quot; (1931), &quot;Cynara&quot; (1932), &quot;The Wedding Night&quot; (1935), &quot;Stella Dallas&quot; (1937)

During the 1930s Vidor, though under contract to M-G-M studios, made four films under loan-out to independent producer Samuel Goldwyn, formerly with the Goldwyn studios that had amalgamated with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1924. Goldwyn&#x27;s insistence on fidelity to the prestigious literary material he had purchased for screen adaptations imposed cinematic restraints on his film directors, including Vidor. The first of their collaborations since the silent era was &quot;Street Scene&quot; (1931)

The adoption of the Pulitzer Prize-winning play by Elmer Rice depicts a microcosm in a major American metropolis and its social and economic inequalities. The cinematic limitations imposed by a single set restricted to a New York City block of tenements building and its ethnically diverse inhabitants presented Vidor with unique technical challenges. He and cinematographer George Barnes countered and complemented these structural restrictions by using a roving camera mounted on cranes, an innovation made possible by recent developments in early sound technology.

The excellent cast, drawn largely from the Broadway production, contributed to the critical success of the film, as did the huge publicity campaign engineered by Goldwyn. Street Scene&#x27;s immense box-office profits belied the financial and economic crisis of the early Depression years, when movie studios feared bankruptcy.

&quot;Cynara&quot; (1932), a romantic melodrama of a brief, yet tragic affair between a British barrister and a shopgirl, was Vidor&#x27;s second sound collaboration with Goldwyn. Starring two of Hollywood&#x27;s biggest stars of the period, Ronald Colman and Kay Francis, the story by Francis Marion is a cautionary tale concerning upper- and lower-class sexual infidelities set in England. Framed, as in the play and novel, in a series of flashbacks told by the married barrister Warlock (Colman), the story ends in honorable redemption for the barrister and death for his mistress. Vidor was able to inject some &quot;pure cinema&quot; into a picture that was otherwise a &quot;dialogue-heavy&quot; talkie: &quot;Colman [in London] tears up a piece of paper and throws the pieces out a window, where they fly into the air. Vidor cuts to St. Mark&#x27;s Square in Venice (where Francis, his spouse is vacationing), with pigeons flying into the air&quot;.

In his third collaboration with Goldwyn, Vidor was tasked with salvaging the producer&#x27;s huge investment in Soviet-trained Russian actress Anna Sten. Goldwyn&#x27;s effort to elevate Sten to the stature of Dietrich or Garbo had thus far failed despite his relentless promotion when Vidor began directing her in &quot;The Wedding Night&quot; (1935).

A tale of a doomed affair between a married New Yorker (Gary Cooper) (whose character Vidor based on novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald) and a farm girl (Sten) from an Old World Polish family, Vidor provided thoughtful direction to Cooper and Sten while cinematographer Gregg Toland&#x27;s devised effective lighting and photography. Despite good reviews the picture did not establish Sten as a star among movie-goers and she remained &quot;Goldwyn&#x27;s Folly&quot;.

In 1937 Vidor made his final and most profitable picture with Samuel Goldwyn: &quot;Stella Dallas&quot;. A remake of Goldwyn&#x27;s most successful silent movie, the 1925 &quot;Stella Dallas&quot;, also an adaption of Olive Higgins Prouty&#x27;s popular novel. Barbara Stanwyck stars as the eponymous &quot;martyr of motherhood&quot; in the sound re-make. Vidor analyzed director Henry King&#x27;s handling of his silent production and incorporated or modified some of its filmic structure and staging. Stanwyck&#x27;s performance, reportedly without undue oversight by Vidor, is outstanding, benefited by her selective vetting of Belle Bennett&#x27;s famous portrayal. Vidor contributed to defining Stanwyck&#x27;s role substantially in the final cut, providing a sharper focus on her character and delivering one of the great tear-jerkers in film history.
Despite the success of the film it would be his last with Goldwyn, as Vidor had tired of the producer&#x27;s outbursts on the set. Vidor emphatically declined to work with the &quot;mercurial&quot; producer again.

===Paramount Pictures: 1935â1936===

&quot;So Red the Rose&quot; (1935) and &quot;The Texas Rangers&quot; (1936)

Paramount production manager at Paramount Pictures, Ernst Lubitsch, persuaded Vidor to undertake the direction of a film based on a story that afforded a &quot;&quot;Southern&quot; perspective, &quot;So Red the Rose&quot;, an American Civil War epic.

The topic appealed to the Texas-bred Vidor and he offered a dual vision of the antebellum South&#x27;s response to the war among the white planter class, sentimentalizing their struggle and defeat. Here, the western &quot;pioneer&quot; plantation owners possess less of the anti-Northern fury that led to secession by their &quot;Old South&quot; counterparts. The scion of the estate, Duncan Bedford (Randolph Scott) initially refuses to join the Confederate army (&quot;I don&#x27;t believe Americans should fight Americans&quot;) but his sister Vallette Duncan (Margaret Sullavan) scorns his pacifism and singlehandedly diverts her slaves from rebellion. The white masters of the &quot;Portobello&quot; plantation in Mississippi emerge from the conflict content that North and South made equal sacrifices, and that a &quot;New South&quot; has emerged that is better off without its white aristocracy and slavery. With Portobello in ruins, Valette and Duncan submit to the virtues of hard work in a pastoral existence.

The novel &quot;So Red the Rose&quot; (1934) by Stark Young in its narrative and theme anticipates author Margaret Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1936). Vidor, initially tapped to direct Mitchell&#x27;s epic, was ultimately assigned to director George Cukor.

The box-office failure of &quot;So Red the Rose&quot; led the film industry to anticipate the same for Cukor&#x27;s adaption of Mitchell&#x27;s Civil War epic. To the contrary, &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939) enjoyed immense commercial and critical success.

At a period in the 1930s when Western theme films were relegated to low-budget B movies, Paramount studios financed an A Western for Vidor at $625,000 (lowered to $450,000 when star Gary Cooper was replaced with Fred MacMurray in the lead role.) &quot;The Texas Rangers&quot;, Vidor&#x27;s second and final film for Paramount reduced, but did not abandon, the level of sadistic and lawless violence evidenced in his &quot;Billy the Kid&quot;. Vidor presents a morality play where the low-cunning of the outlaws &quot;cum&quot; vigilantes heroes is turned to the service of law-and-order when they kill their erstwhile accomplice in crime â the &quot;Polka Dot Bandit.&quot;.

The film&#x27;s scenario and script was penned by Vidor and wife Elizabeth Hill, based loosely on &quot;The Texas Rangers: A History of Frontier Defense of the Texas Rangers&quot; by Walter Prescott Webb. Made on the 100th anniversary of the formation of the Texas Ranger Division the picture includes standard B western tropes, including Indian massacres of white settlers and a corrupt city official who receives small town justice at the hands of a jury composed of saloon denizens. The film presages, as does Vidor&#x27;s &quot;Billy the Kid&quot; (1931), his portrayal of the savagery of civilization and nature in producer David O. Selznick&#x27;s &quot;Duel in the Sun&quot; (1946).

In an effort to retain Vidor at Paramount, the production head William LeBaron offered him a biopic of Texas icon, Sam Houston. Vidor emphatically declined: &quot;... &quot;I&#x27;ve [had] such a belly-full of Texas after the Rangers that I find myself not caring whether Sam Houston takes Texas from the Mexicans or lets them keep it.&quot;

===Screen Directors Guild===

In the 1930s Vidor became a leading advocate for the formation of the Screen Directors Guild (SDG) and since 1960 called the Directors Guild of America (DGA), when television directors joined its ranks.

In an effort to enlarge movie director&#x27;s meager influence in studio production decisions, Vidor personally exhorted a dozen or more leading directors, among them Howard Hawks, William Wellman, Ernst Lubitsch and Lewis Milestone to form a union, leading to the incorporation of the SDG in January 1936. By 1938, the collective bargaining unit had grown from a founding membership of 29 to an inclusive union of 600, representing Hollywood directors and assistant directors. The demands under Vidor&#x27;s tenure at SDG were mild, seeking increased opportunities to examine scripts before filming and to make the initial cut on a movie.

As the SDG&#x27;s first president, and a founding member of the anti-Communist group the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals Vidor failed to bring the SDG into affiliation with the American Federation of Labor (AFL) that had already organized actors and screenwriters (deemed a &quot;Bolshevik&quot; political front by anti-communist critics). Not until 1939 would the directors sign an accord with these sister guilds, under then SDG president Frank Capra.

==M-G-M: 1938â1944==

Upon completion of &quot;Stella Dallas&quot; and his disaffection from Samuel Goldwyn, Vidor returned to M-G-M under a five-film contract that would produce &quot;The Citadel&quot; (1938), &quot;Northwest Passage&quot; (1940), &quot;Comrade X&quot; (1940), &quot;H. M. Pulham, Esq.&quot; (1941) and &quot;An American Romance&quot; (1944). In 1939, Vidor would also direct the final three weeks of primary filming for &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1939).

Film historian John Baxter describes the demands that the studio system at M-G-M had on an auteur director such as Vidor in this period:
These unconsummated projects at M-G-M include &quot;National Velvet&quot; (1944) and &quot;The Yearling&quot; (1946), the later in which Vidor presided over a failed attempt to produce a population of juvenile deer who would be age-appropriate throughout the production (female deer refused to reproduce out of season). Both films would be completed by the director Clarence Brown. Vidor further invested six months shooting an Amazon River survival-adventure, &quot;The Witch in the Wilderness&quot; from which he was diverted to perform pre-production for &quot;Northwest Passage&quot; (1940). This period would be one of transition for Vidor but would lead to an artistic phase where he created some of his richest and most characteristic works.

The Citadel: The first picture under the contract and the first under the Screen Directors Guild (SDG) was &quot;The Citadel&quot; in 1938. Filmed in England at a time the British government and trade unions had placed restrictions designed to extract a portion of the highly lucrative American movie exports to the British Isles. M-G-M, as a tactical olive branch, agreed to hire British actors as cast members for &quot;The Citadel&quot; and provided them generous compensation. (American actress Rosalind Russell and Vidor were the only two non-Britons who served on the film&#x27;s production).

The movie is a close adaptation of A. J. Cronin&#x27;s novel of the same name, an exposÃ© of the mercenary aspects of the medical profession that entices doctors to serve the upper-classes at the expense of the poor. Vidor&#x27;s Christian Science-inspired detachment from the medical profession influence his handling of the story, in which an independent doctor&#x27;s cooperative is favored over both socialized medicine and a profit-driven medical establishment.

The protagonist, Dr. Andrew Manson (Robert Donat) ultimately resorts to an act of anarchism by using explosives to destroy a disease-producing sewer, but emerges personally vindicated. 
A success at the Academy Awards, the film garnered nominations for Best Picture, Best Actor (Donat), Best Director and Best Original Screenplay.

During the late 1930s M-G-M enlisted Vidor to assume artistic and technical responsibilities, some of which went uncredited. The most outstanding of these was his shooting of the black-and-white &quot;Kansas&quot; sequences in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, including the notable musical production in which Dorothy Judy Garland sings &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot;. Portions of the Technicolor sequences that depict Dorothy and her companions lulled into sleep on a field of poppies were also handled by Vidor.

The sound era saw the eclipse of the Western movie that had its heyday in the silent era and by the 1930s the genre was relegated to the producers of B movies. By the end of the decade high-budget films depicting the Indian Wars in the America of the 18th and 19th century reappeared, notably Ford&#x27;s &quot;Drums Along the Mohawk&quot; (1939) and DeMille&#x27;s &quot;North West Mounted Police&quot; (1940)

In the summer of 1939, Vidor began filming in Idaho a Western-themed picture using the new Technicolor system. The picture that emerged is one of his &quot;master works&quot;: &quot;Northwest Passage&quot; (1940).

Northwest Passage: Based on an American colonial-era epic novel, the film describes a punitive expedition against an Abenaki (Iroquois) village by a unit of British Army irregulars during the French and Indian Wars. Major Robert Rogers (Spencer Tracy) leads his green-clad &quot;Roberts Rangers&quot; on a grueling trek through 200 miles of wilderness. The Rangers fall upon the village and brutally exterminate the inhabitants who are suspected of assaulting white settlements. A demoralized retreat ensues led by Rogers. Under retaliatory attack by Indians and a savage landscape the Rangers are pushed to the limits of their endurance, some reduced to cannibalism and madness.

The script by Laurence Stallings and Talbot Jennings (and several uncredited writers) conveys the unabashed anti-Indian hatred that motivates Roger&#x27;s men to their task. The level of violence anticipates film noir of the post-World War II period and the McCarthy era.
Vidor began filming in July 1939, just weeks before war was declared in Europe and the isolationist or interventionist policies were widely debated. The film influenced tropes that appeared in subsequent war films, depicting small military units operating behind enemy lines and relying on harsh tactics to destroy enemy combatants. The relevance of &quot;Northwest Passage&quot;â³s sanguinary adventurer to contemporary Americans confronted with a looming world war is never made explicit but raises moral questions on &quot;military virtue&quot; and how a modern war might be conducted. Though Vidor was &quot;anti-fascist&quot; his political predilections are left unstated in &quot;Northwest Passage&quot;.
Vidor established an unusually close professional relationship with the film&#x27;s star, Spencer Tracy, and the actor delivered what Vidor considered a performance of &quot;tremendous conviction&quot;.

Vidor used the new three-strip Technicolor camera system (the two huge 800-pound [365Â kg] cameras had to be transported by train). The color photography conveys more than the scenic beauty of Payette Lake, injecting documentary realism into key sequences. Notable are those of the Rangers portaging boats through a rugged mountain pass, and the famous river &quot;human chain&quot; crossing. Despite its enormous box office earnings, &quot;Northwest Passage&quot; failed to recoup its $2Â million production costs. The cinematography earned an Oscer nomination in that category.

Comrade X: A political comedy set in the Soviet Union, &quot;Comrade X&quot; (1940) was conceived as a vehicle for M-G-M&#x27;s glamorous acquisition Hedy Lamarr, in the hopes they might duplicate the profits they reaped from M-G-M star Greta Garbo in Ninotchka (1939). &quot;Comrade&quot; X is played by Clark Gable, a cynical American journalist who exposes Stalin-era cultural falsifications in his dispatches to his newspaper in the United States. Lamarr plays a Moscow tram conductor. Her coldly logical persona ultimately proves susceptible to Gable&#x27;s America-inspired enthusiasms. Released in December 1940, the scurrilous tone of the dialogue toward the USSR officials was consistent with US government posture in the aftermath of the HitlerâStalin Pact of August 1939. When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941 (after America&#x27;s entry into WWII in December 1941), Russians became US allies in the war effort against the Axis powers. Reflecting these developments, M-G-M executives, just six months after the film&#x27;s release, inserted a disclaimer assuring audiences that the movie was only a farce, not a hostile critique of the USSR. Writer Walter Reisch, who also scripted Ninotchka, earned an Oscar nomination for best original story.

Vidor disparaged the picture as &quot;an insignificant light comedy&quot; that afforded him &quot;a change of pace.&quot; Vidor&#x27;s next picture would be a cold-eyed examination of the institution of marriage and a much more personal work: &quot;H.M. Pulham, Esq.&quot; (1941).

H. M. Pulham, Esq.: With wife and screenwriting partner Elizabeth Hill, Vidor adapted John P. Marquand&#x27;s highly popular novel of the same name. A story of a married man tempted to revive an affair with an old flame, Vidor draws upon memories of a failed romance from his own youth.

Harry Pulham (Robert Young), a member of the New England&#x27;s conservative upper-middle class, is stultified by the respectable routines of life and a proper marriage to his wife Kay (Ruth Hussey). Vidor examines Pulham&#x27;s past in a series of flashbacks that reveal a youthful affair Harry had with an ambitious German immigrant, Marvin Myles (Hedy Lamarr) at a New York advertising agency. They prove incompatible, largely due to different class orientation and expectations: Marvin pursues her dynamic career in New York and Harry returns to the security of his Bostonian social establishment. In an act of desperate nostalgia, Pulham attempts to rekindle the relationship 20 years later, to no avail. His attempt at rebellion failed, Harry Pulham consciously submits to a life of conformity that falls short of freedom but offers self-respect and a modest contentment.

&quot;H. M. Pulham, Esq&quot; was completed by Vidor after years of manufacturing &quot;conventional successes&quot; for M-G-M. The calm certitude of Harry Pulham in the face of enforced conformity may reflect Vidor&#x27;s determination to artistically address larger issues in contemporary American society. His next, and final movie for M-G-M, would be the &quot;Steel&quot; component of his &quot;War, Wheat and Steel&quot; film trilogy: &quot;An American Romance&quot; (1944).
An American Romance: Rather than demonstrate his patriotism by joining a military film unit Vidor attempted to create a paean to American democracy. His 1944 An American Romance represents the &quot;steel&quot; installment of Vidor&#x27;s &quot;War, Wheat and Steel&quot; trilogy and serves as his &quot;industrial epic&quot;.and emerged from an extremely convoluted screenwriting evolution. Vidor personifies the relationship between man and the natural resources on which struggles to impose his purpose on nature.

The lead role of immigrant Stefan Dubechek was offered to Spencer Tracy but the actor declined, an acute disappointment for the director who had greatly admired Tracy&#x27;s performance in his &quot;Northwest Passage&quot; (1940). Vidor&#x27;s dissatisfaction with the studio&#x27;s casting, including lead Brian Donlevy, led Vidor to concentrate on the industrial landscape to reveal the motivations of his characters.

Despite producer Louis B. Mayer&#x27;s personal enthusiasm for the picture, his studio deleted 30 minutes from the movie, mostly essential human interest sequences and only preserving the abundant documentary scenes. Disgusted by M-G-M&#x27;s mutilations, Vidor terminated his 20-year association with the studio. The film received negative reviews and was a financial failure. Some critics noted a shift in Vidor&#x27;s focus from working class struggles to celebrating the ascent of a &quot;Ford-like&quot; industrial magnate. Film historian Raymond Durgnat considers the picture &quot;his least personal, artistically weakest and most spiritually confused.&quot;

The failure of &quot;An American Romance&quot;, after an artistic investment of three years, staggered Vidor and left him deeply demoralized. The break with M-G-M presented an opportunity to establish a more satisfying relationship with other studio producers. Emerging from this &quot;spiritual&quot; nadir he would create a Western of great intensity: &quot;Duel in the Sun&quot; (1946).

===A sound era magnum opus: &quot;Duel in the Sun&quot; (1946)===

At the end of 1944 Vidor considered a number of projects, including a remake of his silent era Wild Oranges (1924), this time with producer David O. Selznick.

When Selznick purchased the rights to Niven Busch&#x27;s novel &quot;Duel in the Sun&quot; in 1944, Vidor agreed to rewrite Oliver H. P. Garrett&#x27;s screenplay and direct a miniature Western, &quot;small&quot; but &quot;intense&quot;. Selznick&#x27;s increasingly grandiose plans for the production involved his wish to promote the career of actress-mistress Jennifer Jones and to create a movie rivaling his successful 1939 &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. Selzick&#x27;s personal and artistic ambitions for &quot;Duel in the Sun&quot; led to conflicts with Vidor over development of the themes which emphasized &quot;sex, violence and spectacle&quot;. Vidor walked off the set just before primary filming was completed, unhappy with Selznick&#x27;s intrusive management. The producer would enlist eight additional directors to complete the picture. Though the final cut was made without Vidor&#x27;s participation, the production reflects the participation of these talented filmmakers, among them William Dieterle and Josef von Sternberg. Vidor was awarded sole screen credit after Directors Guild arbitration. 
&quot;Duel in the Sun&quot; is a melodramatic treatment of a Western theme concerning a conflict between two generations of the McCanles family. The elderly and crippled McCanles Lionel Barrymore presides with an iron fist over his a vast cattle estate with his invalid wife Laura Belle Candles Lillian Gish. Their two sons, Lewt and Jess, are polar opposites: the educated Jess &quot;the good son&quot; Joseph Cotten takes after his refined mother, while Lewt &quot;the bad son&quot; Gregory Peck emulates his domineering cattle baron father. The adoption of the young orphan girl Pearl Chavez, the &quot;half-breed&quot; offspring of a European gentleman and a native-American mother, whom Pearl&#x27;s father has murdered and been executed for his crime, introduces a fatal element into the McCanles family. The &quot;film noir&quot; ending includes an attempted fratricide and a suicide-like love pact, destroying the McCanles family.
The &quot;unbridled sexuality&quot; portrayed by Vidor between Pearl and Lewt created a furor that drew criticism from the US Congressmen and film censors, which led to the studio cutting several minutes before its final release.

Selznick launched &quot;Duel in the Sun&quot; in hundreds of theaters, backed by a multiple-million dollar promotional campaign. Despite the film&#x27;s poor critical reception (termed &quot;Lust in the Dust&quot; by its detractors) the picture&#x27;s box office returns rivaled the highest-grossing film of the year, &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot; (1946).

Film archivist Charles Silver offered this appraisal of the Vidor-Selznick collaboration:

====&quot;On Our Merry Way&quot; (&quot;A Miracle Can Happen&quot;), Universal Studios 1948====

In the aftermath of his critical failures in &quot;An American Romance&quot; (1944) and &quot;Duel in the Sun&quot; (1946), Vidor disengaged from Hollywood film production to purchase his Willow Creek Ranch in Paso Robles, California.

&quot;A Miracle Can Happen&quot; (1948) is a film sketch that Vidor participated in with co-director Leslie Fenton during this period of relative inactivity. A &quot;low-budget&quot; Universal Studios release of the early baby boom era, this &quot;omnibus&quot; presents vignettes filmed or performed by an array of actors and directors (some of them returning from service in the armed forces) among them Burgess Meredith, Paulette Goddard, Dorothy Lamour, James Stewart, John Huston and George Stevens. (An episode with British actor Charles Laughton was cut from the final release, a disappointment to Vidor.) The picture&#x27;s title was changed shortly after opening to &quot;On Our Merry Way&quot; to promote its comedic virtues. Vidor dismissed the film from his oeuvre in later years.

In 1948 Vidor was diverted from making a series of 16mm Westerns for television and produced on his ranch when Warner Brothers studios approached him to direct an adaption of author Ayn Rand&#x27;s controversial novel &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;. Vidor immediately accepted the offer.

===Warner Brothers: 1949â1951===

Vidor&#x27;s three films for Warner Brothers studiosâ&quot;The Fountainhead&quot; (1949), &quot;Beyond the Forest&quot; (1949) and &quot;Lightning Strikes Twice&quot; (1951)âwere crafted to reconcile the excessive and amoral violence displayed in his &quot;Duel in the Sun&quot; (1946) with a constructive presentation of American individualism that comported with his Christian Science precepts of morality.

The Fountainhead (1949): Unhappy with the screen adaptation offered by Warner Brothers for Ayn Rand&#x27;s 1938 novel &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;, Vidor asked the author to write the script. Rand accepted but inserted a caveat into her contract requiring that she authorize any deviation from the book&#x27;s story or dialogue. Vidor accepted the provision.

Rand&#x27;s political philosophy of Objectivism is distilled through the character of architect Howard Roark (Gary Cooper), who adopts an uncompromising stance on the physical integrity of his proposed designs. When one of his architectural projects is compromised, he destroys the building with dynamite. At his trial, Roark offers a principled and forthright defense for his act of sabotage and is exonerated by the jury. Though Vidor was committed to developing his own populist notion of American individualism, Rand&#x27;s didactic Objectivist scenario and script informs much of the film. The Roark character is loosely based on the architect Frank Lloyd Wright, both in the novel and Vidor&#x27;s film version.

Vidor&#x27;s most outstanding cinematic innovation in &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; is his highly stylized images of the Manhattan high-rise interiors and skylines. The urban landscapes, created by Art Director Edward Carrere were strongly influenced by German Expressionism and contribute to the film&#x27;s compelling &quot;film noir&quot; character. The eroticism inherent in the sets resonate with the on-screen sexual tension, augmented by the off-screen affair between Cooper and Patricia Neal, who plays the architect&#x27;s ally-adversary Dominique Francon.
&quot;The Fountainhead&quot; enjoyed profitable box-office returns but a poor critical reception. Satisfied with his experience at Warner&#x27;s, Vidor signed a two-film contract with the studio. In his second picture he would direct Warner&#x27;s most prestigious star Bette Davis in Beyond the Forest (1949).

Beyond the Forest (1949): A lurid &quot;noir&quot; melodrama that tracks the descent of a petty-bourgeois Madame Bovary-like character, Rosa Moline (Bette Davis) into marital infidelity, murder and a sordid death, the picture has earned a reputation as a &quot;Camp&quot; classic. The film is often cited for providing the phrase &quot;What a dump!&quot;, appropriated by playwright Edward Albee in his 1962 &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; and its 1966 &quot;screen&quot; adaptation.

Despising the role assigned her by producer Jack Warner and feuding with director Vidor over her character&#x27;s portrayal, Davis delivers a startling performance and one of the best of her mid-career. The role of Rosa Molina would be her last film with Warner Brothers after seventeen years with the studio.

Vidor&#x27;s characterization of Davis as the unsophisticated Gorgon-like Rosa (the film was titled &quot;La Garce&quot;, &quot;[The Bitch]&quot;, in French releases) were widely rejected by her fans and contemporary film critics and reviews &quot;were the worst of Vidor&#x27;s career.&quot; 
Vidor and Max Steiner inserted a leitmotif into those sequences where Rosa obsessively longs for escape from the dull, rural Loyalton to the cosmopolitan and sophisticated Chicago. The &quot;Chicago&quot; theme surfaces (a tune made famous by Judy Garland) in an ironic style reminiscent of film composer Bernard Herrmann. Steiner earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Film Score.

Lightning Strikes Twice (1951): His final picture for Warner Brothers, Vidor attempted to create a &quot;film noir&quot; tale of a deadly love triangle starring Richard Todd, Ruth Roman and Mercedes McCambridge, a cast that did not suit Vidor. A standard Warner&#x27;s melodrama, Vidor declared that the picture &quot;turned out terribly&quot; and is largely unrepresentative of his work except in its western setting and its examination of sexual strife, the theme of the film. Vidor&#x27;s next project was proposed by producer Joseph Bernhard after pre-production and casting were nearly complete: &quot;Japanese War Bride&quot; (1952).

====&quot;Japanese War Bride&quot; (1952): Twentieth Century Fox====

The topic of the film, white racial prejudice in post-WWII America, had been addressed in a number of Hollywood films of the period, including directors Joseph Losey&#x27;s &quot;The Lawless&quot; (1950) and Mark Robson&#x27;s &quot;Home of the Brave&quot; (1949).

The story by co-producer Anson Bond concerns wounded Korean War veteran Jim Sterling (Don Taylor), who returns with his bride, Japanese nurse Tae (Shirley Yamaguchi), to his parents&#x27; farm in California&#x27;s Central Valley. Conflicts arise when Jim&#x27;s sister-in-law falsely accuses Tae of infidelity, sparking conflicts with the neighboring Nisei-owned farm. The picture locates acts of racism towards non-whites as personal neurosis rather than socially constructed prejudice. Vidor&#x27;s artistic commitments to the film were minimal in a production that was funded as a B Movie, though he meticulously documents the experience of workers in field and factory.

Before beginning direction of &quot;Japanese War Bride&quot;, Vidor had already arranged with Bernhard to finance his next project and perhaps &quot;the last great film&quot; of his career: &quot;Ruby Gentry&quot; (1952).

====&quot;Ruby Gentry&quot; (1952): Twentieth Century Fox====

With &quot;Ruby Gentry&quot;, Vidor revisits the themes and scenario of &quot;Duel in the Sun&quot; (1946), in which an impoverished young woman, Jennifer Jones (Ruby nÃ©e Corey, later Gentry), is taken in by a well-to-do couple. When the foster mother dies (Josephine Hutchinson) Ruby marries the widower (Karl Malden) for security, but he too dies under circumstances that cast suspicions on Ruby. She is harried by her evangelical preacher-sibling (James Anderson) and her love affair with the son of a local land-owing scion (Charlton Heston) leads to a deadly shootout, a climax that recalls Vidor&#x27;s violent 1946 Western.

Vidor deferred his own salary to make the low-budget work, filming the &quot;North Carolina&quot; landscapes on his California ranch. American critics generally disparaged the movie.

Film historian Raymond Durgnat champions &quot;Ruby Gentry&quot; &quot;as a truly great American film...&quot;film noir&quot; imbued with new fervor&quot; that combines a radical social understanding with a Hollywood veneer and an intensely personal artistic statement. Vidor ranks &quot;Ruby Gentry&quot; among his most artistically gratifying works: &quot;I had complete freedom in shooting it, and Selznick, who could have had an influence on Jennifer Jones, didn&#x27;t intervene. I think I succeeded in getting something out of Jennifer, something quite profound and subtle.&quot; The swamp sequence where Ruby and her lover Boake hunt one another is &quot;perhaps the best sequence [Vidor] ever filmed.&quot; &quot;Ruby Gentry&quot; showcases the essential elements of Vidor&#x27;s oeuvre depicting the extremes of passion inherent in humanity and nature. Vidor commented on these elements as follows:

====Autobiography: &quot;A Tree is a Tree&quot;====

In 1953, Vidor&#x27;s autobiography entitled &quot;A Tree is a Tree&quot; was published and widely praised. Film critic Dan Callahan provides this excerpt the book:

====Light&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee, General Electric, 1954====

As part of the 75th Anniversary of Thomas Edison&#x27;s invention of electric light, Vidor adapted two short stories for television produced by David O. Selznick. The production aired on all the major American TV networks on October 24, 1954.

Vidor&#x27;s contributions included &quot;A Kiss for the Lieutenant&quot; by author Arthur Gordon starring Kim Novak, an amusing romantic vignette, as well as an adaption of novelist John Steinbeck&#x27;s short story &quot;Leader of the People&quot; (1937) (from his novella &quot;The Red Pony&quot;) in which a retired wagon-master, Walter Brennan, rebuffed by his son Harry Morgan, finds a sympathetic audience for his War Horse reminiscences about the Old West in his grandson Brandon deWilde. Screenwriter Ben Hecht wrote the scripts for both segments.

In 1954 Vidor, in collaboration with longtime associate and screenwriter Laurence Stallings, pursued a remake of the director&#x27;s silent era &quot;The Turn in the Road&quot; (1919). Vidor&#x27;s persistent efforts to revive this Christian Science-themed work spanning 15 years in the post-war period was never consummated, though a cast was proposed for an Allied Artists production in 1960. Setting aside this endeavor, Vidor opted to film a Western with Universal-International, &quot;Man Without a Star&quot; (1955).

====&quot;Man Without a Star&quot;, 1955====

Based on a story by Dee Linford of the same name and scripted by Borden Chase, &quot;Man Without a Star&quot; is an iconographic Western tale of remorseless struggle between a wealthy rancher Reed Bowman (Jeanne Crain) and small homesteaders. Saddle-tramp and gunman Dempsey Rae (Kirk Douglas) is drawn into the vortex of violence, that Vidor symbolizes with ubiquitous barbed-wire. The cowboy ultimately prevails against the hired gunslinger Steve Miles (Richard Boone) who had years ago murdered Rae&#x27;s younger brother.

Kirk Douglas acted as both the star and uncredited producer in a collaborative effort with director Vidor. Neither was entirely satisfied with the result. Vidor failed to fully develop his thematic conception, the ideal of balancing personal freedoms with conservation of the land as a heritage.
Vidor and Douglas succeeded in creating Douglas&#x27;s splendid character, Dempsey Rae, who emerges as a vital force, especially in the saloon-banjo sequence that screenwriter Borden Chase termed &quot;pure King Vidor&quot;.

&quot;Man Without a Star&quot;, rated as &quot;a minor work&quot; by biographer John Baxter, marks a philosophical transition in Vidor&#x27;s outlook towards Hollywood: the Dempsey Rae figure, though retaining his personal integrity, &quot;is a man without a star to follow; no ideal, no goal&quot; reflecting a declining enthusiasm by the director for American topics. Vidor&#x27;s final two movies, the epics &quot;War and Peace&quot; (an adaptation of the novel by Russian author Leo Tolstoy), and &quot;Solomon and Sheba&quot;, a story from the Old Testament, followed the director&#x27;s realization that his self-conceived film proposals would not be welcomed by commercial movie enterprises. This pair of historical costume dramas were created outside Hollywood, both filmed and financed in Europe.

===&quot;War and Peace&quot; (1956)===
Contrary to his aesthetic aversion to adapting historical spectaculars, in 1955 Vidor accepted independent Italian producer Dino De Laurentis&#x27;s offer to create a screen adaption of Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s vast historical romance of the late-Napoleonic era, &quot;War and Peace&quot; (1869). In the public domain, &quot;War and Peace&quot; was under consideration for adaption by several studios. Paramount Pictures and De Laurenti rushed the film into production before a proper script could be formulated from Tolstoy&#x27;s complex and massive tale, requiring rewrites throughout the shooting. The final cut, at three hours, was necessarily a highly compressed version of the literary work.

Tolstoy&#x27;s themes of individualism, the centrality of family and national allegiance and the virtues of agrarian egalitarianism were immensely appealing to Vidor. He commented on the pivotal character in the novel, Pierre Bezukhov (played by Henry Fonda): &quot;The strange thing about it is the character of Pierre is the same character I had been trying to put on the screen in many of my own films.&quot;
 Vidor was unsatisfied with the choice of Henry Fonda for the role of Pierre, and argued in favor of British actor Peter Ustinov. He was overruled by Dino de Laurentis, who insisted that the central figure in the epic appear as a conventional romantic leading man, rather than as the novel&#x27;s &quot;overweight, bespectacled&quot; protagonist. 
 Vidor sought to endow Pierre&#x27;s character so as to reflect the central theme of Tolstoy&#x27;s novel: an individual&#x27;s troubled striving to rediscover essential moral truths. The superficiality of the script and Fonda&#x27;s inability to convey the subtleties of Pierre&#x27;s spiritual journey thwarted Vidor&#x27;s efforts to actualize the film&#x27;s theme. Recalling these interpretive disputes, Vidor remarked that &quot;though a damn good actor... [Fonda] just did not understand what I was trying to say.&quot;

Vidor was delighted with the vitality of Audrey Hepburn&#x27;s performance as Natasha Rostova, in contrast to the miscasting of the male leads. His assessment of the centrality of Natasha is based in the process of her maturation: 

Cinematographer Jack Cardiff devised one of the film&#x27;s most visually striking sequences, the sunrise duel between Pierre (Henry Fonda) and Kuragin (Tullio Carminati), shot entirely on a sound-stage. Vidor performed second-production duties to oversee the spectacular battle reenactments and director Mario Soldati (uncredited) shot a number of scenes with the principal cast.

American audiences showed modest enthusiasm at the box-office, but &quot;War and Peace&quot; was well received by film critics. The movie was met with huge popular approval in the USSR, a fact alarming to Soviet officials, coming as it did near the height of Cold War hostilities between America and Russia. The Soviet government responded in 1967 with its own heavily financed adaption of the novel, War and Peace (film series) (1967).

&quot;War and Peace&quot; garnered Vidor further offers to film historical epics, among these &quot;King of Kings&quot; (1961), (directed by Nicholas Ray) as well as a project to develop a script about the life of 16th Century Spanish author Miguel Cervantes. Vidor finally settled on the Old Testament story of Solomon and Sheba, with Tyrone Power and Gina Lollobrigida tapped as the star-crossed monarchs. This would be Vidor&#x27;s final Hollywood film of his career.

===&quot;Solomon and Sheba&quot; (1959)===

&quot;Solomon and Sheba&quot; is one of a cycle of bible-based epics popular favored by Hollywood during the 1950s. The film is best remembered as the Vidor&#x27;s last commercial production of his long career in Hollywood.

A tragic footnote is attached to this picture. Six weeks into production the leading man, 45-year-old star Tyrone Power, suffered a heart attack during a climactic sword fight scene. He died within the hour. Considered the &quot;ultimate nightmare&quot; for any major movie production, the entire film had to be re-shot, with the lead role of Solomon now recast with Yul Brynner.
The death of Tyrone Powers was less a financial disaster and more a creative loss. Vidor was bereft of an actor who had grasped the complex nature of the Solomon figure, adding depth to Powers&#x27; performance. Brynner and Vidor were instantly at loggerheads when the leading man substituted a portrayal of an &quot;anguished monarch&quot; for an Israelite king who would &quot;dominate each situation without conflict.&quot; Vidor reported, &quot;it was an attitude that affected the depth of his performance and probably the integrity of the film.&quot;
Leading lady Gina Lollobrigida adopted Brynner&#x27;s approach to her character development of her Queen of Sheba, adding another facet of discord with the director.

&quot;Solomon and Sheba&quot; includes some impressive action sequences, including a widely cited battle finale in which Solomon&#x27;s tiny army faces an approaching onslaught of mounted warriors. His troops turn their burnished shields to the sun, the reflected light blinding the enemy hordes and sending them careening into an abyss. Astonishing sequences such as these abound in Vidor&#x27;s work, prompting film historian Andrew Sarris to observe &quot;Vidor was a director for anthologies [who] created more great moments and fewer great films than any director of his rank.&quot;
Despite the setbacks that plagued the production and the ballooning costs associated with the reshoot, Solomon and Sheba &quot;more than earned back its costs.&quot;

Contrary to claims that &quot;Solomon and Sheba&quot; ended Vidor&#x27;s career, he continued to receive offers to film major productions after its completion. The reasons for the director&#x27;s disengagement from commercial film-making are related to his age (65) and to his desire to pursue smaller and more personal movie projects. Reflecting on independent productions, Vidor remarked, &quot;I&#x27;m glad I got out of it.&quot;

===Post-Hollywood projects, 1959â1981===

====&quot;Truth and Illusion: An Introduction to Metaphysics&quot; (1964)====

In the mid-1960s Vidor crafted a 26-minute 16mm movie that sets forth his philosophy on the nature of individual perception. Narrated by the director, and quoting from theologian-philosophers Jonathan Edwards and Bishop Berkeley, the images serve to complement the abstract ideas he sets forth. The film is a discourse on subjective idealism, which maintains that the material world is an illusion, existing only in the human mind: humanity creates the world they experience.

As Vidor describes in Whitmanesque terms:

&quot;Truth and Illusion&quot; provides an insight into the significance of Vidor&#x27;s themes in his work, and is consistent with his Christian Science precepts.

Micheal Neary served as assistant director on the film, and Fred Y. Smith completed the editing. The movie was never released commercially.

====&quot;The Metaphor&quot;: King Vidor meets with Andrew Wyeth (1980)====

Vidor&#x27;s documentary &quot;The Metaphor&quot; consists of a number of interviews between the director and painter Andrew Wyeth. Wyeth had contacted Vidor in the late 1970s expressing admiration for his work. The artist emphasized that much of his material had been inspired by the director&#x27;s 1925 war-romance &quot;The Big Parade&quot;.

The documentary records the discussions between Vidor and both Wyeth and his spouse Betsy. A montage is formed by inter-cutting images of Wyeth&#x27;s paintings with short clips from Vidor&#x27;s &quot;The Big Parade&quot;. Vidor attempts to reveal an &quot;inner metaphor&quot; demonstrating the sources of artistic inspiration.

Considering the film only a work in progress at the time of his death, the documentary had its premiere at the American Film Institute in 1980. 
It was never given a general release and is rarely screened.

===Unproduced film projects===

&quot;Northwest Passage (Book 2)&quot;: Vidor attempted to make a sequel to his film &quot;Northwest Passage&quot; in which Rogers&#x27; Rangers find the Northwest Passage, although filming never began because author Kenneth Roberts refused to cooperate with the project, and because MGM thought the cost in making the first film in Technicolor had proven prohibitive enough.

&quot;Bright Light&quot; (late 1950s): a biographical study of Christian Science founder Mary Baker Eddy.

&quot;Conquest&quot; (formerly The Milly Story): In 1960, Vidor resumed efforts to make a sound version of his 1919 &quot;The Turn in the Road&quot;. His reconceived screenplay concerns a Hollywood director disillusioned with the film industry who inherits a gas station from his father in the fictional Colorado town of &quot;Arcadia&quot;. The script&#x27;s dialogue contains oblique references to a number of Vidor&#x27;s silent films including (&quot;The Big Parade&quot; (1925) and &quot;The Crowd&quot; (1928)). &quot;Conquest&quot; introduces a mysterious young woman, &quot;a feminine archetype&quot; (a figure in Jungian philosophy) who serves as &quot;the answer to everyone&#x27;s problems&quot; while pumping gas at the station. She disappears suddenly, leaving the director inspired, and he returns to Hollywood. Impressed by Italian director Federico Fellini&#x27;s &quot;8 Â½&quot; (1963), Vidor briefly corresponded with Fellini while writing &quot;Conquest&quot;. Vidor soon abandoned his 15-year effort to make the &quot;unfashionable&quot; movie, despite Sid Grauman â like Vidor an adherent to Christian Science â having purchased the rights. Even the modest budgetary requests were rejected by the tiny Allied Artists and they dropped the project.

&quot;The Marble Faun&quot;: a &quot;quite faithful&quot; version of the 1860 story by Nathaniel Hawthorne.

&quot;The Crowd&quot;: Vidor developed revisions of his 1928 silent masterpiece, including a 1960s sequel of Ann Head&#x27;s 1967 novel &quot;Mr and Mrs Bo Jo Jones&quot; (made as a TV feature without his input), and in the early 1970s another effort, &quot;Brother Jon&quot;.

&quot;A Man Called Cervantes&quot;: Vidor was involved in script writing for an adaption of Bruno Frank&#x27;s novel, but withdrew from the project, unhappy with script changes. The movie was shot and released in 1967 as &quot;Cervantes&quot;, but Vidor withdrew his name from the production.

&quot;William Desmond Taylor&quot;: Vidor researched the murder of silent era actor-director William Desmond Taylor, killed under mysterious circumstances in 1922. Though no screenplay was forthcoming, author Sidney D. Kirkpatrick alleges in his novel, &quot;A Cast of Killers&quot; (1986), that Vidor solved the murder.

&quot;The Actor&quot;: In 1979, Vidor sought financing for a biography of the ill-fated James Murray, star of Vidor&#x27;s &quot;The Crowd&quot; (1928).

====Academic Presentations====

Vidor lectured occasionally on film production and directing in the late 1950s and the 1960s at the University of California, Los Angeles and the University of Southern California. He published a non-technical handbook providing anecdotes from his film career, &quot;On Film Making&quot;, in 1972.

On at least one occasion, Vidor made a presentation to film historian Arthur Knight&#x27;s class at USC.

===Vidor as actor: &quot;Love and Money&quot; (1982)===

Vidor served as an &#x27;extra&quot; or made cameo appearances during his film career. An early film still exists from an unidentified Hotex Motion Picture Company silent short made in 1914, when he was 19 years old (he wears a Keystone Cop costume and false beard). While attempting to break into Hollywood as a director and screenwriter, Vidor took &quot;bit parts&quot; for Vitagraph Studios and Inceville in 1915â1916. During the height of his fame he made a number of cameo appearances in his own films, including &quot;The Patsy&quot; in 1926 and &quot;Our Daily Bread&quot; in 1934. 
He did not appear as a featured actor until 1981, at the age of 85. Vidor provided a &quot;charming&quot; tongue-in-cheek portrayal of Walter Klein, a senile grandfather, in director James Toback&#x27;s &quot;Love and Money&quot;. Vidor&#x27;s motivation in accepting the role was a desire to observe contemporary movie-making technology. &quot;Love and Money&quot; was released in 1982, shortly before Vidor&#x27;s death.

==Personal life==

In 1944 Vidor, a Republican, joined the anti-communist Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals.

Vidor published his autobiography, &quot;A Tree is a Tree&quot;, in 1953. This book&#x27;s title is inspired by an incident early in Vidor&#x27;s Hollywood career. Vidor wanted to film a movie in the locations where its story was set, a decision which would have greatly added to the film&#x27;s production budget. A budget-minded producer told him, &quot;A rock is a rock. A tree is a tree. Shoot it in Griffith Park&quot; (a nearby public space which was frequently used for filming exterior shots).

King Vidor was a Christian Scientist and wrote occasionally for church publications.

===Marriages===
Vidor was married three times and had three daughters:
# Florence Arto (m. 1915â1924)
#:*(later married Jascha Heifetz)
#* Suzanne (1918â2003)
#:*(adopted by Jascha Heifetz)

<text>Ginkgo biloba, commonly known as ginkgo or gingko ( ), also known as the maidenhair tree, is a species of gymnosperm tree native to East Asia. It is the last living species in the order Ginkgoales, which first appeared over 290 million years ago, and fossils very similar to the living species, belonging to the genus &quot;Ginkgo&quot;, extend back to the Middle Jurassic epoch approximately 170 million years ago. The tree was cultivated early in human history and remains commonly planted, and is widely regarded as a living fossil.

The plant may be toxic or allergenic in certain cases. Leaf extract is commonly used as a dietary supplement, but there is insufficient clinical evidence that it supports human health or is effective against any disease.

==Description==
Ginkgos are large trees, normally reaching a height of , with some specimens in China being over . The tree has an angular crown and long, somewhat erratic branches, and is usually deep-rooted and resistant to wind and snow damage. Young trees are often tall and slender, and sparsely branched; the crown becomes broader as the tree ages. A combination of resistance to disease, insect-resistant wood, and the ability to form aerial roots and sprouts makes ginkgos durable, with some specimens claimed to be more than 2,500Â years old.

===Leaves===

The leaves are unique among seed plants, being fan-shaped with veins radiating out into the leaf blade, sometimes bifurcating (splitting), but never anastomosing to form a network. Two veins enter the leaf blade at the base and fork repeatedly in two; this is known as dichotomous venation. The leaves are usually , but sometimes up to long. The old common name, &quot;maidenhair tree&quot;, derives from the leaves resembling pinnae of the maidenhair fern, &quot;Adiantum capillus-veneris&quot;. Ginkgos are prized for their autumn foliage, which is a deep saffron yellow.

Leaves of long shoots are usually notched or lobed, but only from the outer surface, between the veins. They are borne both on the more rapidly growing branch tips, where they are alternate and spaced out, and also on the short, stubby spur shoots, where they are clustered at the tips. Leaves are green both on the top and bottom and have stomata on both sides. During autumn, the leaves turn a bright yellow and then fall, sometimes within a short space of time (one to fifteenÂ days). Leaves of the variety or forma &quot;G. b. tubifolia&quot; have funnel-shaped leaves.

===Branches===
Ginkgo branches grow in length by growth of shoots with regularly spaced leaves, as seen on most trees. From the axils of these leaves, &quot;spur shoots&quot; (also known as short shoots) develop on second-year growth. Short shoots have short internodes (they may grow only one to two centimeters in several years) and their leaves are usually unlobed. They are short and knobby, and are arranged regularly on the branches except on first-year growth. Because of the short internodes, leaves appear to be clustered at the tips of short shoots, and reproductive structures are formed only on them (seeds and leaves are visible on short shoots). In ginkgos, as in other plants that possess them, short shoots allow the formation of new leaves in the older parts of the crown. After a number of years, a short shoot may change into a long (ordinary) shoot, or vice versa.

Ginkgo prefers full sun and grows best in environments that are well-watered and well-drained. The species shows a preference for disturbed sites; in the &quot;semiwild&quot; stands at Tianmu Mountains, many specimens are found along stream banks, rocky slopes, and cliff edges. Accordingly, ginkgo retains a prodigious capacity for vegetative growth. It is capable of sprouting from embedded buds near the base of the trunk (lignotubers, or basal chichi) in response to disturbances, such as soil erosion. Old specimens are also capable of producing aerial roots on the undersides of large branches in response to disturbances such as crown damage; these roots can lead to successful clonal reproduction upon contacting the soil. These strategies are evidently important in the persistence of ginkgo; in a survey of the &quot;semiwild&quot; stands remaining in Tianmushan, 40% of the specimens surveyed were multi-stemmed, and few saplings were present.

=== Reproduction ===
&quot;Ginkgo biloba&quot; is dioecious, with separate sexes, some trees being female and others being male. Male plants produce small pollen cones with sporophylls, each bearing two microsporangia spirally arranged around a central axis. Sex conversion, wherein certain branches of a tree change sexes, has been observed. This phenomenon is difficult to research because of its rarity as well as the practice of grafting female branches onto otherwise male trees that was common in 19th century Europe.

Female plants do not produce cones. Two ovules are formed at the end of a stalk, and after wind pollination, one or both develop into fruit-like structures containing seeds. The fruits are 1.5â2Â cm long, with a soft, fleshy, yellow-brown outer layer (the sarcotesta) that is attractive in appearance, but contains butyric acid (also known as butanoic acid) and smells foul like rancid butter or vomit when fallen. Beneath the sarcotesta is the hard sclerotesta (the &quot;shell&quot; of the seed) and a papery endotesta, with the nucellus surrounding the female gametophyte at the center.

The fertilization of ginkgo seeds occurs via motile sperm, as in cycads, ferns, mosses, and algae. The sperm are large (about 70â90Â micrometres) and are similar to the sperm of cycads, which are slightly larger. &quot;Ginkgo&quot; sperm were first discovered by the Japanese botanist Sakugoro Hirase in 1896. The sperm have a complex multi-layered structure, which is a continuous belt of basal bodies that form the base of several thousand flagella which have a cilia-like motion. The flagella/cilia apparatus pulls the body of the sperm forwards. The sperm have only a tiny distance to travel to the archegonia, of which there are usually two or three. Two sperm are produced, one of which successfully fertilizes the ovule. Fertilization of ginkgo seeds occurs just before or after they fall in early autumn. Embryos may develop in the seeds before or after they drop from the tree.

=== Genome ===
Chinese scientists published a draft genome of &quot;Ginkgo biloba&quot; in 2016. The tree has a large genome of 10.6Â billion DNA nucleobase &quot;letters&quot; (the human genome has three billion) and about 41,840Â predicted genes which enable a considerable number of antibacterial and chemical defense mechanisms. 76.58% of the assembled sequence turned out to be repetitive sequences.

In 2020, a study in China of ginkgo trees up to 667 years old showed little effects of aging, finding that the trees continued to grow with age and displayed no genetic evidence of senescence, and continued to make phytochemicals indefinitely.

=== Phytochemicals ===
Extracts of ginkgo leaves contain phenolic acids, proanthocyanidins, flavonoid glycosides, such as myricetin, kaempferol, isorhamnetin, and quercetin, and the terpene trilactones ginkgolides and bilobalides. The leaves also contain unique ginkgo biflavones, alkylphenols, and polyprenols.

== Taxonomy ==
The older Chinese name for this plant is éæ, meaning &quot;silver fruit&quot;, pronounced &quot;yÃ­nguÇ&quot; in Mandarin or &quot;Ngan-gwo&quot; in Cantonese. The current commonly used names are ç½æ (), meaning &quot;white fruit&quot;, and (), meaning &quot;silver apricot&quot;. The name éæ was translated into Japanese as ã¤ãã§ã¦ () or ãããªã () and into Korean as ìí ().

Carl Linnaeus described the species in 1771, the specific epithet &quot;biloba&quot; derived from the Latin &quot;bis&quot;, &quot;twice&quot; and &quot;loba&quot;, &quot;lobed&quot;, referring to the shape of the leaves. Two names for the species recognise the botanist Richard Salisbury, a placement by Nelson as &quot;Pterophyllus salisburiensis&quot; and the earlier &quot;Salisburia adiantifolia&quot; proposed by James Edward Smith. The epithet of the latter may have been intended to denote a characteristic resembling &quot;Adiantum&quot;, the genus of maidenhair ferns.

The scientific name &quot;Ginkgo&quot; is the result of a spelling error that occurred three centuries ago. &quot;Kanji&quot; typically have multiple pronunciations in Japanese, and the characters éæ used for &quot;ginnan&quot; can also be pronounced &quot;ginkyÅ&quot;. Engelbert Kaempfer, the first Westerner to investigate the species in 1690, wrote down this pronunciation in the notes that he later used for the &quot;Amoenitates Exoticae&quot; (1712) with the &quot;awkward&quot; spelling &quot;ginkgo&quot;. This appears to be a simple error of Kaempfer; taking his spelling of other Japanese words containing the syllable &quot;kyÅ&quot; into account, a more precise romanization following his writing habits would have been &quot;ginkio&quot; or &quot;ginkjo&quot;. Linnaeus, who relied on Kaempfer when dealing with Japanese plants, adopted the spelling given in Kaempfer&#x27;s &quot;Flora Japonica&quot; (&quot;Amoenitates Exoticae&quot;, p.Â 811). Kaempfer&#x27;s drawing can be found in Hori&#x27;s article.

===Classification===
The relationship of ginkgo to other plant groups remains uncertain. It has been placed loosely in the divisions Spermatophyta and Pinophyta, but no consensus has been reached. Since its seeds are not protected by an ovary wall, it can morphologically be considered a gymnosperm. The apricot-like structures produced by female ginkgo trees are technically not fruits, but are seeds that have a shell consisting of a soft and fleshy section (the sarcotesta), and a hard section (the sclerotesta). The sarcotesta has a strong smell that most people find unpleasant.

The ginkgo is classified in its own division, the Ginkgophyta, comprising the single class Ginkgoopsida, order Ginkgoales, family Ginkgoaceae, genus &quot;Ginkgo&quot; and is the only extant species within this group. It is one of the best-known examples of a living fossil, because Ginkgoales other than &quot;G. biloba&quot; are not known from the fossil record after the Pliocene.

===Phylogeny===
&quot;Ginkgo biloba&quot; is a living fossil, with fossils recognisably related to modern ginkgo from the early Permian (Cisuralian), with likely oldest record being that of &quot;Trichopitys&quot; from the earliest Permian (Asselian) of France, over 290 million years old. The closest living relatives of the clade are the cycads, which share with the extant &quot;G. biloba&quot; the characteristic of motile sperm.

Such plants with leaves that have more than four veins per segment have customarily been assigned to the taxon &quot;Ginkgo&quot;, while the taxon &quot;Baiera&quot; is used to classify those with fewer than four veins per segment. &quot;Sphenobaiera&quot; has been used for plants with a broadly wedge-shaped leaf that lacks a distinct leaf stem.

====Rise and decline====
Fossils attributable to the genus &quot;Ginkgo&quot; first appeared in the Middle Jurassic. The genus &quot;Ginkgo&quot; diversified and spread throughout Laurasia during the Jurassic and Early Cretaceous.

The Ginkgophyta declined in diversity as the Cretaceous progressed, and by the Paleocene, &quot;Ginkgo adiantoides&quot; was the only &quot;Ginkgo&quot; species left in the Northern Hemisphere, while a markedly different (and poorly documented) form persisted in the Southern Hemisphere. Along with that of ferns, cycads, and cycadeoids, the species diversity in the genus &quot;Ginkgo&quot; drops through the Cretaceous, at the same time the flowering plants were on the rise; this supports the hypothesis that, over time, flowering plants with better adaptations to disturbance displaced &quot;Ginkgo&quot; and its associates.

At the end of the Pliocene, &quot;Ginkgo&quot; fossils disappeared from the fossil record everywhere except in a small area of central China, where the modern species survived.

====Limited number of species====
It is doubtful whether the Northern Hemisphere fossil species of &quot;Ginkgo&quot; can be reliably distinguished. Given the slow pace of evolution and morphological similarity between members of the genus, there may have been only one or two species existing in the Northern Hemisphere through the entirety of the Cenozoic: present-day &quot;G.Â biloba&quot; (including &quot;G.Â adiantoides&quot;) and &quot;G.Â gardneri&quot; from the Paleocene of Scotland.

At least morphologically, &quot;G. gardneri&quot; and the Southern Hemisphere species are the only known post-Jurassic taxa that can be unequivocally recognised. The remainder may have been ecotypes or subspecies. The implications would be that &quot;G. biloba&quot; had occurred over an extremely wide range, had remarkable genetic flexibility and, though evolving genetically, never showed much speciation.

While it may seem improbable that a single species may exist as a contiguous entity for many millions of years, many of the ginkgo&#x27;s life-history parameters fit: Extreme longevity; slow reproduction rate; (in Cenozoic and later times) a wide, apparently contiguous, but steadily contracting distribution; and (as far as can be demonstrated from the fossil record) extreme ecological conservatism (restriction to disturbed streamside environments).

====Adaptation to a single environment====
Given the slow rate of evolution of the genus, &quot;Ginkgo&quot; possibly represents a pre-angiosperm strategy for survival in disturbed streamside environments. &quot;Ginkgo&quot; evolved in an era before flowering plants, when ferns, cycads, and cycadeoids dominated disturbed streamside environments, forming low, open, shrubby canopies. &quot;Ginkgo&quot; large seeds and habit of &quot;bolting&quot; â growing to a height of 10Â meters before elongating its side branches â may be adaptations to such an environment.

Modern-day &quot;G. biloba&quot; grows best in environments that are well-watered and drained, and the extremely similar fossil &quot;Ginkgo&quot; favored similar environments: The sediment record at the majority of fossil &quot;Ginkgo&quot; localities indicates it grew primarily in disturbed environments, such as along streams. &quot;Ginkgo&quot;, therefore, presents an &quot;ecological paradox&quot; because while it possesses some favorable traits for living in disturbed environments (clonal reproduction) many of its other life-history traits are the opposite of those exhibited by modern plants that thrive in disturbed settings (slow growth, large seed size, late reproductive maturity).

===Etymology===
The genus name is regarded as a misspelling of the Japanese pronunciation () for the kanji meaning &quot;silver apricot&quot;, which is found in Chinese herbology literature such as (Daily Use Materia Medica) (1329) and &quot;Compendium of Materia Medica&quot; published in 1578.

Despite its spelling, which is due to a complicated etymology including a transcription error, &quot;ginkgo&quot; is usually pronounced , which has given rise to the common alternative spelling &quot;gingko&quot;. The spelling pronunciation is also documented in some dictionaries.

Engelbert Kaempfer first introduced the spelling &quot;ginkgo&quot; in his book of 1712. It is considered that he may have misspelled &quot;Ginkjo&quot; or &quot;Ginkio&quot; (both consistent with his treatment of Japanese in the same work) as &quot;Ginkgo&quot;. This misspelling was included by Linnaeus in his book and has become the name of the tree&#x27;s genus. The specific epithet is New Latin for &quot;two-lobed&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==

Although &quot;Ginkgo biloba&quot; and other species of the genus were once widespread throughout the world, its habitat had shrunk by twoÂ million years ago.

For centuries, it was thought to be extinct in the wild, but is now a common tree cultivated throughout eastern China, Korea, and Japan. Many municipalities in Korea and Japan use Ginkgos as street trees, and Ginkgo leaves are the emblem of prominent educational institutions such as the University of Tokyo and Sungkyunkwan University in South Korea. Despite their widespread habitat, high genetic uniformity exists among ginkgo trees, with some Chinese scholars suggesting that ginkgo trees in these areas may have been planted and preserved by Chinese monks over about 1,000Â years. A study demonstrates a greater genetic diversity in Southwestern China populations, supporting glacial refugia in mountains surrounding the eastern Tibetan Plateau, where several old-growth candidates for wild populations have been reported. Whether native ginkgo populations still exist has not been demonstrated unequivocally, but there is genetic evidence that these Southwestern populations may be wild, as well as evidence that the largest and oldest &quot;G. biloba&quot; trees may be older than surrounding human settlements.

Where it occurs in the wild, Ginkgo is found infrequently in deciduous forests and valleys on acidic loess (i.e. fine, silty soil) with good drainage. The soil it inhabits is typically in the pH range of 5.0 to 5.5.

==Cultivation==

Ginkgo has long been cultivated in China. It is common in the southern third of the country. Some planted trees at temples are believed to be over 1,500Â years old. The first record of Europeans encountering it is in 1690 in Japanese temple gardens, where the tree was seen by the German botanist Engelbert Kaempfer. Because of its status in Buddhism and Confucianism, the ginkgo has also been widely planted in Korea and in Japan since the 14th century; in both areas, some naturalization has occurred, with ginkgos seeding into natural forests. Ginkgo has been commonly cultivated in North America for over 200Â years and in Europe for close to 300, but during that time, it has never become significantly naturalized.

&quot;G. biloba&quot; is also commonly manually planted in cities across the United States and Europe. This species is highly tolerant to pollution and serves as a visually appealing, shade-providing tree in many cities and gardens.

Many intentionally planted ginkgos are male cultivars grafted onto plants propagated from seed, because the male trees will not produce the malodorous seeds. The popular cultivar &#x27;Autumn Gold&#x27; is a clone of a male plant.

The disadvantage of male &quot;Ginkgo biloba&quot; trees is that they are highly allergenic. They have an OPALS (Ogren Plant Allergy Scale) rating of 7 (out of 10), whereas female trees, which can produce no pollen, have an OPALS allergy scale rating of 2.

Female cultivars include &#x27;Liberty Splendor&#x27;, &#x27;Santa Cruz&#x27;, and &#x27;Golden Girl&#x27;, the latter so named because of the striking yellow color of its leaves in the fall; all female cultivars release zero pollen.

Many cultivars are listed in the literature in the UK, of which the compact &#x27;Troll&#x27; has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

Ginkgos adapt well to the urban environment, tolerating pollution and confined soil spaces. They rarely have disease problems, even in urban conditions, and are attacked by few insects.

Ginkgos are popular subjects for growing as miniature landscapes known as &quot;penjing&quot; and &quot;bonsai&quot;; they can be kept artificially small and tended over centuries. The trees are easy to propagate from seed.

===Hiroshima===
Extreme examples of the ginkgo&#x27;s tenacity may be seen in Hiroshima, Japan, where six trees growing between from the 1945 atom bomb explosion were among the few living organisms in the area to survive the blast. Although almost all other plants (and animals) in the area were killed, the ginkgos, though charred, survived and were soon healthy again, among other &quot;hibakujumoku&quot; (trees that survived the blast).

The six trees are still alive: They are marked with signs at temple (planted in 1850), Shukkei-en (planted about 1740), JÅsei-ji (planted 1900), at the former site of Senda Elementary School near Miyukibashi, at the MyÅjÅin temple, and an Edo period-cutting at Anraku-ji temple.

===1000-year-old ginkgo at Tsurugaoka HachimangÅ«===

At the Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gÅ«&#x27;s shrine in the city of Kamakura, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan, an ancient ginkgo tree stands beside the stone entry staircase. According to legend, the tree has stood there since the founding of the shrine circa 1063. The tree is nicknamed &quot;kakure-ichÅ&quot; (hiding ginkgo), because of an Edo period legend in which shÅgun Minamoto no Sanetomo was assassinated in 1219 by his nephew, KugyÅ, who had hidden behind the tree to ambush the shÅgun. 

Modern scholarship has established that ginkgos arrived from China in the 14th century, and a 1990 tree-ring measurement indicated the &quot;kakure-ichÅ&#x27;s&quot; age to be about 500 years.

On 10 March 2010, the tree blew down in a storm, but the stump has since sprouted vigorously.

===1,400-year-old ginkgo tree at Gu Guanyin===

The grounds of the Buddhist temple at Gu Guanyin in the Zhongnan Mountains feature a ginkgo tree reputed to be 1,400 years old. The tree itself is a popular tourist attraction.

==Toxicity==
Since 2016, &quot;G. biloba&quot; extract is classified as a possible human carcinogen (group 2B) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer.

When eaten in large quantities or over a long period, the seeds may cause poisoning by ginkgotoxin (4&#x27;-O-methylpyridoxine, MPN), as found in a few case reports. A heat-stable compound not destroyed by cooking, MPN may cause convulsions, which were alleviated by treatment with pyridoxine phosphate (vitamin B6), according to limited studies.

Some people are sensitive to the chemicals in the sarcotesta, the outer fleshy coating. These people should handle the seeds with care when preparing the seeds for consumption, wearing disposable gloves. The symptoms are allergic contact dermatitis, or blisters similar to that caused by contact with poison ivy.

Side effects of using ginkgo supplements may include increased risk of bleeding, gastrointestinal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, dizziness, heart palpitations, and restlessness. Although use of standardized &quot;Ginkgo biloba&quot; leaf extracts in moderate amounts appears to be safe, excessive use may have undesirable effects, especially in terms of drug interactions. The dosing of anticoagulants, such as warfarin or antiplatelet medication, may be adversely affected by using ginkgo supplements.

According to a systemic review, the effects of ginkgo on pregnant women may include increased bleeding time, and there is inadequate information about safety during lactation.

Ginkgo pollen may produce allergic reactions. &quot;Ginkgo biloba&quot; leaves and sarcotesta contain ginkgolic acids which are highly allergenic long-chain alkylphenols, such as bilobol or adipostatin A (bilobol is a substance related to anacardic acid from cashew nut shells and urushiols present in poison ivy and other &quot;Toxicodendron&quot; spp.) Individuals with a history of strong allergic reactions to poison ivy, mangoes, cashews and other alkylphenol-producing plants are more likely to experience an allergic reaction when consuming non-standardized ginkgo-containing preparations. The level of these allergens in standardized pharmaceutical preparations from &quot;Ginkgo biloba&quot; was restricted to 5 ppm by the Commission E of the former Federal German Health Authority. Overconsumption of seeds from &quot;Ginkgo biloba&quot; can deplete vitamin B6.

== Uses ==
The wood of &quot;Ginkgo biloba&quot; is used to make furniture, chessboards, carving, and casks for making sakÃ©; the wood is fire-resistant and slow to decay.

===Culinary===


Despite the health risks in certain cases, the nut-like kernels of the seeds are esteemed in Asia, and are a traditional ingredient in Chinese food. Ginkgo nuts are used in &quot;congee&quot;, and are often served at special occasions such as weddings and the Chinese New Year (as part of the vegetarian dish called Buddha&#x27;s delight). Japanese cooks add ginkgo seeds (called &quot;ginnan&quot;) to dishes such as &quot;chawanmushi&quot;, and cooked seeds are often eaten along with other dishes. Grilled ginkgo nuts with salt are also a popular item at izakayas as a healthy snack with beer and other Japanese food. In Korea, ginkgo nuts are stir-fried and eaten, or are used to garnish foods such as sinseonro.

===Medical research===
Although extracts of &quot;Ginkgo biloba&quot; leaf are often marketed as cognitive enhancers, there is no evidence for effects on memory or attention in healthy people. Systematic reviews have shown there is no evidence for effectiveness of ginkgo in treating high blood pressure, menopause-related cognitive decline, tinnitus, post-stroke recovery, or altitude sickness. 

There is weak preliminary evidence for ginkgo affecting dementia and tardive dyskinesia symptoms in people with schizophrenia.

===Traditional medicine===
Ginkgo has been used in traditional Chinese medicine since at least the 11th century CE. Ginkgo seeds, leaves, and nuts have traditionally been used to treat various ailments, such as dementia, asthma, bronchitis, and kidney and bladder disorders. However, there is no conclusive evidence that ginkgo is useful for any of these conditions.

The European Medicines Agency Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products concluded that medicines containing ginkgo leaf can be used for treating mild age-related dementia and mild peripheral vascular disease in adults after serious conditions have been excluded by a physician.

==In culture==

The ginkgo leaf is the symbol of the Urasenke school of Japanese tea ceremony. The tree is the official tree of the Japanese capital of Tokyo, and the symbol of Tokyo is a ginkgo leaf. Since 1948, the badge of Tokyo University has been two ginkgo leaves (designed by Shoichi Hoshino), which became the university logo in 2004 with a redesign. The logo of Osaka University has been a simplified ginkgo leaf since 1991 when designer Ikko Tanaka created it for the university&#x27;s sixtieth anniversary. 

In professional sumo, wrestlers ranked in the two highest divisions ( and ) wear an elaborate topknot called because it resembles the leaf of the ginkgo tree.

Ginkgo is an official tree of Seoul since 1971, designated by the Seoul Metropolitan Government.

<text>Ginkgoales are a gymnosperm order containing only one extant species: &quot;Ginkgo biloba&quot;, the ginkgo tree. The order has a long fossil record extending back to the Early Permian around 300 million years ago from fossils found worldwide. The order was a common component of Permian and Triassic flora before the super dominance of conifers. 

== Evolution ==
Ginkgophyta and Cycadophyta have a very ancient divergence dating to the early Carboniferous. The earliest representative of the group in the fossil record is probably &quot;Trichopitys&quot; from the Asselian (299-293 million years ago) of France. The earliest representatives of &quot;Ginkgo&quot;, represented by reproductive organs similar to the living species, first appear in the Middle Jurassic, alongside other, related forms such as &quot;Yimaia&quot; and &quot;Karkenia&quot;, which have differently arranged reproductive structures and seeds associated with &quot;Ginkgo&quot;-like leaves. The diversity of Ginkgoales declined during the Late Cretaceous and Cenozoic, coincident with the rise of flowering plants, with all Ginkgophytes aside from &quot;Ginkgo&quot; being extinct by the end of the Cretaceous. The only remaining Ginkgophyte was &quot;Ginkgo adiantoides&quot; â a polymorphic species. Modern &quot;Ginkgo&quot; trees are native to China.

== Reproduction ==
&quot;Ginkgo&quot; trees produce ovulate and pollen-bearing structures. These structures are dioecious, in that male and female structures come from different &quot;Ginkgo&quot; plants. The pollen organs are very similar to angiospermous catkins. They come from the axils of the bud scales, and the leaves from the &quot;Ginkgo&quot; tree spur shoots. Pollen is contained in sacs of two to four at the tips of sporophylls on the strobiloid. Ovules of &quot;Ginkgo&quot; trees come from stalks from leaf axils on the short shoots, each containing two ovules. The ovule is fertilized by the flagellated male gametes, which can move about freely. This fertilization process begins on the tree itself in the spring. The swollen fruit-like ovules, about 2â3Â cm in diameter, fall from the tree in the fall, and fertilization continues into the winter/spring. This ovule contains a single large seed, similar to that of a cycad.

== Morphology ==

=== Ginkgophyte wood ===
Fossils that appear &quot;Ginkgo&quot;-like are filed under a morphogenus called &quot;Ginkgoxylon, Ginkgomyeloxylon,&quot; or &quot;Protoginkgoxylon&quot;. Fossilized ginkgophyte wood is not commonly found in the record, possibly because it degrades easily, and possibly because it is difficult to tell apart from the much more pervasive conifer samples. Like conifer wood, it has secondary thin-walled xylem and a primary vascular system composed of eustele and bifacial vascular cambium. The tracheids in the secondary xylem rays have pitting that occurs only on the walls and is circularly bordered.
=== Ginkgophyte foliage ===
&quot;Ginkgophyte&quot; foliage has stayed largely consistent since the Mesozoic. Its historically wide territory makes it an important leaf morphology, and its unique stomata and isotopic profile give it a key role in recreations of the Mesozoic and Cenozoic. Leaf fossils that resemble the Ginkgophytes are known as &quot;Ginkgoites&quot;. There are similar, now extinct, morphogens, such as &quot;Sphenobaiera&quot;, which describes fan-shaped, deeply divided leaves without clear petioles.

The distinctive shape of the modern &quot;Ginkgo biloba&quot; gives the impression of a very narrow leaf morphology, but the group is varied and diverse. The genus &quot;Ginkgo&quot; by itself contains a range of morphologies. &quot;Ginkgo digitata&quot;, from the Jurassic, has long, wedge-shaped laminae with the intercostal regions covered in stomata and resin bodies, while &quot;G. pluripartita&quot; has at most 2Â cm-long leaves and is intercostally hypostomatic.

<text>The Ginkgoaceae is a family of gymnosperms which appeared during the Mesozoic Era, of which the only extant representative is &quot;Ginkgo biloba&quot;, which is for this reason sometimes regarded as a living fossil. Formerly, however, there were several other genera, and forests of ginkgo existed. Because leaves can take such diverse forms within a single species, these are a poor measure of diversity, although differing structures of wood point to the existence of diverse ginkgo forests in ancient times.

<text>The lycophytes, when broadly circumscribed, are a group of vascular plants that include the clubmosses. They are sometimes placed in a division Lycopodiophyta or Lycophyta or in a subdivision Lycopodiophytina. They are one of the oldest lineages of extant (living) vascular plants; the group contains extinct plants that have been dated from the Silurian (ca. 425 million years ago). Lycophytes were some of the dominating plant species of the Carboniferous period, and included the tree-like Lepidodendrales, some of which grew over in height, although extant lycophytes are relatively small plants.

The scientific names and the informal English names used for this group of plants are ambiguous. For example, &quot;Lycopodiophyta&quot; and the shorter &quot;Lycophyta&quot; as well as the informal &quot;lycophyte&quot; may be used to include the extinct zosterophylls or to exclude them.

==Description==
Lycophytes reproduce by spores and have alternation of generations in which (like other vascular plants) the sporophyte generation is dominant. Some lycophytes are homosporous while others are heterosporous. When broadly circumscribed, the lycophytes represent a line of evolution distinct from that leading to all other vascular plants, the euphyllophytes, such as ferns, gymnosperms and flowering plants. They are defined by two synapomorphies: lateral rather than terminal sporangia (often kidney-shaped or reniform), and exarch protosteles, in which the protoxylem is outside the metaxylem rather than vice versa. The extinct zosterophylls have at most only flap-like extensions of the stem (&quot;enations&quot;) rather than leaves, whereas extant lycophyte species have microphylls, leaves that have only a single vascular trace (vein), rather than the much more complex megaphylls of other vascular plants. The extinct genus &quot;Asteroxylon&quot; represents a transition between these two groups: it has a vascular trace leaving the central protostele, but this extends only to the base of the enation. See .

Zosterophylls and extant lycophytes are all relatively small plants, but some extinct species, such as the Lepidodendrales, were tree-like, and formed extensive forests that dominated the landscape and contributed to the formation of coal.

==Taxonomy==
===Classification===
In the broadest circumscription of the lycophytes, the group includes the extinct zosterophylls as well as the extant (living) lycophytes and their closest extinct relatives. The names and ranks used for this group vary considerably. Some sources use the names &quot;Lycopodiophyta&quot; or the shorter &quot;Lycophyta&quot; to include zosterophylls as well as extant lycophytes and their closest extinct relatives, while others use these names to exclude zosterophylls. The name &quot;Lycopodiophytina&quot; has also been used in the inclusive sense. English names, such as &quot;lycophyte&quot;, &quot;lycopodiophyte&quot; or &quot;lycopod&quot;, are similarly ambiguous, and may refer to the broadly defined group or only to the extant lycophytes and their closest extinct relatives.

The consensus classification produced by the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification in 2016 (PPGÂ I) places all extant (living) lycophytes in the class Lycopodiopsida. There are around 1,290 to 1,340 such species. For more information on the classification of extant lycophytes, see .

===Phylogeny===
A major cladistic study of land plants was published in 1997 by Kenrick and Crane. In 2004, Crane et al. published some simplified cladograms, based on a number of figures in Kenrick and Crane (1997). Their cladogram for the lycophytes is reproduced below (with some branches collapsed into &#x27;basal groups&#x27; to reduce the size of the diagram).

In this view, the &quot;zosterophylls&quot; comprise a paraphyletic group, ranging from forms like &quot;Hicklingia&quot;, which had bare stems, to forms like &quot;Sawdonia&quot; and &quot;Nothia&quot;, whose stems are covered with unvascularized spines or enations. The genus &quot;Renalia&quot; illustrates the problems in classifying early land plants. It has characteristics both of the non-lycophyte rhyniophytes â terminal rather than lateral sporangia â and of the zosterophylls â kidney-shaped sporangia opening along the distal margin.

A rather different view is presented in a 2013 analysis by Hao and Xue. Their preferred cladogram shows the zosterophylls and associated genera basal to both the lycopodiopsids and the euphyllophytes, so that there is no clade corresponding to the broadly defined group of lycophytes used by other authors.
Some extinct orders of lycophytes fall into the same group as the extant orders. Different sources use varying numbers and names of the extinct orders. The following phylogram shows a likely relationship between some of the proposed Lycopodiopsida orders.
==Evolution of microphylls==

Within the broadly defined lycophyte group, species placed in the class Lycopodiopsida are distinguished from species placed in the Zosterophyllopsida by the possession of microphylls. Some zosterophylls, such as the Devonian &quot;Zosterophyllum myretonianum&quot;, had smooth stems (axes). Others, such as &quot;Sawdonia ornata&quot;, had flap-like extensions on the stems (&quot;enations&quot;), but without any vascular tissue. &quot;Asteroxylon&quot;, identified as an early lycopodiopsid, had vascular traces that extended to the base of the enations. Species in the genus &quot;Leclercqia&quot; had fully vascularized microphylls. These are considered to be stages in the evolution of microphylls.

<doc id="67972" wikidata="Q457251" url="?curid=67972" title="Urolagnia">
<text>Urolagnia, also known as urophilia, is a paraphilia in which sexual excitement is associated with urine or urination. Etymologically, the term comes from the Greek , meaning &#x27;urine&#x27;, and , meaning &#x27;lust&#x27;. A golden shower is slang for the practice of urinating on another person for sexual pleasure, while the term watersports is more inclusive of other sexual acts involving urine. 

Sexual acts may involve urine being ingested or bathed in, urinating on another person or item (such as bedwetting), and self-soiling. Other expressions of urolagnia may primarily involve the smell of urine.

Omorashi, a fetish for having a full bladder or someone else experiencing the discomfort or pain of a full bladder, is sometimes considered part of urolagnia.

==Frequency==
A 2007 study counted members of Internet discussion groups with the word fetish in their name; of the groups about body parts or features, 9% belonged to groups about body fluids (including but not limited to urolagnia.) 

Jennifer Eve Rehor of San Francisco State University points out that such data as exists on what she calls &quot;unconventional&quot; or &quot;kink&quot; sexual behavior is generally problematic because of the way that it has been collected, through criminal and clinical case studies. Behavior that appears neither in criminal trials nor in clinical studies (for example, because the individuals concerned do not commonly seek professional help) is therefore under-reported. Rehor therefore surveyed 1,764 female participants in &quot;kink&quot; behavior (mostly association with BDSM) in 2010â11, receiving 1,580 valid responses. What Rehor calls &quot;urine play&quot; is relatively infrequent, with only 36.52% of her sample reporting having done it or having had it done to them. In contrast, 93.99% of her sample reported having done spanking or having had it done to them, and 61.96% reported having used or been exposed to feathers/fur. It is impossible to extrapolate Rehor&#x27;s data onto the general population, as the habits of the general population are different than participants in âkink&quot;, but her study does give a guide to prevalence in the North American BDSM community.

In Channel 4&#x27;s 2017 nationwide Great British Sex survey, watersports (meaning urolagnia) was ranked ninth in popularity among sexual fetishes in the United Kingdom.

==In media==
A table in Larry Townsend&#x27;s &quot;The Leatherman&#x27;s Handbook II&quot; (the 1983 second edition; the 1972 first edition did not include this list) which is generally considered authoritative states that a yellow handkerchief is a symbol for urolagnia in the handkerchief code, which is employed usually among gay male casual-sex seekers or BDSM practitioners in the United States, Canada, Australia and Europe. Wearing the handkerchief on the left indicates the top, dominant, or active partner; on the right indicates the bottom, submissive, or passive partner. However, negotiation with a prospective partner remains important because, as Townsend noted, people may wear hankies of any color &quot;only because the idea of the hankie turns them on&quot; or &quot;may not even know what it means&quot;.

Sex scenes depicted by Bill Schmeling routinely involve BDSM with an emphasis on bodily fluids, including urolagnia. Another notable artist that depicted urolagnia was Touko Laaksonen (&quot;Tom of Finland&quot;).

== In psychiatry ==
The DSM-III-R (1987) version of the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (DSM) renamed atypical paraphilia to paraphilia NOS (not otherwise specified), and provided seven nonexhaustive examples of NOS paraphilias, which included urolagnia. Other specified paraphilic disorder is the term currently used by the fifth edition of the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (DSM-5) to refer to any of the many other paraphilic disorders that are not explicitly named in the manual, including urolagnia. In order to be diagnosable, the interest must be recurrent and intense, present for at least six months, and cause marked distress or impairment in important areas of functioning. When a specific paraphilic disorder cannot be identified or the clinician chooses not to specify it for some other reason, the &quot;unspecified paraphilic disorder&quot; diagnosis may be used instead.

Paraphilias such as urolagnia have been described as fetishes. On 18 June 2018, the WHO (World Health Organization) published ICD-11, in which Fetishism is now removed as a psychiatric diagnosis. Moreover, discrimination against fetish-having (and BDSM) individuals is considered inconsistent with human rights principles endorsed by the United Nations and The World Health Organization.

== Physical health ==
The World Health Organization has found that the pathogens contained in urine rarely pose a health risk. However, it does caution that in areas where &quot;Schistosoma haematobium&quot;, a parasitic flatworm, is prevalent, it can be transmitted from person to person.

==Notable cases==
* Chuck Berry: American musician who was featured urinating on a woman in a sex tape, and was sued for videotaping dozens of women in the restroom of a restaurant he owned.
* Havelock Ellis: British sexologist who was reportedly impotent until at age sixty he discovered that he was aroused by the sight of a woman urinating.
* Albert Fish: an American serial killer, also known as The Grayman and The Boogeyman. He wrote several letters to widows with want-ads in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and described in detail women urinating on him, inside of him, and in cups so that he could drink it. He later forced children to drink urine.
* R. Kelly: American singer, sentenced to prison for, among other things, urinating on and sexually abusing a fourteen-year-old girl in a videotape.
* Ashley MacIsaac: Nova Scotian fiddler and singer. In 1996 he spoke with a &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; interviewer mentioning his sexual life, including his boyfriend and his taste for urolagnia. In 2003 he told an interviewer for the &quot;Montreal Mirror&quot; that he loves to have men urinate on him.
* Ricky Martin: a Puerto Rican singer. He gave an interview with &quot;Blender&quot; magazine in which he stated that he enjoyed &quot;giving the golden shower&quot;.
* Patrice O&#x27;Neal: American standup comedian who had on several occasions mentioned his appreciation for golden showers, even stating that his girlfriend noticing that his urine tasted like &quot;birthday cake&quot; is how he came to find out that he suffered from diabetes.
* Annie Sprinkle: an American porn actress, later turned sex educator and advocate for female sexual enjoyment. Her stage name is derived from her obsession with fluids.
* Troughman: an Australian noted in the Sydney media for lying down in urinal troughs at Sydney Mardi Gras parties and other events.
* Ian Watkins: the former lead singer for the Welsh rock band Lostprophets. Convicted in December 2013 of numerous child sex abuse charges, which include urolagnia.

<doc id="67988" wikidata="Q1541043" url="?curid=67988" title="Tomb of the Unknown Soldier">
<text>A Tomb of the Unknown Soldier or Tomb of the Unknown Warrior is a monument dedicated to the services of an unknown soldier and to the common memories of all soldiers killed in war. Such tombs are located in many nations and are usually high-profile national monuments. Throughout history, many soldiers have died in war with their remains being unidentified. Following World War I, a movement arose to commemorate these soldiers with a single tomb, containing the body of one such unidentified soldier.

== History ==

A shrine in Jinju, Korea, which commemorated those who died in defense of Korea during the Imjin War in 1592, has been described as the first Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. It is, however, more inclusive, in that it is a memorial to all who died in defense of the city against the forces of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, civilian as well as soldier. Beginning in 1593, when the Ministry of Rites received permission to perform a sacrifice for all who died in the battle, not only the identifiable bodies, the state offered sacrifices for the dead twice a year in spring and autumn until 1908, when the practice was ended by royal edict.

The first known monument of an unknown soldier in Europe is the () created in 1849 to commemorate the First Schleswig War, in Fredericia, Denmark.

=== France and the United Kingdom ===
During the First World War, the British and French armies who were allies during the war jointly decided to bury soldiers themselves. In the UK, under the Imperial War Graves Commission (now Commonwealth War Graves Commission), the Reverend David Railton had seen a grave marked by a rough cross while serving in the British Army as a chaplain on the Western Front, which bore the pencil-written legend &quot;An Unknown British Soldier&quot;.

He suggested (together with the French in their own country) the creation at a national level of a symbolic funeral and burial of an &quot;Unknown Warrior&quot;, proposing that the grave should in the UK include a national monument in the form of what is usually, but not in this particular case, a headstone. The idea received the support of the Dean of Westminster, Prime Minister David Lloyd George, and later from King George V, responding to a wave of public support. At the same time, a similar concern grew in France. In November 1916, a local officer of Le Souvenir franÃ§ais proposed the idea of burying &quot;an unknown soldier&quot; in the PanthÃ©on. A formal bill was presented in Parliament in November 1918. The decision was voted into law in September 1919.

The United Kingdom and France conducted services connected with their &#x27;monumental&#x27; graves (as presumably newly conceived, and in any case approved, by their respective armies) on Armistice Day 1920 (the burial itself taking place later in January of the following year in France). In the UK, the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior was created at Westminster Abbey, while in France &quot;La tombe du soldat inconnu&quot; was placed in the Arc de Triomphe.

=== Other countries ===
The idea of a symbolic Tomb of the Unknown Soldier then spread to other countries. In 1921, the United States unveiled its own Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Portugal its TÃºmulo do Soldado Desconhecido, and Italy its &quot;Tomba del Milite Ignoto&quot;. Other nations have followed the practice and created their own tombs.

In Chile and Ukraine, the second &#x27;unknown tombs&#x27; were unveiled to commemorate &quot;The Unknown Sailor&quot;.

In Serbia, soldiers of World War I are commemorated by the Monument to the Unknown Hero on the mountain of Avala.

In the Philippines, the &quot;Tomb of the Unknown Soldier&quot; at the &quot;Libingan ng mga Bayani&quot; (&quot;Cemetery of the Heroes&quot;) is the cemetery&#x27;s most prominent structure.

== Symbolism ==
The Tombs of the Unknown Soldiers typically contain the remains of a soldier who is unidentified (or &quot;known but to God&quot; as the stone is sometimes inscribed). These remains are considered impossible to identify, and so serve as a symbol for all of a country&#x27;s unknown dead wherever they fell in the war being remembered. The anonymity of the entombed soldier is the key symbolism of the monument; it could be the tomb of anyone who fell in service of the nation, and therefore serves as a monument symbolizing all of the sacrifices.

==Identification==

Many soldiers have been identified by DNA analysis. The first one to be analyzed was an airman from the Vietnam War.

== Examples ==
Tombs of the Unknown Soldiers from around the world and various wars include the following:
