<text>Anti-Arab racism, also called Anti-Arabism, Anti-Arab sentiment, or Arabophobia, refers to feelings and expressions of hostility, hatred, discrimination, fear, or prejudice toward Arab people, the Arab world or the Arabic language on the basis of an irrational disdain for their ethnic and cultural affiliation.

Notable historical instances of anti-Arab racism include the expulsion of the Moriscos from 1609 to 1614, the pacification of Algeria from 1830 to 1875, the Libyan Genocide from 1929 to 1934, the Nakba in Mandatory Palestine from 1947 to 1949, and the Zanzibar massacre in 1964. In the modern era, anti-Arabism is apparent in many nations, including the United States and Israel, as well as parts of Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas. In the United States, anti-Arab racism surged after the September 11 attacks, resulting in widespread racial profiling and hate crimes against Arab Americans. Arab citizens of Israel and Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories face institutionalized segregation and discrimination, which several scholars have characterized as a form of apartheid. Various advocacy organizations have been formed to protect the civil rights of individuals of Arab descent in the United States, such as the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee and the Council on American–Islamic Relations.

==Definition of Arab==

Arabs are people whose native language is Arabic. People of Arabic origin, in particular native English and French speakers of Arab ancestry in Europe and the Americas, often identify themselves as Arabs. Due to widespread practice of Islam among Arab populations, Anti-Arabism is commonly confused with Islamophobia.

There are prominent Arab non-Muslim minorities in the Arab world. These minorities include the Arab Christians in Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, Jordan, Egypt, Iraq, Kuwait and Bahrain, among other Arab countries. There are also sizable minorities of Arab Jews, Druze, Baháʼí, and nonreligious people.

==Historical anti-Arabism==

Anti-Arab prejudice is suggested by many events in history. In the Iberian Peninsula, when the &quot;Reconquista&quot; by the indigenous Christians from the Moorish colonists was completed with the fall of Granada, all non-Catholics were expelled. In 1492, Arab converts to Christianity, called Moriscos, were expelled from Spain to North Africa after being condemned by the Spanish Inquisition. The Spanish word &quot;moro&quot;, meaning &quot;moor&quot;, today carries a negative meaning.

After the annexation of the Muslim-ruled state of Hyderabad by India in 1948, about 7,000 Arabs were interned and deported.

The Zanzibar Revolution of January 12, 1964, ended the local Arab dynasty. As many as 17,000 Arabs were exterminated by black African revolutionaries, according to reports, and thousands of others fled the country.

In &quot;The Arabic Language and National Identity: a Study in Ideology&quot;, Yasir Suleiman notes of the writing of Tawfiq al-Fikayki that he uses the term &quot;shu&#x27;ubiyya&quot; to refer to movements he perceives to be anti-Arab, such as the Turkification movement in the Ottoman Empire, extreme-nationalist and Pan-Iranist movements in Iran and communism. The economic boom in Iran which lasted until 1979 led to an overall increase of Iranian nationalism sparking thousands of anti-Arab movements. In al-Fikayki&#x27;s view, the objectives of anti-Arabism are to attack Arab nationalism, pervert history, emphasize Arab regression, deny Arab culture, and generally be hostile to all things Arab. He concludes that, &quot;In all its various roles, anti-Arabism has adopted a policy of intellectual conquest as a means of penetrating Arab society and combatting Arab nationalism.&quot;

In early 20th and late 19th century when Palestinians and Syrians migrated to Latin America Arabophobia was common in these countries.

==Modern anti-Arabism==

===Algeria===
Anti-Arabism is a major element of movements known as Berberism that are widespread mainly amongst Algerians of Kabyle and other Berber origin. It has historic roots as Arabs are seen as invaders that occupied Algeria and destroyed its late Roman and early medieval civilization that was considered an integral part of the West; this invasion is considered to have been the source of the resettlement of Algeria&#x27;s Berber population in Kabylie and other mountainous areas. Regardless, the Kabyles and other Berbers have managed to preserve their culture and achieve high standards of living and education. Furthermore, many Berbers speak their language and French; are non religious, secular, or Evangelical Christian; and openly identify with the Western World. Many Berber Nationalists view Arabs as a hostile people intent on eradicating their own culture and nation. Berber social norms restrict marriage to someone of Arab ethnicity, although it is permitted to marry someone from other ethnic groups.

According to Lawrence Rosen, ethnic background is not a crucial factor in marriage between members of each group in North Africa, when compared to social and economic backgrounds. There are regular Hate incidents between Arabs and Berbers and Anti-Arabism has been accentuated by the Algerian government&#x27;s anti-Berber policies. Contemporary relations between Berbers and Arabs are sometimes tense, particularly in Algeria, where Berbers rebelled (1963–65, 2001) against Arab rule and have demonstrated and rioted against their cultural marginalization in the new founded state.

The Anti-Arab sentiments among Algerian Berbers (mainly from Kabylie) were always related to the reassertion of Kabyle identity. It began as an intellectual militant movement in schools, universities, and popular culture (mainly nationalistic songs). In addition to that, the authorities&#x27; efforts to promote development in Kabylie contributed to a boom of sorts in Tizi Ouzou, whose population almost doubled between 1966 and 1977, and to a greater degree of economic and social integration within the region had the contrary effect of strengthening a collective Berber consciousness and Anti-Arab sentiments.

Arabophobia can be seen at different levels of intellectual, social, and cultural life of some Berbers. After the Berberist crisis in 1949, a new radical intellectual movement emerged under the name &quot;L&#x27;Académie Berbère&quot;. This movement was known by its adoption and promotion of Anti-Arab and Anti-Islam ideologies especially amongst immigrant Kabyles in France and achieved a relative success at the time.

In 1977, the final game of the national soccer championship pitting a team from Kabylie against one from Algiers turned into an Arab-Berber conflict. The Arab national anthem of Algeria was overwhelmed by the shouting of Anti-Arab slogans such as &quot;A bas les arabes&quot; (&quot;down with the Arabs&quot;).

The roots of modern-day Arabophobia in Algeria can be traced back to multiple factors. For some, Anti-Arabism movement among Berbers is part of the legacy of French Colonization or manipulation of North Africa. As from the beginning, the French understood that to attenuate Muslim resistance to their presence, mainly in Algeria, they had to resort to the divide and rule doctrine. The most obvious divide that could be instrumentalized in this perspective was the ethnic one. Therefore, France employed some official colonial practices to tighten its control over Algeria by creating racial tensions between Arabs and Berbers and between Jews and Muslims.

Others argue that the Berber language and traditions are deeply rooted in the North African cultural mosaic; for centuries, Berber culture has survived conquests, repression, and exclusion from different invaders: Romans, Arabs, and French. Hence, believing that its identity and specificity were threatened, the Berbers took note of the political and ideological implications of Arabism as defended by successive governments. Gradual radicalization and Anti-Arab sentiments began to emerge in Algeria and among the hundreds of thousands of Berbers in France who had been in the forefront of the Berber cultural movement.

===Australia===
The Cronulla riots in Sydney, Australia in December 2005 have been described as &quot;anti-Arab racism&quot; by community leaders. NSW Premier Morris Iemma said the violence revealed the &quot;ugly face of racism in this country&quot;.

A 2004 report by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission said that more than two-thirds of Muslim and Arab Australians say they have experienced racism or racial vilification since the September 11 attacks and that 90% of female respondents experienced racial abuse or violence.

Adam Houda, a Lebanese Muslim lawyer, has been repeatedly harassed by the New South Wales police force. Houda has been arrested or detained six times in 11 years and has sued the police force for malicious prosecution and harassment three times. Houda claims that the police&#x27;s motivation is racism which he says is &quot;alive and well&quot; in Bankstown. He has been stopped going to prayers, with relatives and friends and has been subjected to a humiliating body search. He has been the object of several groundless accusations of robbery or holding a knife. A senior lawyer told the Sydney Morning Herald that the police harassment was due to the police enmity against Houda&#x27;s clients and the Australian Arab community. He was first falsely arrested in 2000 for which he was awarded $145,000 damages by a judge who described his persecution as &quot;shocking&quot;. Constable Lance Stebbing was found to have maliciously arrested Houda, as well as using profanities against him and approaching him in a &quot;menacing manner&quot;. Stebbing was supported by other police, against the testimony of many eyewitnesses. In 2005, Houda accused the police of disabling his mobile phone making it difficult to perform his work as a criminal defense lawyer.

In 2010, Houda, his lawyer Chris Murphy, and Channel Seven journalist Adam Walters claimed that Frank Menilli, a senior New South Wales police officer, behaved in a corrupt fashion by trying to alter Channel Seven&#x27;s coverage of the Houda Case by promising Walters inside information in exchange for presenting the case in the police&#x27;s favour. Walters regarded the offer as an &quot;attempted bribe&quot;. The latest incident occurred in 2011, when Houda was arrested for refusing a frisk search and resisting arrest after having been approached by police suspecting him of involvement in a recent robbery. These charges were thrown out of court by Judge John Connell who stated &quot;At the end of the day, here were three men of Middle Eastern appearance walking along a suburban street, for all the police knew, minding their own business at an unexceptional time of day, in unexceptional clothing, except two of the men had hooded jumpers. The place they were in could not have raised a reasonable suspicion they were involved in the robberies&quot; Houda is currently suing the six police officers involved for false imprisonment, unlawful arrest, assault and battery and defamation. One of the six is an assistant commissioner. He is seeking $5 million in damages.

===France===

France used to be a colonial empire, with still great post-colonial power over its former colonies, using Africa as a reservoir for labor, especially in moments of dire need. During World War I, reconstruction and shortages made France bring thousands of North African workers. Out of a total of 116,000 workers from 1914 to 1918, 78,000 Algerians, 54,000 Moroccans, and Tunisians were requisitioned. Two hundred and forty thousand Algerians were mobilized or drafted, and two thirds of these were soldiers who served mostly in France. This constituted more than one-third of the men of those nations from ages 20–40. According to historian Abdallah Laroui, Algeria sent 173,000 soldiers, 25,000 of whom were killed. Tunisia sent 56,000, of whom 12,000 were killed. Moroccan soldiers helped defend Paris and landed at Bordeaux in 1916.

After the war, reconstruction and labor shortages necessitated even larger number of Algerian laborers. Migration (or the need for labor) was reestablished at a high level by 1936. This was partly the result of collective recruitments in the villages conducted by French officers and representatives of companies. Labor recruitment continued throughout the 1940s. North Africans were mostly recruited for dangerous and low-wage jobs, unwanted by ordinary French workers.

This large number of immigrants was of great help for France&#x27;s rapid post–World War II economic growth. The 1970s were marked by recession followed by the cessation of labor migration programs and crackdowns on illegal immigration. During the 1980s, political disfavor with President Mitterrand&#x27;s social programs led to the rise of Jean-Marie Le Pen and other far right French nationalists. The public increasingly blamed immigrants for French economic problems. In March 1990, according to a poll reported in Le Monde, 76% of those polled said that there were too many Arabs in France while 39% said they had an &quot;aversion&quot; to Arabs. In the following years, Interior Minister Charles Pasqua was noted for dramatically toughening immigration laws.

In May 2005, riots broke out between North Africans and Romani people in Perpignan, after a young Arab man was shot dead and another Arab man was lynched by a group of Roma.

Chirac&#x27;s controversial &quot;Hijab ban&quot; law, presented as secularization of schools, was interpreted by its critics as an &quot;indirect legitimization of anti-Arab stereotypes, fostering rather than preventing racism.&quot;

A higher rate of racial profiling is conducted on Blacks and Arabs by the French police.

===Iran===
Human rights group Amnesty International says that in practice, Arabs are among a number of ethnic minorities that are disadvantaged and suffer discrimination by the authorities. Separatist tendencies in Khuzestan exacerbate this. How far the situation facing Arabs in Iran is related to racism or simply a result of policies suffered by all Iranians is a matter of debate (&quot;see: Politics of Khuzestan&quot;). Iran is a multi-ethnic society with its Arab minority mainly located in the south.

It is claimed by some that anti-Arabism in Iran may be related to the notion that Arabs forced some Persians to convert to Islam in 7th century AD (&quot;See: Muslim conquest of Persia&quot;). Author Richard Foltz in his article &quot;Internationalization of Islam&quot; states &quot;Even today, many Iranians perceive the Arab destruction of the Sassanid Empire as the single greatest tragedy in Iran&#x27;s long history. Following the Muslim conquest of Persia, many Iranians (also known as &quot;mawali&quot;) came to despise the Umayyads due to discrimination against them by their Arab rulers. The Shu&#x27;ubiyah movement was intended to reassert Iranian identity and resist attempts to impose Arab culture while reaffirming their commitment to Islam.

More recently, anti-Arabism has arisen as a consequence of aggression against Iran by the regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq. During a visit to Khuzestan, which has most of Iran&#x27;s Arab population, a British journalist, John R. Bradley, wrote that despite the fact that the majority of Arabs supported Iran in the war, &quot;ethnic Arabs complain that, as a result of their divided loyalties during the Iran–Iraq War, they are viewed more than ever by the clerical regime in Tehran as a potential fifth column, and suffer from a policy of discrimination.&quot; However, Iran&#x27;s Arab population played an important role in defending Iran during the Iran-Iraq War and most refused to heed Saddam Hussein&#x27;s call for an uprising and instead fought against their fellow Arabs. Furthermore, Iran&#x27;s former defense minister Ali Shamkhani, a Khuzestani Arab, was chief commander of the ground force during the Iran-Iraq War as well as serving as first deputy commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.

The Arab minority of southern Iran has been subject to discriminations, persecution in Iran. In a report published in February 2006, Amnesty International stated that the &quot;Arab population of Iran is one of the most economically and socially deprived in Iran&quot; and that Arabs have &quot;reportedly been denied state employment under the &quot;gozinesh&quot; [job placement] criteria.&quot;
Critics of such reports have pointed out that they are often based on sketchy sources and are not always to be trusted at face value (see: Criticism of human rights reports on Khuzestan). Furthermore, critics point out that Arabs have social mobility in Iran, with a number of famous Iranians from the worlds of arts, sport, literature, and politics having Arab origins (see: Iranian Arabs) illustrating Arab-Iranian participation in Iranian economics, society, and politics. They contend that Khuzestan province, where most of Iran&#x27;s Arabs live, is actually one of the more economically advanced provinces of Iran, more so than many of the Persian-populated provinces.

Some critics of the Iranian government contend that it is carrying out a policy of anti-Arab ethnic cleansing. While there has been large amounts of investment in industrial projects such as the &quot;Razi Petrochemical Complex&quot;, local universities, and other national projects such as hydroelectric dams (such as the Karkheh Dam, which cost $700 million to construct) and nuclear power plants, many critics of Iran&#x27;s economic development policies have pointed to the poverty suffered by Arabs in Khuzestan as proof of an anti-Arab policy agenda. Following his visit to Khuzestan in July 2005, UN Special Rapporteur for Adequate Housing Miloon Kothari spoke of how up to 250,000 Arabs had been displaced by such industrial projects and noted the favorable treatment given to settlers from Yazd compared to the treatment of local Arabs.

However, it is also true that non-Arab provinces such as Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province, Sistan and Baluchestan Province, and neighboring Īlām Province also suffer high levels of poverty, indicating that government policy is not disadvantaging Arabs alone but other regions, including some with large ethnically Persian populations. Furthermore, most commentators agree that Iran&#x27;s state-controlled and highly subsidized economy is the main reason behind the inability of the Iranian government to generate economic growth and welfare at ground levels in all cities across the nation, rather than a state ethnic policy targeted specifically at Arabs; Iran is ranked 156th on The Heritage Foundation&#x27;s 2006 Index of Economic Freedom.

In the Iranian education system, after primary education cycle (grades 1-5 for children 6 to 11 years old), passing some Arabic courses is mandatory until the end of secondary education cycle (grade 6 to Grade 12, from age 11 to 17). In higher education systems (universities), passing Arabic language courses is selective.

Persians use slurs like &quot;Tazi Kaseef&quot; (lit. &quot;Dirty Taazi&quot;), &quot;Arabe malakh-khor&quot; (عرب ملخ‌خور) (lit. &quot;Locust-eater Arab&quot;), &quot;soosmar-khor&quot; (سوسمارخور) (&quot;lizard eater&quot;) and call Arabs &quot;پابرهنه&quot; (lit. &quot;barefoot&quot;), &quot;بی‌تمدن&quot; (lit. &quot;uncivilized&quot;), &quot;وحشی&quot; (lit. &quot;barbarians&quot;) and &quot;زیرصحرایی&quot; (lit &quot;sub-saharan&quot;). Anti-Islamist government Persians refer to Persian Islamic Republic supporters from Hezbollahi families as Arab-parast (عرب‌پرست) (lit. &quot;Arab Worshipper&quot;). Arabs use slurs against Persians by calling them &quot;Fire-worshipers&quot; and &quot;majoos&quot;, &quot;Majus&quot; (مجوس) (Zoroastrians, Magi).

Negative views Persians have of Arabs include eating habits such as Arabs eating lizards.

In Iran, there is a saying, &quot;The Arab of the desert eats locusts, while the dogs of Isfahan drink ice-cold water.&quot; (). In Iran &quot;to be outright Arab&quot; () means &quot;to be a complete idiot&quot;.

Relations are uneasy between specifically Iran and the Persian Gulf Arab countries in particular. Persians and Arabs dispute the name of the Persian Gulf. The Greater and Lesser Tunbs are disputed between the two countries. A National Geographic reporter who interviewed Iranians reported that many of them frequently said &quot;We are not Arabs!&quot; &quot;We are not terrorists!&quot;&quot;.

The Iranian rap artist Behzad Pax released a song in 2015 called &quot;Arab-Kosh&quot; (عرب‌كش) (Arab-killer) which was widely reported on the Arab media who claimed that it was released with the approval of the Iranian Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance. The Iranian Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance denied that it gave approval to the song and condemned it as a product of a &quot;sick mind&quot;.

===Israel===
As a consequence of the Arab–Israeli conflict, there is a high level of hostility between sections of the Jewish and Arab societies in Israel. Many Israeli Jews oppose mixed relationships, particularly between Jewish women and Arab men. A group of men in Pisgat Ze&#x27;ev started patrolling the neighborhood to stop Jewish women from dating Arab men. The municipality of Petah Tikva has a telephone hotline to inform on Jewish girls who date Arab men, as well as a psychological counseling service. Kiryat Gat launched a school programme to warn Jewish girls against dating local Bedouin men.

Geography textbooks used in Israeli schools were found to portray Arabs as primitive and backwards, with the Nakba, the destruction of Palestinian society in the 1948 Palestine war, disregarded entirely. History textbooks likewise portrayed the Palestinian population negatively, showing them as primitive and collectively to be an enemy. Contrasted with the portrayal of Jews, who were shown to be heroic and progressive, Israeli textbooks delegitimized Arabs and used negative stereotyping of Arabs nearly uniformly.

The Bedouin representatives submitted a report to the United Nations claiming that they are not treated as equal citizens and Bedouin towns are not provided the same level of services, land and water as Jewish towns of the same size are. The city of Beersheba refused to recognize a Bedouin holy site despite a High Court recommendation.

In 1994, a Jewish settler in the West Bank and follower of the Kach party, Baruch Goldstein, massacred 29 Palestinian Muslim worshipers at the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron. It was known that, prior to the massacre, Goldstein, a physician, refused to treat Arabs, including Arab soldiers with the Israeli army. During his funeral, a rabbi declared that even one million Arabs are &quot;not worth a Jewish fingernail&quot;. Goldstein was immediately &quot;denounced with shocked horror even by the mainstream Orthodox&quot;, and many in Israel classified Goldstein as insane. The Israeli government condemned the massacre and made Kach illegal. The Israeli army killed a further nine Palestinians during riots following the massacre, and the Israeli government severely restricted Palestinian freedom of movement in Hebron, while letting settlers and foreign tourists roam free, although Israel also forbade a small group of Israeli settlers from entering Palestinian towns and demanded that those settlers turn in their army-issued rifles. Goldstone&#x27;s grave has become a pilgrimage site for Jewish extremists.

In a number of occasions, Israeli Jewish demonstrators and rioters used racist anti-Arab slogans. For example, during the Arab riots in October 2000 events, Israelis counter-rioted in Nazareth and Tel Aviv, throwing stones at Arabs, destroying Arab property, with some chanting &quot;death to Arabs&quot;. Some Israeli-Arab soccer players face chants from the crowd when they play such as &quot;no Arabs, no terrorism&quot;. In the most radical event, Abbas Zakour, an Arab member of the Knesset, was stabbed and wounded by unidentified men, who shouted anti-Arab chants. The attack was described as a &quot;hate crime&quot;. Among the Israeli teams, Beitar Jerusalem is considered emblematic of Jewish racism; the fans are infamous for their &#x27;Death to Arabs&#x27; chant and the team has a ban on Arab players, a policy that is in violation of FIFA&#x27;s guidelines, though the team has never faced suspension from the football organization. In March 2012, supporters of the team were filmed raiding a Jerusalem mall and beating up Arab employees.

The Israeli political party Yisrael Beiteinu, whose platform includes the redrawing of Israel&#x27;s borders so that 500,000 Israeli Arabs would be part of a future Palestinian State, won 15 seats in the 2009 Israeli elections, increasing its seats by 4 compared to the 2006 Israeli elections. This policy, also known as the Lieberman Plan, was described as &quot;anti-Arab&quot; by &quot;The Guardian&quot;. In 2004, Yehiel Hazan, a member of the Knesset, described the Arabs as worms: &quot;You find them everywhere like worms, underground as well as above.&quot;

In 2004, then Deputy Defense Minister Ze&#x27;ev Boim asked &quot;What is it about Islam as a whole and the Palestinians in particular? Is it some form of cultural deprivation? Is it some genetic defect? There is something that defies explanation in this continued murderousness.&quot;

In August 2005, Israeli soldier Eden Natan-Zada traveled to an Israeli Arab town and massacred four civilians. Israeli Arabs said they would draw up a list of grievances after the terrorist attack of Eden Natan-Zada. &quot;This was a planned terror attack and we find it extremely difficult to treat it as an individual action,&quot; Abed Inbitawi, an Israeli-Arab spokesman, told &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot;. &quot;It marks a certain trend that reflects a growing tendency of fascism and racism in Israeli society generally as well as the establishment towards the minority Arab community,&quot; he said.

According to a 2006 poll conducted by Geocartographia for the Centre for the Struggle Against Racism, 41% of Israelis support Arab-Israeli segregation at entertainment venues, 40% believed &quot;the state needs to support the emigration of Arab citizens&quot;, and 63% believed Arabs to be a &quot;security and demographic threat&quot; to Israel. The poll found that more than two thirds would not want to live in the same building as an Arab, 36% believed Arab culture to be inferior, and 18% felt hatred when they heard Arabic spoken.

In 2007, the Association for Civil Rights in Israel reported that anti-Arab views had doubled, and anti-Arab racist incidents had increased by 26%. The report quoted polls that suggested 50% of Jewish Israelis do not believe Arab citizens of Israel should have equal rights, 50% said they wanted the government to encourage Arab emigration from Israel, and 75% of Jewish youths said Arabs were less intelligent and less clean than Jews. The Mossawa Advocacy Center for Arab Citizens in Israel reported a tenfold increase in racist incidents against Arabs in 2008. Jerusalem reported the highest number of incidents. The report blamed Israeli leaders for the violence, saying &quot;These attacks are not the hand of fate, but a direct result of incitement against the Arab citizens of this country by religious, public, and elected officials.&quot;

In March 2009, following the Gaza War, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) drew criticism when several young soldiers had T-shirts printed up privately with slogans and caricatures portraying dead babies, weeping mothers, and crumbled mosques.

In June 2009, Haaretz reported that Israel&#x27;s Public Security Minister, Yitzhak Aharonovich, called an undercover police officer a &quot;dirty Arab&quot; whilst touring Tel Aviv.

Since the 2000s, groups such as Lehava have been formed in Israel to prevent that Israeli Arab men form relationships with Jewish women. Some of the material promoted to discourage Jewish women to be with Arab men, are sanctioned by local governments and police departments. Lehava has received permission from Israeli courts to picket the weddings uniting a Palestinian and a Jewish partner.

In 2010, dozens of Israel&#x27;s top rabbis went on to sign a document forbidding that Jews rent apartments to Arabs, saying that &quot;racism originated in the Torah&quot;.

In January 2012, the Israeli High Court upheld a decision, deemed racist, preventing the Palestinian espouses of Israeli Arabs from obtaining Israeli citizenship or resident status.

A poll in 2012 revealed that racist attitudes are embraced by a large majority of Israelis. 59% of Jews said they wanted Jews to be given preference in admission to public employment, 50% wanted the state to generally treat Jews better than Arabs, and over 40% wanted separate housing for Jews and Arabs. According to the poll, 58% supported the use of the term apartheid to represent Israeli policies against Arabs. The poll also showed that the majority of Israeli Jews would not want voting rights extended to Palestinians if the West Bank were annexed by Israel.

In 2013, Nazareth Illit mayor Shimon Gafsou declared that he would never allow that an Arab school, a mosque, or a church be built in his city, despite the fact that Arabs account for 18 percent of its population.

On July 2, 2014, 16-year-old Palestinian Mohammed Abu Khdeir was kidnapped, beaten and burned alive, after three Israeli teenagers were kidnapped and killed in the West Bank. Khdeir&#x27;s family members have blamed Israeli Government anti-Arab hate speech for inciting the murder and rejected the PM&#x27;s condolence message, as well as a visit by then President Shimon Peres. Two Israeli minors were found guilty of Khdeirs&#x27; murder and sentenced to life and 21 years imprisonment respectively.

During the 2015 Israeli legislative election, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu complained, in a video statement to supporters, that his left-wing opponents were supposedly sending Israeli Arabs to vote in droves, in a statement that was widely condemned as racist, including by the US government. Netanyahu went on to win the elections against poll predictions, and several commentators and pollster imputed his victory to his last-minute attack on Israeli Arab voters. During election campaign, then Foreign Affairs Minister Avigdor Lieberman proposed beheading Israeli Arabs that are &quot;disloyal&quot; to the state.

===Niger===
In October 2006, the government of Niger announced that it would deport the Mahamid Baggara Arabs living in the Diffa region of eastern Niger to Chad. This population numbered about 150,000. While the government was rounding Arabs in preparation for the deportation, two girls died, reportedly after fleeing government forces, and three women suffered miscarriages. Niger&#x27;s government had eventually suspended the controversial decision to deport Arabs.

=== Turkey ===

Turkey has a history of strong anti-Arabism. During the Ottoman Empire, the Arabs were treated as just second-class subjects and suffered from immense discrimination by the Ottoman Turkish rulers, in addition, most of government&#x27;s main positions were either held by Turks or non-Arab people, except for the Emirate of Hejaz under Ottoman rule. Future policy of anti-Arab sentiment, including the process of Turkification, led to the Arab Revolt against the Ottomans.

Because of the Syrian refugee crisis, anti-Arabism has intensified. Haaretz reported that anti-Arab racism in Turkey mainly affects two groups; tourists from the Gulf who are characterized as &quot;rich and condescending&quot; and the Syrian refugees in Turkey. Haaretz also reported that anti-Syrian sentiment in Turkey is metastasizing into a general hostility toward all Arabs including the Palestinians. Deputy Chairman of the Good Party warned that Turkey risked becoming &quot;a Middle Eastern country&quot; because of the influx of refugees.

Outside historical enmity, anti-Arabism is also widespread in Turkish media, as Turkish media and education curriculum associating Arabs with backwardness. This has continued influencing modern Turkish historiography and the crusade of Turkish soft power, with Arabs being frequently stereotyped as evil, uncivilized, terrorists, incompetent, etc. This depiction is frequently used in contrast to the alleged depiction of Turkic people as &quot;noble, generous, fearsome, loyal, brave and spirited warriors&quot;.

Anti-Arab sentiment is also further fueled by ultranationalist groups, including the Grey Wolves and pan-Turkist nationalist parties, who called for invasions on the Arab World&#x27;s Syria and Iraq, to prevent the ongoing Arab persecution of its Turkic populations in many Arab countries of the Middle East. Subsequently, Turkey has begun a series of persecuting its Arab population, as well as desire to recreate the new Turkish border.

In recent years, anti-Arabism has been linked with various attempts by Arab leaders to meddle into Turkish affairs, Turkey&#x27;s alliance with Israel, which led to the discrimination against Arabs in Turkey grow.

===United Kingdom===

In 2008, a Qatari 16-year-old was killed in a racially motivated attack in Hastings, East Sussex.

===United States===

William A. Dorman, writing in the compendium &quot;The United States and the Middle East: A Search for New Perspectives&quot; (1992), notes that whereas &quot;anti-Semitism is no longer socially acceptable, at least among the educated classes[, n]o such social sanctions exist for anti-Arabism.&quot; Public opinion polls demonstrate that anti-Arabism in the United States is increasing significantly.

Prominent Russian-American Objectivist author, scholar and philosopher Ayn Rand, in her 1974 Ford Hall Forum lecture, explained her support for Israel following the Yom Kippur War of 1973 against a coalition of Arab nations, expressing strong anti-Arab sentiment, saying: &quot;The Arabs are one of the least developed cultures. They are typically nomads. Their culture is primitive, and they resent Israel because it&#x27;s the sole beachhead of modern science and civilization on their continent. When you have civilized men fighting savages, you support the civilized men, no matter who they are.&quot;

During the 1991 Gulf War, hostility toward Arabs increased in the United States. Arab Americans have experienced a backlash as result of terrorist attacks, including events where Arabs were not involved, like the Oklahoma City bombing, and the explosion of TWA Flight 800. According to a report prepared by the Arab American Institute, three days after the Oklahoma City bombing &quot;more than 200 serious hate crimes were committed against Arab Americans and American Muslims. The same was true in the days following September 11.&quot;

According to a 2001 poll of Arab Americans conducted by the Arab American Institute, 32% of Arab Americans reported having been subjected to some form of ethnic-based discrimination during their lifetimes, while 20% reported having experienced an instance of ethnic-based discrimination since the September 11 attacks. Of special concern, for example, is the fact that 45% of students and 37% of Arab Americans of the Muslim faith report being targeted by discrimination since September 11.

According to the FBI and Arab groups, the number of attacks against Arabs and Muslims, as well as others mistaken for them, rose considerably after the 9/11 attacks. Hate crimes against people of Middle Eastern origin or descent increased from 354 attacks in 2000, to 1,501 attacks in 2001. Among the victims of the backlash was a Middle Eastern man in Houston, Texas who was shot and wounded after an assailant accused him of &quot;blowing up the country&quot;, and four immigrants shot and killed by a man named Larme Price, who confessed to killing them as revenge for the September 11 attacks. Although Price described his victims as Arabs, only one was from an Arab country. This appears to be a trend; because of stereotypes of Arabs, several non-Arab, non-Muslim groups were subjected to attacks in the wake of 9/11, including several Sikh men attacked for wearing their religiously mandated turban.

Earl Krugel and Irv Rubin, two leaders of the Jewish Defense League (JDL), described by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security as a terrorist organization, planned to bomb Arab-American Congressman Darrell Issa&#x27;s office and the King Fahd Mosque in Culver City, California. The two were arrested as part of a sting operation when they received a shipment of explosives at Krugel&#x27;s home in Los Angeles. Krugel was murdered in November 2005 while in the custody of the Federal Bureau of Prisons in Phoenix. His conviction, which was under appeal at that time, was dismissed in U.S. District Court. Rubin committed suicide in 2002 while in Federal Bureau of Prisons custody in Los Angeles. Although the JDL was suspected in the 1985 bombing death of ADC leader Alex Odeh, no arrest has been made in that case.

Stephen E. Herbits, the Secretary-General of the New York–based World Jewish Congress (WJC) made several racist remarks and ethnic slurs in an internal memo against the president of the European Jewish Congress Pierre Besnainou: &quot;He is French. Don&#x27;t discount this. He cannot be trusted ... He is Tunisian. Do not discount this either. He works like an Arab.&quot; The WJC in Israel has condemned the statements as both hateful and racist. &quot;It appears that the struggle in the World Jewish Congress has now turned racist, said Knesset member Shai Hermesh (Kadima), who heads the Israeli board of the WJC. Instead of creating unity among the Jewish people, this organization is just creating division and hatred.&quot;

In 2004, American radio host Michael Savage described Arabs as &quot;non-humans&quot;, said that Americans want the U.S. to &quot;drop a nuclear weapon&quot; on an Arab country, and advocated that people in the Middle East be &quot;forcibly converted to Christianity&quot; to &quot;turn them into human beings&quot;. Savage characterized Israel as &quot;a little country surrounded by racist, fascist bigots who don&#x27;t want anyone but themselves living in that hell hole called the Middle East&quot;. Expressions of anti-Arabism in the United States intensified following the 2009 Fort Hood shooting, which was perpetrated by Nidal Hasan, a Palestinian Arab American. In 2010, the proposed development of an Islamic community center containing a mosque near the World Trade Center site provoked further widespread expressions of virulent anti-Arabism in the United States.

===Western media===

Parts of Hollywood are regarded as using a disproportionate number of Arabs as villains and of depicting Arabs negatively and stereotypically. According to Godfrey Cheshire, a critic on the &quot;New York Press&quot;, &quot;the only vicious racial stereotype that&#x27;s not only still permitted but actively endorsed by Hollywood&quot; is that of Arabs as crazed terrorists.

Like the image projected of Jews in Nazi Germany, the image of Arabs projected by western movies is often that of &quot;money-grubbing caricatures that sought world domination, worshipped a different God, killed innocents, and lusted after blond virgins&quot;.

The 2000 film &quot;Rules of Engagement&quot; drew criticism from Arab groups and was described as &quot;probably the most racist film ever made against Arabs by Hollywood&quot; by the ADC. Paul Clinton of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; wrote &quot;at its worst, it&#x27;s blatantly racist, using Arabs as cartoon-cutout bad guys&quot;.

Jack Shaheen, in his book &quot;Reel Bad Arabs&quot;, surveyed more than 900 film appearances of Arab characters. Of those, only a dozen were positive and 50 were balanced. Shaheen writes that &quot;[Arab] stereotypes are deeply ingrained in American cinema. From 1896 until today, filmmakers have collectively indicted all Arabs as Public Enemy #1 – brutal, heartless, uncivilized religious fanatics and money-mad cultural &quot;others&quot; bent on terrorizing civilized Westerners, especially [Christians] and [Jews]. Much has happened since 1896 ... Throughout it all, Hollywood&#x27;s caricature of the [Arab] has prowled the silver screen. He is there to this day – repulsive and unrepresentative as ever.&quot;

According to &quot;Newsweek&quot; columnist Meg Greenfield, anti-Arab sentiment presently promotes misconceptions about Arabs and hinders genuine peace in the Middle East.

In 1993, the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee confronted Disney about anti-Arab racist content in its animated film &quot;Aladdin&quot;. At first Disney denied any problems but eventually relented and changed two lines in the opening song. Members of the ADC were still unhappy with the portrayal of Arabic characters and the referral to the Middle East as &quot;barbaric&quot;.

In 1980, &quot;The Link&quot;, a magazine published by Americans for Middle East Understanding, contained an article &quot;The Arab Stereotype on Television&quot; which detailed negative Arab stereotypes that appeared in TV shows including &quot;Woody Woodpecker&quot;, &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot;, &quot;Jonny Quest&quot; and an educational children&#x27;s show on PBS.

==Arab advocacy organisations==

===United States===
The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) was founded in 1980 by United States Senator James Abourezk. The ADC claims that it is the largest Arab-American grassroots civil rights organization in the United States. Warren David is the national president of ADC On March 1, 2010, Sara Najjar-Wilson replaced former Democratic US Congresswoman Mary Rose Oakar as president. ADC claims that is at the forefront in addressing anti-Arabism - discrimination and bias against Arab Americans.

Founded in 1985 by James Zogby, a prominent Democrat, the Arab American Institute (AAI) states that it is a partisan non-profit, membership organization and advocacy group based in Washington, D.C. that focuses on the issues and interests of Arab-Americans nationwide. The AAI also conducts research related to anti-Arabism in the United States. The Anti-Defamation League identifies the Arab American Institute as an anti-Israel protest organization. According to an AAI 2007 poll of Arab-Americans:
The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) is an Islamic organization in North America that was created in June 1994. It has been active against anti-Arabism as well.

The Anti-Defamation League (ADL), which was founded to combat antisemitism and other forms of bigotry, actively investigated and spoke out against the rise in anti-Arab hate crimes following the September 2001 terrorist attacks.
In 2003, the ADL urged the Speaker of the United States&#x27; House of Representatives to approve a resolution condemning bigotry and violence against Arab-Americans and American Muslims. The American Jewish Committee, and American Jewish Congress have issued similar responses. In 2004, the ADL national director issued the following statement: &quot;we are disturbed that a number of Arab Americans and Islamic institutions have been targets of anger and hatred in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks.&quot;

In the 1990s, the Anti-Defamation League clashed with the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee in a legal dispute regarding sensitive information the ADL had collected about ADC members&#x27; positions on the Arab-Israeli conflict. In 1999, the dispute was finally settled out of court without any finding of wrongdoing. In 2001, the ADL attempted to bar Arab members of CAIR from attending a conference on multicultural inclusion. In 2007 the ADL accused the Council on American-Islamic Relations of having a &quot;poor record on terrorism.&quot; CAIR, in turn, accused the ADL of &quot;attempting to muzzle the First Amendment rights of American Muslims by smearing and demonizing them&quot;. When the case was settled, Hussein Ibish, director of communications for the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC), stated that the ADL had gathered data &quot;systematically in a program whose clear intent was to undermine civil rights and Arab-American organizations&quot;.

===United Kingdom===
In Britain, the Greater London Council (GLC) and Labour Committee on Palestine (LCP) have been involved in fighting anti-Arabism through the promotion of Arab and Palestinian rights. The LCP funded a conference on anti-Arab racism in 1989. The National Association of British Arabs also works against discrimination.

===United Nations===
The outcome document of the Durban Review Conference organized by the UN Human Rights Council, April 21, 2009, &quot;Deplores the global rise and number of incidents of racial or religious intolerance and violence, including Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, Christianophobia and anti-Arabism&quot;.

<doc id="65787" wikidata="Q132851" url="?curid=65787" title="Admiral">
<text>Admiral is one of the highest ranks in some navies. In the Commonwealth nations and the United States, a &quot;full&quot; admiral is equivalent to a &quot;full&quot; general in the army or the air force. Admiral is ranked above vice admiral and below admiral of the fleet, or fleet admiral.

==Etymology==
The word in Middle English comes from Anglo-French , &quot;commander&quot;, from Medieval Latin , . These evolved from the Arabic () – () (), &quot;king, prince, chief, leader, nobleman, lord, a governor, commander, or person who rules over a number of people&quot; and (), the Arabic definite article meaning &quot;the.&quot; In Arabic, admiral is also represented as (), where al-Baḥr (البحر) means the sea.

The 1818 edition of Samuel Johnson&#x27;s &quot;A Dictionary of the English Language&quot;, edited and revised by the Rev. Henry John Todd, states that the term &quot;has been traced to the Arab. emir or amir, lord or commander, and the Gr. , the sea, q. d. &quot;prince of the sea&quot;. The word is written both with and without the d, in other languages, as well as our own. Barb. Lat. admirallus and amiralius. V. Ducange. Barb. Græc. ἄμηραλιος. V. Meursii Gloss. Græco-Barbarum, edit. 1610. p. 29. Fr. admiral and amiral. Dan. the same. Germ. ammiral. Dutch, admirael or ammirael. Ital. ammiraglio. Sp. almirante. Minsheu, in his Spanish Dictionary, says &#x27;almiralle is a king in the Arabian language.&#x27; Amrayl is used by Robert of Gloucester, in the sense of a prince, or governour.&quot;

The quote from John Minsheu&#x27;s Dictionarie in Spanish and English (1599), given in Johnson&#x27;s Dictionary, has been confirmed as being accurate. Additionally, the definition of Amīr (أمير), as given in Edward William Lane&#x27;s Arabic-English Lexicon, concurs, in part, with Minsheu&#x27;s definition, stating that the term means &quot;One having, holding, or possessing, command; a commander; a governor; a lord; a prince, or king.&quot;

While other Greek words of the period existed to indicate &quot;belonging to the sea,&quot; or &quot;of the sea,&quot; the now obsolete Gr. mentioned in Johnson&#x27;s Dictionary is expressly defined as &quot;of the sea, Lat. marinus, epith. of sea-gods, nymphs, etc.&quot;

Though there are multiple meanings for the Arabic Amīr (أمير), the literal meaning of the phrase Amīr al-Baḥr (أمير البحر) is &quot;Prince of the Sea.&quot; This position, versus &quot;commander of the sea,&quot; is demonstrated by legal practices prevailing in the Ottoman Empire, whereas it was only possible for Phanariots to qualify for attaining four princely positions, those being grand dragoman, dragoman of the fleet, and the voivodees of Moldavia and Wallachia. Those Phanariots who attained the princely position of dragoman of the fleet served under the Ottoman admiral having administration of the Aegean islands and the Anatolian coast.

Modern acknowledgement of the phrase Amīr-al-Baḥr (أمير البحر) meaning &quot;Prince of the Sea&quot; includes a speech made in an official U.S. military ceremony conducted in an Arabic port, and a news article published by an Arabic news outlet: On 24 May 2012, in a change of command ceremony aboard aircraft carrier USS Enterprise (CVN 65), while docked at Khalifa Bin Salman Port, Bahrain, U.S. Marine Corps Gen. James Mattis, Commander, U.S. Central Command, introduced Vice Admiral Mark I. Fox as &quot;Admiral Fox, the prince of the sea, emir of the sea – to translate &#x27;admiral&#x27; from the Arabic to English;&quot; On 04 Feb 2021, in an announcement of his coronavirus-related death, the Arabic news website Saudi 24 News referred to Admiral Edmond Chagoury by the title &quot;Prince of the Sea.&quot;

One alternate etymology proposes that the term admiral evolved, instead, from the title of Amīr al-Umarāʾ (أمير الأمراء). Under the reign of the Buyid dynasty (934 to 1062) of Iraq and Iran, the title of Amīr al-Umarāʾ, which means prince of princes, came to denote the heir-apparent, or crown prince.

This alternate etymology states that the term was in use for the Greco-Arab naval leaders (e.g. Christodulus) in the Norman-Arab-Byzantine culture of Norman Sicily, which had formerly been ruled by Arabs, at least by the early 11th century. During this time, the Norman Roger II of Sicily (1095–1154) employed a Greek Christian, known as George of Antioch, who previously had served as a naval commander for several North African Muslim rulers. Roger styled George in Abbasid fashion as , or Amīr al-Umarāʾ, with the title becoming Latinized in the 13th century as .

The Sicilians and later the Genoese took the first two parts of the term from their Aragon opponents and used them as one word, . . The French gave their sea commanders similar titles while in Portuguese and Spanish the word changed to . As the word was used by people speaking Latin or Latin-based languages it gained the &quot;d&quot; and endured a series of different endings and spellings leading to the English spelling in the 14th century and to &quot;admiral&quot; by the 16th century.

It is important to note that the etymology of a word does not suggest the antiquity of the word as it may have appeared in other languages with entirely different pronunciations. The Greek ναύαρχος, for instance, which is pronounced &quot;naúarkhos&quot;, existed from very ancient times in Greece. While ναύαρχος may be defined as &quot;admiral&quot; as used by Plutarch in his &quot;Parallel Lives&quot;, the very pronunciation of ναύαρχος demonstrates that it is not a part of the etymology for the English word &quot;admiral.&quot;

==Further history==
The word &quot;admiral&quot; has come to be almost exclusively associated with the highest naval rank in most of the world&#x27;s navies, equivalent to the army rank of general. However, this was not always the case; for example, in some European countries prior to the end of World War II, admiral was the third highest naval rank after general admiral and grand admiral.

The rank of admiral has also been subdivided into various grades, several of which are historically extinct while others remain in use in most present-day navies. The Royal Navy used the colours red, white, and blue, in descending order to indicate seniority of its admirals until 1864; for example, Horatio Nelson&#x27;s highest rank was vice-admiral of the white. The generic term for these naval equivalents of army generals is flag officer. Some navies have also used army-type titles for them, such as the Cromwellian &quot;general at sea&quot;.

==NATO code==
While the rank is used in most of NATO countries, it is ranked differently depending on the country.

<text>Shenzhou (, ; see ) is a Chinese spacecraft developed for the nation&#x27;s crewed space program. Its design was based on Russia&#x27;s Soyuz, but larger and modernized, Shenzhou is a single-use vehicle composed of three modules. The descent module houses the crew during launch and reentry. The orbital module provides additional living space and storage during orbit but is jettisoned before reentry. The service module, responsible for propulsion and power, is also discarded prior to reentry. For added safety and aerodynamics, the spacecraft is encased within a fairing with a launch escape system during liftoff.

Its maiden uncrewed flight, Shenzhou 1, was on 19 November 1999, with the first crewed mission, Shenzhou 5, taking flight on 15 October 2003. It is slated for replacement by the next-generation Mengzhou, currently in development, with a two module configuration.

== Etymology ==
The literal meaning of the native name (p: Shénzhōu; ) is &quot;the Divine vessel [on the Heavenly River]&quot;, to which Heavenly River () means the Milky Way in Classical Chinese. is a pun and neologism that plays on the poetic word referring to China, , meaning &quot;Divine realm&quot;, which bears the same pronunciation. For further information, refer to Chinese theology, Chinese astronomy and names of China.

== History ==

China&#x27;s first efforts at human spaceflight started in 1968 with a projected launch date of 1973. Although China successfully launched an uncrewed satellite in 1970, its crewed spacecraft program was cancelled in 1980 due to a lack of funds.

The Chinese crewed spacecraft program was relaunched in 1992 with Project 921. The Phase One spacecraft followed the general layout of the Russian Soyuz spacecraft, with three modules that could separate for reentry. China signed a deal with Russia in 1995 for the transfer of Soyuz technology, including life support and docking systems. The Phase One spacecraft was then modified with the new Russian technology. The general designer of Shenzhou-1 through Shenzhou-5 was Qi Faren ((), 26 April 1933), and from Shenzhou-6 on, the general design was turned over to Zhang Bainan ((), 23 June 1962).

The first uncrewed flight of the spacecraft was launched on 19 November 1999, after which Project 921/1 was renamed Shenzhou, a name reportedly chosen by Jiang Zemin. A series of three additional uncrewed flights were carried out. The first crewed launch took place on 15 October 2003 with the Shenzhou 5 mission. The spacecraft has since become the mainstay of the Chinese crewed space program, being used for both crewed and uncrewed missions.

== Design ==
Shenzhou consists of three modules: a forward orbital module (), a reentry module () in the middle, and an aft service module (). This division is based on the principle of minimizing the amount of material to be returned to Earth. Anything placed in the orbital or service modules does not require heat shielding, increasing the space available in the spacecraft without increasing weight as much as it would if those modules were also able to withstand reentry.

=== Orbital module ===
The orbital module () contains space for experiments, crew-serviced or crew-operated equipment, and in-orbit habitation. Without docking systems, Shenzhou 1–6 carried different kinds of payload on the top of their orbital modules for scientific experiments.

The Chinese spacecraft docking mechanism (beginning with Shenzhou 8) is based on the Androgynous Peripheral Attach System (APAS).

Up until Shenzhou 8, the orbital module of the Shenzhou was equipped with its own propulsion, solar power, and control systems, allowing autonomous flight. It is possible for Shenzhou to leave an orbital module in orbit for redocking with a later spacecraft, a capability which Soyuz does not possess, since the only hatch between the orbital and reentry modules is a part of the reentry module, and orbital module is depressurized after separation. For future missions, the orbital module(s) could also be left behind on the planned Chinese project 921/2 space station as additional station modules.

In the uncrewed test flights launched, the orbital module of each Shenzhou was left functioning on orbit for several days after the reentry modules return, and the Shenzhou 5 orbital module continued to operate for six months after launch.
=== Reentry module ===
The reentry module () is located in the middle section of the spacecraft and contains seating for the crew. It is the only portion of Shenzhou which returns to Earth&#x27;s surface. Its shape is a compromise between maximizing living space and allowing for some aerodynamic control upon reentry.

=== Service module ===
The aft service module () contains life support and other equipment required for the functioning of Shenzhou. Two pairs of solar panels, one pair on the service module and the other pair on the orbital module, have a total area of over , indicating average electrical power over 1.5 kW (&quot;Soyuz&quot; have 1.0 kW).

=== Comparison with Soyuz ===
Although the Shenzhou spacecraft follows the same layout as the Russian Soyuz spacecraft, it is approximately 10% larger and heavier than Soyuz. It also has a bigger cylindrical orbital module and four propulsion engines. There is enough room to carry an inflatable raft in case of a splashdown, whereas Soyuz cosmonauts must jump into the water and swim. The commander sits in the center seat on both spacecraft. However, the pilot sits in the left seat on Shenzhou and the right seat on Soyuz.

<text>The Amarillo Dillas were a professional baseball team based in Amarillo, Texas, in the United States. The Dillas were a member of United League Baseball, an independent professional league which is not affiliated with Major League Baseball or Minor League Baseball. From 1994 to 2010, the Dillas played their home games at historic Potter County Memorial Stadium, nicknamed the &quot;Dilla Villa.&quot;

==History==
The Amarillo Dillas were a charter member of the independent Texas–Louisiana League, which was formed in 1994. The Dillas were a strong team in the early years of the Texas–Louisiana League, claiming the regular season champion title in 1995, 1998, and 2000. They would win the first half championship in 1997 and were the 1999 Texas–Louisiana League champions. The Texas–Louisiana League was renamed the Central Baseball League in 2002, and several new teams were added. The Dillas struggled with attendance after the expansion, only averaging 846 fans in their championship series appearance in 2004. A neglected stadium and erosion of local fan support resulted in the Dillas being dropped from the Central League following the 2004 season in favor of the El Paso Diablos.

The Amarillo Dillas were brought back in 2006 as one of six charter members of the independent United League Baseball (ULB). The new Amarillo Dillas management renovated the entire stadium, including a new field and new seats. The Amarillo Dillas just missed the playoffs in their first two seasons in the new league. In 2008, the Dillas posted a 54–37 record, claiming first-half champion honors. In the playoffs, Amarillo defeated Alexandria for their first league championship since 1999. Amarillo would continue their success in 2009 with a 44–35 record and another championship, defeating San Angelo for the title. The Dillas would win the title again in 2010, becoming the first United League three-peat champions.

In October 2010, the Dillas were evicted from Potter County Memorial Stadium. Reunion Sports Group, the parent company of the Dillas, could not pay the $75,000 lease on the stadium. In November 2010, Potter County commissioners awarded the bid for the 2011 use of the stadium to Scott Berry, owner of Southern Independent Baseball and franchisee with the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball. The Dillas were replaced by the Amarillo Sox in the 2011 season.

<text>The Jackson Senators was the name of at least two minor league baseball teams that played in Jackson, Mississippi.

==First team==
The first known Jackson Senators club competed in the Delta League in 1904. Jackson also played as a member of the Cotton States League before 1953. This was a class C minor-league club, and was the last team to represent the city of Jackson before the arrival of the class AA Jackson Mets for the 1975 season.

==Second team==
The second Jackson Senators team was a member of the independent Central Baseball League from 2002 to 2005, a league that was not affiliated with Major League Baseball. The Senators won the CBL title in 2003. After the CBL disbanded, the Senators were left without a league for the 2006 season.

On January 24, 2006, officials with the team&#x27;s ownership group, Mississippi Baseball Club LLC, announced that they would not be operating a professional independent team in Jackson for the 2006 season after running the team alongside the Mississippi Braves for the 2005 season, who had relocated to suburban Pearl from Greenville (South Carolina).

The team played at Smith-Wills Stadium.

==Notable players==

<doc id="65798" wikidata="Q474147" url="?curid=65798" title="Wang tile">
<text>Wang tiles (or Wang dominoes), first proposed by mathematician, logician, and philosopher Hao Wang in 1961, is a class of formal systems. They are modeled visually by square tiles with a color on each side. A set of such tiles is selected, and copies of the tiles are arranged side by side with matching colors, &quot;without&quot; rotating or reflecting them.

The basic question about a set of Wang tiles is whether it can tile the plane or not, i.e., whether an entire infinite plane can be filled this way. The next question is whether this can be done in a periodic pattern.

==Domino problem==

In 1961, Wang conjectured that if a finite set of Wang tiles can tile the plane, then there also exists a &quot; periodic&quot; tiling, which, mathematically, is a tiling that is invariant under translations by vectors in a 2-dimensional lattice. This can be likened to the periodic tiling in a wallpaper pattern, where the overall pattern is a repetition of some smaller pattern. He also observed that this conjecture would imply the existence of an algorithm to decide whether a given finite set of Wang tiles can tile the plane. The idea of constraining adjacent tiles to match each other occurs in the game of dominoes, so Wang tiles are also known as Wang dominoes. The algorithmic problem of determining whether a tile set can tile the plane became known as the domino problem.

According to Wang&#x27;s student, Robert Berger,

The Domino Problem deals with the class of all domino sets. It consists of deciding, for each domino set, whether or not it is solvable. We say that the Domino Problem is &quot;decidable&quot; or &quot;undecidable&quot; according to whether there exists or does not exist an algorithm which, given the specifications of an arbitrary domino set, will decide whether or not the set is solvable.

In other words, the domino problem asks whether there is an effective procedure that correctly settles the problem for all given domino sets.

In 1966, Berger solved the domino problem in the negative. He proved that no algorithm for the problem can exist, by showing how to translate any Turing machine into a set of Wang tiles that tiles the plane if and only if the Turing machine does not halt. The undecidability of the halting problem (the problem of testing whether a Turing machine eventually halts) then implies the undecidability of Wang&#x27;s tiling problem.

==Aperiodic sets of tiles==

Combining Berger&#x27;s undecidability result with Wang&#x27;s observation shows that there must exist a finite set of Wang tiles that tiles the plane, but only &quot;aperiodically&quot;. This is similar to a Penrose tiling, or the arrangement of atoms in a quasicrystal. Although Berger&#x27;s original set contained 20,426 tiles, he conjectured that smaller sets would work, including subsets of his set, and in his unpublished Ph.D. thesis, he reduced the number of tiles to 104. In later years, ever smaller sets were found. For example, a set of 13 aperiodic tiles was published by Karel Culik II in 1996.

The smallest set of aperiodic tiles was discovered by Emmanuel Jeandel and Michael Rao in 2015, with 11 tiles and 4 colors. They used an exhaustive computer search to prove that 10 tiles or 3 colors are insufficient to force aperiodicity. This set, shown above in the title image, can be examined more closely at :File: Wang 11 tiles.svg.

==Generalizations==
Wang tiles can be generalized in various ways, all of which are also undecidable in the above sense. For example, &quot;Wang cubes&quot; are equal-sized cubes with colored faces, and side colors can be matched on any polygonal tessellation.
Culik and Kari have demonstrated aperiodic sets of Wang cubes. Winfree et al. have demonstrated the feasibility of creating molecular &quot;tiles&quot; made from DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) that can act as Wang tiles. Mittal et al. have shown that these tiles can also be composed of peptide nucleic acid (PNA), a stable artificial mimic of DNA.

==Applications==
Wang tiles have been used for procedural synthesis of textures, heightfields, and other large and nonrepeating bi-dimensional data sets; a small set of precomputed or hand-made source tiles can be assembled very cheaply without too obvious repetitions and periodicity.
In this case, traditional aperiodic tilings would show their very regular structure; much less constrained sets that guarantee at least two tile choices for any two given side colors are common because tileability is easily ensured and each tile can be selected pseudorandomly.

Wang tiles have also been used in cellular automata theory decidability proofs.

==In popular culture==
The short story &quot;Wang&#x27;s Carpets&quot;, later expanded to the novel &quot;Diaspora&quot;, by Greg Egan, postulates a universe, complete with resident organisms and intelligent beings, embodied as Wang tiles implemented by patterns of complex molecules.

One of the Wang tiles resembles the flag of the Maya peoples and the flag of the auxiliary language Interslavic.

<text>The San Angelo Colts were a professional baseball team based in San Angelo, Texas, in the United States. The Colts were most recently a member of United League Baseball, an independent professional league which was not affiliated with Major League Baseball or Minor League Baseball. The Colts played their home games at Foster Field.

The team experienced declining attendance in later years and announced on July 2, 2014 that it had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Although it was stated at the time that operations would not be affected, the team announced on August 11, 2014 that the final 8 games of the 2014 season would not be played.

The combination of the Colts&#x27; financial issues, the loss of the home stadium of the Fort Worth Cats and low attendance led to the folding of United League Baseball, and all of its member teams, in January 2015.

==Historical use of the name==

The original San Angelo Colts played in the Class D West Texas League in 1922. The team had started out as the San Angelo Bronchos the year before.

In 1948, another team using the Colts name began play in the Longhorn League. When the league changed names to the Southwestern League in 1956, the Colts stayed on board, but folded before the start of the 1957 season.

The Colts had been a part of independent baseball since 2000 with the Texas–Louisiana League (2000–2001), Central Baseball League (2002–2005), United League Baseball (2006–2010) and North American League (2011–2012).

<text>The Springfield-Ozark Mountain Ducks was an unaffiliated minor league team that previously played in Ozark, Missouri, a suburb of Springfield. The team was a member of the Texas-Louisiana League, later named the Central Baseball League from 1999 to 2003. The team played in Price Cutter Park, now known as Ozark Mountain Sports Complex.

==History==

In April 1998, Texas-Louisiana League president and co-founder Byron Pierce announced that the league would put a new team in Ozark pending financing for a new ballpark. In August the funding was secured. Construction on the stadium started in late fall and took four months to complete.

The peculiar team name and mascot was picked from a name-the-team contest in 1998. The winning entryby Craig Cremer of Ozarkwas picked out of 65,000 submissions. Cremer says the kid-friendly name was derived from a combination of the Ozark Mountains and the Ride the Ducks boat ride in Branson

The Mountain Ducks played their inaugural game on May 27, 1999 on the road, a 7-4 loss to the Amarillo Dillas. Their first home game came two weeks later on June 10 in front of 4,764 people, a 5-2 loss, also against Amarillo.

Success on the field was hard to come by for the team. The Mountain Ducks only made the postseason one time during its tenure, a first round exit in 2000.

Two players with Major League experience played for Springfield-Ozark: Outfielder Mel Hall (2002) played 13 seasons, mostly with the Cleveland Indians and New York Yankees and Pitcher Mike Smith (1999-2001). Smith played in 15 games over two seasons with the Baltimore Orioles.

The team joined the Frontier League in 2004. The Mountain Ducks rights to the club&#x27;s spot in the CBL were sold in 2004 to the Pensacola Pelicans of the discontinued Southeastern League.

The franchise&#x27;s time in Ozark ended for good after only one season in the Frontier League once hotel magnate John Q. Hammons purchased the rights to the Double-A Texas League&#x27;s El Paso Diablos, renamed them the Cardinals and moved them to downtown Springfield. The Ducks moved to Ohio/Indiana and were renamed the Ohio Valley Redcoats

==Team Record==

The Mountain Ducks had a combined record of 261-312 over six seasons.

<doc id="65806" wikidata="Q5760" url="?curid=65806" title="Thebes, Greece">
<text>Thebes (; , &quot;Thíva&quot; ; , &quot;Thêbai&quot; ) is a city in Boeotia, Central Greece, and is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. It is the largest city in Boeotia and a major center for the area along with Livadeia and Tanagra.

It played an important role in Greek myths, as the site of the stories of Cadmus, Oedipus, Dionysus, Heracles and others. One myth had the city founded by Agenor, which gave rise to the (now somewhat obscure) name &quot;Agenorids&quot; to denote Thebans. Archaeological excavations in and around Thebes have revealed a Mycenaean settlement and clay tablets written in the Linear B script, indicating the importance of the site in the Bronze Age.

Thebes was the largest city of the ancient region of Boeotia and was the leader of the Boeotian confederacy. It was a major rival of ancient Athens, and sided with the Persians during the 480 BC invasion under Xerxes I. Theban forces under the command of Epaminondas ended Spartan hegemony at the Battle of Leuctra in 371 BC, with the Sacred Band of Thebes, an elite military unit of male lovers, celebrated as instrumental there. Macedonia would rise in power at the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC, bringing decisive victory to Philip II over an alliance of Thebes and Athens. Thebes was a major force in Greek history prior to its destruction by Alexander the Great in 335 BC, and was the dominant city-state at the time of the Macedonian conquest of Greece. During the Byzantine period, the city was famous for its silks.

The modern city contains an archaeological museum, the remains of the Cadmea (Bronze Age and forward citadel), and scattered ancient remains. The Holy Church of Luke the Evangelist is also in Thebes and contains Luke&#x27;s tomb and relics. Modern Thebes is the largest town of the regional unit of Boeotia.

==Municipality==
In 2011, as a consequence of the Kallikratis reform, Thebes was merged with Plataies, Thisvi, and Vagia to form a larger municipality, which retained the name Thebes. The other three became units of the larger municipality.

==History==
===Early history===
Archaeological excavations in and around Thebes have revealed cist graves dated to Mycenaean times containing weapons, ivory, and tablets written in Linear B. Its attested name forms and relevant terms on tablets found locally or elsewhere include , &quot;te-qa-i&quot;, understood to be read as *&quot;Tʰēgʷai̮s&quot; (Ancient Greek: , &quot;Thēbais&quot;, i.e. &quot;at Thebes&quot;, &quot;Thebes&quot; in the dative-locative case), , &quot;te-qa-de&quot;, for *&quot;Tʰēgʷasde&quot; (, &quot;Thēbasde&quot;, i.e. &quot;to Thebes&quot;), and , &quot;te-qa-ja&quot;, for *&quot;Tʰēgʷaja&quot; (, &quot;Thēbaia&quot;, i.e. &quot;Theban woman&quot;).

*&quot;Tʰēgʷai&quot; was one of the first Greek communities to be drawn together within a fortified city, and that it owed its importance in prehistoric days—as later—to its military strength. Deger-Jalkotzy claimed that the statue base from Kom el-Hetan in Amenhotep III&#x27;s kingdom (LHIIIA:1) mentions a name similar to Thebes, spelled out quasi-syllabically in hieroglyphs as &quot;d-q-e-i-s&quot;, and considered to be one of four &quot;tj-n3-jj&quot; (Danaan?) kingdoms worthy of note (alongside Knossos and Mycenae). *&quot;Tʰēgʷai&quot; in LHIIIB lost contact with Egypt but gained it with &quot;Miletus&quot; (Hittite: &quot;Milawata&quot;) and &quot;Cyprus&quot; (Hittite: &quot;Alashija&quot;). In the late LHIIIB, according to Palaima, *&quot;Tʰēgʷai&quot; was able to pull resources from Lamos near Mount Helicon, and from Karystos and Amarynthos on the Greek side of the isle of Euboia.

===Archaic and classical periods===
As attested already in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, Thebes was often called &quot;Seven-Gated Thebes&quot; (Θῆβαι ἑπτάπυλοι, &quot;Thebai heptapyloi&quot;) (&quot;Iliad&quot;, IV.406) to distinguish it from &quot;Hundred-Gated Thebes&quot; (Θῆβαι ἑκατόμπυλοι, &quot;Thebai hekatompyloi&quot;) in Egypt (&quot;Iliad&quot;, IX.383).
In the late 6th century BC, the Thebans were brought for the first time into hostile contact with the Athenians, who helped the small village of Plataea to maintain its independence against them, and in 506 BC repelled an inroad into Attica. The aversion to Athens best serves to explain the apparently unpatriotic attitude which Thebes displayed during the Persian invasion of Greece (480–479 BC). Though a contingent of 400 was sent to Thermopylae and remained there with Leonidas before being defeated alongside the Spartans, the governing aristocracy soon after joined King Xerxes I of Persia with great readiness and fought zealously on his behalf at the Battle of Plataea in 479 BC. The victorious Greeks subsequently punished Thebes by depriving it of the presidency of the Boeotian League and an attempt by the Spartans to expel it from the Delphic amphictyony was only frustrated by the intercession of Athens.
In 457 BC Sparta, needing a counterpoise against Athens in central Greece, reversed her policy and reinstated Thebes as the dominant power in Boeotia. The great citadel of Cadmea served this purpose well by holding out as a base of resistance when the Athenians overran and occupied the rest of the country (457–447 BC). In the Peloponnesian War, the Thebans, embittered by the support that Athens gave to the smaller Boeotian towns, and especially to Plataea, which they vainly attempted to reduce in 431 BC, were firm allies of Sparta, which in turn helped them to besiege Plataea and allowed them to destroy the town after its capture in 427 BC. In 424 BC, at the head of the Boeotian levy, they inflicted a severe defeat on an invading force of Athenians at the Battle of Delium, and for the first time displayed the effects of that firm military organization that eventually raised them to predominant power in Greece.

After the downfall of Athens at the end of the Peloponnesian War, the Thebans, having learned that Sparta intended to protect the states that Thebes desired to annex, broke off the alliance. In 404 BC, they had urged the complete destruction of Athens; yet, in 403 BC, they secretly supported the restoration of its democracy in order to find in it a counterpoise against Sparta. A few years later, influenced perhaps in part by Persian gold, they formed the nucleus of the league against Sparta. At the Battle of Haliartus (395 BC) and the Battle of Coronea (394 BC), they again proved their rising military capacity by standing their ground against the Spartans. The result of the war was especially disastrous to Thebes, as the general settlement of 387 BC stipulated the complete autonomy of all Greek towns and so withdrew the other Boeotians from its political control. Its power was further curtailed in 382 BC, when a Spartan force occupied the citadel by a treacherous &quot;coup de main&quot;. Three years later, the Spartan garrison was expelled and a democratic constitution was set up in place of the traditional oligarchy. In the consequent wars with Sparta, the Theban army, trained and led by Epaminondas and Pelopidas, proved itself formidable (see also: Sacred Band of Thebes). Years of desultory fighting, in which Thebes established its control over all Boeotia, culminated in 371 BC in a remarkable victory over the Spartans at Leuctra. The winners were hailed throughout Greece as champions of the oppressed. They carried their arms into Peloponnesus and at the head of a large coalition, permanently crippled the power of Sparta, in part by freeing many helot slaves, the basis of the Spartan economy. Similar expeditions were sent to Thessaly and Macedon to regulate the affairs of those regions.

===Decline and destruction===

The predominance of Thebes was short-lived, as the states that it protected refused to subject themselves permanently to its control. Thebes renewed its rivalry with Athens, which had joined with them in 395 BC in fear of Sparta, but since 387 BC had endeavoured to maintain the balance of power against its ally, preventing the formation of a Theban empire. With the death of Epaminondas at the Battle of Mantinea (362 BC), the city sank again to the position of a secondary power.

In the Third Sacred War (356–346 BC) with its neighbor Phocis, Thebes lost its predominance in central Greece. By asking Philip II of Macedon to crush the Phocians, Thebes extended the former&#x27;s power within dangerous proximity to its frontiers. The revulsion of popular feeling in Thebes was expressed in 338 BC by the orator Demosthenes, who persuaded Thebes to join Athens in a final attempt to bar Philip&#x27;s advance on Attica. The Theban contingent lost the decisive battle of Chaeronea and along with it every hope of reassuming control over Greece.

Philip was content to deprive Thebes of its dominion over Boeotia; but an unsuccessful revolt in 335 BC against his son Alexander the Great while he was campaigning in the north was punished by Alexander and his Greek allies with the destruction of the city (except, according to tradition, the house of the poet Pindar and the temples), and its territory divided between the other Boeotian cities. Moreover, the Thebans themselves were sold into slavery.

Alexander spared only priests, leaders of the pro-Macedonian party and descendants of Pindar. The end of Thebes cowed Athens into submission. According to Plutarch, a special Athenian embassy, led by Phocion, an opponent of the anti-Macedonian faction, was able to persuade Alexander to give up his demands for the exile of leaders of the anti-Macedonian party, and most particularly Demosthenes and not sell the people into slavery.

===Hellenistic period===

Ancient writings tend to treat Alexander&#x27;s destruction of Thebes as excessive. Plutarch, however, writes that Alexander grieved after his excess, granting them any request of favors, and advising they pay attention to the invasion of Asia, and that if he failed, Thebes might once again become the ruling city-state. Although Thebes had traditionally been antagonistic to whichever state led the Greek world, siding with the Persians when they invaded against the Athenian-Spartan alliance, siding with Sparta when Athens seemed omnipotent, and famously derailing the Spartan invasion of Persia by Agesilaus. Alexander&#x27;s father Philip had been raised in Thebes, albeit as a hostage, and had learnt much of the art of war from Pelopidas. Philip had honoured this fact, always seeking alliances with the Boeotians, even in the lead-up to Chaeronea. Thebes was also revered as the most ancient of Greek cities, with a history of over 1,000 years. Plutarch relates that, during his later conquests, whenever Alexander came across a former Theban, he would attempt to redress his destruction of Thebes with favours to that individual.

====Restoration by Cassander====
Following Alexander the Great&#x27;s death in 323 BC, Thebes was re-established in 315 BC by Cassander, one of the diadochi who was ruling in Greece. In restoring Thebes, Cassander sought to rectify the perceived wrongs of Alexander – a gesture of generosity that earned him much goodwill throughout Greece. In addition to currying favor with the Athenians and many of the Peloponnesian states, Cassander&#x27;s restoration of Thebes provided him with loyal allies in the Theban exiles who returned to resettle the site.

Cassander&#x27;s plan for rebuilding Thebes called for the various Greek city-states to provide skilled labor and manpower, and ultimately it proved successful. The Athenians, for example, rebuilt much of Thebes&#x27; wall. Major contributions were sent from Megalopolis, Messene, and as far away as Sicily and Italy.

Despite the restoration, Thebes never regained its former prominence. The death of Cassander in 297 BC created a power vacuum throughout much of Greece, which contributed, in part, to Thebes&#x27; besiegement by Demetrius Poliorcetes in 293 BC, and again after a revolt in 292 BC. This last siege was difficult and Demetrius was wounded, but finally he managed to break down the walls and to take the city once more, treating it mildly despite its fierce resistance. The city recovered its autonomy from Demetrius in 287 BC, and became allied with Lysimachus, the king of Thrace, and the Aetolian League.

===Roman and Byzantine period===

After the dissolution of the Boeotian League after the Achaean War of 146 BC, Thebes came under Roman rule. In 27 BC, the city was included in the newly established Province of Achaia. Thebes was assigned to the Eastern Roman Empire after the imperial division of 395. During the early Byzantine period it served as a place of refuge against foreign invaders. In the late 7th century, Justinian II created the Theme of Hellas with Thebes as the capital. The Holy church of Luke the Evangelist was built around the 10th century to commemorate the saint&#x27;s tomb and relics at the location of his death. During the Byzantine–Bulgarian war of 913–927, Thebes was sacked by Simeon I of Bulgaria. 

From the 10th century, Thebes became a centre of the new silk trade, its silk workshops boosted by imports of soaps and dyes from Athens. The growth of this trade in Thebes continued to such an extent that by the middle of the 12th century, the city had become the biggest producer of silks in the entire Byzantine empire, surpassing even the Byzantine capital, Constantinople. The women of Thebes were famed for their skills at weaving. Theban silk was prized above all others during this period, both for its quality and its excellent reputation.

Benjamin of Tudela visited Thebes around 1161 or 1162. At that time, the city served as a regional administrative center, home to a local elite, a major producer of silk textiles, and an important regional market, all of which contributed to urban and demographic growth. Although there is no specific data on Thebes&#x27; overall population, estimates suggest it housed between 20,000 and 30,000 inhabitants, typical for a major Byzantine provincial city. Benjamin of Tudela reported that Thebes had a Jewish population of 2,000, the largest Jewish community in any Byzantine city of the 12th century, except for Constantinople.

Though severely plundered by the Normans in 1146, Thebes quickly recovered its prosperity and continued to grow rapidly until its conquest by the Latins of the Fourth Crusade in 1205.

===Latin period===
Thanks to its wealth, the city was selected by the Frankish dynasty de la Roche as its capital, before it was permanently moved to Athens. After 1240, the Saint Omer family controlled the city jointly with the de la Roche dukes. The castle built by Nicholas II of Saint Omer on the Cadmea was one of the most beautiful of Frankish Greece. After its conquest in 1311 the city was used as a capital by the short-lived state of the Catalan Company.

In 1379, the Navarrese Company took the city with the aid of the Latin Archbishop of Thebes, Simon Atumano.

===Ottoman period===
Latin hegemony in Thebes lasted to 1458, when the Ottomans captured it. The Ottomans renamed Thebes &quot;İstefe&quot; and managed it until the Greek War of Independence (1821, nominally to 1832) except for a Venetian interlude between 1687 and 1699.

===Modern town===
In the modern Greek State, Thebes was the capital of the prefecture of Boeotia until the late 19th century, when Livadeia became the capital.

Today, Thebes is a bustling market town, known for its many products and wares. Until the 1980s, it had a flourishing agrarian production with some industrial complexes. However, during the late 1980s and 1990s the bulk of industry moved further south, closer to Athens. Tourism in the area is based mainly in Thebes and the surrounding villages, where many places of interest related to antiquity exist such as the battlefield where the Battle of Plataea took place. The proximity to other, more famous travel destinations, like Athens and Chalkis, and the undeveloped archaeological sites have kept the tourist numbers low. A notable portion of the inhabitants of Thebes are Arvanites.
== In Greek myth ==

The record of the earliest days of Thebes was preserved among the Greeks in an abundant mass of legends that rival the myths of Troy in their wide ramification and the influence that they exerted on the literature of the classical age. Five main cycles of story may be distinguished:
#The foundation of the citadel Cadmea by Cadmus, and the growth of the Spartoi or &quot;Sown Men&quot; (probably an aetiological myth designed to explain the origin of the Theban nobility which bore that name in historical times).
#The immolation of Semele and the advent of Dionysus.
#The building of a &quot;seven-gated&quot; wall by Amphion, and the cognate stories of Zethus, Antiope and Dirce.
#The tale of Laius, whose misdeeds culminated in the tragedy of Oedipus and the wars of the Seven against Thebes and the Epigoni, and the downfall of his house; Laius&#x27; pederastic rape of Chrysippus was held by some ancients to have been the first instance of homosexuality among mortals, and may have provided an etiology for the practice of pedagogic pederasty for which Thebes was famous.
#The exploits of Heracles.

The Greeks attributed the foundation of Thebes to Cadmus, a Phoenician king from Tyre (now in Lebanon) and the brother of Queen Europa. Cadmus was famous for teaching the Phoenician alphabet and building the Acropolis, which was named the Cadmeia in his honor and was an intellectual, spiritual, and cultural center.

==Geography==
Thebes is situated in a plain, between Lake Yliki (ancient &quot;Hylica&quot;) to the north, and the Cithaeron mountains, which divide Boeotia from Attica, to the south. Its elevation is above mean sea level. It is about northwest of Athens, and southeast of Lamia. The A1 motorway and the Athens–Thessaloniki railway connect Thebes with Athens and northern Greece. The municipality of Thebes covers an area of , the municipal unit of Thebes and the community .

===Climate===
According to the nearby weather station of Aliartos, Thebes has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Csa&quot;) with hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. During the winter months, Thebes is sometimes affected by the Aegean sea-effect snow, with snow depths reaching over on several occasions. Due to its inland location, Thebes may also record very low minimums. In recent years, as registered by the meteorological station operated by the National Observatory of Athens within the city limits, the record minimum temperature is , recorded on 10 January 2017. In contrast, the city can be very hot in the summer during heat waves, having reached a record high of on 3 August 2021.

<text>In Australia, &quot;Aarhus&quot; Historic Shipwreck is a historical site preserving one of the victims of Smith&#x27;s Rock. The &quot;Aarhus&quot; was a 640-tonne sailing barque built in 1875 in Hamburg, Germany. The vessel measured in length.

While carrying a general cargo including kerosene from New York to Brisbane, Australia, they hit Smith&#x27;s Rock, which lies about two nautical miles (4 km) north-east of Cape Moreton, and sank on 24 February 1894.

The remains of the ship now lie upright in 20 metres of water, though most of the ship has been reduced to plates and ribs sticking out of the sand. It has been gazetted under Section 7 of the &quot;Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976&quot; which provides for a special protected zone of 200m around the wreck. The &quot;Historic Shipwrecks Act&quot; 1976 was superseded in 2019 with the &quot;Underwater Cultural Heritage&quot; Act 2018 Any disturbance activity is prohibited; divers are required to apply to the Department of the Environment and Science (QLD State) for a permit to access the wreck.

This site has much interesting sea-life, from small to large batfish at cleaning stations everywhere. Another point of interest is the large mast-like object that is actually the bowsprit. This area reportedly has a cat shark inhabiting the bowsprit and a large wobbegong shark under the scoured out section. The site can have very good visibility but a strong current makes it hard to see the entire wreck in one dive.

<text>Thebes (, , &quot;Thēbai&quot;), known to the ancient Egyptians as Waset, was an ancient Egyptian city located along the Nile about south of the Mediterranean. Its ruins lie within the modern Egyptian city of Luxor. Thebes was the main city of the fourth Upper Egyptian nome (Sceptre nome) and was the capital of Egypt for long periods during the Middle Kingdom and New Kingdom eras. It was close to Nubia and the Eastern Desert, with its valuable mineral resources and trade routes. It was a religious center and the most venerated city during many periods of ancient Egyptian history. The site of Thebes includes areas on both the eastern bank of the Nile, where the temples of Karnak and Luxor stand and where the city was situated; and the western bank, where a necropolis of large private and royal cemeteries and funerary complexes can be found. In 1979, the ruins of ancient Thebes were classified by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.

==Toponymy==
The Egyptian name for Thebes was &quot;wꜣs.t&quot;, &quot;City of the &quot;wꜣs&quot;&quot;, the sceptre of the pharaohs, a long staff with an animal&#x27;s head and a forked base. From the end of the New Kingdom, Thebes was known in Egyptian as , the &quot;City of Amun&quot;, the chief of the Theban Triad of deities whose other members were Mut and Khonsu. This name of Thebes appears in the Tanakh as the () in the Book of Nahum and also as &quot;No&quot; () mentioned in the Book of Ezekiel and Jeremiah.

&quot;Thebes&quot; is sometimes claimed to be the Latinised form of , the hellenized form of Demotic Egyptian &quot;tꜣ jpt&quot; (&quot;the temple&quot;), referring to &quot;jpt-swt&quot;. Today, the temple is known as Karnak, and is located on the northeast bank of the city. Since Homer refers to the metropolis by this name, and since Demotic script did not appear until a later date, the etymology is doubtful. As early as Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, the Greeks distinguished the Egyptian Thebes as (, &quot;Thēbai hekatómpyloi&quot;) or &quot;Hundred-Gated Thebes&quot;, as opposed to the &quot;Thebes of the Seven Gates&quot; (, &quot;Thēbai heptápyloi&quot;) in Boeotia, Greece.

In the , Amun was rendered as Zeus Ammon. The name was therefore translated into Greek as Diospolis, &quot;City of Zeus&quot;. To distinguish it from the numerous other cities by this name, it was known as the (, &quot;Diospolis Megálē&quot;; ). The Greek names came into wider use after the conquest of Egypt by Alexander the Great, when the country came to be ruled by the Macedonian Ptolemaic dynasty.

==Characteristics==
===Geography===
Thebes was located along the banks of the Nile River in the middle part of Upper Egypt about 800 km south of the Delta. It was built largely on the alluvial plains of the Nile Valley, which follows a great bend of the Nile. As a natural consequence, the city was laid in a northeast–southwest axis parallel to the contemporary river channel. Thebes had an area of , which included parts of the Theban Hills in the west that culminates at the sacred al-Qurn. In the east lies the mountainous Eastern Desert with its wadis draining into the valley. Significant among these wadis is Wadi Hammamat near Thebes. It was used as an overland trade route going to the Red Sea coast. Wadi Hammamat was the primary trade route linking Egypt to the Red Sea since Pre-Dynastic times. Uruk civilization was transmitted to Egypt along this corridor. It is the likely that Thinis, the capital of the First Dynasty, was located in the same region as Thebes for this reason. Both cities were at a crossroad region in Upper Egypt between the Nile in the north to south direction and Saharan caravan routes connecting to Red Sea maritime routes via Wadi Hammamat in the East West direction. The Wadi el-Hol is also located near Thebes; this valley connected Thebes to an oasis on the Western Desert. It is notable for the first Proto-Sinatic alphabet inscription, which appeared shortly after Thebes became the capital of Egypt.

Nearby towns in the fourth Upper Egyptian nome were Per-Hathor, Madu, Djerty, Iuny, Sumenu and Imiotru.

===Demographics===
According to George Modelski, Thebes had about 40,000 inhabitants in 2000 BC (compared to 60,000 in Memphis, the largest city in the world at the time). By 1800 BC, the population of Memphis was down to about 30,000, making Thebes the largest city in Egypt at the time. Historian Ian Morris has estimated that by 1500 BC, Thebes may have grown to be the largest city in the world, with a population of about 75,000, a position it held until about 900 BC, when it was surpassed by Nimrud (among others).

Shomarka Keita reported that a 2005 study on mummified remains found that &quot;some Theban nobles had a histology which indicated notably dark skin&quot;.

===Economy===
The archaeological remains of Thebes offer a striking testimony to Egyptian civilization at its height. The Greek poet Homer extolled the wealth of Thebes in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, Book 9 (): &quot;... in Egyptian Thebes the heaps of precious ingots gleam, the hundred-gated Thebes.&quot;

===Culture===
More than sixty annual festivals were celebrated in Thebes. The major festivals among these, according to the Edfu Geographical Text, were: the Beautiful Feast of Opet, the Khoiak (Festival), Festival of I Shemu, and Festival of II Shemu. Another popular festivity was the halloween-like Beautiful Festival of the Valley.

==History ==
===Old Kingdom===
Thebes was inhabited from around 3200 BC. It was the eponymous capital of Waset, the fourth Upper Egyptian nome. At this time it was still a small trading post, while Memphis served as the royal residence of the Old Kingdom pharaohs. Although no buildings survive in Thebes older than portions of the Karnak temple complex that may date from the Middle Kingdom, the lower part of a statue of Pharaoh Nyuserre of the 5th Dynasty has been found in Karnak. Another statue dedicated by the 12th Dynasty king Senusret may have been usurped and re-used, since the statue bears a cartouche of Nyuserre on its belt. Since seven rulers of the 4th to 6th Dynasties appear on the Karnak king list, perhaps at the least there was a temple in the Theban area that dated to the Old Kingdom.

===First Intermediate Period===
By 2160 BC, a new line of pharaohs (the Ninth and Tenth Dynasties) consolidated control over Lower Egypt and northern parts of Upper Egypt from their capital in Herakleopolis Magna. A rival line (the Eleventh Dynasty), based at Thebes, ruled the remaining part of Upper Egypt. The Theban rulers were apparently descendants of the prince of Thebes, Intef the Elder. His probable grandson Intef I was the first of the family to claim in life a partial pharaonic titulary, though his power did not extend much further than the general Theban region.

===Middle Kingdom===
Finally by , Intef III&#x27;s son Mentuhotep II (meaning &quot;Montu is satisfied&quot;), took the Herakleopolitans by force and reunited Egypt once again under one ruler, thereby starting the period now known as the Middle Kingdom. Mentuhotep II ruled for 51 years and built the first mortuary temple at Deir el-Bahri, which most likely served as the inspiration for the later and larger temple built next to it by Hatshepsut in the 18th Dynasty. After these events, the 11th Dynasty was short-lived, as less than twenty years had elapsed between the death of Mentuhotep II and that of Mentuhotep IV, in mysterious circumstances.

During the 12th Dynasty, Amenemhat I moved the seat of power North to Itjtawy. Thebes continued to thrive as a religious center as the local god Amun was becoming increasingly prominent throughout Egypt. The oldest remains of a temple dedicated to Amun date to the reign of Senusret I. Thebes was already, in the Middle Kingdom, a town of considerable size. Excavations around the Karnak temple show that the Middle Kingdom town had a layout with a grid pattern. The city was at least one kilometre long and 50 hectares in area. Remains of two palatial buildings were also detected.

Starting in the later part of the 12th Dynasty, a group of Canaanite people began settling in the eastern Nile Delta. They eventually founded the 14th Dynasty at Avaris in or . By doing so, the Asiatics established hegemony over the majority of the Delta region, subtracting these territories from the influence of the 13th Dynasty that had meanwhile succeeded the 12th.

===Second Intermediate Period===
A second wave of Asiatics called Hyksos (from &quot;Heqa-khasut&quot;, &quot;rulers of foreign lands&quot; as Egyptians called their leaders) immigrated into Egypt and overran the Canaanite center of power at Avaris, starting the 15th Dynasty there. The Hyksos kings gained the upper hand over Lower Egypt early into the Second Intermediate Period (1657–1549 BC). When the Hyksos took Memphis during or shortly after Merneferre Ay&#x27;s reign (), the rulers of the 13th Dynasty fled south to Thebes, which was restored as capital.

Theban princes (now known as the 16th Dynasty) stood firmly over their immediate region as the Hyksos advanced from the Delta southwards to Middle Egypt. The Thebans resisted the Hyksos&#x27; further advance by making an agreement for a peaceful concurrent rule between them. The Hyksos were able to sail upstream past Thebes to trade with the Nubians and the Thebans brought their herds to the Delta without adversaries. The status quo continued until Hyksos ruler Apophis (15th Dynasty) insulted Seqenenre Tao (17th Dynasty) of Thebes. Soon the armies of Thebes marched on the Hyksos-ruled lands. Tao died in battle and his son Kamose took charge of the campaign. After Kamose&#x27;s death, his brother Ahmose I continued until he captured Avaris, the Hyksos capital. Ahmose I drove the Hyksos out of Egypt and the Levant and reclaimed the lands formerly ruled by them.

===New Kingdom and the height of Thebes===
Ahmose I founded a new age for a unified Egypt with Thebes as its capital. The city remained as capital during most of the 18th Dynasty (New Kingdom). It also became the center for a newly established professional civil service, where there was a greater demand for scribes and the literate as the royal archives began to fill with accounts and reports. At the city the favored few of 
Nubia were reeducated with Egyptian culture, to serve as administrators of the colony.

With Egypt stabilized again, religion and religious centers flourished and none more so than Thebes. For instance, Amenhotep III poured much of his vast wealth from foreign tribute into the temples of Amun. The Theban god Amun became a principal state deity and every building project sought to outdo the last in proclaiming the glory of Amun and the pharaohs themselves. Thutmose I (reigned 1506–1493 BC) began the first great expansion of the Karnak temple. After this, colossal enlargements of the temple became the norm throughout the New Kingdom.

Queen Hatshepsut (reigned 1479–1458 BC) helped the Theban economy flourish by renewing trade networks, primarily the Red Sea trade between Thebes&#x27; Red Sea port of Al-Qusayr, Elat and the land of Punt. Her successor Thutmose III brought to Thebes a great deal of his war booty that originated from as far away as Mittani. The 18th Dynasty reached its peak during his great-grandson Amenhotep III&#x27;s reign (1388–1350 BC). Aside from embellishing the temples of Amun, Amenhotep increased construction in Thebes to unprecedented levels. On the west bank, he built the enormous mortuary temple and the equally massive Malkata palace-city, which fronted a 364-hectare artificial lake. In the city proper he built the Luxor temple and the Avenue of the Sphinxes leading to Karnak.

For a brief period in the reign of Amenhotep III&#x27;s son Akhenaten (1351–1334 BC), Thebes fell on hard times; the city was abandoned by the court, and the worship of Amun was proscribed. The capital was moved to the new city of Akhetaten (Amarna in modern Egypt), midway between Thebes and Memphis. After his death, his son Tutankhamun returned the capital to Memphis, but renewed building projects at Thebes produced even more glorious temples and shrines.

With the 19th Dynasty the seat of government moved to the Delta. Thebes maintained its revenues and prestige through the reigns of Seti I (1290–1279 BC) and Ramesses II (1279–1213 BC), who still resided for part of every year in Thebes. Ramesses II carried out extensive building projects in the city, such as statues and obelisks, the third enclosure wall of Karnak temple, additions to the Luxor temple, and the Ramesseum, his grand mortuary temple. The constructions were bankrolled by the large granaries (built around the Ramesseum) that concentrated the taxes collected from Upper Egypt; and by the gold from expeditions to Nubia and the Eastern Desert. During Ramesses&#x27; long 66-year reign, Egypt and Thebes reached an overwhelming state of prosperity that equaled or even surpassed the earlier peak under Amenhotep III.

The city continued to be well kept in the early 20th Dynasty. The Great Harris Papyrus states that Ramesses III (reigned 1187–56) donated 86,486 slaves and vast estates to the temples of Amun. Ramesses III received tributes from all subject peoples including the Sea Peoples and Meshwesh Libyans. The whole of Egypt was experiencing financial problems, however, exemplified in the events at Thebes&#x27; village of Deir el-Medina. In the 25th year of his reign, workers in Deir el-Medina began striking for pay and there arose a general unrest of all social classes. Subsequently, an unsuccessful Harem conspiracy led to the executions of many conspirators, including Theban officials and women.

Under the later Ramessids, Thebes began to decline as the government fell into grave economic difficulties. During the reign of Ramesses IX (1129–1111 BC), about 1114 BC, a series of investigations into the plundering of royal tombs in the necropolis of western Thebes uncovered proof of corruption in high places, following an accusation made by the mayor of the east bank against his colleague on the west. The plundered royal mummies were moved from place to place and at last deposited by the priests of Amun in a tomb-shaft in Deir el-Bahri and in the tomb of Amenhotep II. (The finding of these two hiding places in 1881 and 1898, respectively, was one of the great events of modern archaeological discovery.) Such maladministration in Thebes led to unrest.
===Third Intermediate Period===
Control of local affairs tended to come more and more into the hands of the High Priests of Amun, so that during the Third Intermediate Period, the High Priest of Amun exerted absolute power over the South, a counterbalance to the 21st and 22nd Dynasty kings who ruled from the Delta. Intermarriage and adoption strengthened the ties between them, daughters of the Tanite kings being installed as God&#x27;s Wife of Amun at Thebes, where they wielded greater power. Theban political influence receded only in the Late Period.

By around 750 BC, the Kushites (Nubians) were growing their influence over Thebes and Upper Egypt. In 721 BC, King Shabaka of the Kushites defeated the combined forces of Osorkon IV (22nd Dynasty), Peftjauawybast (23rd Dynasty) Bakenranef (24th Dynasty) and reunified Egypt yet again. His reign saw a significant amount of building work undertaken throughout Egypt, especially at the city of Thebes, which he made the capital of his kingdom. In Karnak he erected a pink granite statue of himself wearing the Pschent (the double crown of Egypt). Taharqa accomplished many notable projects at Thebes (i.e. the Kiosk in Karnak) and Nubia before the Assyrians started to wage war against Egypt.

===Late Period===
In 667 BC, attacked by the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal&#x27;s army, Taharqa abandoned Lower Egypt and fled to Thebes. After his death three years later his nephew (or cousin) Tantamani seized Thebes, invaded Lower Egypt and laid siege to Memphis, but abandoned his attempts to conquer the country in 663 BC and retreated southwards. The Assyrians pursued him and took Thebes, whose name was added to a long list of cities plundered and destroyed by the Assyrians, as Ashurbanipal wrote:
This city, the whole of it, I conquered it with the help of Ashur and Ishtar. Silver, gold, precious stones, all the wealth of the palace, rich cloth, precious linen, great horses, supervising men and women, two obelisks of splendid electrum, weighing 2,500 talents, the doors of temples I tore from their bases and carried them off to Assyria. With this weighty booty I left Thebes. Against Egypt and Kush I have lifted my spear and shown my power. With full hands I have returned to Nineveh, in good health.
Thebes never regained its former political significance, but it remained an important religious centre. Assyrians installed Psamtik I (664–610 BC), who ascended to Thebes in 656 BC and brought about the adoption of his own daughter, Nitocris I, as heiress to God&#x27;s Wife of Amun there. In 525 BC, Persian Cambyses II invaded Egypt and became pharaoh, subordinating the kingdom as a satrapy to the greater Achaemenid Empire.

===Graeco-Roman Period===
The good relationship of the Thebans with the central power in the North ended when the native Egyptian pharaohs were finally replaced by Greeks, led by Alexander the Great. He visited Thebes during a celebration of the Opet Festival. In spite of his welcoming visit, Thebes became a center for dissent. Towards the end of the third century BC, Hugronaphor (Horwennefer), possibly of Nubian origin, led a revolt against the Ptolemies in Upper Egypt. His successor, Ankhmakis, held large parts of Upper Egypt until 185 BC. This revolt was supported by the Theban priesthood. After the suppression of the revolt in 185 BC, Ptolemy V, in need of the support of the priesthood, pardoned them.

Half a century later the Thebans rose again, elevating a certain Harsiesi to the throne in 132 BC. Harsiesi, having helped himself to the funds of the royal bank at Thebes, fled the following year. In 91 BC, another revolt broke out. In the following years, Thebes was subdued, and the city turned into rubble.

During the Roman occupation (30 BC–641 AD), the remaining communities clustered around the pylon of the Luxor temple. Thebes became part of the Roman province of &quot;Thebais&quot;, which later split into &quot;Thebais Superior&quot;, centered at the city, and &quot;Thebais Inferior&quot;, centered at Ptolemais Hermiou. A Roman legion was headquartered in Luxor temple at the time of Roman campaigns in Nubia. Building did not come to an abrupt stop, but the city continued to decline. In the first century AD, Strabo described Thebes as having been relegated to a mere village.

==Major sites==
Eastern Thebes:
* Ancient built-up area
* Great Temple of Amun at Karnak (Ancient Egyptian &quot;Ta-opet&quot;). Still the second largest religious building ever built, it is the main house of worship for Amun, Thebes&#x27; patron deity, and the residence of the powerful Amun priesthood. What differentiated it from the many temples of Egypt is the length of time it was built over (more than 2,000 years, starting in the Middle Kingdom). The main features of this temple are its ten large pylons, the Great Hypostyle Hall, a sacred lake, sub-temples, numerous shrines and multiple obelisks. It was the most important temple for a majority of Ancient Egyptian history.
* Luxor Temple (&quot;Ipet resyt&quot;). Unlike the other temples in Thebes, it is not dedicated to a cult god or a deified version of the king in death. Instead, it is dedicated to the rejuvenation of kingship; it may have been where many of the pharaohs of Egypt were crowned. It is a centerpiece of the &quot;Opet Festival&quot;, where the sacred barque of the Theban Triad travels from Karnak to Luxor temple highlighting the godly significance of the pharaoh&#x27;s re-coronation .
* Temple of Khonsu
* Precinct of Mut
* Precinct of Montu
* Avenue of Sphinxes

Western Thebes:
* Village of Deir el-Medina
* Malkata palace complex
* Ramesseum
* Mortuary Temple of Amenhotep III
* Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut
* Mortuary Temple of Seti I
* Mortuary Temple of Ramesses III
* Valley of the Kings
* Valley of the Queens
* Tombs of the Nobles
* The Rise of Aten

==Cultural heritage==
The two great temples—Luxor Temple and Karnak—and the Valley of the Kings and the Valley of the Queens are among the greatest achievements of ancient Egypt.

From 25 October 2018 to 27 January 2019, the Museum of Grenoble organized with the support of the Louvre and the British Museum, a three-month exhibition on the city of Thebes and the role of women in the city at that time.

==In popular culture==
In popular culture, Thebes is a setting in the films &quot;The Mummy&quot; (1999) and &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot; (2001). It is said to be the &quot;Land of the Living&quot;. (In real history, there was no such name given to it.) The films feature scenes taking place in ancient Egypt in its prime, which affect the story in the modern setting some 3000 years later. In &quot;The Egyptian&quot; by the author Mika Waltari, there are elaborate descriptions on how Thebes looked during the 18th Dynasty of Ancient Egypt.

<text>A pastiche () is a work of visual art, literature, theatre, music, or architecture that imitates the style or character of the work of one or more other artists. Unlike parody, pastiche pays homage to the work it imitates, rather than mocking it.

The word is the French borrowing of the Italian noun , which is a pâté or pie-filling mixed from diverse ingredients. Its first recorded use in this sense was in 1878. Metaphorically, and describe works that are either composed by several authors, or that incorporate stylistic elements of other artists&#x27; work. Pastiche is an example of eclecticism in art.

Allusion is not pastiche. A literary allusion may refer to another work, but it does not reiterate it. Allusion requires the audience to share in the author&#x27;s cultural knowledge. Allusion and pastiche are both mechanisms of intertextuality.

==By art==

===Literature===

In literary usage, the term denotes a literary technique employing a generally light-hearted tongue-in-cheek imitation of another&#x27;s style; although jocular, it is usually respectful. The word implies a lack of originality or coherence, an imitative jumble, but with the advent of postmodernism, pastiche has become positively construed as a deliberate, witty homage or playful imitation.

For example, many stories featuring Sherlock Holmes, originally penned by Arthur Conan Doyle, have been written as pastiches since the author&#x27;s time. Ellery Queen and Nero Wolfe are other popular subjects of mystery parodies and pastiches.

A similar example of pastiche is the posthumous continuations of the Robert E. Howard stories, written by other writers without Howard&#x27;s authorization. This includes the Conan the Barbarian stories of L. Sprague de Camp and Lin Carter.
David Lodge&#x27;s novel &quot;The British Museum Is Falling Down&quot; (1965) is a pastiche of works by Joyce, Kafka, and Virginia Woolf. In 1991, Alexandra Ripley wrote the novel &quot;Scarlett&quot;, a pastiche of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, in an unsuccessful attempt to have it recognized as a canonical sequel.

In 2017, John Banville published &quot;Mrs. Osmond&quot;, a sequel to Henry James&#x27;s &quot;The Portrait of a Lady&quot;, written in a style similar to that of James. In 2018, Ben Schott published &quot;Jeeves and the King of Clubs&quot;, an homage to P. G. Wodehouse&#x27;s character Jeeves, with the blessing of the Wodehouse estate.

===Music===

Charles Rosen has characterized Mozart&#x27;s various works in imitation of Baroque style as pastiche, and Edvard Grieg&#x27;s &quot;Holberg Suite&quot; was written as a conscious homage to the music of an earlier age. Some of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky&#x27;s works, such as his &quot;Variations on a Rococo Theme&quot; and &quot;Serenade for Strings&quot;, employ a poised &quot;classical&quot; form reminiscent of 18th-century composers such as Mozart (the composer whose work was his favorite). Perhaps one of the best examples of pastiche in modern music is that of George Rochberg, who used the technique in his String Quartet No. 3 of 1972 and Music for the Magic Theater. Rochberg turned to pastiche from serialism after the death of his son in 1963.

&quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; by Queen is unusual as it is a pastiche in both senses of the word, as there are many distinct styles imitated in the song, all &quot;hodge-podged&quot; together to create one piece of music. A similar earlier example is &quot;Happiness is a Warm Gun&quot; by the Beatles. One can find musical &quot;pastiches&quot; throughout the work of the American composer Frank Zappa. Comedian/parodist &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic has also recorded several songs that are pastiches of other popular recording artists, such as Devo (&quot;Dare to Be Stupid&quot;), Talking Heads (&quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot;), Rage Against the Machine (&quot;I&#x27;ll Sue Ya&quot;), and The Doors (&quot;Craigslist&quot;), though these so-called &quot;style parodies&quot; often walk the line between celebration (pastiche) and send-up (parody). Acclaimed Alternative rock band Ween, known for their eclectic catalog of inspirations, have been argued to have created pastiches superior to their source inspirations.

A &quot;pastiche Mass&quot; is a musical Mass where the constituent movements come from different Mass settings. Most often, this convention has been chosen for concert performances, particularly by early-music ensembles. Masses are composed of movements: Kyrie, Gloria, Credo, Sanctus, Agnus Dei; for example, the &quot;Missa Solemnis&quot; by Beethoven and the &quot;Messe de Nostre Dame&quot; by Guillaume de Machaut. In a pastiche Mass, the performers may choose a Kyrie from one composer, and a Gloria from another; or choose a Kyrie from one setting of an individual composer, and a Gloria from another.

===Musical theatre===
In musical theatre, pastiche is often an indispensable tool for evoking the sounds of a particular era for which a show is set. For the 1971 musical &quot;Follies&quot;, a show about a reunion of performers from a musical revue set between the World Wars, Stephen Sondheim wrote over a dozen songs in the style of Broadway songwriters of the 1920s and 1930s. Sondheim imitates not only the music of composers such as Cole Porter, Irving Berlin, Jerome Kern, and George Gershwin but also the lyrics of writers such as Ira Gershwin, Dorothy Fields, Otto Harbach, and Oscar Hammerstein II. For example, Sondheim notes that the torch song &quot;Losing My Mind&quot; sung in the show contains &quot;near-stenciled rhythms and harmonies&quot; from the Gershwins&#x27; &quot;The Man I Love&quot; and lyrics written in the style of Dorothy Fields. Examples of musical pastiche also appear in other Sondheim shows including &quot;Gypsy&quot;, &quot;Saturday Night&quot;, &quot;Assassins&quot;, and &quot;Anyone Can Whistle&quot;.

===Film===
Pastiche can also be a cinematic device whereby filmmakers pay homage to another filmmaker&#x27;s style and use of cinematography, including camera angles, lighting, and mise en scène. A film&#x27;s writer may also offer a pastiche based on the works of other writers (this is especially evident in historical films and documentaries but can be found in non-fiction drama, comedy and horror films as well). Italian director Sergio Leone&#x27;s &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot; is a pastiche of earlier American Westerns. Another major filmmaker, Quentin Tarantino, often uses various plots, characteristics, and themes from many films to create his films, among them from the films of Sergio Leone, in effect creating a pastiche of a pastiche. Tarantino has openly stated that &quot;I steal from every single movie ever made.&quot; Director Todd Haynes&#x27; 2002 film &quot;Far from Heaven&quot; was a conscious attempt to replicate a typical Douglas Sirk melodrama—in particular &quot;All That Heaven Allows&quot;.

In cinema, the influence of George Lucas&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars&quot; films (spawning their own pastiches, such as the 1983 3D film &quot;&quot;) can be regarded as a function of postmodernity.

===Architecture===

In discussions of urban planning, the term &quot;pastiche&quot; may describe developments as imitations of the building styles created by major architects: with the implication that the derivative work is unoriginal and of little merit, and the term is generally attributed without reference to its urban context. Many 19th and 20th century European developments can in this way be described as pastiches, such as the work of Vincent Harris and Edwin Lutyens who created early 20th century Neoclassical and Neo-Georgian architectural developments in Britain, or of later pastiche works based on the architecture of the modernist Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and the Bauhaus movement. The term itself is not pejorative. Alain de Botton described it as &quot;an unconvincing reproduction of the styles of the past&quot;.

<text>In organosilicon and polymer chemistry, a silicone or polysiloxane is a polymer composed of repeating units of siloxane (, where R = organic group). They are typically colorless oils or rubber-like substances. Silicones are used in sealants, adhesives, lubricants, medicine, cooking utensils, thermal insulation, and electrical insulation. Some common forms include silicone oil, grease, rubber, resin, and caulk.

Silicone is often confused with one of its constituent elements, silicon, but they are distinct substances. Silicon is a chemical element, a hard dark-grey semiconducting metalloid, which in its crystalline form is used to make integrated circuits (&quot;electronic chips&quot;) and solar cells. Silicones are compounds that contain silicon, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and perhaps other kinds of atoms as well, and have many very different physical and chemical properties.

== History ==

F. S. Kipping coined the word &quot;silicone&quot; in 1901 to describe the formula of polydiphenylsiloxane, (Ph = phenyl, ), by analogy with the formula of the ketone benzophenone, (his term was originally &quot;silicoketone&quot;). Kipping was well aware that polydiphenylsiloxane is polymeric whereas benzophenone is monomeric and noted the contrasting properties of and . The discovery of the structural differences between Kipping&#x27;s molecules and the ketones means that &quot;silicone&quot; is no longer the correct term (though it remains in common usage) and that the term &quot;siloxane&quot; is preferred according to the nomenclature of modern chemistry.

James Franklin Hyde (born 11 March 1903) was an American chemist and inventor. He has been called the &quot;Father of Silicones&quot; and is credited with the launch of the silicone industry in the 1930s. His most notable contributions include his creation of silicone from silicon compounds and his method of making fused silica, a high-quality glass later used in aeronautics, advanced telecommunications, and computer chips. His work led to the formation of Dow Corning, an alliance between the Dow Chemical Company and Corning Glass Works that was specifically created to produce silicone products. 

== Chemistry ==
Alfred Stock and Carl Somiesky examined the hydrolysis of dichlorosilane, a reaction that was proposed to initially give the monomer :
formula_1
When the hydrolysis is performed by treating a solution of in benzene with water, the product was determined to have the approximate formula . Higher polymers were proposed to form with time.

Most polysiloxanes feature organic substituents, e.g., and . All polymerized siloxanes or polysiloxanes, silicones consist of an inorganic silicon–oxygen backbone chain () with two groups attached to each silicon center. The materials can be cyclic or polymeric. By varying the chain lengths, side groups, and crosslinking, silicones can be synthesized with a wide variety of properties and compositions. They can vary in consistency from liquid to gel to rubber to hard plastic. The most common siloxane is linear polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), a silicone oil. The second-largest group of silicone materials is based on silicone resins, which are formed by branched and cage-like oligosiloxanes.

== Synthesis ==
Most common are materials based on polydimethylsiloxane, which is derived by hydrolysis of dimethyldichlorosilane. This dichloride reacts with water as follows:

formula_2

The polymerization typically produces linear chains capped with or (silanol) groups. Under different conditions, the polymer is a cyclic, not a chain.

For consumer applications such as caulks, silyl acetates are used instead of silyl chlorides. The hydrolysis of the acetates produces the less dangerous acetic acid (the acid found in vinegar) as the reaction product of a much slower curing process. This chemistry is used in many consumer applications, such as silicone caulk and adhesives.

formula_3

Branches or crosslinks in the polymer chain can be introduced by using organosilicone precursors with fewer alkyl groups, such as methyl trichlorosilane and methyltrimethoxysilane. Ideally, each molecule of such a compound becomes a branch point. This process can be used to produce hard silicone resins. Similarly, precursors with three methyl groups can be used to limit molecular weight, since each such molecule has only one reactive site and so forms the end of a siloxane chain.

== Combustion ==

When silicone is burned in air or oxygen, it forms solid silica (silicon dioxide, ) as a white powder, char, and various gases. The readily dispersed powder is sometimes called silica fume. The pyrolysis of certain polysiloxanes under an inert atmosphere is a valuable pathway towards the production of amorphous silicon oxycarbide ceramics, also known as polymer derived ceramics. Polysiloxanes terminated with functional ligands such as vinyl, mercapto or acrylate groups have been cross linked to yield preceramic polymers, which can be photopolymerised for the additive manufacturing of polymer derived ceramics by stereolithography techniques.

== Properties ==
Silicones exhibit many useful characteristics, including:

* Low thermal conductivity
* Low chemical reactivity
* Low toxicity
* Thermal stability (constancy of properties over a wide temperature range of )
* The ability to repel water and form watertight seals.
* Does not stick to many substrates, but adheres very well to others, e.g. glass
* Does not support microbiological growth
* Resistance to creasing and wrinkling
* Resistance to oxygen, ozone, and ultraviolet (UV) light. This property has led to the widespread use of silicones in the construction industry (e.g. coatings, fire protection, glazing seals) and the automotive industry (external gaskets, external trim).
* Electrical insulation properties. Because silicone can be formulated to be electrically insulative or conductive, it is suitable for a wide range of electrical applications.
* High gas permeability: at room temperature (25 °C), the permeability of silicone rubber for such gases as oxygen is approximately 400 times that of butyl rubber, making silicone useful for medical applications in which increased aeration is desired. Conversely, silicone rubbers cannot be used where gas-tight seals are necessary such as seals for high-pressure gasses or high vacuum.

Silicone can be developed into rubber sheeting, where it has other properties, such as being FDA compliant. This extends the uses of silicone sheeting to industries that demand hygiene, for example, food and beverage, and pharmaceuticals.

== Applications ==

Silicones are used in many products. &quot;Ullmann&#x27;s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry&quot; lists the following major categories of application: Electrical (e.g. insulation), electronics (e.g., coatings), household (e.g., sealants and cooking utensils), automobile (e.g. gaskets), airplane (e.g., seals), office machines (e.g. keyboard pads), medicine and dentistry (e.g. tooth impression molds), textiles and paper (e.g. coatings). For these applications, an estimated 400,000 tonnes of silicones were produced in 1991. Specific examples, both large and small are presented below.

=== Automotive ===
In the automotive field, silicone grease is typically used as a lubricant for brake components since it is stable at high temperatures, is not water-soluble, and is far less likely than other lubricants to foul. DOT 5 brake fluids are based on liquid silicones.

Automotive spark plug wires are insulated by multiple layers of silicone to prevent sparks from jumping to adjacent wires, causing misfires. Silicone tubing is sometimes used in automotive intake systems (especially for engines with forced induction).

Sheet silicone is used to manufacture gaskets used in automotive engines, transmissions, and other applications.

Automotive body manufacturing plants and paint shops avoid silicones, as trace contamination may cause &quot;fish eyes&quot;, which are small, circular craters which mar a smooth finish.

Additionally, silicone compounds such as silicone rubber are used as coatings and sealants for airbags; the high strength of silicone rubber makes it an optimal adhesive and sealant for high impact airbags. Silicones in combination with thermoplastics provide improvements in scratch and mar resistance and lowered coefficient of friction.

=== Aerospace ===
Silicone is a widely used material in the aerospace industry due to its sealing properties, stability across an extreme temperature range, durability, sound dampening and anti-vibration qualities, and naturally flame retardant properties. Maintaining extreme functionality is paramount for passenger safety in the aerospace industry, so each component on an aircraft requires high-performance materials.

Specially developed aerospace grades of silicone are stable from , these grades can be used in the construction of gaskets for windows and cabin doors. During operation, aircraft go through large temperature fluctuations in a relatively short period of time; from the ambient temperatures when on the ground in hot countries to sub-zero temperatures when flying at high altitude. Silicone rubber can be molded with tight tolerances ensuring gaskets form airtight seals both on the ground and in the air, where atmospheric pressure decreases.

Silicone rubber&#x27;s resistance to heat corrosion enables it to be used for gaskets in aircraft engines where it will outlast other types of rubber, both improving aircraft safety and reducing maintenance costs. The silicone acts to seal instrument panels and other electrical systems in the cockpit, protecting printed circuit boards from the risks of extreme altitude such as moisture and extremely low temperature. Silicone can be used as a sheath to protect wires and electrical components from any dust or ice that may creep into a plane&#x27;s inner workings.

As the nature of air travel results in much noise and vibration, powerful engines, landings, and high speeds all need to be considered to ensure passenger comfort and safe operation of the aircraft. As silicone rubber has exceptional noise reduction and anti-vibration properties, it can be formed into small components and fitted into small gaps ensuring all equipment can be protected from unwanted vibration such as overhead lockers, vent ducts, hatches, entertainment system seals, and LED lighting systems.

=== Solid propellant ===

Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) based binders along with ammonium perchlorate (NH4ClO4) are used as fast burning solid propellants in rockets.

=== Building construction ===

The strength and reliability of silicone rubber are widely acknowledged in the construction industry. One-part silicone sealants and caulks are in common use to seal gaps, joints and crevices in buildings. One-part silicones cure by absorbing atmospheric moisture, which simplifies installation. In plumbing, silicone grease is typically applied to O-rings in brass taps and valves, preventing lime from sticking to the metal.

Structural silicone has also been used in curtain wall building façades since 1974 when the Art Institute of Chicago became the first building to receive exterior glass fixed only with the material. Silicone membranes have been used to cover and restore industrial roofs, thanks to its extreme UV resistance, and ability to keep their waterproof performance for decades.

=== 3D printing ===
Silicone rubber can be 3D printed (liquid deposition modelling, LDM) using pump-nozzle extrusion systems. Standard silicone formulations are optimized to be used by extrusion and injection moulding machines and are not applicable in LDM-based 3D printing. The rheological behavior and the need to be adjusted for use with LDM.

3D printing also requires the use of a removable support material that is compatible with the silicone rubber.

=== Coatings ===

Silicone films can be applied to such silica-based substrates as glass to form a covalently bonded hydrophobic coating. Such coatings were developed for use on aircraft windshields to repel water and to preserve visibility, without requiring mechanical windshield wipers which are impractical at supersonic speeds. Similar treatments were eventually adapted to the automotive market in products marketed by Rain-X and others.

Many fabrics can be coated or impregnated with silicone to form a strong, waterproof composite such as silnylon.

A silicone polymer can be suspended in water by using stabilizing surfactants. This allows water-based formulations to be used to deliver many ingredients that would otherwise require a stronger solvent, or be too viscous to use effectively. For example, a waterborne formulation using a silane&#x27;s reactivity and penetration ability into a mineral-based surface can be combined with water-beading properties from a siloxane to produce a more-useful surface protection product.

=== Cookware ===

As a low-taint, non-toxic material, silicone can be used where contact with food is required. Silicone is becoming an important product in the cookware industry, particularly bakeware and kitchen utensils.
Silicone is used as an insulator in heat-resistant potholders and similar items; however, it is more conductive of heat than similar less dense fiber-based products. Silicone oven gloves are able to withstand temperatures up to , making it possible to reach into boiling water.

Other products include molds for chocolate, ice, cookies, muffins, and various other foods; non-stick bakeware and reusable mats used on baking sheets; steamers, egg boilers or poachers; cookware lids, pot holders, trivets, and kitchen mats.

=== Defoaming ===
Silicones are used as active compounds in defoamers due to their low water solubility and good spreading properties.

=== Dry cleaning ===
Liquid silicone can be used as a dry cleaning solvent, providing an alternative to the traditional chlorine-containing perchloroethylene (perc) solvent. The use of silicones in dry cleaning reduces the environmental effect of a typically high-polluting industry.

=== Electronics ===
Electronic components are sometimes encased in silicone to increase stability against mechanical and electrical shock, radiation and vibration, a process called &quot;potting&quot;. Silicones are used where durability and high performance are demanded of components under extreme environmental conditions, such as in space (satellite technology). They are selected over polyurethane or epoxy encapsulation when a wide operating temperature range is required (−65 to 315 °C). Silicones also have the advantage of little exothermic heat rise during cure, low toxicity, good electrical properties, and high purity.

Silicones are often components of thermal pastes used to improve heat transfer from power-dissipating electronic components to heat sinks.

The use of silicones in electronics is not without problems, however. Silicones are relatively expensive and can be attacked by certain solvents. Silicone easily migrates as either a liquid or vapor onto other components. Silicone contamination of electrical switch contacts can lead to failures by causing an increase in contact resistance, often late in the life of the contact, well after any testing is completed. Use of silicone-based spray products in electronic devices during maintenance or repairs can cause later failures.

=== Firestops ===
Silicone foam has been used in North American buildings in an attempt to firestop openings within the fire-resistance-rated wall and floor assemblies to prevent the spread of flames and smoke from one room to another. When properly installed, silicone-foam firestops can be fabricated for building code compliance. Advantages include flexibility and high dielectric strength. Disadvantages include combustibility (hard to extinguish) and significant smoke development.

Silicone-foam firestops have been the subject of controversy and press attention due to smoke development from pyrolysis of combustible components within the foam, hydrogen gas escape, shrinkage, and cracking. These problems have led to reportable events among licensees (operators of nuclear power plants) of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).

Silicone firestops are also used in aircraft.

=== Jewelry ===

Silicone is a popular alternative to traditional metals (such as silver and gold) with jewelry, specifically rings. Silicone rings are commonly worn in professions where metal rings can lead to injuries, such as electrical conduction and ring avulsions. During the mid-2010&#x27;s, some professional athletes began wearing silicone rings as an alternative during games.

=== Lubricants ===
Silicone greases are used for many purposes, such as bicycle chains, airsoft gun parts, and a wide range of other mechanisms. Typically, a dry-set lubricant is delivered with a solvent carrier to penetrate the mechanism. The solvent then evaporates, leaving a clear film that lubricates but does not attract dirt and grit as much as an oil-based or other traditional &quot;wet&quot; lubricant.

Silicone personal lubricants are also available for use in medical procedures or sexual activity.

=== Medicine and cosmetic surgery ===

Silicone is used in microfluidics, seals, gaskets, shrouds, and other applications requiring high biocompatibility. Additionally, the gel form is used in bandages and dressings, breast implants, testicle implants, pectoral implants, contact lenses, and a variety of other medical uses.

Scar treatment sheets are often made of medical grade silicone due to its durability and biocompatibility. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is often used for this purpose, since its specific crosslinking results in a flexible and soft silicone with high durability and tack. It has also been used as the hydrophobic block of amphiphilic synthetic block copolymers used to form the vesicle membrane of polymersomes.

Illicit cosmetic silicone injections may induce chronic and definitive silicone blood diffusion with dermatologic complications.

Ophthalmology uses many products such as silicone oil used to replace the vitreous humor following vitrectomy, silicone intraocular lenses following cataract extraction, silicone tubes to keep a nasolacrimal passage open following dacryocystorhinostomy, canalicular stents for canalicular stenosis, punctal plugs for punctal occlusion in dry eyes, silicone rubber and bands as an external tamponade in tractional retinal detachment, and anteriorly-located break in rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.

Addition and condensation (e.g. polyvinyl siloxane) silicones find wide application as a dental impression material due to its hydrophobic property and thermal stability.

=== Moldmaking ===
Two-part silicone systems are used as rubber molds to cast resins, foams, rubber, and low-temperature alloys. A silicone mold generally requires little or no mold-release or surface preparation, as most materials do not adhere to silicone. For experimental uses, ordinary one-part silicone can be used to make molds or to mold into shapes. If needed, common vegetable cooking oils or petroleum jelly can be used on mating surfaces as a mold-release agent.

Silicone cooking molds used as bakeware do not require coating with cooking oil; in addition, the flexibility of the rubber allows the baked food to be easily removed from the mold after cooking.

=== Personal care ===
Silicones are ingredients widely used in skincare, color cosmetic and hair care applications. Some silicones, notably the amine functionalized amodimethicones, are excellent hair conditioners, providing improved compatibility, feel, and softness, and lessening frizz. The phenyl dimethicones, in another silicone family, are used in reflection-enhancing and color-correcting hair products, where they increase shine and glossiness (and possibly impart subtle color changes). Phenyltrimethicones, unlike the conditioning amodimethicones, have refractive indices (typically 1.46) close to that of a human hair (1.54). However, if included in the same formulation, amodimethicone and phenyltrimethicone interact and dilute each other, making it difficult to achieve both high shine and excellent conditioning in the same product.

Silicone rubber is commonly used in baby bottle nipples (teats) for its cleanliness, aesthetic appearance, and low extractable content.

Silicones are used in shaving products and personal lubricants.

=== Toys and hobbies ===
Silly Putty and similar materials are composed of silicones dimethyl siloxane, polydimethylsiloxane, and decamethyl cyclopentasiloxane, with other ingredients. This substance is noted for its unusual characteristics, e.g., that it bounces, but breaks when given a sharp blow; it will also flow like a liquid and form a puddle given enough time.

Silicone &quot;rubber bands&quot; are a long-lasting popular replacement refill for real rubber bands in the 2013 fad &quot;rubber band loom&quot; toys at two to four times the price (in 2014). Silicone bands also come in bracelet sizes that can be custom embossed with a name or message. Large silicone bands are also sold as utility tie-downs.

Formerol is a silicone rubber (marketed as Sugru) used as an arts-and-crafts material, as its plasticity allows it to be molded by hand like modeling clay. It hardens at room temperature and it is adhesive to various substances including glass and aluminum.

Oogoo is an inexpensive silicone clay, which can be used as a substitute for Sugru.

In making aquariums, manufacturers now commonly use 100% silicone sealant to join glass plates. Glass joints made with silicone sealant can withstand great pressure, making obsolete the original aquarium construction method of angle-iron and putty. This same silicone is used to make hinges in aquarium lids or for minor repairs. However, not all commercial silicones are safe for aquarium manufacture, nor is silicone used for the manufacture of acrylic aquariums as silicones do not have long-term adhesion to plastics.

=== Special effects ===

Silicone is used in special effects as a material for simulating realistic skin, either for prosthetic makeup, prop body parts, or rubber masks. Platinum silicones are ideal for simulating flesh and skin due to their strength, firmness, and translucency, creating a convincing effect.
Silicone masks have an advantage over latex masks in that because of the material properties, the mask hugs the wearers face and moves in a realistic manner with the wearer&#x27;s facial expressions. Silicone is often used as a hypoallergenic substitute for foam latex prosthetics.

== Marketing ==

The leading global manufacturers of silicone base materials belong to three regional organizations: the European Silicone Center (CES) in Brussels, Belgium; the Silicones Environmental, Health, and Safety Center (SEHSC) in Herndon, Virginia, US; and the Silicone Industry Association of Japan (SIAJ) in Tokyo, Japan. Dow Corning Silicones, Evonik Industries, Momentive Performance Materials, Milliken and Company (SiVance Specialty Silicones), Shin-Etsu Silicones, Wacker Chemie, Bluestar Silicones, JNC Corporation, Wacker Asahikasei Silicone, and Dow Corning Toray represent the collective membership of these organizations. A fourth organization, the Global Silicone Council (GSC) acts as an umbrella structure over the regional organizations. All four are non-profit, having no commercial role; their primary missions are to promote the safety of silicones from a health, safety, and environmental perspective. As the European chemical industry is preparing to implement the Registration, Evaluation, and Authorisation of Chemicals (REACH) legislation, CES is leading the formation of a consortium of silicones, silanes, and siloxanes producers and importers to facilitate data and cost-sharing.

== Safety and environmental considerations ==

Silicone compounds are pervasive in the environment. Particular silicone compounds, cyclic siloxanes D4 and D5, are air and water pollutants and have negative health effects on test animals. They are used in various personal care products. The European Chemicals Agency found that &quot;D4 is a persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) substance and D5 is a very persistent, very bioaccumulative (vPvB) substance&quot;. Other silicones biodegrade readily, a process that is accelerated by a variety of catalysts, including clays. Cyclic silicones have been shown to involve the occurrence of silanols during biodegradation in mammals. The resulting silanediols and silanetriols are capable of inhibiting hydrolytic enzymes such as thermolysin, acetylcholinesterase. However, the doses required for inhibition are by orders of magnitude higher than the ones resulting from the accumulated exposure to consumer products containing cyclomethicone.

At around in an oxygen-containing atmosphere, polydimethylsiloxane releases traces of formaldehyde (but lesser amounts than other common materials such as polyethylene). At this temperature, silicones were found to have lower formaldehyde generation than mineral oil and plastics (less than 3 to 48 μg CH2O/(g·hr) for a high consistency silicone rubber, versus around 400 μg CH2O/(g·hr) for plastics and mineral oil). By , copious amounts of formaldehyde have been found to be produced by all silicones (1,200 to 4,600 μg CH2O/(g·hr)).

Some persons have been found to develop silicone allergies or extreme sensitivity particularly after prolonged exposure to certain types of silicone products such as cosmetics, medical equipment including CPAP masks and implanted medical devices.

== Similar substances ==

Compounds containing silicon–oxygen double bonds, now called silanones, but which could deserve the name &quot;silicone&quot;, have long been identified as intermediates in gas-phase processes such as chemical vapor deposition in microelectronics production, and in the formation of ceramics by combustion. However, they have a strong tendency to polymerize into siloxanes. The first stable silanone was obtained in 2014 by A. Filippou and others.

<text>The Smithsonian Institution ( ), or simply the Smithsonian, is a group of museums, education and research centers, created by the U.S. government &quot;for the increase and diffusion of knowledge&quot;. Founded on August 10, 1846, it operates as a trust instrumentality and is not formally a part of any of the three branches of the federal government. The institution is named after its founding donor, British scientist James Smithson. It was originally organized as the United States National Museum, but that name ceased to exist administratively in 1967.

The Smithsonian Institution has historical holdings of over 157 million items, 21 museums, 21 libraries, 14 education and research centers, a zoo, and historical and architectural landmarks, mostly located in Washington, D.C. Additional facilities are located in Maryland, New York, and Virginia. More than 200 institutions and museums in 47 states, Puerto Rico, and Panama are Smithsonian Affiliates. Institution publications include &quot;Smithsonian&quot; and &quot;Air &amp; Space&quot; magazines.

Almost all of the institution&#x27;s 30 million annual visitors are admitted without charge, the exception being Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum in New York City, which charges an admissions fee. The Smithsonian&#x27;s annual budget is around $1.25 billion, with two-thirds coming from annual federal appropriations. Other funding comes from the institution&#x27;s endowment, private and corporate contributions, membership dues, and earned retail, concession, and licensing revenue. the institution&#x27;s endowment had a total value of about $5.4 billion.

==Founding ==

In many ways, the origin of the Smithsonian Institution can be traced to a group of Washington citizens who, being &quot;impressed with the importance of forming an association for promoting useful knowledge,&quot; met on June 28, 1816, to establish the Columbian Institute for the Promotion of Arts and Sciences. Officers were elected in October 1816, and the organization was granted a charter by Congress on April 20, 1818 (this charter expired in 1838). Benjamin Latrobe, who was architect for the US Capitol after the War of 1812, and William Thornton, the architect who designed the Octagon House and Tudor Place, would serve as officers. Other prominent members, who numbered from 30 to 70 during the institute&#x27;s existence, included John Quincy Adams, Andrew Jackson, Henry Clay, Judge William Cranch, and James Hoban. Honorary members included James Madison, James Monroe, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and the Marquis de Lafayette. Operating expenses were covered from the $5 yearly dues collected from each member.

The institute proposed a number of undertakings. These included the study of plant life and the creation of a botanical garden on the National Mall, an examination of the country&#x27;s mineral production, improvement in the management and care of livestock, and the writing of a topographical and statistical history of the United States. Reports were to be published periodically to share this knowledge with the greater public, but due to a lack of funds, this initially did not occur. The institute first met in Blodget&#x27;s Hotel, later in the Treasury Department and City Hall, before being assigned a permanent home in 1824 in the Capitol building.

Beginning in 1825, weekly sittings were arranged during sessions of Congress for the reading of scientific and literary productions, but this was continued for only a short time, as the number attending declined rapidly. Eighty-five communications by 26 people were made to Congress during the entire life of the society, with more than a half relating to astronomy or mathematics. Among all the activities planned by the institute, only a few were actually implemented. Two were the establishment of a botanical garden, and a museum that was designed to have a national and permanent status. The former occupied space where the present Botanic Garden sits.

The museum contained specimens of zoology, botany, archeology, fossils, etc., some of which were passed on to the Smithsonian Institution after its formation. The institute&#x27;s charter expired in 1838, but its spirit lived on in the National Institution, founded in 1840. With the mission to &quot;promote science and the useful arts, and to establish a national museum of natural history,&quot; this organization continued to press Congress to establish a museum that would be structured in terms that were very similar to those finally incorporated into the founding of the Smithsonian Institution. Its work helped to develop an underlying philosophy that pushed for the pursuit and development of scientific knowledge that would benefit the nation, and edify its citizens at the same time.

The British scientist James Smithson (1765–1829) left most of his wealth to his nephew Henry James Hungerford. When Hungerford died childless in 1835, the estate passed &quot;to the United States of America, to found at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an Establishment for the increase &amp; diffusion of knowledge among men&quot;, in accordance with Smithson&#x27;s will. Congress officially accepted the legacy bequeathed to the nation and pledged the faith of the United States to the charitable trust on July 1, 1836. The American diplomat Richard Rush was dispatched to England by President Andrew Jackson to collect the bequest. Rush returned in August 1838 with 105 sacks containing 104,960 gold sovereigns. This is approximately $500,000 at the time, which is or . However, when considering the GDP at the time it may be more comparable to $220 million in the year 2007.

Once the money was in hand, eight years of congressional haggling ensued over how to interpret Smithson&#x27;s rather vague mandate &quot;for the increase and diffusion of knowledge.&quot; The money was invested by the US Treasury in bonds issued by the state of Arkansas, which soon defaulted. After heated debate, Massachusetts representative (and former president) John Quincy Adams persuaded Congress to restore the lost funds with interest and, despite designs on the money for other purposes, convinced his colleagues to preserve it for an institution of science and learning. Finally, on August 10, 1846, President James K. Polk signed the legislation that established the Smithsonian Institution as a trust instrumentality of the United States, to be administered by a Board of Regents and a secretary of the Smithsonian.

==Development==
Though the Smithsonian&#x27;s first secretary, Joseph Henry, wanted the institution to be a center for scientific research, it also became the depository for various Washington and U.S. government collections. The United States Exploring Expedition by the U.S. Navy circumnavigated the globe between 1838 and 1842. The voyage amassed thousands of animal specimens, an herbarium of 50,000 plant specimens, and diverse shells and minerals, tropical birds, jars of seawater, and ethnographic artifacts from the South Pacific Ocean. These specimens and artifacts became part of the Smithsonian collections, as did those collected by several military and civilian surveys of the American West, including the Mexican Boundary Survey and Pacific Railroad Surveys, which assembled many Native American artifacts and natural history specimens.

In 1846, the regents developed a plan for weather observation; in 1847, money was appropriated for meteorological research. The institution became a magnet for young scientists from 1857 to 1866, who formed a group called the Megatherium Club. The Smithsonian played a critical role as the US partner institution in early bilateral scientific exchanges with the Academy of Sciences of Cuba.

===Museums and buildings===
Construction began on the Smithsonian Institution Building (&quot;the Castle&quot;) in 1849. Designed by architect James Renwick Jr., its interiors were completed by general contractor Gilbert Cameron. The building opened in 1855.

The Smithsonian&#x27;s first expansion came with the construction of the Arts and Industries Building in 1881. Congress had promised to build a new structure for the museum if the 1876 Philadelphia Centennial Exposition generated enough income. It did, and the building was designed by architects Adolf Cluss and Paul Schulze, based on original plans developed by Major General Montgomery C. Meigs of the United States Army Corps of Engineers. It opened in 1881.

The National Zoological Park opened in 1889 to accommodate the Smithsonian&#x27;s Department of Living Animals. The park was designed by landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted.

The National Museum of Natural History opened in June 1911 to similarly accommodate the Smithsonian&#x27;s United States National Museum, which had previously been housed in the Castle and then the Arts and Industries Building. This structure was designed by the D.C. architectural firm of Hornblower &amp; Marshall.

When Detroit philanthropist Charles Lang Freer donated his private collection to the Smithsonian and funds to build the museum to hold it (which was named the Freer Gallery), it was among the Smithsonian&#x27;s first major donations from a private individual. The gallery opened in 1923.

More than 40 years would pass before the next museum, the Museum of History and Technology (renamed the National Museum of American History in 1980), opened in 1964. It was designed by the world-renowned firm of McKim, Mead &amp; White. The Anacostia Community Museum, an &quot;experimental store-front&quot; museum created at the initiative of Smithsonian Secretary S. Dillon Ripley, opened in the Anacostia neighborhood of Washington, D.C., in 1967. That same year, the Smithsonian signed an agreement to take over the Cooper Union Museum for the Arts of Decoration (now the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum). The National Portrait Gallery and the Smithsonian American Art Museum opened in the Old Patent Office Building (built in 1867) on October 7, 1968. The reuse of an older building continued with the opening of the Renwick Gallery in 1972 in the 1874 Renwick-designed art gallery originally built by local philanthropist William Wilson Corcoran to house the Corcoran Gallery of Art.

The first new museum building to open since the National Museum of History and Technology was the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, which opened in 1974. The National Air and Space Museum, the Smithsonian&#x27;s largest in terms of floor space, opened in June 1976.

Eleven years later, the National Museum of African Art and the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery opened in a new, joint, underground museum between the Freer Gallery and the Smithsonian Castle. Reuse of another old building came in 1993 with the opening of the National Postal Museum in the 1904 former City Post Office building, a few city blocks from the Mall.

In 2004, the Smithsonian opened the National Museum of the American Indian in a new building near the United States Capitol. Twelve years later almost to the day, in 2016, the latest museum opened: the National Museum of African American History and Culture, in a new building near the Washington Monument.

Two more museums have been established and are being planned for eventual construction on the Mall: the National Museum of the American Latino and the Smithsonian American Women&#x27;s History Museum.

===Capital campaigns===
In 2011, the Smithsonian undertook its first-ever capital fundraising campaign. The $1.5 billion effort raised $1 billion at the three-year mark. Smithsonian officials made the campaign public in October 2014 in an effort to raise the remaining $500 million. More than 60,000 individuals and organizations donated money to the campaign by the time it went public. This included 192 gifts of at least $1 million. Members of the boards of directors of various Smithsonian museums donated $372 million. The Smithsonian said that funds raised would go toward completion of the National Museum of African American History and Culture building, and renovations of the National Air and Space Museum, National Museum of American History, and the Renwick Gallery. A smaller amount of funds would go to educational initiatives and digitization of collections. As of September 2017, the Smithsonian claimed to have raised $1.79 billion, with three months left in the formal campaign calendar.

Separately from the major capital campaign, the Smithsonian has begun fundraising through Kickstarter. An example is a campaign to fund the preservation and maintenance of the ruby slippers worn by Judy Garland for her role as Dorothy Gale in the 1939 film &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;.

==Museums==
Nineteen museums and galleries, as well as the National Zoological Park, comprise the Smithsonian museums. Eleven are on the National Mall, the park that runs between the Lincoln Memorial and the United States Capitol. Other museums are located elsewhere in Washington, D.C., with two more in New York City and one in Chantilly, Virginia.

The Smithsonian has close ties with 168 other museums in 39 states, Panama, and Puerto Rico. These museums are known as Smithsonian Affiliated museums. Collections of artifacts are given to these museums in the form of long-term loans. The Smithsonian also has a large number of traveling exhibitions, operated through the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service (SITES). In 2008, 58 of these traveling exhibitions went to 510 venues across the country.

===Collections===

Smithsonian collections include 156 million artworks, artifacts, and specimens. The National Museum of Natural History houses 145 million of these specimens and artifacts, which are mostly animals preserved in formaldehyde. The Collections Search Center has 9.9 million digital records available online. The Smithsonian Institution Libraries hold 2 million library volumes. Smithsonian Archives hold of archival material.

The Smithsonian Institution has many categories of displays that can be visited at the museums. In 1912, First Lady Helen Herron Taft donated her inauguration gown to the museum to begin the First Ladies&#x27; Gown display at the National Museum of American History, one of the Smithsonian&#x27;s most popular exhibits. The museum displays treasures such as the Star-Spangled Banner, the stove pipe hat that was worn by President Abraham Lincoln, the ruby slippers worn by Judy Garland in &quot;The Wizard Of Oz&quot;, and the original Teddy Bear that was named after President Theodore Roosevelt. In 2016, the Smithsonian&#x27;s Air &amp; Space museum curators restored the large model &quot;Enterprise&quot; from the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; TV series.

Following international debates about the decolonisation of museums and the legal and moral justifications of their acquisitions, the Smithsonian adopted a new &quot;ethical returns policy&quot; on April 29, 2022. This will permit the deaccession and restitution of items collected under circumstances considered unethical by contemporary standards and thus places moral over legal arguments. A month before, the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Museum of African Art had announced the planned return of most of its 39 Benin Bronzes to Nigeria, as well as of other cultural items to Turkey.

On October 11, 2022, Benin Bronzes from the National Museum of African Art, as well as the National Gallery of Art, were formally returned to Nigerian cultural officials in a ceremony held in Washington D.C. The Nigerian Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, and Prince Aghatise Erediauwa, representing the Oba of Benin Kingdom, spoke at the ceremony. Mohammed said the &quot;decision to return the timeless artworks is worth emulating.&quot;

===Open access===
In February 2020, the Smithsonian made 2.8 million digital items available to the public under a Creative Commons Zero Public Domain Dedication, with a commitment to release further items in the future.

==Research Centers==
The Smithsonian has eight research centers, located in Washington, D.C.; Front Royal, Virginia; Edgewater, Maryland; Suitland, Maryland; Fort Pierce, Florida; Cambridge, Massachusetts; and Panama. Formerly two separate entities, the Smithsonian Libraries and Smithsonian Archives merged into one research center in 2020.

==Cultural Centers==

The Smithsonian Institution includes three cultural centers among its units:

* Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage
* Smithsonian Asian Pacific American Center
* Smithsonian Latino Center

===Smithsonian Latino Center===
In 1997, the Smithsonian Latino Center was created as a way to recognize Latinos across the Smithsonian Institution. The primary purpose of the center is to place Latino contributions to the arts, history, science, and national culture across the Smithsonian&#x27;s museums and research centers.

The center is a division of the Smithsonian Institution. As of May 2016, the center is run by an executive director, Eduardo Díaz.

====History====
At the time of its creation, the Smithsonian Institution had other entities dedicated to other minority groups: National Museum of the American Indian, Freer-Sackler Gallery for Asian Arts and Culture, African Art Museum, and the National Museum of African-American Heritage and Culture.

The opening of the center was prompted, in part, by the publishing of a report called &quot;Willful Neglect: The Smithsonian and U.S. Latinos&quot;.

According to documents obtained by &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, when former Latino Center executive director Pilar O&#x27;Leary first took the job, the center faced employees who had &quot;serious performance issues&quot;. No performance plans existed for the staff and unfulfilled financial obligations to sponsors existed. The website&#x27;s quality was poor, and the center did not have a public affairs manager, a programs director, adequate human resources support, or cohesive mission statement.

After difficult times in the first few years, the center improved. According to the Smithsonian, the center &quot;support[s] scholarly research, exhibitions, public and educational programs, web-based content and virtual platforms, and collections and archives. [It] also manage[s] leadership and professional development programs for Latino youth, emerging scholars and museum professionals.&quot; Today, the website features a high-tech virtual museum including self-guided virtual tours of past and present exhibits.

====Young Ambassadors Program====
The Smithsonian Latino Center&#x27;s Young Ambassadors Program (YAP) is a program within the Latino Center that reaches out to Latino high school students with the goal of encouraging them to become leaders in arts, sciences, and the humanities.

Students selected for the program travel to Washington, D.C. for an &quot;enrichment seminar&quot; that lasts approximately five days. Afterwards, students return to their communities to serve in a paid, one-month internship.

Pilar O&#x27;Leary launched the program when she served as executive director of the Smithsonian Latino Center. According to the Latino Center, O&#x27;Leary told the press in 2007: &quot;Our goal is to help our Young Ambassadors become the next generation of leaders in the arts and culture fields. This program encourages students to be proud of their roots and learn more about their cultural heritage to inspire them to educate the public in their own communities about how Latinos are enriching America&#x27;s cultural fabric.&quot;

==Publications==
The institution publishes &quot;Smithsonian&quot; magazine monthly and &quot;Air &amp; Space&quot; magazine bimonthly. &quot;Smithsonian&quot; was the result of Secretary of the Smithsonian S. Dillon Ripley asking the retired editor of &quot;Life&quot; magazine Edward K. Thompson to produce a magazine &quot;about things in which the Smithsonian Institution is interested, might be interested or ought to be interested&quot;. Another Secretary of the Smithsonian, Walter Boyne, founded &quot;Air &amp; Space&quot;.

The organization publishes under the imprints Smithsonian Institution Press, Smithsonian Books, and Smithsonian Institution Scholarly Press.

==Awards==
The Smithsonian makes a number of awards to acknowledge and support meritorious work. 
* The James Smithson Medal, the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s highest award, was established in 1965 and is given in recognition of exceptional contributions to art, science, history, education, and technology. 
* The James Smithson Bicentennial Medal, established in 1965, is given to persons who have made distinguished contributions to the advancement of areas of interest to the Smithsonian. 
* The Hodgkins Medal, established in 1893, is awarded for important contributions to the understanding of the physical environment. 
* The Henry Medal, established in 1878, is presented to individuals in recognition of their distinguished service, achievements or contributions to the prestige and growth of the Smithsonian Institution. 
* The Langley Gold Medal is awarded for meritorious investigations in connection with aerodromics (&quot;the science or art of flying aircraft&quot;, a 19th century term predating the powered airplane) and its application to aviation.

==Administration==

The Smithsonian Institution was established as a trust instrumentality by act of Congress. More than two-thirds of the Smithsonian&#x27;s workforce of some 6,300 persons are employees of the federal government. The Smithsonian Institution Office of Protection Services oversees security at the Smithsonian facilities and enforces laws and regulations for National Capital Parks together with the United States Park Police.

The president&#x27;s 2011 budget proposed just under $800 million in support for the Smithsonian, slightly increased from previous years. Institution exhibits are free of charge, though in 2010 the Deficit Commission recommended admission fees.

As approved by Congress on August 10, 1846, the legislation that created the Smithsonian Institution called for the creation of a Board of Regents to govern and administer the organization. This seventeen-member board meets at least four times a year and includes as &quot;ex officio&quot; members the chief justice of the United States and the vice president of the United States. The nominal head of the institution is the chancellor, an office which has traditionally been held by the chief justice. In September 2007, the board created the position of chair of the Board of Regents, a position currently held by Risa Lavizzo-Mourey.

Other members of the Board of Regents are three members of the U.S. House of Representatives appointed by the speaker of the House; three members of the Senate, appointed by the president &quot;pro tempore&quot; of the Senate; and nine citizen members, nominated by the board and approved by the Congress in a joint resolution signed by the president of the United States. Regents who are senators or representatives serve for the duration of their elected terms, while citizen Regents serve a maximum of two six-year terms. Regents are compensated on a part-time basis.

The chief executive officer (CEO) of the Smithsonian is the secretary, who is appointed by the Board of Regents. The secretary also serves as secretary to the Board of Regents but is not a voting member of that body. The secretary of the Smithsonian has the privilege of the floor at the United States Senate. On September 18, 2013, Secretary G. Wayne Clough announced he would retire in October 2014. The Smithsonian Board of Regents said it asked regent John McCarter, Jr., to lead a search committee. On March 10, 2014, the Smithsonian Board selected David Skorton, a physician and president of Cornell University, as the thirteenth secretary of the Smithsonian. Skorton took the reins of the institution on July 1, 2015. Upon Skorton&#x27;s announced resignation in 2019, the Board selected Lonnie Bunch III, the founding director of the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Museum of African American History and Culture, as the fourteenth secretary.

==Controversies==

===&quot;Enola Gay&quot; display===
In 1995, controversy arose over the exhibit at the National Air and Space Museum with the display of the &quot;Enola Gay&quot;, the Superfortress used by the United States to drop the first atomic bomb used in World War II. The American Legion and Air Force Association believed the exhibit put forward only one side of the debate over the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and that it emphasized the effect on victims without discussing its use within the overall context of the war. The Smithsonian changed the exhibit, displaying the aircraft only with associated technical data and without discussion of its historic role in the war.

===Censorship of &quot;Seasons of Life and Land&quot;===
In 2003, a National Museum of Natural History exhibit, Subhankar Banerjee&#x27;s &quot;Seasons of Life and Land&quot;, featuring photographs of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, was censored and moved to the basement by Smithsonian officials. They were concerned that its subject matter was too politically controversial.

In November 2007, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported internal criticism has been raised regarding the institution&#x27;s handling of the exhibit on the Arctic. According to documents and e-mails, the exhibit and its associated presentation were edited at high levels to add &quot;scientific uncertainty&quot; regarding the nature and impact of global warming on the Arctic. Acting Secretary of the Smithsonian Cristián Samper was interviewed by the &quot;Post&quot;, and claimed the exhibit was edited because it contained conclusions that went beyond what could be proven by contemporary climatology. The Smithsonian is now a participant in the U.S. Global Change Research Program.

===Copyright restrictions===
The Smithsonian Institution provides access to its image collections for educational, scholarly, and nonprofit uses. Commercial uses are generally restricted unless permission is obtained. Smithsonian images fall into different copyright categories; some are protected by copyright, many are subject to license agreements or other contractual conditions, and some fall into the public domain, such as those prepared by Smithsonian employees as part of their official duties. The Smithsonian&#x27;s terms of use for its digital content, including images, are set forth on the Smithsonian Web site.

In April 2006, the institution entered into an agreement of &quot;first refusal&quot; rights for its vast silent and public domain film archives with Showtime Networks, mainly for use on the Smithsonian Channel, a network created from this deal. Critics contend this agreement effectively gives Showtime control over the film archives, as it requires filmmakers to obtain permission from the network to use extensive amounts of film footage from the Smithsonian archives.

<doc id="65832" wikidata="Q1754034" url="?curid=65832" title="Soviet submarine K-222">
<text>K-222 was the sole [[Project Number (Russian Navy classification)|Project]] 661 &quot;Anchar&quot; (Cyrillic: ) (NATO reporting name: Papa class) nuclear-powered cruise-missile submarine of the Soviet Navy during the Cold War. Although the Soviets saw &quot;K-222&quot; as an unsuccessful design, upon completion it was the world&#x27;s fastest submarine and the first to be built with a titanium hull. 

The submarine was given several names over the course of its construction and service: she was originally designated &quot;K-18&quot;, named K-162 while under construction, and renamed to &quot;K-222&quot; in 1978.

The Soviet government and Navy was dissatisfied with the Echo class of nuclear submarines, which had to surface to fire their missiles. In 1958 construction was authorized for an exceedingly ambitious program; the requirements called for a very fast boat equipped with missiles that could be launched while submerged. It accepted the preliminary design two years later and construction began in 1963; work proceeded very slowly as techniques for working titanium had to be developed and quality control was inconsistent. The program&#x27;s objectives were generally satisfied, but the government had failed to include a requirement to minimize the submarine&#x27;s acoustic signature which meant that &quot;K-222&quot; was easily detectable at high speed. The Soviet Navy rejected a plan to place the design into series production as its flaws outweighed its advantages, but it pioneered the technology needed to work with titanium on a large scale, which enabled the subsequent construction of more successful designs using titanium, such as Projects 705 &quot;Lira&quot;, 945 &quot;Barrakuda&quot;, and 945A &quot;Kondor&quot;.

Commissioned in 1969, the-then &quot;K-162&quot; was armed with 10 short-range, anti-ship cruise missiles and four torpedo tubes to carry out her mission of destroying American aircraft carriers. These missiles could be fitted with either conventional or nuclear warheads. The submarine served in the Soviet Red Banner Northern Fleet through the 1970s, but the discovery of hull cracks led to a lengthy repair period from 1972 to 1975. After an accident with &quot;K-222&quot;&#x27;s nuclear reactor in 1980, the submarine went on her final operational patrol in 1981. She was removed from service in 1988 and scrapped in 2010.

==Background==
The Soviets were well aware of the drawbacks of the large SS-N-3 Shaddock family of missiles, notably its need to be launched from the surface and its complicated target-acquisition process, both of which rendered the submarines launching the missiles vulnerable to the carriers that they were intended to attack. The Council of Ministers issued a resolution on 28 August 1958 calling for a very ambitious submarine development program that called for a doubling of speed, a 50 percent increase in diving depth, smaller nuclear reactors and steam turbines, and a long-range missile system of small dimensions able to be fired while submerged, and new materials, among other objectives. Design bureau TsKB-16 began development of Project 661, an experimental cruise-missile submarine, later that year in response to the resolution. Chief designer N. N. Isanin decided to begin a clean-slate design that would use existing technology as little as possible. By July 1959 a sketch design was ready for a submarine capable of and the State Committee for Shipbuilding had to make decisions about what the submarine&#x27;s hull would be constructed of and what type of nuclear reactor would be used.

Aluminium was quickly rejected as unsuitable because of its poor resistance to corrosion and poor performance under high pressure at high speeds. While new alloys of steel were still under development, titanium had some major advantages. It was much stronger than steel for a given weight, resisted corrosion better and was non-magnetic. This would help protect it against magnetic mines and registering on magnetic anomaly detectors of anti-submarine aircraft. Disregarding the extremely high cost of titanium compared to steel and that titanium could not be welded in an oxygen atmosphere, the committee selected it. Two types of reactor were potentially available at this time, pressurized water or lead-bismuth eutectic. The Soviets had some experience with the former, but none with the latter; this proved to be the deciding factor as the committee was unwilling to wait for the lead-bismuth reactor to be developed even though it promised to be smaller for the same amount of power output. &quot;K-222&quot; would be the first submarine built with a titanium hull.

These decisions produced a design that had an underwater speed of 38 knots and was capable of carrying 10–12 missile launchers forward of the sail, but was larger than the specified displacement if fitted with two propeller shafts. The committee considered using a single shaft, but ultimately rejected it, preferring the redundancy of two reactors. It did delete the auxiliary diesel generator that earlier nuclear-powered submarines had been equipped with to compensate for using two shafts when it accepted the sketch design and authorized preliminary design work in February 1960. The final design was approved three months later. To reduce the technical risk of many of the advanced components chosen, the navy modified five existing submarines to test various systems such as the P-70 &quot;Ametist&quot; (NATO reporting name: SS-N-7 Starbright), GRAU designation: 4K66; &#x27;Amethyst&#x27;) missiles, sonars and other electronics.

==Description==
&quot;K-222&quot; was a double-hulled design that displaced on the surface and submerged. The boat had an overall length of , a beam of and a draft of . The submarine&#x27;s inner hull had nine watertight compartments and had an unusual configuration at the bow where the first two compartments were narrower than the rest of the hull and were superimposed in a figure 8 shape; the upper compartment housed the torpedo tubes while the lower contained the massive sonar system and some of the batteries. The third compartment was as narrow as the first two () while the rest of the compartments widened to a diameter of . &quot;K-222&quot; had a test depth of and a design depth of . The crew numbered 82 officers and enlisted men.

The submarine was powered by a pair of VM-5M reactors, each supplying steam for the GTZA-618 steam turbine driving each propeller shaft. The turbines produced a total of that was intended to propel &quot;K-222&quot; at a speed of 38 knots. The boat was equipped with two turbogenerators; two banks of 152-cell silver-zinc batteries were fitted in lieu of a diesel generator. The boat made on the surface, and proved to be much faster than planned underwater and reached a top speed of at 90 percent power during her sea trials in December 1969. During this 12-hour full-speed test, some of the external hull fittings were ripped off and portions of the grills protecting the water intakes broke loose and were ground up by the water-circulation pumps. One account of the trial wrote:
the biggest thing was the noise of the water going by. It increased together with the ship&#x27;s speed, and when was exceeded, it was like the noise of a jet aircraft. ... In the control room was not heard simply the roar of an aircraft, but the thunder of &quot;the engine room of a diesel locomotive&quot;. Those present believed that the noise level was greater than 100 decibels.

On a subsequent trial in 1970 at full power, &quot;K-222&quot; reached , the fastest speed attained underwater by a manned object and making &quot;K-222&quot; the world&#x27;s fastest submarine. The submarine carried enough supplies to stay at sea for 70 days.

===Armament, sensors and fire control===
The submarine&#x27;s primary armament consisted of 10 P-70 missiles in individual tubes between the inner and outer hulls forward of sail. The tubes were positioned upwards at an angle of 32.5 degrees. As the missile used four solid-propellant boosters, it could be launched underwater at a maximum depth of . No more than five missiles could be fired in one volley and the second volley could be fired three minutes later. The narrowness of the bow compartment prevented &quot;K-222&quot; from being fitted with more than four torpedo tubes, although she stowed eight reloads for them. The torpedoes could be fired down to a depth of .

The massive cylindrical Rubin MGK-300 sonar system occupied the nose of the lower inner hull and measured in diameter and in height. It was fitted with both active and passive transducers and was intended to detect carrier battle groups at long ranges. It would transmit the data to the missiles for its initial targeting. Locating targets accurately was initially limited to about with the missiles requiring a mid-course update if attacking targets further away. Later upgrades to the sonar allowed it to extend its range to the full limit of the P-70 missiles. Once fired, the submarine did not have to provide any further targeting data as the missile was equipped with a radar of its own. &quot;K-222&quot; was also fitted with an Albatros RLK-101 search radar (NATO reporting name: Snoop Tray) and a Molniya (NATO reporting name: Pert Spring) satellite-communications system.

==Construction and career==

As large-scale fabrication of titanium was unknown anywhere in the world, techniques and equipment had to be developed from scratch by the Soviets at great cost. The Sevmash shipyard had to invest in new equipment capable of shaping plates up to thick and retrain its workers to weld in an argon atmosphere and a cleanroom environment to prevent contamination of the welds. As part of that process two half-scale sections were constructed, one for testing in a pressure chamber and the other to evaluate shock resistance in Lake Ladoga. The collapse of the section under hydraulic pressure and the presence of cracks in the welds of both structures revealed that the welders at the Severodvinsk shipyard failed to follow the strict cool down time requirements. Further consultations with metallurgical experts reached the conclusion that the steel tools used to fabricate the sections were not suitable for use with titanium.

The first titanium plates were delivered in late 1961 which allowed the submarine (initially designated as &quot;K-18&quot; and then renamed to &quot;K-162&quot; on 27 January 1965) to be laid down on 28 December 1963. Construction of the submarine was delayed by the delivery of plates for the outer hull by the Kommunar Metallurgical Plant that were contaminated by hydrogen and cracked easily. About 20 percent of the plates for the outer hull had to be replaced which contributed to the lengthy period that the submarine remained on the slipway before being launched on 21 December 1968. Shortly afterwards, testing of the submarine revealed that 10 ballast tanks were not watertight despite careful examination and that non-titanium components were not properly isolated from the titanium hull, causing corrosion. Within the Soviet Navy, &quot;K-162&quot; was commonly referred to as the &quot;Golden Fish&quot;, in reference to her development and construction costs. 

Commissioned on 13 December 1969 and assigned to the Soviet Red Banner Northern Fleet, the boat spent most of the next two years conducting sea trials. &quot;K-162&quot; made her first operational patrol in the North Atlantic in September–December 1971. During this patrol, the submarine trailed an American battle group centered around the carrier at high speed as it returned to the United States from the Mediterranean. During a lengthy refit that lasted from October 1972 to January 1975, the shipyard discovered a large number of cracks that required repair. Three years later, &quot;K-162&quot; was renamed &quot;K-222&quot;.

During this time, the Soviets assessed the possibility of series production of more boats of the class and concluded that the design would have to be modified with longer-range missiles and more torpedoes to improve its combat worthiness. In addition the excessive noise at high speed eliminated the sonar system&#x27;s ability to acquire targets and needed to be remedied. Coupled with the submarine&#x27;s high cost, lengthy building time, and the limited resources available, the navy decided not to proceed with any more boats. Thus the design studies for derivatives like the improved Project 661M, the Project 661A armed with P-120 Malakhit (NATO designation: SS-N-9 Siren) missiles and the Project 661B armed with R-29 Vysota (NATO codename: SS-N-8 Sawfly) ballistic missiles were cancelled. Although &quot;K-222&quot; was not regarded as a successful design, the technology developed for the build enabled the Soviet Union to construct the titanium-hulled and attack submarines.

While having her reactor refueled in November 1980, &quot;K-222&quot;″s crew lost the unique tools required to handle the nuclear fuel rods and the Severodvinsk facility had to refuel the boat without them. During the procedure, the entire crew decided to go to lunch ashore on 30 November, violating naval regulations as only shipyard workers remained aboard. This became a problem because the automatic safety system for the control rods had been shut down and they started to lift, causing the reactor to generate more heat without any water flowing to cool the core of the reactor. No one was monitoring the core&#x27;s temperature and the workers only realized that there was a problem when an alarm sounded after a condenser ruptured and radioactive steam and water entered the machinery compartment. They were able to prevent the steam from spreading and turned on the main pumps to get water cooling the core. The commission investigating the incident recommended that the reactors be replaced by more modern ones and that an emergency diesel generator be installed, but the recommendations were rejected and the navy decided to simply repair the damage. After the repairs and decontamination, &quot;K-222&quot; made her last operational patrol in 1981. 

In 1988, the boat was placed in reserve at the naval base in Belomorsk, not far from Severodvinsk. Having lost the tools to handle the fuel rods, the navy could not find a company or organization willing or able to defuel the submarine. By 2008 cracks started appearing in the hull and the ballast tanks started taking on water. In March 2010 Sevmash began scrapping &quot;K-222&quot; with the reactors and nuclear fuel still on board, and this was completed by 4 June.

<text>Schindler&#x27;s List is a 1993 American epic historical drama film directed and produced by Steven Spielberg, and written by Steven Zaillian. It is based on the historical novel &quot;Schindler&#x27;s Ark&quot; (1982) by Thomas Keneally. The film follows Oskar Schindler, a German industrialist who saved more than a thousand mostly Polish–Jewish refugees from the Holocaust by employing them in his factories during World War II. It stars Liam Neeson as Schindler, Ralph Fiennes as SS officer Amon Göth, and Ben Kingsley as Schindler&#x27;s Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern.

Ideas for a film about the &quot;Schindlerjuden&quot; (Schindler Jews) were proposed as early as 1963. Poldek Pfefferberg, one of the &quot;Schindlerjuden&quot;, made it his life&#x27;s mission to tell Schindler&#x27;s story. Spielberg became interested when executive Sidney Sheinberg sent him a book review of &quot;Schindler&#x27;s Ark&quot;. Universal Pictures bought the rights to the novel, but Spielberg, unsure if he was ready to make a film about the Holocaust, tried to pass the project to several directors before deciding to direct it himself.

Principal photography took place in Kraków, Poland, over 72 days in 1993. Spielberg shot in black and white and approached the film as a documentary. Cinematographer Janusz Kamiński wanted to create a sense of timelessness. John Williams composed the score, and violinist Itzhak Perlman performed the main theme.

&quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; premiered on November 30, 1993, in Washington, D.C., and was released on December 15, 1993, in the United States. Often listed as one of the greatest films ever made, the film received widespread acclaim for its tone, acting, atmosphere, score, cinematography, and Spielberg&#x27;s direction; it was also a box office success, earning $322.2 million worldwide on a $22 million budget. It was nominated for twelve awards at the 66th Academy Awards, and won seven, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay. The film won numerous other awards, including seven BAFTAs and three Golden Globes. In 2007, the American Film Institute ranked &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; 8th on its list of the 100 greatest American films. The film was deemed &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot; by the Library of Congress in 2004 and selected for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry.

== Plot ==
In German-occupied Kraków during World War II, the Nazis force local Polish Jews into the overcrowded Kraków Ghetto. Oskar Schindler, a German Nazi Party member from Czechoslovakia, arrives in the city, hoping to make his fortune. He bribes Wehrmacht (German armed forces) and SS officials, acquiring a factory to produce enamelware. Schindler hires Itzhak Stern, a Jewish official with contacts among black marketeers and the Jewish business community; he handles administration and helps Schindler arrange financing. Stern ensures that as many Jewish workers as possible were deemed essential to the German war effort to prevent them from being taken by the SS to concentration camps or killed. Meanwhile, Schindler maintains friendly relations with the Nazis and enjoys his new wealth and status as an industrialist.

SS-&quot;Untersturmführer&quot; (second lieutenant) Amon Göth arrives in Kraków to oversee construction of the Płaszów concentration camp. When the camp is ready, he orders the ghetto liquidated: two thousand Jews are transported to Płaszów, and two thousand others are killed in the streets by the SS. Schindler witnesses the massacre and is profoundly affected. He particularly notices a young girl in a red coat who hides from the Nazis and later sees her body on a wagonload of corpses. Schindler is careful to maintain his friendship with Göth and continues to enjoy SS support, mostly through bribery. Göth brutalizes his Jewish maid, Helen Hirsch, and randomly shoots people from the balcony of his villa; the prisoners are in constant fear for their lives. As time passes, Schindler&#x27;s focus shifts from making money to trying to save as many lives as possible. To better protect his workers, Schindler bribes Göth into allowing him to build a sub-camp at his factory.

As the Germans begin losing the war, Göth is ordered to ship the remaining Jews at Płaszów to Auschwitz concentration camp. Schindler asks Göth for permission to move his workers to a munitions factory he plans to build in Brünnlitz near his hometown of Zwittau. Göth reluctantly agrees but charges a huge bribe. Schindler and Stern prepare a list of people to be transferred to Brünnlitz instead of Auschwitz. The list eventually includes 1,100 names.

As the Jewish workers are transported by train to Brünnlitz, the women and girls are mistakenly redirected to Auschwitz-Birkenau; Schindler bribes Rudolf Höss, the commandant of Auschwitz, for their release. At the new factory, Schindler forbids the SS guards from entering the production area without permission and encourages the Jews to observe the Sabbath. Over the next seven months, he spends his fortune bribing Nazi officials and buying shell casings from other companies. Due to Schindler&#x27;s machinations, the factory produces no usable armaments. He runs out of money in 1945, just as Germany surrenders.

As a Nazi Party member and war profiteer, Schindler must flee the advancing Red Army to avoid capture. The SS guards at the factory have been ordered to kill the Jewish workforce, but Schindler persuades them not to do so. Bidding farewell to his workers, he prepares to head west, hoping to surrender to the Americans. The workers give him a signed statement attesting to his role in saving Jewish lives and present him with a ring engraved with a Talmudic paraphrase: &quot;Whoever saves one life saves the world entire&quot;. Schindler breaks down in tears, feeling he should have done more, and is comforted by the workers before he and his wife leave in their car. When the &quot;Schindlerjuden&quot; awaken the next morning, a mounted Soviet officer announces they have been liberated but warns them not to go east because &quot;they hate you there&quot;. The Jews then walk into the countryside.

An epilogue reveals that Göth was executed via hanging for crimes against humanity; Schindler and his wife were declared Righteous Among the Nations and a tree was planted in his honor in the Garden of the Righteous Among the Nations. Many of the surviving &quot;Schindlerjuden&quot; and the actors portraying them visit Schindler&#x27;s grave and place stones on its marker (a traditional Jewish sign of respect for the dead), after which Liam Neeson lays two roses.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
Poldek Pfefferberg, one of the &quot;Schindlerjuden&quot;, made it his life&#x27;s mission to tell the story of his savior. Pfefferberg attempted to produce a biopic of Oskar Schindler with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) in 1963, with Howard Koch writing, but the deal fell through. In 1982, Thomas Keneally published his historical novel &quot;Schindler&#x27;s Ark&quot;, which he wrote after a chance meeting with Pfefferberg in Los Angeles in 1980. MCA president Sid Sheinberg sent director Steven Spielberg a &quot;New York Times&quot; review of the book. Spielberg, astounded by Schindler&#x27;s story, jokingly asked if it was true. &quot;I was drawn to it because of the paradoxical nature of the character,&quot; he said. &quot;What would drive a man like this to suddenly take everything he had earned and put it all in the service of saving these lives?&quot; Spielberg expressed enough interest for Universal Pictures to buy the rights to the novel. At their first meeting in spring 1983, he told Pfefferberg he would start filming in ten years. In the end credits of the film, Pfefferberg is credited as a consultant under the name Leopold Page.

Spielberg was unsure if he was mature enough to make a film about the Holocaust, and the project remained &quot;on [his] guilty conscience&quot;. Spielberg tried to pass the project to director Roman Polanski, but he refused Spielberg&#x27;s offer. Polanski&#x27;s mother was killed at Auschwitz, and he had lived in and survived the Kraków Ghetto. Polanski eventually directed his own Holocaust drama &quot;The Pianist&quot; (2002). Spielberg also offered the film to Sydney Pollack and Martin Scorsese, who was attached to direct &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; in 1988. However, Spielberg was unsure of letting Scorsese direct the film, as &quot;I&#x27;d given away a chance to do something for my children and family about the Holocaust.&quot; Spielberg offered him the chance to direct the 1991 remake of &quot;Cape Fear&quot; instead. Scorsese would later admit in an interview that while he believed his version of the film might&#x27;ve been good, he had no regrets passing it to Spielberg stating that &quot;it would not have been the hit that it became&quot;. Billy Wilder expressed an interest in directing the film as a memorial to his family, most of whom were murdered in the Holocaust. Brian De Palma also refused an offer to direct.

Spielberg finally decided to take on the project when he noticed that Holocaust deniers were being given serious consideration by the media. With the rise of neo-Nazism after the fall of the Berlin Wall, he worried that people were too accepting of intolerance, as they were in the 1930s. Sid Sheinberg greenlit the film on condition that Spielberg made &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; first. Spielberg later said, &quot;He knew that once I had directed &quot;Schindler&quot; I wouldn&#x27;t be able to do &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;.&quot; The picture was assigned a small budget of $22 million, as Holocaust films are not usually profitable. Spielberg forwent a salary for the film, calling it &quot;blood money&quot;, and believed it would fail.

In 1983, Keneally was hired to adapt his book, and he turned in a 220-page script. His adaptation focused on Schindler&#x27;s numerous relationships, and Keneally admitted he did not compress the story enough. Spielberg hired Kurt Luedtke, who had adapted the screenplay of &quot;Out of Africa&quot;, to write the next draft. Luedtke gave up almost four years later, as he found Schindler&#x27;s change of heart too unbelievable. During his time as director, Scorsese hired Steven Zaillian to write a script. When he was handed back the project, Spielberg found Zaillian&#x27;s 115-page draft too short, and asked him to extend it to 195 pages. Spielberg wanted more focus on the Jews in the story, and he wanted Schindler&#x27;s transition to be gradual and ambiguous instead of a sudden breakthrough or epiphany. He also extended the ghetto liquidation sequence, as he &quot;felt very strongly that the sequence had to be almost unwatchable.&quot;

=== Casting ===
Liam Neeson auditioned as Schindler early on in the film&#x27;s development. He was cast in December 1992 after Spielberg saw him perform in &quot;Anna Christie&quot; on Broadway. Warren Beatty participated in a script reading, but Spielberg was concerned that he could not disguise his accent and that he would bring &quot;movie star baggage&quot;. Kevin Costner and Mel Gibson expressed interest in portraying Schindler, but Spielberg preferred to cast the relatively unknown Neeson so that the actor&#x27;s star quality would not overpower the character. Neeson felt Schindler enjoyed outsmarting the Nazis, who regarded him as somewhat naïve. &quot;They don&#x27;t quite take him seriously, and he used that to full effect.&quot; To help him prepare for the role, Spielberg showed Neeson film clips of Time Warner CEO Steve Ross, who had a charisma that Spielberg compared to Schindler&#x27;s. He also located a tape of Schindler speaking, which Neeson studied to learn the correct intonations and pitch.

Fiennes was cast as Amon Göth after Spielberg viewed his performances in &quot;A Dangerous Man: Lawrence After Arabia&quot; and &quot;Emily Brontë&#x27;s Wuthering Heights&quot;. Spielberg said of Fiennes&#x27; audition that &quot;I saw sexual evil. It is all about subtlety: there were moments of kindness that would move across his eyes and then instantly run cold.&quot; Fiennes put on to play the role. He watched historic newsreels and talked to Holocaust survivors who knew Göth. In portraying him, Fiennes said &quot;I got close to his pain. Inside him is a fractured, miserable human being. I feel split about him, sorry for him. He&#x27;s like some dirty, battered doll I was given and that I came to feel peculiarly attached to.&quot; Doctors Samuel J. Leistedt and Paul Linkowski of the Université libre de Bruxelles describe Göth&#x27;s character in the film as a classic psychopath. Fiennes looked so much like Göth in costume that when Mila Pfefferberg met him, she trembled with fear.

The character of Itzhak Stern (played by Ben Kingsley) is a composite of the accountant Stern, factory manager Abraham Bankier, and Göth&#x27;s personal secretary, Mietek Pemper. The character serves as Schindler&#x27;s alter ego and conscience. Dustin Hoffman was offered the role but he refused it.

Overall, there are 126 parts with dialogue in the film. Thousands of extras were hired during filming. Spielberg cast Israeli and Polish actors specially chosen for their Eastern European appearance. Many of the German actors were reluctant to don the SS uniform, but some of them later thanked Spielberg for the cathartic experience of performing in the film. Halfway through the shoot, Spielberg conceived the epilogue, where 128 survivors pay their respects at Schindler&#x27;s grave in Jerusalem. The producers scrambled to find the &quot;Schindlerjuden&quot; and fly them in to film the scene.

=== Filming ===
Principal photography began on March 1, 1993, in Kraków, Poland, with a planned schedule of 75 days. The crew shot at or near the actual locations, though the Płaszów camp had to be reconstructed in a nearby abandoned quarry, as modern high rise apartments were visible from the site of the original camp. Interior shots of the enamelware factory in Kraków were filmed at a similar facility in Olkusz, while exterior shots and the scenes on the factory stairs were filmed at the actual factory. The production received permission from Polish authorities to film on the grounds of the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum, but objections to filming within the actual death camp were raised by the World Jewish Congress. To avoid filming inside the actual death camp, the film crew constructed a replica of a portion of the camp just outside the entrance of Birkenau.

There were some antisemitic incidents. A woman who encountered Fiennes in his Nazi uniform told him: &quot;The Germans were charming people. They didn&#x27;t kill anybody who didn&#x27;t deserve it.&quot; Antisemitic symbols were scrawled on billboards near shooting locations, while Kingsley nearly entered a brawl with an elderly German-speaking businessman who insulted the Israeli actor Michael Schneider. Nonetheless, Spielberg said that, at Passover, &quot;all the German actors showed up. They put on yarmulkes and opened up Haggadas, and the Israeli actors moved right next to them and began explaining it to them. And this family of actors sat around and race and culture were just left behind.&quot;

Shooting &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; was deeply emotional for Spielberg, as the subject matter forced him to confront elements of his childhood, such as the antisemitism he faced. He was surprised that he did not cry while visiting Auschwitz; instead, he found himself filled with outrage. He was one of many crew members who could not force themselves to watch during the shooting of the scene where aging Jews are forced to run naked while being selected by Nazi doctors to go to Auschwitz. Spielberg commented that he felt more like a reporter than a film maker – he would set up scenes and then watch events unfold, almost as though he were witnessing them rather than creating a film. Several actresses broke down when filming the shower scene, including one who was born in a concentration camp. Spielberg, his wife Kate Capshaw, and their five children rented a house in suburban Kraków for the duration of filming. He later thanked his wife &quot;for rescuing me ninety-two days in a row ... when things just got too unbearable&quot;. Robin Williams called Spielberg to cheer him up, given the profound lack of humor on the set.

Spielberg spent several hours each evening editing &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, which was scheduled to premiere in June 1993.

Spielberg occasionally used German and Polish language dialogue to create a sense of realism. He initially considered making the film entirely in those languages, but decided &quot;there&#x27;s too much safety in reading . It would have been an excuse to take their eyes off the screen and watch something else.&quot;

=== Cinematography ===
Influenced by the 1985 documentary film &quot;Shoah&quot;, Spielberg decided not to plan the film with storyboards, and to shoot it like a documentary. Forty percent of the film was shot with handheld cameras, and the modest budget meant the film was shot quickly over seventy-two days. Spielberg felt that this gave the film &quot;a spontaneity, an edge, and it also serves the subject.&quot; He filmed without using Steadicams, elevated shots, or zoom lenses, &quot;everything that for me might be considered a safety net.&quot; This matured Spielberg, who felt that in the past he had always been paying tribute to directors such as Cecil B. DeMille or David Lean.

Spielberg decided to use black and white to match the feel of documentary footage of the era. Cinematographer Janusz Kamiński compared the effect to German Expressionism and Italian neorealism. Kamiński said that he wanted to give the impression of timelessness to the film, so the audience would &quot;not have a sense of when it was made&quot;. Universal chairman Tom Pollock asked him to shoot the film on a color negative, to allow color VHS copies of the film to later be sold, but Spielberg did not want to accidentally &quot;beautify events&quot;. However, scenes with the girl in the red coat were shot in color, and later rotoscoped over by hand to remove all color except for the coat.

===Music===

John Williams, who frequently collaborates with Spielberg, composed the score for &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;. The composer was amazed by the film, and felt it would be too challenging. He said to Spielberg, &quot;You need a better composer than I am for this film.&quot; Spielberg responded, &quot;I know. But they&#x27;re all dead!&quot; Itzhak Perlman performs the theme on the violin.

In the scene where the ghetto is being liquidated by the Nazis, the folk song &quot;Oyfn Pripetshik&quot; (, &#x27;On the Cooking Stove&#x27;) is sung by a children&#x27;s choir. The song was often sung by Spielberg&#x27;s grandmother, Becky, to her grandchildren. The clarinet solos heard in the film were recorded by Klezmer virtuoso Giora Feidman. Williams won an Academy Award for Best Original Score for &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;, his fifth win. Selections from the score were released on a soundtrack album.

== Themes and symbolism ==
The film explores the theme of good and evil, using as its main protagonist a &quot;good German&quot;, a popular characterization in American cinema. While Göth is portrayed as an almost completely dark and evil person, Schindler gradually evolves from Nazi supporter to rescuer and hero. Thus a second theme of redemption is introduced as Schindler, a disreputable schemer on the edges of respectability, becomes a father figure responsible for saving the lives of more than a thousand people.

=== The girl in red ===

While the film is shot primarily in black and white, a red coat is used to distinguish a little girl in the scene depicting the liquidation of the Kraków ghetto. Later in the film, Schindler sees her exhumed dead body, recognizable only by the red coat she is still wearing. Spielberg said the scene was intended to symbolize how members of the highest levels of government in the United States knew the Holocaust was occurring, yet did nothing to stop it. He said: &quot;It was as obvious as a little girl wearing a red coat, walking down the street, and yet nothing was done to bomb the German rail lines. Nothing was being done to slow down ... the annihilation of European Jewry. So that was my message in letting that scene be in color.&quot; Andy Patrizio of &quot;IGN&quot; notes that the point at which Schindler sees the girl&#x27;s dead body is the point at which he changes, no longer seeing &quot;the ash and soot of burning corpses piling up on his car as just an annoyance&quot;. Professor André H. Caron of the Université de Montréal wonders if the red symbolizes &quot;innocence, hope or the red blood of the Jewish people being sacrificed in the horror of the Holocaust&quot;.

The girl was portrayed by Oliwia Dąbrowska, three years old at the time of filming. Spielberg asked Dąbrowska not to watch the film until she was eighteen, but she watched it when she was eleven, and says she was &quot;horrified&quot;. Upon seeing the film again as an adult, she was proud of the role she played. Roma Ligocka, who says she was known in the Kraków Ghetto for her red coat, feels the character might have been based on her. Ligocka, unlike her fictional counterpart, survived the Holocaust. After the film was released, she wrote and published her own story, &quot;The Girl in the Red Coat: A Memoir&quot; (2002, in translation). Alternatively, according to her relatives who were interviewed in 2014, the girl may have been inspired by Kraków resident Genya Gitel Chil.

=== Candles ===
The opening scene features a family observing Shabbat. Spielberg said that &quot;to start the film with the candles being lit ... would be a rich bookend, to start the film with a normal Shabbat service before the juggernaut against the Jews begins&quot;. When the color fades out in the film&#x27;s opening moments, it gives way to a world in which smoke comes to symbolize bodies being burnt at Auschwitz. Only at the end, when Schindler allows his workers to hold Shabbat services, do the images of candle fire regain their warmth through color. For Spielberg, they represent &quot;just a glint of color, and a glimmer of hope.&quot; Sara Horowitz, director of the Koschitzky Centre for Jewish Studies at York University, sees the candles as a symbol for the Jews of Europe, killed and then burned in the crematoria. The two scenes bracket the Nazi era, marking its beginning and end. She points out that normally, the woman of the house lights the Sabbath candles. In the film, it is men who perform this ritual, demonstrating not only the subservient role of women, but also the subservient position of Jewish men in relation to Aryan men, especially Göth and Schindler.

=== Other symbolism ===
To Spielberg, the black and white presentation of the film came to represent the Holocaust itself: &quot;The Holocaust was life without light. For me the symbol of life is color. That&#x27;s why a film about the Holocaust has to be in black-and-white.&quot; Robert Gellately notes the film in its entirety can be seen as a metaphor for the Holocaust, with early sporadic violence increasing into a crescendo of death and destruction. He also notes a parallel between the situation of the Jews in the film and the debate in Nazi Germany between making use of the Jews for slave labor or exterminating them outright. Water is seen as giving deliverance by Alan Mintz, Holocaust Studies professor at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in New York. He notes its presence in the scene where Schindler arranges for a Holocaust train loaded with victims awaiting transport to be hosed down, and the scene in Auschwitz, where the women are given an actual shower instead of receiving the expected gassing.

== Release ==
&quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; opened in theaters on December 15, 1993, in the United States and December 25 in Canada. Its premiere in Germany was on March 1, 1994. Its American network television premiere was on NBC on February 23, 1997. Shown uncut and without commercials, it ranked No. 3 for the week with a 20.9/31 rating/share, the highest Nielsen rating for any film since NBC&#x27;s broadcast of &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; in May 1995. The film aired on public television in Israel on Holocaust Memorial Day in 1998.

The film was released in a THX widescreen VHS format on September 9, 1997. The DVD was released on March 9, 2004, in widescreen and full screen editions, on a double-sided disc with the feature film beginning on side A and continuing on side B. Special features include a documentary introduced by Spielberg. Also released for both formats was a limited edition gift set, which included the widescreen version of the film, Keneally&#x27;s novel, the film&#x27;s soundtrack on CD, a senitype, and a photo booklet titled &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List: Images of the Steven Spielberg Film&quot;, all housed in a plexiglass case. The laserdisc gift set was a limited edition that included the soundtrack, the original novel, and an exclusive photo booklet. As part of its 20th anniversary, the film was released on Blu-ray Disc on March 5, 2013. The film was digitally remastered in 4K, Dolby Vision and Atmos and was reissued into theaters on December 7, 2018, for its 25th anniversary. The film was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray on December 18, 2018.

Following the success of the film, Spielberg founded the Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation, a nonprofit organization with the goal of providing an archive for the filmed testimony of as many survivors of the Holocaust as possible, to save their stories. He continues to finance that work. Spielberg used proceeds from the film to finance several related documentaries, including &quot;Anne Frank Remembered&quot; (1995), &quot;The Lost Children of Berlin&quot; (1996), and &quot;The Last Days&quot; (1998).

== Reception ==
=== Critical response ===

&quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; received acclaim from both film critics and audiences, with Americans such as talk show host Oprah Winfrey and President Bill Clinton urging others to see it. World leaders in many countries saw the film, and some met personally with Spielberg. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has received an approval rating of 98% based on 137 reviews, with an average rating of 9.20/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; blends the abject horror of the Holocaust with Steven Spielberg&#x27;s signature tender humanism to create the director&#x27;s dramatic masterpiece.&quot; Metacritic gave the film a weighted average score of 95 out of 100, based on 30 critics. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare average grade of &quot;A+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Stephen Schiff of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called it the best historical drama about the Holocaust, a film that &quot;will take its place in cultural history and remain there.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film four stars out of four and described it as Spielberg&#x27;s best, &quot;brilliantly acted, written, directed, and seen.&quot; Ebert and Gene Siskel named it the best film of 1993. Terrence Rafferty, also with &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, admired the film&#x27;s &quot;narrative boldness, visual audacity, and emotional directness.&quot; He noted the performances of Neeson, Fiennes, Kingsley, and Davidtz as warranting special praise, and calls the scene in the shower at Auschwitz &quot;the most terrifying sequence ever filmed.&quot; In the 2013 edition of his &quot;Movie and Video Guide&quot;, Leonard Maltin awarded the picture a four-out-of-four-star rating; he described the film as a &quot;staggering adaptation of Thomas Keneally&#x27;s best-seller ... with such frenzied pacing that it looks and feels like nothing Hollywood has ever made before ... Spielberg&#x27;s most intense and personal film to date&quot;. James Verniere of the &quot;Boston Herald&quot; noted the film&#x27;s restraint and lack of sensationalism, and called it a &quot;major addition to the body of work about the Holocaust.&quot; In his review for &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, British critic John Gross said his misgivings that the story would be overly sentimentalized &quot;were altogether misplaced. Spielberg shows a firm moral and emotional grasp of his material. The film is an outstanding achievement.&quot; Mintz notes that even the film&#x27;s harshest critics admire the &quot;visual brilliance&quot; of the fifteen-minute segment depicting the liquidation of the Kraków ghetto. He describes the sequence as &quot;realistic&quot; and &quot;stunning&quot;. He points out that the film has done much to increase Holocaust remembrance and awareness as the remaining survivors pass away, severing the last living links with the catastrophe. The film&#x27;s release in Germany led to widespread discussion about why most Germans did not do more to help.

Criticism of the film also appeared, mostly from academia rather than the popular press. Sara Horowitz points out that much of the Jewish activity seen in the ghetto consists of financial transactions such as lending money, trading on the black market, or hiding wealth, thus perpetuating a stereotypical view of Jewish life. Horowitz notes that while the depiction of women in the film accurately reflects Nazi ideology, the low status of women and the link between violence and sexuality is not explored further. History professor Omer Bartov of Brown University notes that the physically large and strongly drawn characters of Schindler and Göth overshadow the Jewish victims, who are depicted as small, scurrying, and frightened – a mere backdrop to the struggle of good versus evil.

Horowitz points out that the film&#x27;s dichotomy of absolute good versus absolute evil glosses over the fact that most Holocaust perpetrators were ordinary people; the film does not explore how the average German rationalized their knowledge of or participation in the Holocaust. Author Jason Epstein commented that the film gives the false impression that if people were smart enough or lucky enough, they could survive the Holocaust. Spielberg responded to criticism that Schindler&#x27;s breakdown as he says farewell is too maudlin and even out of character by pointing out that the scene is needed to drive home the sense of loss and to allow the viewer an opportunity to mourn alongside the characters on the screen.

Bartov wrote that the &quot;positively repulsive kitsch of the last two scenes seriously undermines much of the film&#x27;s previous merits&quot;. He describes the humanization of Schindler as &quot;banal&quot;, and is critical of what he describes as the &quot;Zionist closure&quot; set to the song &quot;Jerusalem of Gold&quot;.

Holocaust film scholar Rich Brownstein wrote, &quot;The most powerful object in our Holocaust universe is &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;; the most dangerous activity in our Holocaust universe is criticizing &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;.&quot; Brownstein opines that &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; should be treated no differently than any other white savior narrative in film and that the Amon Göth character bloated the film with an unnecessary supervillain. Brownstein particularly objects to &quot;the most obnoxious fake gas/shower scene of any film – replete with 70 seconds of anticipation before water finally flows.&quot;

=== Assessment by other filmmakers ===
&quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; was very well received by many of Spielberg&#x27;s peers. Filmmaker Billy Wilder wrote to Spielberg saying, &quot;They couldn&#x27;t have gotten a better man. This movie is absolutely perfection.&quot; Polanski, who turned down the chance to direct the film, later commented, &quot;I certainly wouldn&#x27;t have done as good a job as Spielberg because I couldn&#x27;t have been as objective as he was.&quot; He cited &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; as an influence on his 1994 film &quot;Death and the Maiden&quot;. Martin Scorsese, who passed the film back to Spielberg and stated his version had different ideas from the final film including a different ending, would later comment &quot;I admired the film greatly.&quot; The success of &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; led filmmaker Stanley Kubrick to abandon his own Holocaust project, &quot;Aryan Papers&quot;, which would have been about a Jewish boy and his aunt who survive the war by sneaking through Poland while pretending to be Catholic. According to scriptwriter Frederic Raphael, when he suggested to Kubrick that &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; was a good representation of the Holocaust, Kubrick commented, &quot;Think that&#x27;s about the Holocaust? That was about success, wasn&#x27;t it? The Holocaust is about 6 million people who get killed. &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; is about 600 who don&#x27;t.&quot;

Filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard accused Spielberg of using the film to make a profit out of a tragedy while Schindler&#x27;s wife, Emilie Schindler, lived in poverty in Argentina. Keneally disputed claims that she was never paid for her contributions, &quot;not least because I had recently sent Emilie a check myself.&quot; He also confirmed with Spielberg&#x27;s office that payment had been sent from there. Filmmaker Michael Haneke criticized the sequence in which Schindler&#x27;s women are accidentally sent off to Auschwitz and herded into showers: &quot;There&#x27;s a scene in that film when we don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s gas or water coming out in the showers in the camp. You can only do something like that with a naive audience like in the United States. It&#x27;s not an appropriate use of the form. Spielberg meant well – but it was dumb.&quot;

Claude Lanzmann, the director of the nine-hour Holocaust documentary &quot;Shoah&quot; (1985), called &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; a &quot;kitschy melodrama&quot; and a &quot;deformation&quot; of historical truth. &quot;Fiction is a transgression, I am deeply convinced that there is a ban on depiction [of the Holocaust]&quot;, he said. Lanzmann also criticized Spielberg for viewing the Holocaust through the eyes of a German, saying &quot;it is the world in reverse&quot;. He said: &quot;I sincerely thought that there was a time before &quot;Shoah&quot;, and a time after &quot;Shoah&quot;, and that after &quot;Shoah&quot; certain things could no longer be done. Spielberg did them anyway.&quot;

=== Reaction of the Jewish community ===
At a 1994 &quot;Village Voice&quot; symposium about the film, historian Annette Insdorf described how her mother, a survivor of three concentration camps, felt gratitude that the Holocaust story was finally being told in a major film that would be widely viewed. Hungarian Jewish author Imre Kertész, a Holocaust survivor, feels it is impossible for life in a Nazi concentration camp to be accurately portrayed by anyone who did not experience it first-hand. While commending Spielberg for bringing the story to a wide audience, he found the film&#x27;s final scene at the graveyard neglected the terrible after-effects of the experience on the survivors and implied that they came through emotionally unscathed. Rabbi Uri D. Herscher found the film an &quot;appealing&quot; and &quot;uplifting&quot; demonstration of humanitarianism. Norbert Friedman noted that, like many Holocaust survivors, he reacted with a feeling of solidarity towards Spielberg of a sort normally reserved for other survivors. Albert L. Lewis, Spielberg&#x27;s childhood rabbi and teacher, described the film as &quot;Steven&#x27;s gift to his mother, to his people, and in a sense to himself. Now he is a full human being.&quot;

===Box office===
The film grossed $96.1 million ($ in dollars) in the United States and Canada and over $321.2 million worldwide. In Germany, the film was viewed by over 100,000 people in its first week alone from 48 screens and was eventually shown in 500 theaters (including 80 paid for by municipal authorities), with a total of six million admissions and a gross of $38 million. Its 25th anniversary showings grossed $551,000 in 1,029 theaters.

=== Accolades ===
Spielberg won the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing – Feature Film for his work, and shared the Producers Guild of America Award for Best Theatrical Motion Picture with co-producers Branko Lustig and Gerald R. Molen. Steven Zaillian won the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. The film also won the National Board of Review for Best Film, along with the National Society of Film Critics for Best Film, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Cinematography. Awards from the New York Film Critics Circle were also won for Best Film, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Cinematographer. The Los Angeles Film Critics Association awarded the film for Best Film, Best Cinematography (tied with &quot;The Piano&quot;), and Best Production Design. The film also won numerous other awards and nominations worldwide.

== Controversies ==
In Malaysia, the film was initially banned. The Film Censorship Board of Malaysia wrote to the film&#x27;s distributor, saying:

The Prime Minister of Malaysia at the time, Mahathir Mohamad, said that Malaysians &quot;have the right to ban any movie&quot;. He went on to say, &quot;I&#x27;m not antisemitic... I&#x27;m anti-Zionist expansion (and) the conquest of Arab territories by Zionists&quot;.

The film was also banned in Indonesia, where the Committee for World Muslim Solidarity described it as &quot;nothing but Zionist propaganda.&quot;

In the Philippines, chief censor Henrietta Mendez ordered cuts of three scenes depicting sexual intercourse and female nudity before the film could be shown in cinemas. Spielberg refused, and pulled the film from screening in Philippine cinemas, which prompted the Senate to demand the abolition of the censorship board. President Fidel V. Ramos himself intervened, ruling that the film could be shown uncut to anyone over the age of 15.

According to Slovak filmmaker Juraj Herz, the scene in which a group of women confuse an actual shower with a gas chamber is taken directly, shot by shot, from his film &quot;Zastihla mě noc&quot; (&quot;The Night Overtakes Me&quot;, 1986). Herz wanted to sue, but was unable to fund the case.

The song &quot;Yerushalayim Shel Zahav (&quot;Jerusalem of Gold&quot;) is featured in the film&#x27;s soundtrack and plays near the end of the film. This caused some controversy in Israel, as the song (which was written in 1967 by Naomi Shemer) is widely considered an informal anthem of the Israeli victory in the Six-Day War. In Israeli prints of the film, the song was replaced with &quot;Halikha LeKesariya (&quot;A Walk to Caesarea&quot;) by Hannah Szenes, a World War II resistance fighter.

For the 1997 American television showing, the film was broadcast virtually unedited. The telecast was the first to receive a TV-M (now TV-MA) rating under the TV Parental Guidelines that had been established earlier that year. Tom Coburn, then an Oklahoma congressman, said that in airing the film, NBC had brought television &quot;to an all-time low, with full-frontal nudity, violence and profanity&quot;, adding that it was an insult to &quot;decent-minded individuals everywhere&quot;. Under fire from both Republicans and Democrats, Coburn apologized, saying, &quot;My intentions were good, but I&#x27;ve obviously made an error in judgment in how I&#x27;ve gone about saying what I wanted to say.&quot; He clarified his opinion, stating that the film ought to have been aired later at night when there would not be &quot;large numbers of children watching without parental supervision&quot;.

Controversy arose in Germany for the film&#x27;s television premiere on ProSieben. Protests among the Jewish community ensued when the station intended to televise it with two commercial breaks of 3–4 minutes each. Ignatz Bubis, head of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, said: &quot;It is problematic to interrupt such a movie by commercials&quot;. Jerzy Kanal, chairman of the Jewish Community of Berlin, added &quot;It is obvious that the film could have a greater impact [on society] when broadcast unimpeded by commercials. The station has to do everything possible to broadcast the film without interruption.&quot; As a compromise, the broadcast included one break consisting of a short news update framed with commercials. ProSieben was also obliged to broadcast two accompanying documentaries to the film, showing &quot;The daily lives of the Jews in Hebron and New York&quot; prior to broadcast and &quot;The survivors of the Holocaust&quot; afterwards.

==Legacy==
&quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; featured on a number of &quot;best of&quot; lists, including the &quot;TIME&quot; magazine&#x27;s Top Hundred as selected by critics Richard Corliss and Richard Schickel, &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine&#x27;s 100 Greatest Films Centenary Poll conducted in 1995, and Leonard Maltin&#x27;s &quot;100 Must See Movies of the Century&quot;. The Vatican included &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; in its list of 45 important films – the latest-released entry to make the list. A Channel 4 poll named &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; the ninth greatest film of all time, and it ranked fourth in their 2005 war films poll. The film was named the best of 1993 by critics such as James Berardinelli, Roger Ebert, and Gene Siskel. Deeming the film &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot;, the Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry in 2004. The film was shown at the Berlinale Film Festival in February 2023, at which Spielberg received an honorary Golden Bear award.

Due to the increased interest in Kraków created by the film, the city bought Oskar Schindler&#x27;s Enamel Factory in 2007 to create a permanent exhibition about the German occupation of the city from 1939 to 1945. The museum opened in June 2010.

<doc id="65835" wikidata="Q181826" url="?curid=65835" title="Please Please Me">
<text>Please Please Me is the debut studio album by the English rock band the Beatles. Produced by George Martin, it was released in the UK on EMI&#x27;s Parlophone label on 22 March 1963. The album&#x27;s 14 tracks include cover songs and original material written by the partnership of band members John Lennon and Paul McCartney.

The Beatles had signed with EMI in May 1962 and been assigned to the Parlophone label run by Martin. They released their debut single &quot;Love Me Do&quot; in October, which surprised Martin by reaching number 17 on what would become the official UK singles chart. Impressed, Martin suggested they record a live album and helped arrange their next single, &quot;Please Please Me&quot;, which topped the &quot;NME&quot; singles chart. Finding the Cavern Club, the band&#x27;s venue in their native Liverpool, unsuitable for recording, Martin switched to a simple studio album. The Beatles recorded &quot;Please Please Me&quot; in one day at EMI Studios on 11 February 1963, with Martin adding overdubs to &quot;Misery&quot; and &quot;Baby It&#x27;s You&quot; nine days later. The A-sides and B-sides of two previously released singles were added to the album.

The album was well-received in Britain, where it remained in the Top 10 for over a year, a record for a debut album that stood for half a century. The presence of several songs written by band members Lennon–McCartney (credited as &quot;McCartney–Lennon&quot; at the time) was unusual and marked the emergence of a &quot;self-contained rock band&quot;. On the other hand, the album was not released in the US, where the band sold poorly for most of 1963; after the stateside emergence of Beatlemania, Vee-Jay Records released a mild abridgment of the album as &quot;Introducing... The Beatles&quot; in early 1964, while EMI&#x27;s American label Capitol Records divided the material from &quot;Please Please Me&quot; across multiple albums. Other countries also received different versions of the album, which continued until 1987, when the entirety of the Beatles catalogue was brought to CD and internationally standardised to the UK albums.

&quot;Please Please Me&quot; remains critically acclaimed; it was voted 39th on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; in 2012, and number 622 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; in 2000.

==Background==
The Beatles originated in the skiffle scene of Liverpool in the late 1950s, and by 1961 had solidified their lineup with John Lennon on rhythm guitar, Paul McCartney on bass, George Harrison on lead guitar, and Pete Best on drums. The band mostly played cover songs, although Lennon and McCartney had a budding songwriting partnership that also contributed material. They returned to Liverpool in late 1961 after a stint in Hamburg backing English singer Tony Sheridan, and releasing a single with Sheridan, &quot;My Bonnie&quot;, on which they were credited as &quot;The Beat Brothers&quot;. Shortly after their return they were approached by Brian Epstein, a music store manager who recognized the group&#x27;s local popularity and became the group&#x27;s new manager. After a failed audition at Decca Records at the beginning of 1962, Epstein was eventually able to sign the group to EMI that May.

EMI offered the Beatles a recording contract on its Parlophone label run by George Martin. Though Martin was drawn to the Beatles&#x27; personalities and charisma, he was initially unconvinced that they could write hit songs. Their first session, on 6 June, with Best on drums, resulted in no recordings suitable for release. Martin reacted negatively to Best&#x27;s presence and insisted on the use of a session drummer in his stead; although this was standard procedure at the time, the band took this as a cue to drop Best in favour of Rory Storm and the Hurricanes drummer Ringo Starr. Their second session, on 4 September and now with Starr on drums, produced &quot;Love Me Do&quot;, which became their first single several weeks later, and an early version of &quot;Please Please Me&quot;. On 11 September, the band re-recorded &quot;Love Me Do&quot; with session drummer Andy White and recorded &quot;P.S. I Love You&quot;, which became the B-side to &quot;Love Me Do&quot;. They also recorded a sped-up version of &quot;Please Please Me&quot;, which Martin believed had hit potential but required more work.

Martin doubted the commercial appeal of &quot;Love Me Do&quot; and was surprised when it reached No. 17 on the British charts in November. Now convinced that the Beatles could write hits, Martin met the Beatles on 16 November and made two suggestions for their upcoming work. First, he suggested that they re-record &quot;Please Please Me&quot; and issue it as the Beatles&#x27; second single. Next, he proposed that they record a full album—a recommendation Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn deemed &quot;genuinely mind-boggling&quot; because the Beatles were so new to the music scene and because the album market was dominated by adult buyers, not teenagers. On 26 November, the Beatles held another session for &quot;Please Please Me&quot; (to be backed with &quot;Ask Me Why&quot;), after which Martin predicted that they had just made their first number one record.

As the Beatles had extensive stage experience and a large following of local fans in Liverpool, Martin proposed the band could record a live album, primarily of Lennon–McCartney songs at their resident venue, the Cavern Club, in December. Martin planned to attend the Beatles&#x27; 18 November Cavern concert to gauge its suitability for recording, though he postponed this visit until 12 December. Upon his visit to the Cavern, Martin decided the acoustics would be unsuitable and decided to record a traditional studio album in February 1963; as the Beatles had already recorded four songs for release, they would record another ten to complete the album. In the meantime, Martin also solicited the Beatles&#x27; input for album names; McCartney suggested &quot;Off the Beatle Track&quot;.

The single &quot;Please Please Me&quot; was released on 11 January 1963 and reached number one on the &quot;NME&quot;, &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, and &quot;Disc&quot; charts. In early February, the group undertook their first national tour, and they planned to record their album during a break in the tour on 11 February.

==Recording==

According to Martin, &quot;I asked them what they had which we could record quickly, and the answer was their stage act&quot; (the norm for British 12&quot; vinyl pop albums in 1963 was to have seven songs on each side whereas American albums usually had five or six songs per side). Martin said, &quot;It was a straightforward performance of their stage repertoire – a broadcast, more or less.&quot; Initially, a morning and afternoon session only were booked; the evening session was added later. Mark Lewisohn later wrote: &quot;There can scarcely have been 585 more productive minutes in the history of recorded music&quot;. Martin oversaw each session on the day, with Norman Smith as first engineer and Richard Langham as second engineer.
Recording took place on 11February 1963. The Beatles arrived with John Lennon suffering from a bad cold, which he attempted to treat with a steady supply of throat lozenges. They began their morning session at 10 am with &quot;There&#x27;s a Place&quot; and &quot;Seventeen&quot; (the working title of what became &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot;). The band rehearsed during their lunch break and then proceeded with their afternoon session. In that session, Paul McCartney recorded a double-tracked vocal for &quot;A Taste of Honey&quot; (a standard later covered by renowned soul artists such as The Supremes, Four Tops, and Mel Carter), George Harrison sang lead on &quot;Do You Want to Know a Secret&quot;, and Lennon and McCartney sang co-lead on &quot;Misery&quot;. During the evening session, the band recorded covers of &quot;Anna (Go to Him)&quot;, &quot;Boys&quot; (Ringo Starr&#x27;s sole vocal), &quot;Chains&quot; and &quot;Baby It&#x27;s You&quot;. The song &quot;Hold Me Tight&quot; was also recorded during the evening session, but proved &quot;surplus to requirements&quot; and was not included on the album.

At 10 pm, with the studios set to close soon, the day ended with a cover of &quot;Twist and Shout&quot;. The song was picked after a discussion in the studio canteen in which numerous songs were suggested before &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; was chosen. The performance, caught on the first take, prompted Martin to say: &quot;I don&#x27;t know how they do it. We&#x27;ve been recording all day but the longer we go on the better they get.&quot; Lennon later remarked, &quot;The last song nearly killed me. My voice wasn&#x27;t the same for a long time after; every time I swallowed, it was like sandpaper.&quot;

At the end of the evening session at 10:30 pm, the Beatles attended a full tape playback in the studio control room. Lennon reflected, &quot;Waiting to hear that LP played back was one of our most worrying experiences. ... As it happens, we were very happy with the result. The Beatles were not present during an overdub session on 20 February, during which Martin overdubbed piano on &quot;Misery&quot; and celesta on &quot;Baby It&#x27;s You&quot;.

The day of recording cost approximately £400 (). Martin said: &quot;There wasn&#x27;t a lot of money at Parlophone. I was working to an annual budget of £55,000.&quot; This budget had to cover all of the artists on Martin&#x27;s roster. Individually, under a contract with the Musicians&#x27; Union, each Beatle collected a session fee of £7 10s (£7.50; equivalent to £ in ) for each three-hour session (10:00 am – 1:00 pm / 2:30 pm – 5:30 pm / 7:30 pm – 10:30 pm).

Before deciding on the title &quot;Please Please Me&quot;, Martin considered calling the album &quot;Off the Beatle Track&quot;, a title he would later use for his own orchestral album of Beatles songs. The album was recorded on a two-track BTR tape machine with most of the instruments on one track and the vocals on the other, allowing Martin to better balance the two in the final mono mix. A stereo mix was also made with one track on the left channel and the other on the right, as well as an added layer of reverb to better blend the two tracks together. The two tracks generally divided the instrumental track from the vocals, with the exception of &quot;Boys&quot;, in which the close proximity of Ringo&#x27;s drums to his vocal microphone placed the drums (but not the other instruments) on the vocal channel.

Two tracks, &quot;Love Me Do&quot; and &quot;P.S. I Love You&quot;, were only mixed for mono for the single&#x27;s release and no stereo versions were ever made, so, for the stereo version of the album, during the mixing sessions on 25 February 1963, Martin created &quot;mock stereo&quot; versions by emphasising low frequencies on one side and high frequencies on the other. These versions would continue to be made available via compilation albums (such as &quot;1962–1966&quot;), and on Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs&#x27; half-speed mastered vinyl releases (catalogue number MFSL-1-101) sourced from EMI&#x27;s original stereo master tapes, until the Beatles&#x27; catalogue was standardised and issued on compact disc in 1987, starting with the first four UK albums being issued in their mono versions. However, when Capitol Records issued the second volume of American Beatles albums on compact disc (&quot;The Capitol Albums, Volume 2&quot;) in 2006, the same mock stereo versions that appeared on &quot;The Early Beatles&quot; were included. When the entire catalogue was remastered for release in 2009, the mono mixes were chosen for inclusion on the stereo reissues, and appear on all releases since, including newer compilations and variations.

==Artwork and packaging==
George Martin was an honorary fellow of the Zoological Society of London, which owns London Zoo, and he thought that it might be good publicity for the zoo to have the Beatles pose outside the insect house for the cover photography of the album. However, the society turned down Martin&#x27;s request, and instead, Angus McBean was asked to take the distinctive colour photograph of the group looking down over the stairwell inside EMI&#x27;s London headquarters in Manchester Square. Martin was to write later: &quot;We rang up the legendary theatre photographer Angus McBean, and bingo, he came round and did it there and then. It was done in an almighty rush, like the music. Thereafter, though, the Beatles&#x27; own creativity came bursting to the fore.&quot; In 1969, the Beatles asked McBean to recreate this shot. Although the 1969 photograph was originally intended for the then-planned &quot;Get Back&quot; album, it was not used when that project saw eventual release in 1970 as &quot;Let It Be&quot;. Instead, the 1969 photograph, along with an unused photograph from the 1963 photo shoot, was used in 1973 for the Beatles&#x27; retrospective albums &quot;1962–1966&quot; and &quot;1967–1970&quot;. Another unused photograph from the 1963 photo shoot was used for &quot;The Beatles (No. 1)&quot; (EP released 1 November 1963).

The Beatles&#x27; press officer Tony Barrow wrote extensive sleeve notes, which included a brief mention of their early 1960s rivals the Shadows.

==Release==

Parlophone released &quot;Please Please Me&quot; in the UK on 22 March 1963. As was typical for the time, the LP was initially released only in mono, with a stereo release following on 26 April. Singles remained the dominant format for pop music, made up mostly of teenage buyers, while more expensive LPs were typically reserved for genres like classical music and jazz, whose listeners could more easily afford the format. Author Barry Miles suggested the album&#x27;s cover design, promising &quot;Please Please Me&quot;, &quot;Love Me Do&quot; and &quot;12 Other Songs&quot;, indicated EMI&#x27;s desire to promote the album towards &quot;die-hard supporters&quot; excited by the two earlier singles.

&quot;Please Please Me&quot; hit the top of the UK album charts in May 1963 and remained there for 30 weeks before being replaced by &quot;With the Beatles&quot;. This was an unprecedented achievement for a pop album. At the time, the UK album charts tended to be dominated by film soundtracks and easy listening vocalists. &quot;Please Please Me&quot; was the first non-soundtrack album to spend more than one year consecutively inside the top ten of what became the Official UK Albums Chart (with 62 weeks). This record run of consecutive weeks in the top ten for a debut album stood until April 2013, when Emeli Sandé&#x27;s &quot;Our Version of Events&quot; achieved a 63rd consecutive week.

In the 30 March 1963 issue of &quot;Record Mirror&quot;, Norman Jopling reviewed the album in depth, providing track-by-track reviews for the ten songs that had not been previously released. He concludes that, for a debut, the LP is &quot;surprisingly good and up to standard&quot;, and contained many tracks that could have been released as singles, such as &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot; and &quot;Misery&quot;. Jopling further highlighted the LP&#x27;s packaging, writing that its cover image and sleeve notes provided extra value. Author Jonathan Gould suggests in retrospect that the album&#x27;s packaging majorly contributed to its success, promising fans &quot;glossy cover art&quot; and a greater companion to the music than the plain paper packaging then offered by singles.

===International and CD releases===
In addition to the UK, &quot;Please Please Me&quot; was released, un- or lightly-modified, in India, continental Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. In New Zealand, the album first appeared only in mono on the black Parlophone label. The following year (1964) EMI (NZ) changed from black to a blue Parlophone label and the album was again available only in mono. Due to constant demand, it was finally made available in stereo, first through the World Record Club on their &quot;Young World&quot; label in both mono and stereo, and finally on the blue Parlophone label. The album was released in Japan in 1969 with a different cover and a significantly shuffled tracklist.

EMI&#x27;s American subsidiary Capitol Records had been offered the opportunity to release Beatles material since the 1962 release of &quot;Love Me Do&quot;, but turned it down. Vee-Jay Records, a smaller label unaffiliated with EMI, took the initiative of bringing the Beatles to the United States, releasing the &quot;Please Please Me&quot; single on 25 February 1963. Despite its success in Britain, &quot;Please Please Me&quot; failed to chart in the US, and the May release of &quot;From Me to You&quot; was similarly lacklustre, leading Vee-Jay to lose interest in the Beatles. Originally planning on releasing the &quot;Please Please Me&quot; album unaltered in July, it ended up trimming &quot;Please Please Me&quot; and &quot;Ask Me Why&quot; to fit the standard American album length and releasing it as &quot;Introducing... The Beatles&quot; in January 1964. Capitol remained unimpressed with the group until the rapid success of &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; in Christmas 1963. Buoyed by the resultant Beatlemania and aware of their previous rejection of the Beatles, Capitol released a modified version of the group&#x27;s second album &quot;With the Beatles&quot;, coming out with &quot;Meet the Beatles!&quot; shortly after Vee-Jay had released &quot;Introducing... The Beatles&quot;. &quot;Meet the Beatles!&quot; contains &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot;, which Capitol released as the American B-side of &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot;. Finally acquiring the rights to early Beatles recordings back from Vee-Jay in late 1964, Capitol released most of the other tracks from &quot;Please Please Me&quot; on &quot;The Early Beatles&quot; in March 1965, although &quot;Misery&quot; and &quot;There&#x27;s a Place&quot; remained unreleased by Capitol until 1980&#x27;s &quot;Rarities&quot;.

In Canada, the majority of the album&#x27;s songs were included upon the Canadian-exclusive release &quot;Twist and Shout&quot;, which featured &quot;From Me to You&quot; and &quot;She Loves You&quot; in place of &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot; and &quot;Misery&quot;.

The album was released on CD on 26 February 1987, in mono, as were their three subsequent albums, &quot;With the Beatles&quot;, &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; and &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot;. It was not released on vinyl or tape in the US until five months later when it was issued for the first time in the US on LP and cassette on 21 July 1987.

&quot;Please Please Me&quot; was remastered and re-released on CD in stereo, along with all the other original UK studio albums, on 9 September 2009. The 2009 remasters replaced the 1987 remasters. A remastered mono CD was also available as part of &quot;The Beatles in Mono&quot; box set.

== Retrospective assessment ==
In a 1987 review coinciding with the album&#x27;s CD reissue, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s Steve Pond recommended &quot;Please Please Me&quot; &quot;for the Beatles&#x27; unfettered joy at making music&quot;. Senior AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine summarised, &quot;Decades after its release, the album still sounds fresh&quot;, serving as an effective encapsulation of the band&#x27;s early influences, further finding the covers &quot;impressive&quot; and the originals &quot;astonishing&quot;.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine cited Lennon–McCartney&#x27;s original compositions as early evidence of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;[invention of] the idea of the self-contained rock band, writing their own hits and playing their own instruments&quot;.

The album&#x27;s 2009 remaster attracted a number of reviewers. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; Tom Ewing described the album as &quot;a raw, high-energy run-through of their early live set&quot; that acts as &quot;the sound of rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll finding a suddenly large, new audience.&quot; He praised the album&#x27;s cohesiveness, where the &quot;evening with the band&quot; mood sets it apart from the band&#x27;s other cover-heavy works, creating a non-filler track experience with great covers and originals and, above all, great vocal performances. The same year, Mark Kemp was positive reviewing the band&#x27;s entire remastered catalogue for &quot;Paste&quot;, commending the band for infusing African American musical styles with &quot;chirpy harmonies&quot; from girl groups like the Shirelles to create &quot;a sound the pop world had never heard&quot;. &quot;The Telegraph&quot; writer Neil McCormick praised the band&#x27;s performances throughout the record, contending that &quot;the sheer accomplishment of their tight, syncopated playing and perfect harmony singing is astonishing to behold.&quot; Alex Young described the album as a dance masterpiece in &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot;, finding the remaster an improvement over the original mix.

Writing for BBC Music in 2010, Mike Diver contended that although not regarded as their most critically acclaimed release, &quot;Please Please Me&quot; stands as a &quot;vital moment&quot; in the band&#x27;s history, as it &quot;set in motion the wheels that would carry them to the very peak of public recognition, and subsequently into realms of sonic experimentation that would create a template for so much rock and pop music since.&quot; Diver further argued that the album&#x27;s long reign at the top of the UK charts provided a rebuttal to Decca Records&#x27; stance that guitar groups were &quot;on the way out&quot;. The writers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; agreed in &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, writing that &quot;Please Please Me&quot; acted as a blueprint for &quot;everything the Beatles would ever do&quot;.

In &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot;, Michael Gallucci praised &quot;Please Please Me&quot; as a cohesive debut album that established a rough blueprint in the Beatles&#x27; working methods over the next few years, despite finding some tracks did not work as well as others, concluding, &quot;&quot;Please Please Me&quot; proved that the music that everyone was ignoring was uniformly great.&quot; Looking back on the album in 2016, the &quot;NME&quot; Hamish MacBain found it imperfect, but commended the ensemble for creating a record of excellent covers and originals that displayed &quot;flashes of brilliance&quot;. MacBain acknowledged the band would make better records, but concluded that &quot;the resulting, snapshot nature&quot; of their debut outing &quot;is exactly what makes it so great&quot;.

===Rankings===
&quot;Please Please Me&quot; has made appearances on several best-of lists. In 2012, it was voted 39th on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. It was ranked first among the Beatles&#x27; early albums, and sixth of all of the Beatles&#x27; albums, with &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, &quot;Revolver&quot;, &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;, &quot;The Beatles&quot; (also known as &quot;The White Album&quot;) and &quot;Abbey Road&quot; ranked higher. English writer Colin Larkin listed &quot;Please Please Me&quot; at number 622 in the third edition of his book &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000). &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; also placed two songs from the album on its 2004 edition of the &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;: &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot; at number 140, and &quot;Please Please Me&quot; at number 186.

Several publications, including &quot;NME&quot;, have named &quot;Please Please Me&quot; one of the best debut albums of all time, with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;Uncut&quot; both ranking it number 17. In 2015, &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; ranked it the Beatles&#x27; eighth best album and included it in their list of the top 100 rock albums from the 1960s.

===50th anniversary===
In 2013, the album&#x27;s 50th anniversary was celebrated by modern artists re-recording the album in just one day, as the Beatles recorded it 50 years earlier. Stereophonics recorded a cover of the album&#x27;s opening track, &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot;. This and the other recordings were broadcast on BBC Radio 2, and a documentary about the re-recording of the Beatles&#x27; debut album was broadcast on BBC Television.

<doc id="65836" wikidata="Q4201697" url="?curid=65836" title="Republicanism in Australia">
<text>Republicanism in Australia is a movement to change Australia&#x27;s system of government from a constitutional monarchy to a republic; presumably, a form of parliamentary republic that would replace the monarch of Australia (currently King Charles III) with a non-royal Australian head of state. It is opposed to monarchism in Australia. Republicanism was first espoused in Australia before Federation in 1901. After a period of decline following Federation, the movement again became prominent at the end of the 20th century after successive legal and socio-cultural changes loosened Australia&#x27;s ties with the United Kingdom.

Republicanism is officially supported by the Labor Party and the Greens, and is also supported by some Liberal Party members of the Australian Parliament. There was an assistant minister for the republic from 1 June 2022 until 28 July 2024. In a referendum held in 1999, Australian voters rejected a proposal to establish a republic with a parliamentary appointed head of state. This was despite polls showing a majority of Australians supported a republic in principle for some years before the vote.

==History==
===Before federation===
In his journal &quot;The Currency Lad&quot;, first published in Sydney in 1832, pastoralist and politician Horatio Wills was the first person to openly espouse Australian republicanism. Born to a convict father, Wills was devoted to the emancipist cause and promoted the interests of &quot;currency lads and lasses&quot; (Australian-born Europeans).
Some leaders and participants of the revolt at the Eureka Stockade in 1854 held republican views and the incident has been used to encourage republicanism in subsequent years, with the Eureka Flag appearing in connection with some republican groups. The Australian Republican Association (ARA) was founded in response to the Eureka Stockade, advocating the abolition of governors and their titles, the revision of the penal code, payment of members of parliament, the nationalisation of land and an independent federal Australian republic outside of the British Empire. David Flint, the national convener of Australians for Constitutional Monarchy, notes that a movement emerged in favour of a White Australia policy; however British authorities in Whitehall were opposed to segregational laws. He suggests that to circumvent Westminster, those in favour of the discriminatory policies backed the proposed secession from the Empire as a republic.

One attendee of the ARA meetings was the Australian-born poet Henry Lawson, who wrote his first poem, entitled &quot;A Song of the Republic&quot;, in &quot;The Republican&quot; journal.
===Federation and decline===

At the Australian Federation Convention, which produced the first draft that was to become the Australian Constitution in 1891, a former Premier of New South Wales, George Dibbs, stated the &quot;inevitable destiny of the people of this great country&quot; would be the establishment of &quot;the Republic of Australia&quot;. The fervour of republicanism tailed off in the 1890s as the labour movement became concerned with the Federation of Australia. The republican movement dwindled further during and after World War I as emotional and patriotic support for the war effort went hand in hand with a renewed sense of loyalty to the monarchy. &quot;The Bulletin&quot; abandoned republicanism and became a conservative, Empire loyalist paper. The Returned and Services League formed in 1916 and became an important bastion of monarchist sentiment.

The conservative parties were fervently monarchist and although the Labor Party campaigned for greater Australian independence within the Empire and generally supported the appointment of Australians as Governor-General, it did not question the monarchy itself. Under the Labor government of John Curtin, a member of the Royal Family, Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, was appointed Governor-General during World War II. The royal tour of Queen Elizabeth II in 1954 saw a reported 7 million Australians (out of a total population of 9 million) out to see her.

The 1975 Australian constitutional crisis, which culminated in the dismissal of Prime Minister Gough Whitlam by Governor-General John Kerr, raised questions about the value of maintaining a supposedly symbolic office that still possessed many key constitutional powers and what an Australian president with the same reserve powers would do in a similar situation.

===Changes to oaths and titles===
References to the monarchy were removed from various institutions through the late 1980s and 1990s. For example, in 1993, the Oath of Citizenship, which included an assertion of allegiance to the Australian monarch, was replaced by a pledge to be loyal to &quot;Australia and its people&quot;. Earlier, in 1990, the formula of enactment for the Parliament of Australia was changed from &quot;Be it enacted by the Queen, and the Senate, and the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia as follows&quot; to &quot;The Parliament of Australia enacts&quot;.

Barristers in New South Wales (from 1993), Queensland (from 1994), ACT (from 1995), Victoria (from 2000), Western Australia (from 2001), Tasmania (from 2005), Northern Territory (from 2007), Commonwealth (from March 2007) and South Australia (from 2008) were no longer appointed Queen&#x27;s Counsel (QC), but as Senior Counsel (SC). These changes were criticised by Justice Michael Kirby and other monarchists as moves to a &quot;republic by stealth&quot;. However beginning with Queensland in 2013, Victoria and the Commonwealth in 2014 and followed by South Australia in 2020 the title of Queen&#x27;s Counsel (QC) and now King&#x27;s Counsel (KC) has again been conferred, in part due to the title&#x27;s greater regard and recognition, internationally and domestically. There remains interest in New South Wales for a reintroduction of the title. In 2024, South Australia reverted back to only appointing SCs.

===Keating government proposals===
The Australian Labor Party (ALP) first made republicanism its official policy in 1991, with then Prime Minister Bob Hawke describing a republic as &quot;inevitable&quot;. Following the ALP decision, the Australian Republican Movement, the leading republican advocacy group, was born. Hawke&#x27;s successor, Paul Keating, pursued the republican agenda much more actively than Hawke and established the Republic Advisory Committee to produce an options paper on issues relating to the possible transition to a republic to take effect on the centenary of Federation: 1 January 2001. The committee produced its report in April 1993 and in it argued that &quot;a republic is achievable without threatening Australia&#x27;s cherished democratic institutions&quot;.

In response to the report, Keating promised a referendum on the establishment of a republic, replacing the Governor-General with a president, and removing references to the Australian sovereign. The president was to be nominated by the prime minister and appointed by a two-thirds majority in a joint sitting of the Senate and House of Representatives. The referendum was to be held either in 1998 or 1999. However, Keating&#x27;s party lost the 1996 federal election in a landslide and he was replaced by John Howard, a monarchist, as prime minister.

===1998 Constitutional Convention===

With the change in government in 1996, Prime Minister John Howard proceeded with an alternative policy of holding a constitutional convention. This was held over two weeks in February 1998 at Old Parliament House. Half of the 152 delegates were elected and half were appointed by the federal and state governments. Convention delegates were asked whether or not Australia should become a republic and which model for a republic is preferred. At the opening of the convention, Howard stated that if the convention could not decide on a model to be put to a referendum, then plebiscites would be held on the model preferred by the Australian public.

At the convention, a republic gained majority support (89 votes to 52 with 11 abstentions), but the question of what model for a republic should be put to the people at a referendum produced deep divisions among republicans. Four republican models were debated: two involving direct election of the head of state; one involving appointment on the advice of the prime minister (the McGarvie Model); and one involving appointment by a two-thirds majority of parliament (the bi-partisan appointment model).

The latter was eventually successful at the convention, even though it only obtained a majority because of 22 abstentions in the final vote (57 against delegates voted against the model and 73 voted for, three votes short of an actual majority of delegates). A number of those who abstained were republicans who supported direct election (such as Ted Mack, Phil Cleary, Clem Jones, and Andrew Gunter), thereby allowing the bi-partisan model to succeed. They reasoned that the model would be defeated at a referendum and a second referendum called with direct election as the model.

The convention also made recommendations about a preamble to the constitution and a proposed preamble was also put to referendum.

According to critics, the two-week timeline and quasi-democratic composition of the convention is evidence of an attempt by John Howard to frustrate the republican cause, a claim John Howard adamantly rejects.

===1999 Republican referendum===

The republic referendum was held on 6 November 1999, after a national advertising campaign and the distribution of 12.9 million &#x27;Yes/No&#x27; case pamphlets. It comprised two questions: The first asked whether Australia should become a republic in which the Governor-General and monarch would be replaced by one office, the President of the Commonwealth of Australia, the occupant elected by a two-thirds vote of the Australian parliament for a fixed term. The second question, generally deemed to be far less important politically, asked whether Australia should alter the constitution to insert a preamble. Neither of the amendments passed, with 55% of all electors and all states voting &#x27;no&#x27; to the proposed amendment; it was not carried in any state. The preamble referendum question was also defeated, with a Yes vote of only 39 per cent.

Many opinions were put forward for the defeat, some relating to perceived difficulties with the parliamentary appointment model, others relating to the lack of public engagement or that most Australians were simply happy to keep the status quo. Some republicans voted no because they did not agree with provisions such as the president being instantly dismissible by the prime minister.

===2000s: Following the referendum===
On 26 June 2003, the Senate referred an inquiry into an Australian republic to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. During 2004, the committee reviewed 730 submissions and conducted hearings in all state capitals. The committee tabled its report, called &quot;Road to a Republic&quot;, on 31 August 2004. The report examined the contest between minimalist and direct-election models and gave attention to hybrid models such as the electoral college model, the constitutional council model, and models having both an elected president and a Governor-General.

The bi-partisan recommendations of committee supported educational initiatives and holding a series of plebiscites to allow the public to choose which model they preferred, prior to a final draft and referendum, along the lines of plebiscites proposed by John Howard at the 1998 constitutional convention.

Issues related to republicanism were raised by the March 2006 tour of Australia by Queen Elizabeth II. John Howard, still serving as prime minister, was then questioned by British journalists about the future of the Australian monarchy and there was debate about playing Australia&#x27;s royal anthem, &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;, during the opening of that year&#x27;s Commonwealth Games, at which the monarch was present.

In July 2007, Opposition Leader Kevin Rudd pledged to hold a new referendum on a republic if called on to form a government. However, he stated there was no fixed time frame for such a move and that the result of the 1999 referendum must be respected. After his party won the 2007 federal election and Rudd was appointed prime minister, he stated in April 2008 that a move to a republic was &quot;not a top-order priority&quot;.

In the lead-up to the 2010 federal election, Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated: &quot;I believe that this nation should be a republic. I also believe that this nation has got a deep affection for Queen Elizabeth.&quot; She stated her belief that it would be appropriate for Australia to become a republic only once Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s reign ends.

===2010s===
In November 2013, Governor-General Quentin Bryce proclaimed her support for an Australian republic, stating in a speech &quot;perhaps, my friends, one day, one young girl or boy may even grow up to be our nation&#x27;s first head of state&quot;. She had previously emphasised the importance of debate about the future of the Australian head of state and the evolution of the constitution.

In January 2015, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten called for a new push for a republic, stating: &quot;Let us declare that our head of state should be one of us. Let us rally behind an Australian republic - a model that truly speaks for who we are, our modern identity, our place in our region and our world.&quot;

In September 2015, former Australian Republican Movement chair Malcolm Turnbull became leader of the Liberal Party and was appointed prime minister. He stated he would not pursue &quot;his dream&quot; of Australia becoming a republic until after the end of the Queen&#x27;s reign, instead focusing his efforts toward the economy. Upon meeting Elizabeth II in July 2017, Turnbull declared himself an &quot;Elizabethan&quot; and stated he did not believe a majority of Australians would support a republic before the end of her reign.

In December 2016, News.com.au found that a slim majority of members of both houses of parliament supported Australia becoming a republic (54% in the House and 53% in the Senate).

In July 2017, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten revealed that, should the Labor Party be elected in the 2019 federal election, they would legislate for a compulsory plebiscite on the issue. Should that plebiscite be supported by a majority of Australians, a second vote would be held, this time a referendum, asking the public for their support for a specific model of government. Labor lost the election.

===2020s===
Following Labor&#x27;s victory in the 2022 federal election, the new Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, appointed Matt Thistlethwaite as the Assistant Minister for the Republic, signalling a commitment to prepare Australia for a transition to republic following the next election. After the death of Elizabeth II, former prime minister Julia Gillard opined that Australia would inevitably choose to be a republic, but agreed with Albanese&#x27;s timing on debate about the matter. When asked if he supported another referendum following the Queen&#x27;s death, Albanese stated it was &quot;not the time&quot; to discuss a republic. Instead the government had focused on the referendum to enshrine an Indigenous Voice to Parliament, which has been described by the assistant minister as a &quot;critical first step&quot; before a vote possibly some time in 2026. The Prime Minister Anthony Albanese had stated: &quot;I couldn&#x27;t envisage a circumstance where we changed our head of state to an Australian head of state but still didn&#x27;t recognise First Nations people in our constitution.&quot; However, this referendum failed, leading to warnings within the government that it could not politically afford to lose a second referendum on constitutional reform and should focus instead on economic policy and leaving many senior republican leaders to fear there will be no chance for a successful referendum for at least a generation.

In January 2024, the government stated that the issue was &quot;not a priority&quot; and that there was no timeline for a new referendum, abandoning an earlier commitment to seek a referendum on the monarchy in its second term, but maintained that a republic was still Labor party policy in the long term. On 28 July 2024, the position of assistant minister for the republic, which was first established on 1 June 2022, was abolished in a ministerial reshuffle.

==Arguments for change==

===Independence and head of state===

A central argument made by Australian republicans is that, as Australia is an independent country, it is inappropriate and anomalous for Australia to share the person of its monarch with the United Kingdom. Republicans argue that the Australian monarch is not Australian and, as a national and resident of another country, cannot adequately represent Australia or Australian national aspirations, either to itself or to the rest of the world. Former Chief Justice Gerard Brennan stated that &quot;so long as we retain the existing system our head of state is determined for us essentially by the parliament at Westminster&quot;. As Australian Republican Movement member Frank Cassidy put it in a speech on the issue: &quot;In short, we want a resident for President.&quot;

===Multiculturalism and sectarianism===
Some republicans associate the monarchy with British identity and argue that Australia has changed demographically and culturally, from being &quot;British to our bootstraps&quot;, as prime minister Sir Robert Menzies once put it, to being less British in nature (albeit maintaining an &quot;English Core&quot;). Many Australian republicans are of non-British ancestry, and feel no connection to the &quot;mother country&quot; to speak of. According to an Australian government inquiry, arguments put forth by these republicans include the claim that the idea of one person being both monarch of Australia and of the United Kingdom is an anomaly.

However, monarchists argue that immigrants who left unstable republics and have arrived in Australia since 1945 welcomed the social and political stability that they found in Australia under a constitutional monarchy. Further, some Aboriginal Australians, such as former Senator Neville Bonner, said a republican president would not &quot;care one jot more for my people&quot;.

It has also been claimed monarchism and republicanism in Australia delineate historical and persistent sectarian tensions with, broadly speaking, Catholics more likely to be republicans and Protestants more likely to be monarchists. This developed out of a historical cleavage in 19th- and 20th-century Australia, in which republicans were predominantly of Irish Catholic background and loyalists were predominantly of British Protestant background. Whilst mass immigration since the Second World War has diluted this conflict, the Catholic–Protestant divide has been cited as a dynamic in the republic debate, particularly in relation to the referendum campaign in 1999. Nonetheless, others have stated that Catholic–Protestant tensions—at least in the sense of an Irish–British conflict—are at least forty years dead.

It has also been claimed, however, that the Catholic–Protestant divide is intermingled with class issues. Republicanism in Australia has traditionally been supported most strongly by members of the urban working class with Irish Catholic backgrounds, whereas monarchism is a core value associated with urban and rural inhabitants of British Protestant heritage and the middle class, to the extent that there were calls in 1999 for 300,000 exceptionally enfranchised British subjects who were not Australian citizens to be barred from voting on the grounds that they would vote as a loyalist bloc in a tight referendum.

===Social values and contemporary Australia===
From some perspectives, it has been argued that several characteristics of the monarchy are in conflict with modern Australian values. The hereditary nature of the monarchy is said to conflict with egalitarianism and dislike of inherited privilege. The laws of succession were, before amendment to them in 2015, held by some to be sexist and the links between the monarchy and the Church of England inconsistent with Australia&#x27;s secular character. Under the Act of Settlement, the monarch is prohibited from being a Catholic.

==Proposals for change==
A typical proposal for an Australian republic provides for the King and Governor-General to be replaced by a president or an executive federal council. There is much debate on the appointment or election process that would be used and what role such an office would have.

===Methods for deciding a head of state===
*Election
**by a popular vote of all Australian citizens;
**by the federal parliament alone;
**by federal and state parliaments;
**by a hybrid process of popular and parliamentary votes.
* Selection
**by the prime minister;
**by consensus among the government and opposition;
**by a constitutional council.

An alternative minimalist approach to change provides for removing the sovereign and retaining the Governor-General. The most notable model of this type is the McGarvie model, while Copernican models replace the monarch with a directly elected figurehead. These Copernican models allow for regular and periodic elections for the office of head of state while limiting the reserve powers to the appointed Governor-General only. A popularly elected head of state would have the same powers as the monarch, but he or she could not dismiss the prime minister. If this were to happen, it would be a first, as all other former Commonwealth realms have created presidencies upon becoming republics. Alternatively it has been proposed to abolish the roles of the Governor-General and the monarchy and have their functions exercised by other constitutional officers such as the speaker.

Another such model is the 50-50 model, created by government consultant and Labor member Anthony Cianflone. Under this model, an Australian president would be the head of state and elected by a combination of a joint sitting of Parliament and the public, with each have 50% of the vote. While having a similar role as the current governor-general, under this model the president would also act as the nation&#x27;s &quot;social conscience and moral compass&quot; by advocating for social issues. Additionally, a &quot;Social and Moral Conscience Charter&quot; is suggested, which the president could be empowered to require Parliament to consider regarding certain bills. Finally, an annual address to Parliament would also allow the president to lobby the Parliament on certain issues and help ensure consistency in policy making between governments.

Australians for Constitutional Monarchy and the Australian Monarchist League argue that no model is better than the present system and argue that the risk and difficulty of changing the constitution is best demonstrated by inability of republicans to back a definitive design.

===Process models===

From its foundation until the 1999 referendum, the Australian Republican Movement (ARM) supported the bi-partisan appointment model, which would result in a President elected by the Parliament of Australia, with the powers currently held by the Governor-General. It is argued that the requirement of a two-thirds majority in a vote of both houses of parliament would result in a bi-partisan appointment, preventing a party politician from becoming president.

In 2010, the ARM briefly proposed a non-binding plebiscite to decide the model, followed by a binding referendum to amend the Constitution, reflecting the model chosen. Opponents of holding non-binding plebiscites include monarchist David Flint, who described this process as &quot;inviting a vote of no confidence in one of the most successful constitutions in the world,&quot; and minimalist republican Greg Craven, who states &quot;a multi-option plebiscite inevitably will produce a direct election model, precisely for the reason that such a process favours models with shallow surface appeal and multiple flaws. Equally inevitably, such a model would be doomed at referendum.&quot; Since 2022, the ARM has supported the Australian Choice Model, which was developed after consultation with more than 10,000 Australians and drafted into detailed constitutional amendments with the support of ten constitutional law scholars. The model proposes that state, territory and Federal parliaments nominate a shortlist of candidates which are then put to a national vote. ARM research showed that this approach has significantly higher levels of support in the Australian community than direct election or parliamentary appointment models and would have the best prospects of success at a referendum.

==Public opinion==


Polls and surveys generate different responses depending on the wording of the questions, mostly in regards the type of republic, and often appear contradictory.

In 2009, the Australian Electoral Survey that is conducted following all elections by the Australian National University has found that support for a republic has remained reasonably static since 1987 at around 60%, if the type of republic is not part of the question. The survey also shows that support or opposition is relatively weak: 31% strongly support a republic while only 10% strongly oppose. Roy Morgan research has indicated that support for the monarchy has been supported by a majority of Australians since 2010, with support for a republic being in the majority between 1999 and 2004.

An opinion poll held in November 2008 that separated the questions found support for a republic at 50% with 28% opposed. Asked how the president should be chosen if there were to be a republic, 80 percent said elected by the people, against 12 percent who favoured appointment by parliament. In October 2009, another poll by UMR found 59% support for a republic and 33% opposition. 73% supported direct election, versus 18% support for parliamentary appointment.

On 29 August 2010, &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; published a poll produced by Neilson, asking multiple questions on the future of the monarchy:
*48% of the 1400 respondents were opposed to constitutional change (a rise of 8 per cent since 2008)
*44% supported change (a drop of 8 per cent since 2008).
But when asked which of the following statements best described their view:
*31% said Australia should never become a republic.
*29% said Australia should become a republic as soon as possible.
*34% said Australia should become a republic only after Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s reign ends.

A survey of 1,000 readers of &quot;The Sun-Herald&quot; and &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, published in &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; on 21 November 2010, found 68% of respondents were in favour of Australia becoming a republic, while 25% said it should not. More than half the respondents, 56%, said Australia should become a republic as soon as possible while 31% said it should happen after the Queen dies.

However, an opinion poll conducted in 2011 saw a sharp decline in the support for an Australian republic. The polling conducted by the Morgan Poll in May 2011 showed the support for the monarchy was now 55% (up 17% since 1999), whereas the support for a republic was at 34% (down 20%). The turnaround in support for a republic has been called the &quot;strange death of Australian republicanism&quot;.

The Australian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s &quot;Vote Compass&quot; during the 2013 Australian federal election found that 40.4% of respondents disagreed with the statement &quot;Australia should end the monarchy and become a republic&quot;, whilst 38.1% agreed (23.1% strongly agreed) and 21.5% were neutral. Support for a republic was highest among those with a left-leaning political ideology. Younger people had the highest rate for those neutral towards the statement (27.8%) with their support for strongly agreed the lowest of all age groups at 17.1%. Support for a republic was highest in the Australian Capital Territory and Victoria and lowest in Queensland and Western Australia. More men than women said they support a republic.

In early 2014, a ReachTEL poll of 2,146 Australian conducted just after Australia Day showed only 39.4% supported a republic with 41.6% opposed. Lowest support was in the 65+ year cohort followed by the 18–34-year cohort. Geoff Gallop, the then chairman of the Australian Republican Movement, said higher support for a republic among Generation X and baby boomer voters could be explained by them having participated in the 1999 referendum and remembering the 1975 constitutional crisis.

In April 2014, a poll found that &quot;support for an Australian republic has slumped to its lowest level in more than three decades&quot;; namely, on the eve of the visit to Australia by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and Prince George, 42% of those polled agreed with the statement that &quot;Australia should become a republic&quot;, whereas 51% opposed.

ARM commissioned a poll to be conducted by Essential Research from 5 to 8 November in 2015, asking &quot;When Prince Charles becomes King of Australia, will you support or oppose replacing the British monarch with an Australian citizen as Australia&#x27;s head of state?&quot; Of the 1008 participants, 51% said they would prefer an Australian head of state to &quot;King Charles&quot;, 27% opposed and 22% were undecided.

The Australian has polled the same question &quot;Are you personally in favour or against Australia becoming a republic?&quot; multiple times since 1999. After Australia Day 2016 they found 51% support. This level of support was similar to levels found between 1999 and 2003 by the same newspaper. Total against was 37% which was an increase over the rates polled in all previous polls other than 2011. Uncommitted at 12% was the lowest ever polled. However support for a republic was again lowest in the 18–34-year cohort.

In November 2018, Newspoll found support for a republic had collapsed to 40%. It was also the first time in their polling since the 1999 referendum that support for the monarchy was higher than a republic. A July 2020 YouGov poll found 62% of Australians believed Australia&#x27;s head of state should be an Australian, not Queen Elizabeth II. An Ipsos poll in January 2021 found support for a republic was 34%, the lowest since 1979. However, one conducted by Ipsos in December 2022 (after the death of the Queen) showed support for the republic had risen to 54% (see above reference.)

In October 2024, an opinion poll 
conducted by Roy Morgan, shortly after the King and Queen’s royal tour, showed a dramatic increase in support for the monarchy, with 57 per cent of respondents believing Australia should remain a monarchy.

==Party political positions==
===Summary===
Below is a table summarising the positions of political parties on the establishment of a republic.

===Liberal–National Coalition===
The Liberal Party espouses both conservative and classically liberal positions. It has no official position on the issue of monarchy, but both republicans and monarchists have held prominent positions within the party.

Proponents of republicanism in the Liberal Party include Malcolm Turnbull (a former prime minister, and Australian Republican Movement leader), former prime minister Malcolm Fraser, former opposition leader John Hewson, former premiers Gladys Berejiklian (of NSW), Mike Baird (of NSW) and Jeff Kennett (of Victoria), former deputy leader Julie Bishop, and former federal treasurers Joe Hockey and Peter Costello.

Supporters of the status quo include former prime ministers Scott Morrison, Tony Abbott (who led Australians for Constitutional Monarchy from 1992 to 1994), John Howard (whose government oversaw the 1999 referendum), current opposition leader Peter Dutton, and former opposition leaders Alexander Downer and Brendan Nelson.

The National Party officially supports the status quo, but there have been some republicans within the party, such as former leader Tim Fischer. The Country Liberal Party also supports the status quo, but some republicans have been members of the party, including former leader Gary Higgins.

Under then prime minister John Howard, a monarchist, the government initiated a process to settle the republican debate, involving a constitutional convention and a referendum. Howard says the matter was resolved by the failure of the referendum.

===Australian Labor Party===
The Labor Party has supported constitutional change to become a republic since 1991 and has incorporated republicanism into its platform. Labor has proposed a series of plebiscites to restart the republican process. Along with this, Labor spokesperson (and former federal attorney general) Nicola Roxon has previously said that reform will &quot;always fail if we seek to inflict a certain option on the public without their involvement. This time round, the people must shape the debate&quot;. In the 2019 federal election, Labor&#x27;s platform included a two-stage referendum on a republic to be held during the next parliamentary term; however, Labor was defeated in the election.

===Australian Greens===
The Australian Greens are a strong proponent for an Australian republic, and this is reflected in the Greens &quot;Constitutional Reform &amp; Democracy&quot; policy. In 2009, the Greens proposed legislation to hold a plebiscite on a republic at the 2010 federal election. The bill was subject to a Senate inquiry, which made no recommendation on the subject, and the proposal was subsequently dropped.

===Democrats===
The Australian Democrats, Australia&#x27;s third party from the 1970s until the 2000s, strongly supported a move towards a republic through a system of an elected head of state through popular voting.

<doc id="65837" wikidata="Q8251" url="?curid=65837" title="The Art of War">
<text>The Art of War is an ancient Chinese military treatise dating from the late Spring and Autumn period (roughly 5th century BC). The work, which is attributed to the ancient Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu (&quot;Master Sun&quot;), is composed of 13 chapters. Each one is devoted to a different set of skills or art related to warfare and how it applies to military strategy and tactics. For almost 1,500 years, it was the lead text in an anthology that was formalized as the Seven Military Classics by Emperor Shenzong of Song in 1080. &quot;The Art of War&quot; remains the most influential strategy text in East Asian warfare, has influenced both East Asian and Western military theory and thinking.

The book contains a detailed explanation and analysis of the 5th-century BC Chinese military, from weapons, environmental conditions, and strategy to rank and discipline. Sun also stressed the importance of intelligence operatives and espionage to the war effort. Considered one of history&#x27;s finest military tacticians and analysts, his teachings and strategies formed the basis of advanced military training throughout the world.

The book was translated into French and published in 1772 by the French priest Jesuit Jean Joseph Marie Amiot; it was re-published in 1782. A partial translation into English was attempted by British officer Everard Ferguson Calthrop in 1905 under the title &quot;The Book of War&quot;. The first annotated English translation was completed and published by Lionel Giles in 1910. Military and political leaders such as the Chinese communist revolutionary Mao Zedong, Japanese Takeda Shingen, and Vietnamese general Võ Nguyên Giáp are cited along with American military generals Douglas MacArthur and Norman Schwarzkopf Jr. as having drawn inspiration from the book.

==History==
===Text and commentaries===
&quot;The Art of War&quot; is traditionally attributed to an ancient Chinese military general known as Sun Tzu (pinyin: ), meaning &#x27;Master Sun&#x27;. Sun Tzu is said to have lived in the 6th century BC, but the earliest parts of &quot;The Art of War&quot; probably date to at least 100 years later.

Sima Qian&#x27;s &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;, the first of China&#x27;s 24 dynastic histories, records an early Chinese tradition that a text on military matters was written by one &quot;Sun Wu&quot; () from the State of Qi, and that this text had been read and studied by King Helü of Wu (). This text was traditionally identified with the received &quot;Master Sun&#x27;s Art of War&quot;. The conventional view was that Sun Wu was a military theorist from the end of the Spring and Autumn period (776–471 BC) who fled his home state of Qi to the southeastern Kingdom of Wu, where he is said to have impressed the king with his ability to quickly train even court women in military discipline and to have made Wu&#x27;s armies powerful enough to challenge their western rivals in the state of Chu. This view is still widely held in China.

The strategist, poet, and warlord Cao Cao in the early 3rd century AD authored the earliest known commentary to the &quot;Art of War&quot;. Cao&#x27;s preface makes clear that he edited the text and removed certain passages, but the extent of his changes were unclear historically. &quot;The Art of War&quot; appears throughout the bibliographical catalogs of the Chinese dynastic histories, but listings of its divisions and size varied widely.

===Authorship===

Beginning around the 12th century, Sun Tzu&#x27;s historical existence began to be questioned by Chinese scholars, primarily on the grounds that he is not mentioned in the historical classic &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot;, which mentions most of the notable figures from the Spring and Autumn period. The name &quot;Sun Wu&quot; () does not appear in any text prior to the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;, and has been suspected to be a made-up descriptive cognomen meaning &quot;the fugitive warrior&quot;, glossing the surname &quot;Sun&quot; as the related term &quot;fugitive&quot; ( ), while &quot;Wu&quot; ( ) is (1) the ancient Chinese virtue of &quot;martial, valiant&quot; and (2) a Jianghuai dialectal synonym of &quot;knight&quot;, which corresponds to Sunzi&#x27;s role as the hero&#x27;s doppelgänger in the story of Wu Zixu. In the early 20th century, the Chinese writer and reformer Liang Qichao theorized that the text was actually written in the 4th century BC by Sun Tzu&#x27;s purported descendant Sun Bin, as a number of historical sources mention a military treatise he wrote. Unlike Sun Wu, Sun Bin appears to have been an actual person who was a genuine authority on military matters, and may have been the inspiration for the creation of the historical figure &quot;Sun Tzu&quot; through a form of euhemerism.

In 1972, the Yinqueshan Han slips were discovered in two Han dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD) tombs near the city of Linyi in Shandong. Among the many bamboo slip writings contained in the tombs, which had been sealed between 134 and 118 BC, were two separate texts: one attributed to &quot;Sun Tzu&quot;, corresponding to the received text, and another attributed to Sun Bin, which explains and expands upon the earlier &quot;The Art of War&quot; by Sunzi. The Sun Bin text&#x27;s material overlaps with much of the &quot;Sun Tzu&quot; text, and the two may be &quot;a single, continuously developing intellectual tradition united under the Sun name&quot;. This discovery showed that much of the historical confusion was due to the fact that there were two texts that could have been referred to as &quot;Master Sun&#x27;s Art of War&quot;, not one. The content of the earlier text is about one-third of the chapters of the modern &quot;The Art of War&quot;, and their text matches very closely. It is now generally accepted that the earlier &quot;The Art of War&quot; was completed sometime between 500 and 430 BC.

==The 13 chapters==
&quot;The Art of War&quot; is divided into 13 chapters (or ); the collection is referred to as being one (&quot;whole&quot; or alternatively &quot;chronicle&quot;).

==Cultural influence==
=== Military and intelligence applications ===

Across East Asia, &quot;The Art of War&quot; was part of the syllabus for potential candidates of military service examinations.

During the Sengoku period (), the Japanese Takeda Shingen (1521–1573) is said to have become almost invincible in all battles without relying on guns, because he studied &quot;The Art of War&quot;. The book even gave him the inspiration for his famous battle standard (Wind, Forest, Fire and Mountain), meaning fast as the wind, silent as a forest, ferocious as fire and immovable as a mountain.

The translator Samuel B. Griffith offers a chapter on &quot;Sun Tzu and Mao Tse-Tung&quot; where &quot;The Art of War&quot; is cited as influencing Mao&#x27;s &quot;On Guerrilla Warfare&quot;, &quot;On the Protracted War&quot; and &quot;Strategic Problems of China&#x27;s Revolutionary War&quot;, and includes Mao&#x27;s quote: &quot;We must not belittle the saying in the book of Sun Wu Tzu, the great military expert of ancient China, &#x27;Know your enemy and know yourself and you can fight a thousand battles without disaster.&#x27;&quot;

During the Vietnam War, some Viet Cong officers extensively studied &quot;The Art of War&quot; and reportedly could recite entire passages from memory. General Võ Nguyên Giáp successfully implemented tactics described in &quot;The Art of War&quot; during the Battle of Dien Bien Phu ending major French involvement in Indochina and leading to the accords which partitioned Vietnam into North and South. General Giáp, later the main PVA military commander in the Vietnam War, was an avid student and practitioner of Sun Tzu&#x27;s ideas.

==== Outside East Asia ====
The United States&#x27; defeat in the Vietnam War, more than any other event, brought Sun Tzu to the attention of leaders of U.S. military theory. The Department of the Army in the United States, through its Command and General Staff College, lists &quot;The Art of War&quot; as one example of a book that may be kept at a military unit&#x27;s library. &quot;The Art of War&quot; is listed on the US Marine Corps Professional Reading Program (formerly known as the Commandant&#x27;s Reading List). It is recommended reading for all United States Military Intelligence personnel. &quot;The Art of War&quot; is also used as instructional material at the United States Military Academy (commonly known as West Point), in the course Military Strategy (470). It is also recommended reading for Officer cadets at the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst. Some notable military leaders have stated the following about Sun Tzu and &quot;The Art of War&quot;:

According to some authors, the strategy of deception from &quot;The Art of War&quot; was studied and widely used by the KGB: &quot;I will force the enemy to take our strength for weakness, and our weakness for strength, and thus will turn his strength into weakness&quot;.

===Application outside the military===
Some of the book&#x27;s admirers claim that it has a variety of applications in a myriad of competitive non-military endeavors across the modern world including espionage, culture, politics, business, and sports.

Some business books have claimed to see metaphorical parallels from The Art of War to office politics and corporate business strategy. Some Japanese companies make the book required reading for their key executives. Entrepreneurs and corporate executives have turned to it for inspiration and advice on how to succeed in competitive business situations. The book has also been applied to the field of education.

&quot;The Art of War&quot; has been the subject of legal books and legal articles on the trial process, including negotiation tactics and trial strategy.

The book &quot;The 48 Laws of Power&quot; by Robert Greene has many quotations from &quot;The Art of War&quot;.

&quot;The Art of War&quot; has also been applied in sports. National Football League coach Bill Belichick, record holder of the most Super Bowl wins in history, has stated on multiple occasions his admiration for &quot;The Art of War&quot;. Brazilian association football coach Luiz Felipe Scolari actively used &quot;The Art of War&quot; for Brazil&#x27;s successful 2002 World Cup campaign. During the tournament Scolari put passages of &quot;The Art of War&quot; underneath his players&#x27; doors at night.

&quot;Playing To Win&quot; by David Sirlin analyses applications of the ideas from &quot;The Art of War&quot; in modern esports. &quot;The Art of War&quot; was released in 2014 as an e-book companion alongside the Art of War DLC for Europa Universalis IV, a PC strategy game by Paradox Development Studios, with a foreword by Thomas Johansson.

===Film and television===
&quot;The Art of War&quot; and Sun Tzu have been referenced and quoted in many movies and television shows, including in the 1987 movie &quot;Wall Street&quot;, in which Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) frequently references it. The 20th &quot;James Bond&quot; film, &quot;Die Another Day&quot; (2002) also references &quot;The Art of War&quot; as the spiritual guide shared by Colonel Moon and his father. In &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, season 3, episode 8 (&quot;He Is Risen&quot;), Dr. Melfi suggests to Tony Soprano that he read the book.

In the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; first-season episode &quot;The Last Outpost&quot;, first officer William Riker quotes &quot;The Art of War&quot;: &quot;Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy&quot;. Captain Picard expressed pleasure that Sun Tzu was still taught at Starfleet Academy. Later in the episode, a survivor from a long-dead nonhuman empire noted common aspects between his own people&#x27;s wisdom and &quot;The Art of War&quot; with regard to knowing when and when not to fight.

&quot;The Art of War&quot; is a 2000 action spy film directed by Christian Duguay and starring Wesley Snipes, Michael Biehn, Anne Archer and Donald Sutherland.

<text>The International Air Transport Association (IATA ) is an airline trade association founded in 1945. IATA has been described as a cartel since, in addition to setting technical standards for airlines, IATA also organized tariff conferences that served as a forum for price fixing.

According to IATA, the trade association represents 317 airlines, including major carriers, from over 120 countries. The IATA&#x27;s member airlines account for carrying approximately 82% (2020) of total available seat miles air traffic. IATA supports airline activity and helps formulate industry policy and standards. It is headquartered in Montreal, Canada with executive offices in Geneva, Switzerland.

==History==
IATA was formed in April 1945 in Havana, Cuba. It is the successor to the International Air Traffic Association, which was formed in 1919 at The Hague, Netherlands. At its founding, IATA consisted of 57 airlines from 31 countries. Much of IATA&#x27;s early work was technical and IATA provided input to the newly created International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), which was reflected in the annexes of the Chicago Convention in 1944, the international treaty that still governs international air transport.

The Chicago Convention did not result in a consensus on the economic regulation of the airline industry. According to Warren Koffler, IATA was formed to fill the resulting void and provide international air carriers with a mechanism to fix prices.

In the late 1940s, IATA started holding conferences to fix prices for international air travel. IATA secretary J.G Gazdik stated that the organization aimed to fix prices at reasonable levels, with due regard being paid to the cost of operations, in order to ensure reasonable profits for airlines.

In 1947 at a time when many airlines were government-owned and loss-making, IATA operated as a cartel, charged by the governments with setting a constrained fare structure that avoided price competition. The first Traffic Conference was held in 1947 in Rio de Janeiro and reached unanimous agreement on some 400 resolutions. IATA Director-General William Hildred recounted that about 200 of the resolutions at the Rio de Janeiro conference were related to establishing a uniform structure for tariffs charged for international air transportation.

The American Civil Aeronautics Board did not intervene to stop IATA&#x27;s price fixing, and in 1954 law professor Louis B. Schwartz condemned the board&#x27;s inaction as an &quot;abdication of judicial responsibility&quot;. &quot;The Economist&quot; lambasted IATA&#x27;s connivance with governments to fix prices and compared IATA with medieval guilds.

In the early 1950s IATA&#x27;s price fixing regime forced airlines to attempt to differentiate themselves through the quality of their passenger experience. IATA responded by imposing strict limits on the quality of airline service. In 1958, IATA issued a formal ruling barring airlines from serving economy passengers sandwiches with &quot;luxurious&quot; ingredients. The economist Walter Adams observed that the limited service competition permitted by IATA tended to merely divert traffic from one air carrier to another without at the same time enlarging the overall air transport market.

From 1956 to 1975, IATA resolutions capped travel agent commissions at 7% of the airline ticket price. Legal scholar Kenneth Elzinga argued that IATA&#x27;s commission cap harmed consumers by decreasing the incentive for travel agents to offer improved service to consumers.

By the late 1970s, IATA&#x27;s price fixing regime was seen as unattractive by many airlines. As a result, major airlines, like Singapore Airlines and Pan-American Airlines, chose to forgo IATA membership.

===Market share===
In 1973, 94% of international scheduled passenger traffic flew on IATA carriers.

===Market control mechanism===
During its time as a cartel, IATA set the fares that IATA carriers charged and enforced them with quasi-governmental powers; it was backed by most relevant governments by making IATA fares a requirement of air service agreements between countries. In the case of the US, the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB, the now-defunct Federal agency that, at the time, regulated almost all US commercial air transport) also provided IATA with a waiver from US antitrust laws. Plus, most IATA airlines were majority government owned and even some privately-owned IATA members were under government control. The biggest non-IATA carriers, like Aeroflot, tended to nonetheless charge IATA fares, but a few, such as such as Loftleidir Icelandic, offered below-IATA prices.

===Charter competition===
The real competition to the IATA cartel system were the charter carriers, which in 1972 accounted for up to 28% of international traffic, with prices set by supply and demand. IATA &quot;special fares&quot; (discounts from standard fares) were mostly a reaction to charter competition. IATA competition with charter carriers was complex and to some degree hypocritical: some IATA carriers had non-IATA subsidiaries offering charters that IATA carriers could not, for example, Lufthansa&#x27;s Condor subsidiary or Air France&#x27;s Air Charter International.

===Illegal rebates===
IATA members engaging in illegal rebating on their IATA-set scheduled fares. In the early 1970s, there were a half billion dollars in annual illegal transatlantic scheduled fare rebates uncovered in a US Department of Justice investigation that resulted in fines and consent decrees from 19 airlines Pan Am, Trans World Airlines and most European flag carriers (e.g. Air France, Lufthansa, British Airways, KLM, etc). The investigation started when a travel agent was discovered entering the US with $80,000 hidden in his socks, which he admitted was a rebate.

In 1982, the sociologist John Hannigan described IATA as &quot;the world aviation cartel&quot;. IATA enjoyed immunity from antitrust law in several nations.

To prevent Laker Airways from disrupting IATA&#x27;s price fixing regime, IATA members allegedly used a 1977 to conspired to undercut prices on shared routes, seeking to bankrupt Freddie Laker&#x27;s airline. Laker Airways bankruptcy estate later asserted claims against IATA members under the American Sherman and Clayton antitrust acts.

In 2006, the United States Department of Justice adopted an order withdrawing the antitrust immunity of IATA tariff conferences.

In March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic interrupted routine flights around the world. In the immediate aftermath most airlines, because of the physical distancing policies implemented by national governments, reduced their seat loading by eliminating the sale of the middle seat in a row of three. This reduction averaged out to a load factor of 62% normal, well below the IATA industry break-even level of 77%. Fares would need to rise as much as 54% if a carrier were to break even, according to calculations done by the IATA, who posit that because of &quot;forward-facing seats that prevent face-to-face contact, and ceiling-to-floor air flows that limit the circulation of respiratory droplets&quot; the risk of transmission is reduced. North American carriers such as WestJet, Air Canada and American Airlines all planned to resume normal pattern sales on 1 July 2020. This industry-driven policy garnered immediate push-back from some Canadians, including those who felt defrauded, while Minister of Transport Marc Garneau noted that the &quot;on-board spacing requirement is a recommendation only and therefore not mandatory&quot; while his Transport Canada department listed physical distancing as a prophylactic among the key positive points in a guide prepared for the Canadian aviation industry.

==Focus areas==
===Safety===
IATA states that safety is its highest priority. The main instrument for safety is the IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA). IOSA has also been mandated at the state level by several countries. In 2017, aviation posted its safest year ever, surpassing the previous record set in 2012. The new global Western-built jet accident rate became the equivalent of one accident every 7.36 million flights. Future improvements will be founded on data sharing with a database fed by a multitude of sources and housed by the Global Safety Information Center. In June 2014, the IATA set up a special panel to study measures to track aircraft in flight in real time. The move was in response to the disappearance without a trace of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 on 8 March 2014.

===Simplifying the Business===
Simplifying the Business was launched in 2004. This initiative has introduced a number of crucial concepts to passenger travel, including the electronic ticket and the bar coded boarding pass. Many other innovations are being established as part of the Fast Travel initiative, including a range of self-service baggage options.

An innovative program, launched in 2012 is New Distribution Capability (NDC). This will replace the pre-Internet EDIFACT messaging standard, which is still the basis of the global distribution system and travel agent channel, with an XML standard. This will enable the same choices to be offered to high street travel shoppers as are offered to those who book directly through airline websites. A filing with the US Department of Transportation brought over 400 comments.

===Environment===
IATA members and all industry stakeholders have agreed to three sequential environmental goals:
# An average improvement in fuel efficiency of 1.5% per annum from 2009 through 2020
# A cap on net carbon emissions from aviation from 2020 (carbon-neutral growth)
# A 50% reduction in net aviation carbon emissions by 2050 relative to 2005 levels.

At the 2013 IATA annual general meeting in Cape Town, South Africa, members overwhelmingly endorsed a resolution on &quot;Implementation of the Aviation Carbon-Neutral Growth (CNG2020) Strategy.&quot; A representative for the European Federation for Transport and Environment criticized the resolution for relying on carbon offsets instead of direct reductions in aviation carbon emissions.

===Services===
IATA provides consulting and training services in many areas.

===Publications - standards===
A number of standards are defined under the umbrella of IATA. One of the most important is the IATA DGR for the transport of dangerous goods (HAZMAT) by air.

<doc id="65845" wikidata="Q16501" url="?curid=65845" title="Hypothyroidism">
<text>Hypothyroidism (also called &quot;underactive thyroid&quot;, &quot;low thyroid&quot; or &quot;hypothyreosis&quot;) is a disorder of the endocrine system in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormones. It can cause a number of symptoms, such as poor ability to tolerate cold, extreme fatigue, muscle aches, constipation, slow heart rate, depression, and weight gain. Occasionally there may be swelling of the front part of the neck due to goiter. Untreated cases of hypothyroidism during pregnancy can lead to delays in growth and intellectual development in the baby or congenital iodine deficiency syndrome.
Worldwide, too little iodine in the diet is the most common cause of hypothyroidism. Hashimoto&#x27;s thyroiditis is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in countries with sufficient dietary iodine. Less common causes include previous treatment with radioactive iodine, injury to the hypothalamus or the anterior pituitary gland, certain medications, a lack of a functioning thyroid at birth, or previous thyroid surgery. The diagnosis of hypothyroidism, when suspected, can be confirmed with blood tests measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine (T4) levels.
Salt iodization has prevented hypothyroidism in many populations. Thyroid hormone replacement with levothyroxine treats hypothyroidism. Medical professionals adjust the dose according to symptoms and normalization of the thyroxine and TSH levels. Thyroid medication is safe in pregnancy. Although an adequate amount of dietary iodine is important, too much may worsen specific forms of hypothyroidism.
Worldwide about one billion people are estimated to be iodine-deficient; however, it is unknown how often this results in hypothyroidism. In the United States, hypothyroidism occurs in approximately 5% of people. Subclinical hypothyroidism, a milder form of hypothyroidism characterized by normal thyroxine levels and an elevated TSH level, is thought to occur in 4.3–8.5% of people in the United States. Subclinical hypothyroidism has been associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) and is the most frequent thyroid abnormality in acute new-onset AF. Hypothyroidism is more common in women than in men. People over the age of 60 are more commonly affected. Dogs are also known to develop hypothyroidism, as are cats and horses, albeit more rarely. The word &quot;hypothyroidism&quot; is from Greek &quot;hypo-&quot; &#x27;reduced&#x27;, &quot;thyreos&quot; &#x27;shield&#x27;, and &quot;eidos&quot; &#x27;form&#x27;, where the two latter parts refer to the thyroid gland.
== Signs and symptoms ==
People with hypothyroidism often have no or only mild symptoms. Numerous symptoms and signs are associated with hypothyroidism and can be related to the underlying cause, or a direct effect of not having enough thyroid hormones. Hashimoto&#x27;s thyroiditis may present with the mass effect of a goiter (enlarged thyroid gland). In middle-aged women, the symptoms may be mistaken for those of menopause.


Delayed relaxation after testing the ankle jerk reflex is a characteristic sign of hypothyroidism and is associated with the severity of the hormone deficit.

===Myxedema coma===

Myxedema coma is a rare but life-threatening state of extreme hypothyroidism. It may occur in those with established hypothyroidism when they develop an acute illness. Myxedema coma can be the first presentation of hypothyroidism. People with myxedema coma typically have a low body temperature without shivering, confusion, a slow heart rate and reduced breathing effort. There may be physical signs suggestive of hypothyroidism, such as skin changes or enlargement of the tongue.

===Pregnancy===

Even mild or subclinical hypothyroidism leads to possible infertility and an increased risk of miscarriage. Hypothyroidism in early pregnancy, even with limited or no symptoms, may increase the risk of pre-eclampsia, offspring with lower intelligence, and the risk of infant death around the time of birth. Women are affected by hypothyroidism in 0.3–0.5% of pregnancies. Subclinical hypothyroidism during pregnancy is associated with gestational diabetes, low birth-weight, placental abruption, and the birth of the baby before 37 weeks of pregnancy.

===Children===
Newborn children with hypothyroidism may have normal birth weight and height (although the head may be larger than expected and the posterior fontanelle may be open). Some may have drowsiness, decreased muscle tone, poor weight gain, a hoarse-sounding cry, feeding difficulties, constipation, an enlarged tongue, umbilical hernia, dry skin, a decreased body temperature, and jaundice. A goiter is rare, although it may develop later in children who have a thyroid gland that does not produce functioning thyroid hormone. A goiter may also develop in children growing up in areas with iodine deficiency. Normal growth and development may be delayed, and not treating infants may lead to an intellectual impairment (IQ 6–15 points lower in severe cases). Other problems include the following: difficulty with large scale and fine motor skills and coordination, reduced muscle tone, squinting, decreased attention span, and delayed speaking. Tooth eruption may be delayed.

In older children and adolescents, the symptoms of hypothyroidism may include fatigue, cold intolerance, sleepiness, muscle weakness, constipation, a delay in growth, overweight for height, pallor, coarse and thick skin, increased body hair, irregular menstrual cycles in girls, and delayed puberty. Signs may include delayed relaxation of the ankle reflex and a slow heartbeat. A goiter may be present with a completely enlarged thyroid gland; sometimes only part of the thyroid is enlarged and it can be knobby.

==Causes==

Hypothyroidism is caused by inadequate function of the gland itself (primary hypothyroidism), inadequate stimulation by thyroid-stimulating hormone from the pituitary gland (secondary hypothyroidism), or inadequate release of thyrotropin-releasing hormone from the brain&#x27;s hypothalamus (tertiary hypothyroidism). Primary hypothyroidism is about a thousandfold more common than central hypothyroidism. Central hypothyroidism is the name used for secondary and tertiary hypothyroidism since the hypothalamus and pituitary gland are at the center of thyroid hormone control.

Iodine deficiency is the most common cause of primary hypothyroidism and endemic goiter worldwide. In areas of the world with sufficient dietary iodine, hypothyroidism is most commonly caused by the autoimmune disease Hashimoto&#x27;s thyroiditis (chronic autoimmune thyroiditis). Hashimoto&#x27;s may be associated with a goiter. It is characterized by infiltration of the thyroid gland with T lymphocytes and autoantibodies against specific thyroid antigens such as thyroid peroxidase, thyroglobulin and the TSH receptor.

A more uncommon cause of hypothyroidism is estrogen dominance. It is one of the most common hormone imbalance problems in women. Still, it is not always linked with hypothyroidism There are three different types of estrogens: estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), and estriol (E3), with estradiol being the most potent of the three Women with estrogen dominance have estradiol levels of 115 pg/ml on day 3 of their cycle. However, estrogen dominance is not just about an overabundance of estradiol but is more likely correlated with an imbalance between estradiol and progesterone. Women who have too much unopposed estrogen, which is estrogen that does not have enough counterbalancing progesterone in their bodies, commonly have unbalanced thyroid levels, in addition to excess growths within their uteri.

Estradiol disrupts thyroid hormone production because high blood levels of estrogen signal the liver to increase the production of thyroid-binding globulin (TBG). This is an inhibitor protein that binds to the thyroid hormone, reducing the amount of T3 and T4 available for use by cells. Without T3 and T4, the body&#x27;s cellular function begins to slow down.

After women give birth, about 5% develop postpartum thyroiditis which can occur up to nine months afterwards. This is characterized by a short period of hyperthyroidism followed by a period of hypothyroidism; 20–40% remain permanently hypothyroid.

Autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto&#x27;s) is associated with other immune-mediated diseases such as diabetes mellitus type 1, pernicious anemia, myasthenia gravis, celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. It may occur as part of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome (type 1 and type 2).

Iatrogenic hypothyroidism can be surgical (a result of thyroidectomy, usually for thyroid nodules or cancer) or following radioiodine ablation (usually for Graves&#x27; disease).

==Pathophysiology==
Thyroid hormone is required for the normal functioning of numerous tissues in the body. In healthy individuals, the thyroid gland predominantly secretes thyroxine (T4), which is converted into triiodothyronine (T3) in other organs by the selenium-dependent enzyme iodothyronine deiodinase. Triiodothyronine binds to the thyroid hormone receptor in the nucleus of cells, where it stimulates the turning on of particular genes and the production of specific proteins. Additionally, the hormone binds to integrin αvβ3 on the cell membrane, thereby stimulating the sodium–hydrogen antiporter and processes such as formation of blood vessels and cell growth. In blood, almost all thyroid hormone (99.97%) are bound to plasma proteins such as thyroxine-binding globulin; only the free unbound thyroid hormone is biologically active.

Electrocardiograms are abnormal in both primary overt hypothyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism. T3 and TSH are essential for the regulation of cardiac electrical activity. Prolonged ventricular repolarization and atrial fibrillation are often seen in hypothyroidism.

The thyroid gland is the only source of thyroid hormone in the body; the process requires iodine and the amino acid tyrosine. The gland takes up iodine in the bloodstream and incorporates it into thyroglobulin molecules. The process is controlled by the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH, thyrotropin), which is secreted by the pituitary. Not enough iodine, or not enough TSH, can decrease thyroid hormone production.

The hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis plays a key role in maintaining thyroid hormone levels within normal limits. Production of TSH by the anterior pituitary gland is stimulated in turn by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), released from the hypothalamus. Production of TSH and TRH is decreased by thyroxine by a negative feedback process. Not enough TRH, which is uncommon, can lead to insufficient TSH release and therefore insufficient thyroid hormone production.

Pregnancy leads to marked changes in thyroid hormone physiology. The gland increases in size by 10%, thyroxine production increases by 50%, and iodine requirements increase. Many women have normal thyroid function but have immunological evidence of thyroid autoimmunity (as evidenced by autoantibodies) or are iodine deficient, and develop evidence of hypothyroidism before or after giving birth.

==Diagnosis==
Laboratory testing of thyroid stimulating hormone levels in the blood is considered the best initial test for hypothyroidism; a second TSH level is often obtained several weeks later for confirmation. Levels may be abnormal in the context of other illnesses, and TSH testing in hospitalized people is discouraged unless thyroid dysfunction is strongly suspected as the cause of the acute illness. An elevated TSH level indicates that the thyroid gland is not producing enough thyroid hormone, and free T4 levels are then often obtained. Measuring T3 is discouraged by the AACE in the assessment for hypothyroidism. In England and Wales, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends routine T4 testing in children, and T3 testing in both adults and children if central hypothyroidism is suspected and the TSH is low. There are several symptom rating scales for hypothyroidism; they provide a degree of objectivity but have limited use for diagnosis.

Many cases of hypothyroidism are associated with mild elevations in creatine kinase and liver enzymes in the blood. They typically return to normal when hypothyroidism has been fully treated. Levels of cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein and lipoprotein (a) can be elevated; the impact of subclinical hypothyroidism on lipid parameters is less well-defined.

Very severe hypothyroidism and myxedema coma are characteristically associated with low sodium levels in the blood together with elevations in antidiuretic hormone, as well as acute worsening of kidney function due to several causes. For most causes, however, it is unclear if the relationship is causal.

A diagnosis of hypothyroidism without any lumps or masses felt within the thyroid gland does not require thyroid imaging; however, if the thyroid feels abnormal, diagnostic imaging is then recommended. The presence of antibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPO) makes it more likely that thyroid nodules are caused by autoimmune thyroiditis, but if there is any doubt, a needle biopsy may be required.

===Central===
If the TSH level is normal or low and serum free T4 levels are low, this is suggestive of central hypothyroidism (not enough TSH or TRH secretion by the pituitary gland or hypothalamus). There may be other features of hypopituitarism, such as menstrual cycle abnormalities and adrenal insufficiency. There might also be symptoms of a pituitary mass such as headaches and vision changes. Central hypothyroidism should be investigated further to determine the underlying cause.

===Overt===
In overt primary hypothyroidism, TSH levels are high and T4 and T3 levels are low. Overt hypothyroidism may also be diagnosed in those who have a TSH on multiple occasions of greater than 5mIU/L, appropriate symptoms, and only a borderline low T4. It may also be diagnosed in those with a TSH of greater than 10mIU/L.

===Subclinical===
Subclinical hypothyroidism is a biochemical diagnosis characterized by an elevated serum TSH level, but with a normal serum free thyroxine level. The incidence of subclinical hypothyroidism is estimated to be 3-15% and a higher incidence is seen in elderly people, females and those with lower iodine levels. Subclinical hypothyroidism is most commonly caused by autoimmune thyroid diseases, especially Hashimoto&#x27;s thyroiditis. The presentation of subclinical hypothyroidism is variable and classic signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism may not be observed. Of people with subclinical hypothyroidism, a proportion will develop overt hypothyroidism each year. In those with detectable antibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPO), this occurs in 4.3%, while in those with no detectable antibodies, this occurs in 2.6%. In addition to detectable anti-TPO antibodies, other risk factors for conversion from subclinical hypothyroidism to overt hypothyroidism include female sex or in those with higher TSH levels or lower level of normal free T4 levels. Those with subclinical hypothyroidism and detectable anti-TPO antibodies who do not require treatment should have repeat thyroid function tested more frequently (e.g. every 6 months) compared with those who do not have antibodies.

===Pregnancy===
During pregnancy, the thyroid gland must produce 50% more thyroid hormone to provide enough thyroid hormone for the developing fetus and the expectant mother. In pregnancy, free thyroxine levels may be lower than anticipated due to increased binding to thyroid binding globulin and decreased binding to albumin. They should either be corrected for the stage of pregnancy, or total thyroxine levels should be used instead for diagnosis. TSH values may also be lower than normal (particularly in the first trimester) and the normal range should be adjusted for the stage of pregnancy.

In pregnancy, subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as a TSH between 2.5 and 10 mIU/L with a normal thyroxine level, while those with TSH above 10 mIU/L are considered to be overtly hypothyroid even if the thyroxine level is normal. Antibodies against TPO may be important in making treatment decisions, and should, therefore, be determined in women with abnormal thyroid function tests.

Determination of TPO antibodies may be considered as part of the assessment of recurrent miscarriage, as subtle thyroid dysfunction can be associated with pregnancy loss, but this recommendation is not universal, and the presence of thyroid antibodies may not predict future outcomes.

==Prevention==

Hypothyroidism may be prevented in a population by adding iodine to commonly used foods. This public health measure has eliminated endemic childhood hypothyroidism in countries where it was once common. In addition to promoting the consumption of iodine-rich foods such as dairy and fish, many countries with moderate iodine deficiency have implemented universal salt iodization. Encouraged by the World Health Organization, 70% of the world&#x27;s population across 130 countries are receiving iodized salt. In some countries, iodized salt is added to bread. Despite this, iodine deficiency has reappeared in some Western countries due to attempts to reduce salt intake.

Pregnant and breastfeeding women, who require 66% more daily iodine than non-pregnant women, may still not be getting enough iodine. The World Health Organization recommends a daily intake of 250 μg for pregnant and breastfeeding women. As many women will not achieve this from dietary sources alone, the American Thyroid Association recommends a 150 μg daily supplement by mouth.

==Screening==
Screening for hypothyroidism is performed in the newborn period in many countries, generally using TSH. This has led to the early identification of many cases and thus the prevention of developmental delay. It is the most widely used newborn screening test worldwide. While TSH-based screening will identify the most common causes, the addition of T4 testing is required to pick up the rarer central causes of neonatal hypothyroidism. If T4 determination is included in the screening done at birth, this will identify cases of congenital hypothyroidism of central origin in 1:16,000 to 1:160,000 children. Considering that these children usually have other pituitary hormone deficiencies, early identification of these cases may prevent complications.

In adults, widespread screening of the general population is debated. Some organizations (such as the United States Preventive Services Task Force) state that evidence is insufficient to support routine screening, while others (such as the American Thyroid Association) recommend either intermittent testing above a certain age in all sexes or only in women. Targeted screening may be appropriate in a number of situations where hypothyroidism is common: other autoimmune diseases, a strong family history of thyroid disease, those who have received radioiodine or other radiation therapy to the neck, those who have previously undergone thyroid surgery, those with an abnormal thyroid examination, those with psychiatric disorders, people taking amiodarone or lithium, and those with a number of health conditions (such as certain heart and skin conditions). Yearly thyroid function tests are recommended in people with Down syndrome, as they are at higher risk of thyroid disease. Guidelines for England and Wales from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommend testing for thyroid disease in people with type 1 diabetes and new-onset atrial fibrillation, and suggests testing in those with depression or unexplained anxiety (all ages), in children with abnormal growth, or unexplained change in behavior or school performance. NICE also recommends screening for celiac disease in people with a diagnosis of autoimmune thyroid disease.

==Management==

=== Hormone replacement ===
Most people with hypothyroidism symptoms and confirmed thyroxine deficiency are treated with a synthetic long-acting form of thyroxine, known as levothyroxine (-thyroxine). In young and otherwise healthy people with overt hypothyroidism, a full replacement dose (adjusted by weight) can be started immediately; in the elderly and people with heart disease a lower starting dose is recommended to prevent over supplementation and risk of complications. Lower doses may be sufficient in those with subclinical hypothyroidism, while people with central hypothyroidism may require a higher than average dose.

Blood free thyroxine and TSH levels are monitored to help determine whether the dose is adequate. This is done 4–8 weeks after the start of treatment or a change in levothyroxine dose. Once the adequate replacement dose has been established, the tests can be repeated after 6 and then 12 months, unless there is a change in symptoms. Normalization of TSH does not mean that other abnormalities associated with hypothyroidism improve entirely, such as elevated cholesterol levels.

In people with central/secondary hypothyroidism, TSH is not a reliable marker of hormone replacement and decisions are based mainly on the free T4 level. Levothyroxine is best taken 30–60 minutes before breakfast, or four hours after food, as certain substances such as food and calcium can inhibit the absorption of levothyroxine. There is no direct way of increasing thyroid hormone secretion by the thyroid gland.

====Liothyronine====
Treatment with liothyronine (synthetic T3) alone has not received enough study to make a recommendation as to its use; due to its shorter half-life it would need to be taken more often than levothyroxine.

Adding liothyronine to levothyroxine has been suggested as a measure to provide better symptom control, but this has not been confirmed by studies. In 2007, the British Thyroid Association stated that combined T4 and T3 therapy carried a higher rate of side effects and no benefit over T4 alone. Similarly, American guidelines discourage combination therapy due to a lack of evidence, although they acknowledge that some people feel better when receiving combination treatment. Guidelines by NICE for England and Wales discourage liothyronine.

People with hypothyroidism who do not feel well despite optimal levothyroxine dosing may request adjunctive treatment with liothyronine. A 2012 guideline from the European Thyroid Association recommends that support should be offered concerning the chronic nature of the disease and that other causes of the symptoms should be excluded. The addition of liothyronine should be regarded as experimental, initially only for a trial period of 3 months, and in a set ratio to the current dose of levothyroxine. The guideline explicitly aims to enhance the safety of this approach and to counter its indiscriminate use.

====Desiccated animal thyroid====
Desiccated thyroid extract is an animal-based thyroid gland extract, most commonly from pigs. It is a combination therapy, containing forms of T4 and T3. It also contains calcitonin (a hormone produced in the thyroid gland involved in the regulation of calcium levels), T1 and T2; these are not present in synthetic hormone medication. This extract was once a mainstream hypothyroidism treatment, but its use today is unsupported by evidence; British Thyroid Association and American professional guidelines discourage its use, as does NICE.

===Subclinical hypothyroidism===
There is no evidence of a benefit from treating subclinical hypothyroidism in those who are not pregnant, and there are potential risks of overtreatment. Untreated subclinical hypothyroidism may be associated with a modest increase in the risk of coronary artery disease when the TSH is over 10 mIU/L. There may be an increased risk for cardiovascular death. A 2007 review found no benefit of thyroid hormone replacement except for &quot;some parameters of lipid profiles and left ventricular function&quot;. There is no association between subclinical hypothyroidism and an increased risk of bone fractures, nor is there a link with cognitive decline.

American guidelines recommend that treatment should be considered in people with symptoms of hypothyroidism, detectable antibodies against thyroid peroxidase, a history of heart disease, or are at an increased risk for heart disease if the TSH is elevated but below 10 mIU/L. American guidelines further recommend universal treatment (independent of risk factors) in those with TSH levels that are markedly elevated; above 10 mIU/L because of an increased risk of heart failure or death due to cardiovascular disease. NICE recommends that those with a TSH above 10 mIU/L should be treated in the same way as overt hypothyroidism. Those with an elevated TSH but below 10 mIU/L who have symptoms suggestive of hypothyroidism should have a trial of treatment but intend to stop this if the symptoms persist despite normalization of the TSH.

===Myxedema coma===
Myxedema coma or severe decompensated hypothyroidism usually requires admission to the intensive care, close observation and treatment of abnormalities in breathing, temperature control, blood pressure, and sodium levels. Mechanical ventilation may be required, as well as fluid replacement, vasopressor agents, careful rewarming, and corticosteroids (for possible adrenal insufficiency which can occur together with hypothyroidism). Careful correction of low sodium levels may be achieved with hypertonic saline solutions or vasopressin receptor antagonists. For rapid treatment of hypothyroidism, levothyroxine or liothyronine may be administered intravenously, particularly if the level of consciousness is too low to be able to safely swallow medication. While administration through a nasogastric tube is possible, this may be unsafe and is discouraged.

===Pregnancy===
In women with known hypothyroidism who become pregnant, it is recommended that serum TSH levels are closely monitored. Levothyroxine should be used to keep TSH levels within the normal range for that trimester. The first-trimester normal range is below 2.5 mIU/L and the second and third trimesters normal range is below 3.0 mIU/L. Treatment should be guided by total (rather than free) thyroxine or by the free T4 index. Similarly to TSH, the thyroxine results should be interpreted according to the appropriate reference range for that stage of pregnancy. The levothyroxine dose often needs to be increased after pregnancy is confirmed, although this is based on limited evidence and some recommend that it is not always required; decisions may need to based on TSH levels.

Women with anti-TPO antibodies who are trying to become pregnant (naturally or by assisted means) may require thyroid hormone supplementation even if the TSH level is normal. This is particularly true if they have had previous miscarriages or have been hypothyroid in the past. Supplementary levothyroxine may reduce the risk of preterm birth and possibly miscarriage. The recommendation is stronger in pregnant women with subclinical hypothyroidism (defined as TSH 2.5–10 mIU/L) who are anti-TPO positive, in view of the risk of overt hypothyroidism. If a decision is made not to treat, close monitoring of the thyroid function (every 4 weeks in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy) is recommended. If anti-TPO is not positive, treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism is not currently recommended. It has been suggested that many of the aforementioned recommendations could lead to unnecessary treatment, in the sense that the TSH cutoff levels may be too restrictive in some ethnic groups; there may be little benefit from treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism in certain cases.

=== Alternative medicine ===
The effectiveness and safety of using Chinese herbal medicines to treat hypothyroidism is not known.

==Epidemiology==
Hypothyroidism is the most frequent endocrine disorder. Worldwide about one billion people are estimated to be iodine deficient; however, it is unknown how often this results in hypothyroidism. In large population-based studies in Western countries with sufficient dietary iodine, 0.3–0.4% of the population have overt hypothyroidism. A larger proportion, 4.3–8.5%, have subclinical hypothyroidism. Undiagnosed hypothyroidism is estimated to affect about 4–7% of community-derived populations in the US and Europe. Of people with subclinical hypothyroidism, 80% have a TSH level below the 10 mIU/L mark regarded as the threshold for treatment. Children with subclinical hypothyroidism often return to normal thyroid function, and a small proportion develops overt hypothyroidism (as predicted by evolving antibody and TSH levels, the presence of celiac disease, and the presence of a goiter).

Women are more likely to develop hypothyroidism than men. In population-based studies, women were seven times more likely than men to have TSH levels above 10 mU/L. 2–4% of people with subclinical hypothyroidism will progress to overt hypothyroidism each year. The risk is higher in those with antibodies against thyroid peroxidase. Subclinical hypothyroidism is estimated to affect approximately 2% of children; in adults, subclinical hypothyroidism is more common in the elderly, and in White people. There is a much higher rate of thyroid disorders, the most common of which is hypothyroidism, in individuals with Down syndrome and Turner syndrome.

Very severe hypothyroidism and myxedema coma are rare, with it estimated to occur in 0.22 per million people a year. The majority of cases occur in women over 60 years of age, although it may happen in all age groups.

Most hypothyroidism is primary in nature. Central/secondary hypothyroidism affects 1:20,000 to 1:80,000 of the population or about one out of every thousand people with hypothyroidism.

==History==
In 1811, Bernard Courtois discovered iodine was present in seaweed, and iodine intake was linked with goiter size in 1820 by Jean-Francois Coindet. Gaspard Adolphe Chatin proposed in 1852 that endemic goiter was the result of not enough iodine intake, and Eugen Baumann demonstrated iodine in thyroid tissue in 1896.

The first cases of myxedema were recognized in the mid-19th century (the 1870s), but its connection to the thyroid was not discovered until the 1880s when myxedema was observed in people following the removal of the thyroid gland (thyroidectomy). The link was further confirmed in the late 19th century when people and animals who had had their thyroid removed showed improvement in symptoms with transplantation of animal thyroid tissue. The severity of myxedema, and its associated risk of mortality and complications, created interest in discovering effective treatments for hypothyroidism. Transplantation of thyroid tissue demonstrated some efficacy, but recurrences of hypothyroidism was relatively common, and sometimes required multiple repeat transplantations of thyroid tissue.

In 1891, the English physician George Redmayne Murray introduced subcutaneously injected sheep thyroid extract, followed shortly after by an oral formulation. Purified thyroxine was introduced in 1914 and in the 1930s synthetic thyroxine became available, although desiccated animal thyroid extract remained widely used. Liothyronine was identified in 1952.

Early attempts at titrating therapy for hypothyroidism proved difficult. After hypothyroidism was found to cause a lower basal metabolic rate, this was used as a marker to guide adjustments in therapy in the early 20th century (around 1915). However, a low basal metabolic rate was known to be non-specific, also present in malnutrition. The first laboratory test to help assess thyroid status was the serum protein-bound iodine, which came into use around the 1950s.

In 1971, the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) radioimmunoassay was developed, which was the most specific marker for assessing thyroid status in patients. Many people who were being treated based on basal metabolic rate, minimizing hypothyroid symptoms, or based on serum protein-bound iodine, were found to have excessive thyroid hormone. The following year, in 1972, a T3 radioimmunoassay was developed, and in 1974, a T4 radioimmunoassay was developed.

==Other animals==
In veterinary practice, dogs are the species most commonly affected by hypothyroidism. The majority of cases occur as a result of primary hypothyroidism, of which two types are recognized: lymphocytic thyroiditis, which is probably immune-driven and leads to destruction and fibrosis of the thyroid gland, and idiopathic atrophy, which leads to the gradual replacement of the gland by fatty tissue. There is often lethargy, cold intolerance, exercise intolerance, and weight gain. Furthermore, skin changes and fertility problems are seen in dogs with hypothyroidism, as well as many other symptoms. The signs of myxedema can be seen in dogs, with prominence of skin folds on the forehead, and cases of myxedema coma are encountered. The diagnosis can be confirmed by a blood test, as the clinical impression alone may lead to overdiagnosis. Lymphocytic thyroiditis is associated with detectable antibodies against thyroglobulin, although they typically become undetectable in advanced disease. Treatment is with thyroid hormone replacement.

Other species that are less commonly affected include cats and horses, as well as other large domestic animals. In cats, hypothyroidism is usually the result of other medical treatments such as surgery or radiation. In young horses, congenital hypothyroidism has been reported predominantly in Western Canada and has been linked with the mother&#x27;s diet.

<doc id="65847" wikidata="Q180152" url="?curid=65847" title="Vitiligo">
<text>Vitiligo (, ) is a chronic autoimmune disorder that causes patches of skin to lose pigment or color. The cause of vitiligo is unknown, but it may be related to immune system changes, genetic factors, stress, or sun exposure. Treatment options include topical medications, light therapy, surgery and cosmetics. The condition can show up on any skin type as a light peachy color and can appear on any place on the body in all sizes. The spots on the skin known as vitiligo are also able to “change” as spots lose and regain pigment; they will stay in relatively the same areas but can move over time and some big patches can move through the years but never disappear overnight.


== Signs and symptoms ==

The only sign of vitiligo is the presence of pale patchy areas of depigmented skin which tend to occur on the extremities. Some people may experience itching before a new patch appears. The patches are initially small, but often grow and change shape. When skin lesions occur, they are most prominent on the face, hands and wrists. The loss of skin pigmentation is particularly noticeable around body orifices, such as the mouth, eyes, nostrils, genitalia and umbilicus. Some lesions have increased skin pigment around the edges. Those affected by vitiligo who are stigmatized for their condition may experience depression and similar mood disorders.
==Causes==
Although multiple hypotheses have been suggested as potential triggers that cause vitiligo, studies strongly imply that changes in the immune system are responsible for the condition. Vitiligo has been proposed to be a multifactorial disease with genetic susceptibility and environmental factors both thought to play a role. It is hypothesized that damaging environmental factors can disrupt redox reactions necessary for protein folding, so skin cells may initiate the unfolded protein response which releases cytokines, thus mounting an immune response. 

The National Institutes of Health states that sometimes an event, like a sunburn, emotional distress, or exposure to a chemical, can trigger or exacerbate the condition, Skin depigmentation in particular areas in vitiligo can also be triggered by mechanical trauma: this is an example of the Koebner phenomenom. Unlike in other skin diseases, this can be caused by daily activities, especially chronic friction on particular areas of the body.

=== Immune ===
Melanin is the pigment that gives skin its color; it is produced by skin cells called melanocytes.

Variations in genes that are part of the immune system or part of melanocytes have both been associated with vitiligo. It is also thought to be caused by the immune system attacking and destroying the melanocytes of the skin. A genome wide association study found approximately 36 independent susceptibility loci for generalized vitiligo.

The TYR gene encodes the protein tyrosinase, which is not a component of the immune system but is an enzyme of the melanocyte that catalyzes melanin biosynthesis, and a major autoantigen in generalized vitiligo.

=== Autoimmune associations ===
Vitiligo is sometimes associated with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as Hashimoto&#x27;s thyroiditis, scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, psoriasis, Addison&#x27;s disease, pernicious anemia, alopecia areata, systemic lupus erythematosus, and celiac disease.

Among the inflammatory products of NLRP1 are caspase 1 and caspase 7, which activate the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β. Interleukin-1β and interleukin-18 are expressed at high levels in people with vitiligo. In one of the mutations, the amino acid leucine in the NALP1 protein was replaced by histidine (Leu155 → His). The original protein and sequence is highly conserved in evolution, and is found in humans, chimpanzees, rhesus monkeys, and bush babies. Addison&#x27;s disease (typically an autoimmune destruction of the adrenal glands) may also be seen in individuals with vitiligo.

=== Oxidative stress ===
Numerous whole-exome sequencing studies have demonstrated that vitiligo is associated with polymorphisms in genes involved in the response to oxidative stress such as CAT, SOD1, SOD2, SOD3, NFE2L2, HMOX1, GST-M1 or GST-T1 supporting the association of elevated levels of reactive oxygen species in melanocytes with the induction of an auto-immune response.

Thus, diseases presenting with altered mitochondrial function such as MELAS, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome and Kabuki syndrome are associated with increased risk of vitiligo.

In line with these observations, genetic alterations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of melanocytes associated with altered mitochondrial function lead to a release of mtDNA that can be detected in the skin of vitiligo patients. This mtDNA can be sensed by the cGAS-STING pathway resulting in pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokines production promoting the recruitment of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. The use of mitochondrial antioxidants, NRF2 inhibitors, and TBK1 inhibitors is emerging as potential therapeutic options to block this cascade of events.

== Diagnosis ==
An ultraviolet light can be used in the early phase of this disease for identification and to determine the effectiveness of treatment. Using a Wood&#x27;s light, skin will change colour (fluoresce) when it is affected by certain bacteria, fungi, and changes to pigmentation of the skin.

=== Classification ===

Classification attempts to quantify vitiligo have been analyzed as being somewhat inconsistent, while recent consensus has agreed to a system of segmental vitiligo (SV) and non-segmental vitiligo (NSV). NSV is the most common type of vitiligo.

==== Non-segmental ====
In non-segmental vitiligo (NSV), there is usually some form of symmetry in the location of the patches of depigmentation. New patches also appear over time and can be generalized over large portions of the body or localized to a particular area. Extreme cases of vitiligo, to the extent that little pigmented skin remains, are referred to as &quot;vitiligo universalis&quot;. NSV can come about at any age (unlike segmental vitiligo, which is far more prevalent in teenage years).

Classes of non-segmental vitiligo include the following:

* Generalized vitiligo: the most common pattern, wide and randomly distributed areas of depigmentation
* Universal vitiligo: depigmentation encompasses most of the body
* Focal vitiligo: one or a few scattered macules in one area, most common in children
* Acrofacial vitiligo: fingers and periorificial areas
* Mucosal vitiligo: depigmentation of only the mucous membranes

==== Segmental ====

Segmental vitiligo (SV) differs in appearance, cause, and frequency of associated illnesses. Its treatment is different from that of NSV. It tends to affect areas of skin that are associated with dorsal roots from the spinal cord and is most often unilateral. It is much more stable/static in its course and its association with autoimmune diseases appears to be weaker than that of generalized vitiligo. SV does not improve with topical therapies or UV light; however, surgical treatments such as cellular grafting can be effective.

=== Differential diagnosis ===
Chemical leukoderma is a similar condition due to multiple exposures to chemicals. Vitiligo however is a risk factor. Triggers may include inflammatory skin conditions, burns, intralesional steroid injections, and abrasions.

Other conditions with similar symptoms include the following:

* albinism
* halo nevus
* idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis (white sunspots)
* piebaldism
* pityriasis alba
* postinflammatory hypopigmentation
* primary adrenal insufficiency
* progressive macular hypomelanosis
* tinea versicolor
* tuberculoid leprosy

== Treatment ==
There is no cure for vitiligo but several treatment options are available. The best evidence is for applied steroids and ultraviolet light in combination with creams. Due to the higher risks of skin cancer, the United Kingdom&#x27;s National Health Service suggests phototherapy be used only if primary treatments are ineffective. Lesions located on the hands, feet, and joints are the most difficult to repigment; those on the face are easiest to return to the natural skin color as the skin is thinner.

=== Immune mediators ===
Topical preparations of immune-suppressing medications including glucocorticoids (such as 0.05% clobetasol or 0.10% betamethasone) and calcineurin inhibitors (such as tacrolimus or pimecrolimus) are considered to be first-line vitiligo treatments.

In July 2022, ruxolitinib cream (sold under the brand name Opzelura) was approved for medical use in the United States for the treatment of vitiligo.

=== Phototherapy ===
Phototherapy is considered a second-line treatment for vitiligo. Exposing the skin to light from UVB lamps is the most common treatment for vitiligo. The treatments can be done at home with a UVB lamp or in a clinic. The exposure time is managed so that the skin does not suffer overexposure. Treatment can take a few weeks if the spots are on the neck and face and if they existed not more than 3 years. If the spots are on the hands and legs and have been there for more than 3 years, it can take a few months. Phototherapy sessions are done 2–3 times a week. Spots on a large area of the body may require full-body treatment in a clinic or hospital. UVB broadband and narrowband lamps can be used, but narrowband ultraviolet peaked around 311 nm is the choice. It has been constitutively reported that a combination of UVB phototherapy with other topical treatments improves re-pigmentation. However, some people with vitiligo may not see any changes to skin or re-pigmentation occurring. A serious potential side effect involves the risk of developing skin cancer, the same risk as an overexposure to natural sunlight.

Ultraviolet light (UVA) treatments are normally carried out in a hospital clinic. Psoralen and ultraviolet A light (PUVA) treatment involves taking a drug that increases the skin&#x27;s sensitivity to ultraviolet light and then exposing the skin to high doses of UVA light. Treatment is required twice a week for 6–12 months or longer. Because of the high doses of UVA and psoralen, PUVA may cause side effects such as sunburn-type reactions or skin freckling.

Narrowband ultraviolet B (NBUVB) phototherapy lacks the side effects caused by psoralens and is as effective as PUVA. As with PUVA, treatment is carried out twice weekly in a clinic or every day at home, and there is no need to use psoralen. Longer treatment is often recommended, and at least 6 months may be required for effects to phototherapy. NBUVB phototherapy appears better than PUVA therapy with the most effective response on the face and neck.

With respect to improved repigmentation: topical calcineurin inhibitors plus phototherapy are better than phototherapy alone, hydrocortisone plus laser light is better than laser light alone, ginkgo biloba is better than placebo, and oral mini-pulse of prednisolone (OMP) plus NB-UVB is better than OMP alone.

=== Skin camouflage ===
In mild cases, vitiligo patches can be hidden with makeup or other cosmetic camouflage solutions. If the affected person is pale-skinned, the patches can be made less visible by avoiding tanning of unaffected skin.

=== Depigmenting ===
In cases of extensive vitiligo the option to depigment the unaffected skin with topical drugs like monobenzone, mequinol, or hydroquinone may be considered to render the skin an even color. The removal of all the skin pigment with monobenzone is permanent and vigorous. Sun safety must be adhered to for life to avoid severe sunburn and melanomas. Depigmentation takes about a year to complete.

== History ==
Descriptions of a disease believed to be vitiligo date back to a passage in the medical text Ebers Papyrus in ancient Egypt. Also, the Hebrew word &quot;Tzaraath&quot; from the Old Testament book of Leviticus dating to 1280 BC (or 1312 BC) described a group of skin diseases associated with white spots, and a subsequent translation to Greek led to continued conflation of those with vitiligo with leprosy and spiritual uncleanliness.

Medical sources in the ancient world such as Hippocrates often did not differentiate between vitiligo and leprosy, often grouping these diseases together. The name &quot;vitiligo&quot; was first used by the Roman physician Aulus Cornelius Celsus in his classic medical text &quot;De Medicina&quot;.

The term &quot;vitiligo&quot; is believed to be derived from &quot;vitium&quot;, meaning &quot;defect&quot; or &quot;blemish&quot;.

==Society and culture==

The change in appearance caused by vitiligo can affect a person&#x27;s emotional and psychological well-being and may create difficulty in becoming or remaining employed, particularly if vitiligo develops on visible areas of the body, such as the face, hands or arms. Participating in a vitiligo support group may improve social coping skills and emotional resilience.

=== Notable people with vitiligo ===
Notable cases include American pop singer Michael Jackson, Canadian fashion model Winnie Harlow, New Zealand singer-songwriter Kimbra, American actor David Dastmalchian and Argentine musician Charly García. Professional wrestler Bryan Danielson and French actor Michaël Youn are also affected, as is former French Prime Minister Édouard Philippe, Miss Universe Egypt 2024 Logina Salah, former Roman Catholic priest, Governor of Pampanga and TV host Eddie Panlilio, and model and former Miss Colombia 2007 Taliana Vargas.

=== In popular culture ===
The Adult Swim animated sitcom &quot;The Boondocks&quot; satirizes the idea of vitiligo in Uncle Ruckus, one of the show&#x27;s characters. Ruckus, who is black, frequently claims to be white, often stating that he has &quot;Re-vitiligo, the opposite of what Michael Jackson had.&quot; He frequently uses this argument to maintain that he is actually white, leading him to commit delusional and racist antics in nearly every episode.

== Research ==
, afamelanotide is in phase II and III clinical trials for vitiligo and other skin diseases.

A medication for rheumatoid arthritis, tofacitinib, has been tested for the treatment of vitiligo.

In October 1992, a scientific report was published of successfully transplanting melanocytes to vitiligo-affected areas, effectively repigmenting the region. The procedure involved taking a thin layer of pigmented skin from the person&#x27;s gluteal region. Melanocytes were then separated out to a cellular suspension that was expanded in culture. The area to be treated was then denuded with a dermabrader and the melanocytes graft applied. Between 70 and 85 percent of people with vitiligo experienced nearly complete repigmentation of their skin. The longevity of the repigmentation differed from person to person.
Current research suggests that the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of the transcription pathway (JAK/STAT pathway) plays a crucial role in the loss of epidermal melanocytes. This pathway is activated by CXCR3+ CD8+ T cells, creating a positive feedback loop with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) chemokines from keratinocytes, potentially contributing to vitiligo. JAK inhibitors like ruxolitinib show promise in targeting the IFN-γ-chemokine signaling axis implicated in vitiligo pathogenesis, and improving nonsegmental vitiligo.

<text>Idiopathic hypoglycemia is a medical condition in which the glucose level in the blood (blood glucose) is abnormally low due to an undeterminable cause. This is considered an incomplete and unsatisfactory diagnosis by physicians and is rarely used by endocrinologists, as it implies an unfinished diagnostic evaluation. In general, the more severe the hypoglycemia and the more clearly it is proven, the less likely it is to remain &quot;idiopathic&quot;. &quot;Idiopathic hypoglycemia&quot; can also be a synonym for reactive hypoglycemia or for hypoglycemia that is not diagnosed by a physician and does not fulfill the Whipple triad criteria. A more precise term for that condition is idiopathic postprandial syndrome.

<text>Eliezer S. Yudkowsky ( ; born September 11, 1979) is an American artificial intelligence researcher and writer on decision theory and ethics, best known for popularizing ideas related to friendly artificial intelligence. He is the founder of and a research fellow at the Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI), a private research nonprofit based in Berkeley, California. His work on the prospect of a runaway intelligence explosion influenced philosopher Nick Bostrom&#x27;s 2014 book &quot;&quot;.

==Work in artificial intelligence safety==
===Goal learning and incentives in software systems===
Yudkowsky&#x27;s views on the safety challenges future generations of AI systems pose are discussed in Stuart Russell&#x27;s and Peter Norvig&#x27;s undergraduate textbook &quot;Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach&quot;. Noting the difficulty of formally specifying general-purpose goals by hand, Russell and Norvig cite Yudkowsky&#x27;s proposal that autonomous and adaptive systems be designed to learn correct behavior over time:

In response to the instrumental convergence concern, that autonomous decision-making systems with poorly designed goals would have default incentives to mistreat humans, Yudkowsky and other MIRI researchers have recommended that work be done to specify software agents that converge on safe default behaviors even when their goals are misspecified.

===Capabilities forecasting===
In the intelligence explosion scenario hypothesized by I. J. Good, recursively self-improving AI systems quickly transition from subhuman general intelligence to superintelligent. Nick Bostrom&#x27;s 2014 book &quot;&quot; sketches out Good&#x27;s argument in detail, while citing Yudkowsky on the risk that anthropomorphizing advanced AI systems will cause people to misunderstand the nature of an intelligence explosion. &quot;AI might make an &quot;apparently&quot; sharp jump in intelligence purely as the result of anthropomorphism, the human tendency to think of &#x27;village idiot&#x27; and &#x27;Einstein&#x27; as the extreme ends of the intelligence scale, instead of nearly indistinguishable points on the scale of minds-in-general.&quot;

In &quot;Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach&quot;, Russell and Norvig raise the objection that there are known limits to intelligent problem-solving from computational complexity theory; if there are strong limits on how efficiently algorithms can solve various tasks, an intelligence explosion may not be possible.

=== &quot;Time&quot; op-ed ===
In a 2023 op-ed for &quot;Time&quot; magazine, Yudkowsky discussed the risk of artificial intelligence and proposed action that could be taken to limit it, including a total halt on the development of AI, or even &quot;destroy[ing] a rogue datacenter by airstrike&quot;. The article helped introduce the debate about AI alignment to the mainstream, leading a reporter to ask President Joe Biden a question about AI safety at a press briefing.

==Rationality writing==
Between 2006 and 2009, Yudkowsky and Robin Hanson were the principal contributors to &quot;Overcoming Bias&quot;, a cognitive and social science blog sponsored by the Future of Humanity Institute of Oxford University. In February 2009, Yudkowsky founded &quot;LessWrong&quot;, a &quot;community blog devoted to refining the art of human rationality&quot;. &quot;Overcoming Bias&quot; has since functioned as Hanson&#x27;s personal blog.

Over 300 blog posts by Yudkowsky on philosophy and science (originally written on &quot;LessWrong&quot; and &quot;Overcoming Bias&quot;) were released as an ebook, &quot;Rationality: From AI to Zombies&quot;, by MIRI in 2015. MIRI has also published &quot;Inadequate Equilibria&quot;, Yudkowsky&#x27;s 2017 ebook on societal inefficiencies.

Yudkowsky has also written several works of fiction. His fanfiction novel &quot;Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality&quot; uses plot elements from J. K. Rowling&#x27;s &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series to illustrate topics in science and rationality. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; described &quot;Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality&quot; as a retelling of Rowling&#x27;s original &quot;in an attempt to explain Harry&#x27;s wizardry through the scientific method&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Yudkowsky is an autodidact and did not attend high school or college. He was raised as a Modern Orthodox Jew, but does not identify religiously as a Jew.

<doc id="65861" wikidata="Q23114" url="?curid=65861" title="Lu Xun">
<text>Lu Xun (, ; 25 September 188119 October 1936), born Zhou Zhangshou, was a Chinese writer, literary critic, lecturer, and state servant. He was a leading figure of modern Chinese literature. Writing in vernacular and Literary Chinese, he was a short story writer, editor, translator, literary critic, essayist, poet, and designer. In the 1930s, he became the titular head of the League of Left-Wing Writers in Shanghai during republican-era China (1912–1949).

Lu Xun was born into a family of landlords and government officials in Shaoxing, Zhejiang; the family&#x27;s financial resources declined over the course of his youth. Lu aspired to take the imperial examinations, but due to his family&#x27;s relative poverty he was forced to attend government-funded schools teaching &quot;foreign education&quot;. Upon graduation, Lu studied medicine at Tohoku University in Japan, but later dropped out. He became interested in studying literature but was eventually forced to return to China because of his family&#x27;s lack of funds. After returning to China, Lu worked for several years teaching at local secondary schools and colleges before finally finding an office at the Republic of China Ministry of Education.

Following the May Fourth Movement in 1919, Lu&#x27;s writing began to exert a substantial influence on Chinese literature and popular culture. Like many of the movement&#x27;s leaders, Lu was a leftist. After the proclamation of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) in 1949, his work received considerable acclaim from the Chinese government, with Mao Zedong being an admirer of Lu&#x27;s writing throughout his life. Though he was sympathetic to socialist ideas, Lu never joined the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Lu Xun was born in Shaoxing, Zhejiang. As was common before the 20th century, Lu used several names. His birth name was &quot;Zhou Zhangshou&quot; (). His courtesy name was &quot;Yushan&quot; (), which he later changed to &quot;Yucai&quot; (). In 1898, before he went to the Jiangnan Naval Academy, he took the given name &quot;Shuren&quot; (), which figuratively means &quot;to be an educated man&quot;. The name &quot;Lu Xun&quot;, by which he is most well known internationally, was a pen name chosen upon the initial publishing of his story &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot; in 1918.

By the time Lu Xun was born, the Zhou family had been prosperous for centuries, and had become wealthy through landowning, pawnbroking, and by having several family members promoted to government positions. His paternal grandfather, Zhou Fuqing, was appointed to the Imperial Hanlin Academy in Beijing, the highest position possible for aspiring civil servants at that time.

Zhou&#x27;s mother was a member of the same landed gentry class as Lu Xun&#x27;s father, from a slightly smaller town in the countryside (Anqiaotou, Zhejiang; a part of Tongxiang). Because formal education was not considered socially appropriate for girls, she had not received any education, but she still taught herself how to read and write. The surname Lu () was the same as his mother&#x27;s.

Lu&#x27;s early education was based on the Confucian classics, in which he studied poetry, history, and philosophy—subjects which, he later reflected, were neither useful nor interesting to him. Instead, he enjoyed folk stories and opera, including the mythological narratives of the &quot;Classic of Mountains and Seas&quot; and the ghost stories told to him by a servant when he was a child.

By the time Lu was born, his family&#x27;s prosperity had already been declining. His father, Zhou Boyi, had been successful at passing the county-level imperial examinations, the route to wealth and social success in imperial China, but was unsuccessful in writing the more competitive provincial-level examinations (the &quot;juren&quot; exam). In 1893 Zhou Boyi was discovered attempting to bribe an examination official. Lu Xun&#x27;s grandfather was implicated, and was arrested and sentenced to beheading for his son&#x27;s crime. The sentence was later commuted, and he was imprisoned in Hangzhou instead.

After the affair, Zhou Boyi was stripped of his position in the government and forbidden to ever again write the civil service examinations. The Zhou family only prevented Lu&#x27;s grandfather from being executed through regular, expensive bribes to authorities, until he was finally released in 1901.

After the family&#x27;s attempt at bribery was discovered, Zhou Boyi engaged in heavy drinking and opium use and his health declined. Local Chinese doctors attempted to cure him through a series of expensive quack prescriptions, including monogamous crickets, sugar cane that had survived frost three times, ink, and the skin from a drum. Despite these expensive treatments, Zhou Boyi died of an asthma attack in 1896, at the age of 35. He might have suffered from dropsy.

=== Education ===
Lu Xun half-heartedly participated in the first, district-level civil service examination in 1898, but then abandoned pursuing a traditional Confucian education or career. He intended to study at a prestigious school, the &quot;Seeking Affirmation Academy&quot;, in Hangzhou, but was forced by his family&#x27;s poverty to instead study at the &quot;Jiangnan Naval Academy&quot;, a tuition-free military school in Nanjing.

As a consequence of Lu&#x27;s decision to attend a military school specializing in Western education, his mother wept, he was instructed to change his name to avoid disgracing his family, and some of his relatives began to look down on him. Lu attended the Jiangnan Naval Academy for half a year, and left after it became clear that he would be assigned to work in an engine room, below deck, which he considered degrading. He later wrote that he was dissatisfied with the quality of teaching at the academy.

After leaving the school, Lu sat for the lowest level of the civil service exams, and finished 137th of 500. He intended to sit for the next-highest level, but became upset when one of his younger brothers died, and abandoned his plans.

Lu Xun transferred to another government-funded school, the &quot;School of Mines and Railways&quot;, and graduated from that school in 1902. The school was Lu&#x27;s first exposure to foreign literature, philosophy, history, and science, and he studied English and German intensively. Some of the influential authors that he read during that period include T. H. Huxley, John Stuart Mill, Yan Fu, and Liang Qichao. His later social philosophy may have been influenced by several novels about social conflict that he read during the period, including &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; and &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;.

He did very well at the school with relatively little effort, and occasionally experienced racism directed at him from resident Manchu bannermen. The racism he experienced may have influenced his later sense of Han Chinese nationalism. After graduating Lu Xun planned to become a foreign doctor.

In 1902, Lu Xun left for Japan on a Qing government scholarship to pursue an education in foreign medicine. After arriving in Japan he attended the Kobun Institute, a preparatory language school for Chinese students attending Japanese universities. After encouragement from a classmate, he cut off his queue that Han Chinese were obliged to wear at the time, and practiced jujutsu in his free time. He had an ambiguous attitude towards Chinese revolutionary politics during the period, and it is not clear whether he joined any of the revolutionary parties that were popular among Chinese expatriates in Japan at that time, such as the Tongmenghui. He experienced anti-Chinese racism, but was simultaneously disgusted with the behaviour of some Chinese who were living in Japan. His earliest surviving essays, written in Literary Chinese, were published while he was attending this school, and he published his first Chinese translations of famous and influential foreign novels, including Jules Verne&#x27;s &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot; and &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot;.

In 1904, Lu began studying at the Sendai Medical Academy in northern Honshu, but remained there for less than two years. He generally found his studies at the school tedious and difficult, partially due to his imperfect Japanese. While studying in Sendai he befriended one of his professors, Fujino Genkurō, who helped him prepare class notes. Because of their friendship Lu was accused by his classmates of receiving special assistance from Fujino. Lu later recalled his mentor affectionately in the essay &quot;Mr Fujino&quot;, published in &quot;Dawn Blossoms Plucked at Dusk&quot;. The essay has since become one of his most widely renowned works, and is read in the Chinese middle school curriculum. Fujino later reciprocated Lu&#x27;s respect in an obituary written for Lu after his death in 1937.

While Lu Xun was attending medical school, the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905) broke out. Part of the war was fought on disputed Chinese land. Lantern slides used in the classroom also featured news items. One news slide showed a public execution of a Chinese prisoner being executed by the Japanese military for being an alleged Russian spy. The on-lookers shown in the slide were mainly Chinese, and Lu was shocked by what he viewed as their complete apathy. In his preface to &quot;Nahan&quot;, the first collection of his short stories, Lu explained how viewing this scene influenced him to quit studying Western medicine, and to become a literary physician to what he perceived to be China&#x27;s spiritual problems instead:

At the time, I hadn&#x27;t seen any of my fellow Chinese in a long time, but one day some of them showed up in a slide. One, with his hands tied behind him, was in the middle of the picture; the others were gathered around him. Physically, they were as strong and healthy as anyone could ask, but their expressions revealed all too clearly that spiritually they were calloused and numb. According to the caption, the Chinese whose hands were bound had been spying on the Japanese military for the Russians. He was about to be decapitated as a &#x27;public example.&#x27; The other Chinese gathered around him had come to enjoy the spectacle.

In March 1906, Lu Xun abruptly and secretly terminated his pursuit of the degree and left college. At the time he told no one. After arriving in Tokyo he made sure that the Chinese embassy would not cancel his scholarship and registered at the local German Institute, but was not required to take classes there. He began to read Nietzsche, and wrote a number of essays in the period that were influenced by his philosophy.

In June 1906, Lu&#x27;s mother heard a rumor that he had married a Japanese girl and had a child with her, and feigned illness as a pretext to ask Lu to return home, where she would then force him to take part in an arranged marriage she had agreed to several years before. The girl, Zhu An, had little in common with Lu, was illiterate, and had been subject to foot binding. Lu Xun married her, but they never had a romantic relationship. Despite that fact, Lu took care of her material needs for the rest of his life. Several days after the ceremony Lu sailed back to Japan with his younger brother, Zuoren, and left behind his new wife.

After returning to Japan he took informal classes in literature and history, published several essays in student-run journals, and in 1907 he briefly took Russian lessons. He attempted to found a literary journal with his brother, &quot;New Life&quot;, but before its first publication its other writers and its financial backers all abandoned the project, and it failed. In 1909 Lu and his brother published their translations of Western fiction, including Edgar Allan Poe, as &quot;Tales from Abroad&quot;, but the book sold only 41 copies of the 1,500 copies that were printed. The publication failed for many reasons: it was only sold in Tokyo, which did not have a large Chinese population, and in a single silk shop in Shanghai. Additionally, Lu wrote in Literary Chinese, which was very difficult for ordinary people to read.

=== Early career ===
Lu intended to study in Germany in 1909, but did not have sufficient funds, and was forced to return home. Between 1909 and 1911 he held a number of brief teaching positions at local colleges and secondary schools that he felt were unsatisfying, partly to support his brother Zuoren&#x27;s studies in Japan.

Lu spent these years in traditional Chinese literary pursuits: collecting old books, researching pre-modern Chinese fiction, reconstructing ancient tombstone inscriptions, and compiling the history of his native town, Shaoxing. He explained to an old friend that his activities were not &quot;scholarship&quot;, but &quot;a substitute for &#x27;wine and women&#x27;&quot;. In his personal letters he expressed disappointment about his own failure, China&#x27;s political situation, and his family&#x27;s continuing impoverishment.

In 1911 he returned to Japan to retrieve his brother, Zuoren, so that Zuoren could help with the family finances. Zuoren wanted to remain in Japan to study French, but Lu wrote that &quot;French... does not fill stomachs&quot;. He encouraged another one of his brothers, Jianren, to become a botanist. He began to drink heavily, a habit he continued for the rest of his life. In 1911 he wrote his first short story, &quot;Nostalgia&quot;, but he was so disappointed with it that he threw it away. Zuoren saved it, and had it successfully published two years later under his own name.

In February 1912, shortly after the Xinhai Revolution overthrew the Qing dynasty and was followed by the founding of the Republic of China, Lu gained a position at the national Ministry of Education. He was hired in Nanjing, but then moved with the ministry to Beijing, where he lived from 1912 to 1926. At first, his work consisted almost completely of copying books, but he was later appointed Section Head of the Social Education Division, and eventually to the position of Assistant Secretary. Two of his major accomplishments in office were the renovation and expansion of the National Library of China in Beijing, the establishment of the Natural History Museum, and the establishment of the Library of Popular Literature.

Together with Qian Daosun and Xu Shoushang, he designed the Twelve Symbols national emblem in 1912.

Between 1912 and 1917 he was a member of an ineffectual censorship committee, informally studied Buddhist sutras, lectured on fine arts, wrote and self-published a book on the history of Shaoxing, and edited and self-published a collection of folk stories from the Tang and Song dynasties. He collected and self-published an authoritative book on the work of an ancient poet, Ji Kang, and wrote &quot;A Brief History of Chinese Fiction&quot;, a work which, because traditional scholars had not valued fiction, had little precedent in China. After Yuan Shikai declared himself the Emperor of China in 1915, Lu was briefly forced to participate in rituals honoring Confucius, which he ridiculed in his diaries.

In 1917, an old friend of Lu&#x27;s, Qian Xuantong, invited Lu to write for &quot;New Youth&quot;, a radical populist literary magazine that had recently been founded by Chen Duxiu, which also inspired a great number of younger writers such as Mao Dun. At first Lu was skeptical that his writing could serve any social purpose. He told Qian: &quot;Imagine an iron house without windows, absolutely indestructible, with many people fast asleep inside who will soon die of suffocation. But you know since they will die in their sleep, they will not feel the pain of death. Now if you cry aloud to wake a few of the lighter sleepers, making those unfortunate few suffer the agony of irrevocable death, do you think you are doing them a good turn?&quot; Qian replied, &quot;But if a few awake, you can&#x27;t say that there is no hope of destroying the iron house.&quot; Shortly afterwards, in 1918 Lu wrote the first short story published in his name, &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot;, for the April 2, 1918 magazine issue.

Lu recounted the conversation in his short story collection, &quot;Call to Arms&quot;. It is widely known in China as a metaphor for the traditional Chinese cultural values and norms that Lu opposed.

After the publication of &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot;, the story was praised for its anti-traditionalism, its synthesis of Chinese and foreign conventions and ideas, and its skillful narration, and Lu became recognized as one of the leading writers of the New Culture Movement. Lu continued writing for the magazine, and produced his most famous stories for &quot;New Youth&quot; between 1917 and 1921. These stories were collected and re-published in &quot;Nahan&quot; (&quot;Outcry&quot;) in 1923.

In 1919, Lu moved his family from Shaoxing to a large compound in Beijing, where he lived with his mother, his two brothers, and their Japanese wives. This living arrangement lasted until 1923, when Lu had a falling out with his brother, Zuoren, after which Lu moved with his wife and mother to a separate house. Neither Lu nor Zuoren ever publicly explained the reason for their disagreement, but Zuoren&#x27;s wife later accused Lu of making sexual advances towards her. Some writers have speculated that their relationship may have worsened as a result of issues related to money, that Lu walked in on Zuoren&#x27;s wife bathing, or that Lu had an inappropriate &quot;relationship&quot; with Zuoren&#x27;s wife in Japan that Zuoren later discovered. After the falling out with Zuoren, Lu became depressed.

In 1920, Lu began to lecture part-time at several colleges, including Peking University, Beijing Normal University, and Beijing Women&#x27;s College, where he taught traditional fiction and literary theory. His lecture notes were later collected and published as &quot;A Brief History of Chinese Fiction&quot;. He was able to work part-time because he only worked at the Education Ministry three days a week for three hours a day. In 1923 he lost his front teeth in a rickshaw accident, and in 1924 he developed the first symptoms of tuberculosis. In 1925 he founded a journal, &quot;Wilderness&quot;, and established the &quot;Weiming Society&quot; in order to support young writers and encourage the translation of foreign literature into Chinese.

In the 20 years after the 1911 revolution there was a flowering of literary activity with dozens of journals. The goal was to reform the Chinese language to make universal education possible. Lu Xun was an active participant. His greatest works, such as &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot; and &quot;Ah Q&quot;, exemplify this style of &quot;peasant dirt literature&quot; (). The language is fresh and direct. The subjects are country peasants.

In 1925, Lu began what may have been his first meaningful romantic relationship, with one of his students at the Beijing Women&#x27;s College, Xu Guangping. In March 1926 there was a mass student protest against the warlord Feng Yuxiang&#x27;s collaboration with the Japanese. The protests degenerated into a massacre, in which two of Lu&#x27;s students from Beijing Women&#x27;s College were killed. Lu&#x27;s public support for the protesters forced him to flee from the local authorities. Later in 1926, when the warlord troops of Zhang Zuolin and Wu Peifu took over Beijing, Lu left northern China and fled to Xiamen.

After arriving in Xiamen, later in 1926, Lu began teaching at Xiamen University, but was disappointed by the petty disagreements and unfriendliness of the university&#x27;s faculty. During the short time he lived in Xiamen, Lu wrote his last collection of fiction, &quot;Old Tales Retold&quot;, which would not be published until several years later, and most of his autobiography, published as &quot;Dawn Blossoms Plucked at Dusk&quot;. He also published a collection of prose poetry, entitled &quot;Wild Grass&quot;.

In January 1927, he and Xu moved to Guangzhou, where he was hired as the head of the Chinese literature department at Sun Yat-sen University. His first act in his position was to hire Xu as his personal assistant, as well as Xu Shoushang, one of his old classmates from Japan, as a lecturer. While in Guangzhou, he edited numerous poems and books for publication, and served as a guest lecturer at Whampoa Academy. Through his students, he established connections within both the Kuomintang and Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

After the Shanghai massacre in April 1927, he attempted to secure the release of several students through the university, but failed. His failure to save his students led him to resign from his position at the university, and he left for the Shanghai International Settlement in September 1927. By the time he left Guangzhou, he was one of the most famous intellectuals in China.

In 1927 Lu was considered for the Nobel Prize in Literature, for the short story &quot;The True Story of Ah Q&quot;, despite a poor English translation and annotations that were nearly double the size of the text. Lu rejected the possibility of accepting the nomination. Later, he renounced writing fiction or poetry in response to China&#x27;s deteriorating political situation and his own poor emotional state, and restricted himself to writing argumentative essays.

=== Later career ===
In 1929, he visited his mother, and reported that she was pleased at the news of Guangping&#x27;s pregnancy. Xu Guangping gave birth to a son named Haiying on 27 September. She was in labor with the baby for 27 hours. The child&#x27;s name meant simply &quot;Shanghai infant&quot;. His parents chose the name thinking that he could change it himself later, but he never did so. Haiying was Lu Xun&#x27;s only child.

After moving to Shanghai, Lu rejected all regular teaching positions (though he sometimes gave guest lectures at different campuses), and for the first time was able to make a living solely as a professional writer, with a monthly income of roughly 500 yuan. He was also appointed by the government as a &quot;specially appointed writer&quot; by the national Ministry of Higher Education, which secured him an additional 300 yuan per month.

He began to study and identify with Marxist politics, made contact with local CCP members, and became involved in literary disputes with other leftist writers in the city. In 1930 Lu became one of the co-founders of the League of Left-Wing Writers, but shortly after he moved to Shanghai other leftist writers accused him of being &quot;an evil feudal remnant&quot;, the &quot;best spokesman of the bourgeoisie&quot;, and &quot;a counterrevolutionary split personality&quot;. The League continued in various forms until 1936, when the constant disputes among its members led the CCP to dissolve it.

In January 1931, the Kuomintang passed new, stricter censorship laws, allowing for writers producing literature deemed &quot;endangering the public&quot; or &quot;disturbing public order&quot; to be imprisoned for life or executed. Later that month he went into hiding. In early February, less than a month later, the Kuomintang executed twenty-four local writers (including five who belonged to the League) whom they had arrested under this law.

After the execution of the &quot;24 Longhua Martyrs&quot; (in addition to other students, friends, and associates), Lu&#x27;s political views became distinctly anti-Kuomintang. In 1933 Lu met Edgar Snow. Snow asked Lu whether there were any Ah Q&#x27;s left in China. Lu responded, &quot;It&#x27;s worse now. Now it&#x27;s Ah Q&#x27;s who are running the country.&quot;

Despite the unfavorable political climate, Lu Xun contributed regularly to a variety of periodicals in the 1930s, including Lin Yutang&#x27;s humor magazine &quot;The Analects Fortnightly&quot;, and corresponded with writers in Japan as well as China.

Although he had renounced writing fiction years before, in 1934 he published his last collection of short stories, &quot;Old Tales Retold&quot;. In 1935, he sent a telegram to CCP forces in Shaanxi congratulating them on the recent completion of their Long March. The CCP requested that he write a novel about the communist revolution set in rural China, but he declined, citing his lack of background and understanding of the subject.


Lu was a heavy smoker, which may have contributed to the deterioration of his health throughout his last year. By 1936 he had developed chronic tuberculosis, and in March of that year he was stricken with bronchial asthma and a fever. The treatment for this involved draining 300 grams of fluid in the lungs through a puncture.

From June to August, he was again sick, and his weight dropped to only . He recovered somewhat, and wrote two essays in the fall reflecting on mortality. These included &quot;Death&quot;, and &quot;This Too Is Life&quot;. A month before his death, he wrote: &quot;Hold the funeral quickly... do not stage any memorial services. Forget about me, and care about your own life – you&#x27;re a fool if you don&#x27;t.&quot; Regarding his son, he wrote: &quot;On no account let him become a good-for-nothing writer or artist.&quot;

=== Death ===
At 3:30 am on the morning of 18 October 1936, the author woke having great difficulty breathing. Dr. Sudo, his physician, was summoned, and Lu Xun was given injections to relieve the pain. His wife was with him throughout that night. Lu Xun died at 5:11 am the next morning, 19 October. Lu&#x27;s remains were interred in a mausoleum within Lu Xun Park in Shanghai. Mao Zedong later made the calligraphic inscription above his tomb.

He was survived by his son, Zhou Haiying.

== Legacy ==
Lu Xun has been described by Nobel laureate Kenzaburō Ōe as &quot;the greatest writer Asia produced in the 20th century.&quot; Shortly after Lu Xun&#x27;s death, Mao Zedong called him &quot;the saint of modern China&quot;, but used his legacy selectively to promote his own political goals. In 1942, he quoted Lu out of context to tell his audience to be &quot;a willing ox&quot; like Lu Xun was, but told writers and artists who believed in freedom of expression that, because CCP areas were already liberated, they did not need to be like Lu Xun. After the People&#x27;s Republic of China was established in 1949, CCP literary theorists portrayed his work as orthodox examples of communist literature, yet every one of Lu&#x27;s close disciples from the 1930s was purged. Mao admitted that, had Lu survived until the 1950s, he would &quot;either have gone silent or gone to prison&quot;.
Party leaders depicted him as &quot;drawing the blueprint of the communist future&quot; and Mao Zedong defined him as the &quot;chief commander of China&#x27;s Cultural Revolution,&quot; although Lu did not join the party. During the 1920s and 1930s Lu Xun and his contemporaries often met informally for free-wheeling intellectual discussions, but after the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic in 1949 the Party sought more control over intellectual life in China, and this type of intellectual independence was suppressed, often violently.

Finally, Lu Xun&#x27;s satirical and ironic writing style itself was discouraged, ridiculed, then as often as possible destroyed. In 1942, Mao wrote that &quot;the style of the essay should not simply be like Lu Xun&#x27;s. [In a Communist society] we can shout at the top of our voices and have no need for veiled and round-about expressions, which are hard for the people to understand.&quot; In 2007, some of his bleaker works were removed from school textbooks. Julia Lovell, who has translated Lu Xun&#x27;s writing, speculated that &quot;perhaps also it was an attempt to discourage the youth of today from Lu Xun&#x27;s inconveniently fault-finding habits.&quot;

During the Cultural Revolution, the CCP both hailed Lu Xun as one of the fathers of communism in China, yet ironically suppressed the very intellectual culture and style of writing that he represented. Some of his essays and writings are now part of the primary school and middle school compulsory curriculum in China.

Lu completed volumes of translations, notably from Russian. He particularly admired Nikolai Gogol and made a translation of &quot;Dead Souls&quot;. His own first story&#x27;s title, &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot;, was inspired by Gogol&#x27;s story of the same name. As a left-wing writer, Lu played an important role in the development of modern Chinese literature. His books were and remain highly influential and popular today, both in China and internationally. Lu Xun&#x27;s works appear in high school textbooks in both China and Japan. He is known to Japanese by the name Rojin (; ).

Because of his leftist political involvement and the role his works played in the subsequent history of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Lu Xun&#x27;s works were banned in Taiwan until the late 1980s. He was among the early supporters of the Esperanto movement in China.

Lu Xun&#x27;s importance to modern Chinese literature lies in the fact that he contributed significantly to nearly every modern literary medium during his lifetime. He wrote in a clear lucid style, which was to influence many generations, in stories, prose poems and essays. Lu Xun&#x27;s two short story collections, &quot;Nahan&quot; (&quot;Call to Arms&quot;) and &quot;Panghuang&quot; (&quot;Wandering&quot;), are often acclaimed as classics of modern Chinese literature. Lu Xun&#x27;s translations were important at a time when foreign literature was seldom read, and his literary criticisms remain acute and persuasively argued.

Lu Xun was also a leader of the Woodcut Movement in China (1930–1950) and widely recognized as a pioneer of the rise of the woodcut print in China. After encountering new printmaking techniques in Japan, Lu embraced the art form, envisioning it as a medium to promote social change and &quot;an alternative socialist road to art.&quot; Through writings, lectures, and woodcut print publications, Lu Xun was instrumental in inspiring a generation in China towards the black-and-white woodcut.

The work of Lu Xun has also received attention outside China. In 1986, Fredric Jameson cited &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot; as the &quot;supreme example&quot; of the &quot;national allegory&quot; form that all Third World literature takes. Gloria Davies compares Lu Xun to Nietzsche, saying that both were &quot;trapped in the construction of a modernity which is fundamentally problematic&quot;. According to Leonardo Vittorio Arena, Lu Xun cultivated an ambiguous standpoint towards Nietzsche, a mixture of attraction and repulsion, the latter because of Nietzsche&#x27;s excesses in style and content.
* A major literature prize in China, the Lu Xun Literary Prize is named after him. 
* Asteroid (233547) 2007 JR27 was named after him.
* A crater on Mercury is named after him.
* The artist Shi Lu chose the second half of his pen name to reflect his admiration for Lu Xun.

== Style and thought ==
Lu Xun was a versatile writer. He wrote using both traditional Chinese conventions and 19th century European literary forms. His style has been described in equally broad terms, conveying both &quot;sympathetic engagement&quot; and &quot;ironic detachment&quot; at different moments. Particularly in his early novellas, Lu wrote about characters who were weak, indecisive, frustrated, and largely the victims of oppressive Chinese culture.

His essays are often very incisive in his societal commentary, and in his stories his mastery of the vernacular language and tone make some of his literary works (like &quot;The True Story of Ah Q&quot;) hard to convey through translation. In them, he frequently treads a fine line between criticizing the follies of his characters and sympathizing with those very follies. Lu Xun was a master of irony and satire (as can be seen in &quot;The True Story of Ah Q&quot;) and yet could also write impressively direct prose (&quot;My Old Home&quot;, &quot;A Little Incident&quot;).
Lu Xun is typically regarded by Mao Zedong as the most influential Chinese writer who was associated with the May Fourth Movement. He produced harsh criticism of social problems in China, particularly in his analysis of the &quot;Chinese national character&quot;. He was sometimes called a &quot;champion of common humanity&quot;.

Lu Xun felt that the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 had been a failure. In 1925 he opined, &quot;I feel the so-called Republic of China has ceased to exist. I feel that, before the revolution, I was a slave, but shortly after the revolution, I have been cheated by slaves and have become their slave.&quot; He even recommended that his readers heed the critique of Chinese culture in &quot;Chinese Characteristics&quot; by the missionary writer Arthur Smith. His disillusionment with politics led him to conclude in 1927 that &quot;revolutionary literature&quot; alone could not bring about radical change. Rather, &quot;revolutionary men&quot; needed to lead a revolution using force. In the end, he experienced profound disappointment with the new Nationalist government, which he viewed as ineffective and even harmful to China.

Lu contended that &quot;[i]f Chinese characters are not exterminated, there can be no doubt that China will perish.&quot;

== Bibliography ==
Lu Xun&#x27;s works became known to English readers as early as 1926 with the publication in Shanghai of &quot;The True Story of Ah Q&quot;, translated by George Kin Leung, and more widely beginning in 1936 with an anthology edited by Edgar Snow and Nym Wales &quot;Living China, Modern Chinese Short Stories,&quot; in which Part One included seven of Lu Xun&#x27;s stories and a short biography based on Snow&#x27;s talks with Lu Xun. However, there was not a complete translation of the fiction until the four-volume set of his writings, which included &quot;Selected Stories of Lu Hsun&quot; translated by Yang Hsien-yi and Gladys Yang. Another full selection was William A. Lyell&#x27;s &quot;Diary of a Madman and Other Stories&quot; (Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1990). In 2009, Penguin Classics published a complete translation by Julia Lovell of his fiction, &quot;The Real Story of Ah-Q and Other Tales of China: The Complete Fiction of Lu Xun&quot;, which the scholar Jeffrey Wasserstrom said &quot;could be considered the most significant Penguin Classic ever published.&quot;

&quot;The Lyrical Lu Xun: a Study of his Classical-style Verse&quot;—a book by Jon Eugene von Kowallis (Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1996) – includes a complete introduction to Lu Xun&#x27;s poetry in the classical style, with Chinese characters, literal and verse translations, and a biographical introduction which summarizes his life in relation to his poetry.

In 2017, Harvard University Press published a book of his essays translated by Eileen J. Cheng, titled &quot;Jottings under Lamplight&quot;.

<doc id="65862" wikidata="Q180762" url="?curid=65862" title="Angina">
<text>Angina, also known as angina pectoris, is chest pain or pressure, usually caused by insufficient blood flow to the heart muscle (myocardium). It is most commonly a symptom of coronary artery disease.
Angina is typically the result of partial obstruction or spasm of the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle. The main mechanism of coronary artery obstruction is atherosclerosis as part of coronary artery disease. Other causes of angina include abnormal heart rhythms, heart failure and, less commonly, anemia. The term derives , and can therefore be translated as &quot;a strangling feeling in the chest&quot;.

An urgent medical assessment is suggested to rule out serious medical conditions. There is a relationship between severity of angina and degree of oxygen deprivation in the heart muscle. However, the severity of angina does not always match the degree of oxygen deprivation to the heart or the risk of a heart attack (myocardial infarction). Some people may experience severe pain even though there is little risk of a heart attack whilst others may have a heart attack and experience little or no pain. In some cases, angina can be quite severe. Worsening angina attacks, sudden-onset angina at rest, and angina lasting more than 15 minutes are symptoms of unstable angina (usually grouped with similar conditions as the acute coronary syndrome). As these may precede a heart attack, they require urgent medical attention and are, in general, treated similarly to heart attacks.

In the early 20th century, severe angina was seen as a sign of impending death. However, modern medical therapies have improved the outlook substantially. Middle-age patients who experience moderate to severe angina (grading by classes II, III, and IV) have a five-year survival rate of approximately 92%.

==Classification==

===Stable angina===
Also known as &#x27;effort angina&#x27;, this refers to the classic type of angina related to myocardial ischemia. A typical presentation of stable angina is that of chest discomfort and associated symptoms precipitated by some activity (running, walking, etc.) with minimal or non-existent symptoms at rest or after administration of sublingual nitroglycerin. Symptoms typically diminish several minutes after activity and recur when activity resumes. In this way, stable angina may be thought of as being similar to intermittent claudication symptoms. Other recognized precipitants of stable angina include cold weather, heavy meals, and emotional stress.

===Unstable angina===

Unstable angina (UA) (also &quot;crescendo angina&quot;; this is a form of acute coronary syndrome) is defined as angina pectoris that changes or worsens or begins suddenly at rest. Unstable angina is a medical emergency and requires urgent medical treatment from a doctor.

It has at least one of these three features:
# it occurs at rest (or with minimal exertion), usually lasting more than 10 minutes
# it is severe and of new-onset (i.e., within the prior 4–6 weeks)
# it occurs with a pattern (i.e., distinctly more severe, prolonged, or frequent than before).

UA may occur often unpredictably and even at rest, which may be a serious indicator of an impending heart attack. The primary factor differentiating unstable angina from stable angina (other than symptoms) is the underlying pathophysiology of the atherosclerosis. The pathophysiology of unstable angina is the reduction of coronary blood flow due to transient platelet aggregation on apparently normal endothelium, coronary artery spasms, or coronary thrombosis.

The process starts with atherosclerosis, progresses through inflammation to yield an active unstable plaque, which undergoes thrombosis and results in acute myocardial ischemia, which, if not reversed, results in cell necrosis (infarction). Studies show that 64% of all unstable anginas occur between 22:00 and 08:00 when patients are at rest.

In stable angina, the developing atheroma (a fatty plaque) is protected with a fibrous cap. This cap may rupture in unstable angina, allowing blood clots to precipitate and further decrease the area of the coronary vessel&#x27;s lumen or the interior open space within an artery. This explains why, in many cases, unstable angina develops independently of activity.

===Microvascular angina===

Microvascular angina, also known as &quot;cardiac syndrome X&quot;, is characterized by angina-like chest pain, in the context of normal epicardial coronary arteries (the largest vessels on the surface of the heart, prior to significant branching) on angiography. The original definition of cardiac syndrome X also mandated that ischemic changes on exercise (despite normal coronary arteries) were displayed, as shown on cardiac stress tests. The primary cause of microvascular angina is unknown, but factors apparently involved are endothelial dysfunction and reduced flow (perhaps due to spasm) in the tiny &quot;resistance&quot; blood vessels of the heart. Since microvascular angina is not characterized by major arterial blockages, it is harder to recognize and diagnose.

Microvascular angina was previously considered a rather benign condition, but more recent data has changed this attitude. Studies, including the Women&#x27;s Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation (WISE), suggest that microvascular angina is part of the pathophysiology of ischemic heart disease, perhaps explaining the higher rates of angina in females than in males, as well as their predilection towards ischemia and acute coronary syndromes in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease.

Angina pectoris can be quite painful, but many patients with angina complain of chest discomfort rather than actual pain: the discomfort is usually described as a pressure, heaviness, tightness, squeezing, burning, or choking sensation. Apart from chest discomfort, anginal pains may also be experienced in the epigastrium (upper central abdomen), back, neck area, jaw, or shoulders. This is explained by the concept of referred pain and is because the spinal level that receives visceral sensation from the heart simultaneously receives cutaneous sensation from parts of the skin specified by that spinal nerve&#x27;s dermatome, without an ability to discriminate the two. Typical locations for referred pain are arms (often inner left arm), shoulders, and neck into the jaw. Angina is typically precipitated by exertion or emotional stress. It is exacerbated by having a full stomach and by cold temperatures. Pain may be accompanied by breathlessness, sweating, and nausea in some cases. In this case, the pulse rate and the blood pressure increases. Chest pain lasting only a few seconds is normally not angina (such as precordial catch syndrome).

Myocardial ischemia comes about when the myocardium (the heart muscle) receives insufficient blood and oxygen to function normally either because of increased oxygen demand by the myocardium or because of decreased supply to the myocardium. This inadequate perfusion of blood and the resulting reduced delivery of oxygen and nutrients are directly correlated to blocked or narrowed blood vessels.

Some experience &quot;autonomic symptoms&quot; (related to increased activity of the autonomic nervous system) such as nausea, vomiting, and pallor.

Major risk factors for angina include cigarette smoking, diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, sedentary lifestyle, and family history of premature heart disease.

A variant form of angina—Prinzmetal&#x27;s angina—occurs in patients with normal coronary arteries or insignificant atherosclerosis. It is believed caused by spasms of the artery. It occurs more in younger women.

Coital angina, also known as &quot;angina d&#x27;amour&quot;, is angina subsequent to sexual intercourse. It is generally rare, except in patients with severe coronary artery disease.

==Cause==
===Major risk factors===

Routine counseling of adults by physicians to advise them to improve their diet and increase their physical activity has, in general, been found to induce only small changes in actual behavior. Therefore, as of 2012, The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force does not recommend routine lifestyle counseling of all patients without known cardiovascular disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or diabetes, and instead recommends selectively counseling only those patients who seem most ready to make lifestyle changes and using available time with other patients to explore other types of intervention that would be more likely to have a preventative impact.

; Conditions that exacerbate or provoke angina

One study found that smokers with coronary artery disease had a significantly increased level of sympathetic nerve activity when compared to those without. This is in addition to increases in blood pressure, heart rate, and peripheral vascular resistance associated with nicotine, which may lead to recurrent angina attacks. In addition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that the risk of CHD (Coronary heart disease), stroke, and PVD (Peripheral vascular disease) is reduced within 1–2 years of smoking cessation. In another study, it was found that, after one year, the prevalence of angina in smokingmales under 60 after an initial attack was 40% less in those having quit smoking compared to those that continued. Studies have found that there are short-term and long-term benefits to smoking cessation.

===Other medical problems===
* Esophageal disorders
* Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
* Hyperthyroidism
* Hypoxemia
* Profound anemia
* Uncontrolled hypertension

===Other cardiac problems===
* Bradyarrhythmia
* Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
* Tachyarrhythmia
* Valvular heart disease

Myocardial ischemia can result from:
# a reduction of blood flow to the heart that can be caused by stenosis, spasm, or acute occlusion (by an embolus) of the heart&#x27;s arteries.
# resistance of the blood vessels. This can be caused by narrowing of the blood vessels; a decrease in radius. Blood flow is proportional to the radius of the artery to the fourth power.
# reduced oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, due to several factors such as a decrease in oxygen tension and hemoglobin concentration. This decreases the ability of hemoglobin to carry oxygen to myocardial tissue.

Atherosclerosis is the most common cause of stenosis (narrowing of the blood vessels) of the heart&#x27;s arteries and, hence, angina pectoris. Some people with chest pain have normal or minimal narrowing of heart arteries; in these patients, vasospasm is a more likely cause for the pain, sometimes in the context of Prinzmetal&#x27;s angina and syndrome X.

Myocardial ischemia also can be the result of factors affecting blood composition, such as the reduced oxygen-carrying capacity of blood, as seen with severe anemia (low number of red blood cells), or long-term smoking.

==Pathophysiology==
Angina results when there is an imbalance between the heart&#x27;s oxygen demand and supply. This imbalance can result from an increase in demand (e.g., during exercise) without a proportional increase in supply (e.g., due to obstruction or atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries).

However, the pathophysiology of angina in females varies significantly as compared to males. Non-obstructive coronary disease is more common in females.

==Diagnosis==
Angina should be suspected in people presenting tight, dull, or heavy chest discomfort that is:
# Retrosternal or left-sided, radiating to the left arm, neck, jaw, or back.
# Associated with exertion or emotional stress and relieved within several minutes by rest.
# Precipitated by cold weather or a meal.

Some people present with atypical symptoms, including breathlessness, nausea, or epigastric discomfort, or burning. These atypical symptoms are particularly likely in older people, women, and those with diabetes.

Anginal pain is not usually sharp or stabbing or influenced by respiration. Antacids and simple analgesics do not usually relieve the pain. If chest discomfort (of whatever site) is precipitated by exertion, relieved by rest, and relieved by glyceryl trinitrate, the likelihood of angina is increased.

In angina patients momentarily not feeling any chest pain, an electrocardiogram (ECG) is typically normal unless there have been other cardiac problems in the past. During periods of pain, depression, or elevation of the ST segment may be observed. To elicit these changes, an exercise ECG test (&quot;treadmill test&quot;) may be performed, during which the patient exercises to his/her maximum ability before fatigue, breathlessness, or pain intervenes; if characteristic ECG changes are documented (typically more than 1 mm of flat or downsloping ST depression), the test is considered diagnostic for angina. Even constant monitoring of the blood pressure and the pulse rate can lead to some conclusions regarding angina. The exercise test is also useful in looking for other markers of myocardial ischemia: blood pressure response (or lack thereof, in particular, a drop in systolic blood pressure), dysrhythmia, and chronotropic response. Other alternatives to a standard exercise test include a thallium scintigram or sestamibi scintigram (in patients unable to exercise enough for the treadmill tests, e.g., due to asthma or arthritis or in whom the ECG is too abnormal at rest) or stress echocardiography.

In patients in whom such noninvasive testing is diagnostic, a coronary angiogram is typically performed to identify the nature of the coronary lesion, and whether this would be a candidate for angioplasty, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), treatment only with medication, or other treatments. In hospitalized patients with unstable angina (or the newer term of &quot;high-risk acute coronary syndromes&quot;), those with resting ischaemic ECG changes or those with raised cardiac enzymes such as troponin may undergo coronary angiography directly.

==Treatment==
Angina pectoris occurs as a result of coronary blood flow insufficiency in the face of increased oxygen demand. The principal goal in the prevention and relief of angina is to limit the oxygen requirement of the heart so it can meet the inadequate oxygen supply derived through the blood supplied from the stenosed or constricted arteries. The main goals of treatment in angina pectoris are relief of symptoms, slowing progression of the disease, and reduction of future events, especially heart attacks and death. Beta blockers (e.g., carvedilol, metoprolol, propranolol) have a large body of evidence in morbidity and mortality benefits (fewer symptoms, less disability, and longer life) and short-acting nitroglycerin medications have been used since 1879 for symptomatic relief of angina. There are differing course of treatments for the patient depending on the type of angina the patient has. However, this second can provide a brief overview of the types of medications provided for angina and the purpose by which they are prescribed.

Beta blockers, specifically B1 adrenergic blockers without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, are preferred for angina treatment, out of B1 selective and non-selective as well as B1 ISA agents. B1 blockers are cardioselective blocking agents (such as nevibolol, atenolol, metoprolol, bisoprolol, etc.) which result in blocking cAMP in the heart muscle cells. cAMP, which plays a vital role in phosphorylating the ryanodine receptor and LTCC, will usually increase Ca+2 levels in the heart muscle cells, blocking contraction. Therefore, B1 blockade decreases the HR and contraction of the heart muscle, making it demand less oxygen. An important thing to note is that the B1 cardioselective blockers are cardioselective and not cardio-specific. This means that if the beta-adrenergic antagonist is prescribed in higher doses, it can lose the selectivity aspect and begin causing hypertension from B2 adrenergic stimulation of smooth muscle cells. This is why in therapy for patients with angina, the vasodilatory organonitrates complement the use of B-blockers when prescribed the use of angina. The preference for Beta-1 cardioselective blockers is for B1 cardioselective blockers without instrinsic sympathetic activity. Beta blockers with intrinsic sympathetic activity will still do the beta blockade of the heart muscle cells and have a decreased ionotrophic and chronotropic effect, but this effect will be to a lesser extent than if the beta blocker did not have the instrinsic sympathetic activity. A common beta-blocker with ISA prescribed for the treatment of angina is Acebutolol.

Non-selective beta-adrenergic antagonists will yield the same action on B1 receptors, however will also act on B2 receptors. These medications, such as Propranolol and Nadolol, act on B1 receptors on smooth muscle cells as well. B1 blockade occurs in the smooth muscle cells. Specifically cAMP is responsible for inhibiting Myosin Light Kinase, the enzyme responsible for acting on Actin-Myosin. The inhibition of B1 will result in decreased levels of cAMP which will lead to increased levels of Myosin Light Chain Kinase in the smooth muscle cells, the enzyme responsible for acting on Actin-Myosin and leading to contraction of the smooth muscle cell. This increased contraction of the smooth muscle cell from B1 blockade is not desirable since it explains the hypertension that may arise with patients taking that medication.

Calcium channel blockers act to decrease the heart&#x27;s workload, and thus its requirement for oxygen by blocking the calcium channels of the heart muscle cell. With decreased intracellular calcium, the calcium-troponin complex does not form in the heart muscle cell and it does not contract, therefore reducing the need for oxygen.

The other class of medication that can be used to treat angina are the organic nitrates. Organic nitrates are used extensively to treat angina. They improve coronary blood flow of the coronary arteries (arteries which supply blood to the heart muscle) by reversing and preventing vasospasm, which increases the blood flow to the heart, improving perfusion and oxygen delivery to the heart associated with the pain of angina. These drugs also reduce systemic vascular resistance, of both veins and arteries but the veins to a greater extent. The decrease in the resistance of the arteries and veins decreases the myocardial oxygen demand, which also reduces myocardial oxygen demand. Nitroglycerin is a potent vasodilator that decreases myocardial oxygen demand by decreasing the heart&#x27;s workload. Nitroglycerin should not be given if certain inhibitors such as sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil have been taken within the previous 12 hours as the combination of the two could cause a serious drop in blood pressure.

Treatments for angina are balloon angioplasty, in which the balloon is inserted at the end of a catheter and inflated to widen the arterial lumen. Stents to maintain the arterial widening are often used at the same time. Coronary bypass surgery involves bypassing constricted arteries with venous grafts. This is much more invasive than angioplasty.

Calcium channel blockers (such as nifedipine (Adalat) and amlodipine), isosorbide mononitrate and nicorandil are vasodilators commonly used in chronic stable angina. A new therapeutic class, called If inhibitor, has recently been made available: Ivabradine provides heart rate reduction without affecting contractility leading to major anti-ischemic and antianginal efficacy. ACE inhibitors are also vasodilators with both symptomatic and prognostic benefit. Statins are the most frequently used lipid/cholesterol modifiers, which probably also stabilize existing atheromatous plaque.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi:10.1001/jama.295.13.jpc60002&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Low-dose aspirin decreases the risk of heart attack in patients with chronic stable angina, and was part of standard treatment. However, in patients without established cardiovascular disease, the increase in hemorrhagic stroke and gastrointestinal bleeding offsets any benefits and it is no longer advised unless the risk of myocardial infarction is very high.

Exercise is also a very good long-term treatment for the angina (but only particular regimens – gentle and sustained exercise rather than intense short bursts), probably working by complex mechanisms such as improving blood pressure and promoting coronary artery collateralisation.

Though sometimes used by patients, evidence does not support the use of traditional Chinese herbal products (THCP) for angina.

Identifying and treating risk factors for further coronary heart disease is a priority in patients with angina. This means testing for elevated cholesterol and other fats in the blood, diabetes and hypertension (high blood pressure), and encouraging smoking cessation and weight optimization.

The calcium channel blocker nifedipine prolongs cardiovascular event- and procedure-free survival in patients with coronary artery disease. New overt heart failures were reduced by 29% compared to placebo; however, the mortality rate difference between the two groups was statistically insignificant.

===Microvascular angina in women===
Women with myocardial ischemia often have either no or atypical symptoms, such as palpitations, anxiety, weakness, and fatigue. Additionally, many females with angina are found to have cardiac ischemia, yet no evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease on cardiac catheterization. Evidence is accumulating that nearly half of females with myocardial ischemia have coronary microvascular disease, a condition often called microvascular angina (MVA). Small intramyocardial arterioles constrict in MVA causing ischemic pain that is less predictable than with typical epicardial coronary artery disease (CAD).

The pathophysiology is complex and still being elucidated, but there is strong evidence that endothelial dysfunction, decreased endogenous vasodilators, inflammation, changes in adipokines, and platelet activation are contributing factors. The diagnosis of MVA may require catheterization during which there is an assessment of the microcirculatory response to adenosine or acetylcholine and measurement of coronary and fractional flow reserve. New techniques include positron emission tomography (PET) scanning, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and transthoracic Doppler echocardiography.

Managing MVA can be challenging, for example, females with this condition have less coronary microvascular dilation in response to nitrates than do those without MVA. Females with MVA often have traditional risk factors for CAD such as obesity, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and hypertension. Aggressive interventions to reduce modifiable risk factors are an important component of management, especially smoking cessation, exercise, and diabetes management. The combination of non-nitrate vasodilators, such as calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors along with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), also is effective in many women, and new drugs, such as Ranolazine and Ivabradine, have shown promise in the treatment of MVA. Other approaches include spinal cord stimulators, adenosine receptor blockade, and psychiatric intervention.

===Suspected angina===
Hospital admission for people with the following symptoms is recommended, as they may have unstable angina: pain at rest (which may occur at night), pain on minimal exertion, angina that seems to progress rapidly despite increasing medical treatment. All people with suspected angina should be urgently referred to a chest pain evaluation service, for confirmation of the diagnosis and assessment of the severity of coronary heart disease.

==Epidemiology==
As of 2010, angina due to ischemic heart disease affects approximately 112 million people (1.6% of the global population) being slightly more common in males than females (1.7% to 1.5%).

In the United States, 10.2 million are estimated to experience angina with approximately 500,000 new cases occurring each year. Angina is more often the presenting symptom of coronary artery disease in females than in men. The prevalence of angina rises with increasing age, with a mean age of onset of 62.3 years. After five years post-onset, 4.8% of individuals with angina subsequently died from coronary heart disease. Males with angina were found to have an increased risk of subsequent acute myocardial infarction and coronary heart disease related death than women. Similar figures apply in the remainder of the Western world. All forms of coronary heart disease are much less-common in the Third World, as its risk factors are much more common in Western and Westernized countries; it could, therefore, be termed a disease of affluence.

==History==

The condition was named &quot;hritshoola&quot; in ancient India and was described by Sushruta (6th century BC).

The first clinical description of &quot;angina pectoris&quot; was by a British physician Dr. William Heberden in 1768.

<text>Poland is a village in eastern Mahoning County, Ohio, United States. The population was 2,463 at the 2020 United States census. A suburb about south of Youngstown, it is part of the Youngstown–Warren metropolitan area.

==History==

In 1796, Poland Township was surveyed and registered as township 1, range 1 of the Connecticut Western Reserve of the Connecticut Land Company. Turhand Kirtland was a member of a group of surveyors led by Moses Cleaveland, and is considered to have founded the community of Poland in 1798. The earliest settlers primarily originated from Connecticut and Pennsylvania. An early grist mill was built on the Yellow Creek in 1802 by Jonathan Fowler, whose family was the first to settle in the village.

Poland was named in honor of the country of Poland for its assistance during the American Revolutionary War, either due to a specific Polish hero or due to general gratitude towards the nation. An alternative legend from 1905 stated that the town instead takes its name from its original proprietor named George Poland. Poland was incorporated as a village in 1866.

Poland Seminary was originally a private secondary school, Poland Academy, and then a liberal arts college founded in 1849. Its main building has been incorporated into Poland Middle School on College Street. Its dormitory is incorporated into the Poland Public Library on Main Street.

<doc id="65866" wikidata="Q7097606" url="?curid=65866" title="Operation TIPS">
<text>Operation TIPS, where the last part is an acronym for the &quot;Terrorism Information and Prevention System&quot;, was a domestic intelligence-gathering program designed by President George W. Bush to have United States citizens report suspicious activity. The program&#x27;s website implied that US workers who had access to private citizens&#x27; homes, such as many cable installers and telephone repair workers, would be reporting on what was in people&#x27;s homes if it were deemed &quot;suspicious.&quot;

It came under intense scrutiny in July 2002 when the &quot;Washington Post&quot; alleged in an editorial that the program was vaguely defined, and investigative political journalist Ritt Goldstein observed in Australia&#x27;s &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; that TIPS would provide America with a higher percentage of &#x27;citizen spies&#x27; than the former East Germany had under the notorious Stasi secret police. Goldstein later observed that he broke news of Operation TIPS on March 10 in Spain&#x27;s second largest daily, &quot;El Mundo&quot;, but that he struggled until July before finding a major English language paper which would print the story.

In the days immediately following Goldstein&#x27;s revelation, publications such as the libertarian magazine &quot;Reason&quot;, and then the &quot;Boston Globe&quot;, emphasized the Stasi analogy, widely highlighting Operation TIPS&#x27; shortcomings. TIPS was subsequently cancelled after concerns over civil liberties violations.

== Overview ==
The program&#x27;s website implied that US workers who had access to private citizens&#x27; homes, such as cable installers and telephone repair workers, would be reporting on what was in people&#x27;s homes if it were deemed &quot;suspicious.&quot; The initial start of the program was to be August 2002 and would have included one million workers in ten US cities and then to be expanded.

Operation TIPS was accused of doing an &quot;end run&quot; around the United States Constitution, and the original wording of the website was subsequently changed. President Bush&#x27;s then-Attorney General, John Ashcroft denied that private residences would be surveilled by private citizens operating as government spies. Mr. Ashcroft nonetheless defended the program, equivocating on whether the reports by citizens on fellow citizens would be maintained in government databases. While saying that the information would not be in a central database as part of Operation TIPS, he maintained that the information would still be kept in databases by various law enforcement agencies.

The databases were an explicit concern of various civil liberties groups (on both the left and the right) who felt that such databases could include false information about citizens with no way for those citizens to know that such information was compiled about them, nor any way for them to correct the information, nor any way for them to confront their accusers.

The United States Postal Service, after at first seeming supportive of the program, later resisted its personnel being included in this program, reasoning that if mail carriers became perceived as law enforcement personnel that they would be placed in danger at a level for which they could not reasonably be expected to be prepared, and that the downside of the program hence vastly outweighed any good that it could accomplish. The National Association of Letter Carriers, a postal labor union, was especially outspoken in its opposition.

== Attempted passage ==
Both Congressional Representative Dick Armey (Republican, Texas) and Senator Patrick Leahy (Democrat, Vermont) raised concerns. Senator Leahy said that it was similar to J. Edgar Hoover&#x27;s misuse of the FBI during the 1960s when Hoover hired citizens to spy on neighbors who were political protesters. Rep. Armey included legislation in the House&#x27;s Homeland Security Bill that explicitly prohibited the creation of Operation TIPS; but Joe Lieberman blocked the program&#x27;s removal from the Senate version of the bill. The Senate, however, essentially passed the House version that eliminated the program.

Operation TIPS was officially cancelled when the Homeland Security Act was passed by Congress in November 2002. Section 880 explicitly prohibited the program.

== Terrorism Liaison Officers ==
On June 30, 2008, the &quot;Denver Post&quot; reported that 181 individuals, including police officers, paramedics, firefighters, utility workers, and railroad employees had been trained as Terrorism Liaison Officers to report suspicious information which could be signs of terrorist activity. The article also stated that TLOs were already active in six other states and the District of Columbia.

<text>Eileen Chang (；September 30, 1920 – September 8, 1995), also known as Chang Ai-ling or Zhang Ailing, or by her pen name Liang Jing (梁京), was a Chinese-born American essayist, novelist, and screenwriter.

Chang was born with an aristocratic lineage and educated bilingually in Shanghai. She gained literary prominence in Japanese-occupied Shanghai between 1943 and 1945. However, after the Communists defeated the Nationalists in the Chinese Civil War, she fled the country. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, she was rediscovered by scholars such as C. T. Hsia and Shui Jing. Together with the re-examination of literary histories in the post-Mao era during the late 1970s and early 1980s, she rose again to literary prominence in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Mainland China, and the Chinese diaspora communities.

==Life==

===Childhood and youth===
Chang was born Zhang Ying () in Shanghai, China on September 30, 1920. She was the first child of Zhang Zhiyi (; 1896–1953) and Huang Suqiong (; 1893–1957). Chang&#x27;s maternal great-grandfather, Huang Yisheng (; 1818–1894), was a prominent naval commander. Chang&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Zhang Peilun (1848–1903) married Li Ju&#x27;ou (; 1866–1916) and was son-in-law to Li Hongzhang, an influential Qing court official. She was also raised by her paternal aunt Zhang Maoyuan (; 1898–1991).

In 1922, when Chang was two years old, the family relocated to Tianjin. When she was three, her father introduced her to Tang poetry. Beginning in 1924, her father often brought back prostitutes or concubines and became heavily addicted to opium, which led to fights between her parents. During this time, Chang&#x27;s mother decided to travel with her aunt to study in France. In 1927, after Chang&#x27;s father promised to end his drug usage and extramarital affairs, Chang and her mother came back and settled in Shanghai. Chang&#x27;s parents eventually divorced in 1930; she and her younger brother Zhang Zijing (; 1921–1997) were raised by their father.

At the age of 18, Chang contracted dysentery. Instead of seeking medical treatment, her father beat her and forced her to stay in her bedroom for six months. Chang eventually ran away to live with her mother and they stayed with her mother for nearly two years, until she went to university.

===Education===
Chang started school at age 4. Chang had obtained excellent English skills besides her native Chinese. In 1937, she graduated from an all-female Christian boarding high school, St. Mary&#x27;s Hall, Shanghai, even though her family was not religious.

At an early age, under her mother&#x27;s influence, Chang began painting, playing piano, and learning English.

In 1939, Chang was accepted to the University of London on a full scholarship, but was unable to attend due to World War II. Instead, she studied English Literature at the University of Hong Kong, where she met her lifelong friend, Fatima Mohideen (; died 1995). When Chang was one semester short of earning her degree in December 1941, Hong Kong fell to the Empire of Japan. Chang&#x27;s famous works were completed during the Japanese occupation.

=== Marriages ===
In 1943, Chang met her first husband Hu Lancheng when she was 23 and he was 37. They married the following year in a private ceremony. Fatima Mohideen was the sole attendee. In the few months that he courted Chang, Hu was still married to his third wife. Although Hu was labelled a traitor for collaborating with the Japanese during World War II, Chang continued to remain loyal to Hu. Shortly thereafter, Hu chose to move to Wuhan to work for a newspaper. While staying at a local hospital, he seduced a 17-year-old nurse, Zhou Xunde (), who soon moved in with him. When Japan was defeated in 1945, Hu used another identity and hid in the nearby city of Wenzhou, where he married Fan Xiumei (). Chang and Hu divorced in 1947.

In 1956, while living in MacDowell Colony, New Hampshire, Chang met and became involved with the American screenwriter Ferdinand Reyher, a Philadelphia native nearly 30 years her senior. During the time they were briefly apart in New York (Chang in New York City, Reyher in Saratoga), Chang wrote to Reyher that she was pregnant with his child. Reyher wrote back to propose. Although Chang did not receive the letter, she telephoned the following morning to inform Reyher she was arriving in Saratoga. Reyher had a chance to propose to her in person, but insisted that he did not want the child. Chang had an abortion shortly afterward. On August 14, 1956, the couple married in New York City. After the wedding, the couple moved back to New Hampshire. After suffering a series of strokes, Reyher eventually became paralyzed, before his death on October 8, 1967.

=== Death ===
On September 8, 1995, Chang was found dead in her apartment on Rochester Avenue in Westwood, Los Angeles, by her landlord. According to her friends, Chang had died of natural causes several days before her building manager discovered her body, after becoming alarmed that she had not answered her telephone. Her death certificate states that she died from cardiovascular disease. In accordance with Chang&#x27;s will, she was cremated without any memorial service, and her ashes were scattered in the Pacific Ocean.

After Chang&#x27;s death, Stephen Soong (宋淇; 1919–1996) became the executor of her estate, succeeded by his son Roland Soong (宋以朗). In 1997, the Soong family donated some of Chang&#x27;s manuscripts to the East Asian Library at the University of Southern California (USC), including the English translation of &quot;The Sing-song Girls of Shanghai&quot; and the unfinished manuscript of the novel &quot;The Young Marshall.&quot; In 2015, Roland Soong handed Eileen Chang&#x27;s manuscripts to Hong Kong scholar Rosanna Fong (馮睎乾) for organization and research.

==Career==
===Shanghai===
At the age of 10, Chang&#x27;s mother renamed her as Aìlíng, a transliteration of Eileen, in preparation for her entrance into an English school. While in high school, Chang read &quot;Dream of the Red Chamber&quot;, one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature, which influenced her work throughout her career. Chang displayed great literary talent and her writings were published in the school magazine. The following year, she wrote her debut short novel at the age of 12.

Chang&#x27;s writing is heavily influenced by the environment in which she lives. Shanghai and Hong Kong in the 1940s were the background of many of her earlier novels. She was known for her “aesthetic ambivalence” where the narrative style and language were reminiscent of the traditional “linked-chapter” novel while the setting was more in line with modern urban melodramas. Chang also sought to probe and examine the psychology of her characters.

In 1943, Chang was introduced to the prominent editor Zhou Shoujuan, and gave him a few pieces of her writing. With Zhou&#x27;s support, Chang soon became the most popular new writer in Shanghai. Within the next two years, she wrote some of her most acclaimed works, including &quot;Love in a Fallen City&quot; (&quot;Qing Cheng Zhi Lian&quot;, ) and &quot;The Golden Cangue (1943).&quot; In her English translation of &quot;The Golden Cangue&quot;, Chang simplified English expressions and sentence structures to make it easier for readers to understand.

Several short stories and novellas were collected in &quot;Romances&quot; (&quot;Chuan Qi&quot;, ) (1944). It instantly became a bestseller in Shanghai, boosting Chang&#x27;s reputation and fame among readers and also the Chinese literary circle.

A collection of her essays appeared as &quot;Written on Water&quot; (&quot;Líu Yán&quot; ) in 1945. Her literary maturity was said to be far beyond her age. As described by Nicole Huang in the introduction to &quot;Written on Water,&quot; &quot;The essay form became a means for Eileen Chang constantly to redefine the boundaries between life and work, the domestic and the historic, and meticulously to weave a rich private life together with the concerns of a public intellectual.&quot; In 20th century China, Chang experimented with new literary language. In her essay entitled &quot;writing of one&#x27;s own,&quot; Chang retrospectively remarks on her use of a new fictional language in her novella &quot;Lianhuantao&quot; &quot;Chained Links.&quot;

In the early years of her career, Chang was famously associated with this comment:

===Hong Kong===
In 1945, Chang&#x27;s reputation waned due to postwar cultural and political turmoil. It worsened after the defeat of the Nationalist government by the Communists in the Chinese Civil War. Eventually, Chang left mainland China for Hong Kong in 1952, realizing her writing career in Shanghai was over. In Hong Kong, she worked for the United States Information Service (USIS), which promoted United States interests overseas. During this time, she wrote two anti-communist works,&quot;The Rice-Sprout Song&quot; (&quot;Yang Ge&quot;, ) and &quot;Naked Earth&quot; (&quot;Chidi zhi lian,&quot; 赤地之戀, sometimes known in English as &quot;Love in Redland&quot;), both of which she later translated into Chinese and published in Taiwan. &quot;The Rice-Sprout Song&quot; was Chang&#x27;s first novel written entirely in English.

Chang wrote &quot;Naked Earth&quot; at the direct request of the USIS. She used a plot outline supplied by USIS agents to write the book. According to academic Brian DeMare, the book is a consequence of the anti-Communist paranoia of the United States Cold War mentality and lacks the poetry and nuance of Chang&#x27;s other works.

She also translated a variety of English works into Chinese, most notably &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; by Ernest Hemingway and &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&quot; by Washington Irving. Chang&#x27;s translation of &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; was seen as Cold War propaganda for the USIS and is argued to have directly influenced her writing and translating of &quot;The Rice-Sprout Song&quot;.

She then left for the United States in 1955, never to return to mainland China again.

===United States===
In 1955, Chang moved to America, struggling to become an English writer. Her work was rejected by publishers many times. Chang&#x27;s move from Hong Kong to the U.S. in the 1950s marked an important turning point in Chang&#x27;s literary career.

In 1960s, Chang was constantly searching for new job opportunities, particularly ones that involved translating or writing screenplays. Chang once tried to adapt a screenplay for Hollywood with Chinese elements, but was unsuccessful because the agent thought the role had too much content and psychological changes. Chang became a U.S. citizen in 1960 and headed to Taiwan for more opportunities, returning to the U.S. in 1962.

Betrayal is an overarching theme in Chang&#x27;s later works, notably in her English essay &quot;A Return to the Frontier&quot; (1963) and one of her last novels &quot;Little Reunions&quot; (2009, published posthumously). Compared to her previous works, there are many more tragedies and betrayals in her writings later on in her life.

In 1962, when she resided in San Francisco, Chang started writing the English novel &quot;The Young Marshal&quot; based on the love story between the Chinese general Zhang Xueliang and his wife, Zhao Yidi, with an aim to break into the American literary world. However, due to the multitude of Chinese names and complex historical background in the book, her editor gave a less favorable evaluation of the initial chapters, which greatly undermined Chang&#x27;s confidence in the writing. With her interest in Zhang Xueliang waned, she abandoned the story. In 2014, Eileen Chang&#x27;s literary executor, Roland Soong, managed to have the unfinished &quot;The Young Marshal&quot; published, with a Chinese translation by Zheng Yuantao.

In America, Chang also wrote three novels based on her own life: &quot;The Fall of the Pagoda&quot;, &quot;The Book of Change&quot;, and &quot;Little Reunions&quot;. In 1963, Chang finished her English semi-biographical novels, &quot;The Fall of the Pagoda&quot; and &quot;The Book of Change&quot;. Both were believed to be her attempts to offer an alternative writing style to mainstream America; she did not succeed. The full-length novels were not published until 2010.

In 1966, Chang had a writing residency at Miami University in Oxford. In 1967, Chang held a short-term job at Radcliffe College. In 1969, upon the invitation of Shih-Hsiang Chen (陳世驤 &quot;Chén Shìxiāng&quot;), a professor of Oriental Languages at the University of California, Berkeley, Chang became a senior researcher at the Center for Chinese Studies of Berkeley. Her research topics include the Chinese Communist terminology and the 19th century novel &quot;Dream of the Red Chamber&quot;. In 1971, the year Chen died, Chang left her post at Berkeley. In 1972, Chang relocated to Los Angeles. In 1975, she completed the English translation of &quot;The Sing-song Girls of Shanghai,&quot; a late Qing novel written in Wu Chinese by Han Bangqing. The manuscript for the translation was found among her papers at the University of Southern California and published posthumously in 2005.

In 1978, &quot;Crown Magazine&quot; published &quot;Lust, Caution&quot;, “Xiang Jian Huan”(相見歡) and “Fu Hua Lang Rui”(浮花浪蕊), all written by Eileen Chang.

In 1990, Chang began writing an essay &quot;Table of Love and Hate&quot; (愛憎表), a reflection of her thoughts during the school days. In 2016, &quot;Table of Love and Hate&quot; was published posthumously in the July issue (Issue 155) of Taiwan&#x27;s Ink magazine and in the autumn-winter issue of China&#x27;s Harvest magazine.

==Influence==
Chang was a realist and modernist writer. Her most important contribution was her construction of a unique wartime narrative, one that deviated from the grand accounts of national salvation and revolution. She sought to recount the seemingly irrelevant details and experiences of daily life of ordinary men and women in periods of social change and violence. Chang was also known for her view of modern history, displaying colours, lines, and moods in her writing and juxtaposition of historical reality with the domain of domesticity.

During the 1970s, Chang&#x27;s legacy had such a significant impact on many creative writers in Taiwan that several generations of “Chang School writers” (張派作家) emerged, notably Chu T’ien-wen, Chu T’ien-hsin, , and Yuan Chiung-chiung.

With collective efforts to unearth the literary histories of the pre-revolutionary days in the post-Mao era, a renewed Eileen Chang “fever” swept through the streets of mainland China. The name Eileen Chang became synonymous with the glories of a bygone era. As with Taiwan in the 1970s, a group of young women authors who were clearly inspired by Chang rose to prominence in the 1980s and 1990s. Other notable Mainland China authors influenced by Chang include Wang Anyi, Su Tong, and Ye Zhaoyan.

Chang has been listed as one of the four women literary geniuses in Shanghai during the Republic of China era, alongside Su Qing, Guan Lu, and Pan Liudai. Chang has also been listed as one of the four women literary geniuses during the Republic of China era, along with Lü Bicheng, Xiao Hong and Shi Pingmei. Dominic Cheung, a poet and professor of East Asian languages at the University of Southern California, said that had it not been for the Chinese civil war, Chang would have been a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature.

==In popular culture==
Eileen Chang&#x27;s works are often adapted for screens. The best known is probably Ang Lee&#x27;s film &quot;Lust, Caution (2007),&quot; based on her novella of the same name, starring Tony Leung Chiu-wai and Tang Wei. The film won the Golden Lion award at the Venice Film Festival and Golden Horse Award for best film in 2007. Other film adaptations include &quot;Love in a Fallen City (1984)&quot; and &quot;Love After Love&quot; (2020), the latter based on Chang&#x27;s &quot;Agarwood Incense: The First Censer&quot;; both films are directed by Ann Hui. Chang&#x27;s &quot;Love in a Fallen City&quot; was also adapted into stage performances by the Hong Kong Repertory Theatre in 1987, 2002, and 2005. In 2006, the theatre took the Cantonese performance to New York, Shanghai, and Toronto.

A 20-episode TV series, &quot;The Legend of Eileen Chang&quot;, written by Wang Hui-ling and starring Rene Liu, was aired in Taiwan in 2004.

Malaysian singer Victor Wong wrote a song titled &quot;Eileen Chang&quot; (&quot;Zhang Ailing&quot;) in 2005.

Taiwanese writer Luo Yijun includes quotations and themes from Chang&#x27;s writings and life in his novel &quot;Daughter&quot;.

In 2020 on the occasion of the centennial celebration of Chang&#x27;s birth, an online exhibition &quot;Eileen Chang at the University of Hong Kong&quot; was presented on the website for the University Museum and Art Gallery, Hong Kong. The exhibition pieced together a narrative that highlights the early stages of Chang&#x27;s literary career.

<text>Qian Zhongshu (November 21, 1910 – December 19, 1998), also transliterated as Ch&#x27;ien Chung-shu or Dzien Tsoong-su, was a renowned 20th century Chinese literary scholar and writer, known for his wit and erudition.

He is best known for his satirical novel &quot;Fortress Besieged&quot;. His works of nonfiction are characterized by large amount of quotations in both Chinese and Western languages such as English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, and Latin. He also played an important role in digitizing Chinese classics late in his life.

Qian created a profound theoretical meaning for the three features of motivational nature, empathetic nature, and rational nature of aesthetic emotion for literature by deeply studying questions such as the source of emotion motivation, the ways to express emotion, and the optimal comfort in emotion in writing. He believed that the source of emotion motivation is poems because poems can convey human&#x27;s emotion. When people transfer their emotion to inanimate objects, they give these objects life, which is the ways to express emotion. Also, Qian insisted that humans cannot express their emotion as they want; instead, they should rationally control their emotion to a certain degree so that they can achieve an optimal appreciation status.

==Life==
Most of what is known about Qian&#x27;s early life relies on an essay written by his wife Yang Jiang. Born in Wuxi, Qian Zhongshu was the son of Qian Jibo (), a conservative Confucian scholar, landed gentry, and Chinese language professor at Tsinghua, St. John&#x27;s University, and National Central University (Nanking), respectively. By family tradition, Qian Zhongshu grew up under the care of his eldest uncle, who did not have a son. Qian was initially named Yangxian (; &quot;respect the ancients&quot;), with the courtesy name Zheliang (; &quot;sagacious and upright&quot;). However, when he was one year old, in accordance with a tradition of zhuazhou, practiced in many parts of China, he was given a few objects laid out in front of him for his &quot;grabbing&quot;; he grabbed a book. His uncle thusly renamed him Zhongshu, literally &quot;fond of books,&quot; while Yangxian became his intimate name. Qian was a rather talkative child. His father later changed his courtesy name to Mocun (, &quot;to keep silent&quot;), in the hope that he would talk less.

Both Qian&#x27;s name and courtesy name forecasted his future life. While he remained talkative when talking about literature with friends, he kept silent most of the time on politics and social activities. Qian was indeed very fond of books. When he was young, his uncle often brought him along to teahouses during the day. There, Qian was left alone to read storybooks on folklore and historical events, which he would repeat to his cousins upon returning home.

At the age of 6, Qian went to Qinshi primary school and stayed home for less than half a year due to illness. At the age of 7, Qian studied in a private school of a relative&#x27;s family. Due to inconvenience, he quit school a year later and was taught by his uncle. When Qian was 11, he entered the first grade at Donglin Elementary School, and his uncle died this year. He continued living with his widowed aunt, even though their living conditions drastically worsened as her family&#x27;s fortunes dwindled. Under the strict tutelage of his father, Qian mastered classical Chinese. At the age of 14, Qian left home to attend Taowu middle school, an English-language missionary school in Suzhou, after being scolded by his father, he studied hard and improved his writing level. In 1927, Qian was admitted to Furen Middle School, an English-language Missionary School in Wuxi, where he manifested his talent in language. At the age of 20, Qian&#x27;s aunt died.

Despite comparatively lower score in mathematics, Qian excelled in both Chinese and English languages. Thus, he was accepted into the Department of Foreign Languages of Tsinghua University in 1929, ranking 57 out of 174 male students. One of his few friends was the budding Sinologist and comparatist Achilles Fang. Qian also frequently cut classes, though he more than made up for this in Tsinghua&#x27;s large library, which he boasted of having &quot;read through.&quot; It was probably in his college days that Qian began his lifelong habit of collecting quotations and taking reading notes. At Tsinghua, Qian studied with professors, such as Wu Mi, George T. Yeh, Wen Yuan-ning, and others. In 1932, he met Yang Jiang, who became a successful playwright and translator. In 1933, Qian became engaged to Yang, and they married in 1935. For the biographical facts of Qian&#x27;s following years, the two memoirs by his wife can be consulted. Yang Jiang wrote, &quot;Zhongshu&#x27;s &#x27;foolishness&#x27; could not be contained in books, but just had to gush forth&#x27;&quot;. Two years after Qian graduated from Tsinghua University in 1933, Qian taught at Kwanghua University in Shanghai and contributed to English-language publications such as &quot;The China Critic&quot;.

In 1935, Qian received a Boxer Indemnity Scholarship to further his studies abroad. Together with his wife, Qian headed for the University of Oxford in Britain. After spending two years at Exeter College, Oxford, he received a Bachelor of Letters. Shortly after his daughter Qian Yuan () was born in England in 1937, he studied for one more year in the University of Paris in France. In 1938, he returned to China and was appointed as a full professor at Tsinghua University, which, due to the war, had relocated to Kunming, in Yunnan province and become part of Southwestern United University. In 1939, after Qian returned to Shanghai to visit his relatives, he directly went to Hunan to take care of his sick father and temporarily left Southwestern United University. In 1941, During the Pearl Harbor incident, Qian was temporarily trapped in Shanghai.

Owing to the unstable situation during the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War, Qian did not hold any long-term jobs. However, it was during the late 1930s and 1940s that he wrote most of his Chinese-language fiction, including &quot;Fortress Besieged&quot; and the story collection &quot;Human, Beast, Ghost,&quot; as well as the essay collection &quot;Written in the Margins of Life&quot;. After Japan&#x27;s defeat, in the late 1940s, he worked in the National Central Library in Nanjing, editing its English-language publication, &quot;Philobiblon.&quot;

In 1949, Qian was ranked on the list of National First-class Professors () and commenced his academic work in his alma mater. Four years later, an administrative adjustment saw Tsinghua changed into a science and technology-based institution, with its Arts departments merged into Peking University. Qian was relieved of teaching duties and worked entirely in the Institute of Literary Studies () under PKU. Qian is a senior researcher at the institute, and his wife Yang Jiang is also a researcher. He also worked as part of a small team in charge of the translation of Mao Zedong&#x27;s &quot;Selected Works&quot; and poetry.

During the Cultural Revolution, like many other prominent intellectuals of the time, Qian suffered persecution. Appointed to be a janitor, he was robbed of his favorite pastime, reading. Having no access to books, he had to read his reading notes. He began to form the plan to write &quot;Limited Views&quot; during this period. Qian, his wife, along with their daughter survived the hardships of Cultural Revolution, but their son-in-law, a history teacher, was driven to suicide.

After the Cultural Revolution, Qian returned to research. From 1978 to 1980, he visited several universities in Italy, the United States and Japan, impressing his audience with his wit and erudition. In 1982, he was appointed as the deputy director of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. He then began working on &quot;Limited Views&quot;, which occupied the next decade of his life.

While &quot;Limited Views&quot; established his fame in the academic field, his novel &quot;Fortress Besieged&quot; introduced him to the public. &quot;Fortress Besieged&quot; was reprinted in 1980, and became a best-seller. Many illegal reproductions and &quot;continuations&quot; followed. Qian&#x27;s fame rose to its height when the novel was adapted into a TV serial in 1990 which was acted by some famous Chinese actors, such as Daoming Chen and Da Ying.

Qian returned to research, but escaped from social activities. Most of his late life was confined to his reading room. He consciously kept a distance from the mass media and political figures. Readers kept visiting the secluded scholar, and an anecdote goes that Qian when approached by a British admirer, remarked: &quot;Is it necessary for one to know the hen if one loves the eggs it lays?&quot;

Qian was hospitalized in 1994, and his daughter also became ill in 1995. On March 4, 1997, Qian&#x27;s daughter died of cancer. On December 19, 1998, Qian died in Beijing.

== Former residence ==
Qian&#x27;s former residence, covering 1,600 square meters, is located at Xinjiexiang #30 and #32 in Wuxi, Nanjing. It was built in 1923 by his grandfather Qian Fujiong. In 1926 his uncle Qian Sunqin built five buildings and several auxiliary rooms on the west side of the back of the house, covering an area of 667.6 square meters. The whole group of buildings are typical Jiangnan courtyard houses. Inside the residence, there are some unique separate buildings, such as &quot;Haixu Shulou&quot; and &quot;Meihua Shuwu&quot;. In 2018, it applied for China&#x27;s significant cultural relics protection units. The former residence has related exhibitions and is open to the public without fees.

==Works==
Qian lived in Shanghai from 1941 to 1945, which was then under Japanese occupation. Many of his works were written or published during this chaotic period of time. A collection of short essays, &quot;Written in the Margins of Life&quot; () was published in 1941. &quot;Human, Beast, Ghost&quot; (), a collection of short stories, mostly satiric, was published in 1946. His most celebrated work &quot;Fortress Besieged&quot; appeared in 1947, but not until 1980s that it receives more attention. &quot;, written in classical Chinese, was published in 1948.

Besides rendering Mao Zedong&#x27;s selected works into English, Qian was appointed to produce an anthology of poetry of the Song dynasty when he was working in the Institute of Literary Studies. The &quot; was published in 1958. Despite Qian&#x27;s quoting the chairman, and his selecting a considerable number of poems that reflect class struggle, the work was criticized for not being Marxist enough. The work was praised highly by the overseas critics, though, especially for its introduction and footnotes. In a new preface for the anthology written in 1988, Qian said that the work was an embarrassing compromise between his personal taste and the prevailing academic atmosphere.

&quot;Seven Pieces Patched Together&quot; (), a collection of seven pieces of literary criticism written (and revised) over years in vernacular Chinese, was published in 1984, and has been translated by Duncan Campbell as &quot;Patchwork: Seven Essays on Art and Literature&quot;. This collection includes the famous essay &quot;Lin Shu&#x27;s Translation&quot; ().

Qian&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot; is the five-volume &quot;Limited Views&quot; (, &quot;Pipe-Awl Collection&quot;). Begun in the 1980s and published in its current form in the mid-1990s, it is an extensive collection of notes and short essays on poetics, semiotics, literary history and related topics written in classical Chinese.

Qian&#x27;s command of the cultural traditions of classical and modern Chinese, ancient Greek (in translations), Latin, English, German, French, Italian, and Spanish allowed him to construct a towering structure of polyglot and cross-cultural allusions. He took a range of Chinese classical texts as the basis of this work, including the &quot;I-Ching&quot;, &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot;, &quot;Verses of Chu&quot;, &quot;The Commentary of Tso&quot;, &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;, &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot;, &quot;Lieh-tzu&quot;, &quot;Jiaoshi Yilin&quot;, &quot;Extensive Records of the T&#x27;ai-p&#x27;ing Era&quot; and the &quot;Complete Prose of the Pre-Tang Dynasties&quot; ().

Broadly familiar with the Western history of ideas, Qian shed new lights on the Chinese classical texts by comparing them with Western works, showing their likeness, or more often their apparent likeness and essential differences.

Qian Zhongshu is one of the best-known Chinese authors in the Western world. &quot;Fortress Besieged&quot; has been translated into English, French, German, Russian, Japanese and Spanish. It represents an alternative strand of modernism, which has
long remained hidden and unexamined in the history of modern Chinese literature. &quot;Humans, Beasts, and Ghosts&quot; has been translated into English, French, and Italian.

Besides being one of the great masters of written vernacular Chinese in the 20th century, Qian was also one of the last authors to produce substantial works in classical Chinese. Some regard his choice of writing &quot;Guan Zhui Bian&quot; (Limited Views) in classical Chinese as a challenge to the assertion that classical Chinese is incompatible with modern and Western ideas, an assertion often heard during the May Fourth Movement. Ronald Egan argues that the work contains an implicit negative commentary on the Cultural Revolution.

==Posthumous publications==
A 13-volume edition of &quot;Works of Qian Zhongshu&quot; () was published in 2001 by the Joint Publishing, a hard-covered &quot;deluxe&quot; edition, in contrast to all of Qian&#x27;s works published during his lifetime which are cheap paperbacks. The publisher claimed that the edition had been proofread by many experts. One of the most valuable parts of the edition which demonstrating Qian&#x27;s writing ability while blending humor and irony, titled &quot;Marginalias on the Marginalias of Life&quot; (), is a collection of Qian&#x27;s writings previously scattered in periodicals, magazines and other books. The writings collected there are, however, arranged without any visible order.

Other posthumous publications of Qian&#x27;s works have drawn harsh criticism. The official writing of &quot;Supplements to and Revisions of Songshi Jishi&quot; began in 1982. In the following ten years, Qian invested a lot of energy to make extensive and in-depth &quot;Supplements to and Revisions of Songshi Jishi&quot;. The 10-volume &quot;Supplements to and Revisions of Songshi Jishi&quot; (), published in 2003, was criticized as a shoddy publication. Liaoning People&#x27;s Publishing House published Qian Zhongshu&#x27;s &#x27;Supplements to and Revisions of Songshi Jishi&quot; in 2003. A facsimile of Qian&#x27;s holograph has been published in 2005, by another publisher. The facsimiles of parts of Qian&#x27;s notebooks appeared in 2004, and have similarly drawn criticism on account of blatant inadvertency. In 2005, a collection of Qian&#x27;s English works was published. Again, it was lashed for its editorial incompetence.

The Commercial Press has, per an agreement with Yang Jiang, begun publishing photoreproductions of Qian Zhongshu&#x27;s reading notes, totaling several score volumes in both Chinese and foreign languages.

<doc id="65873" wikidata="Q504069" url="?curid=65873" title="Sweden Democrats">
<text>The Sweden Democrats ( , SD ) is a nationalist and right-wing populist political party in Sweden founded in 1988. As of 2024, it is the largest member of Sweden&#x27;s right-wing bloc and the second-largest party in the Riksdag. It provides confidence and supply to the centre-right ruling coalition. Within the European Union, the party is a member of the European Conservatives and Reformists Party.

The party describes itself as social conservative with a nationalist foundation. The party has also been variously characterised by academics, political commentators, and media as national-conservative, anti-immigration, anti-Islam, Eurosceptic, and far-right. The Sweden Democrats reject the far-right label, saying that it no longer represents its political beliefs. Among the party&#x27;s founders and early members were several people that had previously been active in white nationalist and neo-Nazi political parties and organizations. Under the leadership of Jimmie Åkesson since 2005, the SD underwent a process of reform by expelling hardline members and moderating its beliefs, building on a work that had begun during the late 1990s and early 2000s. Today, the SD officially rejects fascism and Nazism on their platform and since 2012 has maintained a zero-tolerance policy against &quot;extremists&quot;, &quot;lawbreakers&quot;, and &quot;racists&quot;.

The Sweden Democrats oppose current Swedish immigration and integration policies, instead supporting stronger restrictions on immigration and measures for immigrants to assimilate into Swedish culture. The party supports closer cooperation with Nordic countries, but is against further European integration and believes Sweden must have a strategy to exit the European Union if it assumes more power and that the Swedish people should be allowed to vote on future EU treaties. The Sweden Democrats are critical of multiculturalism and support having a common national and cultural identity, which they believe improves social cohesion. The party supports the Swedish welfare state but is against providing welfare to people who are not Swedish citizens and permanent residents of Sweden. The Sweden Democrats support a mixed market economy combining ideas from the centre-left and centre-right. The party supports same-sex marriage, civil unions for gay couples, and gender-affirming surgery but prefers that children be raised in a traditional nuclear family and argues that churches or private institutions should have the final say on performing a wedding over the state. The SD also calls for a ban on forced, polygamous or child marriages and stricter enforcement of laws against honour violence. The Sweden Democrats support keeping Sweden&#x27;s nuclear power plants in order to mitigate climate change but argues that other countries should reduce their greenhouse gas emissions instead of Sweden, which the party believes is doing enough to reduce their emissions. The Sweden Democrats support generally increasing minimum sentences for crimes, as well as increasing police resources and personnel. The party also supports increasing the number of Swedish Army brigades and supports raising Sweden&#x27;s defense spending.

Support for the Sweden Democrats has grown steadily since the 1990s and the party crossed the 4% threshold necessary for parliamentary representation for the first time during the 2010 Swedish general election, polling 5.7% and gaining 20 seats in the Riksdag. This increase in popularity has been compared by international media to other similar anti-immigration movements in Europe. The party received increased support in the 2018 Swedish general election, when it polled 17.5% and secured 62 seats in parliament, becoming the third largest party in Sweden. The Sweden Democrats were formerly isolated in the Riksdag until the late 2010s, with other parties maintaining a policy of refusing cooperation with them. In 2019, the leader of the Christian Democrats, Ebba Busch announced that her party was ready to start negotiations with the Sweden Democrats in the Riksdag, as did Moderate Party leader Ulf Kristersson. In the 2022 Swedish general election, the party ran as part of a broad right-wing alliance with those two parties and the Liberals, and came second overall with 20.5% of the vote. Following the election and the Tidö Agreement, it was negotiated that SD agreed to support a Moderate Party-led government together with the Christian Democrats and the Liberals. It is the first time that SD holds direct influence over the government.

== History ==
=== Early years (1988–1995) ===

The Sweden Democrats party was founded in 1988 as a direct successor to the Sweden Party, which in turn had been formed in 1986 by the merger of (BSS; in English: &quot;Keep Sweden Swedish&quot;) and a faction of the Swedish Progress Party. The SD continued to use Keep Sweden Swedish as its slogan until the late 1990s. The SD claims 6 February 1988 as the date of its foundation and that the party was formally registered after a meeting in Stockholm designed to bring together various nationalist movements who issued a white paper for a new party, although observers tend to see the party&#x27;s foundation as part of a complex decade-long series of events, with some even calling into question whether a meeting took place.

Initially, the party did not have a single centralized leader and was instead fronted by two alternating spokespeople before Anders Klarström became the party&#x27;s sole official chairman and head of the Sweden Democrats&#x27; national board in 1989.

According to &quot;Expo&quot;, it is generally agreed that the Sweden Democrats have never been a neo-Nazi party, although some of the SD&#x27;s early members and founders had previously been connected with Swedish fascist and white nationalist groups. Studies by &quot;Expo&quot; documented that around nine of the original 30 people who played a role in founding the SD had direct associations to known Nordic fascist organisations such as the New Swedish Movement and the neo-Nazi Nordic Realm Party (, &quot;NRP&quot;) and estimated that around sixty percent of party&#x27;s national board members between 1989 and 1995 were connected to neo-Nazi movements in various ways both before and during their time in the party. However, the study also concluded that a majority of these members were no longer active within the party by the mid-to-late-1990s. The party&#x27;s first auditor, Gustaf Ekström, was a &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; veteran and had been a member of the national socialist party &quot;Svensk Socialistisk Samling&quot; in the1940s. The SD&#x27;s first chairman Anders Klarström and deputy board members and party co-founders Fritz Håkansson and had all been active in the Nordic Realm Party. Klarström later elaborated he had briefly been part of the NRP as a teenager before distancing himself from it by the time he became SD leader. The SD&#x27;s logo from the 1990s until 2006 was a version of the torch used by the British National Front. Political historian Duncan McDonnell has argued that it is disputed as to whether the SD was explicitly founded to be a neo-fascist movement, but it was widely known to publicly align itself with extreme fringe politics and faced criticism in the late 1980s and early 1990s for attracting skinhead gangs to its public events. The SD also encountered controversy for some of its early policy ideas before 1999, which included a proposal to repatriate most immigrants who came to Sweden from 1970, banning adoption of foreign born children and reinstating the death penalty.

The party promoted concerts by the Swedish offshoot of Rock Against Communism and sponsored music of the nationalist Viking rock band Ultima Thule. Various party officials today acknowledge that being fans of Ultima Thule&#x27;s music factored prominently in their decision to become politically engaged. Early on, the party recommended international connections to its members such as the National Democratic Party of Germany, the American National Association for the Advancement of White People (founded by David Duke) and publications like the Nazi &quot;Nation Europa&quot; and &quot;Nouvelle École&quot;, a newspaper that advocates racial biology and the British neo-Nazi Combat 18 movement.

The SD won municipal representation for the first time during the 1991 Swedish local elections in Dals-Ed Municipality and Höör.

=== Moderation and growth (1995–2010) ===

In 1995, Klarström was replaced as SD chairman by Mikael Jansson, a former member of the Centre Party. Jansson strove to make the party more respectable and took a more direct stance against displays of fascism or extremism within its ranks. After skinheads started to impose on party meetings, consuming alcohol at SD events and the wearing of any kind of political uniform were formally banned in 1996. Also in 1996, it was revealed that a party spokeswoman Tina Hallgren, had been to a party meeting of National Socialist Front posing in a Nazi uniform. Opposition to the party have mistakenly mixed these two events together and falsely claim that she was wearing the uniform at a rally of the Sweden Democrats and that it was because of this that the uniform ban came about. During the early 1990s, the SD sought to become a more conventional party and became more influenced by the French National Rally, as well as the Freedom Party of Austria, the Danish People&#x27;s Party, German The Republicans and Italian National Alliance. SDreceived economic support for the 1998 election from the then called French National Front, and became active in Jean-Marie Le Pen&#x27;s Euronat from the same time. By the end of the decade, the party took further steps to moderate itself by distancing itself from all forms of fascist ideology, softening its policies on immigration and capital punishment and removing party members deemed to be too radical or guilty of inappropriate behaviour. In 1999, the SD left Euronat although the youth wing remained affiliated until 2002. In 2001, the most extreme faction was expelled from the party, leading to the formation of the more radical National Democrats which in turn resulted in many of the SD&#x27;s remaining hardline members leaving for the new party.

During the early 2000s, the so-called &quot;Scania gang&quot;, also known as the &quot;Gang of Four&quot; or &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;, which consisted of the youth wing chairman Jimmie Åkesson, as well as Björn Söder, Mattias Karlsson and Richard Jomshof continued and expanded the moderation policy, which included ousting openly extremist members, banning neo-Nazi activists from attending party events or obtaining membership, and further revising the SD&#x27;s policy platform. Before the 2002 election, former Member of Parliament (MP) for the Moderate Party, Sten Andersson defected to SD, citing that the party had gotten rid of its extreme-right elements. In 2003, the party declared the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to be a cornerstone of its policies. In 2005, Åkesson defeated Jansson in a leadership contest. Shortly after, the party changed its logo from the flaming torch to one featuring an &quot;Anemone hepatica&quot;, reminiscent of the party&#x27;s very first, but short-lived, logo (a stylised &quot;Myosotis scorpioides&quot;).

=== Entrance into parliament and ideological realignment (2010–2014) ===

In the 2010 Swedish general election, SDwon representation in the Swedish Riksdag for the first time, with5.7% of the vote and 20MPs.

In 2010, the SD leadership introduced a charter against racism on the party platform and later expanded this into a zero-tolerance policy regarding political extremism and law breaking. After some of the SD&#x27;s elected members caused controversies during the party&#x27;s first term in the Riksdag, the SD also stated it would introduce a vetting procedure for its future parliamentary candidates to exclude those who had previously belonged to any extremist groups and issued updated guidelines on conduct and communication for party members. In 2011, the party also changed its self-description from &quot;nationalist&quot; to &quot;social conservative&quot;.

Sweden Democrat MP William Petzäll was persuaded to leave the party on 26 September 2011 while still retaining his parliamentary seat. This was done because of Petzäll&#x27;s substance abuse and the problems this might cause for SD&#x27;spublic image. Petzäll later died of an overdose and his seat was turned over to Stellan Bojerud in September 2012.

In November 2012, videos from August 2010 were released, in segments, over the course of three days by Swedish newspaper &quot;Expressen&quot; (a year earlier, &quot;Expressen&quot; had released the same videos without making much noise). This came to be known as the Iron pipe scandal, although the same videos had already been released on YouTube by Erik Almqvist in 2010. The videos, recorded by MP Kent Ekeroth, featured him along with fellow Sweden Democrats MP Erik Almqvist and Christian Westling. The videos show Almqvist arguing with comedian Soran Ismail: Almqvist is referring to Sweden as &quot;my country, not your country&quot;, as an insult to Ismail. They are also shown arguing with a drunken man. A woman can also be seen approaching Kent Ekeroth while filming; he calls her a whore and pushes her out of the way. A few minutes later they are seen picking up iron bars. Coming only a month after party leader Åkesson had instated a zero-tolerance policy towards racism in the party, the release of the video caused Almqvist to leave his position as the party&#x27;s economic policy spokesperson and his place in the executive committee on 14 November. He excused himself as having been under a lot of pressure and threats of violence at the time. As more segments of the video were released, revealing the other two men&#x27;s involvement, the party announced on 15 November that Ekeroth would take a break from his position as the party&#x27;s justice policy spokesman. Almqvist and Ekeroth both took time off from their parliament seats. Sweden Democratic Youth president Gustav Kasselstrand and vice president William Hahne criticised the decision to remove Almqvist and Ekeroth in an op-ed in &quot;Dagens Nyheter&quot;, arguing that the party should not give in to media pressure.
Only two weeks after Almqvist and Ekeroth were forced to step down, fellow MP Lars Isovaara reported being robbed of his backpack and pushed out of his wheelchair by &quot;two unknown men of an immigrant background&quot;. When trying to get into the Riksdag, Isovaara was himself reported by the police for racial abuse against safety guards. The Sweden Democrats initially defended Isovaara, but backed down when &quot;Expressen&quot; revealed that Isovaara had actually forgotten his backpack at a restaurant, and that the two men had helped him when he fell out of his wheelchair. He left his seat in the Riksdag on 29 November, and was replaced by Markus Wiechel.

=== Rise in national support (2014–2018) ===
In the European election of 2014, SD received 9.67% of votes, winning two seats in the European Parliament and becoming the fifth largest party in the country. The party later joined the Alliance for Direct Democracy in Europe and the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy group.

In the 2014 election, the Sweden Democrats received 12.9%of the votes, doubling their support and becoming the third-largest party. The party remained big in Scania and Blekinge; for example in Malmö the party received 14% of the votes, in Landskrona it received 19% of the votes and in Sjöbo a total of 30% rendering the party the largest in that municipality. Other parties, however, remained firm in their decision to isolate them from exerting influence. Out of 29 constituencies electing parliamentarians, the party was the second largest in &quot;Scania North &amp; East&quot; while being the third largest party in 25. Although relying heavily on rural areas and the deep south, the party also made strong inroads and results above 15% in some medium-sized central Sweden cities such as Norrköping, Eskilstuna and Gävle, indicating a widening of its voter base in all areas.

Some time after that, Åkesson announced he would go on sick leave due to burnout. Mattias Karlsson was appointed to temporarily take over Åkesson&#x27;s duties as party leader.

On 23 March 2015, it was announced that Åkesson would return from his leave of absence to resume his duties as party leader following an interview to be broadcast on the Friday, 27 March instalment of the &quot;Skavlan&quot; program on SVT, and a subsequent press conference with the Swedish media.

Amid media coverage regarding the high immigration figures and the European migrant crisis, the Sweden Democrats soared in all opinion polls during the summer of 2015, even topping web-based polls from YouGov and Sentio in late summer, with a little over a quarter of the vote. The party also saw rising support in phone-based polls, although the swing was lower.

=== Entering mainstream politics (2018–2022) ===
In early 2018, the far-right Alternative for Sweden was founded by members of the Sweden Democratic Youth, who were collectively expelled from the Sweden Democrats in 2015. Three Sweden Democrat members of the Riksdag, Olle Felten, Jeff Ahl and former leader Mikael Jansson subsequently defected to the party.

On 2 July 2018, the two Sweden Democrats MEPs left the EFDD group and moved to the European Conservatives and Reformists Group.

In the 2018 Swedish general election, the SD increased its support to 17.5% of the vote, though it did not grow as much as most polls had predicted. According to Emily Schultheis of &quot;Foreign Policy&quot;, the SD won an ideological victory, as it &quot;effectively set the terms for debate&quot; and forced its rivals to adopt immigration policies similar to its own, and other reporters made similar observations. The SD performed particularly well in Skåne County, having the highest number of voters in 21 out of the county&#x27;s 33 municipalities. An SVT analysis of the results found that at least 22 seats in 17 city councils would be empty as the Sweden Democrats won more seats than the number of candidates it had. The party also received its first mayor, in Hörby Municipality.

Following the election, Christian Democratic leader Ebba Busch announced that her party was willing to enter negotiations with the Sweden Democrats in the Riksdag. In December 2019, Moderate Party leader Ulf Kristersson held an official meeting with the Sweden Democrat leadership for the first time, despite having previously ruled out negotiating with the party. This led to speculation that the SD could be included in a new centre-right grouping to replace the Alliance which had collapsed after the Centre Party and the Liberal Party left to support the Social Democratic led government.

In October 2018, the Sweden Democrats went into a governing coalitions with the Moderate Party and the Christian Democrats for the first time in Staffanstorp Municipality, Sölvesborg Municipality, Herrljunga Municipality and Bromölla Municipality. In Bromölla, coalition felt apart in 2020, while new coalitions with the SD emerged in Svalöv Municipality (2019), Bjuv Municipality (2020) and Surahammar Municipality (2021).

In 2020, Mattias Karlsson, the former group leader of the Sweden Democrats in the Riksdag founded Oikos, a conservative think-tank which has been alleged to be an &quot;extension of the Sweden Democrats&#x27; political project&quot;, supposedly also receiving funding from the party.

In 2021, the SD was invited to participate in alternative budget agreement talks with the Christian Democrats and the Moderates for the first time. That same year the SD also issued a vote of no confidence against the Löfven II cabinet citing the government&#x27;s handling on immigration, the economy and housing which was carried by the other opposition parties and led to Löfven&#x27;s impeachment. The SD had previously issued a vote of no confidence in the government in 2015, albeit without success.

===2022 general election (since 2022)===
Ahead of the 2022 Swedish general election, the SD attempted to form a conservative grouping with the Moderates, Christian Democrats and the Liberals and requested ministerial posts in government should the right-wing bloc form a parliamentary majority. During the election, the SD campaigned to reduce asylum migration close to zero, stricter policies on work permits, lower energy bills and a tougher stance on gang violence with longer prison sentences. Preliminary results indicated that the Sweden Democrats had seen their strongest result to date and had overtaken the Moderates to become the second largest party with 20.6% of the vote. The result was confirmed after the election.

In October 2022, the SD was allocated chairmanship of four parliamentary committees for the first time in the Riksdag with party secretary Richard Jomshof appointed to head the Justice Committee, Aron Emilsson the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Tobias Andersson the Committee on Industry and Trade, and Magnus Persson the Committee on the Labour Market. SD parliamentarians were appointed as international delegation leaders for the first time, with Markus Wiechel becoming chairman of the Swedish delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, Björn Söder for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and Adam Marttinen the chairman of the joint-parliamentary group for Europol.

The party also formed a deal with Moderate leader Ulf Kristersson to provide for the first time in their history parliamentary support to a Moderate Party-led government as part of the Tidö Agreement.

== Ideology and political positions ==

The Sweden Democrats&#x27; current party programme is based on &quot;democratic nationalism&quot; and social conservatism. The SD platform expresses that the party&#x27;s core philosophy is inspired by Swedish national conservatism and parts of the social democratic (&#x27;the people&#x27;s home&#x27;) idea. SD rejects any positioning of the party within the classic left-right scale, instead referring to itself as a &quot;value-oriented&quot; party and stating that &quot;basic social justice with traditional conservative ideas&quot;, nationalism and desires for democratic and good governance form the party&#x27;s main principles. Nevertheless, the party is often described by international commentators as being right-wing to far-right.

In policy, SD articulates its main focus to be the areas of immigration, law and order and the elderly. The party also attaches particular importance to its economic and family policies. The SD criticizes multiculturalism in Sweden and emphasizes preserving national heritage. It is also opposed to what it sees as a constant shift of power from Stockholm to the European Union and campaigns to protect Swedish sovereignty and financial autonomy against the EU. Until the 2000s, the SD used ethnopluralist arguments in its defense of a Swedish homeland and culture with its 2005 handbook calling for a &quot;high degree of ethnic and cultural similarity among the population&quot; while the party platform described the need to preserve the &quot;inherited essence&quot; of ethnic Swedes. However, since 2018 SD&#x27;s policy book has stressed a more moderate cultural conservative position by promoting a shared national identity in which foreign-born people can become culturally Swedish through strong assimilation policies.

===Political analysis===
The SD&#x27;s ideology and political identity has evolved significantly in the decades since its founding and entrance into the Riksdag. Labels for the party have consequently been a source of debate by outside observers. Nordic Studies scholar Benjamin R. Teitelbaum called the SD radical nationalist in 2013 and by 2018 said the party has since moved to the &quot;softer side&quot; of European populist parties. The party has been described by sociologist Jens Rydgren and political scientist Cas Mudde variously as xenophobic, far-right, racist or right-wing populist. French newspaper &quot;Le Monde&quot; profiled the SD as far-right and &quot;a nationalist party with fascist roots.&quot; In 2013, a Sveriges Radio journalist called the SD &quot;xenophobic&quot;, which resulted in a complaint lodged to the broadcasting regulator by the party. The Swedish Broadcasting Commission determined that this description was acceptable to use. According to Sveriges Radio in 2017, a European research agency classed the party as &quot;extreme&quot; using the Swedish political scale, arguing that the SD is more traditionalist, socially authoritarian and nationalist and less progressive compared to other Swedish parliamentary parties and described the SD as similar to the French National Rally in some of its policies. In 2022, University of Gothenburg political scientist Johan Martinsson described the SD as &quot;anti-immigration, anti-multicultural, nationalist&quot; while stopping short of labelling the SD as a far-right party.

However, the characterization of the SD as radical or extreme far-right has come under dispute in recent years by scholars and political observers. Commentator Kateřina Lišaníková observed that the SD had hardline origins through its founders and initial support network, and notes the SD&#x27;s leadership openly acknowledges its history, but argues the present version of the SD does not match the description of a radical far-right party but is mistakenly labelled as such by media or opponents who focus on the party&#x27;s early rather than current beliefs. She stated that the SD is now a national conservative party with populist elements but does not contradict democratic or Swedish constitutional principles. Similar observations were made in 2021 by Swedish political scientist Sören Holmberg that &quot;extreme right&quot; was not a good description for the SD when placed within the traditional left-right scale, since the party contains centre-left and centrist policies on some issues compared to the other centre-right parties in Sweden. Holmberg furthermore argued that while SD can be considered a right-wing populist party, the label &quot;populist&quot; has become unstable due to some of the other parties in the Riksdag adopting populist ideas of their own. He concluded national-conservative was a better term for the SD. Swedish sociologist Göran Adamson has also argued some political opposition conflate the SD&#x27;s national conservative image as being right-wing extremist, and argued the SD today is not comparable to European extreme-right or neo-fascist parties since the SD has a more liberal direction in several areas, and there is no evidence to suggest that the current incarnation of the party&#x27;s policies are fascist or anti-democratic. 

Describing the party&#x27;s political trajectory, Johan Martinsson wrote that culturally nationalist was the most appropriate label for the Sweden Democrats since the party has continued to change its ideological programs and manifestos since its founding and no longer refer to ethnic nationalism in party literature. Martinsson acknowledged that the SD had links to Nazi movements during its first years before transforming itself in a conventional political party during the 1990s and since the 2010s the term &quot;radical right&quot; is no longer accurate for the SD. Martinsson summarized that while the SD adopts populist and anti-immigration rhetoric, other parties had also adopted more restrictive stances on migration and the SD&#x27;s support for welfare state policies contrasts it from other right-leaning parties while the term &quot;right&quot; can be used as a pejorative label as opposed to an accurate description. Sweden-based British journalist Richard Orange noted in 2018 that the SD stands out due to its neo-Nazi roots but in the present now endorses more inclusive &quot;cultural nationalism&quot; over ethnic homogeny while calling for stricter immigration policies. In 2022, British political scientist Matthew Goodwin described the SD as having transformed itself from an extreme past to becoming part of a broader European family of national-populist parties which combine social and cultural conservative nationalism and populism but are opposed to fascist, anti-democratic and revolutionary ideas.

Within the party, the SD&#x27;s leadership have rejected the extreme and &quot;far-right&quot; labels and argue they no longer represent the party. SD also denies that the party is racist and that expressions of neo-fascism or Nazism among its membership are historical and no longer tolerated. Oscar Sjöstedt, the SD&#x27;s financial spokesperson, places the party around the centre on the left–right political spectrum, while leader Jimmie Åkesson has stated that they are parallel with the Moderate Party. In addition, the party has in recent years increasingly distanced itself from other European ultra-nationalist or far-right parties. In spite of this, a 2022 report by Swedish researchers Acta Publica claimed to have found 289 Swedish politicians who expressed racist or neo-Nazi views, with 214 of them being members of the SD. The SD itself has argued that some of these controversies with members have been as a result of the party&#x27;s rapid growth since the late 2000s rather than the party being extreme.

==Policies and beliefs==
=== Domestic policy ===
The party is a supporter of the Swedish monarchy playing a constitutional and cultural role in Swedish life, but also supports an amendment to the constitution that obligates the Riksdag to elect a new monarch in the event of there being no heir to the throne. In 2014 the party proposed that granting of citizenship should be contingent on declaring loyalty to the king.

The Sweden Democrats are critical of the special rights given to the indigenous Sámi people of northern Sweden. In 2008 the party accepted a motion against the rights to reindeer husbandry. They have argued that those &quot;who do not involve themselves with reindeer husbandry are treated as second class citizens&quot; and that the privileges the herders have are &quot;undemocratic&quot;. They want to restructure the councils and funds that are used to benefit the Sami population, so that they are used &quot;regardless of ethnic identity and business operations&quot;. They also want to abolish the Sámi Parliament, which claims special privileges for an &quot;ethnic minority while the society claims equal rights for others&quot;.

=== National identity and culture ===
SD values a strong, common national and cultural identity, believing this to be one of the most basic cornerstones of a functioning democracy. Minimizing linguistic, cultural and religious differences in society has a positive effect on societal cohesion, according to the party. On its platform, SD states the Swedish nation is defined &quot;in terms of loyalty, a common language and common culture.&quot; A requirement for becoming a member of the Swedish nation is to either &quot;be born in it or [...] by actively choosing to be a part of it.&quot; For these reasons among others, SDfirmly rejects multiculturalism.

In an interview for &quot;Dagens Nyheter&quot;, Second Deputy Speaker of the Riksdag and then-party secretary Björn Söder elaborated on the SDparty programme with respect to its views on national identity by saying that he personally did not think people with dual national identities in Sweden would necessarily identify themselves as Swedish. Although an immigrant of any ethnic background in theory can become a Swedish citizen, they would have to adapt and be assimilated in order to be considered Swedish in the cultural sense. Björn Söder stated that the officially recognised Swedish minority peoples (e.g. Sámi, Tornedalians and Jews) in many cases have dual cultural identities and that they probably would be proud of both heritages. It was widely interpreted that Söder had stated in the interview that Jews cannot be Swedish unless they abandon their Jewish identity. Söder&#x27;s comments were understood to be anti-semitic and caused Swedish parliamentary groups and party leaders to call for Björn Söder&#x27;s resignation. The Simon Wiesenthal Center listed the statement as number six on their list of the top ten most anti-semitic events of 2014. Söder responded in &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot;, denying the charges of anti-semitism and claiming &quot;Dagens Nyheter&quot; had taken his statements out of context.

The Sweden Democrats advocates a cultural policy that would strip funding for multicultural initiatives and strengthen support for traditional Swedish culture. This agenda has often manifested itself as opposition to state funding of immigrant cultural organisations and festivals, and support for traditional Swedish craft, folk music, and folk dance groups. The party also tends to oppose state support for cultural initiatives deemed provocative or elitist. A 2014 letter signed by 52Swedish anthropologists, criticised the Sweden Democrats&#x27; use of the terms &quot;culture&quot; (&quot;kultur&quot; ) and &quot;anthropology&quot; (&quot;antropologi&quot; ), claiming their views on culture were &quot;essentialist and obsolete&quot;, clarifying that culture is &quot;dynamic&quot; and &quot;in constant change&quot;.

The Sweden Democrats criticise modern art and have accused local councils of wasting public money on what it calls &quot;provocative&quot; art. The SD want citizens to be able to vote in local referendums on public art displayed near schools, public transport stations and town centres. &quot;The important thing is that what is expressed in the public environment is anchored to the citizens and especially the local residents who are most often in the environment so that they feel an identification&quot;, says the party&#x27;s cultural spokesperson Aron Emilsson. Sweden Democrats mayor in Sölvesborg Louise Erixon claimed &quot;There&#x27;s a big division between what the general public thinks is beautiful and interesting and what a tiny cultural elite thinks is exciting.&quot;

The Sweden Democrats also support a ban on the burqa and niqāb in public places and are against proposals to publicly broadcast the Islamic call to prayer from minarets. The SD wants tougher enforcement of existing laws against female genital mutilation, honor violence and social segregation. The party also wants Swedish to remain Sweden&#x27;s sole official language in state funded schools, government agencies and public funded media, and for more teaching of Swedish cultural history in schools. It also supports prohibiting the hijab in primary schools, arguing that while it is not opposed to hijabs in general, the choice to wear it should be made on an individual basis when a child reaches adulthood. The SD is strongly opposed to sharia law being incorporated into the Swedish legal system.

Leading party representatives have also spoken out in various contexts against mosques and Islamic centres in Sweden. In 2023, SD leader Jimmie Åkesson argued that Swedish mosques which preach &quot;anti-democratic, anti-Swedish, homophobic, anti-Semitic propaganda&quot; should be closed and demolished and expressed opposition to the construction of new Islamic buildings. SD has also argued that other Swedish parties, particularly those on the left such as the Social Democrats are willing to allow Islamist activities in Sweden to secure votes. In 2009, he also described Muslim immigration to Sweden as &quot;the greatest foreign threat since the Second World War&quot;. In January 2024, Richard Jomshof, chairman of the Justice Committee in the Riksdag, ignited controversy in Sweden by proposing the prohibition of the Islamic star and crescent. He drew parallels to the ban on the Swastika, claiming that both symbols represent something dangerous. 

==== Immigration ====
The Sweden Democrats believe that current Swedish immigration and integration policies have been a national failure and instead call for stricter immigration and assimilationist policies. In a statement filed before the Riksdag Committee on Migration in August 2020, SD claims that Sweden&#x27;s &quot;irresponsible&quot; immigration and asylum policies have subjected Sweden to an on-going &quot;long-term, albeit low-intensity crisis&quot;. The SD official policy brief states that the party &quot;welcomes those who contribute to our [Sweden&#x27;s] society, who follow our laws and respect our customs. On the other hand, anyone who comes here and exploits our systems, commits crimes or exposes our citizens to danger is not welcome.&quot;

Historically, SD sought to repatriate most immigrants and ban immigration entirely; however, these policies were moderated in the 1990s before being abolished altogether. Presently, SD positions itself against mass immigration and wishes to strongly restrict immigration and instead give generous support to those who do not want to assimilate into Swedish society to emigrate back to their country of origin and change laws to allow for wider deportations of foreigners who engage in illegal activity or are unemployed and abusing state welfare. The Sweden Democrats also call for an expansion of circumstances in which citizenship can be revoked from naturalized citizens, with Jimmie Åkesson mentioning individuals who commit crimes, welfare and visa fraud, show poor moral character by supporting violence, deliquency and terrorism or are unintegrated into society. The Sweden Democrats support raising the remigration allowance given to foreign-born residents who seek to voluntarily leave the country. The party argues that its migration policies are not based on xenophobia towards immigrants, but believe immigration must stay at a level where it does not &quot;threaten national identity, the country&#x27;s welfare or security.&quot; SD has also campaigned to restrict immigration from what it calls &quot;culturally distant&quot; countries and argues that temporary work visas should be limited only to skills that are impossible to find in Sweden. SD are against free movement of labour within the European Union, calling on Sweden to revise its membership terms of the Schengen agreement, but support free movement between Nordic nations. The SD believes that Sweden will be better able to help refugees and economic migrants in their home areas once more state funds are freed from being directed towards funding immigration into Sweden. SD also favours assimilation over integration of immigrants from non-European backgrounds, arguing that integration is a meet in the middle approach and that Swedes should not have to bear the burden over what the party claims have been reckless immigration policies. Torbjörn Kastell (former party secretary from 2003 to 2004) said in 2002 that the party wanted &quot;a multicultural world, not a multicultural society&quot;. In 2017, members of the Sweden Democrats&#x27; leadership defended comments made by then US President Donald Trump in response to Trump&#x27;s assertion that Sweden&#x27;s migration and asylum policies had led to a rise of terrorism and crime in Sweden. However, following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine the SD supported accepting and accommodating Ukrainian refugees in Sweden.

When handling asylum seekers, the party supports protecting national sovereignty in regards to Sweden&#x27;s decisions on migration and border control, as well as &quot;the principle of first safe country&quot;, meaning that asylum seekers should only be able to seek asylum in the first safe country that they arrive in. Until such legislation is realized, SD supports setting limits on the right to welfare for asylum seekers and making cultural integration mandatory. The party opposes offering permanent residency to refugees, believing that temporary residency should be the standard for those who claim asylum in Sweden. SD supports Sweden eventually accepting refugees exclusively through the UNHCR resettlement programme in accordance with a quota based on each municipality&#x27;s capacity. SD has also referred to the recommendations from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) which state that the return of refugees should be the solution to refugee problems. The party also supports giving priority to cases of persecuted Christian, former Muslim and other religious or sexual minorities fleeing war or death for apostasy believing that such individuals are less likely to be offered refuge elsewhere. Ahead of the 2022 Swedish general election, the party campaigned to tighten the rules in the Swedish Aliens Act () to the strictest possible level within European law and encourage voluntary remigration of asylum seekers and immigrants who are economically inactive or remain culturally unassimilated.

The SD also wants European governments to construct a security wall along the European border with Turkey in response to illegal immigration, terrorism and incursions by the Grey Wolves into Greece. It also calls on Europe to commonly adopt a migration system based on the Australian model to prevent human trafficking across the Mediterranean which the party states enables illegal immigrants and terrorists to reach Sweden. SD calls for compulsory measures for immigrants to be employed, live and work in Sweden for at least ten years, learn the Swedish language, go through a mandatory cultural assimilation program, and be subject to a language and social skills test before becoming eligible for Swedish citizenship. The party also supports increased spending on border patrol forces, zero tolerance laws on illegal immigration and foreign-born criminals, repatriations of Schengen Area migrants who move to Sweden to make a living from street begging, changes in the law to enable the government to strip foreign-born Swedish nationals of their citizenship if found guilty of a crime, penalties against employers who use foreign and undocumented labor to circumvent Swedish working conditions and stricter laws against family migration.

In recent years, the SDhas tried to approach the immigration policies of the Danish People&#x27;s Party, which from 2001 to 2011 provided parliamentary support for the former Danish liberal/conservative governments in return for a tightening of Danish immigration policies and stricter naturalisation laws. Following the 2022 Swedish general election, the Sweden Democrats achieved this objective under the Tidö Agreement with the centre-right Moderate, Christian Democrat and Liberal Party coalition government. In exchange for SD parliamentary support, the Swedish government conceded to some of the SD&#x27;s immigration policy demands on requirements for obtaining Swedish citizenship and expanding the deportation circumstances for foreign-born residents and asylum seekers.

Following scenes of people in Swedish cities celebrating the Palestinian attack on Israel, the SD leadership stated that those who praised the attack should be expelled from the country and that the Tidö Agreement clause on deporting non-citizens on grounds of poor character and not just criminal convictions should be used against those who support Hamas.

=== Society and crime ===
====Family policy====
The Sweden Democrats consider children raised in a nuclear family as the preferred option for the child&#x27;s development. Those not raised by their biological parents should have the right to associate with or at least find out who they were. SD has been critical of adoption and artificial insemination for same-sex couples and polyamorous people. 

The party also calls for a ban on child, polygamous and forced marriages, as well as harsher penalties for honor violence. It also supports a zero-tolerance stance against female genital mutilation within Sweden and abroad, and for perpetrators to be prosecuted or if necessary deported. SD also wants certain restrictions on male circumcision, calling for a ban on minors unless its for medical reasons. The party says that while it does support male circumcision for religious reasons, it should be performed at the age of consent and the state should not fund it through the healthcare system.

SD supports abortion being legal in Sweden and for free access to abortions for up to twelve weeks but opposes late-term abortions unless permission is given by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare. The party also calls for a law to ban abortion tourism in Sweden.

==== LGBT rights ====
The party today fully supports legalization of same-sex marriage and civil unions for gay couples but believes the ultimate decision to perform a wedding ceremony should be decided by the individual religious institution rather than the state.

SD previously opposed government sanctioned adoption to single people and same-sex couples unless the adopting party are close relatives or already have a close relationship with the child, but has since shifted its stance to permitting same-sex adoption and supports privately funded insemination for single or gay parents. Historically, members of SD have criticized a so-called &quot;Homosex Lobby&quot; but the party has since changed and moderated its position on LGBT in Swedish society. Party leader Jimmie Åkesson has expressed concerns that what he describes as the gradual Islamisation of Sweden will eventually lead to the rights of sexual minorities being violated.

Throughout the early 2000s, &quot;SD-Kuriren&quot; (the official SD party newspaper) regularly published articles criticizing LGBT events and describing homosexuality as &quot;perversion&quot;, before moderating itself alongside a shift in party ideology. A blog post claiming Stockholm Pride sexualised young children and equating homosexuality with pedophilia titled (Soon enough we&#x27;ll hit rock bottom) was published by SD Party secretary Björn Söder on 1 August 2007. The post was widely criticised in the Swedish media as an attack on LGBT people.

An unofficial pride parade called Pride Järva was organised by SD member and former party magazine editor Jan Sjunnesson in the Stockholm suburbs of Tensta and Husby, two areas with large immigrant populations. The event was disavowed by the official Stockholm Pride organisation and the Swedish Federation for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Rights; in a joint statement both organisations called Sjunnesson &quot;a person who&#x27;s spreading hatred towards Muslims on social media [and] who&#x27;s not supporting LGBT rights&quot;. Approximately 30 people participated in Pride Järva, with a larger amount of LGBT and heterosexual anti-racist counter-protestors arriving to oppose them. In 2014, the official Stockholm Pride voted to ban the SD from participating that year which was met with criticism from both within the party and from some opposition politicians who argued it was undemocratic.

In recent years, the SD has shifted its stance to being more supportive of LGBT rights and same-sex parenting by updating and expanding its policies regarding LGBT issues. In 2010, SD leader Jimmie Åkesson and party vice-president Carina Ståhl Herrstedt published an article apologizing for past homophobic statements made by party members and arguing that mass immigration risked eroding the rights of Sweden&#x27;s gay community. In its current platform, the SD states &quot;everyone must be treated equally, regardless of sexual orientation, and discrimination must be combated.&quot; In a 2018 interview, SD member of the Riksdag and gender-equality spokesperson Paula Bieler stated that homophobes &quot;are not welcome in our party.&quot; Since 2018, the SD party program was updated to support same-sex adoption and parenting.

The SD supports gender-affirming surgery as long as the motive behind it is mental wellbeing and permission is given by a medical professional.

==== Gender equality ====
SD opposes any &quot;negative or positive special treatment on the basis of gender, age, sexual orientation, nationality or ethnic origin&quot; in the labour market.

The party maintains that, collectively, there are biological differences between men and women, some of which that cannot be &quot;observed with the naked eye&quot;. Perceived differences between men and women in regards to preference, behaviour and life choices exist due to each individual&#x27;s choices and does not necessarily have to be &quot;problematic, the result of discrimination nor the result of an oppressive gender power structure&quot;.

==== Church policies ====
The party believes that the Church of Sweden should have a special position in Swedish society. In order to protect Swedish cultural heritage, members of the party want to protect the Lutheran tradition in the church elections and counteract secular party-political control of the Swedish Church. SD supports interfaith dialogue but opposes Qur&#x27;an recitals or imams delivering Islamic services in churches which the SD claims to be part of &quot;Islamizing Swedish society.&quot; The SD previously called for the Church of Sweden to be reinstated as a state church but no longer supports this policy, however they continue to support holidays in connection with religious occasions to only include traditionally Swedish and Christian holidays with party leader Jimmie Åkesson stating in a 2014 interview that he wants to protect Christianity as a &quot;system of norms.&quot; In Swedish Church Assembly election campaigns, the SD has campaigned on the issue of Christians who are subjected to persecution and hate crimes in Sweden and abroad.

==== Law and order and security ====
The Sweden Democrats support generally increased minimum sentences as well as increased resources and personnel for the police. SD wishes to instate the possibility of life imprisonment without parole for the worst crimes and to repatriate foreign citizens found guilty of serious crimes. SD also wants to establish a public register of individuals convicted of certain sexual crimes. The party also supports increased surveillance of those known to be involved in criminal gangs and terrorism. SD argues for a zero-tolerance law for people who physically attack police officers and emergency workers.

SD previously supported the reinstatement of capital punishment before dropping it as an official policy after the party program was updated in 1998, although individuals within the party continue to support the death penalty for serious crimes such as murder and infanticide and have called for chemical castration of convicted child sexual abusers.

The SD opposes allowing Swedish citizens who joined ISIS to return to Sweden and argues that anyone who joins a foreign terrorist group should be denied state funded assistance. In 2023, SD also stated that Swedes who have travelled to Gaza to support Hamas should be banned from reentering the country. SD has also emphasised a desire to crack down on abuses and crimes of which the elderly are particular targets.

In 2025, the SD supported passing stricter ownership regulations on AR-15 rifles following the 2025 Risbergska school shooting although some senior party spokespeople expressed opposition to amending gun ownership laws citing the impact it could have on farmers and hunters.

=== Economy ===
The Sweden Democrats have described themselves as supporters of the Swedish welfare state, labour rights and the public sector, but argue that welfare should be restricted to Swedish citizens and permanent residents. The party argues that foreign-born nationals must show proof of legal residence, paid taxes and financial self-support for a certain period to become eligible for welfare. In its platform, the SD claims that its economic policies are neither left or right-wing, but designed to improve conditions for small and medium-sized companies, self-employed citizens and entrepreneurs to boost employment and stimulate the economy, as opposed to what it describes as &quot;constructed jobs&quot; created by the state to reduce unemployment but hold no long term benefit for the Swedish economy or career paths for the people who work them. SD wants to abolish the Swedish Employment Service in its current form and replace it with a new authority for the supervision and close regulation of private employment services to ensure large corporations do not exploit or undercut Swedish workers. The party supports affordable and free access to public healthcare for Swedish nationals.

SD supports certain free trade conditions but believe Sweden must exit or revise trade agreements that pose a threat to Sweden&#x27;s sovereignty and Swedish workers. The party favours certain measures of economic protectionism and support state-ownership of companies that operate Swedish mines, agricultural land and produce energy or defense equipment. However, SD also support abolishing inheritance tax and reducing property tax. Since the 2010s, the SD has been critical of Chinese government involvement in infrastructure projects and trade deals with Sweden. SD wishes to lower the tax rate for the elderly, as well as increase subsidised housing for the elderly. SD also wishes to allocate additional resources to municipalities in order to provide seniors with greater food assistance and, in general, improve their quality of life. 

Political author Anders Backlund described the party as &quot;economically centrist&quot;, leaning towards economic nationalism (in contrast to the other Swedish conservative parties who tend to favour open free markets and global cosmopolitan philosophies) and supporting a mixed market economy combining centre-left and centre-right ideas, as well as promoting &quot;welfare chauvinist&quot; policies which blend national-populism with socio-economics. According to political scientist Johan Martinsson: &quot;In economic terms, the party is more centrist and pragmatic, with a mixture of left and right-wing proposals&quot;.

=== Environment ===
The party argues that, while Sweden should maintain its &quot;active role in global climate cooperation&quot;, other countries should reduce their emissions, as it believes Sweden to already be doing enough on that front. The party opposed the Paris agreement, and advocates keeping nuclear power plants as a prominent energy source in Sweden, believing it to be an efficient way to mitigate climate change. They also advocate investing in climate research internationally and funding climate action on a global scale.

==== Agriculture and forestry ====
SD supports creating a specialist law enforcement branch for animal welfare and call for stricter penalties against animal cruelty. In 2017, the SD members of the Riksdag Justice Committee filed a motion calling for extended prison sentences for those found guilty of animal abuse which was ultimately supported by the other parties. The party opposes EU influence over domestic laws on hunting, farming and forestry within Sweden, calling for such policies to be decided upon by rural Swedes instead of Brussels. SD is also critical of non-stun animal slaughter and want to ban the import of goods that contradict Swedish animal welfare legislation.

=== Foreign policy ===
==== Defense ====
SD wants to increase the number of Swedish Army brigades to seven from 2021&#x27;s two. The party has stated that it would seek to raise Sweden&#x27;s defense spending to 2–2.5% of GDP.

The party supports closer military cooperation with neighboring Nordic countries and previously opposed Swedish membership of NATO, instead calling for an alignment without full membership. However, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine the SD leadership announced it would consider changing its policy to endorse NATO membership and support joining if Finland also applied for NATO membership. 

==== European Union ====
The Sweden Democrats support close political co-operation within the Nordic sphere, but are eurosceptic and against further EU integration and cession of Swedish sovereignty to the European Union. The SD states that it supports European political and economic co-operation to secure trade and combat cross-border organized crime, illegal immigration, Islamism, terrorism and environmental challenges but strongly opposes creating an EU army or policies that could lead to the creation of a Federal European Superstate. The party generally opposes all EU regulation over Swedish tax, pensions, environmental and domestic affairs and calls for the national sovereignty and cultural identity of European nations to be prioritized above the EU&#x27;s political ambitions. SD rejects joining the Economic and Monetary Union by opposing the Euro currency and favors keeping the krona. They also seek to reduce Swedish financial contributions to Brussels, end Swedish participation in bailouts for other EU member states, renegotiate Swedish membership of the Schengen Agreement and opt-out of common asylum agreements, protect freedom of speech and the free access to the internet from EU copyright bills, and are against the accession of Turkey to the European Union. 

The party also calls for Sweden to renegotiate its membership of the EU and seeks an amendment to the Swedish constitution to make it mandatory that proposed EU treaties and financial transfers be first put to a public vote. The SD believes that if the EU cannot be reformed or attempts to transform itself into a Superstate, Sweden must immediately reconsider its membership via a referendum and prepare to leave the EU. The SD&#x27;s youth-wing, the Young Swedes (), support a Swedish exit from the EU. In 2023, party leader Åkesson and SD European Union spokesman Charlie Weimers unveiled a new EU strategy with the objective of achieving better negotiation results, increasing Swedish influence and stopping the EU from gaining more power by creating a referendum lock based on the UK European Union Act 2011 in the Riksdag to prevent transfer of powers to Brussels without a mandatory public vote. SD argues that a referendum lock should be used to prevent further EU expansion to include Turkey, Albania and Balkan states. The SD also wants a Swedish exit from the EU be made possible by removing all references to membership in the constitution.

==== Russia ====
The SD has taken a strongly pro-Ukraine position following the Russian invasion and has called on Sweden and Western governments to help the Ukrainian people defend their homeland.

In 2022, an analysis of votes relating to Russia in the European Parliament found that the Sweden Democrats were the 10th-most critical party in the parliament having voted against Russian interests 93 percent of the time. The report found that among all Swedish parties the Sweden Democrats were the most critical of Russia. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the party got rid of members who had previously expressed support for Putin.

==== Middle East ====
The Sweden Democrats are supportive of Israel and favors recognising Jerusalem as Israel&#x27;s capital and proposes moving the Swedish embassy there. A study by the &quot;European Coalition for Israel&quot; documented that SD had the most pro-Israel voting record of the Swedish parties in the European Parliament. In 2021, the Israeli government stated that they did not maintain relations with the SD due to &quot;its roots in Nazism&quot; but by 2023 had dropped its non-cooperation stance after SD representatives signed a document of principle with Israeli ministers pledging to combat antisemitism. Between 2023 and 2024, a delegation of senior SD members visited Israel to hold meetings with Knesset politicians and discuss a cooperation pact with the Likud party. The party has also taken a strongly pro-Israel position following the outbreak of the 2023 Israel-Hamas war, supporting military action to remove Hamas and calling on the Swedish government to review all funding to Palestinian organizations which the SD accuse of spending aid money on terrorism.

SD has advocated a &quot;neutral&quot; position on the Syrian civil war and sent a delegation to meet with Syrian officials in 2017. 

==== Other regions ====
In 2011, SD was the only Swedish political party to vote against Swedish involvement in the 2011 military intervention in Libya. SD also supports the creation of an independent Kurdish state and for the Armenian genocide to be formally recognised by the international community. Since 2022, the SD has participated in bipartisan efforts to give more diplomatic recognition to Taiwan and supported a motion in the Riksdag to change the name of Sweden’s representative office in Taiwan to &quot;House of Sweden.&quot; SD politician Markus Wiechel said the name change denotes that Sweden should treat Taiwan as a nation rather than a disputed territory or a province of China.

=== Internal structure ===
The Sweden Democrats are made up of 16 districts of local party associations with executive boards. Each district consists of a number of municipal associations, which may include one or more municipalities. In municipalities that are not covered by a municipal association, the party organises its members as &quot;working groups&quot; instead. The SD also has a centralized national board permanently chaired by the party leader and party secretary and whose other members are elected by the SD&#x27;s membership base.

Within the SD there is a women&#x27;s branch SD-Women and an affiliated youth-wing Young Swedes SDU which was founded in 2015. The SD&#x27;s first youth-wing was founded in 1993 as the &quot;Sweden Democratic Youth Association&quot; before it was renamed the Sweden Democratic Youth (SDU). The old SDU was disbanded in 1995 due to extremism problems before it was reconstituted in 1998. Many prominent SD politicians including party leader Jimmie Åkesson were members of the SDU. In 2015, the SD announced it would expel the leadership of the SDU from the mother party and officially sever ties with it due to ongoing controversies with its members. The party subsequently created the Young Swedes SDU as a replacement.

Following the 2010 Swedish general election, the SD created its own security unit which by 2014 consisted of an estimated 60 people. SD states that the unit is intended to handle internal issues within the party, including cybersecurity, to marshal public events and to encourage members to report external threats to the police. The SD has argued the security wing is necessary due to threats against SD politicians and highlighted a 2012 report by the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention which found one in two of every local SD politician had experienced some form of threat, harassment or physical violence, and that SD legislators were statistically twice as more likely to be threatened than members of other parties. SD reported 95 instances of threats or violence against elected officials to the police and Riksdag security in 2012.

=== Associated organisations and media ===
Since its founding, the SD has published its own newspaper which was previously known as and then until 2003. Party secretary Richard Jomshof currently serves as the paper&#x27;s editor. In 2014, the party also launched an online magazine (&#x27;Contemporary&#x27;). It is currently edited by Swedish economist Dick Erixon.

In 2020, Mattias Karlsson, the former group leader of the Sweden Democrats in the Riksdag founded Oikos, a conservative think-tank. Expo has alleged the think-tank to be an &quot;extension of the Sweden Democrats&#x27; political project&quot; supposedly also receiving funding from the party although the group itself claims to be non-partisan.

In 2020, the party also helped to launch a web based TV channel called Riks, through their wholly owned online magazine , with the ambition that the media channel should not be an official party TV. However, in a 2024 investigatory exposé conducted by TV4’s investigatory branch, , it was discovered that Riks and the SD are in a close-knit relationship with each other. For example, the exposé showed that Riks rents its office spaces from the Sweden Democrats, and that members of the SD and Riks come into frequent contact with one another, moving freely between each other&#x27;s offices. Moreover, the SD&#x27;s communications department instructed Riks to hide any connection to SD before an &quot;Expressen&quot; interview with Dick Erixon in Riks&#x27; offices. In addition to that, the programme showed that the SD&#x27;s communications department used anonymous social media accounts to artificially disseminate Riks&#x27; posts and YouTube videos.

=== Voter demography ===
According to Statistics Sweden&#x27;s (SCB) 2017 party preference survey, the Sweden Democrats (SD) have a stronger support among men than among women. There is no noticeable difference in support for the party among different age groups. The support for SD is greater among native born than among foreign born. Since 2014 the SD has substantially increased its support among both foreign-born and foreign-background voters, becoming the third largest party in Sweden also among this demographic by 2017. Sympathies are greater for the party among persons with primary and secondary education than among those with a higher education. 

A study by &quot;Aftonbladet&quot; in 2010 found that 14%of SD members were of immigrant origin, which matches the share of foreign-born inhabitants of Sweden, while their vote share in this population group has always been lower. For the 2010 election in the municipality of Södertälje (Stockholm County), SDwas the only party with a majority of immigrants on its electoral list, mostly Assyrians from the Middle East. Polling7.31%(3,447 votes), SD&#x27;smunicipal list in Södertälje got 5of the65 municipal seats. Since 2014, the SD has seen growing support from foreign-born Swedish voters, and was estimated to have become the third most popular party for voters of immigrant backgrounds by 2017. In recent years, politicians of ethnic minority and immigrant backgrounds have become increasingly active in the party, with notable examples including Nima Gholam Ali Pour, Kent Ekeroth, Sara Gille and Rashid Farivar.



==== Changes in voter base at the general elections, 2006–2022 ====

=== International relations ===
In its early days, the Sweden Democrats was known to associate itself with both native Swedish and wider European extreme-right activist groups and parties. During the 1990s, the Sweden Democrats began distancing itself from such groups and made connections with the French National Front (FN) and Jean-Marie Le Pen through his &quot;Euronat&quot; initiative and received support from the FN in 1998 but otherwise the party did not actively seek formal relationships outside of Sweden. After the party left Euronat, it became more influenced by the neighboring Danish People&#x27;s Party (DF) and by the late 2000s said it had ceased regarding the National Front as a role model and instead saw the DF as a sister party. In 2010, party secretary Björn Söder published an article disowning the SD&#x27;s older connections to extreme groups or individuals like Le Pen and said SD was more focused on Sweden&#x27;s issues over interacting with foreign parties. The party has also been active within counter-jihad networks, explicitly from 2007 to 2011.

In Europe, SD has had some contacts with the Austrian FPÖ, the Dutch Party for Freedom and Forum for Democracy, the Flemish Vlaams Belang and the now defunct Belgian People&#x27;s Party over the early 2010s. The Danish People&#x27;s Party was initially indifferent on collaborating with the SD until 2010 when Pia Kjærsgaard travelled to Sweden to help with the party&#x27;s general election campaign. Shortly after, Danish People&#x27;s Party foreign affairs spokesman Søren Espersen hosted the SD&#x27;s conference and said both parties would work together in the Nordic Council. Before the European election of 2014 there was some speculation that the SD would enter a grouping with other European nationalist parties led by Marine Le Pen. SD politicians confirmed they had had met with representatives from the proposed group but said the talks were informal. The Danish People&#x27;s Party reportedly threatened to end ties with SD if they joined the group, stating that while they were willing to work with the SD and the Dutch Freedom Party, they opposed inclusion of parties like the National Front and the FPÖ. However, after the election the SD began to distance itself from other European far-right parties and elected to become a member of the more moderate Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy (EFDD) group with the UK Independence Party. The SD was also active in the European Alliance for Freedom and the Alliance for Direct Democracy in Europe (ADDE) Euro parties with members of the UK Independence Party (UKIP). In 2016, Marine Le Pen stated that the Sweden Democrats were no longer in official cooperation with her party.

In 2015, SD began forging closer relations with the Danish People&#x27;s Party, and in 2018 announced an official cooperation pact with the Finns Party, which had previously distanced itself from the SD. All three parties are members of the Nordic Freedom group in the Nordic Council, though the Norwegian Progress Party has refused to join.

The SD maintained cooperation with the Alternative for Germany party under Frauke Petry&#x27;s leadership when both parties sat with the EFDD group and were members of the ADDE alliance, with Jimmie Åkesson describing the AfD as the SD&#x27;s &quot;sister party&quot; in Germany during the 2017 German federal election. However, Åkesson has since distanced the SD from statements made by some AfD politicians and by 2024 said the AfD was no longer ideologically compatible with his party.

Since 2018, the SD has been a member of the European Conservatives and Reformists Group (ECR Group) and the European Conservatives and Reformists Party and presently sits alongside Brothers of Italy, the Czech Civic Democratic Party, Spanish Vox party, the Flemish N-VA, Polish Law and Justice, the Finns Party and JA21 from the Netherlands. In 2019, there was discussions on whether the SD would join a new group with the Danish People&#x27;s Party headed by Matteo Salvini&#x27;s Lega Nord. However, Åkesson said SD was not invited to join a new European Parliament group and would stay with the ECR but suggested this may have been due to his party&#x27;s reluctance to cooperate with Le Pen and pro-Putin parties in Europe. In 2024, the SD sought to distance itself from Hungary&#x27;s Fidesz citing what they perceive as Viktor Orbán&#x27;s soft stance on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine and threatened to leave the ECR if Fidesz joined unless Orbán demonstrated a more pro-NATO and Putin-critical position. However, the Sweden Democrats later softened its stance against Fidesz and said it was open to working with the party in the European Parliament, but maintained it would not cooperate with Alternative for Germany and cast doubt on an alliance with the French National Rally. 

In July 2024, the Sweden Democrats formed the European Parliament &#x27;Nordic Freedom&#x27; alliance within the ECR along with the Denmark Democrats and the Finns Party, citing common stances on opposing Russian influence, reducing the EU&#x27;s intervention into the market, and a desire to participate in governments.

Outside of the EU, SD has had informal contacts with the British Conservative Party and the US Republican Party. Individual politicians of the Norwegian Progress Party have also called for more collaboration with the SD. The SD has also sought to improve and build relations with Israel&#x27;s Likud which had previously turned down meetings with the SD due to the party&#x27;s past. In 2024, the SD and Likud began official cooperation with each other.

== Public profile and controversies ==
=== Early image ===
During the 1980s and early 1990s, several outspoken far-right and Nazi advocates were involved with the party. It was founded by, among others, the Swedish Waffen-SS veteran Gustaf Ekström and members of both older Nazi and neo-Nazi organisations. In its early days, the SD also had a reputation for attracting biker and skinhead gangs to its rallies before dissociating itself with neo-Nazi and skinhead movements in the mid-1990s. The party had flyers printed by the French National Front in the 1998 general election, and was financially backed for the 2004 European election by Belgian businessman and racial conspiracy theorist Bernard Mengal. In the 1990s, the party was a member of the &quot;Euronat&quot; initiative which was set up by Jean-Marie Le Pen before severing ties with it in 1999. However, as part of the moderation process the Sweden Democrats began expelling extreme far-right members from the early 2000s onwards and updated the party constitution to include clauses against racism, extremism and criminal behaviour in 2010. Since the 2010s, the SD has also sought to distance itself from far-right parties in Europe, including turning down an invitation to join an alliance in the European Parliament with the French National Front in 2014 and choosing to ally themselves with more moderate parties during the 2014 and 2019 European elections.

=== Isolation in parliament ===
Both before and after the 2010 Swedish general election all the major parties, including the Swedish Social Democrats and the Moderate Party, declared they would not collaborate or work with the Sweden Democrats. The move was described by international pundits as an unofficial &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot;. The policy of non-cooperation was kept in place for the 2014 Swedish general election. However, at a local level other parties from the Moderates to the Left Party have collaborated or voted in favour of SD initiatives. Following the 2018 general election, which saw the disintegration of the centre-right Alliance, Christian Democrats leader Ebba Busch and Moderates leader Ulf Kristersson signaled an end to the non-cooperation policy and began talks with the SD. The policy of non-cooperation was officially scrapped by the Moderates, Christian Democrats and The Liberals for the 2022 election when all four parties signed the Tidö Agreement.

=== Media boycotts ===
The Sweden Democrats have complained about difficulties buying advertising space before elections due to the media banning the party from advertising and have accused media outlets of political bias and trying to censor or limit the party&#x27;s campaign messages during elections. This has been criticised by free speech organisations in Sweden and abroad. On 16 June 2006, &quot;Dagens Nyheter&quot; and &quot;Svenska Dagbladet&quot; decided to stop their boycott. &quot;Expressen&quot;, however, still retains a ban on Sweden Democrat advertising. During the 2010 Swedish general election, broadcaster TV4 refused to air a Sweden Democrats campaign video which depicted a Swedish pensioner being outrun by burka-clad women with prams. TV4&#x27;s decision was criticized by both free speech advocates and politicians from Denmark, including by Danish People&#x27;s Party leader Pia Kjærsgaard, Venstre and the Conservative People&#x27;s Party (the latter of whom reacted to TV4&#x27;s decision to ban the video by calling for international election observers to be sent to Sweden), and by members of the Norwegian Progress Party who called the decision a &quot;violation of democratic rules.&quot; The SD subsequently uploaded the video to YouTube where it was viewed over a million times. Swedish political journalist Hanne Kjöller argued that attempts to censor the SD in 2010 by the media and left-wing protest groups ultimately backfired and ended up emboldening their support by giving them more publicity.

=== Muhammad cartoon debate ===
After the Danish daily newspaper &quot;Jyllands-Posten&quot; published twelve cartoons depicting Muhammad and ignited a controversy during the2005 autumn and winter, the Sweden Democrats gave their unreserved support to the publication with reference to the freedom of speech. SDstated that it saw no reason why a Danish newspaper should be forced to abide by Muslim rules and prohibitions regarding expression. When the boycott of Danish products was launched in the Middle East, SDlaunched a &quot;Buy Danish&quot; campaign in support of Danish workers. In 2006 SD entered the Muhammad cartoon debate by publishing a cartoon depicting Muhammad on its youth league (SDU) and &quot;SD-Kuriren&quot; () websites. The cartoon showed Muhammad from behind holding a mirror in front of his face. However, instead of any facial features, the mirror showed only a blank head. The cartoon was captioned &quot;Muhammad&#x27;s Face&quot; ( ).

The publication attracted the attention of the Swedish government, which informed internet service provider &quot;Levonline&quot; about the SD&#x27;s publications. Subsequently, &quot;Levonline&quot; shut down SD&#x27;s web page. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Laila Freivalds, denied any direct interference. However, at the same time, Laila Freivalds condemned the publication as a provocation. Freivalds then resigned from the Persson Cabinet after being accused of interference with press freedom and lying about such actions.

This event spurred debate on government censorship in Sweden. The Sweden Democrats also had a hate speech charge filed against them due to the posted caricature. Similar hate speech charges were filed against other Swedish publishers who had depicted Muhammad. However, these charges were immediately deemed to be unfounded by the Swedish Chancellor of Justice.

The Sweden Democrats originally planned to publish a set of cartoons in their newspaper &quot;SD-Kuriren&quot;. However, after the controversy erupted, Jimmie Åkesson issued a statement on SD&#x27;s website on 9 February 2006, stating that they would refrain from further publications online and in print, due to concerns that publishing might spur hostile actions against Swedes and Swedish interests.

The shutdown of the Sweden Democrats&#x27; websites was reported to the Committee on the Constitution by the Liberal People&#x27;s Party leader Lars Leijonborg. SD filed complaints against the Security Service (&quot;Säpo&quot;) and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs with the &quot;Justitiekansler&quot; and &quot;Justitieombudsmannen&quot;, alleging that the government&#x27;s interference was unconstitutional. The spokesperson of the Green Party, Peter Eriksson, also criticised the involvement of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in the event.

=== Racist incidents and expulsions ===
The Sweden Democrats have, among all Swedish parliamentary parties, had the largest share of elected municipal representatives resign since the 2010 elections (27.8%). Many of these resignations were brought on by racist statements or actions by these representatives.

In November 2012, party spokesperson Erik Almqvist resigned after he had been caught on tape making racist and sexist statements. In November 2012, parliamentarian Lars Isovaara resigned after accusing two people of foreign origin of stealing his bag (which Isovaara had left at a restaurant) and then proceeding to verbally abuse a security guard of a foreign background. Isovaara&#x27;s replacement in parliament, Markus Wiechel, was found in April 2013 to have referred to a group of black people as &quot;monkeys&quot; in a Facebook comment back in 2011. Wiechel later apologised and stated the comment had been in reference to a video of a tribal witch burning in Africa.

In March 2013, 12 individuals were thrown out of the party for their involvement in neo-Nazi or other extremist movements. In November 2013, parliamentarian and then vice party leader Jonas Åkerlund gained attention for having called immigrants &quot;parasites&quot; during a broadcast on SD&#x27;s own radio station in 2002, after the recording was publicly rediscovered. In his defence, Åkerlund stated that he only said it to provoke people. In September 2014, the party chairman of the local Stockholm branch, Christoffer Dulny was asked to resign from his position after it was found he had previously posted mocking comments about immigrants, calling them &quot;shameless liars&quot; on alternative media sites. He also resigned from parliament on the same day.

In October 2016, a video of the parliamentarian and economic policy spokesperson Oscar Sjöstedt laughing at antisemitic jokes was released by a former school friend of his who also accused Sjöstedt of chanting fascist slogans. Whilst at a party believed to have been organized by the neo-Nazi group &quot;Info-14&quot; in 2011 when Sjöstedt was a member of the SD&#x27;s youth wing, he laughingly told a story about former co-workers with Nazi sympathies mocking Jews and comparing them to sheep. Following an investigation by the SD, Sjöstedt stated that a friend had invited him to the party but he had walked out upon discovering who had organized it and denied expressing fascist statements. During the same month, the parliamentarian and second deputy party leader Carina Herrstedt was confronted with having sent an allegedly racist, antisemitic, homophobic and anti-romanyist email to her then spouse in 2011. The email, which had been leaked from the party&#x27;s internal servers, for instance contained phrases that named black football players from the team Landskrona BoIS as &quot;niggers&quot; whilst also picturing Romani people as thieves. The email was meant to be playful and ironic, Herrstedt told Aftonbladet.

Between 2015 and 2016, various members of the party were expelled from the SD for expressing extremist or racist views, or because of disagreement with the party&#x27;s shift towards moderation and social conservatism. In April 2015, the Sweden Democratic Youth leaders were also expelled for these reasons, and the organisation was dissolved shortly after with the mother party issuing a warning for remaining SDU members to leave the youth wing or be expelled from the party. In December 2016, the parliamentarian Anna Hagwall was thrown out of the party after using arguments associated with antisemitism to argue for a bill that she introduced in parliament intended to reduce concentration of media ownership in Sweden.

In September 2017, a report from &quot;Dagens ETC&quot; found that 14 former municipal representatives of the party had infiltrated the SD in order to financially support the Nordic Resistance Movement, a neo-Nazi organisation, through financial transactions, memberships, or purchases of antisemitic and racist literature or souvenirs. In August 2018, 2 members were kicked out due to purchases of Nazi memorabilia online; following the expulsions, Michael Erlandsson, one of the SD&#x27;s spokespeople, publicly stated that people who &quot;have these types of views and share these types of materials&quot; have no place in the party and that the SD maintains a zero-tolerance stance on expressing fascist views. 14 candidates were expelled from the party as well after being exposed as former members of neo-Nazi organisations. Referring to the latest expulsions, SD leader Jimmie Åkesson declared that the party &quot;works extremely hard to keep clean&quot;.

In 2017, Martin Strid, party spokesman in Borlänge, appeared to state at a televised SD rally that Muslims were not &quot;fully human&quot; and humane. Strid&#x27;s comments were met with condemnation within the SD. Åkesson and SD party secretary Richard Jomshof described them as racist, with Jomshof stating the SD advocates ideological criticism, but not violating human rights. SD board member Aron Emilsson said that Strid would face a disciplinary meeting for violating the party&#x27;s code of conduct. In response, Strid said he had expressed himself &quot;clumsily&quot; but chose to quit the party after being given an ultimatum to resign or be expelled.

In March 2022, parliamentarian Roger Richthoff was sacked from his role as party defense spokesman and subsequently expelled from the SD and banned by the party from standing as a candidate for them in the 2022 Swedish general election after posting controversial comments on Twitter, including sharing a video supporting Russia in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine in which several antisemitic conspiracy theories were presented.

Researcher on Nordic nationalism Benjamin R. Teitelbaum described the present day version Sweden Democrats as paradoxical compared to other European nationalist parties on the issues of racism and radicalism among its members. Teitelbaum notes that in contrast to other Nordic and wider European populist parties, the SD differs by having a past rooted in white nationalism and extremism, but in the present day is comparably more proactive in rejecting ethno-nationalism and expelling members who make racist statements to the point where he considers the SD to be on the &quot;softer side&quot; of national-populism. Similar observations were made by British conservative author Douglas Murray who described the SD as undergoing one of the most significant transformations on the European political right from a party on the fringes that openly pushed extreme tendencies to a more mainstream movement that draws on diverse support. Kateřina Lišaníková argued that out of all the parties in Sweden, the SD was more likely to attract individual members who made extreme statements regarding immigrants but this was a consequence of the SD being the only party in the Riksdag willing to challenge the political consensus on immigration for several years as opposed to the SD itself being an extremist or racist party.

Ashley Fox, leader of the British Conservative MEPs, praised the Sweden Democrats regarding the party&#x27;s policy decisions on the expulsion of extremist and racist members: &quot;Over the past decade the Sweden Democrats have made progress in reforming themselves, expelling any members displaying unacceptable views or behaviour and diversifying their party base.&quot;

=== Iron pipe scandal ===

On November 14, 2012, Erik Almqvist, in addition to party spokesperson Kent Ekeroth and party official Christian Westling were filmed arming themselves with iron pipes before they sought out a confrontation with Soran Ismail, a Swedish comedian of Kurdish descent.

=== Splinter parties ===
Since the SD&#x27;s inception, breakaway parties have been formed by former SD members, many of whom were either removed from the party due to controversial actions or resigned after the SD began to ideologically shift and moderate itself.

In 1995, former SD spokesman Leif Zeilon established the Homeland Party along with other founding members of the SD after Anders Klarström was replaced as party chairman by a less hardline leadership.

In 2001, a major breakaway occurred when the more radical ethno-nationalist faction of the SD&#x27;s national board and their supporters were collectively expelled and formed the National Democrats party.

On 18 March 2018, Alternative for Sweden (AfS) was formed by former members of the SD&#x27;s old youth wing after they were kicked out of the party after alleged ties with extremist groups and for coming into conflict with the mother party. Three SD parliamentarians joined Alternative for Sweden but all lost their seats during the 2018 general election. AfS&#x27;s policies have been criticised as too extreme by members of the SD such as Henrik Vinge.

===Lobbying===
The Sweden Democrats came under fire in 2015 for changing their position on profits made by private welfare companies. Before the election in 2014 they favored having restrictions on the amount of profit that welfare companies could take and use for their own gain. Since the election, they have favored the approach of the Alliance parties, that is higher and more restrictive quality standards. This has been suspected to be because of extensive lobbying done by the organisation Svenskt Näringsliv among others. The story was discovered by the Swedish newspaper &quot;Dagens Industri&quot; on 14 September 2015. SD has denied all accusations of corruption.

===Anonymous social media accounts===
On May 7, 2024, one month prior to the 2024 EU elections, the TV4 investigative journalism program (&#x27;Hard Facts&#x27;) premiered a two-part documentary (, &#x27;Undercover in the Troll Factory&#x27;) revealing that the Sweden Democrats systematically used anonymous accounts on social media platforms such as TikTok, X and Facebook. The scoop was obtained through the use of the wallraff method where a reporter spent five months as an employee at the previously SD-owned YouTube channel Riks as well as the party&#x27;s communications department, documenting internal discussions on the party&#x27;s communication strategies. The documentary revealed that at least 23 anonymous social media accounts were actually run from SD&#x27;s communications department, spreading xenophobic content and satirical attacks on opposing politicians from other parties, including deepfake videos. According to , posts from these accounts reached 27 million views across social media platforms. SD&#x27;s head of communication, Joakim Wallerstein, repeated earlier claims that the party does not run any anonymous social media accounts. However, according to Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet, internal communication reveals that Wallerstein already in 2012 wanted to include anonymous internet campaigns as part of the party&#x27;s strategy.

In an official response from the Sweden Democrats&#x27; leader Jimmie Åkesson, the documentary was dismissed as a &quot;gigantic, domestic influence operation by the left-liberal establishment&quot;. In numerous interviews, SD representatives toned down the content posted on the anonymous accounts as simple satire and humor material. Following the documentary, and the party&#x27;s response to it, SD received massive criticism from all other Swedish parliamentary parties. The government parties accused SD of not following the Tidö Agreement, which contains a clause about showing respect towards other parties. After a meeting on May 16, SD agreed that some of the anonymous accounts&#x27; posts went against the agreement and agreed to delete 45 posts. They did not agree to stop running anonymous accounts but said they would use a softer tone towards parties in the Tidö coalition.
