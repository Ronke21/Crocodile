<text>Derbyshire ( ) is a ceremonial county in the East Midlands of England. It borders Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire, and South Yorkshire to the north, Nottinghamshire to the east, Leicestershire to the south-east, Staffordshire to the south and west, and Cheshire to the west. Derby is the largest settlement, and Matlock is the county town.

The county has an area of and a population of 1,053,316. The east of the county is more densely populated than the west, and contains the county&#x27;s largest settlements: Derby (261,400), Chesterfield (88,483), and Swadlincote (45,000). For local government purposes Derbyshire comprises a non-metropolitan county, with eight districts, and the Derby unitary authority area. The East Midlands Combined County Authority includes Derbyshire County Council and Derby City Council.

The north and centre of Derbyshire are hilly and contain the southern end of the Pennines, most of which are part of the Peak District National Park. They include Kinder Scout, at the highest point in the county. The River Derwent is the longest in the county, at , and flows south until it meets the River Trent just south of Derby. Church Flatts Farm at Coton in the Elms, near Swadlincote, is the furthest point from the sea in the UK.

==History==

The area that is now Derbyshire was first visited, probably briefly, by humans 200,000 years ago during the Aveley interglacial, as shown by a Middle Paleolithic Acheulean hand axe found near Hopton. Further occupation came with the Upper Paleolithic and Neolithic periods of the Stone Age when Mesolithic hunter-gatherers roamed the hilly tundra.
Evidence of these nomadic tribes has been found in limestone caves located on the Nottinghamshire border. Deposits left in the caves date the occupancy at around 12,000 to 7,000 BCE.
Burial mounds of Neolithic settlers are also situated throughout the county. These chambered tombs were designed for collective burial and are mostly located in the central Derbyshire region. There are tombs at Minninglow and Five Wells that date back to between 2000 and 2500 BCE. 5 kilometres west of Youlgreave lies the Neolithic henge monument of Arbor Low, which has been dated to 2500 BCE. It is not until the Bronze Age that real signs of agriculture and settlement are found in the county. In the moors of the Peak District signs of clearance, arable fields and hut circles were found after archaeological investigation. However this area and another settlement at Swarkestone are all that have been found.

During the Roman conquest of Britain, the invaders were attracted to Derbyshire for its lead ore in the limestone hills of the area. They settled throughout the county, with forts built near Brough in the Hope Valley and near Glossop. Later they settled round Buxton, famed for its warm springs, and set up a fort near modern-day Derby in an area now known as Little Chester.

Several kings of Mercia are buried in the Repton area.

Following the Norman Conquest, much of the county was subject to the forest laws. To the northwest was the Forest of High Peak under the custodianship of William Peverel and his descendants. The rest of the county was bestowed upon Henry de Ferrers, a part of it becoming Duffield Frith. In time the whole area was given to the Duchy of Lancaster. Meanwhile, the Forest of East Derbyshire covered the whole county to the east of the River Derwent from the reign of Henry II to that of Edward I.

==Geography==
The terrain of Derbyshire mostly consists of uplands to the north and centre of the county, and lowlands to the south and east. The southern foothills and uplands of the Pennines extend from the north of the Trent Valley throughout the Peak District and into the north of the county, reaching the county&#x27;s highest point at Kinder Scout. The terrain is relatively low-lying across the lower Dove Valley, from the Trent Valley and southwards, the far south of the Derwent Valley and near its eastern borders with Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire. The main rivers in the county are the River Derwent and the River Dove which both join the River Trent in the south. The River Derwent rises in the moorland of Bleaklow and flows throughout the Peak District and county for the majority of its course, while the River Dove rises in Axe Edge Moor and forms a boundary between Derbyshire and Staffordshire for most of its length.

===Landscape character===
The varied landscapes within Derbyshire have been formed mainly as a consequence of the underlying geology, but also by the way the land has been managed and shaped by human activity. The county contains 11 discrete landscape types, known as National Character Areas, which have been described in detail by Natural England and further refined, mapped and described by Derbyshire County Council and the Peak District National Park.

The 11 National Character Areas found within Derbyshire are:
*Dark Peak
*White Peak
*South West Peak
*Derbyshire Peak Fringe and Lower Derwent
*Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and Yorkshire Coalfield
*Southern Magnesian Limestone
*Needwood and South Derbyshire Claylands
*Trent Valley Washlands
*Melbourne Parklands
*Leicestershire &amp; South Derbyshire Coalfield
*Mease/Sence Lowlands

===Geology===
Derbyshire&#x27;s solid geology can be split into two very different halves. The oldest rocks occur in the northern, more upland half of the county, and are mostly of Carboniferous age, comprising limestones, gritstones, sandstones and shales. In its north-east corner to the east of Bolsover, there are also Magnesian Limestone rocks of Permian age. In contrast, the southern and more lowland half of Derbyshire contains much softer rocks, mainly mudstones and sandstones of Permo-Triassic age, which create gentler, more rolling landscapes with few rock outcrops. Across both regions can be found drift deposits of Quaternary age – mainly terrace and river gravel deposits and boulder clays. Landslip features are found on unstable layers of sandstones and shales, with Mam Tor and Alport Castles being the best-known. Cemented screes and tufa deposits occur very rarely in the limestone dales and rivers, whilst cave systems have been created naturally in the limestone since Pleistocene times. A recently discovered cave chamber near Castleton, named Titan, is the deepest shaft and biggest chamber of any cave in Britain.

The oldest rocks are Lower Carboniferous limestones of Dinantian age, which form the core of the White Peak within the Peak District National Park. Because northern Derbyshire is effectively an uplifted dome of rock layers that have subsequently eroded to expose older rocks in the centre of the Derbyshire Dome, these are encircled by progressively younger limestone rocks, until they in turn give way on three sides to Upper Carboniferous shales, gritstones and sandstones of Namurian age.
Younger still are the sandstones, shales and coal deposits found on the eastern flank of Derbyshire, forming the coal measures, which are of Westphalian age. All these rock layers disappear south of a line drawn between Ashbourne and Derby under layers of clays and sandstones (Mercia Mudstone Group and Sherwood Sandstones) of Permo-Triassic age. Small amounts of carboniferous limestones, gritstones and coal measures reappear in the far south of Derbyshire from Ticknall (limestone) to Swadlincote (coal measures).

Some areas of the White Peak exhibit contemporaneous basalt flows (e.g. Ravens Tor at Millers Dale), as well as subsequent dolerite sill intrusion at a much later stage (e.g. near Tideswell Dale), whilst mineralisation of the carboniferous limestone in a subsequent period created extensive lead and fluorite deposits which have formed a significant part of Derbyshire&#x27;s economy, as did coal mining. Lead mining has been important here since Roman Times. The more recent river gravels of the Trent valley remain a significant extractive industry today in south Derbyshire, as does the mining of limestone rock in central and northern parts of the county. Coarse sandstones were once extensively quarried both for local building materials and for the production of gritstone grinding wheels for use in mills, and both former industries have left their mark on the Derbyshire landscape.

===Green belts===

As well as the protections afforded to the Peak District area under national and local policies, there are several green belts within the county, aimed at preserving the landscape surrounding main urban areas. There are four such areas, the first three being portions of much larger green belts that extend outside the county and surround large conurbations:
==Ecology==
Because of its central location in England and altitude range from 27 metres in the south to 636 metres in the north, Derbyshire contains many species at the edge of their UK distribution ranges. Some species with a predominantly northern British distribution are at the southern limit of their range, whilst others with a more southern distribution are at their northern limit in Derbyshire. As climate change progresses, a number of sensitive species are now being seen to be either expanding or contracting their range as a result.
For the purposes of protecting and recording the county&#x27;s most important habitats, Derbyshire has been split into two regions, each with its own Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP), based around National Character Areas. The Peak District BAP includes all of Derbyshire&#x27;s uplands of the Dark Peak, South-West Peak and White Peak, including an area of limestone beyond the national park boundary. The remaining areas are monitored and recorded in the Lowland Derbyshire Biodiversity Action Plan, which subdivides the landscape into eight smaller Action Areas.

The Derbyshire Biological Records Centre was formerly based at Derby Museum and Art Gallery, but since 2011 has been managed by Derbyshire Wildlife Trust. Two of Englands 48 Local Nature Partnerships (LNP) also cover Derbyshire; these are the Peak District LNP and the Lowland Derbyshire &amp; Nottinghamshire LNP.

===Botany===
Since 2002, the county flower for Derbyshire has been Jacob&#x27;s-ladder (&quot;Polemonium caeruleum&quot;), a relatively rare species, and characteristic of certain limestone dales in the White Peak. Derbyshire is known to have contained 1,919 separate taxa of vascular plants (including species, hybrids and micro-species) since modern recording began, of which 1,133 are known to be either native or archaeophyte, the remainder being non-native species. These comprise 336 established species, 433 casuals and 17 unassigned. It is known that 34 species of plants once native here have been lost from Derbyshire (i.e. become locally extinct) since modern plant recording began in the 17th century. Derbyshire contains two endemic vascular plants, found nowhere else in the world: &quot;Rubus durescens&quot;, a bramble occurring in central Derbyshire, and Derby hawkweed (&quot;Hieracium naviense&quot;), still known only from Winnats Pass. One endemic species of moss, Derbyshire Feather Moss, occurs in one small 3-metre patch in just one Derbyshire limestone dale, its sole world location intentionally kept confidential.

The distribution and status of vascular plants in Derbyshire have been recorded over the last 120 years in a series of four major botanical works, each by different authors between 1889 and 2015, all entitled &quot;The Flora of Derbyshire&quot;. Plant recording is mainly undertaken locally by volunteers from the Derbyshire Flora Group, and by staff at Derbyshire Wildlife Trust and the Peak District National Park.
The Dark Peak is marked by heathlands, bogs, gritstone edges and acid grasslands containing relatively few species, with plants such as heather (&quot;Calluna vulgaris&quot;), crowberry (&quot;Empetrum nigrum&quot;), bilberry (&quot;Vaccinium myrtillus&quot;) and hare&#x27;s-tail cotton grass (&quot;Eriophorum vaginatum&quot;) being dominant on the high moors. The dales of the White Peak are known for habitats such as calcareous grassland, ash woodlands and rock outcrops in all of which a much greater richness of lime-loving species occurs than elsewhere in the county. These include various orchids (such as early purple orchid (&quot;Orchis mascula&quot;), dark-red helleborine (&quot;Epipactis atrorubens&quot;) and fly orchid (&quot;Ophrys insectifera&quot;)), common rockrose (&quot;Helianthemum nummularium&quot;), spring cinquefoil (&quot;Helianthemum nummularium&quot;) and grass of parnassus (&quot;Parnassia palustris&quot;). Specialised communities of plants occur on former lead workings, where typical metallophyte species include spring sandwort (&quot;Minuartia verna&quot;), alpine penny-cress (&quot;Thlaspi caerulescens&quot;) (both known locally in Derbyshire as Leadwort), as well as mountain pansy (&quot;Viola lutea&quot;) and moonwort (&quot;Botrychium lunaria&quot;).

In 2015, Derbyshire contained 304 vascular plant species now designated as of international, national or local conservation concern, for their rarity or recent declines, and collectively listed as Derbyshire Red Data plants. Work on recording and publishing a bryophyte flora for Derbyshire still continues: by 2012 a total of 518 bryophyte species had been recorded for the county.

Botanical recording in the UK predominantly uses the unchanging vice-county boundary system, which results in a slightly different map of Derbyshire from the modern geographic county.

===Zoology===
A number of specialist organisations protect, promote and monitor records of individual animal groups across Derbyshire. The main ones are Derbyshire Ornithological Society; Derbyshire Mammal Group; Derbyshire Bat Group, Derbyshire Amphibian and Reptile Group, and the Derbyshire &amp; Nottingham Entomological Society. All maintain databases of wildlife sightings, whilst some such as the Derbyshire Ornithological Society provide alerts of rare sightings on their websites or social media pages and also publish major works describing the status and distribution of species.

==Economy==
Derbyshire has a mixture of a rural economy in the west, with a former coal-mining economy in the north-east (Bolsover district), the Erewash Valley around Ilkeston and in the south around Swadlincote. The rural landscape varies from arable farmland in the flatlands to the south of Derby, to upland pasture and moorland in the high gritstone uplands of the southern Pennines.

Derbyshire is rich in natural mineral resources such as lead, iron, coal, and limestone, which have been exploited over a long period. Lead, for example, has been mined since Roman times. The limestone outcrops in the central area led to the establishment of large quarries to supply the industries of surrounding towns with lime for building and steelmaking, and latterly in the 20th-century cement manufacture. The Industrial Revolution also increased demand for building stone, and in the late 19th and early 20th-century, the arrival of the railways led to a large number of stone quarries being established. This industry has left its mark on the countryside, but is still a major industry: a lot of the stone is supplied as crushed stone for road building and concrete manufacture, and is moved by rail.
Derbyshire&#x27;s relative remoteness in the late 18th century and an abundance of fast-flowing streams led to a proliferation of the use of hydropower at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, following the mills pioneered by Richard Arkwright. Derbyshire has been said to be the home of the Industrial Revolution, and part of the Derwent Valley has been given World Heritage status in acknowledgement of this historic importance.

Nationally famous companies in Derbyshire include Rolls-Royce, one of the world&#x27;s leading aerospace companies, based since before World War I in Derby, Thorntons just south of Alfreton and Toyota, who have one of the UK&#x27;s largest car manufacturing plants at Burnaston. Ashbourne Water used to be bottled in Buxton by Nestlé Waters UK until 2006 and Buxton Water still is.

Derbyshire is one of only three counties permitted to make cheese that is labelled as Stilton cheese. The others are Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire. The smallest of six companies making this product is Hartington Creamery at Pikehall. As of March 2021, Hartington Stilton was marketing within the UK but also exporting to the US, EU and Canada. The company director told the BBC that they had &quot;a surge in interest and consumer sales from the US&quot;.

==Governance==
The county is divided into eleven constituencies for the election of members of parliament (MPs) to the House of Commons. In the 2024 United Kingdom general election, all seats in Derbyshire were won by the Labour Party, including the seat of Derbyshire Dales, a Conservative safe seat that had not been won by Labour since the 1945 election.

Shown below are the vote and seat count at the 2019 election compared to the 2024 election:


Derbyshire has a three-tier local government since the local government reorganisation in 1974. It has a county council based in Matlock and eight district councils and since 1997, a unitary authority area of the City of Derby. Derby remains part of Derbyshire only for ceremonial purposes.

Derbyshire has become fractionally smaller during government reorganisation over the years. The Sheffield suburbs Woodseats, Beauchief, Handsworth, Woodhouse, Norton, Mosborough, Totley, Bradway and Dore were previously parts of the county, but were lost to Sheffield between 1900 and 1933; Mosborough was transferred in 1967. However, Derbyshire gained part of the Longdendale valley and Tintwistle from Cheshire in 1974. The current area of the geographic/ceremonial county of Derbyshire is only 4.7 square kilometres less than it was over 100 years ago.

At the third tier are the parish councils, which do not cover all areas. The eight district councils in Derbyshire and the unitary authority of Derby are shown in the map above.

These district councils are responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning are the responsibility of the County Council.
Although Derbyshire is in the East Midlands, some parts, such as High Peak (which incorporated former areas of Cheshire after boundary changes in 1974), are closer to the northern cities of Manchester and Sheffield and these receive services more affiliated with northern England; for example, the North West Ambulance Service, Granada Television and United Utilities.Outside the main city of Derby, the largest town in the county is Chesterfield.

Derbyshire is also part of multiple combined authorities. The Erewash, Amber Valley and Derby districts are part of the D2N2 partnership with neighbouring Nottinghamshire. The Derbyshire Dales, Bolsover, North East Derbyshire and Chesterfield districts are part of the South Yorkshire Mayoral Combined Authority (as non constituent members).

Derbyshire County Council and Derby City Council are part of the East Midlands Combined Authority, and elected the first Mayor of the East Midlands in the 2024 East Midlands Mayoral Election.

==Education==
The Derbyshire school system is comprehensive with no selective schools. The independent sector includes Repton School, Trent College and The Elms School.

Derbyshire is home to the University of Derby, and the University of Nottingham Medical School.

==Settlements==
There are several towns in the county, with Derby the largest and most populous. At the time of the 2011 census, a population of 770,600 lived in the county with 248,752 (32%) living in Derby.

Although Derbyshire is officially part of the East Midlands statistical region, parts of the county are often considered to be culturally in Northern England, such as Chesterfield and Glossop.

The table below shows all towns with over 10,000 inhabitants.
===Historic areas===

During a series of administrative boundary changes during the 20th century, settlements which were historically part of the county now fall under the administrative areas of Greater Manchester, South Yorkshire, and Staffordshire:
Numerous other boundary changes also took place during the course of the 19th century, with county settlements being ceded to the counties of Staffordshire and Leicestershire

==Media==
Because of the size of the county, southern parts of Derbyshire such as Derby, Matlock, Ashbourne and Bakewell are covered by BBC East Midlands and ITV Central in Nottingham, broadcast from Waltham.
Northeast Derbyshire, Chesterfield, the eastern High Peak (Hope Valley) and northern area of the Derbyshire Dales (Tideswell and Hathersage) are covered by ITV Yorkshire and BBC Yorkshire from Emley Moor, with their ITV News Calendar and &quot;Look North&quot; programmes, both from Leeds. The western area of the High Peak (Buxton, Glossop, New Miils and Chapel-en-le-Frith) is covered by BBC North West from Winter Hill and ITV Granada, both based in Salford.

BBC Local Radio for the county is provided by BBC Radio Derby, BBC Radio Sheffield (covering Chesterfield and Bolsover) and BBC Radio Manchester (covering Glossop, New Miils and Chapel-en-le-Frith).

County-wide commercial radio stations are Capital Midlands, Hits Radio East Midlands, Gold, Greatest Hits Radio East Midlands and Greatest Hits Radio Yorkshire (for Chesterfield, Matlock and Bakewell).

==Sport==
Derbyshire has two Football League teams, Derby County, which plays in the EFL Championship, the second tier of English football. The next highest-placed team is Chesterfield, which participates in EFL League Two, the fourth tier of English football. There are also many non-league teams playing throughout the county, most notably Alfreton Town, which plays in the National League North. The county is currently home to the world&#x27;s oldest football club, Sheffield F.C., which plays in Dronfield in north-east Derbyshire. Glossop was the smallest town in the country to have a football team in the top tier of English football, Glossop North End.
Derbyshire has a cricket team based at the County Cricket Ground. Derbyshire County Cricket Club currently plays in Division Two of the County Championship. There are also rugby league clubs based in the north of the county, the North Derbyshire Chargers and in Derby (Derby City RLFC). The county has numerous rugby union clubs, including Derby, Chesterfield Panthers, Matlock, Ilkeston, Ashbourne, Bakewell and Amber Valley.

The county is a popular area for a variety of recreational sports such as rock climbing, hill walking, hang gliding, caving, sailing on its many reservoirs, and cycling along the many miles of disused rail tracks that have been turned into cycle trails, such as the Monsal Trail and High Peak Trail.

The town of Ashbourne in Derbyshire is known for its Royal Shrovetide Football, described as a &quot;medieval football game&quot;, played annually on Shrove Tuesday and Ash Wednesday.

Derbyshire is host to one of the only community Muggle quidditch teams in the country, known as Derby Union Quidditch Club. The Club recruits players from the age of 16 upwards from all over Derby, and has representatives from most local sixth forms and the University of Derby. The team has competed against both the Leeds Griffins and the Leicester Lovegoods in the past and is part of the vibrant UK quidditch scene. It is also an official International Quidditch Association team.

==Local attractions==

The county of Derbyshire has many attractions for tourists and local people. It offers Peak District scenery such as Mam Tor and Kinder Scout, and more urban attractions such as Bakewell, Buxton and Derby. Such places include Bolsover Castle, Castleton, Chatsworth House, National Tramway Museum at Crich, Peak Rail steam railway, Midland Railway steam railway, Dovedale, Haddon Hall, the Heights of Abraham and Matlock Bath.

In the north of the county, three large reservoirs, Howden, Derwent and Ladybower, were built in the early part of the 20th century to supply the rapidly growing populations of Sheffield, Derby and Leicester with drinking water. The moorland catchment area around these is part of the Peak District National Park and extensively used for leisure pursuits such as walking and cycling.

There are many properties and lands in the care of the National Trust that are open to the public, such as Calke Abbey, Hardwick Hall, High Peak Estate, Ilam Park, Kedleston Hall, Longshaw Estate near Hathersage, and Sudbury Hall on the Staffordshire border.

Notable gardens in Derbyshire include the formal ones in 17th–18th-century French style at Melbourne Hall south of Derby, the listed garden at Renishaw Hall near Eckington, Lea Rhododendron Gardens near Matlock, the Royal Horticultural Society recommended Bluebell Arboretum near Swadlincote, and the extensive gardens at Chatsworth House.

Ardotalia, also known as Melandra, or Melandra Castle, is an ancient Roman fort built in the north-west of the county. The ruins and foundations are open free of charge to the public.

==County emblems==

As part of a 2002 marketing campaign, the plant conservation charity Plantlife chose the Jacob&#x27;s-ladder as the county flower.

In September 2006, a proposal for a county flag was introduced, largely on the initiative of BBC Radio Derby. It consists of a white-bordered dark green cross encompassing a golden Tudor rose (a historical symbol of the county) all set in a blue field. The blue field represents the many waters of the county, its rivers and reservoirs, while the cross is green to mark the great areas of countryside. The flag was subsequently registered with the Flag Institute in September 2008.

In 2015, BBC Radio Derby commissioned a Derbyshire anthem entitled &quot;Our Derbyshire&quot;, including lyrics suggested by its listeners. It received its first performance on 17 September 2015 at Derby Cathedral.
==Demographics==
In 1801 the population was 147,481 According to the UK Census 2001 there were 956,301 people spread over the county&#x27;s 254,615 hectares. This was estimated to have risen to 990,400 in 2006.

The county&#x27;s population grew by 3.0 per cent from 1991 to 2001 which is around 21,100 people. This figure is higher than the national average of 2.65 per cent, but lower than the East Midlands average of 4.0 per cent. The county as a whole has an average population density of 2.9 people per hectare, making it less densely populated than England as a whole. The density varies throughout the county, with the lowest being in the region of Derbyshire Dales at 0.88 per hectare, and the highest outside the main cities in the region of Erewash, which has 10.04 people per hectare.
==In literature and popular culture==

The 1969 film &quot;Women in Love&quot; by Ken Russell had scenes filmed in and around Elvaston Castle, notably the Greco-Roman wrestling scene, which was filmed in the castle&#x27;s Great Hall.

The 1988 film &quot;The Lair of the White Worm&quot; by Ken Russell, (starring Amanda Donohoe and Hugh Grant) was filmed largely in Derbyshire. &quot;Lair&#x27;s&quot; opening title sequence and primary story locations occur in and around Thor&#x27;s Cave, part of the Peak District, River Manifold valley.

The 2008 film &quot;The Duchess&quot; includes scenes filmed at Chatsworth House and at Kedleston Hall.

The 1993–2002 TV series &quot;Peak Practice&quot; was set in Crich and Fritchley, except for the twelfth and final series, and originally starred Kevin Whately and Amanda Burton. In 2003, an unrelated and less successful medical TV drama, &quot;Sweet Medicine&quot;, was mostly filmed in the historic market town of Wirksworth.

Other Derbyshire locations in which British TV scenes have been filmed include:
*Alderwasley: &quot;Stig of the Dump&quot;
*Ashbourne and Vernon Street in Derby: &quot;Nanny&quot;
*Chesterfield: The twisted spire of Church of St Mary and All Saints, Chesterfield, was made famous by its use in the opening credits of the 1966–1971 ecclesiastical BBC TV sitcom &quot;All Gas and Gaiters&quot;, featuring Derek Nimmo.
*Hadfield: &quot;The League of Gentlemen&quot;
*The Peak District is the scene of a series of four crime novels of the 21st century by Sarah Ward: &quot;Bitter Chill&quot; (2015), &quot;The Shrouded Path&quot; (2020), &quot;A Deadly Thaw&quot; and &quot;A Patient Fury&quot;.
*Repton and especially Repton School: &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot; (in both 1939 and 1983 versions)
*Shirebrook: &quot;The Full Monty&quot;
*Wingfield Manor: 1980s BBC TV series of &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;

<doc id="71071" wikidata="Q484556" url="?curid=71071" title="Salt Lake County, Utah">
<text>Salt Lake County is located in the U.S. state of Utah. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 1,185,238, making it the most populous county in Utah. Its county seat and largest city is Salt Lake City, the state capital. The county was created in 1850. Salt Lake County is the 37th most populated county in the United States and is one of four counties in the Rocky Mountains to make it into the top 100. (Others being Denver County and El Paso County, Colorado and Clark County, Nevada.) Salt Lake County has been the only county of the first class in Utah – under the Utah Code (Title 17, Chapter 50, Part 5) is a county with a population of 700,000 or greater. Although, Utah County directly to the south has recently reached this threshold. 

Salt Lake County occupies the Salt Lake Valley, as well as parts of the surrounding mountains, the Oquirrh Mountains to the west and the Wasatch Range to the east (essentially the entire Jordan River watershed north of the Traverse Mountains). In addition, the northwestern section of the county includes part of the Great Salt Lake. The county is noted for its ski resorts; Salt Lake City hosted the 2002 Winter Olympics. Salt Lake County is the central county of the Salt Lake City metropolitan area. Sustained drought in Utah has more recently strained Salt Lake County&#x27;s water security and has caused the Great Salt Lake level to drop to record low levels.

==History==
This area was occupied for thousands of years by cultures of indigenous peoples.

===19th century===
The future Salt Lake County area was settled by European Americans in 1847 when Mormon pioneers of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints fled religious persecution in the East. They arrived in the Salt Lake Valley after descending what settlers later called Emigration Canyon. Brigham Young, their leader, declared &quot;This is the place&quot; after seeing the valley. Compared to eastern regions, it seemed arid and unpromising to some of the migrants. Settlers used irrigation to develop agriculture and the flourishing, self-sufficient city known then as Great Salt Lake City. Thousands of Mormons joined them in the next several decades.

Settlers buried thirty-six Native Americans in one grave after an outbreak of measles occurred during the winter of 1847.

The initial territorial settlement was in Great Salt Lake City proper, but Brigham Young desired to secure a substantial population base across the then-uninhabited Great Basin, so he soon asked members to resettle farther out from the central point. They declared themselves a state (State of Deseret) in hopes of gaining admittance to the Union, and to assure the nascent state would grow uniformly, they named an as-yet-unbuilt settlement in mid-state as the state&#x27;s capital (Fillmore).

The county was officially organized on January 31, 1850, with slightly more than 11,000 residents recorded. In 1850, 26 slaves were counted in Salt Lake County. In 1852, the territorial legislature passed the Act in Relation to Service and the Act for the relief of Indian Slaves and Prisoners formally legalizing slavery in the territory.
Due to Utah Territory&#x27;s conflicts with the federal government, the federal surveyor abandoned his post in 1857, two years after he arrived. The surveyor&#x27;s duty was to officially plat the territory in order to bring the area onto the market, to make homesteading possible. The intermediate years between 1857 and 1869 passed with no federal surveyors, the LDS Pioneers completed plats, deeds, and surveys of the county in order to homestead and collect taxes. Since the deeds and titles handed out during the twelve-year period were not federally recognized homestead certificates, the Utah Territory agreed to reconcile the unrecognized deeds and titles in order to fold the Utah Territory into the federal homestead system, calling them (instead of homestead certificates) Land Title Certificates. The process to adjudicate the certificates took place over several years in 1871–1873, through the county Probate Court, overseen by judge Elias Smith. Settlers were required to file land claims, make declaratory statements, attend their adjudication hearings, provide testimony if counter claims on a parcel of land were filed, and wait for final judgement from the probate judge, who issued a final Land Title Certificate which declared a person the rightful owner. These certificates are retroactive backwards to 1852.

The idea of statehood for the new area was quickly tossed aside by the federal government, and the area was declared a territory in September 1850 – the Utah Territory. Construction of the capitol building in Fillmore was completed in 1855, so the territorial legislature traveled to the small community for their first session there. It was to be their last, as they chose to meet in Great Salt Lake City the following year and, in 1857, formally voted to make the city the capital of the Territory. In 1858, when the Utah Territory was declared in rebellion, the federal government sent troops to install a new governor and keep watch over the area. The government transition was made peacefully, then the troops set up Camp Floyd to the south in Utah County. In 1862, Fort Douglas was established on the eastern bench, near the current site of the University of Utah, as the federal government wanted to ensure the loyalty of the territory during the American Civil War. On January 29, 1868, &quot;Great&quot; was dropped from both the county and city names, giving them their modern names.

Patrick Edward Connor, the leader of the garrison at Fort Douglas, was openly anti-Mormon. He sent out parties to scout for mineral resources in the nearby mountains, hoping to encourage non-Mormons to settle in the territory. During the late 19th century, mines were established in the Wasatch mountains, most notably around Alta (and nearby Park City in Summit County). Exploiting the mineral wealth was difficult until the Utah Central Railroad was constructed and reached this area in 1870.

In the Oquirrh Mountains, the Bingham Canyon Mine, which contains vast deposits of copper and silver, was developed as the most productive of the county&#x27;s mines. The mine, located in the southwest portion of the county, attracted thousands of workers to the narrow canyon. At its peak, the city of Bingham Canyon contained 20,000 residents, all crowded along the steep walls of the canyon, and natural disasters were a frequent occurrence. By the early 20th century, most of the mines in the county had closed. However, the Bingham Canyon Mine kept on expanding. In the early 21st century, it is among the largest open-pit mines in the world.

===20th century===
After the railroad came to the county, the population began to expand more rapidly, and non-Mormons began to settle in Salt Lake City. During the early 20th century, the heavy industry came to the valley as well, diversifying its economy. Local and interurban trolley systems were built covering the more urban northeastern quarter of the valley. The city dismantled the trolley system by 1945, favoring the use of individual cars. Throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the east side of the valley began to be more densely settled.

In 1942, Kearns Army Air Base, a large military installation developed for World War II, was located in what is now Kearns on the western side of the valley. After the camp was closed in 1946, the land was sold for private development. Rapid postwar residential settlement of the area began. The federal government established other major defensive installations along the Wasatch Front and in the Great Salt Lake Desert during World War II, which stimulated the economy and brought more people to the area, establishing Utah as a major military center that benefited from federal investment. In the nationwide suburban boom of the late 1940s, 1950s, and early 1960s, such cities as South Salt Lake, Murray, Midvale, and much of the east side of the valley grew rapidly.

In common with other industrialized cities, Salt Lake City faced inner-city decay in the 1960s, when residents moved to newer housing in the suburbs. Cities such as Sandy, West Jordan, and what would become West Valley City grew at boomtown rates in the 1970s and 1980s. Huge residential tracts were developed through the center of the valley, and within ten years, the entire area had been converted from farmland into sprawling bedroom communities in Salt Lake City. West Valley City was created from the merger of the three unincorporated cities of Granger, Hunter and Redwood (including Chesterfield) in 1980.

But not every area of the county saw growth. The former mining towns related to Bingham Canyon were abandoned in the 1960s and 1970s to make way for the expansion of the open-pit mine. The city of Bingham Canyon was completely torn down and swallowed up in the mine by 1972, and the dismantling of Lark in 1980 completed the process. The only remaining mining town in the county is Copperton, located southwest of West Jordan, with approximately 800 residents. Magna has workers who continue to be associated with the mine&#x27;s smelting operations in Garfield and at Arthur Mill.

In the 1990s, the county&#x27;s areas of rapid growth shifted further south and west. Farm and pasturelands were developed as suburbs. The cities of West Jordan, South Jordan, Riverton, Herriman, and Draper are some of the fastest-growing cities in the state. During the 1990s, Salt Lake City gained population for the first time in 40 years.

===21st century===

Salt Lake City&#x27;s selection as the host of the 2002 Winter Olympics spurred a construction boom in the city that continued after the Olympics, slowing only in 2008 recession. As the county&#x27;s population has surpassed 1 million, it has significantly urbanized, leaving only a few rural areas in the far west of the valley. Issues facing the county today include congested transportation and related air pollution.

==Geography==
The Salt Lake Valley is fed by seven streams from the surrounding mountains. All the runoff water eventually ends in the Great Salt Lake, which has no outlet. The mountains rise precipitously from the relatively flat valley surfaces, indicating their comparatively youthful formation. The county has a total area of , of which is land and (8.1%) is water. It is the fifth-smallest county in Utah by area. The county borders on the Great Salt Lake and is traversed by the northward flowing Jordan River.

The western portion of the county descends toward the valley of the lake, but perhaps the most dominating physical feature in Salt Lake County is the Wasatch Mountains in the eastern portion of the county, famous for both summer and winter activities. The mountains are administered as part of the Wasatch-Cache National Forest. The mountains&#x27; snow is touted in state-sponsored publicity as &#x27;Greatest Snow on Earth&#x27; for its soft, powdery texture, and led to Salt Lake City&#x27;s winning the bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics. Salt Lake County has four ski resorts: Snowbird and Alta in Little Cottonwood Canyon and Solitude and Brighton in Big Cottonwood Canyon. Hiking and camping are popular summer activities. The Oquirrh Mountains border the western part of the county. These two mountain ranges, together with the much smaller Traverse Mountains at the south of the valley, delimit Salt Lake Valley, which is also flanked on the northwest by the Great Salt Lake, and on the north by the Salt Lake Anticline (including Ensign Peak).
On the north and east benches, houses have been built halfway up the mountain to the boundary of the national forest, assuming greater risk from wildfires. New communities are also being constructed on the southern and western slopes. Rapid residential construction continues in the west-central, southwest, and southern portions of the valley. In the far west, southwest, and northwest, rural areas still exist, but rapid growth threatens what remains of the natural environment in the valley. The County government operates several large parks in the valley (including some with incorporated cities), including Big Cottonwood Park, Crestwood Park, and an Equestrian Center.

===Access===
Traffic into the Salt Lake Valley passes through four narrow geographic features: Parley&#x27;s Canyon to the east; the space between the Salt Lake Anticline and the Great Salt Lake leading into Davis County to the north; the Point of the Mountain and adjacent Jordan Narrows leading to Utah County to the south; and a space (known as Garfield) between the Oquirrh Mountains and the Great Salt Lake leading to Tooele County to the west. Of these, only the connection to Davis County to the north is wide enough and flat enough to accommodate transportation routes without reliance on earthworks.

===Adjacent counties===

* Davis County – north
* Morgan County – northeast
* Summit County – east
* Wasatch County – southeast
* Utah County – south
* Tooele County – west
===Climate===
Annual precipitation for the Salt Lake Valley is around , usually with more on the east side and less on the west side, as most storms come from the Pacific Ocean and the west side is in the rain shadow of the Oquirrh Mountains. Up to is received on the east benches. Most of this precipitation is received in spring. The summer is dry, with the majority of precipitation arriving from the monsoon that rises from the south. Short, localized, and often dry thunderstorms are usually associated with the monsoon. However, some can be very intense. These storms can cause contrasting emergencies of flash floods and wildfires (due to dry lightning and powerful winds). Precipitation is heaviest in late fall/early winter and in spring, while early summer is the driest season.

Annual snowfall in the valley is , with up to on the benches. The most snow falls between mid-November and late March. The mountains receive up to of light, dry snow and up to of precipitation annually. The dry snow is often considered good for skiing, contributing to the four ski resorts in the county. Snow usually falls from October through May. The heavy snow totals across the county can be attributed to the lake-effect, where precipitation is intensified by the warm waters of the Great Salt Lake, which never entirely freezes due to the lake&#x27;s high salinity. The lake effect can affect any area of the county, depending on wind conditions. The dry snow is attributed to the low humidity of the region.

During winter, temperature inversions are common, causing air pollution in the valley. They trap pollutants, moisture, and cold temperatures in the valley while the surrounding mountains enjoy warm temperatures and clear skies. This can cause some melting snow in the mountains and unhealthy air quality, and low visibility in the valley. This weather event lasts from a few days to a month in extreme cases and is caused when an area of high pressure forms over the Great Basin.

===Religion===

According to data from the LDS Church and the State of Utah, Salt Lake County&#x27;s population was 50.6% LDS (Mormon) in 2008, as reported in the &quot;Deseret News.&quot; By 2013, this had increased to 51.41%. However, by 2020, the share of LDS members had decreased to 46.89%.

==Government==
=== County Court, March 15, 1852 – June 8, 1896 ===

The first governing administrative body of the county was made up of the probate court and judge, Elias Smith, and three selectmen: Samuel Moore, Reuben Miller, and J.C. Wright. The first order of business on March 15 was to appoint a county Assessor/Collector, S. Eldridge. Second order was the appointment of a county Treasurer, Thomas Rhodes, and the third and fourth orders of business for the day was setting the rate of taxation on taxable property, at .5% of $0.01, and .25% of $0.01, as a road tax. The Court (probate section) adjudicated in civil and criminal cases in the county.

=== Commission, June 8, 1896 – January 1, 2001 ===

The Board of County Commissioners began its duties on June 8, 1896, with Utah&#x27;s statehood. Though the judge was removed when the court was abolished upon statehood, the Selectmen stayed on in their offices until elections to fill the new commission seats were held. The first commissioners elected were: A.S. Geddes, M. Christopherson, and C.H. Roberts. The Commission took over all duties the Court and Selectmen performed. The County Court house was demolished after the completion of the Salt Lake City and County Building in Downtown Salt Lake City in the mid-1890s. The new County Commission governed at the City and County Building until 1986 when the county government moved its offices to the newly built the Salt Lake County Government Center at State Street and 2100 South, formerly the location of the County Hospital, which was demolished in early the 1980s to build the County Government Center.

===Council and mayor, January 1, 2001===
The county currently has a mayor–council form of government. The position of mayor is decided in partisan elections; the current mayor (as of January 2019) is Jenny Wilson, a Democrat. Former county mayors include Peter Corroon, Nancy Workman and Alan Dayton (Workman&#x27;s deputy mayor; sworn in as acting mayor in September 2004 when Nancy Workman was placed on paid administrative leave). The County Council is composed of three seats elected at-large and six elected by district. District-elected councilors are elected to staggered four-year terms; the at-large councilors are elected to six-year terms. See district maps

===Politics===
Like most of Utah, Salt Lake County has traditionally favored candidates from the Republican Party. However, while it is relatively conservative for an urban county, it has been friendlier to Democratic candidates than the rest of the state. All but one Democrat in the state House of Representatives, and all six Democrats in the state Senate, represent districts based in the county. Democratic presidential candidates managed to carry the county four times between 2008 and 2024, despite losing the state by large margins.

In 2004, Republican President George W. Bush won the county over Democrat John Kerry 59% to 37%. In 2008, however, Democrat Barack Obama won Salt Lake County by an extremely narrow margin, 48.17% to 48.09%, over Republican John McCain—a difference of 296 votes. It was the first time since 1964, when Lyndon B. Johnson was the Democratic candidate, that Salt Lake County had voted for a Democrat in a presidential race. In 2012, the Republicans recaptured the county, as Mitt Romney received 58% of the vote to Obama&#x27;s 38%. In 2016, Democrat Hillary Clinton won the county with 41.5% of the vote, to Republican Donald Trump&#x27;s 32.6% and Independent and Utah-native Evan McMullin&#x27;s 25.9%—a much wider margin of over 35,000 votes. In 2020, Salt Lake County saw a strong Democratic trend when Joe Biden carried it with 53% of the vote. He was the first Democratic presidential candidate to win a majority of the county&#x27;s vote since Johnson.

Democratic strength in the county is mainly concentrated in Salt Lake City and closer inner ring suburbs like South Salt Lake and Millcreek. Other inner ring suburbs in the I-215 corridor such as West Valley City tend to be swing towns. Sandy and West Jordan tend to lean more Republican, and the other outer-ring suburbs in the southern part of the county like South Jordan are strongly Republican.

The bulk of the county was for a long time located in the 2nd congressional district. However, after Utah gained a seat following the 2010 census redistricting, the Republican-controlled state legislature split the county into three districts – 2nd, 3rd and 4th. Despite that, from 2000 to 2020 Republicans controlled most of the county in Congress only for four years – from 2015 to 2019, after Jim Matheson, who survived two redistricting cycles following the 2000 and 2010 censuses, retired and was replaced by Mia Love, who in turn, was defeated by former county mayor Ben McAdams in the 2018 election. McAdams lost to Republican Burgess Owens in 2020, giving Republicans full control of the county’s districts. Salt Lake County was split into 4 districts after the 2020 census, and Republicans have held all of them since.

Only one Republican (Workman) has ever been elected county mayor. Since its inception, the county council has mostly been Republican-controlled, save for two years in 2009–2011, when Democrats had a narrow 5-4 majority following the 2008 election.

The county last voted for the Democratic candidate for governor in 2004, and for a Democratic Senate candidate in 1974, although, it voted for independent candidate Evan McMullin in 2022.

==Economy==
The region&#x27;s economy traditionally revolved around LDS services and mining. While both are still important to the economy, each has greatly declined in significance since the 19th century. Since World War II, defense industries in the region have also played a very important role in the economy due to its strategic central location in the Western United States, as well as the largely uninhabited and desolate Great Salt Lake Desert to the west (used for training, weapons testing, and storage of hazardous materials).

Beginning in 1939, with the opening of Alta Ski Area, skiing and other winter sports (as well as summer sports), have become a major force in the economy. In 1995, Salt Lake City won the bid to host the 2002 Winter Olympics. The 2002 Olympics boosted tourism and the economy, and helped to dramatically improve transportation throughout the county. Transportation has been a major focus, as the county continues to rapidly grow in population. It was drastically improved beginning in the late 80s and through the 90s, and continues to this day. Beginning in the 1960s, a more service-oriented economy began to develop, and information technologies began to arrive in the 80s and 90s. Although this business has waned in recent years, information and computer companies, such as iBAHN, InContact, Mstar, Opengear, and Overstock.com are still thriving businesses here.

==Education==
The county has one major research university, the University of Utah. Westminster College and Salt Lake Community College also have large, well defined campuses in the county. Colleges with smaller, non-traditional campuses in the county include Roseman University of Health Sciences, Broadview University, Eagle Gate College, Ensign College, Midwives College of Utah, Neumont University, and Stevens-Henager College.

Salt Lake County includes five separate public school districts: Salt Lake City, Canyon, Granite, Jordan, and Murray.

Salt Lake City and Murray operate their own school districts (although a recent annexation by Murray leaves a part of the city within the Granite School District). The Granite School District, the third largest in the state, is a broad district that covers a swath from Magna , Kearns, and Taylorsville through West Valley City and eastward to South Salt Lake and Millcreek. The Jordan School District, with approximately 48,000 students, covers the southwest part of the county, including most of West Jordan, South Jordan, Riverton, Herriman, Bluffdale, and Copperton.

On November 6, 2007, the east side residents of the Jordan School District in Sandy, Draper, Midvale, Cottonwood Heights, Alta, and nearby unincorporated areas voted to split from the Jordan District, creating the Canyons School District. A similar vote to make West Jordan its own district, however, failed.


Two high schools have closed:
* South High School in Salt Lake City closed in 1988; it is now occupied by the City Campus of the Salt Lake Community College (SLCC).
* Granite High School in South Salt Lake was reformed into an alternative school in 2006, although it remained a public school. However, this venture was not a financial success and the school closed in 2009. The school building was demolished in 2018 in preparation for the site to be redeveloped. The site is now the location of Salt Lake County Library&#x27;s Granite branch.

Non-traditional public high schools also include Horizonte and Valley, which was at one time located in the historic Crescent Elementary School building.

In addition, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Salt Lake City operates eight elementary schools, one middle school, two high schools, and two preschools in Salt Lake County. Judge Memorial Catholic High School in Salt Lake City is the largest Catholic high school in Utah. The Catholic Church also operates Juan Diego High School in Draper.

Intermountain Christian School is the only PS-12 independent Christian School in Salt Lake County.

Salt Lake County also has several independent schools including:
* Rowland Hall-St. Mark&#x27;s School
* The Waterford School
* Intermountain Christian School
Salt Lake County is home to the Bastian Agricultural and Equestrian Center, which also serves as an extension and distance education location for Utah State University. 

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===
Because the restricted geography permits only four major entrances to the Salt Lake Valley, routes for long-distance travel through the valley are mainly confined to an east–west strip through Salt Lake City and South Salt Lake and a north–south strip near the Jordan River. These corridors cross in the area between South Salt Lake and Downtown Salt Lake City and together form a latin cross of transportation infrastructure that is almost perfectly oriented north-to-south.

====Air transportation====
Salt Lake City International Airport is the only airport with scheduled passenger service in the county, and South Valley Regional Airport is the only other public airport. Another small airport, Skypark Airport, is just to the north of Salt Lake County. Salt Lake City International Airport is the 24th-busiest airport in the United States and a hub of Delta Air Lines and SkyWest Airlines. In 2014, construction began on a major renovation and expansion project. The initial phase was completed in 2020, with expansion phases completing periodically between then and 2026.

====Railroads====
Union Pacific controls all long-distance freight tracks into the county, though the Utah Railway, BNSF, and Salt Lake, Garfield, and Western have long-standing trackage rights. The Salt Lake City Southern and Savage Bingham and Garfield railroads operate totally within the county. All four major entrances to the Salt Lake Valley once carried rail traffic, but only railroads at the north, south, and west entrances to the valley exist today as the line in Parley&#x27;s Canyon was never built to high standards and was covered by Interstate 80 in the mid-20th century. All three of these entrances carry passenger trains as well as freight.

Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;California Zephyr&quot; runs daily in both directions between Garfield and Point of the Mountain via Salt Lake City Station (on its route between Emeryville, California and Chicago, Illinois).

====Rail mass transit====
The Utah Transit Authority&#x27;s (UTA) &quot;FrontRunner&quot; commuter rail line provides all-day service to Ogden (with select peak hour trips going to Pleasant View) to the north (via Davis County) and Provo to the south.

A light rail system, known as TRAX, is operated by the Utah Transit Authority (UTA) and currently has three lines. The Blue Line runs from Downtown Salt Lake City to Draper), the Red Line from South Jordan to the University of Utah, and the Green Line from West Valley City to the Salt Lake City International Airport (via Downtown Salt Lake City). There are currently 50 stops in the system. The original line opened in 1999 from downtown to Sandy, with the line to the University of Utah completed in 2001, and to West Valley City and South Jordan in 2011. In April 2013 the extension to the airport (Airport Station) on the Green Line opened and the extension to Draper (Draper Town Center Station) on the Blue Line opened in August 2013.

An historic streetcar was proposed along 2100 South from the TRAX station to the historic business district in the Sugar House neighborhood. The proposal was refined and in December 2013, a modern (S Line) light rail track was completed and is operated by UTA. A future extension is planned to run north along Highland Drive and 1100 East to 1700 South.

====Roads====
The county is traversed by three Interstate Highways and one U.S. Highway, as well as an additional freeway and one major expressway. US-89 enters from Davis County to the north and traverses the county arrow-straight until merging with I-15 in north Draper. It is known as State Street along most of the route and is the primary surface road in the valley. I-15 and I-80 intersect just west of Downtown Salt Lake City, merging for approximately north-to-south. I-80 continues west past the Salt Lake City International Airport and east through Parley&#x27;s Canyon and into the Wasatch Range. I-15 traverses the valley north-to-south, providing access to the entire urban corridor. The freeway is 10–12 lanes wide after a major expansion project from 1998 to 2001 undertaken in preparation for the 2002 Winter Olympics. I-215 directly serves many of the suburbs of Salt Lake City in the western, central, and eastern portions of the valley in a 270° loop. SR-201, alternatively known as the &quot;21st South Freeway&quot;, provides access to West Valley City and the west side of the valley. Bangerter Highway (SR-154) is an expressway that traverses the entire western end of the valley from the airport, ending at I-15 in southern Draper. SR-68, or Redwood Road, is the only surface street that traverses the entire valley from north-to-south. The Legacy Parkway opened in 2008 to connect with I-215 at the north end of the valley, providing an alternative route into Davis County to alleviate congestion. The Mountain View Corridor is a limited-access highway across the southwestern part of the county; construction began in 2010 and it was put into operation in stages.

The Utah Transit Authority operates bus routes throughout the valley and along the Wasatch Front, to Park City and Tooele, and to the ski resorts in winter.

====Pedestrian and bicycle trails====
The Jordan River Parkway trail (and its northern extension, the Legacy Parkway trail) runs north–south in the center of the valley from Utah County to Davis County (though it has a few gaps), and the planned Crosstown and Parley&#x27;s trails will together form the primary east–west route from Parley&#x27;s Canyon to Garfield. The Bonneville Shoreline Trail runs along the face of the Wasatch mountains, skirting the edge of the built up areas of the east bench, though there are large gaps in the central part of the county. A large number of more remote trails provide access throughout the Wasatch-Cache National Forest.

===Health care===
The largest health care providers in the county are Intermountain Health Care and University of Utah Healthcare, though three major hospitals (St Mark&#x27;s, Pioneer Valley, and the Veterans Affairs Hospital) are run by other organizations. Hospitals in the county include:

* Alta View Hospital
* Huntsman Cancer Hospital
* Intermountain Medical Center
* Holy Cross Hospital (Formerly known as Jordan Valley Hospital)
* LDS Hospital
* Pioneer Valley Hospital
* Primary Children&#x27;s Medical Center
* Salt Lake Regional Medical Center

In 1918, the town and station were buried by an expansion of one of Kennecott&#x27;s tailings ponds west of Magna. The station was moved north but in 1996 the location was again buried by another expansion of the tailings pond although by that time Riter was only a siding and there were no buildings there.

<text>San Juan County ( ) is a county in the southeastern portion of the U.S. state of Utah. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 14,518. Its county seat is Monticello, while its most populous city is Blanding. The Utah State Legislature named the county for the San Juan River, itself named by Spanish explorers (in honor of Saint John). San Juan County borders Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico at the Four Corners.

==History==
The Utah Territory authorized the creation of San Juan County on February 17, 1880, with territories annexed from Iron, Kane, and Piute counties. There has been no change in its boundaries since its creation. Monticello was founded in 1887, and by 1895 it was large enough to be designated the seat of San Juan County.

==Geography==

San Juan County lies in the southeastern corner of the state of Utah. Its borders coincide with the borders of the states of Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona with Utah. The convergence point of these borders, Four Corners Monument, is located at the extreme southeastern corner of the county.

The county&#x27;s terrain generally slopes to the west and the south, with its highest point, Mount Peale, at above sea level. The county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.4%) is water. It is the largest county by area in Utah.

The county&#x27;s western and southern boundaries lie deep within gorges carved by the Colorado and San Juan Rivers. Tributary canyons, cutting through rock layers of the surrounding deserts, have carved the land up with chasms, cliffs, and plateaus. In the center of the county is Cedar Mesa, Comb Wash, Natural Bridges, and Hovenweep National Monuments. Canyonlands National Park lies mainly within the county borders. The Eastern side of Glen Canyon National Recreation Area / Lake Powell is also in the county.

The Blue (Abajo) Mountains and the La Sal Mountains exceed in elevation. Both ranges are covered with lush forests, contrasting the scenery below. The elevation change within the county is from nearly in the La Sal Mountains to at Lake Powell, a difference of about .

The county&#x27;s towns lie primarily on a north-south axis along U.S. routes 191 and 163 from La Sal in the north to Monument Valley in the south.

===Natural resources===

In 2018, the only operating uranium processing plant in the United States was located in the town of Blanding; however, the plant was moved to be on standby in 2019.

San Juan County is home to numerous oil and gas fields, including Squaw Canyon Oil Field, that produce primarily from the Desert Creek and Ismay Formations.

===2020 census===

According to the 2020 United States census and 2020 American Community Survey, there were 14,518 people in San Juan County with a population density of 1.9 people per square mile (0.7/km2). Among non-Hispanic or Latino people, the racial makeup was 6,038 (41.6%) White, 32 (0.2%) African American, 7,186 (49.5%) Native American, 34 (0.2%) Asian, 51 (0.4%) Pacific Islander, 26 (0.2%) from other races, and 404 (2.8%) from two or more races. 747 (5.1%) people were Hispanic or Latino.

There were 7,269 (50.07%) males and 7,249 (49.93%) females, and the population distribution by age was 4,176 (28.8%) under the age of 18, 8,104 (55.8%) from 18 to 64, and 2,238 (15.4%) who were at least 65 years old. The median age was 34.6 years.

There were 4,649 households in San Juan County with an average size of 3.12 of which 3,397 (73.1%) were families and 1,252 (26.9%) were non-families. Among all families, 2,359 (50.7%) were married couples, 317 (6.8%) were male householders with no spouse, and 721 (15.5%) were female householders with no spouse. Among all non-families, 1,070 (23.0%) were a single person living alone and 182 (3.9%) were two or more people living together. 1,848 (39.8%) of all households had children under the age of 18. 3,708 (79.8%) of households were owner-occupied while 941 (20.2%) were renter-occupied.

The median income for a San Juan County household was $49,690 and the median family income was $57,401, with a per-capita income of $20,088. The median income for males that were full-time employees was $48,259 and for females $34,092. 22.8% of the population and 18.1% of families were below the poverty line.

===2010 census===
As of the 2010 United States Census, there were 14,746 people and 4,505 households in San Juan County. The racial and ethnic composition of the population was 50.4% Native American, 45.8% White, 0.3% Asian, 0.2% African American and 2.3% reporting two or more races. 4.4% of the population was Hispanic or Latino of any race.

==Politics and government==
San Juan County has supported Republican presidents since voting for Wendell Willkie in 1940. It supported a Democrat for president in 1896 (William Jennings Bryan), 1916 (Woodrow Wilson), and 1936 (Franklin D. Roosevelt). Though a Republican vote currently secures elections, the area has voted less Republican than the rest of Utah in many national elections. In 2004, for example, George W. Bush won 60.02% in San Juan County versus 71.54% in the state. In 2020, Democrat Joe Biden needed 6.13% more votes to win the county from Donald Trump, who secured 51.2% in the county as opposed to 58.13% in the state as a whole. The county is more competitive at the state level due to its high Native American population, which leans Democratic. Notably, the county voted for the Democratic candidates in the 1988 and 2000 gubernatorial elections, both of which Republican candidates won.

Federally mandated commissioner districts put many Navajo voters in one district. The San Juan County Board of Commissioners has been majority white for many years. In 2016, a Federal District Court decision found voting districts violated the 1965 Voting Rights Act and the U.S. Constitution. Before the 2016 court decision, the county used an at-large voting system to elect commissioners.

In 2018, the first-ever majority-Navajo commission was seated. Two of the three county commissioners, Willie Grayeyes and Kenneth Maryboy, are board members of Utah Diné Bikeyah, which supported the creation of Bears Ears National Monument. In a 2019 special election, Proposition 10, which would have changed the structure of the county government to include five county commissioners, was blocked needing 153 more popular votes. The proposition, spearheaded by Blanding Mayor Joe Lyman, was characterized by opponents as an effort to undermine the Navajo-majority county commission. Mayor Joe Lyman characterized the proposition as a way to restore representation to Blanding, the county&#x27;s largest city. He states, &quot;I don&#x27;t like how we arrived at the commissioners we have because it felt like a judicial appointment,&quot; and that &quot;the vote is very evenly split.&quot;

As of March 2020, efforts were underway to bring municipal water and electrical service to the 29-home Diné (Navajo) community of Westwater, which has existed for decades with neither just outside the city limits of Blanding.

<text>Summit County is a county in the U.S. state of Utah, occupying a rugged and mountainous area. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 42,357. Its county seat is Coalville, and the largest city is Park City.

==History==
The county was created by the Utah Territory legislature on January 13, 1854, with its description containing a portion of the future state of Wyoming. It was not organized then but was attached to Great Salt Lake County for administrative and judicial purposes. The county government was completed by March 4, 1861, so its attachment to the other county was terminated. The county boundaries were altered in 1856 and in 1862. In 1868 the Wyoming Territory was created by the US government, effectively de-annexing all Summit County areas falling within the new territory. The boundaries were further altered in 1872 and 1880. Its final alteration occurred on January 7, 1918, when Daggett&#x27;s creation took a portion of its eastern territory. Its boundary has remained unchanged since that creation. It is so named because it includes 39 of the highest mountain peaks in Utah.

The county&#x27;s mean elevation is above sea level, which is the second-highest (after Taos County, New Mexico) of any county outside Colorado. Owing to its proximity to Salt Lake City, Park City has acquired a reputation as an upscale getaway, bringing new development to the area.

Summit County is part of the Heber, UT Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Salt Lake City-Provo-Orem, UT Combined Statistical Area.

==Geography==
Summit County lies on the upper east side of Utah. Its northeast borders abut Wyoming&#x27;s southern and western borders. Its central and eastern portion consists largely of the east–west oriented Uinta Mountains, while its western portion runs to the east slopes of the north–south oriented Wasatch Mountains. The county&#x27;s highest point is Gilbert Peak, on the border with Duchesne County, at ASL. The county has an area of , of which is land and (0.5%) is water.

Roughly two-in-five people (44.2%) of the population claim no religion at all. 36.8% are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) (compared with some 66% statewide) and 10.6% are Catholic.

==Politics and government==
Summit County was a Republican stronghold in the decades following World War II. Beginning in the 1990s, it became more competitive due to the influence of Democratic-leaning Park City, with Democrats sometimes winning a plurality or majority of the countywide vote. In 1996, Bill Clinton became the first Democratic presidential nominee to win the county since Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s 44-state landslide in 1964 and only the second Democrat to carry it since Franklin D. Roosevelt. George W. Bush carried the county in 2000 and 2004, but his performance there was worst in the state. In the 2006 Senate race, Summit County was the only county carried by Democrat Pete Ashdown even as the Republican incumbent Orrin Hatch carried the state as a whole by a 2 to 1 margin. Likewise, in the 2008 U.S. presidential election, Barack Obama carried the county by a 15.3% margin over John McCain, while McCain carried Utah by 28.1%. In the 2012 presidential election, Republican Mitt Romney defeated Obama in the county, 50% to 46%. In 2016, Democrat Hillary Clinton defeated Republican Donald Trump, 50% to 35%, and Joe Biden increased her margin by 3% in 2020, solidifying the county as a safe Democratic region.













In the 2016 Senate race, Summit County was the only county in Utah where a plurality voted for Democratic nominee Misty Snow against Republican incumbent Mike Lee. Snow was the first major-party transgender Senate candidate in United States history, making the county the first in the nation to vote for a transgender candidate for the Senate.

On the county level, most of the elected offices are held by Democrats, including four of the five seats on the newly created Summit County Council. John Hanrahan, D; Claudia McMullin, D; Sally Elliott, D; Chris Robinson, D; David Ure, R.

Summit County was one of only two counties (along with Grand County) to vote against Utah&#x27;s same-sex marriage ban in 2004. In June 2010, Summit County became the sixth local government of Utah to prohibit discrimination in employment or housing based on a person&#x27;s sexual orientation or gender identity.

<text>Sanpete County ( ) is a county in the U.S. state of Utah. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 28,437. Its county seat is Manti, and its largest city is Ephraim. The county was created in 1850.

==History==
The Sanpete Valley may have been traversed or inhabited as long as 32,000 BP by small bands of hunters. This habitation may have continued for about 20,000 years when the extinction of larger game animals forced a change. About 8,500 years ago, different groups (characterized by use of atlatls, millstones and textiles) came onto the scene. These also departed the area about 2,500 years ago, for unknown reasons, after which the area does not seem to have been visited by humans for 1,500 years.

Archeological evidence indicates that the Fremont people appeared next on the stage (from about 1-1300 CE), the first inhabitants of the area to domesticate crops and create relatively large communal settlements. In this county, the best-known Fremont site to date is &quot;Witch&#x27;s Knoll&quot; SE of Ephraim. Around 1300 AD the evidence of Fremont habitation also ceases. The most recent groups of indigenous Americans in the Sanpete region are the Ute, Paiute, Goshute, and Shoshoni, who appeared in Utah about 1300 and &quot;perhaps they displaced, replaced, or assimilated the part-time Fremont hunter-gatherers.&quot; The Utes, Paiutes, Goshute and Shoshone share a common language family called Numic.

Mormon pioneers arrived in the Great Basin in the summer of 1847. The first few years were spent establishing a base in the Great Salt Lake Valley, then groups were sent, usually by the directive of the church leaders, to settle the more outlying areas. In 1849 two Ute chiefs traveled from what is now Sanpete County about north to the Salt Lake Valley to request a Mormon settlement be established. The chiefs, Walkara and Sowiette, asked Mormon leader Brigham Young to settle a group of his people in the valley of Sanpitch. Young sent a party to explore the area in August of that year. It was deemed favorable to settlement, and Brigham Young called Isaac Morley and George Washington Bradley to organize about fifty families to move south and settle &quot;San Pete.&quot; The group of 224 arrived on November 19, led by Isaac Morley, Charles Shumway, Seth Taft, and George Washington Bradley. After some debate, the first settlement in the valley was established on the present site of Manti, Utah.

The State of Deseret enacted the county effective January 31, 1850. The region was named for the Ute chief Sanpitch, which was changed to Sanpete. According to William Bright, the name comes from the Ute word &quot;saimpitsi&quot;, meaning &quot;people of the tules&quot;.

The county boundaries were adjusted more than a dozen times during the 19th century. These adjustments often shrank it from its previous size. As of 1880, the county of Sanpete included the area of what would later become modern-day Carbon County, as well as some of Emery, Uintah, and Grand Counties. An adjustment in 1913 and refining of the county boundary definitions in 1919 brought Sanpete County to its present configuration.

The Sanpete County Courthouse, completed in 1935 by the Works Project Administration, is on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
The Sanpete Valley runs from north to south through the center of the county. The county is sloped to the south, with its highest point east of Ephraim, on South Tent Mountain at ASL. The county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.8%) is water. The geographical center of Utah is located in Sanpete County, just west of Ephraim.

Sanpete County is bounded along its eastern side by the Wasatch Plateau (sometimes known as the Manti Mountains). The Wasatch Plateau rises to approximately . Most of the Wasatch Plateau is encompassed by the Manti Division of the Manti-La Sal National Forest. Runoff from the western slopes of these mountains provides water to the county&#x27;s cities and agricultural areas. Central Sanpete is dominated by the Sanpete Valley (sometimes known as the Sanpitch Valley), where most of the county&#x27;s cities are located. The western side of the valley is bounded by the lower and drier San Pitch Mountains, which also form part of the western boundary of the county. The San Pitch River runs from north to south through Sanpete and empties into the Sevier River in southwestern Sanpete. This portion of the Sevier River Valley is known as Gunnison Valley.

<text>Sevier County ( ) is a county in Utah, United States. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 21,522. Its county seat and largest city is Richfield.

Pando, a clonal quaking aspen stand, that, according to some sources, is the oldest (80,000 years) and largest (106 acres, 13 million pounds) organism on Earth, is located in this county.

==History==
Evidence of indigenous peoples residing in Sevier County up to 5,000 BP has been unearthed. The Fremont culture of Native Americans occupied the area from about 2000 to 700 BP. The Clear Creek site contains native petroglyphs from that period.

In Utah, the Numic- (or Shoshonean) speaking peoples of the Uto-Aztecan language family evolved into four distinct groups in the historical period: the Northern Shoshone, Goshute or Western Shoshone, Southern Paiute, and Ute peoples. This territory&#x27;s central and eastern sections were occupied primarily by various bands of the Ute.

The first modern sighting of the Sevier River was most likely by the Catholic fathers Silvestre Vélez de Escalante and Francisco Atanasio Domínguez, on their expedition to California in 1776. The Old Spanish Trail was the route they mapped. Over the next century, this trail carried fur trappers, hunters, government officials, traders, and settlers.

Settlement of this area began when Richfield was first settled. Mormon settlers (The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints) arrived on June 15, 1864, most of whom had emigrated from Scandinavian countries. Because of the growth in this small community, the people soon petitioned Utah Territory officials about a separate county.

On January 16, 1865, the Utah Territory legislature created the county, with the area annexed from Sanpete County. It was named for the Sevier River. The county seat was Big Spring (later named Richfield). The county borders were adjusted in 1866, 1880, 1890, and in 1921. A clarification of boundary lines corresponding to government survey lines was completed in 1931, marking the present configuration of Sevier County.

Although the county was in place by 1865, much of Sevier County was abandoned in the Black Hawk War in 1867. Attempts to resettle the area were not successful until 1870. By 1874, 753 residents lived in the area.

==Geography==
Sevier County terrain consists of semi-arid but arable rolling areas punctuated by northeast–southwest mountain ridges, usually forested. The highest point is Fish Lake Hightop in the Central Utah Plateau, at ASL. The county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.4%) is water.

<text>Tooele County ( ) is a county in the U.S. state of Utah. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 72,698. Its county seat and largest city is Tooele. The county was created in 1850 and organized the following year. Tooele County is part of the Salt Lake City, UT Metropolitan Statistical Area. A 2008 CNNMoney.com article identified Tooele as the U.S. county experiencing the greatest job growth since 2000.

The western half is mostly covered by the Great Salt Lake Desert and includes the city of Wendover (the immediate neighbor of West Wendover, Nevada) and Ibapah. Within the central section lies Skull Valley, between the Cedar and the Stansbury Mountains. It contains a few small towns as well as the Dugway Proving Ground. The population centers are on the eastern edge in the Tooele Valley, between the Stansbury and Oquirrh Mountains. This area contains the cities of Tooele, Grantsville, Erda, and Lake Point as well as the unincorporated community of Stansbury Park. Tooele Army Depot is located on the southern edge of the valley. The Stockton Bar geologic feature separates Tooele Valley and Rush Valley, in which the towns of Stockton, Vernon, Faust, and Rush Valley are located. Additional small towns, Ophir and Mercur, are located in two canyons on the south western side of the Oquirrh Mountains.

Tooele is home to one of the nine statewide regional campuses of Utah State University (located in the city of Tooele).

==History==

Evidence of several indigenous Native American groups has been found in Tooele County, but only the western Shoshone-speaking Goshute tribe claim the desolate lands as their ancestral home. The Goshute&#x27;s traditional territory includes most of modern Tooele County.

The Great Salt Lake Desert, which comprises much of the northern portion of the county, provided a major stumbling block for the ill-fated Donner-Reed Party in 1846. Its crusty sand slowed the group&#x27;s wagons to such an extent that the group spent six days crossing its 80-mile length, severely sapping the group&#x27;s resources and leading to their eventual disaster.

In 1847, Mormon pioneers settled in the neighboring Salt Lake Valley. Initially, Tooele Valley was used as a major grazing ground for Mormon cattle owners from Salt Lake and Utah Valleys. In 1849 the first white settlers established permanent roots in the Tooele Valley. Building a saw mill, the settlement was called E.T. City after LDS leader E.T. Benson. The territorial legislature first designated Tooele County—initially called &quot;Tuilla&quot;—on January 31, 1850, with significantly different boundaries. Its government was not organized at that time, and the area was attached to Salt Lake County for judicial and administrative purposes. It is speculated the name derives from a Native American chief, but controversy exists about whether such a chief lived. Alternate explanations hypothesize that the name comes from &quot;tu-wanda&quot;, the Goshute word for &quot;bear&quot;, or from &quot;tule&quot;, a Spanish word of Aztec origins meaning &quot;bulrush&quot;.

The Goshutes did not accept Mormon encroachment on their traditional homeland. The Mormons occupied the best camping sites near reliable springs, hunted in Goshute hunting grounds, and overgrazed the meadowland, leaving it unfit for sustaining the animals and plants used by the Goshutes. Mormons believed that Utah was a promised land given to them by God, and did not recognize any Goshute claim to the land. Goshutes began confiscating Mormon cattle that trespassed onto their property. In response, the Mormons ordered their armies to kill the Goshutes. In 1850, they ambushed a Goshute village, but the Goshutes were able to defend themselves without casualties. Later that year, a contingent of at least 50 men attacked the Goshute camp, killing nine and suffering no casualties. In 1851, General Daniel H. Wells took 30 people prisoners. After they tried to escape, Wells executed them. Similar attacks occurred throughout the 1850s with Goshutes typically being on the losing side.

By June 10, 1851, the county government was organized. On that date the county attachment to Salt Lake County was terminated. By 1852, Grantsville, Batesville, and Pine Canyon (later named Lincoln) were settled. 

In 1855 the town of Richville was designated county seat, but it soon became clear that Tooele was much larger. In 1861 the territorial legislature allowed the county to select a new seat, and Tooele was selected.

In 1859 Robert B. Jarvis, a U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs representative, convinced some of the nomadic bands to congregate at a farm reservation called Deep Creek. The results looked promising, but Jarvis&#x27; resignation in 1860 led support to disappear and the farm to be abandoned. Jarvis&#x27; replacement, Benjamin Davies, noted the Goshutes had lost faith in the federal government, and recommended limiting further encroachments on Goshute land, but his suggestions were largely ignored.

Twenty-two overland stagecoach outposts were built in Goshute territory, often on the sites of rare natural springs. Goshute attacks on mail outposts escalated in 1860, resulting in dozens of deaths in alternating waves of raids. At the outbreak of the American Civil War, federal troops left the area leaving defense in the hands of the Nauvoo Legion until General Patrick E. Connor arrived in Salt Lake City from California in 1862.

Connor acted ruthlessly toward the natives. He killed over 300 Shoshone in Southern Idaho in 1863. Connor&#x27;s men attacked Native American camps, sometimes indiscriminately, but through 1863 stage coach companies had lost 16 men and over 150 horses to depredations. A peace treaty was signed in 1863 which included an annuity of goods and US$1000 in compensation of killed game in exchange for an end to the hostilities, and use of routes through the natives&#x27; territories. The treaty did not cede Goshute control of land, but a follow-up agreement made in June 1865 did.
General Connor, who was anti-Mormon, also encouraged his troops to prospect for minerals. Connor believed that mining would bring non-Mormons to Utah Territory. After his men discovered gold, silver, lead, and zinc deposits in Tooele County in 1864 he was proven right. The Rush Valley Mining District was established by soldiers in the western Oquirrh Mountains and more than 100 claims were staked in the first year. Two new mining towns, Ophir and Lewiston ballooned to over 6000 people each in the 1870s, exceeding the population of Tooele and all the Mormon settlements in the area.

Tooele County as originally defined extended into present-day Nevada. The county&#x27;s borders were adjusted in 1852, in 1854, in 1856, in 1861, and in 1862. When Nevada Territory was created in 1862, the county&#x27;s borders were impacted, and when the Territory became a state (1864), Tooele County was formally divested of all its Nevada area. Two more boundary adjustments were made in 1870 and 1880, after which it has retained its boundaries to the present.

===Republic of Tooele===
From 1874 to 1879, non-Mormon politicians from the Liberal Party of Utah gained control of Tooele County, the first time any non-Mormons had success in Utah politics. Whimsically, they called the county the Republic of Tooele.

The 1874 election marked the first success of the anti-Mormon Liberal Party, which was organized in 1870. The party viewed the large non-Mormon mining population in the county as a natural environment for electoral success and campaigned fiercely in Tooele&#x27;s mining districts leading up to the June 1874 election. The non-Mormon appointed governor of Utah Territory, George L. Woods, campaigned for the Liberals in Tooele County.
The incumbent Mormon People&#x27;s Party observed several Tooele polling places on election day and lodged complaints of fraud after the Liberal Party triumphed by about 300 votes out of 2,200. The People&#x27;s Party alleged Liberal Party supporters had voted more than once, that many had not been residents for the required six months, and they were not taxpayers—according to territorial law, only taxpayers could vote in elections. The People&#x27;s Party called attention to the 2,200 votes cast in the election although only 1,500 Tooele County property taxpayers were on record. Incumbents refused to yield control of the Tooele County recorder&#x27;s office and the Tooele County Courthouse because of the alleged fraud.

Governor Woods dismissed the complaints and certified the Liberal victory. Third District Court Judge James B. McKean ruled that no evidence showing illegal activity had been presented. McKean construed poll tax as within the meaning of being a taxpayer. Since no evidence was provided there were over 300 carpetbaggers or repeat votes in the election, McKean sustained the tally and authorized deputy U.S. Marshals to install the Liberal candidates.

The recorder&#x27;s office was seized when it was momentarily abandoned, but a contingent of People&#x27;s Party supporters and incumbents held the county courthouse night and day. The marshals and Liberal Party candidates, outnumbered, attempted to negotiate with the armed and barricaded Mormons. Aware that a show of aggression could spark a battle, the parties were nonetheless unable to come to an agreement to hand over power.

Judge McKean issued an even more strongly worded injunction, and Brigham Young advised his followers that they had an obligation to obey the federal courts. The county courthouse was abandoned, thus beginning about five years of Liberal Party rule. However, the Utah territorial legislature, which had the last say on the qualifications of its members, refused to seat the Liberal Party representative from Tooele County.

The Liberals won an unopposed 1876 election.

In 1876, the territorial legislature passed bills requiring voter registration and requiring women&#x27;s suffrage for local elections—women had been voting in territorial elections since 1870. The Liberal Party, typically supported by male miners casually interested in politics, opposed both measures. In 1878 the Liberal majority in Tooele County disappeared, and the People&#x27;s Party regained control in 1879 after more than six months of Liberal procedural delays.

The Republic of Tooele era was characterized by subsequent politicians as one of excessive spending. The county was left with about $16,000 debt, significantly more than it started with.

===Modern Tooele===
Mining continued to play an important part in Tooele County into the 20th century, but the county benefited from two major military bases located in the western portion of the county. Wendover Air Force Base, now closed, was the training base of the Enola Gay crew, which dropped the first atomic weapon in 1945. The Tooele Army Depot, built in 1942, formerly housed the largest store of chemical and biological weapons, 45 percent of the nation&#x27;s, in the United States, at the Deseret Chemical Depot. Starting August 1996, the store was reduced by destruction in a controversial weapons incinerator, at the Tooele Chemical Agent Disposal Facility; the last such weapon was destroyed in January 2012.

Since the 1980s, much of Tooele County&#x27;s economic prospects have centered around private hazardous waste disposal facilities. Between 1988 and 1993, hazardous waste landfills and incinerators have been installed at Clive and Aragonite. This, coupled with uranium mine tailings from Salt Lake County which were disposed in Tooele County in the 1980s, the presence of the Deseret Chemical Depot, and a high-polluting magnesium facility in Rowley, have contributed to a general perception of Tooele County as a &quot;sacrifice zone&quot; for unwanted wastes.

News coverage for the county is provided by the &quot;Tooele Transcript-Bulletin&quot; newspaper.

On September 8, 2004, the Genesis spacecraft crashed into the desert floor of the Dugway Proving Ground in Tooele County.

The county&#x27;s western portion is home to the Bonneville Salt Flats, traversed by Interstate 80 and the Wendover Cut-off, the former routing of the Victory Highway.

==Geography==
Tooele County lies on the west side of Utah. Its west border abuts the east border of the state of Nevada. Its northeast border abuts the Great Salt Lake. Three significant mountain ranges run north–south through the county. Its east boundary line is delineated by the crestline of the Oquirrh Mountains, which separate the Tooele Valley from the Salt Lake Valley. The Stansbury Mountains parallel the Oquirrhs in the eastern part of the county, and the Cedar Mountains also run parallel to the other two through the east-central part of the county. There are also isolated prominences across the county, especially at its SW corner. The county terrain is largely arid and unused for agriculture unless irrigation water is available. The county generally slopes to the north. Its highest elevation is Deseret Peak in the Stansburys, at ASL. The county has a total area of , of which is land and (4.7%) is water.

Covering vast amounts of the Great Salt Lake desert west of Salt Lake Valley, Tooele County is the second largest county in Utah and among the driest. The Skull Valley Indian Reservation lies in Skull Valley, between the Cedar and Stansbury mountain ranges.

==Demographics==
===2020 census===
According to the 2020 United States census and 2020 American Community Survey, there were 72,698 people in Tooele County with a population density of 10.3 people per square mile (4.0/km2). Among non-Hispanic or Latino people, the racial makeup was 58,199 (80.1%) White, 436 (0.6%) African American, 445 (0.6%) Native American, 511 (0.7%) Asian, 637 (0.9%) Pacific Islander, 282 (0.4%) from other races, and 2,666 (3.7%) from two or more races. 9,522 (13.1%) people were Hispanic or Latino.

There were 36,687 (50.46%) males and 36,011 (49.54%) females, and the population distribution by age was 23,959 (33.0%) under the age of 18, 41,869 (57.6%) from 18 to 64, and 6,870 (9.5%) who were at least 65 years old. The median age was 31.4 years.

There were 22,087 households in Tooele County with an average size of 3.29 of which 17,531 (79.4%) were families and 4,556 (20.6%) were non-families. Among all families, 13,990 (63.3%) were married couples, 1,398 (6.3%) were male householders with no spouse, and 2,143 (9.7%) were female householders with no spouse. Among all non-families, 3,572 (16.2%) were a single person living alone and 984 (4.5%) were two or more people living together. 10,566 (47.8%) of all households had children under the age of 18. 17,970 (81.4%) of households were owner-occupied while 4,117 (18.6%) were renter-occupied.

The median income for a Tooele County household was $76,737 and the median family income was $83,730, with a per-capita income of $27,702. The median income for males that were full-time employees was $57,579 and for females $40,845. 5.9% of the population and 4.7% of families were below the poverty line.

In terms of education attainment, out of the 40,623 people in Tooele County 25 years or older, 3,224 (7.9%) had not completed high school, 12,971 (31.9%) had a high school diploma or equivalency, 15,055 (37.1%) had some college or associate degree, 6,091 (15.0%) had a bachelor&#x27;s degree, and 3,282 (8.1%) had a graduate or professional degree.

==Environmental concerns==
Heavy industry and the resulting pollution of the air, soil, and groundwater has affected the region in several ways. The US Environmental Protection Agency has reported that Tooele-based US Magnesium discharges dangerous toxins and cancerous byproducts. In 2008, the US Government considered listing the area as a Superfund site. Tooele County was listed in 1989 as having the worst air in Utah, according to Federal agencies and environmental groups. The Tooele County Health Department notes that the chemical output of the heavy industry can be particularly dangerous in the winter, because the region&#x27;s climate and setting create winter inversions, suspending the toxins in the air, and posing &quot;serious health concerns&quot;.

Due to the history of toxic waste disposal in the area, Tooele County and Utah residents have opposed plans to dispose of nuclear waste in the county boundaries. A high level nuclear waste site proposed to be built at the Goshute Tribe Reservation in Skull Valley faced opposition until the plan slowly fizzled out. Projects to dispose of depleted uranium at Energy Solution&#x27;s Clive facility continue to cause controversy.

==Politics and government==
From 1932 through 1968, Tooele County tended Democratic, selecting the Democratic nominee in every election save 1956 (but being blue enough to vote for Stevenson in 1952). From 1972 on, however, it has become powerfully Republican, voting Democratic only once in this period thus far, for Bill Clinton in 1996 (with a low plurality and by a narrow margin).

<text>Wasatch County ( ) is a county in the U.S. state of Utah. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 34,788. Its county seat and largest city is Heber City. The county was named for a Ute word meaning &quot;mountain pass&quot; or &quot;low place in the high mountains&quot;.

Wasatch County is part of the Heber, UT Micropolitan Statistical Area as well as the Salt Lake City-Provo-Orem, UT Combined Statistical Area.

==History==
The first settlers were Mormon pioneers, in 1859, settling near present Heber City, Midway, and Charleston. On January 17, 1862, the Utah Territory legislature created the county, annexing areas from Great Salt Lake, Green River, Sanpete, Summit, and Utah counties. Heber was selected as the county seat.
Wasatch in Ute means &quot;mountain pass&quot; or &quot;low pass over high range&quot;. Heber City was named for Mormon Apostle Heber C. Kimball. The county boundaries were altered in 1880 and 1884, and then on January 4, 1915, the eastern portion was partitioned off to become Duchesne County. The Wasatch County boundaries have remained unchanged since 1915.

<text>A rainbow flag is a multicolored flag consisting of the colors of the rainbow. The designs differ, but many of the colors are based on the seven spectral colors of the visible light spectrum.

==History==
In the 18th century, American Revolutionary War writer Thomas Paine proposed that a rainbow flag be used as a maritime flag to signify neutral ships in time of war.

Contemporary international uses of a rainbow flag dates to the beginning of the 20th century. The International Co-operative Alliance adopted a rainbow flag in 1925. A similar flag (ca. 1920) is used in Andean indigenism in Peru and Bolivia to represent the legacy of the Inca Empire. Since 1961, the international peace flag, also known as the PACE flag, has been especially popular in Italy and to a lesser extent Europe and the rest of the world. Since 1978, when it was created to represent gay pride, the rainbow pride flag has evolved as a symbol of the LGBT movement (in 1978, the community as a whole was referred to and described as the &quot;Gay&quot; community; the term &quot;LGBT&quot; did not yet exist.)

There are several independent rainbow flags in use today.

==In cultures and movements==
===Reformation (1525)===

The reformer Thomas Müntzer (1489–1525) connected socially revolutionary claims with his religious preaching (Genesis 9:11–17, Isaiah 40:8, 1 Peter 1:25). He is often portrayed with a rainbow banner in his hand. The Thomas Müntzer statue in the German town of Stolberg also shows him holding a rainbow banner in his hand.

In the German Peasants&#x27; War of the 16th century, Müntzer&#x27;s rainbow banner together with the peasants&#x27; boot (&quot;Bundschuh&quot;) was used as the sign of a new era, of hope and of social change.

The choice of the rainbow in the form of a flag harks back to the rainbow as a symbol of biblical promise. According to the Bible, God used the rainbow as a sign to Noah that there would never again be a worldwide flood, also known as the Rainbow covenant.

===Armenian Republic proposed flag (1919)===

A rainbow flag was proposed for Armenia when it regained independence after World War I. It was designed by Armenian artist Martiros Saryan. It was not adopted as the country instead went with three stripes using the colors used in a past Armenian kingdom. The artist used muted, richer colors reflecting Armenian fabrics and carpets.

===Cooperative movement (1921)===

A seven-colour rainbow flag is a common symbol of the international cooperative movement. The rainbow flag has been the cooperative emblem since 1921 when the International Co-operative Congress of World Co-op Leaders met in Basel, Switzerland to identify and define the growing cooperative movement&#x27;s common values and ideals to help unite co-ops around the world.

In Essen, Germany in 1922, the International Co-operative Alliance (ICA) designed an international co-op symbol and a flag for the first &quot;Co-operators&#x27; Day,&quot; which was held in July 1923. After some experiments with different designs, a famous French cooperator, Charles Gide, suggested using the seven colours of the rainbow for the flag. He pointed out that the rainbow symbolized unity in diversity and the power of light, enlightenment and progress. The first co-op rainbow flag was completed in 1924 and was adopted as an official symbol of the international cooperative movement in 1925.

In 2001, the ICA&#x27;s official flag was changed from a rainbow flag to a rainbow logo flag on a white field, to clearly promote and strengthen the cooperative image, but still use the rainbow image. Other organizations sometimes use the traditional rainbow flag as a symbol of cooperation.

Like the rainbow, this flag is a symbol of hope and peace. The seven colours from flags around the world fly in harmony. Each of the seven colours in the co-operative flag have been assigned the following meaning:
* red: stands for courage
* orange: offers the vision of possibilities
* yellow: represents the challenge that &quot;green&quot; has kindled
* green: indicates a challenge to co-operators to strive for growth of membership and of understanding of the aims and values of co-operation
* light blue: suggests far horizons – the need to provide education and help less fortunate people and strive toward global unity
* dark blue: suggests pessimism – a reminder that less fortunate people have needs that may be met through the benefits of cooperation
* violet: is the colour of warmth, beauty, and friendship

The ICA has been flying a flag with its official logo since April 2001, when its Board decided to replace the traditional rainbow flag. Its use by a number of non-cooperative groups led to confusion in several countries around the world.

===Peace movement (1961)===

This rainbow flag in Italy was first used in a peace march in 1961, inspired by similar multi-coloured flags used in demonstrations against nuclear weapons. It became popular with the &quot;Pace da tutti i balconi&quot; (&quot;peace from every balcony&quot;) campaign in 2002, started as a protest against the impending war in Iraq. The most common variety has seven colours, purple, blue, azure, green, yellow, orange and red, and is emblazoned in bold with the Italian word &quot;PACE&quot;, meaning &quot;peace&quot;.

Common variations include moving the purple stripe down below the azure one, and adding a white stripe on top (the original flag from the 60s had a white stripe on top). This flag has been adopted internationally as a symbol of the peace movement.

===Andean indigenism (1973, 2009)===


The Flag of Cusco was introduced in Peru in 1973, and became used as the official emblem of the city of Cusco. In 2007, the municipality decided to modify the flag design so that it would not be confused with the Gay Pride flag. The new flag design was implemented in 2021. In Ecuador, a rainbow emblem is used by the &quot;Pachakutik&quot; political party (1995), which is composed mostly of left-wing indigenous people.

A seven-striped rainbow flag design is used in Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador as a symbol of native ethnic groups and culture, and is anachronistically associated with the Tawantin Suyu, or Inca territory. Although commonly believed in Peru to be a flag of the Incan Empire, the oldest known rainbow flag dates back only to the 18th century and was used by Túpac Amaru II during his indigenous revolt against the Spanish. María Rostworowski, a Peruvian historian known for her extensive and detailed publications about Peruvian Ancient Cultures and the Inca Empire, said about this: &quot;I bet my life, the Inca never had that flag, it never existed, no chronicler mentioned it&quot;. The National Academy of Peruvian History has stated on the topic: &quot;The official use of the wrongly called &#x27;Tawantinsuyu flag&#x27; is a mistake. In the pre-Hispanic Andean world the concept of flags did not exist, it did not belong to their historic context&quot;.

=== LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender) Pride (1978) ===

The rainbow Pride flag was popularized as a symbol of the gay community by San Francisco artist Gilbert Baker in 1978. The different colors are often associated with &quot;diversity&quot; in the gay community, but actually have symbolic meanings. The flag is used predominantly at LGBT pride events and in gay villages worldwide in various forms including banners, clothing and jewelry. Since the 1990s, its symbolism has been transferred to represent the extended &quot;LGBTQ&quot; (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) community. In 1994, for the 25th anniversary of the Stonewall riots in New York city, a mile-long rainbow flag was created by Baker which he later cut into sections that were distributed around the world.

The flag was originally created with eight colors, but pink and turquoise were removed for production purposes, and since 1979 it has consisted of six colored stripes. It is most commonly flown with the red stripe on top, as the colors appear in a natural rainbow. The colors were determined to symbolize: 
* red: life
* orange: healing
* yellow: sunlight
* green: nature
* blue: harmony/peace
* purple/violet: spirit

The color pink stood for sexuality and turquoise stood for art/magic.

During the 1980s, a black stripe representing AIDS victims was added to the bottom of a rainbow flag as a seventh color and named the &quot;Victory Over AIDS&quot; flag.

In the late 2010s, the 1978 Pride flag by Gilbert Baker was annexed with separate flags containing additional colors representing individual segments of the LGBT community: in 2017, a collaboration between the Philadelphia Office of LGBT Affairs and the Tierney Agency added a brown and a black stripe at the top of the Pride flag to symbolize black and brown people of color, naming the design the &quot;More Color, More Pride&quot; (aka &quot;Philly Pride&quot;) flag; and in 2018, the &quot;Progress Pride&quot; flag by Daniel Quasar incorporated the black and brown stripes of the Philly Pride flag, and colors of the 1999 transgender flag by Monica Helms, as a chevron on the Pride flag symbolizing queer, trans, and people of color. However, unlike the Gilbert Baker flag, transgender flag, and &quot;More Color, More Pride&quot; flag designs which are in the public domain, the Progress Pride flag is copyrighted and fees are paid to Quasar for commercial duplication and sales of his design.

=== Basque nationalism (1978)===
The leftist Herri Batasuna party used a rainbow version of the Ikurriña (Basque national flag) from 1978 until it was dissolved in 2001.

===Jewish Autonomous Oblast (1996)===

Another variation of rainbow flag is used by Jewish Autonomous Oblast, situated in the Far Eastern Federal District of Russia, by the Chinese border. Proportions 2:3. Adopted first of October 1996.

The Jewish Autonomous Oblast has a flag with a seven-colour rainbow. The number of colours is meant to symbolize the seven-branched Jewish Menorah. Its colours are slightly different from the basic spectral colours, with gold in place of yellow, vivid blue instead of light blue, and indigo as dark blue. In 2013, the flag was checked according to the Russian gay propaganda law. JAO flag was confirmed as safe because of white background, white borders to the stripes and the seventh (light blue) colour.

===Infection prevention thorough declaration sticker (2020)===

The Tokyo Metropolitan Government issued the &quot;Thorough Infection Prevention Declaration Sticker&quot; for the purpose of working on the infection spread prevention guidelines for businesses formulated by the metropolitan government. In the media, it is also known as the rainbow sticker. A checklist that businesses should take to prevent the spread of infection is checked on the web and issued online, and it is used as a guideline to show that businesses are working on infection prevention measures.

===Support for the NHS (2020)===
During the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United Kingdom, the rainbow symbol has been used to signify support and gratitude for the National Health Service (NHS). However, the increasing association of the six-color Pride rainbow flag with the NHS has caused concern among some members of the LGBT community that it is being disassociated &quot;as a symbol of LGBT equality&quot; and may lead to the erasure of identity.

<text>Utah County is the second-most populous county in the U.S. state of Utah. The county seat and largest city is Provo, which is the state&#x27;s fourth-largest city, and the largest outside of Salt Lake County. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 659,399.

Utah County is one of two counties forming the Provo-Orem metropolitan area, and is part of the larger Salt Lake City metropolitan area. In 2020, the center of population of Utah was in Utah County, in the city of Saratoga Springs.

Utah County is one of the fastest-growing counties in the United States, ranking among the top ten counties in numerical growth. Correspondingly, Provo–Orem is among the top eight metropolitan areas by percentage growth in the country.

Utah County is one of seven counties in the United States to have the same name as its state. The other six counties are Arkansas County, Hawaii County, Idaho County, Iowa County, Oklahoma County and New York County (commonly known as Manhattan).

==History==
The legislature of the State of Deseret created a county on January 31, 1850, to govern the civic affairs of Utah Valley, which by the 1850s was bustling with newly arrived settlers. The county name is derived from the valley name, which is derived from the Spanish name (&quot;Yuta&quot;) for the Ute Indians. The State of Deseret dissolved soon after (April 5, 1851), but the counties it had set in place continued. There is little record of any official activity conducted by the fledgling county until April 18, 1852, when a full slate of county officials was published, and recordkeeping began. The first courthouse was built in central Provo in 1866–67. It was soon outgrown and was replaced by a second courthouse (1872–73). By the 1920s, this building was also cramped, and the decision was made to erect a combined city-county building, which was completed in 1926.

The county&#x27;s boundaries were adjusted in 1852, 1854, 1856, 1862, 1880, and 1884. It has retained its present boundary since 1884.

==Geography==

Utah County terrain ranges from steep mountain ranges in the east (the Wasatch Range), dropping steeply to a large lake-filled valley. Most of the comparatively level ground is dedicated to agriculture or developed uses, while most of the steep terrain is covered with arid-climate forestation. The county generally slopes to the west and north, with its highest point (the northern peak of the twin-peaked Mt. Nebo in the southern part of the county), at ASL. The county has an area of , of which is land and (6.6%) is water.

Utah Valley lies at the center of the county, lined by the mountains of the Wasatch Range on the east. Utah Lake occupies a large part of the valley. The elevation ranges from above sea level at the lake to at the peak of Mount Nebo.

==Government==
The government is a three-member elected county commission elected at-large. Other elected officials include the county sheriff, the county clerk, county recorder, county assessor, county surveyor, county treasurer, and the county attorney. The current county attorney is Jeff Gray.

In 2020, Utah County voters rejected Proposition 9, which would have changed the county&#x27;s government to a five-member elected county council with an elected county mayor.

The first sheriff of the county was John T. Willis, who was succeeded by William Madison Wall. Alexander Williams served during John Cradlebaugh&#x27;s court in 1859. He was succeeded by Eli Whipple, who resigned in 1861 and was replaced by Russell Kelly. In 2020, Sheriff Mike Smith publicly stated he would not enforce COVID-19 face mask mandates.

The Utah County Fire Department provides emergency response to all unincorporated areas within Utah County and works with all the incorporated cities within the county plus all Utah state and federal lands. The department is primarily a wildland fires response and urban interspace service with some structure fire and HAZMAT abatement capability.

===Politics===












Utah County has been referred to as &quot;the most Republican county in the most Republican state in the United States&quot;. It has voted for a Democratic presidential candidate nine times since statehood, but has not done so since 1964.

In the 1992 presidential election, George H. W. Bush received the most votes and Bill Clinton was third in votes received. In the 2004 presidential election, 85.99% voted for George W. Bush. In the 2008 U.S. presidential election, the county voted for John McCain by a 58.9% margin over Barack Obama, compared to McCain winning by 28.1% statewide. Eight other Utah counties voted more strongly in favor of McCain. In the 2012 election, Mitt Romney received 88.32% of the vote. In 2016, it gave a slim majority of the vote to Donald Trump, and nearly 30% of the vote to independent candidate Evan McMullin, who outperformed Hillary Clinton in the county. This was McMullin&#x27;s largest share of the vote in any county in Utah and his second best nationwide after Madison County, Idaho. In 2020, Democratic candidate Joe Biden received over 75,000 votes, easily a record for the party - no Democratic candidate had previously received more than 30,000 votes in the county - but it amounted to barely a quarter of the county vote as Trump received two-thirds of the total.

Until 2013, Utah County was represented entirely by one congressional district. Currently, the county is split between two congressional districts. Most of the county&#x27;s population is in the 3rd District, represented by Republican John Curtis, former Provo Mayor. Much of the county&#x27;s area however, including Utah Lake, resides in the 4th District currently represented by Republican Burgess Owens.

The county&#x27;s Republican bent runs right through state and local politics. All five state senators representing the county, as well as all 14 state representatives, are Republicans.

==Social issues==
Utah County saw high rates of opioid and other prescription drug addiction from the mid-2000s onwards, foreshadowing the national opioid crisis. The 2008 documentary &quot;Happy Valley&quot; examined the problem.

&quot;Giving USA&quot;, which reports on charitable giving in the US, named Utah County as one of the three most generous counties in philanthropic donations, alongside San Juan County, Utah and Madison County, Idaho.

In 2019, one in eight people and one in six children in the county did not have sufficient food.

==Infrastructure==
Much of Utah&#x27;s transportation infrastructure was built to support automobiles. Prior to the 1950s, Utah County relied on the U.S. Highway System for local transportation. When I-15 was built in 1956 (parallel to Highway 89), it became the dominant transportation vein in the state. The I-15 CORE project added multiple lanes on I-15 through most of Utah County. This expanded of freeway and was completed in 2012. Other construction projects by UDOT have been done on I-15 since then, including the Technology Corridor project and the Point of the Mountain project. However, the highway system retains its significance in Utah County due to the mountainous terrain. Highway 6 is the closest major road connecting Colorado to the Wasatch Front, running through Spanish Fork Canyon before converging with I-15 in the city of Spanish Fork. Portions of Highway 89 have become prominent local roads known collectively as &#x27;State Street&#x27;. Highway 189 is known as &#x27;University Avenue&#x27; in the city of Provo, and runs through Provo Canyon into Heber in neighboring Wasatch County.

Utah County has seen significant growth in public transportation over the past 15 years, owing in part to the county&#x27;s large student population of more than 70,000 commuting to-and-from Brigham Young University (BYU) in Provo and Utah Valley University (UVU) in Orem. The two cities jointly operate UVX, a bus rapid transit system, as part of their city bus routes. Provo also serves as the southernmost terminus of the FrontRunner, Utah&#x27;s intrastate commuter rail service. The Provo FrontRunner station is located on South University Avenue, directly southwest of Amtrak&#x27;s Provo Station—which is Utah&#x27;s third westbound stop, after Green River and Helper, for the California Zephyr Amtrak route. In addition to Provo, The FrontRunner currently has three stops in the county. The Orem FrontRunner station is located on the west side of I-15, served by a pedestrian bridge over the freeway that connects the UVU campus directly to the station. An additional stop in Vineyard, Utah was completed in August 2022. Utah County also operates the American Fork FrontRunner Station and the Lehi FrontRunner Station located near Thanksgiving Point. From Lehi, the FrontRunner leaves Utah County and enters Salt Lake County.

<text>Uintah County ( ) is a county in the U.S. state of Utah. As of the 2020 United States census the population was 35,620. Its county seat and largest city is Vernal. The county was named for the portion of the Ute Indian tribe that lived in the basin.

Uintah County is the largest natural gas producer in Utah, with 272 billion cubic feet produced in 2008.

The Vernal, UT Micropolitan Statistical Area includes all of Uintah County.

Uintah County is home to one of the nine statewide regional campuses of Utah State University (located in the city of Vernal) and serves as a gateway to Dinosaur National Monument and the Uintah Mountain Range.

==History==
Archeological evidence suggests that portions of the Uinta Basin have been inhabited by Archaic peoples and Fremont peoples. By the time of recorded history, its inhabitants were the Ute people. The first known traverse by non-Indians was made by Fathers Domínguez and Escalante (1776), as they sought to establish a land route between California and Spanish America.

The region was claimed by the Spanish Empire as the Alta California division of New Spain (1521-1821) and was later under Mexican control (1821-1848). Neither the Spanish Empire nor Mexico ever had a major presence in the area and their practical control was nominal.

By the early nineteenth century, occasional fur trappers entered the Basin. In 1831-32 Antoine Robidoux, a French trapper licensed by the Mexican government established a trading post near present-day Whiterocks. He abandoned the effort in 1844.

In 1847 a contingent of Mormons under Brigham Young entered the Great Salt Lake Valley to the west of the Uintah region to establish what would become Salt Lake City. In 1861 Young dispatched an exploring party to the Uinta Basin; they reported &quot;that section of country lying between the Wasatch Mountains and the eastern boundary of the territory, and south of Green River country, was one vast contiguity of waste and measurably valueless.&quot; Young made no further effort to establish communities in the area but nonetheless included it in their proposed State of Deseret.

The United States took possession under the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. In 1861 US President Abraham Lincoln created the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation, reserved for the use and habitation of Utah and Colorado Indians. In the 1880s, the Uncompahgre Reservation was created in the southern portion of present-day Uintah County. Ashley Valley was not part of either Reservation; by 1880, enough ranchers and farmers had settled there that the Territorial Legislature created Uintah County from portions of Sanpete, Summit, and Wasatch counties. They established the county seat at Ashley, a now-abandoned settlement three miles north of the present courthouse in Vernal.

Uintah County boundaries were altered in 1892 (Grand County created), in 1917 (adjustments with Duchesne and Summit county boundaries), in 1918 (Daggett County created), and in 1919 (the Daggett boundary line was adjusted). It has remained in its present configuration since 1919.

Gilsonite was discovered in 1888 at Bonanza, in central Uintah County. This mineral was located on Reservation land, and, according to several sources, miners pressured the US government to remove about 7000 acres ( from the Reservation. Mining and its associated activities rapidly boomed in that area.

The northern boundary of Uintah County originally extended to the north border of Utah. In 1918, the extreme northern portion (lying north of the Uinta Mountain watershed divide) was split off to form Daggett County.

==Geography==
Uintah County lies on the east side of Utah. Its eastern border abuts the western border of the state of Colorado. The Green River flows southwestward through the central part of the county and forms the lower part of Uintah County&#x27;s border with Duchesne County. Two miles south of Ouray, Utah, it is joined by the Duchesne River (flowing east-southeastward from Duchesne County), and farther down by the White River (flowing west-northwestward from Colorado). Ten miles farther downstream, it is joined by Willow Creek, flowing northward from the lower part of the county. The county terrain slopes to the south and to the west, with its highest parts found on the crests of the Uinta Mountains, running east–west across the northern border. The maximum elevation along those crests is around . The county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.5%) is water.

Uintah County is centered in the Uintah Basin, which runs from western Colorado on the east to the Wasatch Mountains on the west and from the Uinta Mountains on the north to the Roan Plateau on the south. This basin was formed by a prehistoric lake (&quot;Uinta Lake&quot;) during the late Tertiary period.

The county&#x27;s geography ranges from high mountain terrain (Uinta Mountains) to the fertile Ashley Valley (site of the county seat), to a rugged and desolate canyonland which includes the Dinosaur National Monument, to desolate and largely uninhabited hills in the south (&quot;The Bookcliffs&quot; to locals; officially Roan Plateau).

==Economy==
The extraction of natural resources, including oil, natural gas, phosphate, and gilsonite constitute primary economic activity of Uintah County. There is some agriculture in Uintah County, primarily focusing on raising cattle and sheep and cultivating alfalfa.

A significant portion of west Uintah County is taken up by the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation. The Ute Tribe&#x27;s headquarters is in Fort Duchesne. Much of the rest of the county is land owned by the Ashley National Forest and the Bureau of Land Management. There is relatively little private land in the county.

The Discovery of significant dinosaurs and other pre-historic remains on the eastern edge of the county caused nationwide interest, which culminated in the establishment of Dinosaur National Monument. In addition to the large Visitor Center at the Monument&#x27;s Jensen site, a natural history museum, the Utah Field House of Natural History State Park Museum, showcasing some of the area&#x27;s finds, was established in Vernal by the State of Utah.

==Transportation==
===Airport===
Located in southeastern Vernal, the Vernal Regional Airport provides daily scheduled air service to Denver, Colorado via Denver International Airport. Service is provided through United Express, operated by Skywest airlines. Fixed-Base Operator (FBO) service is available.

Since 1896 when Utah was admitted to The Union, Uintah County has voted for the Democratic presidential nominee eight times: twice from 1896 to 1900, once in 1916, and five times from 1932 to 1948. Only once has the majority voted for a &quot;third party&quot; candidate, that being Theodore Roosevelt in 1912. Since 1948, like most of Utah, Uintah County has voted Republican by substantial margins.

<text>Washington County is a county in the southwestern corner of Utah, United States. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 180,279, making it the fifth-most populous county in Utah. Its county seat and largest city is St. George. The county was created in 1852 and organized in 1856. It was named after the first President of the United States, George Washington. A portion of the Paiute Indian Reservation is in western Washington County. Washington County comprises the St. George, UT Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The earliest settlement was Fort Harmony in 1852. Santa Clara was established in 1854 as a mission to the natives who lived on the Santa Clara River. Hamblin and Pinto were settled along the Los Angeles - Salt Lake Road in 1856, as was Gunlock in 1857.

Next came the settlements established as colonies to grow cotton before the beginning of the American Civil War (1861-1865). They were located along the Virgin River, in the warmer climate below the central Great Basin, which was for decades called &quot;Utah&#x27;s Dixie&quot;. The first settlement was Virgin, and Washington in 1857. Heberville, Pintura and Toquerville followed in 1858, Grafton, Harrisburg and Pine Valley in 1859, Adventure in 1860, Duncans Retreat, Northrop, Shonesburg and St. George in 1861.

Fort Harmony, Adventure, and Northrup were abandoned, and Santa Clara, St. George, Washington, Harrisburg, Heberville, Grafton, and Duncans Retreat were nearly destroyed by the Great Flood of 1862 that followed 44 days of rainfall in January and February 1862. New Harmony, Springdale and Rockville were founded in 1862 by settlers flooded out of Fort Harmony, Adventure, Northrup and other places in the vicinity. Harrisburg was relocated.

Shoal Creek later called Hebron, was a ranching community established in 1862 west of the county. Leeds was settled in 1867, and Silver Reef was a mining town begun in 1875 and abandoned by 1891 due to the collapse in silver prices.

The old federal Utah Territory&#x27;s territorial legislature created Washington County on March 3, 1852, in the southern border area of the Territory, adjacent to the then old federal New Mexico Territory of 1850-1912. It was not fully organized at that time, and so it was attached to Iron County, which was adjacent to the north for temporary administrative and judicial purposes in its county seat town and courthouse of Parowan, for its first four years. This continued until February 23, 1856, when the organization was completed, Saint George was listed as the newly designated county seat and site of a courthouse, and the attachment to Iron County was terminated. The county boundaries were altered a dozen times after that; but its boundaries have retained their present configuration since March 10, 1892, four years before statehood was achieved in 1896.

==Geography==
Washington County lies in the southwest corner of Utah. Its south border abuts the northern border of the state of Arizona, and its west border abuts the east border of the state of Nevada. Its terrain is rough and arid, with a little area devoted to agriculture. It is a mixture of mountains and flat stretches. The terrain slopes to the south and west; the lowest point in the state of Utah is located in the Beaver Dam Wash in Washington County, where it (seasonally) flows out of Utah and into Arizona, at ASL. The county&#x27;s highest point is Signal Peak in the Pine Valley Mountains, at ASL. The county has a total area of , of which is land and (comprising 0.1%) is water.

Washington County is made up of three major geographic areas; the Colorado Plateau in the east-northeast, the Great Basin in the northwest, and the Mojave Desert in the south-southwest.

===Greater St. George===
Most of the population is centered in the south-central part of the county near the Arizona border around St. George. Most national shopping, dining, and hospitality chains are located here, along with several local businesses. The climate of this section of the county is typical of the Mojave Desert in which it lies; its annual rainfall is 8 inches, and it is the lowest elevation in Washington County, making it particularly hot and dry compared to the rest of the county. Most homes are located in subdivisions characteristic of a growing urban sprawl. In Downtown St. George, several local restaurants and stores call the area home, and despite its small size, it tends to attract many locals and tourists alike. To combat the sprawl (which threatens many nature reserves and increases congestion), growth and promotion are projected inward to the central area of St. George, with many new infill developments being planned and constructed. The center of the city, or downtown, also contains Utah Tech University, the only four-year college within a radius. Dixie High School is also located in the downtown area.

Most commercial and industrial lots exist in the eastern portion of the Greater St. George Area in eastern St. George and Washington. Rapidly expanding suburbs also exist there, especially in an area known as Washington Fields. Large irrigated farms have been sold to commercial and residential developers to make way for the anticipated need for more housing and business. Pine View High School is in this section and serves the east side and Washington. To accommodate the rapidly expanding population, an additional high school (Crimson Cliffs High School) has been built in the Washington Fields area.

The western portion of the urban area contains the suburbs of Santa Clara and Ivins, and the neighborhoods of Green Valley, Dixie Downs, Sunset, and Tonaquint. Due to this area&#x27;s proximity to Snow Canyon State Park, this has resulted in the construction of many resort-style communities and gated subdivisions such as Entrada, Kayenta, and the Palisades, with homes often exceeding $1,000,000 in price. However, there are still many other neighborhoods and older houses that tend to be more affordable. This section is served by Snow Canyon High School.

The southern portion of the city contains the neighborhoods of Southgate, Bloomington, Bloomington Hills, SunRiver, Desert&#x27;s Edge (near the airport), and Hidden Valley and is served by Desert Hills High School. Limitations on development in this area exist due to terrain, and as such, it contains less population than its east and west counterparts. The SR-7 freeway, also known as Southern Parkway, has been built as a beltway to accommodate future growth in the southeastern portion of St. George and Washington. The partially constructed freeway also connects to St. George Regional Airport, and in the future, will provide a vital connection to the community of Hurricane, which will thereby provide quicker and more efficient access to Zion National Park, thus providing an alternative route to Interstate 15.

Despite its scenic location amid red sandstone, lava fields, and the backdrop of the Pine Valley Mountains, the northern area of St. George is almost entirely undeveloped due to the Red Cliffs National Conservation Area, which protects a variety of endangered wildlife and unspoiled desert. The only communities in northern St. George are The Ledges and Winchester Hills in the west, and Green Springs, near Washington, in the east. While the community of Winchester Hills has existed for many decades, The Ledges is a newer development met with significant controversy. A few houses in the gate portion feature what many consider to be multimillion-dollar views of Snow Canyon State Park and are visible from inside the state park. This has led many to believe that the beauty of Snow Canyon is in jeopardy due to the City of St. George&#x27;s willingness to sell the land around the park to private companies. In reality, only three houses are visible inside the canyon, although more visible lots exist to be built upon. On the opposite end of the city is Green Springs, an upscale multimillion-dollar development that consists of a golf course and many distinct gated and non-gated housing communities.

On the east side of the metropolitan area lies the cities of Hurricane and La Verkin. Because this locale is disconnected from the rest of the area by undeveloped swaths of land, it is still usually considered distinct from urban St. George, though this may change in the future due to anticipated development that will connect these cities. This area is more farm-based and rural than St. George, but is still experiencing rapid expansion in commercial, industrial, and residential development like the rest of the region. It is served by Hurricane High School.

===Outside the urban area===
While the entire county, due to its large size, is considered part of the St. George Metropolitan Area, most land in the county is rural.
In the middle and north of Washington County, a sparse population exists. The center-county communities of Central and Pine Valley are popular resort communities and contain many cabins and recreational parks due to their locations in Dixie National Forest and the Pine Valley Mountains. Veyo and Dammeron Valley, also near the center of the county, are primarily ranching towns, with most houses situated on large plots of land. This central area of Washington County is generally more wet and humid than the rest of the county due to its high elevation and high precipitation. In Pine Valley, precipitation often exceeds 20 inches per year.

The northern portion of Washington County is semi-arid and dry, albeit less so than in the southern portion. The only incorporated town in this area is Enterprise with a population of just over 1,700. Enterprise is the home of the only secondary school outside of the Greater St. George Area, Enterprise High School. The town contains a small grocery store and multiple gas stations but is very quaint and rural when compared to the urban area of St. George.

Western Washington County is home to Gunlock; also a ranching town, and a small Native American reserve named Shivwits, occupied by the Shivwits Band of Paiutes. This area of the county is also the location of the lowest area of the state, Beaver Dam Wash.

Eastern Washington County is also sparsely populated. However, the towns of Rockville and Springdale are filled with major hotels and resorts, despite their small sizes. This is due to their extreme proximity to Zion National Park, one of the most visited national parks in the United States. Springdale, in particular, contains many kitschy shopping and dining options. Most of the income in these two towns is fueled by tourism alone.

The county includes an area along the Old Spanish Trail called Mountain Meadows, just south of Enterprise on SR-18. Zion National Park is located in the eastern part of Washington County.

<text>Wayne County is a county in the U.S. state of Utah. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 2,486, making it the fourth-least populous county in Utah. Its county seat is Loa.

==History==
Due to its remoteness and harsh terrain, settlements did not appear in the future Wayne County until the 1880s. By 1892, there was enough settlement and enough interest in a separate county (due mainly to the difficulty of accessing the Piute County seat), that Utah Territory passed an act (effective date March 10, 1892) to separate the east portion of Piute into a separate county. The county was named for Wayne County, Tennessee, itself named for Anthony Wayne. The county boundaries have remained unchanged since its creation.

==Geography==
The eastern border of Wayne County is delineated by the meanders of the Green River, which flows southward to discharge into the Colorado River. After the two rivers join, the combined southwestern flow forms the remaining portion of the county&#x27;s eastern border. The central part of the county is drained by the Fremont River and Muddy Creek. The Fremont begins at Fish Lake in Sevier County and flows into Wayne County near its northwestern corner. It joins the Muddy near Hanksville to form the Dirty Devil River, which flows southeastward out of the county&#x27;s southern border to discharge into Colorado. Wayne County terrain varies from rough forestland on the west to arid poor soil carved by drainages and rocky outcrops. The terrain slopes to the east and south; its highest area is near its NW corner, at ASL. The county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.2%) is water.

The Green River, passing through the canyons of Canyonlands National Park, forms the eastern boundary. The San Rafael Desert occupies the center of the county. Thousand Lake Mountain and Boulder Mountain flank Rabbit Valley on the western end of the county, where forests contrast with the deserts to the east. The small population of the county is centered in Rabbit Valley, with one town of 200, Hanksville, located in Graves Valley north of the Henry Mountains. Wayne County is also home to Capitol Reef National Park.

<text>Weber County ( ) is a county in the U.S. state of Utah. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 262,223, making it Utah&#x27;s fourth-most populous county. Its county seat and largest city is Ogden, the home of Weber State University. The county was named after a fur trapper John Weber.

Weber County is part of the Ogden-Clearfield, UT Metropolitan Statistical Area as well as the Salt Lake City-Provo-Ogden, UT Combined Statistical Area.

==History==
The Weber Valley was visited by many trappers seeking beavers and muskrats along its streams. One of the first on record reached the area in 1824, traveling from Fort Bridger. He reported that the Bear River flowed into a salt bay. Peter Skene Ogden passed through in 1826, representing the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. He traded in this area for several years, near present-day North Ogden. John C. Frémont explored the Weber Valley in 1843 and made maps of the area. The Fremont reports encouraged readers to seek their fortunes in the western frontier. Miles Goodyear was a fur trapper who constructed a way station on the Weber River in 1845. In 1847 he sold it to incoming Mormon pioneers. James Brown purchased and changed the site&#x27;s name to Brownsville (later changed to Ogden).

After the Mormon pioneers began filling out into the future state of Utah, the fledgling government (as of 1849 known as State of Deseret) began a system of government. On January 31, 1850, the legislature provided for the creation of six counties to generally cover the area, named in this order:
* Weber (with Ogden as county seat)
* Great Salt Lake
* Utah
* San Pete
* Tuilla
* Little Salt Lake

The county boundaries were better defined by the 1852 Utah Territory legislature. The borders were adjusted by subsequent acts in 1855, 1856, and 1862. The creation of Nevada Territory in 1862 also administratively reduced the county&#x27;s territory significantly since its 1852 description had it running to the Sierra Nevada mountains in central California. A final adjustment in 1880 concerning the various lands in the Great Salt Lake area brought the county&#x27;s borders to their present configuration.

As of the 1852 description, the original Weber County stretched from California in the west, to the Oregon boundary on the north, to a point in the middle Davis County in the south. As Nevada and the State of Utah evolved, Weber County was trimmed so that it now occupies a stretch of the Wasatch Front, part of the eastern shores of Great Salt Lake, and much of the rugged Wasatch Mountains.

==Geography==
The county extends from high in the Wasatch Range in the east into a portion of the Great Salt Lake to the west, where the county&#x27;s elongated point exists. The Weber and Ogden rivers and their tributaries run through its valleys. The Weber County Surveyor&#x27;s office divides the county into two regions, the &quot;Lower Valley&quot; and the &quot;Upper Valley&quot;, divided by the ridge of the Wasatch front range south through the county. Lower Valley, adjacent to the Lake, is the county&#x27;s more populous part. The Upper Valley consists mostly of the Ogden Valley, the watershed of the Ogden River. The county&#x27;s highest elevation is Willard Peak in the Wasatch Mountains, at ASL. The county has an area of , of which is land and (13%) is water. It is the second-smallest county in Utah by land area and third-smallest by total area.

===Major highways===
Many roads in Weber County are named in a numerical grid system with an street name difference of 800 corresponding to one mile in a similar vein to Salt Lake County. In April 1947, North Ogden was the first municipality in Weber County to adopt the grid system, resulting in the north/south demarcator (1st Street) being placed in the northern half of the county. The east/west demarcator was selected as Wall Avenue which runs parallel to downtown Ogden.

<text>In information theory, the Shannon–Hartley theorem tells the maximum rate at which information can be transmitted over a communications channel of a specified bandwidth in the presence of noise. It is an application of the noisy-channel coding theorem to the archetypal case of a continuous-time analog communications channel subject to Gaussian noise. The theorem establishes Shannon&#x27;s channel capacity for such a communication link, a bound on the maximum amount of error-free information per time unit that can be transmitted with a specified bandwidth in the presence of the noise interference, assuming that the signal power is bounded, and that the Gaussian noise process is characterized by a known power or power spectral density. The law is named after Claude Shannon and Ralph Hartley.

==Statement of the theorem==

The Shannon–Hartley theorem states the channel capacity formula_1, meaning the theoretical tightest upper bound on the information rate of data that can be communicated at an arbitrarily low error rate using an average received signal power formula_2 through an analog communication channel subject to additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) of power 

:formula_3

where
* formula_1 is the channel capacity in bits per second, a theoretical upper bound on the net bit rate (information rate, sometimes denoted formula_5) excluding error-correction codes;
* formula_6 is the bandwidth of the channel in hertz (passband bandwidth in case of a bandpass signal);
* formula_2 is the average received signal power over the bandwidth (in case of a carrier-modulated passband transmission, often denoted &quot;C&quot;), measured in watts (or volts squared);
* formula_8 is the average power of the noise and interference over the bandwidth, measured in watts (or volts squared); and
* formula_9 is the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) or the carrier-to-noise ratio (CNR) of the communication signal to the noise and interference at the receiver (expressed as a linear power ratio, not as logarithmic decibels).

==Historical development==

During the late 1920s, Harry Nyquist and Ralph Hartley developed a handful of fundamental ideas related to the transmission of information, particularly in the context of the telegraph as a communications system. At the time, these concepts were powerful breakthroughs individually, but they were not part of a comprehensive theory. In the 1940s, Claude Shannon developed the concept of channel capacity, based in part on the ideas of Nyquist and Hartley, and then formulated a complete theory of information and its transmission.

===Nyquist rate===

In 1927, Nyquist determined that the number of independent pulses that could be put through a telegraph channel per unit time is limited to twice the bandwidth of the channel. In symbolic notation,

:formula_10

where formula_11 is the pulse frequency (in pulses per second) and formula_6 is the bandwidth (in hertz). The quantity formula_13 later came to be called the &quot;Nyquist rate&quot;, and transmitting at the limiting pulse rate of formula_13 pulses per second as &quot;signalling at the Nyquist rate&quot;. Nyquist published his results in 1928 as part of his paper &quot;Certain topics in Telegraph Transmission Theory&quot;.

===Hartley&#x27;s law===

During 1928, Hartley formulated a way to quantify information and its line rate (also known as data signalling rate &quot;R&quot; bits per second). This method, later known as Hartley&#x27;s law, became an important precursor for Shannon&#x27;s more sophisticated notion of channel capacity.

Hartley argued that the maximum number of distinguishable pulse levels that can be transmitted and received reliably over a communications channel is limited by the dynamic range of the signal amplitude and the precision with which the receiver can distinguish amplitude levels. Specifically, if the amplitude of the transmitted signal is restricted to the range of [−&quot;A&quot; ... +&quot;A&quot;] volts, and the precision of the receiver is ±Δ&quot;V&quot; volts, then the maximum number of distinct pulses &quot;M&quot; is given by

:formula_15.

By taking information per pulse in bit/pulse to be the base-2-logarithm of the number of distinct messages &quot;M&quot; that could be sent, Hartley constructed a measure of the line rate &quot;R&quot; as:

:formula_16

where formula_11 is the pulse rate, also known as the symbol rate, in symbols/second or baud.

Hartley then combined the above quantification with Nyquist&#x27;s observation that the number of independent pulses that could be put through a channel of bandwidth formula_6 hertz was formula_13 pulses per second, to arrive at his quantitative measure for achievable line rate.

Hartley&#x27;s law is sometimes quoted as just a proportionality between the analog bandwidth, formula_6, in Hertz and what today is called the digital bandwidth, formula_21, in bit/s.
Other times it is quoted in this more quantitative form, as an achievable line rate of formula_21 bits per second:

:formula_23

Hartley did not work out exactly how the number &quot;M&quot; should depend on the noise statistics of the channel, or how the communication could be made reliable even when individual symbol pulses could not be reliably distinguished to &quot;M&quot; levels; with Gaussian noise statistics, system designers had to choose a very conservative value of formula_24 to achieve a low error rate.

The concept of an error-free capacity awaited Claude Shannon, who built on Hartley&#x27;s observations about a logarithmic measure of information and Nyquist&#x27;s observations about the effect of bandwidth limitations.

Hartley&#x27;s rate result can be viewed as the capacity of an errorless &quot;M&quot;-ary channel of formula_13 symbols per second. Some authors refer to it as a capacity. But such an errorless channel is an idealization, and if M is chosen small enough to make the noisy channel nearly errorless, the result is necessarily less than the Shannon capacity of the noisy channel of bandwidth formula_6, which is the Hartley–Shannon result that followed later.

===Noisy channel coding theorem and capacity===

Claude Shannon&#x27;s development of information theory during World War II provided the next big step in understanding how much information could be reliably communicated through noisy channels. Building on Hartley&#x27;s foundation, Shannon&#x27;s noisy channel coding theorem (1948) describes the maximum possible efficiency of error-correcting methods versus levels of noise interference and data corruption. The proof of the theorem shows that a randomly constructed error-correcting code is essentially as good as the best possible code; the theorem is proved through the statistics of such random codes.

Shannon&#x27;s theorem shows how to compute a channel capacity from a statistical description of a channel, and establishes that given a noisy channel with capacity formula_1 and information transmitted at a line rate formula_21, then if

:formula_29

there exists a coding technique which allows the probability of error at the receiver to be made arbitrarily small. This means that theoretically, it is possible to transmit information nearly without error up to nearly a limit of formula_1 bits per second.

The converse is also important. If

:formula_31

the probability of error at the receiver increases without bound as the rate is increased, so no useful information can be transmitted beyond the channel capacity. The theorem does not address the rare situation in which rate and capacity are equal.

The Shannon–Hartley theorem establishes what that channel capacity is for a finite-bandwidth continuous-time channel subject to Gaussian noise. It connects Hartley&#x27;s result with Shannon&#x27;s channel capacity theorem in a form that is equivalent to specifying the &quot;M&quot; in Hartley&#x27;s line rate formula in terms of a signal-to-noise ratio, but achieving reliability through error-correction coding rather than through reliably distinguishable pulse levels.

If there were such a thing as a noise-free analog channel, one could transmit unlimited amounts of error-free data over it per unit of time (Note that an infinite-bandwidth analog channel could not transmit unlimited amounts of error-free data absent infinite signal power). Real channels, however, are subject to limitations imposed by both finite bandwidth and nonzero noise.

Bandwidth and noise affect the rate at which information can be transmitted over an analog channel. Bandwidth limitations alone do not impose a cap on the maximum information rate because it is still possible for the signal to take on an indefinitely large number of different voltage levels on each symbol pulse, with each slightly different level being assigned a different meaning or bit sequence. Taking into account both noise and bandwidth limitations, however, there is a limit to the amount of information that can be transferred by a signal of a bounded power, even when sophisticated multi-level encoding techniques are used.

In the channel considered by the Shannon–Hartley theorem, noise and signal are combined by addition. That is, the receiver measures a signal that is equal to the sum of the signal encoding the desired information and a continuous random variable that represents the noise. This addition creates uncertainty as to the original signal&#x27;s value. If the receiver has some information about the random process that generates the noise, one can in principle recover the information in the original signal by considering all possible states of the noise process. In the case of the Shannon–Hartley theorem, the noise is assumed to be generated by a Gaussian process with a known variance. Since the variance of a Gaussian process is equivalent to its power, it is conventional to call this variance the noise power.

Such a channel is called the Additive White Gaussian Noise channel, because Gaussian noise is added to the signal; &quot;white&quot; means equal amounts of noise at all frequencies within the channel bandwidth. Such noise can arise both from random sources of energy and also from coding and measurement error at the sender and receiver respectively. Since sums of independent Gaussian random variables are themselves Gaussian random variables, this conveniently simplifies analysis, if one assumes that such error sources are also Gaussian and independent.

==Implications of the theorem==

===Comparison of Shannon&#x27;s capacity to Hartley&#x27;s law===
Comparing the channel capacity to the information rate from Hartley&#x27;s law, we can find the effective number of distinguishable levels &quot;M&quot;:

:formula_32
:formula_33

The square root effectively converts the power ratio back to a voltage ratio, so the number of levels is approximately proportional to the ratio of signal RMS amplitude to noise standard deviation.

This similarity in form between Shannon&#x27;s capacity and Hartley&#x27;s law should not be interpreted to mean that formula_24 pulse levels can be literally sent without any confusion. More levels are needed to allow for redundant coding and error correction, but the net data rate that can be approached with coding is equivalent to using that formula_24 in Hartley&#x27;s law.

==Frequency-dependent (colored noise) case==

In the simple version above, the signal and noise are fully uncorrelated, in which case formula_36 is the total power of the received signal and noise together. A generalization of the above equation for the case where the additive noise is not white (or that the is not constant with frequency over the bandwidth) is obtained by treating the channel as many narrow, independent Gaussian channels in parallel:

:formula_37

where
* formula_1 is the channel capacity in bits per second;
* formula_6 is the bandwidth of the channel in Hz;
* formula_40 is the signal power spectrum
* formula_41 is the noise power spectrum
* formula_42 is frequency in Hz.

Note: the theorem only applies to Gaussian stationary process noise. This formula&#x27;s way of introducing frequency-dependent noise cannot describe all continuous-time noise processes. For example, consider a noise process consisting of adding a random wave whose amplitude is 1 or −1 at any point in time, and a channel that adds such a wave to the source signal. Such a wave&#x27;s frequency components are highly dependent. Though such a noise may have a high power, it is fairly easy to transmit a continuous signal with much less power than one would need if the underlying noise was a sum of independent noises in each frequency band.

==Approximations==
For large or small and constant signal-to-noise ratios, the capacity formula can be approximated:

===Bandwidth-limited case===
When the SNR is large (), the logarithm is approximated by

:formula_43

in which case the capacity is logarithmic in power and approximately linear in bandwidth (not quite linear, since increases with bandwidth, imparting a logarithmic effect). This is called the bandwidth-limited regime.

:formula_44
where
:formula_45

===Power-limited case===
Similarly, when the SNR is small (if ), applying the approximation to the logarithm:

:formula_46

then the capacity is linear in power. This is called the power-limited regime.

:formula_47

In this low-SNR approximation, capacity is independent of bandwidth if the noise is white, of spectral density formula_48 watts per hertz, in which case the total noise power is formula_49.

==Examples==
# At a SNR of 0 dB (Signal power = Noise power) the Capacity in bits/s is equal to the bandwidth in hertz. 
# If the SNR is 20 dB, and the bandwidth available is 4 kHz, which is appropriate for telephone communications, then C = 4000 log2(1 + 100) = 4000 log2 (101) = 26.63 kbit/s. Note that the value of S/N = 100 is equivalent to the SNR of 20 dB.
# If the requirement is to transmit at 50 kbit/s, and a bandwidth of 10 kHz is used, then the minimum S/N required is given by 50000 = 10000 log2(1+S/N) so C/B = 5 then S/N = 25 − 1 = 31, corresponding to an SNR of 14.91 dB (10 x log10(31)).
# What is the channel capacity for a signal having a 1 MHz bandwidth, received with a SNR of −30 dB ? That means a signal deeply buried in noise. −30 dB means a S/N = 10−3. It leads to a maximal rate of information of 106 log2 (1 + 10−3) = 1443 bit/s. These values are typical of the received ranging signals of the GPS, where the navigation message is sent at 50 bit/s (below the channel capacity for the given S/N), and whose bandwidth is spread to around 1 MHz by a pseudo-noise multiplication before transmission.
# As stated above, channel capacity is proportional to the bandwidth of the channel and to the logarithm of SNR. This means channel capacity can be increased linearly either by increasing the channel&#x27;s bandwidth given a fixed SNR requirement or, with fixed bandwidth, by using higher-order modulations that need a very high SNR to operate. As the modulation rate increases, the spectral efficiency improves, but at the cost of the SNR requirement. Thus, there is an exponential rise in the SNR requirement if one adopts a 16QAM or 64QAM; however, the spectral efficiency improves.

<doc id="71088" wikidata="Q159408" url="?curid=71088" title="Hibernation">
<text>Hibernation is a state of minimal activity and metabolic depression undergone by some animal species. Hibernation is a seasonal heterothermy characterized by low body-temperature, slow breathing and heart-rate, and low metabolic rate. It is most commonly used to pass through winter months – called overwintering.

Although traditionally reserved for &quot;deep&quot; hibernators such as rodents, the term has been redefined to include animals such as bears and is now applied based on active metabolic suppression rather than any absolute decline in body temperature. Many experts believe that the processes of daily torpor and hibernation form a continuum and utilise similar mechanisms. The equivalent during the summer months is aestivation.

Hibernation functions to conserve energy when sufficient food is not available. To achieve this energy saving, an endothermic animal decreases its metabolic rate and thereby its body temperature. Hibernation may last days, weeks, or months—depending on the species, ambient temperature, time of year, and the individual&#x27;s body-condition. Before entering hibernation, animals need to store enough energy to last through the duration of their dormant period, possibly as long as an entire winter. Larger species become hyperphagic, eating a large amount of food and storing the energy in their bodies in the form of fat deposits. In many small species, food caching replaces eating and becoming fat.

Some species of mammals hibernate while gestating young, which are born either while the mother hibernates or shortly afterwards. For example, female black bears go into hibernation during the winter months in order to give birth to their offspring. The pregnant mothers significantly increase their body mass prior to hibernation, and this increase is further reflected in the weight of the offspring. The fat accumulation enables them to provide a sufficiently warm and nurturing environment for their newborns. During hibernation, they subsequently lose 15–27% of their pre-hibernation weight by using their stored fats for energy.

Ectothermic animals also undergo periods of metabolic suppression and dormancy, which in many invertebrates is referred to as diapause. Some researchers and members of the public use the term brumate to describe winter dormancy of reptiles, but the more general term hibernation is believed adequate to refer to any winter dormancy. Many insects, such as the wasp &quot;Polistes exclamans&quot; and the beetle &quot;Bolitotherus&quot;, exhibit periods of dormancy which have often been referred to as hibernation, despite their ectothermy. Botanists may use the term &quot;seed hibernation&quot; to refer to a form of seed dormancy.

==Mammals==
There is a variety of definitions for terms that describe hibernation in mammals, and different mammal clades hibernate differently. The following subsections discuss the terms &quot;obligate&quot; and &quot;facultative&quot; hibernation. The last two sections point out in particular primates, none of whom were thought to hibernate until recently, and bears, whose winter torpor had been contested as not being &quot;true hibernation&quot; during the late 20th century, since it is dissimilar from hibernation seen in rodents.

===Obligate hibernation===

Obligate hibernators are animals that spontaneously, and annually, enter hibernation regardless of ambient temperature and access to food. Obligate hibernators include many species of ground squirrels, other rodents, European hedgehogs and other insectivores, monotremes, and marsupials. These species undergo what has been traditionally called &quot;hibernation&quot;: a physiological state wherein the body temperature drops to near ambient temperature, and heart and respiration rates slow drastically.

The typical winter season for obligate hibernators is characterized by periods of torpor interrupted by periodic, euthermic arousals, during which body temperatures and heart rates are restored to more typical levels. The cause and purpose of these arousals are still not clear; the question of why hibernators may return periodically to normal body temperatures has plagued researchers for decades, and while there is still no clear-cut explanation, there are multiple hypotheses on the topic. One favored hypothesis is that hibernators build a &quot;sleep debt&quot; during hibernation, and so must occasionally warm up to sleep. This has been supported by evidence in the Arctic ground squirrel. Other theories postulate that brief periods of high body temperature during hibernation allow the animal to restore its available energy sources or to initiate an immune response.

Hibernating Arctic ground squirrels may exhibit abdominal temperatures as low as , maintaining sub-zero abdominal temperatures for more than three weeks at a time, although the temperatures at the head and neck remain at or above.

===Facultative hibernation===
Facultative hibernators enter hibernation only when either cold-stressed, food-deprived, or both, unlike obligate hibernators, who enter hibernation based on seasonal timing cues rather than as a response to stressors from the environment.

A chipmunk, for example, is a facultative hibernator. Even though it sleeps for a long period of time, it is not a true obligate hibernator. This is because during the long period of sleep, its temperatures do not decrease to the low levels of hibernation. It only truly hibernates if food is scarce.

A good example of the differences between these two types of hibernation can be seen in prairie dogs. The white-tailed prairie dog is an &quot;obligate&quot; hibernator, while the closely related black-tailed prairie dog is a &quot;facultative&quot; hibernator.

===Primates===
While hibernation has long been studied in rodents (namely ground squirrels), no primate or tropical mammal was known to hibernate until the discovery of hibernation in the fat-tailed dwarf lemur of Madagascar, which hibernates in tree holes for seven months of the year. Malagasy winter temperatures sometimes rise to over , so hibernation is not exclusively an adaptation to low ambient temperatures.

The hibernation of this lemur is strongly dependent on the thermal behaviour of its tree hole: If the hole is poorly insulated, the lemur&#x27;s body temperature fluctuates widely, passively following the ambient temperature; if well insulated, the body temperature stays fairly constant and the animal undergoes regular spells of arousal. Dausmann found that hypometabolism in hibernating animals is not necessarily coupled with low body temperature.

===Bears===

Historically it was unclear whether or not bears truly hibernate, since they experience only a modest decline in body temperature (3–5 °C) compared with the much larger decreases (often 32 °C or more) seen in other hibernators. Many researchers thought that their deep sleep was not comparable with true, deep hibernation, but this theory was refuted by research in 2011 on captive black bears and again in 2016 in a study on brown bears.

Hibernating bears are able to recycle their proteins and urine, allowing them to stop urinating for months and to avoid muscle atrophy. They stay hydrated with the metabolic water that is produced in sufficient quantities to satisfy the water needs of the bear. They also do not eat or drink while hibernating, but live off their stored fat. Despite long-term inactivity and lack of food intake, hibernating bears are believed to maintain their bone mass and do not suffer from osteoporosis. They also increase the availability of certain essential amino acids in the muscle, as well as regulate the transcription of a suite of genes that limit muscle wasting.
A study by G. Edgar Folk, Jill M. Hunt and Mary A. Folk compared EKG of typical hibernators to three different bear species with respect to season, activity and dormancy, and found that the reduced relaxation (QT) interval of small hibernators was the same for the three bear species. They also found the QT interval changed for both typical hibernators and the bears from summer to winter. This 1977 study was one of the first evidences used to show that bears are hibernators.

In a 2016 study, wildlife veterinarian and associate professor at Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences, Alina L. Evans, researched 14 brown bears over three winters. Their movement, heart rate, heart rate variability, body temperature, physical activity, ambient temperature, and snow depth were measured to identify the drivers of the start and end of hibernation for bears. This study built the first chronology of both ecological and physiological events from before the start to the end of hibernation in the field. This research found that bears would enter their den when snow arrived and ambient temperature dropped to 0 °C. However, physical activity, heart rate, and body temperature started to drop slowly even several weeks before this. Once in their dens, the bears&#x27; heart rate variability dropped dramatically, indirectly suggesting metabolic suppression is related to their hibernation. Two months before the end of hibernation, the bears&#x27; body temperature starts to rise, unrelated to heart rate variability but rather driven by the ambient temperature. The heart rate variability only increases around three weeks before arousal and the bears only leave their den once outside temperatures are at their lower critical temperature. These findings suggest that bears are thermoconforming and bear hibernation is driven by environmental cues, but arousal is driven by physiological cues.

==Birds==
Ancient people believed that swallows hibernated, and ornithologist Gilbert White documented anecdotal evidence in his 1789 book &quot;The Natural History of Selborne&quot; that indicated the belief was still current in his time. It is now understood that the vast majority of bird species typically do not hibernate, instead utilizing shorter periods of torpor. One known exception is the common poorwill (&quot;Phalaenoptilus nuttallii&quot;), for which hibernation was first documented by Edmund Jaeger.

==Dormancy and freezing in ectotherms==

Because they cannot actively down-regulate their body temperature or metabolic rate, ectothermic animals (including fish, reptiles, and amphibians) cannot engage in obligate or facultative hibernation. They can experience decreased metabolic rates associated with colder environments or low oxygen availability (hypoxia) and exhibit dormancy (known as brumation). It was once thought that basking sharks settled to the floor of the North Sea and became dormant, but research by David Sims in 2003 dispelled this hypothesis, showing that the sharks traveled long distances throughout the seasons, tracking the areas with the highest quantity of plankton. Epaulette sharks have been documented to be able to survive for three hours without oxygen and at temperatures of up to as a means to survive in their shoreline habitat, where water and oxygen levels vary with the tide. Other animals able to survive long periods with very little or no oxygen include goldfish, red-eared sliders, wood frogs, and bar-headed geese. The ability to survive hypoxic or anoxic conditions is not closely related to endotherm hibernation.

Some animals can literally survive winter by freezing. For example, some fish, amphibians, and reptiles can naturally freeze and then &quot;wake&quot; up in the spring. These species have evolved freeze tolerance mechanism such as antifreeze proteins.

==Hibernation induction trigger (HIT) protein and recombinant protein technology==
Hibernation induction trigger (HIT) proteins isolated from mammals have been used in the study of organ recovery rates. One study in 1997 found that &quot;delta 2&quot; opioid and hibernation induction trigger (HIT) proteins were not able to increase the recovery rate of heart tissue during ischemia. While unable to increase recovery rates at the time of ischemia, the protein precursors were identified to play a role in the preservation of veterinary organ function.

Recent advances in recombinant protein technology make it possible for scientists to manufacture hibernation induction trigger (HIT) proteins in the laboratory without the need for animal euthanasia. Bioengineering of proteins can aid in the protection of vulnerable populations of bears and other mammals that produce valuable proteins. Protein sequencing of HIT proteins, such as α 1-glycoprotein-like 88 kDa hibernation-related protein HRP, contributes to this research pool. A study in 2014 utilizes recombinant technology to construct, express, purify, and isolate animal proteins (HP-20, HP-25, and HP-27) outside of the animal to study key hibernation proteins (HP).

==In humans==
Researchers have studied how to induce hibernation in humans. The ability to hibernate would be useful for a number of reasons, such as saving the lives of seriously ill or injured people by temporarily putting them in a state of hibernation until treatment can be given. For space travel, human hibernation is also under consideration, such as for missions to Mars.

Anthropologists are also studying whether hibernation was possible in early hominid species.

==Evolution of hibernation==

===In endothermic animals===
As the ancestors of birds and mammals colonized land, leaving the relatively stable marine environments, more intense terrestrial seasons began playing a larger role in animals&#x27; lives. Some marine animals do go through periods of dormancy, but the effect is stronger and more widespread in terrestrial environments. As hibernation is a seasonal response, the movement of the ancestor of birds and mammals onto land introduced them to seasonal pressures that would eventually become hibernation. This is true for all clades of animals that undergo winter dormancy; the more prominent the seasons are, the longer the dormant period tends to be on average. Hibernation of endothermic animals has likely evolved multiple times, at least once in mammals—though it is debated whether or not it evolved more than once in mammals—and at least once in birds.

In both cases, hibernation likely evolved simultaneously with endothermy, with the earliest suggested instance of hibernation being in Thrinaxodon, an ancestor of mammals that lived roughly 252 million years ago. The evolution of endothermy allowed animals to have greater levels of activity and better incubation of embryos, among other benefits for animals in the Permian and Triassic periods. In order to conserve energy, the ancestors of birds and mammals would likely have experienced an early form of torpor or hibernation when they were not using their thermoregulatory abilities during the transition from ectothermy to endothermy. This is opposed to the previously dominant hypothesis that hibernation evolved after endothermy in response to the emergence of colder habitats. Body size also had an effect on the evolution of hibernation, as endotherms which grow large enough tend to lose their ability to be selectively heterothermic, with bears being one of very few exceptions. After torpor and hibernation diverged from a common proto-hibernating ancestor of birds and mammals, the ability to hibernate or go through torpor would have been lost in most larger mammals and birds. Hibernation would be less favored in larger animals because as animals increase in size, the surface area to volume ratio decreases, and it takes less energy to keep a high internal body temperature, and thus hibernation becomes unnecessary.

There is evidence that hibernation evolved separately in marsupials and placental mammals, though it is not settled. That evidence stems from development, where as soon as young marsupials from hibernating species are able to regulate their own heat, they have the capability to hibernate. In contrast, placental mammals that hibernate first develop homeothermy, only developing the ability to hibernate at a later point. This difference in development is evidence, though inconclusive, that they evolved by slightly different mechanisms and thus at different times.

===Brumation in reptiles===
As reptiles are ectothermic, having no system to deal with cold temperatures would be deadly in many environments. Reptilian winter dormancy, or brumation, likely evolved to help reptiles survive colder conditions. Reptiles that are dormant in the winter tend to have higher survival rates and slower aging. Reptiles evolved to exploit their ectothermy to deliberately cool their internal body temperatures. As opposed to mammals or birds, which will prepare for their hibernation but not directly cause it through their behavior, reptiles will trigger their own hibernation through their behavior. Reptiles seek out colder temperatures based on a periodic internal clock, which is likely triggered by cooler outside temperatures, as shown in the Texas horned lizard (&quot;Phrynosoma cornutum&quot;). One mechanism that reptiles use to survive hibernation, hypercapnic acidosis (the buildup of carbon dioxide in the blood), is also present in mammal hibernation. This is likely an example of convergent evolution. Hypercapnic acidosis evolved as a mechanism to slow metabolism and also interfere with oxygen transport so that oxygen is not used up and can still reach tissues in low oxygen periods of dormancy.

===Diapause in arthropods===
Seasonal diapause, or arthropod winter dormancy, seems to be plastic and quickly evolving, with large genetic variation and strong effects of natural selection present as well as having evolved many times across many clades of arthropods. As such, there is very little phylogenetic conservation in the genetic mechanism for diapause. Particularly the timing and extent of the seasonal diapause seem particularly variable, currently evolving as a response to climate change. As typical with hibernation, it evolved after the increased influence of seasonality as arthropods colonized terrestrial environments as a mechanism to keep energy costs low, particularly in harsher than normal environments, as well as being a good way to time the active or reproductive periods in arthropods. It is thought to have originally evolved in three stages. The first is development of neuroendocrine control over bodily functions, the second is pairing of that to environmental changes—in this case metabolic rates decreasing in response to colder temperatures—and the third is the pairing of these controls with reliable seasonal indicators within the arthropod, like biological timers. From these steps, arthropods developed a seasonal diapause, where many of their biological functions end up paired with a seasonal rhythm within the organism. This is a very similar mechanism to the evolution of insect migration, where instead of bodily functions like metabolism getting paired with seasonal indicators, movement patterns would be paired with seasonal indicators.

===Winter dormancy in fish===
While most animals that go through winter dormancy lower their metabolic rates, some fish, such as the cunner, do not. Instead, they do not actively depress their base metabolic rate, but instead they simply reduce their activity level. Fish that undergo winter dormancy in oxygenated water survive via inactivity paired with the colder temperature, which decreases energy consumption, but not the base metabolic rate that their bodies consume. But the Antarctic yellowbelly rockcod (&quot;Notothenia coriiceps&quot;), as well as fish that undergo winter dormancy in hypoxic conditions, do suppress their metabolism like other animals that are dormant in the winter. The mechanism for evolution of metabolic suppression in fish is unknown. Most fish that are dormant in the winters save enough energy by being still and so there is not a strong selective pressure to develop a metabolic suppression mechanism like that which is necessary in hypoxic conditions.

<text>Atlantic Canada, also called the Atlantic provinces (), is the region of Eastern Canada comprising four provinces: New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island. As of 2021, the landmass of the four Atlantic provinces was approximately , and had a population of over 2.4 million people. The term &quot;Atlantic Canada&quot; was popularized following the admission of Newfoundland as a Canadian province in 1949. The province of Newfoundland and Labrador is not included in the Maritimes, another significant regional term, but &quot;is&quot; included in Atlantic Canada.

==History==
The Atlantic Provinces are the historical territories of the Mi&#x27;kmaq, Naskapi, Beothuk and Nunatsiavut peoples. The people of Nunatsiavut are the Labrador Inuit (Labradormiut), who are descended from the Thule people.

Leif Erikson and other members of his family began exploring the North American coast in 986 CE. Leif landed in three places, and in the third established a small settlement called Vinland. The location of Vinland is uncertain, but an archaeological site on the northern tip of Newfoundland at L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows has been identified as a good candidate. It was a modest Viking settlement and is the oldest confirmed presence of Europeans in North America. The Vikings would make brief excursions to North America for the next 200 years, though further attempts at colonization were thwarted. The site produced the first evidence of pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact of Europeans with the Americas outside of Greenland.

Acadia, a colony of New France, was established in areas of present-day Atlantic Canada in 1604, under the leadership of Samuel de Champlain and Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons. The French would form alliances with many indigenous groups within Atlantic Canada, including the Mi&#x27;kmaq of Acadia, who joined the Wabanaki Confederacy, important allies to New France.

Competition for control of the island of Newfoundland and its waters contributed to major ongoing conflicts and occasional wars between France and Britain. The first major agreement between the two powers over access to this coastline came with the Treaty of Utrecht of 1713, giving Britain governance over the entire island and establishing the first French Shore, giving France and its migratory fishery almost exclusive access to a substantial stretch of the island&#x27;s coastline.

Despite reoccurring wars and conflicts, Britain acquiesced to France&#x27;s demands for continuing access to this fishery. Between 1755 and 1764 during the Seven Years&#x27; War the British forcibly removed thousands of Acadians from Nova Scotia and New Brunswick in an event known as the Great Expulsion or Le Grand Dérangement. Following the Seven Years War and the Treaty of Paris of 1763, Newfoundland&#x27;s governor, Admiral Hugh Palliser, consolidated British control by carrying out the first systematic hydrographic charting of the island, including the Bay of Islands and Humber Arm, much of it by the Royal Naval officer James Cook.After the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1764 some of the Acadians returned and settled in the area that would become New Brunswick. The effect of this migration can still be seen today as the province of New Brunswick is the only officially bilingual province in Canada with over a quarter of residents speaking French at home.
After the conclusion of the American Revolution with the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1783 many loyalists from the United States settled in the region. This influx of immigrants caused the partition of Nova Scotia creating New Brunswick. Additionally these immigrants changed the culture and character of the region which had historically been French towards more British styled communities. It also marked one of the first large waves of migration to the area that established a predominantly Anglo-Canadian population. Some of the new settlers brought with them Black slaves. Also 3,000 Black loyalists who were slaves during the war and who sided with the British were given freedom and evacuated with other Loyalists from New York to Nova Scotia. Most of the free Blacks settled at Birchtown, the most prominent Black township in North America at the time.

The War of 1812 significantly impacted the provinces of Atlantic Canada where they played crucial roles in naval operations, privateering, and as strategic support bases for the British war effort against the United States.

In the last half of the 19th century the region&#x27;s population grew due to the immigration from Ireland due to the great potato famine. Saint John and Halifax, both port cities, particularly received a significant influx of Irish immigrants within the region, with Saint John&#x27;s quarantine station on Partridge Island being the second-busiest in British North America during the epidemic typhus outbreak.

The first premier of Newfoundland, Joey Smallwood, coined the term &quot;Atlantic Canada&quot; when the Dominion of Newfoundland joined Canada in 1949. He believed that it would have been presumptuous for Newfoundland to assume that it could include itself within the existing term &quot;Maritime provinces,&quot; which was used to describe the cultural similarities shared by New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Nova Scotia. The other provinces of Atlantic Canada entered Confederation during the 19th century with New Brunswick and Nova Scotia being founding members of the Dominion of Canada in 1867, and later Prince Edward Island joined in 1873.

==Geography==

Atlantic Canada is characterized by its rugged coastlines, gravel beaches, rugged mountains, and dense forests. Bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east and south, and Quebec to the west. The region shares two international borders one with the United States and its State of Maine and another off the coast of Newfoundland with France and its overseas collectivity of Saint Pierre and Miquelon. The region&#x27;s maritime environment has profoundly influenced the region&#x27;s climate, culture, and economy. The area encompasses a mix of urban centers like Halifax and St. John&#x27;s and rural communities that rely on fishing, and tourism.

Although Quebec has a physical Atlantic coast on the Gulf of St. Lawrence, it is generally not considered an Atlantic Province; instead, it is classified as part of Central Canada, along with Ontario.

Atlantic and Central Canada together are also known as Eastern Canada. Atlantic Canada includes a section of the Appalachian Mountains known as the Appalachian Uplands. In each Atlantic province, Upland regions have been divided into three highland areas. The mountain range results in coastal regions being fjorded. Some areas contain glaciofluvial deposits.

== Economy ==
Atlantic Canada&#x27;s primary industries are natural resource extraction and power generation including fishing, hydroelectricity, wind power, forestry, oil, and mining.

The Atlantic provinces contribute a significant part of Canada&#x27;s fish production, with many coastal communities primarily dependent on fisheries. Over half of all ocean related jobs in Canada are found in Atlantic Canada with 75% of the ocean economy centered in its provinces. The access point for many of such fisheries being the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the Atlantic continental shelf. Due to the collapse of the Atlantic northwest cod fishery Canada imposed a moratorium of cod fishing in 1992. This affected the region significantly and caused the loss of between 30,000 and 50,000 jobs in the region which was the largest single layoff in Canadian history.

Additionally the region is host to parts of Canada&#x27;s eastern boreal forests which were historically used for timber production and boat production.

Labrador hosts the second largest hydroelectric system in Canada at Churchill Falls where it produces 35,000 GWh of power each year. Elsewhere in the region wind power and hydrogen generation have begun to make a large impact on the energy landscape including exporting energy to Canada and hydrogen overseas.

The Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency is the official agency responsible for creating economic opportunities within Atlantic Canada.

Nova Scotia has historically been an exporter of gypsum and now produces over 60% of the gypsum in Canada. Salt and iron is also mined in the Atlantic provinces.

<text>The smooth newt, European newt, northern smooth newt or common newt (Lissotriton vulgaris) is a species of newt. It is widespread in Europe and parts of Asia, and has been introduced into Australia. Individuals are brown with a spotted underside that ranges in colour from orange to white. They reach an average length of ; males are larger than females. The newts&#x27; skins are dry and velvety when they are living on land, but become smooth when they migrate into the water to breed. Males develop a more vivid colour pattern and a conspicuous skin seam (crest) on their back when breeding.

The smooth newt was originally described by Carl Linnaeus as a lizard, and was then given different genus names before the adoption of its current classification as a member of &quot;Lissotriton&quot;. There are currently three accepted subspecies of smooth newt. Formerly, there were also four subspecies—all with more restricted ranges—that are now classified as separate species, because they have been found to be distinct genetically as well as in appearance: the Caucasian smooth newt, the Greek smooth newt, Kosswig&#x27;s smooth newt and Schmidtler&#x27;s smooth newt. Together with these four species and the Carpathian newt, the smooth newt forms what is known as a species complex: some of the species hybridise with each other.

For most of the year, smooth newts live on land, are mostly nocturnal, and hide during the day. They can adapt to a wide range of natural or semi-natural habitats, from forests at field edges to parks and gardens. They feed mainly on invertebrates such as insects and earthworms and are themselves eaten mainly by fish, birds and snakes. Between spring and summer, they breed in ponds or similar bodies of water. Males court females with a ritualised underwater display. Females lay their eggs on water plants, and larvae hatch after 10 to 20 days. The larvae develop for around three months before metamorphosing into terrestrial juveniles, at which point they become known as efts. They reach maturity after two to three years, and the adults live for up to 14 years.

The smooth newt is abundant over much of its range and is classified as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It has been negatively affected by habitat destruction and fragmentation and by the introduction of new species of fish. Like other European amphibians, the smooth newt has now been listed as a protected species by the Berne Convention.

==Taxonomy==

Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus described the smooth newt in 1758 as &quot;Lacerta vulgaris&quot;, placing it in the same genus as the green lizards. It was later re-described under several different species and genus names, including &quot;Triton&quot;, &quot;Molge&quot;, &quot;Salamandra&quot; and &quot;Lissotriton&quot;, with in total 48 species synonyms published. Most recently, it was included in the genus &quot;Triturus&quot;, along with most European newts. This genus was found to be polyphyletic, containing several unrelated lineages, and the small-bodied newts, including the smooth newt, were therefore split off as separate genus in 2004 by García-París and colleagues. They used the name &quot;Lissotriton&quot;, introduced by the English zoologist Thomas Bell in 1839 with the smooth newt as type species but then considered a synonym of &quot;Triturus&quot;. &quot;Lissotriton&quot; is a combination of the Greek (), meaning &quot;smooth&quot;, and the name of Triton, an ancient Greek god of the sea, while the species epithet means &quot;common&quot; in Latin.

Three subspecies are accepted by Pabijan, Wielstra and colleagues: &quot;L. v. vulgaris&quot;, &quot;L. v. ampelensis&quot; and &quot;L. v. meridionalis&quot;. These authors, followed by &quot;Amphibian Species of the World&quot;, recognise four former subspecies from southern Europe and west Asia as separate species, as they are morphologically and genetically distinct: the Greek smooth newt (&quot;L. graecus&quot;), Kosswig&#x27;s smooth newt (&quot;L. kosswigi&quot;), the Caucasian smooth newt (&quot;L. lantzi&quot;) and Schmidtler&#x27;s smooth newt (&quot;L. schmidtleri&quot;). The five smooth newt species and the Carpathian newt (&quot;L. montadoni&quot;), which is their sister species, have collectively been referred to as the &quot;smooth newt species complex&quot;.

To distinguish the smooth newt from its close relatives, the English name &quot;northern smooth newt&quot; has been suggested. Other common names that have been used in the literature include: common newt, great water-newt, common water-newt, warty eft, water eft, common smooth newt, small newt, small eft, small evet, and brown eft.

==Evolution==

Molecular phylogenetic analyses have shown that the smooth newt is distinct from its four close relatives&quot; &quot;– the Caucasian, Greek, Kosswig&#x27;s, and Schmidtler&#x27;s smooth newt – which were formerly considered subspecies (see section &quot;Taxonomy&quot; above). The relationships within this species complex have not been fully resolved. Within the smooth newt itself, genetic groups do not completely match the currently accepted subspecies (&quot;ampelensis&quot;, &quot;meridionalis&quot;, &quot;vulgaris&quot;), described based on morphology. The five smooth newt species collectively were estimated to have diverged from the Carpathian newt around four to six million years ago.

Genetic analyses have also demonstrated ongoing gene flow between the smooth newt and its relatives. Although the Carpathian newt is morphologically clearly different, hybridisation between the two species is frequent; it has been shown that smooth newt mitochondrial DNA has introgressed into and completely replaced that of the Carpathian newt populations. Partial introgression also occurred from the smooth newt to the Greek smooth newt. These patterns are likely due to the range expansion and secondary contact of species after the Last Glacial Maximum, which they likely survived in refugia mainly in southern and eastern Europe. The palmate newt (&quot;Lissotriton helveticus&quot;), although often occurring in the same habitats, almost never hybridises with the smooth newt. Artificial crosses with even more distant species such as the alpine (&quot;Ichthyosaura alpestris&quot;) and northern crested (&quot;Triturus cristatus&quot;) newts were successful in laboratory experiments.

==Description==


===General characteristics===

Adult males of the smooth newt reach around head-to-tail length and are thus slightly larger than the females, which reach . The body weight of adults varies between , and decreases during the breeding season. The head is longer than it is wide, with 2–3 longitudinal grooves on the top, and the elongated snout is blunt in the male and rounded in the female. The skin is velvety and water-repellent on land but smooth during the aquatic phase; it contains mucus and toxin glands and its upper layer is shed off regularly.

Outside the breeding season, both sexes are yellow-brown, brown or olive-brown. The male has dark, round spots, while the female has smaller spots of the same colour, which sometimes form two or more irregular lines along the back. The male has an orange strip on the tail underside, and the throat and belly in males are orange to white with small dark, rounded spots (these are lighter with smaller spots in the female). Size and colour vary with the environment, and the newts tend to be smaller in northern latitudes. Albinistic and leucistic individuals have been described.

The smooth newt is diploid (i.e. it has two copies of each chromosome), with 24 chromosomes in total.

===Breeding characteristics===

During the aquatic breeding season, males develop a skin seam or crest, which runs uninterrupted along the back and the tail. It is high at mid-body, but higher along the tail. The tail also has a lower fin, and its end is pointed. The cloaca (the single digestive, urinary and reproductive orifice) of breeding males is swollen, round and dark-coloured. The hindfeet have more or less developed toe flaps, depending on the subspecies. Colours in general are more vivid than during the land phase. The dark spots grow larger, and the crest often has vertical dark and bright bands. There are five to seven longitudinal stripes on the head. The lower edge of the tail is red with a silver-blue flash and black spots. Females only develop low, straight tail fins but no crest or toe flaps, and are more drably coloured.

Subspecies differ slightly in male secondary characteristics: &quot;L. v. ampelensis&quot; has strongly developed toe flaps, its tail tapers into a fine thread (but not a distinct filament), and the body is slightly square in cross-section. &quot;L. v. meridionalis&quot; also has toe flaps and a pointed tail, its crest is smooth-edged, and its body is square-shaped. In the nominate subspecies, &quot;L. v. vulgaris&quot;, the crest is clearly , toe flaps are only weakly developed and the body is round.

===Larvae===

The aquatic larvae are long and yellow-brown with two longitudinal stripes at hatching. They initially have, in addition to their gills, only two balancers at the sides of the head, short appendages for attaching to plants which get within a few days. As in all salamanders, forelegs develop before the hindlegs. The colour becomes a more cryptic, darkly marbled yellow to brown in the growing larvae. Larvae are very slender and similar to the palmate newt. They develop a skin seam from the neck to the pointed tail; the tail is as long as the head and trunk. The larvae grow to , which is also the size of the efts (terrestrial juveniles) just after metamorphosis.

===Similar species===

The smooth newt resembles the other, less widespread &quot;Lissotriton&quot; species. It can be confused especially with the closely related &quot;smooth newt complex&quot; species (marked with * in the table below) and the more distant palmate newt, which often occurs in the same area. Females are especially difficult to tell apart, as distinguishing features are mainly observed in the males at breeding season.

==Distribution==

===Native range===

The smooth newt has been described as &quot;the most ubiquitous and widely distributed newt of the Old World&quot;. The nominate subspecies, &quot;L. v. vulgaris&quot;, is most widespread and ranges natively from Ireland (where the smooth newt is the only newt species) and Great Britain in the west to Siberia and northern Kazakhstan in the east. In the north it reaches central Fennoscandia, and its southern limit is central France, northern Italy, the central Balkans and the dry Eurasian steppe of Ukraine and Russia. The subspecies &quot;L. v. ampelensis&quot; only occurs in the Carpathians of Ukraine and the Danube delta of northern Romania, and &quot;L. v. meridionalis&quot; in the northern half of Italy, southern Switzerland, Slovenia and Croatia.

In the Carpathians, the smooth newt generally prefers lower elevations than the Carpathian newt. In the Balkans, the precise contact zones with the Greek smooth newt and Schmidtler&#x27;s smooth newt are not yet clear. In central Italy, where the range of the smooth newt subspecies &quot;L. v. meridionalis&quot; overlaps with that of the Italian newt (&quot;L. italicus&quot;), it was found that the latter prefers a warmer and drier climate.

===Introduced range===

The nominate subspecies, &quot;L. v. vulgaris&quot;, has been introduced to Australia, which has no native salamander species. The smooth newt was available in the Australian pet trade until 1997, when it was declared a &quot;controlled pest animal&quot; because of the risk of introduction. The first record in the wild was made near Melbourne in 2011, and larvae were later found, indicating successful reproduction. Negative impacts on the native fauna are feared, including predation on and competition with native frogs and freshwater invertebrates, toxicity, and disease spread. The smooth newt could spread further in south-eastern Australia, where wide areas have a suitable climate.

Within Europe, the subspecies &quot;L. v. meridionalis&quot; was introduced north of the Alps near Geneva, where it hybridises with the native &quot;L. v. vulgaris&quot;.

==Habitat and ecology==

Mainly a lowland species, the smooth newt is only exceptionally found above . This species shows a wide habitat breadth, as it&#x27;s able to thrive in a wide array of terrestrial and aquatic environments. On land, it occurs in wooded areas (dense conifer woods are avoided) but also in more open areas such as damp meadows, field edges, parks and gardens. It can also tolerate human disturbance and urban environments. The newts hide under structures such as logs or stones or in small mammal burrows. Smooth newts may also climb vegetation, although the exact function of this is not currently known.

Freshwater breeding sites are typically sun-exposed, free from fish, stagnant, water-filled permanently or for at least three months of the year, close to similar water bodies, and have shallow areas with abundant water plants. They can range from small puddles to larger ponds or shallow parts of lakes. Water quality is less important; pH values from 4 (more acidic) to 9.6 (more alkaline) are tolerated and in Germany, smooth newts have even been found in slightly brackish water. They often share breeding sites with other amphibians, including other newts; in northern France, ponds with five newt species – smooth, palmate, alpine, northern crested and marbled (&quot;T. marmoratus&quot;) newt – have been described.

==Lifecycle and behaviour==

Smooth newts live on land during most of the year and are mainly nocturnal. They also usually hibernate on land, often in congregations of several newts in winter shelters such as under logs or in burrows (but they can be active during mild weather). The efts turn into mature adults at two to three years, and the newts can reach an age of 6–14 years in the wild. The newts recognise familiar territory using smell and visual cues, but could not orient themselves in experiments when they were transported far away from the home range.

===Reproduction===

Migration to the breeding sites occurs as soon as February, but in the northern parts of the range and at higher altitudes, it may not start before summer. After entering the water, the breeding characters, especially the male&#x27;s crest, take a few weeks to develop.

Mating involves an intricate courtship display: the male attempts to attract a female by swimming in front of her and sniffing her cloaca. He then vibrates his tail against his body, sometimes violently lashing it, thereby fanning pheromones towards her. In the final phase, he moves away from her, the tail quivering. If she is still interested, she will follow him and touch his cloaca with her snout, whereupon he deposits a packet of sperm (a spermatophore). He then guides her over the spermatophore so she picks it up with her cloaca. Males often try to lead females away from displaying competitors.

Eggs are fertilised internally, and progeny of one female usually has multiple fathers. Females tend to mate preferentially with unrelated males, probably to avoid inbreeding depression.

Females lay 100–500 eggs, usually folding them into waterplants. The eggs are in diameter ( with jelly capsule) and light brown to greenish or grey in colour. Larvae typically hatch after 10–20 days, depending on temperature, and metamorphose into terrestrial efts after around three months.

Paedomorphism, where adults stay aquatic and retain their gills and skin seams or only resorb them partially, occurs regularly but only in a small proportion of individuals. It does not appear to be determined genetically but favoured by cold water, a low density of individuals and abundant aquatic prey. Wild paedomorphic individuals often metamorphosed when they were transferred into an aquarium.

===Diet, predators and parasites===

Smooth newts, including the larvae, are unselective carnivores, feeding mainly on diverse invertebrates such as earthworms, snails, slugs, bivalves, spiders, ticks, mites, springtails or insects and insect larvae, or smaller plankton. Cannibalism also occurs, mainly by preying on eggs of its own species. Various predators eat smooth newts, including waterbirds, snakes and frogs, but also larger newts such as the northern crested newt.

Various pathogens and parasites have been found to infect smooth newts, including ranaviruses, a picornavirus, various protozoans, trematodes (of which &quot;Parastrigea robusta&quot; was found to cause the local decline of a population in Germany) and at least 31 species of helminths.

==Threats and conservation==

The smooth newt is common over much of its range. The IUCN, in 2008, assessed its threat status as Least Concern and found no general decline in populations. This assessment included subspecies now recognised as separate species (see section &quot;Taxonomy&quot; above) and needs updating. Despite the overall low concern, the smooth newt is listed in some national red lists, e.g. in Switzerland, the Czech Republic, and the Netherlands. Like all amphibians, it is also listed as protected species in the Berne Convention (Appendix III). Disturbance, capture, killing and trade are prohibited in Ireland under the Wildlife Act 1976, and trade in the UK under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.

Threats to smooth newts are similar to those affecting other amphibians. They include especially the loss of breeding ponds through destruction or introduction of fish, and the fragmentation of population through roads. Secondary habitats can help sustain the species, e.g. former gravel pits or quarries left open. The value of artificial water bodies as habitat can be improved when nearby hiding structures like stones or wood are added on land. Garden ponds are readily colonised if they are sun-exposed, have abundant water plants, no fish, and nearby hiding structures. Artificial hibernation sites (&quot;newt hotels&quot;) were readily used in a study in Norway, especially by juveniles.

To mark and track individuals and monitor populations, researchers have often amputated phalanges of fingers and toes but these re-grow quickly; a safer and less harmful alternative is recording the individual belly patterns through photography. Researchers have also developed genetic methods based on microsatellite distribution to assess patterns of genetic diversity.

==Captivity==

Smooth newts can be kept in captivity, but must come from a legal source under the applicable legislation given their protected status (see above). They need a land and water phase, with hibernation for two to three months at . The juveniles remain terrestrial and will only return to water at maturity. Individuals have reached ages of 4–8, exceptionally up to 20 years, in captivity.

<text>The palmate newt (Lissotriton helveticus) is a species of newt found in Western Europe, from Great Britain to the northern Iberian Peninsula. It is long and olive or brown with some dark spots. The underside is yellow to orange, and the throat, unlike in the similar smooth newt, always unspotted. A dark stripe runs along the head and through the eyes. Breeding males develop a distinct filament on the end of their tail, strongly webbed hind feet, and a low, smooth crest on their back.

Habitats include forests, marshes, pastures or gardens. While on land, the newts are mainly nocturnal. After emerging from hibernation in spring, they move to stagnant, fish-free water bodies for breeding. After a courtship display, the male deposits a spermatophore that is picked up by the female. Larvae develop over after 1.5–3.5 months before metamorphosing into land-dwelling juveniles (efts). Sexual maturity is reached after two to three years, and the newts can reach a total age of up to 12 years in the wild. The species is overall common and has been assessed as Least Concern by the IUCN.

==Taxonomy==

The palmate newt was first described scientifically in 1789, by Russian naturalist Grigory Razumovsky. He placed it in the genus of the green lizards and named it &quot;Lacerta helvetica&quot;, with &quot;&quot; referring to the Swiss type locality in the canton of Vaud. He also gave &quot;Lacerta paradoxa&quot; as alternative name, which is today regarded as a junior synonym. Several names published over time, in different genera, are also now treated as synonyms for the palmate newt. Most recently, the species was included in the genus &quot;Triturus&quot;, along with most European newts. This genus however was found to be polyphyletic, containing several unrelated lineages, and the small-bodied newts, including the palmate newt, were therefore split off as separate genus in 2004 by García-París and colleagues. They used the genus name &quot;Lissotriton&quot;, introduced by the English zoologist Thomas Bell in 1839. Two distinct subspecies, &quot;L. h. alonsoi&quot; and &quot;L. h. punctillatus&quot;, were described from the Iberian peninsula, but have not been retained by Raffaëlli and Sparreboom.

==Description==



Palmate newts grow to about total length in males, while females are somewhat larger and can reach . The tail is slightly shorter than the snout–vent distance. The head is longer than wide, with three longitudinal grooves on the snout. Both sexes have an olive or brown base colour, and males and some females have dark spotting on their backs. In females, the spots can sometimes form two irregular lines, and they can have a red stripe running along the back while living on land. In both sexes, a dark stripe runs along the head through the eyes. The underside is yellow or light orange and more whitish on the sides; the belly can have some dark spots, while the throat is always unspotted. While the newts live on land, the skin is dry and velvety, but it becomes smooth when they migrate into water.

Males can be distinguished from females by the larger and darker-coloured cloaca. During the aquatic breeding season, the cloaca swells, and other sexual differences develop: Males grow a low, smooth skin seam (a crest) on their back, which is higher on the tail. Their tail has a blunt end with a distinct, 4–7 mm long filament. They also have ridges (dorso-lateral ridges) running along their sides, giving them an angular, square shape in cross-section, and their hind feet have well-developed, dark webbing. The lower half of the tail is blue in breeding males and orange in females. Development of the crest, tail filament, ridges, and webbing can be suppressed in the presence of the newts&#x27; natural predators. When exposed to predatory goldfish, newts do not express these traits, as large sexual ornaments would make them more conspicuous prey. Females do not develop a crest, tail filament or webbed feet.

Sometimes confused with the smooth newt (&quot;Lissotriton vulgaris&quot;) which is found in much of the same area, the palmate newt can be distinguished by its unspotted throat. It also resembles Boscá&#x27;s newt (&quot;L. boscai&quot;) from the Iberian peninsula, which has only a single groove on the snout and no dark eye strip.

==Distribution and habitats==

The palmate newt occurs in Western Europe, from Great Britain (up to Scotland) to northern Portugal and Spain. In the east, it ranges to the Elbe river in Germany and the Czech Republic and the lower and mid Alps in Switzerland. It is most common from elevation, but can be found from sea level up to (in the Pyrenees). Genetic analyses by Recuero and García-París suggest that the species was confined to the Iberian Peninsula during the Last Glacial Maximum and then expanded its range north of the Pyrenees.

They have recently been discovered in South Western Ireland, though it is unclear yet whether they are native or an introduced species.

Common over most of its range, the palmate newt is found in a variety of habitats, including forest, marshes and pasture. It is less abundant in cultivated areas, but can adapt to gardens. For reproduction, the newts accept different types of stagnant water bodies, preferably fish-free; acidic ponds are well tolerated. The smooth newt occurs over much of the same area, but in France appears to prefer ponds in open land, while the palmate newt prefers forest ponds; hybrids between the two species are rare.

==Lifecycle and reproduction==

The reproductive period usually extends from February to May, but can start earlier or last longer in the southern range on the Iberian Peninsula, depending on elevation. The newts can use magnetoreception over larger distances and the calls of frogs over shorter distances to find their breeding ponds. Once in the water, they are active during day and night. Breeding involves a ritualised courtship display as in other closely related newts: The male attempts to attract a female by swimming in front of her and sniffing her cloaca. He then vibrates his tail against his body, sometimes lashing it (but less violently than in the smooth newt), thereby fanning pheromones towards her. In the final phase, its a packet of sperm (a spermatophore). He then guides her over the spermatophore so she picks it up with her cloaca.

The females lays 150–440 eggs individually on water plants. These are 1.3–1.8 mm in diameter (2.2–3 mm with capsule) and very similar to those of the smooth newt. Larvae hatch after 8–21 days, depending on temperature, at a size of 8–14 mm. The young larvae are yellow–brown, with two black stripes, and have two appendages (balancers) on the sides of the head, which are later resorbed. The colour then becomes more cryptic, and the larvae grow to . As they grow, their characteristics are affected by their environment. Specifically, in response to chemical cues from predatory dragonfly larvae, larval newts develop larger heads and tails, and develop darker tail pigmentation. Additionally, dragonflies were more likely to prey on newts without such changes, which may be because a larger tail size facilitates newt predator escape behavior. They metamorphose into land-dwelling juveniles (efts) after 1.5–3.5 months, but some larvae instead overwinter in water. Paedomorphism, where adults keep their gills and stay aquatic, is also known.

The young efts live on land until maturity, which is reached in the second or third year. Activity on land occurs mainly during humid nights. The palmate newt usually hibernates on land but sometimes in the water, and in the Iberian peninsula, it is often active year-round. Larvae, efts and adults mainly feed on various invertebrates, but cannibalism also occurs, mainly by larvae preying on eggs. An age of up to 12 years can be reached in the wild.

==Threats and conservation==

Palmate newt populations are not in decline overall, and the species has been assessed as Least Concern by the IUCN. In France, it is the most common newt species, but it is rare in Belgium and the Netherlands, and populations are fragmented on the Iberian peninsula. It is included in some national and regional red lists. Drainage and pollution of breeding sites, the introduction of fish and crayfish, as well as desertification (in the southern range), have been cited as threats. Like all amphibians, it is listed as protected species in the Berne Convention (Appendix III), and it is legally protected by law in the countries it occurs in.

<text>The red-eared slider or red-eared terrapin (Trachemys scripta elegans) is a subspecies of the pond slider (&quot;Trachemys scripta&quot;), a semiaquatic turtle belonging to the family Emydidae. It is the most popular pet turtle in the United States, is also popular as a pet across the rest of the world, and is the most invasive turtle. It is the most commonly traded turtle in the world.

The red-eared slider is native from the Midwestern United States to northern Mexico, but has become established in other places because of pet releases, and has become invasive in many areas where it outcompetes native species. The red-eared slider is included in the list of the world&#x27;s 100 most invasive species.

== Etymology ==

The red-eared slider gets its name from the small, red stripe around its ears, or where its ears would be, and from its ability to slide quickly off rocks and logs into the water. This species was previously known as Troost&#x27;s turtle in honor of an American herpetologist Gerard Troost. &quot;Trachemys scripta troostii&quot; is now the scientific name for another subspecies, the Cumberland slider.

== Taxonomy ==
The red-eared slider belongs to the order Testudines, which contains about 250 turtle species. It is a subspecies of &quot;Trachemys scripta&quot;. It was previously classified under the name &quot;Chrysemys scripta elegans&quot;. &quot;Trachemys scripta&quot; contains three subspecies: (red-eared slider), (yellow-bellied slider), and (Cumberland slider).

==Description==

The carapace of this species can reach more than in length, but the typical length ranges from . The females of the species are usually larger than the males. They typically live between 20–30 years, although some individuals can live for more than 40 years. Their life expectancy is shorter when they are kept in captivity. The quality of their living environment has a strong influence on their lifespans and well being.

The shell is divided into the upper or dorsal carapace, and the lower, ventral carapace or plastron. The upper carapace consists of the vertebral scutes, which form the central, elevated portion; pleural scutes that are located around the vertebral scutes; and then the marginal scutes around the edge of the carapace. The rear marginal scutes are notched. The scutes are bony keratinous elements. The carapace is oval and flattened (especially in the male) and has a weak keel that is more pronounced in the young. The color of the carapace changes depending on the age of the turtle. It usually has a dark green background with light and dark, highly variable markings. In young or recently hatched turtles, it is leaf green and gets slightly darker as a turtle gets older, until it is a very dark green, and then turns a shade between brown and olive green. The plastron is always a light yellow with dark, paired, irregular markings in the centre of most scutes. The plastron is highly variable in pattern. The head, legs, and tail are green with fine, irregular, yellow lines. The whole shell is covered in these stripes and markings that aid in camouflaging an individual.

These turtles also have a complete skeletal system, with partially webbed feet that help them to swim and that can be withdrawn inside the carapace along with the head and tail. The red stripe on each side of the head distinguishes the red-eared slider from all other North American species and gives this species its name, as the stripe is located behind the eyes, where their (external) ears would be. These stripes may lose their color over time. Color and vibrance of ear stripe can indicate immune health, with bright red having higher immune response than yellow stripes. Some individuals can also have a small mark of the same color on the top of their heads. The red-eared slider does not have a visible outer ear or an external auditory canal; instead, it relies on a middle ear entirely covered by a cartilaginous tympanic disc.

Like other turtles, the species is poikilotherm and thus dependent on the temperature of its environment. For this reason, it needs to sunbathe frequently to warm up and maintain body temperature.

=== Sexual dimorphism ===

Some dimorphism exists between males and females.

Red-eared slider young look practically identical regardless of their sex, making distinguishing them difficult. One useful method, however, is to inspect the markings under their carapace, which fade as the turtles age. Distinguishing the sex of adults is much easier, as the shells of mature males are smaller than those of females. Male red-eared sliders reach sexual maturity when their carapaces&#x27; diameters measure and females reach maturity when their carapaces measure about . Both males and females reach sexual maturity at 5–6 years old. Males are normally smaller than females, although this parameter is sometimes difficult to apply, as individuals being compared could be of different ages.

Males have longer claws on their front feet than the females; this helps them to hold onto a female during mating, and is used during courtship displays. The males&#x27; tails are thicker and longer. Typically, the cloacal opening of a female is at or under the rear edge of the carapace, while the male&#x27;s opening occurs beyond the edge of the carapace. The male&#x27;s plastron is slightly concave, while that of the female is completely flat. The male&#x27;s concave plastron also helps to stabilize the male on the female&#x27;s carapace during mating. Older males can sometimes have a dark greyish-olive green melanistic coloration, with very subdued markings. The red stripe on the sides of the head may be difficult to see or be absent. The female&#x27;s appearance is substantially the same throughout her life.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The red-eared slider originated from the area around the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico, in warm climates in the Southeastern United States. Their native areas range from the southeast of Colorado to Virginia and Florida. In nature, they inhabit areas with a source of still, warm water, such as ponds, lakes, swamps, creeks, streams, or slow-flowing rivers.

They live in areas of calm water, where they are able to leave the water easily by climbing onto rocks or tree trunks so they can warm up in the sun. Individuals are often found sunbathing in a group or even on top of each other. They also require abundant aquatic plants, as these are the adults&#x27; main food, although they are omnivores. Turtles in the wild always remain close to water unless they are searching for a new habitat or when females leave the water to lay their eggs.

=== Invasive species ===
Invasive red-eared sliders cause negative impacts in the ecosystems they are introduced to because they have certain advantages over the native populations, such as a lower age at maturity, higher fecundity rates, and larger body size, which gives them a competitive advantage at basking and nesting sites, as well as when exploiting food resources. They also transmit diseases and displace the other turtle species with which they compete for food and breeding space.

Owing to their popularity as pets, red-eared sliders have been released or escaped into the wild in many parts of the world. This turtle is considered one of the world&#x27;s worst invasive species. Feral populations are now found in Bermuda, Canada, Australia, Europe, Great Britain, South Africa, the Caribbean Islands, Israel, Bahrain, the Mariana Islands, Guam, Russia, and south- and far-east Asia. Within Great Britain, red-eared sliders have a wide distribution throughout England, Scotland, and Wales.

In Australia, it is illegal for members of the public to import, keep, trade, or release red-eared sliders, as they are regarded as an invasive species – see below. Their import has also been banned by the European Union as well as specific EU member countries. In 2015, Japan announced it was planning to ban the import of red-eared sliders, and officially established in June 2023. While this bans it and red swamp crayfish from importing, trading and releasing to wild, it is still able to keep it alive at home.

== Behavior ==
Red-eared sliders are almost entirely aquatic, but as they are cold-blooded, they leave the water to sunbathe to regulate their temperature.

=== Hibernation ===
Red-eared sliders do not hibernate, but actually brumate; while they become less active, they do occasionally rise to the surface for food or air. Brumation can occur to varying degrees. In the wild, red-eared sliders brumate over the winter at the bottoms of ponds or shallow lakes. They generally become inactive in October, when temperatures fall below . During this time, the turtles enter a state of sopor, during which they do not eat or defecate, they remain nearly motionless, and the frequency of their breathing falls. Individuals usually brumate under water, but they have also been found under banks and rocks, and in hollow stumps. In warmer winter climates, they can become active and come to the surface for basking. When the temperature begins to drop again, however, they quickly return to a brumation state. Sliders generally come up for food in early March to as late as the end of April.

During brumation, &quot;T. s. elegans&quot; can survive anaerobically for weeks, producing ATP from glycolysis. The turtle&#x27;s metabolic rate drops dramatically, with heart rate and cardiac output dropping by 80% to minimize energy requirements.
The lactic acid produced is buffered by minerals in the shell, preventing acidosis.
Red-eared sliders kept captive indoors should not brumate.

=== Reproduction ===

Courtship and mating activities for red-eared sliders usually occur between March and July, and take place under water. During courtship, the male swims around the female and flutters or vibrates the back side of his long claws on and around her face and head, possibly to direct pheromones towards her. The female swims toward the male, and if she is receptive, sinks to the bottom for mating. If the female is not receptive, she may become aggressive towards the male. Courtship can last 45 minutes, but mating takes only 10 minutes.

On occasion, a male may appear to be courting another male, and when kept in captivity may also show this behaviour towards other household pets. Between male turtles, it could be a sign of dominance and may preclude a fight. Young turtles may carry out the courtship dance before they reach sexual maturity at 5 years of age, but they are unable to mate.After mating, the female spends extra time basking to keep her eggs warm. She may also have a change of diet, eating only certain foods, or not eating as much as she normally would. A female can lay between two and 30 eggs depending on body size and other factors. One female can lay up to 5 clutches in the same year, and clutches are usually spaced 12–36 days apart. The time between mating and egg-laying can be days or weeks. The fertilization and laying can also be in conjunction, with eggs immediately laid based on location and nutrients available. The actual egg fertilization takes place during the egg-laying. This process also permits the laying of fertile eggs the following season, as the sperm can remain viable and available in the female&#x27;s body in the absence of mating. During the last weeks of gestation, the female spends less time in the water and smells and scratches at the ground, indicating she is searching for a suitable place to lay her eggs. The female excavates a hole, using her hind legs, and lays her eggs in it.

Incubation takes 59–112 days. Late-season hatchlings may spend the winter in the nest and emerge when the weather warms in the spring. Just prior to hatching, the egg contains 50% turtle and 50% egg sac. A new hatchling breaks open its egg with its egg tooth, which falls out about an hour after hatching. This egg tooth never grows back. Hatchlings may stay inside their eggshells after hatching for the first day or two. If they are forced to leave the eggshell before they are ready, they will return if possible. When a hatchling decides to leave the shell, it still has a small sac protruding from its plastron. The yolk sac is vital and provides nourishment while visible, and several days later, it will have been absorbed into the turtle&#x27;s belly. The sac must be absorbed, and does not fall off. The split must heal on its own before the turtle is able to swim. The time between the egg hatching and water entry is 21 days.

Damage to or inordinate motion of the protruding egg yolk – enough to allow air into the turtle&#x27;s body – results in death. This is the main reason for marking the top of turtle eggs if their relocation is required for any reason. An egg turned upside down will eventually terminate the embryo&#x27;s growth by the sac smothering the embryo. If it manages to reach term, the turtle will try to flip over with the yolk sac, which would allow air into the body cavity and cause death. The other fatal danger is water getting into the body cavity before the sac is absorbed completely, and while the opening has not completely healed yet.

The sex of red-eared sliders is determined by the incubation temperature during critical phases of the embryos&#x27; development. Only males are produced when eggs are incubated at temperatures of , whereas females develop at warmer temperatures. Colder temperatures result in the death of the embryos.

==As pets, invasive species, and human infection risk==

Red-eared slider turtles are the world&#x27;s most commonly traded reptile, due to their relatively low price, and usually low food price, small size, and easy maintenance. As with other turtles, tortoises, and box turtles, individuals that survive their first year or two can be expected to live generally around 30 years. They present an infection risk; particularly of &quot;Salmonella&quot;.

===Infection risks and United States federal regulations on commercial distribution===
Reptiles are asymptomatic (meaning they suffer no adverse side effects) carriers of bacteria of the genus &quot;Salmonella&quot;. This has given rise to justifiable concerns given the many instances of infection of humans caused by the handling of turtles, which has led to restrictions in the sale of red-eared sliders in the United States. A 1975 U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulation bans the sale (for general commercial and public use) of both turtle eggs and turtles with a carapace length less than . This regulation comes under the Public Health Service Act, and is enforced by the FDA in cooperation with state and local health jurisdictions. The ban was enacted because of the public-health impact of turtle-associated salmonellosis. Turtles and turtle eggs found to be offered for sale in violation of this provision are subject to destruction in accordance with FDA procedures. A fine up to $1,001 and / or imprisonment for up to one year is the penalty for those who refuse to comply with a valid final demand for destruction of such turtles or their eggs. Many stores and flea markets still sell small turtles due to an exception in the FDA regulation that allows turtles under to be sold &quot;for &quot;bona fide&quot; scientific, educational, or exhibition purposes, other than use as pets.&quot; As with many other animals and inanimate objects, the risk of &quot;Salmonella&quot; exposure can be reduced by following basic rules of cleanliness. Small children must be taught to wash their hands immediately after they finish playing with the turtle, feeding it, or changing its water.

===US state laws===
Some states have other laws and regulations regarding possession of red-eared sliders because they can be an invasive species where they are not native and have been introduced through the pet trade. It is illegal in Florida to sell any wild-type red-eared slider, as they interbreed with the local yellow-bellied slider population, which is another subspecies of pond sliders, and hybrids typically combine the markings of the two subspecies. However, unusual color varieties such as albino and pastel red-eared sliders, which are derived from captive breeding, are still allowed for sale.

===Invasive status in Australia===
In Australia, breeding populations have been found in New South Wales and Queensland, and individual turtles have been found in the wild in Victoria, the Australian Capital Territory, and Western Australia.

Red-eared slider turtles are considered a significant threat to native turtle species; they mature more quickly, grow larger, produce more offspring, and are more aggressive. Numerous studies indicate that red-eared slider turtles can out-compete native turtles for food and nesting and basking sites. Unlike the general diet of pet red-eared sliders, wild red-eared sliders are usually omnivorous. Because red-eared slider turtles eat plants as well as animals, they could also have a negative impact on a range of native aquatic species, including rare frogs. Also, a significant risk exists that red-eared slider turtles can transfer diseases and parasites to native reptile species. A malaria-like parasite was spread to two wild turtle populations in Lane Cove River, Sydney.

Social and economic costs are also likely to be substantial. The Queensland government has invested close to AU$1 million in eradication programs to date. The turtle may also cause significant public-health costs due to the impacts of turtle-associated salmonella on human health. Outbreaks in multiple states and fatalities in children, associated with handling &quot;Salmonella&quot;-infected turtles, have been recorded in the US. Salmonella can also spread to humans when turtles contaminate drinking water.

The actions by state governments have varied considerably to date, ranging from ongoing eradication efforts by the Queensland government to very little action by the government of New South Wales. Experts have ranked the species as high priority for management in Australia, and are calling for a national prevention and eradication strategy, including a concerted education and compliance program to stop the illegal trade, possession, and release of slider turtles.

=== Invasive status in India ===
Red-eared slider turtles are threatening to invade the natural water bodies across northeast India, which are home to 21 out of 29 vulnerable native Indian species of freshwater turtle. Between August 2018 and June 2019, a team of herpetologists from the NGO &quot;Help Earth&quot; found red-eared sliders in the Deepor Beel wildlife sanctuary and Ugratara Devalaya temple pond. Further reports have been made from an unnamed stream, feeding into the Tlawng river, on a farm in the Mizoram capital, Aizawl.

==In popular culture==
Within the second volume of the &quot;Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;, the popular comic-book heroes were revealed as specimens of the red-eared slider. The popularity of the Ninja Turtles, coupled with the release of the first live-action film, led to a craze for keeping them as pets in United Kingdom, with subsequent ecological havoc, as turtles were accidentally or deliberately released into the wild.

<text>Palm, Inc., was an American company that specialized in manufacturing personal digital assistants (PDAs) and developing software. Palm designed the PalmPilot, the first PDA successfully marketed worldwide, and was known for the Treo 600, one of the earlier successful smartphones. Palm developed the Palm OS software for PDAs and smartphones released under its line of Palm-branded devices and also licensed to other PDA manufacturers.

The company was also responsible for the first versions of webOS, the first multitasking operating system for smartphones, and enyo.js, a framework for HTML5 apps. In July 2010, Palm was purchased by Hewlett-Packard (HP), and in 2011 announced a new range of webOS products. However, after poor sales, HP CEO Léo Apotheker announced in August 2011 that it would end production and support of Palm and webOS devices, marking the end of the Palm brand after 19 years. In October 2014, HP sold the Palm trademark to a shelf corporation tied to the Chinese electronics firm TCL Corporation.

== History ==
Palm, headquartered in Sunnyvale, California, was responsible for numerous products including the Pre and Pixi as well as the Treo and Centro smartphones. Previous product lines include the Pilot 1000, Palm Pilot Pro, Palm III, Palm V, Palm VII, Zire and Tungsten. While their older devices run Palm OS Garnet, four editions of the Treo run Windows Mobile.

===Founding and acquisition ===
Palm Computing, Inc., was founded in 1992 by Jeff Hawkins, who later hired Donna Dubinsky and Ed Colligan, all of whom guided Palm to the invention of Palm Pilot. The company was started to write software for the Zoomer, a consumer PDA manufactured by Casio for Tandy. The Zoomer devices were also distributed by Casio and GRiD, while Palm provided the PIM software. The PEN/GEOS operating system was provided by Geoworks.

The Zoomer failed commercially, but Palm continued generating revenue by selling synchronization software for HP devices, and the Graffiti handwriting recognition software for the Apple Newton MessagePad.

The company was acquired by U.S. Robotics Corp. in 1995. In June 1997, U.S. Robotics was acquired by 3Com and Palm became a 3Com subsidiary. In June 1998, the founders became unhappy with the direction in which 3Com was taking the company, and left to found Handspring.

===Stock offering and split into PalmSource and PalmOne ===

3Com made the Palm subsidiary an independent, publicly traded company on 1 March 2000, and it traded on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol PALM. Palm Inc had its IPO during the dot-com bubble and in its first day of trading the shares of the new company hit an all-time high of US$95.06. But competition and the end of the tech bubble caused Palm&#x27;s shares to lose 90% of their value in just over a year. By June 2001 the company&#x27;s shares were trading at US$6.50, making it the worst performing PDA manufacturer on the NASDAQ index at the time.

In January 2002, Palm set up a wholly owned subsidiary to develop and license Palm OS, which was named PalmSource in February. PalmSource was then spun off from Palm as an independent company. In October 2003, the hardware division of the company merged with Handspring, was renamed to palmOne, Inc. and traded under the ticker symbol PLMO. The Palm trademark was held by a jointly owned holding company.

===United as a single company===
In May 2005, palmOne purchased PalmSource&#x27;s share in the &#x27;Palm&#x27; trademark for US$30 million. In July 2005, palmOne launched its new name and brand, reverting to Palm, Inc. and trading under the ticker symbol PALM once again.

In late 2005, ACCESS, which specializes in mobile and embedded web browser technologies, acquired PalmSource for US$324 million.

On 4 January 2006, Palm released the Palm Treo 700w, the first Windows Mobile-powered Treo, in a partnership with Verizon Wireless and Microsoft.

In December 2006, Palm, Inc. paid US$44 million to ACCESS for an irrevocable license to use and modify the source code for Palm OS Garnet as well as ship Palm OS Garnet in any Palm product without paying royalties; with this arrangement, the Palm company could once again develop both its hardware and software.

In June 2007, Palm formed a strategic relationship with the private-equity firm Elevation Partners, who purchased a 25% equity stake of the company for US$325 million – an investment that came after months of rumours about a possible Palm sale. Palm CEO Ed Colligan acknowledged that &quot;We were approached by larger parties over the last six months,&quot; and &quot;the reality is that we thought this was the best outcome for our business and our investors.&quot;

On 18 December 2008, Palm CEO Ed Colligan announced that the company would no longer develop any new handheld PDAs. Palm announced the webOS operating system and Palm Pre smartphone at the Consumer Electronics Show on 8 January 2009, and released on 6 June 2009 with Sprint. The design team was led by Matias Duarte, Mike Bell, Peter Skillman and Michael Abbott.

In early 2009, the hype over WebOS sent Palm&#x27;s stock from US$3 to a high of about US$18. While reviews of the Palm Pre were positive, launching with only one U.S. carrier (Sprint, which was also a distant third in the market) proved to be a crucial mistake that limited sales, even though it became Sprint&#x27;s phone. The Pre was often described as Palm&#x27;s swan song as it was too late to keep the company – with only $250 million in cash and short- term investments at the beginning of 2009 – independent for long. By 2010 the share price of Palm dropped to below US$4.

=== Acquisition by HP and demise ===

On 28 April 2010, Hewlett-Packard announced it would purchase Palm at $5.70 a share for $1.2 billion in an all-cash deal. The acquisition was completed on 1 July 2010.

The Palm global business unit was to be responsible for webOS software development and webOS-based hardware products, from a robust smartphone roadmap to future slate PCs and netbooks.

In February 2011, HP unveiled a new line of WebOS products, including the Pre 3, Veer, and TouchPad; however, these products were branded under HP&#x27;s name and not with the Palm name. In July 2011, as part of a reorganization, WebOS head Jon Rubinstein was demoted from senior vice president to a &quot;product innovation role&quot;, and replaced by Stephen DeWitt, head of HP&#x27;s North American consumer PC unit. At the same time, Palm was renamed the &quot;webOS global business unit&quot;, effectively ending the use of the Palm brand.

The launch of the TouchPad was met with extremely poor sales; on 18 August 2011, HP announced that it would immediately end the production and support of all Palm and WebOS devices, and would be &quot;exploring options to optimize the value of webOS software going forward&quot;, including a potential sale of the division to another company. HP also cancelled the U.S. release for the Pre 3 and Veer, and infamously, held a fire sale on remaining TouchPad stock, lowering prices for the tablet to as low as US$99 (which, however, led to a major spike in demand for the device). The decision, made by HP&#x27;s CEO at the time Léo Apotheker, along with its $11.7 billion acquisition of Autonomy, and threats to spin off HP&#x27;s consumer business, led to a major decline in HP&#x27;s market performance, with its shares falling in value by 45.4%.
Following the resignation of Apotheker and his replacement by Meg Whitman, it was announced in December 2011 that an open source version of much of WebOS would be created. Shortly afterward, Jon Rubinstein, along with a number of other senior Palm staff members, began to leave HP. On 15 August 2012, it was revealed that HP had re-organized the remaining WebOS team as a unit known as &quot;Gram&quot;, made up of the remaining components of Palm. In February 2013, HP announced that it had sold the WebOS team, along with a license to the WebOS source code, documentation, and underlying patents, to LG Electronics. LG planned to primarily use the WebOS platform for its smart TV products, rather than on mobile devices, but did not rule out the possibility.

=== TCL ownership, new device ===
On 30 December 2014, it was reported that in October 2014, HP had sold the Palm trademark and related intellectual properties to Wide Progress Global Limited, a shelf company controlled by Nicolas Zibell — a regional president of TCL Corporation, which markets Android smartphones under the Alcatel brand. At the same time, it was discovered that the former Palm.com now redirected to MyNewPalm.com; the site displayed a &quot;coming soon&quot; page with the previous orange Palm logo, and the slogan &quot;Smart move&quot;, which is also the slogan used by Alcatel OneTouch.

TCL publicly confirmed its acquisition of the Palm brand on 6 January 2015, stating that it planned to &quot;re-create&quot; the company with a new team based in Silicon Valley, and incorporate crowdsourcing into its product development.

On 15 October 2018, a new Palm companion device was unveiled, which is manufactured by a new Palm-branded startup company from California that is financially backed by TCL and basketball player Stephen Curry. It is an &quot;ultra-mobile&quot;, Android-based device designed to serve as a smaller, simplified companion to a larger smartphone. The new device was announced as being exclusive to Verizon Wireless, only available as an add-on to an existing or new device plan.

<doc id="71119" wikidata="Q901057" url="?curid=71119" title="Wigner's friend">
<text>Wigner&#x27;s friend is a thought experiment in theoretical quantum physics, first published by the Hungarian-American physicist Eugene Wigner in 1961, and further developed by David Deutsch in 1985. The scenario involves an indirect observation of a quantum measurement: An observer formula_1 observes another observer formula_2 who performs a quantum measurement on a physical system. The two observers then formulate a statement about the physical system&#x27;s state after the measurement according to the laws of quantum theory. In the Copenhagen interpretation, the resulting statements of the two observers contradict each other. This reflects a seeming incompatibility of two laws in the Copenhagen interpretation: the deterministic and continuous time evolution of the state of a closed system and the nondeterministic, discontinuous collapse of the state of a system upon measurement. Wigner&#x27;s friend is therefore directly linked to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics with its famous Schrödinger&#x27;s cat paradox.

Generalizations and extensions of Wigner&#x27;s friend have been proposed. Two such scenarios involving multiple friends have been implemented in a laboratory, using photons to stand in for the friends.

==Original paradox==
Wigner introduced the thought experiment in a 1961 article &quot;Remarks on the Mind-Body Question&quot;. He begins by noting that most physicists in the then-recent past had been thoroughgoing materialists who would insist that &quot;mind&quot; or &quot;soul&quot; are illusory, and that nature is fundamentally deterministic. He argues that quantum physics has changed this situation:
: All that quantum mechanics purports to provide are probability connections between subsequent impressions (also called &quot;apperceptions&quot;) of the consciousness, and even though the dividing line between the observer, whose consciousness is being affected, and the observed physical object can be shifted towards the one or the other to a considerable degree, it cannot be eliminated.

===Nature of the wave function===
Going into more detail, Wigner says:
: Given any object, all the possible knowledge concerning that object can be given as its wave function. This is a mathematical concept the exact nature of which need not concern us here—it is composed of a (countable) infinity of numbers. If one knows these numbers, one can foresee the behavior of the object as far as it can be foreseen. More precisely, the wave function permits one to foretell with what probabilities the object will make one or another impression on us if we let it interact with us either directly, or indirectly. [...] In fact, the wave function is only a suitable language for describing the body of knowledge—gained by observations—which is relevant for predicting the future behaviour of the system. For this reason, the interactions which may create one or another sensation in us are also called observations, or measurements. One realises that &quot;all&quot; the information which the laws of physics provide consists of probability connections between subsequent impressions that a system makes on one if one interacts with it repeatedly, i.e., if one makes repeated measurements on it. The wave function is a convenient summary of that part of the past impressions which remains relevant for the probabilities of receiving the different possible impressions when interacting with the system at later times.

The wave function of an object &quot;exists&quot; (Wigner&#x27;s quotation marks) because observers can share it:
: The information given by the wave function is communicable. If someone else somehow determines the wave function of a system, he can tell me about it and, according to the theory, the probabilities for the possible different impressions (or &quot;sensations&quot;) will be equally large, no matter whether he or I interact with the system in a given fashion.

Observing a system causes its wave functions to change indeterministically, because &quot;the entering of an impression into our consciousness&quot; implies a revision of &quot;the probabilities for different impressions which we expect to receive in the future&quot;.

===The observer observed===
Wigner presents two arguments for the thesis that the mind influences the body, i.e., that a human body can &quot;deviate from the laws of physics&quot; as deduced from experimenting upon inanimate objects. The argument that he personally finds less persuasive is the one that has become known as &quot;Wigner&#x27;s friend&quot;. In this thought experiment, Wigner posits that his friend is in a laboratory, and Wigner lets the friend perform a quantum measurement on a physical system (this could be a spin system). This system is assumed to be in a superposition of two distinct states, say, state 0 and state 1 (or formula_3 and formula_4 in Dirac notation). When Wigner&#x27;s friend measures the system in the {0,1}-basis, according to quantum mechanics, they will get one of the two possible outcomes (0 or 1) and the system will collapse into the corresponding state.

Now Wigner himself models the scenario from outside the laboratory, knowing that inside, his friend will at some point perform the 0/1-measurement on the physical system. According to the linearity of the quantum mechanical equations, Wigner will assign a superposition state to the whole laboratory (i.e. the joint system of the physical system together with the friend): The superposition state of the lab is then a linear combination of &quot;system is in state 0 — friend has measured 0&quot; and &quot;system is in state 1 — friend has measured 1&quot;.

Let Wigner now ask his friend for the result of the measurement. Whichever answer the friend gives (0 or 1), Wigner would then assign the state &quot;system is in state 0 — friend has measured 0&quot; or &quot;system is in state 1 — friend has measured 1&quot; to the laboratory. Therefore, it is only at the time when he learns about his friend&#x27;s result that the superposition state of the laboratory collapses.

However, unless Wigner is considered in a &quot;privileged position as ultimate observer&quot;, the friend&#x27;s point of view must be regarded as equally valid, and this is where an apparent paradox comes into play: From the point of view of the friend, the measurement result was determined long before Wigner had asked about it, and the state of the physical system has already collapsed. When exactly did the collapse occur? Was it when the friend had finished their measurement, or when the information of its result entered Wigner&#x27;s consciousness? As Wigner says, he could ask his friend, &quot;What did you feel about the [measurement result] before I asked you?&quot; The question of what result the friend has seen is surely &quot;already decided in his mind&quot;, Wigner writes, which implies that the friend–system joint state must already be one of the collapsed options, not a superposition of them. Wigner concludes that the linear time evolution of quantum states according to the Schrödinger equation cannot apply when the physical entity involved is a conscious being.

Wigner presents his second argument, which he finds more persuasive, much more briefly:
: The second argument to support the existence of an influence of the consciousness on the physical world is based on the observation that we do not know of any phenomenon in which one subject is influenced by another without exerting an influence thereupon. This appears convincing to this writer.

===As a &quot;reductio ad absurdum&quot;===
According to physicist Leslie Ballentine, by 1987 Wigner had decided that consciousness does not cause a physical collapse of the wavefunction, although he still believed that his chain of inferences leading up to that conclusion were correct. As Ballentine recounts, Wigner regarded his 1961 argument as a , indicating that the postulates of quantum mechanics need to be revised in some way.

==Responses in different interpretations of quantum mechanics==
===Many-worlds interpretations===
The various versions of the many worlds interpretation avoid the need to postulate that consciousness causes collapse – indeed, that collapse occurs at all.

Hugh Everett III&#x27;s doctoral thesis Relative state&#x27; formulation of quantum mechanics&quot; serves as the foundation for today&#x27;s many versions of many-worlds interpretations. In the introductory part of his work, Everett discusses the &quot;amusing, but &quot;extremely hypothetical&quot; drama&quot; of the Wigner&#x27;s friend paradox. Note that there is evidence of a drawing of the scenario in an early draft of Everett&#x27;s thesis. It was therefore Everett who provided the first written discussion of the problem four or five years before it was discussed in &quot;Remarks on the mind-body question&quot; by Wigner, of whom it received the name and fame thereafter. However, Everett being a student of Wigner&#x27;s, it is clear that they must have discussed it together at some point.

In contrast to his teacher Wigner, who held the consciousness of an observer to be responsible for a collapse, Everett understands the Wigner&#x27;s friend scenario in a different way: Insisting that quantum states&#x27; assignments should be objective and nonperspectival, Everett derives a straightforward logical contradiction when letting formula_2 and formula_1 reason about the laboratory&#x27;s state of formula_7 together with formula_2. Then, the Wigner&#x27;s Friend scenario shows to Everett an incompatibility of the collapse postulate for describing measurements with the deterministic evolution of closed systems. In the context of his new theory, Everett claims to solve the Wigner&#x27;s friend paradox by only allowing a continuous unitary time evolution of the wave function of the universe. However, there is no evidence of any written argument of Everett&#x27;s on the topic.

In many-worlds interpretations, measurements are modelled as interactions between subsystems of the universe and manifest themselves as a branching of the universal state. The different branches account for the different possible measurement outcomes and are seen to exist as subjective experiences of the corresponding observers. In this view, the friend&#x27;s measurement of the spin results in a branching of the world into two parallel worlds, one, in which the friend has measured the spin to be 1, and another, in which the friend has received the measurement outcome 0. If then Wigner measures at a later time the combined system of friend and spin system, the world again splits into two parallel parts.

===Objective-collapse theories===
According to objective-collapse theories, wave-function collapse occurs when a superposed system reaches a certain objective threshold of size or complexity. Objective-collapse proponents would expect a system as macroscopic as a cat to have collapsed before the box was opened, so the question of observation-of-observers does not arise for them. If the measured system were much simpler (such as a single spin state), then once the observation was made, the system would be expected to collapse, since the larger system of the scientist, equipment, and room would be considered far too complex to become entangled in the superposition.

===Relational quantum mechanics===
Relational quantum mechanics (RQM) was developed in 1996 by Carlo Rovelli and is one of the more recent interpretations of quantum mechanics. In RQM, any physical system can play the role of an observing system, to which any other system may display &quot;facts&quot; about physical variables. This inherent relativity of facts in RQM provides a straightforward &quot;solution&quot; to the seemingly paradoxical situation in Wigner&#x27;s friend scenario: The state that the friend assigns to the spin is a state relative to himself as friend, whereas the state that Wigner assigns to the combined system of friend and spin is a state relative to himself as Wigner. By construction of the theory, these two descriptions do not have to match, because both are correct assignments of states relative to their respective system.

If the physical variable that is measured of the spin system is denoted by &quot;z&quot;, where &quot;z&quot; takes the possible outcome values 0 or 1, the above Wigner&#x27;s friend situation is modelled in the RQM context as follows: formula_2 models the situation as the before-after-transition
formula_10
of the state of formula_7 relative to him (here it was assumed that formula_2 received the outcome &quot;z&quot; = 1 in his measurement of formula_7).

In RQM language, the fact &quot;z&quot; = 1 for the spin of formula_7 actualized itself relative to formula_2 during the interaction of the two systems.

A different way to model the same situation is again an outside (Wigner&#x27;s) perspective. From that viewpoint, a measurement by one system (formula_2) of another (formula_7) results in a correlation of the two systems. The state displaying such a correlation is equally valid for modelling the measurement process. However, the system with respect to which this correlated state is valid changes. Assuming that Wigner (formula_1) has the information that the physical variable &quot;z&quot; of formula_7 is being measured by formula_2, but not knowing what formula_2 received as result, formula_1 must model the situation as
formula_23
where formula_24 is considered the state of formula_2 before the measurement, and formula_26 and formula_27 are the states corresponding to formula_2&#x27;s state when he has measured 1 or 0 respectively. This model is depicting the situation as relative to formula_1, so the assigned states are relative states with respect to the Wigner system. In contrast, there is no value for the &quot;z&quot; outcome that actualizes with respect to formula_1, as he is not involved in the measurement.

In this sense, two accounts of the same situation (process of the measurement of the physical variable &quot;z&quot; on the system formula_7 by formula_2) are accepted within RQM to exist side by side. Only when deciding for a reference system, a statement for the &quot;correct&quot; account of the situation can be made.

===QBism and Bayesian interpretations===
In the interpretation known as QBism, advocated by N. David Mermin among others, the Wigner&#x27;s-friend situation does not lead to a paradox, because there is never a uniquely correct wavefunction for any system. Instead, a wavefunction is a statement of personalist Bayesian probabilities, and moreover, the probabilities that wavefunctions encode are probabilities for experiences that are also personal to the agent who experiences them. Jaynes expresses this as follows: “There is a paradox only if we suppose that a density matrix (i.e. a probability distribution) is something ‘physically real’ and ‘absolute’. But now the dilemma disappears when we recognize the ‘relativity principle’ for probabilities. A density matrix (or, in classical physics, a probability distribution over coordinates and momenta) represents, not a physical situation, but only a certain &quot;state of knowledge&quot; about a range of possible physical situations”. And as von Baeyer puts it, “Wavefunctions are not tethered to electrons and carried along like haloes hovering over the heads of saints—they are assigned by an agent and depend on the total information available to the agent.” Consequently, there is nothing wrong in principle with Wigner and his friend assigning different wavefunctions to the same system. A similar position is taken by Brukner, who uses an elaboration of the Wigner&#x27;s-friend scenario to argue for it.

===De Broglie–Bohm theory===
The De Broglie-Bohm theory, also known as Bohmian mechanics or pilot wave theory, postulates, in addition to the wave function, an actual configuration of particles that exists even when unobserved. This particle configuration evolves in time according to a deterministic law, with the wave function guiding the motion of the particles. The particle configuration determines the actual measurement outcome —e.g., whether Schrödinger&#x27;s cat is dead or alive or whether Wigner&#x27;s friend has measured 0 or 1— even if the wave function is a superposition. Indeed, according to the De Broglie-Bohm theory, the wave function never collapses on the fundamental level. There is, however, a concept of &quot;effective collapse&quot;, based on the fact that, in many situations, &quot;empty branches&quot; of the wave function, which do not guide the actual particle configuration, can be ignored for all practical purposes.

The De Broglie-Bohm theory does not assign any special status to conscious observers. In the Wigner&#x27;s-friend situation, the first measurement would lead to an effective collapse. But even if Wigner describes the state of his friend as a superposition, there is no contradiction with this friend having observed a definite measurement outcome as described by the particle configuration. Thus, according to the De Broglie-Bohm theory, there is no paradox because the wave function alone is not a complete description of the physical state.

==An extension of the Wigner&#x27;s friend experiment==
In 2016, Frauchiger and Renner used an elaboration of the Wigner&#x27;s-friend scenario to argue that quantum theory cannot be used to model physical systems that are themselves agents who use quantum theory. They provide an information-theoretic analysis of two specifically connected pairs of &quot;Wigner&#x27;s friend&quot; experiments, where the human observers are modelled within quantum theory. By then letting the four different agents reason about each other&#x27;s measurement results (using the laws of quantum mechanics), contradictory statements are derived.

The resulting theorem highlights an incompatibility of a number of assumptions that are usually taken for granted when modelling measurements in quantum mechanics.

In the title of their published version of September 2018, the authors&#x27; interpretation of their result is apparent: Quantum theory as given by the textbook and used in the numerous laboratory experiments to date &quot;cannot consistently describe the use of itself&quot; in any given (hypothetical) scenario. The implications of the result are currently subject to many debates among physicists of both theoretical and experimental quantum mechanics. In particular, the various proponents of the different interpretations of quantum mechanics have challenged the validity of the Frauchiger–Renner argument.

The experiment was designed using a combination of arguments by Wigner (Wigner&#x27;s friend), Deutsch and Hardy (see Hardy&#x27;s paradox). The setup involves a number of macroscopic agents (observers) performing predefined quantum measurements in a given time order. Those agents are assumed to all be aware of the whole experiment and to be able to use quantum theory to make statements about other people&#x27;s measurement results. The design of the thought experiment is such that the different agents&#x27; observations along with their logical conclusions drawn from a quantum-theoretical analysis yields inconsistent statements.

The scenario corresponds roughly to two parallel pairs of &quot;Wigners&quot; and friends: formula_33 with formula_34 and formula_35 with formula_36. The friends each measure a specific spin system, and each Wigner measures &quot;his&quot; friend&#x27;s laboratory (which includes the friend). The individual agents make logical conclusions that are based on their measurement result, aiming at predictions about other agent&#x27;s measurements within the protocol. Frauchiger and Renner argue that an inconsistency occurs if three assumptions are taken to be simultaneously valid. Roughly speaking, those assumptions are
: (Q): Quantum theory is correct.
: (C): Agent&#x27;s predictions are information-theoretically consistent.
: (S): A measurement yields only one single outcome.

More precisely, assumption (Q) involves the probability predictions within quantum theory given by the Born rule. This means that an agent is allowed to trust this rule being correct in assigning probabilities to other outcomes conditioned on his own measurement result. It is, however, sufficient for the extended Wigner&#x27;s friend experiment to assume the validity of the Born rule for probability-1 cases, i.e., if the prediction can be made with certainty.

Assumption (C) invokes a consistency among different agents&#x27; statements in the following manner: The statement &quot;I know (by the theory) that they know (by the same theory) that x&quot; is equivalent to &quot;I know that x&quot;.

Assumption (S) specifies that once an agent has arrived at a probability-1 assignment of a certain outcome for a given measurement, they could never agree to a different outcome for the same measurement.

Assumptions (Q) and (S) are used by the agents when reasoning about measurement outcomes of other agents, and assumption (C) comes in when an agent combines other agent&#x27;s statements with their own. The result is contradictory, and therefore, assumptions (Q), (C) and (S) cannot all be valid, hence the no-go theorem.

===Reflection===
The meaning and implications of the Frauchiger–Renner thought experiment are highly debated. A number of assumptions taken in the argument are very foundational in content and therefore cannot be given up easily. However, the question remains whether there are &quot;hidden&quot; assumptions that do not explicitly appear in the argument. The authors themselves conclude that &quot;quantum theory cannot be extrapolated to complex systems, at least not in a straightforward manner&quot;. On the other hand, one presentation of the experiment as a quantum circuit models the agents as single qubits and their reasoning as simple conditional operations.

QBism, relational quantum mechanics and the De Broglie–Bohm theory have been argued to avoid the contradiction suggested by the extended Wigner&#x27;s-friend scenario of Frauchiger and Renner.

==In fiction==
Stephen Baxter&#x27;s novel &quot;Timelike Infinity&quot; (1992) discusses a variation of Wigner&#x27;s friend thought experiment through a refugee group of humans self-named &quot;The Friends of Wigner&quot;. They believe that an ultimate observer at the end of time may collapse all possible entangled wave-functions generated since the beginning of the universe, hence choosing a reality without oppression.

<text>ACCESS Systems Americas, Inc. (formerly PalmSource) is a subsidiary of ACCESS which develops the Palm OS PDA operating system and its successor, the Access Linux Platform, as well as BeOS. PalmSource was spun off from Palm Computing, Inc.

Palm OS runs on 38 million devices that have been sold since 1996 from hardware manufacturers including Palm, Inc., Samsung, IBM, Aceeca, AlphaSmart, Fossil, Inc., Garmin, Group Sense PDA (Xplore), Kyocera, PiTech, Sony, and Symbol. PalmSource also develops several programs for the Palm OS, and as of December 2005, PalmGear claims to offer 28,769 software titles of varying genres. Palm OS software programs can also be downloaded from CNET, PalmSource, Handango, and Tucows.

PalmSource also owns BeOS, which it purchased from Be Inc. in August 2001.

== History ==
In January 2002, Palm, Inc. set up a wholly owned subsidiary to develop and license Palm OS, which was named PalmSource in February. In October 2003, PalmSource was spun off from Palm as an independent company, and Palm renamed itself palmOne. palmOne and PalmSource set up a holding company that owned the Palm trademark.

In January 2004, PalmSource announced the successor to classic Palm OS called Palm OS Cobalt. However, it failed to gain support from hardware licensees. That December, PalmSource acquired China MobileSoft, a software company with a mobile Linux offering. As a result, PalmSource announced that they would extend Palm OS to run on top of the Linux architecture.

In May 2005, palmOne purchased PalmSource&#x27;s share of the Palm trademark for US$30 million and two months later renamed itself Palm, Inc. As part of the agreement, palmOne granted certain rights to Palm trademarks to PalmSource and licensees for a four-year transition period. Later that year, ACCESS, which specializes in mobile and embedded web browser technologies, including NetFront, acquired PalmSource for US$324 million. In October 2006, PalmSource announced that it would rename itself to ACCESS, to match its parent company&#x27;s name.

<text>The Summa Logicae (&quot;Sum of Logic&quot;) is a textbook on logic by William of Ockham. It was written around 1323.

Systematically, it resembles other works of medieval logic, organised under the basic headings of the Aristotelian Predicables, Categories, terms, propositions, and syllogisms. These headings, though often given in a different order, represent the basic arrangement of scholastic works on logic.

This work is important in that it contains the main account of Ockham&#x27;s nominalism, a position related to the problem of universals.

==Book I. On Terms==
==Book II. On Propositions==

==Book III. On Syllogisms==

===Part I. On Syllogisms===

===Part II. On Demonstration===

* These 41 chapters are a systematic exposition of Aristotle&#x27;s Posterior Analytics.

===Part III. On Consequences===

* The first 37 chapters of Part II are a systematic exposition of Aristotle&#x27;s Topics. In Part III, Ockham deals with the definition and division of consequences, and provides a treatment of Aristotle&#x27;s Topical rules. According to Ockham a consequence is a conditional proposition, composed of two categorical propositions by the terms &#x27;if&#x27; and &#x27;then&#x27;. For example, &#x27;if a man runs, then God exists&#x27; (&quot;Si homo currit, Deus est&quot;). A consequence is &#x27;true&#x27; when the antecedent implies the consequent. Ockham distinguishes between &#x27;material&#x27; and &#x27;formal&#x27; consequences, which are roughly equivalent to the modern material implication and logical implication respectively. Similar accounts are given by Jean Buridan and Albert of Saxony.
* Chapters 38 to 45 deal with the Theory of obligationes.
*Chapter 46 deals with the Liar Paradox

===Part VI. On Fallacies (in 18 chapters)===
Part IV, in eighteen chapters, deals with the different species of fallacy enumerated by Aristotle in Sophistical Refutations (&quot;De sophisticis elenchis&quot;).

*Chapters 2-4 deal with the three modes of equivocation.
*Chapters 5-7 deal with the three types of amphiboly.
*Chapter 8 deals with the fallacies of composition, and division.
*Chapter 9 deals with the fallacy of accent.
*Chapter 10 deals with the fallacy of &#x27;figure of speech&#x27;.
*Chapter 11 deals with the fallacy of accident.
*Chapter 12 deals with the fallacy of affirming the consequent.
*Chapter 13 deals with &quot;secundum quid et simpliciter&quot;.
*Chapter 14 deals with Ignoratio elenchi or irrelevant thesis.
*Chapter 15 deals with begging the question (&quot;petitio principii&quot;).
*Chapter 16 deals with false cause (&quot;non-causam ut causam&quot;)
*Chapter 17 deals with the fallacy of many questions (&quot;plures interrogationes ut unam facere&quot;)&gt;
*Ockham ends (chapter 18) by showing how all these fallacies err against the syllogism.

<text>QuarkXPress is desktop publishing software for creating and editing complex page layouts in a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) environment. It runs on macOS and Windows. It was first released by Quark, Inc. in 1987 and is still owned and published by them.

The most recent version, QuarkXPress 2024 (internal version number 20.0.0), introduces two new palettes: Font Manager and Picture Links, and has compatibility with macOS Sonoma, as well as the option to export to IDML format.

QuarkXPress is used by designers, publishing houses and corporations to produce from printable to multimedia projects. Recent versions have added support for ebooks/flipbooks, Web and mobile apps.

== History ==
QuarkXPress was founded by Tim Gill in 1981 with a $2,000 loan from his parents, with the introduction of Fred Ebrahimi as CEO in 1986.

The first version of QuarkXPress was released in 1987 for the Macintosh. Five years passed before a Microsoft Windows version (3.1) followed in 1992. In the 1990s, QuarkXPress became widely used by professional page designers, the typesetting industry and printers. In particular, the Mac version of 3.3 (released in 1996) was seen as stable and trouble-free, working seamlessly with Adobe&#x27;s PostScript fonts as well as with Apple&#x27;s TrueType fonts. Quark&#x27;s AppleScript support was a significant factor in both Quark&#x27;s and AppleScript&#x27;s success.

In 1989, QuarkXPress incorporated an application programming interface called XTensions which allows third-party developers to create custom add-on features to the desktop application. Xtensions, along with Adobe&#x27;s Photoshop plugins, was one of the first examples of a developer allowing others to create software add-ons for their application.

Although competitors like PageMaker existed, QuarkXPress was so dominant that it had an estimated 95% market share during the 1990s. After QuarkXPress 3.3, QuarkXPress was seen as needing significant improvements and users criticized it for its overly long innovation cycles.

Gill sold his 50% stake in the company in 1999 for a reported $500 million.

The release of QuarkXPress version 5 in 2002 led to disappointment from Apple&#x27;s user base, as QuarkXPress did not support Mac OS X, while Adobe InDesign 2.0—launched in the same week—did. QuarkXPress also lost marketshare due to an increasing price gap between it and InDesign. InDesign CS cost $699, while QuarkXPress 6 cost $945. The later Adobe Creative Suite (2003), which users purchased for access to Photoshop and Illustrator, included InDesign.

In response to a shrinking user base, Quark started to lower its pricing levels in 2004. In December 2006, Quark licensed the Windows version of QuarkXPress 5 to be distributed for free on the cover of a UK computer magazine, &quot;Computer Shopper&quot;, with the idea of enticing consumers to upgrade to later versions.

Having arrived late with a Mac OS X version, Quark took a different approach to porting to Intel-native applications on Mac (Universal Binary), and released its Universal Binary version 7 months before Adobe ported InDesign.

QuarkXPress 9 won Product of the Year in 2011 (MacWorld Awards 2011: Grand Prix Winner).

From 2015 to 2022, QuarkXPress updated on an annual cycle. Since 2023, QuarkXPress releases on a bi-annual basis.

== Use and features ==
The package provides the basic functionality of font, alignment, spacing, and color, but it also provides its users with professional typesetting options such as kerning, curving text along a line, and ligatures.

A QuarkXPress document contains text and graphics boxes. The boxes can be reshaped, layered, and given varying levels of transparency and text alignment (&quot;runaround&quot;). Both box positioning and graphic or text positioning is allowed within a box with an accuracy of one-thousandth of an inch.

Color control allows the full-use of printing-press standard Pantone or Hexachrome inks, along with a variety of other color-space options. Draft output can be printed on conventional desktop printers. Process color (CMYK) separation films can be produced for printing-presses. QuarkXPress also offers the ability for composite work-flows, both with PostScript and PDF output.

QuarkXPress offers layout synchronization, multiple undo/redo functionality, XML and web page (HTML) features, and support for direct PDF import and output. Documents can be verified (&quot;pre-flight&quot;) before printing. This high-level print preview automatically identifies conflicts and other printing problems. Adobe has a similar feature in InDesign.

Composition zones feature makes it the only desktop application with multi-user capabilities by allowing multiple users to edit different zones on the same page. Composition Zones pushes collaboration a step further than just simultaneous text/picture (as possible with Quark CopyDesk since 1991), as it allows layout and graphic elements to be edited outside the layout application.

User-defined rules, output specs, and layout specs can be used for intelligent templates and enable resource sharing (for example, server-based style sheet definitions).

Version 6.5, released at the end of 2004, added enhanced support for the Photoshop format (PSD). The PSD integration and picture manipulation features led to QuarkXPress receiving a number of awards, such as the &quot;Macworld&quot; Editor&#x27;s Choice for 2004.

Version 7 added support for OpenType, Unicode, JDF, and also PDF/X-export. QuarkXPress 7 also added unique features, such as native transparency at the color level.

QuarkXPress 8 introduced a completely new user interface, support for drag and drop, PDF 1.7 import, AI Import and a global file format. Design grids can be assigned to pages and boxes to allow unlimited baseline grids. Hanging characters can be applied and customized by character and amount to hang outside the box. This is the first version to include built-in Adobe Flash authoring. Designers can create Flash content including sound, video, animation and interactivity without programming. In October 2008, QuarkXPress 8 won the MacUser Award for Print Publishing Software of the Year.

With version 9 QuarkXPress extended its crossmedia publishing approach and can be used now to also export to eBooks (ePub3 and Blio) and native apps (for the iPad). With App Studio, which is shipped with QuarkXPress, designers can even create and design their own apps. Additionally QuarkXPress 9 offers cascading styles (stylesheets based on text content), callouts (anchored objects that flow with the text based on position rules), create complex ad editable Bézier paths using a wizard (ShapeMaker), bullets and numbers (with import and export from/to Microsoft Word) and more.

The Mac version of QuarkXPress 9 is for Intel processors only, making QuarkXPress 8.5.1 the last choice for PPC-based Macs.

QuarkXPress 10, was described by Quark as a major re-write of the software on the Mac platform in particular to move it from the older Carbon API to Cocoa. It also included a new, modern graphics engine, Xenon. During the lifecycle of version 10, new features included Retina Display support, PDF pass-through transparency, notes, redlining, increased zoom (8000%) and the ability to create HTML5 animations for inclusion in App Studio tablet and smartphone apps.

QuarkXPress 2015 was the first version to use a different naming scheme. It was completely 64-bit and added fixed-layout ePub and Kindle export as well as exporting layouts as PDF/X-4. Quark claimed to have added the top 10 of all user-requested features.

QuarkXPress 2016 included the ability to import and copy and paste from other applications and file formats to native QuarkXPress objects. The release also includes revamped digital capabilities including being able to create HTML5 Publications. Top user requested features include multi-gradient blends and a color picker tool.

QuarkXPress 2017 continued the new naming scheme and established an annual release cycle. The headline features include non-destructive image editing, various typography enhancements such as text stroking and text shading, responsive HTML5, and unlimited iOS apps for no additional cost (outside of the Apple Developer fees). Other user-requested features included adaptive layout conversion for print, smart quotes, and proportional leading.

On March 1, 2018, Quark announced QuarkXPress 2018, stating it would be available on May 16, 2018. The headline features in version 2018 include new OpenType controls, hyphenation strictness, support for color fonts, IDML import (to convert Adobe InDesign documents to QuarkXPress) and the ability to create unlimited Android apps for no additional cost (outside of the Google Play fees).

On November 14, 2023,  the company released QuarkXPress 2024&#x27;s, including integration with 1,500 Google fonts, a new Visual Fonts and Picture Links palette, macOS Sonoma compatibility, image format support for WebP, HEIF and HEIC, local image libraries support, IDML export format, GREP support, and enhanced Right-to-Left language capabilities.

=== Server version ===
In the beginning of 2003 Quark released a server version of QuarkXPress, originally called QuarkDDS. Renamed in 2006 to &quot;QuarkXPress Server&quot;, the product is now primarily sold with Quark Publishing Platform – the central hub of the company&#x27;s content automation solutions. QuarkXPress Server is a Java application that takes content components (text, images, video, data, charts, etc.) and automatically assembles them into different formats from PDFs to responsive HTML and Web apps. As the content is assembled into templates using granular content components, the output can be highly customized for different audiences in terms of the content and the brand. The system relies on XML.

===Extensions and tools===
====Quark Interactive Designer====
Quark Interactive Designer is an extension and tool for creating Adobe Flash context from QuarkXPress documents. It enables the export QuarkXPress projects in SWF (Flash) file format. This allows documents created for print or web production to also be output as a Flash advertisement. No knowledge of timelines or ActionScript is necessary for this purpose. Since QuarkXPress is natively capable of creating HTML projects, this allows web designers to design and build their HTML and Flash elements and combine them all in a single application. Resulting files can be exported as SWF Flash files or standalone Projector applications for macOS or Windows. Quark Interactive Designer makes use of palette-based actions, similar to those found in PowerPoint, in order to animate text and graphics. It also allows some use of button-triggered behaviors and embedding of QuickTime and Flash Video, and audio files.

<doc id="71135" wikidata="Q165371" url="?curid=71135" title="Pink triangle">
<text>A pink triangle has been a symbol for the LGBT community, initially intended as a badge of shame, but later reappropriated as a positive symbol of self-identity. In Nazi Germany in the 1930s and 1940s, it began as one of the Nazi concentration camp badges, distinguishing those imprisoned because they had been identified by authorities as gay men or trans women. In the 1970s, it was revived as a symbol of protest against homophobia, and has since been adopted by the larger LGBT community as a popular symbol of LGBT pride and the LGBT movements and queer liberation movements.

== History==

===Nazi prisoner identification ===
In Nazi concentration camps, each prisoner was required to wear a downward-pointing, equilateral triangular cloth badge on their chest, the color of which identified the stated reason for their imprisonment. Early on, prisoners perceived as gay men were variously identified with a green triangle (indicating criminals) or red triangle (political prisoners), the number &quot;175&quot; (referring to Paragraph 175, the section of the German penal code criminalizing homosexual activity), or the letter &quot;A&quot; (which stood for , literally &quot;arse fucker&quot;).

Later, the use of a pink triangle was established for prisoners identified as homosexual men and transgender women. (Lesbian and bisexual women and trans men were not systematically imprisoned; some were classified as &quot;asocial&quot;, wearing a black triangle.) The pink triangle was also assigned to others considered sexual deviants, including zoophiles and pedophiles in addition to sex offenders. If a prisoner was also identified as Jewish, the triangle was superimposed over a second yellow triangle pointing the opposite way, to resemble the Star of David like the yellow badge identifying other Jews. Prisoners wearing a pink triangle were harshly treated by most other prisoners.

After the camps were liberated at the end of the Second World War, some of the prisoners imprisoned for homosexuality were re-incarcerated by the Allied-established Federal Republic of Germany, as the Nazi laws against homosexuality were not repealed there until 1969. An out homosexual man named Heinz Dörmer, for instance, served in a Nazi concentration camp and then in the jails of the new Republic. The Nazi amendments to Paragraph 175, which turned homosexuality, previously labeled as a minor offense, into a felony, remained intact in East Germany until 1968 and in West Germany until 1969. West Germany continued to imprison those identified as homosexual until 1994 under a revised version of the Paragraph, which still made sex between men up to the age of 21—as well as queer male sex work—illegal. While many, though not all, lawsuits seeking monetary compensation have failed, in 2002 the German government issued an official apology to gay men who were persecuted during the war.

Rudolf Brazda, one of the last known homosexual concentration camp survivors, died on August 3, 2011, at the age of 98.

=== Symbol of LGBTQ+ liberation ===
In the 1970s, newly active Australian, European and North American queer liberation advocates began to use the pink triangle to raise awareness of its use in Nazi Germany. In 1972, gay concentration camp survivor Heinz Heger&#x27;s memoir (&quot;The Men with the Pink Triangle&quot;) brought it to greater public attention. In response, the German gay liberation group issued a call in 1973 for gay men to wear it as a memorial to past victims and to protest continuing discrimination. In the 1975 movie &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot;, Dr. Frank N. Furter—a bisexual transvestite—wears a pink triangle badge on one of his outfits. In 1976, Peter Recht, Detlef Stoffel, and Christiane Schmerl made the German documentary (&quot;Pink Triangle? That was such a long time ago...&quot;). Publications such as San Francisco&#x27;s &quot;Gay Sunshine&quot; and Toronto&#x27;s &quot;The Body Politic&quot; promoted the pink triangle as a memorial to those who had faced persecution and oppression.

In the 1980s, the pink triangle was increasingly used not just as a memorial but as a positive symbol of both self-identity and community identity. It commonly represented both gay and lesbian identity, and was incorporated into the logos of such organizations and businesses. It was also used by individuals, sometimes discreetly or ambiguously as an &quot;insider&quot; code unfamiliar to the heterosexual majority. The logo for the 1987 March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights was a silhouette of the US Capitol Dome superimposed over a pink triangle.
The design of the biangles symbol of bisexuality began with the pink triangle. The biangles symbol was designed by artist Liz Nania as she co-organized a bisexual contingent for the Second National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights in 1987. The addition of a blue triangle to the pink triangle in the biangles symbol contrasts the pink and represents heterosexuality. The two triangles overlap and form lavender, which represents the &quot;queerness of bisexuality&quot;, referencing the Lavender Menace and 1980s and 1990s associations of lavender with queerness. 

Taking a more militant tone, the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) was formed by six gay activists in New York City in 1987, and to draw attention to the disease&#x27;s disproportionate impact on gay and bisexual men, and the apparent role of &quot;genocidal&quot; queer-antagonism in slowing progress on medical research, adopted an upward-pointing pink triangle on a black field along with the slogan &quot;SILENCE = DEATH&quot; as its logo. Some use the triangle in this orientation as a specific &quot;reversal&quot; of its usage by the Nazis. The Pink Panthers Movement in Denver, Colorado, adopted a pink triangle with clawed panther print logo, adapted from the original Pink Panthers Patrol in New York City.

In the 1990s, a pink triangle enclosed in a green circle came to be commonly used as a symbol identifying &quot;safe spaces&quot; for LGBTQ+ people at work or in school.

Use of the pink triangle symbol is not without criticism. In 1993, historian Klaus Müller argued that &quot;the pink triangles of the concentration camps became an international symbol of gay and lesbian pride because so few of us are haunted by concrete memories of those who were forced to wear them.&quot;

== Memorials ==
The symbol of the pink triangle has been included in numerous public monuments and memorials. In 1980 a jury chose the pink triangle design for the Homomonument in Amsterdam, to memorialize gay and bisexual men killed in the Holocaust (and also victims of anti-gay violence generally). In 1995, after a decade of campaigning for it, a pink triangle plaque was installed at the Dachau Memorial Museum to commemorate the suffering of gay men and lesbians. In 2015 a pink triangle was incorporated into Chicago&#x27;s Legacy Walk. It is the basis of the design of the Gay and Lesbian Holocaust Memorial in Sydney. In 2001 it inspired both San Francisco&#x27;s Pink Triangle Park in the Castro and the Pink Triangle on Twin Peaks that is displayed every year during the Pride weekend. It is also the basis for LGBTQ+ memorials in Barcelona, Sitges, and Montevideo, and the burial component of the LGBTQ+ Pink Dolphin Monument in Galveston.

<doc id="71138" wikidata="Q842189" url="?curid=71138" title="Wave function collapse">
<text>In quantum mechanics, wave function collapse, also called reduction of the state vector, occurs when a wave function—initially in a superposition of several eigenstates—reduces to a single eigenstate due to interaction with the external world. This interaction is called an &quot;observation&quot; and is the essence of a measurement in quantum mechanics, which connects the wave function with classical observables such as position and momentum. Collapse is one of the two processes by which quantum systems evolve in time; the other is the continuous evolution governed by the Schrödinger equation.

While standard quantum mechanics postulates wave function collapse to connect quantum to classical models, some extension theories propose physical processes that cause collapse. The in depth study of quantum decoherence has proposed that collapse is related to the interaction of a quantum system with its environment.

Historically, Werner Heisenberg was the first to use the idea of wave function reduction to explain quantum measurement.

==Mathematical description==

In quantum mechanics each measurable physical quantity of a quantum system is called an observable which, for example, could be the position formula_1 and the momentum formula_2 but also energy formula_3, formula_4 components of spin (formula_5), and so on. The observable acts as a linear function on the states of the system; its eigenvectors correspond to the quantum state (i.e. eigenstate) and the eigenvalues to the possible values of the observable. The collection of eigenstates/eigenvalue pairs represent all possible values of the observable. Writing formula_6 for an eigenstate and formula_7 for the corresponding observed value, any arbitrary state of the quantum system can be expressed as a vector using bra–ket notation: 
formula_8
The kets formula_9 specify the different available quantum &quot;alternatives&quot;, i.e., particular quantum states.

The wave function is a specific representation of a quantum state. Wave functions can therefore always be expressed as eigenstates of an observable though the converse is not necessarily true.

===Collapse===
To account for the experimental result that repeated measurements of a quantum system give the same results, the theory postulates a &quot;collapse&quot; or &quot;reduction of the state vector&quot; upon observation, abruptly converting an arbitrary state into a single component eigenstate of the observable:
:formula_10
where the arrow represents a measurement of the observable corresponding to the formula_11 basis.
For any single event, only one eigenvalue is measured, chosen randomly from among the possible values.

===Meaning of the expansion coefficients===
The complex coefficients formula_12 in the expansion of a quantum state in terms of eigenstates formula_9, 
formula_8
can be written as an (complex) overlap of the corresponding eigenstate and the quantum state:
formula_15
They are called the probability amplitudes. The square modulus formula_16 is the probability that a measurement of the observable yields the eigenstate formula_17. The sum of the probability over all possible outcomes must be one:
:formula_18

As examples, individual counts in a double slit experiment with electrons appear at random locations on the detector; after many counts are summed the distribution shows a wave interference pattern. In a Stern-Gerlach experiment with silver atoms, each particle appears in one of two areas unpredictably, but the final conclusion has equal numbers of events in each area.

This statistical aspect of quantum measurements differs fundamentally from classical mechanics. In quantum mechanics the only information we have about a system is its wave function and measurements of its wave function can only give statistical information.

==Terminology==
The two terms &quot;reduction of the state vector&quot; (or &quot;state reduction&quot; for short) and &quot;wave function collapse&quot; are used to describe the same concept. A quantum state is a mathematical description of a quantum system; a quantum state vector uses Hilbert space vectors for the description. Reduction of the state vector replaces the full state vector with a single eigenstate of the observable.

The term &quot;wave function&quot; is typically used for a different mathematical representation of the quantum state, one that uses spatial coordinates also called the &quot;position representation&quot;. When the wave function representation is used, the &quot;reduction&quot; is called &quot;wave function collapse&quot;.

== The measurement problem ==
The Schrödinger equation describes quantum systems but does not describe their measurement. Solution to the equations include all possible observable values for measurements, but measurements only result in one definite outcome. This difference is called the measurement problem of quantum mechanics. To predict measurement outcomes from quantum solutions, the orthodox interpretation of quantum theory postulates wave function collapse and uses the Born rule to compute the probable outcomes. Despite the widespread quantitative success of these postulates scientists remain dissatisfied and have sought more detailed physical models. Rather than suspending the Schrödinger equation during the process of measurement, the measurement apparatus should be included and governed by the laws of quantum mechanics.

==Physical approaches to collapse==
Quantum theory offers no dynamical description of the &quot;collapse&quot; of the wave function. Viewed as a statistical theory, no description is expected. As Fuchs and Peres put it, &quot;collapse is something that happens in our description of the system, not to the system itself&quot;.

Various interpretations of quantum mechanics attempt to provide a physical model for collapse. Three treatments of collapse can be found among the common interpretations. The first group includes hidden-variable theories like de Broglie–Bohm theory; here random outcomes only result from unknown values of hidden variables. Results from tests of Bell&#x27;s theorem shows that these variables would need to be non-local. The second group models measurement as quantum entanglement between the quantum state and the measurement apparatus. This results in a simulation of classical statistics called quantum decoherence. This group includes the many-worlds interpretation and consistent histories models. The third group postulates additional, but as yet undetected, physical basis for the randomness; this group includes for example the objective-collapse interpretations. While models in all groups have contributed to better understanding of quantum theory, no alternative explanation for individual events has emerged as more useful than collapse followed by statistical prediction with the Born rule.

The significance ascribed to the wave function varies from interpretation to interpretation and even within an interpretation (such as the Copenhagen interpretation). If the wave function merely encodes an observer&#x27;s knowledge of the universe, then the wave function collapse corresponds to the receipt of new information. This is somewhat analogous to the situation in classical physics, except that the classical &quot;wave function&quot; does not necessarily obey a wave equation. If the wave function is physically real, in some sense and to some extent, then the collapse of the wave function is also seen as a real process, to the same extent.

===Quantum decoherence===
Quantum decoherence explains why a system interacting with an environment transitions from being a pure state, exhibiting superpositions, to a mixed state, an incoherent combination of classical alternatives. This transition is fundamentally reversible, as the combined state of system and environment is still pure, but for all practical purposes irreversible in the same sense as in the second law of thermodynamics: the environment is a very large and complex quantum system, and it is not feasible to reverse their interaction. Decoherence is thus very important for explaining the classical limit of quantum mechanics, but cannot explain wave function collapse, as all classical alternatives are still present in the mixed state, and wave function collapse selects only one of them.

The form of decoherence known as environment-induced superselection proposes that when a quantum system interacts with the environment, the superpositions &quot;apparently&quot; reduce to mixtures of classical alternatives. The combined wave function of the system and environment continue to obey the Schrödinger equation throughout this &quot;apparent&quot; collapse. More importantly, this is not enough to explain &quot;actual&quot; wave function collapse, as decoherence does not reduce it to a single eigenstate.

==History==
The concept of wavefunction collapse was introduced by Werner Heisenberg in his 1927 paper on the uncertainty principle, &quot;Über den anschaulichen Inhalt der quantentheoretischen Kinematik und Mechanik&quot;, and incorporated into the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics by John von Neumann, in his 1932 treatise &quot;Mathematische Grundlagen der Quantenmechanik&quot;. Heisenberg did not try to specify exactly what the collapse of the wavefunction meant. However, he emphasized that it should not be understood as a physical process. Niels Bohr never mentions wave function collapse in his published work, but he repeatedly cautioned that we must give up a &quot;pictorial representation&quot;. Despite the differences between Bohr and Heisenberg, their views are often grouped together as the &quot;Copenhagen interpretation&quot;, of which wave function collapse is regarded as a key feature.

John von Neumann&#x27;s influential 1932 work &quot;Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics&quot; took a more formal approach, developing an &quot;ideal&quot; measurement scheme that postulated that there were two processes of wave function change:

# The probabilistic, non-unitary, non-local, discontinuous change brought about by observation and measurement (state reduction or collapse).
# The deterministic, unitary, continuous time evolution of an isolated system that obeys the Schrödinger equation.

In 1957 Hugh Everett III proposed a model of quantum mechanics that dropped von Neumann&#x27;s first postulate. Everett observed that the measurement apparatus was also a quantum system and its quantum interaction with the system under observation should determine the results. He proposed that the discontinuous change is instead a splitting of a wave function representing the universe. While Everett&#x27;s approach rekindled interest in foundational quantum mechanics, it left core issues unresolved. Two key issues relate to origin of the observed classical results: what causes quantum systems to appear classical and to resolve with the observed probabilities of the Born rule.

Beginning in 1970 H. Dieter Zeh sought a detailed quantum decoherence model for the discontinuous change without postulating collapse. Further work by Wojciech H. Zurek in 1980 lead eventually to a large number of papers on many aspects of the concept. Decoherence assumes that every quantum system interacts quantum mechanically with its environment and such interaction is not separable from the system, a concept called an &quot;open system&quot;. Decoherence has been shown to work very quickly and within a minimal environment, but as yet it has not succeeded in a providing a detailed model replacing the collapse postulate of orthodox quantum mechanics.

By explicitly dealing with the interaction of object and measuring instrument, von Neumann described a quantum mechanical measurement scheme consistent with wave function collapse. However, he did not prove the &quot;necessity&quot; of such a collapse. Von Neumann&#x27;s projection postulate was conceived based on experimental evidence available during the 1930s, in particular Compton scattering. Later work refined the notion of measurements into the more easily discussed &quot;first kind&quot;, that will give the same value when immediately repeated, and the &quot;second kind&quot; that give different values when repeated.

<text>Star of India is an iron-hulled sailing ship, built in 1863 in Ramsey, Isle of Man, as the full-rigged ship Euterpe. After a career sailing from Great Britain to India and New Zealand, she was renamed, re-rigged as a barque, and became a salmon hauler on the Alaska to California route. Retired in 1926, she was restored as a seaworthy museum ship in 1962–3 and home-ported at the Maritime Museum of San Diego in San Diego, California. She is the oldest ship still sailing regularly and also the oldest iron-hulled merchant ship still afloat. The ship is both a California Historical Landmark and United States National Historic Landmark.

== History ==

=== As &quot;Euterpe&quot; ===
Named after Euterpe, the Greek muse of music, she was a full-rigged ship (a ship that is square-rigged on all three masts), built of iron in 1863 by Gibson, McDonald &amp; Arnold, of Ramsey, Isle of Man, for the Indian jute trade of Wakefield Nash &amp; Company of Liverpool. She was launched on 14 November 1863, and assigned British Registration No.47617 and signal VPJK.

&quot;Euterpe&#x27;s&quot; career had a rough beginning. She sailed for Calcutta from Liverpool on 9 January 1864, under the command of Captain William John Storry. A collision with an unlit Spanish brig off the coast of Wales carried away the jib-boom and damaged other rigging. The crew became mutinous, refusing to continue, and she returned to Anglesey for repair; 17 of the crew were confined to the Beaumaris Gaol at hard labour. Then, in 1865, &quot;Euterpe&quot; was forced to cut away her masts in a gale in the Bay of Bengal off Madras and limped to Trincomalee and Calcutta for repair. Captain Storry died during the return voyage to England and was buried at sea.

After her near-disastrous first two voyages &quot;Euterpe&quot; was sold, first in 1871 to David Brown of London for whom she made four more relatively uneventful voyages to India, then again (displaced by steamers after the opening of the Suez Canal) in 1871 to Shaw, Savill and Company of London (which in 1882 became the Shaw, Savill &amp; Albion Line). In late 1871 she began 25 years of carrying passengers and freight in the New Zealand emigrant trade, each voyage going eastward around the world before returning to England. The fastest of her 21 passages to New Zealand took 100 days, the longest 143 days. She also made ports of call in Australia, California, and Chile. A baby was born on one of those trips en route to New Zealand, and was given the middle name Euterpe. Another child, John William Philips Palmer, was born on the 1873 journey to Dunedin, New Zealand, and was partially named after the captain Theo E. Philips (&quot;Born Lo 42.30 south La 0.30 west at 11 am Feb 21&quot;).

In 1897, after 21 round-the-world trips, &quot;Euterpe&quot; was sold, first to Hawaiian owners, then in 1899 to the Pacific Colonial Ship Company of San Francisco, California, and from 1898 to 1901 made four voyages between the Pacific Northwest, Australia and Hawaii carrying primarily lumber, coal and sugar. She was registered in the United States on 30 October 1900.

=== As &quot;Star of India&quot; ===
In 1901, &quot;Euterpe&quot; was sold to the Alaska Packers&#x27; Association of San Francisco, who re-rigged her as a barque (converting the square-rigged aftermost mast to fore-and-aft) and in 1902 began carrying fishermen, cannery workers, coal and canning supplies each spring from Oakland, California, to Nushagak in the Bering Sea, returning each autumn with holds full of canned salmon. In 1906, the Association changed her name to be consistent with the rest of their fleet, and she became &quot;Star of India&quot;. She was laid up in 1923 after 22 Alaskan voyages; by that time, steam ruled the seas.

In 1926, &quot;Star of India&quot; was sold to the Zoological Society of San Diego to be the centrepiece of a planned museum and aquarium. The Great Depression and World War II caused that plan to be cancelled, and it was not until 1957 that restoration began. Alan Villiers, a windjammer captain and author, came to San Diego on a lecture tour. Seeing &quot;Star of India&quot; decaying in the harbor, he publicized the situation and inspired a group of citizens to form the &quot;Star of India Auxiliary&quot; in 1959 to support the restoration of the ship. Progress was still slow, but in 1976, &quot;Star of India&quot; finally put to sea again. She houses exhibits for the Maritime Museum of San Diego, is kept fully seaworthy, and sails at least once a year. With the many other ships now in the Museum, she hosts frequent tour guide-led school tours for over 6,000 children a year, as well as a Living History Program in which students &quot;step back in time&quot; and are immersed in history and teamwork activities during overnight visits.

The 1863 &quot;Star of India&quot; is the fourth oldest ship afloat in the United States, after the 1797 , 1841 &quot;Charles W. Morgan&quot;, and the 1854 , and is the oldest ship in the world that still sails regularly. Unlike many preserved or restored vessels, her hull, cabins and equipment are nearly 100% original.

== Home port ==

&quot;Star of India&quot; is docked at the Maritime Museum of San Diego, just south of San Diego International Airport, on the west side of North Harbor Drive at approximately Ash Street – all within the Port of San Diego tidelands. This location is slightly west of downtown San Diego, California. The other ships belonging to the Maritime Museum are always docked to the north of &quot;Star of India&quot;. Her nearest neighbour – since 2007 – is (a.k.a. HMS &quot;Rose&quot;), a replica of a British frigate.

When she sails, &quot;Star of India&quot; often remains within sight of the coast of San Diego County, and usually returns to her dock within a day. She is sailed by a skilled volunteer crew of Maritime Museum members, who train all year. She has become one of the landmark ships in San Diego&#x27;s harbor.

From August to September 2009, &quot;Star of India&quot; was removed from display to a local drydock facility for a required Coast Guard inspection and various maintenance below the waterline, at a cost of approximately $225,000, and 3–4 weeks off display.

Her most recent voyage was on November 12, 2023.

== Appearances in media ==
&quot;Star of India&quot; has appeared in episodes of:
* &quot;Dirty Jobs&quot; Season Four, Episode 89, &quot;Tar Rigger&quot;
* &quot;Ghost Hunters&quot; Season Four, Episode 426, &quot;Spirits on the Water&quot;.
* &quot;Great Ships&quot; episode &quot;The Windjammers&quot;.
* &quot;Haunted History&quot; Season One, Episode 3, &quot;Haunted Ships&quot;
* At the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con, Ubisoft used the ship to promote their new game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed IV: Black Flag&quot; and renamed the ship for 3 days after the in-game ship &quot;The Jackdaw&quot;.
* &quot;Ghost Adventures&quot; Season 12, Episode 6 &quot;Star of India&quot;
* There Goes a Boat, episode 7 of the Real Wheels children&#x27;s series.

<text>Euterpe (; , from + ) was one of the Muses in Greek mythology, presiding over music. In late Classical times, she was named muse of lyric poetry. She has been called &quot;Giver of delight&quot; by ancient poets.

==Mythology==
Euterpe was born as one of the daughters of Mnemosyne, Titan goddess of memory, and fathered by Zeus, god of the gods. Her sisters include Calliope (muse of epic poetry), Clio (muse of history), Melpomene (muse of tragedy), Terpsichore (muse of dancing), Erato (muse of erotic poetry), Thalia (muse of comedy), Polyhymnia (muse of hymns), and Urania (muse of astronomy). Sometimes they are referred to as water nymphs having been born from the four sacred springs on Helicon which flowed from the ground after Pegasus, the winged horse, stamped his hooves on the ground. The mountain spring Cassotis on Mount Parnassus was sacred to Euterpe and the other Muses. It flowed between two high rocks above the city of Delphi, and in ancient times its sacred waters were retained for the use of the Pythia, the priests, priestesses, as well as the oracle of Apollo. 

Along with her sister Muses, Euterpe was believed to have lived on Mount Olympus where she and her sisters entertained their father and the other Olympian gods with their great artistry. Later on, tradition also placed them on Mount Helicon in Boeotia where there was a major cult center to the goddesses, or on Mount Parnassus where the Castalian spring was a favorite destination for poets and artists.

Some people believe that she invented the aulos or double-flute, though most mythographers credit Marsyas or Athena with its invention. Some say she also invented other wind instruments. Euterpe is often depicted holding a flute in artistic renditions of her.

Pindar and other sources (the author of the &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;, and Servius), describe the Thracian king Rhesus, who appears in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, as son of Euterpe and the river-god Strymon; Homer calls him son of Eioneus.
==Functions==
Euterpe&#x27;s role, alongside her sisters, was to entertain the gods on Mount Olympus. She inspired the development of liberal and fine arts in Ancient Greece, serving as an inspiration to poets, dramatists, and authors such as Homer.

Traditionally, musicians would invoke Euterpe to inspire, guide and assist them in their compositions. Such petitions might take the form of a prayer for divine inspiration from the muse.

<text>In ancient Greek religion and mythology, the Muses (, ) are the inspirational goddesses of literature, science, and the arts. They were considered the source of the knowledge embodied in the poetry, lyric songs, and myths that were related orally for centuries in ancient Greek culture.

The number and names of the Muses differed by region, but from the Classical period the number of Muses was standardized to nine, and their names were generally given as Calliope, Clio, Polyhymnia, Euterpe, Terpsichore, Erato, Melpomene, Thalia, and Urania.

In modern figurative usage, a muse is a person who serves as someone&#x27;s source of artistic inspiration.

==Etymology==

The word &quot;Muses&quot; () perhaps came from the o-grade of the Proto-Indo-European root (the basic meaning of which is &#x27;put in mind&#x27; in verb formations with transitive function and &#x27;have in mind&#x27; in those with intransitive function), or from root (&#x27;to tower, mountain&#x27;) since all the most important cult-centres of the Muses were on mountains or hills. R. S. P. Beekes rejects the latter etymology and suggests that a Pre-Greek origin is also possible.

== Number and names ==

The earliest known records of the Muses come from Boeotia (Boeotian muses). Some ancient authorities regarded the Muses as of Thracian origin. In Thrace, a tradition of three original Muses persisted.

In the first century BC, Diodorus Siculus cited Homer and Hesiod to the contrary, observing:
Diodorus states (Book I.18) that Osiris first recruited the nine Muses, along with the satyrs, while passing through Aethiopia, before embarking on a tour of all Asia and Europe, teaching the arts of cultivation wherever he went.

According to Hesiod&#x27;s account (), generally followed by the writers of antiquity, the Nine Muses were the nine daughters of Zeus and Mnemosyne (i.e., &quot;Memory&quot; personified), figuring as personifications of knowledge and the arts, especially poetry, literature, dance and music.

The Roman scholar Varro (116–27 BC) relates that there are only three Muses: one born from the movement of water, another who makes sound by striking the air, and a third who is embodied only in the human voice. They were called Melete or &quot;Practice&quot;, Mneme or &quot;Memory&quot; and Aoide or &quot;Song&quot;. The &quot;Quaestiones Convivales&quot; of Plutarch (46–120 AD) also report three ancient Muses (9.I4.2–4).

However, the classical understanding of the Muses tripled their triad and established a set of nine goddesses, who embody the arts and inspire creation with their graces through remembered and improvised song and mime, writing, traditional music, and dance. It was not until Hellenistic times that the following systematic set of functions became associated with them, and even then some variation persisted both in their names and in their attributes:


According to Pausanias, who wrote in the later second century AD, there were originally three Muses, worshipped on Mount Helicon in Boeotia: Aoide (&#x27;song&#x27; or &#x27;tune&#x27;), Melete (&#x27;practice&#x27; or &#x27;occasion&#x27;), and Mneme (&#x27;memory&#x27;). Together, these three form the complete picture of the preconditions of poetic art in cult practice.

In Delphi too three Muses were worshipped, but with other names: Nete, Mese, and Hypate, which are assigned as the names of the three chords of the ancient musical instrument, the lyre.

Alternatively, later they were called Cephisso, Apollonis, and Borysthenis - names which characterize them as daughters of Apollo.

A later tradition recognized a set of four Muses: Thelxinoë, Aoide, Archē, and Melete, said to be daughters of Zeus and Plusia or of Ouranos.
One of the people frequently associated with the Muses was Pierus. By some he was called the father (by a Pimpleian nymph, called Antiope by Cicero) of a total of seven Muses, called (), (), (), (), Achelōís, (), and ().

== Mythology ==
According to Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot; (seventh century BC), they were daughters of Zeus, king of the gods, and Mnemosyne, Titan goddess of memory. Hesiod in Theogony narrates that the Muses brought to people forgetfulness, that is, the forgetfulness of pain and the cessation of obligations.

For Alcman and Mimnermus, they were even more primordial, springing from the early deities Ouranos and Gaia. Gaia is Mother Earth, an early mother goddess who was worshipped at Delphi from prehistoric times, long before the site was rededicated to Apollo, possibly indicating a transfer to association with him after that time.

Sometimes the Muses are referred to as water nymphs, associated with the springs of Helicon and with Pieris. It was said that the winged horse Pegasus touched his hooves to the ground on Helicon, causing four sacred springs to burst forth, from which the Muses, also known as pegasides, were born. Athena later tamed the horse and presented him to the Muses (compare the Roman inspiring nymphs of springs, the Camenae, the Völva of Norse Mythology and also the apsaras in the mythology of classical India).

Classical writers set Apollo as their leader, (&#x27;Apollo Muse-leader&#x27;). In one myth, the Muses judged a contest between Apollo and Marsyas. They also gathered the pieces of the dead body of Orpheus, son of Calliope, and buried them in Leivithra. In a later myth, Thamyris challenged them to a singing contest. They won and punished Thamyris by blinding him and robbing him of his singing ability.

According to a myth from Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;—alluding to the connection of Pieria with the Muses—Pierus, king of Macedon, had nine daughters he named after the nine Muses, believing that their skills were a great match to the Muses. He thus challenged the Muses to a match, resulting in his daughters, the &quot;Pierides&quot;, being turned into chattering jays (with often erroneously translated as &#x27;magpies&#x27;) for their presumption.

Pausanias records a tradition of two generations of Muses; the first are the daughters of Ouranos and Gaia, the second of Zeus and Mnemosyne. Another, rarer genealogy is that they are daughters of Harmonia (the daughter of Aphrodite and Ares), which contradicts the myth in which they were dancing at the wedding of Harmonia and Cadmus.

===Children===
Calliope had two sons, Ialemus and Orpheus, with Apollo. In another version of the story, the father of Orpheus was Oeagrus, but Apollo adopted him and taught him the skill of lyre while Calliope trained him in singing.

Linus was said to have been the son of Apollo and one of the Muses, either Calliope or Terpsichore or Urania. Rhesus was the son of Strymon and Calliope or Euterpe.

The sirens were the children of Achelous and Melpomene or Terpsichore. Kleopheme was the daughter of Erato and Malos. Hyacinth was the son of Clio, according to an unpopular account.

Hymenaeus was assigned as Apollo&#x27;s son by one of the muses, either Calliope, or Clio, or Terpsichore, or Urania. Corybantes were the children of Thalia and Apollo.

==Cult==

The Muses had several temples and shrines in ancient Greece, their two main cult centres being Mount Helikon in Boiotia, which holds the Valley of the Muses, and Pieria in Makedonia.
Strabo wrote: 
:&quot;Helikon, not far distant from Parnassos, rivals it both in height and in circuit; for both are rocky and covered with snow, and their circuit comprises no large extent of territory. Here are the temple of the Mousai and Hippukrene and the cave of the Nymphai called the Leibethrides; and from this fact one might infer that those who consecrated Helikon to the Mousai were Thrakians, the same who dedicated Pieris and Leibethron and Pimpleia [in Pieria] to the same goddesses. The Thrakians used to be called Pieres, but, now that they have disappeared, the Makedonians hold these places.&quot;
The cult of the Muses was also commonly connected to that of Apollo.

==Emblems==
The following table lists the Classical names and attributes of the standard list of the nine Muses, as well as their various associated symbols:

Some Greek writers give the names of the nine Muses as Kallichore, Helike, Eunike, Thelxinoë, Terpsichore, Euterpe, Eukelade, Dia, and Enope.

In Renaissance and Neoclassical art, the dissemination of emblem books such as Cesare Ripa&#x27;s &quot;Iconologia&quot; (1593 and many further editions) helped standardize the depiction of the Muses in sculpture and painting, so they could be distinguished by certain props. These props, or emblems, became readily identifiable by the viewer, enabling one immediately to recognize the Muse and the art with which she had become associated. Here again, Calliope (epic poetry) carries a writing tablet; Clio (history) carries a scroll and books; Euterpe (song and elegiac poetry) carries a double-pipe, the &quot;aulos&quot;; Erato (lyric poetry) is often seen with a lyre and a crown of roses; Melpomene (tragedy) is often seen with a tragic mask; Polyhymnia (sacred poetry) is often seen with a pensive expression; Terpsichore (choral dance and song) is often seen dancing and carrying a lyre; Thalia (comedy) is often seen with a comic mask; and Urania (astronomy) carries a pair of compasses and the celestial globe.

==Functions==

===In society===
The Greek word is a common noun as well as a type of goddess: it literally means &#x27;art&#x27; or &#x27;poetry&#x27;. According to Pindar, to &quot;carry a &quot; is &#x27;to excel in the arts&#x27;. The word derives from the Indo-European root , which is also the source of Greek &quot;Mnemosyne&quot; and , English &quot;mind&quot;, &quot;mental&quot; and &quot;monitor&quot;, Sanskrit &quot;mantra&quot; and Avestan .

The Muses, therefore, were both the embodiments and sponsors of performed metrical speech: (whence the English term &quot;music&quot;) was just &quot;one of the arts of the Muses&quot;. Others included science, geography, mathematics, philosophy, and especially art, drama, and inspiration. In the archaic period, before the widespread availability of books (scrolls), this included nearly all of learning. The first Greek book on astronomy, by Thales, took the form of dactylic hexameters, as did many works of pre-Socratic philosophy. Both Plato and the Pythagoreans explicitly included philosophy as a sub-species of . The &quot;Histories&quot; of Herodotus, whose primary medium of delivery was public recitation, were divided by Alexandrian editors into nine books, named after the nine Muses.

For poet and &quot;law-giver&quot; Solon, the Muses were &quot;the key to the good life&quot;; since they brought both prosperity and friendship. Solon sought to perpetuate his political reforms by establishing recitations of his poetry—complete with invocations to his practical-minded Muses—by Athenian boys at festivals each year. He believed that the Muses would help inspire people to do their best.

===In literature===
Ancient authors and some later authors and artists invoke Muses when writing poetry, hymns or epic history. Ancient authors invocations often occur near the beginning of their work. It asks for help or inspiration from the Muses, or simply invites the Muse to sing directly through the author.

Originally, the invocation of the Muse was an indication that the speaker was working inside the poetic tradition, according to the established formulas. For example:

These things declare to me from the beginning,

ye Muses who dwell in the house of Olympus,

and tell me which of them first came to be.

— Hesiod (c. 700 BCE), &quot;Theogony&quot; (Hugh G. Evelyn-White translation, 2015)

Sing to me of the man, Muse, the man of twists and turns

driven time and again off course, once he had plundered

the hallowed heights of Troy.
:—Homer (c. 700 - 600 BCE), in Book I of &quot;The Odyssey&quot; (Robert Fagles translation, 1996)

O Muse! the causes and the crimes relate;
What goddess was provok&#x27;d, and whence her hate;

For what offence the Queen of Heav&#x27;n began

To persecute so brave, so just a man; [...] 
:—Virgil (c. 29 - 19 BCE), in Book I of the &quot;Aeneid&quot; (John Dryden translation, 1697)

Besides Homer and Virgil, other famous works that included an invocation of the Muse are the first of the &quot;carmina&quot; by Catullus, Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; and &quot;Amores&quot;, Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot; (Canto II), Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Troilus and Criseyde&quot; (Book II), Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry V&quot; (Act 1, Prologue), his 38th sonnet, and Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; (openings of Books 1 and 7).
===In cults and modern museums===

When Pythagoras arrived at Croton, his first advice to the Crotoniates was to build a shrine to the Muses at the center of the city, to promote civic harmony and learning. Local cults of the Muses often became associated with springs or with fountains. The Muses themselves were sometimes called Aganippids because of their association with a fountain called Aganippe. Other fountains, Hippocrene and Pirene, were also important locations associated with the Muses. Some sources occasionally referred to the Muses as &quot;Corycides&quot; (or &quot;Corycian nymphs&quot;) after a cave on Mount Parnassos, called the Corycian Cave. Pausanias referred to the Muses by the surnames &quot;Ardalides&quot; or &quot;Ardaliotides&quot;, because of a sanctuary to them at Troezen said to have been built by the mythical Ardalus.

The Muses were venerated especially in Boeotia, in the Valley of the Muses near Helicon, and in Delphi and the Parnassus, where Apollo became known as (&#x27;Muse-leader&#x27;) after the sites were rededicated to his cult.

Often Muse-worship was associated with the hero-cults of poets: the tombs of Archilochus on Thasos and of Hesiod and Thamyris in Boeotia all played host to festivals in which poetic recitations accompanied sacrifices to the Muses. The Library of Alexandria and its circle of scholars formed around a (i.e., &#x27;museum&#x27; or shrine of the Muses) close to the tomb of Alexander the Great. Many Enlightenment figures sought to re-establish a &quot;Cult of the Muses&quot; in the 18th century. A famous Masonic lodge in pre-Revolutionary Paris was called Les Neuf Soeurs (&#x27;The Nine Sisters&#x27;, that is, the Nine Muses); Voltaire, Benjamin Franklin, Danton, and other influential Enlightenment figures attended it. As a side-effect of this movement the word &quot;museum&quot; (originally, &#x27;cult place of the Muses&#x27;) came to refer to a place for the public display of knowledge.

Museia (Μούσεια) was a festival dedicated to Muses which was held every fifth year on the lower slopes of Mount Helicon in Boeotia. There was also another festival which was called Museia, which was celebrated in schools.

=== Places named after the Muses ===
In New Orleans, Louisiana, there are streets named for all nine. It is commonly held that the local pronunciation of the names has been colorfully anglicized in an unusual manner by the &quot;Yat&quot; dialect. The pronunciations are actually in line with the French, Spanish, and Creole roots of the city.

== Modern use in the arts ==

The Muses are explicitly used in modern English to refer to an artistic inspiration, as when one cites one&#x27;s own artistic muse, and also implicit in words and phrases such as &quot;amuse&quot;, &quot;museum&quot; (Latinised from —a place where the Muses were worshipped), &quot;music&quot;, and &quot;musing upon&quot;. In current literature, the influential role that the Muse plays has been extended to the political sphere.

<text>Dordrecht (), historically known in English as Dordt (still colloquially used in Dutch, ) or Dort, is a city and municipality in the Western Netherlands, located in the province of South Holland. It is the province&#x27;s fifth-largest city after Rotterdam, The Hague, Leiden, and Zoetermeer, with a population of .

The municipality covers the entire Dordrecht Island, also often called &quot;Het Eiland van Dordt&quot; (&quot;the Island of Dordt&quot;), bordered by the rivers Oude Maas, Beneden Merwede, Nieuwe Merwede, Hollands Diep, and Dordtsche Kil. Dordrecht is the largest and most important city in the Drechtsteden and is also part of the Randstad, the main conurbation in the Netherlands.

Dordrecht is the oldest city in Holland and has a rich history and culture.

== Etymology ==
The name Dordrecht comes from &quot;Thuredriht&quot; (circa 1120), &quot;Thuredrecht&quot; (circa 1200). The name seems to mean &#x27;thoroughfare&#x27;; a ship-canal or river through which ships were pulled by rope from one river to another, as here between the Dubbel and the Merwede. Earlier etymologists had assumed that the &#x27;drecht&#x27; suffix came from Latin &#x27;trajectum&#x27;, a ford, but this was rejected in 1996. The Drecht is now supposed to have been derived from &quot;, which means to pull, tow or drag. Inhabitants of Dordrecht are &quot;Dordtenaren&quot; (singular: &quot;Dordtenaar&quot;).

Dordrecht is informally called &quot;Dordt&quot; by its inhabitants. In earlier centuries, Dordrecht was a major trading port and was called Dort in English.

== History ==
=== Early history ===
The city was formed along the Thure river, in the midst of peat marshes. This river was a branch of the river Dubbel, which is part of the massive Rhine–Meuse–Scheldt delta complex, near the current Bagijnhof. Around 1120 reference to Dordrecht was made by a remark that count Dirk IV of Holland was murdered in 1049 near &quot;Thuredrech&quot;.

Dordrecht was granted city rights by William I, Count of Holland, in 1220, making it the oldest city in the present province of South Holland. In fact, Geertruidenberg was the first city in the historical county of Holland to receive city rights, but this municipality currently is part of the province of North Brabant.

In the 12th and 13th centuries, Dordrecht developed into an important market city because of its strategic location. It traded primarily in wine, wood and cereals. Dordrecht was made even more important when it was given staple right in 1299.

In 1253 a Latin school was founded in Dordrecht. It still exists today as the and is the oldest gymnasium in the Netherlands. From 1600 to 1615 Gerhard Johann Vossius was rector at this school.

On 18–19 November 1421, the Saint Elisabeth&#x27;s flood flooded large parts of southern Holland, causing Dordrecht to become an island. It was commonly said that over 10,000 people died in the flood, but recent research indicates that it was probably fewer than 200 people.

On 29 June 1457, the city was devastated by a fire which started in Kleine Spuistraat, destroying many buildings, including the Grote Kerk.

=== Union of Dordrecht ===
In 1572, four years into the Dutch Revolt, representatives of all the cities of Holland, with the exception of Amsterdam, as well as the Watergeuzen, represented by William II de la Marck, gathered in Dordrecht to hold the &quot;Eerste Vrije Statenvergadering&quot; (&quot;First Assembly of the Free States&quot;), also known as the &quot;Unie van Dordrecht&quot; (&quot;Union of Dordrecht&quot;). This secret meeting, called by the city of Dordrecht, was a rebellious act since only King Philip II or his stadtholder, at that time the Duke of Alba, were allowed to call a meeting of the States of Holland.

During the meeting, the organization and financing of the rebellion against the Spanish occupation was discussed, Phillip II was unanimously denounced, and William of Orange was chosen as the rightful stadtholder and recognized as the official leader of the revolt. Orange, represented at the meeting by his assistant Philips of Marnix, was promised financial support of his struggle against the Spanish and at his own request, freedom of religion was declared in all of Holland.

The gathering is regarded as the first important step towards the free and independent Dutch Republic. Other important gatherings such as the Union of Brussels (1577) and the Union of Utrecht (1579) paved the way for official independence of the Dutch Republic, declared in the Act of Abjuration in 1581.

The Union of Dordrecht was held in an Augustinian monastery, nowadays simply called &quot;het Hof&quot; (&quot;the Court&quot;). The room in which the meeting was held is called &quot;de Statenzaal&quot; (&quot;The Hall of States&quot;) and features a stained glass window in which the coats of arms of the twelve cities that were present at the meeting can be seen.

=== Synod of Dordrecht ===


From 13 November 1618 to 9 May 1619, an important Dutch Reformed Church assembly took place in Dordrecht, referred to as the Synod of Dordrecht. The synod attempted, and succeeded, to settle the theological differences of opinion between the central tenets of Calvinism, and a new school of thought within the Dutch Reformed Church known as Arminianism, named for its spiritual leader Jacobus Arminius. Arminius&#x27; followers were also commonly known as Remonstrants, after the 1610 Five Articles of Remonstrance which outlined their points of dissent from the church&#x27;s official doctrine. They were opposed by the Contra-Remonstrants, or the Gomarists, who were led by Dutch theologian Franciscus Gomarus.

During the Twelve Years&#x27; Truce, this in essence purely theological conflict between different factions of the church had in practice spilled over into politics, dividing society along ideological lines, and threatening the existence of the young republic by repeatedly bringing it to the brink of civil war.

The synod was attended by Gomarist Dutch delegates and also by delegates from Reformed churches in Germany, Switzerland, and England. Though it was originally intended that the synod would bring agreement on the doctrine of predestination among all the Reformed churches, in practice this Dutch synod was mainly concerned with problems facing the Dutch Reformed Church.

The opening sessions dealt with a new Dutch translation of the Bible, a catechism, and the censorship of books. The synod then called upon representatives of the Remonstrants to express their beliefs. The Remonstrants refused to accept the rules established by the synod and eventually were expelled from the church.

The synod then studied the theology of the Remonstrants and declared that it was contrary to Scripture. The Canons of Dort were produced; they discussed in detail in five sections the errors of the Remonstrants that were rejected as well as the doctrines that were affirmed. The doctrines affirmed were that predestination is not conditional on belief; that Christ did not die for all; the total depravity of man; the irresistible grace of God; and the impossibility of falling from grace. These canons of Dort, along with the Belgic Confession and the Heidelberg Catechism, remain the theological basis of the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands.

Following the synod, two hundred Remonstrant ministers were deposed from their office, of which eighty were banished. The political leaders of the Remonstrant movement were arrested and one of them beheaded on May 14, 1619. It was only after the death of Prince Maurice in 1625 that the persecution of the Remonstrants ceased.

=== Diminishing economic importance ===
During the Eighty Years&#x27; War merchants from Dordrecht were involved in taking control and founding sugar cane plantations in the West Indies. At the end of the 17th century this led to a stable sugar refining industry in Dordrecht. This flourished in the 18th century, when Dordrecht had 16 sugar refineries, as opposed 120 in Amsterdam and 40 in Rotterdam. Dordrecht still has a few buildings purposely designed as a sugar refinery, e.g. the imposing Sugar Refinery Stokholm. 

Overall, the economic importance of Dordrecht began to wane in the 18th century, and Rotterdam became the main city in the region.

=== The Patriots movement ===
From 1780 to 1787, Dordrecht was home to the Patriots faction which intended to remove the hereditary Stadtholder position held by the House of Orange-Nassau.

The Netherlands was after all a republic &quot;de jure&quot;. Soon after, more cities followed and William V fled from Holland. But his brother-in-law, King Frederick William II of Prussia, came to the aid of William V and on 18 September 1787, Dordrecht capitulated to Prussian troops. The Patriots were defeated and Willem V was restored in his position as Stadtholder.

=== In the Kingdom of the Netherlands (1815–2023) ===
During the French period (1795–1813) Dordrecht continued to have a decent sea harbor and, for ocean-going ships, it was easier to reach than Rotterdam harbor. This changed in 1829, when the Voorne Canal was opened. Meanwhile, profits from the trade with the Dutch East Indies probably obscured the fact that Dordrecht was losing the maritime competition with Rotterdam. The end of Dordrecht as a first rate sea harbor came about when the Nieuwe Waterweg became fully usable in 1883. Compared to Dordrecht, Rotterdam sent about four times as much cargo up the Rhine to Germany in 1875. In 1895 this was 30 times as much and in 1910 about 200 times. In absolute numbers cargo from Dordrecht declined by more than 50%.

In the early 19th century, Dordrecht was a major center for shipbuilding. It was also a center of the Dutch timber market. As a smaller town, wages were lower than in Amsterdam and Rotterdam. It all made that many shipping lines that sailed to the East Indies for the Netherlands Trading Society (NTS) had their ships built in Dordrecht. Shipbuilders and shipping lines from Dordrecht profited disproportionally from the NTS policies. From about 1850 to 1876, the NTS gradually stopped its protection of Dutch shipping.

The traditional (cane) sugar refining industry of Dordrecht would not survive the industrial revolution. However, in 1861 Dordrecht Sugar Factory became operational as second modern beet sugar factory of the Netherlands.

Throughout the centuries, Dordrecht held a key position in the defense of Holland. It hosted an army division well into the 20th century. During the mobilization of August 1939, infantry and artillery were sent to Dordrecht to defend the island. When the Germans invaded the Netherlands on 10 May 1940, German paratroopers landed in Dordrecht. After fierce fighting they took the bridges Dordrecht-Moerdijk and Dordrecht-Zwijndrecht. Many buildings in Dordrecht were destroyed. Towards the end of the Second World War, during the winter of 1944–45, Dordrecht and its surroundings were in the middle between the opposing armies. The border between occupied and liberated regions ran along the Hollands Diep. Dordrecht was finally liberated by the Canadian Army.

In 1970, the municipality Dubbeldam (then ca. 10,000 inhabitants) and the southern part of the municipality of Sliedrecht were incorporated into Dordrecht, making Dordrecht Island one municipality.

== Districts ==
Dordrecht is divided into 27 districts, neighbourhoods and hamlets:

== Demography ==

In 2021, around 19,35% of the population of Dordrecht was of non-Western origin. Between 2005 and 2008, this number has not changed. The allochthonous population consists for a large part of young people while the indigenous population has started to age. Over six thousand Turks live in Dordrecht, many of whom are originally from Kayapınar.

According to the Social Geographical Office of Dordrecht, the population consisted of the following ethnic groups in 2005 and 2008:

== Culture ==
Due to its long and important role in Dutch history, Dordrecht has a rich culture. The medieval city centre is home to over 950 monuments. The city also houses 7 historic churches and 6 museums in a relatively small area and hosts many festivals and events every year.

=== Folklore ===

During Carnaval, Dordrecht is called &quot;Ooi- en Ramsgat&quot; (Ewe&#x27;s and Ram&#x27;s hole), and its inhabitants are &quot;Schapenkoppen&quot; (Sheepheads). This name originates from an old folk story. Import of meat or cattle was taxed in the 17th century. To avoid having to pay, two men dressed up a sheep they had bought outside the city walls, attempting to disguise it as a man. The sheep was discovered because it bleated as the three men (two men and one sheep) passed through the city wall gate. There is a special monument of a man and his son trying to hold a sheep disguised as a man between them, that refers to this legend. The logo of Dordrecht&#x27;s professional football club FC Dordrecht includes the head of a ram and its supporters are known to sing &quot;Wij zijn de Dordtse schapenkoppen&quot; (we are the Dordtse sheep heads) during matches. There is also a cookie called &quot;Schapenkop&quot; (sheep head) which is a speciality of Dordrecht.

There are many more legends about Dordrecht. One of them is about Saint Sura, a young woman who planned on building an entire church with only three coins in her purse. She was murdered because of her supposed wealth.

Another legend is about the house called &quot;de Onbeschaamde&quot; (the Unembarrassed). It is about the three brothers Van Beveren who each wanted to build a house and decided to make a bet on who would dare to place the most risqué statue on their façade. One of the brothers, Abraham van Beveren, placed a naked little boy on his façade. However, the house that supposedly won has an empty façade today because, according to the story, the statue was so risqué that it was removed.

A well known saying about Dordrecht is &quot;Hoe dichter bij Dordt, hoe rotter het wordt&quot; (the closer to Dordrecht, the more rotten it gets). The previous mayor Noorland added to that; &quot;maar ben je er eenmaal in, dan heb je het prima naar je zin&quot; (but once you&#x27;re in it, you&#x27;re perfectly content). The saying can probably be explained as follows; traffic used to go by water and whoever came close to Dordrecht was obliged, according to staple right, to display their merchandise for a couple of days before being allowed to sail on. This caused loss of time and caused products to become rotten. Another explanation is derived from &quot;Bommel is rommel, bij Tiel is niet viel en hoe dichter bij Dordt hoe rotter het wordt&quot; which is supposed to be said by farmers describing the bad quality of the land close to the rivers Maas and Waal, only suitable for harvesting reed.

=== Nature ===

The Sliedrechtse Biesbosch, east of Dordrecht, and the Dordtse Biesbosch, south of Dordrecht, together form the Hollandse Biesbosch which is a part of the national park the Biesbosch, one of the largest national parks in the Netherlands and one of the last freshwater tide areas in Europe. The Dordtse Biesbosch has several recreational areas that are used for walking, rowing and swimming.

There are also several parks near the city, such as Merwepark and Wantijpark.

=== Sports ===
The Riwal Hoogwerkers Stadion is a football stadium and home ground of the local team FC Dordrecht playing in the second national league.

=== Dordts ===
Dordts is a dialect of Dutch traditionally spoken by the working class of Dordrecht. It is categorized under the Hollandic accents but also has characteristics of Zeelandic and Brabantian.

Typical features of Dordts are:
*Using the diminutive suffix &quot;-ie&quot; or &quot;-tie&quot; in cases where standard Dutch uses &quot;-je&quot;. (e.g. Standard Dutch: (&quot;little apple&quot;) Dordts: )
*Words borrowed from Brabantian such as &quot;akkerdere&quot; (&quot;lit. to knock or to fit, fig. &quot;to get along&quot;)
*The Dutch diphthongs &quot;ei&quot; and &quot;ui&quot; tend to be pronounced more like &quot;èè&quot; and &quot;öö&quot;. Recently, the &quot;ei&quot;-sound has started to be pronounced more like &quot;ai&quot;.

In the 20th century, Dordts has slowly started to disappear as more and more people have started speaking standard Dutch. The strongest Dordts dialect is nowadays found in the working-class neighborhoods bordering the city centre.

=== Other ===
On 14 November 1992 and again on 12 November 2011, the official arrival of the popular legendary figure Sinterklaas was held in Dordrecht and broadcast on national television.

== Economy ==

The current economy of Dordrecht is based on ship building, wood industry, and steel industry. The city has the sixth largest sea port in the Netherlands. One of the largest employers on Dordrecht Island is DuPont de Nemours (Nederland) B.V. It has 9 factories here with a workforce of 900 people.

In development are the &quot;Learning&quot; and &quot;Health&quot; Business Parks. The Learning Park is intended to have of space for educational institutions. In the Health Park, a wide range of health services will be located, with the Dordwijk Campus of the Albert Schweitzer Hospital as focal point. Other services include a blood bank, pharmacy, and mental health clinic.

Near the Health Park a new Sport Park will be built. A new large sport centre, the equivalent size of 3 soccer fields, is planned complete with gyms, skating rink, and a pool. Next to this Sport Park, a huge outdoor event terrain will be established.

<text>COMMAND.COM is the default command-line interpreter for MS-DOS, Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows Me. In the case of DOS, it is the default user interface as well. It has an additional role as the usual first program run after boot (init process). As a shell, COMMAND.COM has two distinct modes of operation: interactive mode and batch mode. Internal commands are commands stored directly inside the COMMAND.COM binary; thus, they are always available, but can only be executed directly from the command interpreter.

== Description ==
COMMAND.COM&#x27;s successor on OS/2 and Windows NT systems is cmd.exe, although COMMAND.COM is available in virtual DOS machines on IA-32 versions of those operating systems as well. The filename was also used by (DCP), an MS-DOS derivative by the former East German VEB Robotron.

COMMAND.COM is a DOS program. Programs launched from COMMAND.COM are DOS programs that use the DOS API to communicate with the disk operating system. The compatible command processor under FreeDOS is sometimes also called FreeCom.

==Operating modes==
As a shell, COMMAND.COM has two distinct modes of operation. The first is interactive mode, in which the user types commands which are then executed immediately. The second is batch mode, which executes a predefined sequence of commands stored as a text file with the .BAT extension.

==Internal commands==
Internal commands are commands stored directly inside the COMMAND.COM binary. Thus, they are always available but can only be executed directly from the command interpreter.

All commands are executed after the key is pressed at the end of the line. COMMAND.COM is not case-sensitive, meaning commands can be typed in any mixture of upper and lower case.

; BREAK: Controls the handling of program interruption with or .
; CHCP: Displays or changes the current system code page.
; CHDIR, CD: Changes the current working directory or displays the current directory.
; CLS: Clears the screen.
; COPY: Copies one file to another (if the destination file already exists, MS-DOS asks whether to replace it). (See also XCOPY, an external command that could also copy directory trees).
; CTTY: Defines the device to use for input and output.
; DATE: Display and set the date of the system.
; DEL, ERASE: Deletes a file. When used on a directory, deletes all files inside the directory only. In comparison, the external command DELTREE deletes all subdirectories and files inside a directory as well as the directory itself.
; DIR: Lists the files in the specified directory.
; ECHO: Toggles whether text is displayed () or not (). Also displays text on the screen ().
; EXIT: Exits from COMMAND.COM and returns to the program which launched it.
; LFNFOR: Enables or disables the return of long filenames by the FOR command. (Windows 9x).
; LOADHIGH, LH: Loads a program into upper memory ( in DR DOS).
; LOCK: Enables external programs to perform low-level disk access to a volume. (MS-DOS 7.1 and Windows 9x only)
; MKDIR, MD: Creates a new directory.
; PATH: Displays or changes the value of the PATH environment variable which controls the places where COMMAND.COM will search for executable files.
; PROMPT: Displays or change the value of the PROMPT environment variable which controls the appearance of the prompt.
; RENAME, REN: Renames a file or directory.
; RMDIR, RD: Removes an empty directory.
; SET: Sets the value of an environment variable; without arguments, shows all defined environment variables.
; TIME: Display and set the time of the system.
; TRUENAME: Display the fully expanded physical name of a file, resolving ASSIGN, JOIN and SUBST logical filesystem mappings.
; TYPE: Display the content of a file on the console.
; UNLOCK: Disables low-level disk access. (MS-DOS 7.1 and Windows 9x only)
; VER: Displays the version of the operating system.
; VERIFY: Enable or disable verification of writing for files.
; VOL:Shows information about a volume.

=== Batch file commands ===
Control structures are mostly used inside batch files, although they can also be used interactively.

; :&quot;label&quot;: Defines a target for GOTO.
; CALL: Executes another batch file and returns to the old one and continues.
; FOR: Iteration: repeats a command for each out of a specified set of files.
; GOTO: Moves execution to a specified label. Labels are specified at the beginning of a line, with a colon ().
; IF: Conditional statement, allows branching of the program execution.
; PAUSE: Halts execution of the program and displays a message asking the user to press any key to continue.
; REM: comment: any text following this command is ignored.
; SHIFT: Replaces each of the replacement parameters with the subsequent one (e.g. with , with , etc.).

==== IF command ====
On exit, all external commands submit a return code (a value between 0 and 255) to the calling program. Most programs have a certain convention for their return codes (for instance, 0 for a successful execution).

If a program was invoked by COMMAND.COM, the internal IF command with its ERRORLEVEL conditional can be used to test on error conditions of the last invoked external program.

Under COMMAND.COM, internal commands do not establish a new value.

==Variables==
Batch files for COMMAND.COM can have four kinds of variables:
* Environment variables: These have the form and are associated with values with the SET statement. Before DOS 3 COMMAND.COM will only expand environment variables in batch mode; that is, not interactively at the command prompt.
* Replacement parameters: These have the form , ..., and initially contain the command name and the first nine command-line parameters passed to the script (e.g., if the invoking command was , then is &quot;myscript.bat&quot;, is &quot;John&quot; and is &quot;Doe&quot;). The parameters to the right of the ninth can be mapped into range by using the SHIFT statement.
* Loop variables: Used in loops, they have the format when run in batch files. These variables are defined solely within a specific FOR statement, and iterate over a certain set of values defined in that FOR statement.
* Under Novell DOS 7, OpenDOS 7.01, DR-DOS 7.02 and higher, COMMAND.COM also supports a number of system information variables, a feature earlier found in 4DOS 3.00 and higher as well as in Multiuser DOS, although most of the supported variable names differ.

==Redirection, piping, and chaining==
Because DOS is a single-tasking operating system, piping is achieved by running commands sequentially, redirecting to and from a temporary file. COMMAND.COM makes no provision for redirecting the standard error channel.

; codice_1 : Redirect standard input from a file or device
; codice_2 : Redirect standard output, overwriting target file if it exists.
; codice_3 : Redirect standard output, appending to target file if it exists.
; codice_4 : Pipe standard output from &quot;command1&quot; to standard input of &quot;command2&quot;
; codice_5 :
: Commands separated by ASCII-20 (¶, invoked by ) are executed in sequence (chaining of commands). In other words, first &quot;command1&quot; is executed until termination, then &quot;command2&quot;. This is an undocumented feature in COMMAND.COM of MS-DOS/PC DOS 5.0 and higher. It is also supported by COMMAND.COM of the Windows NT family as well as by DR-DOS 7.07. All versions of DR-DOS COMMAND.COM already supported a similar internal function utilizing an exclamation mark (!) instead (a feature originally derived from Concurrent DOS and Multiuser DOS) - in the single-user line this feature was only available internally (in built-in startup scripts like &quot;!DATE!TIME&quot;) and indirectly through DOSKEY&#x27;s $T parameter to avoid problems with ! as a valid filename character. 4DOS supports a configurable command line separator (4DOS.INI CommandSep= or SETDOS /C), which defaults to ^. COMMAND.COM in newer versions of Windows NT also supports an separator for compatibility with the cmd syntax in OS/2 and the Windows NT family. (cmd does not support the ¶ separator.)

==Limitations==
Generally, the command line length in interactive mode is limited to 126 characters. In MS-DOS 6.22, the command line length in interactive mode is limited to 127 characters.

==In popular culture==

* The message &quot;Loading COMMAND.COM&quot; can be seen on a HUD view of the Terminator and the internal viewport of RoboCop when he reboots.
* In the animated children&#x27;s TV series &quot;ReBoot&quot;, which takes place inside computers, the leader of a system (the equivalent of a city) is called the COMMAND.COM.

<text>The Speech to the Troops at Tilbury was delivered on 9 August Old Style (19 August New Style) 1588 by Queen Elizabeth I of England to the land forces earlier assembled at Tilbury in Essex in preparation for repelling the expected invasion by the Spanish Armada.

Before the speech the Armada had been driven from the Strait of Dover in the Battle of Gravelines eleven days earlier, and had by then rounded Scotland on its way home, but troops were still held at ready in case the Spanish army of Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma, might yet attempt to invade from Dunkirk; two days later they were discharged. On the day of the speech, the Queen left her bodyguard before Tilbury Fort and went among her subjects with an escort of six men. Lord Ormonde walked ahead with the Sword of State; he was followed by a page leading the Queen&#x27;s charger and another bearing her silver helmet on a cushion; then came the Queen herself, in white with a silver cuirass and mounted on a grey gelding. She was flanked on horseback by her lieutenant general the Earl of Leicester on the right, and on the left by the Earl of Essex, her Master of the Horse. Sir John Norreys brought up the rear.

== First version ==
The version that is most widely considered to be authentic was found in a letter from Leonel Sharp to the Duke of Buckingham. Sharp had been attached to the Earl of Leicester at Tilbury during the threatened invasion of the Armada and he later became chaplain to Buckingham. Sharp wrote: &quot;The queen the next morning rode through all the squadrons of her army as armed Pallas attended by noble footmen, Leicester, Essex, and Norris, then lord marshal, and divers other great lords. Where she made an excellent oration to her army, which the next day after her departure, I was commanded to redeliver all the army together, to keep a public fast&quot;. He also claimed: &quot;No man hath it but myself, and such as I have given it to&quot;. It was published in 1654 in a collection titled &quot;Cabala, Mysteries of State&quot;. (pp.372-374) A late sixteenth- or early seventeenth-century copy of this speech (with minor variants to the published version) exists in the Harleian Collection of the British Library.

===Authenticity===
The speech&#x27;s veracity was accepted by the historian J. E. Neale in an article, &#x27;The Sayings of Queen Elizabeth&#x27;: &quot;I see no serious reason for rejecting the speech. ... some of the phrases have every appearance of being the Queen&#x27;s, and the whole tone of the speech is surely very much in keeping even with the few Elizabethan quotations that I have had room for in this article. ... I have little doubt that Sharp&#x27;s version is a copy, at two or three removes, of a speech actually written by Elizabeth herself&quot;. The speech has been accepted as genuine by the historians Mandell Creighton, Garrett Mattingly, Patrick Collinson (&quot;...there is no reason to doubt its authenticity&quot;), Wallace T. MacCaffrey, Lady Anne Somerset, Antonia Fraser, Alison Weir, Christopher Haigh, Simon Schama, David Starkey and Robert Hutchinson.

Janet M. Green of Kent State University in an article for the &quot;Sixteenth Century Journal&quot; in 1997 states that &quot;substantial evidence exists for believing the Tilbury oration is genuine, which falls into three categories: First, internal rhetorical characteristics link this oration very strongly to Elizabeth&#x27;s others. Second, there is considerable contemporary evidence that she delivered a speech at Tilbury whose phrases, often remarked, were like those of the speech we have... The internal evidence of the Tilbury oration provides the best argument for Elizabeth&#x27;s authorship&quot;.

David Loades has written: &quot;Whether she used these words, we do not know, although they have an authentic, theatrical ring&quot;.

However, there are some historians who question its authenticity, such as Miller Christy, in 1919. Also sceptical were Felix Barker and Susan Frye.

==Physical appearance at Tilbury==
Elizabeth&#x27;s physical appearance was vital to the historical event and just at least as important as the actual speech. Dozens of descriptions of Elizabeth on that day exist, with slightly differing details. Similarities between descriptions indicate that she at least wore a plumed helmet and a steel cuirass over a white velvet gown. She held a gold and silver truncheon, or baton, in her hand as she rode atop a white steed. As quoted in J. E. Neale&#x27;s &quot;Elizabeth&quot;, her demeanour was &quot;full of princely resolution and more than feminine courage&quot; and that &quot;she passed like some Amazonian empress through all her army&quot;. That striking image is reminiscent of several literary and mythological figures. One of those is Pallas Athena, the Greek goddess of war, who was often classically portrayed as wearing a helmet and armour. Another figure that Elizabeth represented during this speech was Britomart, originally a Greek nymph and more recently the allegorical heroine in Edmund Spenser&#x27;s epic &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;. The etymology of the name &quot;Britomart&quot; seems to suggest British military power. Spenser deliberately wrote the character to represent Queen Elizabeth I and so in essence, they are the same. Her subjects would have been familiar with both Athena and Britomart, and Elizabeth&#x27;s adoption of their personas would have been fairly recognisable. Besides representing the figures, by wearing armour, Elizabeth implied that she was ready to fight for and alongside her people. However, as Garrett Mattingly put it:
==Speech==
After she had made her rounds through the troops, Elizabeth delivered her speech to them. Leonel Sharp&#x27;s version is accepted as the speech that she gave, and it best captures her rhetorical strategies as opposed to the versions of William Leigh and James Aske. In the past, Elizabeth had defied gender expectations by refusing to marry or produce heirs, instead opting to rule alone, with God and England as her soul mates. Elizabeth practically claims that she is both King and Queen of England in the most famous line of the address, &quot;I have the body of a weak, feeble woman; but I have the heart and stomach of a king, and of a King of England too.&quot; At the same time that she claims the power, she acknowledges her physical weakness and condescends to the level of soldiers and subjects to whom she lovingly refers in the speech.
Elizabeth calls upon God in the speech and asserts confidence in her own faith and the salvation of herself and her people, thereby placing Spain and the Pope as the ones in the wrong, calling them &quot;tyrants&quot; and &quot;enemies&quot; of both Elizabeth and England.

If the speech is accepted as the true speech given at Tilbury, it is worth noting that Elizabeth wrote it herself. As a writer, she wrote many of her own speeches, as well as poems.

==Second version==
Another version of the speech was recorded in 1612 by William Leigh. His version reads:

==Third version==
In &quot;Elizabetha Triumphans&quot;, published in 1588, James Aske provides a version of the speech, reworked in verse:

==Summary==

A summary of the speech appears in Lewes Lewkenor&#x27;s &quot;The Estate of English Fugitives&quot; written in 1595, which mentions the Spanish Armada.

Lewkenor says,

==In popular culture==
Reports of the queen&#x27;s visit to Tilbury circulated rapidly in the popular media of the day. On 10 August, one day after the speech, a broadside ballad describing the events was registered by the printer John Wolfe in the Stationer&#x27;s Register of London. The ballad, written by Thomas Deloney, one of the most popular poets of the day, corresponds fairly closely to John Aske&#x27;s description of the events in &quot;Elizabetha Triumphans&quot;. A second ballad on the same subject, likewise printed by Wolfe, also survives.

Parts of the speech were quoted in the television series &quot;Elizabeth R&quot; (1971), &quot;The Virgin Queen&quot; (2005) and &quot;Elizabeth I&quot; (2005), as well at the films &quot;Fire Over England&quot; (1937) and &quot;&quot; (2007).

<text>Domenico Maria Novara (1454–1504) was an Italian scientist.

==Life==
Born in Ferrara, for 21 years he was professor of astronomy at the University of Bologna, and in 1500 he also lectured in mathematics at Rome. He was notable as a Platonist astronomer, and in 1496 he taught Nicolaus Copernicus astronomy. He was also an astrologer.

At Bologna, Novara was assisted by Copernicus, with whom he observed a lunar occultation of Aldebaran. Copernicus later used this observation to disprove Ptolemy&#x27;s model of lunar distance.

Copernicus had started out as Novara&#x27;s student and then became his assistant and co-worker. Novara in turn declared that his teacher had been the famous astronomer Regiomontanus, who was once a pupil of Georg Purbach. Novara was initially educated at the University of Florence, at the time a major center of Neoplatonism. He studied there under Luca Pacioli, a friend of Leonardo da Vinci.

Novara&#x27;s writings are largely lost, except for a few astrological almanacs written for the university. But Copernicus&#x27;s De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (published in 1543, long after Novara&#x27;s death) records that on 9 March 1497 Novara witnessed Copernicus first observation. Both men were described as &quot;free minds and free souls,&quot; and Novara believed that his findings would have shaken Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;unshakable&quot; geocentric system.

Novara died in 1504 in Bologna.

<doc id="71234" wikidata="Q39338" url="?curid=71234" title="Orange (colour)">
<text>Orange is the colour between yellow and red on the spectrum of visible light. The human eyes perceive orange when observing light with a dominant wavelength between roughly 585 and 620 nanometres. In traditional colour theory, it is a secondary colour of pigments, produced by mixing yellow and red. In the RGB colour model, it is a tertiary colour. It is named after the fruit of the same name.

The orange colour of many fruits and vegetables, such as carrots, pumpkins, sweet potatoes, and oranges, comes from carotenes, a type of photosynthetic pigment. These pigments convert the light energy that the plants absorb from the Sun into chemical energy for the plants&#x27; growth. Similarly, the hues of autumn leaves are from the same pigment after chlorophyll is removed.

In Europe and the United States, surveys show that orange is the colour most associated with amusement, the unconventional, extroversion, warmth, fire, energy, activity, danger, taste and aroma, the autumn and Allhallowtide seasons, as well as having long been the national colour of the Netherlands and the House of Orange. It also serves as the political colour of the Christian democracy political ideology and most Christian democratic political parties. In Asia, it is an important symbolic colour in Buddhism and Hinduism.

==In nature and culture==
==Etymology==
In English, the colour orange is named after the appearance of the ripe orange fruit. The word comes from the , from the old term for the fruit, . The French word, in turn, comes from the Italian , based on Arabic (), borrowed from Persian (), derived from Sanskrit (), which in turn derives from a Dravidian root word (compare / &quot;/&quot; which refers to bitter orange in Tamil and Malayalam). The earliest known recorded use of &quot;orange&quot; as a colour name in English was in 1502, in a description of clothing purchased for Margaret Tudor. Another early recorded use was in 1512, in a will now filed with the Public Record Office. By the 17th century, the fruit and its colour were familiar enough that &#x27;orange-coloured&#x27; shifted in use to &#x27;orange&#x27; as an adjective. The place name &quot;Orange&quot; has a separate etymology and is not related to that of the colour.

Before this word was introduced to the English-speaking world, &quot;saffron&quot; already existed in the English language. &quot;Crog&quot; also referred to the saffron colour, so that orange was also referred to as (&quot;yellow-red&quot;) for reddish orange, or (&quot;yellow-saffron&quot;) for yellowish orange. Alternatively, orange things were sometimes described as red (which then had a broader meaning) such as red deer, red hair, the Red Planet and robin redbreast. When orange was infrequently used in heraldry, it was referred to as &quot;tawny&quot; or &quot;brusk&quot;.

==History and art==
In ancient Egypt, and ancient India, artists used an orange colour on some of their items. In Egypt, a mineral pigment called realgar was used for tomb paintings, as well as for other purposes. Orange carnelians were significantly used during the Indus Valley Civilisation which was, in turn, obtained by the people of Kutch, Gujarat, India. The colour was also used later by medieval artists for the colouring of manuscripts. Pigments were also made in ancient times from a mineral known as orpiment. Orpiment was an important item of trade in the Roman Empire and was used as a medicine in ancient China although it contains arsenic and is highly toxic. It was also used as a fly poison and to poison arrows. Because of its yellow-orange colour, it was also a favourite with alchemists who were searching for a way to make gold, both in China and in the West.

Before the late 15th century, the colour orange existed in Europe, but without the name; it was simply called yellow-red. Portuguese merchants brought the first orange trees to Europe from Asia in the late 15th and early 16th century, along with the Sanskrit word , which gradually became part of several European languages: in Spanish, in Portuguese, and &quot;orange&quot; in English &amp; French. In mid-16th century England, the colour referred to as &#x27;orange&#x27; was a reddish-brown, matching the deteriorated appearance of the fruit after a long journey from where it was grown in Portugal or |Spain Improvements in transportation and the introduction of an orange grove in Surrey allowed the fresh fruit to become more familiar in England, and the colour referred to as &quot;orange&quot; shifted in the 17th century toward its modern understanding.

===House of Orange===
The House of Orange-Nassau was one of the most influential royal houses in Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries. It originated in 1163 in the tiny Principality of Orange, a feudal state of north of Avignon in southern France. The Principality of Orange took its name not from the fruit, but from a Roman-Celtic settlement on the site which was founded in 36 or 35 BC and was named after the Celtic water god Arausio; however, the name may have been slightly altered, and the town associated with the colour, because it was on the route by which quantities of oranges were brought from southern ports such as Marseille to northern France.

The family of the Prince of Orange eventually adopted the name and the colour orange in the 1570s. The colour came to be associated with Protestantism, due to participation by the House of Orange on the Protestant side in the French Wars of Religion. One member of the house, William I of Orange, organised the Eighty Years&#x27; War comprising resistance against Spain, a war that lasted eighty years, until the Netherlands won its independence. The House&#x27;s arguably most prominent member, William III of Orange, became King of England in 1689, after the downfall of the Catholic James II in the Glorious Revolution.

Due to William III, orange became an important political colour in Britain and Europe. William was a Protestant, and as such, he defended the Protestant minority of Ireland against the majority Roman Catholic population. As a result, the Protestants of Ireland were known as Orangemen. Orange eventually became one of the colours of the Irish flag, symbolising the Protestant heritage. His orange-white-and-blue rebel flag became the forerunner of The Netherlands&#x27; modern flag.

When the Dutch settlers living in the Cape Colony (now part of South Africa) migrated into the Southern African heartlands in the 19th century, they founded what they called the Orange Free State. In the United States, the flag of New York City has an orange stripe, to remember the Dutch colonists who founded the city. William of Orange is also remembered as the founder of the College of William &amp; Mary, and Nassau County, New York is named after the House of Orange-Nassau.

===18th and 19th century===
In the 18th century, orange was sometimes used to depict the robes of Pomona, the goddess of fruitful abundance; her name came from the , the Latin word for fruit. Oranges themselves became more common in northern Europe, thanks to the 17th-century invention of the heated greenhouse, a building type which became known as an orangerie. The French artist Jean-Honoré Fragonard depicted an allegorical figure of inspiration dressed in orange.

In 1797 a French scientist Louis Vauquelin discovered the mineral crocoite, or lead chromate, which led in 1809 to the invention of the synthetic pigment chrome orange. Other synthetic pigments, cobalt red, cobalt yellow, and cobalt orange, the last made from cadmium sulfide plus cadmium selenide, soon followed. These new pigments, plus the invention of the metal paint tube in 1841, made it possible for artists to paint outdoors and to capture the colours of natural light.

In Britain, orange became highly popular with the Pre-Raphaelites and with history painters. The flowing red-orange hair of Elizabeth Siddal, a prolific model and the wife of painter Dante Gabriel Rossetti, became a symbol of the Pre-Raphaelite movement. Lord Leighton, the president of the Royal Academy, produced &quot;Flaming June&quot;, a painting of a sleeping young woman in a bright orange dress, which won wide acclaim. Albert Joseph Moore painted festive scenes of Romans wearing orange cloaks brighter than any of the Romans ever likely wore. In the United States, Winslow Homer brightened his palette with vivid oranges.

In France, painters took orange in an entirely different direction. In 1872 Claude Monet painted &quot;Impression, Sunrise&quot;, a tiny orange sun and some orange light reflected on the clouds and water in the centre of a hazy blue landscape. This painting gave its name to the Impressionist movement.

Orange became an important colour for all the Impressionist painters. They all had studied the recent books on colour theory, and they know that orange placed next to azure blue made both colours much brighter. Auguste Renoir painted boats with stripes of chrome orange paint straight from the tube. Paul Cézanne did not use orange pigment, but produced his own oranges with touches of yellow, red and ochre against a blue background. Toulouse-Lautrec often used oranges in the skirts of dancers and gowns of Parisiennes in the cafes and clubs he portrayed. For him, it was the colour of festivity and amusement.

The Post-Impressionists went even further with orange. Paul Gauguin used oranges as backgrounds, for clothing and skin colour, to fill his pictures with light and exoticism. But no other painter used orange so often and dramatically as Vincent van Gogh. who had shared a house with Gauguin in Arles for a time. For Van Gogh orange and yellow were the pure sunlight of Provence. He produced his own oranges with mixtures of yellow, ochre and red, and placed them next to slashes of sienna red and bottle green, and below a sky of turbulent blue and violet. He put an orange moon and stars in a cobalt blue sky. He wrote to his brother Theo of searching for oppositions of blue with orange, of red with green, of yellow with violet, searching for broken colours and neutral colours to harmonize the brutality of extremes, trying to make the colours intense, and not a harmony of greys.

===20th and 21st centuries===
In the 20th and 21st centuries, the colour orange had highly varied associations, both positive and negative.

The high visibility of orange made it a popular colour for certain kinds of clothing and equipment. During World War II, US Navy pilots in the Pacific began to wear orange inflatable life jackets, which could be spotted by search and rescue planes. After the war, these jackets became common on both civilian and naval vessels of all sizes, and on aircraft flown over water. Orange is also widely worn (to avoid being hit) by workers on highways and by cyclists.

A herbicide called Agent Orange was widely sprayed from aircraft by the Royal Air Force during the Malayan Emergency and the US Air Force during the Vietnam War to remove the forest and jungle cover beneath which enemy combatants were believed to be hiding, and to expose their supply routes. The chemical was not actually orange, but took its name from the colour of the steel drums in which it was stored. Agent Orange was toxic, and was later linked to birth defects and other health problems.

Orange also had and continues to have a political dimension. Orange serves as the colour of Christian democratic political ideology, which is based on Catholic social teaching and Neo-Calvinist theology; Christian democratic political parties came to prominence in Europe and the Americas after World War II.
In Ukraine in November–December 2004, it became the colour of the Orange Revolution, a popular movement which carried activist and reformer Viktor Yushchenko into the presidency. In parts of the world, especially Northern Ireland, the colour is associated with the Orange Order, a Protestant fraternal organisation and relatedly, Orangemen, marches and other social and political activities, with the colour orange being associated with Protestantism similar to the Netherlands.

==Science==
===Optics===

In optics, orange is the colour seen by the eye when looking at light with a wavelength between approximately 585–620nm. It has a hue of 30° in HSV colour space. Isaac Newton&#x27;s &quot;Opticks&quot; distinguished between pure orange light and mixtures of red and yellow light by noting that mixtures could be separated using a prism.

In the traditional colour wheel used by painters, orange is the range of colours between red and yellow, and painters can obtain orange simply by mixing red and yellow in various proportions; however these colours are never as vivid as a pure orange pigment. In the RGB colour model (the system used to display colours on a television or computer screen), orange is generated by combining high intensity red light with a lower intensity green light, with the blue light turned off entirely. Orange is a tertiary colour which is numerically halfway between gamma-compressed red and yellow, as can be seen in the RGB colour wheel.

Regarding painting, blue is the complementary colour to orange. As many painters of the 19th century discovered, blue and orange reinforce each other. The painter Vincent van Gogh wrote to his brother Theo that in his paintings, he was trying to reveal &quot;the oppositions of blue with orange, of red with green, of yellow with violet... trying to make the colours intense and not a harmony of grey&quot;. In another letter he wrote simply, &quot;There is no orange without blue.&quot; Van Gogh, Pierre-Auguste Renoir and many other Impressionist and Post-Impressionist painters frequently placed orange against azure or cobalt blue, to make both colours appear brighter.

The actual complement of orange is azure – a colour that is one quarter of the way between blue and green on the colour spectrum. The actual complementary colour of true blue is yellow. Orange pigments are largely in the ochre or cadmium families, and absorb mostly greenish-blue light.

===Pigments and dyes===
Other orange pigments include:
*Minium and massicot are bright yellow and orange pigments made since ancient times by heating lead oxide and its variants. Minium was used in the Byzantine Empire for making the red-orange colour on illuminated manuscripts, while massicot was used by ancient Egyptian scribes and in the Middle Ages. Both substances are toxic, and were replaced in the beginning of the 20th century by chrome orange and cadmium orange.
*Cadmium orange is a synthetic pigment made from cadmium sulphide. It is a by-product of mining for zinc, but also occurs rarely in nature in the mineral greenockite. It is usually made by replacing some of the sulphur with selenium, which results in an expensive but deep and lasting colour. Selenium was discovered in 1817, but the pigment was not made commercially until 1910.
*Quinacridone orange is a synthetic organic pigment first identified in 1896 and manufactured in 1935. It makes a vivid and solid orange.
*Diketopyrrolopyrrole orange or DPP orange is a synthetic organic pigment first commercialised in 1986. It is sold under various commercial names, such as translucent orange. It makes an extremely bright and lasting orange, and is widely used to colour plastics and fibres, as well as in paints.

===Orange natural objects===
The orange colour of carrots, pumpkins, sweet potatoes, oranges, and many other fruits and vegetables comes from carotenes, a type of photosynthetic pigment. These pigments convert the light energy that the plants absorb from the sun into chemical energy for the plants&#x27; growth. The carotenes themselves take their name from the carrot. Autumn leaves also get their orange colour from carotenes. When the weather turns cold and production of green chlorophyll stops, the orange colour remains.

Before the 18th century, carrots from Asia were usually purple, while those in Europe were either white or red. Dutch farmers bred a variety that was orange; according to some sources, as a tribute to the stadtholder of Holland and Zeeland, William of Orange. The long orange Dutch carrot, first described in 1721, is the ancestor of the orange horn carrot, one of the most common types found in supermarkets today. It takes its name from the town of Hoorn, in the Netherlands.

===Flowers===
Orange is traditionally associated with the autumn season, with the harvest and autumn leaves. The flowers, like orange fruits and vegetables and autumn leaves, get their colour from the photosynthetic pigments called carotenes.
===Animals===
===Foods===
Orange is a very common colour of fruits, vegetables, spices, and other foods in many different cultures. As a result, orange is the colour most often associated in western culture with taste and aroma. Orange foods include peaches, apricots, mangoes, carrots, shrimp, salmon roe, and many other foods. Orange colour is provided by spices such as paprika, saffron and curry powder. In the United States, with Halloween on 31 October, and in North America with Thanksgiving in October (Canada) and November (US) orange is associated with the harvest colour, and also is the colour of the carved pumpkins, or jack-o-lanterns, used to celebrate the holiday.

===Food colourings===

People associate certain colours with certain flavours, and the colour of food can influence the perceived flavour in anything from candy to wine. Since orange is popularly associated with good flavour, many companies add orange food colouring to improve the appearance of their packaged foods. Orange pigments and dyes, synthetic or natural, are added to many orange sodas and juices, cheeses (particularly cheddar cheese, Gloucester cheese, and American cheese); snack foods, butter and margarine; breakfast cereals, ice cream, yoghurt, jam and candy. It is also often added to children&#x27;s medicine, and to chicken feed to make the egg yolks more orange.

The United States Government and the European Union certify a small number of synthetic chemical colourings to be used in food. These are usually aromatic hydrocarbons, or azo dyes, made from petroleum. The most common ones are:
*Allura red AC, also known as Red 40 and E129.
*Sunset Yellow FCF, also known as Yellow 6 and E110.
*Tartrazine, also known as Yellow 5 and E102. A dye used in soft drinks such as Mountain Dew, Kool-Aid, chewing gum, popcorn, breakfast cereals, cosmetics, shampoos, eyeshadow, blush, and lipstick.
*Orange B is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, but only for hot dog and sausage casings.
*Citrus Red 2 is certified only to colour orange peels.
Because many consumers are worried about possible health consequences of synthetic dyes, some companies are beginning to use natural food colours. Since these food colours are natural, they do not require any certification from the Food and Drug Administration. The most popular natural food colours are:
*Annatto, made from the seeds of the achiote tree. Annatto contains carotenoids, the same ingredient that gives carrots and other vegetables their orange colour. Annatto has been used to dye certain cheeses in Britain, particularly Gloucester cheese, since the 16th century. It is now commonly used to colour American cheese, snack foods, breakfast cereal, butter, and margarine. It is used as a body paint by native populations in Central and South America. In India, women often put it, under the name &quot;sindūra&quot;, on their hairline to indicate that they are married.
*Turmeric is a common spice in the Indian subcontinent, Persia and the Mideast. It contains the pigments called curcuminoids, widely used as a dye for the robes of Buddhist monks. It is also often used in curry powders and to give flavour to mustard. It is now being used more frequently in Europe and the US to give an orange colour to canned beverages, ice cream, yogurt, popcorn and breakfast cereal. The food colour is usually listed as E100.
*Paprika oleoresin contains natural carotenoids, and is made from chili peppers. It is used to colour cheese, orange juice, spice mixtures and packaged sauces. It is also fed to chickens to make their egg yolks more orange.

==Culture, associations and symbolism==
===Confucianism===

In Confucianism, the religion and philosophy of ancient China, orange was the colour of transformation. In China and India, the colour took its name not from the orange fruit, but from saffron, the finest and most expensive dye in Asia. According to Confucianism, existence was governed by the interaction of the male active principle, the &quot;yang&quot;, and the female passive principle, the &quot;yin&quot;. Yellow was the colour of perfection and nobility; red was the colour of happiness and power. Yellow and red were compared to light and fire, spirituality and sensuality, seemingly opposite but really complementary. Out of the interaction between the two came orange, the colour of transformation.

===Hinduism and Buddhism===
A wide variety of colours, ranging from a slightly orange yellow to a deep orange red, all simply called saffron, are closely associated with Hinduism and Buddhism, and are commonly worn by monks and holy men across Asia.

In Hinduism, the divinity Krishna is commonly portrayed dressed in yellow or yellow orange. Yellow and saffron are also the colours worn by sadhu, or wandering pious men in India.

In Buddhism, orange (or more precisely saffron) was the colour of illumination, the highest state of perfection. The saffron colours of robes to be worn by monks were defined by the Buddhist texts. The robe and its colour is a sign of renunciation of the outside world and commitment to the order. The candidate monk, with his master, first appears before the monks of the monastery in his own clothes, with his new robe under his arm and asks to enter the order. He then takes his vows, puts on the robes, and with his begging bowl, goes out to the world. Thereafter, he spends his mornings begging and his afternoons in contemplation and study, either in a forest, garden, or in the monastery.

According to Buddhist scriptures and commentaries, the robe dye is allowed to be obtained from six kinds of substances: roots and tubers, plants, bark, leaves, flowers and fruits. The robes should also be boiled in water for a long time to get the correctly sober colour. Saffron and ochre, usually made with dye from the curcuma longa plant or the heartwood of the jackfruit tree, are the most common colours. The so-called forest monks usually wear ochre robes and city monks saffron, though this is not an official rule.

The colour of robes also varies somewhat among the different &quot;vehicles&quot; (schools) of Buddhism, and by country, depending on their doctrines and the dyes available. The monks of the strict Vajrayana, or Tantric Buddhism, practised in Tibet, wear the most colourful robes of saffron and red. The monks of Mahayana Buddhism, practised mainly in Japan, China and Korea, wear lighter yellow or saffron, often with white or black. Monks of Theravada Buddhism, practised in Southeast Asia, usually wear ochre or saffron colour. Monks of the forest tradition in Thailand and other parts of Southeast Asia wear robes of a brownish ochre, dyed from the wood of the jackfruit tree.
===Colour of amusement===
In Europe and America orange and yellow are the colours most associated with amusement, frivolity and entertainment. In this regard, orange is the exact opposite of its complementary colour, blue, the colour of calm and reflection. Mythological paintings traditionally showed Bacchus (known in Greek mythology as Dionysus), the god of wine, ritual madness and ecstasy, dressed in orange. Clowns have long worn orange wigs. Toulouse-Lautrec used a palette of yellow, black and orange in his posters of Paris cafes and theatres, and Henri Matisse used an orange, yellow and red palette in his painting, the &quot;Joy of Living&quot;. 
===Colour of visibility and warning===
Orange is the colour most easily seen in dim light or against the water, making it, particularly the shade known as safety orange, the colour of choice for life rafts, life jackets or buoys. Highway temporary signs about construction or detours in the United States are orange, because of its visibility and its association with danger.

It is worn by people wanting to be seen, including highway workers and lifeguards. Prisoners are also sometimes dressed in orange clothing to make them easier to see during an escape. Lifeguards on the beaches of Los Angeles County, both real and in television series, wear orange swimsuits to make them stand out. Orange astronaut suits have the highest visibility in space, or against blue sea. An aircraft&#x27;s two types of &quot;black box&quot;, or flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder, are actually bright orange, so they can be found more easily. In some cars, connectors related to safety systems, such as the airbag, may be coloured orange.

The Golden Gate Bridge at the entrance of San Francisco Bay is painted international orange to make it more visible in the fog. Next to red, it is the colour most popular for extroverts, and as a symbol of activity.

Orange is sometimes used, like red and yellow, as a colour warning of possible danger or calling for caution. A skull against an orange background means a toxic substance or poison.

In the colour system devised by the US Department of Homeland Security to measure the threat of terrorist attack, an orange level is second only to a red level. The US Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices specifies orange for use in temporary and construction signage.

===Military===
In the United States Army, orange has traditionally been associated with the dragoons, the mounted infantry units which eventually became the US Cavalry. The 1st Cavalry Regiment was founded in 1833 as the United States Dragoons. The modern coat of arms of the 1st Cavalry features the colour orange and orange-yellow shade called dragoon yellow, the colours of the early US dragoon regiments.
The US Signal Corps, founded at the beginning of the American Civil War, adopted orange and white as its official colours in 1872. Orange was adopted because it was the colour of a signal fire, historically used at night while smoke was used during the day, to communicate with distant army units.
Prior to and during the Napoleonic Wars a pale shade of orange known as &quot;aurore&quot; (&quot;dawn&quot;) was adopted as the facing colour of several cavalry regiments in the French army. The colour resembled that of the early rising sun.

In the Royal Netherlands Air Force, aircraft may have a roundel with an orange dot in the middle, surrounded by three circular sectors in red, white, and blue.

In the Indonesian Air Force, the Air force infantry and special forces corps known as Paskhas uses Orange as their beret colour.

<text>The Lewis chessmen ( ) or Uig chessmen, named after the island or the bay where they were found, are a group of distinctive 12th-century chess pieces, along with other game pieces, most of which are carved from walrus ivory. Discovered in 1831 on Lewis in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland, they may constitute some of the few complete, surviving medieval chess sets, although it is not clear if a single complete period-accurate set can be assembled from the pieces. When found, the hoard contained 94 objects: 78 chess pieces, 14 tablemen (pieces for backgammon or similar games) and one belt buckle. Today, 82 pieces are owned and usually exhibited by the British Museum in London, and the remaining 11 are at the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh; at least one chess piece is owned privately.

The newly identified piece, a &quot;warder&quot;, the equivalent of a rook, was sold for £735,000 in July 2019. Four other major pieces, and many pawns, remain missing from the chess sets. 

== Origin ==
Most accounts have said the pieces were found at Uig Bay () on the west coast of Lewis, but Caldwell et al. of National Museums Scotland consider that Mealista () – which is also in the parish of Uig and some further south down the coast—is a more likely place for the hoard to have been discovered. The hoard was divided and sold in the 19th century; the British Museum holds 82 pieces, and National Museum of Scotland has 11 pieces, and the recently rediscovered piece is owned privately.

At the British Museum, F. Madden, Assistant Keeper of Manuscripts, persuaded the trustees to purchase for 80 guineas (£84) the 82 pieces which he had been misled into believing was the entire hoard. Madden was a palaeographer, a scholar of early vernacular literature, but he was especially intrigued by these artifacts because he was a chess enthusiast. Madden immediately began writing a research paper about the collection; the paper remains informative today.

There are many medieval chess bishops of various origins in different museums in Europe and US.
A bishop that probably predates the Lewis chessmen was in the collection of Jean-Joseph Marquet de Vasselot and was sold at Christie&#x27;s in Paris in 2011 with a radiocarbon dating report stating that there is a 95% probability that the ivory dates between 790 and 990 .
It is thought to be English or German and carved in the 12th century. Stylistically it predates the Lewis chessmen, as its mitre is worn sideways.

== Description ==

Almost all of the pieces in the collection are carved from walrus ivory, with a few made instead from whale teeth. The 79 chess pieces consist of 8 kings, 8 queens, 16 bishops, 15 knights, 13 warders (rooks) and 19 pawns. The heights of the pawns range from 3.5 to 5.8 cm ( to while the other pieces are between 7 and 10.2 cm ( and 4 in). Although there are 19 pawns (a complete set requires 16), they have the greatest range of sizes of all the pieces, which has suggested that the 79 chess pieces might belong to at least five sets. All the pawns are smaller, geometric shapes – cylinders and &quot;tombstones&quot; – perhaps intended to resemble boundary markers. All the pieces in the back rank are sculptures of human figures: The knights are mounted on rather diminutive horses and are shown holding spears and shields. The rooks are standing soldiers or &quot;warders&quot; holding shields and swords; four of the rooks are shown as wild-eyed berserkers biting their shields with battle fury. Some pieces bore traces of red stain when found (which has since vanished), possibly indicating that red and white were used to distinguish the two sides, rather than the black and white generally used in modern chess.
Scholars have observed that, to the modern eye, the figural pieces, with their bulging eyes and glum expressions, have a distinctly comic character. This is especially true of one rook (&quot;warder 4&quot; in Madden&#x27;s numbering) with a worried, sideways glance and the berserker rooks biting their shields, which have been called &quot;irresistibly comic to a modern audience&quot;. It is believed, however, that the comic or sad expressions were not intended or perceived as such by the makers, who instead saw strength, ferocity, or in the case of the queens who hold their heads with a hand and seemingly pensive expression, &quot;contemplation, repose, and possibly wisdom&quot;.

Moreover, a recent article has examined how one of the king pieces projected a racialised representation of the archetypal chess king. Chess pieces envisioned human bodies which were constantly re-imagined and re-interpreted in the medieval period, and the Lewis chess king is fittingly characterised by a beard, hairstyle, and facial features that would not stand out in twelfth-century Norway, the supposed origin point of the set.

== Discovery ==
The chessmen were discovered in early 1831 in a sandbank at the head of Uig Bay on the west coast of the Isle of Lewis, in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland. There are various local stories concerning their arrival and modern discovery on Lewis.

Malcolm &quot;Sprot&quot; MacLeod () from the nearby township of Pennydonald discovered the trove in a small stone kist in a dune, exhibited them briefly in his byre and sold them on to Captain Roderick Ryrie. One reported detail, that a cow actually unearthed the stash, is generally discounted in Uig as fabrication. After the Isle of Lewis was purchased by J. Matheson in 1844, Malcolm MacLeod and his family were evicted during the Highland Clearances which transformed the area into sheep farms.

When the chessmen were uncovered in 1831, 1 knight and 4 warders were missing from the four sets. In June 2019 a warder piece, which had previously gone unrecognised for at least 55 years, emerged in Edinburgh, and was purchased at a Sotheby&#x27;s auction for £735,000 the following month, by an undisclosed buyer.

== Exhibition and ownership ==

They were exhibited by Ryrie at a meeting of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, on 11 April 1831. The chessmen were soon after split up, with 10 being purchased by C.K. Sharpe and the others (67 chessmen and 14 tablemen) purchased on behalf of the British Museum in London.

C.K. Sharpe later found another bishop to take his collection up to 11, all of which were later sold to Baron Londesborough. In 1888, they were again sold, but this time the purchaser was the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, who donated the pieces to the Royal Scottish Museum in Edinburgh. The 11 are now on display in the National Museum of Scotland.

Of the pieces given to the British Museum, most can be found in Room 40, with the registration numbers M&amp;ME 1831, 11–1.78–159. Others have been lent to Scottish museums and temporary exhibitions.
A range of wooden or plastic replicas are popular items in the Museum shops.

The chessmen were number 5 in the list of British archaeological finds selected by experts at the British Museum for a 2003 BBC documentary. They were one of the items featured in a 2010 Radio 4 historical series.

An exhibition entitled &quot;The Lewis Chessmen: Unmasked&quot; included chess pieces from both the National Museum of Scotland and British Museum collections, along with other relevant objects, touring Scotland in 2010–2011. The exhibition opened in Edinburgh on 21 May 2010 and proceeded to Aberdeen, Shetland, and the Museum nan Eilean in Stornoway, opening there on 15 April 2011.

An exhibition entitled &quot;The Game of Kings: Medieval Ivory Chessmen from the Isle of Lewis&quot; at The Cloisters in New York City included 34 of the chess pieces, all on loan from the British Museum. The exhibit lasted through 22 April 2012.

On 3 April 2013, £1.8 million from the European Regional Development Fund was granted to transform Lews Castle, Isle of Lewis, into a museum for the Western Isles. Around £14 million in total is to be spent on restoring and converting the property, which has been shuttered for nearly 25 years. When completed the permanent displays will include 6 Lewis chessmen.

The Edinburgh warder piece was displayed in a special exhibit at the Neue Galerie New York in 2023, as part of a special exhibit.

== Dispute over location ==

In in late 2007, a dispute arose as to where the main resting place of the pieces should be. There were calls from Scottish National Party politicians in the Western Isles (notably Councillor Annie Macdonald, Alasdair Allan MSP and Angus MacNeil MP) for the return of the pieces to the place they were found. Linda Fabiani, Scottish Minister for Europe, External Affairs and Culture, stated that &quot;it is unacceptable that only 11 Lewis chessmen rest at the National Museum of Scotland while the other 67 (as well as the 14 tablemen) remain in the British Museum in London.&quot;

Richard Oram, Professor of Medieval and Environmental History at the University of Stirling, agreed, arguing that there was no reason for there to be more than &quot;a sample&quot; of the collection in London. These views were dismissed by Margaret Hodge, the then UK Minister of State in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, writing &quot;It&#x27;s a lot of nonsense, isn&#x27;t it?&quot;, noting that the law protects purchases and drawing comparisons to major artworks in Europe housed in major cities, with replicas often available &quot;in situ&quot; where tourism is sufficient. The historical society in Uig, &quot;Comann Eachdraidh Ùig&quot;, which operates its museum near the find site, features detailed information about the chessmen and Norse occupation in Lewis. It has published that it cannot claim to own the pieces and would allow the normal museum market to determine whether more originals should rest in Edinburgh. It welcomes short-term loans.

In October 2009, 24 of the pieces from London and 6 from Edinburgh began a 16 month tour of Scotland, partly funded by the Scottish Government, whose Mike Russell, Minister for Culture and External Affairs, stated that the Government and the British Museum had &quot;agreed to disagree&quot; on their eventual fate. Bonnie Greer, the museum&#x27;s deputy chairman, said that she &quot;absolutely&quot; believed the main collection should remain in London.

Neil MacGregor, who at the time of the debate was director of the British Museum, was reported to say that it was Norway who was entitled to ask for them back, not Scotland. M. Bunting writes that:
: &quot;the British Museum has picked its way carefully and 6 of the figures were loaned long-term to Lewis&#x27;s new museum in 2015&quot;.
