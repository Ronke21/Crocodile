<text>The American chestnut (Castanea dentata) is a large, fast-growing deciduous tree of the beech family native to eastern North America. As is true of all species in the genus &quot;Castanea&quot;, the American chestnut produces burred fruit with edible nuts. The American chestnut was once common in its Appalachian Mountain range and was a dominant species in the oak-chestnut forest region of its central and southern range.

During the early to mid-20th century, American chestnut trees were devastated by chestnut blight, a fungal disease that came from Japanese chestnut trees that were introduced into North America from Japan. It is estimated that the blight killed between three and four billion American chestnut trees in the first half of the 20th century, beginning in 1904. Few mature American chestnuts exist within its former range, although many stumps and root systems continue to send up saplings. Most of these saplings get infected by chestnut blight, which girdles and kills them before they attain maturity. There are hundreds of large ( in diameter) American chestnuts outside its historical range, some in areas where less virulent strains of the pathogen are more common, such as the 600 to 800 large trees in Northern Michigan. The species is listed as endangered in Canada under the Species at Risk Act. American chestnuts are also susceptible to ink disease, particularly in the southern part of its native range; this likely contributed to the devastation of the species.

Several groups are attempting to create blight-resistant American chestnuts. Scientists at the SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry created the Darling 58 cultivar by inserting the oxalate oxidase gene from wheat into the genome of an American chestnut. When expressed in the vascular cambium of the Darling 58 cultivar, the oxalate oxidase enzyme degrades the oxalic acid produced by the chestnut blight, reducing damage to the vascular cambium and resisting girdling of the trunk. As of 2021, the researchers who developed this cultivar are working toward applying for government permission to make these trees available to the public. If approved, these chestnut trees would be the first genetically modified forest trees released into the wild in the United States. Alternate approaches to developing a blight-resistant cultivar include cross-breeding among partially blight-resistant American chestnuts or crossbreeding with the moderately blight-resistant Chinese chestnut, then backcrossing with the American chestnut, with the goal of retaining most of its genes.

==Description==
&quot;Castanea dentata&quot; is a rapidly-growing, large, deciduous hardwood eudicot tree. A singular specimen manifest in Maine has attained a height of Pre-blight sources give a maximum height of and a maximum circumference of . Post-blight sources erroneously report a greater maximum size of the species compared with pre-blight, likely the result of nostalgia, interpretations of pre-blight measurements of circumference as being measurements of diameter, and the misapprehension that pre-blight observations of maximum size represented observations of average size. It is considerably larger than the closely related Allegheny chinquapin (&quot;Castanea pumila&quot;).

There are several other chestnut species, such as the European sweet chestnut (&quot;C. sativa&quot;), Chinese chestnut (&quot;C. mollissima&quot;), and Japanese chestnut (&quot;C. crenata&quot;). &quot;Castanea dentata&quot; can be distinguished by a few morphological traits, such as petiole length, nut size and number of nuts per burr, leaf shape, and leaf size, with leaves being long and broad—slightly shorter and broader than the sweet chestnut. It has larger and more widely spaced saw-teeth on the edges of its leaves, as indicated by the scientific name &quot;dentata&quot;, Latin for &quot;toothed&quot;.

The European sweet chestnut was introduced in the United States by Thomas Jefferson in 1773. The European sweet chestnut has hairy twig tips in contrast to the hairless twigs of the American chestnut. This species has been the chief source of commercial chestnuts in the United States. Japanese chestnut was inadvertently introduced into the United States by Thomas Hogg in 1876 and planted on the property of S. B. Parsons in Flushing, New York. The Japanese chestnut has narrow leaves, smaller than either American chestnut or sweet chestnut, with small, sharply-pointed teeth and many hairs on the underside of the leaf and is the most blight-resistant species.

The chestnut is monoecious, and usually protandrous producing many small, pale green (nearly white) male flowers found tightly occurring along 6 to 8 inch long catkins. The female parts are found near the base of the catkins (near twig) and appear in late spring to early summer. Like all members of the family Fagaceae, American chestnut is self-incompatible and requires two trees for pollination, which can be with other members of the &quot;Castanea&quot; genus. The pollen is considered a mild allergen.

The American chestnut is a prolific bearer of nuts, with inflorescence and nut production in the wild beginning when a tree is 8 to 10 years old. Burrs often open while still attached to the tree, around the time of the first frost in autumn, with the nuts then falling to the ground. American chestnut typically have three nuts enclosed in a spiny, green burr, each lined in a tan velvet. In contrast, the Allegheny chinquapin produces one nut per burr.

==Evolution and ecology==
Chestnuts are in the Fagaceae family along with beech and oak. Chestnuts are not closely related to the horse chestnut, which is in the family Sapindaceae. Phylogenetic analysis indicates a westward migration of extant &quot;Castanea&quot; species from Asia to Europe to North America, with the American chestnut more closely related to the Allegheny chinquapin (&quot;Castanea pumila&quot; v. &quot;pumila&quot;) than to European or Asian clades. The genomic range of chestnuts can be roughly divided into a clinal pattern of northeast, central, and southwest populations, with southwest populations showing greatest diversity, reflecting an evolutionary bottleneck likely caused by Quaternary glaciation. Two lineages of American chestnut have been identified, one a hybrid between the American chestnut and the Allegheny chinquapin from the southern Appalachians. The other lineage shows a gradual loss of genetic diversity along a northward vector, indicating possible expansion of range following the most recent glacial maximum during the Wisconsin glaciation. Ozark chinkapin (&quot;C. ozarkensis&quot;), which is typically considered either a distinct species or a subspecies of the Allegheny chinquapin (&quot;C. pumila&quot; subsp. &quot;ozarkensis&quot;), may be ancestral to both the American chestnut and the Allegheny chinquapin. A natural hybrid of &quot;C. dentata&quot; and &quot;C. pumila&quot; has been named &quot;Castanea&quot; × &quot;neglecta&quot;.

The American chestnut population was reduced to 1–10% of its original size as a result of the chestnut blight and has not recovered. The surviving trees are &quot;frozen in time&quot; with shoots re-sprouting from survivor rootstock but almost entirely undergoing blight-induced dieback without producing chestnuts. Unexpectedly, American chestnut appears to have retained substantial genetic diversity following the population bottleneck, which is at odds with the limited incidence of blight resistance/tolerance in extant populations.

The pre-blight distribution was restricted to moist, well-drained, steep slopes with acidic loam soils. According to analysis of old forest dust data, the tree was rare or absent in New England prior to 2,500 years before present but rapidly established dominance in these forests, becoming a common tree over a range from Maine and southern Ontario to Mississippi, and from the Atlantic coast to the Appalachian Mountains and the Ohio Valley. Within its range, the American chestnut was the dominant timber of mountain ridges and sandstone soils. Along the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina, it dominated the area above the range of the Eastern hemlock and below 1,500 meters. In Western Maryland, it comprised 50% of ridge timber and 36% of forested slopes.

The tree&#x27;s abundance was the result of a combination of rapid growth, relative fire resistance, and a large annual nut crop, in comparison to oaks, which do not reliably produce sizable numbers of acorns every year. Historically, the mean fire return interval was 20 years or less in chestnut-predominant ecologies, with a forest stand pattern that was more open than is currently the case.

The American chestnut was an important tree for wildlife, providing much of the fall mast for species such as white-tailed deer, wild turkey, Allegheny woodrat and (prior to its extinction) the passenger pigeon. Black bears were also known to eat the nuts to fatten up for the winter. The trees contain more nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and magnesium in its leaves than other trees that share its habitat, so they return more nutrients to the soil which helps with the growth of other plants, animals, and microorganisms. The American chestnut is preferred by some avian seed hoarders and was particularly important as a food source during years where the oak mast failed. The functional extinction of the American chestnut may have resulted in the extinction of some of the tree&#x27;s host-specialist insect associates, including the Greater Chestnut Weevil.

==Parasites==
The appearance of invasive pathogens of the American Chestnut into the eastern deciduous forest ecosystem is just one instance of the Columbian exchange of pathogens. While the Columbian exchange moved valuable crops between the Americas, Europe and Asia, there was also a downside, as the rapid introduction of invasive and unfamiliar pathogens resulted in serious damage or extinction of some host species.

===Chestnut blight===
Prior to the chestnut blight, the American chestnut was a dominant tree in the ecosystem of the eastern deciduous forest. It was said that a squirrel could walk from New England to Georgia solely on the branches of American chestnuts. Once an important hardwood timber tree, the American chestnut suffered a catastrophic population collapse due to the chestnut blight, a disease caused by an Asian bark fungus (&quot;Cryphonectria parasitica&quot;, formerly &quot;Endothia parasitica&quot;). The fungus was introduced when infected Japanese chestnut trees were brought to North America in the late 19th century. Chestnut blight was first noticed on American chestnut trees in what was then the New York Zoological Park, now known as the Bronx Zoo, in the borough of The Bronx, New York City, in 1904, by chief forester Hermann Merkel. Merkel estimated that by 1906 blight had infected 98 percent of the chestnut trees in the borough. While Asian chestnut species evolved with the blight and developed a strong resistance, the American chestnut and Allegheny chinquapin have little resistance. The airborne bark fungus spread per year and in a few decades girdled and killed more than three billion American chestnut trees. Salvage logging during the early years of the blight may have unwittingly destroyed trees that had high levels of resistance to the disease and thus aggravated the calamity. New shoots often sprout from the roots when the main stem dies, so the species has not yet become extinct. However, the stump sprouts rarely reach more than in height before blight infection returns, so the species is classified as functionally extinct since the chestnut blight only actively kills the above ground portion of the American chestnut tree, leaving behind the below-ground components such as the root systems. It was recorded in the 1900s that the chestnut blight would commonly reinfect any novel stems that grew from the stumps, therefore maintaining a cycle that would prevent the American chestnut tree from re-establishing. However, some American chestnut trees have survived because of a small natural resistance to the chestnut blight.

The high density of American chestnuts within its range and the lack of natural immunity allowed the blight to spread quickly and cause infection and die-off in nearly every tree exposed. Early attempts to treat chestnut blight were both chemical (such as the use of fungicides) and physical (such as removing infected limbs through tree surgery and the removal of infected trees from cultivated and wild stands). Quarantine measures were also put into place, with the later support of the Plant Quarantine Act, which was an attempt to prevent the importation of other potential plant pathogens. These attempts to contain the spread of chestnut blight were unsuccessful; the devastation of the species was worsened because the chestnut blight resulted in isolation of remaining specimens, resulting in asexual propagation of many isolated American chestnuts, low genetic diversity of stands of American chestnuts, and consequent vulnerability to extirpation. 

Chestnut blight is not to be confused with sun scald, where winter sun reflects off of snow, warming the bark on the sun-facing trunk (this is the south-facing trunk in the Northern Hemisphere). This snow-reflected sunlight repeatedly warms and thaws the trunk during the day, resulting in vulnerability of the bark and cambium to freezing cold temperatures during the subsequent night, eventually resulting in bark cankers that resemble chestnut blight. Also, sun scald makes the damaged bark vulnerable to invasion by pathogens.

===Ink disease===
Before the onset of chestnut blight and prior to 1824, an epidemic of ink disease struck American chestnuts, most likely brought to the southern United States on Cork oak trees imported from Portugal. This fungal pathogen is known to also kill the roots and collars of several &quot;Castanea&quot; species, including the European sweet chestnut. It affected primarily chestnuts in the Southeastern US and at the later time when chestnut blight struck, the range of &quot;C. dentata&quot; may have already been reduced. The potential range of blight-resistant American chestnuts is substantially reduced if those chestnuts are susceptible to ink disease. Further, the range of this pathogen will extend northward as the climate warms, which may further limit the potential range of the American chestnut. Potassium phosphonate has been found to induce resistance to infection of &quot;C. sativa&quot; by both inhibiting &quot;Phytophthora&quot; species directly and by improving the host response, inducing resistance to lesions in phloem tissue and formation of callus. Whether or not this effect would occur in &quot;C. dentata&quot; is uncertain.

===Chestnut brown nut rot===
Brown nut rot is a destructive plant disease caused by the primary agent &quot;Gnomoniopsis castaneae&quot; and afflicting &quot;Castanea&quot; species. This pathogen also causes mild disease or exists as an endophyte in other hardwoods. The disease is found in Europe and Oceania. More recently, it has been reported in North America.

===Chinese gall wasp===
The Chinese gall wasp attacks all chestnut species and causes heavy damage. As this species of wasp is a threat to saplings, and is now widely-present in eastern North American forests, it is a potential problem for reintroduction of the American chestnut. The Chinese parasitoid chalcid wasp &quot;Torymus sinensis&quot; is considered an effective control method for the Chinese gall wasp. There are now established populations of &quot;Torymus sinensis&quot; in North America.

==Reduced population==
American chestnuts were a common part of the forest canopy in southeast Michigan. Although large trees are currently rare east of the Mississippi River, they exist in pockets in the blight-free West, where the habitat was agreeable for planting: settlers took seeds with them in the 19th century. Huge planted chestnut trees can be found in Sherwood, Oregon, as the Mediterranean climate of the West Coast discourages the fungus, which relies on hot, humid summer weather. American chestnut also thrives as far north as Revelstoke, British Columbia.

At present, it is believed that survival of &quot;C. dentata&quot; for more than a decade in its native range is almost impossible. The fungus uses various oak trees as a host, and while the oak is unaffected, American chestnuts nearby will succumb to the blight in approximately a year or more. In addition, the hundreds of chestnut stumps and &quot;living stools&quot; dotting eastern woodlands may still contain active pathogens. It is considered extirpated from Florida and Illinois.

The reduced population of American chestnuts directly impacted many species of insects that relied upon the tree species for survival. Of approximately 60 species that feed upon the American chestnut, seven rely entirely on the American chestnut as a food source. Some of these, like the American chestnut moth, are now extinct or severely reduced in population.

==Attempts at restoration==

===Transgenic blight-resistant American chestnut===
Researchers at the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry (SUNY ESF) have developed the Darling 58 chestnut cultivar. This cultivar expresses the gene for wheat oxalate oxidase enzyme, which breaks down the oxalic acid produced by the blight fungus, preventing the death of the tree. When pollen of transgenic fathers fertilizes an ovule of a native mother in the field, those resulting seedlings that express the oxalate oxidase enzyme show growth similar to non-transgenic full siblings, indicating that the transgene does not impede growth under field conditions. The modified chestnut does not affect survival, pollen use, or reproduction of bumble bees. A deregulation petition for the Darling 58 variant has been submitted. If approved, these trees could be the first genetically modified forest trees released in the wild in the United States.

Unlike American chestnut, Japanese chestnut exhibits resistance to &quot;Phytophthora cinnamomi&quot;, the fungal pathogen that causes ink disease. The mechanism of resistance of &quot;C. crenata&quot; to &quot;Phytophthora cinnamomi&quot; may derive from its expression of the Cast_Gnk2-like gene (99.6% identical with ). Transgenic modification of &quot;C. dentata&quot; with the Cast_Gnk2-like gene may provide a mechanism for developing American chestnut trees resistant to &quot;Phytophthora cinnamomi&quot;. Stacking of the Cast_Gnk2-like gene and the oxalate oxidase gene may provide a means of developing genetically modified American chestnut trees resistant to both the chestnut blight and to ink disease.

The American Chestnut Research and Restoration Project at SUNY-ESF is not pursuing intellectual property protection through patents. Dr William Powell, the project&#x27;s co-director, states that the decision to not pursue a patent on the project&#x27;s transgenic lines was to allow the plant to be more accessible for conservationists and members of the public. Powell posits that a patent would constrain the spread of the oxalate oxidase transgene into American chestnut populations by limiting the ability to freely plant transgenic trees and cross the trees with surviving American chestnuts or the hybrids produced in the backcross program. Powell states that patents would be a barrier to chestnut restoration and in direct opposition to the program&#x27;s goals of collaboration. While patent protection is not sought, the non-profit American Chestnut Foundation (TACF) maintains control through a Germplasm Agreement, ensuring authorized use of chestnut germplasm. The agreement safeguards TACF&#x27;s rights and aligns with the organization&#x27;s restoration goals.

A laboratory error resulted in mistaken use of the Darling 54 cultivar instead of the Darling 58 cultivar in some field trials. TACF and colleagues have also reported decreased growth rates, and poor heritability of resistance of the Darling 58 cultivar. In response, the American Chestnut Foundation withdrew its support of development of the Darling 58 cultivar in December 2023. The American Chestnut Research &amp; Restoration Program at SUNY ESF is continuing to pursue deregulation.

In 2022, the SUNY ESF group developed transgenic American chestnut trees incorporating both the oxalate oxidase transgene from wheat and the win3.12 promoter transgene from the necklace poplar. Unlike the CAMV 35S promoter which acts at all times, this poplar promoter drives OxO expression at a low level under basal conditions, but elevates to high levels under conditions of wounding or tissue infection. In laboratory bioassays, win3.12-OxO lines showed elevated disease tolerance similar to that exhibited by blight-resistant Chinese chestnut. Limiting expression of the OxO gene to blight infected tissues is expected to reduce the metabolic cost of gene expression, resulting in increased competitiveness of these new cultivars. As of January 2025, the win3.12 OxO chestnut is still in the research and development phase and has not been deployed for restoration purposes.

===Intercrossing surviving American chestnuts===

American Chestnut Cooperators&#x27; Foundation (ACCF) is not using crosses with Asian species for blight resistance, but intercrossing among American chestnuts selected for native resistance to the blight, a breeding strategy described by the ACCF as &quot;All-American intercrosses&quot;. John Rush Elkins, a research chemist and professor emeritus of chemistry at Concord University, and Gary Griffin, professor of plant pathology at Virginia Tech, think there may be several different characteristics which favor blight resistance. Both Elkins and Griffin have written extensively about the American chestnut. They believe that by making intercrosses among resistant American chestnuts from many locations, they will continue to improve upon the levels of blight resistance to make an American chestnut that can compete in the forest. Griffin, who has been involved with American chestnut restoration for many years, developed a scale for assessing levels of blight resistance, which made it possible to make selections scientifically. He inoculated five-year-old chestnuts with a standard lethal strain of the blight fungus and measured growth of the cankers. Chestnuts with no resistance to blight make rapid-growing, sunken cankers that are deep and kill tissue right to the wood. Resistant chestnuts make slow-growing, swollen cankers that are superficial: live tissue can be recovered under these cankers. The level of blight resistance is judged by periodic measurement of cankers. Grafts from large survivors of the blight epidemic were evaluated following inoculations, and controlled crosses among resistant American chestnut trees were made beginning in 1980. The first &quot;All-American intercrosses&quot; were planted in Virginia Tech&#x27;s Martin American Chestnut Planting in Giles County, Virginia, and in Beckley, West Virginia. They were inoculated in 1990 and evaluated in 1991 and 1992. Nine of the trees showed resistance equal to their parents, and four of these had resistance comparable to hybrids in the same test. Many ACCF chestnuts have expressed blight resistance equal to or greater than an original blight survivor but so far, only a handful have demonstrated superior, durable blight control. Time will tell if the progeny of these best chestnuts exhibit durable blight resistance in different stress environments.

===Backcrossing===
Backcrossing as a treatment for blight was first proposed by Charles Burnham of the University of Minnesota in the 1970s. Burnham, a professor emeritus in agronomy and plant genetics who was considered one of the pioneers of maize genetics, realized that experiments conducted by the USDA to cross-breed American chestnuts with European and Asian chestnuts erroneously assumed that a large number of genes were responsible for blight resistance, while it is currently believed the number of responsible genes is low. The USDA abandoned their cross-breeding program and destroyed local plantings around 1960 after failing to produce a blight-resistant hybrid. Burnham&#x27;s recognition of the USDA&#x27;s error led to him joining with others to create The American Chestnut Foundation in 1983, with the sole purpose of breeding a blight-resistant American chestnut. The American Chestnut Foundation is backcrossing blight-resistant Chinese chestnut into American chestnut trees, to recover the American growth characteristics and genetic makeup, and then finally intercrossing the advanced backcross generations to eliminate genes for susceptibility to blight. The first backcrossed American chestnut tree, called &quot;Clapper&quot;, survived blight for 25 years, and grafts of the tree have been used by The American Chestnut Foundation since 1983. The Pennsylvania chapter of The American Chestnut Foundation, which seeks to restore the American chestnut to the forests of the Mid-Atlantic states, has planted over 22,000 trees.

The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 requires owners of abandoned coal mines to cover at least 80 percent of their land with vegetation. While many companies planted invasive grasses, others began funding research on planting trees, because they can be more cost-effective, and yield better results. Keith Gilland began planting American chestnut trees in old strip mines in 2008 as a student at Miami University, and to date has planted over 5,000 trees. In 2005, a hybrid tree with mostly American genes was planted on the lawn of the White House. A tree planted in 2005 in the tree library outside the USDA building was still very healthy seven years later; it contains 98% American chestnut DNA and 2% Chinese chestnut DNA. This tree contains enough Chinese chestnut DNA that encodes for systemic resistance genes to resist the blight. This is essential for restoring the American chestnut trees into the Northeast. The Northern Nut Growers Association (NNGA) has also been active in pursuing viable hybrids. From 1962 to 1990, Alfred Szego and other members of the NNGA developed hybrids with Chinese varieties which showed limited resistance. Initially the backcrossing method would breed a hybrid from an American chestnut nut and a Chinese chestnut, the hybrid would then be bred with a normal American chestnut, subsequent breeding would involve a hybrid and an American chestnut or two hybrids, which would increase the genetic makeup of the hybrids primarily American chestnut but still retain the blight resistance of the Chinese chestnut.

A backcross breeding program has integrated desirable American chestnut traits with traits from the Chinese chestnut, achieving intermediate resistance to &quot;Cryphonectria parasitica&quot; and &quot;Phytophthora cinnamomi&quot; in the hybrid genome.

The B3F3 strain, a product of backcrossing and intercrossing with selection for blight resistance, is approximately 94% American chestnut and 6% Chinese chestnut and has been planted experimentally in Maryland in an orchard.

===Hypovirulence===
Hypovirus is the only genus in the family Hypoviridae. Members of this genus infect fungal pathogens and reduce their ability to cause disease (hypovirulence). In particular, the virus infects &quot;Cryphonectria parasitica&quot;, the fungus that causes chestnut blight, which has enabled infected trees to recover from the blight. The use of hypovirulence to control blight originated in Europe where the fungal virus spread naturally through populations of European chestnuts. The reduced ability of the fungus to cause disease allowed the European chestnut to regenerate, creating large stands of trees. Hypovirulence has also been found in North America, but has not spread effectively. The &quot;Arner Tree&quot; of Southern Ontario is one of the best examples of naturally occurring hypovirulence. It is a mature American chestnut that has recovered from severe infections of chestnut blight. The cankers have healed over and the tree continues to grow vigorously. Scientists have discovered that the chestnut blight remaining on the tree is hypovirulent, although isolates taken from the tree do not have the fungal viruses found in other isolates. Trees inoculated with isolates taken from the Arner tree have shown moderate canker control. The cankers of hypovirulent American chestnut trees occur on the outermost tissues of the tree but the cankers do not spread into the growth tissues of the American chestnut tree, thereby providing it with a resistance.

==Surviving specimens==


* About 2,500 chestnut trees are growing on near West Salem, Wisconsin, which is the world&#x27;s largest remaining stand of American chestnut. These trees are the descendants of those planted by Martin Hicks, an early settler in the area, who planted fewer than a dozen trees in the late 19th century. Planted outside the natural range of chestnut, these trees escaped the initial onslaught of chestnut blight, but in 1987 scientists found blight in the stand. Scientists are working to try to save the trees.
* Some 1,348 chestnut trees, varying in size from seedlings to nearly mature trees, are growing in a forest in western Maine. These chestnuts were originally established in 1982 from four seed-bearing trees sourced from wild stock of a northern Michigan relict population. This grove of trees has dispersed over an area up to 370 meters from the parent trees. The trees appear to be free of chestnut blight. The University of Maine Foundation believes it has the tallest chestnut in North America on its property in Lovell, Maine. As per a 2015 measurement, it was tall, in girth and believed to be around 100 years old.
* Two of the largest surviving trees are in Jackson County, Tennessee. One, the state champion, has a diameter of and a height of , and the other tree is nearly as large. One of them has been pollinated with hybrid pollen by members of The American Chestnut Foundation; the progeny will have mostly American chestnut genes and some will be blight resistant.
* A stand of several trees near Warm Springs, Georgia, has a tree that is approximately 20–30 years old and tall and is the southernmost American chestnut tree known to be flowering and producing nuts.
* A large tree was found in Talladega National Forest, Alabama, in 2005.
* In 2007 a stand of trees was discovered near the northeastern Ohio town of Braceville. The stand encompasses four large flowering trees, the largest of which is about tall, sited among hundreds of smaller trees that have not begun to flower, located in and around a sandstone quarry. A combination of factors may account for the survival of these relatively large trees, including low levels of blight susceptibility, hypovirulence, and good site conditions. In particular, some stands may have avoided exposure due to being located at a higher altitude than blighted trees in the neighboring area; the fungal spores are not carried to higher altitudes as easily.
* In 2008, officials of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources announced a rare adult American chestnut tree had been discovered in a marsh near Lake Erie. The officials admitted they had known about the tree for seven years but had kept its existence a secret. The exact location of the tree is still being held secret, both because of the risk of infecting the tree and because an eagle had nested in its branches. They described the tree as being tall and having a circumference of . The American Chestnut Foundation was also only recently told about the tree&#x27;s existence.
* Members of the Kentucky chapter of the American Chestnut Foundation have been pollinating a tree found on a farm in Adair County, and a specimen found on Henderson Ridge in Elliott County. The Adair County tree is over one hundred years old.
* In 2007 a mature American chestnut was discovered in Farmington, New Hampshire.
* In rural Missaukee County, Michigan, a blight-free grove of American chestnut trees approximately in size with the largest tree measuring in circumference ( diameter) has been located. It is believed to be the result of nuts planted by early settlers in the area. The American Chestnut Council has verified its identity and existence. Efforts have been initiated to protect the property from logging and development. In Lansing, Michigan, Fenner Nature Center is home to a grove of blight-free American chestnuts descended from the grove in Missaukee County.
* American chestnuts have been located on Beaver Island in Lake Michigan.
* Hundreds of healthy American chestnuts have been found in the proposed Chestnut Ridge Wilderness Area in the Allegheny National Forest in northwestern Pennsylvania. Many of these trees measure more than in height. These trees will be protected from logging if the wilderness area, proposed by Friends of Allegheny Wilderness, is passed into law.
* The Montreal Botanical Garden has the American chestnut among its collection of trees and ornamental shrubs.
* Three of Portland, Oregon&#x27;s heritage trees are American chestnuts, along with three Spanish (European) chestnuts.
* At least two American chestnuts live on the side of Skitchewaug Trail in Springfield, Vermont.
* Around 300 to 500 trees were spotted in the George Washington National Forest near Augusta County, Virginia, in 2014. Over one dozen trees were at least 12 inches in diameter with several measuring nearly 24 inches in diameter. Only one of the larger trees was a seed and pollen producer with numerous pods and pollen strands lying on ground. The site did, however, have a high presence of chestnut blight, although the seed producing tree and several other large ones were relatively blight-free with minimal to no damage.
* Two trees were planted 1985, in Nova Scotia, at Dalhousie University, Sexton Campus and are thriving. The donated trees were from saplings grown in Europe, away from the blight. They have diameter trunks and are approximately high.
* A single mature American chestnut can be found on the front lawn of the McPhail house heritage site in Sault Ste Marie, Ontario, planted by former mayor John Alexander McPhail in the 1920s. Well north of the natural range of the chestnut, it has avoided the blight.
* There is one tree in South Centre Township, Pennsylvania. It is a hardy, nut-producing tree that has been producing for nearly 30 years.
* A solitary tree exists in Wawayanda, New York, planted in the early 1990s as part of a local soil and water conservation district program to identify blight/resistant specimens. It has borne fruit since 2005.
* A lone tree grows on the Oakdale Campus in Coralville, Iowa.
* The great majority of chestnut trees in the United States are derived from Dunstan chestnuts, developed in Greensboro, North Carolina, in the 1960s.
*The Canadian Chestnut Council has a plot growing and harvesting chestnut trees at Tim Hortons Children&#x27;s Foundation Onondaga Farms. The seedlings are grown at a Simcoe station. They are then brought in the spring to this test plantation in St. George, Ontario. 
*Multiple nut-bearing trees are in Wind River Arboretum, Washington.

==Uses==

===Food===
The nuts were once an important economic resource in North America, being sold on the streets of towns and cities, as they sometimes still are during the Christmas season (usually said to be &quot;roasting on an open fire&quot; because their smell is readily identifiable many blocks away). Chestnuts are edible raw or roasted, though typically preferred roasted. One must peel the brown skin to access the yellowish-white edible portion.

The nuts were commonly fed on by various types of wildlife and was also in such a high abundance that they were used to feed livestock by farmers, by allowing those livestock to roam freely into the forests that were predominantly filled with American chestnut trees. The tree was important to many Native American tribes in North America as it served as a food source, both for them and the wildlife they hunted, and also as a component in traditional medicine.

===Furniture and other wood products===
The January 1888 issue of &quot;Orchard and Garden&quot; mentions the American chestnut as being &quot;superior in quality to any found in Europe&quot;. The wood is straight-grained, strong, and easy to saw and split, and it lacks the radial end grain found on most other hardwoods. The tree was particularly valuable commercially since it grew at a faster rate than oaks. Being rich in tannins, the wood was highly resistant to decay and therefore used for a variety of purposes, including furniture, split-rail fences, shingles, home construction, flooring, piers, plywood, paper pulp, and telephone poles. Tannins were also extracted from the bark for tanning leather. Although larger trees are no longer available for milling, much chestnut wood has been reclaimed from historic barns to be refashioned into furniture and other items.

&quot;Wormy&quot; chestnut refers to a defective grade of wood that has insect damage, having been sawn from long-dead, blight-killed trees. This &quot;wormy&quot; wood has since become fashionable for its rustic character.

<text>The pathogenic fungus Cryphonectria parasitica (formerly &quot;Endothia parasitica&quot;) is a member of the Ascomycota (sac fungi). This necrotrophic fungus is native to East Asia and South East Asia and was introduced into Europe and North America in the early 1900s. Strains of the fungus spread more or less rapidly and caused significant tree loss in both regions. Strains of the fungus can be more or less virulent.

==Overview==
&quot;Cryphonectria parasitica&quot; is a parasitic fungus of chestnut trees. This disease came to be known as chestnut blight. Naturally found in South East Asia, accidental introductions led to invasive populations of &quot;C. parasitica&quot; in North America and Europe. In the first half of the 20th century, the fungal disease had a devastating economic and social impact on communities in the eastern United States. It killed an estimated four billion trees; or, by another count, 3.5 billion trees through 2013. Less severe impacts have occurred in Europe due to widespread CHV1-induced &quot;hypovirulence&quot;. CHV1 is one of at least two viral pathogens that weaken the fungus through hypovirulence and helps trees survive a blight infection.

The American chestnut (&quot;Castanea dentata&quot;) and American chinquapin (&quot;Castanea pumila&quot;) are highly susceptible to chestnut blight. The European chestnut (&quot;Castanea sativa&quot;) is also susceptible, but due to widespread CHV1 hypovirulence, blight-induced tree death is less common. The fungus can infect other tree species such as oaks, red maples, staghorn sumacs, and shagbark hickories. Once infected, these trees&#x27; bark also exhibit orange cankers but may not die. The pathogen can persist in these trees, producing spores that may infect other trees.

Fungal strains spread by wind-borne ascospores and, over a shorter distance, conidia distributed by rain-splash action. Infection can be local in range, so some isolated American chestnuts survive where there is no other infected tree within . Soil organisms at the root collar and root system of the chestnut tree are antagonistic to the fungus. Chestnut tree roots are resistant to blight infections. Consequently, a large number of small American chestnut trees still exist as shoots growing from existing root bases. However, these regrown shoots seldom reach the sexually reproductive stage before above ground growth is again girdled by the fungus.
Fungal strains originally infected the Chinese chestnut (&quot;Ca. mollissima&quot;) and the Japanese chestnut (&quot;Ca. crenata&quot;). These two species have co-evolved with the pathogen, making them most variably resistant to its ill effects.

==History==
===Infections in North America===

In 1904, the chestnut blight was accidentally introduced to North America. &quot;Cryphonectria parasitica&quot; was introduced into the United States from East Asia via import of Japanese chestnut trees. Commercial breeding purposes motivated these imports. Infection of American chestnut trees with &quot;C. parasitica&quot; simultaneously appeared in numerous places on the East Coast, most likely from Japanese chestnuts, which had become popular imports.

Herman W. Merkel, a forester at the New York Zoological Garden (Bronx Zoo) first found infected chestnut trees on the grounds of the zoo. 
In 1905, American mycologist William Murrill isolated and described the fungus responsible (which he named &quot;Diaporthe parasitica&quot;), and demonstrated by inoculation into healthy plants that the fungus caused the disease. By 1940, most mature American chestnut trees had been girdled by the disease. It took about 40 years to devastate the nearly four-billion-strong American chestnut population in North America. Only a few clumps of uninfected trees remained in Michigan, Wisconsin, and the Pacific Northwest.

Japanese and Chinese chestnut trees may resist an infection from &quot;C. parasitica&quot;. Because of the disease, American chestnut wood almost disappeared from the market for decades, although it can still be obtained as reclaimed lumber.

It is estimated that in some places, such as the Appalachian Mountains, one in every four hardwoods was an American chestnut. Mature trees often grew straight and branch-free for 50 feet and could grow up to 100 feet tall with a trunk diameter of 14 feet at a few feet above ground level. The reddish-brown wood was lightweight, soft, easy to split, very resistant to decay, and did not warp or shrink. For three centuries many barns and homes near the Appalachian Mountains were made from American chestnut. Its straight-grained wood was ideal for building furniture and caskets. The bark and wood were rich in tannic acid, which provided tannins for use in the tanning of leather.

Chestnuts were an important cash crop and food source. Many native animals fed on chestnuts, and chestnuts were used for livestock feed, which kept the cost of raising livestock low.

Efforts started in the 1930s and are still ongoing, in Massachusetts and many other places in the United States, to repopulate chestnut trees. Surviving American chestnut trees are being bred for resistance to the blight, notably by The American Chestnut Foundation, which aims to reintroduce a blight-resistant American chestnut to its original forest range within the early decades of the 21st century. Japanese chestnut and Chinese chestnut, as well as Seguin&#x27;s chestnut and Henry&#x27;s chestnut, have been used in these breeding programs in the US to create disease-resistant hybrids with the American chestnut. Chinese chestnut trees have been found to have the highest resistance to chestnut blight; however, individuals within the Chinese chestnut species may vary in blight resistance. Some individuals are still quite susceptible while others are essentially immune.

Hypovirulence is not widespread in the US and attempts to commercially introduce CHV1 virus have not been widely successful . Though CHV1 persists in applied trees, it does not spread naturally as it does in Europe , preventing it from being an effective form of biocontrol.

===Infections in Europe===

In 1938, chestnut blight was first identified around Genoa. Infection quickly spread and was identified in France in 1946, Switzerland in 1951, and Greece in 1963. It has most recently been found in the UK. Due to genetic differences between the fungal populations (strains), it is likely that a second introduction of chestnut blight occurred in Georgia and Azerbaijan in 1938. The fungal infections initially caused widespread tree death in Europe. However, in the early 1950s trees were identified in Italy that survived fungal infection. On these trees, the fungus caused more superficial cankers, that appeared to be healing. The milder infection outcome was due to the presence of CHV1, an RNA virus that infects &quot;C. parasitica&quot;. CHV1 spread naturally throughout Europe but is also spread artificially as a biocontrol measure (particularly in France). CHV1 is currently not present in the UK, Northern France, or Eastern Georgia but an introduction for biocontrol is being considered. 

==Symptoms==

The fungus enters through wounds on susceptible trees and grows in and beneath the bark, eventually killing the cambium all the way around the twig, branch, or trunk. The first symptom of &quot;C. parasitica&quot; infection is a small orange-brown area on the tree bark. A sunken canker then forms as the mycelial fan spreads under the bark. As the hyphae spread, they produce several toxic compounds, the most notable of which is oxalic acid. This acid lowers the pH of the infected tissue from around the normal 5.5 to approximately 2.8, which is toxic to cambium cells. The canker eventually girdles the tree, killing everything above it. Distinctive yellow tendrils (cirrus) of conidia can be seen extruding in wet weather.

==Life cycle and reproduction==
The primary plant tissues targeted by &quot;C. parasitica&quot; are the inner bark, an area containing the conductive tissue, and the cambium, a layer of actively dividing cells that give rise to secondary vascular tissues. In these tissues, the pathogen forms diffuse cankers in which the mycelium overwinters. In the following spring, two types of fruiting bodies will form: pycnidia, usually first, and perithecia. Following rainfall, the pycnidia ooze orange tendrils of conidia, the asexual spores, while perithecia forcibly eject ascospores, the sexual spores. Upon becoming airborne, ascospores are carried by eddies of wind to new hosts or infect other parts of the same tree. When insects, birds, or other wildlife come into contact with the cankers, they can mechanically disperse the conidia to a new host. Additionally, the asexual spores can be dispersed by rain splash. Once on the new host, or new area of the tree, the spores can germinate and infect the inner bark through insect wounds and fissures in the outer bark.

If cankers continue to form and expand, the fungus can girdle the stem, severing the flow of nutrients and water to the vital vegetative tissues. The absence of nutrient dispersal will result in above ground tree death. However, the root system may survive. As a result, American chestnuts exist mainly as shrubs sprouting from the old, surviving roots. These sprouts usually die of infection by &quot;C. parasitica&quot; before reaching sexual maturity.

==Management: hypovirulence, sanitation, and chemical control==
In Europe, during the late 1960s, it was found that a strain of &quot;C. parasitica&quot; was less virulent, only able to produce shallow cankers that the tree&#x27;s callus tissue could eventually limit and isolate. The trait of hypovirulence could be transferred from an avirulent strain to a lethal strain through anastomosis—the fusion of hyphae. It was later discovered that this attenuated virulence was due to infection by a dsRNA mycovirus, &quot;Cryphonectria hypovirus 1&quot; (CHV1) of genus &quot;Hypovirus&quot;.

Considering the nature of hypovirulent strains, there has been a strong interest to use them to manage lethal &quot;C. parasitica&quot; strains. In Europe, natural dissemination of hypovirulence in pathogen populations resulted in the restoration of economically valuable chestnuts. Unfortunately, this was not the case in the United States. Compared to Europe, the US has a greater diversity of &quot;C. parasitica&quot; strains. Thus, the spread of the mycovirus in American &quot;C. parasitica&quot; populations is inhibited by vegetative incompatibility, an allorecognition system that inhibits the fusion of hyphae between individuals that are genetically distinct at specific loci. In 2016, however, &quot;super mycovirus donor strains&quot; of &quot;C. parasitica&quot; were engineered to overcome this incompatibility system. This could potentially be employed as a method of biological control.

As mentioned above some soil microorganisms suppress &quot;C. parasitica&quot;. This can be used to treat the cankers, by using a soil compress, a quantity of soil held against the trunk itself with plastic wrap and some adhesive tape around that.

In addition to biocontrol, chestnut blight can also be managed by sanitation practices and chemical control; however, such management strategies are only feasible on a small scale, such as in an orchard. Sanitation practices like the pruning of symptomatic limbs and removal of infected trees can serve to eliminate sources of inoculum and limit the spread of the pathogen.

Additionally, some fungicides may be effective at controlling this fungal disease. A study on the chemical control of chestnut blight in &quot;Castanea sativa&quot;, may have found that the external application of both copper oxychloride and carbendazim could reduce the rate of disease by almost 50%.

==Conservation efforts in North America==
There are approximately 2,500 chestnut trees growing on near West Salem, Wisconsin, which is the world&#x27;s largest remaining stand of American chestnut. These trees are the descendants of those planted by Martin Hicks, an early settler in the area. In the late 1800s, Hicks planted fewer than a dozen chestnuts. Planted outside the natural range of American chestnut, these trees escaped the initial wave of infection by chestnut blight, but in 1987 scientists found blight also in this stand. There is a program to bring American chestnut back to the Eastern forest funded by the American Chestnut Foundation, Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, USDA Forest Service, West Virginia University, Michigan State University, and Cornell University.

Removing blighted trees to control the disease was first attempted when the blight was discovered, but this proved to be an ineffective solution. Scientists then set out to introduce a hyperparasitic hypovirus into the chestnut blight fungus. The trees infected with virus-treated fungus responded immediately and began to heal over their cankers. However, the virus was so efficient at attenuating fungal growth that it prevented the spreading of the virus from an infected fungus growing on one tree to that growing on another tree. Only the virus-treated trees recovered. Scientific opinion regarding the future of the stand varies.

===Hybrid chestnut trees===
Current efforts are underway by the Forest Health Initiative to use modern breeding techniques and genetic engineering to create resistant tree strains, with contributions from SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry, Pennsylvania State University, the University of Georgia, and the United States Forest Service. One of the most successful methods of breeding is to create a back cross of a resistant species (such as one from China or Japan) and American chestnut. Researchers identified two or three genes that allow for blight resistance, and are focusing on giving the American chestnut hybrids only those genes from the Chinese or Japanese chestnut.

The two species are first bred to create a 50/50 hybrid. After three backcrosses with American chestnut, the remaining genome is approximately 1/16 that of the resistant tree and 15/16 American. The strategy is to select blight-resistance genes during the backcrossing while preserving the more wild-type traits of American chestnut as the dominant phenotype. Thus, the newly bred hybrid chestnut trees should reach the same heights as the original American chestnut. Many of these 15/16 American chestnut hybrids have been planted along the East Coast, including in the Jefferson National Forest and on the Flight 93 National Memorial. Some of these sites have had researchers check on the saplings that have been planted to see their survival rate. For the hybrids to do well, they need areas with decent drainage and abundant sunlight. Meeting these needs can be hard to do, so not all restoration areas have been successful with hybrid survival.

===Transgenic blight-resistant chestnut trees===
A 1983 study on hypovirulence had shown that chestnut blight infected with hypovirus produced less oxalic acid when attacking the cambium. Meanwhile, a plant pathologist, Dr. William Powell, had been trying to figure out how to transfer all of the Asian chestnut&#x27;s resistance genetics to its American relatives. In the 1990s, he had the idea to give up on the more complicated and larger job, and instead look around for a single gene elsewhere. (In related work, in 2001 Liang, Mayard, Allen, and Powell successfully inserted an oxalate oxidase (OxO) gene from wheat into &quot;Populus × euramericana&quot; (&quot;Ogy&quot;) for &quot;Septoria musiva&quot; resistance. This enzyme breaks down the oxalic acid secreted by the fungus into carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide.) In 2007, Welch, Stipanovic, Maynard, and Powell showed that transgenic &quot;C. dentata&quot; expressing a wheat OxO indeed had lower lignin degradation by oxalic acid, and suggested this was the path to take.

A few years later this line of research culminated in the final product: Powell and another plant pathologist, Dr. Charles Maynard, working at the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry developed American chestnuts which had heightened blight resistance. Heightened resistance was attained by introducing a wheat OxO gene into the American chestnut genome. (Because an unrelated gene was transferred, this did not make the chestnut trees produce gluten, and the nuts remain gluten free.) The transgenic trees have blight resistance either equal to or surpassing that of &quot;Castanea mollissima&quot;, Chinese chestnuts. 
In 2013, SUNY ESF had over 100 individual events being tested, with more than 400 slated to be in the field or in the lab for various assay tests in the next several years. By 2014, more than 1,000 trees were growing in several field sites. Government approval will be required before returning any of these blight resistant trees to the wild. The New York Botanical Garden has planted several of the transgenic trees for public display. 
At the start, there were few such engineered chestnut trees. For seed multiplication, grafting could work. Normal tree growth requires 6, 7, or even 8 years before a chestnut will flower. However orchard management may accelerate pollen production to 2–3 years (although still without fruiting). Powell&#x27;s lab had been able to use growth chambers with higher light inputs to get duration to pollen production down to less than a year.

The American Chestnut Foundation (TACF) once worked close with SUNY ESF to utilize the Darling 58 in their mission to restore the American chestnut to its native range in the eastern United States. However, in December 2023, TACF withdrew its petition for use as a restorative species due to poor performance and high mortality in Darling 54 saplings. 

==Economic and ecological impact of disease==
In less than fifty years after its emergence, &quot;C. parasitica&quot; virtually eliminated American chestnut as a canopy species in of forest. The chestnut fruit was a major food source for animals in the low elevation Appalachian forests. This loss resulted in a drastic decrease in the squirrel population, the extinction of seven native moth species, and the slowed recovery of deer, Cooper&#x27;s hawk, cougar, and bobcat populations. The effects of this disease also rippled further through the ecosystem, being linked to a decrease in the abundance of cavity-nesting birds and to a decrease in river water quality which negatively affected aquatic invertebrate populations.

In 1912, standing chestnut timber in just three states was estimated to be $82.5 million ($1.9 billion in 2009 dollars) in value. Therefore, in addition to ecological impacts, &quot;C. parasitica&quot; potentially caused a devastating loss in economic welfare for communities dependent on the chestnut tree. Mountaineers, residents of Appalachian Mountain communities, had to drastically alter their lifestyles to cope with the effects of this disease.

Economic effects have also been considerable in Europe, particularly before CHV1 spreads naturally to a region. In Greece for example, the disease forced the migration of people who could no longer afford to live off chestnut trees. It has also led to a 40% decline in Greek chestnut production.

<text>The percussion cap, percussion primer, or caplock, introduced in the early 1820s, is a type of single-use percussion ignition device for muzzle loader firearm locks enabling them to fire reliably in any weather condition. Its invention gave rise to the caplock mechanism or percussion lock system which used percussion caps struck by the hammer to set off the gunpowder charge in rifles and cap and ball firearms. Any firearm using a caplock mechanism is a percussion gun. Any long gun with a cap-lock mechanism and rifled barrel is a percussion rifle. Cap and ball describes cap-lock firearms discharging a single bore-diameter spherical bullet with each shot.

==Description==

The percussion cap is a small cylinder of copper or brass with one closed end. Inside the closed end is a small amount of a shock-sensitive explosive material such as mercuric fulminate (discovered in 1800; it was the only practical detonator used from about the mid-19th century to the early 20th century).

The caplock mechanism consists of a hammer and a &quot;nipple&quot; (sometimes referred to as a &quot;cone&quot;). The nipple contains a hollow conduit which goes into the rearmost part of the gun barrel, and the percussion cap is placed over the nipple hole. Pulling the trigger releases the hammer, which strikes the percussion cap against the nipple (which serves as an anvil), crushes it and detonates the mercury fulminate inside, which releases sparks that travel through the hollow nipple into the barrel and ignite the main powder charge.

Percussion caps have been made in small sizes for pistols and larger sizes for rifles and muskets.

==Origins==
Earlier firearms used flintlock mechanisms causing a piece of flint to strike a steel frizzen producing sparks to ignite a pan of priming powder and thereby fire the gun&#x27;s main powder charge. The flintlock mechanism replaced older ignition systems such as the matchlock and wheellock, but all were prone to misfire in wet weather.

The discovery of fulminates was made by Edward Charles Howard (1774–1816) in 1800. The invention that made the percussion cap possible using the recently discovered fulminates was patented by the Reverend Alexander John Forsyth of Belhelvie, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, in 1807. The rudimentary percussion system was invented by Forsyth as a solution to the problem that birds would startle when smoke puffed from the powder pan of his flintlock shotgun, giving them sufficient warning to escape the shot. This early percussion lock system operated in a nearly identical fashion to flintlock firearms and used a fulminating primer made of fulminate of mercury, chlorate of potash, sulphur and charcoal, ignited by concussion. His invention of a fulminate-primed firing mechanism deprived the birds of their early warning system, both by avoiding the initial puff of smoke from the flintlock powder pan, as well as shortening the interval between the trigger pull and the shot leaving the muzzle. Forsyth patented his &quot;scent bottle&quot; ignition system in 1807. However, it was not until after Forsyth&#x27;s patents expired that the conventional percussion cap system was developed. Joseph Manton invented a precursor to the percussion cap in 1814, comprising a copper tube that detonated when crushed. This was further developed in 1822 by the English-born American artist Joshua Shaw, as a copper cup filled with fulminates.

The first purpose-built caplock guns were fowling pieces commissioned by sportsmen in Regency era England. Due to the mechanism&#x27;s compactness and superior reliability compared to the flintlock, gunsmiths were able to manufacture pistols and long guns with two barrels. Early caplock handguns with two or more barrels and a single lock are known as turn-over or twister pistols, due to the need to manually rotate the second barrel to align with the hammer. With the addition of a third barrel, and a ratchet to mechanically turn the barrels while cocking the hammer, these caplock pistols evolved into the pepper-box revolver during the 1830s.

The caplock offered many improvements over the flintlock. The caplock was easier and quicker to load, more resilient to weather conditions, and far more reliable than the flintlock. Many of the older flintlock weapons were later converted to the caplock, so that they could take advantage of these features.

==Parallel developments==
Joshua Shaw is sometimes credited (primarily by himself) with the development of the first metallic percussion cap in 1814, a reusable one made of iron, then a disposable pewter one in 1815 and finally a copper one in 1816. There is no independent proof of this since Shaw was advised he could not patent it due to Alexander Forsyth&#x27;s patent for using fulminates to ignite guns being in force between 1807 and 1821. Shaw says he only shared the development of his innovation with a few associates (gunmakers and others) who were sworn to secrecy and never provided affidavits at a later date. Shaw&#x27;s claim to have been the inventor remains clouded in controversy as he did not patent the idea until 1822, having moved to America in 1817. According to Lewis Winant, the US government&#x27;s decision to award Shaw $25,000 as compensation for his invention being used by the Army was a mistake. Congress believed Shaw&#x27;s patent was the earliest in the world and awarded him a large sum of money based on this belief. The investigators had overlooked two French patents and the earlier use of the idea in Britain.

The earliest known patent anywhere in the world which specifically mentions a percussion cap and nipple was granted in France on 29 July 1818 to François Prélat, four years before Shaw&#x27;s patent. Prelat made a habit of copying English patents and inventions and the mode of operation he describes is flawed. Secondly a French patent of a percussion cap and nipple had been granted in 1820 to Deboubert. However predating both of these French claims, the most likely inventor of the percussion cap, according to historian Sidney James Gooding, was Joseph Egg (nephew of Durs Egg), around 1817, .

There were other earlier claims. Col. Peter Hawker in 1830 simultaneously claimed and denied being the inventor. &quot;I do not wish to say I was the inventor of it - very probably not&quot; but then immediately recounts that he came up with the idea of simplifying a Manton patch-lock, which could be troublesome, by designing a cap and nipple arrangement around 1816 when the patch lock was patented. He says he then presented a drawing to a reluctant Joseph Manton to make a few copper cap guns which were then sold. Hawker, seems to give Joseph Manton more of the glory eight years later in the 1838 edition of his &#x27;Instructions to young Sportsmen&#x27;, by stating categorically that &quot;copper tubes and primers were decidedly invented by Joe Manton&quot;. By the 1850s Hawker was again claiming the invention for himself in his press advertisements. 

Despite many years of research by Winant, Gooding and De Witt Bailey, the jury is still out as the competing claims are based on personal accounts and have little or no independently verifiable evidence. 

While the metal percussion cap was the most popular and widely used type of primer, their small size made them difficult to handle under the stress of combat or while riding a horse. Accordingly, several manufacturers developed alternative, &quot;auto-priming&quot; systems. The &quot;Maynard tape primer&quot;, for example, used a roll of paper &quot;caps&quot; much like today&#x27;s toy cap gun. The Maynard tape primer was fitted to some firearms used in the mid-nineteenth century and a few saw brief use in the American Civil War. Other disc or pellet-type primers held a supply of tiny fulminate detonator discs in a small magazine. Cocking the hammer automatically advanced a disc into position. However, these automatic feed systems were difficult to make with the manufacturing systems in the early and mid-nineteenth century and generated more problems than they solved. They were quickly shelved in favor of a single percussion cap that, while unwieldy in some conditions, could be carried in sufficient quantities to make up for occasionally dropping one, while a jammed tape primer system would instead reduce the rifle to an awkward club.

==Military firearms==
This invention was gradually improved, and came to be used, first in a steel cap and then in a copper cap, by various gunmakers and private individuals before coming into general military use nearly thirty years later. The alteration of the military flintlock to the percussion musket was easily accomplished by replacing the powder pan and steel frizzen with a nipple and by replacing the cock or hammer that held the flint by a smaller hammer formed with a hollow made to fit around the nipple when released by the trigger. On the nipple was placed the copper cap containing Shaw&#x27;s detonating composition of three parts of chlorate of potash, two of fulminate of mercury and one of powdered glass. The hollow in the hammer contained the fragments of the cap if it fragmented, reducing the risk of injury to the firer&#x27;s eyes. From the 1820s onwards, the armies of Britain, France, Russia, and America began converting their muskets to the new percussion system. Caplocks were generally applied to the British military musket (the Brown Bess) in 1842, a quarter of a century after the invention of percussion powder and after an elaborate government test at Woolwich in 1834. The first percussion firearm produced for the US military was the percussion carbine version (c.1833) of the M1819 Hall rifle. The Americans&#x27; breech loading caplock Hall rifles, muzzle loading rifled muskets and Colt Dragoon revolvers gave them an advantage over the smoothbore flintlock Brown Bess muskets used by Santa Anna&#x27;s troops during the Mexican War. In Japan, matchlock pistols and muskets were converted to percussion from the 1850s onwards, and new guns based on existing designs were manufactured as caplocks.

The Austrians instead used a variant of Manton&#x27;s tube lock in their Augustin musket until the conventional caplock Lorenz rifle was introduced in 1855. The first practical solution for the problem of handling percussion caps in battle was the Prussian 1841 (Dreyse needle gun), which used a long needle to penetrate a paper cartridge filled with black powder and strike the percussion cap that was fastened to the base of the bullet. While it had a number of problems, it was widely used by the Prussians and other German states in the mid-nineteenth century and was a major factor in the 1866 Austro-Prussian War. The needle gun originally fired paper cartridges containing a bullet, powder charge and percussion cap, but by the time of the Franco-Prussian War this had evolved into modern brass ammunition.
==Later firearms evolution==
The percussion cap brought about the invention of the modern cartridge case and made possible the general adoption of the breech-loading principle for all varieties of rifles, shotguns and pistols. After the American Civil War, Britain, France, and America began converting existing caplock guns to accept brass rimfire and centrefire cartridges. For muskets such as the 1853 Enfield and 1861 Springfield, this involved installing a firing pin in place of the nipple, and a trapdoor in the breech to accept the new bullets. Examples include the Trapdoor Springfield, Tabatière rifle, Westley Richards and Snider–Enfield conversions. The British Army used Snider Enfields contemporaneously with the Martini–Henry rifle until the .303 bolt action Lee–Metford repeating rifle was introduced in the 1880s. Later, military surplus Sniders were purchased as hunting and defensive weapons by British colonists and trusted local natives.

Caplock revolvers such as the Colt Navy and Remington were also widely converted during the late 19th century, by replacing the existing cylinder with one designed for modern ammunition. These were used extensively by the Turks in the Russo-Turkish War, the US Cavalry during the Indian Wars, and also by gunfighters, lawmen, and outlaws in the old west.

In the 1840s and 1850s, the percussion cap was first integrated into a metallic cartridge, where the bullet is held in by the casing, the casing is filled with gunpowder, and a primer is placed on the end. By the 1860s and 1870s, breech-loading metallic cartridges had made the percussion cap system obsolete.

Today, reproduction percussion firearms are popular for recreational shooters and percussion caps are still available (though some modern muzzleloaders use shotshell primers instead of caps). Most percussion caps now use non-corrosive compounds such as lead styphnate.

==Other uses==
Caps are used in cartridges, grenades, rocket-propelled grenades and rescue flares. Percussion caps are also used in land mine fuzes, booby-trap firing devices and anti-handling devices. Most purpose-made military booby-trap firing devices contain some form of spring-loaded firing pin designed to strike a percussion cap connected to a detonator at one end. The detonator is inserted into an explosive charge—e.g., C-4 or a block of TNT. Triggering the booby-trap (e.g., by pulling on a trip-wire) releases the cocked firing pin that flips forward to strike the percussion cap, firing it and the attached detonator; the shock-wave from the detonator sets off the main explosive charge.

<text>Thoroughbred racing is a sport and industry involving the racing of Thoroughbred horses. It is governed by different national bodies. There are two forms of the sport – flat racing and jump racing, the latter known as National Hunt racing in the UK and steeplechasing in the US. Jump racing can be further divided into hurdling and steeplechasing.

According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, the racing of Thoroughbreds has been steadily declining in popularity worldwide. Between 700 and 800 racehorses die in racing each year. 

==Ownership and training of racehorses==
Traditionally, racehorses have been owned by wealthy individuals. It has become increasingly common in the last few decades for horses to be owned by syndicates or partnerships. Notable examples include the 2005 Epsom Derby winner Motivator, owned by the Royal Ascot Racing Club, 2003 Kentucky Derby winner Funny Cide, owned by a group of 10 partners organized as Sackatoga Stable, and 2008 Kentucky Derby winner Big Brown, owned by IEAH stables, a horse racing hedgefund organization.

Historically, most race horses have been bred and raced by their owners. Beginning after World War II, the commercial breeding industry became significantly more important in North America, Europe and Australasia, the result of which being that a substantial portion of Thoroughbreds are now sold by their breeders, either at public auction or through private sales. Additionally, owners may acquire Thoroughbreds by &quot;claiming&quot; them out of a race (see discussion of types of races below).

A horse runs in the unique colours of its owner. These colours must be registered under the national governing bodies and no two owners may have the same colours. The rights to certain colour arrangements (&quot;cherished colours&quot;) are valuable in the same way that distinctive car registration numbers are of value. It is said that Sue Magnier (owner of George Washington, Galileo etc.) paid £50,000 for her distinctive dark blue colours. If an owner has more than one horse running in the same race then some slight variant in colours is often used (normally a different coloured cap) or the race club colours may be used.

The horse owner typically pays a monthly retainer or, in North America, a &quot;day rate&quot; to his or her trainer, together with fees for use of the training center or gallops (if the horse is not stabled at a race track), veterinarian and farrier (horseshoer) fees and other expenses such as mortality insurance premiums, stakes entry fees and jockeys&#x27; fees. The typical cost of owning a race horse in training for one year is in the order of £15,000 in the United Kingdom and as much as $35,000 at major race tracks in North America.

The facilities available to trainers vary enormously. Some trainers have only a few horses in the yard and pay to use other trainers&#x27; gallops. Other trainers have every conceivable training asset. It is a feature of racing that a modest establishment often holds its own against the bigger players even in a top race. This is particularly true of national hunt racing.

==Values==
In 1976, Canadian Bound became the first Thoroughbred yearling racehorse ever to be sold for more than US$1 million when he was purchased at the Keeneland July sale by Canadians, Ted Burnett and John Sikura Jr.

==Organizations==

===Jockey clubs===
Per the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; the concept of a jockey club dates to at least 1775 and is, in the generic, a &quot;club or association for the promotion and regulation of horse racing.&quot; There are scores of national and regional jockey clubs, also called racing associations, worldwide. In addition to thoroughbreds, jockey clubs may race standardbred horses, Quarter Horses, or Arabians.

===Ireland===
Racing is governed on an All-Ireland basis, with two bodies sharing organising responsibility. The Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board is the rulemaking and enforcement body, whilst Horse Racing Ireland governs and promotes racing. In 2013, Ireland exported more than 4,800 Thoroughbreds to 37 countries worldwide with a total value in excess of €205 million ($278 million). This is double the number of horses exported annually from the U.S.

===Great Britain===
In Great Britain, Thoroughbred horse racing is governed by the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) which makes and enforces the rules, issues licences or permits to trainers and jockeys, and runs the races through their race course officials. The Jockey Club in the UK has been released from its regulatory function but still performs various supporting roles.

A significant part of the BHA&#x27;s work relates to the disciplining of trainers and jockeys, including appeals from decisions made by the course stewards. Disciplinary enquiries usually relate to the running of a horse, for example: failure to run a horse on its merits, interference with other runners, excessive use of the whip. The emergence of internet betting exchanges has created opportunities for the public to lay horses and this development has been associated with some high-profile disciplinary proceedings.

In order to run under rules a horse must be registered at Weatherbys as a Thoroughbred. It must also reside permanently at the yard of a trainer licensed by the BHA or a permit holder. Similarly the horse&#x27;s owner or owners must be registered as owners.

===Australia===
Thoroughbred racing is governed on a state-by-state basis in Australia. Racing NSW administers racing in New South Wales, Racing Victoria is the responsible entity in Victoria, the Brisbane Racing Club was an amalgamation in 2009 of the Queensland Turf Club and Brisbane Racing Club, and administers racing in Queensland.

Flemington Racecourse in Melbourne is home to the Melbourne Cup, the richest &quot;two-mile&quot; handicap in the world, and one of the richest turf races. The race is held on the first Tuesday in November during the Spring Racing Carnival, and is publicised in Australia as &quot;the race that stops a nation&quot;.

===United States===
In the United States, safety regulations and drug restrictions are primarily controlled at the federal level by the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority. Other aspects of racing regulation are highly fragmented. Generally, a racing commission or other state government entity in each U.S. state that conducts racing will license owners, trainers and others involved in the industry, set racing dates, and oversee wagering. Pedigree matters and the registration of racing colors are the province of The Jockey Club, which maintains the American Stud Book and approves the names of all Thoroughbreds.

The National Steeplechase Association is the official sanctioning body of American steeplechase horse racing.

===Canada===
Regulation of horse racing in Canada is under the Jockey Club of Canada. There are a few racing venues across Canada, but the major events are mainly in Ontario and managed by the Woodbine Entertainment Group, formerly Ontario Jockey Club. While British Columbia&#x27;s major venue is Hastings Racecourse with popular events like the annual BC Derby.

==Types of racing==
Thoroughbred racing is divided into two codes: flat racing and jump races. The most significant races are categorised as Group races or Graded stakes races. Every governing body is free to set its own standards, so the quality of races may differ. Horses are also run under different conditions, for example Handicap races, Weight for Age races or Scale-Weight. Although handicapping is generally seen as serving the purpose of gambling rather than identifying the fastest horses, some of the best known races in the world, such as the Grand National or Melbourne Cup are run as handicaps.

===Flat racing===

Flat races can be run under varying distances and on different terms. Historically, the major flat racing countries were Australia, England, Ireland, France and the United States, but other countries, such as Japan and the United Arab Emirates, have emerged in recent decades. Some countries and regions have a long tradition as major breeding centers, namely Ireland and Kentucky.

In Europe and Australia, virtually all major races are run on turf (grass) courses, while in the United States, dirt surfaces (or, lately, artificial surfaces such as Polytrack) are prevalent. In Canada, South America and Asia, both surface types are common.

===Jump racing===
Jump races and steeplechases, called National Hunt racing in the United Kingdom and Ireland, are run over long distances, usually from up to , and horses carry more weight. Many jump racers, especially those bred in France, are not Thoroughbreds, being classified as AQPS. Novice jumping races involve horses that are starting out a jumping career, including horses that previously were trained in flat racing. National Hunt racing is distinguished between hurdles races and chases: the former are run over low obstacles and the latter over larger fences that are much more difficult to jump. National Hunt races are started by flag, which means that horses line up at the start behind a tape. Jump racing is popular in the UK, Ireland, France and parts of Central Europe, but only a minor sport or completely unknown in most other regions of the world. National Hunt flat races (or &quot;bumpers&quot;) without fences or hurdles are also staged to provide experience for horses which have not taken part in flat racing.

==Horse breeding==
In the world&#x27;s major Thoroughbred racing countries, breeding of racehorses is a huge industry providing over a million jobs worldwide. While the attention of horseracing fans and the media is focused almost exclusively on the horse&#x27;s performance on the racetrack or for male horses, possibly its success as a sire, little publicity is given to the brood mares. Such is the case of La Troienne, one of the most important mares of the 20th century to whom many of the greatest Thoroughbred champions, and dams of champions can be traced.

==Types of races==
*A handicap race is one in which the runners have been &quot;handicapped&quot; by carrying more weight, also called an impost, according to their performance in other races. Theoretically, all horses have a chance of being competitive in a race that is correctly handicapped. Examples include the Melbourne Cup, the Grand National, the Cambridgeshire Handicap, the Donn Handicap, the Santa Anita Handicap, the Hollywood Gold Cup, the Auckland Cup, the Easter Handicap, and the Caulfield Cup.
*Higher-class races for bigger prizes are known by different terms in various countries—graded stakes races in the United States and Canada, conditions races in England and France, and group races in Australia and New Zealand. They often involve competitors that belong to the same gender, age and class. These races may, though, be &quot;weight-for-age&quot;, with weights adjusted only according to age, and also there are &quot;set weights&quot; where all horses carry the same weight. Furthermore, there are &quot;conditions&quot; races, in which horses carry weights that are set by conditions, such as having won a certain number of races, or races of a certain value. Examples of a stakes/conditions race are the Breeders&#x27; Cup races, the Dubai World Cup, the 2,000 Guineas Stakes, the 1,000 Guineas Stakes, The Derby, The Oaks, the St. Leger Stakes, the Kentucky Derby, the Kentucky Oaks, the Preakness Stakes, the Belmont Stakes, the Travers Stakes, and the Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe.
*A maiden race is one in which the runners have never won a race. Maiden races can be among horses of many different age groups. It is similar to a stakes race in the respect that horses all carry similar weights and there are no handicapped &quot;penalties.&quot; This is the primary method for racing a 2 year old for the first time, although only against other 2 year olds. Three-year-olds also only race against their own age in maiden races early in the year.
*An allowance race is one in which the runners run for a higher purse than in a maiden race. These races usually involve conditions such as &quot;non-winner of three lifetime.&quot; They usually are for a horse which has broken its maiden but is not ready for stakes company.
*A claiming race is one in which the horses are all for sale for more or less the same price (the &quot;claiming price&quot;) up until shortly before the race. The intent of this is to even the race; if a better-than-class horse is entered (with the expectation of an easy purse win), it might be lost for the claiming price, which is likely less than the horse is worth. Someone may wish to claim a horse if they think the horse has not been trained to its fullest potential under another trainer. If a horse is purchased, a track official tags it after the race, and it goes to its new owner.
*A selling race, or seller, is one in which the winner is put up for auction immediately after the race.
*An optional claiming race is a hybrid of allowance and claiming race, developed to increase field sizes. A horse who does not fit the conditions can still &quot;run for the tag&quot;, i.e. be run conditional on also being offered for sale.
*A Sweepstakes is an old-fashioned term (now usually abbreviated to &quot;Stakes&quot;) for a race in which the winning owner wins, or &quot;sweeps&quot; the entry fees paid by the owners of all the other horses entered.

<doc id="67747" wikidata="Q7270080" url="?curid=67747" title="King's Plate">
<text>The King&#x27;s Plate (known as the Queen&#x27;s Plate from 1860 to 1901 and 1952 to 2022) is Canada&#x27;s oldest thoroughbred horse race and the oldest continuously run race in North America, having been founded in 1860. It is run at a distance of for a maximum of 17 three-year-old thoroughbred horses foaled in Canada.

The race is the first in the Canadian Triple Crown, typically taking place each summer at Woodbine Racetrack in Etobicoke, Ontario. The event was scheduled in June or July until 2020, when it was postponed to September, due to government-imposed restrictions in place through the COVID-19 pandemic. Since 2021, Woodbine ran the Queen&#x27;s Plate, and now runs the King&#x27;s Plate, in August.

The race&#x27;s name reflects the title of the reigning Canadian monarch, following on Queen Victoria&#x27;s donation of the first cup. The Woodbine Entertainment Group, which owns and operates the event, announced in December 2022 the race would be renamed the &quot;King&#x27;s Plate&quot;, following the accession of King Charles III on 8 September 2022.

==History==
In 1859, the then-President of the Toronto Turf Club, Sir Casimir Gzowski, petitioned Queen Victoria to grant a plate for a new race in the Canada West (today Ontario). With the monarch&#x27;s approval, the first Queen&#x27;s Plate was run on 27 June 1860, at the Carleton racetrack in Toronto, with the prize of &quot;a plate to the value of 50 guineas&quot;. Despite the name, the winning owner is presented with a gold cup, rather than a plate.

The race was originally restricted to three-year-olds bred in Canada that had never won a stakes race and was run in heats, with a horse having to win two heats to be declared the winner. The race conditions have since evolved; heat racing was discontinued in 1879 and, around the same time, the race was opened to stakes winners (some early records are incomplete). For many years, the race was open to older horses and, in the early 1900s, was even open to two-year-olds. The King&#x27;s Plate is currently restricted to three-year-olds foaled in Canada. The owner must pay a nomination fee ($500 in 2018) in February, a second subscription fee ($1,500 in 2018) in May, and a final entry fee ($10,000) prior to the race.
The first four renewals were run at Carleton racetrack. After that, the Queen&#x27;s Plate became a &quot;movable feast&quot;, with politicians from all over modern-day Ontario vying to host the race in their constituency. Fifteen different race tracks hosted the race over the next two decades, with distances varying from one to two miles. In 1883, the race moved to Old Woodbine, located in eastern Toronto along Lake Ontario. The race continued to be held at Old Woodbine until that track was replaced by &quot;New&quot; Woodbine in northern Toronto in 1956. The race has been run at Woodbine ever since. In 2006, Woodbine changed the track surface for the main track from natural dirt to a synthetic surface known as Polytrack. In 2016, the surface was changed to Tapeta. Because of the change in racing surfaces, Woodbine maintains several sets of track and stakes records. The fastest time for the race on the original dirt surface at the current distance is 2:01 4/5, set by Kinghaven Farms&#x27; Izvestia in 1990. The current stakes record (the fastest all-time) is 2:01.48, set by Moira in 2022 on Tapeta.
In 1902, the year after Victoria&#x27;s death, the race became the King&#x27;s Plate, after her successor, Edward VII. It became the Queen&#x27;s Plate again during the reign of Elizabeth II (1952–2022). In 2022, it reverted to the King&#x27;s Plate upon the accession of Charles III.

Horses owned by Windfields Farm have won the Plate eleven times, but the most successful was the stable owned by Joseph E. Seagram, a prominent distiller from Waterloo, Ontario. Seagram&#x27;s stable won the Plate on twenty occasions between 1891 and 1935 including eight times in a row between 1891 and 1898, and ten times in eleven years from 1891 to 1901.

At the 1925 King&#x27;s Plate, W. A. Hewitt and his son Foster Hewitt called the first horse race broadcast on radio.

In 1964, Northern Dancer, the first Canadian-bred horse to win the Kentucky Derby, also won the Queen&#x27;s Plate in his final race.

In 2006, Josie Carroll became the first woman trainer to win the Queen&#x27;s Plate. The following year, Emma-Jayne Wilson became the first female jockey to win the race.

The 2004-2013 Plate winners had little success in their subsequent racing careers. This compares unfavourably to the 1990s when a number of Plate winners had considerable success thereafter, including With Approval, Izvestia, Dance Smartly and Awesome Again. The more recent Queen&#x27;s Plate winners have also been successful, including Lexie Lou (who became a multiple graded stakes winner in Canada and the US after winning the Plate in 2014) and Shaman Ghost (a Grade I winner in America after winning the Plate in 2015).

Nick Eaves, former President and CEO of Woodbine Entertainment Group, announced during the 2012 Queen&#x27;s Plate post position draw that Woodbine Racetrack might be forced to close in April 2013 due to the cancellation of Slots at Racetrack program partnerships between Ontario&#x27;s racetracks and the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation. Eaves said that if Woodbine is not open, &quot;there won&#x27;t be a Queen&#x27;s Plate.&quot; A new funding agreement was put in place in March 2013, which ensured the continuation of horse racing at Woodbine.

39 fillies have won the Plate, beginning with Brunette in 1864. The 2017 running was won by filly Holy Helena, while the 2018 running was won by Wonder Gadot. Two chestnut fillies both by the name of Wild Rose have won the Queen&#x27;s Plate, in 1867 and 1886. They were the daughter and great-great-granddaughter respectively of Yellow Rose, who also produced the first Queen&#x27;s Plate winner Don Juan.

The latest filly to win the Queen&#x27;s Plate was Caitlinhergrtness in 2024.

The race has been held at a variety of distances:
* 1860–1867: heats
* 1868–1870: 
* 1871: miles (2.82 km)
* 1872–1886: miles (2.4 km)
* 1887–1923: miles (2.01 km)
* 1924–1956: miles (1.811 km)
* 1957-: miles (2.01 km)

===Triple Crown dispute with Fort Erie Race Track===
Since 2021, a year after the Queen&#x27;s Plate was moved to September from its usual June or July spot due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, Woodbine has run the race in August. As a result, Fort Erie Race Track, which runs the second of Canada&#x27;s Triple Crown races, the Prince of Wales Stakes, moved their race to after the King&#x27;s Plate. In April 2023, a few months after Woodbine announced that the 2023 King&#x27;s Plate would again be run in August, Fort Erie filed a grievance with the Canadian Trade Commission over what it called business practices that were &quot;unfair and clearly predatory.&quot; A member of the Fort Erie Council suggested that the COVID pandemic was over and that the King&#x27;s Plate should move back to June, adding that continuing to run the race in August would not be in Fort Erie Race Track&#x27;s best economic interests, as it would result in the Prince of Wales Stakes being run after Labour Day, when the key summer tourism season is over. Woodbine responded that Fort Erie&#x27;s allegations are &quot;baseless and without merit&quot; and that they would defend themselves if requested by the Trade Commission.

==Royal patronage==

As King of Canada, Charles III is patron of the event. Various other members of the Canadian royal family have attended, beginning with John Campbell, Marquess of Lorne, and his wife, Princess Louise, in 1881, when Lorne was serving as governor general of Canada and the couple was touring Ontario. Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s fourth and final visit to the race was in early July 2010.

<text>Mike Nichols (born Igor Mikhail Peschkowsky; November 6, 1931 – November 19, 2014) was an American film and theatre director and comedian. He worked across a range of genres and had an aptitude for getting the best out of actors regardless of their experience. He is one of 21 people to have won all four of the major American entertainment awards: Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony (EGOT). His other honors included three BAFTA Awards, the Lincoln Center Gala Tribute in 1999, the National Medal of Arts in 2001, the Kennedy Center Honors in 2003 and the AFI Life Achievement Award in 2010. His films received a total of 42 Academy Award nominations, and seven wins.

Nichols began his career in the 1950s with the comedy improvisational troupe The Compass Players, predecessor of The Second City, in Chicago. He then teamed up with his improv partner, Elaine May, to form the comedy duo Nichols and May. Their live improv act was a hit on Broadway, and each of their three albums was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album; their second album, &quot;An Evening with Mike Nichols and Elaine May&quot;, won the award in 1962. After they disbanded, he began directing plays, and quickly became known for his innovative theatre productions.

His Broadway directing debut was Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;Barefoot in the Park&quot; in 1963, with Robert Redford and Elizabeth Ashley. He continued to direct plays on Broadway, including &quot;Luv&quot; (1964), and &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; (1965) for each of which he received Tony Awards. He won his sixth Tony Award for Best Direction of a Play with a revival of Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; (2012) starring Philip Seymour Hoffman. His final directing credit was the revival of Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;Betrayal&quot; (2013). Nichols directed and/or produced more than 25 Broadway plays throughout his prolific career.

Warner Bros. invited Nichols to direct his first film, &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; (1966), followed by &quot;The Graduate&quot; (1967) for which Nichols won the Academy Award for Best Director. Nichols also directed &quot;Catch-22&quot; (1970), &quot;Carnal Knowledge&quot; (1971), &quot;The Day of the Dolphin&quot; (1973), &quot;Silkwood&quot; (1983), &quot;Working Girl&quot; (1988), &quot;Postcards from the Edge&quot; (1990), &quot;The Birdcage&quot; (1996), &quot;Primary Colors&quot; (1998), &quot;Closer&quot; (2004), and &quot;Charlie Wilson&#x27;s War&quot; (2007). Nichols also directed the HBO television film &quot;Wit&quot; (2001), and miniseries &quot;Angels in America&quot; (2003), both of which won him the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie.

==Early life==
Nichols was born Igor Mikhail Peschkowsky on November 6, 1931, in Berlin, Germany. He was a son of Brigitte Claudia (née Landauer) and Pavel Peschkowsky, a physician. His father was born in Vienna, Austria, to a Russian-Jewish immigrant family. Nichols&#x27; father&#x27;s family had been wealthy and lived in Siberia, leaving after the Russian Revolution, and settling in Germany around 1920. Nichols&#x27; mother&#x27;s family were German Jews. His maternal grandparents were Gustav Landauer, a leading theorist on anarchism, and author Hedwig Lachmann.

Around age four, Nichols had lost his hair following an allergic reaction to an inoculation for whooping cough; consequently, when he reached adulthood he wore wigs and false eyebrows for the rest of his life.

In April 1939, when the Nazis were arresting Jews in Berlin, seven-year-old Mikhail and his three-year-old brother Robert were sent alone to the United States to join their father, who had fled months earlier. His mother joined the family by escaping through Italy in 1940. The family moved to New York City on April 28, 1939. His father, whose original name was Pavel Nikolaevich Peschkowsky, changed his name to Paul Nichols, Nichols derived from his Russian patronymic. Before Paul Nichols had received his U.S. medical license, he was employed by a union on 42nd Street, X-raying union members. He later had a successful medical practice in Manhattan, enabling the family to live near Central Park.

Before he established his practice, he was a union doctor, and part of his job was X-raying union members. They didn&#x27;t know about shielding X-ray machines, and he died of leukemia at 44. [in 1944]
:– Mike Nichols

In 1944, Mike Nichols became a naturalized citizen of the United States and attended public elementary school in Manhattan (PS 87). After graduating from the Walden School, a private progressive school on Central Park West, Nichols briefly attended New York University before dropping out. In 1950, he enrolled in the pre-med program at the University of Chicago. He later described this college period as &quot;paradise&quot;, recalling how &quot;I never had a friend from the time I came to this country until I got to the University of Chicago.&quot;

While in Chicago in 1953, Nichols joined the staff of struggling classical music station WFMT, 98.7 FM, as an announcer. Co-owner Rita Jacobs asked Nichols to create a folk music program on Saturday nights, which he named &quot;The Midnight Special&quot;. He hosted the program for two years before leaving for New York City. Nichols frequently invited musicians to perform live in the studio and eventually created a unique blend of &quot;folk music and farce, showtunes and satire, odds and ends&quot;, along with his successor Norm Pellegrini. The program celebrated its 70th anniversary in the same time slot in 2023.

==Comedy career==
Nichols first saw Elaine May when she was sitting in the front row while he was playing the lead in a Chicago production of &quot;Miss Julie,&quot; and they made eye contact. Weeks later he ran into her in a train station where he started a conversation in an assumed accent, pretending to be a spy, and she played along, using another accent. They hit it off immediately, which led to a brief romance. Later in his career, he said &quot;Elaine was very important to me from the moment I saw her.&quot;

In 1953, Nichols left Chicago for New York City to study method acting under Lee Strasberg, but was unable to find stage work there. He was invited back to join Chicago&#x27;s Compass Players in 1955, the predecessor to Chicago&#x27;s Second City, whose members included May, Shelley Berman, Del Close, and Nancy Ponder, directed by Paul Sills. In Chicago, he started doing improvisational routines with May, which eventually led to the formation of the comedy duo Nichols and May in 1958, first performing in New York City.

They performed live satirical comedy acts and eventually released three records of their routines, which became best-sellers. They also appeared in nightclubs and were on radio and television. Jack Rollins, who later became Woody Allen&#x27;s manager and producer, invited them to audition and was most impressed: &quot;Their work was so startling, so new, as fresh as could be. I was stunned by how really good they were, actually as impressed by their acting technique as by their comedy ... I thought, My God, these are two people writing hilarious comedy on their feet!&quot;

In 1960, Nichols and May opened the Broadway show &quot;An Evening With Mike Nichols and Elaine May&quot;, directed by Arthur Penn. The LP album of the show won the 1962 Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album. Personal idiosyncrasies and tensions, such as on the unsuccessful &quot;A Matter of Position&quot;, a play written by May and starring Nichols, eventually drove the duo apart to pursue other projects in 1961. About their sudden breakup, director Arthur Penn said, &quot;They set the standard and then they had to move on,&quot; while talk show host Dick Cavett said &quot;they were one of the comic meteors in the sky.&quot; Comedy historian Gerald Nachman describes the effect of their break-up on American comedy:

They later reconciled and worked together many times. They appeared together at President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s inaugural gala, in 1977, and in a 1980 New Haven stage revival of &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; with Swoosie Kurtz and James Naughton. May scripted Nichols&#x27;s films &quot;The Birdcage&quot; (1996) and &quot;Primary Colors&quot; (1998). In 2010, at the AFI&#x27;s &quot;Life Achievement Award&quot; ceremony, May gave a humor-filled tribute to Nichols.

==Career as a director==
===1960–1970: Broadway debut and film breakthrough ===

Pre-film stage career

After the professional split with May, Nichols went to Vancouver, British Columbia, to work in the theater directing a production of Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; and acted in a revival of George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;St. Joan&quot;. In 1963, Nichols was chosen to direct Neil Simon&#x27;s play &quot;Barefoot in the Park&quot;. He realized at once that he was meant to be a director, saying in a 2003 interview: &quot;On the first day of rehearsal, I thought, &#x27;Well, look at this. Here is what I was meant to do.&#x27; I knew instantly that I was home&quot;. &quot;Barefoot in the Park&quot; was a big hit, running for 1,530 performances and earning Nichols a Tony Award for his direction.

This began a series of highly successful plays on Broadway (often from works by Simon) that would establish his reputation. After directing an off-Broadway production of Ann Jellicoe&#x27;s &quot;The Knack&quot;, Nichols directed Murray Schisgal&#x27;s play &quot;Luv&quot; in 1964. Again the show was a hit and Nichols won a Tony Award (shared with &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;). In 1965 he directed another play by Neil Simon, &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;. The original production starred Art Carney as Felix Ungar and Walter Matthau as Oscar Madison. The play ran for 966 performances and won Tony Awards for Nichols, Simon and Matthau. Overall, Nichols won nine Tony Awards: including six for Best Director of either a play or a musical, one for Best Play, and one for Best Musical.

Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?

In 1966, Nichols was a star stage director and &quot;Time&quot; magazine called him &quot;the most in-demand director in the American theatre.&quot; Although he had no experience in filmmaking, after befriending Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, Warner Bros. invited Nichols to direct a screen adaptation of Edward Albee&#x27;s &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; starring Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, George Segal, and Sandy Dennis for which he received a fee of $400,000. The film was critically acclaimed, with critics calling Nichols &quot;the new Orson Welles&quot;, and a financial success, the number 1 film of 1966.

The film was considered groundbreaking for having a level of profanity and sexual innuendo unheard of at that time. It won five Academy Awards and garnered thirteen nominations (including Nichols&#x27;s first nomination for Best Director), earning the distinctions of being one of only two films nominated in every eligible category at the Oscars (the other being &quot;Cimarron&quot;), and the first film to have its entire credited cast nominated for acting Oscars. It also won three BAFTA Awards and was later ranked No. 67 in &quot;AFI&#x27;s 100 Years ... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)&quot;.

The Graduate

His next film was &quot;The Graduate&quot; (1967), starring Dustin Hoffman, Anne Bancroft and Katharine Ross for which he was paid $150,000, a deal he had made four years earlier with producer Joseph E. Levine. It became the highest-grossing film of 1967 and one of the highest-grossing films in history up to that date, with Nichols receiving 16⅔% of the profits, making him a millionaire. It was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, with Nichols winning as Best Director. In 2007, it was ranked #17 in &quot;AFI&#x27;s 100 Years ... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)&quot;.

However, getting the film made was difficult for Nichols, who, while noted for being a successful Broadway director, was still an unknown in Hollywood. Producer Lawrence Turman, who wanted only Nichols to direct it, was continually turned down for financing. He then contacted Levine, who said he would finance the film because he had associated with Nichols on &quot;The Knack&quot;, and because he heard that Elizabeth Taylor specifically wanted Nichols to direct her and Richard Burton in &quot;Virginia Woolf&quot;. With financing assured, Nichols suggested Buck Henry for screenwriter, although Henry&#x27;s experience had also been mostly in improvised comedy, and had no writing background. Nichols said to Henry, &quot;I think you could do it; I think you &quot;should&quot; do it.&quot;

Nichols also took a chance on using Dustin Hoffman, who had no film experience, for the lead, when others had suggested using known star Robert Redford. Hoffman credits Nichols for having taken a great risk in giving him, a relative unknown, the starring role: &quot;I don&#x27;t know of another instance of a director at the height of his powers who would take a chance and cast someone like me in that part. It took tremendous courage.&quot; The quality of the cinematography was also influenced by Nichols, who chose Oscar winner Robert Surtees to do the photography. Surtees, who had photographed major films since the 1920s, including &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;, said later, &quot;It took everything I had learned over 30 years to be able to do the job. I knew that Mike Nichols was a young director who went in for a lot of camera. We did more things in this picture than I ever did in one film.&quot;
Nichols also chose the music by Simon and Garfunkel. When Paul Simon was taking too long to write new songs for the film, he used existing songs, originally planning to replace them with newly written ones. In the end only one new song was available, and Nichols used the existing previously released songs. At one point, when Nichols heard Paul Simon&#x27;s song, &quot;Mrs. Roosevelt&quot;, he suggested to Simon that he change it to &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot;. The song won a Grammy after the film was released and became America&#x27;s number 1 pop song. Nichols selected all the numerous songs for the film and chose which scenes they would be used in. The placement and selection of songs would affect the way audiences understood the film. Even actor William Daniels, who played Hoffman&#x27;s father, remembers that after first hearing the songs, especially &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot;, he thought, &quot;Oh, wait a minute. That changed the whole idea of the picture for me,&quot; suddenly realizing the film would not be a typical comedy.

Nichols had previously returned to Broadway to direct &quot;The Apple Tree&quot;, starring Second City alumna, Barbara Harris. After doing &quot;The Graduate&quot;, he again returned to the Broadway stage with a revival of Lillian Hellman&#x27;s &quot;The Little Foxes&quot; in 1967, which ran for 100 performances. He then directed Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;Plaza Suite&quot; in 1968, earning him another Tony Award for Best Director. He also directed the short film &quot;Teach Me!&quot; (1968), which starred actress Sandy Dennis. In 1969 his film production company, Friwaftt, was acquired by Avco Embassy, the distributor of &quot;The Graduate&quot;, who also appointed him to the board of directors. Friwaftt stood for &quot;Fools rush in where angels fear to tread.&quot;

Nichols&#x27;s next film was a big-budget adaptation of Joseph Heller&#x27;s novel &quot;Catch-22&quot; (1970), followed by &quot;Carnal Knowledge&quot; (1971) starring Jack Nicholson, Ann-Margret, Art Garfunkel and Candice Bergen. &quot;Carnal Knowledge&quot; was highly controversial upon release because of the casual and blunt depiction of sexual intercourse. In Georgia, a theatre manager was convicted in 1972 of violating the state&#x27;s obscenity statutes by showing the film, a conviction later overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in &quot;Jenkins v. Georgia&quot;.

===1971–1989: Rise to prominence and stardom ===

Nichols returned to Broadway to direct Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;The Prisoner of Second Avenue&quot; in 1971. The play won Nichols another Tony Award for Best Director. In 1973, Nichols directed a revival of Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; on Broadway starring George C. Scott and with a new translation by himself and Albert Todd. In 1973 Nichols directed the film &quot;The Day of the Dolphin&quot; starring George C. Scott, based on the French novel &quot;Un animal doué de raison&quot; (lit. &quot;A Sentient Animal&quot;) by Robert Merle and adapted by Buck Henry. The film was not successful financially and received mixed reviews from critics. Nichols next directed &quot;The Fortune&quot; (1975), starring Warren Beatty, Jack Nicholson and Stockard Channing. Again, the film was a financial failure and received mostly negative reviews. In 1975, Nichols began filming &quot;Bogart Slept Here&quot;, an original screenplay by Neil Simon. The film starred Robert De Niro and Simon&#x27;s wife, Marsha Mason. After one week of filming, displeased with the results, Nichols and the studio fired De Niro and shut the production down. Simon would retool the script two years later as &quot;The Goodbye Girl&quot;. Nichols would not direct another narrative feature film for eight years.

Nichols returned to the stage with two moderately successful productions in 1976; David Rabe&#x27;s &quot;Streamers&quot; opened in April and ran for 478 performances. Trevor Griffiths&#x27;s &quot;Comedians&quot; ran for 145 performances. In 1976 Nichols also worked as Executive Producer to create the television drama &quot;Family&quot; for ABC. The series ran until 1980. In 1977, Nichols produced the original Broadway production of the hugely successful musical &quot;Annie&quot;, which ran for 2,377 performances until 1983. Nichols won the Tony Award for Best Musical. Later in 1977, Nichols directed D.L. Coburn&#x27;s &quot;The Gin Game&quot;. The play ran for 517 performances and won a Tony Award for Best Actress for Jessica Tandy.

In 1980, Nichols directed the documentary &quot;Gilda Live&quot;, a filmed performance of comedian Gilda Radner&#x27;s one-woman show &quot;Gilda Radner Live on Broadway&quot;. It was released at the same time as the album of the show, both of which were successful. Nichols was then involved with two unsuccessful shows: he produced &quot;Billy Bishop Goes to War&quot;, which opened in 1980 and closed after only twelve performances, and directed Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;Fools&quot;, in 1981, which closed after forty performances. Returning to Hollywood, Nichols&#x27;s career rebounded in 1983 with the film &quot;Silkwood&quot;, starring Meryl Streep, Cher and Kurt Russell, based on the life of whistleblower Karen Silkwood. The film was a financial and critical success, with film critic Vincent Canby calling it &quot;the most serious work Mike Nichols has yet done.&quot; The film received five Academy Award nominations, including a Best Director nomination for Nichols.

That same year, Nichols and Peter Stone helped to fix up and rewrite the musical &quot;My One and Only&quot; just days before its Boston premiere. The show eventually went to Broadway and ran for 767 performances, winning Tony Awards for Best Actor, Best Choreography (both for Tommy Tune) and Best Supporting Actor (Charles &quot;Honi&quot; Coles). In 1984, Nichols directed the Broadway premiere of Tom Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;The Real Thing&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Frank Rich wrote that &quot;The Broadway version of &quot;The Real Thing&quot;—a substantial revision of the original London production—is not only Mr. Stoppard&#x27;s most moving play, but also the most bracing play that anyone has written about love and marriage in years.&quot; The play was nominated for seven Tony Awards and won five, including a Best Director Tony for Nichols. Nichols followed the success with the Broadway premiere of David Rabe&#x27;s &quot;Hurlyburly&quot;, also in 1984. It was performed just two blocks away from the theater showing &quot;The Real Thing&quot;. It was nominated for three Tony Awards and won Best Actress for Judith Ivey.
In 1983, Nichols had seen comedian Whoopi Goldberg&#x27;s one woman show, &quot;The Spook Show&quot;, at Dance Theater Workshop and wanted to help her expand it. Goldberg&#x27;s self-titled Broadway show opened in October 1984 and ran for 156 performances. Rosie O&#x27;Donnell later said that Nichols had discovered Goldberg while she was struggling as a downtown artist: &quot;He gave her the entire beginning of her career and recognized her brilliance before anyone else.&quot; In 1986 Nichols directed the Broadway premiere of Andrew Bergman&#x27;s &quot;Social Security&quot; and in 1988 directed &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;, starring Robin Williams and Steve Martin. Williams cited Nichols and May as among his early influences for performing intelligent comedy.

In 1986, Nichols directed the film &quot;Heartburn&quot;, which received mixed reviews, and starred Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson. In 1988, Nichols completed two feature films. The first was an adaptation of Neil Simon&#x27;s autobiographical stage play &quot;Biloxi Blues&quot; starring Matthew Broderick, also receiving mixed critical reviews. Nichols directed one of his most successful films, &quot;Working Girl&quot;, which starred Melanie Griffith, Harrison Ford and Sigourney Weaver. The film was a huge hit upon its release, and received mostly positive reviews from critics. It was nominated for six Academy Awards (including Best Director for Nichols) and won the Academy Award for Best Song for Carly Simon&#x27;s &quot;Let the River Run&quot;. At one point in the 1980s, Nichols—prone to bouts of depression—reported that he had considered suicide, a feeling apparently brought on by a psychotic episode he experienced after taking the drug Halcion.

=== 1990–1999: Established career ===
In the 1990s, Nichols directed several more successful, well-received films including &quot;Postcards from the Edge&quot; (1990) starring Meryl Streep and Shirley MacLaine; &quot;Primary Colors&quot; (1998) starring John Travolta and Emma Thompson; and &quot;The Birdcage&quot; (1996), an American remake of the 1978 French film &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot; starring Robin Williams, Nathan Lane, Gene Hackman and Dianne Wiest. Both &quot;The Birdcage&quot; and &quot;Primary Colors&quot; were written by Elaine May, Nichols&#x27;s comedy partner earlier in his career. Other films directed by Nichols include &quot;Regarding Henry&quot; (1991) starring Harrison Ford and &quot;Wolf&quot; (1994) starring Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer. When he was honored by Lincoln Center in 1999 for his life&#x27;s work, Elaine May—speaking once again as his friend—served up the essence of Nichols with the following:

So he&#x27;s witty, he&#x27;s brilliant, he&#x27;s articulate, he&#x27;s on time, he&#x27;s prepared and he writes. But is he perfect? He knows you can&#x27;t really be liked or loved if you&#x27;re perfect. You have to have just enough flaws. And he does. Just the right, perfect flaws to be absolutely endearing.

===2000–2016: Career expansion and later work ===
In the 2000s, Nichols directed the films &quot;What Planet Are You From?&quot; (2000), &quot;Closer&quot; (2004) and &quot;Charlie Wilson&#x27;s War&quot; (2007), a political drama that was ultimately his final feature film. &quot;What Planet Are You From?&quot; received mixed reviews from critics, while &quot;Closer&quot; and &quot;Charlie Wilson&#x27;s War&quot; received generally positive reviews and were both nominated for Academy Awards, BAFTA and Golden Globe awards.

Nichols also directed widely acclaimed adaptations of &quot;Wit&quot; (2001) and &quot;Angels in America&quot; (2003) for television, winning Emmy Awards for both of them. For his direction of the Broadway musical &quot;Spamalot&quot;, he won the Tony Award for Best Direction of a Musical in 2005.
In 2012, Nichols won the Best Direction of a Play Tony Award for a revival of Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot;. In 2013, he directed Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz in a Broadway revival of Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;Betrayal&quot;. The play began previews of its limited run on October 1, 2013 at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre, opened on October 27, and closed on January 4, 2014.

Among projects that remained uncompleted when he died, in April 2013 it was announced that Nichols was in talks to direct a film adaptation of Jonathan Tropper&#x27;s novel &quot;One Last Thing Before I Go&quot;. The film was to be produced by J. J. Abrams, who previously wrote the Nichols-directed film &quot;Regarding Henry&quot; (1991). In July 2014, it was announced that Nichols and Streep would reunite for an HBO film of Terrence McNally&#x27;s 1985 play &quot;Master Class&quot;, with Nichols directing Streep in the starring role of opera singer Maria Callas.

Nichols was a contributing blogger at &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;. He was also a co-founder of The New Actors Workshop in New York City, where he occasionally taught. In addition, he remained active in the Directors Guild of America, interviewing fellow film director Bennett Miller on stage in October 2011 after the Guild&#x27;s screening of Miller&#x27;s &quot;Moneyball&quot;.

In January 2016, PBS aired &quot;Mike Nichols: American Masters&quot;, an &quot;American Masters&quot; documentary about Nichols directed by his former improv partner, Elaine May. On February 22, 2016, HBO aired the documentary &quot;Becoming Mike Nichols&quot;.

==Directing style==
After his early successes as a stage and film director, Nichols had developed a reputation as an auteur who likes to work intimately with his actors and writers, often using them repeatedly in different films. Writer Peter Applebome noted that &quot;few directors have such a gift for getting performances out of actors.&quot; During a half-year period in 1967 he had four hit plays running simultaneously on Broadway, during which time his first Hollywood feature, &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot;, had also become a popular and critical success. Combined with his second film, &quot;The Graduate&quot;, in 1967, the two films had already earned a total of 20 Oscar nominations, including two for Best Director, and winning it for &quot;The Graduate.&quot;

Nichols was able to get the best out of actors regardless of their acting experience, whether an unknown such as Dustin Hoffman or a major star like Richard Burton. For his first film, &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot;, each of the four actors was nominated for an Oscar, with Elizabeth Taylor and Sandy Dennis winning. Burton later said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t think I could learn anything about comedy—I&#x27;d done all of Shakespeare&#x27;s. But from him I learned,&quot; adding, &quot;He conspires with you to get your best.&quot;

However, it was Taylor who chose Nichols to be their director, because, writes biographer David Bret, &quot;she particularly admired him because he had done a number of ad-hoc jobs to pay for his education after arriving in America as a seven-year-old Jewish refugee.&quot; Producer Ernest Lehman agreed with her choice: &quot;He was the only one who could handle them,&quot; he said. &quot;The Burtons were quite intimidating, and we needed a genius like Mike Nichols to combat them.&quot; Biographer Kitty Kelley says that neither Taylor nor Burton would ever again reach the heights of acting performance they did in that film.

The same style of directing was used for &quot;The Graduate&quot;, where, notes film historian Peter Biskind, Nichols took Dustin Hoffman, with no movie acting experience, along with Anne Bancroft, Katharine Ross and others, and managed to get some of their finest acting on screen. This ability to work closely with actors would remain consistent throughout his career. Hoffman credits Nichols for permitting the realistic acting needed for the satirical roles in that film:

In a similar way, Jeremy Irons, who acted in the play &quot;The Real Thing&quot;, said that Nichols creates a very &quot;protective environment: he makes you feel he&#x27;s only there for you,&quot; while Ann-Margret, for her role in &quot;Carnal Knowledge&quot;, felt the same: &quot;What&#x27;s wonderful about Mike is that he makes you feel like you&#x27;re the one that&#x27;s come up with the idea, when it&#x27;s actually his.&quot;

==Personal life==
Nichols was married four times; the first three ended in divorce, the last upon his death.

Nichols&#x27;s first marriage was to Patricia Scot; they were married from 1957 to 1960. His second was to Margot Callas, a former &quot;muse&quot; of the poet Robert Graves, from 1963 to 1974. The couple had a daughter together, Daisy Nichols. His third marriage, in 1975, to Annabel Davis-Goff, produced two children, Max Nichols and Jenny Nichols; it ended in divorce in 1986. His fourth was to former &quot;Good Morning America&quot; and &quot;ABC World News&quot; anchor Diane Sawyer, whom he married on April 29, 1988. None of his wives were Jewish and his children were not brought up according to a religion, but they identify as Jewish. His son Max married former ESPN journalist Rachel Nichols.

Nichols had a lifelong interest in Arabian horses. From 1968 to 2004, he owned a farm in Connecticut and was a noted horse breeder. He also imported quality Arabian horses from Janów Podlaski Stud Farm in Poland, some of which sold for record-setting prices. While in high school, Nichols had been an instructor at the Claremont Riding Academy in Manhattan&#x27;s Upper West Side and also had &quot;ridden in horse shows in Chicago.&quot;

In 2009, Nichols signed a petition in support of releasing director Roman Polanski, who had been detained while traveling to a film festival in relation to his 1977 sexual abuse charges, which the petition argued would undermine the tradition of film festivals as a place for works to be shown &quot;freely and safely&quot;, and that arresting filmmakers traveling to neutral countries could open the door &quot;for actions of which no-one can know the effects.&quot;

==Death and legacy==
Nichols died of a heart attack on November 19, 2014, at his apartment in Manhattan. During the 87th annual Academy Awards on 22 February 2015, Nichols was featured in the &quot;In Memoriam&quot; segment, in anchor position. Nichols left John Frederick Herring Sr.&#x27;s painting &quot;Horse with Groom&quot; to his son Max.

When Nichols died, many celebrities paid tribute to him, including Whoopi Goldberg, Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks, Meryl Streep, Kevin Spacey and Tom Stoppard.

<text>Insulin potentiation therapy (IPT) is an unproven alternative cancer treatment using insulin as an adjunct to low-dose chemotherapy. It was promoted by a paper in the controversial and non-peer reviewed journal &quot;Medical Hypotheses&quot;. It is not an evidence-based cancer treatment, and the costs of IPT are not covered by health insurance.

According to Quackwatch, &quot;Insulin Potentiation Therapy (IPT) is one of several unproven, dangerous treatments that is promoted by a small group of practitioners without trustworthy evidence that it works.&quot;

== History ==
It was developed by Donato Perez Garcia, MD in 1930. Originally, Garcia targeted syphilis, and later tried the treatment for chronic degenerative diseases and some types of cancer.

== Method ==
Generally, a dose of insulin is injected into a vein, followed by a much lower dose of a chemotherapy drug. Then sugar water is injected to stop the hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) caused by the insulin injection.

== Efficacy ==
IPT has not been proven to work. Lab research indicates that there is not even a theoretical possibility of it being an effective treatment for most cancers. Research over the decades has proved that most cancers grow when exposed to more insulin.

One study of men with prostate cancer showed that survival was significantly shorter (11 months for men who received IPT vs 18.9 months for men on standard treatment). A second small trial showed that women with metastatic breast cancer were less likely to see short-term disease progression if they received IPT with low-dose methotrexate than if they received either insulin alone or low-dose methotrexate alone. (This study did not compare IPT against any of the proven multi-drug chemotherapy regimens.)

== Adverse effects ==
The immediate risk is hypoglycemia. The main risk is that the person will die from cancer because IPT does not work.

The use of lower than normal doses of chemotherapy can cause drug resistance, which could make future treatment at standard, proven doses ineffective. For some cancers, especially breast and colon cancers, insulin may promote tumor growth.

== Mechanism of action ==
Two main ideas about how it might work have been proposed over the years. The first idea, which has been proven wrong, is that insulin makes cells more permeable, so that the chemotherapy drugs are absorbed faster into cells. The other idea is that insulin might cause the cells to start dividing, which makes them more susceptible to destruction of many cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs.

==Cost==
Costs run up to US$2,000 per treatment session. Multiple sessions are normal. One business charges US$50,000 for the first two months. Patients pay the full cost out of pocket, because it is an unproven therapy that is not covered by health insurance.

<text>Emmett Leo Kelly (December 9, 1898March 28, 1979) was an American circus performer, who created the clown character &quot;Weary Willie&quot;, based on the hobos of the Great Depression in the 1930s.

==Early life==
Emmett Leo Kelly was born in Sedan, Kansas on December 9, 1898. His father, Thomas, was a section foreman for the Missouri-Pacific Railroad. While he was still a child, the family moved to Southern Missouri where his father had purchased a farm in Texas County, near the community of Houston, Missouri. In the summer of 1909, he attended both the Mighty Haag and M.L. Clark and Son&#x27;s circuses.

As a youth, he was enrolled by his mother, Mollie, in the Landon School of Cartooning, a correspondence school where he began developing his artistic skill.

In 1917, Kelly moved to Kansas City, hoping to get a job as a newspaper cartoonist. It was there that he created a cartoon of a tramp that he originally named &quot;Old Dubey&quot;. While in Kansas City, Kelly began working for carnivals and circuses and trained as a trapeze artist.

In August 1920, Kelly returned to his adopted hometown of Houston, Missouri where he appeared as a &quot;cartoonist and comedy specialist&quot; at the town&#x27;s annual &quot;Old Settlers Reunion&quot;.

==Early circus career==
Kelly&#x27;s first professional appearance as a clown was with Howe&#x27;s Great London Circus on July 14, 1921, in Mason City, Iowa. Although he originally performed as a white-face clown, it was during that tour that he first appeared as a hobo character. After only a few performances as a tramp, Kelly returned to more traditional makeup, but not before a photograph was made of the character which would later be identified as &quot;Weary Willie.&quot; The photo appeared in the Howe&#x27;s Great London Route Book of 1921 above a caption that read: &quot;Emmett Kelly, The Novelty Clown, Cartoonist, Tramp&quot;.

At the end of the 1921 tour, the Howe&#x27;s Great London Circus and Van Amburgh&#x27;s Trained Wild Animal Show was acquired by the American Circus Corporation. In 1922 Kelly was assigned to perform his single trapeze act in the corporation&#x27;s John Robinson Circus.

Kelly returned to John Robinson in 1923 and was part of a program that included eight members of the Moore family. The large troupe appeared in several displays including a double trapeze act featuring sisters Mitzi and Eva. Kelly married Eva in Charlottesville, Virginia on July 21, 1923, and the pair began performing together on the trapeze.

The couple returned to the show in 1924, and as the season progressed, Emmett and Eva learned that they were expecting a child. On November 24, the last day of the John Robinson season, Emmett Kelly Jr. was born in Dyersburg, Tennessee.

On September 12, 1929, John Ringling purchased the American Circus Corporation. Included in the deal was the John Robinson show, along with the Al G. Barnes, Sparks, Sells-Floto and Hagenbeck-Wallace circuses.

As the economy suffered in 1930, disposable income dried up, and for many, circus tickets became a luxury. The John Robinson Circus, the oldest in the United States, was among the first to close, giving its final performance on September 5 at the Nebraska State Fair in Lincoln.

Although fewer shows toured in 1931, The Aerial Kellys were among several acts that moved from John Robinson to the Ringling-owned Sells-Floto circus. Despite the fact that cowboy movie star Tom Mix was heavily promoted as a feature, Sells-Floto struggled. While the Kellys still considered themselves trapeze performers, Emmett was hired as a white-face clown with the Ringling-owned Hagenbeck-Wallace circus in 1932.

A year later, the hobo character that had first been created on a drawing board in Kansas City came to life. Ragged homeless men were commonplace during the Depression, and on April 21, 1933, the tramp clown made his first appearance during a performance at the Chicago Coliseum.

In early 1934 a second child, Patrick, was born. At the end of the year, Hagenbeck-Wallace manager Jess Adkins, along with former Sells-Floto manager Zack Terrell, partnered to start their own show, the Cole Bros. and Clyde Beatty Combined Circus. Kelly was among those who made the jump from Hagenbeck-Wallace, although his wife Eva was not given a contract. Shortly after the season started, she asked for a divorce. Kelly later wrote that the sadness he experienced at the time worked its way into the character&#x27;s persona.

In 1937, newspaper writer Hype Igho described the sad clown as &quot;Weary Willie.&quot; Igho had written about the act by using a term that originated decades earlier as a generic description for a nameless hobo. Kelly later said that Igho encouraged him to use the name and overnight, the character that had once referred to as Old Dubey became Weary Willie.

During the winter of 1937–38, Kelly was hired to perform with the Bertram Mills Circus at the Olympia in London. It was at his European debut that he put his own spin on a routine that a veteran clown named Charlie &quot;Shorty&quot; Flem had performed years earlier at Madison Square Garden.

The act, which would become Kelly&#x27;s signature routine, began with him sweeping the ring. A spotlight followed him, and as it danced about, he slapped, swept, and chased the pool of light with his broom. Once he completed the spotlight routine, Willie blew up a balloon until it popped, and then pantomiming his sorrow, he buried the remains in the sawdust.

==Broadway and Hollywood==
When World War II broke out in September 1939, Kelly returned to the United States where he was cast in a new Broadway musical starring Jimmy Durante and Ray Bolger. The show, titled &quot;Keep Off the Grass&quot;, was set in New York&#x27;s Central Park, where Weary Willie appeared as one of several tramps, including an up-and-comer named Jackie Gleason, who was also making his Broadway debut.

Despite the star power of Durante and Bolger, &quot;Keep Off the Grass&quot; did not receive good notices. The only positive review came from the &quot;Time&quot; critic who wrote: &quot;...and there&#x27;s a bum, Emmett Kelly, who would leisurely proceed to eat a ham sandwich out of a paper poke while a bunch of other bums sang a park bench song; then he would lazily brush his teeth with the dry stub of a toothbrush, which provides the one moment of an otherwise uninspired show.&quot;

&quot;Keep off the Grass&quot; closed after only 44 performances, and Kelly returned to the nightclub circuit as a cartoonist dressed as a tramp. Even though he would appear in rooms that were often noisy, Willie never uttered a word, but, as one newspaper noted, &quot;with lightning speed he would knock out about eight cartoons in less time than you can write your name.&quot;

==Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey==
For a year and a half Emmett made his living performing in nightclubs and indoor circuses until early 1941, when he received offers from both Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey and Cole Bros. After considering both opportunities, Kelly opted to go with Cole Bros., which promised a higher salary.

In the five years since Kelly had appeared under canvas in the United States, he honed his craft and matured as a performer to the point that the Cole Bros. publicity department touted him as &quot;the world&#x27;s funniest clown.&quot; The stories that were placed in newspapers in advance of the circus described, and occasionally embellished, details associated with his tour of the United Kingdom.

The positive reviews caught the attention of Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey, and in 1942 he joined the circus for the first of fourteen seasons with the show. In 1944, the character that Kelly had created was cast as the star in the featured spectacle. &quot;Panto&#x27;s Paradise&quot; was staged as a &quot;dream of a hobo in fairyland.&quot;

==Hartford circus fire==

Although &quot;Panto&#x27;s Paradise&quot; was Willie&#x27;s big number in 1944, his first appearance occurred earlier in the program when the Wallendas were performing on the high wire. During the act, Willie would stand under their rigging, holding a small handkerchief as if to catch them should they fall. The gag had been getting laughs all season, and on July 6, while the circus was in Hartford, Connecticut, there was no reason to believe that anything would be different.

&quot;As I was putting the finishing touches on my face, I could hear the band playing the waltz music that was my cue to amble into the center ring. At that instant someone ran past the dressing tent yelling ‘fire.’ I was trying to run in my big flapping shoes and suddenly realized that I was carrying a bucket of wash water I had grabbed when I left the dressing tent.&quot;

Kelly said that when he saw the big top burning, he knew that he had to help the panicked crowd exit the tent. It was then that he spotted flames burning near one of the large generator wagons. As he tried to douse the small fire with his bucket of water, he nearly became a casualty himself. &quot;One of the Caterpillar tractors came rumbling along to get that wagon – to hook on and pull it away from the crowd,&quot; he recalled. &quot;It was almost on top of me before I realized what was happening, and as it swung around it did not miss running over me by more than an inch.&quot;

Kelly&#x27;s actions that day were immortalized by audience member Ralph Emerson, who took a photograph of Kelly in his full clown make-up and costume, carrying a single bucket of water. The photograph was published in &quot;Life&quot; on July 17, 1944.

The fire and the loss of 168 lives had a profound impact on Kelly. That night, after the victims had been transported to a temporary morgue, he reflected on what had happened. &quot;Leaving the showgrounds, I walked past the ruins of the big top and saw some charred shoes and part of a clown doll lying on what had been the hippodrome track. That moment was when the tensions of the past hours broke over me in a wave and I could not keep from crying any longer.&quot;

The fire investigation delayed the show&#x27;s departure from Hartford for nine days, but on July 15 the trains were headed back to Sarasota, Florida, and within a month, the circus had resumed its tour, playing in stadiums and ballparks. Emmett was among those impressed by the resilience of the big show, telling a reporter &quot;We must entertain. In war time it is more important than ever. It is going to be great in the open air.&quot;

==Return to Hollywood==
In 1949, after a charity circus performance in Los Angeles, Emmett was approached by an agent representing David O. Selznick. On October 8, while Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey was in Tucson, Arizona, Kelly signed an exclusive one-year contract.
At the age of 51, the idea of starting a new career in motion pictures appealed to Kelly, and when the circus closed in Miami, Florida on November 25, he immediately left for California and Hollywood.

In the months that followed various ideas were pitched, until finally he was given a script based on a radio mystery series titled &quot;The Fat Man.&quot; In the film, Kelly would be cast as the villain. Although the idea intrigued him, as he read the script, he became concerned. The storyline called for the character to murder three people, then take money that he had stolen from one of the victims and start a circus where he would hide behind his clown makeup. And they wanted Emmett to appear in the film as Willie.

The idea of turning his beloved character into a murderer was unacceptable. The producer and director of the film agreed that the killer should not depict the same character that Emmett had spent his career developing. In its review of the film, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, praised Kelly&#x27;s acting ability and noted, &quot;As the ex-convict clown, Mr. Kelly herein demonstrates that circus rings need not be his sole field.&quot;

Following the release of &quot;The Fat Man&quot;, Kelly&#x27;s agent reached out to Cecil B. DeMille who was in Sarasota filming early scenes for &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot;. The circus allowed Emmett to leave the tour for 15 weeks so that he could join James Stewart and Betty Hutton on the Paramount backlot. Unlike his featured role in &quot;The Fat Man&quot;, Kelly speaks only one word in the DeMille epic. In the middle of the train wreck scene, Hutton told Emmett to get the clowns ready for the parade, and Kelly responded, &quot;Parade?&quot; According to Emmett, it took two takes to get it right.

Willie appeared in several other scenes that were shot on the Hollywood soundstage, including a number with Hutton and Stewart where the three bounced on a trampoline. In the scene Willie unsuccessfully tried to eat a sandwich as Stewart and Hutton sang the song &quot;Be a Jumping Jack.&quot;
Emmett said that his favorite scene in the film was the segment that showed him playing solitaire on top of a wagon as the circus paraded through the streets of Sarasota. As Willie placed his cards down, his game was interrupted by a sudden gust of wind. Emmett said the effect was accomplished by the blast of an air hose as he played cards against a yellow screen. The special effect was then matched against the parade sequence that had been filmed in February before the season started.

Although Kelly accompanied the Hollywood cast to Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia for the scenes filmed there, the only scenes where he appeared under canvas were during a clown walkaround, the Zoppe riding act, and the aerial ballet. In the big production number filmed on May 22, 1951, Willie strummed a ukulele as Dorothy Lamour sang &quot;Lovely Luawana Lady&quot;. The rest of his scenes were filmed at Paramount in Hollywood.

==Author and later career==
In 1954, Kelly met a 21-year-old acrobat named Evi Gebhardt who was part of an act known as The Four Whirlwinds. Their courtship coincided with the release of his autobiography, &quot;Clown, My Life in Tatters and Smiles,&quot; co-authored with Ringling press agent F. Beverly Kelley. The story, published by Prentice-Hall, started appearing in bookstores while the circus was at Madison Square Garden that spring. As part of the promotion, Kelly made numerous appearances at bookstores and on radio, and on March 26, 1954, he was one of the first guests to be interviewed on Edward R. Murrow’s new CBS television program &quot;Person to Person&quot;.

One of those who was captivated by Emmett&#x27;s life story was actor Henry Fonda, who had read the book while he was filming &quot;Mister Roberts&quot; in the spring of 1954. By that summer, Fonda acquired the film rights and began making plans to produce the story, either as a television program or a full-length motion picture.

Because Emmett&#x27;s entire life story could not be told in a half-hour, the program focused on his transition from trapeze artist to clown, with Fonda wearing Willie&#x27;s makeup and actress Dorothy Malone playing Kelly&#x27;s first wife, Eva. &quot;Clown&quot; appeared on the CBS television network on March 27, 1955, and was hosted by Ronald Reagan.

The program was filmed on a soundstage at Republic Studios and used the equipment of Herbert Weber&#x27;s Circo Flamante. During the program, Weber performed on the wire along with the DeWayne teeterboard troupe, Hap Hadley&#x27;s elephant, and Winston&#x27;s seals. Faye and Rosie Alexander doubled for Emmett and Eva during the flying return sequence.

As part of the publicity blitz for Ringling&#x27;s 1955 New York engagement, Emmett appeared on another CBS program less than a month later. On April 20, Weary Willie and the Four Whirlwinds appeared on &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;. Emmett&#x27;s secret was the fact that he was getting married the next day to one of the girls in the Whirlwinds’ tumbling act, Evi Gebhardt.

When, on November 6, Evi gave birth to their daughter Stasia, a news photographer named Frank Beatty snapped a picture of a grinning Weary Willie as he spoke by telephone to the new mother. At the same time Beatty was shooting his picture of Emmett, a separate photographer had been dispatched to Sarasota where a photo of Evi and Stasia was also recorded, capturing both sides of the touching telephone conversation.

After 14 years with Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey, 1955 was Emmett&#x27;s last season with the circus. Although he was already the most recognized clown in America, his family responsibilities, along with myriad new opportunities, were the catalysts that propelled his career to new heights.

In the winter of 1956, Kelly was hired to play the role of Willie Voight in an upcoming television program titled &quot;The Captain from Kopenick&quot;. Under the terms of his 1956 circus contract, Kelly would appear with Ringling only during the indoor dates in New York and at the Boston Garden.

On March 11, 1956, the sad-faced Willie was the first guest on the hit television show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; Because the character was so well known, each of the panelists was required to put on a mask before Willie appeared on camera. The interview segment that followed was a classic as Emmett stayed in character throughout, never speaking and responding only with a grunt. After Arlene Francis peppered Willie with questions for five minutes, she correctly identified his occupation as a clown and said, while still blindfolded, &quot;The only clown&#x27;s name that comes to my mind is Emmett Kelly&quot;.

The circus was plagued with labor problems in 1956, and prior to its New York premiere, a picket line was set up outside of Madison Square Garden by both the Teamsters and the American Guild of Variety Artists. Many performers loyal to the circus were conflicted because of their membership in AGVA. Kelly, as well as clown Felix Adler and ringmaster Harold Ronk, chose not to cross the picket line, and their contracts were terminated.

Within weeks, Weary Willie was appearing in a 45-minute stage show at New York&#x27;s Roxy Theatre. &quot;Circus&quot; preceded a feature film and included acrobats, animal acts, and trapeze artists, along with performers on ice skates.

==Brooklyn Dodgers==
In 1957, attendance for the Brooklyn Dodgers was declining, and owner Walter O&#x27;Malley was considering moving the team to Los Angeles. In early January, O&#x27;Malley hired Kelly as the official mascot of the team, and in his role, Weary Willie would &quot;characterize all of Brooklyn when the team loses, and a happy bum when the team wins.&quot;

Late in the 1957 season, on the same day that the Dodgers lost the opener during what would be the &quot;Bums&quot; final homestand ever in Brooklyn, Evi Kelly gave birth in New York to their second daughter, Monika.

==Hollywood, nightclubs and featured clown==
When the baseball season ended and the announcement was made that the Dodgers would be moving to Los Angeles, Kelly was cast in the film &quot;Wind Across the Everglades&quot;, a movie that was written, produced, and directed by Budd Schulberg, the same filmmaker who had won Best Picture with &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; in 1954.

The story was set in the early 20th century and told the true tale of poachers who would hunt for egrets and other birds so that they could sell their plumes for women&#x27;s hats. Emmett was part of an eclectic [one reviewer said &quot;preposterous&quot;] cast which included singer Burl Ives, stripper Gypsy Rose Lee, boxer Tony Galento, singer Chana Eden, Christopher Plummer, and Peter Falk. In the film, Emmett played the role of Bigamy Bob, a cutthroat who escaped to the Everglades to get away from his many wives.

With another film credit under his belt, Emmett reiterated that he no intention of retiring his classic character and that he planned &quot;to bring Willie to the public for as long as I can&quot;.

The opportunity to return to the circus ring presented itself in the spring of 1958, when amusement park owner Irving Rosenthal convinced George Hamid and Jerry Collins to combine forces and present the Clyde Beatty &amp; Hamid-Morton Combined Circus under canvas. The show was set up at Rosenthal&#x27;s Palisades Amusement Park in Fort Lee, New Jersey and competed directly against Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey at Madison Square Garden.

With no contract that tied him to any individual show, when Beatty-Hamid-Morton closed at Palisades Park, Emmett was hired by the Cristiani Bros. Circus to appear at its big stands in Philadelphia and Chicago in 1958.

The success that Palisades Park in 1958 encouraged Irving Rosenthal to buy out the newly-titled Clyde Beatty-Cole Bros. for six weeks in 1959. For Emmett it was a busy year. After spending five days in January with Cristiani Bros. in Miami, he traveled to both New York and Chicago in February where he made appearances at the big auto shows in those cities. In March, Emmett returned to Palisades Park for the 45-day Beatty-Cole engagement, which again was presented day-and-date against Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey at Madison Square Garden.

The following year, Emmett was back at Palisades Park with the &quot;Royal International Circus,&quot; produced by Hunt Bros., and when Clyde Beatty-Cole Bros. opened its 1961 season, he was a featured attraction for the first three dates of the season, opening indoors at Commack, Long Island, followed by the New Haven Arena, and then back under canvas at Palisades Park.

In 1958, CBS built a new 28-acre amusement park on the Santa Monica beach. Pacific Ocean Park was created to compete directly with Disneyland, and in the summer of 1959, Emmett Kelly was hired for 19 weeks to serve as &quot;Vice President in Charge of Fun.&quot;

The idea of performing in one place for an extended period appealed to Emmett and Evi, and in 1962, Kelly began a long-term relationship with casino owner Bill Harrah. For the next 15 years, Weary Willie was a regular at the South Shore Room at Harrah&#x27;s in Lake Tahoe, co-starring with celebrities including Sammy Davis Jr., Lawrence Welk, Jack Benny, Andy Williams, the Smothers Brothers, Ed Sullivan and Carol Channing. At John Ascuaga’s Nugget in Reno, he and Red Skelton performed together and established a strong friendship.

In 1967, he starred in a musical motion picture titled &quot;The Clown and the Kids.&quot; The movie was filmed in Bulgaria.

As Emmett grew older, his acting ability, along with the complexity of his character, made him a favorite for producers looking to evoke emotion from their audience. In 1973, at the age of 74, Willie was cast in the Boston Opera production of &quot;The Bartered Bride&quot;. The producer, Sarah Caldwell, was renowned for creating variations of standard operas, and this was no exception.

The opera, which was punctuated by scenes of Soviet tanks entering Prague and images of Adolf Hitler, also included an important circus scene where Willie performed both the spotlight routine and made a solo appearance which involved a balloon, a dove, and a pistol. Emmett&#x27;s association with the avant-garde opera generated headlines nationwide. &quot;The New York Times&quot; said, &quot;Mr. Kelly, like any great performer, has the kind of tact not to seem intrusive even while clowning. His nibbling at a cabbage leaf while he listened to stuttering Vasek&#x27;s lament was unforgettable.&quot;

Although Emmett Kelly had been a household name for decades, it was television that exposed Willie to millions of people who never would have attended the circus. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, a new generation came to know the tramp character through those appearances – among them, a guest spot on Bette Midler’s first network television special which aired just before Christmas 1977. The NBC program was produced by Aaron Russo, one of Hollywood&#x27;s biggest producers at the time. The program included the spotlight routine and a poignant segment where Midler sang the sentimental song &quot;Hello in There&quot; to Willie.

Although he never retired, he could now be very selective in his public appearances, and that flexibility allowed Emmett and Evi to become prominent citizens in Sarasota while at the same time embracing the area&#x27;s circus heritage. When Karl Wallenda produced the first Showfolks Circus in 1967, Willie and the spotlight were a featured act. In the years that followed, Emmett became a sought-after speaker at circus symposia, and in 1976, he appeared in a one-man show at the new Van Wezel Performing Arts Hall, accompanied by the Sarasota Concert Band.

While Willie was still regularly seen on television commercials and special programs, his last appearances in the circus ring came in a pair of shows produced by Paul Kaye in 1974 at the Capital Centre arena in Landover, Maryland. The all-star production, Circus America, featured The Wallendas, Carol and Wayne Zacchini, Tarzan Zerbini, and The Nerveless Nocks, but the star of the show was Emmett Kelly.

After the Circus America date, Paul Kaye hired Emmett to appear in another show that nearly ended in tragedy. The circus was to be held in Hawaii at the Honolulu International Center. As the troupe was checking luggage at Los Angeles International Airport, a terrorist bomb went off in a nearby locker. &quot;At first I thought it was a joke,&quot; Emmett told a reporter. &quot;Then when I saw the smoke and flying glass, I got scared as hell.&quot; The explosion killed three people and injured 36 others. Despite the bombing, the performers eventually made their way to Honolulu. Not long after, investigators arrested a Yugoslavian immigrant who was later convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison.

==Death==
On December 9, 1978, Emmett Kelly celebrated his 80th birthday, and although he had been growing visibly weaker, he never stopped working. In February 1979, Emmett appeared in a segment on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; Show, and director Mario Pellegrini cast him in a film with Tony Bennett.

&quot;A Gift of Love&quot; was scheduled to begin production in Sarasota on April 2, 1979, and although the picture was later dedicated to Emmett, he did not appear in it. On March 28, 1979, four days before filming was scheduled to begin, the man who had described himself as &quot;just a farm boy,&quot; who had become a world-wide icon, died of a heart attack in the front yard of his home.

As the news spread, tributes began rushing in. Among those sending condolences was comedienne Carol Burnett, a favorite of Emmett&#x27;s with whom he had shared the stage on several occasions. &quot;I had the amazing pleasure and privilege of working with Emmett Kelly,&quot; she said, &quot;and I considered him to be a truly gentle clown.&quot;

His long-time friend Red Skelton was saddened. &quot;Emmett was humanity himself,&quot; he said, adding, &quot;You know it is funny such a beautiful leaf fell in the spring. I think we can look at it kind of like he is going out on tour. I guess the angels needed a laugh.&quot;

==Honors==
On August 9, 1956 the Kelly family visited his adopted hometown of Houston, Missouri when the town renamed the open area where he gave his first performance at the &quot;Old Settlers Reunion&quot; in 1920 as &quot;Emmett Kelly Park&quot; in his honor. Nineteen years later Kelly returned to Houston for a final time when Governor Christopher Bond recognized Houston&#x27;s former resident by declaring October 9, 1975 as &quot;Emmett Kelly Day&quot; in Missouri. Since then the annual &quot;Emmett Kelly Clown Festival&quot; has attracted clowns from across the region, including Kelly&#x27;s grandson, Joey Kelly, who returned to perform as a special guest in 2007. Although the festival ended its original 21-year run in May 2008, it returned in April 2022 when Kelly&#x27;s daughter, Stasia, was presented with a key to the city.

Kelly was inducted into the Circus Ring of Fame in Sarasota, Florida in 1988 and International Circus Hall of Fame in Peru, Indiana in 1994. On May 1, 1996, a bust of Kelly was dedicated in the &quot;Hall of Famous Missourians&quot; at the state capitol in Jefferson City, Missouri.

==Legacy==
Kelly&#x27;s son, Emmett Kelly Jr., performed a similar &quot;Weary Willie&quot; character and as a result the two were estranged for many years. Kelly Jr. died in 2006.

According to the documentary &quot;Halloween Unmasked&quot;, the choice for the mask of the film&#x27;s fictional serial killer Michael Myers was down to two: a modified Captain Kirk mask and an Emmett Kelly mask. While the Emmett Kelly mask was unsettling and eerie, it did not quite evoke the creepy feeling they were seeking. The Kirk mask did, resulting in the crew selecting it for the film.

In 2023, Emmett Kelly became the protagonist of the award-winning short documentary &quot;Who Is Weary Willie?&quot; directed by Constanza H. Hevia and produced by filmmaker and scholar Daniel L. Bernardi.

<text>Robert Earl Wise (September 10, 1914 – September 14, 2005) was an American filmmaker. He won the Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture for his musical films &quot;West Side Story&quot; (1961) and &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; (1965). He was also nominated for Best Film Editing for &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; (1941) and directed and produced &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot; (1966), which was nominated for Best Picture.

Among his other films are &quot;The Body Snatcher&quot; (1945), &quot;Born to Kill&quot; (1947), &quot;The Set-Up&quot; (1949), &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; (1951), &quot;Destination Gobi&quot; (1953), &quot;This Could Be The Night&quot; (1957), &quot;Run Silent, Run Deep&quot; (1958), &quot;I Want to Live!&quot; (1958), &quot;The Haunting&quot; (1963), &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot; (1971), &quot;The Hindenburg&quot; (1975) and &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; (1979).

He was the president of the Directors Guild of America from 1971 to 1975 and the president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences from 1985 through 1988.

Wise achieved critical success as a director in a striking variety of film genres: horror-noir, western, war, film noir, horror, science fiction, musical and drama, with many repeat successes within each genre. Wise&#x27;s meticulous preparation may have been largely motivated by studio budget constraints, but advanced the moviemaking art. He received the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1998.

==Early years==
Wise was born in Winchester, Indiana, the youngest son of Olive R. (née Longenecker) and Earl W. Wise, a meat packer. He had an elder brother, David. The family moved to Connersville, Fayette County, Indiana, where Wise attended public schools. As a youth Wise&#x27;s favorite pastime was going to the movies. As a student at Connersville High School, Wise wrote humor and sports columns for the school&#x27;s newspaper and was a member of the yearbook staff and poetry club. Wise initially sought a career in journalism and following graduation from high school attended Franklin College, a small liberal arts college south of Indianapolis, Indiana, on a scholarship. In 1933, due to the family&#x27;s poor financial situation during the Great Depression, Wise was unable to return to college for his second year and moved to Hollywood to begin a lifelong career in the film industry. Wise&#x27;s older brother, David, who had gone to Hollywood several years earlier and worked at RKO Pictures, found his younger brother a job in the shipping department at RKO. Wise worked odd jobs at the studio before moving into editing.

==Early career==
Wise began his film career at RKO as a sound and music editor. In the 1930s, RKO was a budget-minded studio with &quot;a strong work ethic&quot; and &quot;willingness to take artistic risks&quot;, which was fortunate for a newcomer to Hollywood such as Wise. At RKO, Wise became an assistant to T.K. Wood, the studio&#x27;s head sound-effects editor. Wise&#x27;s first screen credit was a ten-minute short subject called &quot;A Trip through Fijiland&quot; (1935), which was made from RKO footage salvaged from an abandoned feature film.

As Wise gained experience, he became more interested in editing film content, rather than sound, and went to work for RKO film editor William &quot;Billy&quot; Hamilton. Wise&#x27;s first film as Hamilton&#x27;s assistant was Alfred Santell&#x27;s &quot;Winterset&quot; (1936). Wise continued to work with Hamilton on other films, including &quot;Stage Door&quot; (1937), &quot;Having Wonderful Time&quot; (1938) and &quot;The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle&quot; (1939). In &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; (1939) and &quot;5th Ave Girl&quot; (1939), Hamilton and Wise, as assistant film editor, shared screen credit; it was Wise&#x27;s first credit on a feature film. Wise&#x27;s first solo film editing work was on &quot;Bachelor Mother&quot; (1939) and &quot;My Favorite Wife&quot; (1939).

At RKO, Wise worked with Orson Welles on &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; (1941) and was nominated for the Academy Award for Film Editing. Wise was the film&#x27;s last living crew member.

Though Wise worked as an editor on &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, it is likely that while working on the film he became familiar with the optical printer techniques employed by Linwood Dunn, inventor of the practical optical printer, to produce effects for &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; such as the image projected in the broken snowglobe which falls from Kane&#x27;s hand as he dies.

In &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, Welles used a deep-focus technique, in which heavy lighting is employed to achieve sharp focus for both foreground and background in the frame. Wise later used the technique in films that he directed. Welles&#x27; &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; also influenced Wise&#x27;s innovations in the use of sound in films such as &quot;The Set-Up&quot; (1949), where Wise limited music to in-film sources, and in &quot;Executive Suite&quot; (1954), which used no music. In addition, biographical films or biographical profiles of fictionalized characters such as Charles Foster Kane were often the subjects of Wise&#x27;s later work, including &quot;Somebody Up There Likes Me&quot; (1956), &quot;I Want to Live!&quot; (1958), &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; (1965), &quot;So Big&quot; (1953), &quot;Run Silent, Run Deep&quot; (1958) and &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot; (1966), among others. Wise also worked as editor on Welles&#x27; next film for RKO, &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot; (1942). While working as a film editor, Wise was called on to shoot additional scenes for the film. After Welles was dismissed from the studio, Wise continued editing films such as &quot;Seven Days Leave&quot; (1942), &quot;Bombardier&quot; (1943) and &quot;The Fallen Sparrow&quot; (1943), before he received his first directing assignment.

==Director and producer==
For Wise, connecting to the viewer was the &quot;most important part of making a film.&quot; Wise also had a reputation for a strong work ethic and budget-minded frugality. In addition, he was known for his attention to detail and well-researched preparation for a film. For example, before directing &quot;Until They Sail&quot; (1957), set in New Zealand during World War II, Wise traveled to New Zealand to interview women whose lives were similar to those portrayed in the film. Wise&#x27;s attention to detail also extended to foreign locales. While in New Zealand doing research for the film, Wise also scouted background shots for the film&#x27;s second-unit crew, even though the main film was shot on MGM&#x27;s back lot in California. He also shot films on location, such as &quot;Mystery in Mexico&quot; (1948), a minor B-movie thriller filmed in Mexico City.

Wise&#x27;s films often included lessons on racial tolerance. For example, Native Americans, Muslims, Hispanics and African Americans were featured in such films as &quot;Two Flags West&quot; (1950), &quot;This Could Be the Night&quot; (1957), &quot;The Set-Up&quot; (1949) and &quot;Odds Against Tomorrow&quot; (1959), and &quot;West Side Story&quot; (1961). &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot; (1966) featured the story of a biracial couple, and Jewish characters were included in &quot;Somebody Up There Likes Me&quot; (1956), &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; (1951), and &quot;The House on Telegraph Hill&quot; (1951).

At RKO, Wise got his first credited directing job in 1944 while working for Hollywood horror film producer Val Lewton. Wise replaced the original director on the horror film &quot;The Curse of the Cat People&quot; (1944), when it fell behind schedule. The film, a well received &quot;dark fantasy about a solitary child and her imaginary friend&quot;, was a departure from the horror films of the day. In many of Wise&#x27;s films, but especially in &quot;Curse of the Cat People&quot;, the melodrama used a vulnerable child or childlike character to challenge a dark, adult world. Lewton promoted Wise to his superiors at RKO, beginning a collaboration that produced the notable horror film &quot;The Body Snatcher&quot; (1945), starring Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi. Wise identified the film as a personal favorite and its rave reviews also helped establish his career as a director.

Between &quot;Curse&quot; and &quot;Snatcher&quot;, Wise directed &quot;Mademoiselle Fifi&quot; (1944), an adaptation of two Guy de Maupassant short stories that explored man&#x27;s darker side with a political subtext. &quot;Fifi&quot;″s feminist perspective and a memorable chase sequence helped make it a &quot;template picture for Wise&quot;. Wise also directed film noir, among them the Lawrence Tierney noir classic &quot;Born to Kill&quot; (1947), and &quot;Blood on the Moon&quot; (1948), a noir Western starring Robert Mitchum as a cowboy drifter that included memorable night sequences.

His last film for RKO &quot;The Set-Up&quot; (1949) was a realistic boxing movie in which Wise portrayed the sport as cruel and exploitative. The film also included choreographed fight scenes and &quot;set the bar&quot; for other fight films. The film earned the Critic&#x27;s Prize at the Cannes Film Festival. Wise&#x27;s use and mention of time in this film would echo in later noir films such as Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;The Killing&quot; (1956) and Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; (1994).

In the 1950s, he proved adept in several genres, including science fiction in &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; (1951); melodrama in &quot;So Big&quot; (1953); Western in &quot;Tribute to a Bad Man&quot; (1956), starring James Cagney; fictionalized biography in the boardroom drama &quot;Executive Suite&quot; (1954); and the epic &quot;Helen of Troy&quot; (1955) based on Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;. &quot;Three Secrets&quot; (1950), a soap opera/family melodrama, gave Wise a chance to work with actress Patricia Neal &quot;in a landmark performance about gender double standards&quot;. Neal starred in two more Wise films: &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; (1951) and &quot;Something for the Birds&quot; (1952). &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;, a science fiction thriller that warned about the dangers of atomic warfare, included a realistic setting and an emphasis on the story instead of special effects. The film received &quot;overwhelmingly positive&quot; reviews and has become &quot;one of the most enduring and influential science fiction films ever made, and among the first produced by a major studio.&quot;

The biography of convicted killer Barbara Graham in &quot;I Want to Live!&quot; (1958), featured Susan Hayward&#x27;s Oscar-winning performance as Graham and earned Wise his first nomination for Best Director. The film became one of the top-grossing pictures of 1959 and was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Screenplay from another medium and Best (black and white) Cinematography. In addition, &quot;Executive Suite&quot; earned Wise a Best Director nomination from the Motion Picture Academy, the Venice Film Festival, and the Directors Guild of America. The film was awarded Special Jury Prize at the Venice Film Festival and the British Academy of Film and Television Arts nominated it for Best Film. Other Wise-directed films from the 1950s include &quot;Somebody Up There Likes Me&quot; (1956), a portrait of boxer Rocky Graziano, starring Paul Newman; Wise&#x27;s first overt comedy, &quot;Something for the Birds&quot; (1952); the action comedy &quot;Destination Gobi&quot; (1953); and &quot;The Desert Rats&quot; (1953), a more traditional war film.

In the 1960s, Wise directed three films adapted from the Broadway stage: &quot;West Side Story&quot; (1961), &quot;Two for the Seesaw&quot; (1962) and &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; (1965). In 1961, teamed with Jerome Robbins, Wise won the Academy Award for Best Director for &quot;West Side Story&quot;, which Wise also produced. Wise and Robbins were the first duo to share an Academy Award for directing. Wise won a second Oscar, for Best Picture, as the film&#x27;s producer, &quot;West Side Story&quot; won ten out of its 11 Academy Award nominations: Best Picture, Director, Supporting Actor (George Chakiris), Supporting Actress (Rita Moreno), Cinematography (color), Art/Set Decoration (color), Sound, Scoring of a Musical Picture, Editing, and Costume Design (color). It lost for Best Screenplay based on material from another medium to &quot;Judgment at Nuremberg&quot; (1961). &quot;West Side Story&quot; was a box-office hit, and critics have declared it &quot;a cinema masterpiece&quot;.

Prior to directing &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; (1965), Wise directed the psychological horror film &quot;The Haunting&quot; (1963), starring Julie Harris, in an adaptation of Shirley Jackson&#x27;s novel &quot;The Haunting of Hill House&quot;. Wise&#x27;s big-budget adaptation of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein&#x27;s family-oriented musical &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, with Julie Andrews as Maria and Christopher Plummer as Captain von Trapp, became one of film history&#x27;s highest-grossing movies. Wise won Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture for &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; for 1965. Wise struggled to keep &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; from being an overly sweet, sentimental story by cutting lesser-known songs and adding new dialogue to improve transitions. In addition to garnering Wise two Oscars, the film won three more for editing, sound and scoring of music for an adaptation.

&quot;The Sound of Music&quot; was an interim film for Wise, produced to mollify the studio while he developed the difficult film &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot; (1966), starring Steve McQueen, Richard Attenborough, and Candice Bergen. &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot;, Wise&#x27;s critically acclaimed film epic, was a parable of the Vietnam War, with an antiwar director and message. McQueen received his only Oscar nomination for his performance in the film. Set in the late 1920s in China, this was an early entry in a series of Vietnam War era films followed by &quot;Catch-22&quot; and &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;. Excellent reviews for &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot; marked Wise&#x27;s last &quot;creative peak&quot; in his long career. &quot;Star!&quot; (1968), with Julie Andrews in the lead as Gertrude Lawrence, failed at the box office, although it was consistent with Wise&#x27;s other successful films that portrayed a strong woman &quot;whose life choices invite melodramatic relationships.&quot; Andrews was cast against type, but Wise, as the film&#x27;s director, took responsibility for the film&#x27;s shortcomings.

In the 1970s, Wise directed such films as &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot; (1971), &quot;The Hindenburg&quot; (1975), the horror film &quot;Audrey Rose&quot; (1977) and &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; (1979), the first &quot;Star Trek&quot; feature film.

Wise&#x27;s adaptation of Michael Crichton&#x27;s science-fiction thriller, &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot; (1971), an anti-biological warfare film, was a &quot;modest critical hit.&quot; His next film, &quot;Two People&quot; (1973), starring Peter Fonda and Lindsay Wagner, got &quot;poor reviews&quot; and is &quot;one of Wise&#x27;s least-seen movies.&quot; &quot;The Hindenburg&quot; (1975), which profiles the 1937 crash of the eponymous airship, was panned by critics, although it won Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects and Best Sound Effects. Wise&#x27;s &quot;Audrey Rose&quot; (1977), a reincarnation thriller, received mixed reviews and was &quot;sometimes criticized for being an &quot;Exorcist&quot; (1973) knockoff.&quot;

&quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; (1979), the first of the feature films based on the popular television series, was a difficult shoot for Wise. Popular film critic Leonard Maltin called it &quot;Slow, talky, and derivative, somewhat redeemed by terrific special effects&quot;. The film was a box office hit but a critical failure.

Wise was Ilya and Alexander Salkind&#x27;s first choice to direct the &quot;Superman&quot; spin-off &quot;Supergirl&quot; after Richard Lester departed the franchise, but he declined. Wise also was considered to direct the 1985 holiday film &quot;Santa Claus: The Movie&quot; and the 1988 horror film &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot; introducing the slasher villain Chucky. In 1989, Wise directed &quot;Rooftops&quot;, his last theatrical feature film. The low-budget musical &quot;opened and closed with no fanfare.&quot; At age 86, Wise directed &quot;A Storm in Summer&quot; (2000) for Showtime (cable television). Starring Peter Falk, it was his only made-for-television movie, airing in 2001, and won a Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Children&#x27;s Special.

==Later years==
Wise, a lifelong liberal, contributed to charitable organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union, and established the Robert E. Wise Foundation to provide financial assistance to causes in the Los Angeles area. Wise&#x27;s private papers are housed at the University of Southern California.

As Wise&#x27;s directing career slowed, he took a more active role in supporting the film industry. He became a governor of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 1966 and served for 19 years until becoming president from 1985 through 1988. He had previously been president of the Directors Guild of America from 1971 to 1975. He also sat on the Board of Trustees of the American Film Institute and chaired its Center for Advanced Film Studies. Wise was named chairman of the Directors Guild of America&#x27;s special projects committee in 1980, organizing its fiftieth anniversary celebration in New York in 1986. In addition, Wise was a leading member of the National Council of the Arts and Sciences, the Department of Film at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and the Motion Picture Country House and Hospital.

During the 1980s and 1990s Wise served on the advisory board of the National Student Film Institute.

Wise also encouraged young filmmakers and responded to inquiries from fans and film students. Wise supervised Emilio Estevez&#x27;s debut as a director in &quot;Wisdom&quot; (1986) and was its executive producer. Wise also made a cameo performance in John Landis&#x27; &quot;The Stupids&quot; (1996).

In his later years, Wise continued to be active in productions of DVD versions of his films, including making public appearances promoting those films. His last contributions were to the DVD commentaries of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, &quot;The Haunting&quot; and &quot;The Set-Up&quot;. He also oversaw the DVD commentaries of &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot; and &quot;Executive Suite&quot;. He also oversaw and provided DVD commentary for his Director&#x27;s Edition of &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;, which included re-edited scenes, new optical effects and a new sound mix. This was the director&#x27;s final project before his death.

==Personal life==
On May 25, 1942, Wise married actress Patricia Doyle. Throughout their long life together, Wise and his wife enjoyed entertaining and traveling, before she died of cancer on September 22, 1975. The couple had one son, Robert, who became an assistant cameraman. On January 29, 1977, Wise married Millicent Franklin. Millicent died on August 31, 2010, at Cedars-Sinai Hospital, Los Angeles.

Wise had an expansive bungalow on the Universal Studios lot and owned a modern California beach house. He continued to screen films for personal enjoyment and had &quot;final cut&quot; decisions on his films.

Wise suffered a heart attack and was rushed to UCLA Medical Center, where he died of heart failure on September 14, 2005, four days after his 91st birthday.

In Indiana, Governor Roger D. Branigin proclaimed March 1, 1967, Robert Wise Day in honor of the 1967 premiere of &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot; in Indianapolis. Wise was also named a Sagamore of the Wabash.

<text>Herod I or Herod the Great () was a Roman Jewish client king of the Herodian kingdom of Judea. He is known for his colossal building projects throughout Judea. Among these works are the rebuilding of the Second Temple in Jerusalem and the expansion of its base—the Western Wall being part of it. Vital details of his life are recorded in the works of the 1st century CE Roman–Jewish historian Josephus.

Despite Herod&#x27;s successes, including single-handedly forging a new aristocracy from practically nothing, he has been criticized by various historians. His reign polarizes opinion among historians, some viewing his legacy as evidence of success, and some viewing it as a reminder of his tyrannical rule.

Herod the Great is described in the Christian Bible as the coordinator of the Massacre of the Innocents. However, most of the New Testament references are to his son Herod Antipas (such as the events leading to the executions of John the Baptist and Jesus of Nazareth in ), or his grandson Herod Agrippa (in ). Upon Herod&#x27;s death in 4 BCE, the Romans divided his kingdom among three of his sons and his sister: his son Herod Antipas received the tetrarchy of Galilee and Peraea.

Other family members of Herod the Great include Herod&#x27;s son Herod Archelaus who became ethnarch of Judea, Samaria, and Idumea; Herod&#x27;s son Philip who became tetrarch of territories north and east of the Jordan River; and Herod&#x27;s sister Salome I, who was given a toparchy including the cities of Jabneh, Ashdod, and Fasayil (Phasaelis).

== Biography ==

Herod was born around 72 BCE in Idumea, south of Judea. He was the second son of Antipater the Idumaean, a high-ranking official under ethnarch Hyrcanus II, and Cypros, a Nabatean Arab princess from Petra, in present-day Jordan. Herod&#x27;s father was by descent an Edomite; his ancestors had been forcibly converted to Judaism. Herod was raised as a Jew. Strabo, a contemporary of Herod, held that the Idumaeans, whom he identified as of Nabataean origin, constituted the majority of the population of western Judea, where they commingled with the Judaeans and adopted their customs. This is a view shared also by some modern scholarly works which consider Idumaeans to be either Arab or Nabataean in origin. Thus, Herod&#x27;s ethnic background was Arab on both sides of his family. According to Josephus, Herod was a descendant of Eleazar Maccabeus (Auran) of the Hasmoneans.

Herod rose to power largely through his father&#x27;s good relations with the Roman general and dictator Julius Caesar, who entrusted Antipater with the public affairs of Judea. Herod was appointed provincial governor of Galilee in , when he was about either 25 or 28 years old (Greek original: &quot;15 years of age&quot;). There he faithfully farmed the taxes of that region for the Roman Senate, and he met with success in ridding that region of bandits. Antipater&#x27;s eldest son, Phasael, served in the same capacity as governor of Jerusalem. During this time the young Herod cultivated a good relationship with Sextus Caesar, the acting Roman governor of Syria, who appointed Herod as general of Coelesyria and Samaria, greatly expanding his sphere of influence. He enjoyed the backing of Rome, but the Sanhedrin condemned his brutality. When yet a private man, Herod had determined to punish Hyrcanus the Hasmonean king, who had once summoned Herod to stand trial for murder, but Herod was restrained from doing so by the intervention of his father and his elder brother.

In 41 BCE, the Roman leader Mark Antony named Herod and his brother Phasael as tetrarchs. They were placed in this role to support Hyrcanus II. In 40 BCE Antigonus, Hyrcanus&#x27; nephew, took the Judean throne from his uncle with the help of the Parthians. Herod fled to Rome to plead with the Romans to restore Hyrcanus II to power. The Romans had a special interest in Judea because their general Pompey the Great had conquered Jerusalem in 63 BCE, thus placing the region in the Roman sphere of influence. In Rome, Herod was unexpectedly appointed King of the Jews by the Roman Senate. Josephus puts this in the year of the consulship of Calvinus and Pollio (40 BCE), but Appian places it in 39 BCE. Herod went back to Judea to win his kingdom from Antigonus. Toward the end of the campaign against Antigonus, Herod married the granddaughter of Hyrcanus II, Mariamne (known as Mariamne I), who was also a niece of Antigonus. Herod did this in an attempt to secure his claim to the throne and gain some Jewish favor. However, Herod already had a wife, Doris, and a young son, Antipater, and chose therefore to banish Doris and her child.

Herod and Sosius, the governor of Syria, at the behest of Mark Antony, set out with a large army in 37 BCE and captured Jerusalem, Herod then sending Antigonus for execution to Mark Antony. From this moment, Herod took the role as sole ruler of Judea and the title of &quot;basileus&quot; for himself, ushering in the Herodian dynasty and ending the Hasmonean Dynasty. Josephus reports this as being in the year of the consulship of Agrippa and Gallus (37 BCE), but also says that it was exactly 27 years after Jerusalem fell to Pompey, which would indicate 36 BCE. Cassius Dio also reports that in 37 &quot;the Romans accomplished nothing worthy of note&quot; in the area. According to Josephus, Herod ruled for 37 years, 34 of them after capturing Jerusalem.

As some believe Herod&#x27;s family were converts to Judaism, his religious commitment was questioned by some elements of Jewish society. When John Hyrcanus conquered the region of Idumaea (the Edom of the Hebrew Bible) in 140–130 BCE, he required all Idumaeans to obey Jewish law or to leave; most Idumaeans thus converted to Judaism, which meant that they had to be circumcised, and many intermarried with the Jews and adopted their customs. While Herod publicly identified himself as a Jew and was considered as such by some, this religious identification was undermined by the decadent lifestyle of the Herodians, which would have earned them the antipathy of observant Jews.

Herod later executed several members of his own family, including his wife Mariamne I.

== Reign in Judea ==

Herod&#x27;s rule marked a new beginning in the history of Judea. Judea had been ruled autonomously by the Hasmonean kings from 140 until 63 BCE. The Hasmonean kings retained their titles, but became clients of Rome after the conquest by Pompey in 63 BCE. Herod overthrew the Hasmonean Antigonus in a three-year-long war between 37 and 34 BCE, ruled under Roman overlordship until his death , and officially passed on the throne to his sons, thus establishing his own, so-called Herodian dynasty.
Herod was granted the title of &quot;King of Judea&quot; by the Roman Senate. As such, he was a vassal of the Roman Empire, expected to support the interests of his Roman patrons. Nonetheless, just when Herod obtained leadership in Judea, his rule faced two threats. The first threat came from his mother-in-law Alexandra, who sought to regain power for her family, the Hasmoneans, whose dynasty Herod had overthrown in 37 BCE (see Siege of Jerusalem). In the same year, Cleopatra married the Roman leader Antony. Recognizing Cleopatra&#x27;s influence over Antony, Alexandra asked Cleopatra for aid in making Aristobulus III the High Priest. As a member of the Hasmonean family, Aristobulus III might partially repair the fortunes of the Hasmoneans if made High Priest. Alexandra&#x27;s request was made, but Cleopatra urged Alexandra to leave Judea with Aristobulus III and visit Antony. Herod received word of this plot, and feared that if Antony met Aristobolus III in person he might name Aristobulus III King of Judea. This concern induced Herod, in 35 BCE, to order the assassination of Aristobulus, ending this first threat to Herod&#x27;s throne. The marriage of 37 BCE also sparked a power struggle between Roman leaders Octavian, who would later be called Augustus, and Antony. Herod, owing his throne to Rome, had to pick a side, and he chose Antony. In 31 at Actium, Antony lost to Octavian, posing a second threat to Herod&#x27;s rule. Herod had to regain Octavian&#x27;s support if he was to keep his throne. At Rhodes in 31 BCE, Herod, through his ability to keep Judea open to Rome as a link to the wealth of Syria and Egypt, and ability to defend the frontier, convinced Octavian that he would be loyal to him. Herod continued to rule his subjects as he saw fit. Despite the autonomy afforded to Herod in his internal reign over Judea, restrictions were placed upon him in his relations with other kingdoms.

Herod&#x27;s support from the Roman Empire was a major factor in enabling him to maintain his authority over Judea. There have been mixed interpretations concerning Herod&#x27;s popularity during his reign. In &quot;The Jewish War&quot;, Josephus characterizes Herod&#x27;s rule in generally favorable terms, and gives Herod the benefit of the doubt for the infamous events that took place during his reign. However, in his later work, &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot;, Josephus emphasizes the tyrannical authority that many scholars have come to associate with Herod&#x27;s reign.

Herod&#x27;s despotic rule has been demonstrated by many of his security measures aimed at suppressing the contempt his people, especially Jews, had towards him. For instance, it has been suggested that Herod used secret police to monitor and report the feelings of the general populace toward him. He sought to prohibit protests, and had opponents removed by force. He had a bodyguard of 2,000 soldiers. Josephus describes various units of Herod&#x27;s personal guard taking part in Herod&#x27;s funeral, including the &quot;Doryphnoroi&quot;, and a Thracian, Celtic (probably Gallic) and Germanic contingent. While the term &quot;Doryphnoroi&quot; does not have an ethnic connotation, the unit was probably composed of distinguished veteran soldiers and young men from the most influential Jewish families. Thracians had served in the Jewish armies since the Hasmonean dynasty, while the Celtic contingent were former bodyguards of Cleopatra given as a gift by Augustus to Herod following the Battle of Actium. The Germanic contingent was modeled upon Augustus&#x27;s personal bodyguard, the &quot;Germani Corporis Custodes&quot;, responsible for guarding the palace.

Herod undertook many colossal building projects. Around 19 BCE, he began a massive expansion project on the Temple Mount. In addition to fully rebuilding and enlarging the Second Jewish Temple, he artificially expanded the platform on which it stood, doubling it in size. Today&#x27;s Western Wall formed part of the retaining perimeter wall of this platform. In addition, Herod also used the latest technology in hydraulic cement and underwater construction to build the harbor at Caesarea Maritima. While Herod&#x27;s zeal for building transformed Judea, his motives were not selfless. Although he built fortresses (Masada, Herodium, Alexandrium, Hyrcania, and Machaerus) in which he and his family could take refuge in case of insurrection, these vast projects were also intended to gain the support of the Jews and improve his reputation as a leader. Herod also built Sebaste and other pagan cities because he wanted to appeal to the country&#x27;s substantial pagan population. In order to fund these projects, Herod utilized a Hasmonean taxation system that heavily burdened the Judean people. Nevertheless, these enterprises brought employment and opportunities for the people&#x27;s provision. In some instances, Herod took it upon himself to provide for his people in times of need, such as during a severe famine that occurred in 25 BCE.

Although he made many attempts at conforming to traditional Jewish laws, there were more instances where Herod was insensitive, which constitutes one of the major Jewish complaints of Herod as highlighted in Josephus&#x27; &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot;. In Jerusalem, Herod introduced foreign forms of entertainment, and erected a golden eagle at the entrance of the Temple, which suggested a greater interest in the welfare of Rome than of Jews. Herod&#x27;s taxes garnered a bad reputation: his constant concern for his reputation led him to make frequent, expensive gifts, increasingly emptying the kingdom&#x27;s coffers, and such lavish spending upset his Jewish subjects. The two major Jewish sects of the day, the Pharisees and the Sadducees, both showed opposition to Herod. The Pharisees were discontented because Herod disregarded many of their demands with respect to the Temple&#x27;s construction. The Sadducees, who were closely associated with priestly responsibilities in the Temple, opposed Herod because he replaced their high priests with outsiders from Babylonia and Alexandria, in an effort to gain support from the Jewish Diaspora. Herod&#x27;s outreach efforts gained him little, and at the end of his reign anger and dissatisfaction were common amongst Jews. Heavy outbreaks of violence and riots followed Herod&#x27;s death in many cities, including Jerusalem, as pent-up resentments boiled over. The scope of the disturbances sparked hopes that the Jews of Judea might some day overthrow the Roman overlords, hopes reawakened decades later in the outbreak of the First Jewish–Roman War in 66 CE.

== Herod and Augustus ==
The relationship between Herod and Augustus demonstrates the fragile politics of a deified Emperor and a King who ruled over the Jewish people and their holy lands. As they interacted, Herod&#x27;s desire to satisfy both the Jewish and non-Jewish people of his kingdom had to be balanced with satisfying Augustus&#x27; aim to spread the culture, architecture and values of Rome throughout his empire. The sway of Augustus and the Roman Empire on the policy led to the use of Romanized construction throughout Herod&#x27;s Kingdom. An example of Herod&#x27;s architectural expansion of Judea in devotion to Rome can be seen with the third temple he commissioned, the Augusteum, a temple dedicated to Augustus.

== Architectural achievements ==
Herod&#x27;s most famous and ambitious project was the expansion of the Second Temple in Jerusalem which was undertaken so that he would &quot;have a capital city worthy of his dignity and grandeur&quot;, and with this reconstruction Herod hoped to gain more support from the Jews. Recent findings suggest that the Temple Mount walls and Robinson&#x27;s Arch may not have been completed until at least 20 years after his death, during the reign of Herod Agrippa II.

In the 18th year of his reign (20–19 BCE), Herod rebuilt the Temple on &quot;a more magnificent scale&quot;. Although work on out-buildings and courts continued for another 80 years, the new Temple was finished in a year and a half. To comply with religious law, Herod employed 1,000 priests as masons and carpenters in the rebuilding. The finished temple, which was destroyed in 70 CE, is sometimes referred to as Herod&#x27;s Temple. Today, only the four retaining walls remain standing, including the Western Wall. These walls created a flat platform (the Temple Mount) upon which the Temple was then constructed.

Herod&#x27;s other achievements include the development of water supplies for Jerusalem, building fortresses such as Masada and Herodium, and founding new cities such as Caesarea Maritima and the enclosures of Cave of the Patriarchs and Mamre in Hebron. He and Cleopatra owned a monopoly over the extraction of asphalt from the Dead Sea, which was used in shipbuilding. He leased copper mines on Cyprus from the Roman emperor.

== New Testament references ==


The Gospel of Matthew describes an episode known as the Massacre of the Innocents. According to this account, after the birth of Jesus, a group of magi from the East visited Herod to inquire the whereabouts of &quot;the one having been born king of the Jews&quot;, because they had seen his star in the east (or, according to certain translations, at its rising) and therefore wanted to pay him homage. Herod, as King of the Jews, was alarmed at the prospect of a usurper. Herod assembled the chief priests and scribes of the people and asked them where the &quot;Anointed One&quot; (the Messiah, ) was to be born. They answered, in Bethlehem, citing Micah 5:2. Herod therefore sent the magi to Bethlehem, instructing them to search for the child and, after they had found him, to &quot;report to me, so that I too may go and worship him&quot;. However, after they had found Jesus, they were warned in a dream not to report back to Herod. Similarly, Joseph was warned in a dream that Herod intended to kill Jesus, so he and his family fled to Egypt. When Herod realized he had been outwitted, he gave orders to kill all boys of the age of two and under in Bethlehem and its vicinity. Joseph and his family stayed in Egypt until Herod&#x27;s death, then moved to Nazareth in Galilee to avoid living under Herod&#x27;s son Archelaus.

Most modern biographers of Herod, and a majority of biblical scholars, dismiss Matthew&#x27;s story as a literary device. Contemporary non-biblical sources, including Josephus and the surviving writings of Nicolaus of Damascus (who knew Herod personally), provide no corroboration for Matthew&#x27;s account of the massacre, and it is not mentioned in the Gospel of Luke. Classical historian Michael Grant states &quot;[t]he tale is not history but myth or folk-lore&quot;, while Peter Richardson notes that the story&#x27;s absence from the Gospel of Luke and the accounts of Josephus &quot;work[s] against the account&#x27;s accuracy&quot;. Richardson suggests that the event in Matthew&#x27;s gospel was inspired by Herod&#x27;s murder of his own sons. Jodi Magness has said that &quot;many scholars believe that the massacre of the innocents never occurred, but instead was inspired by Herod&#x27;s reputation&quot;. Others, such as Paul Maier, suggest that since Bethlehem was a smaller town, the slaughter of about a half dozen children would not have warranted a mention from Josephus.

== Death ==

Herod died in Jericho, after an unidentified but excruciatingly painful, putrefying illness, known to posterity as &quot;Herod&#x27;s Evil&quot;. Josephus states that the pain of his illness led Herod to attempt suicide by stabbing, and that the attempt was thwarted by his cousin. In some much later narratives and depictions, the attempt succeeds; for example, in the 12th-century Eadwine Psalter. Other medieval dramatizations, such as the Ordo Rachelis, follow Josephus&#x27; account.

Josephus stated that Herod was so concerned that no one would mourn his death that he commanded a large group of distinguished men to come to Jericho, and he gave an order that they should be killed at the time of his death so that the displays of grief that he craved would take place; his brother-in-law Alexas and his sister Salome did not carry out this wish.

=== Dating ===
Most scholarship concerning the date of Herod&#x27;s death follows Emil Schürer&#x27;s calculations, which suggest that the date was in or around 4 BCE; this is three years earlier than the previous consensus and tradition (1 BCE).
Two of Herod&#x27;s sons, Archelaus and Philip the Tetrarch, dated their rule from 4 BCE, though Archelaus apparently held royal authority during Herod&#x27;s lifetime. Philip&#x27;s reign would last for 37 years, until his death in the 20th year of Tiberius (34 CE), which implies his accession as 4 BCE.

Some scholars support the traditional date of 1 BCE for Herod&#x27;s death.

Filmer, for example, proposes that Herod died in 1 BCE, and that his heirs backdated their reigns to 4 or 3 BCE to assert an overlapping with Herod&#x27;s rule, and bolster their own legitimacy. Based on the coins of Herod&#x27;s sons Steinmann and Young argue that Herod&#x27;s sons antedated their reigns to 6 BCE before Herod&#x27;s death so that their reigns cannot be used to argue for a 4 BCE date for Herod&#x27;s death.

In Josephus&#x27; account, Herod&#x27;s death was preceded by first a Jewish fast day (10 Tevet 3761/Sun 24 Dec 1 BCE), a lunar eclipse and followed by Passover (27 March 1 CE). Objections to the 4 BCE date include the assertion that there was not nearly enough time between the eclipse on March 13 and Passover on April 10 for the recorded events surrounding Herod&#x27;s death to have taken place.
In 66 CE, Eleazar ben Hanania compiled the Megillat Taanit, which contains two unattributed entries for cause of festivity: 7 Kislev and 2 Shevat. A later Scholion (commentary) on the Megillat Taanit attributes the 7 Kislev festivity to king Herod the Great&#x27;s death (no year is mentioned). Some scholars ignore the Scholion and attribute the 2 Shevat date instead to Herod&#x27;s death.

=== Successors ===
Augustus respected the terms of Herod&#x27;s will, which stipulated the division of Herod&#x27;s kingdom among three of his sons. Augustus recognised Herod&#x27;s son Herod Archelaus as ethnarch of Judea, Samaria, and Idumea from Augustus then judged Archelaus incompetent to rule, removed him from power, and combined the provinces of Samaria, Judea proper, and Idumea into Iudaea province. This enlarged province was ruled by a prefect until the year 41 CE. As to Herod&#x27;s other sons, Herod Antipas was tetrarch of Galilee and Peraea from Herod&#x27;s death to 39 CE when he was deposed and exiled; Philip became tetrarch of territories north and east of the Jordan, namely Iturea, Trachonitis, Batanea, Gaulanitis, Auranitis and Paneas, and ruled until his death in 34 CE.

== Herod&#x27;s tomb ==
The location of Herod&#x27;s tomb is documented by Josephus, who writes, &quot;And the body was carried two hundred furlongs, to Herodium, where he had given order to be buried.&quot; Professor Ehud Netzer, an archaeologist from the Hebrew University, read the writings of Josephus and focused his search on the vicinity of the pool and its surroundings. An article in the &quot;New York Times&quot; states,
Lower Herodium consists of the remains of a large palace, a race track, service quarters, and a monumental building whose function is still a mystery. Perhaps, says Ehud Netzer, who excavated the site, it is Herod&#x27;s mausoleum. Next to it is a pool, almost twice as large as modern Olympic-size pools.

On May 7, 2007, an Israeli team of archaeologists of Hebrew University, led by Netzer, announced they had discovered the tomb. The site is located at the exact location given by Josephus, atop tunnels and water pools, at a flattened desert site, halfway up the hill to Herodium, south of Jerusalem. The tomb contained a broken sarcophagus but no remains of a body.

Not all scholars agree with Netzer: in an article for the &quot;Palestine Exploration Quarterly&quot;, archaeologist David Jacobson (University of Oxford) wrote that &quot;these finds are not conclusive on their own and they also raise new questions.&quot; In October 2013, archaeologists Joseph Patrich and Benjamin Arubas also challenged the identification of the tomb as that of Herod. According to Patrich and Arubas, the tomb is too modest to be Herod&#x27;s and has several unlikely features. Roi Porat, who replaced Netzer as excavation leader after the latter&#x27;s death, stood by the identification.

The Israel Nature and Parks Authority and the Gush Etzion Regional Council intend to recreate the tomb out of a light plastic material, a proposal that has received strong criticism from major Israeli archeologists.

== Opinions of his reign ==
Macrobius (), one of the last pagan writers in Rome, in his book &quot;Saturnalia&quot;, wrote: &quot;When it was heard that, as part of the slaughter of boys up to two years old, Herod, king of the Jews, had ordered his own son to be killed, he [the Emperor Augustus] remarked, &#x27;It is better to be Herod&#x27;s pig [Gr. hys] than his son&#x27; [Gr. hyios]&quot;. This was a reference of how Herod, as a Jew, would not kill pigs, but had three of his sons, and many others, killed.
According to contemporary historians, Herod the Great &quot;is perhaps the only figure in ancient Jewish history who has been loathed equally by Jewish and Christian posterity&quot;, depicted both by Jews and Christians as a tyrant and bloodthirsty ruler. The study of Herod&#x27;s reign includes polarizing opinions on the man himself. Modern critics have described him as &quot;the evil genius of the Judean nation&quot;, and as one who would be &quot;prepared to commit any crime in order to gratify his unbounded ambition.&quot; His extraordinary spending spree is cited as one of the causes of the serious impoverishment of the people he ruled, adding to the opinion that his reign was exclusively negative. Herod&#x27;s religious policies gained a mixed response from the Jewish populace. Although Herod considered himself king of the Jews, he let it be known that he also represented the non-Jews living in Judea, building temples for other religions outside of the Jewish areas of his kingdom. Many Jews questioned the authenticity of Herod&#x27;s Judaism on account of his Idumean background and his infamous murders of members of his family. However, he generally respected traditional Jewish observances in his public life. For instance, he minted coins without human images to be used in Jewish areas and acknowledged the sanctity of the Second Temple by employing priests as artisans in its construction.
Along with holding some respect for the Jewish culture in his public life, there is also evidence of Herod&#x27;s sensitivity toward Jewish traditions in his private life: around 40 ritual baths or were found in several of his palaces. These were known for being used during this time in Jewish purity rituals in which Jewish people could submerge themselves and purify their bodies without the presence of a priest. There is some speculation as to whether or not these baths were actual as they have also been identified as stepped or Roman cold-water baths; however, several historians have identified these baths as a combination of both types. While it has been proven that Herod showed a great amount of disrespect toward the Jewish religion, scholar Eyal Regev suggests that the presence of these ritual baths shows that Herod found ritual purity important enough in his private life to place a large number of these baths in his palaces despite his several connections to gentiles and pagan cults. These baths also show, Regev continues, that the combination of the Roman and the Jewish suggests that Herod sought some type of combination between the Roman and Jewish cultures, as he enjoyed the purity of Jewish tradition and the comfort of Roman luxury simultaneously.

However, he was also praised for his work, being considered the greatest builder in Jewish history, and one who &quot;knew his place and followed [the] rules&quot;. What is left of his building ventures are now popular tourist attractions in the Middle East.

== Chronology ==

=== 39–20 BCE ===
* 39–37 BCE – War against Antigonus the Hasmonean begins. After the conquest of Jerusalem and victory over Antigonus, Mark Antony executes him.
* 36 BCE – Herod makes his 17-year-old brother-in-law Aristobulus III high priest, fearing that the Jews would appoint him as King of the Jews in his place.
* 35 BCE – Aristobulus III is drowned at a party on Herod&#x27;s orders.
* 32 BCE – The Nabatean war begins, with victory one year later.
* 31 BCE – Judea suffers a devastating earthquake. Octavian defeats Mark Antony, and Herod switches allegiances to him.
* 30 BCE – Herod is shown great favor by Octavian, who confirms him as King of Judea at Rhodes.

* 29 BCE – According to Josephus, amid Herod&#x27;s great passion and jealousy concerning his wife Mariamne I, she learns of Herod&#x27;s plans to murder her and stops sleeping with him. Herod charges her with adultery and puts her on trial. His sister Salome I is the primary witness against her. Mariamne&#x27;s mother Alexandra makes an appearance to further incriminate her daughter. Historians speculate that Alexandra was next on Herod&#x27;s list to be executed, and she only did this to save her own life. Mariamne is executed, and Alexandra declares herself Queen, stating that Herod was mentally unfit to serve. Josephus states that this is a strategic mistake, and Herod executes her without a trial.
* 28 BCE – Herod executes his brother-in-law Kostobar, husband of Salome and father to Berenice, for conspiracy. There is a large festival in Jerusalem, as Herod had built a theater and an amphitheater.
* 27 BCE – An assassination attempt on Herod is foiled. To honor now-Emperor Augustus, Herod rebuilt Samaria, and renames it Sebaste.
* 25 BCE – Herod imports grain from Egypt and starts an aid program to combat widespread hunger and disease following a massive drought. He also waives a third of taxes due. He begins construction on Caesarea Maritima and its adjoining harbor.
* 23 BCE – Herod builds a palace in Jerusalem as well as the Herodion fortress. He marries his third wife Mariamne II, the daughter of the priest Simon Boethus. Immediately, Herodes deprives Jesus, son of Fabus of the high priesthood, and confers that dignity on Simon instead.
* 22 BCE – Augustus grants Herod the regions of Trachonitis, Batanaea, and Auranitis in the northeast.
* – Expansion starts on the Temple Mount; Herod completely rebuilds the Second Temple.

=== 19–4 BCE ===

* – Herod traveled to Rome for the second time.
* 14 BCE – Herod supports the Jews in Anatolia and Cyrene. Owing to prosperity in Judea, he waives a quarter of taxes due.
* 13 BCE – Herod makes his first-born son Antipater, by Doris, first heir in his will.
* 12 BCE – Herod suspects his sons Alexander and Aristobulus, from his marriage to Mariamne, of threatening his life. He takes them to Aquileia to be put on trial. Augustus ultimately reconciles the three. Herod supports the financially strapped Olympic Games and ensures their future. He amends his will so that Alexander and Aristobulus rise in the succession plans, but Antipater remains the primary heir.
* – The newly expanded temple in Jerusalem is inaugurated. War breaks out against the Nabateans.
* 9 BCE – Caesarea Maritima is inaugurated. Owing to the course of the Nabatean war, Herod falls out of favor with Augustus. He again suspects Alexander of plotting to kill him.
* 8 BCE – Herod accuses his sons Alexander and Aristobulus of high treason. He reconciles with Augustus, who also gives him permission to prosecute his sons.
* 7 BCE – Court hearings take place in Beirut in front of a Roman court. Alexander and Aristobulus are found guilty and executed. The succession is amended such that that Antipater becomes the exclusive successor to the throne. Herod Philip, his son by Mariamne II, is now second in the line of succession.
* 6 BCE – Herod takes action against the Pharisees.
* 5 BCE – Antipater is brought before a court, charged with plotting to murder Herod. Now seriously ill, Herod names his son Herod Antipas from his fourth marriage with Malthace as successor.
* 4 BCE – Young disciples of the Pharisees smash the golden eagle over the main entrance of the Temple after their teachers label it as an idolatrous symbol. Herod arrests them, brings them to court, and sentences them. Augustus approves the death penalty for Antipater. Herod executes his son, and changes his will again: now Herod Archelaus, from the marriage with Malthace, would rule as ethnarch over the tetrachy of Judea, while Herod Antipas by Malthace and Philip from Herod&#x27;s fifth marriage with Cleopatra of Jerusalem would rule as tetrarchs over Galilee and Perea, as well as over Gaulanitis, Trachonitis, Batanaea, and Panias. Salome I was also given a small toparchy in the Gaza region. As Augustus did not confirm this revision, no one receives the title of King. However, the three sons were ultimately granted rule of the stated territories.

== Family ==
=== Wives and children ===

It is very probable that Herod had more children, especially with the last wives, and also that he had more daughters, as female births at that time were often not recorded. As polygamy (the practice of having multiple wives at once) was then permitted under Jewish law, Herod&#x27;s later marriages were almost certainly polygamous.

<text>The Massacre (or Slaughter) of the Innocents is a story recounted in the Nativity narrative of the Gospel of Matthew (2:16–18) in which Herod the Great, king of Judea, orders the execution of all male children who are two years old and under in the vicinity of Bethlehem. Modern scholarship finds no evidence that it happened outside the passages in Matthew, though it is congruous with Herod&#x27;s character.

The Feast of the Holy Innocents, also known as Childermas, is celebrated in the Western Christian Churches on 28 December, the fourth day of Christmastide. In Eastern Christianity, the feast is celebrated on various dates, depending on the denomination.

==Biblical narrative==
The Gospel of Matthew tells how the Magi visit Jerusalem to seek guidance as to where the king of the Jews has been born; King Herod directs them to Bethlehem and asks them to return to him and report, but they are warned in a dream that Herod wishes to find the child and kill him, and do not do so. Matthew continues:

This is followed by a reference to and quotation from the Book of Jeremiah (Jeremiah 31:15) (Jeremiah 31:14 in the Hebrew Bible): &quot;Then what was said through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled: A voice is heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because they are no more.&quot; (Matthew 2:17–18). The relevance of this to the massacre is not immediately apparent, as Jeremiah&#x27;s next verses go on to speak of hope and restoration.

==History and theology==
The historicity of the Matthew account is not accepted by many scholars. The story of the massacre is found in no gospel other than Matthew, nor is it mentioned in the surviving works of Nicolaus of Damascus (who was a personal friend of Herod the Great), nor in Josephus&#x27;s &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot;, despite his recording many of Herod&#x27;s misdeeds, including the murder of three of his own sons. The early 5th-century account of Macrobius—that &quot;on hearing that the son of Herod, king of the Jews, had been slain when Herod ordered that all boys in Syria under the age of two be killed, [Augustus] said, &#x27;It&#x27;s better to be Herod&#x27;s pig than his son&#x27;&quot;—has been discounted as extra-biblical evidence for the event due to its later authorship, possible influence by the gospel narrative, and the confused nature of the account. In view of the lack of independent confirmation that the event occurred, many scholars hold that the story is folklore inspired by Herod&#x27;s reputation.

Historian Paul L. Maier contended that the story&#x27;s invention would have been a liability for Christians and—by pointing to Herod&#x27;s violent actions and plans—argued that &quot;one of the most doubted episodes in the New Testament has stronger historical credibility than it has thus far been accorded in critical scholarship.&quot; New Testament scholar Richard T. France held that, if this were a historical incident, it is unsurprising that it was not recorded by other historical sources due to the likely limited scale of the violence. While France believed that Josephus would have mentioned the event had he been aware of it, France would not have been surprised if Josephus was ignorant of what would have been a minor episode of local violence. New Testament scholar Eugene Eung-Chun Park contested France&#x27;s conclusion, saying that a small-scale massacre would have still &quot;merited a remark by competent historians&quot;.

Joan E. Taylor and Anthony Le Donne observe that Herod was a vindictive and harsh ruler, while it was common for Jews at the time to face becoming refugees, frequently in Egypt. Taylor argues that the Historical Jesus could indeed have been a refugee whose background shaped his teachings. James DG Dunn also views Herod&#x27;s massacre as an action in line with his known character. 

The author appears to have modeled the episode on the biblical story of Pharaoh&#x27;s attempt to kill the Israelite children in the Book of Exodus, as told in an expanded version that was current in the 1st century. In that expanded story, Pharaoh kills the Hebrew children after his scribes warn him of the impending birth of the threat to his crown (i.e., Moses), but Moses&#x27; father and mother are warned in a dream that the child&#x27;s life is in danger and act to save him. Later in life, after Moses has to flee, like Jesus, he returns when those who sought his death are themselves dead.

As a matter of understanding what the myth is trying to communicate, its lack of historicity is unsurprising given that gospels were primarily written as theological documents rather than chronological timelines.

==Numbers==
The Byzantine Rite liturgy asserts 14,000 Holy Innocents, while an early Syrian list of saints asserts 64,000. Coptic sources assert 144,000 and that it took place on 29 December. Frederick George Holweck&#x27;s 1910 entry on the subject in the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; referenced estimates that both assumed the event actually occurred and recognized that Bethlehem was too small a town to provide such numbers, reducing the victims to between six and 20 children in the town. France, citing estimates that Bethlehem&#x27;s population would have been around 1,000 people at the time the event was supposed to occur, concurred with an upper limit of around 20 children killed if it was indeed a historical event.

==In Christian art==
Medieval liturgical drama recounted Biblical events, including Herod&#x27;s slaughter of the innocents. &quot;The Pageant of the Shearmen and Tailors&quot;, performed in Coventry, England, included a haunting song about the episode now known as the Coventry Carol. The &quot;Ordo Rachelis&quot; tradition of four plays includes the Flight into Egypt, Herod&#x27;s succession by Archelaus, the return from Egypt, as well as the Massacre, all centered on Rachel weeping in fulfillment of Jeremiah&#x27;s prophecy. These events were likewise in one of the medieval N-Town Plays.

The &quot;Coventry Carol&quot; is a Christmas carol dating from the 16th century. The carol was performed in Coventry in England as part of a mystery play called &quot;The Pageant of the Shearmen and Tailors&quot;. The play depicts the Christmas story from chapter two in the Gospel of Matthew. The carol refers to the Massacre of the Innocents, in which Herod ordered all male infants two years old and under in Bethlehem to be killed. The lyrics of this haunting carol represent a mother&#x27;s lament for her doomed child. The author is unknown. The oldest known text was written down by Robert Croo in 1534, and the melody dates from 1591. The carol is traditionally sung a cappella.

The 17th century Dutch Christmas song &quot;O Kerstnacht, schoner dan de dagen&quot;, while beginning with a reference to Christmas Night, is about the Massacre of the Innocents. In 1974, the Dutch progressive rock band Focus recorded the first two verses of the song for their album &quot;Hamburger Concerto&quot;.

The theme of the &quot;Massacre of the Innocents&quot; has provided artists of many nationalities with opportunities to compose complicated depictions of massed bodies in violent action. It was an alternative to the &quot;Flight into Egypt&quot; in cycles of the Life of the Virgin. It decreased in popularity in Gothic art, but revived in the larger works of the Renaissance, when artists took inspiration for their &quot;Massacres&quot; from Roman reliefs of the battle of the Lapiths and Centaurs to the extent that they showed the figures heroically nude. The horrific subject matter of the Massacre of the Innocents also provided a comparison of ancient brutalities with the brutalities of the early modern period, during the period of religious wars that followed the Reformation Bruegel&#x27;s versions show the soldiers carrying banners with the Habsburg double-headed eagle.

The 1590 version by Cornelis van Haarlem also seems to reflect the violence of the Dutch Revolt. Guido Reni&#x27;s early (1611) &quot;Massacre of the Innocents&quot;, in an unusual vertical format, is at Bologna. The Flemish painter Peter Paul Rubens painted the theme more than once. One version, now in Munich, was engraved and reproduced as a painting as far away as colonial Peru.
===Paintings===
* &quot;Massacre of the Innocents&quot; by the Bruegels. Several versions of &quot;The Massacre of the Innocents&quot; were painted by Pieter Bruegel the Elder (c. 1565–67) and his son Pieter Brueghel the Younger (into the 17th century).
* &quot;Massacre of the Innocents&quot; by Guido Reni, created in 1611 for the Basilica of San Domenico in Bologna, but now in the Pinacoteca Nazionale in that city
* Two versions by Peter Paul Rubens, painted in 1611–1612 and 1636–1638
* &quot;The Massacre of the Innocents&quot; by Nicolas Poussin, painted between 1625 and 1632
* &quot;Massacre of the Innocents&quot; by Matteo di Giovanni

===Music===
The communion motet for the Feast of the Holy Innocents is the text from Matthew 2:18 (citing Jeremiah 31:15) &quot;Vox in Rama&quot;. This was set polyphonically by a number of composers of the renaissance and baroque, including Jacob Clemens non Papa, Giaches de Wert, and Heinrich Schütz (in German). 

Marc-Antoine Charpentier composed an oratorio, , H.411, for soloists, chorus, two violins, and continuo (1683–1685).

==Feast day==

===Dates by denomination===
Today, the date of Holy Innocents&#x27; Day, also called the Feast of the Holy Innocents, or Childermas or Children&#x27;s Mass, varies.
* 27 December for West Syrians (Syriac Orthodox Church, Syro-Malankara Catholic Church, and Maronite Church)
* 28 December in the Church of England (Festival), the Lutheran Church, and the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church, with these Western Christian denominations celebrating Childermas as the fourth day of Christmastide
* 29 December for the Eastern Orthodox Church

===Beginnings===
The commemoration of the massacre of the Holy Innocents, traditionally regarded as the first Christian martyrs, if unknowingly so, first appears as a feast of the Western church in the Leonine Sacramentary, dating from about 485. The earliest commemorations were connected with the Feast of the Epiphany, 6 January: Prudentius mentions the Innocents in his hymn on the Epiphany. Leo in his homilies on the Epiphany speaks of the Innocents. Fulgentius of Ruspe (6th century) gives a homily (&quot;On Epiphany, and on the murder of the Innocents and the gifts of the Magi&quot;).

===Catholic medieval traditions===
From the time of Charlemagne, Sicarius of Bethlehem was venerated at Brantôme, Dordogne as one of the purported victims of the Massacre.

In the Middle Ages, especially north of the Alps, the day was a festival of inversion involving role reversal between children and adults such as teachers and priests, with boy bishops presiding over some church services. Bonnie Blackburn and Leofranc Holford-Strevens suggest that this was a Christianized version of the Roman annual feast of the Saturnalia (when even slaves played &quot;masters&quot; for a day). In some regions, such as medieval England and France, it was said to be an unlucky day when no new project should be started.

There was a medieval custom of refraining where possible from work on the day of the week on which the feast of &quot;Innocents Day&quot; had fallen for the whole of the following year until the next Innocents Day. Philippe de Commynes, the minister of King Louis XI of France, tells in his memoirs how the king observed this custom, and describes the trepidation he felt when he had to inform the king of an emergency on the day.

===Contemporary traditions in Western Christianity===
In denominations of Western Christianity, such as Catholicism and Lutheranism, some Christians attend Mass on Childermas to remember the martyrdom of the Holy Innocents.

In England, the memorial is referred to as Childermas or Children&#x27;s Mass in which &quot;Children are given a blessing; they sing in the choir and take on other special roles in the church service.&quot;

In Spain, Hispanic America, and the Philippines, 28 December is still a day for pranks, equivalent to April Fool&#x27;s Day in many countries. Pranks () are also known as and their victims are called ; alternatively, the pranksters are the and the victims should not be angry at them, since they could not have committed any sin. One of the more famous of these traditions is the annual &quot;Els Enfarinats&quot; festival of Ibi in Alacant, where the dress up in full military dress and incite a flour fight.

In Trinidad and Tobago, Catholic children have their toys blessed at a Mass.

===Roman Rite before and after 1955===
In the Roman Rite prior to 1955, a unique feature of this feast was the use of liturgical elements ordinarily ascribed to penitential days—including violet vestments, the omission of the Gloria, and the substitution of a Tract in place of the Alleluia—unless the feast fell on Sunday, in which case the rubrics required the feast to be celebrated as on its octave day, with red vestments, Gloria, and Alleluia. The octave of this feast was suppressed by Pope Pius XII in 1955, with the feast now celebrated using the features formerly ascribed to its octave day, a practice reinforced by the 1960 Code of Rubrics.

<doc id="67763" wikidata="Q173585" url="?curid=67763" title="Jessica Lange">
<text>Jessica Phyllis Lange (; born April 20, 1949) is an American actress. Known for her roles on stage and screen she has received numerous accolades and is one of the few performers to achieve the Triple Crown of Acting. Lange has received two Academy Awards, three Primetime Emmy Awards, five Golden Globe Awards, and a Tony Award as well as nominations for a BAFTA Award and a Olivier Award.

Lange made her professional film debut in the remake &quot;King Kong&quot; (1976) which, despite receiving mixed reviews, earned her the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year. Lange went on to receive two Academy Awards, her first for Best Supporting Actress as a soap opera star in the comedy &quot;Tootsie&quot; (1982) and her second for Best Actress playing a bipolar housewife in &quot;Blue Sky&quot; (1994). Her other Oscar-nominated roles were for &quot;Frances&quot; (1982), &quot;Country&quot; (1984), &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; (1985), and &quot;Music Box&quot; (1989). She also acted in films such as &quot;All That Jazz&quot; (1979), &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot; (1981), &quot;Crimes of the Heart&quot; (1986), &quot;Cape Fear&quot; (1991), &quot;Rob Roy&quot; (1995), and &quot;Big Fish&quot; (2003).

For her roles on television she received her first Primetime Emmy Award for her portrayal of Big Edie in the HBO movie &quot;Grey Gardens&quot; (2009). Lange gained new recognition by starring in FX&#x27;s horror anthology, &quot;American Horror Story&quot; (2011–2015, 2018), which earned her two additional Primetime Emmys for its first and third seasons. She was Emmy-nominated for her roles as Blanche DuBois in the CBS film &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; (1995), a wife in the HBO television movie &quot;Normal&quot; (2003), and Joan Crawford in FX the miniseries &quot;Feud: Bette and Joan&quot; (2017). Lange has also acted in the television films &quot;O Pioneers!&quot; (1992), and &quot;The Great Lillian Hall&quot; (2024) as well as the Netflix series &quot;The Politician&quot; (2019).

On stage, Lange made her Broadway debut as Blanche DuBois in the revival of the Tennessee Williams play &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; (1992). Lange won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for her role as Mary Cavan Tyrone in the Broadway revival of the Eugene O&#x27;Neill play &quot;Long Day&#x27;s Journey into Night&quot; (2016). Lange returned to Broadway playing the hardheaded matriarch in the Paula Vogel play &quot;Mother Play&quot; (2024).

Lange is also a photographer with five published books of photography. She has been a foster parent and holds a Goodwill Ambassador position for UNICEF, specializing in HIV/AIDS in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Russia.

==Early life and education==
Jessica Phyllis Lange was born on April 20, 1949, in Cloquet, Minnesota. Her father, Albert John Lange, was a teacher and traveling salesman, and her mother, Dorothy Florence (née Sahlman), was a housewife. She has two older sisters, Jane and Ann, and a younger brother, George. Her paternal ancestry is German and Dutch, her maternal ancestry Finnish.
 Due to the nature of her father&#x27;s professions, her family moved more than a dozen times to various towns and cities in Minnesota before settling down in her hometown, where she graduated from Cloquet High School.

In 1967, she received a scholarship to study art and photography at the University of Minnesota, where she met and began dating Spanish photographer Paco Grande. After the two married in 1970, Lange dropped out of college to pursue a more bohemian lifestyle, traveling through the United States and Mexico in a microbus with Grande. The pair then moved to Paris, where they drifted apart. While in Paris, Lange studied mime theater under the supervision of Étienne Decroux and joined the Opéra-Comique as a dancer. She later studied acting with Mira Rostova and at HB Studio in New York City.

==Career==
===1976–1989: Breakthrough and acclaim ===
While living in Paris, Lange was discovered by fashion illustrator Antonio Lopez and became a model for the Wilhelmina modelling agency. In 1973, she returned to the U.S. and began work in New York City as A waitress at the Lion&#x27;s Head Tavern in Greenwich Village. While modeling, Lange was discovered by Hollywood producer Dino De Laurentiis, who was looking to cast an ingenue for his remake of &quot;King Kong&quot;. Lange made her film debut in the 1976 &quot;King Kong&quot;, beating actresses Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn for the role of &quot;damsel-in-distress&quot;. Despite the film&#x27;s successit was the fifth-highest-grossing film of 1976 and received an Academy Award for Best Visual Effectsit and Lange&#x27;s performance were widely panned. But film critic Pauline Kael wrote, &quot;The movie is sparked by Jessica Lange&#x27;s fast yet dreamy comic style. [She] has the high, wide forehead and clear-eyed transparency of Carole Lombard in &quot;My Man Godfrey&quot;, [and] one liners so dumb that the audience laughs and moans at the same time, yet they&#x27;re in character, and when Lange says them she holds the eye and you like her, the way people liked Lombard.&quot; Lange won the 1976 Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year. She remained a favorite of Kael, who later wrote, &quot;She has a facial structure that the camera yearns for, and she has talent, too.&quot;

At the close of the decade, Bob Fosse, whom Lange had befriended and with whom she had carried on a casual romantic affair, cast Lange as Angelique, the Angel of Death, a part he had written for her in his semi-autobiographical film &quot;All That Jazz&quot; (1979). She was also considered for the role of Wendy Torrance in Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s horror film &quot;The Shining&quot; (1980) before it went to Shelley Duvall.

Lange began the new decade in the light romp &quot;How to Beat the High Cost of Living&quot; (1980), co-starring Jane Curtin and Susan Saint James, which received mostly negative reviews and quickly disappeared from theaters. A year later, director Bob Rafelson contacted her about a project he was working on with Jack Nicholson, who had recently auditioned Lange for &quot;Goin&#x27; South&quot; (1978). Rafelson paid Lange a visit in upstate New York, where she was doing summer stock theater and has recounted how he watched her conversing on the telephone for half an hour before their meeting when he decided he had found the lead for his film. After meeting Lange, he wrote her name down on a piece of paper, placed it in an envelope, and sealed it. After several meetings and auditions with other actresses (though Rafelson had already made his decision, he feared he had done so too quickly and wanted to make sure his choice was right), the final choice was between Lange and Meryl Streep. In the end, Rafelson offered Lange the lead role opposite Nicholson in his remake of the classic film noir &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot; (1981). Upon offering her the part, he gave her the sealed envelope. The film received mixed reviews, but Lange was highly praised for her performance.

While editing &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice,&quot; Graeme Clifford realized he had found the leading lady for his next film, his first as a director: a biographical film of actress Frances Farmer, whose disillusionment with Hollywood and chaotic family background led her down a tragic path. Filming &quot;Frances&quot; (1982), which co-starred Kim Stanley and Sam Shepard, was a grueling experience for Lange, who pored over the screenplay scene by scene, making deep and often taxing connections between her life and Farmer&#x27;s to tap into the well of emotions the role required. By the end of the shoot, she was physically and mentally spent, and decided to take Stanley&#x27;s advice to do &quot;something light,&quot; which led her to accept a supporting role opposite Dustin Hoffman in Sydney Pollack&#x27;s &quot;Tootsie&quot; (1982).

In 1982, Lange became the first performer in 40 years to receive two Academy Award nominations in the same year, for &quot;Frances&quot; and for &quot;Tootsie,&quot; winning the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her work in the latter, which not only became the second-highest-grossing film of 1982 after Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;, it also scored an additional nine Oscar nominations, including one for Best Picture. Her performance in the film also earned her a Golden Globe, along with awards from the National Society of Film Critics, the New York Film Critics Circle, the Boston Society of Film Critics, and the Kansas City Film Critics Circle. Lange also won Best Actress at the Moscow International Film Festival for her performance in &quot;Frances&quot;.

Lange next produced and starred, again opposite Shepard, in 1984&#x27;s &quot;Country,&quot; a topical film depicting a family during the farm crisis. Her performance earned her Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations for Best Actress. That same year, she made her television debut as Maggie the Cat, starring opposite Tommy Lee Jones in a CBS &quot;Playhouse&quot; production of Tennessee Williams&#x27;s &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot;. The following year, she testified before the United States Congress on behalf of the Democratic House Task Force on Agriculture, alongside Jane Fonda and Sissy Spacek, whom she later befriended.

At the close of 1985, she portrayed legendary country singer Patsy Cline in Karel Reisz&#x27;s biopic &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot;, opposite Ed Harris, Ann Wedgeworth, Gary Basaraba, and John Goodman. She was nominated a fourth time for an Oscar and came in second for both the National Board of Review Award for Best Actress and the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress. In several interviews, Meryl Streep has said she &quot;begged&quot; Reisz, who directed her in 1981&#x27;s &quot;The French Lieutenant&#x27;s Woman&quot;, for the role of Cline, but his first choice had always been Lange. Streep has been quite vocal and adamant in her praise for Lange&#x27;s performance, calling her &quot;beyond wonderful&quot; in the film and saying, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t imagine doing it as well or even coming close to what Jessica did because she was so amazing in it.&quot; In 2012, on an episode of &quot;Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen&quot;, Streep once again praised Lange&#x27;s work in the film, saying, &quot;Nobody could do that better than [Lange]. I mean, it was divine.&quot; In 2018, she further commented, &quot;Jessica did it better than any human being could possibly have done it.&quot; Streep has also said, &quot;Every job I&#x27;ve ever taken, about three weeks before I begin, I call up my agent and say, &#x27;I don&#x27;t think I can do this. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m right for it. They should call up Jessica Lange.&#x27; &quot;

Lange&#x27;s films in the mid- to late 1980s, which included &quot;Crimes of the Heart&quot; (1986), &quot;Far North&quot; (1988), and &quot;Everybody&#x27;s All-American&quot; (1989), were mostly low-profile and underperformed at the box office, though she was often singled out and praised for her work. In 1989, she starred in Costa-Gavras&#x27;s &quot;Music Box&quot; as a Hungarian lawyer defending her father of Nazi war crimes. Her performance earned her a fifth Academy Award nomination and a sixth Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress.

===1990–2008: Established actress ===

Lange continued making films throughout the 1990s, periodically taking time off to raise her children and do theater- and television-based projects. She began the decade in Paul Brickman&#x27;s warmly received &quot;Men Don&#x27;t Leave&quot; (1990), for which she earned positive reviews and came in third place for the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress. She was then approached by Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro, who had both auditioned her for the role of Jake LaMotta&#x27;s wife in &quot;Raging Bull&quot; (1980), to star in a remake of &quot;Cape Fear&quot; (1991). The film was the year&#x27;s 12th- highest-grossing film. In 1992, Lange once again starred opposite De Niro in Irwin Winkler&#x27;s &quot;Night and the City&quot;, and in a television adaptation of Willa Cather&#x27;s &quot;O Pioneers!&quot;, receiving her seventh Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress. Lange made her Broadway debut, which met mixed reviews portraying Blanche DuBois in a production of Tennessee Williams&#x27;s &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; opposite Alec Baldwin. Critics rebuked her performance, with the Boston Globe stating &quot;Jessica Lange is learning a new craft—theatre—at Blanche’s expense, and ours.&quot;

In 1994, Lange was lauded for her performance as a manic depressive army wife in the 1960s in Tony Richardson&#x27;s final film, &quot;Blue Sky&quot;. In 1995, she won the Academy Award for Best Actress for this performance, along with the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress, the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress, the Utah Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress, and the Sant Jordi Award for Best Actress. She also came in second place for the National Board of Review Award for Best Actress, the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress, and the Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress. She became the second actress, after Streep, to follow a Best Supporting Actress Oscar with a Best Actress Oscar, an achievement not repeated until nearly 20 years later by Cate Blanchett. Despite its critical praise, and despite Lange&#x27;s Oscar-winning performance &quot;Blue Sky&quot; was not a box office success.

In 1995, Lange gave critically lauded performances in &quot;Losing Isaiah&quot;, opposite Halle Berry, and &quot;Rob Roy&quot;, with Liam Neeson. The same year, she reprised her role as Blanche DuBois in a CBS television adaptation of &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;, opposite Alec Baldwin, Diane Lane, and John Goodman. She received glowing reviews for her performance, which earned her fourth Golden Globe Award and her first Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie.

In 1996, Lange made her London stage debut in another performance as Blanche DuBois, which received rave reviews. The next year, she starred opposite Michelle Pfeiffer in a film adaptation of Jane Smiley&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel &quot;A Thousand Acres&quot;. Lange received her ninth Golden Globe Award nomination and won the Venice Film Festival&#x27;s Schermi d&#x27;Amore award for her performance in the film. In 1998, she starred opposite Elisabeth Shue in a film adaptation of Balzac&#x27;s &quot;Cousin Bette&quot;, for which she received strong reviews. The same year, Lange starred opposite Gwyneth Paltrow in &quot;Hush&quot;, which generally received negative reviews, though Roger Ebert praised Lange&#x27;s performance, writing, &quot;The film&#x27;s most intriguing element is the performance by Jessica Lange, who by not going over the top provides Martha with a little pathos to leaven the psychopathology.&quot;

Lange received strong reviews for her performance in &quot;Titus&quot;, Julie Taymor&#x27;s 1999 adaptation of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot;, co-starring Anthony Hopkins and Alan Cumming. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; critic Lisa Schwarzbaum included Lange in a &quot;for your consideration&quot; article directed at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, writing, &quot;Jessica Lange already has two Oscars and six nominations to her credit, so her appearance near the words &#x27;Academy Awards&#x27; should never be a surprise. But everything about her daring performance in &quot;Titus&quot; as Tamora, the Queen of the Goths, is an astonishment. Donning breastplates, vowing vengeance, tearing into Shakespeare for the first time as if nothing could be more fun, Lange steals the showand when the star of the show is Anthony Hopkins, that&#x27;s grand theft.&quot;
Lange began the new millennium with a London stage production of Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;Long Day&#x27;s Journey into Night&quot;, playing the part of the morphine-addicted family matriarch Mary Tyrone, for which she became the first American actress to receive an Olivier Award nomination. She appeared mostly in supporting roles thereafter, most notably opposite Christina Ricci in the 2001 adaptation of Elizabeth Wurtzel&#x27;s best-selling memoir on depression, &quot;Prozac Nation&quot;. In 2003, Lange starred opposite Tom Wilkinson in HBO&#x27;s &quot;Normal&quot;, a film about a man who reveals to his wife his decision to have a sex change, for which she received nominations for the Emmy and Golden Globe Awards for Best Actress in a Miniseries or Movie. She followed this with performances in the Bob Dylan vehicle &quot;Masked and Anonymous&quot; (2003), Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Big Fish&quot; (2003), Jim Jarmusch&#x27;s &quot;Broken Flowers&quot; (2005) and Wim Wenders&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Come Knocking&quot; (2005), before starring in a Broadway revival of Tennessee Williams&#x27;s &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot; for which she received mixed reviews. She later starred with Tammy Blanchard in a remake of &quot;Sybil&quot; in 2007.

=== 2009–2015: Career resurgence === 
In 2009, Lange co-starred as Big Edie, opposite Drew Barrymore, in HBO&#x27;s &quot;Grey Gardens&quot;, directed by Michael Sucsy and based on the 1975 documentary of the same name. The film was a tremendous success, garnering 17 Primetime Emmy Award nominations and winning five. Lange won her first Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie after two previous nominations in the same category. She also received her 11th Golden Globe Award nomination and second Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for her performance, losing both awards to Barrymore.

In 2011, Lange joined the cast of FX&#x27;s horror anthology series &quot;American Horror Story&quot;. Series co-creators Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk originally wrote her part as a supporting character, but after Lange acquired the role, they expanded it. Murphy, a long-time admirer of Lange, said he chose her because he wanted to expose her work to a new generation of viewers. He also singled out her performance as Blanche DuBois on Broadway in 1992, which he saw twice, as his favorite performance, citing it as another motivating factor in hiring Lange. The show was a huge success not only for the network and creators but also for Lange, who experienced a resurgence in her popularity, receiving rave reviews and several awards for her controversial role. She was chosen by &quot;TV Guide&quot;, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, and &quot;MTV&quot; for giving one of the &quot;best performances of 2011&quot;. In addition, she won a second Primetime Emmy Award, a fifth Golden Globe Award, and her first Screen Actors Guild Award, after two previous nominations. She was also awarded a Special Achievement Satellite Award for Outstanding Performance in a Television Series by the International Press Academy and the Dorian Award for Best TV Performance of the Year by the &quot;Gay and Lesbian Entertainment Critics Association&quot; (GALECA). She was further nominated for the TCA Award for Individual Achievement in Drama, Critics&#x27; Choice Television Award, and Saturn Award.
In 2012, she had a supporting role in her &quot;Grey Gardens&quot; director Michael Suscy&#x27;s box-office hit &quot;The Vow&quot;, opposite Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams, but also returned to star as the lead in the second season of &quot;American Horror Story&quot;, titled &quot;American Horror Story: Asylum&quot;. Once again, she was chosen by &quot;TV Guide&quot; and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; for giving one of the &quot;best performances of 2012&quot;. She won a second Dorian Award for Best TV Performance of the Year by the GALECA, and received a fifth Emmy nomination, a thirteenth Golden Globe Award nomination, a fourth Screen Actors Guild Award nomination, a second Saturn Award nomination, and a second Critics&#x27; Choice Television Award nomination.

In 2013, the third season of &quot;American Horror Story&quot;, &quot;American Horror Story: Coven&quot;, garnered the series its highest ratings to that point, and has held the record for garnering the series its highest on-average ratings. Lange was joined by fellow film actors Kathy Bates and Angela Bassett. For her work on the show, Lange earned a third Primetime Emmy Award for Best Actress in a Movie or Miniseries, a third Dorian Award for Best TV Performance of the Year and her first Critic&#x27;s Choice Television Award for Best Actress in a Movie or Miniseries. She also received her fourteenth Golden Globe nomination, her fifth Screen Actors Guild Award nomination and her fifth Satellite Award nomination for her performance on the series. In addition, Lange replaced Glenn Close in a film adaptation of Émile Zola&#x27;s &quot;Thérèse Raquin&quot;, directed by Charlie Stratton and titled &quot;In Secret&quot;, co-starring Elizabeth Olsen, Tom Felton, Oscar Isaac, and Matt Lucas for which she received rave reviews.

Lange began 2014 by being honored with a nomination for a star on The Hollywood Walk of Fame, though she has yet to claim it. Lange was also recognized by &quot;Elle Magazine&quot; with the L&#x27;Oreal de Paris Legend Award presented to her by her friend Shirley MacLaine during &quot;The Women in Hollywood Awards&quot;, honoring women for their outstanding achievements in film, spanning all aspects of the motion picture industry, including acting, directing, and producing. She was next honored with and became the first female recipient of the Kirk Douglas Award for Excellence in Film, presented to her by the Santa Barbara International Film Festival.

Later in the year, Marc Jacobs chose Lange to be the new face of Marc Jacobs Beauty. In addition, Lange was featured in the brand&#x27;s summer and fall print ad campaign photographed by David Sims, and starred in a short campaign film directed by Jacobs. Previously, Jacobs dressed and interviewed Lange for &quot;Love&quot; magazine&#x27;s fifth-anniversary issue, and had her provide a spoken-word version of &quot;Happy Days Are Here Again&quot; as the soundtrack for his autumn/winter 2014 show. She next starred opposite Mark Wahlberg in the remake of the 1970s action-thriller, &quot;The Gambler&quot;, receiving rave reviews for her work. She also led the fourth season of &quot;American Horror Story&quot;, titled &quot;American Horror Story: Freak Show&quot;. The series, once again, topped its and the network&#x27;s highest ratings, breaking all ratings records for both. Though self-admittedly not a singer, Lange&#x27;s covers of David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Life on Mars&quot; and Lana Del Rey&#x27;s &quot;Gods and Monsters&quot; for the show were both hugely popular, receiving heavy circulation on YouTube and charting in the top 50 on the iTunes music charts. For her work on the show, Lange received her seventh Primetime Emmy Award nomination, her fifteenth Golden Globe nomination, and her fourth Critics&#x27; Choice Television Award nomination. In 2015, Lange announced that she would not return for the series&#x27; fifth season. She followed her final season on &quot;American Horror Story&quot; with a role opposite Shirley MacLaine and Demi Moore in the road-trip comedy, &quot;Wild Oats&quot;, which wrapped production at the end of 2014. It premiered on Lifetime on August 22, 2016, before receiving a limited theatrical release on September 16, 2016.

=== 2016–present: Return to Broadway ===
In 2016, Lange had a supporting role in Louis C.K.&#x27;s critically acclaimed and Peabody Award-winning web series &quot;Horace and Pete&quot;, which debuted on C.K.&#x27;s website on January 30, 2016. C.K. told Howard Stern that he had written the part for Lange and had asked her to be in the series at the Emmy Awards. The series also starred Steve Buscemi, Edie Falco, Alan Alda, and Laurie Metcalf. She next returned to Broadway alongside Michael Shannon, Gabriel Byrne and John Gallagher Jr. in a revival of &quot;Long Day&#x27;s Journey into Night&quot; at the American Airlines Theatre, produced by Ryan Murphy and the Roundabout Theatre Company. Theatre critic Ben Brantley of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote of her performance &quot;You can feel Ms. Lange giving her all to each of her big set pieces, but they often feel too exquisitely self-contained, like coloratura arias in an opera. Ms. Lange is often acting beautifully, but she is also often palpably acting. And her final soliloquy is stretched self-indulgently thin.&quot; At the 70th Tony Awards the show became the most Tony-nominated play of the season with Lange winning the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play. She also won the Drama Desk Award and Outer Critics Circle Award for Best Lead Actress with nominations for the Drama League Award for Distinguished Performance and a Time Out New York Award. She told filmmaker Michael Stever that Kim Stanley remained one of her truest inspirations.

On November 12, 2016, Lange was honored at the Camerimage Film Festival, where she was awarded the Krzysztof Kieślowski Award for Acting. Lange next starred in FX&#x27;s anthology series, &quot;Feud: Bette and Joan&quot; (2017), also serving as producer alongside Susan Sarandon, who also co-starred, and executive producers Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk. The first season revolved around the infamous rivalry between Hollywood legends Bette Davis (Sarandon) and Joan Crawford (Lange), which came to a head during the making of the classic film, &quot;Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?&quot; (1963). Alfred Molina, Stanley Tucci, Judy Davis and Catherine Zeta-Jones co-starred. Production began in the fall of 2016 and it was released on March 5, 2017. The series garnered Lange her eighth Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie, her sixteenth Golden Globe Award nomination, her sixth Screen Actors Guild Award nomination, her fourth Critics&#x27; Choice Television Award nomination and her second TCA Award nomination for Individual Achievement in Drama. Lange was also honored by the Trinity Repertory Company&#x27;s Pell Award for Lifetime Achievement in the Arts on May 23, 2017.

In 2018, Lange was honored with the Jason Robards Award for Excellence in Theater by the Roundabout Theater Company. In addition, she starred opposite Gwyneth Paltrow in the Netflix series &quot;The Politician&quot; and reprised her role as Constance Langdon in &quot;American Horror Story: Apocalypse&quot;, for which she earned a tenth Emmy nominationher first in the Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series categoryin 2019. Lange&#x27;s first film of the 2020s was Neil Jordan&#x27;s &quot;Marlowe&quot;, based on the novel &quot;The Black-Eyed Blonde: A Philip Marlowe Novel&quot; by John Banville and co-starring Liam Neeson and Diane Kruger. The film premiered at the San Sebastián International Film Festival on September 24, 2022. During a press conference at the festival, director Jordan noted, &quot;I was desperate to work with Jessica Lange. The thought of [her] playing a retired screen goddess was amazing. Thankfully she agreed to play the part.&quot; The film was released in theaters on December 2, 2022. On June 6, 2023, &quot;Jessica Lange: An Adventurer&#x27;s Heart&quot;, a biography by film scholar, historian, and journalist Anthony Uzarowski, was released. 

Lange returned to Broadway to originate the lead role in a Second Stage Theater presentation of Paula Vogel&#x27;s new play, &quot;Mother Play&quot;, which premiered at the Hayes Theater in April 2024. The production was directed by Tina Landau and co-starred Jim Parsons and Celia Keenan-Bolger. The story takes place in 1962 and centers on Phyllis (Lange), as she oversees her son (Parsons) and daughter&#x27;s (Keenan-Bolger) relocation to a new apartment, prompting all three to face and reflect on their shared and individual lives and relationships with one another. Alexis Soloski of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the role as a &quot;showcase for Lange&quot; adding, &quot;Another actress as Phyllis might have done more to communicate the small ravages of time, but Lange concentrates instead on her ageless ferocity and charm&quot;. Lange received a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play nomination for the role. 

Also in 2024, she starred in &quot;The Great Lillian Hall&quot;, a film directed by Michael Cristofer, written by Elisabeth Seldes Annacone, and co-starring Kathy Bates, Pierce Brosnon, and Lily Rabe. The film, which premiered on HBO on May 31, 2024, centers on Lillian Hall (Lange), a renowned Broadway actress who, while rehearsing for her next Broadway production, &quot;is forced to reckon with the past and the price she has paid for the choices she made in her life and her art.&quot; The film was initially set to star Meryl Streep, who backed out of the project for unspecified reasons. The project is loosely based on the acclaimed stage actress Marian Seldes who battled dementia in her later years. Lange earned her sixth Critics&#x27; Choice Television Award nomination.
She also acted in the FX on Hulu miniseries &quot;&quot; (2024) as Truman Capote&#x27;s deceased mother Lillie Mae Faulk who. The series showrunner Jon Rabin Baitz said that casting her was a direct homage to her role as the Angel of Death in the Bob Fosse film &quot;All That Jazz&quot; (1979). 

Lange will star in director Jonathan Kent&#x27;s film adaptation of Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;Long Day&#x27;s Journey into Night&quot;, edited for the screen by David Lindsay-Abaire and co-starring Ed Harris, Ben Foster, and Colin Morgan. In an interview published on November 2, 2022, Lange spoke of her &quot;bouts with depression&quot; and &quot;overwhelming sense of loneliness&quot; and referred to the aforementioned project, noting, &quot;I could be feeling that even more acutely right now because I&#x27;m starting to play [drug-addicted matriarch] Mary Tyrone again.&quot; Kent previously directed the 2016 Broadway stage production of O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s play, for which Lange garnered a Tony Award, among other accolades. Additionally, Kenwright produced the 2000 London stage production of O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s play, which earned Lange an Olivier Award nomination, and also produced London stage productions of Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; and &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot;, both starring Lange.

Additionally, Lange has three other filmed projects in development: a Marlene Dietrich biopic produced by Ryan Murphy for Netflix centered on Dietrich&#x27;s late-career period in Las Vegas, Gia Coppola&#x27;s adaptation of Jean Nathan&#x27;s memoir &quot;The Search for Dare Wright: The Secret Life of the Lonely Doll&quot; co-starring Naomi Watts which chronicles the life of Dare Wright and her tempestuous relationship with her mother Edith Stevenson Wright, and a film adaptation of &quot;The Year of Magical Thinking&quot; to be filmed in 2025 where she would portray Joan Didion alongside Gary Oldman.

==Style and reception==
Lange is often included in the milieu of America&#x27;s finest and most respected actresses.

In a career spanning nearly five decades, Lange has come to be associated with playing intelligent women who often have a troubled internal life. She has been credited for her ability to deliver emotional intensity without resorting to excessive melodrama. Critics have frequently pointed out her tendency to play women on the edge of a nervous breakdown, a notion that Lange herself has also acknowledged. Nicholas Bell of &quot;Ioncinema&quot; writes that her Oscar-winning role of Carly in &quot;&quot; is reminiscent of her signature performances, as &quot;Lange excels [here] at the small tics hinting at the madness always lurking below the surface&quot;.

Regarding to her acting style, Lange has said that she performs on &quot;pure emotion&quot; rather than relying on a specific technique. Director Glenn Jordan, who has directed her in &quot;&quot;, noted that &quot;Jessica reminds me of what someone once said of Jack Lemmon. Whatever emotion or whatever small nuance you want, she is like a supermarket. Her shelves are stocked full and it&#x27;s all accessible to her&quot;. This sentiment was echoed by actress Sarah Paulson who, after working with Lange on the 2005 stage production of &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot; as well as five seasons of &quot;American Horror Story&quot;, described the actress as being &quot;like a cat on a wire&quot; and added that &quot;she is very instinctual, she doesn&#x27;t come up with an entire plan on how to play a scene&quot;. As a result, Lange&#x27;s performance style has positively been referred to as unpredictable, since she acts out the trajectory of her characters&#x27; emotional journey with unexpected turns.

==Personal life==
=== Marriage and relationships ===
Lange was married to photographer Francisco &quot;Paco&quot; Grande from 1970 to 1982. Though they separated not long after moving to Europe during the mid-1970s, they did not divorce until the early 1980s, after which Lange paid him an undisclosed sum in alimony. According to biographer Anthony Uzarowski, the former couple “remain close friends.”

From 1976 to 1982, she was partnered with renowned Russian ballet dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov, with whom she had her first child, Aleksandra Lange &quot;Shura&quot; Baryshnikov (born 1981). During that time, she was also sporadically linked with Bob Fosse, with whom she remained friends until his death.

In 1982, she met and entered a relationship with playwright Sam Shepard. They had two children: daughter Hannah Jane Shepard (born 1986) and son Samuel Walker Shepard (born 1987). They lived together in Virginia, New Mexico, Minnesota, and eventually New York City, before separating in 2009.

Lange often returns to Duluth, Minnesota, and has said of the city, &quot;It&#x27;s the one place that has remained constant in my life... After living all over [the world] and traveling everywhere I&#x27;ve wanted to go, I keep coming back here.&quot;

===Activism and beliefs===
Lange is a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Children&#x27;s Fund (UNICEF), specializing in the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in spreading awareness of the disease in Russia. Lange fostered a Romanian child with disabilities during the early 1990s.

Though she does not follow any set religion, she periodically practices Buddhism. She once admitted, &quot;It&#x27;s been a discipline that makes sense more than anything because it&#x27;s like a science. I&#x27;ve never been a religious person. I&#x27;ve always looked for some kind of spiritual meaning. I didn&#x27;t grow up going to church. My mother&#x27;s family were atheists and my father&#x27;s side was confused.&quot; She is also a vegetarian. Lange has joined the opposition to Minnesota&#x27;s wolf hunt. &quot;More than anything else, the cruel methods allowed for hunting and trapping wolves are deeply disturbing,&quot; the Cloquet native wrote in a letter to Governor Mark Dayton.

=== Health issues === 
Lange has also revealed that she suffers from severe bouts of depression, once admitting, &quot;I have never been a believer in psychoanalysis or therapy or anything like that. I&#x27;ve never done that.&quot; She confessed, &quot;Though my dark side is dormant right now, it continues to play a big role in whatever capacity I have to be creative. That&#x27;s the well I&#x27;m able to tap into, where all the anguish, rage and sadness are stored.&quot; In 2022, Lange shed more light on her dark moods, admitting, &quot;I&#x27;ve suffered bouts of depression my whole life. They ebb and flow. I have a hard time separating the sadness, [and] the depression, from my overwhelming sense of loneliness.&quot;

===Photography===
In 2008, Lange published a collection of her black-and-white photographs, &quot;50 Photographs&quot; (powerHouse Books), with an introduction by Patti Smith. In 2009, an exhibition of her work, along with a series of her films, was presented at the George Eastman House, the oldest international museum of photography and film, which honors distinguished contributions to film with the George Eastman Award. Lange received the first George Eastman Honors Award, an award given to an artist whose life work embodies the traditions and values championed by George Eastman House International Museum of Photography and Film. In 2010, she published a second collection of photographs, &quot;In Mexico&quot;. In 2013, she released a children&#x27;s book of photography, &quot;It&#x27;s About a Little Bird&quot;. In 2014, she exhibited at Moscow&#x27;s Multimedia Art Museum. In 2019, she published her fourth book of photography, &quot;Highway 61&quot;, composed of photographs of U.S. Route 61.

Lange&#x27;s fifth book of photography &quot;Dérive&quot; will be published by powerHouse Books and distributed by Simon &amp; Schuster on October 11, 2022.

<text>Northern Dancer (May 27, 1961 – November 16, 1990) was a Thoroughbred that, in 1964, became the first Canadian-bred horse to win the Kentucky Derby. After being retired from racing, he became one of the most successful sires of the 20th century. He is considered a Canadian icon and was inducted into the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame in 1965. Induction into the Racing Hall of Fame in both Canada and the United States followed in 1976. As a competitor, &quot;The Blood-Horse&quot; ranked him as one of the top 100 U.S. Thoroughbred racehorses of the 20th century. As a sire of sires, his influence on the breed is still felt worldwide.

At age two, Northern Dancer was named the Canadian Champion Two-Year-Old Colt after winning both the Summer Stakes and Coronation Futurity in Canada, plus the Remsen Stakes in New York. At three, he became a leading contender for the Kentucky Derby with wins in the Flamingo Stakes, Florida Derby, and Blue Grass Stakes. Northern Dancer followed up a record-setting victory in the Kentucky Derby by winning the Preakness Stakes. With a chance at the American Triple Crown, he finished third in the Belmont Stakes. Returning to Canada for a hero&#x27;s welcome, he won the Queen&#x27;s Plate in what proved to be his last race.

Northern Dancer was retired to stud in 1965 at Windfields Farm in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada. He was an immediate success when his first crop reached racing age in 1968. The success of his second crop, led by English Triple Crown winner Nijinsky, gave him international renown. Northern Dancer was relocated to the Maryland branch of Windfields Farm, where he became the most sought sire of his time.

==Background==
Northern Dancer was a bay stallion with a crooked white blaze and three white socks. He was bred in Oshawa, Ontario, by Canadian business magnate Edward P. Taylor, owner of Windfields Farm. He was from the first crop of Nearctic and was the first foal out of the mare Natalma, whose sire was Native Dancer.

All Thoroughbreds in the Northern Hemisphere have an official birth date of January 1 but Northern Dancer was foaled late in the season, on May 27, 1961. Younger than most of his age cohort, he was only high when Windfields Farm offered all of its yearlings for sale at its annual auction. Thus, despite a strong pedigree and good conformation, Northern Dancer did not find a buyer at his Can$25,000 reserve price. As a result, Northern Dancer stayed in the Windfields Farm racing stable.

At maturity, Northern Dancer had powerful hindquarters along with excellent balance and agility. His stallion listings showed his height as , but most horsemen who had met him estimated his adult height as between and . Shortly before the Kentucky Derby at age three, he weighed . Like his sire Nearctic and grandsire Nearco before him, Northern Dancer had a dominant and sometimes unruly temperament. &quot;He wasn&#x27;t mean, but he would wheel and do some tricks&quot;, said Joe Thomas, who later managed the horse&#x27;s stud career. Trainer Horatio Luro originally wanted to geld the colt, but Taylor refused.

Sportswriter Jim Murray of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Northern Dancer is the kind of colt who, if you saw him in your living room, you&#x27;d send for a trap and put cheese in it. He&#x27;s so little, a cat would chase him. But he&#x27;s so plucky there&#x27;s barely room in him for his heart. His legs are barely long enough to keep his tail off the ground. He probably takes a hundred more strides than anyone else, but he&#x27;s harder to pass than a third martini.&quot;

==Racing career==

===1963: Two-year-old season===
On August 2, 1963, Northern Dancer made his debut at Fort Erie Race Track in a maiden race for Canadian foaled two-year-olds over a distance of furlongs. He was ridden by apprentice jockey Ron Turcotte, who was instructed not to use the whip but gave the colt a tap at the sixteenth pole anyway, whereupon Northern Dancer &quot;exploded&quot;. He beat seven horses for a purse of $2,100. Turcotte later recalled, &quot;We won that race by eight lengths. He was a bold horse. Brave. He could handle anything. The grass. The mud. Anything.&quot;

Wearing blinkers for the first time, Northern Dancer made his next start on August 17 in the Vandal Stakes. Paul Bohenko was his jockey since Turcotte was committed to another horse, Ramblin&#x27; Man. Northern Dancer entered into a speed duel at the start of the race, setting up the race for Ramblin&#x27; Man to come from behind and win. After the race, Turcotte is quoted as having told Luro, &quot;the Dancer was definitely the best two year old in Canada, maybe in the world.&quot; He next entered the Summer Stakes on August 24, then at a distance of 1 mile on the turf at Fort Erie. The track condition was described as &#x27;bog-like&#x27;, and Northern Dancer is said to have almost fallen. Despite struggling with the ground, he led from the start and hung on for the win.

After a brief layoff, Northern Dancer was entered in the mile Cup and Saucer Stakes on September 28 over the Woodbine turf course, where he was assigned the top weight of 124 pounds. Ron Turcotte was back as his jockey and took him to an early lead, but Northern Dancer tired and fell second to long-shot Grand Garcon by three-quarters of a length. Turcotte believed the horse had still not recovered from the effort in the Summer Stakes and was favouring his left foreleg. &quot;He kept wanting to bear left, and I couldn&#x27;t get him on his right lead at all.&quot;

On October 7, he returned in the Bloordale Purse at 1 mile and 70 yards where he was again the top weight at 122 pounds. His main rival Northern Flight carried 117 pounds while other horses carried as little as 112 pounds. Northern Dancer broke well but allowed Northern Flight to take a commanding lead. At the halfway mark, Northern Dancer was third on the rail, 15 lengths back, but gradually closed the gap on the far turn. Down the stretch, the two battled for the lead before Northern Dancer pulled away to win by lengths, with the rest of the field some twenty-five plus lengths behind Northern Flight. Five days later, Northern Dancer faced a field of 14 rivals in the Coronation Futurity Stakes, the richest race for Canadian two-year-olds. He settled in fourth at the start, then took over the lead at the halfway point, drawing away to win by lengths. It was Turcotte&#x27;s last ride on Northern Dancer, as Luro feared he could not maintain sufficient control of the headstrong colt. &quot;God knows how good [Northern Dancer] really was,&quot; recalled Turcotte, &quot;for he was never a completely sound horse most of the time I rode him, and I still could not slow him down more than that.&quot;

On November 6, Northern Dancer followed up with a win in the seven-furlong Carleton Stakes at Greenwood on a muddy track. He won by lengths, but the &quot;Daily Racing Form&quot; called him an &quot;unwilling winner&quot;, reflecting heavy pressure from new jockey Jimmy Fitzsimmons, who used the whip throughout the stretch drive. Northern Dancer came back to the barn bleeding from the beginning of a quarter crack. It was thought that the injury was a result of his heavy race schedule – seven races in three months. Nonetheless, the colt was shipped to Aqueduct Racetrack in New York to compete against American horses. On November 18, he was entered in the Sir Gaylord Purse. He was ridden by Manuel Ycaza, and won by eight lengths over Bupers, who had won the Belmont Futurity. However, the quarter crack became more pronounced, so he was fitted with a bar shoe on his left front hoof to stabilize the foot.

On November 27, Northern Dancer was the odds-on favourite in a field of six horses entered in the Remsen Stakes, despite carrying top weight of 124 pounds. Ycaza sent him to the lead early and he won by two lengths in wire-to-wire fashion. His time of 1:35 for one mile was a new stakes record. Ycaza later recalled him as an &quot;ideal horse for any kind of situation. He would do anything you asked.&quot;

His record of seven wins from nine starts earned Northern Dancer the Canadian Juvenile Championship. He was rated at 126 pounds in the Canadian Free Handicap for two-year-olds, five pounds above Ramblin Road. In the American Experimental Free Handicap, he was rated at 123 pounds – three pounds below champion Raise a Native.

===1964: Three-year-old season===
After the Remsen, Luro gave Northern Dancer some time off to heal and had a vulcanized rubber patch applied to the quarter crack. Northern Dancer recovered quickly and reentered training in January. His first race at three was on February 10, 1964, in a six-furlong prep at Hialeah Park under a new jockey, Bobby Ussery, who was instructed to take it easy and not use the whip. Northern Dancer was bumped at the start and fell to the back of the pack. He recovered and steadily advanced up the rail, only to become trapped behind several horses. He was bumped again and eventually finished third behind Chieftain. Despite the instructions of Luro, Ussury had taken to his whip in the final strides of the race, which led the trainer to publicly criticize the rider. &quot;I believe in being very patient with my horses,&quot; said Luro. &quot;I don&#x27;t want punishment – under no circumstances.&quot;

On February 24, Northern Dancer and Chieftain again faced each other in a public workout over seven furlongs at Hialeah. Northern Dancer broke slowly but soon took the lead and won by seven lengths in a time of 1:23. He continued to gallop out past the wire, completing one mile in 1:36 and nine furlongs in 1:50. For his next start in the Flamingo Stakes on March 3, Northern Dancer was ridden by Hall of Fame jockey Bill Shoemaker and went off as the even-money favourite in a field of eleven. He settled into second and moved to the lead in the stretch after some gentle urging by Shoemaker, winning by two lengths over Mr. Brick, with Quadrangle a further eight lengths back in third. His time of 1:47 was the second fastest in the history of the race, behind only Bold Ruler&#x27;s time of 1:47 flat. Shoemaker was pleased with the performance. &quot;My little horse got a little leg weary in the last sixteenth of a mile,&quot; he said, &quot;but that was natural. He wasn&#x27;t quite so seasoned as some of the other horses.&quot;

He then entered a seven-furlong allowance race at Gulfstream Park on March 28 as a prep for the Florida Derby. Shoemaker was unable to ride due to a previous commitment, so Ycaza got the ride. Northern Dancer won easily by four lengths, equaling the track record of 1:22. In the Florida Derby on April 4, Northern Dancer was the 3–10 favourite in a field of eight. With Shoemaker back up, Northern Dancer raced in mid-pack behind a slow pace, then started to make up ground on the rail. Shoemaker waited until the half mile pole then urged the colt on without using the whip. Northern Dancer quickly took the lead at the head of the stretch and then held off a challenge by The Scoundrel, eventually winning by a length. Shoemaker said later that the colt was improving. However, his time was a disappointing 1:50, the slowest Florida Derby since 1955. Joe Hirsch of the &quot;Daily Racing Form&quot; commented, &quot;It did not appear that Shoemaker had a lot of horse left at the wire.&quot; Luro was satisfied with the performance though, feeling that the slow time of the race was the result of a fast workout a few days earlier in which Northern Dancer had fought restraint by the exercise rider.

Shortly after the race, Luro asked Shoemaker to commit to riding Northern Dancer in the Kentucky Derby. But Shoemaker instead chose Hill Rise, who had won the San Felipe Stakes and the Santa Anita Derby in California. Shoemaker had never ridden Hill Rise but campaigned hard to get the mount, believing the colt represented his best chance for a Derby win. Ycaza was also unable to commit to Northern Dancer as another trainer had first call on his services. Ultimately, Luro settled on Bill Hartack, who had ridden Luro&#x27;s previous Kentucky Derby winner, Decidedly. &quot;I&#x27;m not upset about it at all,&quot; said Luro. &quot;I guess Shoemaker must not have been impressed with my horse&#x27;s race Saturday, but I believe it was far from his best effort.&quot;

With his new jockey, Northern Dancer was made the 1–5 favourite in a field of five in the Blue Grass Stakes at Keeneland on April 23. With Northern Dancer so heavily backed, only win betting was allowed. Northern Dancer rated in second behind a slow early pace until the head of the stretch when he coasted to the lead. Another horse, Allen Adair, made a run down the stretch so Hartack released his grip and Northern Dancer crossed the finish line in front by half a length. He completed the nine furlongs in a time of 1:49 and galloped out the Derby distance of ten furlongs in 2:03. Hartack was satisfied with the colt&#x27;s abilities. &quot;He is a small horse,&quot; said Hartack, &quot;but he has lots of brawn and lots of guts.&quot;

====Bidding for the Triple Crown====
For the 1964 Kentucky Derby, run at a distance of miles, Northern Dancer drew post position 7 in a field of 12. He was the second betting choice at odds of 7–2 behind Hill Rise at 7–5. In the high pressure environment leading up to the race, Luro kept the press away from the colt, even substituting a stable pony for Northern Dancer during photo sessions. Northern Dancer responded by training eagerly, with a final workout of 1:00 on April 20. On the day of the race, May 2, Northern Dancer was on edge. As the field reached the track, he &quot;bounced like a rubber ball&quot; and gave a huge buck when the band started to play &quot;My Old Kentucky Home&quot;. He settled during the warm up, only to balk when asked to enter the starting gate. After a few tense moments, Northern Dancer relaxed and loaded quietly. After the break, he settled into good position on the rail around the first turn behind the early pacemakers Mr. Brick and Royal. Down the backstretch, Hartack guided him through a narrow hole into the clear and started to make up ground on the leaders. He got the jump on Hill Rise, who became tangled up in traffic as the front-runners started to fade. With a quarter mile to go, Hartack urged his colt on; Northern Dancer responded by running the next furlong in a very fast 11 seconds. He had a lead of about two lengths, but Hill Rise had gotten in the clear and started to make up ground. Author Kevin Chong later wrote of Northern Dancer&#x27;s &quot;short, powerful legs making like a hummingbird&#x27;s wings&quot; as he ran down the stretch. Hill Rise closed with giant strides, but Northern Dancer prevailed by a neck in a new race record of two minutes flat that stood until Secretariat broke it in 1973. He became the first Canadian-bred horse to win the Kentucky Derby, making front-page headlines across Canada.

Hartack, known for a somewhat adversarial relationship with the press, was full of praise after the race. &quot;[Northern Dancer] is a game, hard trying little horse,&quot; he said. &quot;He was always in good position and he ran real strong on the turns. He really did some running from the quarter pole to the eighth pole, and he was running his gamest at the wire.&quot; With the Preakness Stakes being run just two weeks later, Luro was concerned that Northern Dancer would find the race more demanding, especially because the track at Pimlico was deep and taxing. Accordingly, he used long gallops of between two and three miles to build up stamina. Then on the Friday before the race, he &quot;blew out&quot; Northern Dancer with a 3-furlong workout in a brisk :35 to sharpen his speed.

For the Preakness on May 16, Northern Dancer went off as the 2–1 second favourite to Hill Rise in a field of six that included the top five finishers from the Derby plus Quadrangle. Northern Dancer settled into third place with Hill Rise tracking just behind. Quadrangle moved to the lead down the backstretch and Northern Dancer started to make his move around the far turn. Hartack had yet to ask Northern Dancer for his run, while the jockeys of both Hill Rise and Quadrangle were working hard to maintain their position. Turning into the stretch, Hartack hit Northern Dancer once and he surged to a commanding lead. Near the finish line, Northern Dancer started to tire but Hartack was not overly worried. &quot;If he was tired, the horses behind us would be even more tired,&quot; he explained. Northern Dancer won by two and a half lengths. Hill Rise finished third, caught at the wire by The Scoundrel who claimed second.

Northern Dancer celebrated his actual third birthday on May 27 and was presented with a cake of carrots adorned by Canadian flags. He also received hundreds of cards wishing him success in the upcoming Belmont Stakes. Taylor felt that the horse would not mind the distance of 12 furlongs, believing that Hartack would be able to judge the pace and conserve energy. Luro was more worried, believing that Northern Dancer&#x27;s best distance was between eight and nine furlongs, but hoped the horse&#x27;s class would be enough to carry him the extra distance.

With a Triple Crown at stake, a then-record crowd of 61,215 showed up for the Belmont Stakes on June 6, run that year at Aqueduct due to renovations at Belmont Park. Northern Dancer went off as the 4–5 favourite in a field of eight, with Hill Rise the second choice at 2–1 and Quadrangle at 13–2. With Northern Dancer under a tight hold, he and Hill Rise tracked each other for the first mile behind a slow pace set by outsider Orientalist. Quadrangle was in second, relaxed and saving ground with excellent position on the rail. After a mile in 1:39, Quadrangle&#x27;s jockey, Manuel Ycaza, made his move, confident his horse had enough stamina to outlast the others. Hartack on Northern Dancer and Shoemaker on Hill Rise appeared to underestimate Quadrangle and did not at first respond, allowing Quadrangle to build a substantial lead into the stretch. When finally asked to run, Northern Dancer closed the gap to within half a length in midstretch. However, he then tired and was passed by Roman Brother to finish third, some six lengths behind the winner. Bill Shoemaker on Hill Rise, who finished fourth, lodged an objection against Hartack for being squeezed off on the final turn but the stewards disallowed the claim. The time of 2:28 was just two-fifths of a second off the track record. Hartack said he had been worried about several horses, including Quadrangle, before the race and felt the distance was the decisive factor. Asked if he felt disappointed by the result, he replied, &quot;How can it be a disappointment when a horse runs his heart out for you? He certainly didn&#x27;t disgrace himself – not to me, anyway.&quot;

====Return to Canada====
In spite of the loss in the Belmont, the mayor of Toronto declared June 8, 1964, to be &quot;Northern Dancer Day&quot;, which included a ceremony held at city hall. (The idea of a ticker-tape parade down Bay Street was nixed due to the colt&#x27;s high-strung temperament.) E. P. Taylor was presented with a key to the city—carved out of a carrot. Taylor presented the key to Northern Dancer when the horse arrived at Woodbine a few days later; the colt promptly ate it.

On June 25, Northern Dancer was the heavy betting favourite in the Queen&#x27;s Plate at odds of 1–7 in a field of eight. He raced from well off the pace, trailing the field around the first turn and still in sixth down the backstretch. Hartack relaxed his hold entering the far turn, and Northern Dancer &quot;zoomed&quot; past the early leaders, then drew off to win by lengths. Hartack never needed the whip. Northern Dancer completed the race in 2:02, which, although more than two seconds off his time in the Kentucky Derby, was just one-fifth of a second off the race record set by Victoria Park in 1960. &quot;My main concern was with the first turn,&quot; said Luro after the race. &quot;You see, we were in the No. 1 post position, and it could have been tough to get around other horses at the turn.&quot; Accordingly, Hartack had restrained Northern Dancer at the start to avoid traffic problems. However, the colt&#x27;s poor position made Hartack move sooner than he would have preferred. Despite the easy win, Hartack felt the colt had been somewhat &quot;dull&quot;, and possibly unsound.

Northern Dancer remains the only Kentucky Derby winner to also take the Queen&#x27;s Plate.

====Aftermath====
Northern Dancer pulled up lame after a workout at Belmont in July. According to Luro, Northern Dancer had run with a splint on the inside of his left front leg since age two but had never before shown visible evidence of injury. The earlier symptoms of lameness noticed by Turcotte and Hartack had only manifested at full racing speed. Assistant trainer Norman Bowles later said the horse &quot;would probably run through anything – he was a tough little man – and you never can tell when one of those things may start stinging. This time, he had developed a bowed tendon. It did not respond to treatment, and this ended his racing career.

Northern Dancer was named the Champion Three-Year-Old Colt of 1964 in the United States. He was also named the three-year-old champion in Canada and Canadian Horse of the Year. In addition, he was named Canadian Athlete of the Year. He was the high weight at 128 pounds on the &quot;Daily Racing Form&quot;&#x27;s American Free Handicap for three-year-olds, one pound above both Roman Brother and Quadrangle. He was also the high weight at 132 pounds on the Canadian Free Handicap, 12 pounds more than Langcrest.

In his two-year racing career, Northern Dancer won 14 of his 18 starts and never finished worse than third. His earnings totaled $580,000, then a record for a Canadian-bred horse. In &quot;The Blood-Horse&quot; listing of the top 100 American Thoroughbred racehorses of the 20th century, he was ranked number 43.

An asterisk after the odds means Northern Dancer was the post-time favourite.
==Breeding career==
Northern Dancer retired to stud in 1965 at Taylor&#x27;s Windfields Farm in Oshawa, Ontario, for an initial fee of $10,000. Due to his small size, a ramp was built in the breeding shed to allow Northern Dancer to service mares who were taller than him. He was bred to 35 mares, with 21 live foals being produced in 1966. The first crop reached racing age in 1968 and was an immediate success, including Viceregal, who was named Canadian Horse of the Year. Nine others also became stakes winners, an &quot;astounding&quot; 47.6% of the crop. &quot;His first foals ran so well,&quot; said Ed Bowen, former editor of &quot;The Blood-Horse&quot;. &quot;Northern Dancer had that aura about him right away.&quot;

Although his second crop produced only four stakes winners, it played a crucial role in his developing reputation. His leading performer was Nijinsky, who was purchased by Irish trainer Vincent O&#x27;Brien at the Canadian yearling sale for $84,000. Nijinsky went on to win the 1970 English Triple Crown, the first horse to do so since 1935. Nijinsky was named Horse of the Year in England and Ireland. Meanwhile, Fanfreluche was named Canadian Horse of the Year and co-champion three year-old-filly in both Canada and the United States.

As the result of his success, Northern Dancer was relocated to the Maryland division of Windfields Farm in December 1968 and was syndicated in August 1970 for $2.4 million. Taylor retained several shares in the stallion, while other members included Claiborne Farm, Allaire du Pont, Greentree Stud, J. Louis Levesque, Paul Mellon, Spendthrift Farm, Tartan Farm and Alfred G. Vanderbilt. Each share in the syndicate provided an annual breeding right to Northern Dancer, and relatively few other breeding rights were publicly available. As a result of the scarcity of his services and his continued success, Northern Dancer&#x27;s stud fee rose, slowly at first: from $10,000 (live foal) in 1965, to $15,000 (live foal) in 1969, to $25,000 (live foal) in 1971 to $35,000 ($10,000 of which was non-refundable) in 1975 to $50,000 (no guarantee) in 1978. His published fee, with no guarantee that a live foal would result, then started a rapid increase: $100,000 in 1980, $150,000 in 1981, $250,000 in 1982, $300,000 in 1983 and $500,000 in 1984. For his final years at stud (1985–1987), his breeding rights were privately negotiated, with one season selling at auction for $1 million, an amount four to five times that of his closest rivals. By contrast, the highest North American stud fee in 2016 was $300,000 for Tapit.
Northern Dancer was one of the 20th century&#x27;s most successful Thoroughbred sires. From 645 named foals, he sired 411 winners (63.7%) and 147 stakes winners (22.8%). The 147 stakes winners was then a record. He was the 1971 leading sire in North America and also in 1977 when international earnings are included. His progeny were highly sought in Europe, and he became the leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland in 1970, 1978, 1983, and 1984. Most of his progeny resembled him in size and shape: Nijinsky, who stood over , proved the exception. They were also generally known for their balance and acceleration.

When Northern Dancer was 20 years old (an advanced age for a stallion), his owners turned down an offer of US$40 million from a European syndicate for him. Northern Dancer&#x27;s entry into stud service was ranked number 28 in &quot;Horse Racing&#x27;s Top 100 Moments&quot;, a 2006 review of American racing in the 20th century by &quot;The Blood-Horse&quot; magazine.

===Notable progeny===
Northern Dancer&#x27;s major stakes winners include:

&quot;c = colt, f = filly, g = gelding&quot;

===Sales records===
Former Keeneland chairman Ted Bassett wrote in his autobiography that between 1974 and 1988, the sons and daughters of Northern Dancer fetched the highest prices of all sires at the yearling sales 12 times, &quot;and that constitutes a record that may last forever.&quot; Northern Dancer&#x27;s yearlings also led the Keeneland July Selected Yearling Sale by average price 12 times in the same period. In 1984, 12 yearlings by Northern Dancer sold for an unrivaled sale-record average price of US$3,446,666 (about $ million adjusted for inflation). Combined over a period of 22 years, the top 174 Northern Dancer offspring at the Keeneland Sales sold for a total $160 million. The bidding duels between John Magnier and Robert Sangster of Coolmore Stud and Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum of Darley Stud helped drive up the prices as both sought future breeding prospects.

Three of the most expensive colts ever sold at public auction were sired by Northern Dancer: Snaafi Dancer, who became the first $10-million yearling when sold to Sheikh Mohammed for $10.2 million in 1983; a colt out of Ballade later named Imperial Falcon, who sold for $8.25 million to Sangster in 1984; and a colt out of Fabuleux Jane later named Jareer, who sold for $7.1 million to Darley Stud. Although none of these three colts was a major winner on the racetrack, the success of other high-priced yearlings like Shareef Dancer (auctioned for $3.3 million), Nureyev (auctioned for $1.3 million) and Lomond (privately sold for 1.5 million) kept demand high.

==End of life and burial==
Northern Dancer was retired from stud on April 15, 1987, having started to experience heart problems and arthritis. He was pensioned at Windfields Farm in Maryland and when the farm was subsequently sold, a special clause was written to guarantee his lifelong right to live there. On November 15, 1990, at the age of 29, he suffered a severe colic, possibly complicated by a strangulation of his small intestine. Due to his advanced age, it was felt that Northern Dancer would be unable to survive surgery so he was euthanized on November 16. He was loaded in a specially built oak coffin and then wrapped in a blanket he had won during his racing career. That same day, his remains were brought back to Canada in a refrigerated van for burial at Windfields Farm in Oshawa, Ontario.

Windfields Farm was subsequently sold to the University of Ontario Institute of Technology (now Ontario Tech University) and Durham College, and Northern Dancer&#x27;s burial site was not publicly accessible for many years, at one point becoming covered in weeds. On April 16, 2018, the grave became an official heritage site under the &quot;Ontario Heritage Act&quot;, with funds presented by the City of Oshawa to landscape the surrounding area.

==Legacy and honours==

In 1964, Northern Dancer was the American Champion Three-Year-Old Male Horse and the Canadian Horse of the Year. In 1965, he became the first horse voted into Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame. In 1976, Northern Dancer was an inaugural inductee to the new Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame and was also inducted into the United States Horse Racing Hall of Fame. In 1977, Northern Dancer won three world sires&#x27; premiership titles for the number of international stakes winners, international stakes wins, and total stake earnings of his progeny.

Northern Dancer was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 1998. In 1999, Canada Post honoured the horse with his image placed on a postage stamp. A residential street was named after Northern Dancer on the former site of the Greenwood Race Track in east-end Toronto. Also, a life-sized bronze statue of the horse was placed outside Woodbine Racetrack.

Over the decades, a number of books have been written about Northern Dancer. In 1995, Muriel Lennox, who had worked for Taylor, published &quot;Northern Dancer: The Legend and His Legacy&quot;. In 2003, Avalyn Hunter&#x27;s book &quot;American Classic Pedigrees (1914–2002)&quot;, extensively covered the influence of Northern Dancer on North America classic winners around the end of the 20th century. Her later book, &quot;The Kingmaker: How Northern Dancer Founded a Racing Dynasty&quot; covers Northern Dancer&#x27;s international legacy. In 2015, Kevin Chong wrote &quot;Northern Dancer: The Legendary Horse That Inspired A Nation&quot;.

In 2011, the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame held an induction ceremony that included a 50th-anniversary tribute for Northern Dancer. Saxophone instrumentalist Matthew James performed his tribute song, entitled &quot;Northern Dancer&quot;. In 2012, Breyer Animal Creations released a portrait model of Northern Dancer sculpted by Jeanne Mellin Herrick. In 2014, the Canadian Film Centre unveiled the Northern Dancer Pavilion on its Windfields Farms heritage campus. In 2018, the city of Oshawa announced that a new elementary school, located near what used to be Windfields Farm at the corner of Northern Dancer Drive and Bridle Road, would be named after the horse. Northern Dancer&#x27;s Kentucky Derby trophy is on permanent exhibit at the Canadian Museum of History in Gatineau, Québec.

===Sire of sires===

In 1990, &quot;The New York Times&quot; called Northern Dancer &quot;the dominant progenitor of his breed&quot; because his own success at stud was amplified by the impact of his sons around the world. His leading sire sons included:
* Be My Guest – leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland (1982)
* Danzig – leading sire in North America (1991–1993). also a sire of sires, including Danehill, leading sire in both Europe and Australia and Green Desert, whose sire son&#x27;s include Invincible Spirit, Oasis Dream and Cape Cross
* Dixieland Band – sire of 117 stakes winners and damsire of two Kentucky Derby winners (Monarchos and Street Sense)

Northern Dancer&#x27;s impact continues well into the 21st century. In North America, 2018 Triple Crown winner Justify has multiple crosses to Northern Dancer, in the direct male line through Storm Cat, and also through Nijinsky and Vice Regent. American Pharoah, winner of the 2015 Triple Crown is 5 × 5 inbred to Northern Dancer, through Storm Bird and El Gran Senor. California Chrome, winner of the 2014 Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes, is inbred 4 × 5 to Northern Dancer on his dam&#x27;s side. Northern Dancer appears at least once in the pedigree of every contestant in the 2018 Kentucky Derby.

More Northern Dancer-descended horses are Breeders&#x27; Cup winners than from any other horse. According to pedigree consultant John Sparkman, 35 to 40 percent of American graded stakes winners of 2013 were male line descendants of Northern Dancer. In Europe and Australia, the percentage is well over 60 per cent.

In Europe, Northern Dancer&#x27;s bloodline is pervasive. Northern Dancer was a four-time Leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland, a feat achieved one time each by his sons Be My Guest and Nijinsky, 14 times by his son Sadler&#x27;s Wells, two times by his grandson Caerleon, three times by his grandson Danehill, and twelve times (as of 2021) by his grandson Galileo – a total of 36 champion sire titles in just the direct Northern Dancer to grandson bloodline. Adding his great-grandsons Danehill Dancer, who was the leading sire in 2009, and Frankel (2021) the Northern Dancer sire line accounted for every champion sire title in Great Britain and Ireland from 1990 to 2021 inclusive.

He is the paternal grand-sire of a record 29 different English Classic winners — the next closest in this regard is St. Simon with 23. As for the Epsom Derby, a 2011 study showed that every winner since 1998 had Northern Dancer in his pedigree. The Northern Dancer sire line has accounted for 28 Derby winners . Galileo, High Chaparral, Motivator, New Approach, Sea the Stars, Camelot, Australia, and Golden Horn are included in this number.

===Inbreeding===
Because of the prevalence of Northern Dancer&#x27;s bloodline, a certain degree of inbreeding to him is becoming common. Whenever this happens, there is a concern that the inbreeding will weaken the breed, making horses more prone to injury and potentially leading to inbreeding depression. Statistical studies have shown that inbreeding has increased by a small but significant amount in the last 50 years, partly because of the larger number of foals that a successful stallion will now sire each year compared to in the past. For example, Northern Dancer sired 645 foals in 20 years at stud, whereas his grandson Danehill sired 2,499 foals in 14 years at stud.
Statistical analysis has shown that inbreeding to Northern Dancer is on average slightly &quot;less&quot; effective than when stallions of his line are bred to mares who do not have Northern Dancer in their pedigree (referred to as an outcross). However, many successful stallions are inbred, in part because this can make it easier to pass on dominant characteristics. Notable sires that are inbred to Northern Dancer (within four generations) include Oasis Dream, Rock of Gibraltar, Hernando, Spinning World, Redoute&#x27;s Choice, and Frankel.

Northern Dancer lines were originally outcrossed on descendants of Mr. Prospector or Nasrullah, but this became so common that it is increasingly difficult to find horses from these lines who do not also carry Northern Dancer breeding. Outcross bloodlines can still be found, most notably through Sunday Silence and the German-bred stallion Monsun.

In North America, Northern Dancer is farther back in the pedigree of most major sires, decreasing the risks associated with inbreeding. For example, Tapit, the leading sire in North America from 2014 to 2016, is inbred 3 × 5 to Nijinsky II (thus 4 × 6 to Northern Dancer). He has crossed well with mares from other Northern Dancer lines.

==Pedigree==
Northern Dancer was by Nearctic, who in turn was sired by Nearco, an Italian-bred horse who was undefeated in fourteen starts. Retired to stud in England, Nearco was considered a &quot;breed-shaping&quot; sire of sires. In 1952, Taylor attended the Newmarket December sale in England, where he purchased Lady Angela, a daughter of leading sire Hyperion. In 1953, Taylor had Lady Angela bred to Nearco before shipping her to Canada, where she foaled Nearctic in early 1954. Nearctic was Canadian Horse of the Year in 1958, a feat that Northern Dancer matched in 1964.

Northern Dancer&#x27;s broodmare sire (maternal grandsire) was Native Dancer, who also was an important sire of sires, chiefly through Raise A Native and Mr. Prospector. Northern Dancer was thus an immediate descendant of three of the most important bloodlines of the middle twentieth century (Nearco, Hyperion and Native Dancer).

His female family is equally distinguished, if not as well-known. Northern Dancer&#x27;s dam Natalma was a stakes-placed mare who was disqualified from a win in the Spinaway Stakes. She developed a knee chip in June 1960 and Taylor decided to breed her to Nearctic in his first year at stud rather than keep her in training. Northern Dancer, a late foal on May 27, 1961, was the result. Natalma established herself as a &quot;blue hen&quot;, producing not only Northern Dancer but three other stakes winners. Her daughters have further extended the family: Arctic Dancer, a full sister of Northern Dancer, became the dam of La Prevoyante, 1972 Canadian Horse of the Year; Spring Adieu became the second dam of leading international sire Danehill (who is inbred to Natalma as he is also a grandson of Northern Dancer); and Raise the Standard is the granddam of important European sire Machiavellian.

Natalma&#x27;s dam Almahmoud produced several other influential daughters including Cosmah, who produced four stakes winners including Tosmah (three-time American champion filly) and Halo, who would go on to sire Sunday Silence. Another daughter of Almahmoud, Bubbling Beauty, produced Arctic Tern, the French champion sire of 1986.

<text>David Ben-Gurion ( ; ; born David Grün; 16 October 1886 – 1 December 1973) was the primary national founder and first prime minister of the State of Israel. As head of the Jewish Agency from 1935, and later president of the Jewish Agency Executive, he was the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the Jewish community in Palestine, and largely led the movement for an independent Jewish state in Mandatory Palestine.

Born in Płońsk, then part of Congress Poland, to Polish Jewish parents, he immigrated to the Palestine region of the Ottoman Empire in 1906. Adopting the name of Ben-Gurion in 1909, he rose to become the preeminent leader of the Jewish community in British-ruled Mandatory Palestine from 1935 until the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, which he led until 1963 with a short break in 1954–55. Ben-Gurion&#x27;s interest for Zionism developed early in his life, leading him to become a major Zionist leader, and the executive head of the World Zionist Organization in 1946. 

On 14 May 1948, he formally proclaimed the establishment of Israel, and was the first to sign the Israeli Declaration of Independence, which he had helped to write. Under Ben-Gurion&#x27;s leadership, the 1948 Arab–Israeli War saw the uniting of the various Jewish militias into the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), and the expulsion and flight of a majority of the Palestinian Arab population. Subsequently, he became known as &quot;Israel&#x27;s founding father&quot;. Following the war, Ben-Gurion served as Israel&#x27;s first prime minister and minister of defence. As prime minister, he helped build state institutions, presiding over national projects aimed at the development of the country. He also oversaw the absorption of Jewish immigrants. A major part of his foreign policy was improving relations with West Germany through a reparations agreement in compensation for Nazi confiscation of Jewish property during the Holocaust.

In 1954, he resigned as prime minister and minister of defence but remained a member of the Knesset. He returned as minister of defence in 1955 after the Lavon Affair and the resignation of Pinhas Lavon. Later that year he became prime minister again, following the 1955 elections. He backed Israel&#x27;s reprisal operations to Arab guerrilla attacks and its invasion of Egypt, along with Britain and France, during the Suez Crisis in 1956. He stepped down from office in 1963, and retired from political life in 1970. He then moved to his modest &quot;hut&quot; in Sde Boker, a kibbutz in the Negev desert, where he lived until his death. Posthumously, Ben-Gurion was named one of &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s 100 Most Important People of the 20th century.

== Early life ==


=== Childhood and education ===
David Ben-Gurion was born in Płońsk in Congress Polandthen part of the Russian Empire, to Polish Jewish parents. His father, Avigdor Grün, was a &quot;pokątny doradca&quot; (secret adviser), navigating his clients through the often corrupt Imperial legal system. Following the publication of Theodore Herzl&#x27;s &quot;Der Judenstaat&quot; in 1896 Avigdor co-founded a Zionist group called &quot;Beni Zion&quot;Children of Zion. In 1900 it had a membership of 200. David was the youngest of three boys with an older and younger sister. His mother, Scheindel (Broitman), died of sepsis following a stillbirth in 1897. It was her eleventh pregnancy. Two years later his father remarried. Ben-Gurion&#x27;s birth certificate, found in Poland in 2003, indicated that he had a twin brother who died shortly after birth. Between the ages of five and 13 Ben-Gurion attended five different heders as well as compulsory Russian classes. Two of the heders were &#x27;modern&#x27; and taught in Hebrew rather than Yiddish. His father could not afford to enrol Ben-Gurion in Płońsk&#x27;s beth midrash so Ben-Gurion&#x27;s formal education ended after his bar mitzvah. At the age of 14 he and two friends formed a youth club, &quot;Ezra&quot;, promoting Hebrew studies and emigration to the Holy Land. The group ran Hebrew classes for local youth and in 1903 collected funds for the victims of the Kishinev pogrom. One biographer writes that &quot;Ezra&quot; had 150 members within a year. A different source estimates the group never had more than &quot;several dozen&quot; members.

In 1904 Ben-Gurion moved to Warsaw where he hoped to enrol in the Warsaw Mechanical-Technical School founded by Hipolit Wawelberg. He did not have sufficient qualifications to matriculate and took work teaching Hebrew in a Warsaw heder. Inspired by Tolstoy he had become a vegetarian. He became involved in Zionist politics and in October 1905 he joined the clandestine Social-Democratic Jewish Workers&#x27; Party&quot;Poalei Zion&quot;. Two months later he was the delegate from Płońsk at a local conference. While in Warsaw the Russian Revolution of 1905 broke out and he was in the city during the clampdown that followed; he was arrested twice, the second time he was held for two weeks and only released with the help of his father. In December 1905 he returned to Płońsk as a full-time Poalei Zion operative. There he worked to oppose the anti-Zionist Bund who were trying to establish a base. He also organised a strike over working conditions amongst garment workers. He was known to use intimidatory tactics, such as extorting money from wealthy Jews at gunpoint to raise funds for Jewish workers.

Ben-Gurion discussed his hometown in his memoirs, saying:

For many of us, anti-Semitic feeling had little to do with our dedication [to Zionism]. I personally never suffered anti-Semitic persecution. Płońsk was remarkably free of it ... Nevertheless, and I think this very significant, it was Płońsk that sent the highest proportion of Jews to Eretz Israel from any town in Poland of comparable size. We emigrated not for negative reasons of escape but for the positive purpose of rebuilding a homeland ... Life in Płońsk was peaceful enough. There were three main communities: Russians, Jews and Poles. ... The number of Jews and Poles in the city were roughly equal, about five thousand each. The Jews, however, formed a compact, centralized group occupying the innermost districts whilst the Poles were more scattered, living in outlying areas and shading off into the peasantry. Consequently, when a gang of Jewish boys met a Polish gang the latter would almost inevitably represent a single suburb and thus be poorer in fighting potential than the Jews who even if their numbers were initially fewer could quickly call on reinforcements from the entire quarter. Far from being afraid of them, they were rather afraid of us. In general, however, relations were amicable, though distant.

In autumn of 1906 he left Poland to go to Palestine. He travelled with his sweetheart Rachel Nelkin and her mother, as well as Shlomo Zemach his comrade from &quot;Ezra&quot;. His voyage was funded by his father.

=== Ottoman Empire and Constantinople ===
Immediately on landing in Jaffa, 7 September 1906, Ben-Gurion set off, on foot, in a group of 14, to Petah Tikva. It was the largest of the 13 Jewish agricultural settlements and consisted of 80 households with a population of nearly 1,500; of these around 200 were Second Aliyah pioneers like Ben-Gurion. He found work as a day labourer, waiting each morning hoping to be chosen by an overseer. Jewish workers found it difficult competing with local villagers who were more skilled and prepared to work for less. Ben-Gurion was shocked at the number of Arabs employed. In November he caught malaria and the doctor advised he return to Europe. By the time he left Petah Tikva in summer of 1907 he had worked an average 10 days a month which frequently left him with no money for food. He wrote long letters in Hebrew to his father and friends. They rarely revealed how difficult life was. Others who had come from Płońsk were writing about tuberculosis, cholera and people dying of hunger.

On his disembarkation at Jaffa, Ben-Gurion had been spotted by Israel Shochat who had arrived two years previously and had established a group of around 25 Poale Zion followers. Shochat made a point of inspecting new arrivals looking for recruits. A month after his arrival at Petah Tikva, Shochat invited Ben-Gurion to attend the founding conference of the Jewish Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party in the Land of Israel in Jaffa. The conference, 4–6 October 1906, was attended by 60 or so people. Shochat engineered the elections so that Ben-Gurion was elected onto the five-man Central Committee and the 10-man Manifesto Committee. He also arranged that Ben-Gurion was chosen as chairman of the sessions. These Ben-Gurion conducted in Hebrew, forbidding the translation of his address into Russian or Yiddish. The conference was divided: a large faction&quot;Rostovians&quot;wanted to create a single Arab–Jewish proletariat. This Shochat and Ben-Gurion opposed. The conference delegated the Manifesto Committee the task of deciding the new party&#x27;s objectives. They produced &quot;The Ramleh Programme&quot; which was approved by a second smaller 15-man conference held in Jaffa the following January 1907. The programme stated &quot;the party aspires to political independence of the Jewish People in this country.&quot; All activities were to be conducted in Hebrew; there should be segregation of the Jewish and the Arab economies; and a Jewish trade union was to be established. Three members of the Central Committee resigned and Ben-Gurion and Shochat continued meeting weekly in Jaffa or Ben Shemen where Shochat was working. Ben-Gurion walked to the meetings from Petah Tikva until he moved to Jaffa where he gave occasional Hebrew lessons. His political activity resulted in the establishment of three small trade unions amongst some tailors, carpenters and shoemakers. He set up the &quot;Jaffa Professional Trade Union Alliance&quot; with 75 members. He and Shochat also brokered a settlement to a strike at the Rishon Le Zion winery where six workers had been sacked. After three months the two-man Central Committee was dissolved, partly because, at that time, Ben-Gurion was less militant than Shochat and the Rostovians. Ben-Gurion returned to Petah Tikva.

During this time Ben-Gurion sent a letter to &quot;Yiddish Kemfer&quot; (&quot;&quot;The Jewish Fighter&quot;), a Yiddish newspaper in New York City. It was an appeal for funds and was the first time something written by Ben-Gurion was published.

The arrival of Yitzhak Ben-Zvi in April 1907 revitalised the local Poale Zion. Eighty followers attended a conference in May at which Ben-Zvi was elected onto a two-man Central Committee and all Ben-Gurion&#x27;s policies were reversed: Yiddish, not Hebrew, was the language to be used; the future lay with a united Jewish and Arab proletariat. Further disappointment came when Ben-Zvi and Shochat were elected as representatives to go to the World Zionist Congress. Ben-Gurion came last of five candidates. He was not aware that at the next gathering, on Ben-Zvi&#x27;s return, a secret para-military group was set upBar-Gioraunder Shochat&#x27;s leadership. Distancing himself from Poale Zion activism Ben-Gurion, who had been a day-labourer at Kfar Saba, moved to Rishon Lezion where he remained for two months. He made detailed plans with which he tried to entice his father to come and be a farmer.

In October 1907, on Shlomo Zemach&#x27;s suggestion, Ben-Gurion moved to Sejera. An agricultural training farm had been established at Sejera in the 1880s and since then a number of family-owned farms, moshavah, had been established forming a community of around 200 Jews. It was one of the most remote colonies in the foothills of north-eastern Galilee. It took the two young men three days to walk there. Coincidentally at the same time Bar Giora, now with about 20 members and calling themselves &#x27;the collective&#x27; but still led by Shochat, took on the operating of the training farm. Ben-Gurion found work in the farm but, excluded from &#x27;the collective&#x27;, he later became a labourer for one of the moshav families. One of the first acts of &#x27;the collective&#x27; was organising sacking of the farm&#x27;s Circassian nightwatchman. As a result, shots were fired at the farms every night for several months. Guns were brought and the workforce armed. Ben-Gurion took turns patrolling the farm at night.

In the autumn of 1908 Ben-Gurion returned to Płońsk to be conscripted into the army and avoid his father facing a heavy fine. He immediately deserted and returned to Sejera, travelling, via Germany, with forged papers.

On 12 April 1909 two Jews from Sejera were killed in clashes with local Arabs following the death of a villager from Kfar Kanna, shot in an attempted robbery. There is little conformation of Ben-Gurion&#x27;s accounts of his part in this event.

Later that summer, Ben-Gurion moved to Zichron Yaakov. From where the following spring he was invited, by Ben-Zvi, to join the staff of Poale Zion&#x27;s new Hebrew periodical, Ha&#x27;ahdut (The Unity), which was being established in Jerusalem. They needed his fluency in Hebrew for translating and proof reading. It was the end of his career as a farm labourer. The first three editions came out monthly with an initial run of 1000 copies. It then became a weekly with a print run of 450 copies. He contributed 15 articles over the first year, using various pen names, eventually settling for Ben Gurion. The adopting of Hebrew names was common amongst those who remained during the Second Aliyah. He chose Ben-Gurion after the historic Joseph ben Gurion.

In the spring of 1911, faced with the collapse of the Second Aliyah, Poale Zion&#x27;s leadership decided the future lay in &quot;Ottomanisation&quot;. Ben-Zvi, Manya and Israel Shochat announced their intention to move to Istanbul. Ben-Zvi and Shochat planned to study law; Ben-Gurion was to join them but first needed to learn Turkish, spending eight months in Salonika, at that time the most advanced Jewish community in the area. Whilst studying he had to conceal that he was Ashkenazi due to local Sephardic prejudices. Ben-Zvi obtained a forged secondary school certificate so Ben-Gurion could join him in Dar al-Funun. Ben-Gurion was entirely dependent on funding from his father, while Ben-Zvi found work teaching. Struggling with ill health, Ben-Gurion spent some time in hospital.

=== Ben-Gurion in America, 1915–1918 ===
Ben-Gurion was at sea, returning from Istanbul, when the First World War broke out. He was not amongst the thousands of foreign nationals deported in December 1914. Based in Jerusalem, he and Ben-Zvi recruited forty Jews into a Jewish militia to assist the Ottoman Army. Despite his pro-Ottoman declarations he was deported to Egypt in March 1915. From there he made his way to the United States, arriving in May. For the next four months Ben-Gurion and Ben Zvi embarked on a speaking tour planned to visit Poale Zion groups in 35 cities in an attempt to raise a pioneer army, Hechalutz, of 10,000 men to fight on the Ottoman side. The tour was a disappointment. Audiences were small; Poale Zion had fewer than 3,000 members, mostly in the New York area. Ben-Gurion was hospitalised with diphtheria for two weeks and spoke on only five occasions and was poorly received. Ben-Zvi spoke to 14 groups as well as an event in New York City and succeeded in recruiting 44 volunteers for Hechalutz; Ben-Gurion recruited 19. Ben-Gurion embarked on a second tour in December, speaking at 19 meetings, mostly in small towns with larger events in Minneapolis and Galveston. Due to the lack of awareness of Poale Zion&#x27;s activities in Palestine it was decided to republish &quot;Yizkor&quot; in Yiddish. The Hebrew original was published in Jaffa in 1911; it consisted of eulogies to Zionist martyrs and included an account by Ben-Gurion of his Petah Tikva and Sejera experiences. The first edition appeared in February 1916 and was an immediate success; all 3,500 copies were sold. A second edition of 16,000 was published in August. Martin Buber wrote the introduction to the 1918 German edition. The follow-up was conceived as an anthology of work from Poale Zion leaders; in fact Ben-Gurion took over as editor, writing the introduction and two-thirds of the text. He suspended all his Poale Zion activities and spent most of the next 18 months in New York Public Library. Ben-Zvi, originally designated as co-editor, contributed a section on Jewish history in which he expounded the theory that the fellahin currently living in the area were descendants of pre-Roman conquest Jews. &quot;Eretz Israel – Past and Present&quot; was published in April 1918. It cost $2 and was 500 pages long, over twice the length of &quot;Yizkor&quot;. It was an immediate success, selling 7,000 copies in 4 months; second and third editions were printed. Total sales of 25,000 copies made a profit of $20,000 for Poale Zion. It made Ben-Gurion the most prominent Poale Zion leader in America.

In May 1918 Ben-Gurion joined the newly formed Jewish Legion of the British Army and trained at Fort Edward in Windsor, Nova Scotia. He volunteered for the 38th Battalion, Royal Fusiliers, one of the four which constituted the Jewish Legion. His unit fought against the Ottomans as part of Chaytor&#x27;s Force during the Palestine Campaign, though he remained in a Cairo hospital with dysentery. In 1918, after a period of guarding prisoners of war in the Egyptian desert, his battalion was transferred to Sarafand. On 13 December 1918 he was demoted from corporal to private, fined three days&#x27; pay and transferred to the lowest company in the battalion. He had been five days absent without leave visiting friends in Jaffa. He was demobilised in early 1919.

=== Marriage and family ===
One of Ben-Gurion&#x27;s companions when he made the Aliyah was Rachel Nelkin. Her stepfather, Reb Simcha Isaac, was the leading Zionist in Płońsk, and they had met three years previously at one of his meetings. It was expected that their relationship would continue when they landed in Jaffa but he shut her out after she was fired on her first day labouringmanuring the citrus groves of Petah Tikva.

Whilst in New York City in 1915, he met Russian-born Paula Munweis and they married in 1917. In November 1919, after an 18-month separation, Paula and their daughter Geula joined Ben-Gurion in Jaffa. It was the first time he met his one-year-old daughter. The couple had three children: a son, Amos, and two daughters, Geula Ben-Eliezer and Renana Leshem. Amos married Mary Callow, already pregnant with their first child. She was an Irish gentile, and although Reform rabbi Joachim Prinz converted her to Judaism soon after, neither the Palestine rabbinate nor her mother-in-law Paula Ben-Gurion considered her a real Jew until she underwent an Orthodox conversion many years later. Amos became Deputy Inspector-General of the Israel Police, and also the director-general of a textile factory. He and Mary had six granddaughters from their two daughters and a son, Alon, who married a Greek gentile. Geula had two sons and a daughter, and Renana, who worked as a microbiologist at the Israel Institute for Biological Research, had a son.

== Zionist leadership between 1919 and 1948 ==
After the death of theorist Ber Borochov, the left-wing and centrist factions of Poalei Zion split in February 1919, with Ben-Gurion and his friend Berl Katznelson leading the centrist faction of the Labor Zionist movement. The moderate Poalei Zion formed Ahdut HaAvoda with Ben-Gurion as leader in March 1919.

In 1920 he assisted in the formation of the Histadrut, the Zionist Labor Federation in Palestine, and served as its general secretary from 1921 until 1935. At Ahdut HaAvoda&#x27;s 3rd Congress, held in 1924 at Ein Harod, Shlomo Kaplansky, a veteran leader from Poalei Zion, proposed that the party should support the British Mandatory authorities&#x27; plans for setting up an elected legislative council in Palestine. He argued that a Parliament, even with an Arab majority, was the way forward. Ben-Gurion, already emerging as the leader of the Yishuv, succeeded in getting Kaplansky&#x27;s ideas rejected.

In 1930, Hapoel Hatzair (founded by A. D. Gordon in 1905) and Ahdut HaAvoda joined forces to create Mapai, the more moderate Zionist labour party (it was still a left-wing organisation, but not as far-left as other factions) under Ben-Gurion&#x27;s leadership. In the 1940s the left-wing of Mapai broke away to form Mapam. Labor Zionism became the dominant tendency in the World Zionist Organization and in 1935 Ben-Gurion became chairman of the executive committee of the Jewish Agency, a role he kept until the creation of the state of Israel in 1948.

During the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine, Ben-Gurion instigated a policy of restraint (&quot;Havlagah&quot;) in which the Haganah and other Jewish groups did not retaliate for Arab attacks against Jewish civilians, concentrating only on self-defense. In 1937, the Peel Commission recommended partitioning Palestine into Jewish and Arab areas and Ben-Gurion supported this policy. This led to conflict with Ze&#x27;ev Jabotinsky who opposed partition and as a result Jabotinsky&#x27;s supporters split with the Haganah and abandoned Havlagah.

The house where he lived from 1931 on, and for part of each year after 1953, is now a historic house museum in Tel Aviv, the &quot;Ben-Gurion House&quot;. He also lived in London for some months in 1941.

In 1946, Ben-Gurion and North Vietnam&#x27;s Politburo chairman Ho Chi Minh became very friendly when they stayed at the same hotel in Paris. Ho Chi Minh offered Ben-Gurion a Jewish home-in-exile in Vietnam. Ben-Gurion declined, telling Ho Chi Minh: &quot;I am certain we shall be able to establish a Jewish Government in Palestine.&quot;

== Views and opinions ==

=== Leninist views ===
According to his biographer Tom Segev, Ben-Gurion deeply admired Lenin and intended to be a &#x27;Zionist Lenin&#x27;. In &quot;Ben-Gurion: A Political Life&quot; by Shimon Peres and David Landau, Peres recalls his first meeting with Ben-Gurion as a young activist in the No&#x27;ar Ha&#x27;Oved youth movement. Ben-Gurion gave him a lift, and out of the blue told him why he preferred Lenin to Trotsky: &quot;Lenin was Trotsky&#x27;s inferior in terms of intellect&quot;, but Lenin, unlike Trotsky, &quot;was decisive&quot;. When confronted with a dilemma, Trotsky would do what Ben-Gurion despised about the old-style diaspora Jews: he manoeuvred; as opposed to Lenin, who would cut the Gordian knot, accepting losses while focusing on the essentials. In Peres&#x27; opinion, the essence of Ben-Gurion&#x27;s life work were &quot;the decisions he made at critical junctures in Israel&#x27;s history&quot;, and none was as important as the acceptance of the 1947 partition plan, a painful compromise which gave the emerging Jewish state little more than a fighting chance, but which, according to Peres, enabled the establishment of the State of Israel.

===1937 letter===
The 1937 Ben-Gurion letter was written when he was head of the executive committee of the Jewish Agency, to his son Amos on 5 October 1937. The letter is well known to scholars as it provides insight into Ben-Gurion&#x27;s reaction to the report of the Peel Commission released on 7 July of the same year. It has also been subject to significant debate by scholars as a result of scribbled-out text that may or may not provide written evidence of an intention to &quot;expel the Arabs&quot; or &quot;not expel the Arabs&quot; depending on one&#x27;s interpretation of whether such deletion was intended by Ben-Gurion.

===Role in 1948 exodus of Palestinians===
Israeli historian Benny Morris wrote that the idea of expulsion of Palestinian Arabs was endorsed in practice by mainstream Zionist leaders, particularly Ben-Gurion. He did not give clear or written orders in that regard, but Morris claims that Ben-Gurion&#x27;s subordinates understood his policy well:

=== Views on Arab relations and coexistence ===

Ben-Gurion published two volumes setting out his views on relations between Zionists and the Arab world: &quot;We and Our Neighbors&quot;, published in 1931, and &quot;My Talks with Arab Leaders&quot; published in 1967. Ben-Gurion believed in the equal rights of Arabs who remained in and would become citizens of Israel. He was quoted as saying, &quot;We must start working in Jaffa. Jaffa must employ Arab workers. And there is a question of their wages. I believe that they should receive the same wage as a Jewish worker. An Arab has also the right to be elected president of the state, should he be elected by all.&quot;

Ben-Gurion recognised the strong attachment of Palestinian Arabs to the land. In an address to the United Nations on 2 October 1947, he doubted the likelihood of peace:

This is our native land; it is not as birds of passage that we return to it. But it is situated in an area engulfed by Arabic-speaking people, mainly followers of Islam. Now, if ever, we must do more than make peace with them; we must achieve collaboration and alliance on equal terms. Remember what Arab delegations from Palestine and its neighbors say in the General Assembly and in other places: talk of Arab-Jewish amity sound fantastic, for the Arabs do not wish it, they will not sit at the same table with us, they want to treat us as they do the Jews of Bagdad, Cairo, and Damascus.

Nahum Goldmann criticised Ben-Gurion for what he viewed as a confrontational approach to the Arab world. Goldmann wrote, &quot;Ben-Gurion is the man principally responsible for the anti-Arab policy, because it was he who molded the thinking of generations of Israelis.&quot; Simha Flapan quoted Ben-Gurion as stating in 1938: &quot;I believe in our power, in our power which will grow, and if it will grow agreement will come...&quot;

Goldmann reported that Ben Gurion had told him in private in 1956:

In 1909, Ben-Gurion attempted to learn Arabic but gave up. He later became fluent in Turkish. The only other languages he was able to use when in discussions with Arab leaders were English, and to a lesser extent, French.

=== Stances on British rule ===
The British 1939 White paper stipulated that Jewish immigration to Palestine was to be limited to 15,000 a year for the first five years, and would subsequently be contingent on Arab consent. Restrictions were also placed on the rights of Jews to buy land from Arabs. After this Ben-Gurion changed his policy towards the British, stating: &quot;Peace in Palestine is not the best situation for thwarting the policy of the White Paper&quot;. Ben-Gurion believed a peaceful solution with the Arabs had no chance and soon began preparing the Yishuv for war. According to Teveth &quot;through his campaign to mobilize the Yishuv in support of the British war effort, he strove to build the nucleus of a &#x27;Hebrew Army&#x27;, and his success in this endeavor later brought victory to Zionism in the struggle to establish a Jewish state.&quot;

During the Second World War, Ben-Gurion encouraged the Jewish population to volunteer for the British Army. He famously told Jews to &quot;support the British as if there is no White Paper and oppose the White Paper as if there is no war&quot;. About 10% of the Jewish population of Palestine volunteered for the British Armed Forces, including many women. At the same time Ben-Gurion assisted the illegal immigration of thousands of European Jewish refugees to Palestine during a period when the British placed heavy restrictions on Jewish immigration.

In 1944, the Irgun and Lehi, two Jewish right-wing armed groups, declared a rebellion against British rule and began attacking British administrative and police targets. Ben-Gurion and other mainstream Zionist leaders opposed armed action against the British, and after Lehi assassinated Lord Moyne, the British Minister of State in the Middle East, decided to stop it by force. While Lehi was convinced to suspend operations, the Irgun refused and as a result, the Haganah began supplying intelligence to the British enabling them to arrest Irgun members, and abducting and often torturing Irgun members, handing some over to the British while keeping others detained in secret Haganah prisons. This campaign, which was called the Saison or &quot;Hunting Season&quot;, left the Irgun unable to continue operations as they struggled to survive. Irgun leader Menachem Begin ordered his fighters not to retaliate so as to prevent a civil war. The Saison became increasingly controversial in the Yishuv, including within the ranks of the Haganah, and it was aborted at the end of March 1945.

At the end of World War II, the Zionist leadership in Palestine had expected a British decision to establish a Jewish state. However, it became clear that the British had no intention of immediately establishing a Jewish state and that limits on Jewish immigration would remain for the time being. As a result, with Ben-Gurion&#x27;s approval the Haganah entered into a secret alliance with the Irgun and Lehi called the Jewish Resistance Movement in October 1945 and participated in attacks against the British. In June 1946, the British launched Operation Agatha, a large police and military operation throughout Palestine, searching for arms and arresting Jewish leaders and Haganah members in order to stop the attacks and find documentary evidence of the alliance the British suspected existed between the Haganah, Irgun, and Lehi. The British had intended to detain Ben-Gurion during the operation but he was visiting Paris at the time. The British stored the documents they had captured from the Jewish Agency headquarters in the King David Hotel, which was being used as a military and administrative headquarters. Ben-Gurion agreed to the Irgun&#x27;s plan to bomb the King David Hotel in order to destroy incriminating documents that Ben-Gurion feared would prove that the Haganah had been participating in the violent insurrection against the British in cooperation with the Irgun and Lehi with the approval of himself and other Jewish Agency officials. However, Ben-Gurion asked that the operation be delayed, but the Irgun refused. The Irgun carried out the King David Hotel bombing in July 1946, killing 91 people. Ben-Gurion publicly condemned the bombing. In the aftermath of the bombing, Ben-Gurion ordered that the Jewish Resistance Movement be dissolved. From then on, the Irgun and Lehi continued to regularly attack the British, but the Haganah rarely did so, and while Ben-Gurion along with other mainstream Zionist leaders publicly condemned the Irgun and Lehi attacks, in practice the Haganah under their direction rarely cooperated with the British in attempting to suppress the insurgency.

Due to the Jewish insurgency, bad publicity over the restriction of Jewish immigrants to Palestine, non-acceptance of a partitioned state (as suggested by the United Nations) amongst Arab leaders, and the cost of keeping 100,000 troops in Palestine the British Government referred the matter to the United Nations. In September 1947, the British decided to terminate the Mandate. In November 1947, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution approving the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine. While the Jewish Agency under Ben-Gurion accepted, the Arabs rejected the plan and the 1947–1948 civil war in Mandatory Palestine broke out. Ben-Gurion&#x27;s strategy was for the Haganah to hold on to every position with no retreat or surrender and then launch an offensive when British forces had evacuated to such an extent that there would be no more danger of British intervention. This strategy was successful, and by May 1948 Jewish forces were winning the civil war. On 14 May 1948, a few hours before the British Mandate officially terminated, Ben-Gurion declared Israeli independence in a ceremony in Tel Aviv. A few hours later, the State of Israel officially came into being when the British Mandate terminated on 15 May. The 1948 Arab–Israeli War began immediately afterwards as numerous Arab nations then invaded Israel.

=== Attitude towards conquering the West Bank ===
After the ten-day campaign during the 1948 war, the Israelis were militarily superior to their enemies and the Cabinet subsequently considered where and when to attack next. On 24 September, an incursion made by the Palestinian irregulars in the Latrun sector, killing 23 Israeli soldiers, precipitated the debate. On 26 September, Ben-Gurion put his argument to the Cabinet to attack Latrun again and conquer the whole or a large part of West Bank. The motion was rejected by a vote of seven to five after discussions. Ben-Gurion qualified the cabinet&#x27;s decision as (&quot;a source of lament for generations&quot;) considering Israel may have lost forever the Old City of Jerusalem.

There is a controversy around these events. According to Uri Bar-Joseph, Ben-Gurion placed a plan that called for a limited action aimed at the conquest of Latrun, and not for an all-out offensive. According to David Tal, in the cabinet meeting, Ben-Gurion reacted to what he had been just told by a delegation from Jerusalem. He points out that this view that Ben-Gurion had planned to conquer the West Bank is unsubstantiated in both Ben-Gurion&#x27;s diary and in the Cabinet protocol.

The topic came back at the end of the 1948 war, when General Yigal Allon also proposed the conquest of the West Bank up to the Jordan River as the natural, defensible border of the state. This time, Ben-Gurion refused although he was aware that the IDF was militarily strong enough to carry out the conquest. He feared the reaction of Western powers and wanted to maintain good relations with the United States and not to provoke the British. Moreover, in his opinion the results of the war were already satisfactory and Israeli leaders had to focus on the building of a nation.

According to Benny Morris, &quot;Ben-Gurion got cold feet during the war. ... If [he] had carried out a large expulsion and cleansed the whole country -the whole Land of Israel, as far as the Jordan River. It may yet turn out that this was his fatal mistake. If he had carried out a full expulsion rather than a partial one- he would have stabilized the State of Israel for generations.&quot;

=== Religious parties and status quo ===
In order to prevent the coalescence of the religious right, the Histadrut agreed to a vague status quo agreement with Mizrahi in 1935.

Ben-Gurion was aware that world Jewry could and would only feel comfortable to throw their support behind the nascent state if it was shrouded with religious mystique. That would include an orthodox tacit acquiescence to the entity. Therefore, in September 1947 Ben-Gurion decided to reach a formal status quo agreement with the Orthodox Agudat Yisrael party. He sent a letter to Agudat Yisrael stating that while being committed to establishing a non-theocratic state with freedom of religion, he promised that the Shabbat would be Israel&#x27;s official day of rest, that in state-provided kitchens there would be access to kosher food, that every effort would be made to provide a single jurisdiction for Jewish family affairs, and that each sector would be granted autonomy in the sphere of education, provided minimum standards regarding the curriculum be observed. To a large extent this agreement provided the framework for religious affairs in Israel till the present day, and is often used as a benchmark regarding the arrangement of religious affairs in Israel.

=== Religious belief ===
Ben-Gurion described himself as an irreligious person who developed atheism in his youth and who demonstrated no great sympathy for the elements of traditional Judaism, though he quoted the Bible extensively in his speeches and writings. Modern Orthodox philosopher Yeshayahu Leibowitz considered Ben-Gurion &quot;to have hated Judaism more than any other man he had met&quot;. He was proud of the fact that he had only set foot in a synagogue once in Israel, worked on Yom Kippur and ate pork. 

In later time, Ben-Gurion refused to define himself as &quot;secular&quot;, and he regarded himself a believer in God. In a 1970 interview, he described himself as a pantheist, and stated that &quot;I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s an afterlife. I think there is.&quot; In 1969 he combined his Zionism with a moderate religious view: &quot;In 1948 the establishment of a Hebrew state and the independence of Israel were declared, because our people were sure that their prayer would be answered if they would return to the land&quot;. During an interview with the leftist weekly &quot;Hotam&quot; two years before his death, he revealed, &quot;I too have a deep faith in the Almighty. I believe in one God, the omnipotent Creator. My consciousness is aware of the existence of material and spirit ... [But] I cannot understand how order reigns in nature, in the world and universeunless there exists a superior force. This supreme Creator is beyond my comprehension . . . but it directs everything.&quot;

In a letter to the writer Eliezer Steinman, he wrote &quot;Today, more than ever, the &#x27;religious&#x27; tend to relegate Judaism to observing dietary laws and preserving the Sabbath. This is considered religious reform. I prefer the Fifteenth Psalm, lovely are the psalms of Israel. The Shulchan Aruch is a product of our nation&#x27;s life in the Exile. It was produced in the Exile, in conditions of Exile. A nation in the process of fulfilling its every task, physically and spiritually ... must compose a &#x27;New Shulchan&#x27;—and our nation&#x27;s intellectuals are required, in my opinion, to fulfill their responsibility in this.&quot;

== Military leadership ==
During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War Ben-Gurion oversaw the nascent state&#x27;s military operations. During the first weeks of Israel&#x27;s independence, he ordered all militias to be replaced by one national army, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). To that end, Ben-Gurion used a firm hand during the Altalena Affair, a ship carrying arms purchased by the Irgun led by Menachem Begin. He insisted that all weapons be handed over to the IDF. When fighting broke out on the Tel Aviv beach he ordered it be taken by force and to shell the ship. Sixteen Irgun fighters and three IDF soldiers were killed in this battle. Following the policy of a unified military force, he also ordered that the Palmach headquarters be disbanded and its units be integrated with the rest of the IDF, to the chagrin of many of its members. By absorbing the Irgun force into Israel&#x27;s IDF, the Israelis eliminated competition and the central government controlled all military forces within the country. His attempts to reduce the number of Mapam members in the senior ranks led to the &quot;Generals&#x27; Revolt&quot; in June 1948.

As head of the Jewish Agency from 1935, Ben-Gurion was de facto leader of the Jewish population even before the state was declared. In this position, Ben-Gurion played a major role in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. When the IDF archives and others were opened in the late 1980s, scholars started to reconsider the events and the role of Ben-Gurion.

David Ben-Gurion oversaw and approved Israel&#x27;s biological warfare poisoning operations against Palestinian Arab civilians in Operation Cast Thy Bread during the 1948 war. The poisoning operations involved targeting dozens of Palestinian water wells with typhoid and dysentery bacteria, as well as the aqueducts in Palestinian cities such as Acre. These operations caused typhoid epidemics and mass infections. 

===Plan Dalet===
Plan Dalet was a plan worked out by the Haganah in Mandatory Palestine in March 1948, requested by Ben Gurion, consisting of a set of guidelines to take control of Mandatory Palestine, declare a Jewish state, and defend its borders and people, including the Jewish population outside of the borders, &quot;before, and in anticipation of&quot; the invasion by regular Arab armies. According to the Israeli Yehoshafat Harkabi, Plan Dalet called for the conquest of Arab towns and villages inside and along the borders of the area allocated to the proposed Jewish State in the UN Partition Plan. In case of resistance, the population of conquered villages was to be expelled outside the borders of the Jewish state. If no resistance was met, the residents could stay put, under military rule.

The intent of Plan Dalet has been long debated by historians. Some assert that it was entirely defensive , while others say it was a deliberate plan with the purpose of expulsion or ethnic cleansing .

== Founding of Israel ==
On 14 May 1948, on the last day of the British Mandate, Ben-Gurion declared the independence of the State of Israel. In the Israeli declaration of independence, he stated that the new nation would &quot;uphold the full social and political equality of all its citizens, without distinction of religion, race&quot;.

In his War Diaries in February 1948, Ben-Gurion wrote: &quot;The war shall give us the land. The concepts of &#x27;ours&#x27; and &#x27;not ours&#x27; are peace concepts only, and they lose their meaning during war.&quot; Also later he confirmed this by stating that, &quot;In the Negev we shall not buy the land. We shall conquer it. You forget that we are at war.&quot; The Arabs, meanwhile, also vied with Israel over the control of territory by means of war, while the Jordanian &quot;Arab Legion&quot; had decided to concentrate its forces in Bethlehem and in Hebron in order to save that district for its Arab inhabitants, and to prevent territorial gains for Israel. Israeli historian Benny Morris has written of the massacres of Palestinian Arabs in 1948, and has stated that Ben-Gurion &quot;covered up for the officers who did the massacres.&quot;

===First tenure as prime minister===
After leading Israel during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Ben-Gurion was elected Prime Minister of Israel when his Mapai (Labour) party won the largest number of Knesset seats in the first national election, held on 14 February 1949. He remained in that post until 1963, except for a period of nearly two years between 1954 and 1955. As prime minister, he oversaw the establishment of the state&#x27;s institutions. He presided over various national projects aimed at the rapid development of the country and its population: Operation Magic Carpet, the airlift of Jews from Arab countries, the construction of the National Water Carrier, rural development projects and the establishment of new towns and cities. In particular, he called for pioneering settlement in outlying areas, especially in the Negev. Ben-Gurion saw the struggle to make the Negev desert bloom as an area where the Jewish people could make a major contribution to humanity as a whole. He believed that the sparsely populated and barren Negev desert offered a great opportunity for the Jews to settle in Palestine with minimal obstruction of the Arab population, and set a personal example by settling in kibbutz Sde Boker at the center of the Negev.

====Reprisal operations====


During this period, Palestinian fedayeen repeatedly infiltrated into Israel from Arab territory. In 1953, after a handful of unsuccessful retaliatory actions, Ben-Gurion charged Ariel Sharon, then security chief of the northern region, with setting up a new commando unit designed to respond to fedayeen infiltrations. Ben-Gurion told Sharon, &quot;The Palestinians must learn that they will pay a high price for Israeli lives.&quot; Sharon formed Unit 101, a small commando unit answerable directly to the IDF General Staff tasked with retaliating for fedayeen raids. During its five months of existence, the unit launched repeated raids against military targets and villages used as bases by the fedayeen. These attacks became known as the reprisal operations. One such operation gained international condemnation of Israel, after an Israeli army attack on the village of Qibya in the then Jordanian-ruled West Bank, ended with a massacre of 69 Palestinian villagers, two thirds of them women and children. Ben Gurion denied involvement of the army and placed blame on Israeli civilians, a fabrication which was repeated by him at the UN. He was seen as having protected involved subordinates in the military from accountability.

===Acting prime minister===
In 1953, Ben-Gurion announced his intention to withdraw from government and was replaced by Moshe Sharett, who was elected the second Prime Minister of Israel in January 1954. However, Ben-Gurion temporarily served as acting prime minister when Sharett visited the United States in 1955. During Ben-Gurion&#x27;s tenure as acting prime minister, the IDF carried out Operation Olive Leaves, a successful attack on fortified Syrian emplacements near the northeastern shores of the Sea of Galilee. The operation was a response to Syrian attacks on Israeli fishermen. Ben-Gurion had ordered the operation without consulting the Israeli cabinet and seeking a vote on the matter, and Sharett would later bitterly complain that Ben-Gurion had exceeded his authority.

===Second tenure as prime minister===


Ben-Gurion returned to government in 1955. He assumed the post of defence minister and was soon re-elected prime minister. When he returned to government, Israeli forces began responding more aggressively to Egyptian-sponsored Palestinian guerrilla attacks from Gaza, which was under Egyptian rule. Egypt&#x27;s President Gamal Abdel Nasser signed the Egyptian-Czech arms deal and purchased a large number of modern arms. The Israelis responded by arming themselves with help from France. Nasser blocked the passage of Israeli ships through the Straits of Tiran and the Suez Canal. In July 1956, the United States and Britain withdrew their offer to fund the Aswan High Dam project on the Nile and a week later, Nasser ordered the nationalisation of the French and British-controlled Suez Canal. In late 1956, the bellicosity of Arab statements prompted Israel to remove the threat of the concentrated Egyptian forces in the Sinai, and Israel invaded the Egyptian Sinai Peninsula. Other Israeli aims were elimination of the fedayeen incursions into Israel that made life unbearable for its southern population and opening the blockaded Straits of Tiran for Israeli ships. Israel occupied much of the peninsula within a few days. As agreed beforehand, within a couple of days, Britain and France invaded too, aiming at regaining Western control of the Suez Canal and removing the Egyptian president Nasser. The United States pressure forced the British and French to back down and Israel to withdraw from Sinai in return for free Israeli navigation through the Red Sea. The United Nations responded by establishing its first peacekeeping force, (UNEF). It was stationed between Egypt and Israel and for the next decade it maintained peace and stopped the fedayeen incursions into Israel.

In 1957, Ben-Gurion was injured by a grenade thrown into the Knesset plenum by a troubled Jewish immigrant from Syria, Moshe Dwek, who claimed that nobody was being attentive to his needs. 

In 1959, Ben-Gurion learned from West German officials of reports that the notorious Nazi war criminal, Adolf Eichmann, was likely living in hiding in Argentina. In response, Ben-Gurion ordered the Israel foreign intelligence service, the Mossad, to capture the international fugitive alive for trial in Israel. In 1960, the mission was accomplished, and Eichmann was tried and convicted in an internationally publicised trial for various offences including crimes against humanity and was subsequently executed in 1962.

Ben-Gurion is said to have been &quot;nearly obsessed&quot; with Israel&#x27;s obtaining nuclear weapons, feeling that a nuclear arsenal was the only way to counter the Arabs&#x27; superiority in numbers, space, and financial resources, and that it was the only sure guarantee of Israel&#x27;s survival and the prevention of another Holocaust. During his final months as premier Ben-Gurion was engaged in a, now declassified, diplomatic standoff with the United States.

Ben-Gurion stepped down as prime minister on 16 June 1963. According to historian Yechiam Weitz, when he unexpectedly resigned:

He was asked to reconsider his decision by the cabinet. The country, however, seemed to have anticipated his move and, unlike the response to his resignation in 1953, no serious efforts were made to dissuade him from resigning... [His reasons include] his political isolation, suspicion of colleagues and rivals, apparent inability to interact with the full spectrum of reality, and belief that his life&#x27;s work was disintegrating. His resignation was not an act of farewell but another act of his personal struggle and possibly an indication of his mental state.

Ben-Gurion chose Levi Eshkol as his successor. A year later a bitter rivalry developed between the two on the issue of the Lavon Affair, a failed 1954 Israeli covert operation in Egypt. Ben-Gurion had insisted that the operation be properly investigated, while Eshkol refused. After failing to unseat Eshkol as Mapai party leader in the 1965 Mapai leadership election, Ben-Gurion subsequently broke with Mapai in June 1965 and formed a new party, Rafi, while Mapai merged with Ahdut HaAvoda to form Alignment, with Eshkol as its head. Alignment defeated Rafi in the November 1965 election, establishing Eshkol as the country&#x27;s leader.

== Later political career ==
In May 1967, Egypt began massing forces in the Sinai Peninsula after expelling UN peacekeepers and closed the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping. This, together with the actions of other Arab states, caused Israel to begin preparing for war. The situation lasted until the outbreak of the Six-Day War on 5 June. In Jerusalem, there were calls for a national unity government or an emergency government. During this period, Ben-Gurion met with his old rival Menachem Begin in Sde Boker. Begin asked Ben-Gurion to join Eshkol&#x27;s national unity government. Although Eshkol&#x27;s Mapai party initially opposed the widening of its government, it eventually changed its mind. On 23 May, IDF Chief of Staff Yitzhak Rabin met with Ben-Gurion to ask for reassurance. Ben-Gurion, however, accused Rabin of putting Israel in mortal danger by mobilising the reserves and openly preparing for war with an Arab coalition. Ben-Gurion told Rabin that at the very least, he should have obtained the support of a foreign power, as he had done during the Suez Crisis. Rabin was shaken by the meeting and took to bed for 36 hours.

After the Israeli government decided to go to war, planning a preemptive strike to destroy the Egyptian Air Force followed by a ground offensive, Defense Minister Moshe Dayan told Ben-Gurion of the impending attack on the night of 4–5 June. Ben-Gurion subsequently wrote in his diary that he was troubled by Israel&#x27;s impending offensive. On 5 June, the Six-Day War began with Operation Focus, an Israeli air attack that decimated the Egyptian air force. Israel then captured the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza Strip from Egypt, the West Bank, including East Jerusalem from Jordan, and the Golan Heights from Syria in a series of campaigns. Following the war, Ben-Gurion was in favour of returning all the captured territories apart from East Jerusalem, the Golan Heights and Mount Hebron as part of a peace agreement.

On 11 June, Ben-Gurion met with a small group of supporters in his home. During the meeting, Defense Minister Moshe Dayan proposed autonomy for the West Bank, the transfer of Gazan refugees to Jordan, and a united Jerusalem serving as Israel&#x27;s capital. Ben-Gurion agreed with him but foresaw problems in transferring Palestinian refugees from Gaza to Jordan, and recommended that Israel insist on direct talks with Egypt, favouring withdrawal from the Sinai Peninsula in exchange for peace and free navigation through the Straits of Tiran. The following day, he met with Jerusalem mayor Teddy Kollek in his Knesset office. Despite occupying a lower executive position, Ben-Gurion treated Kollek like a subordinate.

Following the Six-Day War, Ben-Gurion criticised what he saw as the government&#x27;s apathy towards the construction and development of the city. To ensure that a united Jerusalem remained in Israeli hands, he advocated a massive Jewish settlement programme for the Old City and the hills surrounding the city, as well as the establishment of large industries in the Jerusalem area to attract Jewish migrants. He argued that no Arabs would have to be evicted in the process. Ben-Gurion also urged extensive Jewish settlement in Hebron.

In 1968, when Rafi merged with Mapai to form the Alignment, Ben-Gurion refused to reconcile with his old party. He favoured electoral reforms in which a constituency-based system would replace what he saw as a chaotic proportional representation method. He formed another new party, the National List, which won four seats in the 1969 election.

== Final years and death ==

Ben-Gurion retired from politics in 1970 and spent his last years living in a modest home in kibbutz Sde Boker, working on an 11-volume history of Israel&#x27;s early years. In 1971, he visited Israeli positions along the Suez Canal during the War of Attrition.

On 18 November 1973, shortly after the Yom Kippur War, Ben-Gurion suffered a cerebral haemorrhage, and was taken to Sheba Medical Center in Tel HaShomer, Ramat Gan. His condition began deteriorating on 23 November and he died a few days later, on 1 December. His body lay in state in the Knesset compound before being flown by helicopter to Sde Boker. Sirens sounded across the country to mark his death. He was buried alongside his wife Paula in the Ben-Gurion Tomb National Park at Midreshet Ben-Gurion. 

== Awards ==
* In 1949, Ben-Gurion was awarded the Solomon Bublick Award of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, in recognition of his contributions to the State of Israel.
* In both 1951 and 1971, he was awarded the Bialik Prize for Jewish thought.

== Commemoration ==

* A desert research center, Midreshet Ben-Gurion, near his &quot;hut&quot; in Kibbutz Sde Boker has been named in his honour. Ben-Gurion&#x27;s grave is in the research center.
* An English Heritage blue plaque, unveiled in 1986, marks where Ben-Gurion lived in London at 75 Warrington Crescent, Maida Vale, W9.
* In the 7th arrondissement of Paris, part of a riverside promenade of the Seine is named after him.
* His portrait appears on both the 500 lirot and the 50 (old) sheqalim notes issued by the Bank of Israel.

== Controversies ==

Ben Gurion was among the Zionist leaders who prioritized Zionist goals over rescuing Jews during the Holocaust. 
The following 1938 quote by him summarizes this view: 
&quot;If I knew that it would be possible to save all the children in Germany by transporting them to England, and only half of them by transporting them to Eretz Israel, I would choose the second – because we are not only accounting for these children, but also for the history of the Jewish people.&quot; 
 Whereas at the time he probably could not have imagined the extent of the imminent great tragedy, the ideology remained a cornerstone of mainstream Zionist ideology all through the Holocaust.

When Revisionist Zionist founder Ze&#x27;ev Jabotinsky died visiting a Zionist self-defense camp in the Catskill region in 1940, he was buried in Farmingdale, New York in accordance to his will about being buried where he died while also wishing that his remains be &quot;transferred to the Land of Israel only at the express order of the Jewish government of that country.&quot; Ben-Gurion had great animosity toward Jabotinsky (once calling him &quot;Vladimir Hitler&quot;) and refused to allow his reburial in Israel after independence in the decade leading to his retirement in 1963.
Much later, Prime Minister Levi Eshkol gave permission for reburial in Jerusalem&#x27;s Mount Herzl in 1964.

<text>A sailing ship is a sea-going vessel that uses sails mounted on masts to harness the power of wind and propel the vessel. There is a variety of sail plans that propel sailing ships, employing square-rigged or fore-and-aft sails. Some ships carry square sails on each mast—the brig and full-rigged ship, said to be &quot;ship-rigged&quot; when there are three or more masts. Others carry only fore-and-aft sails on each mast, for instance some schooners. Still others employ a combination of square and fore-and-aft sails, including the barque, barquentine, and brigantine.

Early sailing ships were used for river and coastal waters in Ancient Egypt and the Mediterranean. The Austronesian peoples developed maritime technologies that included the fore-and-aft crab-claw sail and with catamaran and outrigger hull configurations, which enabled the Austronesian expansion into the islands of the Indo-Pacific. This expansion originated in Taiwan BC and propagated through Island Southeast Asia, reaching Near Oceania BC, Hawaii AD, and New Zealand AD. The maritime trading network in the Indo-Pacific dates from at least 1500 BC. Later developments in Asia produced the junk and dhow—vessels that incorporated features unknown in Europe at the time.

European sailing ships with predominantly square rigs became prevalent during the Age of Discovery (15th to 17th centuries), when they crossed oceans between continents and around the world. In the European Age of Sail, a full-rigged ship was one with a bowsprit and three masts, each of which consists of a lower, top, and topgallant mast. Most sailing ships were merchantmen, but the Age of Sail also saw the development of large fleets of well-armed warships. The many steps of technological development of steamships during the 19th century provided slowly increasing competition for sailing ships—initially only on short routes where high prices could be charged. By the 1880s, ships with triple-expansion steam engines had the fuel efficiency to compete with sail on all major routes—and with scheduled sailings that were not affected by the wind direction. However, commercial sailing vessels could still be found working into the 20th century, although in reducing numbers and only in certain trades.

== History ==

By the time of the Age of Discovery—starting in the 15th century—square-rigged, multi-masted vessels were the norm and were guided by navigation techniques that included the magnetic compass and making sightings of the sun and stars that allowed transoceanic voyages. The Age of Sail reached its peak in the 18th and 19th centuries with large, heavily armed battleships and merchant sailing ships.

Sailing and steam ships coexisted for much of the 19th century. The steamers of the early part of the century had very poor fuel efficiency and were suitable only for a small number of roles, such as towing sailing ships and providing short route passenger and mail services. Both sailing and steam ships saw large technological improvements over the century. Ultimately the two large stepwise improvements in fuel efficiency of compound and then triple-expansion steam engines made the steamship, by the 1880s, able to compete in the vast majority of trades. Commercial sail still continued into the 20th century, with the last ceasing to trade by .

=== South China Sea and Austronesia ===


Early sea-going sailing vessels were used by the Austronesian peoples. The invention of catamarans, outriggers, and crab claw sails enabled the Austronesian Expansion at around 3000 to 1500 BC. From Taiwan, they rapidly colonized the islands of Maritime Southeast Asia, then sailed further onwards to Micronesia, Island Melanesia, Polynesia, and Madagascar. Austronesian rigs were distinctive in that they had spars supporting both the upper and lower edges of the sails (and sometimes in between), in contrast to western rigs which only had a spar on the upper edge.

Large Austronesian trading ships with as many as four sails were recorded by Han dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD) scholars as the &quot;kunlun bo&quot; or &quot;K&#x27;un-lun po&quot; (崑崙舶, lit. &quot;ship of the Kunlun people&quot;). They were booked by Chinese Buddhist pilgrims for passage to Southern India and Sri Lanka. Bas reliefs of large Javanese outriggers ships with various configurations of tanja sails are also found in the Borobudur temple, dating back to the 8th century CE.

By the 10th century AD, the Song dynasty started building the first Chinese seafaring junks, which adopted several features of the &quot;K&#x27;un-lun po&quot;. The junk rig in particular, became associated with Chinese coast-hugging trading ships. Junks in China were constructed from teak with pegs and nails; they featured watertight compartments and acquired center-mounted tillers and rudders. These ships became the basis for the development of Chinese warships during the Mongol Yuan dynasty, and were used in the unsuccessful Mongol invasions of Japan and Java.

The Ming dynasty (1368–1644) saw the use of junks as long-distance trading vessels. Chinese Admiral Zheng He reportedly sailed to India, Arabia, and southern Africa on a trade and diplomatic mission. Literary lore suggests that his largest vessel, the &quot;Treasure Ship&quot;, measured in length and in width, whereas modern research suggests that it was unlikely to have exceeded in length.

=== Mediterranean and Baltic ===
Sailing ships in the Mediterranean region date back to at least 3000 BC, when Egyptians used a bipod mast to support a single square sail on a vessel that mainly relied on multiple paddlers. Later the mast became a single pole, and paddles were supplanted with oars. Such vessels plied both the Nile and the Mediterranean coast. The Minoan civilization of Crete may have been the world&#x27;s first thalassocracy brought to prominence by sailing vessels dating to before 1800 BC (Middle Minoan IIB). Between 1000 BC and 400 AD, the Phoenicians, Greeks and Romans developed ships that were powered by square sails, sometimes with oars to supplement their capabilities. Such vessels used a steering oar as a rudder to control direction. 

Starting in the 8th century in Denmark, Vikings were building clinker-constructed longships propelled by a single, square sail, when practical, and oars, when necessary. A related craft was the knarr, which plied the Baltic and North Seas, using primarily sail power. The windward edge of the sail was stiffened with a beitass, a pole that fitted into the lower corner of the sail, when sailing close to the wind.

=== Indian Ocean ===

India&#x27;s maritime history began during the 3rd millennium BCE when inhabitants of the Indus Valley initiated maritime trading contact with Mesopotamia. Indian kingdoms such as the Kalinga from as early as 2nd century CE are believed to have had sailing ships. One of the earliest instances of documented evidence of Indian sailing ship building comes from the mural of three-masted ship in the Ajanta caves that date back to 400-500 CE.

The Indian Ocean was the venue for increasing trade between India and Africa between 1200 and 1500. The vessels employed would be classified as dhows with lateen rigs. During this interval such vessels grew in capacity from 100 to 400 tonnes. Dhows were often built with teak planks from India and Southeast Asia, sewn together with coconut husk fiber—no nails were employed. This period also saw the implementation of center-mounted rudders, controlled with a tiller.

=== Global exploration ===
Technological advancements that were important to the Age of Discovery in the 15th century were the adoption of the magnetic compass and advances in ship design.

The compass was an addition to the ancient method of navigation based on sightings of the sun and stars. The compass was invented by Chinese. It had been used for navigation in China by the 11th century and was adopted by the Arab traders in the Indian Ocean. The compass spread to Europe by the late 12th or early 13th century. Use of the compass for navigation in the Indian Ocean was first mentioned in 1232. The Europeans used a &quot;dry&quot; compass, with a needle on a pivot. The compass card was also a European invention.

At the beginning of the 15th century, the carrack was the most capable European ocean-going ship. It was carvel-built and large enough to be stable in heavy seas. It was capable of carrying a large cargo and the provisions needed for very long voyages. Later carracks were square-rigged on the foremast and mainmast and lateen-rigged on the mizzenmast. They had a high rounded stern with large aftcastle, forecastle and bowsprit at the stem. As the predecessor of the galleon, the carrack was one of the most influential ship designs in history; while ships became more specialized in the following centuries, the basic design remained unchanged throughout this period.

Ships of this era were only able to sail approximately 70° into the wind and tacked from one side to the other across the wind with difficulty, which made it challenging to avoid shipwrecks when near shores or shoals during storms. Nonetheless, such vessels reached India around Africa with Vasco da Gama, the Americas with Christopher Columbus, and around the world under Ferdinand Magellan.

=== 1700 to 1850 ===


Sailing ships became longer and faster over time, with ship-rigged vessels carrying taller masts with more square sails. Other sail plans emerged, as well, that had just fore-and-aft sails (schooners), or a mixture of the two (brigantines, barques and barquentines).

==== Warships ====

Cannons were introduced in the 14th century, but did not become common at sea until they could be reloaded quickly enough to be reused in the same battle. The size of a ship required to carry a large number of cannon made oar-based propulsion impossible, and warships came to rely primarily on sails. The sailing man-of-war emerged during the 16th century.

By the middle of the 17th century, warships were carrying increasing numbers of cannon on three decks. Naval tactics evolved to bring each ship&#x27;s firepower to bear in a line of battle—coordinated movements of a fleet of warships to engage a line of ships in the enemy fleet. Carracks with a single cannon deck evolved into galleons with as many as two full cannon decks, which evolved into the man-of-war, and further into the ship of the line—designed for engaging the enemy in a line of battle. One side of a ship was expected to shoot broadsides against an enemy ship at close range. In the 18th century, the small and fast frigate and sloop-of-war—too small to stand in the line of battle—evolved to convoy trade, scout for enemy ships and blockade enemy coasts.

==== Clippers ====

The term &quot;clipper&quot; started to be used in the first quarter of the 19th century. It was applied to sailing vessels designed primarily for speed. Only a small proportion of sailing vessels could properly have the term applied to them.

Early examples were the schooners and brigantines, called Baltimore clippers, used for blockade running or as privateers in the War of 1812 and afterwards for smuggling opium or illegally transporting slaves. Larger clippers, usually ship or barque rigged and with a different hull design, were built for the California trade (from east coast USA ports to San Francisco) after gold was discovered in 1848 the associated shipbuilding boom lasted until 1854.

Clippers were built for trade between the United Kingdom and China after the East India Company lost its monopoly in 1834. The primary cargo was tea, and sailing ships, particularly tea clippers, dominated this long-distance route until the development of fuel efficient steamships coincided with the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869.

Other clippers worked on the Australian immigrant routes or, in smaller quantities, in any role where a fast passage secured higher rates of freight or passenger fares. Whilst many clippers were ship rigged, the definition is not limited to any rig.

Clippers were generally built for a specific trade: those in the California trade had to withstand the seas of Cape Horn, whilst Tea Clippers were designed for the lighter and contrary winds of the China Sea. All had fine lines, with a well streamlined hull and carried a large sail area. To get the best of this, a skilled and determined master was needed in command.

==== Copper sheathing ====

During the Age of Sail, ships&#x27; hulls were under frequent attack by shipworm (which affected the structural strength of timbers), and barnacles and various marine weeds (which affected ship speed). Since before the common era, a variety of coatings had been applied to hulls to counter this effect, including pitch, wax, tar, oil, sulfur and arsenic. In the mid 18th century copper sheathing was developed as a defense against such bottom fouling. After coping with problems of galvanic deterioration of metal hull fasteners, sacrificial anodes were developed, which were designed to corrode, instead of the hull fasteners. The practice became widespread on naval vessels, starting in the late 18th century, and on merchant vessels, starting in the early 19th century, until the advent of iron and steel hulls.

=== 1850 to 1900 ===

Iron-hulled sailing ships, often referred to as &quot;windjammers&quot; or &quot;tall ships&quot;, represented the final evolution of sailing ships at the end of the Age of Sail. They were built to carry bulk cargo for long distances in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. They were the largest of merchant sailing ships, with three to five masts and square sails, as well as other sail plans. They carried lumber, guano, grain or ore between continents. Later examples had steel hulls. Iron-hulled sailing ships were mainly built from the 1870s to 1900, when steamships began to outpace them economically, due to their ability to keep a schedule regardless of the wind. Steel hulls also replaced iron hulls at around the same time. Even into the twentieth century, sailing ships could hold their own on transoceanic voyages such as Australia to Europe, since they did not require bunkerage for coal nor fresh water for steam, and they were faster than the early steamers, which usually could barely make .

The four-masted, iron-hulled ship, introduced in 1875 with the full-rigged , represented an especially efficient configuration that prolonged the competitiveness of sail against steam in the later part of the 19th century. The largest example of such ships was the five-masted, full-rigged ship , which had a load capacity of 7,800 tonnes. Ships transitioned from all sail to all steam-power from the mid 19th century into the 20th. Five-masted &quot;Preussen&quot; used steam power for driving the winches, hoists and pumps, and could be manned by a crew of 48, compared with four-masted &quot;Kruzenshtern&quot;, which has a crew of 257.

Coastal top-sail schooners with a crew as small as two managing the sail handling became an efficient way to carry bulk cargo, since only the fore-sails required tending while tacking and steam-driven machinery was often available for raising the sails and the anchor.

=== 1950 to 2000 ===

In the 20th century, the DynaRig allowed central, automated control of all sails in a manner that obviates the need for sending crew aloft. This was developed in the 1960s in Germany as a low-carbon footprint propulsion alternative for commercial ships. The rig automatically sets and reefs sails; its mast rotates to align the sails with the wind. The sailing yachts &quot;Maltese Falcon&quot; and &quot;Black Pearl&quot; employ the rig.

=== 21st century and contemporary experimental sail ===

In the 21st century, due to concern about climate change and the possibility of cost savings, companies explored using wind-power to reduce heavy fuel needs on large containerized cargo ships. By 2023, around 30 ships were using sails or attached kites, with the number expected to grow. The following year, &quot;The Economist&quot; wrote that the technology was at an inflection point as it moved from trials and testing towards adoption by the industry.

==Features==
Every sailing ship has a sail plan that is adapted to the purpose of the vessel and the ability of the crew; each has a hull, rigging and masts to hold up the sails that use the wind to power the ship; the masts are supported by standing rigging and the sails are adjusted by running rigging.

=== Hull ===

Hull shapes for sailing ships evolved from being relatively short and blunt to being longer and finer at the bow. By the nineteenth century, ships were built with reference to a half model, made from wooden layers that were pinned together. Each layer could be scaled to the actual size of the vessel in order to lay out its hull structure, starting with the keel and leading to the ship&#x27;s ribs. The ribs were pieced together from curved elements, called futtocks and tied in place until the installation of the planking. Typically, planking was caulked with a tar-impregnated yarn made from manila or hemp to make the planking watertight. Starting in the mid-19th century, iron was used first for the hull structure and later for its watertight sheathing.

=== Masts ===

Until the mid-19th century all vessels&#x27; masts were made of wood formed from a single or several pieces of timber which typically consisted of the trunk of a conifer tree. From the 16th century, vessels were often built of a size requiring masts taller and thicker than could be made from single tree trunks. On these larger vessels, to achieve the required height, the masts were built from up to four sections (also called masts), known in order of rising height above the decks as the lower, top, topgallant and royal masts. Giving the lower sections sufficient thickness necessitated building them up from separate pieces of wood. Such a section was known as a &quot;made mast&quot;, as opposed to sections formed from single pieces of timber, which were known as &quot;pole masts&quot;. Starting in the second half of the 19th century, masts were made of iron or steel.

For ships with square sails the principal masts, given their standard names in bow to stern (front to back) order, are:

* &quot;Fore-mast&quot; – the mast nearest the bow, or the mast forward of the main-mast with sections: fore-mast lower, fore topmast, and fore topgallant mast
* &quot;Main-mast&quot; – the tallest mast, usually located near the center of the ship with sections: main-mast lower, main topmast, main topgallant mast, royal mast (sometimes)
* &quot;Mizzen-mast&quot; – the aft-most mast. Typically shorter than the fore-mast with sections: mizzen-mast lower, mizzen topmast, and mizzen topgallant mast.

=== Sails ===

Each rig is configured in a &quot;sail plan&quot;, appropriate to the size of the sailing craft. Both square-rigged and fore-and-aft rigged vessels have been built with a wide range of configurations for single and multiple masts.

Types of sail that can be part of a sail plan can be broadly classed by how they are &quot;attached&quot; to the sailing craft:

* &quot;To a stay&quot; – Sails attached to stays, include jibs, which are attached to forestays and staysails, which are mounted on other stays (typically wire cable) that support other masts from the bow aft.
* &quot;To a mast&quot; – Fore-and-aft sails directly attached to the mast at the luff include gaff-rigged quadrilateral and Bermuda triangular sails.
* &quot;To a spar&quot; – Sails attached to a spar include both square sails and such fore-and-aft quadrilateral sails as lug rigs, junk and spritsails and such triangular sails as the lateen, and the crab claw.

=== Rigging ===

Sailing ships have &quot;standing rigging&quot; to support the masts and &quot;running rigging&quot; to raise the sails and control their ability to draw power from the wind. The running rigging has three main roles, to support the sail structure, to shape the sail and to adjust its angle to the wind. Square-rigged vessels require more controlling lines than fore-and-aft rigged ones.

==== Standing rigging ====
Sailing ships prior to the mid-19th century used wood masts with hemp-fiber standing rigging. As rigs became taller by the end of the 19th century, masts relied more heavily on successive spars, stepped one atop the other to form the whole, from bottom to top: the &quot;lower mast&quot;, &quot;top mast&quot;, and &quot;topgallant mast&quot;. This construction relied heavily on support by a complex array of stays and shrouds. Each stay in either the fore-and-aft or athwartships direction had a corresponding one in the opposite direction providing counter-tension. Fore-and-aft the system of tensioning started with the stays that were anchored in front each mast. Shrouds were tensioned by pairs of deadeyes, circular blocks that had the large-diameter line run around them, whilst multiple holes allowed smaller line—&quot;lanyard&quot;—to pass multiple times between the two and thereby allow tensioning of the shroud. After the mid-19th century square-rigged vessels were equipped with iron wire standing rigging, which was superseded with steel wire in the late 19th century.

==== Running rigging ====
Halyards, used to raise and lower the yards, are the primary supporting lines. In addition, square rigs have lines that lift the sail or the yard from which it is suspended that include: brails, buntlines, lifts and leechlines. Bowlines and clew lines shape a square sail. To adjust the angle of the sail to wind braces are used to adjust the fore and aft angle of a yard of a square sail, while sheets attach to the clews (bottom corners) of a sail to control the sail&#x27;s angle to the wind. Sheets run aft, whereas tacks are used to haul the clew of a square sail forward.

== Crew ==

The crew of a sailing ship is divided between officers (the captain and his subordinates) and seamen or &quot;ordinary&quot; &quot;hands&quot;. An able seaman was expected to &quot;hand, reef, and steer&quot; (handle the lines and other equipment, reef the sails, and steer the vessel). The crew is organized to stand watch—the oversight of the ship for a period—typically four hours each. Richard Henry Dana Jr. and Herman Melville each had personal experience aboard sailing vessels of the 19th century.

===Merchant vessel===
Dana described the crew of the merchant brig, &quot;Pilgrim&quot;, as comprising six to eight common sailors, four specialist crew members (the steward, cook, carpenter and sailmaker), and three officers: the captain, the first mate and the second mate. He contrasted the American crew complement with that of other nations on whose similarly sized ships the crew might number as many as 30. Larger merchant vessels had larger crews.

===Warship===
Melville described the crew complement of the frigate warship, &quot;United States&quot;, as about 500—including officers, enlisted personnel and 50 Marines. The crew was divided into the starboard and larboard watches. It was also divided into three &quot;tops&quot;, bands of crew responsible for setting sails on the three masts; a band of &quot;sheet-anchor men&quot;, whose station was forward and whose job was to tend the fore-yard, anchors and forward sails; the &quot;after guard&quot;, who were stationed aft and tended the mainsail, spanker and manned the various sheets, controlling the position of the sails; the &quot;waisters&quot;, who were stationed midships and had menial duties attending the livestock, etc.; and the &quot;holders&quot;, who occupied the lower decks of the vessel and were responsible for the inner workings of the ship. He additionally named such positions as, boatswains, gunners, carpenters, coopers, painters, tinkers, stewards, cooks and various boys as functions on the man-of-war. 18-19th century ships of the line had a complement as high as 850.

== Ship handling ==

Handling a sailing ship requires management of its sails to power—but not overpower—the ship and navigation to guide the ship, both at sea and in and out of harbors.

===Under sail===
Key elements of sailing a ship are setting the right amount of sail to generate maximum power without endangering the ship, adjusting the sails to the wind direction on the course sailed, and changing tack to bring the wind from one side of the vessel to the other.

==== Setting sail ====
A sailing ship crew manages the running rigging of each square sail. Each sail has two sheets that control its lower corners, two braces that control the angle of the yard, two clewlines, four buntlines and two reef tackles. All these lines must be manned as the sail is deployed and the yard raised. They use a halyard to raise each yard and its sail; then they pull or ease the braces to set the angle of the yard across the vessel; they pull on sheets to haul lower corners of the sail, &quot;clews&quot;, out to yard below. Under way, the crew manages &quot;reef tackles&quot;, &quot;haul leeches&quot;, &quot;reef points&quot;, to manage the size and angle of the sail; &quot;bowlines&quot; pull the leading edge of the sail (&quot;leech&quot;) taut when close hauled. When furling the sail, the crew uses &quot;clewlines&quot;, haul up the clews and &quot;buntlines&quot; to haul up the middle of sail up; when lowered, &quot;lifts&quot; support each yard.

In strong winds, the crew is directed to reduce the number of sails or, alternatively, the amount of each given sail that is presented to the wind by a process called &quot;reefing&quot;. To pull the sail up, seamen on the yardarm pull on &quot;reef tackles&quot;, attached to &quot;reef cringles&quot;, to pull the sail up and secure it with lines, called &quot;reef points&quot;. Dana spoke of the hardships of sail handling during high wind and rain or with ice covering the ship and its rigging.

==== Changing tack ====

Sailing vessels cannot sail directly into the wind. Instead, square-riggers must sail a course that is between 60° and 70° away from the wind direction and fore-and aft vessels can typically sail no closer than 45°. To reach a destination, sailing vessels may have to change course and allow the wind to come from the opposite side in a procedure, called &quot;tacking&quot;, when the wind comes across the bow during the maneuver.

When tacking, a square-rigged vessel&#x27;s sails must be presented squarely to the wind and thus impede forward motion as they are swung around via the yardarms through the wind as controlled by the vessel&#x27;s running rigging, using braces—adjusting the fore and aft angle of each yardarm around the mast—and sheets attached to the clews (bottom corners) of each sail to control the sail&#x27;s angle to the wind. The procedure is to turn the vessel into the wind with the hind-most fore-and-aft sail (the spanker), pulled to windward to help turn the ship through the eye of the wind. Once the ship has come about, all the sails are adjusted to align properly with the new tack. Because square-rigger masts are more strongly braced from behind than from ahead, tacking is a dangerous procedure in strong winds; the ship may lose forward momentum (become &quot;caught in stays&quot;) and the rigging may fail from the wind coming from ahead. The ship may also lose momentum at wind speeds of less than . Under these conditions, the choice may be to &quot;wear ship&quot;—to turn the ship away from the wind and around 240° onto the next tack (60° off the wind).

A fore-and-aft rig permits the wind to flow past the sail, as the craft head through the eye of the wind. Most rigs pivot around a stay or the mast, while this occurs. For a jib, the old leeward sheet is released as the craft heads through the wind and the old windward sheet is tightened as the new leeward sheet to allow the sail to draw wind. Mainsails are often self-tending and slide on a traveler to the opposite side. On certain rigs, such as lateens and luggers, the sail may be partially lowered to bring it to the opposite side.

=== Navigation ===
Early navigational techniques employed observations of the sun, stars, waves and birdlife. In the 15th century, the Chinese were using the magnetic compass to identify direction of travel. By the 16th century in Europe, navigational instruments included the quadrant, the astrolabe, cross staff, dividers and compass. By the time of the Age of Exploration these tools were being used in combination with a log to measure speed, a lead line to measure soundings, and a lookout to identify potential hazards. Later, an accurate marine sextant became standard for determining latitude and was used with an accurate chronometer to calculate longitude.

Passage planning begins with laying out a route along a chart, which comprises a series of courses between fixes—verifiable locations that confirm the actual track of the ship on the ocean. Once a course has been set, the person at the helm attempts to follow its direction with reference to the compass. The navigator notes the time and speed at each fix to estimate the arrival at the next fix, a process called dead reckoning. For coast-wise navigation, sightings from known landmarks or navigational aids may be used to establish fixes, a process called pilotage. At sea, sailing ships used celestial navigation on a daily schedule, as follows:
# Continuous dead reckoning plot
# Star observations at morning twilight for a celestial fix
# Morning Sun observation to determine compass error by azimuth observation of the Sun
# Noontime observation of the Sun for noon latitude line for determination the day&#x27;s run and day&#x27;s set and drift
# Afternoon sun line to determine compass error by azimuth observation of the Sun
# Star observations at evening twilight for a celestial fix
Fixes were taken with a marine sextant, which measures the distance of the celestial body above the horizon.

=== Entering and leaving harbor ===
Given the limited maneuverability of sailing ships, it could be difficult to enter and leave harbor with the presence of a tide without coordinating arrivals with a flooding tide and departures with an ebbing tide. In harbor, a sailing ship stood at anchor, unless it needed to be loaded or unloaded at a dock or pier, in which case it might be warped alongside or towed by a tug. Warping involved using a long rope (the warp) between the ship and a fixed point on the shore. This was pulled on by a capstan on shore, or on the ship. This might be a multi-stage process if the route was not simple. If no fixed point was available, a kedge anchor might be taken out in a ship&#x27;s boat to a suitable point and the ship then pulled up to the kedge. Square rigged vessels could use backing and filling (of the sails) to manoeuvre in a tideway, or control could be maintained by drudging the anchor - lower the anchor until it touches the bottom so that the dragging anchor gives steerage way in the flow of the tide.

<text>A sailboat or sailing boat is a boat propelled partly or entirely by sails and is smaller than a sailing ship. Distinctions in what constitutes a sailing boat and ship vary by region and maritime culture.

==Types==
Although sailboat terminology has varied across history, many terms have specific meanings in the context of modern yachting. A great number of sailboat-types may be distinguished by size, hull configuration, keel type, purpose, number and configuration of masts, and sail plan.

Popular monohull designs include:

===Cutter===

The cutter is similar to a sloop with a single mast and mainsail, but generally carries the mast further aft to allow for two foresails, a jib and staysail, to be attached to the head stay and inner forestay, respectively. Once a common racing configuration, today it gives versatility to cruising boats, especially in allowing a small staysail to be flown from the inner stay in high winds.

===Catboat===

A catboat has a single mast mounted far forward and does not carry a jib. Most modern designs have only one sail, the mainsail; however, the traditional catboat could carry multiple sails from the gaff rig. Catboat is a charming and distinctive sailboat featuring a single mast with a single large sail, known as a gaff-rigged sail, and a broad beam that ensures stability. This type of vessel, named after the &quot;cat&quot; tackle used in sailing, has a rich history dating back to the 19th century in the coastal regions of the United States, particularly New England, where it was widely used by fishermen and sailors. With its straightforward design and uncomplicated rigging, the catboat offers a straightforward and laid-back sailing experience, making it an ideal choice for beginners and pleasure sailors alike. Even today, catboats continue to be cherished by enthusiasts who appreciate their heritage and enjoy their picturesque appearance while cruising through the waterways.

===Dinghy===

A dinghy is a type of small open sailboat commonly used for recreation, sail training, and tending a larger vessel. They are popular in youth sailing programs for their short LOA, simple operation and minimal maintenance. They have three (or fewer) sails: the mainsail, jib, and spinnaker.

===Ketch===

Ketches are similar to a sloop, but there is a second shorter mast astern of the mainmast, but forward of the rudder post. The second mast is called the mizzen mast and the sail is called the mizzen sail. A ketch can also be Cutter-rigged with two head sails.

===Schooner===

A schooner has a mainmast taller than its foremast, distinguishing it from a ketch or a yawl. A schooner can have more than two masts, with the foremast always lower than the foremost main. Traditional topsail schooners have topmasts allowing triangular topsails sails to be flown above their gaff sails; many modern schooners are Bermuda rigged.

===Sloop===


The most common modern sailboat is the sloop, which features one mast and two sails, typically a Bermuda rigged main, and a headsail. This simple configuration is very efficient for sailing into the wind.

A fractional rigged sloop has its forestay attached at a point below the top of the mast, allowing the mainsail to be flattened to improve performance by raking the upper part of the mast aft by tensioning the backstay. A smaller headsail is easier for a short-handed crew to manage.

===Yawl===

A yawl is similar to a ketch, with a shorter mizzen mast carried astern the rudderpost more for balancing the helm than propulsion.

==Hulls==

Traditional sailboats are monohulls, but multi-hull catamarans and trimarans are gaining popularity. Monohull boats generally rely on ballast for stability and usually are displacement hulls. This stabilizing ballast can, in boats designed for racing, be as much as 50% of the weight of the boat, but is generally around 30%. It creates two problems; one, it gives the monohull tremendous inertia, making it less maneuverable and reducing its acceleration. Secondly, unless it has been built with buoyant foam or air tanks, if a monohull fills with water, it will sink.

Multihulls rely on the geometry and the broad stance of their multiple hulls for their stability, eschewing any form of ballast. Some multihulls are designed to be as light-weight as possible while still maintaining structural integrity. They can be built with foam-filled flotation chambers and some modern trimarans are rated as unsinkable, meaning that, should every crew compartment be completely filled with water, the hull itself has sufficient buoyancy to remain afloat.

A multihull optimized for light weight (at the expense of cruising amenities and storage for food and other supplies), combined with the absence of ballast can result in performance gains in terms of acceleration, top speed, and manoeuvrability.

The lack of ballast makes it much easier to get a lightweight multihull on plane, reducing its wetted surface area and thus its drag. Reduced overall weight means a reduced draft, with a much reduced underwater profile. This, in turn, results directly in reduced wetted surface area and drag. Without a ballast keel, multihulls can go in shallow waters where monohulls can not.

There are trade-offs, however, in multihull design. A well designed ballasted boat can recover from a capsize, even from turning over completely. Righting a multihull that has gotten upside down is difficult in any case and impossible without help unless the boat is small or carries special equipment for the purpose. Multihulls often prove more difficult to tack, since the reduced weight leads directly to reduced momentum, causing multihulls to more quickly lose speed when headed into the wind. Also, structural integrity is much easier to achieve in a one piece monohull than in a two or three piece multihull whose connecting structure must be substantial and well connected to the hulls.

All these hull types may also be manufactured as, or outfitted with, hydrofoils.

==Keel==
All vessels have a keel, it is the backbone of the hull. In traditional construction, it is the structure upon which all else depends. Modern monocoque designs include a virtual keel. Even multihulls have keels. On a sailboat, the word &quot;keel&quot; is also used to refer to the area that is added to the hull to improve its lateral plane. The lateral plane is what prevents leeway and allows sailing towards the wind. This can be an external piece or a part of the hull.

Most monohulls larger than a dinghy require built-in ballast. Depending on the design of the boat, ballast may be 20 to 50 percent of the displacement. The ballast is often integrated into their keels as large masses of lead or cast iron. This secures the ballast and gets it as low as possible to improve its effectiveness. External keels are cast in the shape of the keel. A monohull&#x27;s keel is made effective by a combination of weight, depth, and length.
Most modern monohull boats have fin keels, which are heavy and deep, but short in relation to the hull length. More traditional yachts carried a full keel which is generally half or more of the length of the boat. A recent feature is a winged keel, which is short and shallow, but carries a lot of weight in two &quot;wings&quot; which run sideways from the main part of the keel. Even more recent is the concept of canting keels, designed to move the weight at the bottom of a sailboat to the upwind side, allowing the boat to carry more sails. A twin keel has the benefit of a shallower draft and can allow the boat to stand on dry land.

Multihulls, on the other hand, have minimal need for such ballast, as they depend on the geometry of their design, the wide base of their multiple hulls, for their stability. Designers of performance multihulls, such as the Open 60&#x27;s, go to great lengths to reduce overall boat weight as much as possible. This leads some to comment that designing a multihull is similar to designing an aircraft.

A centreboard or daggerboard is retractable lightweight keel which can be pulled up in shallow water.

==Mast==
On small sailboats, masts may be &quot;stepped&quot; (put in place) with the bottom end in a receptacle that is supported above the keel of the boat or on the deck or other superstructure that allows the mast to be raised at a hinge point until it is erect. Some masts are supported solely at the keel and laterally at the deck and are called &quot;unstayed&quot;. Most masts rely in part or entirely (for those stepped on the deck) on standing rigging, supporting them side-to-side and fore-and aft to hold them up. Masts over may require a crane and are typically stepped on the keel through any cabin or other superstructure.

==Auxiliary propulsion==
Many sailboats have an alternate means of propulsion, in case the wind dies or where close maneuvering under sail is impractical. The smallest boats may use a paddle; bigger ones may have oars; still others may employ an outboard motor, mounted on the transom; still others may have an inboard engine.

<doc id="67794" wikidata="Q800081" url="?curid=67794" title="Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1973">
<text>The Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1973 (Public Law 93–87; 87 Stat. 250) is legislation enacted by the United States Congress and signed into law on August 13, 1973, which provided funding for existing interstate and new urban and rural primary and secondary roads in the United States. It also funded a highway safety improvement program, and permitted states for the first time in U.S. history to use Highway Trust Fund money for mass transit. The law also established the first national speed limit (of ).

==Legislative history==
Beginning in 1964, Congress passed a new highway aid act every two years, authorizing new expenditures and making changes to federal highway policies.

The Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1968 and the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1970 had authorized states to issue contracts for construction of the Interstate Highway System and urban and rural primary and secondary roads through June 30, 1974. It also provided funds for these contracts. Congress again attempted to pass legislation (the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1972) in 1972. However, the bill died after a House–Senate conference committee was unable to agree whether to allow Highway Trust Funds to be used for mass transit. Another controversial issue was whether to require the District of Columbia to build the controversial Three Sisters Bridge.

Two important personnel changes occurred in the House after the failure of this legislation. Federal elections for the House and Senate were held in November 1972. First, Democratic Representative William M. Colmer declined to run for office again. He was replaced as chair of the House Rules Committee by the much more liberal Democratic Representative Ray Madden. Second, the death of Democratic Representative Hale Boggs, the House Majority Leader, in a plane crash in Alaska on October 16, 1972, elevated Thomas P. &quot;Tip&quot; O&#x27;Neill to that position when the new 93rd Congress convened in January 1973.

===Congressional action===
With federal highway aid to the state scheduled to run out on June 30, 1973, work on a new highway bill began almost immediately in the new Congress.

In the Senate, mass transit advocates won a major victory. On March 14, the Senate voted to give states the authority to use up to $850 million of Highway Trust Fund money in both 1973 and 1974 for the expansion or construction of mass transit. The vote was a close 49-to-44. The Senate bill also proposed spending $18 billion on highway and mass transit over three years, and included no money for highway safety or design improvement programs.

There was weaker support for mass transit spending in the House, however. In 1972, Representative Colmer had used his role as chair of the Rules Committee to block any floor amendments aimed at adding mass transit spending to the 1972 highway bill. But Colmer was gone, and Representative Madden was much more willing to allow changes to the bill to be made on the House floor. Few expected transit spending authorization to come from the House Public Works Committee, however. The committee was populated primarily by members of Congress from rural areas who wanted to expend money on highways and were not willing to devote funds to the construction of mass transit (which benefitted only cities). But there was much stronger support for mass transit spending in the House as a whole. Furthermore, the new Majority Leader, Tip O&#x27;Neill, was a strong supporter of mass transit, and Speaker of the House Carl Albert was willing to allow floor amendments on mass transit.

To help reduce the chances that members of the full House would drastically amend the legislation, for the first time in years the Public Works Committee voted on major provisions of the highway bill in open public session. Representative Glenn M. Anderson, Democrat from California, offered an amendment in committee to allow cities to use their $700-million per year share of funding for urban highways on mass transit. His motion was defeated. However, Texas Democrat Jim Wright offered an amendment which was successful: Cities awarded urban highway funds could cancel these highways and return the money to the Highway Trust Fund. They could then apply to the United States Treasury for an equal amount in general federal revenues (if available). Wright&#x27;s amendment also permitted states to cancel non-critical interstate highway projects as well, return the funds, and receive general federal revenues in return.

The Public Works Committee reported its bill on April 5, 1973. The committee bill added to the Interstate Highway System. For the first time in many years, the bill did not contain very much language earmarking funds for or requiring states to build specific construction projects. It did contain, however, provisions requiring the Department of Transportation (DOT) to establish a program on highway safety research and design improvement. The total cost of the bill was $25.9 billion over three years.

Anderson submitted his mass transit amendment when the Public Works bill came up on the floor of the full House of Representatives in late April 1973. The House defeated his amendment by just 25 votes.

===The contentious conference committee===
A conference committee was appointed by the House and Senate in early June 1973 to reconcile the two pieces of legislation. The committee almost immediately deadlocked over the mass transit issue. Members of the Senate said states should be permitted to make up their own minds about transportation spending, while House members accused the Senate of &quot;raiding&quot; the Highway Trust Fund. While all of the Senate conferees were in favor of using highway funds for mass transit, only two of the nine House members supported this plan. Senate conferees offered a compromise, based on suggestions made by President Richard Nixon and Representative Donald H. Clausen (a Republican from California). Under this scheme, up to 20 percent of the highway trust funds raised by each state could be used either for highways or for mass transit (up to a total national limit of $800 million a year). Another $588 million would be earmarked for spending on urban highways. To pay for the mass transit program, $800 million in spending would be cut from the urban and rural primary and secondary road building program. The House conferees rejected the proposal by a vote of 5-to-4 (with one Democrat voting with the Republicans).

On other issues, the conferees were able to come to agreement much more easily. Although the House bill projected spending of $9 billion a year over three years and the Senate $7 billion a year over three years, but both sides agreed to cut spending down to $5 billion or $6 billion a year over three years. The Senate also agreed to ease requirements that states meet certain civil rights and environmental standards, which would allow a number of highway construction projects which had been held up to move forward.

After two and a half weeks of negotiations, the conference committee was still deadlocked. Pressure was mounting on the House conferees, however. Some states were due to run out of highway construction funds on June 30, and the construction industry was pressing the House conferees to give way on the mass transit issue. Furthermore, the 1973 oil crisis was just beginning, causing a shortage of gasoline in the United States. The gas shortage also put pressure on the House conferees to approve funding for mass transit.

With the conference committee unable to report a bill, the Senate passed a continuing resolution on June 25 which would continue to fund highway construction in 30 states for four more months at 1970 levels. The House was reluctant to agree to such a measure, since it would only lead to higher pressure over time for a compromise on the mass transit issue. But with states running out of money, the House passed by voice vote a $1.5 billion highway aid continuing resolution.

The conference committee reached agreement on the mass transit issue on July 19, 1973. The key negotiators were Representative Jim Wright and Senator Lloyd Bentsen, both of Texas. The conference committee bill allowed states to use up to $200 million of fiscal year 1975&#x27;s $800 million urban highway appropriation to purchases mass transit buses. In fiscal year 1976, states could divert up to the entire $800 million urban highway appropriation to mass transit (which now included not only buses but also rolling stock as well as rail construction). The conferees also agreed to bar states from canceling sections of their planned interstates to use the money for mass transit. Some issues were still unresolved, however. Conferees had not yet reached agreement on whether states could use highway trust funds for rail operations, whether to give precedence to funding for roads which connected with the interstates, or whether to include a highway safety program in the highway aid bill or pass it as a stand-alone bill. The issue of whether to expand the Interstate Highway System was also outstanding.

A final Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1973 was reported out of conference committee on July 20. The conference committee had met 29 times over two months, an exceptionally high number of meetings and long period of time. On August 1, the Senate approved the conference report by a vote of 95-to-1. The House followed suit by voice vote on August 3.

The highway bill proved acceptable to President Nixon, and he signed the bill into law on August 13, 1973.

==About the act==
The legislation reauthorized the Federal-Aid Highway Act through the end of fiscal year 1976 (September 30, 1976). Appropriations were made for interstate highway construction through fiscal year 1979 (September 30, 1979).

The total cost of the legislation was $20 billion over fiscal years 1974, 1975, and 1976. The act included the following funding provisions:
*Interstate highway system: $9.75 billion was appropriated for interstate highway construction in fiscal years 1977, 1978, and 1979. Funds for urban interstate construction were permitted to be transferred elsewhere in-state for the construction of non-interstate roads. Interstate highway construction funds were also permitted to be used to construct fringe and corridor parking, preferential bus lanes, or other minor facilities for mass transit on interstates. The law required all interstate construction to be scheduled by July 1, 1974.
*Urban highway construction: $780 million was appropriated in fiscal year 1974, and $800 million per year in fiscal years 1975 and 1976.
*Urban primary and secondary road construction: For urban primary and secondary road construction, $290 million was appropriated in fiscal year 1974, and $300 million per year in fiscal years 1975 and 1976. Priority was given to primary urban roads connecting to interstate highways. No mileage minimums or caps were specified for these connector roads.
*Rural primary road construction: $680 million was appropriated in fiscal year 1974, and $700 million per year in fiscal years 1975 and 1976.
*Rural secondary road construction: $390 million was appropriated in fiscal year 1974, and $400 million per year in fiscal years 1975 and 1976.
*Mass transit: In fiscal year 1974, states may cancel highway construction projects and return the money to the Highway Trust Fund. They may then apply for and receive the same amount in general federal revenues, and expend the money on mass transit. In fiscal year 1975, states may apply to use up to $200 million of the $800 million appropriation for the national urban highway program to purchase buses. In fiscal year 1976, states may apply to use up to all of the $800 million appropriation for the national urban highway program to construction subways, commuter rail, or light rail, or to purchase rolling stock for the same. States must contribute $1 in spending for every $9 of federal money spent. States were permitted to issue contracts for future mass transit capital improvement construction up to $3 billion. (However, there was a carryover of $3.1 billion from the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964, so total construction authority was $6.1 billion.)
*Highway safety: For improving railway-road crossings, and for a highway design improvement program within DOT, $455 million was appropriated in fiscal 1974, and $800 million per year in fiscal 1975 and 1976.

New programs established by the act included:
*Highway Safety Improvement: The act provided funding for capital improvements to roads that improved safety, such as guard rails or improved railway-road at-grade crossings. The act also required DOT to establish program of data collection, research, and demonstration programs to improve highway safety by improving highway construction standards. Additionally, DOT was authorized to pay for demonstration projects to determine the effectiveness of road surface marking. Finally, as part of the War on Drugs, DOT was required to study the effect of illegal drug use on traffic and driver safety. DOT was also required to study ways in which the mass media could be used to inform the public about the number and severity of highway accidents, and educate them about how to reduce highway accidents.
*Connector roads: A new program permitted states to seek federal funding to build roads (not to exceed in length) in high-traffic urban areas, so long as these roads connected with the Interstate Highway System. Funding for such roads was limited to $150 million in fiscal years 1974, 1975, and 1976.
*National Scenic Highways: Section 134(a) of the act authorized DOT to conduct a study examining the feasibility of establishing a national scenic highway system.

Specific projects required by the act, although far less numerous than in previous legislation, included:
*$10 million for a high-speed bus transportation program between Washington, D.C., and Dulles International Airport.
*A requirement that the state of Virginia issue a draft environmental impact statement regarding the construction of Interstate 66 by October 1, 1974.
*That the District of Columbia construct the Three Sisters Bridge over the Potomac River.

<text>The Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987 (Pub. L. 100–17, 101 Stat. 132) is a United States Act of Congress, containing in Title I, the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1987. 

==History==
The bill was introduced in House by Glenn Anderson (D-CA) on January 6, 1987. 
The bill nominally gave power to apportion money to the Secretary of Transportation. It also allowed states to raise the speed limit to on rural Interstate highways ( of the act, amending ).

It was followed by the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA). The local agencies (counties and cities) in California were assured that an equal or not less amount of monies will still be annually apportioned to the counties and cities as they received in 1990–91 under the Federal Highway Act of 1987 under the old Federal Aid Urban (FAU) and Federal Aid Secondary Program.
== Veto and Override ==
Ronald Reagan notably vetoed this bill, shortly after the Tower commission report on the Iran-Contra incident came out, and he attempted to use the veto override vote as a show of his continued strength and influence over the senate. His stated reason for the override was an excess of funds devoted to mass transit projects and funds for over 100 local transportation infrastructure projects included in the bill. His veto was overriden by a vote of 67-33, the smallest possible margin of victory for a veto override, which requires a 2/3rds vote.

<text>DivX is a brand of video codec products developed by DivX, LLC. There are three DivX codecs: the original MPEG-4 Part 2 DivX codec, the H.264/MPEG-4 AVC DivX Plus HD codec and the High Efficiency Video Coding DivX HEVC Ultra HD codec. The most recent version of the codec itself is version 6.9.2, which is several years old. New version numbers on the packages now reflect updates to the media player, converter, etc.

==History==

The &quot;DivX&quot; brand is distinct from &quot;DIVX&quot;, which is an obsolete video rental system. The winking emoticon in the early &quot;&quot; codec name was a tongue-in-cheek reference to the DIVX system. Although not created by them, the DivX company adopted the name of the popular codec. The company dropped the smiley and released DivX 4.0, which was actually the first DivX version to trademark the term &quot;DivX&quot;.

 (not DivX) 3.11 Alpha and later 3.xx versions refers to a hacked version of the Microsoft &quot;MPEG-4 Version 3&quot; video codec (not to be confused with MPEG-4 Part 3) from Windows Media Tools 4 codecs. The video codec, which was actually not MPEG-4 compliant, was extracted around 1998 by French hacker Jerome Rota (also known as Gej) at Montpellier. The Microsoft codec originally required that the compressed output be put in an ASF file. It was altered to allow other containers such as Audio Video Interleave (AVI). Rota hacked the Microsoft codec because newer versions of the Windows Media Player would not play his video portfolio and résumé that were encoded with it. Instead of re-encoding his portfolio, Rota and German hacker Max Morice decided to reverse engineer the codec, which &quot;took about a week&quot;.

In early 2000, Jordan Greenhall recruited Rota to form a company (originally called DivXNetworks, Inc., renamed to DivX, Inc. in 2005) to develop an MPEG-4 codec, from scratch, that would still be backward-compatible with the Microsoft MPEG-4 Version 3 format. This effort resulted first in the release of the &quot;OpenDivX&quot; codec and source code on 15 January 2001. OpenDivX was hosted as an open-source project on the Project Mayo web site hosted at projectmayo.com (the name comes from &quot;mayonnaise&quot;, because, according to Rota, DivX and mayonnaise are both &quot;French and very hard to make.&quot;). The company&#x27;s internal developers and some external developers worked jointly on OpenDivX for the next several months, but the project eventually stagnated.

In early 2001, DivX employee &quot;Sparky&quot; wrote a new and improved version of the codec&#x27;s encoding algorithm known as &quot;encore2&quot;. This code was included in the OpenDivX public source repository for a brief time, but then was abruptly removed. The explanation from DivX at the time was that &quot;the community really wants a Winamp, not a Linux.&quot; It was at this point that the project forked. That summer, Rota left the French Riviera and moved to San Diego &quot;with nothing but a pack of cigarettes&quot; where he and Greenhall founded what would eventually become DivX, Inc.

DivX took the encore2 code and developed it into DivX 4.0, initially released in July 2001. Other developers who had participated in OpenDivX took encore2 and started a new project—Xvid—that started with the same encoding core. DivX, Inc. has since continued to develop the DivX codec, releasing DivX 5.0 in March 2002. By the release of version 5.2.1 on 8 September 2004, the DivX codec was substantially feature-complete. Changes since then have tended to focus on speed, and encouraging wider hardware player support, while the company has also focused its time on the formats and next generation codecs.

In February 2011, DivX was acquired by Rovi Corporation, upon completion of its acquisition of Sonic Solutions. In 2014, Blackstone Group and Parallax Capital acquired DivX from Rovi for $75 million. On January 5, 2015, it was announced that IPTV company NeuLion would acquire DivX for $62.5 million. In February 2018, a deal was finalized to sell certain DivX assets, intellectual property and subsidiaries from NeuLion, Inc. to Fortress Investment Group.

DivX, LLC continues to operate from their headquarters in San Diego and release new versions of DivX Software for Windows and macOS.

==DivX formats==

===DivX Media Format (DMF)===

DivX 6 expanded the scope of DivX from including just a codec and a player by adding an optional media container format called &quot;DivX Media Format&quot; (&quot;DMF&quot;) (with a .divx extension) that includes support for the following DVD-Video and VOB container like features. This media container format is used for the MPEG-4 Part 2 codec.

This new DivX Media Format also came with a &quot;DivX Ultra Certified&quot; profile, and all &quot;Ultra&quot; certified players must support all DivX Media Format features. While video encoded with the DivX codec is an MPEG-4 video stream, the DivX Media Format is analogous to media container formats such as Apple&#x27;s QuickTime. In much the same way that media formats such as DVD specify MPEG-2 video as a part of their specification, the DivX Media Format specifies MPEG-4-compatible video as a part of its specification. However, despite the use of the &quot;.divx&quot; extension, this format is an extension to the AVI file format. The methods of including multiple audio and even subtitle tracks involve storing the data in RIFF headers and other such AVI hacks which have been known for quite a while, such that even VirtualDubMod supports them. DivX, Inc. did this on purpose to keep at least partial backward compatibility with AVI, so that players that do not support the new features available to the .divx container format (like interactive menus, chapter points and XSUB subtitles) can at least play that primary video stream (usually the main movie if the DMF file contains multiple video streams like special features like bonus materials). Of course, the DivX codec and tools like Dr. DivX still support the traditional method of creating standard AVI files.

Since version 5.0 of DivX, the FourCC (identifying code) for the DivX MPEG-4 Part 2 codec is DX50. Previously it used DIVX.

===DivX Plus HD===

DivX Plus HD is a marketing name for a file type using the standard Matroska media container format (.mkv), rather than the proprietary DivX Media Format. DivX Plus HD files contain an H.264 video bitstream, AAC surround sound audio, and a number of XML-based attachments defining chapters, subtitles and meta data. This media container format is used for the H.264/MPEG-4 AVC codec.

===DivX profiles===

DivX has defined profiles which are subsets of MPEG-4/AVI and H.264/Matroska standards. Because the grouping is a specific subset of what is in the standards, there are certification processes for each of the profiles that device manufacturers must follow. All DivX certified devices bearing a DivX logo will adhere to one of the profiles outlined in the table below as would any tools that support the DivX profiles.
===DivX Video on Demand===
DivX Video on Demand (DivX VOD) is DivX&#x27;s version of digital rights management (DRM), which allows content copyright holders to control distribution. In 2009, DivX, Inc. received format approval from major Hollywood studios including Sony, Paramount, and Lionsgate, which has allowed content retailers to sell protected videos that will play on current and previous generations of DivX certified devices. The terms of the contract are not known, so it is unknown if that approval is still in effect.

==Community software==

&quot;Dr. DivX OSS&quot; is capable of transcoding many video formats to DivX-encoded video. The original closed-source Dr. DivX terminated at version 1.06 for DivX 5.21. That was the last version of DivX capable of running on Windows 9x. An open-source version has since been made, which supports DivX 6. &quot;Dr. DivX&quot; offers greatly expanded features over the free DivX Converter application, that was bundled with the codec from version 6 onwards. Dr. DivX is not compatible with DivX Plus HD.

DivX has released a command line interface (CLI) for the codice_1 encoder used in the DivX Converter as beta, free for non-commercial use. To complement the CLI codice_1 encoder released on DivX Labs, DivX has also released a DivX AAC encoder CLI as a Windows beta binary. Finally, codice_3 has been released as a free Windows CLI through DivX Labs with documentation on the DivX Developer Portal; DivX describes the release as a reference mux to demonstrate DivX Plus MKV extensions like World Fonts and Smooth FF/RW.

==Hardware support==
DivX, Inc. markets a certification program to consumer electronics and IC manufacturers for the purpose of guaranteed compatibility and playback of video files that fall within DivX profiles. Devices that have been DivX certified usually brandish one of the following marks:
* DivX Certified
* DivX Certified for HD 720p and 1080p
* DivX Certified for DivX Plus HD
* DivX Connected
* DivX Certified for DivX Ultra

DivX certified devices have included DVD players, car stereos, mobile phones, televisions, Blu-ray players, and even alarm clocks.

Aside from verifying proper decoding of files conforming to the DivX profiles the certification also confirms the device can play back DivX Video on Demand content, which includes Hollywood content that can be purchased from Internet retailers.

===Gaming system compatibility===
On 4 December 2007, native MPEG-4 ASP playback support was added to the Xbox 360, allowing it to play video encoded with DivX and other MPEG-4 ASP codecs.

On 17 December 2007, firmware upgrade 2.10 was released for the Sony PlayStation 3, which included official DivX Certification. Firmware version 2.50 (released on 15 October 2008) included support for the DivX Video on Demand (DivX VOD) service, and firmware version 2.60 (released on 20 January 2009) included official DivX Certification and updated Profile support to version 3.11.

With introduction of DivX to Go in the DivX Player for Windows, a PlayStation 3 icon is readily available on the interface, which will invoke a transfer wizard for freely converting and copying video files via USB or optical disc. The output from DivX to Go&#x27;s PlayStation 3 preset is also playable on the Xbox 360.

<text>3ivx ( ) was an MPEG-4 compliant video codec suite, created by 3ivx Technologies, based in Sydney, Australia. 3ivx video codecs were released from 2001 to 2012, with releases of related technologies continuing until 2015. 3ivx provided plugins to allow the MPEG-4 data stream to be wrapped by the Microsoft ASF and AVI transports, as well as Apple&#x27;s QuickTime transport. It also allowed the creation of elementary MP4 data streams combined with AAC audio streams. It only supported MPEG-4 Part 2, it did not support H.264 video (MPEG-4 Part 10).

Official decoders and encoders were provided for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS, BeOS, Amiga and Linux. In addition, FFmpeg can decode 3ivx encoded video.

The company was notable for its support of the Haiku OS, providing a port of the 3ivx codec. The 3ivx port maintainer also produced a QuickTime MOV extractor and an MPEG-4 extractor for Haiku.

3ivx developed an HTTP Live Streaming Client SDK for Windows 8 and Windows 8 Phones for the playback of HLS content on in Windows 8 Modern UI apps.

As of 2019, the 3ivx codec was no longer available for purchase from their website.

<text>Percy Alfred Williams (May 19, 1908 – November 29, 1982) was a Canadian athlete, winner of the 100 and 200 metres races at the 1928 Summer Olympics and a former world record holder for the 100 metres sprint.

==Early life==
Williams was the only child of Frederick Williams, who was originally from England, and Charlotte Rhodes, who hailed from St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland. At the age of 15, Williams suffered from rheumatic fever and was advised to avoid strenuous physical activities. However, as his high school required participation in athletic competitions, he started training in sprint in 1924 and by 1927 became a local champion.

==Olympic competition==

At the 1928 Olympic trials, Williams won the 100 and 200 metres races, equaling the Olympic 100 metres record of 10.6 seconds.

To earn his travel ticket for the trials, Williams and his volunteer coach, Bob Granger, worked as waiters and dishwashers in a railroad dining car, and Vancouver track fans raised the money to pay Granger&#x27;s transatlantic ship passage to the 1928 Olympics.

In the second round of the 100 metres at Amsterdam, Williams again equaled the Olympic record with a time of 10.6 seconds and did the same in his semi-final, but placed second to Bob McAllister. The final opened with two false starts, first by Wilfred Legg and then one by Frank Wykoff. Williams took the lead off the start and never relinquished it, winning the gold over Jack London with Georg Lammers third. Williams then won the 200 metres two days later, coming from behind to overtake Helmut Körnig, who had led out of the bend. It was Williams&#x27; eighth race in four days and he was the first non-American to complete the sprint double. Williams was also part of the Canadian team which was disqualified in the final of the 4×100 metre relay contest.

Williams&#x27;s victories were front-page news in Canada and he returned a national hero, feted by enormous crowds across the country. An estimated 25,000 people turned out to welcome him at the Canadian Pacific Railway station at the foot of Granville Street in Vancouver. Williams was met off the train by Mayor L. D. Taylor and Premier Simon Fraser Tolmie. They bundled him and Granger into cars and paraded them through the confetti-filled city. The event was broadcast live by reporters with microphones stationed along the route.

Williams showed that his success was not an accident, setting a World Record at the Canadian Track and Field Championships at Varsity Stadium in Toronto in 1930. He then won the 100 yard dash at the inaugural British Empire Games (now known as the Commonwealth Games) in Hamilton, Ontario, but tore the tendons in his upper left leg around the 70 yard mark and never made a full comeback. At the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, he was eliminated in the semi-finals of the 100 metre event. With the Canadian team he finished fourth in the 4×100 metre relay competition. Subsequently, Williams stopped running and became an insurance agent.

==Later life and death==
In August 1940, Williams joined the Non-Permanent Active Militia, his occupation listed as &quot;Salesman&quot; and religion as &quot;C of E&quot; (Church of England). He also served as a civilian pilot during World War II, ferrying aircraft around the country for Canadian Airways, then became a civilian flight instructor with the Royal Canadian Air Force.

In 1971, after his former mentor&#x27;s death, Williams was asked how much credit was due to Granger for his Olympic success. &quot;Offhand, I&#x27;d say 100 percent,&quot; Williams answered.

In the mid-1960s, he donated his two gold medals from the 1928 Olympics to the BC Sports Hall of Fame, saying he wanted them to be seen and remembered. In 1980, they were stolen never to be found again; gold prices at the time were at historic highs and it was suspected the medals had been melted down. It was said at that time Williams simply shrugged off the loss and no replacements were ever issued. In 2023 the stolen medals were replaced by newly minted replicas, recreated by the International Olympic Committee at the request of Williams family, who then rededicated them to B.C. Sports Hall of Fame.

In later years, Williams grew bitter about his sporting experiences, culminating in being the only living Canadian Olympic gold medalist who refused the federal government&#x27;s invitation to attend the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal.

In 1979, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada.

Williams, who never married, lived with his mother, Dot, until her death in 1980, at the age of 92. After that, he lived on alone and suffered from terrible arthritic pain.

A keen collector of guns, Williams shot himself in the head with a shotgun he had been awarded in 1928 as a prize for his Olympic feat. His suicide was a major surprise to everyone and no note was left. He was interred at Masonic Cemetery of British Columbia, Burnaby, Canada.

==Awards and recognition==

In 1950, Williams was proclaimed by a Canadian press poll as Canada&#x27;s greatest track athlete of the first half of the century, which was later updated in 1972 to declare him Canada&#x27;s all-time greatest Olympic athlete.

Percy Williams Junior Public School located in Toronto, Ontario, is named after Williams.

In 1996, Canada Post released a postage stamp of Percy Williams as part of its &quot;Sporting Heroes&quot; series.

Outside the BC Sports Hall of Fame at BC Place is a life-sized statue of Williams, crouched in a sprinter&#x27;s stance.

<doc id="67815" wikidata="Q1429535" url="?curid=67815" title="Full metal jacket (ammunition)">
<text>A full metal jacket (FMJ) bullet is a small-arms projectile consisting of a soft core (often lead) encased in an outer shell (&quot;jacket&quot;) of harder metal, such as gilding metal, cupronickel, or, less commonly, a steel alloy. A bullet jacket usually allows higher muzzle velocities than bare lead without depositing significant amounts of metal in the bore. It also prevents damage to bores from hard steel or armor-piercing core materials.

== History ==

Despite a widespread belief that the full metal jacket bullet was invented ca. 1882 by Swiss Colonel Eduard Rubin while he was working for the Swiss Federal Ammunition Factory and Research Center, in fact it was known already in the 1880s that the actual inventor was Prussian Major (later Lt.-Col.) (1835-1885), who came up with the idea either in 1875 or 1876.

The use of full metal jacketing in military ammunition came about in part because of the need for improved feeding characteristics in small arms that used internal mechanical manipulation of the cartridge in order to chamber rounds as opposed to externally hand-reloading single-shot firearms. The harder metal used in bullet jackets was less prone to deformation than softer exposed lead, which improved feeding. That also allowed bullets to withstand much higher velocities caused by the decrease of the caliber.

In addition to the various advantages afforded by FMJ rounds, the Hague Convention of 1899, Declaration III, prohibits the use in international warfare of bullets that easily expand or flatten in the body. Unjacketed lead bullets readily expand on impact, effectively mandating FMJ by international law.

== Impact characteristics ==
By design, fully jacketed projectiles have less capacity to expand after contact with the target than a hollow-point projectile or a soft-point projectile. While this can be an advantage when engaging targets behind cover, it can also be a disadvantage as an FMJ bullet may pierce completely through a target, leading to less severe wounding, and possibly failing to disable the target. Furthermore, a projectile that goes completely through a target can cause unintentional damage behind the target.

<text>Gilding metal is a form of brass (an alloy of copper and zinc) with a much higher copper content than zinc content. Exact figures range from 95% copper and 5% zinc to “8 parts copper to 1 of zinc” (11% zinc) in British Army Dress Regulations.

Gilding metal is used for various purposes, including the jackets of bullets, driving bands on some artillery shells, as well as enameled badges and other jewellery. The sheet is widely used for craft metalworking by hammer working. It is also used particularly as a lower-cost training material for silversmiths. Starting in 1944, shell casings made of gilding metal were melted down by the United States Mint to be made into pennies. These pennies replaced the less popular steel cent of 1943, and the pennies of this composition were produced until 1946.

Gilding metal was also used for the &quot;bronze&quot; Olympic medal at the 2020 Summer Olympics held in Tokyo, Japan in 2021.

Gilding metal may be annealed by heating to between . It should be cooled slowly afterwards, to reduce risk of cracking.

<doc id="67837" wikidata="Q346602" url="?curid=67837" title="Jim Hines">
<text>James Ray Hines (September 10, 1946 – June 3, 2023) was an American track and field athlete and National Football League (NFL) player, who held the 100-meter world record for 15 years. In 1968, he became the first man to officially break the 10-second barrier in the 100 meters, and won individual and relay gold at the Mexico City Olympics.

==Track career==

Born in Dumas, Arkansas, Hines was raised in Oakland, California, and graduated from McClymonds High School in 1964. He was a baseball player in his younger years until he was spotted by track coach Jim Coleman as a running talent, and Hines became a sprinter. At the 1968 U.S. national championships in Sacramento, California, Hines became the first man to break the ten second barrier in the 100-metre race, setting 9.9 (manual timing), with an electronic time of 10.03 – two other athletes, Ronnie Ray Smith behind him (electronic time 10.13) and Charles Greene on the other semi-final (electronic time 10.09) having the same official clocking. That evening of June 20, 1968, at Hughes Stadium has been dubbed by track and field historians as the &quot;Night of Speed&quot;. Hines attended Texas Southern University in Houston, Texas. He was a member of the Texas Southern University Tigers track team.

A few months later, at the 1968 Summer Olympics, Hines – a black athlete – found himself in a tense situation, with racial riots going on in his home country and a threat of a boycott by the black athletes of the U.S. team, who were disturbed by the controversial idea of admitting apartheid South Africa to the Games and revelations linking the head of the International Olympic Committee, Avery Brundage, to a racist and antisemitic country club. Hines reached the 100 m final, and won it with the time 9.89 appearing on the screen, later corrected to 9.95. The 9.89 was taken from a light beam across the finish line, while the official photographic process used Polaroid film and took a couple of minutes to process and read. There was some controversy over how his (slower appearing) automatic time of 9.95 should compare to the hand timed 9.9 world record (Hines was again recorded at 9.9 in his 9.95 race). Automatic times start instantly with the sound of the gun, while hand times include human reaction time to start the watch. It took until 1977 before fully automatic timing was required of world records. As the fastest electronic time to that point, Hines&#x27; mark was recognized exclusively as a new world record. The race was also significant for being the third all-black podium in Olympic history. Hines helped break another world record, when he and his teammates sprinted to the 4 × 100 m relay gold at the same Games.

==Professional football career==
Hines was drafted by the Miami Dolphins of the NFL in the sixth round of the 1968 NFL/AFL draft. Hines spent the 1968 season on the Dolphins&#x27; practice squad. He was given the nickname &quot;Oops&quot;. He appeared in ten games with Miami in 1969, accumulating a total of 52 all-purpose yards. Hines&#x27; final professional game was his first and only game with the Kansas City Chiefs in 1970. Hines was ranked as the 10th-worst NFL player of all time by Deadspin writer Jeff Pearlman.

==Later years==
For years Hines worked with inner-city youth in Houston, as well as on oil rigs outside the city.

Hines&#x27;s world record remained unsurpassed until Calvin Smith ran a time of 9.93 in 1983.

Hines competed in the 100 at a 1984 Masters Track and Field Competition at UCLA.

Hines was inducted into the Texas Sports Hall of Fame, class of 1994. Hines was also inducted into the Texas Track and Field coaches Hall of Fame, class of 2016.

Hines died in Hayward, California, on June 3, 2023, at the age of 76.

<text>Harriet the Spy is a children&#x27;s novel written and illustrated by Louise Fitzhugh that was published in 1964. It has been called &quot;a milestone in children&#x27;s literature&quot; and a &quot;classic&quot;. In the U.S., it ranked number 12 in the 50 Best Books for Kids and number 17 in the Top 100 Children&#x27;s Novels on two lists generated in 2012.

It was followed by two &quot;companion books&quot;, the sequels, &quot;The Long Secret&quot; (1965) and &quot;Sport&quot; (1979), the latter of which was released posthumously after Fitzhugh&#x27;s death in 1974. A feature film based on the novel starring Michelle Trachtenberg was released by Nickelodeon Movies in 1996. A made-for-television sequel, &quot;Harriet the Spy: Blog Wars&quot;, aired in 2010. A television series based on the novel premiered on Apple TV+ in 2021.

==Plot summary==
Eleven-year-old Harriet M. Welsch is an aspiring writer who lives in New York City&#x27;s Upper East Side. Encouraged by her nanny, &quot;Ole Golly&quot;, Harriet observes others and writes her thoughts down in a notebook as practice for her future career. Several standalone episodes highlight the various eccentric characters she meets on her afternoon &quot;spy route&quot;.

Harriet&#x27;s best friends are Simon &quot;Sport&quot; Rocque, a serious boy who wants to be a certified public accountant or a ball player, and Janie Gibbs, who wants to be a scientist. Harriet&#x27;s enemies in her class are Marion Hawthorne, the teacher&#x27;s pet and self-appointed queen bee, and Marion&#x27;s best friend, Rachel Hennessy.

Harriet&#x27;s life changes abruptly when Ole Golly&#x27;s suitor, Mr. Waldenstein, proposes and she accepts. Harriet is crushed by the loss of her nanny. Her mother and father are at a loss to understand Harriet&#x27;s feelings and are of little comfort to her.

At school, during a game of tag, Harriet loses her notebook. Her classmates find it and are appalled at her brutally honest documentation of her opinions of them. The students form a &quot;Spy Catcher Club&quot; in which they think up ways to make Harriet&#x27;s life miserable, such as stealing her lunch and passing nasty notes about her in class. In return, Harriet regularly spies on the Spy Catcher Club through a back fence and concocts vengeful ways to punish them. After getting into trouble for carrying out some of her plans, Harriet unsuccessfully tries to resume her friendships with Sport and Janie as if nothing had ever happened. When Harriet&#x27;s grades go down, her parents confiscate her notebook, which only depresses her further.

Harriet&#x27;s mother takes her daughter to see a child psychiatrist, who advises Harriet&#x27;s parents to get in touch with Ole Golly and ask her to write to Harriet. In her letter, Ole Golly tells Harriet that &quot;if&quot; anyone ever reads her notebook, &quot;you have to do two things, and you are not going like either one of them. 1: You have to apologize. 2: You have to lie. Otherwise you are going to lose a friend.&quot;

Meanwhile, dissension is rippling through the Spy Catcher Club. Marion and Rachel are calling all the shots, and Sport and Janie are tired of being bossed around. When they quit the club, most of their classmates do the same.

Harriet&#x27;s parents speak with her teacher and the headmistress, and Harriet is appointed editor of the class newspaper, replacing Marion. The newspaper—featuring stories about the people on Harriet&#x27;s spy route and the students&#x27; parents—becomes an instant success. Harriet also uses the paper to print a retraction of the things she had written in her journal. Harriet is forgiven by Sport and Janie.

== Reception ==
The book appeared on a 1964 list of &quot;The Year&#x27;s Best Juveniles&quot; in &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;. One 1965 reviewer called the book &quot;a brilliantly written, unsparing realistic story, a superb portrait of an extraordinary child&quot;. Another reviewer found that it &quot;captures the feelings, thoughts and situations of a modern city child with remarkable clarity and dimension&quot;. Nevertheless, at least one reviewer in 1965 felt that the book dealt with &quot;disagreeable people and situations&quot;. Although it was not chosen as one of the American Library Association (ALA) Notable Books for Children for 1964, years later it was included in a retrospective 1960–1964 ALA Notable Books List.

It won a Sequoyah Book Award in 1967. The paperback version was selected as one of the &quot;Best in the Field&quot; published during the previous 16 months in a 1968 &quot;New York Times&quot; article. In 1995, Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon Movies claimed that 2.5 million copies of the book had been sold; however, the book did not appear on a 2001 &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; list of &quot;hardcovers that have sold 750,000 copies and paperbacks that have topped the one million copy mark.&quot;

Whitney Matheson wrote on the &quot;USA Today&quot; site in 2002 that Harriet &quot;attracts dedicated, lifelong supporters&quot;. Anita Silvey in 2004 selected it as one of the 100 best books for children. In 2005, the ex-CIA officer Lindsay Moran cited the &quot;Harriet the Spy&quot; series of books as an inspiration for her career. It was included in a 2009 list of &quot;Children’s Classics&quot; by &quot;The Horn Book Magazine&quot;.

In 2012, &quot;Harriet the Spy&quot; was ranked number 17 among all-time children&#x27;s novels in a survey published by &quot;School Library Journal&quot;. Earlier that year, &quot;Time Out New York Kids&quot; ranked it number 12 among the &quot;50 Best Books for Kids&quot;. Late in 2015, the same source ranked it number 34 in the &quot;73 best kids&#x27; books of all time for families&quot;.

Despite its popularity, the book has been banned from some schools and libraries &quot;because it was said to set a bad example for children&quot;. Along with &quot;Are You There God?&quot;, &quot;Blubber&quot;, and &quot;Where the Sidewalk Ends&quot;, the book was challenged at a 1983 school-board meeting in Xenia, Ohio. Proponents of the Xenia ban stated that the book &quot;teaches children to lie, spy, back-talk, and curse&quot;, but the board voted to keep the books in the school libraries.

== Series ==
Fitzhugh wrote two sequels to the book: &quot;The Long Secret&quot; (1965) and &quot;Sport&quot; (1979, published posthumously). Both books received mixed reviews.

&quot;Sport&quot; is a spin-off that focuses on Simon &quot;Sport&quot; Rocque, expanding upon his brief family background covered in &quot;Harriet the Spy&quot;. As his parents are divorced, Sport lives with his father, who is a struggling writer who has been focusing on a book (a big gamble) rather than the steady income of journal/newspaper articles, with Sport managing their finances. Their financial problems are exacerbated once Sport&#x27;s grandfather Simon Vane (from his mother&#x27;s side) becomes terminally ill and stops sending regular payments to Sport. Things change for the better once Sport&#x27;s father meets the kind Kate, who becomes a good stepmother. However, Simon&#x27;s will has named Sport as the main beneficiary to the $30 million family fortune, much to the chagrin of Sport&#x27;s mother Charlotte Vane and her sister. Charlotte, an absentee mother who has been living well abroad in Europe most of the time, returns to New York City upon hearing of her father&#x27;s illness, scheming to increase her share of Simon&#x27;s inheritance by kidnapping Sport and imprisoning him in the Plaza Hotel for a week.

In 2002, a sequel &quot;Harriet Spies Again&quot; appeared; written by Helen Ericson, it also received mixed reviews. Another sequel, &quot;Harriet the Spy, Double Agent&quot; by Maya Gold, was published in 2005; one review of that book stated &quot;there&#x27;s not much to interest readers here.&quot;

== Adaptations ==

Film rights to the novel were bought by Herbert Swope in 1964. &quot;Harriet the Spy&quot; was made into a 1996 film of the same name. It starred Michelle Trachtenberg and was the first film to be produced by Nickelodeon&#x27;s feature film division. 

In September 2004, Mainframe Entertainment announced that Protocol Entertainment will produce a new &quot;Harriet the Spy&quot; live-action television series, consisting of at least 22 half-hour episodes, with 2 Friends Entertainment acting as executive producers and US sales agent and Mainframe retaining international distribution rights.

In March 2010, Disney Channel aired a version of the story, &quot;Harriet the Spy: Blog Wars&quot;. This starred &quot;Wizards of Waverly Place&quot; cast member Jennifer Stone as Harriet, Alexander Conti from &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen 2&quot; as Harriet&#x27;s friend Sport, and &quot;&quot;″s Melinda Shankar as Janie. In this film, Harriet competes against Marion Hawthorne to see who has a better blog.

In August 2020, Apple TV+ announced it had given the production a series order for an animated television adaptation of the novel. The series was to be produced by The Jim Henson Company and Rehab Entertainment with Will McRobb as writer, Sidney Clifton as producer, and Terissa Kelton and John W. Hyde as executive producers, and starring Beanie Feldstein as Harriet, Jane Lynch as Ole Golly, and Lacey Chabert as Marion Hawthorne. The series was released on November 19, 2021.

<doc id="67840" wikidata="Q220174" url="?curid=67840" title="Zool">
<text>Zool: Ninja of the Nth Dimension is a platform video game developed and published by Gremlin Graphics. It was marketed as a rival to Sega&#x27;s &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;. Originally released for the Amiga home computer in October 1992, the game was subsequently ported to Sega Genesis, Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Master System, Game Boy and Game Gear, as well as other home computers. A sequel, &quot;Zool 2&quot;, was released in 1993. A remastered version of the original game, titled &quot;Zool Redimensioned&quot;, was developed by Sumo Digital Academy and published by 
Secret Mode for Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in August 2021.

==Gameplay==

The game is a platform game, relying on smooth, fast-moving gameplay. Its protagonist is Zool, a gremlin &quot;Ninja of the Nth Dimension&quot; who is forced to land on Earth; in order to gain ninja ranking, he has to pass seven lands, beating a boss at the end of each of them. The game contains a number of embedded minigames, including several arcade games, a scrolling space shooter and a game accessible only by making Zool play a certain tune on an in-game piano or finding certain invisible warp points.

==Development and release==
George Allan came up with the idea of &quot;Zool&quot; as he was criticized on his previous game &quot;Switchblade II&quot; for having a lack of enemies. In development, Zool could cast spells to get him out of trouble by collecting potions. For example, Zool could escape from pits with high jump spells and cast a shadow spell to make a clone of him that follows his actions (thus doubling the fire power). In the final version, the spells were replaced with collectible power-ups. The very early name for the project was &quot;Pootz&quot;. The soundtrack by Patrick Phelan overlaps with the &quot;Lotus 3&quot; soundtrack and inspired several modern electro/techno remixes. Candy company Chupa Chups sponsored the game&#x27;s production, with the company logo featured prominently within the game. The game was heavily hyped upon its initial release, including being bundled with the then-newly launched Amiga 1200, although not the AGA version with enhanced graphics which followed later. In 2000, the Amiga version of &quot;Zool&quot; was re-released as part of &quot;The Best of Gremlin&quot; compilation.

&quot;Zool&quot; was also ported to the Atari ST, Game Boy, Mega Drive/Genesis, SNES, Master System, Game Gear, Amiga CD32, IBM PC Compatibles, and RISC OS, as well as an arcade machine. The Amiga CD32 version has original red book audio tracks by Neil Biggin and has the option to have both sound effects and music. This and the Acorn Archimedes port are the only two incarnations of the original Amiga version to have this. For the Atari ST, the programmers and graphics artists choose to incorporate the redesigned sprites from their upcoming sequel &quot;Zool 2&quot; (in development at the time) to use for their star character on the Atari version to address the criticism that the original &quot;Zool&quot; character sprites were not cute enough. Most computer ports are close to the Amiga original but the Genesis and SNES ports both feature different levels which are structured differently, different background graphics, and unique bosses. The Sega Master System version features smaller, more scaled down stages and a more strict quota on collectible items, but also features unique gameplay moves like a wall climb. With the exception of the CD32 version, all console versions feature the soundtrack of the Amiga original, remixed appropriately for each console&#x27;s unique sound systems.

== Reception ==

The original Amiga game was released to critical acclaim,
receiving scores of 97%, 96%, 95% from &quot;Amiga Computing&quot;, &quot;Amiga Action&quot; and &quot;Amiga Format&quot; respectively. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; claimed that &quot;Zool&quot; sports great graphics, but the character moves too fast with little control. &quot;GamePro&quot; gave a positive review of the Game Gear version, praising its &quot;great graphics and sound abound&quot;, as well as its &quot;crisp&quot; gameplay. &quot;Power Unlimited&quot; gave the Game Boy version a score of 80% and the Sega Genesis version a score of 81%. The magazine was generally positive to the game, despite noting that the game did not add anything new in the platforming genre.

Retrospectively, &quot;Virgin Media&quot; included &quot;Zool&quot; on their list of top ten video game ninja heroes. In 2011, &quot;Wirtualna Polska&quot; ranked it as the 22nd best game for the Amiga, noting its &quot;absurdly&quot; high difficulty.

==Legacy==
Two children&#x27;s novels based on the games, entitled &quot;Cool Zool&quot; and &quot;Zool Rules&quot;, were released in February 1995. They were written by Stan Nicholls and Ian Edginton and published by Boxtree. &quot;The Game Maker&#x27;s Companion&quot; (APress, 2010), a book on hobbyist game development, contains step-by-step instructions on how to remake the original &quot;Zool&quot; game using GameMaker Studio.

A remastered version of the console version of &quot;Zool&quot;, titled &quot;Zool Redimensioned&quot;, was developed by Sumo Digital Academy and published by publisher Secret Mode for Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on August 18, 2021. The remake features modes for both modern and classic-style difficulty, challenges for each level, and a multiplayer party mode, as well as an emulated version of the Genesis version of the game. For legal reasons, references to the original game&#x27;s Chupa Chups sponsorship have been removed.

<text>An electronic color code or electronic colour code (see spelling differences) is used to indicate the values or ratings of electronic components, usually for resistors, but also for capacitors, inductors, diodes and others. A separate code, the 25-pair color code, is used to identify wires in some telecommunications cables. Different codes are used for wire leads on devices such as transformers or in building wiring.

==History==
Before industry standards were established, each manufacturer used its own unique system for color coding or marking their components.

In the 1920s, the RMA resistor color code was developed by the Radio Manufacturers Association (RMA) as a fixed resistor coloring code marking. In 1930, the first radios with RMA color-coded resistors were built. Over many decades, as the organization name changed (RMA, RTMA, RETMA, EIA) so was the name of the code. Though known most recently as EIA color code, the four name variations are found in books, magazines, catalogs, and other documents over more than years.

In 1952, it was standardized in IEC 62:1952 by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and since 1963 also published as EIA RS-279. Originally only meant to be used for fixed resistors, the color code was extended to also cover capacitors with IEC 62:1968. The code was adopted by many national standards like DIN 40825 (1973), BS 1852 (1974) and IS 8186 (1976). The current international standard defining marking codes for resistors and capacitors is IEC 60062:2016. In addition to the color code, these standards define a letter and digit code named RKM code for resistors and capacitors.

Color bands were used because they were easily and cheaply printed on tiny components. However, there were drawbacks, especially for color blind people. Overheating of a component or dirt accumulation may make it impossible to distinguish brown from red or orange. Advances in printing technology have now made printed numbers more practical on small components. The values of components in surface mount packages are marked with printed alphanumeric codes instead of a color code.

==Resistors==


===Color band system===
To distinguish left from right there is a gap between the C and D bands:


In the above example, a resistor with bands of red, violet, green, and gold has first digit 2 (red; see table below), second digit 7 (violet), followed by 5 (green) zeroes: . Gold signifies that the tolerance is ±5%.

Precision resistors may be marked with a five band system, to include three significant digits, a power of 10 multiplier (number of trailing zeroes, and a tolerance band. An extra-wide first band indicates a wire-wound resistor.

Resistors manufactured for military use may also include a fifth band which indicates component failure rate (reliability); refer to MIL-HDBK-199 for further details.

Tight tolerance resistors may have three bands for significant figures rather than two, or an additional band indicating temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR), in units of ppm/K.

All coded components have at least two value bands and a multiplier; other bands are optional.

The standard color code per IEC 60062:2016 is as follows:

Resistors use various E series of preferred numbers for their specific values, which are determined by their tolerance. These values repeat for every decade of magnitude: ... 0.68, 6.8, 68, 680, ... For resistors of 20% tolerance the E6 series, with six values: 10, 15, 22, 33, 47, 68, then 100, 150, ... is used; each value is approximately the previous value multiplied by . For 10% tolerance resistors the E12 series, with as multiplier, is used; similar schemes up to E192, for 0.5% or tighter tolerance are used. The separation between the values is related to the tolerance so that adjacent values at the extremes of tolerance approximately just overlap; for example, in the E6 series is 12, while is also 12.

Zero ohm resistors, marked with a single black band, are lengths of wire wrapped in a resistor-like body which can be mounted on a printed-circuit board (PCB) by automatic component-insertion equipment. They are typically used on PCBs as insulating &quot;bridges&quot; where two tracks would otherwise cross, or as soldered-in jumper wires for setting configurations.

=== Body-end-dot system ===
The &quot;body-end-dot&quot; or &quot;body-tip-spot&quot; system was used for cylindrical composition resistors sometimes still found in very old equipment (built before the Second World War); the first band was given by the body color, the second band by the color of one end of the resistor, and the multiplier by a dot or band around the middle of the resistor. The other end of the resistor was in the body color, silver, or gold for 20%, 10%, 5% tolerance (tighter tolerances were not routinely used).

===Examples===

From top to bottom:
* Green, blue, black, black, brown
** 560 ohms ±1%
* Red, red, orange, gold
** ±5%
* Yellow, violet, brown, gold
** 470 ohms ±5%
* Blue, grey, black, gold
** 68 ohms ±5%

The physical size of a resistor is indicative of the power it can dissipate.

There is an important difference between the use of three and of four bands to indicate resistance. The same resistance is encoded by:
*Red, red, &quot;orange&quot; = &quot;22&quot; followed by &quot;3&quot; zeroes = (excluding default, silver, or gold tolerance)
*Red, red, &quot;black&quot;, &quot;red&quot; = &quot;220&quot; followed by &quot;2&quot; zeroes = (excluding brown or other band for tolerance)

===Mnemonics===
Useful mnemonics have been created to make it easier to remember the numeric order of resistor color bands:

* Betty Brown Runs Over Your Garden But Violet Gingerly Walks.
* Bad Bears Raid Our Yummy Grub But Veto Grey Waffles.
* BB ROY from Great Britain has a Very Good Wife. 
The following example includes the tolerance codes — gold, silver and none:

* Bad Beer Rots Out Your Guts But Vodka Goes Well – Get Some Now.

The colors are sorted in ascending order of frequency to make them easy to remember and to reduce the significance of possible read errors due to color shifts and fading over time: red (2), orange (3), yellow (4), green (5), blue (6), violet (7). Black (0) has no energy, brown (1) has a little more, white (9) has everything and grey (8) is like white, but less intense.

==Capacitors==
Capacitors may be marked with 4 or more colored bands or dots. The colors encode the first and second most significant digits of the value in picofarads, and the third color the decimal multiplier. Additional bands have meanings which may vary from one type to another. Low-tolerance capacitors may begin with the first 3 (rather than 2) digits of the value. It is usually, but not always, possible to work out what scheme is used by the particular colors used. Cylindrical capacitors marked with bands may look like resistors.

Extra bands on ceramic capacitors identify the voltage rating class and temperature coefficient characteristics. A broad black band was applied to some tubular paper capacitors to indicate the end that had the outer electrode; this allowed this end to be connected to chassis ground to provide some shielding against hum and noise pickup.

Polyester film and &quot;gum drop&quot; tantalum electrolytic capacitors may also be color-coded to give the value, working voltage and tolerance.

===Postage stamp capacitors and war standard coding===

Capacitors of the rectangular &quot;postage stamp&quot; form made for military use during World War II used &quot;American War Standard&quot; (AWS) or &quot;Joint Army-Navy&quot; (JAN) coding in six dots stamped on the capacitor. An arrow on the top row of dots pointed to the right, indicating the reading order. From left to right the top dots were: either black, indicating JAN mica, or silver, indicating AWS paper; first significant digit; and second significant digit. The bottom three dots indicated temperature characteristic, tolerance, and decimal multiplier. The characteristic was black for , brown for ±500, red for ±200, orange for ±100, yellow for −20 to +100 ppm/°C, and green for 0 to +70 ppm/°C.

A similar six-dot code by EIA had the top row as first, second and third significant digits and the bottom row as voltage rating (in hundreds of volts; no color indicated 500 volts), tolerance, and multiplier. A three-dot EIA code was used for 500 volt 20% tolerance capacitors, and the dots signified first and second significant digits and the multiplier. Such capacitors were common in vacuum tube equipment and in surplus for a generation after the war but are unavailable now.

==Inductors==
Standards IEC 60062 / EN 60062 do not define a color code for inductors, but manufacturers of small inductors use the resistor color code, typically encoding inductance in microhenries. A white tolerance ring is used by TDK to indicate custom specifications.

==Diodes==
The part number for small JEDEC &quot;1N&quot;-coded diodesin the form &quot;1N4148&quot;is sometimes encoded as three or four rings in the standard color code, omitting the &quot;1N&quot; prefix. The 1N4148 would then be coded as yellow (4), brown (1), yellow (4), grey (8).

==Wire==

===Transformer===
Power transformers used in North American vacuum-tube equipment were often color-coded to identify the leads. Black was the primary connection, red secondary for the B+ (plate voltage), red with a yellow tracer was the center tap for the B+ full-wave rectifier winding, green or brown was the heater voltage for all tubes, yellow was the filament voltage for the rectifier tube (often a different voltage than other tube heaters). Two wires of each color were provided for each circuit, and phasing was not identified by the color code.

Audio transformers for vacuum tube equipment were coded blue for the finishing lead of the primary, red for the B+ lead of the primary, brown for a primary center tap, green for the finishing lead of the secondary, black for grid lead of the secondary, and yellow for a tapped secondary. Each lead had a different color since relative polarity or phase was more important for these transformers. Intermediate-frequency tuned transformers were coded blue and red for the primary and green and black for the secondary.

===Other===
Wires may be color-coded to identify their function, voltage class, polarity, phase or to identify the circuit in which they are used. The insulation of the wire may be solidly colored, or where more combinations are needed, one or two tracer stripes may be added. Some wiring color codes are set by national regulations, but often a color code is specific to a manufacturer or industry.

Building wiring under the US National Electrical Code and the Canadian Electrical Code is identified by colors to show energized, neutral, and grounding conductors, and to identify phases. Other color codes are used in the UK and other areas to identify building wiring or flexible cable wiring.

Mains electrical wiring, both in a building and on equipment, was once usually red for live, black for neutral, and green for earth, but this was changed as it was a hazard for color-blind people, who might confuse red and green; different countries use different conventions. Red and black are frequently used for positive and negative of battery or other single-voltage DC wiring.

Thermocouple wires and extension cables are identified by color code for the type of thermocouple; interchanging thermocouples with unsuitable extension wires destroys the accuracy of the measurement.

Automotive wiring is color-coded but standards vary by manufacturer; differing SAE and DIN standards exist.

Modern personal computer peripheral cables and connectors are color-coded to simplify connection of speakers, microphones, mice, keyboards and other peripherals, usually according to coloring schemes following recommendations such as PC System Design Guide, PoweredUSB, ATX, etc.

A common convention for wiring systems in industrial buildings is: black jacket – AC less than , blue jacket – DC or communications, orange jacket – medium voltage or , red jacket or higher. Red-jacketed cable is also used for relatively low-voltage fire alarm wiring, but has a much different appearance.

Local area network cables may also have non-standardised jacket colors identifying, for example, process control network vs. office automation networks, or to identify redundant network connections, but these codes vary by organization and facility.

<text>Scholastica (; – 10 February 543) was an Italian Christian hermit and the sister of Benedict of Nursia. She is traditionally regarded as the foundress of the Benedictine nuns.

Scholastica is honored as a saint of the Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Church and Anglican Communion. She was born in Italy, and a ninth-century tradition makes her the twin sister of Benedict. Her feast day is 10 February.

== Life ==
According to the 6th-century &quot;Dialogues&quot; of Gregory the Great, Scholastica was born c. 480 in Nursia, Umbria, of wealthy parents (Anicius Eupropius and his wife Claudia Abondantia Reguardati). While Gregory only states that Scholastica was Benedict&#x27;s sister, a later tradition says she was his twin (whether this is meant biologically or spiritually, or both, is unclear). Gregory also says she was dedicated to God from a young age. She and her brother Benedict were brought up together until the time he left to pursue studies in Rome.

A young Roman woman of Scholastica&#x27;s class and time would likely have remained in her father&#x27;s house until marriage or entry into consecrated life. On occasion several consecrated virgins would live together in a household and form a community.

Benedictine history shows that Scholastica established a hermitage about five miles from Monte Cassino and that this was the first convent of Benedictine nuns. However, it is possible that Scholastica lived in a hermitage with one or two other consecrated virgins in a cluster of houses at the base of Mount Cassino where there is an ancient church under her patronage Monastero di Santa Scolastica. Ruth Clifford Engs notes that since &quot;Dialogues&quot; indicates that Scholastica was dedicated to God at an early age, perhaps she lived in her father&#x27;s house with other religious women until his death and then moved nearer to Benedict.

== Narrative from the &quot;Dialogues&quot; ==

The most commonly told story about her is that Scholastica would, once a year, go and visit her brother at a place near his abbey, and they would spend the day worshiping together and discussing sacred texts and issues.

One day they had supper and continued their conversation. When Benedict indicated it was time for him to leave, Scholastica, perhaps sensing that the time of her death was drawing near, asked him to stay with her for the evening so they could continue their discussions. Not wishing to break his own Rule, Benedict refused, insisting that he needed to return to his cell. At that point, Scholastica closed her hands in prayer, and after a moment, a wild storm started outside of the guest house in which they were staying. Benedict asked, &quot;What have you done?&quot;, to which she replied, &quot;I asked you and you would not listen; so I asked my God and he did listen. So now go off, if you can; leave me and return to your monastery.&quot; Benedict was unable to return to his monastery, and they spent the night in discussion.

Three days later, from his cell, he saw his sister&#x27;s soul leaving the earth and ascending to heaven in the form of a shining white dove. Benedict had her body brought to his monastery, where he had it laid in the tomb which he had prepared for himself.

The Anglo-Saxon bishop and scholar Aldhelm recounts the story in both the &quot;De Laude Virginitatis&quot;, written for the nuns at Barking, and in the shorter &quot;Carmen de virginitate&quot;.

== Studies ==

What is known of Scholastica derives from the &quot;Dialogues&quot; of Gregory the Great. Early calendars and place names in the area around Monte Cassino support the historical accuracy of St. Gregory the Great&#x27;s account of her life. Gregory names as his sources four of Benedict&#x27;s contemporaries. A contemporary, Caesarius of Arles, wrote the &quot;Regula virginum&quot; (Rule for Virgins), a rule drawn up for virgins living in community, for a community which was headed by his sister, Caesaria.

== Veneration ==
Scholastica is the patron saint of Benedictine nuns, education, and convulsive children, and is invoked against storms and rain. Her feast is celebrated on 10 February, and Saint Scholastica&#x27;s Day bears special importance in the Benedictine monastic calendar. The Diocese of Aachen locally keeps a secondary feast of the translation of Scholastica&#x27;s relics on 6 February, while Premonstratensians commemorate her on 9 February. Scholastica is also remembered in the Church of England and the Episcopal Church on 10 February. 

In iconography, Scholastica is represented in a Benedictine habit, often as an abbess, and holding the Rule of Saint Benedict, with a crucifix or an ascending dove.

Scholastica was selected as the main motif for a high-value commemorative coin: the Austria €50 &#x27;The Christian Religious Orders&#x27;, issued 13 March 2002. On the obverse (head) side, Scholastica is shown alongside her brother, Benedict.

<text>Jacint Verdaguer i Santaló (; 17 May 1845 – 10 June 1902) was a Catalan writer, regarded as one of the greatest poets of Catalan literature and a prominent literary figure of the Renaixença, a cultural revival movement of the late Romantic era. The bishop Josep Torras i Bages, one of the main figures of Catalan nationalism, called him the &quot;Prince of Catalan poets&quot;. He was also known as &quot;mossèn&quot; (Father) Cinto Verdaguer, because of his career as a priest, and informally also simply &quot;mossèn Cinto&quot; (with Cinto being a short form of Jacint).
== Life ==
He was born in Folgueroles, a town on the Plain of Vic, in the &quot;comarca&quot; of Osona (Province of Barcelona) to a modest family who valued learning. His father, Josep Verdaguer i Ordeix (Tavèrnoles, 1817 – Folgueroles, 1876), was a brickmason and farmer. His mother, Josepa Santaló i Planes (Folgueroles, 1819–1871), a housewife and farmer, was to exercise great influence over young Jacint, as she conveyed to him a love of literature, especially poetry, and was a deeply religious woman. He was the third of eight children, only three of whom survived. In 1855, at the age of 10, he entered the Seminary of Vic, as was expected for a child who was not the first-born under the system of primogeniture and had to make his livelihood without relying on an inheritance. Until then, he had lived like the other children in his town. The anecdotes told about him show that he stood out from his peers for his intelligence, astuteness and courage, as well as his athletic constitution. He displayed a balanced attitude without any apparent religious inclinations.

In 1863, when he was 18, he started to work as a tutor for a family at the Can Tona masia (where he also helped out on the farm), while he continued to study. Can Tona is in the municipal district of Sant Martí de Riudeperes, today Calldetenes (Osona). 

In 1864, while a seminary student at the , Verdaguer wrote his first published poem &quot;Als estudiants. Recepta&quot;, written in the style of a satirical décima. He was influenced in this endeavour by the popularity of a similar satirical décima, &quot;Entusiasme d&#x27;un estudiant per la cresta&quot; written by fellow seminary student Andreu Garriga in 1863. That same year, he participated in Barcelona&#x27;s Jocs Florals (&quot;Floral Games&quot;) poetry contest, though without distinction. However, he was more successful in the next two Jocs Florals, winning four prizes in 1865 and two in 1866. In the late 1860s, Verdaguer would become the central figure of the , a group of young poets in Vic inspired by the ideals of the Catalan Renaixença.

On 24 September 1870 he was ordained a priest by the bishop Lluís Jordà in Vic, and in October that same year, he said his first Mass, in the Sant Jordi hermitage. The next day he said his second Mass in the Sant Francesc hermitage near Vic. In 1871, his mother died (January 17) at the age of 52. On September 1 he was appointed bishop coadjutor of the small town of Vinyoles d&#x27;Orís and three days later he took up his charge.

In 1873, he published the &quot;cant&quot; (ode or song) &quot;Passió de Nostre Senyor Jesucrist&quot; (Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ). He left Vinyoles d&#x27;Orís for health reasons and moved to Vic. He went on a trip to Roussillon and saw the mountain, El Canigó, possibly for the first time. In December, he joined the Companyia Transatlàntica trans-Atlantic steamship company as a chaplain because he was prescribed sea air for his health; he embarked in Cádiz bound for Havana.

On 8 September 1876 his father died at the age of 65. On board the &quot;Ciudad Condal&quot;, on the return voyage from Cuba, Jacint Verdaguer finished his epic poem &quot;L&#x27;Atlàntida&quot;. In November he entered the palace of Antonio López, 1st Marquess of Comillas as an alms chaplain.

In 1877, when he was 32, and having returned from his journey, the jury of the Jocs Florals awarded him the special prize of the Diputation of Barcelona for &quot;L&#x27;Atlàntida&quot;. Now he had earned his reputation as a poet.
In 1878, he traveled to Rome, where he was granted an audience with Pope Leo XIII. They discussed Verdaguer&#x27;s poem &quot;L&#x27;Atlàntida&quot;. In 1880, as the winner of three prizes in the Jocs Florals, he was proclaimed &quot;Master of the Gay Sciences&quot; (&quot;Mestre en Gai Saber&quot;). That same year he published his book of poetry, &quot;Montserrat&quot;, which included &quot;Llegenda de Montserrat&quot;, a legend (or two) in the form of a poem with 13 cantos.

In 1883, the Barcelona City Council published a print-run of a hundred thousand copies of his &quot;Oda a Barcelona&quot; (Ode to Barcelona), a 46-stanza poem. Such a print-run was quite a remarkable given that the population of Barcelona at the time was 350,000, which would have amounted to about a copy per household. At the age of 39, Verdaguer traveled to Paris, Switzerland, Germany and Russia.
His collection of poems &quot;Caritat&quot; (&quot;Charity&quot;, 1885) was published to raise funds for reconstruction after the Andalusian earthquake of 25 December 1884.
On 21 March 1886, when he was 41 years old, Bishop Morgades crowned him &#x27;Poet of Catalonia&#x27; in the monastery of Ripoll. He published the epic poem &quot;Canigó&quot; and made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land.

In 1893, following controversy about aspects of his work as a priest, he left the post of alms chaplain at Claudio López, 2nd Marquess of Comillas’ palace. The publication of the trilogy &quot;Jesús Infant&quot; was completed, and he was assigned to the sanctuary of La Gleva. For a period, he was stripped of his office as priest, although this was eventually restored. In 1894, the books &quot;Roser de tot l&#x27;any&quot; and &quot;Veus del bon pastor&quot; were published. On 31 March he left the sanctuary of La Gleva.

On 17 May 1902, his 57th birthday, he moved from his home at Carrer Aragó 235 in Barcelona to the country house known as Vil·la Joana, in Vallvidrera (Barcelona), where he hoped to convalesce. On 10 June he died in Vil·la Joana, which is now one of the Barcelona City History Museum (MUHBA) heritage sites.

Verdaguer was buried in Montjuïc Cemetery in Barcelona.

He was depicted on the Spanish 1971 500 Pesetas banknote.

== Selected works ==
Among his works are: 
* &quot;L&#x27;Atlàntida&quot; (Atlantis, 1876), epic poem
* &quot;Idil·lis i cants místics&quot; (Idylls and Mystic Songs, 1879), book of poems
* &quot;Montserrat&quot; (1880, 1899), book of poems on the topic of Montserrat
* &quot;A Barcelona&quot; (&quot;To Barcelona&quot;, 1883), ode in 46 stanzas
* &quot;Caritat&quot; (Charity, 1885)
* &quot;Canigó&quot; (1886), epic poem
* &quot;Sant Francesc&quot; (Saint Francis, 1895)
* &quot;Flors del Calvari&quot; (Flowers of Calvary, 1896)

The scenic cantata &quot;Atlàntida&quot;, composed by Manuel de Falla and completed after de Falla&#x27;s death by Ernesto Halffter, is based on Verdaguer&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Atlàntida&quot;. Manuel de Falla considered this large-scale orchestral piece to be the most important of all his works.

Some of his shorter poems are well known as songs in Catalonia, especially &quot;L&#x27;Emigrant&quot; (&quot;Sweet Catalonia, country of my heart...&quot;).

<text>Pontiac fever is an acute, nonfatal respiratory disease caused by various species of Gram-negative bacteria in the genus &quot;Legionella&quot;. It causes a mild upper respiratory infection that resembles acute influenza. Pontiac fever resolves spontaneously and often goes undiagnosed. Both Pontiac fever and the more severe Legionnaire&#x27;s disease may be caused by the same bacterium, but Pontiac fever does not include pneumonia.

==Signs and symptoms==

==Cause==
Species of &quot;Legionella&quot; known to cause Pontiac fever include &quot;Legionella pneumophila&quot;, &quot;Legionella longbeachae&quot;, &quot;Legionella feeleii&quot;, &quot;Legionella micdadei&quot;, and &quot;Legionella anisa&quot;. Sources of the causative agents are aquatic systems and potting soil. The first outbreak caused by inhalation of aerosolized potting soil was discovered in New Zealand in January 2007. A total of 10 workers at a nursery came down with Pontiac fever. It was the first identification of &quot;L. longbeachae&quot;. Pontiac fever does not spread from person to person. It is acquired through aerosolization of water droplets and/or potting soil containing &quot;Legionella&quot; bacteria.

==Diagnosis==
==Epidemiology==
Pontiac fever is known to have a short incubation period of 1 to 3 days. No fatalities have been reported and cases resolve spontaneously without treatment. It is often not reported. Age, gender, and smoking do not seem to be risk factors. Pontiac fever seems to affect young people in the age medians of 29 to 32. Pathogenesis of the Pontiac fever is poorly known.

==History==
Pontiac fever was named after the city of Pontiac, Michigan, where the first case was recognized. In 1968, several workers at the county&#x27;s department of health came down with a fever and mild flu symptoms, but not pneumonia. After the 1976 Legionnaires&#x27; outbreak in Philadelphia, the Michigan health department re-examined blood samples and discovered the workers had been infected with the newly identified &quot;Legionella pneumophila&quot;. An outbreak caused by&quot; Legionella micdadei&quot; in early 1988 in the UK became known as Lochgoilhead fever. Since that time, other species of &quot;Legionella&quot; that cause Pontiac fever have been identified, most notably in New Zealand, in 2007 where &quot;Legionella longbeachae&quot; was discovered. The New Zealand outbreak also marked the first time Pontiac fever had been traced to potting soil.

<doc id="67877" wikidata="Q1806213" url="?curid=67877" title="Francesc Macià">
<text>Francesc Macià i Llussà (; 21 September 1859 – 25 December 1933) was a Catalan politician who served as the 122nd president of the Generalitat of Catalonia, and formerly an officer in the Spanish Army.

Politically, Macià evolved from an initial regenerationism of Spain to the defense of the Catalan Republic, being appointed as the first president of the restored Generalitat and achieving the first successful establishment of self-government for Catalonia of modern history.

==Life==
===Early years===
Francesc Macià i Llussà was born in Vilanova i la Geltrú, Catalonia, Spain. Shortly after the death of his father, when he was 16, he entered the Military Academy of Guadalajara to join the Corps of Engineers of the Spanish Army, specializing in bridges, railways and telegraphs. He requested to be transferred to Cuba but was sent several times to Barcelona, Madrid and Seville, rising from telegrapher to captain. As an officer in the Spanish army, he favored its modernization. He achieved the rank of lieutenant-colonel. In 1887 he was transferred to Lleida, where he met his wife, Eugènia Lamarca, daughter of Agapito Lamarca, with whom he had three children, Joan, Eugènia and Maria. 

On 25 November 1905, some Spanish army officers, in retaliation to a joke in the satirical Catalan journal ¡Cu-Cut!, assaulted and destroyed the offices of the magazine, as well as the offices of the Catalanist journal La Veu de Catalunya. The Spanish Government responded by creating a Law of jurisdictions for the repression of crimes against the homeland and against the army, which caused various political groups to unite to form Solidaritat Catalana (&#x27;Catalan Solidarity&#x27;). Macià publicly condemned the military&#x27;s action. As a result, his officials transferred him to Santoña, Cantabria.

He ran as a member of Catalan Solidarity in the election of 21 April 1907 for Barcelona and Les Borges Blanques districts, where his family came from. The resounding victory of this formation (41 of the 44 deputies of Catalonia) took him in Santoña. He was re-elected deputy in 1914, 1916, 1918, 1919, 1920 and 1923. From the Spanish Congress, he began to advocate for the regeneration of Spain, however, during his last years as a politician in Madrid, he moved from Catalan regionalist to left-wing independentist positions.

===Independentist leader===
In 1919 he founded the Nationalist Democratic Federation (&quot;Federació Democràtica Nacionalista&quot;), which proposed a federal or confederal solution for Spain, in which Catalonia would enjoy a high degree of self-government. In 1922, Macià founded the independentist party Estat Català.

In September 1923, right after the coup d&#x27;etat of Miguel Primo de Rivera, Macià took refuge in Perpignan. In 1926 he attempted an insurrection against the Spanish dictatorship of Primo de Rivera. This uprising, known as the plot of Prats de Molló, had the aim to achieve the independence of Catalonia, was based in Prats de Molló (Roussillon, southern France). Between 50 and 100 Italian mercenaries, mostly from the Garibaldi Legion that fought in the French Foreign Legion during World War I and exiled to France, were hired by Macià to help on the action. This attempt was aborted by the French Gendarmerie, which was able to abort the complot with the help of Ricciotti Garibaldi jr., a spy of Fascist Italy and grandson of Giuseppe Garibaldi. Macià was arrested and convicted to two months in jail and a fine of 100 francs. Despite the failure, Macià and his cause became very popular in Catalonia. He left France for Brussels in March 1927, where his notoriety increased while we remained in Belgium. He founded there, with other exiles, the Casal Català de Brussel·les. In April 1930 he returned to Spain after being pardoned; he was briefly exiled again but returned once more in February 1931.

===Republic and Generalitat===
In March 1931 Estat Català joined the Catalan Republican Party of Lluís Companys and the L&#x27;Opinió Group of Joan Lluhí to found a new party, Republican Left of Catalonia (&quot;Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya&quot;, ERC), maintaining Estat Català a degree of internal autonomy. Francesc Macià became the leader figure of the new party.

On 14 April 1931, two days after the Spanish local elections that caused the exile of king Alfonso XIII of Spain and gave the local majority to the Republican Left of Catalonia, and a few hours before the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic in Madrid, from the balcony of the Palau de la Generalitat (then the seat of the Provincial Deputation of Barcelona), Macià proclaimed the &quot;Catalan Republic, expecting that the other peoples of Spain constitute themselves as republics, in order to establish the Iberian Confederation&quot;. Macià was appointed as acting president of Catalonia. Three days later, the government of the new Spanish Republic sent three ministers (Fernando de los Ríos, Lluís Nicolau d&#x27;Olwer and Marcel·lí Domingo) to Barcelona to negotiate with Macià and the Catalan provisional government. Macià reached an agreement with the ministers, in which the Catalan Republic was renamed Generalitat of Catalonia, becoming an autonomous government within the Spanish Republic. Macià remained as acting President of the Generalitat. The main task of the provisional Generalitat was to redact the Statute of Autonomy, approved by the Spanish Congress after many modifications on 9 September 1932.

After the first Catalan parliamentary election on 20 November 1932 when, after a landslide victory of ERC, he was officially appointed President of the Generalitat of Catalonia, maintaining the position until his death in December 1933.

===Death===

Macià died due to appendicitis on 25 December 1933 in Barcelona. His funeral caused a massive demonstration of grief. His remains rest in the &quot;Plaça de la Fe&quot;, the Montjuïc Cemetery, in Barcelona&#x27;s Montjuïc hill.

==Documentation==
Part of his personal collection, which consists of documentation image about the president travels throughout Catalonia and family snapshots, is preserved in the National Archive of Catalonia. They are a repository of Mrs. Teresa Peyrí i Macià. The fund contains documents generated and received by Francesc Macià, personal and family documents, correspondence from the period before the Second Spanish Republic (until April 1931) and documentation produced primarily in terms of its political activity. The fund brings together documents relating to his conduct before being named president of the Government of Catalonia (1907-1931): as a Member of Parliament (speeches, proclamations, and conference reports) on Estat Català (organization, reports, proclamations, calls, publications, etc.), on Catalan Army (constitution, rules and organization, information mapping and geographic pathways) and on the corresponding period in the Directory of General Primo de Rivera. Finally, there is the collection of photographs, most made during his presidency.

Another part of Macià&#x27;s personal archive consists of correspondence written to/by Joan Agell, documents of Centre Català in New York, diverse documentation and press clippings. It is in the Pavelló de la República CRAI Library at the University of Barcelona.

<doc id="67881" wikidata="Q64152" url="?curid=67881" title="Ishihara test">
<text>The Ishihara test is a color vision test for detection of red–green color deficiencies. It was named after its designer, Shinobu Ishihara, a professor at the University of Tokyo, who first published his tests in 1917.

The test consists of a number of Ishihara plates, which are a type of pseudoisochromatic plate. Each plate depicts a solid circle of colored dots appearing randomized in color and size. Within the pattern are dots which form a number or shape clearly visible to those with normal color vision, and invisible, or difficult to see, to those with a red–green color vision defect. Other plates are intentionally designed to reveal numbers only to those with a red–green color vision deficiency, and be invisible to those with normal red–green color vision. The full test consists of 38 plates, but the existence of a severe deficiency is usually apparent after only a few plates. There are also Ishihara tests consisting of 10, 14 or 24 test plates, and plates in some versions ask the viewer to trace a line rather than read a number.

==Plates==
The plates make up several different test designs:
;Demonstration plates: (Plate number one, typically the numeral &quot;12&quot;); designed to be visible by all subjects, whether normal or color vision deficient. For demonstration purposes only, and usually not considered in making a score for screening purposes.
;Transformation plates: Individuals with color vision defect should see a different figure from individuals with normal color vision.
;Vanishing plates: Only individuals with normal color vision could recognize the figure.
;Hidden digit plates: Only individuals with color vision defect could recognize the figure.
;Diagnostic plates: Intended to determine the type of color vision defect (protanopia or deuteranopia) and the severity of it.
;Tracing plates: Instead of reading a number, subjects are asked to trace a visible line across the plate.

The numbering and rotation of plates differs between the shortened diagnostic versions of the test and the full 38-plate test.

==History==
Born in 1879 to a family in Tokyo, Shinobu Ishihara began his education at the Imperial University where he attended on a military scholarship. Ishihara had just completed his graduate studies in ophthalmology in Germany when war broke out in Europe and World War I had begun. While holding a military position related to his field, he was given the task of creating a color blindness test. Ishihara studied existing tests and combined elements of the Stilling test, named after the German ophthalmologist Jakob Stilling, with the concept of pseudo-isochromaticism to produce an improved, more accurate and easier to use test. 

==Test procedures==
Being a printed plate, the accuracy of the test depends on using the proper lighting to illuminate the page. A &quot;daylight&quot; bulb illuminator is required to give the most accurate results, of around 6000–7000 K temperature (ideal: 6500 K, Color Rendering Index (CRI) &gt;90), and is required for military color vision screening policy. Fluorescent bulbs are often used in school testing, but the color of fluorescent bulbs and their CRI can vary widely. Fluorescent lighting showed better results and faster recognition speed compared to CFL and LED luminance in trichromats. Incandescent bulbs should not be used, as their low temperature (yellow-color) gives highly inaccurate results, allowing some color vision deficient persons to pass.

Proper testing technique is to give only three seconds per plate for an answer, and not allow coaching, touching or tracing of the numbers by the subject. The test is best given in random sequence, if possible, to reduce the effectiveness of prior memorization of the answers by subjects. Some pseudo-isochromatic plate books have the pages in binders, so the plates may be rearranged periodically to give a random order to the test.

Since its creation, the Ishihara Color Blindness Test has become commonly used worldwide because of its easy use and high accuracy. In recent years, the Ishihara test has become available online in addition to its original paper version. Though both media use the same plates, they require different methods for an accurate diagnosis.

==Occupational screening==
The United States Navy uses the Ishihara plates (and alternatives) for color vision screening. The current passing score is 10 correct of 14 red/green test plates (not including the demonstration plate).

Research has shown that scores below twelve indicate color vision deficiency, and twelve or more correct indicate normal color vision, with 97% sensitivity and 100% specificity. The sensitivity of the Ishihara test varies by the number of plates allowed to pass, which can vary by institutional policy. Sensitivity also may be influenced by test administration (strength of lighting, time allowed to answer) and testing errors (coaching by administrators, smudges or marks made upon the plates).

<text>Sports injuries are injuries that occur during sports or exercise in general. In the United States, approximately 30 million people participate in some form of organized sports. Of those 30 million, about 3 million athletes aged 14 and under suffer a sports related injury annually. According to a study performed at Stanford University, 21% of injuries observed in elite college athletes caused them to miss at least one day of sports activity, and approximately 77% of these injuries involved the knee, leg, ankle, or foot. The leading cause of death from sports injuries is traumatic head or neck injuries.

When an athlete complains of pain, injury, or distress, the key to diagnosis is a detailed history and examination. An example of a format used to guide an examination and treatment plan is a S.O.A.P. note, which stands for subjective, objective, assessment, plan. Another important aspect of sports injury is prevention, which helps to reduce potential sports injuries. It is important to establish sport-specific dynamic warm-ups, stretching, and exercises that can help prevent injuries more common to each sport. 

An injury prevention program consists of education on hydration and nutrition, monitoring team members at risk, monitoring risky behaviors, and improving techniques. In addition, season analysis reviews, preseason screenings, and pre-participation examinations are crucial in recognizing pre-existing conditions or previous injuries that could cause further illness or injury. One technique that can be used in the process of preseason screening is the functional movement screen. The functional movement screen can assess movement patterns in athletes to find players who are at risk of certain injuries. In addition, prevention for adolescent athletes should be considered and may need to be applied differently than adult athletes. Lastly, following various research about sports injuries, it is shown that levels of anxiety, stress, and depression are elevated when an athlete experiences an injury depending on the type and severity of the injury.

== Types of sport injury ==
Nearly two million people every year suffer sports-related injuries and receive treatment in emergency departments. Fatigue is a large contributing factor that results in many sports injuries. There are times when an athlete participates with low energy, which can lead to a deterioration in technique or form, resulting in slower reaction times or reduced stability in the muscles and joints, thereby increasing the risk of injury. For both genders, the most common areas injured are the knee and ankle, with sprains/strains being the most common areas for injury. Injuries involving the patellofemoral articulation are significantly more frequent among females. The sport with the highest injury rate in the United States is American football, with greater than 12 times the number of injuries seen in the next most common sport.

=== Soft tissue injuries ===

When soft tissue experiences trauma, the dead and damaged cells release chemicals, which initiate an inflammatory response. Damaged blood vessels dilate, producing bleeding within the tissue. The body&#x27;s normal response includes forming a small blood clot to stop the bleeding and allowing a clot of special cells, called fibroblasts, to form. This begins the healing process by laying down scar tissue. Therefore, the inflammatory stage is the first phase of healing. However, too much of an inflammatory response in the early stage can indicate that the healing process takes longer and a return to activity is delayed. Physicians and medical professionals intend to minimize the inflammatory phase of an injury to accelerate the overall healing process. Intrinsic and extrinsic factors are determinants for the healing process.

Physicians group soft tissue injuries into three categories: contusions, abrasions, and lacerations. Contusions or bruises are the simplest and most common soft tissue injuries and are usually a result of blunt force trauma. Severe contusions may involve deeper structures and can include nerve or vascular injury. Abrasions are superficial injuries to the skin no deeper than the epidermis tissue layer, and bleeding, if present, is minimal. Minor abrasions generally do not scar, but deeper abrasions generally bleed and may scar. Blunt trauma causes sports-related lacerations, resulting in burst-type open wounds with jagged irregular edges. Facial lacerations are the most variable of the soft tissue injuries that athletes can sustain. They can occur intraoral or extraoral, and vary from a superficial skin nick to a lip laceration, or involve significant vascular disruption or injury to collateral vital structures.

=== Hard tissue injuries ===
Types of hard tissue injuries can include dental and bone injuries and are less frequent than soft tissue injuries in sport, but are often more serious. Hard tissue injuries to teeth and bones can occur with contusions, such as Battle sign, which indicates basilar skull fracture, and so-called raccoon eyes, which indicate midface fractures. However, tooth fractures are the most common type of tooth injury, and can be categorized as crown infractions, enamel-only fracture, enamel-dentin fractures, and fractures that extend through the enamel and dentin into the pulp which is defined below.

* Crown infractions are characterized by a disruption of the enamel prisms from a traumatic force, these injuries typically present as small cracks that affect only the enamel.
* Enamel-only fractures are mild and often appear as roughness along the edge of the tooth crown. These injuries typically can go unnoticed by the athlete as they are usually not sensitive to the touch or temperature changes. Enamel-only fractures are not considered dental emergencies and immediate care is not needed.
* Enamel-Dentin crown fractures typically present as a tooth fracture confined to enamel and dentin with loss of tooth structure, but not exposing the pulp. The athlete often will report sensitivity to air, cold or touch, but the athlete can return to play as tolerated and referral can be delayed up to 24 hours.
* Enamel-Dentin-Pulp fractures extend through the enamel and dentin and into the pulp. If the pulp is vital, a focal spot of hemorrhage will be noticeable within the yellow dentin layer and the athlete may report acute pain. Referral to a trauma-ready dentist should occur as soon as possible.

In addition to tooth fractures, there are several types of bone fractures as well. These types being closed or simple, open or compound, greenstick, hairline, complicated, comminuted, avulsion, and compression. A complicated fracture is when the structures surrounding the fracture are injured, such as blood vessels, organs, nerves, etc.

=== Overuse injuries ===
Overuse injuries can be defined as injuries that result from a mechanism of repetitive and cumulative micro-trauma, without a specific onset incident. Rapid changes in physical growth can make children vulnerable to overuse injuries, and these types of injuries are increasing among youth populations. Overuse injuries can usually be classified into four types/stages, these include:

* Pain in the affected area during activity (which does not affect performance)
* Pain in the affected area during activity (which does restrict performance)
* Pain in the affected area after activity
* Chronic pain in the affected area, even after resting

Predictive Indicators of Overuse Injuries in Adolescent Endurance Athletes, runners seem to account for the majority of injuries (up to 80 percent) with the majority of these injuries (more than two-thirds), occurring in the lower extremity and being of an overuse nature. Researchers have reported an overall incidence of 0.89 injuries/1000 hours for high school track and field athletes, while others have found specific injury incidence in youth track and field varies among disciplines, with a reported incidence rate of 3.9 injuries/1000 hours of practice in senior athletics. In addition, long-distance runners have shown a 19 times higher incidence (17 injuries/1000 hours) than other disciplines.

=== Head and neck injuries ===
Head and neck injuries can include a variety of pathologies from sprains, strains, and fractures to traumatic brain injuries and spinal cord injuries. Sprains and strains can occur from an abrupt rotation or whipping motion, such as whiplash. Stress injuries (stress fractures and stress reactions) of the lumbosacral region are one of the causes of sports-related lower back pain in young individuals. The onset of the observed cervical fractures in sports injury were likely due to continued momentum that transferred loads superiorly through the neck, which exacerbates injuries to the occipital condyles and the upper cervical vertebrae. Researchers have reported that 3-25% of cervical spine injuries actually occur after the initial traumatic event and are caused or exacerbated by improper handling during early stages of management or patient transport. One of the more common head or neck injuries that occurs in sports is a concussion. A concussion is a type of mild traumatic brain injury resulting in a chemical change in the brain and has the potential to cause damage to brain tissue. This can occur when a person sustains a hit or blow that causes the head and brain to move quickly, causing the brain to bounce in the skull. According to an epidemiological study published in the Journal of Athletic Training, the incidence of concussions from 27 high school sports was 3.89 sports-related concussions per 10,000 athlete exposures.
== Sports-related injuries ==

&quot;Subacromial impingement syndrome&quot; is a shoulder joint injury. Baseball players are prone to being affected with subacromial impingement syndrome, as the sport requires an overhead movement of the arms to make a throw. Injury causes mechanical inflammation in the subacromial space – the space above the shoulder&#x27;s ball and socket joint and the topmost shoulder bone. Muscular strength imbalances, poor scapula, and rotator cuff tears are the main causes of subacromial impingement syndrome. Overhead movement of the arms instigates pain.

Falling on an outstretched arm and pulling on the shoulder, repetitive lifting of heavy loads, or overhead movement cause rotator cuff tears.

&quot;Anterior cruciate ligament injury:&quot; common in skiing, soccer, football, and basketball. Immediately after injury, the subject will fall to the ground, acute swelling sets in, the knee is destabilized, and bearing weight becomes a difficulty. Knee injury in contact sports, and jumping, deceleration, and pivoting in non-contact sports and activities cause anterior cruciate ligament injury.

&quot;Collateral ligament injury:&quot; An injury to a partially flexed knee can damage the medial collateral ligament – the ligament stretching along the inner edge of the knee. A forceful medial blow to the knee can cause collateral ligament injury. A reduction in range of motion and pain are symptoms of collateral ligament injury.

&quot;Meniscus injuries:&quot; acute or repeated injury to the meniscus – the shock absorber of the knee – causes meniscus injuries. A person with meniscus injuries experiences difficulty squatting and walking instigates pain.

&quot;Runner&#x27;s knee (patellofemoral pain):&quot; knee joint pain affecting the patellofemoral joint. Pain is a direct consequence of the kneecap rubbing against the end of the thigh bone – &quot;patella&quot; means kneecap and &quot;femur&quot; means a thigh bone. The force the patellofemoral joint has to sustain can be as much as five times the body weight when the knee is fully flexed – when squatting – and three times body weight when the knee flexes to 90 degrees – when climbing stairs. This makes the cartilage that makes up the patellofemoral joint susceptible to wear and tear. The typical pain is also associated with muscle strength and joint flexibility. Repetitive physical activity such as running can trigger pain. Tight hamstrings, tight Achilles tendons, and weak thigh muscles, which are required to stabilize the knee, cause a runner&#x27;s knee.

&quot;Inversion ankle sprain:&quot; landing on an uneven surface sprains the ankle. Swelling, localized pain, difficulty bearing weight, and limping are signs of an inversion ankle sprain.

&quot;Eversion ankle sprain:&quot; injury related to the ankle turning outward or rotating externally. A typical symptom of eversion ankle sprain is intense pain that worsens with weight bearing.

== Risk factors ==

Several factors may put an athlete more at risk for certain injuries than others. Intrinsic or personal factors that could put an athlete at higher risk for injury could be gender. For example, female athletes are typically more prone to injuries such as ACL tears. There is approximately a 1.6-fold greater rate of ACL tears per athletic exposure in high school female athletes than in males of the same age range. Other intrinsic factors are age, weight, body composition, height, lack of flexibility or range of motion, coordination, balance, and endurance. In addition, biological factors such as pes planus, pes cavus, and valgus or varus knees can cause an athlete to have improper biomechanics and become predisposed to injury. There are also psychological factors that are included in intrinsic risk factors. Some psychological factors that could make certain individuals more subject to injury include personal stressors in their homes, school, or social life. There are also extrinsic risk factors that can affect an athlete&#x27;s risk of injury. Some examples of extrinsic factors would be sport-specific protective equipment such as helmets, shoulder pads, mouth guards, and shin guards, and whether or not these pieces of equipment are fitted correctly to the individual athlete to ensure that they are each preventing injury as well as possible. Other extrinsic factors are the conditions of the sports setting such as rain, snow, and maintenance of the floor/field of playing surface.

== Prevention ==

Prevention helps reduce potential sports injuries. Benefits include a healthier athlete, longer duration of participation in the sport, potential for better performance, and reduced medical costs. Explaining the benefits of sports injury prevention programs to coaches, team trainers, sports teams, and individual athletes will give them a glimpse at the likelihood for success by having the athletes feel they are healthy, strong, comfortable, and capable to compete. Better training and better exercises can help prevent injuries from even happening. 

=== Primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention ===
Prevention can be broken up into three broad categories primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention. Primary prevention involves the avoidance of injury. An example is ankle brace being worn as a team. Even those with no history of previous ankle injuries participate in wearing braces. If primary prevention activities were effective, there would be a lesser chance of injuries occurring in the first place. Secondary prevention involves an early diagnosis and treatment once an injury has occurred. The goal of early diagnosis is to ensure that the injury is receiving proper care and recovering correctly, thereby limiting the concern for other medical problems stemming from the initial traumatic event. 

Some sports leagues have gone further in terms of secondary prevention by incorporating live sensing data to allow early diagnosis and treatment: Some teams in the Swiss National Ice Hockey League are testing out systems that combine helmet-integrated sensors and analysis software to reveal a player’s ongoing brain injury risk during a game. These sensors provide players and coaches with real-time data on head impact strength, frequency, and severity. The sensors are planned to be integrated into the foam padding used inside hockey helmets to serve as pressure detectors. 

Lastly, tertiary prevention is solely focused on rehabilitation to reduce and correct an existing disability resulting from the traumatic event. Thus, for an athlete with an ankle injury, rehabilitation would consist of balance exercises to recover strength and mobility, as well as wearing an ankle brace while gradually returning to the sport.

=== Season analysis ===
It is most essential to establish participation in warm-ups, stretching, and exercises that focus on main muscle groups commonly used in the sport of interest. This decreases the chances of getting muscle cramps, torn muscles, and stress fractures. A season analysis is an attempt to identify risks before they occur by reviewing training methods, the competition schedule, traveling, and past injuries. If injuries have occurred in the past, the season analysis reviews the injury and looks for patterns that may be related to a specific training event or competition program. For example, a stress fracture injury on a soccer team or cross country team may be correlated to a simultaneous increase in running and a change in running environment, like a transition from a soft to hard running surface. A season analysis can be documented as team-based results or individual athlete results. Other key program events that have been correlated to injury incidence are changes in training volume, changes in climate locations, selection for playing time in important matches, and poor sleep due to tight chaotic scheduling. It is important for team program directors and staff to implicate testing to ensure healthy, competitive, and confident athletes for their upcoming season.

=== Preseason screening ===
Another beneficial review for preventing player sports injuries is preseason screenings. A study found that the highest injury rate during practices across fifteen Division I, II, and III NCAA sports was in the preseason compared to in-season or postseason. To prepare an athlete for the wide range of activities needed to partake in their sport pre-participation examinations are regularly completed on hundreds of thousands of athletes each year. The physical exam must be done properly to limit the risks of injury and also to diagnose early onsets of a possible injury. Preseason screenings consist of testing the mobility of joints (ankles, wrists, hips, etc.), testing the stability of joints (knees, neck, etc.), testing the strength and power of muscles, and also testing breathing patterns. The objective of a preseason screening is to clear the athlete for participation and verify that there is no sign of injury or illness, which would represent a potential medical risk to the athlete (and a risk of liability to the sports organization). Besides the physical examination and the fluidity of the movements of joints the preseason screenings often take into account a nutrition aspect as well. It is important to maintain normal iron levels, blood pressure levels, fluid balance, adequate total energy intake, and normal glycogen levels. Nutrition can aid in injury prevention and rehabilitation if one obtains the body&#x27;s daily intake needs. Obtaining sufficient amounts of calories, carbohydrates, fluids, protein, and vitamins and minerals is important for the overall health of the athlete and limits the risk of possible injuries. Iron deficiency, for example, is found in both male and female athletes; however 60 percent of female college athletes are affected by iron deficiency. There are many factors that can contribute to the loss of iron, like menstruation, gastrointestinal bleeding, inadequate iron intake from the diet, general fatigue, and weakness, among others. The consequences of iron deficiency, if not solved, can be impaired athletic performance and a decline in immune and cognitive function.

==== Functional movement screen ====
One technique used in the process of preseason screening is the functional movement screen (FMS). Functional movement screening is an assessment used to evaluate movement patterns and asymmetries, which can provide insight into mechanical restrictions and potential risk for injury. Functional movement screening contains seven fundamental movement patterns that require a balance of both mobility and stability. These fundamental movement patterns provide an observable performance of basic locomotor, manipulative, and stabilizing movements. The tests place the individual athlete in extreme positions where weaknesses and imbalances become clear if proper stability and mobility are not functioning correctly. The seven fundamental movement patterns are a deep squat, hurdle step, in-line lunge, shoulder mobility, active straight-leg raise, trunk stability push-up, and rotary stability. For example, the deep squat is a test that challenges total body mechanics. It is used to gauge bilateral, symmetrical, and functional mobility of the hips, knees, and ankles. The dowel held overhead gauges bilateral and symmetrical mobility of the shoulders and the thoracic spine. The ability to perform the deep squat technique requires appropriate pelvic rhythm, closed-kinetic chain dorsiflexion of the ankles, flexion of the knees and hips, extension of the thoracic spine, as well as flexion and abduction of the shoulders. There is a scoring system applied to each movement as follows a score of 3 is given to the athlete if they can perform the movement without any compensations, a score of 2 is given to the athlete if they can perform the movement, but operate on poor mechanics and compensatory patterns to achieve the movement, a score of 1 is given to the athlete if they cannot perform the movement pattern even with compensations, and finally, a 0 is given to the athlete if one has pain during any part of the movement or test. Three of the seven fundamental tests including shoulder mobility, trunk stability push-up, and rotary stability have a clearance score associated with them meaning a pass or fail score. If the athlete fails this part of the test a score of 0 is given as the overall score. Once the scoring is complete the athlete and medical professional can review the documentation together and organize a set prevention program to help target and strengthen the areas of weakness to limit the risks of possible injuries.

== Sport injury prevention for children ==
There are approximately 8,000 children treated in emergency rooms each day for sports-related injuries. It is estimated that around 1.35 million children will suffer a sports-related injury per year, worldwide. This is why children and adolescents need special attention and care when participating in sports.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), many sports-related injuries are predictable and preventable. Some prevention techniques are listed below.

* Exercise-based injury prevention has been shown to reduce injury rates in sports. Sport-specific warm-up programs exist which have proven efficacious in reducing injuries of children.
* Warming up before sport improves the blood flow in muscles and allows for the muscle temperature to rise which helps to prevent muscle strains or tears.
* Provide children with the right well-fitting equipment for sports like helmets, shin guards, ankle braces, gloves, and others to prevent injuries.
* Have breaks and drink water as well to keep them hydrated.

== Sports injury prevalence ==
Sports that have a higher incidence of contact and collision have the highest rates of injury. Collisions with the ground, objects, and other players are common, and unexpected dynamic forces on limbs and joints can cause sports injuries. Soccer is the sport leading to the most competitive injuries in NCAA female college athletes. Gymnastics, on the other hand, has the highest injury rate overall. Swimming and diving is the NCAA sport that has the lowest injury rates. Injury rates were much higher for NCAA women&#x27;s sports during competitions rather than practices except for volleyball, indoor track, and swimming and diving. For eight of the NCAA sports, many injuries acquired during competition require at least seven days recovery before returning to the sport. In general, more females are injured during practice than in competition. NCAA athlete injury rates are higher in men&#x27;s ice hockey, basketball, and lacrosse. NCAA athlete injury rates were significantly higher in women&#x27;s cross country than men&#x27;s cross country. The NCAA injury rates are roughly the same for soccer, swimming and diving, tennis, and both indoor and outdoor track and field, regardless of gender.

== Costs ==
Interventions targeted at decreasing the incidence of sports injuries can impact healthcare costs, as well as family and societal resources. Sports injuries have direct and indirect costs. The direct costs are usually calculated by taking into account the cost of using healthcare resources to prevent, detect, and treat injury. There is a need for research about how healthcare is used and the expenses that coincide with it. Included in these expenses are how different injuries may have different prognoses. Indirect costs may be taken into account as well, when an injury prevents an individual from returning to work it may hinder the economic benefit to themselves and others.

For collegiate athletics, the estimated cost of sports injuries ranges from $446 million to $1.5 billion per year. For high school athletics, the yearly estimated cost of sport injuries ranges from $5.4 billion to $19.2 billion. Medical costs in the United States for sports injury-related emergency department visits exceeded $935 million every year.

== Sports-related emotional stress ==
Sports involvement can initiate both physical and mental demands on athletes. Athletes must learn ways to cope with stressors and frustrations that can arise from competition against others. Conducted research shows that levels of anxiety, stress, and depression are elevated following sports injuries. After an occurrence of an injury many athletes display self-esteem issues, athletic identity crises, and high levels of post-traumatic distress, which are linked to avoidant coping skills.

Each year in the United States, 3.5 million athletes are injured; therefore, it is important to understand how injury can impact anxiety. Athletes are exposed to a culture that focuses heavily on success, and injuries can hinder the athlete from reaching their full potential. Because of this reliance on achievement, many players are unlikely to stop performing because of pain they face. An injury could not only impact an athlete&#x27;s ability to train and compete but also influence their psyche and mental health. The external pressure by coaches, teammates, fans, and the media on athletes to endure pain and injury instead of refusing to play when hurt has prompted athletes to believe that accepting physical risks is their only choice. This will in turn lead to both physical and mental struggles for the athlete to endure simultaneously and could lead to a worse outcome if not treated appropriately.

In addition, the influences of personal and situational factors can directly impact an athlete&#x27;s perceptions about their injury. Personal factors include the characteristics of the injury, the athlete&#x27;s approach to their injury, and their identity. Situational factors include the nature of the athlete&#x27;s sport, social influences, and the rehabilitation environment. For example, stressful events such as divorce or employment instability can increase the likelihood of experiencing an injury. An athlete&#x27;s response to an injury is influenced by a variety of stressors they encountered before the injury and the coping skills they used to overcome previous struggles. Therefore, it is important to utilize an integrated model in the rehabilitation process to account for the cognitive, emotional, and behavioral needs of the athletes.

In the rehabilitation process, athletes may experience anxiety as a result of the injury as well as their underlying personal and situational issues. As mental trainer Jeff Troesch mentions, &quot;Recovering from injury can be one of the toughest psychological challenges any athlete faces.&quot; All of the uncertainty surrounding the injury and lacking full control over one&#x27;s body can lead to more anxiety and stress on the athlete. Studies have shown that higher anxiety scores are commonly associated with other comorbidities including depression. In addition, athletes with higher ratings for career dissatisfaction also exhibited higher anxiety scores compared to those who were career satisfied with their career. From these studies it can be inferred that injured athletes experience an increase in anxiety levels as a result of psychosocial factors. Hence, taking these influences into account may assist sports medicine practitioners when planning for the psychological management needs of injured elite athletes.

When addressing psychological readiness during the recovery process, rehabilitation facilities should encourage confidence-building and provide social support to the athletes. Developing confidence in returning to sport includes &quot;having trust in the rehabilitation provider, satisfaction of social support needs, and achievement of physical standards/clinical outcomes.&quot; Social support can operate as a buffer for the amount of anxiety and stress associated with an injury by positively affecting the athlete&#x27;s psychological and emotional wellbeing. In turn, this support can improve the athlete&#x27;s motivation and coping skills during the rehabilitation process. In addition, research suggests that emotional social support, which prioritizes &quot;empathy, love, trust, and caring&quot; can benefit injured athletes psychologically as they recover. With greater emphasis on the psyche, athletes will be more motivated to envision their injury recovery as a new competition or task, rather than a roadblock that hinders them from achieving their dreams.

To accommodate psychosocial factors in recovery, services must be accessible to the athletes. Although many universities provide psychological services to their students, these employees may not be trained in handling athlete-specific factors, and thus may not be able to address the particular needs of injured athletes. Therefore, certified athletic trainers who work with athletes consistently can be an important resource for providing emotional and social support to injured athletes. In previous studies, athletes who were content with the social support they received from their athletic trainers were 87% less likely to report symptoms of depression and anxiety. Thus, such athletic trainers involved in the athlete&#x27;s regular activities can be effective in facilitating psychological interventions during the rehabilitation process.

Currently, mental health struggles are often surrounded by stigma and can be seen as a weakness for high-level athletes. When discussing Kara Goucher&#x27;s openness to sharing her difficulty with negative self-talk and confidence, the author acknowledged that this example is rare in the world of athletics because such struggles are usually considered a weakness. If more athletes like Kara Goucher communicate about their mental health, others will feel more inclined to discuss their issues instead of keeping it to themselves. Therefore, de-stigmatizing and engaging in conversations about mental health can encourage athletes to enlist help for their internal struggles throughout their sports career and during an injury. Mindfulness-based interventions that integrate the mind and body have begun to address mental health needs among high-level athletes. Not only has mindfulness been shown to positively impact general well-being and improve performance, but it could also be utilized as a &quot;protective factor to stress and stress-related psychological issues.&quot; The stigma associated with mental health as a weakness is a common barrier impeding help-seeking behaviors for athletes whose primary goal is to achieve perfection and success in their sport.

Elite athletes dedicate an immense amount of time and effort and can suffer from both physical and mental roadblocks. Therefore, rehabilitation programs must account for mental health as a strong component of the recovery process for athletes, so that they are better prepared to manage not only the physical burden but also the psychological effects of their injury. Understanding the injured athlete&#x27;s experience from a physical, psychological, and social perspective is essential for athletes to return to their sport when they are both physically and mentally prepared and perform at their optimal level.

Many student-athletes do not seek mental health support. Research suggests that only 10% of college athletes with mental health conditions seek support. This means that out of approximately 500,000 college athletes, only 50,000 seek help. Awareness is another challenge of support. In a survey evaluating mental health support for college athletes, 60% of male athletes and 55% of female athletes were not aware of how to find or access mental health support.

<doc id="67886" wikidata="Q1478137" url="?curid=67886" title="Iliotibial band syndrome">
<text>Iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS) is the second most common knee injury, and is caused by inflammation located on the lateral aspect of the knee due to friction between the iliotibial band and the lateral epicondyle of the femur. Pain is felt most commonly on the lateral aspect of the knee and is most intensive at 30 degrees of knee flexion. Risk factors in women include increased hip adduction and knee internal rotation. Risk factors seen in men are increased hip internal rotation and knee adduction. ITB syndrome is most associated with long-distance running, cycling, weight-lifting, and with military training.

== Signs and symptoms ==
ITBS symptoms range from a stinging sensation just above the knee and outside of the knee (lateral side of the knee) joint, to swelling or thickening of the tissue in the area where the band moves over the femur. The stinging sensation just above the knee joint is felt on the outside of the knee or along the entire length of the iliotibial band. At initial symptom onset pain typically occurs following activity, but as the condition progresses pain is frequently felt during activities and may be present at rest. Pain may also be present above and below the knee, where the ITB attaches to the tibia. Pain is frequently worsened by running up or downhill or by stride lengthening.

== Risk factors ==
ITBS is associated with various risk factors including training habits, anatomical abnormalities, or muscular imbalances:

Training habits
* Spending long periods of time/regularly sitting in lotus posture in yoga, especially beginners forcing the feet onto the top of the thighs
* Consistently running on a horizontally banked surface (such as the shoulder of a road or an indoor track) on which the downhill leg is bent slightly inward, causing extreme stretching of the band against the femur
* Inadequate warmup or cool-down
* Excessive uphill and downhill running
* Positioning the feet &quot;toed-in&quot; to an excessive angle when cycling. (Knee should be positioned between 30 and 35 degree to help avoid ITBS)
* Running up and down stairs
* Hiking long distances
* Rowing
* Breaststroke
* Treading water

Abnormalities in leg/feet anatomy
* High or low arches
* Supination of the foot
* Excessive lower-leg rotation due to over-pronation
* Excessive foot-strike force
* Uneven leg lengths
* Bowlegs or tightness about the iliotibial band.

Muscle imbalance
* Weak hip abductor muscles
* Weak/nonfiring multifidus muscle
* Uneven left-right stretching of the band, which could be caused by habits such as sitting cross-legged
==Anatomical mechanism==
Iliotibial band syndrome is one of the leading causes of lateral knee pain in runners. The iliotibial band is a thick band of fascia composing the tendon of the tensor fasciae latae muscle. It is located on the lateral aspect of the knee, extending from the outside of the pelvis, over the hip and knee, and inserting just below the knee. The band serves to stabilize the knee. It has been proposed that during activity such as running and cycling the iliotibial band slides back and forth over the lateral femoral epicondyle, which causes friction and inflammation of the band. It has also been suggested that symptoms are caused by impingement of the iliotibial band in the knee during 30 degree flexion, which is a position common in running and cycling. Additional proposed mechanisms causing the symptoms of ITBS include compression of the fat and soft tissues beneath the iliotibial band, and chronic iliotibial band bursitis.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of iliotibial band syndrome is primarily based on history and physical exam findings, including tenderness at the lateral femoral epicondyle, where the iliotibial band passes over the bone.

=== Differential diagnosis ===
Other conditions that may present with knee pain similar to ITBS that must be differentiated include a lateral meniscus tear, degenerative joint disease, tendinopathy of the biceps femoris, stress fracture, patellofemoral pain syndrome, and injury to the lateral collateral ligament.

=== Exam maneuvers ===
There are several physical exam maneuvers used to test iliotibial band function and provoke symptoms diagnostic of ITBS. The Noble test is used to assess for iliotibial band disfuction, in which the examiner extends the patient&#x27;s knee from the 90 degree position with pain over the lateral femoral epicondyle occurring at 30 degrees of flexion. Additional tests include the Ober test to detect iliotibial band contracture, where the patient lies on their side and the examiner attempts to abduct, extend, and then adduct the leg. A positive test occurs with inability to adduct the leg due to iliotibial band shortening. The Thomas test is used to detect excessive tightness of the iliotibial band. In this test the patient holds the unaffected leg to their chest while the examiner straightens and lowers the other leg to a horizonal position, inability to fully straighten and lower the leg indicates excessive band tightness.
=== Imaging ===
Imaging studies are generally not needed for diagnosis of ITBS, as characteristic symptoms and physical exam findings are sufficient for diagnosis. However, in severe or persistent cases MRI may be used to confirm the diagnosis as well as rule out other causes of lateral knee pain. Ultrasonography may also be used to evaluate disease progression by measuring iliotibial band thickness.

== Treatment ==

=== Conservative treatments ===
While ITBS pain can be acute, the iliotibial band can be treated conservatively with rest, ice, compression and elevation (RICE) to reduce pain and inflammation, followed by stretching. Utilization of corticosteroid injections and the use of oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or topical NSAIDs on the painful area are possible treatments for ITB syndrome. Corticosteroid injections have been shown to decrease running pains significantly 7 days after the initial treatment. Similar results can be found with the use of anti-inflammatory medication, analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication, specifically. Physical therapy is an effective treatment modality, with the goal of stretching the iliotibial band, tensor fasciae latae, and gluteus medius. Other non-invasive treatments include modalities such as flexibility and strength training, neuromuscular/gait training, manual therapy, training volume reduction, myofascial release, or changes in running shoe.  Muscular training of the gluteus maximus and hip external rotators is stressed highly as those muscles are associated with many of the risk factors of ITBS. For runners specifically, neuromuscular/gait training may be needed for success in muscular training interventions to ensure that those trained muscles are used properly in the mechanics of running. Strength training alone will not result in decrease in pain due to ITBS, however, gait training, on its own can result in running form modification that reduces the prevalence of risk factors.

=== Surgical treatments ===
Surgery treatments are utilized if several conservative approaches fail to produce results. 6 months of conservative treatments are generally used before surgical intervention. Surgery typically involves removal of a small piece of the iliotibial band to release excessive tension. Other procedures that have been utilized include resection of the iliotibial band bursa and z-lengthening. In the z-lengthening procedure, two horizontal incisions are made in the band and connected by a vertical incision, forming a z. The resulting sections are reattached together in a lengthened position, increasing the length of the band.

=== Prognosis ===
ITBS symptoms typically improve with treatment. An estimated 50-90% of patients have symptom resolution with 4-8 weeks of conservative treatment, while surgical patients also generally have good outcomes. Complications of ITBS include recurrence and exacerbation by return to activity following treatment, as well as possible progression to patellofemoral pain syndrome.

== Epidemiology ==

=== Occupation ===
ITBS commonly affects athletes and has been reported in runners, cyclists, rowers, skiers, and triathletes, as well as basketball, soccer, and field hockey players.

Significant association between the diagnosis of ITBS and occupational background of the patients has been thoroughly determined. Occupations that require extensive use of the iliotibial band are more susceptible to developing ITBS due to a continuum of their iliotibial band repeatedly abrading against the lateral epicondyle prominence, thereby inducing an inflammatory response. Professional or amateur runners are at high clinical risk of ITBS, and there is a greater risk in those running long-distance. Study suggests ITBS alone makes up 12% of all running-related injuries and 1.6% to 12% of runners are affected by ITBS.

The relationship between ITBS and mortality/morbidity is claimed to be absent. A study showed that coordination variability did not vary significantly between runners with no injury and runners with ITBS. This result elucidates that the runner&#x27;s ability to coordinate themselves toward direction of their intention (motor coordination) is not, or very minorly affected by the pain of ITBS.

Additionally, military trainee in marine boot camps displayed high incidence rate of ITBS. Varying incidence rate of 5.3–22% in basic training was reported in a case study. A report from the U.S. Marine Corps announces that running/overuse-related injuries accounted for &gt;12% of all injuries.

Studies suggest that there is not a difference in ITBS incidence rate between patients of different race, gender, or age. However, there has been a claim that females are more prone to ITBS due to their anatomical differences in the pelvis and lower extremities. Males with a larger lateral epicondyle prominence may also be more susceptible to ITBS.  Higher incidence rate of ITBS has been reported between the ages of 15 and 50, which generally includes most active athletes.

Other professions that had noticeable association with ITBS include cyclists, heavy weightlifters, et cetera. One observational study discovered 24% of 254 cyclists were diagnosed with ITBS within 6 years. A study provided data that shows more than half (50%) of professional cyclists complain of knee pain. Additional studies have shown that ITBS makes up 15–24% of all overuse injuries in cyclists.

== History ==
ITBS was originally described by Lieutenant Commander James W. Renne in 1975 after observing frequent lateral knee pain in recruits participating in intensive military training. He initially named the syndrome &quot;iliotibial band friction syndrome&quot;.

<doc id="67892" wikidata="Q170726" url="?curid=67892" title="Enrico Caruso">
<text>Enrico Caruso (, , ; 25 February 1873 – 2 August 1921) was an Italian operatic first lyric tenor then dramatic tenor. He sang to great acclaim at the major opera houses of Europe and the Americas, appearing in a wide variety of roles that ranged from the lyric to the dramatic. Generally recognized as the first international recording star, Caruso made around 250 commercially released recordings from 1902 to 1920.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Enrico Caruso came from a poor but not destitute background. Born in Naples in the via Santi Giovanni e Paolo n° 7 on 25 February 1873, he was baptised the next day in the adjacent Church of San Giovanni e Paolo. His parents originally came from Piedimonte d&#x27;Alife (now called Piedimonte Matese), in the Province of Caserta in Campania, Southern Italy.

Caruso was the third of seven children and one of only three to survive infancy. For decades, there was a story of Caruso&#x27;s parents having had 21 children, 18 of whom died in infancy. However, on the basis of genealogical research (amongst others conducted by Caruso family friend Guido D&#x27;Onofrio), biographers Pierre Key, Francis Robinson, and Enrico Caruso Jr. and Andrew Farkas, have proven this to be untrue. Caruso himself and his brother Giovanni may have been the source of the exaggerated number. Caruso&#x27;s widow Dorothy also included the story in her best-selling memoir about her husband, published in 1945. She allegedly quoted the tenor, speaking of his mother, Anna Caruso (&quot;née&quot; Baldini): &quot;She had twenty-one children. Twenty boys and one girl – too many. I am number nineteen boy.&quot;

Caruso&#x27;s father, Marcellino, was a mechanic and foundry worker. Initially, Marcellino thought his son should adopt the same trade, and at the age of 11, the boy was apprenticed to a mechanical engineer who constructed and maintained public water fountains. Whenever visiting Naples in future years, Caruso liked to point out a fountain that he had helped to install. Caruso later worked alongside his father at the Meuricoffre factory in Naples. At his mother&#x27;s insistence, he also attended school for a time, receiving a basic education under the tutelage of a local priest. He learned to write in a handsome script and studied technical draftsmanship. During this period he sang in his church choir, and his voice showed enough promise for him to contemplate a possible career in music.

Caruso was encouraged in his early musical ambitions by his mother, who died in 1888. To raise cash for his family, he found work as a street singer in Naples and performed at cafes and soirées. Aged 18, he used the fees he had earned by singing at an Italian resort to buy his first pair of new shoes. His progress as a paid entertainer was interrupted, however, by 45 days of compulsory military service. He completed this in 1894, resuming his voice lessons upon discharge from the army.

===Early career===
On 15 March 1895 at the age of 22, Caruso made his professional stage debut at the Teatro Nuovo in Naples in the now-forgotten opera, &quot;L&#x27;Amico Francesco&quot;, by the amateur composer Mario Morelli. A string of further engagements in provincial opera houses followed, and he received instruction from the conductor and voice teacher Vincenzo Lombardi that improved his high notes and polished his style. Three other prominent Neapolitan singers taught by Lombardi were the baritones Antonio Scotti and Pasquale Amato, both of whom would go on to partner Caruso at the Metropolitan Opera and the tenor Fernando De Lucia, who would also appear at the Met and later sing at Caruso&#x27;s funeral.

Money continued to be in short supply for the young Caruso. One of his first publicity photographs, taken on a visit to Sicily in 1896, depicts him wearing a bedspread draped like a toga since his sole dress shirt was away being laundered.

During the final few years of the 19th century, Caruso performed at a succession of theatres throughout Italy until 1900, when he was rewarded with a contract to sing at La Scala. His La Scala debut occurred on 26 December of that year in the part of Rodolfo in Giacomo Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La bohème&quot; with Arturo Toscanini conducting. Audiences in Monte Carlo, Warsaw and Buenos Aires also heard Caruso sing during this pivotal phase of his career and, in 1899–1900, he appeared before the Tsar and the Russian aristocracy at the Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg and the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow as part of a touring company of first-class Italian singers.

The first major operatic role that Caruso created was Federico in Francesco Cilea&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;arlesiana&quot; (1897); then he was Loris in Umberto Giordano&#x27;s &quot;Fedora&quot; (1898) at the Teatro Lirico, Milan. At that same theatre, he created the role of Maurizio in Francesco Cilea&#x27;s &quot;Adriana Lecouvreur&quot; (1902). Puccini considered casting the young Caruso in the role of Cavaradossi in &quot;Tosca&quot; at its premiere in January 1900, but ultimately chose the older, more established Emilio De Marchi instead. Caruso appeared in the role later that year and Puccini stated that Caruso sang the part better.

Caruso took part in a grand concert at La Scala in February 1901 that Toscanini organised to mark the recent death of Giuseppe Verdi. Among those appearing with him at the concert were two other leading Italian tenors of the day, Francesco Tamagno (the creator of the protagonist&#x27;s role in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Otello&quot;) and Giuseppe Borgatti (the creator of the protagonist&#x27;s role in Giordano&#x27;s &quot;Andrea Chénier&quot;). In December 1901, Caruso made his debut at the San Carlo Opera House in Naples in &quot;L&#x27;Elisir d&#x27;Amore&quot; to a lukewarm reception; two weeks later he appeared as Des Grieux in Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Manon&quot; which was even more coolly received. The indifference of the audiences and harsh critical reviews in his native city hurt him deeply and he vowed never to sing there again. He later said: &quot;I will never again come to Naples to sing; it will only be to eat a plate of spaghetti&quot;. Caruso embarked on his last series of La Scala performances in March 1902, creating the principal tenor part of Federico Loewe in &quot;Germania&quot; by Alberto Franchetti.

A month later, on 11 April, he was engaged by the British Gramophone Company to make his first group of recordings in a Milan hotel room for a fee of 100 pounds sterling. These ten records swiftly became best-sellers. Among other things, they helped spread 29-year-old Caruso&#x27;s fame throughout the English-speaking world. The management of London&#x27;s Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, signed him for a season of appearances in eight different operas ranging from Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Aida&quot; to Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;. His successful debut at Covent Garden occurred on 14 May 1902, as the Duke of Mantua in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Rigoletto&quot;. Covent Garden&#x27;s highest-paid diva, the Australian soprano Nellie Melba, partnered him as Gilda. They would sing together often during the early 1900s. In her memoirs, Melba praised Caruso&#x27;s voice but considered him to be a less sophisticated musician and interpretive artist than Jean de Reszke, the Met&#x27;s star tenor prior to Caruso.

===Metropolitan Opera===
In 1903, Caruso made his debut with the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. The gap between his London and New York engagements had been filled by a series of performances in Italy, Portugal and South America. Caruso&#x27;s contract had been negotiated by his agent, the banker and impresario Pasquale Simonelli. Caruso&#x27;s debut was in a new production of &quot;Rigoletto&quot; on 23 November 1903. This time, Marcella Sembrich sang opposite him as Gilda. A few months later, he began his lifelong association with the Victor Talking Machine Company. He made his first American records on 1 February 1904, having signed a lucrative financial deal with Victor. Thereafter, his recording career ran in tandem with his Met career, both bolstering each other, until his death in 1921.

Caruso purchased the Villa Bellosguardo, a palatial country house near Florence, in 1904. The villa became his retreat away from the pressures of the operatic stage and the grind of travel. Caruso&#x27;s preferred address in New York City was a suite at Manhattan&#x27;s Knickerbocker Hotel. Caruso commissioned the New York jewellers Tiffany &amp; Co. to strike a 24-carat gold medal adorned with the tenor&#x27;s profile. He presented the medal in gratitude to Simonelli as a souvenir of his many well-remunerated performances at the Met.

In addition to his regular New York engagements, Caruso gave recitals and operatic performances in a large number of cities across the United States and sang in Canada. He also continued to sing widely in Europe, appearing again at Covent Garden in 1904–07 and 1913–14, and undertaking a UK tour in 1909. Audiences in France, Belgium, Monaco, Austria, Hungary and Germany also heard him before the outbreak of World War I. In 1909, Melba asked him to participate in her forthcoming tour of Australia, but he declined because of the significant amount of travel time that such a trip would entail.

Members of the Met&#x27;s roster of artists, including Caruso, had visited San Francisco in April 1906 for a series of performances. Following an appearance as Don José in &quot;Carmen&quot; at the city&#x27;s Grand Opera House, a strong jolt awakened Caruso at 5:13 on the morning of the 18th in his suite at the Palace Hotel. He found himself in the middle of the San Francisco earthquake, which led to a series of fires that destroyed most of the city. The Met lost all the sets, costumes and musical instruments that it had brought on tour, but none of the artists were harmed. Holding an autographed photo of President Theodore Roosevelt, Caruso ran from the hotel but was composed enough to walk to the St. Francis Hotel for breakfast. Charlie Olson, the broiler cook, made the tenor bacon and eggs. Apparently, the quake had no effect on Caruso&#x27;s appetite, as he cleaned his plate and tipped Olson $2.50. Caruso made an ultimately successful effort to flee the city, first by boat and then by train. He vowed never to return to San Francisco and kept his word.

In November 1906, Caruso was charged with an indecent act allegedly committed in the monkey house of New York&#x27;s Central Park Zoo. The police accused him of pinching the buttocks of a married woman. Caruso claimed a monkey did the bottom-pinching. He was later found guilty and fined 10 dollars, although evidence suggested that he may have been entrapped by the victim and the arresting officer. Initially, the leaders of New York&#x27;s opera-going high society were outraged by the incident, which received extensive newspaper coverage, but it was soon forgotten and Caruso&#x27;s popularity was unaffected. Caruso&#x27;s fan base at the Met was not restricted, however, to the wealthy. Members of America&#x27;s middle classes also paid to hear him sing—or buy copies of his recordings—and he enjoyed a substantial following among New York&#x27;s 500,000 Italian immigrants.

On 10 December 1910, Caruso created the role of Dick Johnson in the world premiere of Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La fanciulla del West&quot;. The composer wrote the music for Johnson with Caruso&#x27;s voice specifically in mind. Appearing with Caruso were two more of the Met&#x27;s star singers, the Czech soprano Emmy Destinn and baritone Pasquale Amato. Toscanini, then the Met&#x27;s principal conductor, presided in the orchestra pit and Puccini himself, supervised the production.

=== Extortion by Black Hand ===
Caruso&#x27;s success in the Metropolitan Opera drew the attention of Black Hand extortionists. They threatened to injure his throat with lye or harm him and his family if he did not pay them money. He initially paid their extortion fee of $2,000 (US$ in ) expecting the matter to be settled, but his willingness to pay made them more brazen. They subsequently demanded an even larger sum of $15,000 (US$ in ).&quot; He was aided by New York City police detective Joseph Petrosino who, impersonating Caruso, captured the extortionists. Two Italian men, Antonio Misiano and Antonio Cincotto, would be later specifically accused of the crime.

===Later career and personal life===
The timbre of Caruso&#x27;s voice gradually darkened as he aged and by 1916, he began adding heroic tenor parts such as Samson, John of Leyden, and Eléazar to his repertoire. Caruso toured the South American nations of Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil in 1917, and two years later performed in Mexico City. In 1920, he was paid the enormous sum of US$10,000 a night (US$ in ) to sing in Havana, Cuba.

In 1917, the United States entered World War I, sending troops to Europe. Caruso did extensive charity work during the conflict, raising money for many war-related patriotic causes by giving concerts and participating enthusiastically in Liberty Bond drives. The tenor had shown himself to be a shrewd businessman since arriving in America. He put a sizable proportion of his earnings from record royalties and singing fees into a range of investments. Biographer Michael Scott writes that by the end of the war in 1918, Caruso&#x27;s annual income tax bill amounted to $154,000 (US$ in ).

Prior to World War I, Caruso had been romantically linked to an Italian soprano, Ada Giachetti, who was a few years his senior. Though she was already married, Giachetti bore Caruso four sons during their liaison, which lasted from 1897 to 1908. Two survived infancy: Rodolfo Caruso (1898–1951) and singer/actor Enrico Caruso Jr. (1904–1987). Ada had left her husband, manufacturer Gino Botti, and an existing son to cohabit with the tenor. Information provided in Scott&#x27;s biography of Caruso suggests that she was Caruso&#x27;s vocal coach as well as his lover. Statements by Enrico Caruso Jr. in his book tend to substantiate this. Her relationship with Caruso broke down after 11 years and they separated. Giachetti&#x27;s subsequent attempts to sue him for damages were dismissed by the courts.
 

In 1917, Caruso met and courted a 25-year-old socialite, Dorothy Park Benjamin (1893–1955). She was the daughter of Park Benjamin, a wealthy New York patent lawyer and author. In spite of the disapproval of Dorothy&#x27;s father, the couple wed on 20 August 1918. They had a daughter, Gloria Caruso (1919–1999). Dorothy wrote two biographies of Caruso, published in 1928 and 1945. The books include many of Caruso&#x27;s letters to his wife.

A fastidious dresser, Caruso took at least two baths a day and enjoyed good food and convivial company. He forged a particularly close bond with his Met and Covent Garden colleague Antonio Scotti – an amiable and stylish baritone from Naples. Caruso was superstitious and habitually carried several good-luck charms with him when he sang. He played cards for relaxation and sketched friends, other singers, and musicians. His wife, Dorothy, said that by the time she knew him, her husband&#x27;s favourite hobby was compiling scrapbooks. He also amassed valuable collections of rare postage stamps, coins, watches and antique snuffboxes. Caruso was a heavy smoker of strong Egyptian cigarettes. This deleterious habit, combined with a lack of exercise and the punishing schedule of performances that Caruso willingly undertook season after season at the Met, may have contributed to the persistent ill-health which afflicted the last year of his life.

===Illness and death===

On 16 September 1920, Caruso concluded three days of recording sessions at Victor&#x27;s Trinity Church studio in Camden, New Jersey. He recorded several discs, including the &quot;Domine Deus&quot; and &quot;Crucifixus&quot; from the &quot;Petite messe solennelle&quot; by Rossini. These recordings were to be his last.

Dorothy Caruso noted that her husband&#x27;s health began to rapidly decline after he returned from a lengthy North American concert tour in the autumn of 1920. In his biography, Enrico Caruso Jr. points to an on-stage injury suffered by Caruso as the possible trigger of his fatal illness. A scenery malfunction during a performance of Saint-Saëns’ &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; at the Met on December 3rd caused a decorative pillar to fall and hit him on the back, over the left kidney (and not on the chest as popularly reported). A few days before a performance of &quot;Pagliacci&quot; at the Met (Pierre Key says it was 4 December, the day after the &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; injury) he suffered a chill and developed a cough and a &quot;dull pain in his side&quot;. It appeared to be a severe episode of bronchitis. Caruso&#x27;s physician, Philip Horowitz, who usually treated him for migraine headaches with a kind of primitive TENS unit, diagnosed &quot;intercostal neuralgia&quot; and pronounced him fit to appear on stage, although the pain continued to hinder his voice production and movements.

During a performance of &quot;L&#x27;elisir d&#x27;amore&quot; by Donizetti at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on 11 December 1920, he began spitting blood as a result of a mouth or throat haemorrhage and the performance was cancelled at the end of Act 1. Following this incident, a clearly unwell Caruso gave only three more performances at the Met, the final one being as Eléazar in Halévy&#x27;s &quot;La Juive&quot; on 24 December 1920, while suffering acute pain. By Christmas Day, the pain in his side was so excruciating that he was screaming. Dorothy summoned the hotel physician, who gave Caruso some morphine and codeine and called in another doctor, Evan M. Evans. Evans brought in three other doctors, and Caruso finally received a correct diagnosis: purulent pleurisy and empyema.

Caruso&#x27;s health deteriorated further during the new year. He lapsed into a coma and at one point, nearly died of heart failure. He continued to experience episodes of severe pain due to the infection and underwent seven surgical procedures to drain fluid from his chest and lungs. He slowly began to improve and by May 1921, he had recovered sufficiently to sail to Naples to further recuperate from the most serious of the operations, during which part of a rib had been removed. According to Dorothy, he appeared to be continuing with his recovery, but in July he allowed himself to be examined by an unhygienic local doctor. Caruso&#x27;s condition began to deteriorate dramatically after that. The Bastianelli brothers, eminent Italian medical practitioners, examined him and recommended that his left kidney be removed. On the morning of 1 August, Caruso and his entourage left Sorrento for the Bastianelli&#x27;s clinic in Rome, but by the time they reached Naples, Caruso was running a high fever and was gravely ill. The party checked into the Hotel Vesuvio where Caruso began screaming in pain and eventually, a doctor gave him morphine to help him sleep.

Caruso died the following morning at the hotel shortly after 9:00 a.m. local time, on 2 August 1921. He was 48 years old. The Bastianellis attributed the cause of death to peritonitis arising from a burst subphrenic abscess. The King of Italy, Victor Emmanuel III, opened the Royal Basilica of the Church of San Francesco di Paola for Caruso&#x27;s funeral, which was attended by thousands of people. His embalmed body was preserved in a glass sarcophagus at Del Pianto Cemetery in Naples for mourners to view. In 1929, Dorothy Caruso had his coffin covered and permanently sealed in an ornate stone tomb.

==Historical and musical significance==
Caruso&#x27;s career, which lasted from 1895 to 1920, included 863 appearances with the New York Metropolitan Opera (both at the Met and on tour) before his death in 1921 at the age of 48. Thanks largely to his tremendously popular phonograph records, Caruso was one of the most famous entertainment personalities of his day, and his fame has continued to endure to the present. He was one of the first examples of a global media celebrity. Beyond records, Caruso&#x27;s name became familiar to millions throughout the world via newspapers, books, magazines, and the new media technology of the 20th century: cinema, the telephone, and telegraph.

Caruso toured widely both with the Metropolitan Opera touring company and on his own, giving hundreds of performances throughout Europe, and North and South America. He was a client of the noted promoter Edward Bernays, during the latter&#x27;s tenure as a press agent in the United States. Beverly Sills noted in an interview: &quot;I was able to do it with television and radio and media and all kinds of assists. The popularity that Caruso enjoyed without any of this technological assistance is astonishing.&quot;

Caruso biographers Pierre Key, Bruno Zirato and Stanley Jackson attribute Caruso&#x27;s fame not only to his voice and musicianship but also to a keen business sense and an enthusiastic embrace of commercial sound recording, then in its infancy. Many opera singers of Caruso&#x27;s time rejected the phonograph (or gramophone) owing to the low fidelity of early discs. Others, including Adelina Patti, Francesco Tamagno and Nellie Melba, exploited the new technology once they became aware of the financial returns that Caruso was reaping from his initial recording sessions.

Caruso made more than 260 extant recordings in America for the Victor Talking Machine Company (later RCA Victor) from 1904 to 1920, and he and his heirs earned millions of dollars in royalties from the retail sales of these records. He was also heard live from the stage of the Metropolitan Opera House in 1910 when he participated in the first public radio broadcast to be transmitted in the United States.

Caruso also appeared in two motion pictures. In 1918, he played a dual role in the American silent film &quot;My Cousin&quot; (entirely restored in July 2021) for Paramount Pictures. This film included a sequence depicting him on stage performing the aria &quot;Vesti la giubba&quot; from Leoncavallo&#x27;s opera &quot;Pagliacci&quot;. The following year Caruso played a character called Cosimo in another film, &quot;The Splendid Romance&quot;. Producer Jesse Lasky paid Caruso $100,000 (US$ in ) each to appear in these two efforts but &quot;My Cousin&quot; flopped at the box office, and &quot;The Splendid Romance&quot; was apparently never released. Brief candid glimpses of Caruso offstage have been preserved in contemporary newsreel footage.

While Caruso sang at such venues as La Scala in Milan, the Royal Opera House, in London, the Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg, and the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires, he appeared most often at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City, where he was the leading tenor for 18 consecutive seasons. It was at the Met, in 1910, that he created the role of Dick Johnson in Giacomo Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La fanciulla del West&quot;.

Caruso&#x27;s voice extended up to high D-flat in its prime and grew in power and weight as he grew older. At times, his voice took on a dark, almost baritonal colouration. He sang a broad spectrum of roles, ranging from lyric, to spinto, to dramatic parts, in the Italian and French repertoires. In the German repertoire, Caruso sang only two roles, Assad in Karl Goldmark&#x27;s &quot;The Queen of Sheba&quot; and Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Lohengrin&quot;, both of which he performed in Italian in Buenos Aires in 1899 and 1901, respectively.

==Honours==
During his lifetime, Caruso received many orders, decorations, testimonials and other kinds of honours from monarchs, governments and miscellaneous cultural bodies of the various nations in which he sang. He was also the recipient of Italian knighthoods. In 1917, he was elected an honorary member of the Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, the national fraternity for men involved in music, by the fraternity&#x27;s Alpha chapter of the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston. One unusual award bestowed on him was that of &quot;Honorary Captain of the New York Police Force&quot;. In 1960, for his contribution to the recording industry, Caruso received a star located at 6625 Hollywood Boulevard on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Caruso was posthumously awarded a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1987. On 27 February of that same year, the United States Postal Service issued a 22-cent postage stamp in his honour. He was voted into &quot;Gramophone&quot;″s Hall of Fame in 2012.

==Repertoire==

Caruso&#x27;s operatic repertoire consisted primarily of Italian works, along with a few roles in French. He also performed two German operas, Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Lohengrin&quot; and Goldmark&#x27;s &quot;Die Königin von Saba&quot;, singing in Italian, early in his career.

Caruso also had a repertory of more than 500 songs. They ranged from classical compositions to traditional Italian melodies and popular tunes of the day, including a few English-language titles such as George M. Cohan&#x27;s &quot;Over There&quot;, Henry Geehl&#x27;s &quot;For You Alone&quot; and Arthur Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;The Lost Chord&quot;.

==Recordings==

Enrico Caruso died in 1921, before the advent of electrical recording technology in 1925. His entire recorded output was made using the acoustic process, which required the performer to sing into a metal horn or funnel; the sound was relayed directly onto a wax master disc, using a stylus.
This antiquated process captured a limited range of the overtones and nuances present in a singing voice.
Caruso&#x27;s 12 inch disc records were limited to a maximum playing time of approximately four and one half minutes; consequently, most of the operatic selections that he recorded were limited to that duration or those which could be edited to fit this time constraint. Occasionally, longer excerpts were issued on two or more record sides.

Caruso is generally acknowledged as the record industry&#x27;s first major recording star. He possessed a phonogenic voice which was &quot;manly and powerful, yet sweet and lyrical&quot;, to quote the singer/author John Potter (see bibliography below). Caruso and the disc phonograph (known in the United Kingdom as the ) did much to promote each other during the first two decades of the 20th century. From 1902 to 1921, Caruso earned over two million dollars in royalties from the sale of his records. Many of Caruso&#x27;s recordings have remained continuously available since their original issue over a century ago. All of his surviving recordings (including several unissued takes) have been remastered and reissued several times over the years. Although some recordings of complete operas had been undertaken during the early 1900s, Caruso never participated in a complete opera recording. He did, however, take part in a series of recordings for Victor of excerpts from Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; with a unified cast featuring Geraldine Farrar, Marcel Journet, Antonio Scotti and Louise Homer.

Caruso&#x27;s first recordings were arranged by recording pioneer Fred Gaisberg and cut on disc in three separate sessions in Milan during April, November and December 1902. They were made with piano accompaniments for the Gramophone &amp; Typewriter Company Limited, precursor to HMV/EMI. In April 1903, he made seven further recordings, also in Milan, for the Anglo-Italian Commerce Company (AICC). These were originally released on discs bearing the Zonophone label. Three more Milan recordings for AICC followed in October 1903, released by Pathé Records on cylinders as well as on discs. Caruso made one final recording for the Gramophone &amp; Typewriter Ltd in April 1904. On 1 February 1904, Caruso made his first recordings in the United States for the Victor Talking Machine Company and thereafter recorded exclusively for Victor. Caruso&#x27;s American recordings were all made in Victor&#x27;s studios in New York and its headquarters 
in Camden, New Jersey. Some of his later recordings were made in Victor&#x27;s Trinity Church studio, which Victor acquired in 1917 for its acoustical properties and could accommodate larger bands of musicians. Caruso&#x27;s first recordings for Victor in 1904 were made in Room 826, a small vocal studio located in Carnegie Hall in New York. &quot;Questa o quella&quot; and &quot;La donna è mobile&quot; from Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Rigoletto&quot; were the first selections to be recorded. Caruso&#x27;s final recording session took place at Victor&#x27;s Trinity Church studio in Camden on 16 September 1920, with the tenor singing the &quot;Domine Deus&quot; and &quot;Crucifixus&quot; from Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Petite messe solennelle&quot;.

Caruso&#x27;s earliest Victor records of operatic arias from 1904 and 1905, like their thirty or so Milan-made predecessors, were all piano accompanied. From February 1906, however, orchestral accompaniments became the norm, utilizing an ensemble of between eleven and twenty musicians. The regular conductors of these recording sessions with the Victor Orchestra were Walter B. Rogers and, from 1916, Josef Pasternack. Beginning in 1932, RCA Victor in the USA and EMI (HMV) in the UK, reissued several of the Caruso discs with the original accompaniment over-dubbed by a larger electrically recorded orchestra. Earlier experiments using this re-dubbing technique, carried out by Victor in 1927, had been considered unsatisfactory. Although these overdubbed Caruso recordings were initially praised by many critics upon their original release in the 1930s, they are largely vilified by collectors today. In 1950, RCA Victor reissued a number of the tenor&#x27;s recordings on 78-rpm discs pressed on red vinylite instead of the usual shellac. As long-playing discs (LPs) became popular, many of Caruso&#x27;s recordings were electronically enhanced with reverb and similar effects to make them sound &quot;fuller&quot; for release on the extended format. RCA Victor issued its first Caruso collections on LP in 1951; most of these early LP compilations were also simultaneously released on RCA Victor&#x27;s new 45-rpm format. In 1956, RCA Victor issued a limited edition 3 LP Caruso anthology in a deluxe album with an illustrated booklet. By 1959, RCA Victor had reissued more than half of their Caruso catalog on LP records. A few more collections of Caruso recordings previously unavailable on LP were released by RCA Victor during the 1960s. In 1973, to mark the centennial year of Caruso&#x27;s birth, the label issued a 4 record boxed set containing the tenor&#x27;s remaining 59 recordings not previously transferred to LP, including some unpublished items.

During the 1970s, Thomas G. Stockham of the University of Utah developed an early computer reprocessing technique called &quot;Soundstream&quot; to remaster Caruso&#x27;s recordings for RCA. This digital recording process claimed to remove or reduce some of the undesirable resonances and distortion and to reduce surface noise typical of the early acoustically recorded shellac discs (critics of Stockham&#x27;s process later claimed that the recordings were merely &quot;re-equalized&quot; by increasing bass and reducing treble). From 1978 to 1985, RCA issued &quot;The Complete Caruso&quot; series on LP and cassette, utilizing these early digitised recordings (RCA never finished &quot;The Complete Caruso&quot; series on LP and the pre-1906 European and early Victor recordings were never remastered using the Soundstream process). RCA released its first Caruso compact disc, a collection of 21 operatic arias, in 1987. Finally in 1990, a 12 CD boxed set of Caruso&#x27;s complete recordings was issued by RCA Victor (the recordings were repackaged and reissued by RCA again in 2004 and (minus the pre-Victor recordings) for a third time, in 2017). Other complete sets of Caruso&#x27;s recordings in new remasterings were issued on CD on the Pearl label and in 2000–2004 by Naxos. The Pearl and Naxos sets were remastered by the noted American audio-restoration engineer Ward Marston. In 1993, Pearl also released a two-CD collection devoted to RCA and EMI&#x27;s electrically over-dubbed versions of some of Caruso&#x27;s original acoustic discs, originally issued in the 1930s. Since 1999, RCA Victor has issued three CDs of Caruso recordings with digitally recorded over-dubbed orchestral accompaniments. Since the expiration of their original copyrights, Caruso&#x27;s records are now in the public domain in the United States and have been reissued by several different record labels with varying degrees of sound quality. They are also available over the internet as digital downloads. Caruso&#x27;s best-selling downloads at iTunes have been the popular Italian folk songs &quot;Santa Lucia&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

In addition to operatic arias, Caruso recorded many duets and ensembles with several noted opera stars of the period, including Nellie Melba, Geraldine Farrar, Johanna Gadski, Frances Alda, Emmy Destinn, Marcella Sembrich, Alma Gluck, Luisa Tetrazzini, Frieda Hempel, Amelita Galli-Curci, Louise Homer, Ernestine Schumann-Heink, Antonio Scotti, Mario Ancona, Pasquale Amato, Titta Ruffo, Giuseppe De Luca and Marcel Journet.
