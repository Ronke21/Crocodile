<text>Loretta Lorna Sanchez (born January 7, 1960) is an American politician who served in the United States House of Representatives from 1997 to 2017, representing parts of central Orange County, California. A member of the Democratic Party, she was first elected in 1996, when she defeated long-serving Republican U.S. Representative Bob Dornan by fewer than 1,000 votes. During her time in the House of Representatives, Sanchez was a member of the Blue Dog Coalition of moderate-to-conservative Democrats.

Sanchez chose not to run for re-election to the House in 2016, instead opting to run in the state&#x27;s U.S. Senate race. She was defeated in the general election by fellow Democrat, California Attorney General and future U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, 61.6% to 38.4%.

She is the sister of Linda Sánchez, who currently represents in the U.S. House of Representatives.

==Early life and education==
Sanchez was born in Lynwood, California, and graduated from Katella High School in Anaheim in 1978. Her father was a unionized machinist, and her mother worked as a secretary. Her Mexican-immigrant parents had seven children, one of whom—Linda Sánchez—also served in Congress, making them the first (and, , the only) sisters to serve simultaneously in Congress.

Loretta Sanchez joined the United Food and Commercial Workers when she worked as an ice cream server in high school and received a union scholarship to college. She received her undergraduate degree in economics from Chapman College in Orange in 1982, obtained her MBA from American University in Washington, D.C. in 1984, and was a financial analyst for defense contractor Booz Allen Hamilton until entering the House. Sanchez describes herself as growing up a &quot;shy, quiet girl&quot; who did not speak English. She credits government with much of her success in public life.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Committee assignments===
*Committee on Armed Services
**Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations
**Subcommittee on Strategic Forces (Ranking Member)
**Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities
*Committee on Homeland Security
**Subcommittee on Border and Maritime Security
**Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence

===Caucus memberships===
*Congressional Hispanic Caucus
*Congressional Human Rights Caucus
*International Conservation Caucus
*Sportsmen&#x27;s Caucus

===Congressional Hispanic Caucus===

In February 2006, Sanchez withdrew from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus&#x27;s political action committee, along with five other members, because the caucus chairman, Joe Baca, authorized political contributions to members of his family who were running for state and local offices in California.

Sanchez and other CHC members also claim that Baca was improperly elected chairman of the caucus in November 2006 because the vote failed to use secret ballots, as required in the group&#x27;s bylaws. On January 31, 2007, Sanchez quit the CHC because she claimed that Baca repeatedly treated the group&#x27;s female members with disrespect. Other female lawmakers have made the same complaint about Baca. In the election for caucus chairman, only one female member of the 23-member caucus voted to support Baca&#x27;s candidacy.

According to Sanchez, as well as Linda Sánchez (her sister), and Hilda Solis, Baca called Loretta Sanchez &quot;a whore&quot; while speaking to other lawmakers. Baca denied the charge. Politico reported that Sanchez claimed California Assembly Speaker Fabian Núñez heard the comment from Baca and repeated it to Sanchez, yet Núñez claimed not to recall any such comment. Sanchez, however, claimed after the article was published that she had never mentioned Núñez to Politico.

==Political positions==
Sanchez has stated she is a &quot;moderate&quot; Democrat, but in 2009, Sanchez had a &#x27;zero&#x27; approval rating from the American Conservative Union.

She represented a district in Orange County, long a bastion of suburban conservatism, and is a member of the Blue Dog Coalition and the New Democrat Coalition; she reportedly voted with Nancy Pelosi 97.8% of the time during the 111th Congress.

Sanchez is known for her interests in education, crime, economic development, and protections for senior citizens.

&quot;National Journal&quot; rated her votes in 2006 in three areas: Economic, Social, and Foreign. The ratings are: Economic = 71 liberal/28 conservative; Social = 80 liberal/19 conservative; Foreign = 70 liberal/28 conservative.

===Education===
Sanchez staunchly opposed the Republicans&#x27; Head Start program overhaul in the 108th Congress, invoking her experience growing up poor and challenged by a speech impediment. During debate on the bill, she said:

I know about these kids, because I am one of those kids ... It hurts to hear you talk about how we are not successful, or how we are losers. But we are very successful. We have had a lot of successes with Head Start.

Sanchez has asserted that conservative Republicans are not committed to improving public education. When President Bush&#x27;s 2003 budget proposal threatened to cut education grants, she responded:

If he can run deficits for the military, then he can run deficits to educate our children.

===Armed services, social issues, and labor===
Sanchez was the second-ranking Democrat on the Homeland Security Committee and a senior member of the Armed Services Committee, and the most senior woman on that committee. Loretta has fought to reform both the law and culture of the U.S. military relating to investigation of sexual crimes, prosecution of sex offenders and care of sexual assault victims. Her leadership contributed to a decision to examine the problem of sexual assault at the military service academies, which revealed that the problem was much more prevalent than previously thought. As a result, she led the fight to change sexual assault provisions of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. In early 2011, Sanchez introduced a bill requiring the United States Department of Homeland Security to issue rules governing searches and seizures of the laptops, cellphones, and other electronic devices of American citizens returning to the U.S. from abroad.

Sanchez is regarded as a liberal on social issues. She voted against a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage and supports abortion rights. She also sought to reverse the ban on abortions at overseas military bases and installations. In August 2000, Sanchez refused to relocate a political fundraiser she had planned at the Playboy Mansion in California. As a result, Democratic National Committee chairman Joe Andrew cancelled her scheduled speaking role at the Democratic National Convention. Sanchez&#x27;s address was reinstated just before the convention, when she agreed to relocate her fundraiser to Universal Studios.

===Foreign policy===

According to &quot;Congressional Quarterly&quot;, &quot;In 2002, Sanchez voted against reviving fast-track procedures for congressional action on trade deals. And, coming from a district with one of the largest ethnically Vietnamese communities outside Vietnam, she voted against a trade agreement with Vietnam, saying that political and human rights conditions in that country needed improvement. Her outspokenness led the Hanoi regime to refuse to allow her into the country late in 2004 when she applied for an entry visa to meet with dissidents.&quot; By April 2006, Sanchez had been denied a visa to visit Vietnam four times by the country&#x27;s officials. In honor of International Human Rights Day, she joined a bipartisan group of 11 House Members that issued a letter to Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung calling for the release of two U.S. citizens arrested by the government of Vietnam.

On October 10, 2002, Sanchez was among the 133 members of the House who voted against authorizing the invasion of Iraq, but she has voted in favor of every appropriation bill for the war in Iraq. She opposed the troop surge in February 2007. On March 7, 2007, Sanchez led a female congressional delegation to visit troops in Iraq. This was her third visit to Iraq.

Sanchez has a strong record on supporting human rights and is a member of the bipartisan Congressional Human Rights Caucus. Two major votes include voting yes in 2001 to keep the Cuba travel ban until political prisoners are released, but later voting in 2009 to lift the travel ban unilaterally, and yes to acknowledge the Armenian genocide of the early 1900s. She voted to implement the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act of 2007.

Sanchez has stated that she was briefly denied access to a United Airlines flight in October 2006 because her name appeared on a no-fly list set up after the September 11 attacks. Sanchez said she was instructed to check in with a United employee, who told her she was on the terrorist watch list. The employee asked her for identification.

In a December 2015 interview with Larry King, in response to his question about the threat of extremist groups within Islam, Sanchez suggested some experts estimate that &quot;anywhere between 5 and 20 percent&quot; of Muslims worldwide supported the creation of a Caliphate to overthrow the United States. Sanchez&#x27;s comments, which came on the heels of both the recent Islamist terror attack in San Bernardino and 2016 Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump&#x27;s call to temporarily ban Muslim immigration to the United States, were criticized as contributing to Anti-Muslim sentiment. Sanchez explained that she was merely echoing President Obama&#x27;s remarks in his December 6, 2015 Oval Office Address wherein he stated: &quot;Extremist ideology has spread within some Muslim communities. This is a real problem that Muslims must confront, without excuse.&quot; She further noted that she has a well-known record of defending the civil liberties of Muslim groups and that she believed most Muslims &quot;are actually with us&quot; in fighting Islamic extremism.

=== Homeland and cyber security ===
On September 13, 2016, the House Committee on Homeland Security unanimously approved two amendments authored by Sanchez to strengthen counterterrorism and cybersecurity programs.

The first bill, the Community Counterterrorism Preparedness Act, H.R. 5859, &quot;establishes a grant program to help major metropolitan areas prepare for and respond to terror attacks that include active shooters.&quot; Sanchez&#x27;s amendment requires that &quot;unclassified threat information&quot; be provided by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to grant applicants. According to Sanchez, &quot;With this change, we not only provide needed funds to help regions prepare for attacks, we also give them critical tips and best practices to help them respond.&quot;

The second bill, the Cyber Preparedness Act of 2016, H.R. 5459, &quot;clarifies that DHS grants for states and urban areas can be used for similar statewide initiatives.&quot; Sanchez&#x27;s new amendment will increase the use of DHS grants in focusing on identifying threats and improving &quot;cybersecurity sharing dissemination.&quot; According to Sanchez, &quot;Given our increased reliance on cyber technology for commerce and critical infrastructure, and given the increasing sophistication of hackers who would do us harm, we must improve our efforts to identify, neutralize, and prevent cyberattacks.&quot;

=== Water policy ===
In 2009, Loretta Sanchez secured $49.7 million in federal funding for critical water projects in Orange County, including local dam building, water treatment, and conservation projects:

$49,310,000 for the continuing construction of the Santa Ana River Mainstem Project, including the Prado Dam. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers labeled the Santa Ana River the worst flood threat west of the Mississippi River. Federal funding allowed for the construction of a new dam to help mitigate this threat, as well as the potential environmental impact imposed by the dam.

$2.870,000 for the Upper Newport Bay Ecosystem Restoration – Funding for this initiative helped manage sedimentation in the Upper Newport Bay by increasing the capacity of sediment basins, restoring and enhancing estuarine habitats, and improving educational and recreational opportunities.

$426,000 for the Westminster-East Garden Grove Watershed Study in Santa Ana to help the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers undertake a comprehensive study of the Westminster Watershed, to develop a rehabilitation plan for flood control, ecosystem restoration, recreation, and water quality solutions, including the East Garden Grove-Wintersburg Channel and the Bolsa Chica Flood Control Channel. This study helped bolster flood control efforts currently in place, and assisted with ecosystem restoration and overall water quality standards. Both projects were consistent with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers&#x27; flood control and environmental restoration missions in Southern California.

$558,000 for the Orange Country Regional Water Reclamation Project – Also known as the Groundwater Replenishment System (GWRS), this project was a water supply initiative designed to reuse approximately 140,000 acre-feet of treated and recycled waste water every year.

$860,000 for the Westminster/East Garden Grove Watershed Study – Funding helped the Army Corps of Engineers continue its comprehensive study of the Westminster Watershed

$546,000 for the Surfside-Sunset and Newport Beaches – Funding helped mitigate damage along 17 miles of the Orange County coastline that was caused by the construction of federal navigation and flood control works in Long Beach and Anaheim Bay.

$369,000 for a Feasibility Study on the Aliso Creek Mainstem Project – Funding for the project helped to develop a plan to create stable flood plain areas and regenerate native riparian habitats, which resulted in cooler water and improved fish health.

==Political campaigns==

===1994===

Sanchez changed her party affiliation from Republican to Democratic in 1992, ahead of a 1994 campaign for Anaheim City Council. She ran under her married name Loretta Sanchez Brixey, but later dropped her married name because she believed that she and her seven brothers and sisters were better known in the community as the Sanchez family.

===1996===
In 1996, Sanchez ran for the US House in California&#x27;s 46th District against six-term Republican incumbent Bob Dornan. The bitterly fought race saw Sanchez charge that Dornan was out of touch with his constituency, especially after a distracting run for the 1996 Republican presidential nomination. The 46th and its predecessors had always had a Democratic tilt, but became even more Democratic after the 1990 census when it absorbed a considerably larger number of Hispanics than had previously been in the district. Sanchez won by 984 votes, and Dornan contested the election, alleging that many votes were cast by people who were not American citizens. 
A 16-month Congressional investigation found some evidence that 624 votes were indeed cast illegally (of which 84 votes were cast by newly naturalized citizens on the actual date of the election who had registered before their naturalization, which is not allowed under California law). An additional 124 flawed absentee votes had already been thrown out by California officials.

In consultation with the INS, the House investigative panel began with an INS name-matching list of 4,329 individuals with entries in INS computer records, compared to the voter rolls in the 46th Congressional District; and proceeded to use other government records, including claims of non-citizenship to be excused from jury duty, ultimately arriving at a list of 7,841 &quot;suspicious&quot; votes. California&#x27;s Secretary of State and the Orange County District Attorney also investigated a voter-registration group, Hermandad Mexicana Nacional and other alleged voter fraud in Orange County. Local investigators, and eventually the Los Angeles Times, confirmed that Hermandad, an immigration and naturalization service still very active today in both Texas and California, had helped 172 register to vote before their naturalization, under the erroneous belief by some of its employees that as long as someone was naturalized before the date of the election, this was lawful. The Orange County D.A. attempted to indict two employees of the organization, but when a grand jury declined to go along, the local investigation was dropped.

In February 1998 the House Committee on Oversight voted 8–1 to dismiss the matter, ending its investigation. As Federal law required a proportional reduction of vote totals for each candidate, there being no means of determining just which candidate an illegal (or suspected illegal) voter had actually voted for, it was clear the result of the disputed election would not change even if the probe had continued.

The acrimonious disputes between Republicans and Democrats throughout the investigation and a desire not to alienate voters of Hispanic/Latin descent in the forthcoming congressional elections by GOP leaders also seem to have played a role, along with former Rep. Dornan&#x27;s rather abrasive personal style, which the House in general had grown tired of.

Indeed, the supposed total of 624 &#x27;illegal&#x27; votes was bitterly disputed by the Democratic minority, which argued that the investigation had never actually proved that many of the identified voters were in fact non-citizens; indeed asserting that between one quarter to even one half of &quot;illegal&quot; voters &quot;were U.S. citizens at the time they voted in the 1996 election,&quot; although they registered to vote in advance of being sworn in as U.S. Citizens. And that in fact the Oversight Committee&#x27;s suspected illegal voter list still &quot;contain[ed] a significant number of names whose Orange County Voter Records indicate that they were born in the United States...&quot; Despite the lengthy investigation, definitive proof of citizen or non-citizen status, and proof that the actual person still on the suspect voter list was actually the same individual whose name appeared in INS records was lacking for many of the 540 remaining voters, once those determined to have registered too early, before naturalization, were subtracted.

Sanchez became the first member of Congress of Mexican heritage to represent Orange County and was re-elected.

===1998–2008===
In a 1998 rematch, she easily defeated Dornan and would not face another serious contest in a congressional election. Her district was made even safer after the 2000 census, when it was renumbered as the 47th District and reconfigured as a Latino-majority district. During that redistricting process, Sanchez hired lobbyist Michael S. Berman, brother of California Democratic Congressman Howard Berman, for &quot;redistricting consulting&quot; on her behalf. She paid Berman $20,000 for his work.

In 2006, she defeated Tan D. Nguyen (R) with 62% of the vote.

===2003 gubernatorial recall election===

During California&#x27;s 2003 gubernatorial recall election, Sanchez was one of the first Democrats to break from Governor Gray Davis and state that a Democrat should run to succeed Davis in case the recall measure passed. Though she recommended that the Democratic candidate be California&#x27;s senior Senator Dianne Feinstein, Sanchez stated that if no other serious Democratic contender stepped forward, she would be willing to run herself. Many California Democrats ultimately adopted Sanchez&#x27;s position, paving the way for Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante to enter the race.

===2008===

Sanchez won against Republican nominee Rosemarie Avila and American Independent Robert Lauten.

===2010===

Sanchez considered running for governor and for the United States Senate, but declined to enter the gubernatorial race after former governor Jerry Brown declared his candidacy and deferred to incumbent senator Barbara Boxer, who ran for re-election.

Sanchez was challenged by Republican nominee Van Tran and independent candidate Ceci Iglesias. According to &quot;Roll Call&quot;, Sanchez considered running for governor or for the U.S. Senate in 2010. In November 2005, she opened an exploratory committee called People for Loretta 2010. However, in June 2009, she announced she would run for reelection to the House.

In September 2010, Loretta Sanchez appeared on the Spanish language network, Univisión and said that &quot;the Vietnamese and the Republicans are – with an intensity – trying to take away &#x27;our&#x27; seat&quot;, referring to her Vietnamese-born opponent, Van Tran. Sanchez also described Tran as &quot;anti-immigrant&quot;.

===2011===
In September, 2011 Sanchez&#x27;s campaign treasurer, Kinde Durkee, was arrested on suspicion of mail fraud. Sanchez and several others of Durkee&#x27;s clients found their campaign funds wiped out. Sanchez&#x27;s chief of staff, Adrienne Elrod, remarked that &quot;Kinde was someone whose services and counsel we trusted for many years. These charges if true are disheartening and a betrayal by a long time Democratic treasurer for many candidates and committees.&quot;

===2012===

After the 2010 census, Sanchez&#x27; district was renumbered as the 46th district. She was reelected handily, taking 63.9 percent of the vote.

===2016===

On May 16, 2015, when talking to a group of Indian Americans, Sanchez made a gesture mocking Native Americans by making a &quot;war cry&quot; that is stereotypically attributed to them. She described her confusion between Native Americans and Indian Americans prior to a meeting with an Indian-American, saying &quot;I am going to his office, thinking that I am going to meet with a &#x27;woo woo woo woo&#x27; (stereotypical Indian war cry) — Right? ... because he said Indian American.&quot; Many in the audience were shocked at the gesture, finding it offensive. After initially running away from a reporter who tried to question her about it, she apologized for it on May 17, saying &quot;in this crazy and exciting rush of meetings yesterday, I said something offensive and for that, I sincerely apologize.&quot;

Due to Barbara Boxer&#x27;s impending retirement, the 2016 Senate election in California had the first open seat Senate election in California in 24 years. On May 14, 2015, Loretta Sanchez announced her bid for this Senate seat. She competed against Attorney General of California Kamala Harris and thirty-two other candidates in California&#x27;s top-two primary.

On June 7, 2016, Sanchez finished second in the Open Primary and faced fellow Democrat Harris in the general election.

In the June 2016 primary, with results detailed at the county level, Loretta Sanchez won six counties: Fresno, Imperial, Kings, Madera, Orange, and Tulare counties. With the exception of Orange County, these are all counties with a plurality Hispanic population. Of these six counties, the highest vote percentage was Imperial County at 35.4%.

On November 8, 2016, Sanchez lost the U.S. Senate race to Harris. She carried four counties: Fresno, Glenn, Imperial and Madera. She lost her home county, Orange, by seven points. In her concession speech, she stated that &quot;Although we don&#x27;t know what our future will be, I can tell you that this is not the last that people will see of me&quot;.

Despite losing Orange County overall, Sanchez easily won Garden Grove by a 67%-33% margin, her widest margin of victory for a city in Orange County.

In January 2017, Sanchez donated her congressional papers to her alma mater, Chapman University in Orange, California. It encompasses twenty-five boxes of files, papers and committee work which will be available for public view at a later date. Sanchez has been a trustee and regular lecturer at the university.

===2019===
In December 2018, Sanchez announced that she was running for 3rd district Orange County supervisor, in a special election to fill a seat left vacant by Todd Spitzer after his election as the county&#x27;s new district attorney. The election was held on March 12, 2019. Sanchez lost to Irvine mayor Donald P. Wagner but expressed interest in another run for the same seat in the next regular election, in 2020.

==Post-congressional career==
In September 2017, it was announced that Sanchez would be the executive producer of a new political drama show called &quot;Accidental Candidate&quot;, which appeared on NBC. Since leaving the House, she has run unsuccessfully for two local offices in California, the Orange County Board of Supervisors and the Rancho Santiago Community College District as a college trustee.

==Electoral history==































==Personal life==
Sanchez was married for 14 years to stock broker Stephen Brixey before he filed for divorce on January 15, 2004.

In November 2010, &quot;Roll Call&quot; and the &quot;Orange County Register&quot; reported Loretta&#x27;s engagement to retired Army Colonel Jack Einwechter. Einwechter is currently a lawyer practicing in Washington, D.C. The couple were married on July 16, 2011, in a private ceremony in Santa Ana, California.

Loretta&#x27;s father, Ignacio (&quot;Nacho&quot;), suffered from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease since 2001, eventually causing his death in 2018. She appears briefly in the HBO documentary film, &quot;The Alzheimer&#x27;s Project: Caregivers&quot;.

===In popular culture===
The Hispanic Caucus Controversy (see above) was parodied on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; on February 7, 2007.

Loretta Sanchez appeared as herself in the September 10, 2007 episode of &quot;The Closer&quot; entitled &quot;Til Death Do Us Part, Part II&quot;. Within the fictional narrative of the show, she was briefly seen on the program &quot;Larry King Live&quot; being interviewed about a criminal legal case.

===Holiday cards===
While serving as a member of Congress, Sanchez was known for her annual tradition of sending constituents &quot;wacky&quot; &quot;elaborately staged&quot; holiday cards &quot;featuring herself, her family members and her beloved pets.&quot; The cards have &quot;cult status in the world of politics.&quot; She started in 1998 and continued the tradition through at least 2015. Over 500,000 cards were sent in 2014.

<text>Enos Bradsher Slaughter (April 27, 1916 – August 12, 2002), nicknamed &quot;Country&quot;, was an American Major League Baseball (MLB) right fielder. He played for 19 seasons on four major league teams from 1938 to 1942 and 1946 to 1959. He is noted primarily for his playing for the St. Louis Cardinals and famously scored the winning run in Game 7 of the 1946 World Series for the Cardinals. A ten-time All-Star, he has been elected to both the National Baseball Hall of Fame and St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Slaughter was born in Roxboro, North Carolina, where he earned the nickname &quot;Country&quot;. In 1935, scout Billy Southworth signed him for the St. Louis Cardinals.

==Career==
===Minor leagues===
The Martinsville Manufacturers were Slaughter&#x27;s first professional team, in 1935. When Slaughter was a minor leaguer in Columbus, Georgia, he went running towards the dugout from his position in the outfield, slowed down near the infield, and began walking the rest of the way. Manager Eddie Dyer told him, &quot;Son, if you&#x27;re tired, we&#x27;ll try to get you some help.&quot; During the remainder of his major-league career, Slaughter ran everywhere he went on a baseball field. In 1937, he had 245 hits and 147 runs scored for Columbus.

===Major leagues===

Slaughter batted left-handed and threw right-handed. He was renowned for his smooth swing that made him a reliable &quot;contact&quot; hitter. Slaughter had 2,383 hits in his major league career, including 169 home runs, and 1,304 RBI in 2,380 games. Slaughter played 19 seasons with the St. Louis Cardinals, New York Yankees, Kansas City Athletics, and Milwaukee Braves. During that period, he was a ten-time All-Star and played in five World Series. His 1,820 games played ranks fifth in Cardinals&#x27; history behind Yadier Molina, Ozzie Smith, Lou Brock, and Stan Musial. He presently ranks third in RBI with 1,148; sixth in ABs with 6,775; and seventh in doubles with 366.

After debuting with the Cardinals in 1938, Slaughter became an everyday outfielder for them in 1939.

Slaughter served for three years in the Army Air Corps during World War II. He was a sergeant who taught physical education. Slaughter helped set up baseball teams in Tinian and Saipan, and their games inspired the troops while drawing upwards of 20,000 spectators. Immediately upon return from his military service in 1946, Slaughter led the National League with 130 RBI and led the Cardinals to a World Series win over the Boston Red Sox. In the decisive seventh game of that series, Slaughter, running with the pitch, made a famous &quot;Mad Dash&quot; for home from first base on Harry Walker&#x27;s hit in the eighth inning, scoring the winning run after what some reported at the time as a delayed relay throw by the Red Sox&#x27; Johnny Pesky, although the narrative on that play has been placed into serious doubt by numerous baseball historians. Walker&#x27;s hit was ruled a double, although some observers felt it should have been ruled a single, with the throw home allowing Walker to advance to second base. This play was named No. 10 on the Sporting News list of Baseball&#x27;s 25 Greatest Moments in 1999.
Slaughter was known for his hustle, especially for running hard to first base on walks, a habit later imitated by Pete Rose and David Eckstein.
Slaughter was reported at the time as being one of the leaders in racial taunting against the first black major league player, Jackie Robinson, and was accused of conspiring with teammate Terry Moore in an attempt to get the Cardinals to refuse to play Brooklyn with Robinson on the field. Sportswriter Bob Broeg, who covered the team at that time, refutes this claim and says that NL president Ford C. Frick considered the Cardinals fairer towards Robinson than any of the other teams. Slaughter later injured Robinson during a game by inflicting a seven-inch gash from his shoe spikes on Robinson&#x27;s leg. Slaughter denied that he had any animosity towards Robinson, claiming that such allegations had been made against him because he was &quot;a Southern boy&quot;, and that the injury suffered by Robinson had been typical of Slaughter&#x27;s rough playing style. None of the contemporary accounts of the spiking suggested that the incident was intentional, although the August 21, 1947 edition of St. Louis Star and Times quoted Dodgers&#x27; second-baseman Eddie Stanky as saying, &quot;Slaughter deliberately spiked Robinson. I always had the highest regard for Slaughter. He is one of the keenest competitors I know, and I admire him for it. But that was the first time he spiked someone deliberately. I&#x27;ve lost all my respect for him.&quot; In the Ken Burns &quot;Baseball&quot; documentary, it was claimed that Slaughter, despite easily being out, ran and jumped at Robinson, cutting his thigh open. Most other accounts state that the cut was on Robinson&#x27;s calf, and it was non-intentional, that Slaughter&#x27;s spike caught Robinson while he was trying to beat the throw to first and Robinson was just not able to pull his leg away in time.

With the Yankees, Slaughter did not play as much, but he excelled as a pinch hitter for the ballclub. He batted fifth and played in left field in Game 5 of the 1956 World Series in which teammate Don Larsen pitched the only perfect game in World Series history, a 2–0 Yankees win. At age 40, he was the oldest player for either team in the game.

==Post-MLB career==
Slaughter retired from major league baseball in 1959. He was a player-manager for the Houston Buffs of the Texas League in 1960 and for Raleigh Capitals of the Carolina League in 1961. Slaughter coached baseball for Duke University from 1971 to 1977. He provided aid to causes such as the Duke Children&#x27;s Classic, the Person County Museum of History, and Piedmont Community College.

==Personal life==
Slaughter had five wives, each of whom he divorced. He had four daughters: Gaye, Patricia, Rhonda, and Sharon. Henry Slaughter, his cousin, was a well-known southern gospel musician. Slaughter also mentored Lou Brock when he joined the Cardinals.

==Death==
Slaughter died at age 86 on August 12, 2002. He had battled non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and two weeks before his death, he had undergone colon surgery to fix torn stomach ulcers. He was buried at Allensville United Methodist Church in Person County, North Carolina.

==Personal honors==

Slaughter was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in .

His jersey number 9 was retired by the Cardinals on September 6, 1996.

The Cardinals dedicated a statue depicting his famous Mad Dash in 1999. Slaughter was a fixture at statue dedications at Busch Stadium II for other Cardinal Hall of Famers during the last years of his life.

In 2013, the Bob Feller Act of Valor Award honored Slaughter as one of 37 Baseball Hall of Fame members for his service in the United States Army Air Force during World War II.

In January, 2014, the Cardinals announced Slaughter among 22 former players and personnel to be inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum for the inaugural class of 2014.

<text>Andrew Fisher (29 August 186222 October 1928) was an Australian politician and trade unionist who served as the fifth prime minister of Australia from 1908 to 1909, 1910 to 1913 and 1914 to 1915. He held office as the leader of the Australian Labor Party (ALP), and was particularly notable for leading the party to its first federal election victory and first majority government at the 1910 federal election.

Fisher was born in Crosshouse, Ayrshire, Scotland. He left school at a young age to work in the nearby coal mines, becoming secretary of the local branch of the Ayrshire Miners&#x27; Union at the age of 17. Fisher emigrated to Australia in 1885, where he continued his involvement with trade unionism. He settled in Gympie, Queensland, and in 1893 was elected to the Queensland Legislative Assembly as a representative of the Labor Party. Fisher lost his seat in 1896, but returned in 1899 and later that year briefly was a minister in the government of Anderson Dawson.

In 1901, Fisher was elected to the new federal parliament representing the Division of Wide Bay. He was the Minister for Trade and Customs for a few months in 1904, in the short-lived government of Chris Watson. Fisher was elected deputy leader of the ALP in 1905 and replaced Watson as leader in 1907. He initially provided support to the minority government of Protectionist leader Alfred Deakin, but in November 1908 the ALP withdrew its support and Deakin resigned as prime minister. Fisher subsequently formed a minority government of his own. It lasted only a few months, as in June 1909 Deakin returned as prime minister at the head of a new anti-socialist Liberal Party.

Fisher returned as prime minister after the 1910 federal election, which saw Labor attain majority government for the first time in its history. His second government passed wide-ranging reforms – old-age and disability pensions, enshrined new workers&#x27; rights in legislation, established the Commonwealth Bank, oversaw the continued expansion of the Royal Australian Navy, began construction on the Trans-Australian Railway, and formally established what is now the Australian Capital Territory. However, at the 1913 election the ALP narrowly lost its House of Representatives majority to the Liberal Party, with Fisher being replaced as prime minister by Joseph Cook.

After just over a year in office, Cook was forced to call a new election, the first double dissolution. Labor won back its majority in the House, and Fisher returned for a third term as prime minister. During the election campaign he famously declared that Australia would defend Britain &quot;to the last man and the last shilling&quot;. However, he struggled with the demands of Australia&#x27;s participation in World War I and in October 1915 resigned in favour of his deputy Billy Hughes. Fisher subsequently accepted an appointment as the High Commissioner of Australia to the United Kingdom, holding the position from 1916 to 1920. After a brief return to Australia, he retired to London, dying there at the age of 66. His cumulative total of just under five years as prime minister is the second-longest by an ALP leader, surpassed only by Bob Hawke.

==Early life==
===Birth and family background===

Fisher was born on 29 August 1862 in Crosshouse, a mining village west of Kilmarnock, Scotland. He was the second of eight children born to Jane (née Garven or Garvin) and Robert Fisher; he had one older brother, four younger brothers, and two younger sisters. His younger sister died at the age of 10 in 1879, the only one of the siblings not to live to adulthood. Fisher&#x27;s mother was the daughter of a blacksmith and worked as a domestic servant. On his father&#x27;s side, he was descended from a long line of Ayrshire coalminers. According to family tradition, his paternal grandfather was persecuted for his involvement in the fledgling union movement, and on one occasion was left homeless with five young children. Although he was probably only partially literate, Fisher&#x27;s father was prominent in the local community and involved with various community organisations. He was the leader of a temperance society, and in 1863 was one of ten miners who co-founded a cooperative society. He and his family were active members of the Free Church of Scotland.

===Childhood===
Fisher spent most of his childhood living in a miners&#x27; row, which had an earthen floor and no running water. He was kicked in the head by a cow as a small child, leaving him mostly deaf in one ear. The injury may have contributed to a childhood speech impediment and his reserved nature as an adult. As a boy, Fisher and his brothers fished in Carmel Water, a tributary of the River Irvine, and enjoyed long walks across the countryside. He was athletic, helping form a local football team, and stood as an adult, above the average at the time. In later life, Fisher recalled attending four schools as a boy. The exact details are uncertain, but he is known to have finished his schooling in Crosshouse and to have attended a school in nearby Dreghorn for a period. The standard of public education in Scotland was relatively high at the time, and his schoolmaster in Crosshouse had received formal training in Edinburgh; the main focus of the curriculum was on the three Rs. He later supplemented his limited formal education by attending night school in Kilmarnock and reading at the town library.

The exact age at which Fisher left school is uncertain, but he could have been as young as nine or as old as thirteen. He is believed to have begun his working life as a coal trapper, opening and closing the trapdoors that allowed for ventilation and the movement of coal. He was later placed in charge of the pit ponies, and finally took his place performing &quot;pick-and-shovel work&quot; at the coalface. When he was 16, he was promoted to air-pump operator, which required additional training and was seen as a relatively prestigious position. Fisher&#x27;s father had black lung disease, and gave up mining around the same time as his oldest sons began working. He subsequently became the manager of the foodstore at the local cooperative, and the family moved out of miners&#x27; row. They later lived in Kilmaurs for a period, but eventually returned to Crosshouse and leased a small farm. Fisher&#x27;s father then worked as a gardener and apiarist, supplementing his income with contract work repairing the machinery at local mines. He died of lung disease in 1887, aged 53.

=== Early political involvement ===
In 1879, aged 17, Fisher was elected secretary of the Crosshouse branch of the Ayrshire Miners&#x27; Union. He soon came into contact with Keir Hardie, a leading figure in the union and a future leader of the British Labour Party. The pair met frequently to discuss politics and would renew their acquaintance later in life. Fisher and Hardie were leaders of the 1881 Ayrshire miners&#x27; strike, which was widely seen as a failure. The ten-week strike resulted in only a small pay rise rather than the 10 percent that had been asked for; many workers depleted their savings and some cooperatives came close to bankruptcy. Fisher had originally been opposed to the strike, and unsuccessfully attempted to negotiate a compromise with mine-owners. He lost his job, but soon found work at a different mine. Like many miners, Fisher was a supporter of Gladstone&#x27;s Liberal Party, in particular the &quot;Liberal-Labour&quot; candidates who had the support of the unions. In 1884, he chaired a public meeting in Crosshouse in support of the Third Reform Bill. He subsequently wrote a letter to Gladstone and received a reply thanking him for his support. The following year, Fisher was involved in another miners&#x27; strike. He was not only sacked but also blacklisted. He was left with little future in Scotland and decided to emigrate; his older brother John had already left for England a few years earlier, becoming a police constable in Liverpool.

==Immigration to Australia==

Fisher and his younger brother James arrived in Brisbane, Queensland, on 17 August 1885, after a two-month steamship journey from London. He first saw Australia during a stopover at Thursday Island, where whites were a minority and there was a large Japanese population. His biographer David Day has speculated that this initial first impression may have contributed to his later opposition to non-white immigration. Fisher&#x27;s path to Australia was virtually identical to that of Billy Hughes, who had arrived less than a year earlier in December 1884 – both men took assisted passage, arrived at the age of 22, and travelled from London to Brisbane. Unlike Hughes, Fisher never lost his original accent and retained a thick Scottish &quot;brogue&quot; for the rest of his life.

After arriving in Brisbane, Fisher made his way to the Burrum River coalfields where there were already a number of Scottish miners. He began as an ordinary miner and joined the local miners&#x27; union, but after successfully sinking a new shaft at Torbanlea, he was employed as a mine manager. Prospering financially for the first time in his life, he built a timber cottage at Howard and began investing in shares. Fisher moved to the larger gold-mining town of Gympie in 1888, initially working in the No. 1 North Phoenix mine and then in the South Great Eastern Extended. He continued his involvement in unionism, helping form the Gympie branch of the Amalgamated Miners&#x27; Association (AMA) and serving terms as secretary and president. He obtained an engine-driver&#x27;s certificate in 1891, and was elected president of the related craft union. This new job allowed him to work above-ground, operating the machinery that raised and lowered the cages in the mineshaft. During his time in Gympie, Fisher stayed in a boardinghouse in Red Hill; it is now heritage-listed as &quot;Andrew Fisher&#x27;s Cottage&quot;. He would eventually marry his landlady&#x27;s daughter, Margaret Irvine.

Within years of arriving in the town, Fisher had become &quot;an important figure in the Gympie labour movement, straddling both its political and industrial wings&quot;. He was a founding member of the Gympie cooperative, and in 1891 became the secretary of the Gympie Joint Labour Committee, the local labour council. He helped establish a branch of the Workers&#x27; Political Association, the forerunner of the Labor Party, and was the inaugural branch president with George Ryland as secretary. In 1892, he represented Gympie at the Labour-in-Politics Convention in Brisbane. He was sacked from his engine-driving job in the same year, and subsequently devoted his full attention to politics.

== Early political career ==

=== Queensland politics ===

In 1891, Fisher was elected as the first president of the Gympie branch of the Labour Party. In 1893, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Queensland as Labour member for the Electoral district of Gympie and by the following year had become Labour&#x27;s deputy leader in the Legislative Assembly. In his maiden speech, he pushed for a 50% decrease in military spending and declared support for a federation. He was also active in the Amalgamated Miners Union, becoming President of the Gympie branch by 1891. Another policy area that captured his attention during this term, was the employment of workers from the Pacific Islands in sugar plantations, a practice that Fisher and Labour both strongly opposed. He lost his seat in 1896 following a campaign in which he was charged by his opponent Jacob Stumm with being a dangerous revolutionary and an anti-Catholic, accusations that were propagated by the newspaper &quot;Gympie Times&quot;.

The 1896 establishment of the &quot;Gympie Truth&quot;, a newspaper that he was to partly own, was part of his response. Intended as a medium to broadcast Labour&#x27;s message, the newspaper played a vital role in Fisher&#x27;s return to parliament in 1899. This time, he was the beneficiary of a scare campaign, in which conservative candidate Francis Power was consistently painted by the &quot;Gympie Truth&quot; as being a supporter of black labour and the alleged economic and social ills that accompanied it. In that year he was Secretary for Railways and Public Works in the seven-day government of Anderson Dawson, the first parliamentary Labour government in the world.

=== Federal politics ===

The state Labour parties and their MPs were mixed in their support for the Federation of Australia. However Fisher was a firm believer in federation, supporting the union of the Australian colonies and campaigned for the &#x27;Yes&#x27; vote in Queensland&#x27;s 1899 referendum. Fisher stood for the Division of Wide Bay at the inaugural 1901 Australian federal election and won the seat, which he held continuously for the rest of his political career. At the end of 1901, Fisher married Margaret Irvine, his previous landlady&#x27;s daughter.

Fisher supported the White Australia policy but also argued that any Kanaka who had converted to Christianity and married should be allowed to remain in Australia.

Labour improved their position at the 1903 election, gaining enough seats to be on par with the other two, a legislative time colloquially known as the &quot;three elevens&quot;. When the Deakin government resigned in 1904, George Reid of the Free Trade Party declined to take office, resulting in Labour taking power and Chris Watson becoming Labour&#x27;s first prime minister for a four-month period in 1904. Fisher established and demonstrated his ministerial capabilities as Minister for Trade and Customs in the Watson Ministry. The fourth Labour member in the ministry after Watson, Hughes, and Lee Batchelor, Fisher was promoted to Deputy Leader of the Labour Party in 1905.
George Reid adopted a strategy of trying to reorient the party system along Labour vs non-Labour lines – prior to the 1906 election, he renamed his Free Trade Party to the Anti-Socialist Party. Reid envisaged a spectrum running from socialist to anti-socialist, with the Protectionist Party in the middle. This attempt struck a chord with politicians who were steeped in the Westminster tradition and regarded a two-party system as very much the norm.

=== Party leader ===
At the 1906 election, Deakin remained prime minister even though Labour gained considerably more seats than the Protectionists. When Watson resigned in 1907, Fisher succeeded him as Labour leader, although Hughes and William Spence also stood for the position. Fisher was considered to have a better understanding of economic matters, was better at handling caucus, had better relations with the party organisation and the unions, and was more in touch with party opinion. He did not share Hughes&#x27; passion for free trade or that of Watson and Hughes for defence (and later conscription). In political terms he was a radical, on the left-wing of his party, with a strong sense of Labour&#x27;s part in British working-class history.

At the 1908 Labour Federal Conference, Fisher argued for female representation in parliament:

With a majority of seats in the Labour-Protectionist government, Labour caucus by early 1908 had become restive as to the future of the Deakin minority government. With the Deakin ministry in trouble, Deakin spoke to Fisher and Watson about a possible coalition, and following a report agreed to it providing Labour had a majority in cabinet, that there was immediate legislation for old-age pensions, that New Protection was carried and that at the following election the government would promise a progressive land tax. No coalition was formed, however the pressure from Labour brought about productive change by Deakin: he agreed to a royal commission into the post office, old-age pensions were to be provided from the surplus revenue fund and £250,000 set aside for ships for an Australian Navy. New Protection was declared invalid by the High Court in June, Fisher found the tariff proposals of Deakin unsatisfactory, while caucus was also dissatisfied with the old-age pension proposals. Without Labour support the Deakin government collapsed in November 1908.

During the parliamentary ballots that selected Yass-Canberra as the site of the national capital, in October 1908, Fisher voted consistently for Dalgety.

==Prime Ministership==

===First term (1908–1909)===

Fisher formed his only minority government and the First Fisher Ministry. The government passed the Seat of Government Act 1908, providing for the new federal capital to be in the Yass-Canberra area, passed the Manufacturers&#x27; Encouragement Act to provide bounties for iron and steel manufacturers who paid fair and reasonable wages, ordered three torpedo boat destroyers, and assumed local naval defence responsibility and placed the Australian Navy at the disposal of the Royal Navy in wartime.

Fisher committed Labour to amending the Constitution to give the Commonwealth power over labour, wages and prices, to expanding the navy and providing compulsory military training for youths, to extending pensions, to a land tax, to the construction of a transcontinental railway, to the replacement of pound sterling with Australian currency and to tariffs to protect the sugar industry. In May 1909, the more conservative Protectionists and Freetraders merged to form the Commonwealth Liberal Party, while the more liberal Protectionists joined Labour. With a majority of seats, the CLP led by Alfred Deakin ousted Labour from office, with Fisher failing to persuade the Governor-General Lord Dudley to dissolve Parliament.

===Second term (1910–1913)===

At the 1910 election, Labour gained sixteen additional seats to hold a total of forty-two of the seventy-five House of Representatives&#x27; seats, and all eighteen Senate seats up for election to hold a total of twenty-two out of thirty-six seats. This gave Labour control of both upper and lower houses and enabled Fisher to form his Second Fisher Ministry, Australia&#x27;s first elected federal majority government, Australia&#x27;s first elected Senate majority, and the world&#x27;s first Labour Party majority government. The 113 acts passed in the three years of the second Fisher government exceeded even the output of the second Deakin government over a similar period.

According to Labor MP and historian Denis Murphy, the second Fisher government represented &quot;the culmination of Labor&#x27;s involvement in politics&quot;, and was &quot;a period of reform unmatched in the Commonwealth until the 1940s&quot;, under John Curtin and Ben Chifley. The Fisher government carried out many reforms in defence, finance, transport and communications, and social security, achieving the vast majority of their aims in just three years of government. These included extending old-age and disability pensions, introducing a maternity allowance and issuing Australia&#x27;s first paper currency, forming the Royal Australian Navy, the start of construction of the Trans-Australian Railway, expanding the bench of the High Court of Australia, the founding of Canberra, and the establishment of the state-owned Commonwealth Bank. Fisher&#x27;s second government also introduced uniform postal charges throughout Australia, carried out measures to break up land monopolies, put forward proposals for closer regulation of working hours, wages and employment conditions, and amended the 1904 Conciliation and Arbitration Act to provide greater authority for the court president, and to allow for Commonwealth employees&#x27; industrial unions, registered with the Arbitration Court.

A land tax, aimed at breaking up big estates and give wider scope for small-scale farming, was also introduced, while coverage of the Arbitration system was extended to agricultural workers, domestics, and federal public servants. In addition, the age at which women became entitled to the old-age pension was lowered from sixty-five to sixty. The introduction of the maternity allowance was a major reform, because it enabled more births to be attended by doctors, thus leading to reductions in infant mortality rates. However, the maternity allowance was only available to white women, with the legislation barring &quot;women who are Asiatic, or are aboriginal natives of Australia, Papua or the Pacific Islands&quot; in line with the racial exclusions in the old-age pension. Compulsory preference to trade unionists in federal employment was also introduced, while the Seaman&#x27;s Compensation Act of 1911 and the Navigation Act of 1912 were enacted to improve conditions for those working at sea, together with compensatory arrangements for seamen and next of kin. Eligibility for pensions was also widened. From December 1912 onwards, naturalised residents no longer had to wait three years to be eligible for a pension. That same year, the value of a pensioner&#x27;s home was excluded from consideration when assessing the value of their property.
Fisher wanted additional Commonwealth power in certain areas, such as the nationalisation of monopolies. A constitutional referendum was initiated in 1911 which aimed to increase the federal government&#x27;s legislative powers over trade and commerce and over monopolies. Both questions were defeated, with around 61 per cent voting &#x27;No&#x27;. The Fisher government made another attempt, holding a referendum in 1913 which asked for greater federal powers over trade and commerce, corporations, industrial matters, trusts, monopolies, and railway disputes. All six questions were defeated, with around 51 per cent voting &#x27;No&#x27;. At the 1913 election, the Commonwealth Liberal Party, led by Joseph Cook, defeated the Labor Party by a single seat.

===Third term (1914–1915)===
Labor retained control of the Australian Senate despite defeat. In 1914, Cook, frustrated by the Labor-controlled Senate&#x27;s rejection of his legislation, recommended to the new Governor-General Sir Ronald Munro Ferguson that both houses of the parliament be dissolved and elections called. This was Australia&#x27;s first double dissolution election, and the only one until the 1951 election. The First World War had broken out in the middle of the 1914 election campaign, with both sides committing Australia to the British Empire. Fisher campaigned on Labor&#x27;s record of support for an independent Australian defence force, and pledged that Australia would &quot;stand beside the mother country to help and defend her to the last man and the last shilling&quot;. Labor won the election with another absolute majority in both houses and Fisher formed his third government on 17 September 1914.
Fisher and his party were immediately underway in organising urgent defence measures for planning and implementing Australian war effort. Fisher visited New Zealand during this time which saw Billy Hughes serve as acting prime minister for two months. Fisher and Labor continued to implement promised peacetime legislation, including the &quot;River Murray Waters Act 1915&quot;, the &quot;Freight Arrangements Act 1915&quot;, the &quot;Sugar Purchase Act 1915&quot;, the &quot;Estate Duty Assessment&quot; and the &quot;Estate Duty&quot; acts in 1914. Wartime legislation in 1914 and 1915 included the &quot;War Precautions&quot; acts (giving the Governor-General power to make regulations for national security), a &quot;Trading with the Enemy Act&quot;, &quot;War Census&quot; acts, a &quot;Crimes Act&quot;, a &quot;Belgium Grant Act&quot;, and an &quot;Enemy Contracts Annulment Act&quot;. In December 1914, a War Pensions Act was passed to provide for the grant of Pensions upon the death or incapacity of Members of the Defence Force of the Commonwealth and Members of the Imperial Reserve Forces residents in Australia whose death or incapacity resulted from their employment in connection with warlike operations.

In October 1915, journalist Keith Murdoch reported on the situation in Gallipoli at Fisher&#x27;s request, and advised him, &quot;Your fears have been justified&quot;. He described the Dardanelles Expedition as being &quot;a series of disastrous underestimations&quot; and &quot;one of the most terrible chapters in our history&quot; concluding: &quot;What I want to say to you now very seriously is that the continuous and ghastly bungling over the Dardanelles enterprise was to be expected from such a general staff as the British Army possesses ... the conceit and self complacency of the red feather men are equalled only by their incapacity.&quot;
Fisher passed this report on to Hughes and to Defence Minister George Pearce, ultimately leading to the evacuation of the Australian troops in December 1915. The report was also used by the Dardanelles Commission on which Fisher served, while High Commissioner in London.

Fisher resigned as prime minister and from Parliament on 27 October 1915 after being absent from parliament without explanation for three sitting days. Three days later, Labor Caucus unanimously elected Billy Hughes leader of the Federal Parliamentary Party. Fisher&#x27;s seat was narrowly won by the Commonwealth Liberal Party on a 0.2% margin at the 1915 Wide Bay by-election.

==High Commissioner to the United Kingdom==

Fisher was Australia&#x27;s second High Commissioner to the United Kingdom from 1 January 1916 until 1 January 1921. Fisher opposed conscription which made his dealings with Billy Hughes difficult. Hughes asked Fisher for support by cable three weeks before the first referendum, but Fisher cabled back &quot;Am unable to sign appeal. Position forbids.&quot; He subsequently refused to publicly comment on the issue. Hughes&#x27; 1916 referendum on conscription had a No vote of around 52 per cent, while the 1917 referendum had a No vote of around 54 per cent. Fisher visited Australian troops serving in Belgium and France in 1919, and later presented Pearce with an album of battlefield photos from 1917 and 1918, showing the horrendous conditions experienced by the troops.

The Dardanelles Commission, including Fisher, interviewed witnesses in 1916 and 1917 and issued its final report in 1919. It concluded that the expedition was poorly planned and executed and that difficulties had been underestimated, problems which were exacerbated by supply shortages and by personality clashes and procrastination at high levels. Some 480,000 Allied troops had been dedicated to the failed campaign, with around half in casualties. The report&#x27;s conclusions were regarded as insipid with no figures (political or military) heavily censured. The report of the commission and information gathered by the inquiry remain a key source of documents on the campaign.

==Final years and death==

Fisher&#x27;s term as High Commissioner officially ended on 22 April 1921, although it concluded with three months&#x27; paid leave and he left for Australia on 29 January. He arrived back in Melbourne with no firm plans for his future, but the rapturous receptions he received at labour movement gatherings led him to contemplate a return to active politics. He was the only remaining former prime minister in the Labor Party, which had lost many experienced MPs in the 1916 party split. The party&#x27;s leader Frank Tudor had had frequent bouts of ill health, and T. J. Ryan, who was widely seen as Tudor&#x27;s heir apparent, died suddenly of pneumonia in August 1921. Fisher seriously considered standing in the resulting by-election, but found there was no guarantee that the local party would accept him as a candidate. He was unwilling to actively campaign for preselection, and decided he would only stand if he were drafted, which did not happen.

With little else to keep them in Australia, Fisher and his wife decided to return to London to be closer to their children. They rented a property in Highgate for a period, and then in October 1922 bought a home on South Hill Park near Hampstead Heath. He explored the possibility of standing for the British House of Commons, but eventually opted for a permanent retirement from politics. By the time he was 60, Fisher&#x27;s family and friends had begun to notice a decline in his mental faculties, which was probably a form of early-onset dementia. It was judged unsafe for him to be out alone in public, and in 1925 his assets were placed in trust. By 1928, he was unable to sign his own name, and his children were seriously considering having him institutionalised. Fisher contracted a severe case of influenza in September 1928, and eventually died from complications of the disease on 22 October, aged 66. He is one of only three Australian prime ministers to die overseas, and he and George Reid are the only ones who both began and ended their lives outside Australia.

Fisher was buried at Hampstead Cemetery on 26 October 1928. On the same day, a memorial service was held at St Columba&#x27;s Church, London, which was attended by representatives of King George V and Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, as well as Arthur Henderson representing the British Labour Party. In February 1930, Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald unveiled a granite obelisk above Fisher&#x27;s grave. His widow eventually moved back to Australia, dying there in 1958.

==Evaluation==
Despite the length of Fisher&#x27;s service as prime minister, for many years he and his government were given relatively little scholarly attention. His decision to retire to England placed him out of the public eye, while his mental deterioration and early death deprived him of the opportunity to dictate his own legacy. Writers interested in the post-Federation era did not generally view him as an attractive biographical subject, which has been attributed to the relative orthodoxy of his political views and a reputation for propriety to the point of dullness. Fisher&#x27;s 1981 entry in the &quot;Australian Dictionary of Biography&quot; was written by Denis Murphy, who had planned a full-length biography but died in 1984 before completing it. Clem Lloyd also began a biography in the 1990s, which was unfinished at the time of his death in 2001. The first complete biographies of Fisher did not emerge until the 100th anniversary of his prime ministership. These were David Day&#x27;s &quot;Andrew Fisher: Prime Minister of Australia&quot; (2008) and Peter Bastian&#x27;s &quot;Andrew Fisher: An Underestimated Man&quot; (2009), as well as a shorter volume by Edward Humphreys, &quot;Andrew Fisher: The Forgotten Man&quot; (2008).

Obituarists of Fisher generally emphasised his modesty, integrity, and dedication to the labour movement. Writing for &quot;The Australian Worker&quot;, Henry Ernest Boote praised him as &quot;loyal to his class, courageous in the advocacy of their cause, and absolutely incorruptible&quot;. In the decades after his death, a general view emerged of Fisher as a competent rather than brilliant leader. He was praised for successfully managing the conflicting personalities within his own party, but as a leader of his country was often compared unfavourably with Deakin and Hughes. In general, his prime ministership was seen as a relatively inconsequential interlude. However, beginning in the 1970s a different view of Fisher began to emerge, which coincided with more of his personal papers becoming available to researchers. His more recent biographers have credited Fisher with establishing Labor as a viable party of government and demonstrating that the party&#x27;s platform did not have to be sacrificed for political expediency, and argued that he deserves the primary credit for the political and electoral accomplishments of his governments. He is now generally seen as one of the most significant figures in the early years of his party.

==Honours==
At the end of the First World War, France awarded him the Légion d&#x27;honneur, but he declined it; he did not like decorations of any kind and adhered to this view throughout his life. In 1911 Fisher declined the offer of honorary degrees from the universities of Oxford, Cambridge, Glasgow and Birmingham, although he did accept the Freedom of the City from the cities of Glasgow, Edinburgh and Bristol.

Another honour Fisher did accept was appointment to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom on his visit to the UK in 1911 for the Coronation of King George V and the Imperial Conference at the same time as New Zealand Prime Minister Sir Joseph Ward and Governor Lord Islington, granting him use of &quot;The Right Honourable&quot;. Public reaction to his appointment was positive, with the &quot;Brisbane Truth&quot; noting it would not change his humble nature: &quot;To plain Andrew Fisher, who lately refused to-be decorated with empty, unearned University degrees, a Privy Councillorship has been awarded. This is an honor to which our Prime Minister is justly entitled by reason of his inclusion in the secret councils of the Imperial Conference, which secrets include the private advice, tendered by him to the administrators of and in the administration of his Majesty&#x27;s Imperial Government.&quot; Although admitted as a Privy Counsellor &quot;in absentia&quot; on 6 July 1911, it wasn&#x27;t until 14 February 1916 when he was High Commissioner in London that he formally took his oath of office.

The federal electorate of Fisher was named after him. A Canberra suburb, Fisher, was also created in his memory, with its streets reflecting a mining theme in honour of Fisher&#x27;s occupation before entering public life. Ramsay MacDonald, Britain&#x27;s first Labour Prime Minister, unveiled a memorial to Fisher in Hampstead Cemetery in 1930. A memorial garden was also dedicated to Fisher at his birthplace in the late 1970s.

In 1972 he was honoured on a postage stamp bearing his portrait issued by Australia Post. In 1992, his home in Gympie (Andrew Fisher&#x27;s Cottage) was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register. In 2008, Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, a fellow Queenslander, launched a biography titled &quot;Andrew Fisher&quot;, written by David Day. In turn, Rudd was presented with an item that once belonged to Fisher – a slightly battered gold pen engraved with Fisher&#x27;s signature, which had been held in safekeeping for 80 years.

<text>Sir Richard le Breton or Richard de Brito (fl. 1170) was one of the four knights who in 1170 murdered Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury.

==Origins==
Roger Brito is listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as holding land under the overlordship of the Church of Long Sutton in Somerset, in which county the family was later seated at Sampford Brett (&quot;alias&quot; Sandford-Bret). During the reign of King Henry I (1100–1135) Sampford Brett was held by Simon le Bret, from the feudal barony of Dunster by military service of half a knight&#x27;s fee. He served in the household of Henry II&#x27;s brother William, Count of Poitou and was a near neighbour of the FitzUrse family of Williton in Somerset, a member of which family was another of the assassins of Thomas Becket. Simon le Bret had two sons: Richard Brito, one of the assassins of Thomas Becket and Edmund le Bret, who adopted the surname &quot;de Sandford&quot; from his seat. William the Conqueror granted a manor in the eastern part of the parish of Great Stambridge in Essex and another in Sanford in Somerset to a Norman named Auvrai Le Breton following the Norman conquest of England. A later relative, Simon Le Breton, had two sons, Richard and Edmund, who inherited their share of Sanford and Great Master Bridge. Both were part of the royal court of King Henry II; in particular Richard Le Breton was a close friend of the king&#x27;s brother, Prince William.

==Becket assassination==
During the attack on Becket in 1170 by the four knights, Sir Reginald Fitzurse, Sir Hugh de Morville, Brito and Sir William de Tracy, Brito is said to have broken his sword when striking at Becket&#x27;s head.

According to Edward Grim:
He shouted &quot;Take that, for the love of my lord William, the king&#x27;s brother!&quot; when he delivered the fatal blow. It was believed by William&#x27;s friends that the count had died of a broken heart after Thomas Becket refused to allow his marriage.

==Aftermath==
After the assassination the four knights fled to Scotland and from there to Knaresborough Castle in Yorkshire. All four were excommunicated by the Pope Alexander III at Easter in 1171 and ordered to undertake penitentiary pilgrimages to the Holy Land for 14 years.

Brito eventually retired to the island of Jersey. A ledger stone for one of the le Bretons of Jersey survives in St Thomas&#x27;s Church in Salisbury. The Brett family of Whitestaunton in Somerset are said by the Duchess of Cleveland to be descended from the Brettes of Sampford Brett, and are the ancestors of the present Brett family, Viscounts Esher.

<text>Jackson structured programming (JSP) is a method for structured programming developed by British software consultant Michael A. Jackson and was described in his 1975 book &quot;Principles of Program Design&quot;. The technique of JSP is to analyze the data structures of the files that a program must read as input and produce as output, and then produce a program design based on those data structures, so that the program control structure handles those data structures in a natural and intuitive way.

JSP describes structures (of both data and programs) using three basic structures – sequence, iteration, and selection (or alternatives). These structures are diagrammed as (in effect) a visual representation of a regular expression.

== Introduction ==
Michael A. Jackson originally developed JSP in the 1970s. He documented the system in his 1975 book &quot;Principles of Program Design&quot;. In a 2001 conference talk, he provided a retrospective analysis of the original driving forces behind the method, and related it to subsequent software engineering developments. Jackson&#x27;s aim was to make COBOL batch file processing programs easier to modify and maintain, but the method can be used to design programs for any programming language that has structured control constructs— sequence, iteration, and selection (&quot;if/then/else&quot;).

Jackson Structured Programming was similar to Warnier/Orr structured programming although JSP considered both input and output data structures while the Warnier/Orr method focused almost exclusively on the structure of the output stream.

== Motivation for the method ==
At the time that JSP was developed, most programs were batch COBOL programs that processed sequential files stored on tape. A typical program read through its input file as a sequence of records, so that all programs had the same structure— a single main loop that processed all of the records in the file, one at a time. Jackson asserted that this program structure was almost always wrong, and encouraged programmers to look for more complex data structures. In Chapter 3 of &quot;Principles of Program Design&quot; Jackson presents two versions of a program, one designed using JSP, the other using the traditional single-loop structure. Here is his example, translated from COBOL into Java. The purpose of these two programs is to recognize groups of repeated records (lines) in a sorted file, and to produce an output file listing each record and the number of times that it occurs in the file.

Here is the traditional, single-loop version of the program.
String line;
int count = 0;
String firstLineOfGroup = null;

// begin single main loop
while ((line = in.readLine()) != null) {
 if (firstLineOfGroup == null || !line.equals(firstLineOfGroup)) {
 if (firstLineOfGroup != null) {
 System.out.println(firstLineOfGroup + &quot; &quot; + count);
 count = 0;
 firstLineOfGroup = line;
 count++;
if (firstLineOfGroup != null) {
 System.out.println(firstLineOfGroup + &quot; &quot; + count);


Here is a JSP-style version of the same program. Note that (unlike the traditional program) it has two loops, one nested inside the other. The outer loop processes groups of repeating records, while the inner loop processes the individual records in a group.

String line;
int numberOfLinesInGroup;

line = in.readLine();
// begin outer loop: process 1 group
while (line != null) { 
 numberOfLinesInGroup = 0;
 String firstLineOfGroup = line;

 // begin inner loop: process 1 record in the group
 while (line != null &amp;&amp; line.equals(firstLineOfGroup)) {
 numberOfLinesInGroup++;
 line = in.readLine();
 System.out.println(firstLineOfGroup + &quot; &quot; + numberOfLinesInGroup);


Jackson criticises the traditional single-loop version for failing to process the structure of the input file (repeating groups of records containing repeating individual records) in a natural way. One sign of its unnatural design is that, in order to work properly, it is forced to include special code for handling the first and last record of the file.

== The basic method ==
JSP uses semi-formal steps to capture the existing structure of a program&#x27;s inputs and outputs in the structure of the program itself.

The intent is to create programs which are easy to modify over their lifetime. Jackson&#x27;s major insight was that requirement changes are usually minor tweaks to the existing structures. For a program constructed using JSP, the inputs, the outputs, and the internal structures of the program all match, so small changes to the inputs and outputs should translate into small changes to the program.

JSP structures programs in terms of four component types:

* fundamental operations
* sequences
* iterations
* selections

The method begins by describing a program&#x27;s inputs in terms of the four fundamental component types. It then goes on to describe the program&#x27;s outputs in the same way. Each input and output is modelled as a separate Data Structure Diagram (DSD). To make JSP work for compute-intensive applications, such as digital signal processing (DSP) it is also necessary to draw algorithm structure diagrams, which focus on internal data structures rather than input and output ones.

The input and output structures are then unified or merged into a final program structure, known as a Program Structure Diagram (PSD). This step may involve the addition of a small amount of high level control structure to marry up the inputs and outputs. Some programs process all the input before doing any output, whilst others read in one record, write one record and iterate. Such approaches have to be captured in the PSD.

The PSD, which is language neutral, is then implemented in a programming language. JSP is geared towards programming at the level of control structures, so the implemented designs use just primitive operations, sequences, iterations and selections. JSP is not used to structure programs at the level of classes and objects, although it can helpfully structure control flow within a class&#x27;s methods.

JSP uses a diagramming notation to describe the structure of inputs, outputs and programs, with diagram elements for each of the fundamental component types.

A simple operation is drawn as a box.

A sequence of operations is represented by boxes connected with lines. In the example below, A is a sequence consisting of operations B, C and D.

An iteration is again represented with joined boxes. In addition the iterated operation has a star in the top right corner of its box. In the example below, A is an iteration of zero or more invocations of operation B.

Selection is similar to a sequence, but with a circle drawn in the top right hand corner of each optional operation. In the example, A is a selection of one and only one of operations B, C or D.

Note that it in the above diagrams, it is element A that is the sequence or iteration, not the elements B, C or D (which in the above diagrams are all elementary). Jackson gives the &#x27;Look-down rule&#x27; to determine what an element is, i.e. look at the elements below an element to find out what it is.

==A worked example==

As an example, here is how a JSP programmer would design and code a run length encoder. A run length encoder is a program whose input is a stream of bytes which can be viewed as occurring in &quot;runs&quot;, where a run consists of one or more occurrences of bytes of the same value. The output of the program is a stream of byte pairs, where each byte pair is a compressed description of a run. In each pair, the first byte is the value of the repeated byte in a run and the second byte is a number indicating the number of times that that value was repeated in the run. For example, a run of eight occurrences of the letter &quot;A&quot; in the input stream (&quot;AAAAAAAA&quot;) would produce &quot;A8&quot; as a byte pair in the output stream. Run length encoders are often used for crudely compressing bitmaps.

With JSP, the first step is to describe the data structure(s) of a program&#x27;s input stream(s). The program has only one input stream, consisting of zero or more &quot;runs&quot; of the same byte value. Here is the JSP data structure diagram for the input stream.

The second step is to describe the output data structure, which in this case consists of zero or more iterations of byte pairs.

The next step is to describe the correspondences between the components of the input and output structures.

The next step is to use the correspondences between the two data structures to create a program structure that is capable of processing the input data structure and producing the output data structure. (Sometimes this isn&#x27;t possible. See the discussion of &quot;structure clashes&quot;, below.)

Once the program structure is finished, the programmer creates a list of the computational operations that the program must perform, and the program structure diagram is fleshed out by hanging those operations off of the appropriate structural components. 
# read a byte
# remember byte
# set counter to zero
# increment counter
# output remembered byte
# output counter

Also, at this stage conditions on iterations (loops) and selections (if-then-else or case statements) are listed and added to the program structure diagram.

# while there are more bytes
# while there are more bytes and this byte is the same as the run&#x27;s first byte and the count will still fit in a byte

Once the diagram is finished, it can be translated into whatever programming language is being used. Here is a translation into C.
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
 int c;
 int first_byte;
 int count;

 c = getchar(); /* get first byte */
 while (c != EOF) {
 /* process the first byte in the run */
 first_byte = c;
 count = 1;
 c = getchar(); /* get next byte */

 /* process the succeeding bytes in the run */
 while (c != EOF &amp;&amp; c == first_byte &amp;&amp; count &lt; 255) {
 /* process one byte of the same value */
 count++;
 c = getchar(); /* get next byte */

 putchar(first_byte);
 putchar(count);
 return EXIT_SUCCESS;


== Techniques for handling difficult design problems ==
In &quot;Principles of Program Design&quot; Jackson recognized situations that posed specific kinds of design problems, and provided techniques for handling them.

One of these situations is a case in which a program processes two input files, rather than one. In 1975, one of the standard &quot;wicked problems&quot; was how to design a transaction-processing program. In such a program, a sequential file of update records is run against a sequential master file, producing an updated master file as output. (For example, at night a bank would run a batch program that would update the balances in its customers&#x27; accounts based on records of the deposits and withdrawals that they had made that day.) &quot;Principles of Program Design&quot; provided a standard solution for that problem, along with an explanation of the logic behind the design.

Another kind of problem involved what Jackson called &quot;recognition difficulties&quot; and today we would call parsing problems. The basic JSP design technique was supplemented by POSIT and QUIT operations to allow the design of what we would now call a backtracking parser.

JSP also recognized three situations that are called &quot;structure clashes&quot;— a boundary clash, an ordering clash, and an interleaving clash— and provided techniques for dealing with them. In structure clash situations the input and output data structures are so incompatible that it is not possible to produce the output file from the input file. It is necessary, in effect, to write two programs— the first processes the input stream, breaks it down into smaller chunks, and writes those chunks to an intermediate file. The second program reads the intermediate file and produces the desired output.

== JSP and object-oriented design ==
JSP was developed long before object-oriented technologies became available. It and its successor method JSD do not treat what now would be called &quot;objects&quot; as collections of more or less independent methods. Instead, following the work of C. A. R. Hoare, JSP and JSD describe software objects as co-routines.

<text>Oswald the Lucky Rabbit (also known as Oswald the Rabbit, Oswald Rabbit, and Ozzie) is an animated cartoon character created in 1927 by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks for Universal Pictures. He starred in several animated short films released to theaters from 1927 to 1938. Twenty-seven animated Oswald shorts were produced at the Walt Disney Studio. After Universal took control of Oswald&#x27;s character in 1928, Disney created a new character similar in appearance to Oswald as a replacement: Mickey Mouse, who went on to become the most famous cartoon character in the world.

In 2003, Buena Vista Games pitched a concept for an Oswald-themed video game to then-Disney President and future-CEO Bob Iger, who became committed to acquiring the rights to Oswald. In 2006, The Walt Disney Company acquired the trademark of Oswald (with NBCUniversal effectively trading Oswald for the services of Al Michaels as play-by-play announcer on &quot;NBC Sunday Night Football&quot;).

Oswald returned in Disney&#x27;s 2010 video game, &quot;Epic Mickey&quot;. The game&#x27;s metafiction plot parallels Oswald&#x27;s real-world history, dealing with the character&#x27;s feelings of abandonment by Disney and envy toward Mickey Mouse. He has since appeared in Disney theme parks and comic books, as well as two follow-up games, &quot;Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two&quot; and &quot;Epic Mickey: Power of Illusion&quot;. Oswald made his first appearance in an animated production in 85 years through his cameo appearance in the 2013 animated short &quot;Get a Horse!&quot; He was the subject of the 2015 feature film &quot;Walt Before Mickey&quot;. Oswald also appears as a townsperson in &quot;Disney Infinity 2.0&quot;. In 2022, Oswald appeared in a new short produced by Disney. He also has a cameo appearance in &quot;Once Upon a Studio&quot;.

In January 2023, the copyrights on several of the original Oswald shorts, as well as the character, expired. Those films and the character are now in the public domain. In 2024, it was announced that the character will appear in &quot;Oswald: Down the Rabbit Hole&quot;, an upcoming horror film directed by Lilton Stewart III, starring Ernie Hudson as the titular character.

==Characteristics==

While under Disney&#x27;s creative control, Oswald was one of the first cartoon characters that had personality. As outlined by Walt himself: &quot;Hereafter we will aim to [make] Oswald a younger character, peppy, alert, saucy, and venturesome, keeping him also neat and trim&quot;. With Oswald, Disney began to explore the concept of &quot;personality animation&quot;, in which cartoon characters were defined as individuals through their movements, mannerisms, and acting, instead of simply through their design. Around this period, Disney had expressed: &quot;I want the characters to be somebody. I don&#x27;t want them just to be a drawing&quot;. Not only were gags used, but his humor differed in terms of what he used to make people laugh. He presented physical humor, used situations to his advantage and presented situational humor in general and frustration comedy best shown in the cartoon &quot;The Mechanical Cow&quot;. He would use animal limbs to solve problems and even use his own limbs as props and gags. He could be squished as if he was made of rubber and could turn anything into a tool. His distinct personality was inspired by Douglas Fairbanks for his courageous and adventurous attitude as seen in the cartoon short &quot;Oh, What a Knight&quot;.

In regard to Oswald&#x27;s personality, Disney historian David Gerstein describes the difference between Mickey and Oswald: &quot;Imagine Mickey if he were a little more egotistical or fallible, or imagine Bugs Bunny if he talked the talk but wasn&#x27;t as good at walking the walk&quot;.

In order to make his Oswald cartoons look &quot;real&quot;, Disney turned away from the styles of Felix the Cat, Koko the Clown, Krazy Kat, and Julius the Cat and began emulating the camera angles, effects, and editing of live-action films. To learn how to base gags on personality and how to build comic routines, rather than heaping one gag after another, he studied Laurel and Hardy, Harold Lloyd, Charlie Chaplin, and Buster Keaton. In order to stir emotion in an audience, Disney studied and scrutinized the shadow effects, cross-cutting, and staging of action in films featuring Douglas Fairbanks and Lon Chaney.

Over several cartoons, Disney and his animators would develop Oswald&#x27;s persona: an &quot;emotive, fast-moving wise guy, alternately ebullient and grouchy&quot;.

Walt Disney did not want for Oswald to simply be &quot;a rabbit character animated and shown in the same light as the commonly known cat characters&quot;, as well as merely just a peg for gags. Instead, his stated intention was &quot;to make Oswald peculiarly and typically OSWALD&quot;.

==History==
===Creation===
In 1927, because of cost and technical restrictions, Disney and his chief animator Ub Iwerks ended their work on the Alice Comedies and Julius the Cat. Around the same time, Charles Mintz got word that Universal Pictures wanted to get into the cartoon business, so he told Disney to create a new rabbit character that he could sell to Universal, because there were too many cat characters (Krazy Kat, Felix the Cat, etc.). After Oswald was created, Winkler signed a contract with Universal on March 4 the same year, which would guarantee 26 &quot;Oswald the Lucky Rabbit&quot; cartoons. Work on both the character and series began soon after Disney moved his studio to Hyperion Avenue.
The Universal studio heads rejected the first Oswald cartoon, &quot;Poor Papa&quot;, for its poor production quality and the sloppiness and age of Oswald. Disney, together with Iwerks, created a second cartoon titled &quot;Trolley Troubles&quot; featuring a much younger, neater Oswald. The short, released on September 5, 1927, officially launched the series and proved to be Universal&#x27;s greatest success to date. Poor Papa was later released in 1928 and the storyline was reused in a Mickey Mouse short five years later, in &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Nightmare&quot;. Oswald the Lucky Rabbit became Universal&#x27;s first major hit in 1927, rivaling other popular cartoon characters, such as Felix the Cat and Koko the Clown.

The success of the Oswald series allowed the Walt Disney Studio to grow to a staff of nearly twenty. Walt&#x27;s weekly salary from the series was $100 while Roy Disney&#x27;s was $65. The Disney brothers earned $500 per Oswald short and split the year-end profits, with Walt receiving 60% ($5,361), and Roy receiving 40% ($3,574). With income gained from the Oswald series, Walt and Roy purchased ten acres of land in the desert. They also invested in an oil-drilling venture. Iwerks also invested his income in several stone mills to crush paint pigment he used to make paint formulas that were utilized by animators for decades.
Oswald&#x27;s success also resulted in Universal and Winkler signing another contract in February 1928, guaranteeing three more years of Oswald cartoons.

As time passed, Disney feared that Mintz would forgo renewal of the contract, partly due to Iwerks informing Disney that George Winkler, at the behest of Mintz, had been going behind Disney&#x27;s back during pick-up runs for Oswald reels and hiring away his animators. Eventually, Disney traveled with his wife Lilly to New York to find other potential distributors for his studio&#x27;s cartoons, including Fox and MGM, prior to meetings with Mintz. As Walt later recalled, he placed two Oswald prints under one arm and—feeling &quot;like a hick&quot;—marched &quot;one half-block north&quot; on Broadway to MGM to visit Fred Quimby. During this period, Walt and Lillian attended the premier of the Oswald short &quot;Rival Romeos&quot;, which debuted at the Colony on 53rd and Broadway.

In February 1928, Disney traveled to New York City in hopes of negotiating a more profitable contract with his producer Charles Mintz. As economic problems were apparent at the time, Mintz figured Disney should settle for a 20% cut, although large turnarounds were promised if the studio&#x27;s finances showed considerable growth. While most of his fellow animators left for Mintz&#x27;s studio, Disney quit working on the Oswald cartoons. On his long train ride home, he came up with an idea to create another character, and retain the rights to it. He and Iwerks would go on to develop a new cartoon in secret, starring a new character which would soon become the most successful cartoon character in film history and later became the foundation of a global entertainment empire. The first Mickey Mouse cartoon to be filmed was &quot;Plane Crazy&quot; in the summer of 1928, but it was produced as a silent and held back from release. The first Mickey Mouse film with a synchronized soundtrack, &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot;, reached the screen that fall and became a major hit, eclipsing Oswald. &quot;Plane Crazy&quot; was later given its own synchronized soundtrack and released on March 17, 1929.

===Universal takes direct control===

Mintz, meanwhile, opened his own studio (later known as Screen Gems) consisting primarily of former Disney employees, where he continued to produce Oswald cartoons, among them the first Oswald with sound, &quot;Hen Fruit&quot; (1929). Coincidentally, Disney and Mintz each produced nine cartoons the first year and 17 the next, before others took over Oswald. Animators Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising, unhappy with Mintz, asked Universal head Carl Laemmle to remove Mintz, suggesting they would be the ones to continue the Oswald series. Laemmle terminated Mintz&#x27;s contract but, instead of hiring Harman and Ising, he opted to have the Oswald cartoons produced right on the Universal lot. Laemmle selected Walter Lantz to produce the new series of Oswald shorts (the first of which was 1929&#x27;s &quot;Race Riot&quot;). Featuring Bill Nolan as an animator (and later director), the Lantz-produced Oswalds had a decidedly different tone and aesthetic than the Disney shorts, with more slapstick and surreal visual gags, some contributed by a young Tex Avery. Over the next decade, Lantz produced 142 Oswald cartoons, for a total of 194 films featuring the character, spanning the work of all three producers. After Lantz took over production in 1929, Oswald&#x27;s look changed to some degree over the following years: Oswald got white gloves on his hands, shoes on his feet, a shirt, a &quot;cuter&quot; face with larger eyes, a bigger head, and shorter ears. With 1935&#x27;s &quot;Case of the Lost Sheep&quot;, an even more major makeover took place: the character was drawn more realistically now, with white fur rather than black, shoes are removed, plus wearing suspenders instead of a shirt and shorts. Both redesigns were done by Manuel Moreno, who recalled that in the 1935 redesign that Lantz said to make Oswald cute and to get rid of the black on him, because Disney was also changing his characters.

The cartoons containing the new, white-furred Oswald seemed different from their predecessors in more than one way, as the stories themselves became softer. Minor changes in the drawing style would continue, too. With &quot;Happy Scouts&quot; (1938), the second-to-last Oswald film produced, the rabbit&#x27;s fur went from being all-white to a combination of white and gray.

Unlike the Disney shorts, in which Oswald did not speak, Lantz&#x27;s cartoons began to feature actual dialogue for Oswald, although most of the cartoons were still silent to begin with. Animator Bill Nolan performed the voice of Oswald in &quot;Cold Turkey&quot;, the first Lantz cartoon with dialogue, and the following year Pinto Colvig, who was working as an animator and gag man at the studio, started voicing Oswald. When Colvig left the studio in 1931, Mickey Rooney took over the voicing of Oswald until early in the following year. Starting in 1932, Lantz ceased to use a regular voice actor for Oswald, and many studio staff members (including Lantz himself) would take turns in voicing the character over the years. June Foray provided Oswald&#x27;s voice in &quot;The Egg Cracker Suite&quot;, which was the final theatrical short to feature him. She later voiced him again for an unaired radio pilot, &quot;Sally in Hollywoodland&quot; (1947).

Oswald made a cameo appearance in the first animated sequence with both sound and color (two-strip Technicolor), a 2½-minute animated sequence of the live action movie &quot;The King of Jazz&quot; (1930), produced by Laemmle for Universal. It was not until 1934 that Oswald got his own color sound cartoons in two-strip Technicolor, &quot;Toyland Premiere&quot; and &quot;Springtime Serenade&quot;. The Oswald cartoons then returned to black-and-white, except for the last one, &quot;The Egg Cracker Suite&quot; (1943), released as a part of the Swing Symphonies series. &quot;Egg Cracker&quot; was also the only Oswald cartoon to use three-strip Technicolor. Oswald&#x27;s last cartoon appearance was a cameo in &quot;The Woody Woodpecker Polka&quot; (1951), also in Technicolor, which by then had become the norm in the cartoon industry. He also appeared in a 1952 theatrical commercial for the Electric Autolite Company, with his voice being provided by Dick Beals.

===Comic books===
Oswald&#x27;s first appearance in comics was in a series of comic strips titled &quot;Oswald the Rabbit&quot;, which ran from February 1935 to January 1936. They were drawn by Al Stahl and published by National Allied Publications. The comics were serialized on one page of every issue of &quot;New Fun&quot; and the first issue of &quot;More Fun&quot;.

Oswald&#x27;s second run in comics began in Dell Comics&#x27; &quot;New Funnies&quot;, which ran from 1942 to 1962. Following the typical development seen in most new comics, the New Funnies stories slowly morphed the character in their own direction.

At the start of the &quot;New Funnies&quot; feature, Oswald existed in a milieu reminiscent of Winnie-the-Pooh: he was portrayed as a live stuffed animal, living in a forest together with other anthropomorphized toys. These included Toby Bear, Maggie Lou the wooden doll, Hi-Yah Wahoo the turtle-faced Indian, and Woody Woodpecker—depicted as a mechanical doll filled with nuts and bolts (hence his &quot;nutty&quot; behavior). In 1944, with the addition of writer John Stanley, the stuffed animal motif was dropped, as were Maggie Lou, Woody, and Wahoo. Oswald and Toby became flesh and blood characters living as roommates in &quot;Lantzville&quot;. Initially drawn by Dan Gormley, the series was later drawn by the likes of Dan Noonan and Lloyd White.

In 1948, Toby adopted two orphan rabbits for Oswald to raise. Floyd and Lloyd, &quot;Poppa Oswald&#x27;s&quot; new sons, stuck around; Toby was relegated to the sidelines, disappearing for good in 1953. Later stories focused on Oswald adventuring with his sons, seeking odd jobs, or simply protecting the boys from the likes of rabbit-eating Reddy Fox and (from 1961) con man Gabby Gator—a character adapted from contemporary Woody Woodpecker cartoon shorts. This era of Oswald comics typically featured the art of Jack Bradbury, known also for his Mickey Mouse work.

After the assassination of John F. Kennedy by Lee Harvey Oswald, the name &quot;Oswald&quot; came to have negative connotations.

He made brief appearances in the &quot;Woody Woodpecker&quot; comics series until it ended in the 1970s. Through the end of the 20th century, the comics produced outside the U.S. carried on the look and story style of the Dell Oswald stories.

In 2010, Oswald starred in the digi-comic series &quot;Epic Mickey: Tales of the Wasteland&quot;, a prequel to the &quot;Epic Mickey&quot; video game, sharing what the Wasteland was like before Mickey arrived there.

In 2011, Oswald starred in the Norwegian Disney comic story &quot;En magisk jul!&quot;, written by David Gerstein and drawn by Mark Kausler. It is based on and takes place in the times of the classic Oswald shorts from 1927 to 1928. The story was later reprinted, as &quot;Just Like Magic!&quot;, in the American Disney comic &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; #726 (2015).

===Disney acquires Oswald trademark===
In February 2006, Disney CEO Bob Iger initiated a trade with NBCUniversal in which a number of minor assets, including the rights to Oswald and the 27 shorts that Walt Disney had worked on, were acquired by The Walt Disney Company in exchange for sending sportscaster Al Michaels from Disney&#x27;s ABC and ESPN to NBC Sports. At the time, ABC had lost its contract for NFL broadcast rights, and despite recently signing a long-term contract with ESPN, Michaels was interested in rejoining broadcast partner John Madden at NBC for the Sunday night package. Universal transferred the trademark of the character to Disney, and in exchange, Disney released Michaels from his employment contract, allowing him to sign with NBC.

The deal included the trademark rights to the character and the 27 Disney-produced Oswald shorts along with the handover of any physical Disney-produced Oswald material Universal still had in their possession. Iger had been interested in the property because of an internal design document for a video game, which became &quot;Epic Mickey&quot;. Walt Disney&#x27;s daughter, Diane Disney Miller, issued the following statement after the deal was announced:
Around the same time, the Kansas City Chiefs and New York Jets made a similar deal, the Chiefs giving the Jets a draft pick as compensation for releasing coach Herm Edwards from his contract. Referring to this trade, Michaels said:
In January 2007, a T-shirt line from Comme des Garçons seems to have constituted the first new Disney Oswald merchandise. Following in December was a two-disc DVD set, &quot;The Adventures of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit&quot;, included in Wave Seven of the &quot;Walt Disney Treasures&quot; DVD series. Several Oswald collectors&#x27; figurines and a limited edition grayscale plush toy appeared shortly after the DVD set&#x27;s release. The Disney Store also began to introduce Oswald into its merchandise lines, starting with a canvas print and Christmas ornament that became available in Fall 2007. A standard-issue color plush toy matching Oswald&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Epic Mickey&quot; appeared in late 2010. This was followed by an ongoing roll-out of clothing and other products at the Disney Store, various chain stores, and the Disney California Adventure theme park.

In 2012, the newly redesigned Buena Vista Street at Disney California Adventure included Oswald&#x27;s Filling Station, an Oswald merchandise stand themed as a 1920s gas station. The shop exclusively only sells just &quot;Oswald the Lucky Rabbit&quot; merchandise such as &quot;Oswald Ears&quot; hats (a similar style to the popular Mickey Mouse Club black mouse-eared caps), as well as shirts, t-shirts, plush toys, pins, mugs, and other special Oswald items. In 2014, Oswald began making appearances in the area near the shop.

===Video games===
In 1995, Oswald briefly appeared in &quot;Férias Frustradas do Pica-Pau&quot;, a Woody Woodpecker video game released for the Master System and the Mega Drive in Brazil only.

Oswald is one of the main characters in the 2010 video game &quot;Epic Mickey&quot; and its 2024 remake, &quot;Epic Mickey: Rebrushed&quot;. The world of &quot;Epic Mickey&quot; takes place in &quot;Wasteland&quot;, a setting that mirrors elements of Disneyland but as a home for &quot;forgotten&quot; Disney characters, including Oswald, who rules over the environment. Oswald fashioned Wasteland after Disneyland, although it is darker and distorted. He implements his likeness into areas Mickey Mouse normally appears, such as the iconic Partners statue with Walt Disney and other imagery throughout the town. Oswald was the first cartoon character to be &quot;forgotten&quot; and eventually lose his relevance, now inhabiting Wasteland. Oswald also dislikes Mickey for stealing his popularity that he felt he deserved. Despite his resentment, Oswald tries to maintain peace and make Wasteland a better place for forgotten characters, especially his &quot;bunny children&quot; and his wife Ortensia.

&quot;Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two&quot; is a video game that was released on November 18, 2012. Unlike the previous game, &quot;Epic Mickey 2&quot; features full voiced cut-scenes with Frank Welker (Welker had also provided Oswald&#x27;s vocal effects and the Shadow Blot in the previous game) as Oswald&#x27;s first voice actor in an &quot;Oswald the Lucky Rabbit&quot; production from Disney. Bill Nolan was Oswald&#x27;s first voice actor in 1929, when Walter Lantz produced the Oswald cartoons.

Tetsuya Nomura, creator and lead producer of the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; franchise, had requested for Oswald&#x27;s use in &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot;, but the response from Disney was that the character would be &quot;too difficult&quot; to use, with no further clarification or details from Disney. Nomura cites Oswald as one of his favorite Disney characters.

On November 30, 2023, Oswald was added as a playable racer in &quot;Disney Speedstorm&quot; during its fifth season alongside Ortensia, while he appears in &quot;Disney Dreamlight Valley&quot; as part of its &quot;Eternity Isle&quot; expansion. He is voiced by David Errigo Jr. in both appearances.

===Disney projects===
In 2012, sketch animation from a lost 1928 cartoon, &quot;Harem Scarem&quot;, was compiled by archivists at Disney and released to help celebrate Oswald&#x27;s 85th Anniversary. He made an appearance in a 2013 throwback-style Mickey Mouse cartoon, &quot;Get a Horse!&quot;

While only 19 of 26 cartoons were previously known to have survived, a couple of Oswald&#x27;s lost cartoons were found in the 2010s. In 2015, the British Film Institute&#x27;s National Archives were found to hold his &quot;Sleigh Bells&quot; (1928) footage. The BFI and Walt Disney Animation Studios worked to restore the short. Long-term Disney animator David Bossert wrote a book, &quot;Oswald the Lucky Rabbit: The Search for the Lost Disney Cartoons&quot; which was released in 2017. A Japanese man, Yasushi Watanabe, read the book and discovered that he had a missing 1928 Oswald cartoon, &quot;Neck &amp; Neck&quot;, since he was a teenager.

A series centered on Oswald was in development with the project announced in 2019 for a potential release on Disney+. Disney Television Animation veteran Matt Danner revealed that a series was in development as a follow-up for the team behind &quot;Legend of the Three Caballeros&quot;, but that they &quot;got broken up and scattered to the wind&quot;. He expressed hope that the series could still be revived in the future and further hinted that another team would develop it, because Disney was still heavily invested in wanting to revive the character.

On December 1, 2022, an online hand-drawn animated Oswald short by Walt Disney Animation Studios was released. The short was directed by Eric Goldberg, scored by Dean McClure, and produced by Dorothy McKim, with Mark Henn and Randy Haycock working on the animation alongside Goldberg. It marked Oswald&#x27;s first short produced by Disney, as well as his first short ever since &quot;Feed the Kitty&quot; (1938). A few weeks later, a hand-drawn animation piece by Disney Animation featuring Oswald was released, meant to promote a line of products developed by Disney and Givenchy. Restored public domain versions of the shorts &quot;Trolley Troubles&quot; and &quot;All Wet&quot; (both 1927) were released on Disney+ in September 2023.

==Merchandise==
Shortly after the rabbit starred in his black-and-white animated silent shorts between 1927 and 1928, he sold merchandise for Universal: a chocolate-covered marshmallow candy bar, a stencil set, and a pin-backed button. In 2004 and 2005, Oswald products became popular in Japan and were primarily made available as prizes in UFO catchers and as official merchandise in Universal Studios Japan, manufactured by Taito and/or Medicom, these products included puppets, inflatable dolls, keyrings, and watches. Oswald made his first Disneyland appearance at Tokyo Disneyland on March 31, 2010, as an Easter float. As of October 2017, Oswald has a Service Station at Disney&#x27;s California Adventure (near the entrance) that only sells exclusive &quot;Oswald The Lucky Rabbit&quot; merchandise including Oswald ears, hats (baseball caps), shirts, t-shirts, plates, coats, cups, mugs, plush toys, key-chains, and much more.

==Theme park appearances==

The Oswald character showed up at the parks in Florida and California on the day Disney reacquired Oswald, but made no further appearances at the time.

In 2010, Tokyo Disneyland produced a float featuring Oswald for their first Easter holiday event.

In 2011, Oswald appeared with other old Disney characters on the construction walls for Disney California Adventure Park&#x27;s new entrance. Oswald also appeared on a poster as a magician&#x27;s rabbit in Town Square Theater in Magic Kingdom park. Oswald appeared on various items of clothing available for purchase at Disneyland Paris in the shops on Main Street USA.

In 2012, Disney California Adventure park at the Disneyland Resort reopened with a new entry area called Buena Vista Street, themed to 1920s Los Angeles. Oswald&#x27;s Service Station is a 1920s gas station (housing a gift shop) located at the north end of the street and features Oswald prominently in its logo. Disney California Adventure also sells Oswald merchandise and next-door Disneyland offers Mickey Mouse merchandise exclusively. In the same year, Oswald ear hats appeared at the Emporium at Walt Disney World in Florida.

As of May 2014, Oswald can be spotted on the exit of &quot;The Seven Dwarves&quot; ride at Magic Kingdom, Orlando. He is carved into a tree near the exit door. During the same year a new Oswald costumed character began meet-and-greets at Tokyo DisneySea on April 1, and on September 14 Oswald began making appearances on Buena Vista Street at Disney California Adventure.

As of October 2017, Oswald has a Service Station at Disney California Adventure and has been spotted making appearances.

On June 2, 2018, at the FanDaze event Oswald&#x27;s spouse, Ortensia accompanied him as a VIP guest in Disneyland Paris. They also performed in the show, &quot;Oh My, Ortensia&quot;.

Oswald was featured on the medal of the Walt Disney World Marathon Weekend 10K. The event took place on January 7, 2022, as part of runDisney&#x27;s WDW Marathon Weekend.

Oswald made a debut in Hong Kong Disneyland in January 2023 as part of the celebration for the 100th anniversary of The Walt Disney Company.

From January 20 to February 15, 2023, at Disney California Adventure, Oswald and his wife Ortensia appeared to celebrate Chinese New Year, which marks Ortensia&#x27;s debut in an American theme park.

==Reception==

During the 1920s, the Oswald shorts, as well as Oswald himself, were extremely popular and had received substantial critical acclaim. &quot;The Film Daily&quot; noted that the series was &quot;one of the best sellers of the &#x27;U[niversal]&#x27; short subject program&quot;. According to &quot;The Moving Picture World&quot;, Oswald had &quot;accomplished the astounding feat of jumping into the first-run favor overnight&quot;.

With the release of &quot;Trolley Troubles&quot;, &quot;The Film Daily&quot; wrote: &quot;As conductor on a &#x27;Toonerville&#x27; trolley, Oswald is a riot. This ... you can book on pure faith, and our solemn word that they have the goods&quot;.

&quot;The Moving Picture World&quot; noted that Oswald was &quot;good for a lot of smiles and real laughs. &quot;Trolley Troubles&quot; presents Oswald as the skipper of a dinky little trolley on a wild ride over mountains&quot;.

According to &quot;The Moving Picture World&quot;:
With the release of &quot;Oh, Teacher&quot;, &quot;Moving Picture World&quot; wrote that it &quot;lives up to the promise of the first ... as a clever, peppy, and amusing series of cartoons that should prove popular in any type of house. This one deals with Oswald as a school kid and introduces a cat as his rival. It contains some of the best gags we have seen in cartoons&quot;.

With the release of &quot;The Mechanical Cow&quot;, &quot;Moving Picture World&quot; wrote that Oswald &quot;has a wild and amusing time with his ingenuous milk producer&quot;.

With the release of &quot;Great Guns&quot;, &quot;Moving Picture World&quot; wrote that Oswald is a &quot;hero in action in the trenches and [in] a situation where two planes fight each other like pugilists&quot;. They found that &quot;Great Guns&quot; was &quot;chock full of humor&quot; and wrote that &quot;this series is bound to be popular in all types of houses if the present standard is maintained&quot;.

&quot;Moving Picture World&quot; also wrote of the series:

In the modern era, animation historian David Gerstein notes:
Oswald won Best New Character in both Readers&#x27; Choice and Editors&#x27; Choice in &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;″s Best of 2010 awards.

<doc id="70980" wikidata="Q121041" url="?curid=70980" title="Appendicitis">
<text>Appendicitis is inflammation of the appendix. Symptoms commonly include right lower abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever and decreased appetite. However, approximately 40% of people do not have these typical symptoms. Severe complications of a ruptured appendix include widespread, painful inflammation of the inner lining of the abdominal wall and sepsis.
Appendicitis is primarily caused by a blockage of the hollow portion in the appendix. This blockage typically results from a faecolith, a calcified &quot;stone&quot; made of feces. Some studies show a correlation between appendicoliths and disease severity. Other factors such as inflamed lymphoid tissue from a viral infection, intestinal parasites, gallstone, or tumors may also lead to this blockage. When the appendix becomes blocked, it experiences increased pressure, reduced blood flow, and bacterial growth, resulting in inflammation. This combination of factors causes tissue injury and, ultimately, tissue death. If this process is left untreated, it can lead to the appendix rupturing, which releases bacteria into the abdominal cavity, potentially leading to severe complications.
The diagnosis of appendicitis is largely based on the person&#x27;s signs and symptoms. In cases where the diagnosis is unclear, close observation, medical imaging, and laboratory tests can be helpful. The two most commonly used imaging tests for diagnosing appendicitis are ultrasound and computed tomography (CT scan). CT scan is more accurate than ultrasound in detecting acute appendicitis. However, ultrasound may be preferred as the first imaging test in children and pregnant women because of the risks associated with radiation exposure from CT scans. Although ultrasound may aid in diagnosis, its main role is in identifying important differentials, such as ovarian pathology in females or mesenteric adenitis in children.
The standard treatment for acute appendicitis involves the surgical removal of the inflamed appendix. This procedure can be performed either through an open incision in the abdomen (laparotomy) or using minimally invasive techniques with small incisions and cameras (laparoscopy). Surgery is essential to reduce the risk of complications or potential death associated with the rupture of the appendix. Antibiotics may be equally effective in certain cases of non-ruptured appendicitis, but 31% will undergo appendectomy within one year. It is one of the most common and significant causes of sudden abdominal pain. In 2015, approximately 11.6 million cases of appendicitis were reported, resulting in around 50,100 deaths worldwide. In the United States, appendicitis is one of the most common causes of sudden abdominal pain requiring surgery. Annually, more than 300,000 individuals in the United States undergo surgical removal of their appendix.
==Signs and symptoms==

The presentation of acute appendicitis includes acute abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and fever. As the appendix becomes more swollen and inflamed, it begins to irritate the adjoining abdominal wall. This leads the pain to localize at the right lower quadrant. This classic migration of pain may not appear in children under three years. This pain can be triggered by a sharp pain feeling. Pain from appendicitis may begin as dull pain around the navel. After several hours, the pain usually migrates towards the right lower quadrant, where it becomes localized. Symptoms include localized findings in the right iliac fossa. The abdominal wall becomes very sensitive to gentle pressure (palpation). There is pain in the sudden release of deep tension in the lower abdomen (Blumberg&#x27;s sign). If the appendix is retrocecal (localized behind the cecum), even deep pressure in the right lower quadrant may fail to elicit tenderness (silent appendix). This is because the cecum, distended with gas, protects the inflamed appendix from pressure. Similarly, if the appendix lies entirely within the pelvis, there is typically a complete absence of abdominal rigidity. In such cases, a digital rectal examination elicits tenderness in the rectovesical pouch. Coughing causes point tenderness in this area (McBurney&#x27;s point), called Dunphy&#x27;s sign.

==Causes==
Acute appendicitis seems to be the result of a primary obstruction of the appendix. Once this obstruction occurs, the appendix becomes filled with mucus and swells. This continued production of mucus leads to increased pressures within the lumen and the walls of the appendix. The increased pressure results in thrombosis and occlusion of the small vessels, and stasis of lymphatic flow. At this point, spontaneous recovery rarely occurs. As the occlusion of blood vessels progresses, the appendix becomes ischemic and then necrotic. As bacteria begin to leak out through the dying walls, pus forms within and around the appendix (suppuration). The result is appendiceal rupture (a &#x27;burst appendix&#x27;) causing peritonitis, which may lead to sepsis and in rare cases, death. These events are responsible for the slowly evolving abdominal pain and other commonly associated symptoms.

The causative agents include bezoars, foreign bodies, trauma, lymphadenitis and, most commonly, calcified fecal deposits that are known as appendicoliths or fecaliths. The occurrence of obstructing fecaliths has attracted attention since their presence in people with appendicitis is higher in developed than in developing countries. In addition, an appendiceal fecalith is commonly associated with complicated appendicitis. Fecal stasis and arrest may play a role, as demonstrated by people with acute appendicitis having fewer bowel movements per week compared with healthy controls.

The occurrence of a fecalith in the appendix was thought to be attributed to a right-sided fecal retention reservoir in the colon and a prolonged transit time. However, a prolonged transit time was not observed in subsequent studies. Diverticular disease and adenomatous polyps were historically unknown and colon cancer was exceedingly rare in communities where appendicitis itself was rare or absent, such as various African communities. Studies have implicated a transition to a Western diet lower in fiber in rising frequencies of appendicitis as well as the other aforementioned colonic diseases in these communities. And acute appendicitis has been shown to occur antecedent to cancer in the colon and rectum. Several studies offer evidence that a low fiber intake is involved in the pathogenesis of appendicitis. This low intake of dietary fiber is in accordance with the occurrence of a right-sided fecal reservoir and the fact that dietary fiber reduces transit time.

==Diagnosis==

The physician will ask questions to get the health history, assess the patient&#x27;s symptoms, do a complete physical exam, and order both laboratory and imaging tests. Appendicitis symptoms fall into two categories, typical and atypical.

Typical appendicitis is characterized by a migratory right iliac fossa pain associated with nausea, and anorexia, which can occur with or without vomiting and localized muscle stiffness/ generalized guarding. It is possible the pain could localize to the left lower quadrant in people with situs inversus totalis. The combination of migrated umbilical pain to the right lower quadrant, loss of appetite for food, nausea, unsustained vomiting, and mild fever is classic.

Atypical histories lack this typical progression and may include pain in the right lower quadrant as an initial symptom. Irritation of the peritoneum (inside lining of the abdominal wall) can lead to increased pain on movement, or jolting, for example going over speed bumps. Atypical histories often require imaging with ultrasound or CT scanning.

===Signs===
During the early stages of appendicitis diagnosis, it is common for physical exams to present inconspicuous findings. Signs of inflammation become noticeable as the disease progresses. These signs may include
* Aure-Rozanova&#x27;s sign: Increased pain on palpation with a finger in the right inferior lumbar triangle (can be a positive Blumberg&#x27;s sign).
* Bartomier-Michelson&#x27;s sign: Increased pain on palpation at the right iliac region as the person being examined lies on their left side compared to when they lie on their back.
* Dunphy&#x27;s sign: Increased pain in the right lower quadrant by coughing.
* Hamburger sign: The patient refuses to eat (anorexia is 80% sensitive for appendicitis)
* Kocher&#x27;s sign (Kosher&#x27;s sign): From the person&#x27;s medical history, the start of pain in the umbilical region with a subsequent shift to the right iliac region.
* Massouh&#x27;s sign: Developed in and popular in southwest England, the examiner performs a firm swish with their index and middle finger across the abdomen from the xiphoid process to the left and the right iliac fossa.
* Obturator sign: The person being evaluated lies on her or his back with the hip and knee both flexed at ninety degrees. The examiner holds the person&#x27;s ankle with one hand and knee with the other hand. The examiner rotates the hip by moving the person&#x27;s ankle away from their body while allowing the knee to move only inward. A positive test is pain with internal rotation of the hip.
* Psoas sign, also known as &quot;Obraztsova&#x27;s sign&quot;, is right lower-quadrant pain that is produced with either the passive extension of the right hip or by the active flexion of the person&#x27;s right hip while supine. The pain that is elicited is due to inflammation of the peritoneum overlying the iliopsoas muscles and inflammation of the psoas muscles themselves. Straightening out the leg causes pain because it stretches these muscles while flexing the hip activates the iliopsoas and causes pain.
* Rovsing&#x27;s sign: Pain in the lower right abdominal quadrant with continuous deep palpation starting from the left iliac fossa upwards (counterclockwise along the colon). The thought is there will be increased pressure around the appendix by pushing bowel contents and air toward the ileocaecal valve provoking right-sided abdominal pain.
* Rosenstein&#x27;s sign (Sitkovsky&#x27;s sign): Increased pain in the right iliac region as the person is being examined lies on their left side.
* Perman&#x27;s sign: In acute appendicitis palpation in the left iliac fossa may produce pain in the right iliac fossa.

===Laboratory tests===

While there is no laboratory test specific for appendicitis, a complete blood count (CBC) is done to check for signs of infection or inflammation. Although 70–90 percent of people with appendicitis may have an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, many other abdominal and pelvic conditions can cause the WBC count to be elevated. However, a high WBC count may not alone represent a solid indicator of appendicitis but rather an inflammation but the neutrophil ratio was more sensitive and specific for acute appendicitis. Several routine and non-routine laboratory tests have been investigated for discriminating simple and complicated appendicitis, but their diagnostic accuracy is uncertain.

In children, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR)
demonstrates a high degree of accuracy in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis and distinguishes complicated appendicitis from simple appendicitis.
75–78 percent of the patients have neutrophilia. Delta-neutrophil index (DNI) is a valuable parameter that helps in the diagnosis of histologically normal appendicitis and distinguishing between simple and complicated appendicitis.

A C-reactive protein (CRP) blood test will be ordered by the doctor to find out if there are any further causes of inflammation. The C-reactive protein/albumin (CRP/ALB) ratio can be a reliable predictor of complicated appendicitis.

The urinalysis is important for ruling out a urinary tract infection as the cause of abdominal pain. The presence of more than 20 WBC per high-power field in the urine is more suggestive of a urinary tract disorder.

If the patient is a female, a pregnancy test will be ordered.

===Imaging===
In children, the clinical examination is important to determine which children with abdominal pain should receive immediate surgical consultation and which should receive diagnostic imaging. Because of the health risks of exposing children to radiation, ultrasound is the preferred first choice with CT scan being a legitimate follow-up if the ultrasound is inconclusive. CT scan is more accurate than ultrasound for the diagnosis of appendicitis in adults and adolescents. CT scan has a sensitivity of 94%, specificity of 95%. Ultrasonography had an overall sensitivity of 86%, a specificity of 81%.

====Ultrasound====

Abdominal ultrasonography, preferably with doppler sonography, is useful to detect appendicitis, especially in children. Ultrasound can show the free fluid collection in the right iliac fossa, along with a visible appendix with increased blood flow when using color Doppler, and noncompressibility of the appendix, as it is essentially a walled-off abscess. Other secondary sonographic signs of acute appendicitis include the presence of echogenic mesenteric fat surrounding the appendix and the acoustic shadowing of an appendicolith. In some cases (approximately 5%), ultrasonography of the iliac fossa does not reveal any abnormalities despite the presence of appendicitis. This false-negative finding is especially true of early appendicitis before the appendix has become significantly distended. Also, false-negative findings are more common in adults where larger amounts of fat and bowel gas make visualizing the appendix technically difficult. Despite these limitations, sonographic imaging with experienced hands can often distinguish between appendicitis and other diseases with similar symptoms. Some of these conditions include inflammation of lymph nodes near the appendix or pain originating from other pelvic organs such as the ovaries or Fallopian tubes. Ultrasounds may be either done by the radiology department or by the emergency physician.

====Computed tomography====

Where it is readily available, computed tomography (CT) has become frequently used, especially in people whose diagnosis is not obvious on history and physical examination. Although some concerns about interpretation are identified, a 2019 Cochrane review found that the sensitivity and specificity of CT for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in adults was high. Concerns about radiation tend to limit use of CT in pregnant women and in children, especially with the increasingly widespread usage of MRI.

The accurate diagnosis of appendicitis is multi-tiered, with the size of the appendix having the strongest positive predictive value, while indirect features can either increase or decrease sensitivity and specificity. A size of over 6 mm is both 95% sensitive and specific for appendicitis.

However, because the appendix can be filled with fecal material, causing intraluminal distention, this criterion has shown limited utility in more recent meta-analyses. This is as opposed to ultrasound, in which the wall of the appendix can be more easily distinguished from intraluminal feces. In such scenarios, ancillary features such as increased wall enhancement as compared to adjacent bowel and inflammation of the surrounding fat, or fat stranding, can be supportive of the diagnosis. However, their absence does not preclude it. In severe cases with perforation, an adjacent phlegmon or abscess can be seen. Dense fluid layering in the pelvis can also result, related to either pus or enteric spillage. When patients are thin or younger, the relative absence of fat can make the appendix and surrounding fat stranding difficult to see.

====Magnetic resonance imaging====
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) use has become increasingly common for diagnosis of appendicitis in children and pregnant patients due to the radiation dosage that, while of nearly negligible risk in healthy adults, can be harmful to children or the developing baby. In pregnancy, it is more useful during the second and third trimester, particularly as the enlargening uterus displaces the appendix, making it difficult to find by ultrasound. The periappendiceal stranding that is reflected on CT by fat stranding on MRI appears as an increased fluid signal on T2 weighted sequences. First-trimester pregnancies are usually not candidates for MRI, as the fetus is still undergoing organogenesis, and there are no long-term studies to date regarding its potential risks or side effects.

====X-ray====

In general, plain abdominal radiography (PAR) is not useful in making the diagnosis of appendicitis and should not be routinely obtained from a person being evaluated for appendicitis. Plain abdominal films may be useful for the detection of ureteral calculi, small bowel obstruction, or perforated ulcer, but these conditions are rarely confused with appendicitis. An opaque fecalith can be identified in the right lower quadrant in fewer than 5% of people being evaluated for appendicitis. A barium enema has proven to be a poor diagnostic tool for appendicitis. While failure of the appendix to fill during a barium enema has been associated with appendicitis, up to 20% of normal appendices do not fill.

===Scoring systems===
Several scoring systems have been developed to try to identify people who are likely to have appendicitis. The performance of scores such as the Alvarado score and the Pediatric Appendicitis Score, however, are variable.

The Alvarado score is the most known scoring system. A score below 5 suggests against a diagnosis of appendicitis, whereas a score of 7 or more is predictive of acute appendicitis. In a person with an equivocal score of 5 or 6, a CT scan or ultrasound exam may be used to reduce the rate of negative appendectomy.

===Pathology===
Even for clinically certain appendicitis, routine histopathology examination of appendectomy specimens is of value for identifying unsuspected pathologies requiring further postoperative management. No sign of appendicitis in specimens, negative appendectomy, varies but has been estimated to occur in 13% of specimens. Notably, appendix cancer is found incidentally in about 1% of appendectomy specimens.

Pathology diagnosis of appendicitis can be made by detecting a neutrophilic infiltrate of the muscularis propria.

Periappendicitis (inflammation of tissues around the appendix) is often found in conjunction with other abdominal pathology.

===Differential diagnosis===

Children: Gastroenteritis, mesenteric adenitis, Meckel&#x27;s diverticulitis, intussusception, Henoch–Schönlein purpura, lobar pneumonia, urinary tract infection (abdominal pain in the absence of other symptoms can occur in children with UTI), new-onset Crohn&#x27;s disease or ulcerative colitis, pancreatitis, and abdominal trauma from child abuse; distal intestinal obstruction syndrome in children with cystic fibrosis; typhlitis in children with leukemia.

Women: A pregnancy test is important for all women of childbearing age since an ectopic pregnancy can have signs and symptoms similar to those of appendicitis. Other obstetrical/ gynecological causes of similar abdominal pain in women include pelvic inflammatory disease, ovarian torsion, menarche, dysmenorrhea, endometriosis, and Mittelschmerz (the passing of an egg in the ovaries approximately two weeks before menstruation).

Men: testicular torsion

Adults: new-onset Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, regional enteritis, cholecystitis, renal colic, perforated peptic ulcer, pancreatitis, rectus sheath hematoma and epiploic appendagitis.

Elderly: diverticulitis, intestinal obstruction, colonic carcinoma, mesenteric ischemia, leaking aortic aneurysm.

The term &quot;&quot; is used to describe a condition mimicking appendicitis. It can be associated with &quot;Yersinia enterocolitica&quot;.

==Management==
Acute appendicitis is typically managed by surgery. While antibiotics are safe and effective for treating uncomplicated appendicitis, 31% of people had a recurrence within a year and required an eventual appendectomy. Antibiotics are less effective if an appendicolith is present. While 51% of patients who were treated with antibiotics did not need an appendectomy three years after treatment, the cost effectiveness of surgery versus antibiotics is unclear

Using antibiotics to prevent potential postoperative complications in emergency appendectomy procedures is recommended, and the antibiotics are effective when given to a person before, during, or after surgery.

===Pain===
Pain medications (such as morphine) do not appear to affect the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis of appendicitis and therefore should be given early in the patient&#x27;s care. Historically there were concerns among some general surgeons that analgesics would affect the clinical exam in children, and some recommended that they not be given until the surgeon was able to examine the person.

===Surgery===


The surgical procedure for the removal of the appendix is called an appendectomy. A negative appendectomy consitutes the removal of a normal appendix with no sign of inflammation in histopathology examination. The prevalence of negative appendectomy varies but has been estimated to 13%. Appendectomy can be performed through open or laparoscopic surgery. Laparoscopic appendectomy has several advantages over open appendectomy as an intervention for acute appendicitis.

====Open appendectomy====
For over a century, laparotomy (open appendectomy) was the standard treatment for acute appendicitis. This procedure consists of the removal of the infected appendix through a single large incision in the lower right area of the abdomen. The incision in a laparotomy is usually long.

During an open appendectomy, the person with suspected appendicitis is placed under general anesthesia to keep the muscles completely relaxed and to keep the person unconscious. The incision is two to three inches (76 mm) long, and it is made in the right lower abdomen, several inches above the hip bone. Once the incision opens the abdomen cavity, and the appendix is identified, the surgeon removes the infected tissue and cuts the appendix from the surrounding tissue. After careful and close inspection of the infected area, and ensuring there are no signs that surrounding tissues are damaged or infected. In case of complicated appendicitis managed by an emergency open appendectomy, abdominal drainage (a temporary tube from the abdomen to the outside to avoid abscess formation) may be inserted, but this may increase the hospital stay. The surgeon will start closing the incision. This means sewing the muscles and using surgical staples or stitches to close the skin up. To prevent infections, the incision is covered with a sterile bandage or surgical adhesive.

====Laparoscopic appendectomy====
Laparoscopic appendectomy was introduced in 1983 and has become an increasingly prevalent intervention for acute appendicitis. This surgical procedure consists of making three to four incisions in the abdomen, each long. This type of appendectomy is made by inserting a special surgical tool called a laparoscope into one of the incisions. The laparoscope is connected to a monitor outside the person&#x27;s body, and it is designed to help the surgeon inspect the infected area in the abdomen. The other two incisions are made for the specific removal of the appendix by using surgical instruments. Laparoscopic surgery requires general anesthesia, and it can last up to two hours. Laparoscopic appendectomy has several advantages over open appendectomy, including a shorter post-operative recovery, less post-operative pain, and a lower superficial surgical site infection rate. However, the occurrence of an intra-abdominal abscess is almost three times more prevalent in laparoscopic appendectomy than open appendectomy.

==== Laparoscopic-assisted transumbilical appendectomy ====
In pediatric patients, the high mobility of the cecum allows externalization of the appendix through the umbilicus, and the entire procedure can be performed with a single incision. Laparoscopic-assisted transumbilical appendectomy is a relatively recent technique but with a long published series and very good surgical and aesthetic results.

====Pre-surgery====
The treatment begins by keeping the person who will be having surgery from eating or drinking for a given period, usually overnight. An intravenous drip is used to hydrate the person who will be having surgery. Antibiotics given intravenously such as cefuroxime and metronidazole may be administered early to help kill bacteria and thus reduce the spread of infection in the abdomen and postoperative complications in the abdomen or wound. Equivocal cases may become more difficult to assess with antibiotic treatment and benefit from serial examinations. If the stomach is empty (no food in the past six hours), general anaesthesia is usually used. Otherwise, spinal anaesthesia may be used.

Once the decision to perform an appendectomy has been made, the preparation procedure takes approximately one to two hours. Meanwhile, the surgeon will explain the surgery procedure and will present the risks that must be considered when performing an appendectomy. (With all surgeries there are risks that must be evaluated before performing the procedures.) The risks are different depending on the state of the appendix. If the appendix has not ruptured, the complication rate is only about 3% but if the appendix has ruptured, the complication rate rises to almost 59%. The most usual complications that can occur are pneumonia, hernia of the incision, thrombophlebitis, bleeding and adhesions. Evidence indicates that a delay in obtaining surgery after admission results in no measurable difference in outcomes to the person with appendicitis. Most patients undergo emergency surgery, but delayed surgery (interval appendectomy) has been investigated for certain patients. Delaying surgery for weeks may increase the risk of intra-abdominal abscess in patients suffering from appendicitis and presenting with an appendiceal mass (e.g., phlegmon or abscess). The harms and benefits of delaying surgery for other complications are uncertain. 

The surgeon will explain how long the recovery process should take. Abdomen hair is usually removed to avoid complications that may appear regarding the incision.

In most cases, patients going in for surgery experience nausea or vomiting that require medication before surgery. Antibiotics, along with pain medication, may be administered before appendectomies.

====After surgery====

Hospital lengths of stay typically range from a few hours to a few days but can be a few weeks if complications occur. The recovery process may vary depending on the severity of the condition: if the appendix had ruptured or not before surgery. Appendix surgery recovery is generally much faster if the appendix does not rupture. It is important that people undergoing surgery respect their doctor&#x27;s advice and limit their physical activity so the tissues can heal. Recovery after an appendectomy may not require diet changes or a lifestyle change.

The length of hospital stays for appendicitis varies on the severity of the condition. A study from the United States found that in 2010, the average appendicitis hospital stay was 1.8 days. For stays where the person&#x27;s appendix had ruptured, the average length of stay was 5.2 days.

After surgery, the patient will be transferred to a postanesthesia care unit, so their vital signs can be closely monitored to detect anesthesia- or surgery-related complications. Pain medication may be administered if necessary. After patients are completely awake, they are moved to a hospital room to recover. Most individuals will be offered clear liquids the day after the surgery, then progress to a regular diet when the intestines start to function correctly. Patients are recommended to sit on the edge of the bed and walk short distances several times a day. Moving is mandatory, and pain medication may be given if necessary. Full recovery from appendectomies takes about four to six weeks but can be prolonged to up to eight weeks if the appendix has ruptured.

==Prognosis==
Most people with appendicitis recover quickly after surgical treatment, but complications can occur if treatment is delayed or if peritonitis occurs. Recovery time depends on age, condition, complications, and other circumstances, including the amount of alcohol consumption, but usually is between 10 and 28 days. For young children (around ten years old), the recovery takes three weeks.

The possibility of peritonitis is the reason why acute appendicitis warrants rapid evaluation and treatment. People with suspected appendicitis may have to undergo a medical evacuation. Appendectomies have occasionally been performed in emergency conditions (i.e., not in a proper hospital) when a timely medical evacuation was impossible.

Typical acute appendicitis responds quickly to appendectomy and occasionally will resolve spontaneously. If appendicitis resolves spontaneously, it remains controversial whether an elective interval appendectomy should be performed to prevent a recurrent episode of appendicitis. Atypical appendicitis (associated with suppurative appendicitis) is more challenging to diagnose and is more apt to be complicated even when operated early. In either condition, prompt diagnosis and appendectomy yield the best results with full recovery in two to four weeks usually. Mortality and severe complications are unusual but do occur, especially if peritonitis persists and is untreated.

Another entity known as the appendicular lump is talked about. It happens when the appendix is not removed early during infection, and the omentum and intestine adhere to it, forming a palpable lump. During this period, surgery is risky unless there is pus formation evident by fever and toxicity or by ultrasound. Medical management treats the condition.

An unusual complication of an appendectomy is &quot;stump appendicitis&quot;: inflammation occurs in the remnant appendiceal stump left after a prior incomplete appendectomy. Stump appendicitis can occur months to years after initial appendectomy and can be identified with imaging modalities such as ultrasound.

==History==
The history of appendicitis traces back to ancient medical texts, though its clear clinical understanding emerged in the 19th century. Berengario da Carpi provided the first recorded description of the appendix in the 16th century, followed by Andreas Vesalius and Gabriele Falloppio. Clinical understanding progressed in the 18th and 19th centuries, marked by Lorenz Heister&#x27;s autopsy findings, Claudius Aymand&#x27;s surgical intervention, and J. Mestivier&#x27;s operation for appendicitis. Prior to the use of the term &quot;appendicitis&quot;, it was described with terms including &quot;perityphlitis&quot;, &quot;typhlitis&quot;, &quot;paratyphlitis&quot;, and &quot;extra-peritoneal abscess of the right iliac fossa&quot;. The term &quot;appendicitis&quot; was coined by the American physician Reginald Heber Fitz in 1886, leading to standardized diagnosis and treatment, including Charles McBurney&#x27;s identification of McBurney&#x27;s point. Modern appendectomy techniques evolved in the early 20th century, coinciding with advancements in pathology, notably demonstrated by Ludwig Aschoff in 1908.

==Epidemiology==


Appendicitis is most common between the ages of 5 and 40. In 2013, it resulted in 72,000 deaths globally, down from 88,000 in 1990.

In the United States, there were nearly 293,000 hospitalizations involving appendicitis in 2010. Appendicitis is one of the most frequent diagnoses for emergency department visits resulting in hospitalization among children ages 5–17 years in the United States.

Adults presenting to the emergency department with a known family history of appendicitis are more likely to have this disease than those without.

<text>The Great Barrier Reef is the world&#x27;s largest coral reef system, composed of over 2,900 individual reefs and 900 islands stretching for over over an area of approximately . The reef is located in the Coral Sea, off the coast of Queensland, Australia, separated from the coast by a channel wide in places and over deep. The Great Barrier Reef can be seen from outer space and is the world&#x27;s biggest single structure made by living organisms. This reef structure is composed of and built by billions of tiny organisms, known as coral polyps. It supports a wide diversity of life and was selected as a World Heritage Site in 1981. CNN labelled it one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World in 1997. Australian World Heritage places included it in its list in 2007. The Queensland National Trust named it a state icon of Queensland in 2006.

A large part of the reef is protected by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, which helps to limit the impact of human use, such as fishing and tourism. Other environmental pressures on the reef and its ecosystem include runoff of humanmade pollutants, climate change accompanied by mass coral bleaching, dumping of dredging sludge and cyclic population outbreaks of the crown-of-thorns starfish. According to a study published in October 2012 by the &quot;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&quot;, the reef has lost more than half its coral cover since 1985, a finding reaffirmed by a 2020 study which found over half of the reef&#x27;s coral cover to have been lost between 1995 and 2017, with the effects of a widespread 2020 bleaching event not yet quantified.

The Great Barrier Reef has long been known to and used by the Aboriginal Australian and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and is an important part of local groups&#x27; cultures and spirituality. The reef is a very popular destination for tourists, especially in the Whitsunday Islands and Cairns regions. Tourism is an important economic activity for the region, generating over AUD$3 billion per year. In November 2014, Google launched Google Underwater Street View in 3D of the Great Barrier Reef.

A March 2016 report stated that coral bleaching was more widespread than previously thought, seriously affecting the northern parts of the reef as a result of warming ocean temperatures. In October 2016, &quot;Outside&quot; published an obituary for the reef; the article was criticised for being premature and hindering efforts to bolster the resilience of the reef. In March 2017, the journal &quot;Nature&quot; published a paper showing that huge sections of an stretch in the northern part of the reef had died in the course of 2016 of high water temperatures, an event that the authors put down to the effects of global climate change. The percentage of baby corals being born on the Great Barrier Reef dropped drastically in 2018 and scientists are describing it as the early stage of a &quot;huge natural selection event unfolding&quot;. Many of the mature breeding adults died in the bleaching events of 2016–17, leading to low coral birth rates. The types of corals that reproduced also changed, leading to a &quot;long-term reorganisation of the reef ecosystem if the trend continues.&quot;

The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975 (section 54) stipulates an Outlook Report on the Reef&#x27;s health, pressures, and future every five years. The last report was published in 2019. In March 2022, another mass bleaching event has been confirmed, which raised further concerns about the future of this reef system, especially when considering the possible effects of El Niño weather phenomenon.

The Australian Institute of Marine Science conducts annual surveys of the Great Barrier Reef&#x27;s status, and the 2022 report showed the greatest recovery in 36 years. It is mainly due to the regrowth of two-thirds of the reef by the fast-growing Acropora coral, which is the dominant coral there.

==&quot;Discovery&quot; and naming==

The Great Barrier Reef has long been known to and used by the Aboriginal Australian and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and is an important part of local groups&#x27; cultures and spirituality.

The first European to sight the Great Barrier Reef was James Cook in 1770, who sailed and mapped the east coast of Australia. On 11 June 1770 Cook&#x27;s ship, , ran aground on a shoal south of the present-day location of Cooktown, requiring seven weeks to repair.

It was Matthew Flinders who named the Great Barrier Reef, after his more detailed mapping of it in 1802. Flinders used various terms to describe the reefs comprising what we now call the Great Barrier Reef including &quot;great reef&quot;, for one such reef, &quot;barrier reef&quot;, for any reef preventing a sailing vessel in, or waves from, the open sea, from reaching the coast, and &quot;Barrier Reefs&quot;, for the collection of such reefs.

==Geology and geography==

The Great Barrier Reef is a distinct feature of the East Australian Cordillera division. It reaches from Torres Strait (between Bramble Cay, its northernmost island, and the south coast of Papua New Guinea) in the north to the unnamed passage between Lady Elliot Island (its southernmost island) and Fraser Island in the south. Lady Elliot Island is located southeast of Bramble Cay as the crow flies. It includes the smaller Murray Islands.

The plate tectonic theory indicates Australia has moved northwards at a rate of per year, starting during the Cenozoic. Eastern Australia experienced a period of tectonic uplift, which moved the drainage divide in Queensland inland. Also during this time, Queensland experienced volcanic eruptions leading to central and shield volcanoes and basalt flows. Some of these became volcanic islands. After the Coral Sea Basin formed, coral reefs began to grow in the Basin, but until about 25 million years ago, northern Queensland was still in temperate waters south of the tropicstoo cool to support coral growth. The Great Barrier Reef&#x27;s development history is complex; after Queensland drifted into tropical waters, it was largely influenced by reef growth and decline as sea level changed.

Reefs can increase in diameter by per year, and grow vertically anywhere from per year; however, they grow only above a depth of due to their need for sunlight, and cannot grow above sea level. When Queensland edged into tropical waters 24 million years ago, some coral grew, but a sedimentation regime quickly developed with erosion of the Great Dividing Range; creating river deltas, oozes and turbidites, unsuitable conditions for coral growth. 10 million years ago, the sea level significantly lowered, which further enabled sedimentation. The reef&#x27;s substrate may have needed to build up from the sediment until its edge was too far away for suspended sediments to inhibit coral growth. In addition, approximately 400,000 years ago there was a particularly warm Interglacial period with higher sea levels and a water temperature change.
The land that formed the of the current Great Barrier Reef was a coastal plain formed from the eroded sediments of the Great Dividing Range with some larger hills (most of which were themselves remnants of older reefs or, in rare cases, volcanoes).
The Reef Research Centre, a Cooperative Research Centre, has found coral &#x27;skeleton&#x27; deposits that date back half a million years. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) considers the earliest evidence of complete reef structures to have been 600,000 years ago. According to the GBRMPA, the current, living reef structure is believed to have begun growing on the older platform about 20,000 years ago. The Australian Institute of Marine Science agrees, placing the beginning of the growth of the current reef at the time of the Last Glacial Maximum. At around that time, sea level was lower than it is today.
From 20,000 years ago until 6,000 years ago, sea level rose steadily around the world. As it rose, the corals could then grow higher on the newly submerged maritime margins of the hills of the coastal plain. By around 13,000 years ago the sea level was only lower than the present day, and corals began to surround the hills of the coastal plain, which were, by then, continental islands. As the sea level rose further still, most of the continental islands were submerged. The corals could then overgrow the submerged hills, to form the present cays and reefs. Sea level here has not risen significantly in the last 6,000 years. The CRC Reef Research Centre estimates the age of the present, living reef structure at 6,000 to 8,000 years old. The shallow water reefs that can be seen in air-photographs and satellite images cover an area of 20,679 km2, most (about 80%) of which has grown on top of limestone platforms that are relics of past (Pleistocene) phases of reef growth.

The remains of an ancient barrier reef similar to the Great Barrier Reef can be found in The Kimberley, Western Australia.

The Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area has been divided into 70 bioregions, of which 30 are reef bioregions. In the northern part of the Great Barrier Reef, ribbon reefs and deltaic reefs have formed; these structures are not found in the rest of the reef system. A previously undiscovered reef, 500 metres tall and 1.5 km wide at the base, was found in the northern area in 2020. There are no atolls in the system, and reefs attached to the mainland are rare.

Fringing reefs are distributed widely, but are most common towards the southern part of the Great Barrier Reef, attached to high islands, for example, the Whitsunday Islands. Lagoonal reefs are found in the southern Great Barrier Reef, and further north, off the coast of Princess Charlotte Bay. reefs are the most common shape of reef in the middle of the system, for example the reefs surrounding Lizard Island. Crescentic reefs are also found in the far north of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, and in the Swain Reefs (20–22 degrees south). Planar reefs are found in the northern and southern parts, near Cape York Peninsula, Princess Charlotte Bay, and Cairns. Most of the islands on the reef are found on planar reefs.

Wonky holes can have localised impact on the reef, providing upwellings of fresh water, sometimes rich in nutrients contributing to eutrophication.

Navigation through and around the reefs is a major challenge. More than 20 ships were recorded lost in the region between 1791 and 1850, Surveys between 1815 and 1860 by Phillip Parker King in the Mermaid, Francis Price Blackwood in HMS &quot;Fly&quot;, Owen Stanley in the &quot;Rattlesnake,&quot; and Henry Mangles Denham in the Herald led to considerable navigational improvements, as they outlined the contrasting advantages and perils of the Inner Route (between Australia&#x27;s east coast and the western edge of the reefs) and the Outer Route, in the open sea.

==Ecology==

The Great Barrier Reef supports an extraordinary diversity of life, including many vulnerable or endangered species, some of which may be endemic to the reef system.
Thirty species of cetaceans have been recorded in the Great Barrier Reef, including the dwarf minke whale, Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin, and the humpback whale. Large populations of dugongs live there. More than 1,500 fish species live on the reef, including the clownfish, red bass, red-throat emperor, and several species of snapper and coral trout. Forty-nine species mass spawn, while eighty-four other species spawn elsewhere in their range. Seventeen species of sea snake live on the Great Barrier Reef in warm waters up to deep and are more common in the southern than in the northern section. None found in the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area are endemic, nor are any endangered.

Six species of sea turtles come to the reef to breed: the green sea turtle, leatherback sea turtle, hawksbill turtle, loggerhead sea turtle, flatback turtle, and the olive ridley. The green sea turtles on the Great Barrier Reef have two genetically distinct populations, one in the northern part of the reef and the other in the southern part. Fifteen species of seagrass in beds attract the dugongs and turtles, and provide fish habitat. The most common genera of seagrasses are &quot;Halophila&quot; and &quot;Halodule&quot;.

Saltwater crocodiles live in mangrove and salt marshes on the coast near the reef. Nesting has not been reported, and the salt water crocodile population in the GBRWHA is wide-ranging but low density. Around 125 species of shark, stingray, skates or chimaera live on the reef. Close to 5,000 species of mollusc have been recorded on the reef, including the giant clam and various nudibranchs and cone snails. Forty-nine species of pipefish and nine species of seahorse have been recorded. At least seven species of frog inhabit the islands.

215 species of birds (including 22 species of seabirds and 32 species of shorebirds) visit the reef or nest or roost on the islands, including the white-bellied sea eagle and roseate tern. Most nesting sites are on islands in the northern and southern regions of the Great Barrier Reef, with 1.4 to 1.7 million birds using the sites to breed. The islands of the Great Barrier Reef also support 2,195 known plant species; three of these are endemic. The northern islands have 300–350 plant species which tend to be woody, whereas the southern islands have 200 which tend to be herbaceous; the Whitsunday region is the most diverse, supporting 1,141 species. The plants are propagated by birds.
There are at least 330 species of ascidians on the reef system with the diameter of . Between 300 and 500 species of bryozoans live on the reef. Four hundred coral species, both hard corals and soft corals inhabit the reef. The majority of these spawn gametes, breeding in mass spawning events that are triggered by the rising sea temperatures of spring and summer, the lunar cycle, and the diurnal cycle. Reefs in the inner Great Barrier Reef spawn during the week after the full moon in October, while the outer reefs spawn in November and December. Its common soft corals belong to 36 genera. Five hundred species of marine algae or seaweed live on the reef, including thirteen species of genus &quot;Halimeda&quot;, which deposit calcareous mounds up to wide, creating mini-ecosystems on their surface which have been compared to rainforest cover.

==Environmental threats==
Climate change, pollution, crown-of-thorns starfish and fishing are the primary threats to the health of this reef system. Other threats include shipping accidents, oil spills, and tropical cyclones. Skeletal Eroding Band, a disease of bony corals caused by the protozoan &quot;Halofolliculina corallasia&quot;, affects 31 coral species. According to a 2012 study by the National Academy of Sciences, since 1985, the Great Barrier Reef has lost more than half of its corals with two-thirds of the loss occurring from 1998 due to the factors listed before. In 2022, the northern and central parts of the reef had the highest amount of coral cover since monitoring began, but the cover in the southern part had decreased and bleaching events occurred more frequently.

===Climate change===
The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority considers the greatest threat to the Great Barrier Reef to be climate change, causing ocean warming which increases coral bleaching. Mass coral bleaching events due to marine heatwaves occurred in the summers of 1998, 2002, 2006, 2016, 2017 and 2020, and coral bleaching is expected to become an annual occurrence. In 2020, a study found that the Great Barrier Reef has lost more than half of its corals since 1995 due to warmer seas driven by climate change. As global warming continues, corals will not be able to keep up with increasing ocean temperatures. Coral bleaching events lead to increased disease susceptibility, which causes detrimental ecological effects for reef communities.

In July 2017 UNESCO published in a draft decision, expressing serious concern about the impact of coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef. The draft decision also warned Australia that it will not meet the targets of the Reef 2050 report without considerable work to improve water quality.

Climate change has implications for other forms of reef lifesome fish&#x27;s preferred temperature range leads them to seek new habitat, thus increasing chick mortality in predatory seabirds. Climate change will also affect the sea turtle&#x27;s population and available habitat.

Bleaching events in benthic coral communities (deeper than ) in the Great Barrier reef are not as well documented as those at shallower depths, but recent research has shown that benthic communities are just as negatively impacted in the face of rising ocean temperatures. Five Great Barrier Reef species of large benthic corals were found bleached under elevated temperatures, affirming that benthic corals are vulnerable to thermal stress.

=== Ocean Acidification ===
A threat for the Great Barrier Reef is the rising levels of ocean acidification. Ocean acidification occurs when excess atmospheric carbon dioxide gets absorbed into the ocean. This causes a decrease in the pH and this alters the chemistry of the ocean&#x27;s water. This reduces the amount of aragonite, a key mineral for coral to grow, in the water. The Great Barrier Reef is predicted to lose aragonite at a rate of about 0.1 per decade this century. The acidic water breaks down the materials that coral and shell building creatures need to grow. 

===Pollution===
Another key threat faced by the Great Barrier Reef is pollution and declining water quality. The rivers of north-eastern Australia pollute the Reef during tropical flood events. Over 90% of this pollution comes from farm runoff. 80% of the land adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef is used for farming including intensive cropping of sugar cane, and major beef cattle grazing. Farming practices damage the reef due to overgrazing, increased run-off of agricultural sediments, nutrients and chemicals including fertilisers, herbicides and pesticides representing a major health risk for the coral and biodiversity of the reefs.

According to a 2016 report, while higher regulation contributes to less overall pollution from &quot;other land uses, such as industrial, mining, port development, dredging and urban development&quot;, these can still be locally significant. Sediments containing high levels of copper and other heavy metals sourced from the Ok Tedi Mine in Papua New Guinea are a potential pollution risk for the far northern Great Barrier Reef and Torres Strait regions. Some 67% of corals died in the reef&#x27;s worst-hit northern section, the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies report said.

====Loss of coastal wetland====
The runoff problem is exacerbated by the loss of coastal wetlands which act as a natural filter for toxins and help deposit sediment. It is thought that the poor water quality is due to increased light and oxygen competition from algae.

====Eutrophication====
Farming fertiliser runoff release nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium into the oceanic ecosystem, and these limiting nutrients cause massive algal growth which eventually leads to a reduction in oxygen available for other creatures in a process called eutrophication. This decreases the biodiversity in the affected areas, altering the species composition. A study by Katharina Fabricius and Glen Death of Australian Institute of Marine Science found that hard corals numbers were almost double on reefs that were far from agricultural areas.

Fertilizers also increase the amount of phytoplankton available for the crown-of-thorns starfish larvae to consume. A study showed that a doubling of the chlorophyll in the water leads to a tenfold increase in the crown-of-thorns starfish larvae&#x27;s survival rate.

====Sediment runoff====
Sediment runoff from farming carries chemicals into the reef environment also reduces the amount of light available to the corals decreasing their ability to extract energy from their environment.

====Pesticides====
Pesticides used in farming are made up of heavy metals such as lead, mercury, arsenic and other toxins are released into the wider environment due to erosion of farm soil, which has a detrimental effect on the coral.

====Pollution from mining====
Mining company Queensland Nickel discharged nitrate-laden water into the Great Barrier Reef in 2009 and 2011 – on the later occasion releasing of waste water. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) stated &quot;We have strongly encouraged the company to investigate options that do not entail releasing the material to the environment and to develop a management plan to eliminate this potential hazard; however, GBRMPA does not have legislative control over how the Yabulu tailings dam is managed&quot;.

===Crown of thorns===

The crown-of-thorns starfish preys on coral polyps. Large outbreaks of these starfish can devastate reefs. In 2000, an outbreak contributed to a loss of 66% of live coral cover on sampled reefs in a study by the Reef Research Centre (RRC). Outbreaks are believed to occur in natural cycles, worsened by poor water quality and overfishing of the starfish&#x27;s predators.

===Overfishing===
The unsustainable overfishing of keystone species, such as the giant Triton, can disrupt food chains vital to reef life. Fishing also impacts the reef through increased water pollution from boats, by-catch of unwanted species (such as dolphins and turtles) and habitat destruction from trawling, anchors and nets. As of the middle of 2004, approximately one-third of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park is protected from species removal of any kind, including fishing, without written permission.
===Shipping===
Shipping accidents are a pressing concern, as several commercial shipping routes pass through the Great Barrier Reef.
Although the route through the Great Barrier Reef is not easy, reef pilots consider it safer than outside the reef in the event of mechanical failure, since a ship can sit safely while being repaired. There have been over 1,600 known shipwrecks in the Great Barrier Reef region.
On 3 April 2010, the bulk coal carrier ran aground on Douglas Shoals, spilling up to four tonnes of oil into the water and causing extensive damage to the reef.

===Shark culling===
The government of Queensland has a &quot;shark control&quot; program (shark culling) that deliberately kills sharks throughout Queensland, including in the Great Barrier Reef. Environmentalists and scientists say that this program harms the marine ecosystem; they also say it is &quot;outdated, cruel and ineffective&quot;. The Queensland &quot;shark control&quot; program uses shark nets and drum lines with baited hooks to kill sharks in the Great Barrier Reef – there are 173 lethal drum lines in the Great Barrier Reef. In Queensland, sharks found alive on the baited hooks are shot. Queensland&#x27;s &quot;shark control&quot; program killed about 50,000 sharks from 1962 to 2018. Also, Queensland&#x27;s &quot;shark control&quot; program has also killed many other animals (such as dolphins and turtles)the program killed 84,000 marine animals from 1962 to 2015, including in the Great Barrier Reef. In 2018, Humane Society International filed a lawsuit against the government of Queensland to stop shark culling in the Great Barrier Reef.

== Protection and preservation: Reef 2050 plan ==

In March 2015, the Australian and Queensland&#x27;s governments formed a plan for the protection and preservation of the reef&#x27;s universal heritage until 2050. This 35 years plan, titled &quot;Reef 2050 Plan&quot; is a document proposing possible measures for the long-term management of the pollution, climate change and other issues that threaten the life span and value of this global heritage. The plan contains all the elements for measurement and improvements, including; long-term sustainability plan, water quality improvement plan and the investment plan for the protection and preservation of The Reef until 2050.

However, whereas the 2050 plan aims to incorporate protective measures such as improving water quality, reef restoration, killing of predatory starfish, it does not incorporate additional measures to address what may be the root cause the problem – climate change, which is caused by greenhouse gas emissions. As such, experts doubted whether it would be enough to save the fragile environment. Another issue is that the time left to the 1.5 °C warming threshold (the temperature limit that coral reefs can still cope with) is very limited.

As part of the Reef 2050 plan, an AUD$443 million grant was given to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation in 2018. The announcement of the grant was subject to backlash as the grant had avoided proper tender and transparency processes.

=== Conservation Policy: Reef 2050 Water Quality Improvement Plan ===
The Great Barrier Reef contributes to the overall wellbeing of the marine biome. Numerous species of aquatic plants, fish and megafauna use the reef for feeding, shelter and mating. Threats such as ocean acidification, pollution runoff and outbreaks of destructive species like the crown-of-thorns starfish have brought about the decline of this ecosystem. These threats to the reef are not only a danger to the organisms inhabiting it, but also the economy of this region, a large part of which relies on revenue from ecotourism of the Great Barrier Reef.

The Australian government has had the goal of protecting this World Heritage Site since 1972 when they created The Australian Institute of Marine Science. The Australian and Queensland governments have contributed about $142.5 million to their National Environmental Science Program which is how they&#x27;ve collected much of their data regarding threats to the Great Barrier Reef. In addition, the Reef 2050 Water Quality Improvement Plan was announced in 2018 in order to help transition local communities, agricultural organizations and industries to more sustainable practices. This plan will join the Queensland government and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority to manage the amounts of runoff that reach the Great Barrier Reef as well as mitigating crown-of-thorns starfish population flare-ups.

==Human use==
The Great Barrier Reef has long been known to and used by the Aboriginal Australian and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Aboriginal Australians have been living in the area for at least 40,000 years, and Torres Strait Islanders since about 10,000 years ago. For these 70 or so clan groups, the reef is also an important cultural feature.

In 1768, Louis de Bougainville encountered the reef, but did not explore it. On 11 June 1770, , captained by explorer James Cook, ran on the Great Barrier Reef, sustaining considerable damage. Lightening the ship and re-floating it during an incoming tide eventually saved it. One of the most famous wrecks was , which sank on 29 August 1791, killing 35 men. The Queensland Museum has led archaeological digs to wreck of &quot;Pandora&quot; since 1983. Because the reef had no atolls, it was largely unstudied in the 19th century. During this time, some of the reef&#x27;s islands were mined for deposits of guano, and lighthouses were built as beacons throughout the system. as in Raine Island, the earliest example. In 1922, the Great Barrier Reef Committee began carrying out much of the early research on the reef.

===Management===

Royal Commissions disallowed oil drilling in the Great Barrier Reef, in 1975 the Government of Australia created the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and prohibited various activities. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park does not include the entire Great Barrier Reef Province. The park is managed, in partnership with the Government of Queensland, through the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority to ensure that it is used in a sustainable manner. A combination of zoning, management plans, permits, education and incentives (such as eco-tourism certification) are employed in the effort to conserve the reef.

In 1999, the Australian Parliament passed the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, which improved the operation of national environmental law by providing guidance about regional biodiversity conservation priorities. The marine bioregional planning process came from the implementation of this law. This process conserves marine biodiversity by considering the whole ecosystem a species is in and how different species interact in the marine environment.

There are two steps to this process. The first step is to identify regional conservation priorities in the five (currently) different marine regions. The second step is to identify marine reserves (protected areas or marine parks) to be added to Australia&#x27;s National Representative System of Marine Protected Areas. Like protected areas on land, marine reserves are created to protect biodiversity for generations to come. Marine reserves are identified based on criteria written in a document created by Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council called &quot;Guidelines for establishing the national representative system of marine protected areas&quot;, also known as just &quot;the Guidelines&quot;. These guidelines are nationally recognised and implemented at the local level based on the Australian policy for implementation outlined in the &quot;Goals and Principles for the Establishment of the National Representative System of Marine Protected Areas in Commonwealth Waters&quot;. These policies are in place to make sure that a marine reserve is only added to the NRSMPA after careful evaluation of different data.

The priorities for each region are created based on human and environmental threats and the Marine Bioregional Plans are drafted to address these priorities. To assess different region&#x27;s priorities, three steps are taken, first, a bioregional profile is created, second, a bioregional plan is drafted, and third, the plan is finalised. After the plan is finalised, activity in different bioregions may become limited based on particular threats an activity may pose.

In 2001, the GBRMPA released a report about the declining water quality in the Great Barrier Reef and detailed the importance of this issue. In response to this report, in 2003, the Australian and Queensland governments launched a joint initiative to improve the quality of water entering the Great Barrier Reef. The decline in the quality of water over the past 150 years (due to development) has contributed to coral bleaching, algal blooms, and pesticide pollution. These forms of pollution have made the reef less resilient to climate change.

When the plan was introduced in October 2003, it originally contained 65 actions built on previous legislation. Their immediate goal was to halt and reverse the decline in water quality entering the reef by 2013. By 2020, they hope that the quality of the water entering in the reef improves enough so that it doesn&#x27;t have a detrimental impact on the health of the Great Barrier Reef. To achieve these goals they decided to reduce pollutants in the water entering the reef and to rehabilitate and conserve areas of the reef that naturally help reduce water pollutants. To achieve the objectives described above, this plan focuses on non-point sources of pollution, which cannot be traced to a single source such as a waste outlet.

The plan specifically targets nutrients, pesticides and sediment that make their way into the reef as a result of agricultural activities. Other non-point sources of pollution that are attributed to urban areas are covered under different legislation. In 2009, the plan was updated. The updated version states that to date, none of the efforts undertaken to improve the quality of water entering the reef has been successful. The new plan attempts to address this issue by &quot;targeting priority outcomes, integrating industry and community initiatives and incorporating new policy and regulatory frameworks (Reef Plan 5)&quot;. This updated version has improved the clarity of the previous plan and targets set by that plan, have improved accountability and further improved monitoring and assessment. The 2009 report found that 41 out of the 65 actions met their original goals, however, 18 were not progressing well according to evaluation criteria as well as 6 were rated as having unsatisfactory levels of progress.

Some key achievements made since the plan&#x27;s initial passing in 2003 were the establishment of the Reef Quality Partnership to set targets, report findings and monitor progress towards targets, improved land condition by landowners was rewarded with extended leases, Water Quality Improvement Plans were created to identify regional targets and identified management changes that needed to be made to reach those targets, Nutrient Management Zones have been created to combat sediment loss in particular areas, education programs have been started to help gather support for sustainable agriculture, changes to land management practices have taken place through the implementation of the Farm Management Systems and codes of practice, the creation of the Queensland Wetland program and other achievements were made to help improve the water quality flowing into the coral reefs.

A taskforce of scientists was also created to assess the impact of different parts of the plan on the quality of water flowing into the coral reefs. They found that many of the goals have yet to be reached but found more evidence that states that improving the water quality of the Great Barrier Reef will improve its resilience to climate change. The Reefocus summit in 2008, which is also detailed in the report, came to similar conclusions. After this, a stakeholder working group was formed that worked between several groups as well as the Australian and Queensland governments to update reef goals and objectives. The updated version of the plan focuses on strategic priority areas and actions to achieve 2013 goals. Also quantitative targets have been made to critically assess whether targets are being met.

Some examples of the water quality goals outlined by this plan are that by 2013, there will be a 50% reduction in nitrogen and phosphorus loads at the end of catchments and that by 2020, there will be a reduction in sediment load by 20%. The plan also outlines a number of steps that must be taken by landholders to help improve grazing, soil, nutrient, and chemical management practices. There are also a number of supporting initiatives to take place outlined in the plan to help create a framework to improve land use practices which will in turn improve water quality.

Through these means the governments of Australia and Queensland hope to improve water quality by 2013. The 2013 outlook report and revised water quality plan will assess what needs to be done in the future to improve water quality and the livelihoods of the wildlife that resides there.
In July 2004, a new zoning plan took effect for the entire Marine Park, and has been widely acclaimed as a new global benchmark for marine ecosystem conservation. The rezoning was based on the application of systematic conservation planning techniques, using marxan software. While protection across the Marine Park was improved, the highly protected zones increased from 4.5% to over 33.3%. At the time, it was the largest Marine Protected Area in the world, although in 2006, the new Northwestern Hawaiian Islands National Monument became the largest.

In 2006, a review of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act of 1975 recommended that there should be no further zoning plan changes until 2013, and that every five years, a peer-reviewed outlook report should be published, examining the reef&#x27;s health, management, and environmental pressures. In each outlook report, several assessments are required. Each assessment has a set of assessment criteria that allows for better presentation of available evidence. Each assessment is judged by these criteria and given a grade. Every outlook report follows the same judging and grading process so that information can be tracked over time. No new research is done to produce the report. Only readily available information goes into the report so little of what is known about the Reef is actually featured in each outlook report.

====Abbot Point coal port dredge dumping controversy====
In December 2013, Greg Hunt, the Australian environment minister, approved a plan for dredging to create three shipping terminals as part of the construction of a coalport. According to corresponding approval documents, the process will create around 3 million cubic metres of dredged seabed that will be dumped within the Great Barrier Reef marine park area.

On 31 January 2014, the GBRMPA issued a dumping permit that will allow three million cubic metres of sea bed from Abbot Point, north of Bowen, to be transported and unloaded in the waters of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Potential significant harms have been identified in relation to dredge spoil and the process of churning up the sea floor in the area and exposing it to air: firstly, new research shows the finer particles of dredge spoil can cloud the water and block sunlight, thereby starving sea grass and coral up to distances of 80 km away from the point of origin due to the actions of wind and currents. Furthermore, dredge spoil can literally smother reef or sea grass to death, while storms can repeatedly resuspend these particles so that the harm caused is ongoing; secondly, disturbed sea floor can release toxic substances into the surrounding environment.

The dredge spoil from the Abbot Point port project is to be dumped away, near Bowen in north Queensland, and the approval from the Authority will result in the production of an extra 70 million tonnes of coal annually, worth between A$1.4 billion and $2.8 billion. Authority chairman, Dr Russell Reichelt, stated after the confirmation of the approval:
This approval is in line with the agency&#x27;s view that port development along the Great Barrier Reef coastline should be limited to existing ports. As a deepwater port that has been in operation for nearly 30 years, Abbot Point is better placed than other ports along the Great Barrier Reef coastline to undertake expansion as the capital and maintenance dredging required will be significantly less than what would be required in other areas. It&#x27;s important to note the seafloor of the approved disposal area consists of sand, silt and clay and does not contain coral reefs or seagrass beds.

The approval was provided with a corresponding set of 47 new environmental conditions that include the following:
* A long-term water quality monitoring plan extending five years after the disposal activity is completed.
* A heritage management plan to protect the Catalina second world war aircraft wreck in Abbot Bay.
* The establishment of an independent dredging and disposal technical advice panel and a management response group, to include community representatives.

The Australian Federal Government announced on 13 November that there would now be a ban on the dumping of dredge spoil in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. The World Heritage Committee asked Environment Minister Greg Hunt to investigate alternative options to dump on land instead. The Queensland government and the Commonwealth have now accepted the alternative option and advice from The World Heritage Committee and will now commence dumping on land.
===Tourism===

Due to its vast biodiversity, warm clear waters and accessibility from the tourist boats called &quot;live aboards&quot;, the reef is a very popular destination, especially for scuba divers. Tourism on the Great Barrier Reef is concentrated in Cairns and also The Whitsundays due to their accessibility. These areas make up 7–8% of the park&#x27;s area. The Whitsundays and Cairns have their own Plans of Management. Many cities along the Queensland coast offer daily boat trips. Several continental and coral cay islands are now resorts, including Green Island and Lady Elliot Island. As of 1996, 27 islands on the Great Barrier Reef supported resorts.

In 1996, most of the tourism in the region was domestically generated and the most popular visiting times were during the Australian winter. At this time, it was estimated that tourists to the Great Barrier Reef contributed A$776 million per annum. As the largest commercial activity in the region, it was estimated in 2003 that tourism generated over A$4 billion annually, and the 2005 estimate increased to A$5.1 billion. A Deloitte report published by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority in March 2013 states that the Reef&#x27;s 2,000 kilometres of coastline attracts tourism worth A$6.4 billion annually and employs more than 64,000 people.

Approximately two million people visit the Great Barrier Reef each year. Although most of these visits are managed in partnership with the marine Tourism industry, there is a concern among the general public that tourism is harmful to the Great Barrier Reef.

A variety of boat tours and cruises are offered, from single day trips, to longer voyages. Boat sizes range from dinghies to superyachts. Glass-bottomed boats and underwater observatories are also popular, as are helicopter flights. By far, the most popular tourist activities on the Great Barrier Reef are snorkelling and diving, for which pontoons are often used, and the area is often enclosed by nets. The outer part of the Great Barrier Reef is favoured for such activities, due to water quality.

Management of tourism in the Great Barrier Reef is geared towards making tourism ecologically sustainable. A daily fee is levied that goes towards research of the Great Barrier Reef. This fee ends up being 20% of the GBRMPA&#x27;s income.
Policies on cruise ships, bareboat charters, and anchorages limit the traffic on the Great Barrier Reef.

The problems that surround ecotourism in the Great Barrier Reef revolve around permanent tourism platforms. Platforms are large, ship-like vessels that act as a base for tourists while scuba diving and snorkelling in the Great Barrier Reef. Seabirds will land on the platforms and defecate which will eventually be washed into the sea. The feces carry nitrogen, phosphorus and often DDT and mercury, which cause aspergillosis, yellow-band disease, and black band disease. Areas without tourism platforms have 14 out of 9,468 (1.1%) diseased corals versus areas with tourism platforms that have 172 out of 7,043 (12%) diseased corals. Tourism is a major economic activity for the region. Thus, while non-permanent platforms could be possible in some areas, overall, permanent platforms are likely a necessity. Solutions have been suggested to siphon bird waste into gutters connecting to tanks helping lower runoff that causes coral disease.

The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has also placed many permanent anchorage points around the general use areas. These act to reduce damage to the reef due to anchoring destroying soft coral, chipping hard coral, and disturbing sediment as it is dragged across the bottom. Tourism operators also must comply with speed limits when travelling to or from tourist destinations, to prevent excessive wake from the boats disturbing the reef ecosystem.

===Fishing===
The fishing industry in the Great Barrier Reef, controlled by the Queensland Government, is worth A$1 billion annually. It employs approximately 2000 people, and fishing in the Great Barrier Reef is pursued commercially, for recreation, and as a traditional means for feeding one&#x27;s family.

===Dugong hunting===
Under the Native Title Act 1993, native title holders retain the right to legally hunt dugongs and green turtles for &quot;personal, domestic or non-commercial communal needs&quot;.

Four traditional owners groups agreed to cease the hunting of dugongs in the area in 2011 due to their declining numbers, partially accelerated by seagrass damage from Cyclone Yasi.

<text>The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park protects a large part of Australia&#x27;s Great Barrier Reef from damaging activities. It is a vast multiple-use Marine Park which supports a wide range of uses, including commercial marine tourism, fishing, ports and shipping, recreation, scientific research and Indigenous traditional use. Fishing and the removal of artefacts or wildlife (fish, coral, seashells, etc.) is strictly regulated, and commercial shipping traffic must stick to certain specific defined shipping routes that avoid the most sensitive areas of the park. The Great Barrier Reef is the largest and best known coral reef ecosystem in the world. Its reefs, almost 3000 in total, represent about 10 per cent of all the coral reef areas in the world. It supports an amazing variety of biodiversity, providing a home to thousands of coral and other invertebrate species, bony fish, sharks, rays, marine mammals, marine turtles, sea snakes, as well as algae and other marine plants.

==Managing authority==

The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) is responsible for the care and protection of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. It uses a range of tools to manage the marine park including Acts and Regulations, zoning plan, plans of management, traditional owner agreements, partnerships, stewardship and best practice, education, research and monitoring and reporting. It issues permits for various forms of use of the marine park, and monitors usage in the park to ensure compliance with rules and regulations associated with the park. GBRMPA is funded by Commonwealth Government appropriations and an environmental management charge levied on the permit-holders&#x27; passengers. Currently this is A$6.00 per day per passenger (to a maximum of $16.50 per trip).

In May 2022 the Darumbal people were officially recognised as the traditional custodians of an expanse of ocean covering off the Central Queensland Coast, making it the largest Traditional Use of Marine Resources Agreement (TUMRA) on the reef. The agreement created a partnership with GBRMPA and Queensland&#x27;s Department of Environment and Science. The occasion was marked by a ceremony on the beach at Emu Park.

==Description==
===Extent===

The marine park lies east of the mainland coast of Queensland, starting in the north at Cape York. Its northern boundary is the circle of latitude 10°41&#x27;S (running east up to the eastern edge of the Great Barrier Reef at 145º19&#x27;33&quot;E), thereby encompassing those few uninhabited Torres Strait Islands that are east of Cape York, south of 10°41&#x27;S and north of 11°00&#x27;S. The largest of those island are Albany Island (), Turtle Head Island and Trochus Island . Further islands are Mai Island , Bush Island , Tree Islet , Brewis Island , and a few unnamed islets.

Its southern boundary lies south of Gladstone and north of Bundaberg, taking in Lady Elliot Island.

===Protected area designation===
As of 2016, zones within the marine park has been categorized into the following IUCN protected area categories: 
* IUCN Category Ia with an area of being about of the marine park&#x27;s area,
* IUCN Category II with an area of being about ,
* IUCN Category IV with an area of being about and 
* IUCN Category VI with an area of being about .

==History==
In 1975, the Government of Australia enacted the &quot;Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975&quot;, which created the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, and defined what acts were prohibited on the Reef. Joe Baker, who was involved in the bid to make the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage-listed in 1981, was a founding member of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority.

The Australian Government also has recognised the ecological significance of this Park by its inclusion in the nation&#x27;s Biodiversity Action Plan. The Government of Australia manages the reef through the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and in partnership with the Government of Queensland, to ensure that it is widely understood and used in a sustainable manner. A combination of zoning, management plans, permits, education and incentives (such as eco-tourism certification) is used in the effort to conserve the Great Barrier Reef.

As many species of the Great Barrier Reef are migratory, many international, national, and interstate conventions or pieces of legislation must be taken into account when strategies for conservation are made.

Some international conventions that the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park must follow are: the Bonn Convention, Ramsar Site (for the Bowling Green Bay National Park site), CITES, JAMBA and CAMBA.
Some national legislation that the Park must follow are: Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975,
Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, National Strategy for Ecologically Sustainable Development, National Strategy for the Conservation of Australia&#x27;s Biological Diversity, Australia&#x27;s Oceans Policy, National Strategy for the Conservation of Australian Species and Communities Threatened with Extinction.
Some state legislation that the Park must follow are: Nature Conservation Act 1992, Marine Parks Act 1982, Fisheries Act 1994, Queensland Nature Conservation (Wildlife) Regulation 1994.

For example, the Queensland Government has enacted several plans attempting to regulate fishing. The &quot;East Coast Trawl Management Plan 1999&quot; aimed to regulate trawling through limiting the times when trawling is permitted and restricting gear used. The &quot;Fisheries (Coral Reef Fin Fish Fishery) Management Plan 2003&quot; aimed at reducing the annual commercial catch to 1996 levels, disallowing fishing when the fish are spawning and increasing the minimum legal size of fish.

The Great Barrier Reef was selected as a World Heritage Site in 1981. 
Up until 1999, there were four main zones in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. They were the &quot;Far Northern&quot;, &quot;Cairns&quot;, &quot;Central&quot; and &quot;Mackay/Capricorn&quot; sections. These zoning sections were created between 1983 and 1987. Another section, the &quot;Gumoo Woojabuddee&quot; section was declared in 1998. Each section had its own zoning plan. The &quot;Great Barrier Marine Park Zoning Plan 2003&quot; superseded all previous zoning plans, coming into effect on 1 July 2004.

In July 2004, a new zoning plan was brought into effect for the entire Marine Park, and has been widely acclaimed as a new global benchmark for the conservation of marine ecosystems. The rezoning was based on the application of systematic conservation planning techniques, using the MARXAN software. On 1 July 2004 the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park became the largest protected sea area in the world when the Australian Government increased the areas protected from extractive activities (such as fishing) from 4.6% to 33.3% of the park. , the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands National Monument is the largest protected marine area in the world. The management committee draws inspiration from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority&#x27;s management strategies.

The current method of zoning is called the &quot;Representative Areas Program&quot;, which chooses &quot;typical&quot; areas of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. They can then be protected in &quot;Green Zones&quot; (no-take zones). The Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area has been divided into 70 bioregions, of which 30 are reef bioregions, and 40 are non-reef bioregions.

In 2006, a review was undertaken of the &quot;Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975&quot;. Some recommendations of the review are that there should be no further zoning plan changes until 2013, and that every five years, a peer-reviewed Outlook Report should be published, examining the health of the Great Barrier Reef, the management of the Reef, and environmental pressures.

In early 2007, GBRMPA was one of three nominees for the Destination Award in the World Travel and Tourism Council&#x27;s Tourism for Tomorrow Awards.

On 3 April 2010, the &quot;Shen Neng 1&quot;, a Chinese ship carrying 950 tonnes of oil, ran aground, causing the 2010 Great Barrier Reef oil spill.

In 2012, legislation was introduced which compelled developers to deposit money into the Reef Trust. Professor Tiffany Morrison argues that this has made it easier for developments to be approved in the region.

The week before 21 July 2013, on the second day of the biennial joint training exercise Talisman Saber, two American AV-8B Harrier fighter jets launched from aircraft carrier USS &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; (LHD-6) dropped four bombs, weighing a total 1.8 metric tons (4,000 pounds), into more than 50 metres (164 ft) of water. None exploded and no coral was damaged.

People such as scientists, conservationists, developers, managers, tourism entrepreneurs and politicians have had major influences on the history of the reef In 2015, the Australian Government and Reef Ecologic Pty Ltd conducted a coral reef training course to build capacity to protect coral reefs

==Threats==
===Crown-of-thorns starfish===
The crown-of-thorns starfish (&quot;Acanthaster planci&quot;), while native to the reef, poses one of its greatest threats when outbreaks occur. Several efforts have been made to identify and control these outbreaks, including the COTSBot developed by Queensland University of Technology.

These outbreaks and subsequent threats have led to an increase in awareness and appearances in mainstream media, as industry and conservation groups try to control the COTS and protect the reef. An infographic explaining the process of identifying and targeting this threat can be seen here.

===Outlook for the Reef===
The Great Barrier Reef Outlook Report 2014, published every five years, examines the Great Barrier Reef&#x27;s health, pressures, and likely future.

The report is required under &quot;Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975&quot; (section 54) and aims to provide a regular and reliable means of assessing reef health and management in an accountable and transparent way.

The report finds the greatest risks to the Reef are still climate change, land-based run-off, coastal development, some fishing impacts, illegal fishing and poaching.

==Associated protected areas==

The Great Barrier Reef Coast Marine Park is a marine protected area located in Queensland waters adjoining the Great Barrier Reef. It was created on 5 November 2004 by the amalgamation of the following former marine parks – the Mackay/Capricorn Marine Park, the Townville/Whitsunday Marine Park, the Trinity Inlet/ Marlin Coast Marine Park and the Cairns Marine Park, along with the addition of previously unprotected area of coastal water that adjoined the former marine parks listed above. The marine park is intended to complement the adjoining GBRMP by the use of &quot;similar zone objectives, and entry and use provisions&quot;. It is managed by the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service.

<text>Arthur Ira Garfunkel (born November 5, 1941) is an American singer, actor and poet who is best known for his partnership with Paul Simon in the folk rock duo Simon &amp; Garfunkel. Born in Forest Hills, Queens, New York, Garfunkel became acquainted with Simon through an elementary school play, a production of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;. Their combined presence in music began in the 1950s, and throughout the 1960s the duo of Simon &amp; Garfunkel achieved great chart success with tracks such as &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot;, &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot; (written for the 1967 film &quot;The Graduate&quot;), &quot;Scarborough Fair&quot;, &quot;The Boxer&quot; and &quot;Bridge over Troubled Water&quot;. The latter song&#x27;s title also served as the name of Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#x27;s final album in 1970. Simon &amp; Garfunkel split for personal reasons, but the pair have occasionally reunited in the years since. Both men experienced success in solo careers in the years following the duo&#x27;s breakup.

Highlights of Garfunkel&#x27;s solo music career include one top 10 hit, three top 20 hits, six top 40 hits, 14 Adult Contemporary top 30 singles, five Adult Contemporary number ones, two UK number ones and a People&#x27;s Choice Award. Through his solo and collaborative work, Garfunkel has earned eight Grammy Awards, including a Lifetime Achievement Award. In 1990, he and Simon were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2008, Garfunkel was ranked 86th in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Singers of All Time&quot;.

==Early life==
Garfunkel was born in Forest Hills, Queens, New York City, to Rose (née Pearlman) and Jacob &quot;Jack&quot; Garfunkel, a traveling salesman. Art was a middle child with two brothers, the older Jules and the younger Jerome. Jacob&#x27;s parents had immigrated to the United States at the beginning of the twentieth century and settled in Manhattan. Before his career in sales, Jacob worked as an actor in Dayton, Ohio. Garfunkel is of Moldovian-Jewish descent, his paternal grandparents having emigrated from the city of Iași. When he was young, he often sang in synagogue. His maternal cousin was Lou Pearlman, who ran one of the biggest Ponzi scams in history, and founder of the Backstreet Boys and NSYNC.

According to the &quot;Across America&quot; DVD, Garfunkel&#x27;s love of singing originated in the first grade. &quot;When we were lined up in size order, and after everyone else had left, I&#x27;d stay behind and enjoy the echo sound of the stairwell tiles and sing &#x27;Unchained Melody&#x27; and &#x27;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&#x27;, learning to love this goosebumps song from the tender age of five.&quot; Later, Garfunkel&#x27;s father bought him a wire recorder, and from then on, Garfunkel spent his afternoons singing, recording, and playing it back, so he could listen for flaws and learn how to improve.

At his bar mitzvah in 1954 in the Jewish Center of Kew Gardens Hills, Garfunkel performed as a cantor, singing over four hours of his repertoire for his family. As a young teen, Garfunkel became ill with a lung infection, leading to a love for basketball. He explained in a 1998 interview: &quot;In the summer of &#x27;55, I had a lung infection. I couldn&#x27;t run around, but I loved basketball and there was a hoop nearby. Much of the summer I spent methodically hitting 96, 98 foul shots out of 100. Then 102! I never played on a team after junior high school. Just 3 against 3, half court pick up games in the schoolyard.&quot; He met future singing partner Paul Simon in the sixth grade at PS 164, when they were both cast in the elementary school graduation play, &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;. It has been said by Garfunkel that Simon first became interested in singing after hearing Garfunkel sing a rendition of Nat King Cole&#x27;s &quot;Too Young&quot; in a school talent show.

Between 1956 and 1962, the two performed together as &quot;Tom &amp; Jerry&quot;, a moniker coined by their label Big Records, occasionally performing at school dances. Their idols were The Everly Brothers, whom they imitated in their use of close two-part vocal harmony. In 1957, Simon &amp; Garfunkel recorded the song &quot;Hey, Schoolgirl&quot; under the name Tom &amp; Jerry. The single reached number 49 on the pop charts. After Tom &amp; Jerry came to a close, Garfunkel released two singles under the name Artie Garr: &quot;Dream Alone&quot;/&quot;Beat Love&quot; and &quot;Forgive Me&quot;/&quot;Private World&quot; with Warwick and Octavia Records respectively. Both singles would fail to chart.

After graduating from Forest Hills High School alongside Simon, Garfunkel initially majored in architecture at Columbia University, where he was a brother in the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity and lived in Carman Hall. Garfunkel was a team member in tennis, skiing, fencing, and bowling at the college and also joined the all-male a cappella group on campus, the Columbia Kingsmen. While at Columbia his roommate, Sanford Greenberg, developed glaucoma and went blind. Garfunkel assisted him in his homework by reading his textbooks to Greenberg, who went on to graduate with honors. Another roommate of his was Tishman Speyer founder Jerry Speyer. Greenberg later gave Garfunkel $500 to go and record a demo of &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot;. Garfunkel ultimately earned a BA in art history in 1965, followed by an MA in mathematics education from Teachers College, Columbia University in 1967. He also completed coursework toward a doctorate in the latter discipline at Teachers College, Columbia University during the peak of Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#x27;s commercial success; however, he later dropped out.

==Career==
===Simon and Garfunkel===
In 1963, Garfunkel and Simon (who graduated from Queens College before dropping out of Brooklyn Law School) reformed their duo under their own names as &quot;Simon and Garfunkel&quot;. They released their first album, &quot;Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.&quot; on Columbia Records in October 1964. It was not a critical or commercial success, and the duo split. The next year, producer Tom Wilson lifted the song &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot; from the record, dubbed an electric backing onto it, and released it as a single that went to number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop charts.

Simon had gone to the United Kingdom in 1965 after the initial failure of &quot;Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.&quot;, to pursue a solo career. He briefly teamed with songwriter Bruce Woodley of The Seekers. After &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot; had started to enjoy commercial success, he returned to the US to reunite with Garfunkel. The duo recorded four more influential albums: &quot;Sounds of Silence&quot;; &quot;Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme&quot;; &quot;Bookends&quot;; and the hugely successful &quot;Bridge over Troubled Water&quot;.

They contributed to the soundtrack of the 1967 Mike Nichols film &quot;The Graduate&quot; (starring Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft). While writing &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot;, Simon originally considered the title &quot;Mrs. Roosevelt&quot;. When Garfunkel reported this indecision over the song&#x27;s name to the director, Nichols replied, &quot;Don&#x27;t be ridiculous! We&#x27;re making a movie here! It&#x27;s Mrs. Robinson!&quot;
Simon &amp; Garfunkel traveled together to England in the fall of 1968. They made a concert appearance at Kraft Hall, which was broadcast on the BBC and featured Garfunkel&#x27;s solo performance of &quot;For Emily, Whenever I May Find Her&quot;. He received a standing ovation.

While Garfunkel was not a songwriter, he did write the poem &quot;Canticle&quot; as a re-write of Simon&#x27;s &quot;Side of A Hill&quot; from his debut album, for &quot;Scarborough Fair/Canticle&quot;. He worked as the vocal arranger for the duo, working out by whom the songs would be sung and how each song was produced. He is also credited as having written the arrangement on &quot;The Boxer&quot; and creating &quot;Voices of Old People&quot; (an audio montage) on &quot;Bookends&quot;.

Citing personal differences and divergence in career interests, they split following the release of their most critically acclaimed album, &quot;Bridge over Troubled Water&quot;, in 1970. Each pursued solo projects after 1970. They occasionally reunited, as in 1975 for their Top Ten single &quot;My Little Town&quot;, which Simon originally wrote for Garfunkel, claiming Garfunkel&#x27;s solo output was lacking &quot;bite&quot;. The song was included on their respective solo albums: Simon&#x27;s &quot;Still Crazy After All These Years&quot; and Garfunkel&#x27;s &quot;Breakaway&quot;. Contrary to popular belief, the song is not autobiographical of Simon&#x27;s early life but of Garfunkel&#x27;s childhood in Queens. In 1981, they got together again for a concert in Central Park, followed by a world tour and an aborted reunion album &quot;Think Too Much&quot;, which was eventually released, by Simon without Garfunkel, as &quot;Hearts and Bones&quot;. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990.

In 2003, they reunited when they received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, leading to a US tour: the acclaimed &quot;Old Friends&quot; concert series. It was followed by another in 2004, which culminated in a free concert at the Colosseum in Rome. The concert drew 600,000 people.

===1970–1975: Hiatus and first album===
During a three-year hiatus after Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#x27;s breakup, Garfunkel starred in two Mike Nichols films, &quot;Catch-22&quot; (1970) and &quot;Carnal Knowledge&quot; (1971). He also spent late 1971 to early 1972 working as a mathematics teacher teaching geometry to high school sophomores at the short-lived Litchfield Academy in Connecticut.

In late 1972, with Simon &amp; Garfunkel having released their &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album and briefly reuniting to perform a benefit concert for presidential candidate George McGovern, Garfunkel felt ready to return to his musical career. His first album was 1973&#x27;s &quot;Angel Clare&quot;, which contained &quot;All I Know&quot;, &quot;I Shall Sing&quot; and &quot;Travelling Boy&quot; as singles. The album was received with mixed reviews, reaching number 5 in the U.S. In 1974, Garfunkel released the hit single &quot;Second Avenue&quot;.

On his next album, 1975&#x27;s &quot;Breakaway&quot;, Garfunkel briefly reunited with Simon for the 1975 hit &quot;My Little Town&quot;. The album also included the singles &quot;Break Away&quot; (B-Side: &quot;Disney Girls&quot;) and &quot;I Only Have Eyes for You&quot; (a 1934 song written by Harry Warren), which is noted as Garfunkel&#x27;s first UK number one.

===1976–1979: Solo efforts ===
In 1976, Garfunkel recorded both background and duet vocals for several artists, including Stephen Bishop&#x27;s &quot;Careless&quot; album, James Taylor&#x27;s &quot;In The Pocket&quot; album and JD Souther&#x27;s &quot;Black Rose&quot; album. From December 1976 to September 1977, Garfunkel worked on his next album.

Garfunkel&#x27;s next release was the 1977 album &quot;Watermark&quot; (US No. 19, UK No. 26). It failed to make an impression on the public upon release. Its main single, &quot;Crying in My Sleep&quot; (&quot;Mr. Shuck &#x27;N&#x27; Jive&quot;) (UK No. 25) didn&#x27;t reach the US Top 40. After a two-month hiatus, it was re-released in January 1978, with Garfunkel&#x27;s cover of Sam Cooke&#x27;s &quot;(What a) Wonderful World&quot; (B-Side: &quot;Wooden Planes&quot;), reaching number one on the Adult Contemporary chart and seventeen on the pop chart. Paul Simon and mutual friend James Taylor had contributed backing vocals to the song, which was a huge hit on the US A.C. charts. In 1978, Garfunkel toured the U.S. and Canada extensively with noted guitarist Arlen Roth, John Barlow Jarvis on piano, and Leah Kunkel on second vocals.

Garfunkel&#x27;s last release of the 1970s was the 1979 album &quot;Fate for Breakfast&quot; (US No. 67, UK No. 2). It was his first US flop. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;In A Little While (I&#x27;ll Be on My Way)&quot; (B-Side: &quot;And I Know&quot;) (US AC No. 12) failed to break the top forty, as did his second single, &quot;Since I Don&#x27;t Have You&quot; (B-Side: &quot;When Someone Doesn&#x27;t Want You&quot;) (US No. 53, US AC No. 5, UK No. 38). The album was a huge success in the UK, scoring a number one hit with &quot;Bright Eyes&quot; (B-Side: &quot;Sail on a Rainbow&quot;) (US AC No. 29, UK No. 1) (a song written by Mike Batt). A version of &quot;Bright Eyes&quot; also appeared in the movie &quot;Watership Down&quot;.

Garfunkel&#x27;s girlfriend since 1974, Laurie Bird, died by suicide in June 1979 at their Manhattan apartment, three months after the album&#x27;s release in March. Garfunkel later admitted that the incident left him in a deep depression.

===1980–1995: Depression and withdrawal===
In 1980, he sang on the Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young song &quot;Daylight Again&quot;, featured on the album of the same name.

Garfunkel&#x27;s next album was a low point in his career. The 1981 album, &quot;Scissors Cut&quot; (US No. 113, UK No. 51) (dedicated to Bird), contained three singles, &quot;A Heart in New York&quot; (B-Side: &quot;Is This Love&quot;) (US No. 66, US AC No. 10), &quot;Scissors Cut&quot;, and &quot;Hang On In&quot;. The latter two failed to chart.

Following disappointing sales of &quot;Scissors Cut&quot;, Garfunkel reunited with Simon for &quot;The Concert in Central Park&quot; and a world tour. They had significant disagreements during the tour. In 1984, &quot;Stereo Review Magazine&quot; reported that Simon mixed out Garfunkel&#x27;s voice from a new album. It was initially slated to be a Simon &amp; Garfunkel studio reunion, but was ultimately released as a Simon solo album (&quot;Hearts and Bones&quot;). In 1986, Garfunkel played the part of the butcher on the Mike Batt concept album &quot;The Hunting of the Snark&quot;.

Garfunkel released his first compilation album in 1984, &quot;The Art Garfunkel Album&quot; (UK No. 12), never released in the US, which contained the minor hit &quot;Sometimes When I&#x27;m Dreaming&quot; (UK No. 77, US AC No. 25).

Garfunkel again left the music scene when his father died. In the fall of 1985, he met his future wife, Kathryn &quot;Kim&quot; Cermak; they were married in September 1988. Garfunkel&#x27;s retirement lasted until his 1988 album, &quot;Lefty&quot; (US, No. 134), which produced three singles, &quot;So Much in Love&quot; (US No. 76, US AC No. 11), &quot;When a Man Loves a Woman&quot;, and &quot;This Is the Moment&quot;.

===1996–2006: Resurgence===
Garfunkel&#x27;s live 1996 concert &quot;Across America&quot; (UK No. 35), recorded at the registry hall on Ellis Island, featured musical guests James Taylor, Garfunkel&#x27;s wife, Kim, and their son James.

Garfunkel performed the theme song for the 1991 television series &quot;Brooklyn Bridge&quot; and &quot;The Ballad of Buster Baxter&quot; for a 1998 episode of the children&#x27;s educational television series &quot;Arthur&quot;, where he was depicted as a singing moose. Garfunkel&#x27;s performance of Monty Python member Eric Idle&#x27;s &quot;Always Look on the Bright Side of Life&quot; was used in the end credits of the 1997 film &quot;As Good as It Gets&quot;.

In 2003, Garfunkel made his debut as a songwriter on his &quot;Everything Waits to Be Noticed&quot; album. Teaming up with singer-songwriters Maia Sharp and Buddy Mondlock, the album contained several songs which were originally poems written by Garfunkel.

In 2003, Simon and Garfunkel reunited again for a successful world tour that extended into 2004. That same year, his song &quot;Sometimes When I&#x27;m Dreaming&quot; from &quot;The Art Garfunkel Album&quot; (1984) (written by Mike Batt) was re-recorded by ABBA singer Agnetha Fältskog on her album &quot;My Colouring Book&quot;.

In 2006, Garfunkel signed with Rhino Records (revived Atco Records), releasing his first Rhino/Atco album &quot;Some Enchanted Evening&quot; in the United States on January 30, 2007. The album was a dedicated celebration of pop standards of Garfunkel&#x27;s childhood.

===2008–present: Recent events and vocal problems===
In 2009, Garfunkel appeared as himself on the HBO television show &quot;Flight of the Conchords&quot; episode entitled &quot;Prime Minister&quot;.

Garfunkel continued to tour in 2009 with four musicians and his son.

On February 13, 2009, Simon and his band re-opened New York&#x27;s Beacon Theatre, which had been closed for seven months for renovation. As an encore, Simon brought out &quot;my old friend, Art Garfunkel&quot;. They sang three songs: &quot;Sound of Silence&quot;, &quot;The Boxer&quot;, and &quot;Old Friends&quot;.

On April 2, 2009, the duo announced a tour of Australia, New Zealand, and Japan for summer 2009. In late October, they participated together in the 25th anniversary of Rock and Roll Hall of Fame concerts at New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden. Other artists on the bill included Bruce Springsteen &amp; The E Street Band, U2, Metallica, Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder, and Crosby, Stills, &amp; Nash.

In January 2010, Garfunkel developed vocal problems following damage to his vocal cords as the result of an incident in which he had briefly choked on a piece of lobster. In March 2010, Simon &amp; Garfunkel announced a 13-date tour. According to a press release, the set list would focus on their classic catalog as well as songs from each of their solo careers. The first date in the tour was on April 24, a headlining set at the 2010 New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival. Due to his vocal cord injury, singing proved difficult for Garfunkel. &quot;I was terrible, and crazy nervous. I leaned on Paul Simon and the affection of the crowd,&quot; he told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; several years later. Several months later on June 10, they performed &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot; at an AFI Life Achievement Award tribute to director Mike Nichols, in what proved to be their last performance together to date. On June 17, Simon &amp; Garfunkel canceled the tour, previously rescheduled for July 2010, which was postponed indefinitely while Garfunkel attempted to recover from a vocal cord paresis.

In November 2010, Garfunkel said that because of quitting smoking he was recovering from paresis and would be touring in 2011.

He tried to resume touring in August 2012 just after releasing a 34-song retrospective, &quot;The Singer&quot;. Garfunkel scheduled 19 solo shows in the United States and Sweden between August and December 2012. 16 of the shows were canceled. Garfunkel was due to perform at Night of The Proms in Gothenburg and Malmö, Sweden, on September 28 and 29, 2012, but canceled at the last minute due to an &quot;unforeseen vocal issue&quot;. Speaking about his voice in February 2013, Garfunkel said &quot;It&#x27;s getting mostly better; I&#x27;m pretty much there&quot; and that he was starting to book small shows again. In 2014, he resumed touring, with Tab Laven accompanying him on acoustic guitar, his voice restored.

On the September 30, 2015, episode of &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot;, Garfunkel took part in the spoof &quot;Black Simon &amp; Garfunkel&quot; skit with members of The Roots.

The Simon and Garfunkel song &quot;America&quot; was used by Bernie Sanders during his 2016 presidential campaign; Garfunkel appreciated Sanders&#x27; fight against wealth inequality.

On September 26, 2017, Knopf Doubleday published in hardcover Garfunkel&#x27;s memoir &quot;What Is It All but Luminous: Notes from an Underground Man&quot;. Penguin Random House has published it in softcover and audiobook.
On April 10, 2023, Garfunkel canceled his remaining concert dates and his management announced &quot;that he has decided not to return to touring for the foreseeable future.&quot;

In the fall of 2024, Garfunkel announced the release of a new studio album, &quot;Father And Son&quot;, a duets album with his son, Art Garfunkel Jr. &quot;Father And Son&quot; was released on November 8, 2024. The album features twelve cover songs, including &quot;Blackbird&quot;, &quot;Blue Moon&quot;, &quot;Vincent&quot;, and one Simon &amp; Garfunkel song, a new recording of &quot;Old Friends&quot;. 

===Poetry===
Garfunkel, an avid reader and bibliophile, has admitted that while growing up the Garfunkel household was not a literary family and that it was not until entering Columbia University in 1959 that he began to &quot;read a million books and became a reader.&quot; Thus began his interest in poetry.

Garfunkel&#x27;s poetic career began in 1981 while on the Simon &amp; Garfunkel 1981–1982 tour in Switzerland. He was riding a motorcycle and began writing a poem describing the countryside. In 1989, &quot;Still Water&quot;, Garfunkel&#x27;s collection of prose poetry, was released to acclaim. Topics included his depression over the loss of his father; Laurie Bird, his companion who committed suicide; his friendship with Paul Simon; and the joy of returning to music.

Garfunkel&#x27;s website contains a year-by-year listing of every book he has read since 1968. Currently the list contains more than 1,000 books. He has also read the entire Random House Dictionary. Garfunkel has an interest in the philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, having read his book &quot;Confessions&quot; at least three times (according to Garfunkel&#x27;s website, the book was the 1st, 252nd, and 1,000th book he read).

===Acting===
Garfunkel pursued an acting career in the early 1970s, appearing in two Mike Nichols films: &quot;Catch-22&quot; (1970), in which he played a supporting role as the 19-year-old naive Lieutenant Nately, and &quot;Carnal Knowledge&quot; (1971), a co-starring role in which he played the idealistic character Sandy. His role as Sandy secured him a nomination for Best Supporting Actor at the 1972 Golden Globe Awards.

He later appeared in Nicolas Roeg&#x27;s &quot;Bad Timing&quot; (1980) as Alex Linden, an American psychiatrist who serves as the film&#x27;s main antagonist. The film received the Toronto Festival of Festivals&#x27; highest honor, the People&#x27;s Choice Award, and the London Film Critics&#x27; Circle Award for Best Director.

He appeared in &quot;Good to Go&quot; (1986), directed by Blain Novak, starring as a Washington, D.C., journalist who struggles to clear his name after being framed for rape and murder. Garfunkel then appeared in the medical crime drama &quot;Boxing Helena&quot; (1993), directed by Jennifer Lynch, as Lawrence Augustine.

Garfunkel&#x27;s most recent film is &quot;The Rebound&quot; (2010), directed by Bart Freundlich. He played Harry Finklestein, the slightly senile and comic-relief father of the film&#x27;s main character.

==Voice classification==
Garfunkel is a tenor who usually sang the higher parts in Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#x27;s harmonies. Garfunkel&#x27;s voice changed almost imperceptibly until his late fifties, when it began to lower after years of smoking. He quit smoking around 2010 to aid his recovery from vocal cord paresis.

==Personal life==
Garfunkel married Linda Marie Grossman (b. 1944), an architect, in Nashville on October 1, 1972, and they divorced in 1975. He has claimed that not only did he not love her, he did not even like her much.

He was romantically involved with actress and photographer Laurie Bird from March 1974 until her suicide in 1979.

In late 1985, Garfunkel met former model Kathryn (Kim) Cermak (b. 1958; Czech spelling &quot;Čermák&quot;) while shooting &quot;Good to Go&quot;. They married on September 18, 1988, and have two sons: Arthur Jr, born December 15, 1990, and Beau, born October 5, 2005, via a surrogate mother. Arthur Jr. is also a singer, and released two German-language tribute albums with Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#x27;s greatest hits. Garfunkel and Garfunkel Jr. collaborated on &quot;Father and Son&quot; in 2024; &quot;My dad chose more of the songs from the 1940s,&quot; the younger singer explained,&quot;and I was more of the 1980s selection. The &#x27;Father and Son&#x27; recording was my suggestion, and my father did a great job with it.&quot;

In 2017, Garfunkel stated in his memoir &quot;What Is It All but Luminous: Notes from an Underground Man&quot;, saying &quot;I was an angel singer, a homework nut; an underground man-lover of all beautiful asses, beautiful faces, beautiful bodies, boys and girls.&quot;

Garfunkel senior has undertaken several long walks in his lifetime, writing poetry along the way. In the early 1980s, he walked across Japan in a number of weeks. From 1983 to 1997, Garfunkel walked across the United States, taking 40 excursions to complete the route from New York City to the Pacific coast of Oregon. In May 1998, Garfunkel launched an installment walk across Europe, from a start in Ireland to his final stop in Istanbul in 2015.

Despite being a native New Yorker, Garfunkel is a lifelong Philadelphia Phillies fan, having written on his website: &quot;I never followed the crowd. So as a Queens kid, I didn&#x27;t want to be a Dodger, a Yankee, or Giant fan. One day when I was 8 I went to Ebbets Field and saw the Phillies with their red pinstripes, Robin Roberts, Pudinhead Jones. Somehow this was for me. The rest is loyalty. Decades of pain.&quot;

Garfunkel has been arrested twice for the possession of marijuana: once in early 2004 and again in August 2005.

<text>In chemistry and related fields, the molar volume, symbol &quot;V&quot;m, or formula_1 of a substance is the ratio of the volume (&quot;V&quot;) occupied by a substance to the amount of substance (&quot;n&quot;), usually at a given temperature and pressure. It is also equal to the molar mass (&quot;M&quot;) divided by the mass density (&quot;ρ&quot;):
formula_2

The molar volume has the SI unit of cubic metres per mole (m3/mol), although it is more typical to use the units cubic decimetres per mole (dm3/mol) for gases, and cubic centimetres per mole (cm3/mol) for liquids and solids.

== Definition ==

The molar volume of a substance &quot;i&quot; is defined as its molar mass divided by its density &quot;ρ&quot;&quot;i&quot;0:
formula_3
For an ideal mixture containing &quot;N&quot; components, the molar volume of the mixture is the weighted sum of the molar volumes of its individual components. For a real mixture the molar volume cannot be calculated without knowing the density:
formula_4
There are many liquid–liquid mixtures, for instance mixing pure ethanol and pure water, which may experience contraction or expansion upon mixing. This effect is represented by the quantity excess volume of the mixture, an example of excess property.

=== Relation to specific volume ===
Molar volume is related to specific volume by the product with molar mass. This follows from above where the specific volume is the reciprocal of the density of a substance:
formula_5

== Ideal gases ==
For ideal gases, the molar volume is given by the ideal gas equation; this is a good approximation for many common gases at standard temperature and pressure.
The ideal gas equation can be rearranged to give an expression for the molar volume of an ideal gas:
formula_6
Hence, for a given temperature and pressure, the molar volume is the same for all ideal gases and is based on the gas constant: &quot;R&quot; = , or about .

The molar volume of an ideal gas at 100 kPa (1 bar) is
: at 0 °C,
: at 25 °C.
The molar volume of an ideal gas at 1 atmosphere of pressure is
: at 0 °C,
: at 25 °C.

== Crystalline solids ==
For crystalline solids, the molar volume can be measured by X-ray crystallography.
The unit cell volume (&quot;V&quot;cell) may be calculated from the unit cell parameters, whose determination is the first step in an X-ray crystallography experiment (the calculation is performed automatically by the structure determination software). This is related to the molar volume by
formula_7
where &quot;N&quot;A is the Avogadro constant and &quot;Z&quot; is the number of formula units in the unit cell. The result is normally reported as the &quot;crystallographic density&quot;.

=== Molar volume of silicon ===

Ultra-pure silicon is routinely made for the electronics industry, and the measurement of the molar volume of silicon, both by X-ray crystallography and by the ratio of molar mass to mass density, has attracted much attention since the pioneering work at NIST in 1974. The interest stems from that accurate measurements of the unit cell volume, atomic weight and mass density of a pure crystalline solid provide a direct determination of the Avogadro constant.

The CODATA recommended value for the molar volume of silicon is , with a relative standard uncertainty of

<doc id="70994" wikidata="Q208319" url="?curid=70994" title="Hydra (island)">
<text>Hydra, or Ydra or Idra (; , , Arvanitika: Nύδρα/Nidhra), and in antiquity Hydrea, is one of the Saronic Islands of Greece, located in the Aegean Sea between the Myrtoan Sea and the Argolic Gulf. It is separated from the Peloponnese by a narrow strip of water. In ancient times, the island was known as Hydrea (Ὑδρέα, derived from the Greek word for &quot;water&quot;), a reference to the natural springs on the island.

The municipality of Hydra consists of the islands Hydra (area ), Dokos (area ), and a few uninhabited islets, with a total area of . The province of Hydra () was one of the provinces of the Argolis and Corinthia Prefecture from 1833 to 1942, Attica prefecture from 1942 to 1964, Piraeus prefecture from 1964 to 1972 and then back to Attica as part of the newly establishment Piraeus prefecture of Attica prefecture. Its territory corresponded with that of the current municipality. It was abolished in 2006. Today the municipality of Hydra is part of Islands regional unit of Attica region.

There is one main town, known simply as &quot;Hydra port&quot; (pop. 1,900 in 2011). It consists of a crescent-shaped harbor, around which is centered a strand of restaurants, shops, markets, and galleries that cater to tourists and locals (Hydriots). Steep stone streets lead up and outward from the harbor area. Most of the local residences, as well as the hostelries on the island, are located on these streets. Other small villages or hamlets on the island include Mandraki, Kamini, Vlychos, Palamidas, Episkopi, and Molos. Wheeled vehicles are not permitted in the island, including but not limited to cars, motorcycles, scooters, bicycles, and e-bikes.

== Name ==
The name Hydra comes from ancient Greek (hydra), derived from the Greek word for &quot;water&quot;, a reference to the natural springs on the island.
The local Arvanite name is attested in two variants: the common variant &quot;Nύδρα/Nidhra&quot; and the rare form &quot;Nidhriza&quot; or &quot;Hydriza&quot;.

== Transport, tourism and leisure ==

Hydra depends on tourism, and Athenians account for a sizable segment of its visitors. High-speed hydrofoils and catamarans from Piraeus, some away, serve Hydra, stopping first at Poros before going on to Spetses. There is a passenger ferry service providing an alternative to hydrofoils that operates between Hydra Harbour to Metochi on the Peloponnese coast. Many Athenians drive to Metochi, leave their car in the secure car park, and take the 20-minute passenger ferry across to Hydra.

Rubbish trucks are the only motor vehicles on the island, since by law, cars and motorcycles are not allowed. Horses, mules and donkeys, and water taxis provide public transportation. The inhabited area, however, is so compact that most people walk everywhere.

In 2007, a &quot;National Geographic Traveler&quot; panel of 522 experts rated Hydra the highest of any Greek island (11th out of 111 islands worldwide), as a unique destination preserving its &quot;integrity of place&quot;.

=== Captains&#x27; mansions ===
The Tsamadou mansion, on the left side as one enters the harbour, is now a Maritime Academy. The Tsamados family donated the mansion for the purpose of hosting the Greek Maritime Academy on their island. Another house, originally built for the Tsamados family on the hill overlooking the port was donated to the church to be used as a weaving school and production facility of textiles and carpets. The house now belongs to the Colloredo-Mansfeld family and became known as the Old Carpet Factory.

The Tombazis mansion is now part of the Athens School of Fine Arts, owned by University of Athens.

The mansions of Lazaros and George Kountouriotis, Boudouris, Kriezis, Voulgaris, Sachinis, and Miaoulis all contain collections of 18th-century island furniture. The descendants of Lazarus Kountouriotis donated his mansion to the Historic-Ethnologic Institute of Greece. Today, it operates as an extension branch of the National Museum of History.

=== Monasteries and the Cathedral ===
There are numerous churches and six Orthodox monasteries on the island. Two particularly noteworthy monasteries are Profitis Ilias, founded in the 10th century, and Ayia Efpraxia. Both are on a hill overlooking the main harbour.

The island&#x27;s cathedral is the old Monastery of the Dormition of the Virgin and sits on the quayside in the town. The monastery contains the tomb of Lazaros Kountouriotis, the richest sea captain on Hydra, who gave his entire fortune to support the Greek War of Independence.

== History ==

=== Pre-history, antiquity, Byzantine and Venetian era ===
There is evidence of farmers and herders from the second half of the third millennium BCE on the small, flat areas that are not visible from the sea. Obsidian from Milos has also been found. During the Helladic period, Hydra probably served as a maritime base for the kingdoms on the Greek peninsula. Fragments of vases, tools, and the head of an idol have been found on Mount Chorissa. There is also evidence of Mycenean-era aqueducts, supplying ships with water.

The large-scale Dorian invasion of Greece around the 12th century BCE appears to have depopulated the island. Hydra was repopulated by farmers and herders, perhaps sailing from the mainland port of Ermioni, in the 8th century BCE. Herodotus reports that toward the 6th century BCE, the island belonged to Ermioni, which sold it to Samos. Samos, in turn, ceded it to Troizina.

For much of its existence, Hydra stayed on the margins of history. The population was very small in ancient times and, except for the brief mentions in Herodotus and Pausanias, left little or no record in the history of those times.

It is clear that Hydra was populated during the Byzantine era, as vases and coins have been discovered in the area of Episkopi. However, it appears that the island again lost its population during the Latin Empire of Constantinople as its inhabitants fled the pirate depredations. On other islands, inhabitants moved inland, something that was essentially impossible on Hydra.

==== Arvanite community ====

Among local Arvanites, the first account about their settlement was written by Antonis Miaoulis, son of admiral Andreas Miaoulis, after the end of the Greek war of independence (1830). According to this local narrative, the Arvanite Hydriots descend from the Albanians who directly left Albania as refugees in the 1460s due to persecution by the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II. Historiographical research shows that the Albanians didn&#x27;t settle in Hydra directly from Albania in the 15th century, but from the Peloponnese (Ermionida) due to conflicts in the region with the Venetians and the Ottomans. This first Albanian settlement occurred in the early 16th century and likely involved members of the same 1-2 clans. They created the modern town port and their presence was evident until the mid-20th century, when, according to T. Jochalas, the majority of the island&#x27;s population was composed of immigrants from outside of Peloponnesus. In the 16th century, the island began to be settled also by refugees from the warfare between the Ottomans and Venetians. In the early 18th century, a last Arvanite movement from nearby areas settled in the island. Arvanitika was a language spoken by all Hydriotes. By the 19th century, men had learned to speak Greek too, while women and children often didn&#x27;t speak Greek. One of the reasons why Arvanitika was so enduring in Hydra as opposed to other islands which were part of the Arvanite Aegean settlements was that the language was spoken and favored by the newly emerging Hydriot urban-merchant class. Even in the 20th century families of the local magnates like the Koundouriotis spoke Arvanitika in Hydra. Hydra was also an island where church liturgy was often held in local Arvanitika, which is a rare case as in most Orthodox Albanian communities Greek was the language of liturgy even up to the early 20th century. The Arvanite community is still found on the island. Nowadays they are fully assimilated.

=== Ottoman era: period of commercial and naval strength ===

Hydra was relatively unimportant during much of the period of Ottoman rule. At the end of the sixteenth century, there was a wave of migration consisting of big families from the Hellenic and Asia Minor regions to the island. Due to the infertile ground, the inhabitants turned to the sea. Its naval and commercial development began in the 17th century, and its first school for mariners was established in 1645. Apparently, the first truly Hydriot vessel was launched in 1657. However, the conflict between the Republic of Venice and the Ottoman Empire limited the island&#x27;s maritime development until after 1718 and the Treaty of Passarowitz. From the 17th century on, Hydra began to take on a greater importance because of its trading strength.

During the first half of the 18th century, Hydra built the same kind of vessels as were built in the other Aegean Islands: the &quot;sachtouri&quot; of 15 to 20 tons, and the &quot;latinadiko&quot; of 40 to 50 tons. The Hydriots contented themselves with trading in the Aegean, going as far as Constantinople. A great change occurred in 1757 after they launched a vessel of 250 tons. The larger boats enabled Hydra to become an important commercial port. By 1771, there were up to 50 vessels from throughout Greece in the roads. Ten years later, the island had fitted out 100 vessels.

However, the Ottoman Empire and its policies constrained Hydra&#x27;s economic success. Heavy tariffs and taxes limited the speed of development. The Ottoman administration limited free trade, permitting only Ottoman vessels to navigate the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus, and hence to have access to the Black Sea, its ports, and the trade in grain from their hinterlands. The Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca changed all this. Russia gained from the Ottoman Empire the right to protect the Empire&#x27;s Orthodox Christians. The religious protection had a commercial corollary: the Hydriots began to sail under the Russian flag. The treaty also provided for free passage between the Aegean and the Black Sea. Hydra entered its commercial era. Hydriot vessels carried goods between Southern Russia in the east and the Italian ports of Ancona and Livorno in the west. From 1785 on, the Hydriot shippers began to engage in commerce, not just transport. Each vessel became its own small commercial enterprise, and trade with the Levant quickly began to depend on Hydra&#x27;s vessels, though not without competition from those of Spetses and Psara.

The plague of 1792 killed a large part of the population, and many people moved away. As a result, the town was almost completely abandoned for a while. By the end of the 18th century, Hydra had again become quite prosperous, with its vessels trading as far as France, Spain, and even the Americas. Napoleon presented the island with the huge silver chandelier in the cathedral as a gesture of gratitude for the Hydriots&#x27; role in running the British blockade and so bringing food to France.

=== Greek War of Independence ===

In the 19th century, Hydra was home to some 125 boats and 10,000 sailors. The mansions of the sea captains that ring the harbor are a testament to the prosperity that shipping brought to the island, which, at the time of the Greek Revolution, had 16,000 inhabitants.

To begin with, Hydriots were far from unanimous in joining the Greek War of Independence. In April 1821, when Antonis Oikonomou expelled the governor, the Ottoman Nikolao Kokovila and proclaimed Hydra&#x27;s adherence to the independence struggle, he met strong opposition from island leaders who were reluctant to lose the relatively privileged position they had under Ottoman rule. Oikonomou was imprisoned, hounded off the island and eventually his opponents sent assassins to chase and kill him in December 1821.

Still, Hydra eventually did join the cause of independence, and Hydra&#x27;s contribution of some 150 ships, plus supplies, to fight against the Turks played a critical role. The Greek admiral Andreas Miaoulis, himself a settler on Hydra, used Hydriot fire ships to inflict heavy losses on the Ottoman fleet. Eventually the fleet of Hydra – along with those of the other two naval islands of Psara and Spetses – were able to wrest control of the eastern Aegean Sea from the Ottoman Empire.

The Albanian-speaking seamen of Hydra and Spetses provided the core of the Greek fleet and leading members of the Greek government, among them a one wartime president. They in some cases used Albanian with each other to prevent others on their side from reading their correspondence.

=== Modern history ===
With the end of the revolution and the creation of the Greek state, the island gradually lost its maritime position in the Eastern Mediterranean, igniting an economic crisis that led to a period of hardship and unemployment. The main reason was that with the creation of the Greek state, Hydra&#x27;s fleet lost the privileges that the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca and the use of the Russian flag had given it. Another reason was that the traditional families who owned the majority of the fleet failed to foresee the benefits of participating in the steam ship revolution, which significantly cut shipping operational costs through reduced crew and independence of the winds, putting them at a disadvantage vis-á-vis the new shipping companies of Piraeus, Patras, and Syros. A third reason was that the new conditions made illegal activities such as piracy impossible. Once again, many inhabitants abandoned Hydra, leaving behind their large mansions and beautiful residences, which fell into ruin. The mainstay of the island&#x27;s economy became fishing for sponge. This brought prosperity again until 1932, when Egypt forbade fishing along its coast.

Between 1941 and 1943, during the Axis occupation of Greece during World War II, there was famine on Hydra. It is estimated that some eight per cent of the population died of starvation. By the end of the World War II, the Hydriots were again leaving the island; many of them went abroad.

On 21 June 2024, the only pine forest on the island was burned. The fire was caused by fireworks launched from a yacht. The Greek authorities arrested thirteen people in relation to the incident, all of whom were crew members of the yacht.

== Historical population ==
== Topography and ecology ==

The dominant geographic features of Hydra are its rocky hillsides, which are bare, pine-forested valleys with the occasional farmhouse. The island was subject to a modern geologic study by Renz in 1955. Some of the later Permian limestone strata are rich in well-preserved fossils.

There are many types of wildflowers, including rare &quot;spentzes&quot; or cyclamen and poppies. As well as pine trees, there are cypress and olive trees. Birds species include partridges, quails, and many migratory birds, which are subject to local hunting. Mammals include rabbits, feral cats, and goats.

Although the island&#x27;s name is derived from ancient springs known to the Ancient Greeks, it is now almost dry. Hydra previously had wells, and three new wells have been found. Today, the island imports its water by boat from the Greek mainland. A new desalinization plant was opened in 2014. Many local people store winter rainfall in cisterns beneath their houses to use later as drinking water.

A fire during the 2007 European heat wave destroyed much of the pine forest to the east of Hydra Port. However, the fire left some forest untouched above Kamini and at the west end of Hydra. The forest around Molos, Bisti, and Agios Nikolaos was also unaffected.

== Climate ==
Hydra island has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;BSh&quot;) with an average annual temperature of around 20.4 °C and an average annual precipitation of around 390 mm. Hydra falls in 11a hardiness zone.

== Municipality of Hydra ==
The municipality of Hydra includes the following islands:

The total area of the municipality is , and its population is 2,070 (2021), most in Hydra town.

== Cultural life ==
The Miaoulia Festival provides a series of cultural events in the last week in June and commemorates the victory of naval battles led by Admiral Miaouli during the Greek War of Independence. The festival culminates with a fictionalised re-enactment at sea of the burning of an Ottoman armada followed by a spectacular firework display.

Hydrama Theatre and Arts Centre showcases free theatre and dance productions during the Hydra Performing Arts Festival every summer. Hydrama has hosted drama and dance activities for the local community and international visitors since 2001.

In June 2009, the art collector Dakis Joannou opened the Hydra branch of a private art museum, the Deste Foundation, to show the work of established young artists.

In the 1950s and 1960s Hydra was the adopted home of a community of expatriate artists that included celebrated Norwegian novelist Axel Jensen, Australian writers Charmian Clift and George Johnston, and Canadian singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen. Cohen wrote several of his better-known songs on Hydra, including &quot;Bird on the Wire&quot; and &quot;So Long, Marianne&quot;, while living with Jensen&#x27;s ex-wife, Marianne Ihlen. This period was depicted in the 2019 documentary film &quot;Marianne &amp; Leonard: Words of Love&quot;, and Polly Samson&#x27;s 2020 novel A Theatre for Dreamers.

At Mandraki, Wilhelmina&#x27;s Art Gallery holds contemporary art exhibitions including works by artists such as Toguo and Bea Bonafini.

Near Leonard Cohen&#x27;s house is the Panagiotis Tetsis house which now operates as a museum.
The island used to host an annual conference on Rebetiko, a type of Greek urban folk music, in mid-October.

<text>Rolf Hochhuth (; 1 April 1931 – 13 May 2020) was a German author and playwright, best known for his 1963 drama &quot;The Deputy&quot;, which insinuates Pope Pius XII&#x27;s indifference to Hitler&#x27;s extermination of the Jews, and he remained a controversial figure both for his plays and other public comments and for his 2005 defense of British Holocaust denier David Irving.

==Life and career==
===Youth===
Hochhuth was born in Eschwege, and was descended from a Protestant Hessian middle class family. His father was the owner of a shoe‐factory, which became bankrupt in the Depression. During World War II, he was a member of the Deutsches Jungvolk, a junior subdivision of the Hitler Youth; membership in the group had become legally compulsory in 1939. In 1948 he did an apprenticeship as a bookseller. Between 1950 and 1955 he worked in bookshops in Marburg, Kassel and Munich. At the same time he attended university lectures as a guest student and began with early attempts at writing fiction. Between 1955 and 1963 he was an editor at a major West-German publishing house.

===&quot;The Deputy&quot;===

Hochhuth&#x27;s drama, &quot;The Deputy&quot; (1963), was originally entitled &quot;Der Stellvertreter. Ein christliches Trauerspiel&quot; (&quot;The Deputy, a Christian Tragedy&quot;, translated by Richard and Clara Winston, 1964), the play caused a great deal of controversy because of its criticism of Pope Pius XII&#x27;s role in World War II. The play was subsequently published in the UK in Robert David MacDonald&#x27;s translation as &quot;The Representative&quot; (1965).

Its publisher Ed Keating and journalist Warren Hinckle, who themselves considered it &quot;dramaturgically flawed,&quot; organized a committee to defend the play as a matter of free speech. In 2007, Ion Mihai Pacepa, a former Romanian spymaster, alleged that the play was part of a KGB campaign to discredit Pius XII. A leading German newspaper opined &quot;that Hochhuth did not require any KGB assistance for his one-sided presentation of history.&quot;

The unedited version of the play would have run some eight or nine hours. As a result, each production adapted the text in its own way. No audience saw it in its original form. It includes the true story of Kurt Gerstein. Gerstein, a devout Protestant and later a member of the SS, wrote an eyewitness report about the gas chambers and, after the war, died as a POW.

The play was first performed in Berlin on 20 February 1963 under the direction of Erwin Piscator. It received its first English production in London by the Royal Shakespeare Company at the Aldwych Theatre in 1963 in a translation by Robert David MacDonald. It was directed by Clifford Williams with Alan Webb or Eric Porter as Pius XII, Alec McCowen as Father Fontana and Ian Richardson. In the United Kingdom it has since been revived at the Citizens Theatre, Glasgow, in 1986, and at the Finborough Theatre, London, in 2006.

An abridged version opened on Broadway on 26 February 1964 at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre, with Emlyn Williams as Pius XII and Jeremy Brett as Father Fontana. The play ran for 316 performances.

&quot;The Deputy&quot; was made into a film &quot;Amen&quot; by Costa Gavras in 2002, which focused more on the story of Kurt Gerstein.

===&quot;Soldiers&quot; and Sikorski crash theories===

Hochhuth&#x27;s next play, &quot;Soldiers: An Obituary for Geneva&quot; (1967), claimed that Winston Churchill was responsible for the death of Polish statesman Władysław Sikorski in the 1943 Gibraltar B-24 crash, contradicting the official version of events as an accident; the play implied that Sikorski had been murdered on Churchill&#x27;s orders. Unbeknownst to Hochhuth, the pilot of the B-24, Eduard Prchal, was still alive and won a libel case against Hochhuth that seriously affected the London theater which staged the play.

That aspect of the play has overshadowed Hochhuth&#x27;s conceit that the play would contribute to a debate on the ethics of the area bombardment of German cities by the Royal Air Force (RAF) during World War II, with particular reference to Operation Gomorrah, the Anglo-American air raid on Hamburg in 1943, and culminating in a fictional debate between Winston Churchill and the pacifist George Bell. The play partially drew on the work of English author David Irving, later known as a Holocaust denier. Irving and Hochhuth remained long-standing friends.

Controversy arose in Britain in 1967 when the intended premiere of the play at the National Theatre Company was cancelled due to an intervention from the theatre&#x27;s board, despite the support for the play by literary manager Kenneth Tynan and Laurence Olivier, under pressure from Joan Plowright, his wife. At the time of the controversy, Irving was the only figure who gave his &quot;unequivocal&quot; support for Hochhuth&#x27;s allegations towards Churchill; others consulted by Tynan considered it highly improbable. The play was produced shortly afterwards in the West End with John Colicos in the cast. The English translation was again by Robert David MacDonald. In the UK, the play was seen on tour in the early 1990s and was revived most recently at the Finborough Theatre, London, in 2004.

===&quot;Sommer 14 - A Dance of Death&quot;===
&quot;Sommer 14 - A Dance of Death&quot; had its UK premiere (and world premiere in English) in August 2014 at the Finborough Theatre in London. It was directed by Christopher Loscher for Cerberus Theatre.

===&quot;A Love in Germany&quot; and the Filbinger Affaire===
In 1978, his novel &quot;A Love in Germany&quot; about an affair between a Polish POW and a German woman in World War II stirred up a debate about the past of Hans Filbinger, Minister-President of Baden-Württemberg, who had been a Navy lawyer and judge at the end of World War II. The affair culminated in Filbinger&#x27;s resignation.

For &quot;A Love in Germany&quot;, Hochhuth was awarded the Geschwister-Scholl-Preis in 1980.
In 1983 Andrzej Wajda, who would later win an Honorary Oscar for Lifetime Achievement, made the story into the film &quot;Eine Liebe in Deutschland&quot;.

===&quot;Alan Turing&quot;===

His 1987 drama &quot;Alan Turing&quot; featured one of the fathers of modern computer science, who had made significant contributions to breaking German ciphers during World War II. The play also covered Turing&#x27;s homosexuality, discovery of which resulted in his loss of career, court-ordered chemical castration, depression, and suicide.

===McKinsey controversy===
In 2004, he again caused controversy with the play &quot;McKinsey is Coming&quot;, which raises the questions of unemployment, social justice and the &quot;right to work&quot;. A passage in which he put the chairman of the Deutsche Bank in one line with leading businessmen who had been murdered by left-wing terrorists and also with Gessler, the villainous bailiff killed by William Tell, was widely seen as advocating, or at least excusing, violence against leading economic figures. Hochhuth vigorously denied this.

===Anti-Semitism allegations===
In March 2005, Hochhuth became embroiled in controversy when, during an interview with the German weekly &quot;Junge Freiheit&quot;, he defended Holocaust denier David Irving, describing him as a &quot;pioneer of modern history who has written magnificent books&quot; and an &quot;historian to equal someone like Joachim Fest&quot;. When asked about Irving&#x27;s statement that &quot;more women died on the back seat of Edward Kennedy&#x27;s car at Chappaquiddick than ever died in a gas chamber in Auschwitz&quot;, Hochhuth dismissed it as provocative black humour.

Paul Spiegel, President of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, argued that with these statements Hochhuth himself was denying the Holocaust. After weeks of uproar, Hochhuth issued an apology.

===Casual allegations===
On opening of the archives of the Stasi, the East German Security Service, a report emerged according to which Hochhuth had casually made the allegation that Timothy Garton Ash, at that time working on a history dissertation in East Berlin, was a &quot;British spy&quot;. The book by Garton Ash about how he himself had been surveilled details how such allegations in other cases had major consequences for the involved individuals.

<text>Miletus (; ; &quot;Mīllawānda&quot; or 𒈪𒆷𒉿𒋫 &quot;Milawata&quot; (exonyms); ; ) was an ancient Greek city on the western coast of Anatolia, near the mouth of the Maeander River in ancient Ionia. Its ruins are located near the modern village of Balat in Aydın Province, Turkey. Before the Persian rule that started in the 6th century BC, Miletus was considered among the greatest and wealthiest of Greek cities.

Evidence of the first settlement at the site has been made inaccessible by the rise of sea level and deposition of sediments from the Maeander. The first available evidence is of the Neolithic. In the early and middle Bronze Age the settlement came under Minoan influence. Recorded history at Miletus begins with the records of the Hittite Empire, and the Mycenaean records of Pylos and Knossos, in the Late Bronze Age. Miletus was a Mycenaean stronghold on the coast of Asia Minor from to 1100 BC.

The 13th century BC saw the arrival of Luwian language speakers from south central Anatolia calling themselves the Carians. Later in that century other Greeks arrived. The city at that time rebelled against the Hittite Empire. After the fall of that empire the city was destroyed in the 12th century BC and starting about 1000 BC was resettled extensively by the Ionian Greeks. Legend offers an Ionian foundation event sponsored by a founder named Neleus from the Peloponnesus.

The Greek Dark Ages were a time of Ionian settlement and consolidation in an alliance called the Ionian League. The Archaic Period of Greece began with a sudden and brilliant flash of art and philosophy on the coast of Anatolia. In the 6th century BC, Miletus was the site of origin of the Greek philosophical (and scientific) tradition, when Thales, followed by Anaximander and Anaximenes (known collectively, to modern scholars, as the Milesian school), began to speculate about the material constitution of the world, and to propose speculative naturalistic (as opposed to traditional, supernatural) explanations for various natural phenomena.

== History ==
=== Neolithic ===
The earliest available archaeological evidence indicates that the islands on which Miletus was originally placed were inhabited by a Neolithic population in 3500–3000 BC. Pollen in core samples from Lake Bafa in the Latmus region inland of Miletus suggests that a lightly grazed climax forest prevailed in the Maeander valley, otherwise untenanted. Sparse Neolithic settlements were made at springs, numerous and sometimes geothermal in this karst, rift valley topography. The islands offshore were settled perhaps for their strategic significance at the mouth of the Maeander, a route inland protected by escarpments. The graziers in the valley may have belonged to them, but the location looked to the sea.

=== Middle Bronze Age ===
The prehistoric archaeology of the Early and Middle Bronze Age portrays a city heavily influenced by society and events elsewhere in the Aegean, rather than inland.

====Minoan period====
The earliest Minoan settlement of Miletus dates to 2000 BC. Beginning at about 1900 BC artifacts of the Minoan civilization acquired by trade arrived at the site. For some centuries the location received a strong impulse from that civilization, an archaeological fact that tends to support but not necessarily confirm the founding legend—that is, a population influx from Crete. According to Strabo:Ephorus says: Miletus was first founded and fortified above the sea by Cretans, where the Miletus of olden times is now situated, being settled by Sarpedon, who brought colonists from the Cretan Miletus and named the city after that Miletus, the place formerly being in possession of the Leleges.The legends recounted as history by the ancient historians and geographers are perhaps the strongest; the late mythographers have nothing historically significant to relate.
=== Late Bronze Age ===

Recorded history at Miletus begins with the records of the Hittite Empire and the Mycenaean records of Pylos and Knossos, in the Late Bronze Age.

====Mycenaean period====
Miletus was a Mycenaean stronghold on the coast of Asia Minor from to 1100 BC. In , the city supported an anti-Hittite rebellion of Uhha-Ziti of nearby Arzawa. Muršili ordered his generals Mala-Ziti and Gulla to raid Millawanda, and they proceeded to burn parts of it; damage from LHIIIA found on-site has been associated with this raid. In addition the town was fortified according to a Hittite plan.

Miletus is then mentioned in the &quot;Tawagalawa letter&quot;, part of a series including the Manapa-Tarhunta letter and the Milawata letter, all of which are less securely dated. The Tawagalawa letter notes that Milawata had a governor, Atpa, who was under the jurisdiction of &quot;Ahhiyawa&quot; (a growing state probably in LHIIIB Mycenaean Greece); and that the town of Atriya was under Milesian jurisdiction. The Manapa-Tarhunta letter also mentions Atpa. Together the two letters tell that the adventurer Piyama-Radu had humiliated Manapa-Tarhunta before Atpa (in addition to other misadventures); a Hittite king then chased Piyama-Radu into Millawanda and, in the Tawagalawa letter, requested Piyama-Radu&#x27;s extradition to Hatti.

The Milawata letter mentions a joint expedition by the Hittite king and a Luwian vassal (probably Kupanta-Kurunta of Mira) against Miletus, and notes that the city (together with Atriya) was now under Hittite control.

Homer mentions that during the time of the Trojan War, Miletus was an ally of Troy and was city of the Carians, under Nastes and Amphimachus.

In the last stage of LHIIIB, the citadel of Bronze Age Pylos counted among its female slaves a &quot; mi-ra-ti-ja&quot;, Mycenaean Greek for &quot;women from Miletus&quot;, written in Linear B syllabic script.

====Fall of Miletus====

During the collapse of Bronze Age civilization, Miletus was burnt again, presumably by the Sea Peoples.

===Dark Age===
Mythographers told that Neleus, a son of Codrus the last King of Athens, had come to Miletus after the &quot;Return of the Heraclids&quot; (so, during the Greek Dark Ages). The Ionians killed the men of Miletus and married their Carian widows. This is the mythical commencement of the enduring alliance between Athens and Miletus, which played an important role in the subsequent Persian Wars.

===Archaic period===

The city of Miletus became one of the twelve Ionian city-states of Asia Minor to form the Ionian League.

Miletus was one of the cities involved in the Lelantine War of the 8th century BC.

====Ties with Megara====

Miletus is known to have early ties with Megara in Greece. According to some scholars, these two cities had built up a &quot;colonisation alliance&quot;. In the 7th/6th century BC they acted in accordance with each other.

Both cities acted under the leadership and sanction of an Apollo oracle. Megara cooperated with that of Delphi. Miletus had her own oracle of Apollo &quot;Didymeus Milesios&quot; in Didyma. Also, there are many parallels in the political organisation of both cities.
According to Pausanias, the Megarians said that their town owed its origin to Car, the son of Phoroneus, who built the city citadel called &#x27;Caria&#x27;. This &#x27;Car of Megara&#x27; may or may not be one and the same as the &#x27;Car of the Carians&#x27;, also known as Car (King of Caria).

In the late 7th century BC, the tyrant Thrasybulus preserved the independence of Miletus during a 12-year war fought against the Lydian Empire. Thrasybulus was an ally of the famous Corinthian tyrant Periander.

Miletus was an important center of philosophy and science, producing such men as Thales, Anaximander and Anaximenes. Referring to this period, religious studies professor F. E. Peters described &quot;pan-deism&quot; as &quot;the legacy of the Milesians&quot;.

By the 6th century BC, Miletus had earned a maritime empire with many colonies, but brushed up against powerful Lydia at home, and the tyrant Polycrates of its neighbor to the west, Samos.

===First Achaemenid period===
When Cyrus of Persia defeated Croesus of Lydia in the middle of the 6th century BC, Miletus fell under Persian rule. In 499 BC, Miletus&#x27;s tyrant Aristagoras became the leader of the Ionian Revolt against the Persians, who, under Darius the Great, quashed this rebellion and punished Miletus by selling all of the women and children into slavery, killing the men, and expelling all of the young men as eunuchs, thereby assuring that no Miletus citizen would ever be born again. A year afterward, Phrynicus produced the tragedy &quot;The Capture of Miletus&quot; in Athens. The Athenians fined him for reminding them of their loss.

===Classical Greek period===

In 479 BC, the Greeks decisively defeated the Persians on the Greek mainland at the Battle of Plataea, and Miletus was freed from Persian rule. During this time several other cities were formed by Milesian settlers, spanning across what is now Turkey and even as far as Crimea. The city&#x27;s gridlike layout became famous, serving as the basic layout for Roman cities.

===Second Achaemenid period===

In 387 BC, the Peace of Antalcidas gave the Persian Achaemenid Empire under king Artaxerxes II control of the Greek city-states of Ionia, including Miletus.

In 358 BC, Artaxerxes II died and was succeeded by his son Artaxerxes III, who, in 355 BC, forced Athens to conclude a peace, which required its forces to leave Asia Minor (Anatolia) and acknowledge the independence of its rebellious allies.

===Macedonian period===

In 334 BC, the Siege of Miletus by the forces of Alexander the Great of Macedonia conquered the city. The conquest of most of the rest of Asia Minor soon followed. In this period, the city reached its greatest extent, occupying within its walls an area of approximately .

When Alexander died in 323 BC, Miletus came under the control of Ptolemy, governor of Caria, and his satrap of Lydia, Asander, who had become autonomous. In 312 BC, Macedonian general Antigonus I Monophthalmus sent Docimus and Medeius to free the city and grant autonomy, restoring the democratic patrimonial regime. In 301 BC, after Antigonus I was killed in the Battle of Ipsus by the coalition of Lysimachus, Cassander, and Seleucus I Nicator, founder of the Seleucid Empire, Miletus maintained good relations with all the successors after Seleucus I Nicator made substantial donations to the sanctuary of Didyma and returned the statue of Apollo that had been stolen by the Persians in 494 BC.

In 295 BC, Antigonus I&#x27;s son Demetrius Poliorcetes was the eponymous archon (stephanephorus) in the city, which allied with Ptolemy I Soter of Egypt, while Lysimachus assumed power in the region, enforcing a strict policy towards the Greek cities by imposing high taxes, forcing Miletus to resort to lending.

===Seleucid period===
Around 287/286 BC Demetrius Poliorcetes returned, but failed to maintain his possessions and was imprisoned in Syria. Nicocles of Sidon, the commander of Demetrius&#x27; fleet surrendered the city. Lysimachus dominated until 281 BC, when he was defeated by the Seleucids at the Battle of Corupedium. In 280/279 BC the Milesians adopted a new chronological system based on the Seleucids.
===Egyptian period===

In 279 BC, the city was taken from Seleucid king Antiochus II by Egyptian king Ptolemy II Philadelphus, who donated a large area of land to cement their friendship, and it remained under Egyptian sway until the end of the century.

Aristides of Miletus, founder of the bawdy Miletian school of literature, flourished in the 2nd century BC.

===Roman period===

After an alliance with Rome, in 133 BC the city became part of the province of Asia.

Miletus benefited from Roman rule and most of the present monuments date to this period.

The New Testament mentions Miletus as the site where the Apostle Paul in 57 AD met the elders of the church of Ephesus near the close of his Third Missionary Journey, as recorded in Acts of the Apostles (Acts 20:15–38). It is believed that Paul stopped by the Great Harbour Monument and sat on its steps. He might have met the Ephesian elders there and then bade them farewell on the nearby beach. Miletus is also the city where Paul left Trophimus, one of his travelling companions, to recover from an illness (2 Timothy 4:20). Because this cannot be the same visit as Acts 20 (in which Trophimus accompanied Paul all the way to Jerusalem, according to Acts 21:29), Paul must have made at least one additional visit to Miletus, perhaps as late as 65 or 66 AD. Paul&#x27;s previous successful three-year ministry in nearby Ephesus resulted in the evangelization of the entire province of Asia (see Acts 19:10, 20; 1 Corinthians 16:9). It is safe to assume that at least by the time of the apostle&#x27;s second visit to Miletus, a fledgling Christian community was established in Miletus.

In 262 new city walls were built.

However the harbour was silting up and the economy was in decline. In 538 emperor Justinian rebuilt the walls but it had become a small town.

===Byzantine period===

During the Byzantine age the see of Miletus was raised to an archbishopric and later a metropolitan bishopric. The small Byzantine castle called Palation located on the hill beside the city, was built at this time. Miletus was headed by a curator.

===Turkish rule===

Seljuk Turks conquered the city in the 14th century and used Miletus as a port to trade with Venice.

In the 15th century, the Ottomans utilized the city as a harbour during their rule in Anatolia. As the harbour became silted up, the city was abandoned. Due to ancient and subsequent deforestation, overgrazing (mostly by goat herds), erosion and soil degradation, the ruins of the city lie some from the sea with sediments filling the plain and bare hill ridges without soils and trees, a maquis shrubland remaining.

The Ilyas Bey Complex from 1403 with its mosque is a Europa Nostra awarded cultural heritage site in Miletus.
=== Archaeological excavations ===
The first excavations in Miletus were conducted by the French archaeologist Olivier Rayet in 1873, followed by the German archaeologists Julius Hülsen and Theodor Wiegand between 1899 and 1931.
Excavations, however, were interrupted several times by wars and various other events.
Carl Weickart excavated for a short season in 1938 and again between 1955 and 1957.
He was followed by Gerhard Kleiner and then by Wolfgang Muller-Wiener.
Today, excavations are organized by the Ruhr University of Bochum, Germany.

One remarkable artifact recovered from the city during the first excavations of the 19th century, the Market Gate of Miletus, was transported piece by piece to Germany and reassembled. It is currently exhibited at the Pergamon Museum in Berlin. The main collection of artifacts resides in the &quot;Miletus Museum&quot; in Didim, Aydın, serving since 1973.

Archaeologists discovered a cave under the city&#x27;s theatre and believe that it is a &quot;sacred&quot; cave which belonged to the cult of Asklepius.

=== Examples of the Milesian Vase ===
== Geography ==

The ruins appear on satellite maps at 37°31.8&#x27;N 27°16.7&#x27;E, about 3 km north of Balat and 3 km east of Batıköy in Aydın Province, Turkey.

In antiquity the city possessed a harbor at the southern entry of a large bay, on which two more of the traditional twelve Ionian cities stood: Priene and Myus. The harbor of Miletus was additionally protected by the nearby small island of Lade. Over the centuries the gulf silted up with alluvium carried by the Meander River. Priene and Myus had lost their harbors by the Roman era, and Miletus itself became an inland town in the early Christian era; all three were abandoned to ruin as their economies were strangled by the lack of access to the sea. There is a Great Harbor Monument where, according to the New Testament account, the apostle Paul stopped on his way back to Jerusalem by boat. He met the Ephesian Elders and then headed out to the beach to bid them farewell, recorded in the book of Acts 20:17-38.

=== Geology ===
During the Pleistocene epoch the Miletus region was submerged in the Aegean Sea. It subsequently emerged slowly, the sea reaching a low level of about below present level at about 18,000 BP. The site of Miletus was part of the mainland.

A gradual rise brought a level of about below present at about 5500 BP, creating several karst block islands of limestone, the location of the first settlements at Miletus. At about 1500 BC the karst shifted due to small crustal movements and the islands consolidated into a peninsula. Since then the sea has risen 1.75 m but the peninsula has been surrounded by sediment from the Maeander river and is now land-locked. Sedimentation of the harbor began at about 1000 BC, and by 300 AD Lake Bafa had been created.

Miletus became known for the great number of colonies it founded. It was considered the greatest Greek metropolis and founded more colonies than any other Greek city.

<text>In Norse cosmology, Niðavellir (anglic. as Nidavellir; probable compound of O.N. &quot;Nið&quot; – &quot;new moon&quot;, &quot;the wane of the moon&quot; (perhaps related to &quot;niðr&quot; – &quot;down&quot;) + &quot;Vellir&quot; (pl. of &quot;völlr&quot;) – &quot;fields&quot;: &quot;Dark Fields&quot;, &quot;Downward Fields&quot;), also called Myrkheimr (&quot;Myrkheimr&quot;, O.N. compd. of &quot;myrkr&quot; – &quot;darkness&quot; + &quot;heimr&quot; – &quot;home&quot;: &quot;the world of darkness&quot;, &quot;Dark Abode&quot;), is the home of the Dwarves.

==&quot;Völuspá&quot;==
It is mentioned in the Völuspá:

&quot;Stóð fyr norðan, / á Niðavöllom / salr úr gulli / Sindra ættar&quot;

(Stood to the north, a dark field, Halls of gold, Sindri&#x27;s Clan&quot;).

One interpretation of the above verse would read like this:

Before you reach the north (Niflheim being the world furthest to the north), A dark dwelling stands (The dwarf world), In halls of gold, Sindri&#x27;s bloodline lives.

Sindri was a famous dwarf. And ættar means bloodline, or in this case most likely kin or tribe.

Niðavellir has often been interpreted as one of the Nine Worlds of Norse legend. The problem is that both Niðavellir and Svartalfheim are mentioned, and it is unclear if the sixth world is a world of dwarfs or one of black elves.

The dwarfs&#x27; world is mentioned in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; by Snorri Sturluson as &quot;Svartálfaheimr&quot;.

<text>Ausiàs March (; 1400March 3, 1459) was a medieval Valencian poet and knight from Gandia, Valencia. He is considered one of the most important poets of the &quot;Golden Century&quot; (&quot;Segle d&#x27;or&quot;) of Catalan literature.

==Biography==
Not much is known of March&#x27;s life. He was born in approximately 1400 to a Valencian noble family. His father, Pere March, was himself a poet and served at the court of the younger brother of King Alfonso IV, Peter. His uncle, Jaume March II, was also a poet. March was one of the two children of Pere&#x27;s second wife, Lionor of Ripoll; he had a younger sister, Peirona.

In 1413, the still-young March became head of his family—part of the Valencian petty nobility—upon the death of his father. From a very young age he took part in the expeditions that King Alfons el Magnànim carried out in the Mediterranean. After returning from these expeditions in 1427, he settled in Gandia. After his return, he would never again leave the region where he was born. March was twice married: first to Isabel Martorell (sister of the writer Joanot Martorell), and later to Joana Escorna.

In 1450, he moved from Gandia to Valencia. It was there that he died on March 3, 1459. While March himself was buried in his family&#x27;s chapel at the Valencia Cathedral, his two wives and family are buried in the Monastery of Sant Jeroni de Cotalba. Five illegitimate children but no legitimate heirs have been attributed to him.

==Poetry==

Inheriting an easy fortune from his father, Pere March—the treasurer to the Duke of Gandia—and enjoying the powerful patronage of Charles of Viana, prince of Aragon, March was able to devote himself to poetical composition. He was an undisguised follower of Petrarch, carrying the imitation to such a point that he addressed his &quot;Cants d&#x27;amor&quot; (love songs) to a lady whom he professed to have seen first in church on Good Friday. So far as the difference of language allows, he reproduced the rhythmical cadences of his model, but this should be qualified as the medieval tradition of &quot;locus communis&quot; requested this following. This is something Petrarch himself did and it need not to be stressed. March is a very original and idiosyncratic poet. In the &quot;Cants de mort&quot; (death hymns) he touches a note of brooding sentiment peculiar to himself. It can be said that he developed Petrarch&#x27;s rhetoric and used it for more inner psychological meditations, as other major poets like Camões and Shakespeare would.

March was one of the first poets to use the local vernacular, Valencian, instead of the troubadour language, Occitan. 
His poems are marked by obscurity, a sometimes monotonous morbidity, and a conflicting battle between desire and morality, achieved at its apex in the great &quot;Cant Spiritual&quot;. 
He was fully entitled to the supremacy which he enjoyed among his contemporaries, and the success of his innovation no doubt encouraged Boscán to introduce the Italian metres into Castilian.
His verses were transmitted in manuscript tradition until its first print edition in Valencian in 1543, but they had already become known through the Spanish translation in 1539.

March&#x27;s poetry has been set to music by Raimon, Joan Brudieu and other composers.

<doc id="71015" wikidata="Q1778831" url="?curid=71015" title="Gladstone, Oregon">
<text>Gladstone is a city located in Clackamas County, Oregon, United States. The population was 12,017 at the 2020 United States census. Gladstone is an approximately suburban community, Located south of Portland at the confluence of the Clackamas and Willamette rivers.

Gladstone has held several important cultural and social events, hosting both the inaugural Clackamas County Fair and the Oregon State Fair, before both were moved to more spacious locations. 
Both Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan and presidential candidate Theodore Roosevelt gave public speeches in the city.

==History==

===Clackamas Indians===
Prior to European settlement, there were several Native American groups living in the area that was to become Gladstone.

In 1804, President Thomas Jefferson commissioned the Lewis and Clark Expedition to explore the Louisiana Territory and beyond. Although the expedition passed only near the Gladstone – Oregon City locality on their way to and from the Pacific Ocean, via the Columbia River, natives such as the Kalapuya and the Clackamas people told them about the area.

In the subsequent years, successive waves of explorers and traders would introduce epidemics of cholera and smallpox, which would take a heavy toll on the native peoples and contributed to a substantial reduction in population.

As Oregon City was founded and European settlers began moving to the area, they petitioned their governments to remove the local natives from the land, so that the settlers could use it for farming and housing. The government allocated a reservation for the natives and re-appropriated Gladstone for redevelopment.

 , the only extant remnant of the bygone natives is a large maple tree called the &quot;Pow Wow Tree&quot;, which is listed as an Oregon Heritage Tree. The tree still stands at Clackamas Boulevard, and is said to have marked the place where the different native tribes, mainly Clackamas and Multnomahs, met to make trading agreements, settle community affairs, and conduct wedding ceremonies. In 1860, the Pow-Wow Tree was the location set for the first Clackamas County Fair. The following year, it was used as a parade ring for the first Oregon State Fair and marked the entrance. In 1937, the tree itself was celebrated with the Gladstone Pow-Wow Festival.

===Early homesteaders===
The earliest homesteads in the area were recipients of the Donation Land Claim Act. The Cason and the Rinearson families were the first settlers to receive their donation land claims in Gladstone. Peter M. Rinearson and his family owned the land between Jennings Lodge and the Clackamas River, and between the Willamette River and Portland Avenue. Fendal Cason, who came to Oregon in 1843 and would go on to serve on in the Oregon Territorial Legislature, owned an area of equal size east of Portland Avenue.

===Unsuccessful early townships===
Before Gladstone was formally founded, several small settlements were established in its vicinity. However, due to various natural disasters, such as fires and floods, few survived to become incorporated cities of today.

One such community was Linn City (originally named &quot;Robin&#x27;s Nest&quot;). Settled in 1843 by Robert Moore, Robert himself built four flour and lumber mills along the banks of the Willamette. Warehouses, homes, and mills were steadily added until 1861, when a fire destroyed several of the buildings. Efforts at rebuilding the small town entirely ceased when the Great Flood of 1862 struck, wiping out the remaining buildings.

Another such ill-fated settlement was Canemah, located near the Willamette Falls. Canemah prospered until 1861, when the same great flood swept most of the town over the falls. Even after reconstruction, much of the town&#x27;s importance to river commerce ended in 1873 with completion of the Willamette Falls Locks. Ships no longer needed to dock and unload goods and passengers for portage around the falls. The remaining town officially survived until 1929, when it was annexed to Oregon City.

===Founding===

Gladstone was founded by Judge Harvey Cross in 1889, and formally incorporated on January 10, 1911. It was named after the UK Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone.
Judge Cross laid out the city&#x27;s first streets. Cross&#x27; home was built in the late 1840s by Fendal Cason, and Cross purchased it in 1862. The Cason-Cross House later became Cochran Mortuary. Currently, Mr. Rooter, a plumbing service, occupies the space. There is also a small park named after Cross, located at the same place one of the Indian tribes made its camp.

===Chautauqua movement===
In 1894, the Chautauqua movement made its way to Gladstone. Judge Cross established a fifty-year lease of Gladstone Park for this event after he was convinced by Oregon City author Eva Emery Dye that doing so would be a boon to the city and its people. Beginning on July 24–26, 1894, the newly formed Willamette Valley Chautauqua Association held an annual summer assembly that offered performances, lectures, and concerts. This event would recur annually, until Gladstone&#x27;s Chautauqua Park grew to be the third-largest permanent Chautauqua assembly park in the United States.

In 1896, William Jennings Bryan drew a crowd of 6,000 to Gladstone&#x27;s then Chautauqua park to hear him give his popular lecture &quot;The Prince of Peace&quot;, which stressed that Christian theology, through both individual and group morality, was a solid foundation for peace and equality.

With the advent of radio, improved transportation and the appearance of traveling vaudeville acts in Portland, attendance at the Chautauqua began to dwindle. In 1927, the Willamette Valley Chautauqua Association went bankrupt. Judge Cross died on August 7, 1927, and shortly thereafter, Gladstone Park, including its buildings and Chautauqua Lake, were sold to the Western Oregon Conference of Seventh-day Adventists.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an official area of .

===Adjacent communities===
The city of Gladstone is immediately bordered by the following communities, listed in descending order of population:

*Oregon City, the county seat of Clackamas County, sits to the south, almost entirely separated by the Clackamas River
*West Linn, to the west, is delineated by the Willamette River.
*Oak Grove, a census-designated place and unincorporated area, abuts Lake Oswego to the west, Milwaukie to the north, and Jennings lodge to the south.
*Jennings Lodge, a census-designated place and unincorporated area, runs between Oak Grove and Gladstone.
*Oatfield, a census-designated place and unincorporated area similar to Jennings Lodge, exists between Milwaukie, to the north, and Gladstone, to the south.
*Clackamas, to the northeast, an unincorporated area and former census-designated place, resides within greater Clackamas County.
*Johnson City, a very small incorporated city of approximately 500 residents, is northeast of Gladstone. (See also the similar city of Maywood Park, Oregon.) In 1968, the city tried unsuccessfully to annex to Gladstone.

Although the above cities are generally considered part of the much larger Portland metropolitan area, Gladstone, Oregon City, West Linn, and Milwaukie each possess the population and production of a micropolis in their own right and this relatively dense sub-region contains a combined population exceeding 100,000 people.

Despite Gladstone&#x27;s proximity to the city of Milwaukie, at no point do the two share political boundaries.

===Major thoroughfares and street grid===
Being bordered by rivers on two sides, there are only two primary thoroughfares to and from the city. Interstate 205 runs north–south along the eastern edge of the city, while McLoughlin Boulevard (Oregon Route 99E) runs north–south through the western side.

Taken at the suggestion of surveyor Sidney Smyth, Judge Harvey Cross decided to name a number of Gladstone streets after American colleges (e.g., University of California, Berkeley, Cornell University) and a number of United Kingdom dukes, earls, and universities (e.g., University of Exeter, Earl of Dartmouth, Earl of Clarendon). Portland Avenue, Gladstone&#x27;s main street, is the only divergence from this naming convention. Named for the 1893 Interurban Electric Streetcar line that once traversed the street, it once transported passengers between Gladstone and Portland.

===Climate===

==Public services==

===Public safety and quality of life===

Some polling data suggests that Gladstone citizens are satisfied with city services they receive and a large majority consider Gladstone a particularly &quot;good/excellent&quot; place to live. Perhaps reflecting this support, the police, fire, and medical services levy renewal measures were overwhelmingly approved by voters in November 2012.

===Schools===
Gladstone is served by the Gladstone School District, which includes John Wetten Elementary School, Kraxberger Middle School, and Gladstone High School. In 2006, a bond was passed to allow approximately $40 million worth of construction work on the three schools. The majority (approx. $26 million) of the money was applied towards a remodel of the high school. The district later refinanced the bond, saving taxpayers over 5 percent on its total ($805,040), with savings to begin in the 2024 tax year.

===Library===
The county operates a library in Gladstone that is part of the Library Information Network of Clackamas County. In 2012, the city council approved plans for a new $10 million library, but ballot measures backed by the group Save Gladstone blocked the financing and construction pending specific voter approval. The city then placed a new measure on the November 2014 ballot for a $6.4 million option. Plans were put on hold when supply shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic increased the cost of materials beyond budget constraints.

===Parks===
Despite its relatively small geographic size, the City of Gladstone recognizes 14 parks and recreational areas. Parks include: Abernethy Lane Trail, Cross Park, Dahl Beach, Dierickx Field, Gladstone Nature Park, Glen Echo Wetland, High Rocks Park, Max Patterson Memorial City Park, Meldrum Bar Park (controversial for being the only city park in the region to impose a day use fee.), Nick Shannon Park, Ridgegate Tracts, Robin Hood Park, Salty Acres Wetlands and Stocker Park.

===Public transit===
Gladstone is within the TriMet transportation district, and transit service in the city is provided by TriMet bus routes 32-Oatfield, 33-McLoughlin/King Road, 34-Linwood/River Road, and 79-Clackamas/Oregon City, as well as the 99-Macadam/McLoughlin rush-hour express route.

==Notable people==
American labor activist Liz Shuler grew up in Gladstone. She went on to become Secretary-Treasurer of the AFL–CIO. She is the first woman and (as of 2009) the youngest person to hold the position of Secretary-Treasurer. Actor Clifton James grew up in the city and died there as well. James had roles in the James Bond films &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; (1973) and &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; (1974), as well as &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot; (1967).

<text>ARA &quot;General Belgrano&quot; (C-4) was an Argentine Navy light cruiser in service from 1951 until 1982. Originally commissioned by the U.S. Navy as , she saw action in the Pacific theatre of World War II before being sold to Argentina. The vessel was the second to have been named after the Argentine founding father Manuel Belgrano (1770–1820). The first vessel was a 7,069-ton armoured cruiser completed in 1896.

She was sunk on 2 May 1982 during the Falklands War by the Royal Navy submarine with the loss of 323 lives. Losses from &quot;General Belgrano&quot; totalled just under half of Argentine military deaths in the war.

She is the only ship to have been sunk during military operations by a nuclear-powered submarine and the second sunk in action by any type of submarine since World War II (the first being the Indian frigate , which was sunk by the Pakistani submarine during the 1971 Indo-Pakistani War).

==Early career==

The warship was built as , the sixth ship of the design, in Camden, New Jersey, by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation starting in 1935, and launched in March 1938. She survived the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 undamaged, and went on to earn nine battle stars for World War II service. At the end of the war, she was placed in reserve at Philadelphia on 28 February 1946, decommissioned on 3 July that year and remained laid up at Philadelphia.

&quot;Phoenix&quot; was sold to Argentina in October 1951 and renamed &quot;17 de Octubre&quot; after the &quot;Loyalty day&quot;, an important symbolic date for the political party of president Juan Perón. Sold with her was another of her class, the , renamed , which was withdrawn in 1977.

&quot;17 de Octubre&quot; was one of the main naval units that joined the 1955 coup which overthrew Perón, and was afterwards renamed &quot;General Belgrano&quot; after Manuel Belgrano, a lawyer who had founded the &quot;Escuela de Náutica&quot; (School of Navigation) in 1799 and with the rank of general fought for Argentine independence from 1811 to 1819. &quot;General Belgrano&quot; accidentally rammed her sister ship &quot;Nueve de Julio&quot; on exercises in 1956, causing damage to both. &quot;General Belgrano&quot; was outfitted with the Sea Cat anti-aircraft missile system between 1967 and 1968.

==Sinking==


On 12 April 1982, following the 1982 invasion of the Falkland Islands, the United Kingdom declared a Maritime Exclusion Zone (MEZ) around the Falkland Islands within which any Argentine warship or naval auxiliary entering the MEZ might be attacked by British forces. On 23 April, the British Government clarified in a message that was passed via the Swiss Embassy in Buenos Aires to the Argentine government that any Argentine ship or aircraft that was considered to pose a threat to British forces would be attacked.

On 30 April this was upgraded to the total exclusion zone, within which any sea vessel or aircraft from any country entering the zone might be fired upon without further warning. The zone was stated to be &quot;...without prejudice to the right of the United Kingdom to take whatever additional measures may be needed in exercise of its right of self-defence, under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter.&quot; The concept of a total exclusion zone was a novelty in maritime law; the Law of the Sea Convention had no provision for such an instrument. Its purpose seems to have been to increase the time available to ascertain whether any vessel in the zone was hostile or not. Regardless of the uncertainty of the zone&#x27;s legal status, it was widely respected by the shipping of neutral nations.

The Argentine military junta began to reinforce the islands in late April when it was realised that the British Task Force was heading south. As part of these movements, Argentine naval units were ordered to take positions around the islands. Two Task Groups designated 79.1, which included the aircraft carrier plus two Type 42 destroyers, and 79.2, which included three Exocet missile-armed s, sailed to the north. &quot;General Belgrano&quot; had left Ushuaia in Tierra del Fuego on 26 April. Two destroyers, ARA &quot;Piedra Buena&quot; and ARA &quot;Hipólito Bouchard&quot; (also ex-USN vessels) were detached from Task Group 79.2 and together with the tanker YPF &quot;Puerto Rosales&quot;, joined &quot;General Belgrano&quot; to form Task Group 79.3.

By 29 April, the ships were patrolling the Burdwood Bank, south of the islands. On 30 April, &quot;General Belgrano&quot; was detected by the British nuclear-powered hunter-killer submarine . The submarine approached over the following day. On 1 May 1982, Admiral Juan Lombardo ordered all Argentine naval units to seek out the British task force around the Falklands and launch a &quot;massive attack&quot; the following day. &quot;General Belgrano&quot;, which was outside and to the south-west of the exclusion zone, was ordered south-east.

Lombardo&#x27;s signal was intercepted by British Intelligence. As a result, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her War Cabinet, meeting at Chequers the following day, agreed to a request from Admiral Terence Lewin, the Chief of the Defence Staff, to alter the rules of engagement and allow an attack on &quot;General Belgrano&quot; outside the exclusion zone. Although the group was outside the British-declared total exclusion zone of 370 km (200 nautical miles) radius from the islands, the British decided that it was a threat. After consultation at Cabinet level, Thatcher agreed that Commander Chris Wreford-Brown should attack &quot;General Belgrano&quot;.

At 14:57 (Falkland Islands Time) on 2 May, &quot;Conqueror&quot; fired three 21-inch Mk 8 mod 4 torpedoes (conventional, non-guided, torpedoes in service from 1927), each with an 805-pound (363 kg) Torpex warhead. While &quot;Conqueror&quot; was also equipped with the newer Mark 24 Tigerfish homing torpedo, there were doubts about its reliability. Initial reports from Argentina claimed that &quot;Conqueror&quot; fired two Tigerfish torpedoes on &quot;General Belgrano&quot;. Two of the three torpedoes hit &quot;General Belgrano&quot;. According to the Argentine government, &quot;General Belgrano&quot; position was .

One of the torpedoes struck aft of the bow, outside the area protected by either the ship&#x27;s side armour or the internal anti-torpedo bulge. This blew off the ship&#x27;s bow, but the internal torpedo bulkheads held and the forward powder magazine for the 40 mm gun did not detonate. It is believed that none of the ship&#x27;s company were in that part of the ship at the time of the explosion.

The second torpedo struck about three-quarters of the way along the ship, just outside the rear limit of the side armour plating. The torpedo punched through the side of the ship before exploding in the aft machine room. The explosion tore upward through two messes and a relaxation area called &quot;the Soda Fountain&quot; before finally ripping a hole in the main deck. Later reports put the number of deaths in the area around the explosion at 275 men. After the explosion, the ship rapidly filled with smoke. The explosion also damaged &quot;General Belgrano&quot; electrical power system, preventing her from putting out a radio distress call. Though the forward bulkheads held, water was rushing in through the hole created by the second torpedo and could not be pumped out because of the electrical power failure. In addition, although the ship should have been &quot;at action stations&quot;, she was sailing with the water-tight doors open.

The ship began to list to port and to sink towards the bow. Twenty minutes after the attack, at 16:24, Captain Bonzo ordered the crew to abandon ship. Inflatable life rafts were deployed, and the evacuation began without panic.
The two escort ships were unaware of what was happening to &quot;General Belgrano&quot;, as they were out of touch with her in the gloom and had not seen the distress rockets or lamp signals. Adding to the confusion, the crew of &quot;Bouchard&quot; felt an impact that was possibly the third torpedo striking at the end of its run (an examination of the ship later showed an impact mark consistent with a torpedo). The two ships continued on their course westward. By the time the ships realised that something had happened to &quot;General Belgrano&quot;, it was already dark and the weather had worsened, scattering the life rafts.

Argentine and Chilean ships rescued 772 men from 3 to 5 May. In total, 323 were killed in the attack: 321 members of the crew and two civilians who were on board at the time.

===Naval outcome===
Following the loss of &quot;General Belgrano&quot;, the Argentine fleet returned to its bases and played no major role in the rest of the conflict. British nuclear submarines continued to operate in the sea areas between Argentina and the Falkland Islands, gathering intelligence, providing early warning of air raids and effectively imposing sea denial. With the withdrawal of the aircraft carrier, all Argentine aircraft had to operate from land bases at the limit of their range. The minimal role of the Navy in the rest of the campaign led to a considerable loss of credibility and influence within the Junta.

==Controversy over the sinking==
The legality of the sinking of &quot;General Belgrano&quot; has been disputed due to disagreement on the exact nature of the Maritime Exclusion Zone (MEZ) and whether &quot;General Belgrano&quot; had been returning to port at the time of the sinking. Through a message passed via the Swiss Embassy in Buenos Aires to the Argentine government nine days before the sinking, the UK made clear that it no longer considered the 200 mile exclusion zone as the limit of its military action. On 1 May 1982, Admiral Juan Lombardo ordered all Argentine naval units to seek out the British task force around the Falklands and launch a &quot;massive attack&quot; the following day.

In 2003, the ship&#x27;s captain Hector Bonzo confirmed that &quot;General Belgrano&quot; had actually been manoeuvering, not &quot;sailing away&quot; from the exclusion zone. Captain Bonzo stated that any suggestion that HMS &quot;Conqueror&quot; actions were a &quot;betrayal&quot; was utterly wrong; rather, the submarine carried out its duties according to the accepted rules of war. In an interview two years before his death in 2009, he further stated that: &quot;It was absolutely not a war crime. It was an act of war, lamentably legal.&quot;

The sinking became a &quot;cause célèbre&quot; for British anti-war campaigners such as Labour MP Tam Dalyell. Early reports suggested that more than 1,000 Argentine sailors might have been killed in the sinking; it was around a third of that number.

The sinking occurred 14 hours after President of Peru Fernando Belaúnde proposed a comprehensive peace plan and called for regional unity, although Margaret Thatcher and diplomats in London did not see this document until after the sinking of &quot;General Belgrano&quot;. Diplomatic efforts to that point had failed completely. After the sinking, Argentina rejected the plan but the UK indicated its acceptance on 5 May. The news was subsequently dominated by military action and the British continued to offer ceasefire terms until 1 June that were rejected by the Junta.

===Argentine response===

On 3 May 1982, Argentina&#x27;s Chancellery released a statement in the name of the Argentinian government that read:

===Legal situation===

Neither the United Kingdom nor Argentina declared war during the conflict. Combat was confined to the Falkland Islands and South Georgia and surrounding area. &quot;General Belgrano&quot; was sunk outside the total exclusion zone around the Falklands, delimited by the UK. Through a message passed via the Swiss Embassy in Buenos Aires to the Argentine government on 23 April, the UK had made clear that it no longer considered the 200-mile (370 km) exclusion zone as the limit of its military action. The message read:
Interviews conducted by Martin Middlebrook for his book &quot;Argentine Fight for the Falklands&quot; indicated that Argentine naval officers understood that the intent of the message was to indicate that any ships operating near the exclusion zone could be attacked. Argentine Rear Admiral Allara, who was in charge of the task force of which &quot;General Belgrano&quot; was part, said: &quot;After that message of 23 April, the entire South Atlantic was an operational theatre for both sides. We, as professionals, said it was just too bad that we lost the &quot;Belgrano&quot;&quot;. Captain Bonzo also told Middlebrook that he was not angry about the attack on his ship and that 

Admiral Sandy Woodward, who commanded the British task force during the war, wrote in his 1997 book &quot;One Hundred Days&quot; that HMS &quot;Conqueror&quot; received a signal changing the rules of engagement and that &quot;The change said quite clearly he may now attack the Belgrano, outside the TEZ&quot;.

===Later political controversy===
Some details of the action were leaked to a British Member of Parliament, Tam Dalyell, in 1985 by the senior civil servant Clive Ponting, resulting in the unsuccessful prosecution of the latter under the Official Secrets Act 1911. According to the documents &quot; General Belgrano&quot; was sailing away from the exclusion zone when she was attacked and sunk.

In May 1983, Thatcher appeared on &quot;Nationwide&quot;, a live television programme on BBC1, where a teacher, Diana Gould, questioned her about the sinking, saying that the ship was already west of the Falklands and heading towards the Argentine mainland to the west. Gould also said that the Peruvian peace proposal must have reached London in the 14 hours between its publication and the sinking of &quot;General Belgrano&quot;, and the escalation of the war could have thus been prevented. In the emotional exchange that followed, Thatcher answered that the vessel was a threat to British ships and lives and denied that the peace proposal had reached her. She added that &quot;One day, all of the facts, in about 30 years time, will be published&quot;, apparently a reference to a classified report prepared by intelligence officer Major David Thorp for Thatcher after the incident.

After the programme, Thatcher&#x27;s husband Denis lashed out at its producer in the entertainment suite, saying that his wife had been &quot;stitched up by bloody BBC poofs and Trots&quot;. Thatcher herself commented during the interview: &quot;I think it could only be in Britain that a prime minister was accused of sinking an enemy ship that was a danger to our navy, when my main motive was to protect the boys in our navy.&quot;

According to the British historian Sir Lawrence Freedman, neither Thatcher nor the Cabinet was aware of &quot;General Belgrano&quot; change of course before the cruiser was attacked. In his book &quot;One Hundred Days&quot;, Admiral Woodward claims that &quot;General Belgrano&quot; was part of the southern part of a pincer movement aimed at the task force, and had to be sunk quickly. He wrote:

===&quot;Gotcha&quot; headline===
On 4 May, the British tabloid newspaper &quot;The Sun&quot; ran the controversial headline &quot;Gotcha&quot; in reference to the sinking of &quot;General Belgrano&quot;. Kelvin MacKenzie, the newspaper&#x27;s editor, was reported to have used an impromptu exclamation by &quot;The Sun&quot; features editor, Wendy Henry, as the inspiration for the headline. The accompanying text reported that &quot;General Belgrano&quot; had only been hit and damaged and not sunk, while a &quot;gunboat&quot; (actually the armed tug ARA &quot;Alférez Sobral&quot;) had sunk, when in fact the reverse was the case. After early editions went to press, further reports suggested a major loss of life, and Mackenzie toned down the headline to read &quot;Did 1,200 Argies drown?&quot; in later editions.

Few readers in the UK saw the headline at first hand as it was only used on copies of the first northern editions, while southern editions and later editions in the North carried the toned-down headline, but the &quot;Gotcha&quot; headline was widely publicised.

==Aftermath==

In August 1994, an official Argentine Defence Ministry report written by armed forces auditor Eugenio Miari was released which described the sinking of &quot;General Belgrano&quot; as &quot;a legal act of war&quot;, explaining that &quot;acts of war can be carried out in all of the enemy&#x27;s territory&quot; and &quot;they can also take place in those areas over which no state can claim sovereignty, in international waters&quot;. Argentinian veterans were said to be dismayed at the conclusion about &quot;General Belgrano&quot;, and the President of the Federation of Argentine War Veterans Luis Ibáñez hoped to produce more witnesses to show that the sinking was a war crime.

In 1999 Sir Michael Boyce, First Sea Lord of the Royal Navy, visited the Puerto Belgrano naval base and paid tribute to those who died. In 2003 a search team aboard &quot;Seacor Lenga&quot;, crewed by Argentine and British veterans, was sponsored by National Geographic to find the sunken cruiser but failed to locate it. The area where &quot;General Belgrano&quot; sank, though not found, is classified as a war grave under Argentine Congress law 25.546.

In 2000, lawyers representing the families of the sailors killed onboard &quot;General Belgrano&quot; attempted to sue the British government in the European Court of Human Rights on the grounds that the attack took place outside the exclusion zone. It was an attempt to pressure the Argentine government to lodge an action against the UK in the International Court of Justice, but was ruled inadmissible by the Court of Human Rights on the grounds that it had been submitted too late.

&quot;La Nación&quot; in 2005 published a reader&#x27;s letter from admiral , who had been head of the Argentine Navy in the 1990s, saying that &quot;General Belgrano&quot; was part of an operation that posed a real threat to the British task force, but was holding off for tactical reasons. Molina Pico added that &quot;To leave the exclusion zone was not to leave the combat zone to enter a protected area&quot;. Molina Pico explicitly stated that the sinking was not a war crime, but a combat action.

&quot;General Belgrano&quot;″s captain, Héctor Bonzo, died on 22 April 2009, aged 76. He had spent his last years working for an association called &quot;Amigos del Crucero General Belgrano&quot; (Friends of the Cruiser General Belgrano) whose purpose was to help those affected by the sinking. Bonzo also wrote his memories about the sinking in the book &quot;1093 Tripulantes del Crucero ARA General Belgrano&quot;, published in 1992. In this book he wrote that it is &quot;improper to accept that (...) the attack by HMS &quot;Conqueror&quot; was a betrayal&quot;. During an interview in 2003 he had stated that &quot;General Belgrano&quot; was only temporarily sailing to the west at the time of the attack, and his orders were to attack any British ships that came within range.

In late 2011, major David Thorp, a former British military intelligence officer who led the signals interception team aboard , released the book &quot;The Silent Listener&quot; detailing the role of intelligence in the Falklands War. In the book he said that, although &quot;General Belgrano&quot; was observed by &quot;Conqueror&quot; to be sailing away from the Falklands at the time of the attack, she had actually been ordered to proceed to a rendezvous point within the exclusion zone. A report prepared by Thorp for Thatcher several months after the incident stated the destination of the vessel was not to her home port as the Argentine junta stated; the report was not released because the prime minister did not want to compromise British signals intelligence capabilities.

In 2012 the president of Argentina, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, referred to the sinking of &quot;General Belgrano&quot; as a &quot;war crime&quot;. However, the Argentine Navy has held the view that the sinking was a legitimate act of war, a position that was asserted by the Argentine Navy before various courts in 1995, and by the vessel&#x27;s captain Hector Bonzo in 2003.

<doc id="71020" wikidata="Q898426" url="?curid=71020" title="Ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy">
<text>Ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometry (UV–Vis or UV-VIS) refers to absorption spectroscopy or reflectance spectroscopy in part of the ultraviolet and the full, adjacent visible regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Being relatively inexpensive and easily implemented, this methodology is widely used in diverse applied and fundamental applications. The only requirement is that the sample absorb in the UV-Vis region, i.e. be a chromophore. Absorption spectroscopy is complementary to fluorescence spectroscopy. Parameters of interest, besides the wavelength of measurement, are absorbance (A) or transmittance (%T) or reflectance (%R), and its change with time.

A UV-Vis spectrophotometer is an analytical instrument that measures the amount of ultraviolet (UV) and visible light that is absorbed by a sample. It is a widely used technique in chemistry, biochemistry, and other fields, to identify and quantify compounds in a variety of samples.

UV-Vis spectrophotometers work by passing a beam of light through the sample and measuring the amount of light that is absorbed at each wavelength. The amount of light absorbed is proportional to the concentration of the absorbing compound in the sample.

==Optical transitions==
Most molecules and ions absorb energy in the ultraviolet or visible range, i.e., they are chromophores. The absorbed photon excites an electron in the chromophore to higher energy molecular orbitals, giving rise to an excited state. For organic chromophores, four possible types of transitions are assumed: π–π*, n–π*, σ–σ*, and n–σ*. Transition metal complexes are often colored (i.e., absorb visible light) owing to the presence of multiple electronic states associated with incompletely filled d orbitals.

==Applications==
UV-Vis can be used to monitor structural changes in DNA. 

UV-Vis spectroscopy is routinely used in analytical chemistry for the quantitative determination of diverse analytes or sample, such as transition metal ions, highly conjugated organic compounds, and biological macromolecules. Spectroscopic analysis is commonly carried out in solutions but solids and gases may also be studied.
*Organic compounds, especially those with a high degree of conjugation, also absorb light in the UV or visible regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The solvents for these determinations are often water for water-soluble compounds, or ethanol for organic-soluble compounds. (Organic solvents may have significant UV absorption; not all solvents are suitable for use in UV spectroscopy. Ethanol absorbs very weakly at most wavelengths.) Solvent polarity and pH can affect the absorption spectrum of an organic compound. Tyrosine, for example, increases in absorption maxima and molar extinction coefficient when pH increases from 6 to 13 or when solvent polarity decreases.
*While charge transfer complexes also give rise to colours, the colours are often too intense to be used for quantitative measurement.

The Beer–Lambert law states that the absorbance of a solution is directly proportional to the concentration of the absorbing species in the solution and the path length. Thus, for a fixed path length, UV-Vis spectroscopy can be used to determine the concentration of the absorber in a solution. It is necessary to know how quickly the absorbance changes with concentration. This can be taken from references (tables of molar extinction coefficients), or more accurately, determined from a calibration curve.

A UV-Vis spectrophotometer may be used as a detector for HPLC. The presence of an analyte gives a response assumed to be proportional to the concentration. For accurate results, the instrument&#x27;s response to the analyte in the unknown should be compared with the response to a standard; this is very similar to the use of calibration curves. The response (e.g., peak height) for a particular concentration is known as the response factor.

The wavelengths of absorption peaks can be correlated with the types of bonds in a given molecule and are valuable in determining the functional groups within a molecule. The Woodward–Fieser rules, for instance, are a set of empirical observations used to predict λmax, the wavelength of the most intense UV-Vis absorption, for conjugated organic compounds such as dienes and ketones. The spectrum alone is not, however, a specific test for any given sample. The nature of the solvent, the pH of the solution, temperature, high electrolyte concentrations, and the presence of interfering substances can influence the absorption spectrum. Experimental variations such as the slit width (effective bandwidth) of the spectrophotometer will also alter the spectrum. To apply UV-Vis spectroscopy to analysis, these variables must be controlled or accounted for in order to identify the substances present.

The method is most often used in a quantitative way to determine concentrations of an absorbing species in solution, using the Beer–Lambert law:
:formula_1,

where &quot;A&quot; is the measured absorbance (formally dimensionless but generally reported in absorbance units (AU)), formula_2 is the intensity of the incident light at a given wavelength, formula_3 is the transmitted intensity, &quot;L&quot; the path length through the sample, and &quot;c&quot; the concentration of the absorbing species. For each species and wavelength, ε is a constant known as the molar absorptivity or extinction coefficient. This constant is a fundamental molecular property in a given solvent, at a particular temperature and pressure, and has units of formula_4.

The absorbance and extinction &quot;ε&quot; are sometimes defined in terms of the natural logarithm instead of the base-10 logarithm.

The Beer–Lambert law is useful for characterizing many compounds but does not hold as a universal relationship for the concentration and absorption of all substances. A 2nd order polynomial relationship between absorption and concentration is sometimes encountered for very large, complex molecules such as organic dyes (xylenol orange or neutral red, for example).

UV–Vis spectroscopy is also used in the semiconductor industry to measure the thickness and optical properties of thin films on a wafer. UV–Vis spectrometers are used to measure the reflectance of light, and can be analyzed via the Forouhi–Bloomer dispersion equations to determine the index of refraction (formula_5) and the extinction coefficient (formula_6) of a given film across the measured spectral range.

=== Practical considerations ===
The Beer–Lambert law has implicit assumptions that must be met experimentally for it to apply; otherwise there is a possibility of deviations from the law. For instance, the chemical makeup and physical environment of the sample can alter its extinction coefficient. The chemical and physical conditions of a test sample therefore must match reference measurements for conclusions to be valid. Worldwide, pharmacopoeias such as the American (USP) and European (Ph. Eur.) pharmacopeias demand that spectrophotometers perform according to strict regulatory requirements encompassing factors such as stray light and wavelength accuracy.

====Spectral bandwidth====
Spectral bandwidth of a spectrophotometer is the range of wavelengths that the instrument transmits through a sample at a given time. It is determined by the light source, the monochromator, its physical slit-width and optical dispersion and the detector of the spectrophotometer. The spectral bandwidth affects the resolution and accuracy of the measurement. A narrower spectral bandwidth provides higher resolution and accuracy, but also requires more time and energy to scan the entire spectrum. A wider spectral bandwidth allows for faster and easier scanning, but may result in lower resolution and accuracy, especially for samples with overlapping absorption peaks. Therefore, choosing an appropriate spectral bandwidth is important for obtaining reliable and precise results.

It is important to have a monochromatic source of radiation for the light incident on the sample cell to enhance the linearity of the response. The closer the bandwidth is to be monochromatic (transmitting unit of wavelength) the more linear will be the response. The spectral bandwidth is measured as the number of wavelengths transmitted at half the maximum intensity of the light leaving the monochromator. 

The best spectral bandwidth achievable is a specification of the UV spectrophotometer, and it characterizes how monochromatic the incident light can be. If this bandwidth is comparable to (or more than) the width of the absorption peak of the sample component, then the measured extinction coefficient will not be accurate. In reference measurements, the instrument bandwidth (bandwidth of the incident light) is kept below the width of the spectral peaks. When a test material is being measured, the bandwidth of the incident light should also be sufficiently narrow. Reducing the spectral bandwidth reduces the energy passed to the detector and will, therefore, require a longer measurement time to achieve the same signal to noise ratio.

====Wavelength error====
The extinction coefficient of an analyte in solution changes gradually with wavelength. A peak (a wavelength where the absorbance reaches a maximum) in the absorbance curve vs wavelength, i.e. the UV-VIS spectrum, is where the rate of change of absorbance with wavelength is the lowest. Therefore, quantitative measurements of a solute are usually conducted, using a wavelength around the absorbance peak, to minimize inaccuracies produced by errors in wavelength, due to the change of extinction coefficient with wavelength.

====Stray light====

Stray light in a UV spectrophotometer is any light that reaches its detector that is not of the wavelength selected by the monochromator. This can be caused, for instance, by scattering of light within the instrument, or by reflections from optical surfaces.

Stray light can cause significant errors in absorbance measurements, especially at high absorbances, because the stray light will be added to the signal detected by the detector, even though it is not part of the actually selected wavelength. The result is that the measured and reported absorbance will be lower than the actual absorbance of the sample.

The stray light is an important factor, as it determines the &quot;purity&quot; of the light used for the analysis. The most important factor affecting it is the &quot;stray light&quot; level of the monochromator.

Typically a detector used in a UV-VIS spectrophotometer is broadband; it responds to all the light that reaches it. If a significant amount of the light passed through the sample contains wavelengths that have much lower extinction coefficients than the nominal one, the instrument will report an incorrectly low absorbance. Any instrument will reach a point where an increase in sample concentration will not result in an increase in the reported absorbance, because the detector is simply responding to the stray light. In practice the concentration of the sample or the optical path length must be adjusted to place the unknown absorbance within a range that is valid for the instrument. Sometimes an empirical calibration function is developed, using known concentrations of the sample, to allow measurements into the region where the instrument is becoming non-linear.

As a rough guide, an instrument with a single monochromator would typically have a stray light level corresponding to about 3 Absorbance Units (AU), which would make measurements above about 2 AU problematic. A more complex instrument with a double monochromator would have a stray light level corresponding to about 6 AU, which would therefore allow measuring a much wider absorbance range.

====Deviations from the Beer–Lambert law====
At sufficiently high concentrations, the absorption bands will saturate and show absorption flattening. The absorption peak appears to flatten because close to 100% of the light is already being absorbed. The concentration at which this occurs depends on the particular compound being measured. One test that can be used to test for this effect is to vary the path length of the measurement. In the Beer–Lambert law, varying concentration and path length has an equivalent effect—diluting a solution by a factor of 10 has the same effect as shortening the path length by a factor of 10. If cells of different path lengths are available, testing if this relationship holds true is one way to judge if absorption flattening is occurring.

Solutions that are not homogeneous can show deviations from the Beer–Lambert law because of the phenomenon of absorption flattening. This can happen, for instance, where the absorbing substance is located within suspended particles. The deviations will be most noticeable under conditions of low concentration and high absorbance. The last reference describes a way to correct for this deviation.

Some solutions, like copper(II) chloride in water, change visually at a certain concentration because of changed conditions around the coloured ion (the divalent copper ion). For copper(II) chloride it means a shift from blue to green, which would mean that monochromatic measurements would deviate from the Beer–Lambert law.

====Measurement uncertainty sources====
The above factors contribute to the measurement uncertainty of the results obtained with UV-Vis spectrophotometry. If UV-Vis spectrophotometry is used in quantitative chemical analysis then the results are additionally affected by uncertainty sources arising from the nature of the compounds and/or solutions that are measured. These include spectral interferences caused by absorption band overlap, fading of the color of the absorbing species (caused by decomposition or reaction) and possible composition mismatch between the sample and the calibration solution.

==Ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometer==

The instrument used in ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy is called a UV-Vis spectrophotometer. It measures the intensity of light after passing through a sample (formula_3), and compares it to the intensity of light before it passes through the sample (formula_8). The ratio formula_9 is called the &quot;transmittance&quot;, and is usually expressed as a percentage (%T). The absorbance, formula_10, is based on the transmittance:
:formula_11

The UV–visible spectrophotometer can also be configured to measure reflectance. In this case, the spectrophotometer measures the intensity of light reflected from a sample (formula_3), and compares it to the intensity of light reflected from a reference material (formula_8) (such as a white tile). The ratio formula_9 is called the &quot;reflectance&quot;, and is usually expressed as a percentage (%R).

The basic parts of a spectrophotometer are a light source, a holder for the sample, a diffraction grating or a prism as a monochromator to separate the different wavelengths of light, and a detector. The radiation source is often a tungsten filament (300–2500 nm), a deuterium arc lamp, which is continuous over the ultraviolet region (190–400 nm), a xenon arc lamp, which is continuous from 160 to 2,000 nm; or more recently, light emitting diodes (LED) for the visible wavelengths. The detector is typically a photomultiplier tube, a photodiode, a photodiode array or a charge-coupled device (CCD). Single photodiode detectors and photomultiplier tubes are used with scanning monochromators, which filter the light so that only light of a single wavelength reaches the detector at one time. The scanning monochromator moves the diffraction grating to &quot;step-through&quot; each wavelength so that its intensity may be measured as a function of wavelength. Fixed monochromators are used with CCDs and photodiode arrays. As both of these devices consist of many detectors grouped into one or two dimensional arrays, they are able to collect light of different wavelengths on different pixels or groups of pixels simultaneously.
A spectrophotometer can be either &quot;single beam&quot; or &quot;double beam&quot;. In a single beam instrument (such as the Spectronic 20), all of the light passes through the sample cell. formula_8 must be measured by removing the sample. This was the earliest design and is still in common use in both teaching and industrial labs.

In a double-beam instrument, the light is split into two beams before it reaches the sample. One beam is used as the reference; the other beam passes through the sample. The reference beam intensity is taken as 100% Transmission (or 0 Absorbance), and the measurement displayed is the ratio of the two beam intensities. Some double-beam instruments have two detectors (photodiodes), and the sample and reference beam are measured at the same time. In other instruments, the two beams pass through a beam chopper, which blocks one beam at a time. The detector alternates between measuring the sample beam and the reference beam in synchronism with the chopper. There may also be one or more dark intervals in the chopper cycle. In this case, the measured beam intensities may be corrected by subtracting the intensity measured in the dark interval before the ratio is taken.

In a single-beam instrument, the cuvette containing only a solvent has to be measured first. Mettler Toledo developed a single beam array spectrophotometer that allows fast and accurate measurements over the UV-Vis range. The light source consists of a Xenon flash lamp for the ultraviolet (UV) as well as for the visible (VIS) and near-infrared wavelength regions covering a spectral range from 190 up to 1100 nm. The lamp flashes are focused on a glass fiber which drives the beam of light onto a cuvette containing the sample solution. The beam passes through the sample and specific wavelengths are absorbed by the sample components. The remaining light is collected after the cuvette by a glass fiber and driven into a spectrograph. The spectrograph consists of a diffraction grating that separates the light into the different wavelengths, and a CCD sensor to record the data, respectively. The whole spectrum is thus simultaneously measured, allowing for fast recording. 

Samples for UV-Vis spectrophotometry are most often liquids, although the absorbance of gases and even of solids can also be measured. Samples are typically placed in a transparent cell, known as a cuvette. Cuvettes are typically rectangular in shape, commonly with an internal width of 1 cm. (This width becomes the path length, formula_16, in the Beer–Lambert law.) Test tubes can also be used as cuvettes in some instruments. The type of sample container used must allow radiation to pass over the spectral region of interest. The most widely applicable cuvettes are made of high quality fused silica or quartz glass because these are transparent throughout the UV, visible and near infrared regions. Glass and plastic cuvettes are also common, although glass and most plastics absorb in the UV, which limits their usefulness to visible wavelengths.

Specialized instruments have also been made. These include attaching spectrophotometers to telescopes to measure the spectra of astronomical features. UV–visible microspectrophotometers consist of a UV–visible microscope integrated with a UV–visible spectrophotometer.

A complete spectrum of the absorption at all wavelengths of interest can often be produced directly by a more sophisticated spectrophotometer. In simpler instruments the absorption is determined one wavelength at a time and then compiled into a spectrum by the operator. By removing the concentration dependence, the extinction coefficient (ε) can be determined as a function of wavelength.

== Microspectrophotometry ==
UV–visible spectroscopy of microscopic samples is done by integrating an optical microscope with UV–visible optics, white light sources, a monochromator, and a sensitive detector such as a charge-coupled device (CCD) or photomultiplier tube (PMT). As only a single optical path is available, these are single beam instruments. Modern instruments are capable of measuring UV–visible spectra in both reflectance and transmission of micron-scale sampling areas. The advantages of using such instruments is that they are able to measure microscopic samples but are also able to measure the spectra of larger samples with high spatial resolution. As such, they are used in the forensic laboratory to analyze the dyes and pigments in individual textile fibers, microscopic paint chips and the color of glass fragments. They are also used in materials science and biological research and for determining the energy content of coal and petroleum source rock by measuring the vitrinite reflectance. Microspectrophotometers are used in the semiconductor and micro-optics industries for monitoring the thickness of thin films after they have been deposited. In the semiconductor industry, they are used because the critical dimensions of circuitry is microscopic. A typical test of a semiconductor wafer would entail the acquisition of spectra from many points on a patterned or unpatterned wafer. The thickness of the deposited films may be calculated from the interference pattern of the spectra. In addition, ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometry can be used to determine the thickness, along with the refractive index and extinction coefficient of thin films. A map of the film thickness across the entire wafer can then be generated and used for quality control purposes.

== Additional applications ==
UV-Vis can be applied to characterize the rate of a chemical reaction. Illustrative is the conversion of the yellow-orange and blue isomers of mercury dithizonate. This method of analysis relies on the fact that concentration is linearly proportional to concentration. In the same approach allows determination of equilibria between chromophores. 

From the spectrum of burning gases, it is possible to determine a chemical composition of a fuel, temperature of gases, and air-fuel ratio.

<doc id="71025" wikidata="Q42555" url="?curid=71025" title="Exotic Shorthair">
<text>The Exotic Shorthair is a breed of cat developed as a short-haired version of the Persian. The Exotic is similar to the Persian in appearance with the exception of the short dense coat.

== History ==
In the late 1950s, the Persian was used as an outcross by some American Shorthair breeders. This was done in secret in order to improve their body type, and crosses were also made with the Russian Blue and the Burmese. The crossbreed look gained recognition in the show ring, but unhappy American Shorthair breeders successfully produced a new breed standard that would disqualify American Shorthairs that showed signs of crossbreeding. One American Shorthair breeder who saw the potential of the Persian/American Shorthair cross proposed and eventually got the Cat Fanciers&#x27; Association judge and American Shorthair breeder Jane Martinke to recognize them as a new breed in 1966, under the name Exotic Shorthair. In 1987, the Cat Fanciers&#x27; Association closed the Exotic to shorthair outcrosses, leaving Persian as the only allowable outcross breed.

== Description ==

===Appearance===
The Exotic Shorthair is a medium to large sized breed just like the Persian. The head of the Exotic Shorthair is round and large. The ears are small with a well rounded tip that face low on the head. The cheeks are full and rounded. The eyes are large and round. The tail is short compared to the length of the body. Just like the British Shorthair and the Persian the Exotic Shorthair comes in all different colour variations.

==Longhair Exotics==
Because of the regular use of Persian as outcrosses, some Exotics may carry a copy of the recessive longhair gene. When two such cats mate, there is a 1 in 4 chance of each offspring being longhaired. Longhaired Exotics are not considered Persians by the Cat Fanciers&#x27; Association, although The International Cat Association accepts them as Persians. Other associations like the American Cat Fanciers Association register them as a separate Exotic Longhair breed.



==Health==

Like the Persian the Exotic Shorthair is a brachycephalic breed, meaning that it has problems as a result of having the nose and eyes in close proximity to each other, giving the appearance of a pushed-in face. Some conditions common in the Exotic Shorthair are listed below.

* Brachycephalic airway obstructive syndrome. Also referred to as brachycephalic respiratory syndrome or congenital obstructive upper airway disease, this causes upper airway abnormalities ranging in severity. The syndrome can cause increased airway resistance, inflammation of structures in the airways, and increased strain on the heart. Treatment includes weight loss, surgery, and avoiding humid or hot conditions.
* Corneal sequestrum. A necrosis of the cornea of unknown origin.
* Dystocia. An abnormal labor due to large-domed skulls.
* Feline polycystic kidney disease (PKD). Exotic Shorthairs, as well as Persians and other Persian-derived cats, have a high chance of inheriting PKD, a disease that can lead to kidney failure. Several studies using ultrasound scan screening have shown that the prevalence of PKD in Exotics is between 40 and 50% in developed nations. DNA screening for PKD is recommended for all Exotic cats used in breeding programs to reduce the incidence of kidney disease by spaying and neutering PKD positive cats.

In a review of over 5,000 cases of urate urolithiasis the Exotic Shorthair was significantly under-represented, with only one of the recorded cases belonging to an Exotic Shorthair.

== Recognition ==
The Exotic has steadily gained popularity among cat fanciers with the help of the devoted advocates of the breed who saw the value in a Persian and Shorthair crossbreed. 
* In 1967, the Exotic Shorthair was first accepted for Championship status by the Cat Fanciers&#x27; Association.
* In 1971, the first Exotic Shorthair achieved the status of Grand Champion.
* In 1986, the Fédération Internationale Féline recognized the Exotic Shorthair.
* In 1991, an Exotic was the Cat Fanciers&#x27; Association&#x27;s Cat of the Year.
* In 1992, the Cat Fanciers&#x27; Association&#x27;s Best Kitten was an Exotic.

<doc id="71026" wikidata="Q3269731" url="?curid=71026" title="Gutka">
<text>Gutka, ghutka, guṭkha is a type of betel quid and chewing tobacco preparation made of crushed areca nut (also called betel nut), tobacco, catechu, paraffin wax, slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) and sweet or savory flavourings, in India, Pakistan, other Asian countries, and North America.

Using gutka is highly addictive and can cause various harmful effects such as head and neck cancer, oral and oropharyngeal cancers, coronary heart disease, as well as negative reproductive effects including stillbirth, premature birth and low birth weight.

Gutka is manufactured in the sub-continent and exported to a few other countries, often marketed under the guise of a &quot;safer&quot; product than cigarettes and tobacco. Reported to have both stimulant and relaxation effects, it is sold throughout South Asia and some Pacific regions in small, individual-sized foil packets/sachets and tins that cost between 2 and 10 rupees each. It is widely consumed in India, Pakistan and the Madhesh region of Nepal. Gutka is consumed by placing a pinch of it between the gum and cheek and gently sucking and chewing, similar to chewing tobacco. Due to containing cancer-causing substances, it is subjected in India to the same restrictions and warnings as cigarettes. Highly addictive and a known carcinogen, gutkha is the subject of much controversy in India. Many states have sought to curb its immense popularity by taxing sales of gutkha heavily or by banning it.

== Characteristics ==
Gutka is a commercially produced form of smokeless tobacco. Manufacturers add sweet or savory flavors, making it more appealing to women and young people in some locations. The combinations of gutka ingredients vary according to local preferences. Spices may include mustard, turmeric, anise seeds, cardamom, saffron and cloves.

In addition to areca nut, nicotine, slaked lime, paraffin and catechu, it can be laced with thousands of chemicals. It is a powdery, granular, light brownish to white substance. Within moments of chewing mixing with saliva, the gutkha begins to dissolve and turn deep red in colour. It may impart upon its user a &quot;buzz&quot; somewhat more intense than that of tobacco chewing, snuffing and smoking.

Gutka turns saliva bright red, and when it is chewed long and often enough it will stain a user&#x27;s teeth bright red too. Saliva is generally spat onto a wall or at the ground, causing a red stain that is quite resistant to the elements. Some building owners have taken to combating this by painting murals of gods on their walls, with the idea that gutkha chewers would not spit on a god.

Areca nut &quot;quid chewing has claimed to produce a sense of well being, euphoria, warm sensations of the body, sweating, salivation, palpitation and heightened alertness, tolerance to hunger, and increased capacity and stamina to work.&quot;

== Health effects ==
Gutka is highly addictive, represents a major health risk, has no safe level use and is not a safe substitute for smoking. Globally smokeless tobacco products like gutka contribute to 650 000 deaths each year with a significant proportion of them in Southeast Asia. 

Using gutka can cause a number of adverse health effects such as head and neck cancer, oral cancer, oral submucous fibrosis, oesophagus cancer, and pancreatic cancer, cardiovascular disease, and asthma. It also raises the risk of fatal coronary artery disease, fatal stroke and non-fatal ischaemic heart disease When a person chews gutka, the mixture directly enters the system through the oral cavity, which absorbs 28 cancer-causing chemicals.

Gutka can cause adverse reproductive effects including stillbirth, premature birth, low birth weight. Nicotine in gutka that are used during pregnancy can affect how a baby&#x27;s brain develops before birth.

Gutka use causes the production of various reactive free radicals that induce oxidative stress, particularly in oral tissues. Gutka exposure can lead to the oxidation of guanine bases in DNA to form 8-hydroxy-2’-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG or its tautomer 8-oxo-dG) as a major byproduct. Exposure to Gutka tends to be highest in saliva and urine as evaluated by measuring 8-OHdG in DNA. 

Creative advertising by tobacco companies and lack of accessible information for the public leads to many gutka users being unaware of the dangers it can bring. Often users believe that gutka can act as a digestion aid, kill germs, and generally give a sense of well being. In fact 34.4% of smokers have switched to smokeless tobacco use as way to quit but there is no scientific evidence that using gutka can help a person quit smoking. As of 2015 it was the fourth most common addictive product worldwide.

== Usage ==

Use of gutka and other forms of tobacco are culturally ingrained and use can begin at a young age. Smokeless tobacco use is most common in India where oral cancer accounts for 30 to 40% of cancer cases. Its use has been reported in Thailand, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Malaysia, Cambodia, China, Indonesia and New Guinea. Immigrants to the United Kingdom, parts of Africa, Australia, North America have brought their habits with them. 

Gutka is readily available in these locations, especially in neighborhood Asian markets in highly populated areas. Immigrants to the United States where spitting in public is not as socially acceptable, learn to be discreet. Those in the lower socioeconomic populations are especially at risk. It is here that access to education and treatment is limited. Easy access and extremely low cost lead to early addiction and the prevalence of gutka use. Precancerous lesions have been observed in young children and symptoms of cancer often appear by high school or college age. 

Smoking is not allowed in many places, and when done by children, is disapproved of. In contrast gutka use, being all but invisible to others, is the method of choice. A &quot;New York Times&quot; article reported in 2002 that sales of gutka and the tobaccoless version, paan masala, reached $1 billion a year.

=== India ===
Over 25% of India&#x27;s population use tobacco products including cigarettes and multiple forms of smokeless tobacco. India has the largest number of smokeless tobacco users in the world. The poorest populations are greatly affected due to the detrimental effects of its use and the subsequent costs of medical care. Many Indian states have sought to curb the use and spread of gutka by taxing sales heavily or by banning it.

They have banned the sale, manufacture, distribution and storage of gutka and all its variants. As of May 2013, gutka is banned in 24 states and 3 union territories. The federal Food Safety and Regulation (Prohibition) Act 2011 allows harmful products such as gutka to be banned for a year. This can be renewed annually, resulting in a permanent ban. The ban is enforced by the state public health ministry, the state Food and Drug Administration, and the local police. Enforcement of the law is generally lax and many shops still sell gutka, although it may not be displayed. Enforcemnent is stricter in some regions like Mumbai and Delhi, but illegal sale of gutka still occurs.

In 2019, the Delhi government extended the ban for one more year on Gutka, Pan Masala, Flavoured/Scented Tobacco, Kharra and similar products containing tobacco. In September 2012, State of Delhi banned Gutka and Pan Masala containing tobacco and/or nicotine. After the notification, Gutka manufacturers separated the components like tobacco from Gutka and Pan Masala. Since the term ‘Gutka and Pan Masala Containing Tobacco’ was used in the notification. The components like tobacco were manufactured and sold in separate pouches after the ban. The notification was revised in March 2015 to make it more strict and banned all smokeless tobacco (SLT) products including twin-pack. Offenders can be fined or receive prison sentences. The law has provisions of imposing fines up to on the sale of products that are injurious to health.

Research firm Edelweiss estimates the gutka ban will cause the industry in losses.

==== Advertising ====
Like alcohol and tobacco products, there is a ban on advertisement of gutka. Often tobacco companies advertise gutka as pan masala in order to skirt the ban on advertising tobacco products. Surrogate advertisements often use pan masala ads to promote gutka products with similar name and packaging.

According to the Food Safety and Standards (Prohibition and Restriction on Sales) Regulations, 2011 of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India, misleading advertisement of such products invites a fine of .

According to StraitsResearch, The India pan masala market is expected to reach by 2026 at the CAGR of 10.4% during the forecast period 2019–2026. The India pan masala market is driven by significant switching of consumers from tobacco products to pan masala, aggressive advertising and convenient packaging, and Maharashtra State’s revocation of the ban over pan masala products.

<text>The Tie That Binds is a novel by Kent Haruf. Written in 1984, the novel is Haruf&#x27;s first major work, receiving a Whiting Award and a special Hemingway Foundation/PEN citation. It is the story of 80-year-old Edith Goodnough of Holt County, Colorado, as told to an unnamed inquirer on a Sunday afternoon in the spring of 1977 by her 50-year-old neighbor.

==Plot summary==

The story opens with the narrator, Sanders Roscoe, defending his neighbor Edith Goodnough to a reporter trying to dig up dirt on her. She has been accused of murdering her brother Lyman. Sanders seems disappointed in the sheriff for caving in to the reporter, saying that to understand what happened you would have had to know Edith&#x27;s story, which he begins to tell.

In 1896, newlyweds Roy and Ada Goodnough leave Iowa and settle down in northeastern Colorado under the Homestead Act. Roy eventually succeeds in growing wheat. Ada bears him two children: Edith, who is born in 1897, and Lyman, born two years later. Hannah Roscoe, the narrator&#x27;s grandmother, helps deliver Edith and Lyman.

Very soon Ada regrets leaving Iowa. Her husband turns out to be a bully, an angry and violent man who makes her and their children work very hard on the farm. When she dies in 1914, aged only 42, Edith has to take over all of Ada&#x27;s chores and duties. Then, in 1915, Roy&#x27;s hands get entangled in a machine, and nine of his fingers are chopped off. He treats Edith and Lyman as his &quot;self-sired farmhands&quot;, bossing them around and making all decisions himself.

As the two siblings grow up, they start looking for means of escape but soon realize that they are stuck on their father&#x27;s farm. For the next 37 years, Edith performs the duties of farmer, housewife and nurse without ever complaining, and refusing to get involved with men except for a brief romance with the narrator&#x27;s father, who Edith loves but refuses to marry. Despite her rejection, he never gets over her. Lyman finally sees his chance of escape when in 1941 the United States is attacked by Japan. In the middle of the night and with the help of the Roscoes, he leaves the farm and goes to the city to join the armed forces. At 42 he is too old to enlist and instead embarks on a 20-year tour of the United States. During those years, Edith never doubts that brother will return. He does in the early 1960s, almost ten years after their father&#x27;s death at 82.

For six years Edith and Lyman, now both in their sixties, live happily together in their farm house. Then in 1967, the Goodnoughs, Sanders and his wife Mavis, now eight months pregnant, decide to go to the county fair together. They stay late into the night, drinking and having a good time, but on the way home Lyman crashes his car, causing Mavis to miscarry and giving himself a head injury from which he never truly recovers. Edith looks after her brother, who becomes more and more reclusive, eventually refusing to leave the house and his new obsession: planning trips around the country that he&#x27;ll never take.

As they grow older and frailer, Edith decides to move everything downstairs and close off the second story, and enlists Sanders&#x27; help. Upstairs, he discovers only one bedroom with only one bed, a fact which Edith does not attempt to disguise, saying only that they moved the extra bed out when Lyman came home to make room for his things. In the following years, Edith draws some pleasure from spending afternoons with Rena, Sanders&#x27; daughter, who is born in 1969. But soon it becomes too dangerous for Rena to go to the Goodnoughs on her own, as Lyman, who has regressed to infancy, is prone to unprompted outbursts of violence.

Eventually, on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1976, Edith, is unable to care for Lyman but unwilling to put him in a home. She has Lyman put on his best clothes, cooks a three-course dinner for him, waits for him to fall asleep and then sets fire to their house. The fire is detected too soon and the two siblings are evacuated. However, Lyman never recovers from the injuries inflicted by the fire and dies soon afterwards.

In the spring of 1977 Edith is still lying in a hospital bed with a policeman stationed outside her room and facing charges of attempted murder. The Roscoes visit every day.

==Adaptations==

In 2019, a dramatization of &quot;The Tie That Binds&quot;, adapted by Carol Samson, was featured in that year&#x27;s Kent Haruf Literary Celebration, performed in his hometown Salida.

<text>&#x27; (); also known as pan con tomate&quot;&quot;&#x27; (both meaning &quot;bread with tomato&quot;) outside of Catalonia, is a traditional food of Catalan, Aragonese and Balearic cuisine. is considered a staple of Catalan cuisine and identity.

It consists of bread, which may or may not be toasted, with tomato rubbed over and seasoned with olive oil and salt.

It is considered one of the typical examples that define the Mediterranean diet, extended as a traditional recipe throughout the Catalan Countries, and its preparation has become an iconic ritual of Catalan culture.
It is popularly consumed on its own as a snack, as sandwich or a tapa with any meal, from breakfast to dinner.

==Preparation==

In some Catalan restaurants, the tomato is spread on the bread, while others provide the guests with the ingredients to do the work themselves. The dish is served accompanied with any sorts of sausages (cured botifarres, xoriço, fuet, Iberian ham, etc.), ham, cheeses, omelettes, anchovies or other marinated fish, or grilled vegetables like escalivada.

In Majorca, (&quot;bread with oil&quot;) is prepared with tomato called , a specific variety of vine tomatoes, smaller and with a taste that is slightly more intense and sour than normal tomatoes due to the loss of acidity in the tomato.

The original base used to be made with toasted slices of (&quot;peasants&#x27; bread&quot;), a typical round loaf of wheat bread of a fair size (from , from some in diameter).

If the mixture is not pre-made, there is said to be an ideal order in which the ingredients are integrated to yield the best flavour. First, if used, the garlic is rubbed on the bread. Then the same is done with the tomato. Next comes the salt, and lastly the olive oil.

==History==
The origin of this dish is disputed, as tomato is relatively new to Catalan cuisine (it came from America only after the 15th century). Widely regarded as the epitome of Catalan cuisine and identity, some sources claim it is actually a relatively recent (mid to late 19th century) in all the Mediterranean coast of Spain.

Catalan chef Josep Lladonosa i Giró says it was first documented in the 18th century. The cook, born in 1938, remembers his grandmother explaining that her parents used to eat a dish called . With better precision, Catalan cooking historian Nèstor Luján says that the first written reference is from 1884 and, according to his thesis, the recipe would have been created in the rural world during an abundant tomato harvest. People would have used the tomatoes to soften hard and dry bread.

The dish shares some similarities with the tomato and olive oil-rubbed &quot;ħobż biz-Zejt&quot; of Malta, with the &quot;pan-bagnat&quot; of Nice, in the Provence region of France, the tomato-topped version of Italian &quot;bruschetta&quot;.

<text>Davis County is a county in northern Utah, United States. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 362,679, making it Utah&#x27;s third-most populous county. Its county seat is Farmington, and its largest city by both population and area is Layton.

Davis County is part of the Ogden-Clearfield, UT Metropolitan Statistical Area as well as the Salt Lake City-Provo-Orem, UT Combined Statistical Area.

==History==
The legislature of the provisional State of Deseret defined the county in an October 5, 1850, act, which also designated Farmington as the seat due to its location midway between boundaries at the Weber River on the north and the Jordan River on the south. It was named for Daniel C. Davis, a captain in the Mormon Battalion. The county boundaries were altered in 1852, 1854, 1855, and in 1862. In 1880 the county gained part of the islands and waters of Great Salt Lake that had previously been attached to Salt Lake County. The county boundary has remained unchanged since that time.

During its first 50 years, Davis County grew slowly. With the advent of the Utah Central Rail Road in 1870, a transition to mechanized agriculture and a surge of commerce, banking, improved roads, new water systems, and electrification of homes began. However, by 1940, the population was barely 16,000.

With the establishment of Hill Air Force Base in northern Davis County and southern Weber County, there was a surge in civilian employment after World War II. The county doubled in population between 1940 and 1950 and doubled again between 1950 and 1960 as part of the nationwide suburb boom that was occurring at the time. By 1990 there were 188,000 residents, and in 2000, there were 239,000. As of 2020, the county population is above 360,000.

==Geography==
Davis County has an area of , of which is land and (53%) is water. It is Utah&#x27;s smallest county by land area and second smallest by total area.

The county lies generally between the Great Salt Lake on the west and the Wasatch Range on the east, which rises to a height of in the county at Thurston Peak.

The Great Salt Lake is surrounded by marshland and mudflats, and lies at an average elevation of approximately , varying depending on the water level, which can lead to drastic changes in the lake size due to its shallowness. Davis County includes Antelope Island, the lake&#x27;s largest island. The entire island is a state park, designated to protect natural scenery and especially wildlife on the island, which includes bighorn sheep, pronghorn, and a bison herd.

The inhabited portion of Davis County between the lake and the mountain range is called the Wasatch Front, a narrow stretch of land that restricts north–south transportation in the county.

==Climate==
Eastern parts of Davis County experience a humid continental climate (&quot;Dsa&quot;), while western parts may experience a mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot;). Summers are dry and hot and winters are cold and wet, but rarely frigid. Snow is frequent during winter, with up to annually on high bench areas in the east and at least on the valley floor. Annual precipitation averages between in the county, with spring being the wettest season and summer the driest. Summers are hot, with several days each year averaging above . However, the humidity is low, making for comparatively comfortable temperatures. In winter, temperatures sometimes drop below , but rarely for extended periods of time. Compared to Salt Lake County to the south, the weather in Davis County is extreme. Lake-effect snows hit the southern portion of the county harder, and even in non-lake-effect storms, the lack of a rain shadow in Davis County (much of Salt Lake County lies in the rain shadow of the Oquirrh Mountains) means that storms often hit Davis County harder. In addition, canyon winds from the east can sometimes cause devastating wind damage, and wind gusts above have been reported. This occurs when a powerful high pressure system is over Wyoming, and is a frequent occurrence. Extreme wind events, however, seem to have declined in frequency in recent years.

==Law and government==

A three-member board of commissioners is the county&#x27;s governing body. The commissioners are elected to staggered four-year terms. They are responsible for all county services and operations. They approve, adopt, and amend the budget; they also serve as the legislative body and regulate business licensing in the county&#x27;s unincorporated areas. The county commissioners (as of 2021) are:

* Bob J. Stevenson, chair (term ends January 5, 2027)
* Randy B. Elliott, vice chair (term ends January 6, 2025)
* Lorene Miner Kamalu (term ends January 5, 2027)

Other elected offices include the County Attorney, Assessor, Clerk/Auditor, Sheriff, Recorder, Surveyor, and Treasurer.

* The assessor is responsible for the valuing of all real property in the county. The current assessor is Dale Peterson (as of March 2018).
* The clerk/auditor serves as the county&#x27;s chief financial and budget officer. The current Clerk/Auditor is Curtis Koch (as of March 2018).
* The treasurer is responsible for collection and investing of county funds. The current Treasurer is Mark Altom (as of March 2019).

Davis County voters are traditionally Republican. In no national election since 1948 has the county selected the Democratic Party candidate (as of 2024).













==Economy==
Davis County is often characterized as a bedroom community. According to the Census Bureau&#x27;s 2004 American Community Survey, 42.3% of the population work in another county. South Davis County commuters who work in Salt Lake County frequently encounter commuting time traffic bottlenecks between Davis and Salt Lake Counties. The Legacy Parkway and the &quot;FrontRunner&quot; commuter rail project were built to alleviate this problem.

The commuter rail stations in the county have spurred plans for extensive transit-oriented development (TOD), including the Station Park development in Farmington. Farmington is also the home of the Lagoon Amusement Park, the primary amusement park on the Wasatch Front.

Davis County&#x27;s largest employer is Hill Air Force Base. Earnings of civilians at Hill AFB are almost double the state average. Hill AFB accounts for about 12% of the economy of Davis County and about 2.6% of the economy of Utah. Hill AFB provides employment for nearly 23,000 military and civilian personnel (approximately 4,500 active duty, 1,200 reservists, 13,000 federal civil servants, and 4,000 civilian contractors). Other large employers include Davis School District, Lagoon Amusement Park, and Lifetime Products.
==Education==
Public education in Davis County is provided by the Davis School District. There are currently 59 elementary schools, 16 junior high schools, 9 high schools, and 3 alternative schools in the school district. The high schools are as follows, showing where they are located:

* Bountiful High School - Bountiful
* Clearfield High School - Clearfield
* Davis High School - Kaysville
* Layton High School - Layton
* Northridge High School - Layton
* Syracuse High School - Syracuse
* Farmington High School - Farmington
* Viewmont High School - Bountiful
* Woods Cross High School - Woods Cross

The campus of Davis Technical College is in Kaysville.

Utah State University owns and operates the Utah Botanical Center in Kaysville, which includes an education center. Weber State University also operates campuses in Layton and Farmington.

==Transportation==
The most important road in the county is Interstate 15, which runs north–south through the center of the county. US-89 enters parallel to I-15 from Salt Lake County to the south and runs north through North Salt Lake and Bountiful as a city road before merging with I-15. It re-emerges in Farmington near the Lagoon Amusement Park, heading along the eastern benches on the slopes of the Wasatch Range, entering Weber County near South Weber. The Utah Department of Transportation is currently (2019) upgrading US-89 to a freeway through eastern Layton north to its interchange with I-84 near the Weber County border. Congestion is a significant problem in the county, as east–west transportation is restricted by the narrow urban corridor and many of its citizens commute south to Salt Lake County.

To relieve congestion in the county, the Legacy Parkway began construction in 2006. Construction began near the US-89/I-15 interchange in Farmington in 2004, but was soon halted due to a lawsuit filed by environmentalists, who were concerned that the road would harm marshlands along the eastern edge of the Great Salt Lake. They requested an independent evaluation for completeness of the environmental impact statement. A settlement was reached in 2005 and the final injunction was lifted in 2006. The Legacy Parkway opened in 2008, running from the US-89/I-15 interchange in Farmington southward to connect with I-215 near the border with Salt Lake County. An extensive trail system, wetland protection measures, and landscaping were implemented along the highway in response to the environmentalist&#x27;s concerns, in addition to a lower speed limit and a ban of semi-trailer trucks on the highway. However, this compromise will expire in 2020, and the roadway is expected to begin functioning under normal Interstate System regulations (i.e. trucks and higher speed limits allowed).

In 2008, the Utah Transit Authority opened the &quot;FrontRunner&quot; commuter rail line from Salt Lake City north to Ogden, serving the length of Davis County with stations in Woods Cross, Farmington, Layton, and Clearfield.

<doc id="71044" wikidata="Q111304" url="?curid=71044" title="Daggett County, Utah">
<text>Daggett County ( ) is a county in the northeastern corner of the U.S. state of Utah. As of the 2020 United States Census, the population was 935, making it the least populous county in Utah. Its county seat is Manila. The county was named for Ellsworth Daggett, the first surveyor-general of Utah. The small community of Dutch John, located near the state line with Colorado and Wyoming, became an incorporated town in January 2016.

==History==
Due to dangerous roads, mountainous terrain, and frequent bad weather preventing travel via a direct route, 19th century residents in the north portion of Uintah County had to travel on both stagecoach and rail to conduct business in Vernal, the county seat, a mere away. The journey involved overland travel to a train station in Wyoming, to either Mack, Colorado, Price, or Salt Lake City, then a stagecoach to Vernal. In the fall 1917 election, the Uintah county voters voted to establish a separate county on the northern slope of the Uinta Mountains. The act establishing the county was approved on January 7, 1918, naming Manila as the county seat.

The boundary between Daggett and Uintah counties was adjusted in 1919, with some territory being returned to Uintah. Daggett County boundaries have remained unchanged since 1919.

==Geography==
Daggett County lies at the lower northeastern corner of Utah. Its northern border abuts the south border of the state of Wyoming, and its eastern boundary abuts the western border of the state of Colorado. Its main geographical features are the Uinta Mountains, which comprise its southwestern portion and delineate part of its southern border, and the Green River, which has carved a deep gorge through the east-central part of the county. In 1958, the United States Bureau of Reclamation took advantage of this natural feature to construct the Flaming Gorge Dam, creating the Flaming Gorge Reservoir, which began filling in 1964.

The county terrain slopes to the north and east on the northern flank of the Uintas. The county&#x27;s highest point is on a mountain crest along its south border, at ASL. The county has a total area of , of which is land and (3.3%) is water. It is the fourth-smallest county in Utah by area. Over 90% of the land of Daggett County is under federal ownership.

<text>Carbon County is a county in the U.S. state of Utah. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 20,412. Its county seat and largest city is Price.

The Price, UT Micropolitan Statistical Area includes all of Carbon County.

==History==
Carbon County was part of Emery County, founded in 1880. The demographics along the Price River changed with the construction of the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad in 1883 and the development of coal mines, largely in upper Emery, to fuel the railroad. The Utah Territory Legislature was petitioned to split off the north part, and thus it established Carbon County effective March 8, 1894. It was named for the element Carbon, to emphasize the industrial nature of the area.

Carbon County is the second-largest natural gas producer in Utah (after Uintah County), with 94 billion cubic feet produced in 2008.

==Geography==

The Green River flows south-southeastward along the county&#x27;s eastern border. The lower central part of Carbon County is a continuation of Castle Valley in Emery County, but in Carbon, the valley is ringed with mountains - the Wasatch Range to the west and northwest, and the Book Cliffs to the north and northeast. The county generally slopes to the south and east; its highest point is Monument Peak on the crest of the Wasatch Mountains near the midpoint of the county&#x27;s western border, at ASL. The county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.4%) is water.

==Politics and government==
Carbon County historically was the base of Democratic Party support in strongly Republican Utah with its sizable unionized mining population. It voted for Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996 by wide margins. In 1964 Lyndon Johnson carried 72.7% of votes in the county. At the state level, it was no less Democratic; in the 1992 gubernatorial election, it was one of two counties (the other being Summit County) that voted for Democratic candidate Stewart Hanson over Republican Michael Leavitt.

Since the turn of the millennium, however, Carbon County has trended Republican. It voted for George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004 while voting for the Democratic gubernatorial candidates. In 2008, John McCain won Carbon County with 52.60% of the vote, versus 44.59% for Barack Obama, making him the last Democratic nominee to win more than forty percent of the county&#x27;s vote. In 2012, the county&#x27;s Democratic vote fell further as Mitt Romney carried 67.3% to 30.1% for Obama. In 2016, despite Utah&#x27;s strong swing against the Republicans due to the presence of conservative independent Evan McMullin, Carbon County was the only county in the state to swing more Republican, as Donald Trump won 66% to Hillary Clinton&#x27;s 21.5% percent. In 2020, Trump again carried the county with the largest percentage (71.4%) of any Republican to date.

<text>Cache County ( ) is a county located in the northern region of Utah bordering Idaho. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 133,154, with an estimated 140,173 in 2022. Its county seat and largest city is Logan. Cache County is one of two counties included in the Logan metropolitan area, alongside Franklin County, Idaho.

==History==
Indigenous peoples occupied the valleys of present Cache County as much as 10,000 BCE. Near the present epoch, the valley served the Plains Indians and the Shoshone. Trappers and explorers visited the area in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. John Henry Weber and Jim Bridger came through in 1824; Peter Skene Ogden and James Beckwourth passed through in 1825.

In July 1855, a group of settlers from the LDS Church drove a herd of cattle into the valley and camped at Haw Bush Spring (present Elkhorn Ranch). However, the cold winter drove the settlers back to the Salt Lake Valley. Peter Maughan, who had requested better land for agriculture for the families of his settlement in Lake Point, Utah, was called by President Brigham Young to establish a new settlement in the Cache Valley. On September 15, 1856, he established Maughan&#x27;s Fort, which grew into present day Wellsville. More settlers arrived in the valley, and by 1859 the settlements of Providence, Mendon, Logan, Richmond, and Smithfield had been established.

In preparation for this influx, the Utah Territory legislature created a county, effective January 5, 1856, with seats and government incomplete. By April 4, 1857, the organization was completed, and Logan became the seat. It was named for the fur stashes, known in French as &quot;Caches&quot;, made by many of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company trappers. The county gained area in 1862 when its boundary lines with adjacent counties were adjusted. In 1863, the federal government enacted the Idaho Territory, which administratively removed the described portions of Cache County that lay north of the territorial border. Then in 1864, the east part of the county was partitioned to become Rich County. The borders of Cache County have remained in their present state since 1864.

A rail line between Brigham City and Logan was completed in 1873 (Utah and Northern Railway). The line was extended into Idaho, and a connection was made to the transcontinental railroad, which opened the world to Cache County; their crops (especially grain and dairy) began moving to broader markets. The county&#x27;s sheep population also burgeoned, from 10,000 in 1880 to 300,000 by 1900. By 1900 the Forest Service began regulating grazing practices, which brought the sheep population under control.

There were 16,000 dairy cows in Cache County in 1910. Commercial creameries, flour mills, woolen mills, and knitting factories developed around the farm-based economy. Cache presently continues as the state&#x27;s leader in dairy products and as a major producer of hay, alfalfa, and grain.

==Geography==
Cache County lies on the north edge of Utah. Its north border abuts the south border of the state of Idaho. On the western edge of the county are the Wellsville Mountains and on the eastern edge are the Bear River Mountains, both northern branches of the Wasatch Range. The Cache Valley reaches north to the state border. The Bear River Mountains, the northernmost extension of the Wasatch Range, cover the eastern half of the county. The county&#x27;s highest elevation is Naomi Peak in the northeast part of the county, at above sea level. The Bear River flows through Cache Valley. The county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.7%) is water.

<text>Escalivada (; ), also sometimes transcribed in French as &#x27;escalibade&#x27; and in Spanish as escalibada, is a traditional dish from Roussillon, Catalonia, València, Murcia and Aragón of smoky grilled vegetables. It typically consists of roasted eggplant and bell peppers with olive oil and sometimes onion, tomato, minced garlic, and salt.

The name comes from the Catalan verb , &quot;to cook in ashes&quot;, referencing the dish&#x27;s traditional preparation in the embers of a wood fire.

The dish can be grilled outdoors on a grate until charred and soft or may be cooked whole directly on glowing coals and then peeled. Indoors, the eggplant may be charred on a gas burner and the rest of the vegetables may be broiled. as a relish for grilled meats or fish such as tuna, with anchovies or olives in a salad, or as a topping for &quot;coca&quot; (Catalan flat bread, somewhat similar to a pizza). It is also a common side for pa amb tomàquet (bread with tomato) or truita de patates (potato omelette), often served in typical Catalan households.

<text>Box Elder County is a county at the northwestern corner of Utah, United States. At the 2020 United States census, the population was 57,666, up from the 2010 figure of 49,975. Its county seat and largest city is Brigham City. The county was named for the box elder trees that abound in the county.

Box Elder County is part of the Ogden-Clearfield, UT Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Salt Lake City-Provo-Orem, UT Combined Statistical Area. Box Elder County.

Box Elder County is home to two regional campuses of Utah State University (located in Brigham City and Tremonton).

==History==

The county was created by the Utah Territory legislature on January 5, 1856, with the territory partitioned from Weber County. Its boundaries were altered in 1862 by adjustments between counties and in 1866 when all its area in the now-existent state of Nevada (which had gained territorial status in 1861 and statehood in 1864) was formally partitioned. The county boundaries were finally altered in 1880 by adjustments between Salt Lake and Weber counties. Its boundary has remained unchanged since 1880.

The California Trail followed Goose Creek from a point just north of the Idaho/Utah border southwest across northwestern Box Elder County to Little Goose Creek in northeastern Elko County, Nevada.
The link-up of the first transcontinental railroad occurred at Promontory Summit, Utah in 1869.

The Spiral Jetty, an earthwork sculpture by Robert Smithson, was built on the north shore of the Great Salt Lake in Box Elder County in 1970.

On November 19, 2005, sculptor Zaq Landsberg declared his plot to be independent from the United States, creating the Republic of Zaqistan.

==Geography==
Box Elder County lies at the northwest corner of Utah. Its west border abuts the east border of the state of Nevada and its north border abuts the south border of the state of Idaho. Its territory includes large tracts of barren desert, contrasted by high, forested mountains. The Wasatch Front lies along the south-eastern border, where the main cities are found. The terrain generally slopes to the south (toward the Great Salt Lake), although the NW corner of the county slopes to the north, allowing runoff from that area to flow to the Snake River drainage. The county&#x27;s highest point is a mountain ridge near the NW corner, at ASL. The county has a total area of , of which is land and (15%) is water. It is the fourth-largest county in Utah by area.

In the east lie the Wellsville Mountains, a branch of the Wasatch Range. In the west is a large, mostly uninhabited desert area. The Great Salt Lake lies in the southeastern corner of the county. The combined Interstate 15/Interstate 84 runs northward in the eastern part of the county. The two routes diverge at Tremonton, with I-84 heading northwest past Snowville into central and western Idaho and I-15 heading north past Plymouth and Portage into eastern Idaho.

<text>Burton L. Mack (1931 – March 9, 2022) was an American author and scholar of early Christian history and the New Testament. He was John Wesley Professor emeritus in early Christianity at the Claremont School of Theology in Claremont, California. Mack was primarily a scholar of Christian origins, approaching it from the angle of social group formation. Mack&#x27;s approach was skeptical, and he saw traditional Christian documents like the Gospels as myth as opposed to history. He viewed the gospels more as charter documents of the early Christian movements, not as reliable accounts of the life of Jesus.

In the field of religious studies more generally, Mack was known for popularizing the term &quot;Social Formation,&quot; originally coming from the work of Louis Althusser, as a descriptive category for religion. This stems from his development of a theory of religion as &quot;social interests.&quot; Along with his close friend Jonathan Z. Smith, Mack was active in the Redescribing Christian Origins Group of the Society of Biblical Literature.

Mack died on March 9, 2022, at the age of 90.

==Works==
Though he did not regard himself as a Historical Jesus scholar, he suggested that Jesus was a wandering sage, similar in style to the Greco-Roman Cynics, and that the earliest &quot;Jesus Movements&quot; followed a similar model. He was a noted scholar of the hypothetical &quot;Q Document&quot;, and is confident that it can be sifted into three layers: one containing primarily wisdom sayings, another giving details on how the community ought to behave, and another containing apocalyptic pronouncements.

===&quot;The Lost Gospel&quot;===
&quot;The Lost Gospel&quot; develops the hypothesis of the &quot;Q&quot; source for the common material of Luke and Matthew not found in Mark. Mack develops the thesis that this was the earliest writing about Jesus, developed over decades by a community which he describes with unwavering confidence. Following John S. Kloppenborg, he believes that there are three major layers to it, each of which coincides with a stage in this community&#x27;s life. The layers are significantly structured - the earliest material is spaced out and bracketed by later material, the later material showing awareness of the earlier sayings, but not vice versa.

* The earliest layer, called Q1, is composed of sayings attributed to Jesus and addressing the audience directly. These are mostly instructions on how to behave. The main teachings are to live in poverty, to lend without expecting anything in return, to love your enemies, not to judge, and not to worry, since God will provide what you need. Mack posits that Q1 itself can be broken into two historical stages, the first being simple maxims containing the core of the teachings, and the later stage being developments by the community giving illustrations and arguments for these maxims. Mack suggests that at this time Jesus was seen simply as a teacher by the community which produced the text, with many similarities to a sage in the Cynic tradition.

* The next major development, Q2, comprises the major portion of the Q document as reconstructed by Mack. In this layer the figure of John is introduced (he is not called a baptist in the Q document), as is the eschatological theme of judgement at the end of time, and also opposition to outsiders: the Pharisees and scribes are criticised. Mack sees in this layer an increased anxiety on the part of the community, a need to define itself against others, and also intimation that the community itself was causing tension: there is reference to father turning against son, brother turning against brother etc.

* The final layer, Q3, is very scant and thought by Mack to have been written after the Roman-Jewish war from 66-73AD. Passages added at this time include the temptations of Jesus and a lament for Jerusalem. The remainder consists of stern warnings and threats to keep the law, the first reference to Gehenna (hell fire) occurs at this stage. The severity of the language and the paucity of material compared with the earlier stages is thought to reflect the losses suffered by the community during the war.

==Reception==
Mack&#x27;s hypothesis presenting Jesus and the earliest Christians within the frame of Greco-Roman Cynicism is controversial. While most scholars have recognised finding Jesus within the context of 1st century Judaism, Mack and other proponents go against the majority and argue that Jesus be understood in a Hellenistic context. Evangelical-scholar Craig A. Evans dismisses this theory in &quot;The Misplaced Jesus: Interpreting Jesus in a Judaic Context&quot;, saying: &quot;The Cynic hypothesis will in time assuredly be consigned to the dustbin of ill-conceived hypotheses, but it will be useful nonetheless to appeal to it as our point of departure.&quot; Other scholars, such as John Dominic Crossan, affirms the confluence of Hellenistic and Judaic cultures in 1st-century Galilee as a potential source for the similarities between Christ and the Cynic philosophers-peasants of antiquity. Crossan and Marcus Borg also agree with Mack&#x27;s view that the original teachings of Jesus of Nazareth were non-eschatological.

Mack follows the lead of Kloppenborg in reconstructing Q in layers, focusing on Q communities. This sort of reconstruction has been criticised by a number of scholars such as Maurice Casey. On Jesus as a Cynic, Casey states that &quot;When all the evidence is taken into account, supposed parallels of this kind show that Jesus was quite different from a Cynic philosopher, not that he was like one.&quot; Leif E. Vaage of Emmanuel College notes the similarities between the Q document and the texts of the Cynics, namely the Cynic epistles, which contains the wisdom and ethical anecdotes used by Cynic preachers and illustrates their ascetic way of life focused on purity.

<doc id="71052" wikidata="Q109284" url="?curid=71052" title="Beaver County, Utah">
<text>Beaver County is a county in west central Utah, United States. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 7,072, up from the 2010 figure of 6,629. Its county seat and largest city is Beaver. The county was named for the abundance of beaver in the area.

==History==
Explorers of European descent first visited present-day Beaver County in the 1776 Domínguez-Escalante Expedition. The proposed territory of Deseret (soon changed to Utah Territory) began with the arrival of Mormon pioneers in 1847. After the immediate Great Salt Lake City area was settled, settlers moved into more outlying areas, including the future Beaver County area. The county was created by the Utah territorial legislature from a section of Iron County on January 5, 1856, before the settlement of Beaver town was founded later that year. The county was named for the animal, which was plentiful there. The county boundary as delineated by that act included areas in present-day Colorado and Nevada. The defined boundary was altered on January 16, 1861, by the creation of two counties in present Nevada. The county area was effectively reduced on February 28, 1861, by the US Congress when it created Colorado Territory, taking all of the Beaver County areas east of 109 degrees longitude. The county&#x27;s boundary was enlarged on January 17, 1861, by the addition of parcels from Millard, Sanpete, and St. Mary&#x27;s counties. However, its west area was reduced by the creation of the Nevada Territory on July 14, 1862 (this adjustment was altered on May 5, 1866, by the action of the US Congress, effectively ceding all Beaver County area west of 114 degrees longitude to Nevada counties). The county area was also reduced on January 16, 1865, when Piute County was created from Beaver territory.

A quarter of the county&#x27;s workers are employed by hog processor Smithfield Foods.

==Geography==

Beaver County lies on the west side of Utah. Its west border abuts the east border of the state of Nevada. The west part of the county consists of low rolling hills punctuated by isolated mountains. The east edge of the county runs to the crest of a north–south-running mountain ridge. The terrain slopes to the west and north; its highest point is a mountain crest on its east border, at ASL. The county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.08%) is water.

The Tushar Mountains lies on the eastern boundary of the county, reaching to in elevation and providing water for the farming communities of Beaver and Manderfield. To the west, barren desert valleys typify the scenery, separated by mountains lightly forested with junipers.

<text>Duchesne County ( ) is a county in the northeast part of the U.S. state of Utah. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 19,596. Its county seat is Duchesne, and the largest city is Roosevelt.

==History==
Much of Duchesne County was part of the Uintah Reservation, created 1861 by US President Abraham Lincoln as a permanent home of the Uintah and White River Utes. Later the Uncompahgre Utes were moved to the Uintah and newly created Uncompahgre Indian reservations from western Colorado. At the turn of the century, under the Dawes Act, both Indian reservations were thrown open to homesteaders. This was done after allotments of land were made to Indians of the three tribes. The homesteading process was opened on the Uintah on August 27, 1905.

Unlike much of the rest of Utah Territory, settlement of the future Duchesne County area did not occur due to LDS Church pressures. It was settled by individuals who obtained 160 acres under the federal Homestead Act. Homesteaders were required to prove that they intended to farm the land. After five years of living on the land, making improvements, and paying $1.25 per acre, homesteaders were given title to their homesteads.

On July 13, 1914, a referendum was presented to voters of Wasatch County to partition the eastern part into a separate county. The referendum passed, so Utah Governor William Spry proclaimed on January 4, 1915. The county seat was decided by county vote on November 5, 1914, election. The new county was named for its county seat, which in turn was called for the Duchesne River, which flows southward and then eastward through the central part of the county near the city. Its name is of uncertain origin, but the holding theory is that fur trappers named it in the 1820s in honor of Mother Rose Philippine Duchesne, founder of the School of the Sacred Heart near St. Louis, Missouri, although other theories as to the name exist. The county boundary with Uintah County was adjusted by legislative act on March 5, 1917; Duchesne County boundaries have remained in their current configuration since that date.

==Geography==
Duchesne County&#x27;s terrain is semi-arid, rough, and scarred with drainages. The Duchesne River drains the central part of the county. The county generally slopes to the south and east. The county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.5%) is water. The northern part of the county contains much of the east–west oriented Uinta Mountains. The highest natural point in Utah, Kings Peak at , is located in Duchesne County.

<text>Emery County is a county in east-central Utah, United States. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 9,825. Its county seat is Castle Dale, and the largest city is Huntington.

==History==
===Prehistory===

Occupation of the San Rafael region dates back thousands of years to include people of the Desert Archaic Culture who were followed by those of the Fremont culture who inhabited present-day Emery County through the sixth through thirteenth centuries AD. Evidence of these civilizations is extant in numerous pictograph and petroglyph panels, such as those in Temple Mountain Wash, Muddy Creek, Ferron Box, Black Dragon Canyon, and Buckhorn Wash - all sites listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Indigenous Ute people also occupied sites in Castle Valley.

===Old Spanish Trail===
The first non-indigenous persons to view Castle Valley were Spanish Traders and Explorers. The first of record was Silvestre Vélez de Escalante; in 1776, he crossed northern Utah through the Uintah Basin. Spanish traders and explorers soon found a more southerly route, and their path became known as the Old Spanish Trail. It began at Santa Fe, to Durango, Colorado, crossed the Colorado River (then known as Grand River) near present-day Moab, then to the Green River-crossing where Green River is now located, thence westerly to Cedar Mountain. It went on the South side of Cedar Mountain, across Buckhorn Flat, passed the Red Seeps to Huntington Creek, crossing about a mile below where the present bridge crosses; thence to Cottonwood Creek. It crossed the Ferron Creek where Molen now stands. It passed through the Rochester Flats about east of present-day Moore and crossed the Muddy Creek about due east of the present town of Emery. 
It then went over Salina (Salt Creek) Canyon. It then turned south and went through Parowan, Mountain Meadows, Las Vegas Nevada, Barstow California, and to the coast. This Trail had to traverse Castle Valley to skirt the steep-walled canyons of the San Juan, Colorado, Green, Dirty Devil, and San Rafael Rivers.

Slavery was the principal trade between Santa Fe and the Utah region. The trading of Indian women and children to the Spanish, although illegal, was the purpose of the Spanish coming into the area to become Utah. The other use of the trail was to herd livestock, mostly horses, from California to Santa Fe. Since the slave trade was illegal, the traders kept neither records of their activities nor the extent of their travels and explorations. Travelers along the Old Spanish Trail gave Castle Valley its names, as the travelers marveled at the imposing rock formations.

===Early explorers===
The first Americans to come to Castle Valley were fur trappers, including the &quot;lost trappers&quot;, James Workman and William Spencer, who had been separated from their trapping party by Comanche Indians and had wandered to the Moab crossing of the Colorado River hoping that they would find Santa Fe. They met a Spanish caravan of forty or fifty people going to California. They joined the caravan and traveled through Castle Valley in 1809 and went on to California. In 1830, William Wilfskill came to Castle Valley along the Spanish Trail. He and his party were fur trappers but found little in the area to keep them here.

Following the trappers in the late 1840s and early 1850s, government explorers came to the valley seeking usable overland routes across the continent. Kit Carson was the first of these famous men. He was looking for a direct route for the mail to be carried overland from St. Louis to California. Carson carried through Castle Valley to the nation the news of gold being found in the Sierra Nevada in 1848.
In 1853 John W. Gunnison, an Army Topographical Engineer came through Castle Valley, plotting a railroad route. He was commissioned for this assignment by the US Secretary of War Jefferson Davis. He left detailed descriptions of his travels and carefully laid out his route through Castle Valley. Gunnison&#x27;s route first met the Spanish Trail at the Green River crossing. He followed this trail for a short distance west of the Green River, but when the Spanish Trail entered a rugged rocky region (Sinbad Reef) he charted a route around this feature.

The third government explorer was John C. Fremont, in the winter of 1853–54. The cold weather heavily impacted his trip. They suffered from a lack of food and from the inhospitable landscape. There was no relief from their difficulties until they left Castle Valley and made their way to the small Mormon settlement of Parowan.

===Arrival of pioneers===
In 1875 livestock growers from Sanpete County brought cattle and sheep into Castle Valley to graze, and several recognized the settlement potential of the region. With a shortage of sufficient land and water in Sanpete County and a strong desire by LDS Church leaders to acquire unoccupied land in the region before non-Mormons did, young families began moving into Castle Valley in the fall of 1877 to homestead in the future sites of Huntington, Ferron, Castle Dale, and Orangeville.

In late August 1877, Brigham Young, president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), issued an order to the Sanpete LDS Stake president seeking &quot;... at least fifty families [to] locate in Castle Valley this fall.&quot; The order led to the last Mormon colony settled under the direction of Brigham Young. One week later on August 29, Young, the Great Colonizer, died. During his 30 years as leader of the LDS Church, Young had overseen and directed the establishment of almost 400 towns and villages. The settlement of Emery County was his last.

Soon after the issuance of Young&#x27;s order, several bands of settlers moved out from the Sanpete region and headed for Castle Valley (Emery County). They settled along Huntington Creek, Cottonwood Creek, and Ferron Creek. The following spring (1878), several more families arrived. In the spring of 1878, Elias Cox and Charles Hollingshead set up a sawmill in Huntington Canyon to support the colony. On Ferron Creek, settlers plowed lands and began the construction of a ditch for irrigation. Most early settlers in Castle Valley claimed easily watered bottom lands along the creeks and rivers, and by 1879, most of the best lands had been taken up.

The Utah Territorial Legislature created Emery County on February 12, 1880. The description included the future Carbon County area. It was named for George W. Emery, the Utah Territory governor whose term was ending as the act was being debated. The 1880 census showed 556 people and 84 farms in Emery County, but this figure is likely short as many prominent settlers were inadvertently left off the county rolls. By 1890, the population of Emery County had risen to 2,866. Between 1880 and 1900, many significant canals were constructed, including the Huntington Canal (1884), Emery Canal (1885), Cleveland Canal (1885), and the Wakefield Ditch (1880). Many of the early canals are still in service. The county boundaries were altered in 1880 and 1890. In 1894 the north portion of the county was partitioned off to create Carbon County. The county boundaries remained intact after that, except for a small adjustment in the city of Green River in 2003.

In the early 1880s, the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad contemplated possible routings through the Emery County region. Early plans to locate the railroad through the heart of Emery County were thwarted when the route over the Wasatch Range was too steep. The route was moved to the NE part of the county, bypassing most settlements. Most of the county thus missed on economic opportunities brought by the railroad, but Green River, on the east county border, quickly boomed after the rails arrived.

===Twentieth century===

Emery County population passed 4,600 by 1900, with 450+ farms and under cultivation. Irrigation systems were being expanded to bring new lands into production, bringing problems that would plague the region for several decades. Water rights conflicts frequently arose, and water theft, known as &quot;midnight irrigation,&quot; became common. Most disputes were settled by decree, but a few were contested by violence.

The underlying soils in Emery County consist of ancient seabeds which contain high levels of salts. Poor drainage and over-irrigation cause the salts to collect on the surface, rendering large land areas unsuitable for agriculture. The problem first appeared in the 1890s, and in 1903, a Department of Agriculture report stated that over 30% of the developed farmland in Emery County had been abandoned due to degradation.

With expanded irrigation development came expanded settlement as several new towns were established. In addition, the coal industry, which had consisted of small mines to cover local demand, had significantly expanded, with several large-scale operations starting in the county. The US entry into The Great War created a minor boom in Emery County as agricultural prices rose and manpower shortages caused wages at the mines to rise. Following the war, prices dropped significantly, leading to hard times throughout much of the 1920s. Things improved somewhat during the later years of the decade, but an even more significant collapse came with the onset of the Great Depression in the early 1930s. In addition, severe drought in 1931 and 1934 intensified the economic hardship in the county.
The 1930s were difficult for Emery County residents. The county population dropped by 5% from 1920 to 1930, although it remained somewhat steady after that. Agricultural prices dropped 40% from their 1929 level, and coal production dropped by half. Water shortages and land degradation continued to be problems. In 1935, only out of produced crops.

The residents did benefit from several depression-relief programs, including the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), which established several CCC camps in the county. Company 959 established a camp in Joes Valley in May 1933. The camp moved several times in the following years before establishing a permanent camp near Ferron in 1935. A second camp was established at Castle Dale in 1935, and another camp was established at Green River in 1938. During its tenure in Emery County, the CCC built roads, bridges, and trails, as well as building ranger stations and other projects on public lands. Many enrollees settled in Emery County after their discharge from the Corps.

Following the end of World War II, Emery County veterans returned to find relative economic prosperity. County farm income in 1946 was double that of 1940, and the coal mines were operating at fairly high levels. During the post-war years, the county matured and modernized as modern water and sanitation systems were constructed, roads were improved, and many of the luxuries enjoyed by people in less rural areas, like telephones, reached Emery County. While many things in Emery County improved, some things did not. The agricultural sector still suffered from inconsistent water supplies and a lack of significant long-term water storage. And in the mid-1950s, the region again experienced near-drought conditions. It was during this period that a water reservoir in Joes Valley was completed.

Riding the crest of national economic growth during the 1970s, Emery County&#x27;s population grew significantly as a result of the construction of large coal-fired power plants in Castle Dale and Huntington by Utah Power &amp; Light Company (PacifiCorp) and the expansion of coal mines to fuel them.

===Recent===
On August 6, 2007, at 2:48 A.M., UtahAmerican Energy&#x27;s Crandall Canyon Mine, west north-west of Huntington collapsed, trapping 6 workers inside. The mine, located just off State Route 31, is about southeast of Fairview, and south of Salt Lake City (). The workers were approximately from the mine entrance and underground. The collapse registered recorded seismic waves in magnitude 3.9 to 4.0, by seismograph stations of the University of Utah. 
Emery County, the state&#x27;s No. 2 coal-producing county, was also the site of a fire that killed 27 people in the Wilberg Mine in December 1984.

==Geography==
The Green River flows southward along the east side of the county. The Price River flows southeastward through the northeastern corner of the county to its discharge point into the Green on the county&#x27;s eastern border. The San Rafael River rises in the northwestern part of the county and cuts its way across the county&#x27;s central areas before discharging into the Green, several miles south of the city of Green River. The county terrain is rough flat areas broken by mountain ranges and ridges and carved by water erosion, generally sloping to the south and east. The county&#x27;s highest point is ASL, in the Central Utah Plateaus on the county&#x27;s main north border. The county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.2%) is water. The Wasatch Plateau, a mountainous area, sits along the western boundary. The main population of the county lives along the base of these mountains. The San Rafael Swell occupies most of the area to the east.

The western side of the county is the most populated and contains numerous small communities residing in an agricultural valley that roughly parallels the Manti National Forest to the west. Streams originate in the Wasatch Plateau in the forest, and their headwaters are stored in several reservoirs. Agricultural areas depend on these reservoirs and waterways for survival, and some farmland communities struggle with excess salinity. The east side of the county is dry with rough terrain. Green River, the largest community on this side of the county, is more closely tied to the communities and economy of Grand County. Emery County&#x27;s maps show the importance of the forest lands to the local communities as there are few significant groundwater aquifers in the area.

Emery County contains three areas: the mountainous Wasatch Plateau to the west; Castle Valley, where the major settlements are located; and the desert of the San Rafael Swell, the San Rafael Reef, Cedar Mountain, and the remote stretches on the east.

The San Rafael River, the lifeblood of the county, originates in the Wasatch Plateau, where the headwaters are stored in several reservoirs for agricultural and industrial use. It flows into Castle Valley in three branches—Huntington Creek, Cottonwood Creek, and Ferron Creek—which unite to form the San Rafael River after they pass the communities and adjacent farmland. It then twists its way through the rock and desert to its junction with the Green River.

Geographical names feature Native American, Spanish and English influences. Two Ute Indian names: Wasatch, a gap in the mountains; Quitchupah, a place where animals fare poorly. Wasatch is the name of the plateau between the Sanpete Valley and the Castle Valley. Quitchupah is a small creek south of Emery. The Spanish name is still used in San Rafael, which means Saint Ralph. During Spanish times, the name Rafael was also given to the present Ferron Creek. In 1873, A.D. Ferron, the surveyor sent by Washington to perform cadastral surveys of eastern Utah, named this creek, but before this time, it was the Rafael. The Ute Indians called it the Cabulla, which refers to the small edible part of cactus pear. Huntington Creek was originally called San Marcus; Ute Indians called it Sivareeche, and the Spanish called it Mateo. The Indians called Castle Valley Tompin-con-tu or rock house land, which relates to the present Castle Valley. The Spanish named the valley St. Joseph&#x27;s Valley.

===Archaeology===
Range Creek rises in Emery County and has recently been shown to have pristine remains of the Fremont culture. The State of Utah owns the site and is currently identifying the remains and developing a long-term conservation plan.

==Economy==

Livestock and farming were the mainstays of Emery County&#x27;s economy for much of its history. The opening of large coal mines and the construction of large power plants in Castle Dale and Huntington in the 1970s changed the economy, and the population grew sharply. High wages in this sector initially created high average incomes, but depressed markets for coal and coalbed methane, along with improvements in mining technology, have slowed or postponed this sector for some time.

As a result, unemployment has remained higher than that of the State since 1990. The County still contains extensive natural resources that could be tapped, but the jobs produced from new mining activity may be at a similar level as those replaced by technology.

A proposed nuclear power plant, the Blue Castle Project, is set to begin construction near Green River in 2023.

<text>Garfield County is a county in south central Utah, United States. As of the 2020 United States census the population was 5,083, making it the fifth-least populous county in Utah; with about one inhabitant per square mile, it is also the least densely populated county in Utah. Its county seat and largest city is Panguitch.

==History==
The Utah Territory legislature created the county on March 9, 1882, with areas partitioned from Iron County. It was named for James A. Garfield, the twentieth President of the United States, who had died six months earlier. The border with Iron County was adjusted in 1884, and Garfield County&#x27;s boundaries have remained intact since then.

==Geography==
The Colorado River, flowing southwestward through a deep gorge, forms the eastern boundary. The Dirty Devil River flows southward through the east end of the county to discharge into Colorado at the county&#x27;s border. Westward, the cliffs of tributary canyons give way to the barren stretches of the San Rafael Desert, beyond which a variety of mountains, plateaus, and canyons make up the terrain. Most of Bryce Canyon National Park lies in the southwestern part of the county, and the northern half of the Grand Staircase–Escalante National Monument occupies the middle of the county. A large portion of Capitol Reef National Park lies in the east-central part of the county. A very small part of Canyonlands National Park lies in the northeast corner of the county. The terrain of Garfield County is arid, rough, and carved with erosion. The county terrain generally slopes to the south and to the east. The county&#x27;s highest point is Mount Ellen, in the Henry Mountains, near the county&#x27;s north border, at ASL. The county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.6%) is water. It is the fifth-largest county in Utah by area, and is about the same size as the state of Connecticut.

<text>Catalan cuisine is the cooking traditions and practices from Catalonia. It may also refer to the shared cuisine of Northern Catalonia and Andorra, the second of which has a similar cuisine to that of the neighbouring Alt Urgell and Cerdanya &quot;comarques&quot; and which is often referred to as &quot;Catalan mountain cuisine&quot;. It is considered a part of western Mediterranean cuisine.

==History==

There are several Catalan language cookbooks from the Middle Ages that are known to modern scholars. The &quot;Llibre del Coch&quot; (1520) was one of the most influential cookbooks of Renaissance Spain. It includes several sauce recipes made with ingredients such as ginger, mace powder (&#x27;), cinnamon, saffron, cloves (&#x27;), wine and honey. &quot;Salsa de pagó&quot; took its name from the peacock () that it was intended to be served with, but could accompany any type of poultry, and was part of the medieval Christmas meal. &#x27; (or &#x27; as it&#x27;s called in the &quot;Cuoco Napoletano&quot;) was half-roasted (&#x27;) poultry that was finished in a &quot;salsa&quot; thickened with egg yolks, toasted almonds and breadcrumbs. In the version of the recipe from the 14th-century &#x27;, the sauce is thickened with mashed poultry liver instead of egg yolks.

Hippocras (&#x27;) was spiced wine made with cinnamon, cloves, ginger, pepper, honey and wine pressed through a &#x27;, a pastry bag shaped cloth that was originally designed by Hippocrates to filter water.

The 17th century manuscript &quot;El llibre de la Cuina de Scala-Dei&quot;, written at the Cartoixa d&#x27;Escaladei, contains austere recipes such as of porridges of cereals that go back to Roman times.

==Basic ingredients==
Catalan cuisine relies heavily on ingredients popular along the Mediterranean coast, including fresh vegetables (especially tomato, garlic, eggplant (aubergine), capsicum, and artichoke), wheat products (bread, pasta), Arbequina olive oils, wines, legumes (beans, chickpeas), mushrooms (particularly wild mushrooms), nuts (pine nuts, hazelnuts and almonds), all sorts of pork preparations (sausage from Vic, ham), sheep and goats&#x27; cheese, poultry, lamb, many types of fish like sardine, anchovy, tuna, and cod and other seafood like prawns, squid, sea snails and sea urchins.

Traditional Catalan cuisine is quite diverse, ranging from pork-intensive dishes cooked in the inland part of the region (Catalonia is one of the main producers of swine products in Spain) to fish-based recipes along the coast. These meat and seafood elements are frequently fused together in the Catalan version of surf and turf, known as &quot;mar i muntanya&quot;. Examples include chicken with lobster (&quot;pollastre amb llagosta&quot;), chicken with crayfish (&quot;pollastre amb escarmalans&quot;), rice with meat and seafood (&quot;arròs mar i muntanya&quot;) and cuttlefish with meatballs (&quot;sipia amb mandonguilles&quot;).

The cuisine includes many preparations that mix sweet and savoury and stews with sauces based upon &quot;botifarra&quot; (pork sausage) and the characteristic &quot;picada&quot; (ground almonds, hazelnuts, pine nuts, etc. sometimes with garlic, herbs, biscuits).

==Savoury dishes==
* Catalan-style cod (with raisins and pine nuts)
* &quot;Escalivada&quot; (various grilled vegetables)
* &quot;Escudella&quot; (a stew, it may be served as soup with pasta and minced meats and vegetables, or as the soup first and then the rest)
* &quot;Ollada&quot; (meat and vegetable stew)
* &quot;Esqueixada&quot; (salted cod salad with tomato and onion)
* &quot;Mongetes amb botifarra&quot; (beans and pork sausage)
* &quot;Pa amb tomàquet&quot; (bread smeared with tomato and oil, and sometimes garlic)
* &quot;Tonyina en escabetx&quot; (tuna escabeche)
* &quot;&quot; (a seafood casserole)
* Savoury &quot;coca&quot;
* &quot;&quot; (&quot;Sea and Mountain&quot;) dishes, which combine meat and seafood
* &quot;Embotits&quot;, a generic name for different kinds of cured pork meat, including fuet (a characteristic type of dried sausage), &quot;salchichón&quot; or &quot;llonganissa&quot; (salami) and different kinds of cold cut botifarra.
* &quot;Calçot&quot; (specially cultivated onion, grilled and served as a &quot;Calçotada&quot;)
* &quot;Caragols a la llauna&quot; (cooked snails)
* &quot;Sonsos&quot; (&quot;Gymnammodytes cicerelus&quot;, also known as Mediterranean sand eel, &quot;sonso&quot; in Catalan, and &quot;barrinaire&quot; or &quot;enfú&quot; in Menorca, is a fish in the family Ammodytidae. It is the only species of this family in the Mediterranean Sea.)

==Sauces and condiments==

* &quot;Allioli&quot;, a thick sauce made of garlic and olive oil, used with grilled meats or vegetables, and some dishes. Allioli means garlic () and () oil () in Catalan.
* &quot;Samfaina&quot;, also called &#x27; or &#x27;. It is a variety of Occitan ratatouille or Spanish pisto.
* &quot;Romesco&quot; or &quot;Salvitxada&quot; (made from almonds, hazelnuts, garlic, bread, vinegar, tomatoes, olive oil and dried red peppers) from Valls.
* &quot;Xató&quot;, a variety of &quot;Salvitxada&quot; without tomatoes.

==Sweets and desserts==

* &quot;Crema catalana&quot;, the famous yellow cream made with egg yolk, milk and sugar, whose denseness is between a &quot;crème pâtissière&quot; or &quot;natillas&quot; and a flan; used to stuff a great amount of pastries, or to make simple desserts with, for example, fruit, and that is also eaten in a small flat pottery plate, after covering the cream with white crystal sugar and burning it, in order to create a layer of solid sugar that has to be broken with a small spoon before reaching the cream.
* &quot;Mató de Pedralbes&quot; or &quot;mató de monja&quot; is another kind of Catalan cream, similar to &quot;crema catalana&quot;, originating in Barcelona.
* &quot;Menjablanc&quot; or &quot;menjar blanc&quot;, typical of Reus but eaten all over Catalonia, is a kind of white cream made with almonds, from which a sort of milk is first obtained, followed by a cream to be eaten with a small spoon.
* &quot;&quot; is a typical dessert originated in Lleida composed of peeled pears cooked in a kind of lighter &quot;crema catalana&quot; and served cold, covered by meringue and decorated with cherries.
* &quot;Xuixos&quot; are fried pastries created in Girona and stuffed with &quot;crema catalana&quot;.
* &quot;Mel i mató&quot;, a dessert of &quot;mató&quot; cheese with honey.
* &quot;Pastissets&quot;, or &quot;casquetes&quot;, &quot;de cabell d&#x27;àngel&quot; are sweet half-circle shaped pastries stuffed with cabell d&#x27;àngel (a sort of marrow jam) and covered with white crystal sugar which are eaten at coffee time.
* &quot;Carquinyolis&quot; are little crunchy almond biscuits often eaten at coffee time.
* &quot;Catànies&quot; are Catalan &quot; marcona&quot; almonds covered with white chocolate and powdered black chocolate to be eaten with coffee.
* &quot;&quot; are small nipple-shaped and -sized biscuits also eaten at coffee time. At first they were called &quot;pits de monja&quot; (nuns&#x27; nipples) but time has changed their name to the current &quot;pets de monja&quot; (nuns&#x27; farts).
* Sweet &quot;coques&quot; were at first eaten only on holidays. Catalans have at least one type of traditional &quot;coca&quot; for each holiday and feast day of the year.
* &quot;&quot; are thin fried pastries covered with sugar and eaten during Carnival. They also exist in nearby regions in Spain or France.
* Sweet &quot;bunyols&quot; as &quot;bunyols de vent&quot;, &quot;bunyols&quot; stuffed with &quot;crema catalana&quot; or &quot;bunyols de l&#x27;Empordà&quot; are typically done and eaten on Wednesdays and Fridays during Lent.
* &quot;Mona de Pasqua&quot; is a pastry richly covered with almonds, yolk jam, chocolate eggs (or, currently, large chocolate sculptures) and coloured decoration that the godfather and godmother give as a present every year to their godchildren on Easter (&quot;Pasqua&quot;). It is an ancient pre-Christian tradition which marked the passage from childhood to the adult world. At first, it has one egg for each year of the children&#x27;s age, and continuing to add one egg each year until twelve, as at thirteen they are no longer considered children.
* &quot;Panellets&quot; are small pastries made of pine nuts, almonds and sugar with different shapes and flavors, eaten during la &quot;Castanyada&quot;, which Catalans celebrate on 1 November instead of Halloween. Their origin is Jewish, before the Middle Ages, but the tradition of &quot;castanyada&quot; is much older.
* &quot;Tortell&quot;, also called &quot;torta&quot; or &quot;roscó&quot; in Northern and Southern dialects. It is round, it can be made of puff pastry or a mixture similar to &quot;lionesas&quot; and &quot;palos&quot;, and stuffed with &quot;trufa&quot; (a mixture of cacao, chocolate and cream) or with &quot;crema catalana&quot;. It is typically bought and eaten after Sunday&#x27;s lunch, in family or with friends. A common alternative is called the &quot;braç de gitano&quot; (Gypsy&#x27;s arm), that in Catalonia is always covered with yolk jam.
* A specific &quot;tortell&quot; is in fact a special &quot;coca&quot; that Catalans only eat on the Day of the Three Kings (6 January) which is called &quot;tortell de reis&quot; (or &quot;galeta de reis&quot; in Northern Catalonia) a typical ring-shaped pastry stuffed with marzipan or Catalan cream (&quot;crema catalana&quot;) and topped with glazed fruit and nuts.
* &quot;Torró&quot;, a Christmas sweet made with almonds with DAO of Agramunt (Lleida).
* &quot;Neules&quot; are also eaten on Christmas in Catalonia. They are dipped in &quot;cava&quot; (Catalan champagne). They have the same origin as waffles and Belgian &quot;Goffres&quot;.

==Wines==

There are 11 Catalan wine-growing regions qualified by the INCAVI (The Catalan Institute of Wine): Priorat, Penedès, Catalunya, Costers del Segre, Conca de Barberà, Montsant, Alella, Tarragona, Empordà, Pla del Bages and Terra Alta.

The sparkling wine cava, made mainly in the Penedès and Anoia regions, is the Catalan equivalent to champagne. It is widely exported.

&quot;Moscatell&quot; (Empordà), is a sweet Catalan wine which have similar varieties in other countries such as France, Italy, Portugal, Albania, Slovenia, Greece, Romania and Turkey, as well as other regions of Spain. However, Catalan &quot;moscatell&quot; is thicker than French&quot; muscat&quot; and is not drunk before the meal (&quot;aperitiu&quot;) but after it, either with or after dessert.

==Alternative views==
Some Catalan authors, such as Josep Pla, Jaume Fàbrega or Eliana Thibaut i Comalada, and others like Colman Andrews, have suggested that, besides Catalonia proper, this cuisine takes in the Balearic and Valencian cuisines, but this opinion is challenged as politicised, and is not widespread, nor is it supported by either the Balearic or the Valencian government, while the Catalan government itself provides divergent points of view. In any case, mutual ties do exist between Catalan gastronomy and other western Mediterranean gastronomies, such as Balearic cuisine, Valencian cuisine, Southern French cuisine, Aragonese cuisine or Murcian cuisine.

==Chefs and restaurants==

Catalan cooks and chefs are widely renowned and critically acclaimed all over the world. Three of The World&#x27;s 50 Best Restaurants are in Catalonia, and four restaurants have three Michelin stars. The Michelin Guide Spain and Portugal 2022 edition awarded 49 restaurants across Catalonia with a total of 64 Michelin stars. Barcelona has 28 Michelin stars across 18 restaurants including Cinc Sentits and has been chosen as the best gastronomical city by the American TV network MSNBC in 2009, topping the list of the ten best gastronomical cities in the world.
In Province of Girona are two of the best restaurants of the world, El Celler de Can Roca, the best of the world in 2014 and 2015, and elBulli, in Roses, the best one in 2002, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2nd in 2010, before its closure in 2011.

<text>Grand County is a county on the east central edge of the U.S. state of Utah, United States. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 9,669. Its county seat and largest city is Moab.

Grand County is home to one of the nine statewide regional campuses of Utah State University (located in the city of Moab) and serves as a gateway to both Arches and Canyonlands National Parks.

==History==
Evidence of indigenous occupation up to 10,000 BCE has been previously discovered in Grand County. The present city of Moab is the site of pueblo farming communities of the 11th and 12th centuries. These groups had already vanished from the area when the first European explorers entered the country, with nomadic Ute tribes inhabiting the area at the time of contact.

The European-based settlement of the area began with the arrival of Mormon pioneers in 1847. By 1855 they had sent missionary settlers into eastern Utah Territory. An Elk Mountain Mission was established but closed after a few months due to Indian raids. For several decades after that, the future Moab area (known as &quot;Spanish Valley&quot;) was visited only by trappers and prospectors. Permanent settlement began in 1877. These early settlers, coming in from the north, encountered the deep canyon walls of the Grand River and could not take wagons over or around the steep canyon walls.

They unloaded their supplies, dismantled the wagons, and lowered them by rope to the river valley. They then drove their oxen over a canyon rim, down deep sand dunes. After the wagons were reassembled and supplies reloaded, they made their way through the deep sand to the river. They found a place to ford the river below the present bridge in north Moab. They later established a ferry at the crossing site, which remained in use until the first bridge was built in 1921.

In 1881 the area was known as Grand Valley, and Moab was a &quot;wild west&quot; town. A 1991 visitor to Moab later said it was the toughest town in Utah because the area and surrounding country have many deep canyons, rivers, mountains, and wilderness areas, becoming a hideout for outlaws. The local economy was initially based on farming and livestock. Mining came in at the end of the 19th century, and the railroad arrived. The first school in the county was started in 1881. Mormon settlers began planting fruit trees by 1879, and by 1910 Moab was a significant fruit-production center.

Due to the distances involved, the settlers of eastern Emery County found it difficult to conduct county business in that county&#x27;s seat. By March 13, 1890, their petitions caused the Utah Territory legislature to designate the eastern portion of the county as a separate entity, to be named Grand County, named for the Grand River (whose name was changed to Colorado River in 1921). The county boundaries were adjusted in 1892 and in 2003.

Exploration for deep petroleum deposits began in the 1920s, and this industry has significantly contributed to the economy since that time. Other significant industries include uranium mining and filmmaking.
==Geography==
Grand County lies on the east side of Utah. Its east border abuts the west border of the state of Colorado. The Green River flows southward through the eastern part of central Utah, and its meandering course defines the western border of Grand County. The Colorado River enters the east side of Grand County from Colorado, flowing southwestward toward its confluence with the Green in San Juan County, south of Grand. The Dolores River also enters Grand County from Colorado, flowing westward to its confluence with the Colorado River near Dewey.

Grand County terrain is arid, rough, and spectacularly carved by water and wind erosion, exposing red rock formations that have created a solid tourist industry. The area is little used for agriculture unless irrigation is available. The terrain is filled with hills and protuberances, but generally slopes to the south and to the west. Its highest point is Mount Waas in the SE part of the county, at ASL. The county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.3%) is water. Deserts, cliffs and plateaus make up the scenery, with few settlements apart from the city of Moab, a Colorado River oasis. Arches National Park lies in the southern part of the county, just north of Moab. A northern portion of Canyonlands National Park lies in the southwest corner of the county.

According to the 2020 United States census and 2020 American Community Survey, there were 9,669 people in Grand County with a population density of 2.6 people per square mile (1.0/km2). Among non-Hispanic or Latino people, the racial makeup was 7,481 (77.4%) White, 65 (0.7%) African American, 330 (3.4%) Native American, 80 (0.8%) Asian, 11 (0.1%) Pacific Islander, 62 (0.6%) from other races, and 414 (4.3%) from two or more races. 1,226 (12.7%) people were Hispanic or Latino.

The median income for males that were full-time employees was $47,736 and for females $36,180. 14.0% of the population and 11.5% of families were below the poverty line.

In terms of education attainment, out of the 7,137 people in Grand County 25 years or older, 442 (6.2%) had not completed high school, 1,931 (27.1%) had a high school diploma or equivalency, 2,576 (36.1%) had some college or associate degree, 1,233 (17.3%) had a bachelor&#x27;s degree, and 955 (13.4%) had a graduate or professional degree.

Grand County has the lowest percentage of members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) among all Utah counties. About 26% of Grand County residents identify as Latter-day Saints, significantly lower than the 62% of Utah as a whole.

==Politics and government==
Historically, following the period of William Jennings Bryan and Woodrow Wilson, Grand County has generally voted Republican. Between 1920 and 1988 (inclusive), it voted Democratic only four times: thrice for Franklin Roosevelt, and once for Lyndon Johnson. However, it has become a swing county in recent years, voting Democratic four times in the last nine presidential elections (for Bill Clinton in 1992, Barack Obama in 2008, Joe Biden in 2020, and Kamala Harris in 2024). The highest vote share any Republican has received in the county in the last nine elections was 51.1% (by George W. Bush in 2004); Joe Biden&#x27;s 53.9% was the highest vote share for any nominee of either party since 1988, as well as the highest for a Democrat in the county since 1936. In 2024, Kamala Harris became the first Democratic presidential nominee to win Grand County despite losing the presidential election since 1900.

Grand County is one of only thirteen counties to have voted for Obama in 2008, Romney in 2012, Trump in 2016, and Biden in 2020.













Moab has a significant environmentalist population due to nearby Arches National Park and Canyonlands National Park.

===Sagebrush Rebellion===

Grand County was an epicenter of the Sagebrush Rebellion, which took place during the late 1970s and early 1980s when residents protested what they saw as overreaching Federal control of Western US land.

An early event in the Rebellion was July 4, 1980, when 300 Grand County residents gathered behind a flag-decorated bulldozer in protest of the inclusion of Mill Creek Canyon as part of a Bureau of Land Management wilderness study area. Despite plowing nearly 200 yards up the canyon, the group did not reach the study area&#x27;s boundary.

==Paleontology==
The Denver Museum of Natural History opened a small Cedar Mountain Formation quarry that has produced diverse dinosaur fossils including theropod, sauropod and ornithopod. An adult sauropod was designated the type specimen of the genus &quot;Venenosaurus&quot;.

<text>Iron County is a county in southwestern Utah, United States. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 57,289. Its county seat is Parowan, and the largest city is Cedar City. The Cedar City, UT Micropolitan Statistical Area includes all of Iron County.

==History==
Evidence of Fremont culture habitation ranging from 750 to 1250 AD exists in present Iron County. Petroglyphs of differing periods were carved into the walls of Parowan Gap NW of Parowan. Paiutes roamed the Parowan Valley in the centuries before Euro-American exploration; their descendants are now represented by the Southern Paiute Indian Reservation, which is headquartered in Cedar City.

The Domínguez–Escalante expedition traveled through the Iron County area on October 12, 1776. Fur trapper Jedediah Smith is the first recorded Anglo-American to pass through the area (1826). Settlement of the area began in 1851, when LDS President Brigham Young directed members from the northern colonies to move into the area. A settlement, Coal Creek, sprang up in 1851; it later became Cedar City. To provide a local government structure, the State of Deseret legislature created the county on January 31, 1850, although it was not organized until January 17, 1851, with description stretching from the future Colorado, across Utah, and into the future Nevada. It was named &quot;Little Salt Lake County&quot; at creation, but on December 3, 1850, a legislative act changed its name to Iron County. Its borders were altered in 1850, 1852, 1854, 1856, and 1861. Also, in 1861, the federal government created the Colorado Territory, which administratively removed Iron County areas east of 109 degrees longitude.

The county borders were altered in 1862. Also, in 1862, the federal government created the Nevada Territory, which administratively removed Iron County areas west of 114 degrees longitude. Further boundary adjustments were passed in 1866, 1880, 1882, 1883, and 1884. The final adjustment was made in 1892; the county borders have remained in their current arrangement.

==Geography==
Iron County lies on the west edge of Utah. Its west border abuts the east border of the state of Nevada. The Iron County terrain is a study in contrast to its arid western reaches of the Escalante Desert and Great Basin ranges to the meadows and forests of the High Plateau on the east. The Markagunt Plateau is creased by the colorful formations of Cedar Breaks National Monument. Brian Head is the county&#x27;s highest point, at ASL. The county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.1%) is water.

<text>Juab County ( ) is a county in western Utah, United States. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 11,786. Its county seat and largest city is Nephi. Juab County is part of the Provo–Orem, Utah Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Salt Lake City–Provo–Orem, Utah Combined Statistical Area.

==History==
The area of future Juab County was inhabited by nomadic indigenous peoples before the Mormon settlement of Utah beginning in 1847. Soon after, Mormons and others traveling through the area had established a road to California, leading SSW from Great Salt Lake City. It passed Salt Creek, flowing westward through a slough in the Wasatch Mountains. The area around this creek was often used as a stopping or camping spot by travelers, and by 1851 Mormon settlers had begun a settlement in the area. When the Utah Territory legislature created a county (by partitioning territory from Utah County) to oversee the growth and organization of the largely uninhabited and unbearable area, this settlement (called Salt Creek) was the only real settlement worthy of the name, and it was designated as the county seat in a March 3, 1852, legislative act. The new county&#x27;s description included considerable territory falling in present-day Nevada. The county name reportedly derived from a Native American word meaning &quot;thirsty valley&quot;, or possibly only &quot;valley&quot;.

The county&#x27;s boundaries were altered in 1854, 1855, and 1856. Also, in 1856 the Territory legislature, acknowledging the upcoming establishment of Nevada Territory, removed from the boundary description of Juab county all territories west of 114 degrees longitude. Further boundary adjustments were made in 1861, 1862, 1866, 1870, in 1888, and 1913. A small adjustment between Juab and Sanpete counties on March 8, 1919, created the current Juab County configuration.

Early settlers in Salt Creek devoted themselves to agriculture and livestock. However, by 1869 mining of precious metals had begun in the Tintic region. Mining towns, including Diamond, Silver City, and Eureka, appeared. By 1889 it was considered one of the nation&#x27;s most productive mining areas. Mining continued as the dominant economic driver through the mid-twentieth century, then subsided. Salt Creek grew apace, although in 1882 the town name (and US Post Office designation) was changed to &quot;Nephi&quot;.

==Politics and government==
Juab has traditionally voted Republican. In only one national election since 1948 the county selected the Democratic Party candidate.













==Geography==

Juab County lies on the west side of Utah. Its west border abuts the east border of the state of Nevada. Its planar areas consist of rugged, arid semi-arable fine-grain soil, with hills and low mountains. Its eastern border is loosely defined by the ridgeline of an arm of the Wasatch Mountains. The terrain generally slopes to the north, with its highest point on Mount Ibapah, a crest of the East Central Great Basin Range in northwest Juab County. The listed elevation of Mt. Ibapah is ASL. The county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.4%) is water. The county&#x27;s shape bears resemblance to the shape of Massachusetts.

<text>Kane County is a county in the U.S. state of Utah. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 7,667. Its county seat and largest city is Kanab.

==History==
The county was created on January 16, 1864, by the old federal Utah Territory (1850-1896) territorial legislature, with areas partitioned off from earlier Washington County. It was named for Col. Thomas L. Kane (1822-1883), a friend of the Latter Day Saint (Mormons) settlers when they first arrived westward, led by patriarch Brigham Young (1801-1877), in the 1840s and 1850s. The county boundary was readjusted later, first in 1869, when a portion was returned back to Washington County; second in 1880, when San Juan County was partitioned off and created; and third, in 1883, when additional portions were partitioned from Kane and added to Iron and back to Washington counties.

==Geography==
Kane County lies on the south line of the state of Utah. Its south border abuts the northern border of the state of Arizona. The Colorado River, reformed as Lake Powell, forms its eastern border. Grand Staircase–Escalante National Monument covers much of the county. A rugged and inhospitable country of deserts, mountains, and cliffs make up the terrain, with breathtaking scenery in every area. Parts of Bryce Canyon National Park and Zion National Park extend into the northern and western portions of the county. The eastern part of the county is part of the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area. The county has a total area of , of which is land and (2.9%) is water.

==Politics and government==
Kane is one of the most reliably Republican counties in the nation. Of &quot;straight-ticket&quot; voters in the 2008 election, there were 992 Republicans and 326 Democrats. In the Utah gubernatorial election, 2004 nearly 70% of the county&#x27;s vote went for Jon Huntsman, Jr. and in the 2008 election he received around 75% of the vote. Kane County is part of Utah&#x27;s 2nd congressional district and thus was represented by moderate Democrat Jim Matheson for several years until 2013. The second district is now represented by Republican Celeste Maloy.

In Presidential elections, Kane County has only been won once by a Democratic candidate when Woodrow Wilson carried the county in 1916. It was the only county in Utah carried by Alf Landon, the Republican opponent who lost to Franklin Delano Roosevelt in the 1936 Presidential election in the most lopsided Presidential election in over a century. It has solidly favored the Republican candidate since at least 1956, when Dwight D. Eisenhower received approximately 90% of the vote. In 1964, by over thirty-nine percent, the county went for Barry Goldwater, who lost the overall in the state by over nine percent. Since 1920, only in the Democratic landslides of 1936, 1940, and 1964 did the Democratic candidate for president receive even 30% of the county&#x27;s vote.

<text>Millard County ( ) is a county in the U.S. state of Utah. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 12,975. Its county seat is Fillmore, and the largest city is Delta.

==History==
The Utah Territory legislature created the county on October 4, 1851, with territory not previously covered by county creations and including some area in the future state of Nevada. It was named for the thirteenth US President Millard Fillmore, who was in office then. Fillmore was designated as the county seat. The county boundaries were altered in 1852 and again in 1854. On March 2, 1861, the US government created the Nevada Territory, which effectively de-annexed the described portion of Millard County falling in that Territorial Proclamation. The county boundary was further altered in 1862, 1866, 1888, and in 1919. In 1921 a boundary adjustment with Sevier brought Millard to its present configuration.

Fillmore, located near the geographic center of the territory, was originally built as the capital of Utah Territory. The Utah Territorial Legislature approved a plan to locate the capital in the Pahvant Valley. On October 28, 1851, Utah Governor Brigham Young traveled to the valley and chose the specific site for Fillmore. The town was surveyed that same day. A colonizing company soon followed; they built houses, a grist mill, and a sawmill. Construction of the Territorial Statehouse was initiated in 1852. The Territorial legislature met in Fillmore for the first (and only time) in 1855. The following year they voted to keep the capital in Great Salt Lake City.

==Geography==
Millard County lies on the west side of Utah. Its west border abuts the east border of the state of Nevada. The county terrain consists of arid, rough undulating flatlands interrupted by numerous hills and mountain ridges. The highest point in the county is Mine Camp Peak in the Central Utah Plateaus, at ASL. The county has a total area of , of which is land and (3.7%) is water. It is the third-largest county in Utah by area.

The Sevier Desert covers much of Millard County, being the seafloor of ancient Lake Bonneville. Sevier Lake, a mostly dry remnant of Lake Bonneville, is in central Millard County. The Pahvant Mountains form the county&#x27;s eastern boundary. Fillmore and other farming communities lie at the base of the Pahvant Mountains. Delta sits several miles from the banks of the Sevier River in the middle of the basin.

===Great Stone Face===

Pahvant Valley in Millard County has several ancient lava flows and extinct volcanoes, known as the Black Rock Desert volcanic field, including the &quot;Black Rock&quot; lava flow. About southwest of Delta, near Black Rock&#x27;s northwest perimeter is a feature named the &quot;Great Stone Face&quot;, which protrudes about four stories above the general elevation. Locals claim that this rock formation, when viewed at the correct angle, appears similar to a profile of Joseph Smith. At ground level, within view of the &quot;Great Stone Face&quot;, is a large, smooth-faced rock covered in Native American petroglyphs.

===Notch Peak===
Notch Peak is west of Delta. The skyline appears to have a notch taken out of it when viewed from Delta.

===Little Sahara Sand Dunes===
Little Sahara Recreation Area, north of Delta, is a popular area for ATV riders.

<doc id="71064" wikidata="Q2986781" url="?curid=71064" title="Pneumonic plague">
<text>Pneumonic plague is a severe lung infection caused by the bacterium &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot;. Symptoms include fever, headache, shortness of breath, chest pain, and coughing. They typically start about three to seven days after exposure. It is one of three forms of plague, the other two being septicemic plague and bubonic plague.
The pneumonic form may occur following an initial bubonic or septicemic plague infection. It may also result from breathing in airborne droplets from another person or animal infected with pneumonic plague. The difference between the forms of plague is the location of infection; in pneumonic plague the infection is in the lungs, in bubonic plague the lymph nodes, and in septicemic plague within the blood. Diagnosis is by testing the blood, sputum, or fluid from a lymph node.
While vaccines are being developed, in most countries they are not yet commercially available. Prevention is by avoiding contact with infected rodents, people, or cats. It is recommended that those infected be isolated from others. Treatment of pneumonic plague consists of antibiotics.
Plague is present among rodents in Africa, the Americas, and Asia. Pneumonic plague is more serious and less common than bubonic plague. The total reported number of cases of all types of plague in 2013 was 783. Left untreated, pneumonic plague is almost always fatal. Some hypothesize that the pneumonic version of the plague was mainly responsible for the Black Death that resulted in approximately 75 - 200 million deaths in the 1300s.

==Signs and symptoms==
The most apparent symptom of pneumonic plague is coughing, often with hemoptysis (coughing up blood). With pneumonic plague, the first signs of illness are fever, headache, weakness and rapidly developing pneumonia with shortness of breath, chest pain, cough and sometimes bloody or watery sputum.

The pneumonia progresses for two to four days and may cause respiratory failure and shock. Patients will die without early treatment, some within 36 hours.

Initial pneumonic plague symptoms can often include the following:
* Fever
* Weakness
* Headaches
* Nausea

Rapidly developing pneumonia with:
* Shortness of breath
* Chest pain
* Cough
* Bloody or watery sputum (saliva and discharge from respiratory passages).

==Causes==
Pneumonic plague can be caused in two ways: primary, which results from the inhalation of aerosolized plague bacteria, or secondary, when septicemic plague spreads into lung tissue from the bloodstream. Pneumonic plague is &quot;not&quot; exclusively vector-borne like bubonic plague; instead, it can be spread from person to person. There have been cases of pneumonic plague resulting from the dissection or handling of contaminated animal tissue. This is one of the types of plague formerly known as the Black Death.

==Treatment==
Pneumonic plague is a very aggressive infection requiring early treatment, which must be given within 24 hours of first symptoms to reduce the risk of death. Streptomycin, gentamicin, tetracyclines and chloramphenicol are all able to kill the causative bacterium.

Antibiotic treatment for seven days will protect people who have had direct, close contact with infected patients. Wearing a close-fitting surgical mask also protects against infection.

The mortality rate from untreated pneumonic plague approaches 100% although victims of the Black Death who vomited blood occasionally survived such as the chronicler Marcha di Marco Battagli.

==Modern outbreaks==
Since 2002, the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported seven plague outbreaks, though some may go unreported because they often happen in remote areas. Between 1998 and 2009, nearly 24,000 cases have been reported, including about 2,000 deaths, in Africa, Asia, the Americas, and Eastern Europe. Ninety-eight percent of the world&#x27;s cases occur in Africa.

===Democratic Republic of the Congo===
Two outbreaks occurred in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2005 and 2006. The outbreak in 2005 was only detected by looking back at blood samples.
The total death toll was 111.

===India===

In September 1994, India experienced an outbreak of plague that killed 50 and caused travel to New Delhi by air to be suspended until the outbreak was brought under control. The outbreak was feared to be much worse because the plague superficially resembles other common diseases such as influenza and bronchitis; over 200 people that had been quarantined were released when they did not test positive for the plague. All but three of the deaths occurred around the city of Surat.

===China===
A major outbreak of the pneumonic plague occurred in Manchuria from 1910 to 1911, in what became known as the Manchurian plague, killing around 60,000 people. The Qing court dispatched Wu Lien-teh, a doctor educated at Cambridge University, to oversee disease control and treatment efforts. He made the novel observation that the disease was transmitted by air, and developed prototypical respirators to help prevent its spread. A second, less deadly outbreak occurred in 1920–21, killing approximately 9,300 people.

The People&#x27;s Republic of China has eradicated pneumonic plague from most parts of the country, but still reports occasional cases in remote western areas, where the disease is carried by rats and the marmots that live across the Himalayan plateau. Outbreaks can be caused when a person eats an infected marmot or comes into contact with fleas carried by rats. A 2006 WHO report from an international meeting on plague cited a Chinese government disease expert as saying that most cases of the plague in China&#x27;s northwest occur when hunters are contaminated while skinning infected animals.

The expert said at the time that, due to the region&#x27;s remoteness, the disease killed more than half the infected people. The report also said that since the 1990s, there was a rise in plague cases in humans—from fewer than 10 in the 1980s to nearly 100 cases in 1996 and 254 in 2000. In September 2008, two people in East Tibet died of pneumonic plague.

An outbreak of the disease in China began in August 2009 in Ziketan Town located in Qinghai Province. The town was sealed off and several people died as a result of the disease. According to spokesperson Vivian Tan of the WHO office in Beijing, &quot;In cases like this [in August 2009], we encourage the authorities to identify cases, to investigate any suspicious symptoms among close contacts, and to treat confirmed cases as soon as possible. So far, they have done exactly that. There have been sporadic cases reported around the country in the last few years so the authorities do have the experience to deal with this.&quot;

In September 2010, five cases of pneumonic plague were reported in Tibet.

In July 2014, Chinese media reported one case found in Gansu.

On 12 November 2019, It was announced that two people from the Chinese province of Inner Mongolia were diagnosed with pneumonic plague. They received treatment in Chaoyang District, Beijing, and authorities implemented preventative control measures. Later in November, a third case of plague was confirmed. A 55-year-old man was diagnosed with bubonic plague after eating wild rabbit in Inner Mongolia. The region&#x27;s health commission says it has no evidence to suggest that this case is linked to the previous two. By the end of November, a fourth case was confirmed. Chinese health authorities reported a fresh case of bubonic plague in the country&#x27;s northern Inner Mongolia region, bringing the total number of reported plague cases originating from Inner Mongolia to four.

In August 2010, Peru&#x27;s health minister Oscar Ugarte announced that an outbreak of plague had killed a 14-year-old boy and had infected at least 31 people in a northern coastal province. The boy died of bubonic plague on 26 July 2010. Ugarte stated that authorities were screening sugar and fish meal exports from Ascope Province, located about 325 miles (520 km) northwest of Lima, not far from the popular Chicama beach. Most of the infections in Peru were bubonic plague, with four cases of pneumonic plague.

The first recorded plague outbreak in Peru was in 1903. Prior to the above case, the last known outbreak was in 1994, killing 35 people.

===Madagascar===

In November 2013, an outbreak of plague occurred in the African island nation of Madagascar. As of 16 December, at least 89 people were infected, with 39 deaths with at least two cases involving pneumonic plague. However, as many as 90% of cases were later reported to have involved pneumonic plague.

From 23 August to 30 September 2017, a total of 73 suspected, probable, and confirmed cases of pneumonic plague, including 17 deaths, were reported in Madagascar. The diagnosis was confirmed by the Institut Pasteur de Madagascar by a polymerase chain reaction test, while field health workers used a Rapid Diagnostic Test. The WHO and Institut Pasteur de Madagascar were both involved in administering antibiotic compounds and attempting to stop the spread of the disease. By mid-October, there were an estimated 684 confirmed cases of plague with 474 pneumonic, 156 bubonic and one septicemic. The remainder were not classified. At least 74 deaths have been ascribed to pneumonic plague.

The outbreak officially ended on 26 November 2017 with 2,348 cases and 202 deaths officially reported.

===United States===
In the fall of 1924, an outbreak occurred in Los Angeles that killed 30 people.

On 2 November 2007, wildlife biologist Eric York died of pneumonic plague in Grand Canyon National Park. York was exposed to the bacteria while conducting a necropsy on a cougar carcass.

In 2014, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment confirmed that a Colorado man had been diagnosed with pneumonic plague, the first confirmed human case in Colorado in more than 10 years, and one of only 60 cases since 1957. The man was found to have the disease after the family dog died unexpectedly and a necropsy revealed that the disease was the cause. Three additional pneumonic plague cases were confirmed in Colorado before the outbreak ended.

<doc id="71066" wikidata="Q27245" url="?curid=71066" title="Piute County, Utah">
<text>Piute County ( ) is a county in south-central Utah, United States. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 1,438, making it the second-least populous county in Utah. The county seat is Junction, and the largest town is Circleville.

==History==
Paiute County was formed on January 16, 1865, with areas annexed from Beaver County. It was named for the Paiute tribe of Native Americans. Its defined boundaries were altered by adjustments between adjoining counties in 1866, in 1880, in 1892, and in 1931. It has retained its current configuration since 1931.

By the 1860s, mining prospectors were pushing into central and southern Utah Territory, and several mining towns, such as Bullion and Webster, appeared. Mining activity had slowed by the 1900s, but gold mining (from lodes in Tushar Mountains) had produced 240,000 ounces of gold from 1868 through 1959. As the nation entered The Great War, a mine on the east Tushar Mountains producing potash and alumina became a national center of attention, both because of the strategic value of these products, and because of persistent rumors of sabotage attempts and spying. The town of Alunite flourished (1915-1930), then died as the war effort wound down. Today it is abandoned.

==Geography==
The Sevier River flows northward through the west-central part of Piute County, joined at Kingston by the East Branch of the Sevier. Immediately north of Kingston, it is dammed to form Piute Reservoir. Two mountain ridges lie north–south across the county. The eastern ridge runs through the east-central part of the county, and the western ridge (Tushar Mountains) runs along the county&#x27;s west border, its crestline defining the county line. Otter Creek flows southward through the east part of the county; it is dammed to form Otter Creek Reservoir in the SE part of the county. Along the way it is fed by Greenwich Creek and Box Creek, draining the east face of the eastern ridge. The eastern part of the county generally slopes to the south while the west-central part of the county slopes to the north. The county&#x27;s highest point is Delano Peak on the Tushar Range, at ASL. The highest point on the eastern ridge is a crest near the county&#x27;s north border, at ASL. The county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.0%) is water. It is the fifth-smallest county in Utah by total area.

<text>Rich County is a county in the U.S. state of Utah. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 2,510, making it the third-least populous county in Utah. Its county seat is Randolph, and the largest town is Garden City. The county was created in 1864. It was named for an early LDS apostle, Charles C. Rich.

The southern half of Bear Lake and the Bear Lake Valley lies on the northern edge of the county. The Bear River Valley lies in most of the eastern portion of the county. The elevation of these valleys is close to , and the rest of the county is covered by mountains, including the Bear River Range. Because of the high elevation, the climate is cold in winter and mild in summer, and the population is limited.

==History==
Various Native American peoples inhabited the Rich County region for thousands of years. A prehistoric bison jump is located near the city of Woodruff, Utah

Like all of modern-day Utah, Rich County was claimed by the Spanish Empire from the 1500s as part of Alta California, and later was part of Mexico. However, neither the Spanish nor Mexicans had a major or permanent presence in the area. The 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo placed the region under control of the United States. 

Rich County was believed to have first been visited by European-descended explorers in 1811, when trapper Joseph Miller discovered the Bear River. In 1827, the first annual rendezvous of trappers occurred on the south shore of Bear Lake, a tradition that is still marked today. The site is also preserved as part of Bear Lake State Park. The Oregon Trail, a heavily traveled route to the Northwest Territories, passed through the upper part of the future county (as defined by its original description). Many emigrants traveling to the NW Territories also traveled around the south end of Bear Lake instead of hewing to the more heavily traveled route through present-day Idaho, although this adds to the Oregon Trail is usually not shown on maps of the route. 

The Utah Territory had been initially settled by Mormon pioneers beginning in 1847, but no Mormons permanently moved into the Rich County area until after 1862. The US Congress passed the Homestead Act of 1862, opening this area to settlement. Mormon leader Brigham Young, fearing this would lead to an influx of non-Mormons, called members of his flock to move to the area and begin its settlement. The first settlement within the county&#x27;s present boundary was Round Valley in 1863; located southwest of Laketown (settled 1864), it is now a ghost town. Randolph was settled in 1870. Originally created as Richland County on January 16, 1864, the name was shortened to Rich on January 29, 1868, by the 17th Utah Territorial Legislature. The boundary as originally defined extended beyond Utah into southwestern Wyoming and southeast Idaho. However, on July 25, 1868, the Wyoming Territory was created by the federal government, and all of the Rich County area east of the 34th meridian west from Washington became part of the new territory and thus was lost to Rich. The 1870 census for Rich County, Utah Territory enumerates a total of 1,672 residents in the eight Idaho communities of Bennington, Bloomington, Fish Haven, Liberty, Montpelier, Ovid, Paris and St. Charles. Utah Territory adjusted the county&#x27;s boundary on February 16, 1872, by moving a small portion previous Summit County into Rich. The final adjustment to county boundaries was made on January 5, 1875, when Idaho Territory took the eight aforementioned communities and others in the Bear Lake Valley to form Bear Lake County.

The present county building was constructed in Randolph in 1940.

==Geography==
Rich County lies in the upper northeastern corner of Utah. Its northern border abuts the south border of the state of Idaho, and its east border abuts the west border of the state of Wyoming. The Bear River flows eastward out of the middle part of the county into Wyoming. The terrain is rugged, with less than ten percent of the area under cultivation. Over half of the county&#x27;s area is used for cattle grazing. The county terrain slopes from the Bear River Mountain crests which form its western border, toward the east. The highest point is along its northern border known as Bridger Peak, at ASL. The county has a total area of , of which is land and (5.3%) is water.

The Bear River Valley is created by the Bear River and consists of the east-central portion of the county. The towns of Randolph and Woodruff lie in this farming-oriented valley. Its high elevation makes this region one of the coldest areas in the state. Woodruff has a record low of and temperatures rarely exceed during the summer. Snow is heavy in late autumn, winter, and early spring and remains on the ground for the entire winter.

Further to the north lies the southern half of Bear Lake Valley, which contains Bear Lake. This lake is famous for its deep blue water, beaches, and surrounding mountains. The Bear River Mountains lies along the western edge of the county, and Logan Canyon opens up to the west of Garden City, which is a quaint tourist town that lies on the western edge of Bear Lake. Laketown lies at the southern edge of the lake. Three sections of the coastline are protected by Bear Lake State Park. The eastern slopes of the Bear River Range are an increasingly popular location for cabins.

In both major valleys, temperature inversions are a major problem during winter. These temperature inversions can bring extremely cold temperatures, fog, smog, and haze to the valleys, lasting for weeks at a time.

===Major highways===
* U.S. Route 89 descends from the Bear River Mountains through Logan Canyon and turns north at Garden City along the Bear Lake shoreline. 
* State Route 16 heads south from Sage Creek Junction through Randolph and Woodruff before entering Wyoming northwest of Evanston.
* State Route 30 heads south from Garden City through Laketown and climbs east through the mountains to the Wyoming border.
* State Route 39 heads west into the Wasatch Range from Woodruff on its way to Huntsville and eventually Ogden. However, this highway is closed through the mountains during the winter months as heavy snow blocks the road.
* Interstate 80 lies in Summit County near the Rich County border but is only accessible from Rich County through Wyoming.

<text>Morgan County is a county in northern Utah, United States. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 12,295. Its county seat and largest city is Morgan.
Morgan County is part of the Ogden-Clearfield, UT Metropolitan Statistical Area as well as the Salt Lake City-Provo-Orem, UT Combined Statistical Area.

==History==
An early route of the Hastings Cutoff ran through the Morgan Valley and down through a narrow gorge in Weber Canyon. The Donner Party avoided going through the Morgan Valley in order to speed up their journey. However, their alternate route proved more time-consuming.

In 1855, Charles Sreeve Peterson and his family became the first white settlers to take up permanent residence in the Morgan Valley after cutting a road through Weber Canyon. After others began settling in the rather limited planar areas of the mountainous territory, the Utah Territory legislature acted on January 17, 1862, to form a separate county from sections partitioned off Davis, Great Salt Lake, Summit, and Weber counties. The small settlement at Morgan was named the county seat. The town (and thus the new county) was named for the father (Jedediah Morgan Grant) of Heber J. Grant, who would serve as president of LDS Church from 1918 until 1945.

==Geography==
The central core of Morgan County, the narrow East Canyon valley (now called Morgan Valley), is ringed by mountains. In its southern portion, Main Canyon Creek flows southward from Summit County to join East Canyon Creek, which flows northward from a different portion of Summit County. At their intersection, a dam has been installed to create East Canyon Reservoir and State Park. The combined discharge (now called East Canyon Creek) from the dam flows northwestward to Morgan, where it combines with Deep Creek to discharge into the Weber River, which also flows into the county from Summit and follows Lost Canyon to the Morgan Valley. The now-augmented Weber flows northwestward to Mountain Green, then turns west to exit the county through Weber Canyon. The terrain generally slopes to the north and west, with its highest point, Thurston Peak, at ASL. The county has an area of , of which is land and is water. It is Utah&#x27;s third-smallest county by land area and smallest by total area.
